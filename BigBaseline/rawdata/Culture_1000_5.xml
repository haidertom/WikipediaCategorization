A '''beat''' is the timing and movement of a film or play. In the context of a [[screenplay]], it usually represents a pause in dialogue. In the context of the timing of a film, a beat refers to an event, decision, or discovery that alters the way the [[protagonist]] pursues his or her goal.

==Beats as pacing elements==
Beats are specific, measured, and spaced to create a pace that moves the progress of the story forward. Audiences feel uneven or erratic beats. Uneven beats are the most forgettable or sometimes tedious parts of a film. Erratic beats jolt the audience unnecessarily. Every cinematic [[genre]] has a beat that is specific to its development. [[Action film]] has significantly more beats (usually events); [[Drama film|drama]] has fewer beats (usually protagonist decisions or discovery).  Between each beat a [[Sequence (filming)|sequence]] occurs. This sequence is often a series of scenes that relates to the last beat and leads up to the next beat.

In most American films the beat falls approximately every five minutes.{{fact|date=October 2018}} Following is a beat example from ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]'':

*At 25 minutes: Andy talks to Red and asks for rock hammer. - Decision
*At 30 minutes: Andy gets rock hammer. - Event
*At 35 minutes: Andy risks his life to offer financial advice to Mr. Hadley. - Decision
*At 40 minutes: Andy notes ease of carving his name in the wall. - Discovery

After each beat listed above, a significant series of results takes place in the form of the sequence, but what most people remember are the beats, the moment something takes place with the protagonist.

==Beats in a screenplay==
Stories are divided into Acts, Acts into Sequences, Sequences into Scenes, and Scenes into Beats. Robert McKee uses the word "beat" differently than it is described above.  He describes the Beat as "the smallest element of structure...(Not to be confused with...an indication...meaning 'short pause')".  He defines a Beat as:  "an exchange of behavior in action/reaction.  Beat by Beat these changing behaviors shape the turning of a scene."  Specifically, a scene will contain multiple beats, the clashes in the conflict, which build a scene to eventually turn the values of a character's life, called a "Story Event".&lt;ref&gt;McKee, pgs 35-38&lt;/ref&gt;  He further describes beats as "distinctively different behaviors, . . . clear changes of action/reaction." &lt;ref&gt;Id. at 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christmas''' ({{lang-sv|jul}}, {{IPA-sv|jʉːl|}}) is celebrated throughout December and traditionally until [[St. Knut's Day]] on January 13. The main celebration and the exchange of gifts in many families takes place on [[Christmas Eve]], December 24. The [[Saint Lucy's Day|Lucia Day]] is celebrated during [[Advent]], on December 13.&lt;ref name="LuciaChristmas"&gt;[http://www.sweden.se/eng/Home/Lifestyle/Traditions/Reading/Lucia-and-Christmas/ Sweden.se: ''Lucia and Christmas''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121217031653/http://www.sweden.se/eng/Home/Lifestyle/Traditions/Reading/Lucia-and-Christmas/ |date=2012-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christmas contains a mix of domestic and foreign customs that have been adapted. Many Swedes celebrate [[Christmas]] in roughly the same way, and many local customs and specialities have disappeared.

== History ==
The origin of the Germanic word "Jul" is somewhat unclear. Around the year 600, it is mentioned in the Gothic calendar together with Christian religious texts. Around the year 900, the word "Jul" can be found in a tribute to king [[Harald Fairhair]], in which someone is said to "Dricka Jul" (Drink Jul).&lt;ref name="EtymologyJul"&gt;[http://www.firajul.nu/julenstraditioner/ordet-jul ''Firajul.nu: Ordet "Jul"'']&lt;/ref&gt; The pretext for the ''Jul'' celebration was to mark the [[winter solstice]] when the days start to get longer and the nights shorter again.

In Nordic prehistoric times there was a "midvinterblot" rite ([[mid-winter]] [[blót]]), which was a sacrificial rite held in mid-winter, which may either mean the same time as ''Jul'' (in later sources called ''julablot''), or in mid-January which was in the middle of the winter period. The people sacrificed cattle and perhaps humans to win the [[Æsir]]'s blessing on the germinating crop. The ''ás'' (singular of Æsir) who was especially hailed at this time was [[Odin]], who commonly went by the name of "Jólner".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Näsström|first1=Britt-Marie|title=Blot: Tro och offer i det förkristna Norden|publisher=Norstedts|pages=Chapter 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Jul'' was [[Christianized]], while the ''blót'' rites were forbidden and abandoned when Sweden became a Christian country.

The celebration of Christmas at the end of December is a very old tradition with many origins. Among these is the Old Norse Christmas celebration - which was prevailing in Scandinavia in the 11th century - and was celebrated in connection with the midwinter offering celebration. Moreover, there is the Christian Christmas celebration in memory of the birth of [[Jesus Christ]]. The earliest records of these celebrations are from year 333{{where|date=December 2014}}. Eight hundred years later this is merged with the Old Norse Christmas celebration.

In the Old Norse sources the pagan celebration of Jul in the Nordic countries is often described as "to drink jul/yule". The central aspect of the pagan [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] celebration of midwinter was to eat and drink well. To bake and to produce ale and mead were important preparations for the celebration. In medieval wooden calendars and pre-Christian picture stones, this celebration is still symbolised by a barrel of ale, or a drinking horn. So the emphasis on food and drink traditions was originally a pagan trait of the Christmas celebration.&lt;ref name="JulFoodHistory"&gt;[http://www.bandoli.no/christmas.htm ''Bandoli.no: Where is the Christ in Christmas?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christmas tree is a custom that was imported from Germany in the 1880s. The foremer tradition of giving joke presents, often a log of wood, was replaced during the late-19th century and 20th century by Christmas gifts given out by the [[Christmas goat]] (''Julbocken'') or, especially later, [[Santa Claus]] (''Jultomten''). &lt;ref name="Christmas"&gt;[http://www.sweden.se/eng/Home/Lifestyle/Traditions/Celebrating-the-Swedish-way/Christmas/ Sweden.se: ''Christmas'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Traditions ==
===The month of December===
The [[Christmas and holiday season|Christmas celebrations]] in Sweden usually starts with the first Advent in the end of November. However Christmas decorations and ''julmust'' might go on sale in stores much earlier, often directly after [[All Saints Day]]. At this time many people start to plan their Christmas and start buying gifts. The 13th of December is Lucia where most of the children and also some adults dress up and have processions in preschool, school and companies. The third and fourth Advent is important for many families as many preparations are done then. Baking and cooking are common activities, just like decorating the home. A big shopping of food and drink is often done the weeks before the holidays as well as the last purchases of Christmas gifts.

Many preschools and schools start their Christmas vacation between December 17 to 22. Many workplaces start the vacation later, between December 20 and 23. The start of the vacation depends on what day of the week Christmas Eve is on. The last days before Christmas Eve, between December 20 and 23, the greatest preparations are made like, preparing most of the food, buying and decorating the Christmas tree and wrapping presents. During the last days there are usually a lot of people in stores and shopping malls to buy things for the Christmas celebrations.

After Christmas Eve there are two [[public holiday]]s: ''juldagen'' (Christmas Day) and ''annandag jul'' (Boxing Day). Most of the families have holiday and are free from work, but some workplaces can start the work again in the days before New Year's Eve. After the New Year's Eve the schools usually have at least a week before the spring term starts, but workplaces often start the work again a couple of days after the new year.

=== Christmas tree ===
[[File:Falu gruva 2014-12-06.jpg|thumb|A Swedish Christmas tree, outdoors.]]
[[File:Julgran, Sverige, 2017.jpg|thumb|A Swedish Christmas tree, indoors, and a [[Yule Goat|Yule goat]].]]
The story of the Christmas tree begins in Germany in the 16th century. During the 17th and 18th centuries the Christmas tree started being dressed with candles. The first Swedish Christmas trees were generally decorated with live candles and treats such as fruit and candy. Apples were often hung on the branches where the candles were located to make them more parallel to the ground{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}. It soon became more common for families to make their own decorations with paper and straw. Some families preferred to build a ''[[Ljuskrona]]'' decorated with cut paper. From around 1880, commercial Christmas tree decorations were readily available in larger Swedish cities, the finest of which were imported from Germany. The day that people in Sweden buy and dress their Christmas tree varies greatly from family to family, but most have them dressed on 13 December and throw them out by 13 January. Commonly used decorations today include: baubles, candles, apples, Swedish flags, small gnomes, tasseled caps, and straw ornaments. The house may be filled with red tulips and the smell of ''pepparkakor'' - a heart-star, or goat-shaped gingerbread biscuits.&lt;ref name="OrnamentsHistory"&gt;[http://www.thehistoryofchristmas.com/traditions/sweden.htm ''Sweden - Christmas traditions &amp; customs'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[St. Knut's Day]] (13 January) marks the end of the Swedish [[Christmas and holiday season]]. Children, especially, may celebrate it with a [[Knut's party]].&lt;ref name=rocking&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlivingcity.com/stockholm/cultural/events/julgransplundring/|title=Julgransplundring: Rocking around the Christmas Tree|publisher=Your Living City|language=|date=3 January 2014|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jultomten ===
''Jultomten'', or just ''tomten'', is the being who brings the gifts at ''Julafton'' (the evening of December 24). The gifts are called ''julklappar'', and are probably a modern version of the [[Yule log]]. ''Jultomten'' does not climb down the chimney, he delivers the gifts in person. This task is often performed by an old man who secretly dresses up as ''Jultomten'' and knocks at the door with a sack of gifts.

The origin of the modern ''Jultomte'' is a hybridisation between the pre-Christian being called ''[[Tomte]]'' and the (originally Dutch) [[Santa Claus]]. A ''Tomte'' is mostly portrayed as a small, gnomelike spirit being who lives on a farm and takes care of it (or the family) while the farmer family are asleep. He might be a gift giver if the farmers treat him and the livestock correctly. The ''tomte'' is an echo of ancient [[ancestor worship|ancestral cult]]. It is thought that the ''tomte'' was considered a spirit of previous generations at the homestead, and there are references to them following the family/clan, when they move. Despite its different cultural roots, the ''Jultomte'' (''Tomte'' of ''Jul'') is today portrayed similarly to the commonly known image of Santa Claus.

=== Food and drink === 
[[File:Julmaten 2017.jpg|thumb|Christmas food, with Christmas ham, Janssons frestelse, meatballs, prinskorv, red cabbage.]]
[[File:Dopp i grytan.jpg|thumb|Dopp i grytan]]
The foods served in Sweden during Christmastime differ per region. But here, too, homogenisation has set in, due in no small part to the uniform offerings of the department stores and the ready availability of convenience foods. Few have time to salt their own hams or stuff their own pork sausages nowadays.

Traditional foods include a [[julbord]] which has been prepared with all the classic dishes: Christmas ham, pork sausage, an egg and anchovy mixture (gubbröra), herring salad, pickled herring, home-made liver pâté, wort-flavoured rye bread (vörtbröd), potatoes and a special fish dish, [[lutefisk|lutfisk]]. The seasonal soft drink ''[[julmust]]'' is also served at the julbord, as well as during the whole Christmas holiday.

A traditional ''julbord'' is typically eaten in three courses. The dishes include local and family specialties. The first course would typically be a variety of fish, particularly pickled herring and lox ([[gravlax]]). It is customary to eat particular foods together; herring is typically eaten with boiled potatoes and hard-boiled eggs and is frequently accompanied by strong spirits like [[snaps]], [[brännvin]] or [[akvavit]] with or without spices.

Other traditional dishes would be (smoked) eel, [[rollmops]], herring salad, baked herring, smoked salmon and crab [[canapé]]s, accompanied by sauces and dips.

The second course is often a selection of cold sliced meats, the most important cold cut being the [[Christmas ham]] (''julskinka'') with mustard. Other traditional cuts include homemade sausages, [[leverpastej]] and several types of [[brawn]]. It is also common to serve the cold meats with sliced [[cheese]], pickled [[cucumbers]] and soft and [[crisp bread]]s.

The third course would be warm dishes. Traditionally, the third course begins with  soaking bread in the [[stock (food)|stock]] from the Christmas ham, which is called ''dopp i grytan''. Warm dishes include Swedish [[meatball]]s (''köttbullar''), small fried hot dog sausages (''[[prinskorv]]''), roasted [[pork ribs]] (''[[revbensspjäll]]''), and warm potato casserole, matchstick potatoes layered with cream, onion and [[sprats]] called ''[[Janssons frestelse]]'' (literally "Jansson's Temptation").

Other dishes are pork sausages (''[[fläskkorv]]''), smoked pork and potato sausages (''[[isterband]]''), [[cabbage rolls]] (''[[kåldolmar]]''), [[baked beans]], [[omelette]] with shrimps or mushrooms covered with béchamel sauce. Side dishes include [[beetroot]] salad in mayonnaise and warm stewed red, green or brown [[cabbage]].

[[Lutfisk]], lyed fish made of stockfish (dried [[common ling|ling]] or [[cod]]) served with boiled potato, thick [[white sauce]] and green peas can be served with the warm dishes or as a separate fourth course. Lutfisk is often served as dinner the second day after the traditional Christmas Yule-table dinner. Julbord desserts include [[rice pudding]] (''risgrynsgröt''), sprinkled with [[cinnamon]] powder. Traditionally, an [[almond]] is hidden in the bowl of rice pudding and whoever finds it receives a small prize or is recognised for having good luck. Julbord is served from early December until just before Christmas at restaurants and until [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] in some homes.

The ham is either boiled, or broiled and then painted and glazed with a mixture of egg, breadcrumbs and mustard. [[Beer]] and the occasional [[snaps]] are common beverages to this Christmas meal. Mulled wine [[Mulled wine#Nordic glögg|''glögg'']], [[ginger nut]]s and [[saffron bun]]s are served throughout December.

Many Swedes visit the service on [[Advent Sunday]], the [[Midnight Mass]] on December 24 or the early morning Christmas Day service (''[[Julotta]]'').

The '''circuit of culture''' is a theory or framework used in the area of [[cultural studies]]. It was devised in 1997 by a group of theorists when studying the [[Walkman]] cassette player. The theory suggests that in studying a cultural text or artifact you must look at five aspects: its representation, identity, production, consumption and regulation. Du Gay et al. suggest that "taken together (these 5 points) complete a sort of circuit...through which any analysis of a cultural text...must pass if it is to be adequately studied."&lt;ref&gt;du Gay et al. (1997) ''Doing Cultural Studies: The story of the Sony Walkman'' Milton Keynes: Open University; Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gerard Goggin openly uses this framework in his book ''Cell Phone Culture: Mobile technology in everyday life'' in order to fully understand the cell phone as a cultural artifact. His book is split into four parts: production, consumption, regulation, and representation and identity (through looking at mobile convergences).&lt;ref&gt; Goggin, Gerard. (2006) ''Cell Phone Culture: Mobile technology in everyday life'' Routledge, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''co-production''' is a [[joint venture]] between two or more different [[Production company|production companies]] for the purpose of [[film production]], [[television production]], [[video game development]], and so on. In the case of an international co-production, production companies from different countries (typically two to three) are working together.

Co-production also refers to the way services are produced by their users, in some parts or entirely.

==History and benefits==
Following the Second World War, US film companies were forbidden by the [[Marshall Plan]] to take their film profits in the form of [[foreign exchange reserves|foreign exchange]] out of European countries.  As a result, several film companies started studios and production companies in nations such as the United Kingdom and Italy to use their "frozen funds".

To use these profits in England, film companies would set up production companies using the required amount of British film technicians and actors to qualify as British Productions in order to take advantage of the [[Eady Levy]].

At the same time, US citizens working outside the country for 510 days during a period of 18 months would not be taxed on their earnings by the [[Internal Revenue Service]]. Though this scheme was developed for the aid of American humanitarian workers redeveloping nations destroyed in World War II, agents discovered that Hollywood actors, directors, and screenwriters would qualify for the tax break by working outside the US for the same period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/309/309.F2d.51.17759_1.html 309 F.2d 51&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514061523/http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/309/309.F2d.51.17759_1.html |date=2010-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

International film co-production was very common in the 50s, 60s and 70s between Italian, Spanish and French production companies, as exemplified by most of the [[Spaghetti-western]] and [[sword and sandal]] movies being Spanish-Italian coproductions, typically directed by an Italian, played fifty-fifty by Spanish and Italian actors and shot in southern Spain landscapes. Due to the worldwide popularity of Hollywood stars they would be used to guarantee a respectable audience around the world as well as the United States. The relatively low production costs and high box office return of these films often led to direct Hollywood investment to the non-US studios and producers such as [[Dino DeLaurentis]]. An example of such pan-European coproductions was ''[[Treasure Island (1972 live-action film)|Treasure Island]]'' (1972), a British-French-German-Italian-Spanish film, starring US [[Orson Welles]].

To qualify as an Italian film a film needed either an Italian director or cameraman plus at least two Italian featured players and an Italian film laboratory to process the film.&lt;ref&gt;Pink, Sidney ''So You Want to Make Movies: My Life as an Independent Film Producer'' Pineapple Press; 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Actor and director [[Mel Welles]] recalled that in the 1960s and 1970s the government of Spain would give producers funds based on the budget of the film whilst Italy would give producers funds based on the box office results of the film, however the government could interfere with production if they chose to&lt;ref&gt;p.274 Paul, Louis ''Mel Welles Interview'' ''Tales from the Cult Film Trenches: Interviews with 36 Actors from Horror, Science Fiction and Exploitation Cinema'' McFarland, 06/09/2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The first European nations to sign a film co-production agreement were France and Italy in 1949. Between 1949 and 1964 711 films were co-produced between the two nations.&lt;ref&gt;p. 55 Bergfelder, Tim ''International Adventures: German Popular Cinema and European Co-productions in the 1960s'' Berghahn Books, 01/01/2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the expense of filmmaking, many films made outside the [[United States]] are international co-productions.  For example, ''[[Amélie]]'' is set in France and stars French actors, but many scenes were shot in a [[Germany|German]] film studio and the [[post-production]] work was undertaken by a German film company.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Jeunet, director's commentary on ''Amelie'' DVD.&lt;/ref&gt;  International co-productions open new markets for films and television programs and can increase the output of high quality productions through the sharing of equity investment.&lt;ref&gt;DCITA (Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts) in collaboration with the AFC (Australian Film Commission). 2001. Review of the Australian Official Coproduction Program.&lt;/ref&gt;

Official co-productions are made possible by agreements between countries. Co-production agreements seek to achieve economic, cultural and diplomatic goals. For filmmakers, the key attraction of a treaty co-production is that it qualifies as a national production in each of the partner nations and can access benefits that are available to the local film and television industry in each country. Benefits may include government financial assistance, tax concessions and inclusion in domestic television broadcast quotas.  International co-productions also occur outside the framework of official co-productions, for example with countries that do not have an agreement in place, or projects that do not satisfy official co-production criteria.

Dialogue director [[Mickey Knox (actor)|Mickey Knox]] recalled that in order to bring in American dollars and British pounds many countries behind the former [[Iron Curtain]] offered producers lucrative deals.  In exchange for a share of the profits or an outright payment the host country would pick up most of the local charges; with the film often credited as a co-production.&lt;ref&gt;p.283 Knox, Mickey ''The Good, the Bad, and the Dolce Vita'' 2004 Nation Books&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, co-productions are a response to the challenges of internationalisation by countries with small production sectors, as they seek to maintain a viable production industry and produce culturally-specific content for national audiences. However, these dual goals also produce tensions within national film and television sectors. Although a co-production agreement may make available more resources, an international production risks being less relevant to its target audiences than purely local productions.

==Benefits of international co-production==

As a response to internationalisation, co-production offers both benefits and drawbacks. A 1996 survey of [[Canada|Canadian]] international and domestic joint ventures identified the benefits as: 
* the ability to pool financial resources; 
* access to the partner government's incentives and subsidies; 
* access to the partner's market, or to a third market; 
* access to a particular project initiated by the partner; 
* access to a desired location; or to cheaper inputs; 
* cultural benefits; and 
* the opportunity to learn from the partner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cjc-online.ca/viewarticle.php?id=347 Hoskins, Colin, Stuart McFadyen, and Adam Finn. 1996. “A Comparison of Domestic and International Joint Ventures in Television Program and Feature Film Production.” Canadian Journal of Communication 21(1).]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Costs of international co-production==

Hoskins, McFadyen and Finn also identify drawbacks of international co-production: 
* increased co-ordination and shooting costs; 
* increased costs of dealing with government; 
* loss of control and cultural specificity; and
* opportunistic behaviour by production partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cjc-online.ca/viewarticle.php?id=347 Hoskins, Colin, Stuart McFadyen, and Adam Finn. 1996. “A Comparison of Domestic and International Joint Ventures in Television Program and Feature Film Production.” Canadian Journal of Communication 21(1).]&lt;/ref&gt;

Debate concerning international co-productions centres on the potential for productions to have little cultural specificity in any of its home countries.   Internationalisation brings tensions in terms of cost, benefit and opportunity. In [[Australia]], for example, O'Regan and Ward have argued that an influx of international productions to [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Queensland's Gold Coast]] in the 1990s presented a distinct challenge to local producers. In the face of such challenges, local producers need to learn "how to internationalise local film and television production in order to retain and hopefully build market shares; and how to develop new models of financing that combine both local and foreign sources."&lt;ref&gt;O'Regan, Tom  and Susan Ward. 2006. “Experimenting with the Local and Transnational: Television Drama Production on the Gold Coast." ''Continuum: Journal of Media &amp; Cultural Studies'', 20(1): 17.&lt;/ref&gt; One approach has been to reconcile this tension by creating "local production with an explicit international orientation."&lt;ref&gt;O'Regan, Tom and Susan Ward. 2006. "Experimenting with the Local and Transnational: Television Drama Production on the Gold Coast." ''Continuum: Journal of Media &amp; Cultural Studies'', 20(1): 17.&lt;/ref&gt; But not everyone agrees this is the best approach. For example, the idea that Australia should produce more 'deterritorialised' programming such as fantasy and science fiction has been met with disquiet in some sections of the industry.

In [[Australia]], some have suggested that a narrow definition of 'local content' has restricted Australia's ability to engage with international partners. [[Julia Hammett-Jamart]] reflects on the different approaches taken by [[France]] and [[Australia]] to this issue and argues that a literal-minded definition of [[Australia]]n culture has been 'antagonistic to the collaborative nature of film production, and in particular international co-production'.&lt;ref&gt;Hammett-Jamart, Julia. 2004. “Regulating Diversity: Cultural Diversity, National Film Policy and the International Coproduction of Films.” Media International incorporating Culture and Policy, no. 111: 46-62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hammett-Jamart|first1=Julia|title=Trade in National Cinema: Australian film policy implementation on French-Australian official co-productions 1986-2006|date=2014|publisher=University of Wollongong|location=Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hammett-Jamart|first1=Julia|title=Context for International Co-production|journal=Metro Magazine|date=March 2004|issue=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canada|Canadian]] study found evidence that, for television projects, domestic joint ventures performed better than international joint ventures.  However, in the case of larger budget projects, domestic joint ventures were found not to be a viable alternative to international joint ventures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cjc-online.ca/viewarticle.php?id=347 Hoskins, Colin, Stuart McFadyen, and Adam Finn. 1996. “A Comparison of Domestic and International Joint Ventures in Television Program and Feature Film Production.” Canadian Journal of Communication 21(1).]&lt;/ref&gt;  In their later study of co-production in Australia, the authors identified financial pooling as the most important benefit and increased co-ordination costs as the greatest drawback.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cjc-online.ca/viewarticle.php?id=508 Hoskins, Colin, Stuart McFadyen and Adam Finn. 1999. “International Joint Ventures in the Production of Australian Feature Films and Television Programs.” Canadian Journal of Communication 24(1)]&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that co-production is more suited to larger budget productions, primarily film, which have greater capital needs but do not carry the same dollar-for-dollar coordination costs as smaller projects.

Government bodies are keenly aware of these concerns.  A review of [[Australia]]n co-production rules acknowledged the tensions between cultural and economic objectives, and argues that 'requiring the program's aims to be predominantly economic or cultural would hobble the program and reduce its effectiveness in achieving either outcome'.&lt;ref&gt;DCITA (Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts) in collaboration with the AFC (Australian Film Commission). 2001. Review of the Australian Official Coproduction Program.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2967">'''Creative Participation''' is a term used in social sciences to describe the position of the observer towards the observed. ''Creative Participation'' - originally a [[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl]] term from the 1920s for analysing social relations of cultural groupings, modified and revived by the German ethnologist [https://web.archive.org/web/20071125194659/http://www.ifeas.uni-mainz.de/info/Magisterabgeschlossen.html V. Dahlheimer]- rewrites the traditional [[participant observation]] approach and leaves more room for non-materialistic cognition. Dynamic movements which can not be measured from disconnected or relative viewpoints can be captured by means of feelings. Verification of data through creative participation is possible through practical conception only and can at best be validated by empirical means. ''Creative Participation'' seeks to counteract classical problems in social science like i.e. rigid defense of theory, personal ambition, and weight of tradition which can lead to social and personal fragmentation.

In consumer psychology ''Creative Participation'' is defined as consumers' co-creation of novel and valuable products, services, ideas, consumption experiences with firms during their purchase or consumption process. According to "Need for Uniqueness"- theory, one of consumers' motivations for creative participation may come from their need for unique products. When consumers need to acquire the symbol of distinct self by unique products, they are driven to create.

''Creative Participation'' is also used as an educational training method. It can breakdown barriers between participants (and agencies), and encourage creative problem-solving, and the building of positive relationships.

In the political world ''Creative Participation'' presents the theory and practice of innovative forms of political participation, i.e. citizens cooperate in public action to achieve a common good.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3987">{{Other uses|Cultural Analysis (disambiguation)}}

As a discipline, '''cultural analysis''' is based on using [[qualitative research]] methods of the arts, humanities, social sciences, in particular [[ethnography]] and [[anthropology]], to collect data on [[cultural phenomena]] and to interpret cultural representations and practices; in an effort to gain new knowledge or understanding through analysis of that data and cultural processes. This is particularly useful for understanding and mapping trends, influences, effects, and affects within cultures.

There are four themes to sociological cultural analysis:

1. Adaptation and Change&lt;br /&gt;
This refers to how well a certain culture adapts to its surroundings by being used and developed. Some examples of this are foods, tools, home, surroundings, art, etc. that show how the given culture adapted. Also, this aspect aims to show how the given culture makes the environment more accommodating.

2. How culture is used to survive&lt;br /&gt;
How the given culture helps its members survive the environment.

3. [[Holism]], Specificity&lt;br /&gt;
The ability to put the observations into a single collection, and presenting it in a coherent manner.

4. Expressions&lt;br /&gt;
This focuses on studying the expressions and performance of everyday culture.

==Cultural Analysis in the Humanities==
This developed at the intersection of cultural studies, comparative literature, art history, fine art, philosophy, literary theory, theology, anthropology. It developed an interdisciplinary approach to the study of texts, images, films, and all related cultural practices. It offers an interdisciplinary approach to the analysis of cultural representations and practices.

Cultural Analysis is also a method for rethinking our relation to history because it makes visible the position of researcher, writer or student.  The social and cultural present from which we look at past cultural practices—history— shapes the interpretations that are made of the past, while cultural analysis also reveals how the past shapes the present through the role of cultural memory for instance.  Cultural analysis understands culture, therefore, as a constantly changing set of practices that are in dialogue with the past as it has been registered through texts, images, buildings, documents, stories, myths.

In addition to having a relation to disciplines also interested in cultures as what people do and say, believe and think, such as ethnography and anthropology, cultural analysis as a practice in the humanities considers the texts and images, the codes and behaviours, the beliefs and imaginings that you might study in literature, philosophy, art history.  But cultural analysis does not confine the meanings to the disciplinary methods. It allows and requires dialogue across many ways of understanding what people have done and what people are doing through acts, discourses, practices, statements.  Cultural analysis crosses the boundaries between disciplines but also between formal and informal cultural activities.

The major purpose of cultural analysis is to develop analytical tools for reading and understanding a wide range of cultural practices and forms, past and present.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3075">[[Anne, Queen of Great Britain]], is depicted in novels, film and television.

Anne is played by [[Margaret Tyzack]] in the 1969 [[BBC]] television serial ''[[The First Churchills]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_first_churchills_1971/| title=The First Churchills (1971)| publisher=rottentomatoes.com| access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth Spriggs]] portrayed her in the 2004 BBC drama documentary ''[[Wren: The Man Who Built Britain]]''. In the 1984 comedy ''[[Yellowbeard]]'' she was played by [[Peter Bull]] (in his last film role) as a fat, senile woman, dominated by Sarah Churchill. 

Anne is a character in the novel ''[[The Man Who Laughs]]'' by [[Victor Hugo]], and was portrayed on screen by [[Anna Kallina]] in the 1921 Austrian silent adaptation ''[[The Grinning Face]]'' and by [[Josephine Crowell]] in the [[The Man Who Laughs (1928 film)|1928 silent adaptation]]. She is also a character in the play ''[[Le Verre d'eau]]'' by [[Eugène Scribe]]; [[Gunnel Lindblom]] portrayed her in the 1960 Swedish TV adaptation ''Ett Glas vatten'', [[Liselotte Pulver]] in the 1960 West German film adaptation ''[[Das Glas Wasser]]'', [[Judit Halász]] in the 1977 Hungarian TV adaptation ''Sakk-matt'', and [[Natalya Belokhvostikova]] in the 1979 Soviet film adaptation ''[[Stakan vody]]'' (Стакан воды).

The titular play ''[[Queen Anne (play)| Queen Anne]]'', written by the playwright [[Helen Edmundson]], dramatizes the relationship between Anne and [[Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough]], as well as the court politics and succession issues of Anne's court. It was first produced by the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] at the [[Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon]] between November, 2015 and January, 2016, before opening at the [[Theatre Royal, Haymarket]] in London, where it ran between June and September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org.uk/whats-on/queen-anne/ |title=Queen Anne &amp;#124; Royal Shakespeare Company &amp;#124; Theatre |publisher=Rsc.org.uk |date=2015-05-05 |accessdate=2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rsc.org.uk/queen-anne/about-the-play&lt;/ref&gt;

Queen Anne is portrayed by actress [[Olivia Colman]] in the 2018 film ''[[The Favourite (film)|The Favourite]]'', which centers on the competition for the queen's affection between the Duchess of Marlborough and [[Abigail Masham, Baroness Masham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2018/09/yorgos-lanthimos-the-favourite-lesbian-love-triangle-1201999899/|title=Yorgos Lanthimos on the Lesbian Love Triangle of 'The Favourite': 'I Didn't Want This to Become an Issue'|website=[[IndieWire]]|first=Eric|last=Kohn|date=3 September 2018|accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artistic cultural heritage of the [[Roman Empire]] served as a foundation for later [[Western culture]], particularly via the [[Renaissance]] and [[Neoclassicism]] (as exemplified here).]]
'''Cultural heritage''' is the legacy of physical artifacts and intangible attributes of a group or [[society]] that is inherited from past generations. 

Cultural heritage includes [[cultural property|tangible culture]] (such as buildings, monuments, landscapes, books, works of art, and artifacts), intangible culture (such as folklore, traditions, language, and knowledge), and natural heritage (including culturally significant landscapes, and [[biodiversity]]).&lt;ref&gt; Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. MARSHALL REV. INTELL. PROP. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl &lt;/ref&gt;

The deliberate act of keeping cultural heritage from the present for the future is known as [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|preservation]] (American English) or [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|conservation]] (British English), though these terms may have more specific or technical meaning in the same contexts in the other dialect.

== The ethics and rationale of cultural preservation ==
Objects are a part of the study of human history because they provide a concrete basis for ideas, and can validate them. Their preservation demonstrates a recognition of the necessity of the past and of the things that tell its story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Tanselle| first =G. Thomas | publication-date = 1998 | title = Literature and Artifacts | publication-place =Charlottesville, VA | publisher =Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia | isbn = 1-883631-06-8 | oclc = 39223648 | year =1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Past is a Foreign Country'', [[David Lowenthal]] observes that preserved objects also validate [[memory|memories]]. While [[3D scanner|digital acquisition techniques]] can provide a technological solution that is able to acquire the shape and the appearance of artifacts with an unprecedented precision&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author1=Paolo Cignoni |author2=Roberto Scopigno |title=Sampled 3D models for CH applications: A viable and enabling new medium or just a technological exercise?|journal=ACM Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage |volume=1 | issue=1 |pages=1 |date=June 2008 |doi=10.1145/1367080.1367082| url=http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publications/2008/CS08/ | format=PDF |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in human history, the actuality of the object, as opposed to a reproduction, draws people in and gives them a literal way of touching the past. This unfortunately poses a danger as places and things are damaged by the hands of tourists, the light required to display them, and other risks of making an object known and available. The reality of this risk reinforces the fact that all artifacts are in a constant state of chemical transformation, so that what is considered to be preserved is actually changing – it is never as it once was.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Lowenthal| first =David | publication-date = 1985 | title = The Past is a Foreign Country | publication-place =New York | publisher =Cambridge University Press | isbn = 0-521-22415-2 | oclc = 12052097 | year =1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly changing is the value each generation may place on the past and on the artifacts that link it to the past.

Classical civilizations, and especially the Indian, have attributed supreme importance to the preservation of tradition. Its central idea was that social institutions, scientific knowledge and technological applications need to use a "heritage" as a "resource".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url =https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvdavns.org%2Fdata%2Fproposing_varanasi.pdf   | title =  Proposing Varanasi for the World Heritage List of UNESCO| publisher =  Varanasi Development Authority}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Using contemporary language, we could say that ancient Indians considered, as social resources, both economic assets (like natural resources and their exploitation structure) and factors promoting social integration (like institutions for the preservation of knowledge and for the maintenance of civil order).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Singh, Rana P.B., Vrinda Dar and S. Pravin  | title =Rationales for including Varanasi as heritage city in the UNESCO World Heritage List  | publisher = National Geographic Journal of India (varanasi) 2001, 47:177-200  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethics considered that what had been inherited should not be consumed, but should be handed over, possibly enriched, to successive generations. This was a moral imperative for all, except in the final life stage of [[sannyasa]].

What one generation considers "cultural heritage" may be rejected by the next generation, only to be revived by a subsequent generation.

==Types of heritage==

===Cultural property===
{{see also|Material culture}}
[[Cultural property]] includes the physical, or "tangible" cultural heritage, such as artworks. These are generally split into two groups of movable and immovable heritage. Immovable heritage includes building so (which themselves may include installed art such as organs, stained glass windows, and frescos), large industrial installations or other historic places and [[monument]]s. Moveable heritage includes books, documents, moveable artworks, machines, clothing, and other artifacts, that are considered worthy of preservation for the future. These include objects significant to the archaeology, architecture, science or technology of a specified culture.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. MARSHALL REV. INTELL. PROP. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspects and disciplines of the preservation and conservation of tangible culture include:
* [[Museology]]
* [[Archival science]]
* [[Conservation (cultural heritage)]]
** [[Art conservation]]
** [[Archaeological conservation]]
** [[Architectural conservation]]
** [[Film preservation]]
** [[Phonograph record#Preservation|Phonograph record preservation]]
* [[Digital preservation]]

===Intangible culture===
[[File:Anker Grossvater erzählt eine Geschichte 1884.jpg|thumb|''The Grandfather tells a story'', by [[Albert Anker]], ca. 1884.]]
{{main article|Intangible cultural heritage}}

"Intangible cultural heritage" consists of non-physical aspects of a particular culture, more often maintained by social customs during a specific period in history. The concept includes the ways and means of behavior in a society, and the often formal rules for operating in a particular cultural climate. These include social values and [[tradition]]s, [[convention (norm)|customs]] and practices, [[aesthetic]] and [[spirituality|spiritual]] beliefs, [[artistic expression]], [[language]] and other aspects of human activity. The significance of physical artifacts can be interpreted as an act against the backdrop of socioeconomic, political, ethnic, religious and philosophical values of a particular group of people. Naturally, intangible cultural heritage is more difficult to preserve than physical objects.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Aspects of the preservation and conservation of cultural intangibles include:

* [[folklore]]
* [[oral history]]
* [[language preservation]]

===Natural heritage===
{{See also|Conservation movement}}
"[[Natural heritage]]" is also an important part of a society's heritage, encompassing the [[countryside]] and natural environment, including [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]], scientifically known as [[biodiversity]], as well as geological elements (including mineralogical, geomorphological, paleontological, etc.), scientifically known as [[geodiversity]]. These kind of heritage sites often serve as an important component in a country's [[tourist industry]], attracting many visitors from abroad as well as locally. Heritage can also include cultural landscapes (natural features that may have cultural attributes).

Aspects of the preservation and conservation of natural heritage include:
* [[Rare breed (agriculture)|Rare breeds conservation]]
* [[Heirloom plant]]s

==World heritage movement==
[[File:Plaque Carthage Unesco.JPG|thumb|175px|Plaque stating the designation of [[Carthage]] as a World Heritage Site.]]
Significant was the Convention Concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage that was adopted by the General Conference of [[UNESCO]] in 1972. As of 2011, there are 936 [[World Heritage Sites]]: 725 cultural, 183 natural, and 28 mixed properties, in 153 countries. Each of these sites is considered important to the international community.

The underwater cultural heritage is protected by the [[UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage]]. This convention is a legal instrument helping states parties to improve the protection of their underwater cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[This convention is a legal instrument helping states parties to improve the protection of their underwater cultural heritage]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, UNESCO has begun designating [[masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]]. The [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] sitting as part of the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] with article 15 of its Covenant had sought to instill the principles under which cultural heritage is protected as part of a basic human right.

Key international documents and bodies include:
* [[Athens Charter (Preservation)|Athens Charter]], 1931
* [[Roerich Pact]], 1935
* [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]], 1954, (with a definition of cultural heritage item adopted by some national law)
* [[Venice Charter]], 1964
* [[Barcelona Charter]], 2002 (regarding maritime vessel preservation)
* [[ICOMOS]]
* [[International Committee of the Blue Shield]] Managing natural and manmade disasters.
* [[International Institute for Conservation]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9634">'''Cultural history''' combines the approaches of [[anthropology]] and [[history]] to look at [[popular culture|popular cultural]] traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience. It examines the records and [[narrative]] descriptions of past matter, encompassing the continuum of events (occurring in succession and leading from the past to the present and even into the future) pertaining to a [[culture]].

Cultural history records and interprets past events involving human beings through the [[social]], [[cultural]], and [[political]] [[Social environment|milieu]] of or relating to [[the arts]] and manners that a group favors. [[Jacob Burckhardt]] (1818–1897) helped found cultural history as a discipline. Cultural history studies and interprets the record of [[human societies]] by denoting the various distinctive ways of living built up by a group of people under consideration. Cultural history involves the aggregate of past cultural activity, such as [[ceremony]], class in practices, and the interaction with locales.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Description==
Cultural history overlaps in its approaches with the French movements of ''[[histoire des mentalités]]'' (Philippe Poirrier, 2004) and the so-called new history, and in the U.S. it is closely associated with the field of [[American studies]]. As originally conceived and practiced by 19th Century Swiss historian [[Jakob Burckhardt]] with regard to the [[Italian Renaissance]], cultural history was oriented to the study of a particular historical period in its entirety, with regard not only for its painting, sculpture and architecture, but for the economic basis underpinning society, and the social institutions of its daily life as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[Siegfried Giedion]], ''Space, Time and Architecture'' (6th ed.), p 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Echoes of Burkhardt's approach in the 20th century can be seen in [[Johan Huizinga]]'s ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages|The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'' (1919).&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal |first=Sean Farrell |last=Moran |title=Johan Huizinga, ''The Waning of the Middle Ages'', and the Writing of History |journal=Michigan Academician |volume=42 |year=2016 |pages=410–22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most often the focus is on phenomena shared by non-elite groups in a society, such as: [[carnival]], [[festival]], and public [[ritual]]s; [[performance]] traditions of [[Narrative|tale]], [[Epic poetry|epic]], and other verbal forms; cultural evolutions in human relations (ideas, sciences, arts, techniques); and cultural expressions of social movements such as [[nationalism]]. Also examines main historical concepts as [[power (sociology)|power]], [[ideology]], [[Social class|class]], [[culture]], [[cultural identity]], [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[perception]] and new historical methods as narration of body. Many studies consider adaptations of traditional culture to [[mass media]] (television, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, etc.), from [[Printing|print]] to [[film]] and, now, to the [[Internet]] (culture of [[capitalism]]). Its modern approaches come from [[art history]], [[Annales School|Annales]], [[Marxist]] school, [[microhistory]] and new cultural history.

Common theoretical [[touchstone (metaphor)|touchstone]]s for recent cultural history have included: [[Jürgen Habermas]]'s formulation of the [[public sphere]] in ''The Structural Transformation of the Bourgeois Public Sphere''; [[Clifford Geertz]]'s notion of '[[thick description]]' (expounded in, for example, ''The Interpretation of Cultures''); and the idea of [[memory]] as a cultural-historical category, as discussed in [[Paul Connerton]]'s ''How Societies Remember''.

===Historiography and the French Revolution===
The area where new-style cultural history is often pointed to as being almost a [[paradigm]] is the '[[Historical revisionism|revisionist]]' history of the [[French Revolution]], dated somewhere since [[François Furet]]'s massively influential 1978 essay ''Interpreting the French Revolution''. The 'revisionist interpretation' is often characterised as replacing the allegedly dominant, allegedly [[Marxist]], 'social interpretation' which locate the causes of the Revolution in class dynamics. The revisionist approach has tended to put more emphasis on '[[political culture]]'. Reading ideas of political culture through Habermas' conception of the public sphere, historians of the Revolution in the past few decades have looked at the role and position of cultural themes such as [[gender]], [[ritual]], and [[ideology]] in the context of pre-revolutionary French political culture.

Historians who might be grouped under this umbrella are [[Roger Chartier]], [[Robert Darnton]], [[Patrice Higonnet]], [[Lynn Hunt]], Keith Baker, Joan Landes, Mona Ozouf and [[Sarah Maza]]. Of course, these scholars all pursue fairly diverse interests, and perhaps too much emphasis has been placed on the paradigmatic nature of the new history of the French Revolution. Colin Jones, for example, is no stranger to cultural history, [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]], or Marxism, and has persistently argued that the Marxist interpretation is not dead, but can be revivified; after all, Habermas' logic was heavily indebted to a Marxist understanding. Meanwhile, Rebecca Spang has also recently argued that for all its emphasis on difference and newness, the 'revisionist' approach retains the idea of the French Revolution as a watershed in the history of (so-called) [[modernity]], and that the problematic notion of 'modernity' has itself attracted scant attention.

==Cultural studies==
''[[Cultural studies]]'' is an academic discipline popular among a diverse group of scholars.  It combines [[political economy]], [[geography]], [[sociology]], [[social theory]], [[literary theory]], [[film theory|film/video studies]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[philosophy]], and [[art history]]/[[art criticism|criticism]] to study [[culture|cultural]] phenomena in various societies.  Cultural studies researchers often concentrate on how a particular phenomenon relates to matters of [[ideology]], [[nationality]], [[ethnicity]], [[social class]], and/or [[gender]].  The term was coined by [[Richard Hoggart]] in 1964 when he founded the Birmingham [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies]]. It has since become strongly associated with [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], who succeeded Hoggart as Director.

Absinthe has played a notable role in the [[fine art]] movements of [[Impressionism]], [[Post-impressionism]], [[Surrealism]], [[Modernism]], [[Cubism]] and in the corresponding literary movements. The legendary drink has more recently appeared in movies, video, television, music, and contemporary literature. The modern absinthe revival has had a notable effect on its portrayal. It is often shown as an unnaturally glowing green liquid demonstrating the influence of contemporary marketing efforts.

Absinthe has a widely documented role in 19th-century visual art and was frequently the subject of many [[Genre works|genre paintings]] and [[still life]]s of the day.

*[[Edgar Degas]]' painting ''[[L'Absinthe]]'' (1876) portrayed grim absinthe drinkers in a cafe. Degas himself never called the painting "L'Absinthe"; it was either his art dealer or a later owner who gave it the name.  Years later, it set off a flurry in the London art world, and the grim realism of "L'Absinthe" (a theme popular with [[bohemian]] artists) was perceived by London art critics as a lesson against alcohol and the French in general. {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}
*[[Paul Gauguin]] is known for consuming large quantities of absinthe,{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} and his bold use of flat color has also been attributed to its influence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/extract/352/12/1275 NEJM - Hideous Absinthe: A History of the Devil in a Bottle&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=November 2009}}

*[[Picasso]] depicted absinthe in various media, including the paintings ''Woman Drinking Absinthe'' (1901), ''Bottle of Pernod and Glass'' (1912), and the sculpture ''Absinthe Glass'' (1914).
*[[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] was notorious for his consumption of the green muse. He often painted impressionistic scenes of the brothels and night spots&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.coloradocollege.edu/publications/thebulletin/spring97/gayle.html |title=Gale Murray and Toulouse-Lautrec |work=Coloradocollege.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529160958/http://www.coloradocollege.edu/Publications/thebulletin/spring97/gayle.html |archivedate=2010-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of 19th-century [[Montmartre]]. Lautrec was even known to carry a hollow cane filled with absinthe during long nights out in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sdmart.org/lautrec/food_bib.html Toulouse-Lautrec: Bibliographies - Food, Drink, Recipes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328084241/http://www.sdmart.org/lautrec/food_bib.html |date=March 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of Lautrec's work featuring absinthe is in the painting ''Monsieur Boileau au café''.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Literature==

===Classic literature===
As prominent as absinthe's influence on visual art was, it is perhaps even more noteworthy in the context of 19th-century literature. Below is a short list of important authors who credited a portion of their literary success to the drink.

*[[Baudelaire]] was an avid absinthe drinker. Though he never wrote specifically about absinthe he did reference it in his famous poem "Get Drunk".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.absintheliquor.com/famous_absinthe_citats.htm Absintheliquor.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Guy de Maupassant]] was a naturalistic French author. He is generally considered one of the greatest French short story writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.online-literature.com/maupassant/ |title=Guy de Maupassant - Biography and Works |work=Online-literature.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one famous work of prose, "A Queer Night in Paris", he describes the smells and sensations of absinthe in the streets of Paris and makes an overt reference to "the hour to take absinthe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.readprint.com/work-1178/Guy-de-Maupassant |title=A Queer Night in Paris by Guy de Maupassant |publisher=Read Print |date= |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ernest Dowson]] was an important English poet who notably wrote a poem dedicated to absinthe called "Absinthia Taetra".
*[[Ernest Hemingway]] features absinthe in the [[short story]] "[[Hills Like White Elephants]]" (1927), and in ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' (1940), disappointed with the quality of other liquor available, Robert Jordan turns to absinthe while fighting with the loyalist guerrillas. Hemingway himself was a frequent absinthe drinker and most likely procured his absinthe from Spain and [[Cuba]] after the ban.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barnaby Conrad III|Conrad III, Barnaby]]; (1988). ''Absinthe History in a Bottle. ''Chronicle books. {{ISBN|0-8118-1650-8}} p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Alfred Jarry]] is notably the author of the French absurdist play, ''Ubu Roi.'' Jarry claimed to use absinthe to "fuse together the dream and reality, art and lifestyle".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The drink was purported by the author to be a key part of his creative process.
*[[Arthur Rimbaud]] was a young Parisian poet who was notably involved in a homosexual relationship with Paul Verlaine; they famously drank large quantities of absinthe together. Their relationship ended when Rimbaud was shot in the hand by Verlaine, who was then sentenced to prison. Later in life Rimbaud quit drinking absinthe and writing poetry and instead became involved in military exploits and [[gun running]]. He is still regarded as one of France's greatest poets.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
*[[Paul Marie Verlaine]] was a famous Parisian poet of the Bohemian style. Though he wrote extensively about the benefits of absinthe in his early years, he later claimed to have consorted with prostitutes and men while drinking it, and blamed the beverage for his downfalls. Even when he was on his deathbed, his friends were said to be hiding bottles for him under his pillow.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zoomgraphics.com/absinthe/drinkers.html |title=Zoomgraphics Absinthe Page |work=Zoomgraphics.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606074910/http://www.zoomgraphics.com/absinthe/drinkers.html |archivedate=2010-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Oscar Wilde]] was an avid absinthe consumer {{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and often wrote about the drink in connection with the creative process.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}  Wilde has been quoted as saying, "What difference is there between a glass of absinthe and a sunset?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxygenee.com/absintheFAQ4.html |title=Oxygénée's Absinthe FAQ IV |work=Oxygenee.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926210034/http://www.oxygenee.com/absintheFAQ4.html |archivedate=2010-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Absinthe History in a bottle" [[Barnaby Conrad III]] (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; and "After the first glass [of absinthe] you see things as you wish they were. After the second, you see things as they are not. Finally, you see things as they really are, and that is the most horrible thing in the world." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.michelleblack.com/books/absinthe.html |title=The Second Glass of Absinthe |publisher=Michelle Black |date= |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary literature ===

*[[Dennis Wheatley]] included an absinthe session in his novel about the outbreak of the [[World War I|Great War]] in 1914, ''The Second Seal'' (1950). Wheatley was a wine merchant for many years, with a wide stock of spirits and liqueurs as well, and always put much information on the subject in his books. His hero the [[Duke de Richleau]] has been sent by British Intelligence on a mission to Vienna. He has to foil a plot by the [[Black Hand (Serbia)|Black Hand]] to disturb the peace of Europe, and so of course must concentrate his thoughts:

&lt;blockquote&gt;  Instinctively he walked back across the Ring to Sachers. There he went up to his room, sat on his bed for a while, then rang for the waiter and ordered a double Absinthe. When it arrived, he added sugar and water and slowly drank the opal fluid. It had no more perceptible kick in it than lime juice, or a diluted [[paregoric]] cough mixture which it resembled in flavour, but he knew it had hidden properties which would act like a drug in clearing and accelerating his brain.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

*An absinthe hallucination may or may not have inspired a murder in ''The Second Glass of Absinthe'' (2003), a mystery novel by [[Michelle Black]], set in 1880 Leadville, Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;Black, Michelle, ''The Second Glass of Absinthe. ''Macmillan. {{ISBN|978-0-7653-4756-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Gemma Doyle, the main character of Libba Bray's 2007 sequel ''[[Rebel Angels (Bray novel)|Rebel Angels]]'' (set in 1895), drinks absinthe with her friends at a Christmas ball and experiences hallucinatory effects.
*The characters in [[Poppy Z. Brite]]'s short story, "His Mouth Will Taste of Wormwood", discover a crate of absinthe, the consumption of which forms the backdrop against which their transgressive antics occur.  The short story can be found in ''[[Swamp Foetus]]''. Characters in her book ''[[Lost Souls (Poppy Z. Brite novel)|Lost Souls]]'' also drink absinthe.&lt;ref name="LadouceurPullin2011"/&gt;
*''The Absinthe Cloud'' (LePage/Dupuy #1, 2012) is a spy thriller by Timothy Everhart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Timothy Everhard|title=The Absinthe Cloud (LePage/Dupuy #1)|id=[[Barnes &amp; Noble|BNID]] [http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/?ean=2940044758377 2940044758377]|publisher=[[Smashwords]]|date=2012-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Absinthe figures heavily into the plot of the novel ''[[The Basic Eight]]'' (1999), by [[Daniel Handler]], which features Bohemian characters who are drawn to absinthe by its dangerous history.&lt;ref&gt;Handler, Daniel; (1999). ''The Basic Eight''. Thomas Dunne Books. {{ISBN|0-312-19833-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[Douglas Preston]] and [[Lincoln Child]] character [[Aloysius Pendergast]] displays an affinity for absinthe in multiple novels.

==Music==
* [[Barbara (singer)|Barbara]] (1930-1997) the popular French female singer wrote and composed, with Frédéric Botton, and sang "l Absinthe", a song published in her 12th album [[:fr:La Fleur d'amour|''La Fleur d'amour'']] (1972). This song is a love song, a bit sad and nostalgic -sadness is Barbara's trademark-, where the singer explains to a lover that drinking absinthe helps, at last to feel in love, to render love joyful, just like it helped Rimbaud and Verlaine to write their poetry (a recurrent comparison, all along the song).
*[[Marilyn Manson]] has been an avid fan of absinthe since the recording of the ''[[Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)]]'' album.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drownedinsound.com/articles/1174198.html "Go green with Marilyn: Drowned In Sound - Thurs 28 Sep 2006 absinthe news article"].

*[[Blood Axis]] and [[Les Joyaux De La Princesse]] released a concept album called ''[[Absinthe: La Folie Verte]]''.
* [[Mayer Hawthorne]] has a song entitled "Green Eyed Love" on his first album ''[[A Strange Arrangement]]''. Although the lyrics of the song seem to reflect on his relationship with a green-eyed girl, the music video&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stereogum.com/archives/video/new_mayer_hawthorne_video__green_eyed_love_095341.html |title=Mayer Hawthorne - Green Eyed Love - Music Video |work=Stereogum.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; puts the lyrics in a different light, where we can see Mayer Hawthorne unconventionally preparing a glass of absinthe and suffering from hallucinations afterwards.
* [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]] recorded a song titled "Absinthe" on their album ''[[Grave Disorder]]'' which was released in 2001. It sampled the line [[Gary Oldman]] spoke in the film ''[[Dracula (1992 film)|Dracula]]'' referring to the green fairy.

The term '''dialect''' (from Latin {{wikt-lang|la|dialectus}}, {{wikt-lang|la|dialectos}}, from the [[Ancient Greek]] word {{wikt-lang|grc|διάλεκτος}}, {{grc-tr|διάλεκτος}}, "discourse", from {{wikt-lang|grc|διά}}, {{grc-tr|διά}}, "through" and {{wikt-lang|grc|λέγω}}, {{grc-tr|λέγω}}, "I speak") is used in two distinct ways to refer to two different types of [[linguistic]] phenomena:

* One usage refers to a [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of a [[language]] that is a characteristic of a particular group of the language's speakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50063104?query_type=word&amp;queryword=dialect&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=tFGd-Bh8USU-18775&amp;hilite=50063104 Oxford English dictionary.] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this definition, the dialects or varieties of a particular language are closely related and, despite their differences, are most often largely [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]], especially if close to one another on the [[dialect continuum]]. The term is applied most often to regional speech patterns, but a dialect may also be defined by other factors, such as [[social class]] or [[ethnicity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/dialect Merriam-Webster Online dictionary.]&lt;/ref&gt; A dialect that is associated with a particular [[social class]] can be termed a [[sociolect]], a dialect that is associated with a particular [[ethnic group]] can be termed as [[ethnolect]], and a regional dialect may be termed a regiolect.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, Walt and Schilling, Natalie. 2016. ''American English: Dialects and Variation.'' West Sussex: John Wiley &amp; Sons, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this definition, any variety of a given language constitutes "a dialect", including any [[standard language|standard varieties]]. In this case, the distinction between the "standard language" (i.e. the "standard" dialect of a particular language) and the "nonstandard" dialects of the same language is often [[arbitrary]] and based on social, political, cultural, or historical considerations.&lt;ref name="chao"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chao|first1=Yuen Ren|title=Language and Symbolic Systems|date=1968|publisher=CUP archive|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Se87AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=language+standard+dialect&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjyutrzrYDOAhWGPj4KHaAZD_IQ6AEIOzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=language%20standard%20dialect&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lyons"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lyons|first1=John|title=Language and Linguistics|date=1981|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Wg57a3DdYYC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=language+standard+dialect&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjyutrzrYDOAhWGPj4KHaAZD_IQ6AEIQTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=language%20standard%20dialect&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="johnson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=David|title=How Myths about Language Affect Education: What Every Teacher Should Know|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nPsVxfVDXp0C&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=language+standard+dialect&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjyutrzrYDOAhWGPj4KHaAZD_IQ6AEIRzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=language%20standard%20dialect&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar way, the definitions of the terms "language" and "dialect" may overlap and are often subject to debate, with the differentiation between the two classifications often grounded in arbitrary and/or sociopolitical motives.&lt;ref name="mcworther"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McWorther|first1=John|title=What's a Language, Anyway?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/01/difference-between-language-dialect/424704/|accessdate=19 July 2016|agency=The Atlantic|date=Jan 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The other usage of the term "dialect", often deployed in [[Colloquialism|colloquial]] settings, refers (often somewhat pejoratively) to a language that is [[Social stratification|socially subordinated]] to a regional or national [[standard language]], often historically [[cognate]] or [[Genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetically related]] to the standard language, but not actually derived ''from'' the standard language. In other words, it is not an actual [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of the "standard language" or dominant language, but rather a separate, independently evolved but often distantly related language.&lt;ref name=maiden&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maiden|first1=Martin|last2=Parry|first2=Mair|title=The Dialects of Italy|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Dz_LyQF_eAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=dialects+of+italy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAWoVChMI47KwhKr1yAIVjD8-Ch3bQQsQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, unlike in the first usage, the standard language would not itself be considered a "dialect", as it is the dominant language in a particular state or region, whether in terms of [[Prestige (linguistics)|linguistic prestige]], social or political status, [[official language|official status]], predominance or prevalence, or all of the above. Meanwhile, under this usage, the "dialects" subordinate to the standard language are generally not variations on the standard language but rather separate (but often loosely related) languages in and of themselves. Thus, these "dialects" are not dialects or varieties of a particular language in the same sense as in the first usage; though they may share roots in the same [[Language family|family]] or subfamily as the standard language and may even, to varying degrees, share some [[mutual intelligibility]] with the standard language, they often did not evolve closely with the standard language or within the same linguistic subgroup or [[speech community]] as the standard language and instead may better fit the criteria of a separate language.

For example, most of the various regional [[Romance language|Romance]] [[languages of Italy]], often colloquially referred to as Italian "dialects", are, in fact, not ''actually'' derived from modern [[standard Italian]], but rather evolved from [[Vulgar Latin]] separately and individually from one another and independently of standard Italian, long prior to the diffusion of a national standardized language throughout what is now [[Italy]]. These various Latin-derived regional languages are, therefore, in a linguistic sense, not truly "dialects" or varieties of the [[standard Italian|standard Italian language]], but are instead better defined as their own separate languages. Conversely, with the spread of standard Italian throughout Italy in the 20th century, regional versions or varieties of standard Italian have developed, generally as a mix of national standard Italian with a [[substratum]] of local regional languages and local accents. While [[dialect levelling|"dialect" levelling]] has increased the number of standard Italian speakers and decreased the number of speakers of other languages native to Italy, Italians in different regions have developed variations of standard Italian particular to their region. These variations on standard Italian, known as [[regional Italian]], would thus more appropriately be called "dialects" in accordance with the first linguistic definition of "dialect", as they are in fact derived partially or mostly from standard Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Loporcaro | first= Michele | year= 2009 | title= Profilo linguistico dei dialetti italiani | location= Bari | publisher= Laterza | ref= harv | language=Italian }}; {{cite book | last= Marcato | first= Carla | year= 2007 | title= Dialetto, dialetti e italiano | location= Bologna | publisher= Il Mulino | ref= harv | language=Italian}}; {{cite book| last= Posner | first= Rebecca | year= 1996 | title= The Romance languages | location= Cambridge | publisher= Cambridge University Press | ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=maiden/&gt;&lt;ref name=repetti&gt;{{cite book|last1=Repetti|first1=Lori|title=Phonological Theory and the Dialects of Italy|date=2000|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z1f5fIrtw58C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=dialects+of+italy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAGoVChMI47KwhKr1yAIVjD8-Ch3bQQsQ#v=onepage&amp;q=dialects%20of%20italy&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A dialect is distinguished by its vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation ([[phonology]], including [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]]). Where a distinction can be made only in terms of pronunciation (including prosody, or just prosody itself), the term ''[[Accent (dialect)|accent]]'' may be preferred over ''dialect''. Other types of speech varieties include [[jargon]]s, which are characterized by differences in [[lexicon]] ([[vocabulary]]); [[slang]]; [[patois]]; [[pidgin]]s; and [[argot]]s. The particular speech patterns used by an individual are termed an [[idiolect]].

==Standard and non-standard dialect==
A ''standard dialect'' (also known as a '''standardized dialect''' or "[[standard language]]") is a dialect that is supported by institutions. Such institutional support may include government recognition or designation; presentation as being the "correct" form of a language in schools; published grammars, dictionaries, and textbooks that set forth a correct spoken and written form; and an extensive formal literature that employs that dialect (prose, poetry, non-fiction, etc.). There may be multiple standard dialects associated with a single language. For example, Standard [[American English]], Standard [[British English]], Standard [[Canadian English]], Standard [[Indian English]], Standard [[Australian English]], and Standard [[Philippine English]] may all be said to be standard dialects of the [[English language]].

A [[nonstandard dialect]], like a standard dialect, has a complete vocabulary, grammar, and [[Syntax|syntax]], but is usually not the beneficiary of institutional support. Examples of a nonstandard English dialect are [[Southern American English]], [[Western Australian English]], [[New York English]], [[New England English]], [[Mid-Atlantic American English| Mid-Atlantic American]] or [[Philadelphia English|Philadelphia]] / [[Baltimorese|Baltimore]] English, [[Scouse]], [[Brummie]], [[Cockney accent|Cockney]], and [[Yorkshire dialect|Tyke]]. The [[Dialect Test]] was designed by [[Joseph Wright (linguist)|Joseph Wright]] to compare different English dialects with each other.

== Dialect or language ==
{{see also|Abstand and ausbau languages|A language is a dialect with an army and navy}}
There is no universally accepted criterion for distinguishing two different languages from two dialects (i.e. varieties) of the same language.&lt;ref&gt;Cysouw, Michael; Good, Jeff. (2013). "Languoid, Doculect, and Glossonym: Formalizing the Notion 'Language'." ''Language Documentation and Conservation''. 7. 331–359. {{hdl|10125/4606}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of rough measures exist, sometimes leading to contradictory results. The distinction is therefore subjective and depends upon the user's frame of reference. For example, there has been discussion about whether or not the [[Limón Creole English]] should be considered "a kind" of English or a different language. This creole is spoken in the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica (Central America) by descendants of Jamaican people. The position that Costa Rican linguists support depends upon which University they represent.

The most common, and most purely linguistic, criterion is that of [[mutual intelligibility]]: two varieties are said to be dialects of the same language if being a speaker of one variety confers sufficient knowledge to understand and be understood by a speaker of the other; otherwise, they are said to be different languages. However, this definition becomes problematic in the case of [[dialect continuum|dialect continua]], in which it may be the case that dialect B is mutually intelligible with both dialect A and dialect C but dialects A and C are not mutually intelligible with each other. In this case, the criterion of mutual intelligibility makes it impossible to decide whether A and C are dialects of the same language or not. The mutual intelligibility criterion also flounders in cases in which a speaker of dialect X can understand a speaker of dialect Y, but not vice versa.

=== Sociolinguistic definitions ===
[[File:West Germanic dialect diagram.svg|thumb|right|upright=2|Local varieties in the West Germanic dialect continuum are oriented towards either Standard Dutch or Standard German depending on which side of the border they are spoken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = 978-0-521-59646-6
  | page = 10
  | ref = harv
}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Another occasionally used criterion for discriminating dialects from languages is the [[sociolinguistic]] notion of [[autonomy and heteronomy (sociolinguistics)|linguistic authority]]. According to this definition, two varieties are considered dialects of the same language if (under at least some circumstances) they would defer to the same authority regarding some questions about their language. For instance, to learn the name of a new invention, or an obscure foreign species of plant, speakers of [[Westphalian language|Westphalian]] and [[East Franconian German]] might each consult a German dictionary or ask a German-speaking expert in the subject.
Thus these varieties are said to be dependent on, or [[autonomy and heteronomy (sociolinguistics)|heteronomous]] with respect to, [[Standard German]], which is said to be autonomous.
In contrast, speakers in the Netherlands of [[Dutch Low Saxon|Low Saxon]] varieties similar to Westphalian would instead consult a dictionary of [[Standard Dutch]].
Similarly, although Yiddish is classified by linguists as a language in the [[Middle High German]] group of languages, a Yiddish speaker would consult a different dictionary in such a case.

Within this framework, [[William Alexander Stewart|W. A. Stewart]] defined a ''language'' as an autonomous variety together with all the varieties that are heteronomous with respect to it, noting that an essentially equivalent definition had been stated by [[Charles A. Ferguson]] and [[John J. Gumperz]] in 1960.&lt;ref name="Stewart"&gt;{{cite book

}} p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, a heteronomous variety may be considered a ''dialect'' of a language defined in this way.&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt;
In these terms, [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], though mutually intelligible to a large degree, are considered separate languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chambers|Trudgill|1998|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the framework of [[Heinz Kloss]], these are described as languages by ''[[abstand and ausbau languages|ausbau]]'' (development) rather than by ''abstand'' (separation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  | journal = Anthropological Linguistics | volume = 9 | number = 7
  | year = 1967 | pages = 29–41
  | jstor = 30029461
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dialect and language clusters ===

In other situations, a closely related group of varieties possess considerable (though incomplete) mutual intelligibility, but none dominates the others.
To describe this situation, the editors of the ''Handbook of African Languages'' introduced the term ''dialect cluster''.
Dialect clusters were treated as classificatory units at the same level as languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  | title = A Handbook of African Languages
  | author = Handbook Sub-committee Committee of the International African Institute.
  | journal = Africa | volume = 16 | number = 3 | year = 1946 | pages = 156–159
  | jstor = 1156320
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A similar situation, but with a greater degree of mutual unintelligibility, has been termed a ''language cluster''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  | given2 = John | surname2 = Bendor-Samuel

  | journal = Savanna | volume = 5 | number = 2 | year = 1976 | pages = 115–124
}} p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political factors ===

In many societies, however, a particular dialect, often the sociolect of the [[elite]] class, comes to be identified as the "standard" or "proper" version of a language by those seeking to make a social distinction and is contrasted with other varieties. As a result of this, in some contexts, the term "dialect" refers specifically to varieties with low [[social status]]. In this secondary sense of "dialect", language varieties are often called ''dialects'' rather than ''languages'':
* if they have no standard or [[Codification (linguistics)|codified]] form,
* if they are rarely or never used in writing (outside reported speech),
* if the speakers of the given language do not have a [[State (polity)|state]] of their own,
* if they lack [[prestige dialect|prestige]] with respect to some other, often standardised, variety.

The status of "language" is not solely determined by linguistic criteria, but it is also the result of a historical and political development. [[Romansh language|Romansh]] came to be a written language, and therefore it is recognized as a language, even though it is very close to the Lombardic alpine dialects. An opposite example is the case of [[Chinese language|Chinese]], whose variations such as [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]] are often called dialects and not languages in China, despite their mutual unintelligibility.

Modern [[nationalism]], as developed especially since the [[French Revolution]], has made the distinction between "language" and "dialect" an issue of great political importance. A group speaking a separate "language" is often seen as having a greater claim to being a separate "people", and thus to be more deserving of its own independent state, while a group speaking a "dialect" tends to be seen not as "a people" in its own right, but as a sub-group, part of a bigger people, which must content itself with regional autonomy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The distinction between language and dialect is thus inevitably made at least as much on a political basis as on a linguistic one, and can lead to great political controversy or even armed conflict.

The [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] linguist [[Max Weinreich]] published the expression, ''A shprakh iz a dialekt mit an armey un flot'' ({{rtl-lang|yi|"אַ שפּראַך איז אַ דיאַלעקט מיט אַן אַרמײ און פֿלאָט"}}: "[[A language is a dialect with an army and navy]]") in ''YIVO Bleter'' 25.1, 1945, p.&amp;nbsp;13. The significance of the political factors in any attempt at answering the question "what is a language?" is great enough to cast doubt on whether any strictly linguistic definition, without a socio-cultural approach, is possible. This is illustrated by the frequency with which the army-navy aphorism is cited.

==={{anchor|languoid}}Terminology ===

By the definition most commonly used by linguists, any linguistic variety can be considered a "dialect" of ''some'' language—"everybody speaks a dialect". According to that interpretation, the criteria above merely serve to distinguish whether two varieties are dialects of the ''same'' language or dialects of ''different'' languages.

The terms "language" and "dialect" are not necessarily mutually exclusive, although it is often perceived to be.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Thus there is nothing contradictory in the statement "the ''language'' of the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] is a dialect of [[German (language)|German]]".

There are various terms that linguists may use to avoid taking a position on whether the speech of a community is an independent language in its own right or a dialect of another language. Perhaps the most common is "[[variety (linguistics)|variety]]";&lt;ref name=finegan&gt;{{cite book |title=Language: Its Structure and Use|edition=5th |last=Finegan |first=Edward |year=2007 |publisher= Thomson Wadsworth|location=Boston, MA, USA|isbn=978-1-4130-3055-6 |page=348}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "[[lect]]" is another.  A more general term is "languoid", which does not distinguish between dialects, languages, and groups of languages, whether genealogically related or not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glottopedia.org/index.php/Languoid "Languoid"] at ''Glottopedia.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

{{see also|Mesoamerican languages#Language vs. dialect|l1=Mesoamerican languages § Language vs. dialect}}

=== German ===
When talking about the German language, the term [[German dialects]] is only used for the traditional regional varieties. That allows them to be distinguished from the regional varieties of modern standard German.

The German dialects show a wide spectrum of variation. Some of them are not mutually intelligible. [[German dialectology]] traditionally names the major dialect groups after [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] from which they were assumed to have descended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cutewriters.com/german-language-dialect-variations/|title=From dialect to variation space|last=Danvas|first=Kegesa|date=2016|website=Cutewriters|publisher=Cutewriters Inc.|access-date=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent to which the dialects are spoken varies according to a number of factors: In Northern Germany, dialects are less common than in the South. In cities, dialects are less common than in the countryside. In a public environment, dialects are less common than in a familiar environment.

The situation in [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]] is different from the rest of the German-speaking countries. The [[Swiss German]] dialects are the default everyday language in virtually every situation, whereas standard German is only spoken in education, partially in media, and with foreigners not possessing knowledge of Swiss German. Most Swiss German speakers perceive standard German to be a foreign language.

The [[Low German]] varieties spoken in Germany are often counted among the German dialects. This reflects the modern situation where they are [[Dachsprache|roofed]] by standard German. This is different from the situation in the [[Middle Ages]] when Low German had strong tendencies towards an [[ausbau language]].

The [[Frisian languages]] spoken in Germany are excluded from the German dialects.

===Italian===
{{See also|Languages of Italy|Regional Italian}}
Italy is home to a vast array of [[Languages of Italy|native regional minority languages]], most of which are [[Romance language|Romance]]-based and have their own local variants. These [[regional language]]s are often referred to colloquially or in non-linguistic circles as Italian "dialects", or ''dialetti'' (standard Italian for "dialects"). However, the majority of the regional languages in Italy are in fact not actually "dialects" of [[standard Italian]] in the strict linguistic sense, as they are not derived from modern [[standard Italian]] but instead evolved locally from [[Vulgar Latin]] independent of standard Italian, with little to no influence from what is now known as "standard Italian." They are therefore better classified as individual languages rather than "dialects."

In addition to having evolved, for the most part, separately from one another and with distinct individual histories, the [[Latin]]-based regional Romance languages of Italy are also better classified as separate languages rather than true "dialects" due to the often high degree in which they lack [[mutual intelligibility]]. Though mostly mutually unintelligible, the exact degree to which the regional Italian languages are mutually unintelligible varies, often correlating with geographical distance or geographical barriers between the languages, with some regional Italian languages that are closer in geographical proximity to each other or closer to each other on the [[dialect continuum]] being more or less mutually intelligible. For instance, a speaker of purely [[Eastern Lombard dialect|Eastern Lombard]], a language in [[Northern Italy]]'s [[Lombardy|Lombardy region]] that includes the [[Bergamasque dialect]], would have severely limited mutual intelligibility with a purely [[standard Italian]] speaker and would be nearly completely unintelligible to a speaker of a pure [[Sicilian language]] variant. Due to Eastern Lombard's status as a [[Gallo-Italic]] language, an Eastern Lombard speaker may, in fact, have more mutual intelligibility with a [[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], or [[French language|French]] speaker than with a standard Italian or Sicilian language speaker. Meanwhile, a Sicilian language speaker would have a greater degree of mutual intelligibility with a speaker of the more closely related [[Neapolitan language]], but far less mutual intelligibility with a person speaking [[Gallo-Italic of Sicily|Sicilian Gallo-Italic]], a language that developed in isolated Lombard emigrant communities on the [[Sicily|same island]] as the Sicilian language.

Modern standard Italian itself is heavily based on the Latin-derived [[Florentine dialect|Florentine]] [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan language]]. The Tuscan-based language that would eventually become modern standard Italian had been used in poetry and literature since at least the [[12th century]], and it first spread throughout Italy among the educated upper class through the works of authors such as [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], and [[Petrarch]]. Dante's Florentine-Tuscan literary Italian thus slowly became the language of the [[literate]] and [[upper class]] in Italy, and it spread throughout the peninsula as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' among the Italian [[educated]] class as well as Italian traveling merchants. The economic prowess and cultural and artistic importance of [[Tuscany]] in the [[Late Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]] further encouraged the diffusion of the Florentine-Tuscan Italian throughout Italy and among the educated and powerful, though local and regional languages remained the main languages of the common people.

During the [[Risorgimento]], proponents of Italian republicanism and Italian nationalism, such as [[Alessandro Manzoni]], stressed the importance of establishing a uniform [[national language]] in order to better create an Italian [[national identity]]. With the [[unification of Italy]] in the 1860s, standard Italian became the official national language of the new Italian state, while the various unofficial regional languages of Italy gradually became regarded as subordinate "dialects" to Italian, increasingly associated negatively with lack of education or provincialism. However, at the time of the Italian Unification, standard Italian still existed mainly as a literary language, and only 2.5% of Italy's population could speak standard Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ita |title=Lewis, M. Paul (ed.), 2009. Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Sixteenth edition |publisher=Ethnologue.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, the vast [[conscription]] of Italian men from all throughout Italy during [[World War I]] is credited with facilitating the diffusion of standard Italian among less educated Italian men, as these men from various regions with various regional languages were forced to communicate with each other in a common tongue while serving in the Italian military. With the eventual spread of the radio and television throughout Italy and the establishment of [[public education]], Italians from all regions were increasingly exposed to standard Italian, while literacy rates among all social classes improved. Today, the majority of Italians are able to speak standard Italian, though many Italians still speak their regional language regularly or as their primary day-to-day language, especially at home with family or when communicating with Italians from the same town or region. However, to some Italians, speaking a regional language, especially in a formal setting or outside of one's region, may carry a stigma or negative connotations associated with being lower class, uneducated, boorish, or overly informal.

Italians in different regions today may also speak regional varieties of standard Italian, or [[regional Italian|regional Italian dialects]], which, unlike the majority of [[languages of Italy]], are actually dialects of standard Italian rather than separate languages. A regional Italian dialect is generally standard Italian that has been heavily influenced or mixed with local or regional native languages and accents.

The languages of Italy are primarily [[Latin]]-based [[Romance languages]], with the most widely spoken languages falling within the [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian language]] family. This wide category includes:
*Standard Italian and [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]]; 
*the various related [[Central Italian]] dialects, such as [[Romanesco dialect|Romanesco]] in [[Rome]];
*the [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] group (also known as "Southern Italian"), which encompasses not only [[Naples]]' and [[Campania]]'s speech but also a variety of related neighboring varieties like the [[Irpinian dialect]], [[Abruzzo|Abruzzese]] and Southern [[Marche]]giano, [[Molisan]], [[Calabrian language#Northern Calabrian (Cosentino)|Northern Calabrian or Cosentino]], and the [[Bari dialect]]. The [[Cilentan dialect]] of [[Salerno]], in [[Campania]], is considered significantly influenced by the Neapolitan and the below-mentioned language groups;
*the [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] group, including [[Salentino dialect|Salentino]] and [[Calabrian languages|Calabrian]].

Aside from the more common [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian]] [[Romance language]]s in Italy, other native languages in Italy include: 
*a variety of [[Gallo-Italic languages]], [[Gallo-Rhaetian languages]], [[Rhaeto-Romance languages]], and [[Ibero-Romance languages]] (such as [[Emilian-Romagnol language|Emilian-Romagnol]], [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]], [[Friulian]], the [[Lombard language]]s, [[Gallo-Italic of Sicily|Sicilian Gallo-Italic]], [[Algherese dialect|Algherese]], the [[Vivaro-Alpine dialect]], [[Ladin language|Ladin]], etc.); 
*[[Germanic language|Germanic]] languages, such as the [[Cimbrian language]]s, [[Southern Bavarian]], [[Walser German]] and the [[Mòcheno language]];
*the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] [[Arbëresh language]]; 
*the [[Hellenic language|Hellenic]] [[Griko language]] and [[Calabrian Greek]];
*the [[Serbo-Croatian]] [[Slavomolisano dialect]];
*various [[Slovene language]]s, including the [[Gail Valley dialect]] and [[Istrian dialect]].

The [[Sardinian language]] is considered to be its own Romance language family, separate not only from Italian and the wider Italo-Dalmatian family but from all the other Neo-Latin families; it is often subdivided into the [[Campidanese Sardinian|Campidanese]] and [[Logudorese dialect|Logudorese]] dialects. The [[Corsican language|Corsican]]-related [[Gallurese dialect|Gallurese]] and [[Sassarese language|Sassarese]] which are also spoken in [[Sardinia]], on the other hand, are often considered closely related to or derived from [[Tuscan language|Tuscan]] and are therefore fully part of the Italo-Dalmatian languages. Furthermore, the [[Gallo-Romance]] language of [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]] and the [[Catalan language|Catalan]] [[Algherese dialect]] are also spoken in Sardinia, respectively in [[Carloforte]]/[[Calasetta]] and [[Alghero]].

=== The Balkans ===
The classification of speech varieties as dialects or languages and their relationship to other varieties of speech can be controversial and the verdicts inconsistent. English and [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] illustrate the point. English and Serbo-Croatian each have two major variants ([[British English|British]] and [[American English]], and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]], respectively), along with numerous other varieties. For political reasons, analyzing these varieties as "languages" or "dialects" yields inconsistent results: British and American English, spoken by close political and military allies, are almost universally regarded as varieties of a single language, whereas the national standards of [[Serbia]] and [[Croatia]], which are closer to each other than some local vernacular dialects of [[Serbo-Croatian]] are to themselves, differing to a similar extent as the formal varieties of English, are treated by some linguists from the region as distinct languages, largely because the two countries oscillate from being brotherly to being bitter enemies. (The [[Serbo-Croatian|Serbo-Croatian language article]] deals with this topic much more fully.)

Similar examples abound. [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], although largely mutually intelligible with [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], certain dialects of Serbo-Croatian and to a lesser extent the rest of the [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] [[dialect continuum]], is considered by Bulgarian linguists to be a Bulgarian dialect, in contrast with the contemporary international view and the view in the [[Republic of Macedonia]], which regards it as a language in its own right. Nevertheless, before the establishment of a literary standard of Macedonian in 1944, in most sources in and out of Bulgaria before the Second World War, the southern Slavonic dialect continuum covering the area of today's Republic of Macedonia were referred to as Bulgarian dialects.

===Lebanon===
In [[Lebanon]], a part of the Christian population considers "[[Lebanese language|Lebanese]]" to be in some sense a distinct language from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and not merely a dialect. During the civil war Christians often used Lebanese Arabic officially, and sporadically used the [[Latin script]] to write Lebanese, thus further distinguishing it from Arabic. All Lebanese laws are written in the standard literary form of Arabic, though parliamentary debate may be conducted in Lebanese Arabic.

===North Africa===
In Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco, the [[Darija]]s (spoken North African languages) are sometimes considered more different from other Arabic dialects. Officially, North African countries prefer to give preference to the [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]] and conduct much of their political and religious life in it (adherence to [[Islam]]), and refrain from declaring each country's specific variety to be a separate language, because Literary Arabic is the [[liturgical language]] of Islam and the language of the Islamic sacred book, the [[Qur'an]]. Although, especially since the 1960s, the Darijas are occupying an increasing use and influence in the cultural life of these countries. Examples of cultural elements where Darijas' use became dominant include: theatre, film, music, television, advertisement, social media, folk-tale books and companies' names.

===Ukraine===
The [[Modern Ukrainian language]] has been in common use since the late 17th century, associated with the establishment of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]]. In the 19th century, the [[Tsar]]ist Government of the [[Russian Empire]] claimed that [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] was merely a dialect of [[Russian language|Russian]] and not a language on its own. According to these claims, the differences were few and caused by the conquest of western Ukraine by the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. However, in reality the dialects in Ukraine were developing independently from the dialects in the modern Russia for several centuries, and as a result they differed substantially.

Following the signing of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Ukraine–Central Powers)|Brest-Litovsk Treaty]], the [[German Empire]] briefly [[Ukraine during World War I|gained control over Ukraine]] during [[World War I]], but was eventually defeated by the [[Triple Entente|Entente]], with major involvement by the Ukrainian Bolsheviks. After Bolsheviks managed to conquer the rest of Ukraine from the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] and the [[White movement|Whites]], Ukraine became part of the USSR, whence a process of Ukrainization was begun, with encouragement from Moscow. However, in the late 1920s - early 1930s, the process started to reverse. Witnessing the Ukrainian cultural revival spurred by the ukrainization in the early 1290s, and fearing that it might lead to an independence movement, Moscow started to remove from power and in some cases [[Executed Renaissance|physically eliminate the public proponents]] of ukrainization. The appointment of [[Pavel Postyshev]] as the secretary of the [[Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union)|Communist Party of Ukraine]] marked the end of ukrainization, and the opposite process of russification started. After World War II, citing [[Ukrainian collaboration with Nazi Germany]] in an attempt to gain independence as the reason, Moscow changed its policy towards repression of the Ukrainian language.

Today the boundaries of the Ukrainian language to the Russian language are still not drawn clearly, with an intermediate dialect between them, called [[Surzhyk]], developing in Ukraine.

===Moldova===
There have been cases of a variety of speech being deliberately reclassified to serve political purposes. One example is [[Moldovan language|Moldovan]]. In 1996, the Moldovan parliament, citing fears of "Romanian expansionism", rejected a proposal from [[President of Moldova|President]] [[Mircea Snegur]] to change the name of the language to Romanian, and in 2003 a [[Moldovan–Romanian dictionary]] was published, purporting to show that the two countries speak different languages. Linguists of the [[Romanian Academy]] reacted by declaring that all the Moldovan words were also Romanian words; while in Moldova, the head of the [[Academy of Sciences of Moldova]], Ion Bărbuţă, described the dictionary as a politically motivated "absurdity".

===Greater China===
{{Main|Varieties of Chinese#Classification}}
Unlike languages that use alphabets to indicate their pronunciation, [[Chinese characters]] have developed from [[logograms]] that do not always give hints to their pronunciation. Although the written characters have remained relatively consistent for the last two thousand years, the pronunciation and grammar in different regions have developed to an extent that the [[Varieties of Chinese|varieties of the spoken language]] are often mutually unintelligible. As a series of migration to the south throughout the history, the regional languages of the south, including [[Gan Chinese|Gan]], [[Xiang Chinese|Xiang]], [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], [[Min Chinese|Min]], [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] and [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] often show traces of [[Old Chinese]] or [[Middle Chinese]]. From the [[Ming dynasty]] onward, Beijing has been the capital of China and the dialect spoken in Beijing has had the most prestige among other varieties. With the founding of the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]], [[Standard Mandarin]] was designated as the official language, based on the spoken language of Beijing. Since then, other spoken varieties are regarded as ''fangyan'' (regional speech). [[Cantonese]] is still the most commonly-used language in [[Guangzhou]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] and among some overseas Chinese communities, whereas [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Hokkien]] has been accepted in [[Taiwan]] as an important local language alongside [[Taiwanese Mandarin|Mandarin]].

{{Main|Interlingua}}

One language, [[Interlingua]], was [[Interlingua and eligibility of international words|developed]] so that the languages of Western civilization would act as its dialects.&lt;ref name="coljld"&gt;[[Alice Vanderbilt Morris|Morris, Alice Vanderbilt]], [http://www.interlingua.fi/ialagr45.htm#manyrepresented General report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060814204450/http://www.interlingua.fi/ialagr45.htm |date=2006-08-14 }}. New York: International Auxiliary Language Association, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing from such concepts as the [[international scientific vocabulary]] and [[Standard Average European]], linguists{{who|date=July 2013}} developed a theory that the modern Western languages were actually dialects of a hidden or latent language.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Researchers at the [[International Auxiliary Language Association]] extracted words and affixes that they considered to be part of Interlingua's vocabulary.&lt;ref name = "jawmqc"&gt;[[Alexander Gode|Gode, Alexander]], ''[[Interlingua-English Dictionary]]''. New York: Storm Publishers, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, speakers of the Western languages would understand written or spoken Interlingua immediately, without prior study, since their own languages were its dialects.&lt;ref name = "coljld"/&gt; This has often turned out to be true, especially, but not solely, for speakers of the Romance languages and educated speakers of English. Interlingua has also been found to assist in the learning of other languages. In one study, Swedish high school students learning Interlingua were able to translate passages from Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian that students of those languages found too difficult to understand.&lt;ref&gt;Gopsill, F. P., ''International languages: A matter for Interlingua''. Sheffield: British Interlingua Society, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted, however, that the vocabulary of Interlingua extends beyond the Western language families.&lt;ref name = "jawmqc"/&gt;

[[File:Modern Asia (1796).tif|thumb|upright=1.3|The Eastern world in a 1796 map, which included the continents of Asia and [[Australia (continent)|Australia]] (then known as [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]).]]
The term '''Eastern world''' refers to various [[culture]]s or [[society|social structures]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] systems depending on the context, most often including at least part of [[Asia]] or geographically the countries and cultures east of Europe, the Mediterranean Region and [[Arab world]], specifically in historical ([[pre-modern]]) contexts, and in modern times in the context of [[Orientalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William | authorlink = |author2=Joseph Hickey | year = 2005 | title = Society in Focus | publisher = Pearson|location = Boston, MA| id = 0-205-41365-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term is usually not used by people in this region itself, since this Eastern world is a varied, complex and dynamic region, hard to generalize, and although these countries and regions have many common threads running through them, historically they never needed to define themselves collectively against another entity, real or superficial.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Sandra S. Mouth, Joanna.  Barbara, Koening A. The Meanings of Race in the New Genomics: Implications for Health Disparities Research. Yale University. 2001. October 26, 2006.

The term originally had a literal geographic meaning, referring to the eastern part of the [[Old World]], contrasting the cultures and civilizations of Asia with those of Europe (the ''[[Occident]]'' or [[Western world]]). Traditionally, this includes all of [[Central Asia|Central]], [[North Asia|North]] and [[East Asia]] (the [[Far East]]), [[Greater Middle East]], [[Southeast Asia]] and [[South Asia]] (the [[Indian subcontinent]]). 

Conceptually, the boundary between east and west is cultural, rather than geographical, as a result of which [[Australia]] is typically grouped in the

Another reason why a [[Pan-Asianism|Pan-Asian]] identity is a flawed work in progress concept compared to the mass unity found in the continents of Europe and Africa is the fact that Asia is the most racially and ethnically diverse continent in the world&lt;ref&gt;Cartmill, M. (1999). The Status of the Race Concept in Physical Anthropology. American Anthropologist 100(3)651 -660.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, "Asian and Indian people" are referred to in the New Zealand Heart Foundation's [http://www.pickthetick.org.nz/bmi/ BMI calculator] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531222922/http://www.pickthetick.org.nz/bmi/ |date=2009-05-31 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; that differs very widely among and within its regions with many different cultures, environments, economics, historical ties and government systems whose people have an even further pan-continental belief of [[Nationalism|nationalistic]], cultural, and [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnic individualism]] many of whom believe came out of the imperialistic colonization of the continent by foreign Western powers back in [[colonialism|colonial times]] and because of this overt sense individualism across the continent once a specific group(s) is labeled something many groups within Asia will have a hard time identifying with the same label. Most of the people of Asia prefer to identify with their individual nations rather than with their continent, region, or each other and these attitudes can be found throughout the continent.

The division between 'East' and 'West' is a product of European cultural history, and of the distinction between European [[Christendom]] and the cultures beyond it to the East. With the [[European colonization of the Americas]] the East/West distinction became global. The concept of an Eastern, "Indian" ([[Indies]]) or "[[Oriental]]" sphere was emphasized by ideas of racial as well as religious and cultural differences. Such distinctions were articulated by Westerners in the scholarly tradition known as Orientalism and [[Indology]]. An intriguing fact to be noted is that [[Orientalism]] has been the only Western concept that was about a unified Eastern world and not about any specific region(s), but rather all of Asia together.&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;from the Latin ''oriens''; ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European concepts ===
During the [[Cold War]], the term "Eastern world" was sometimes used as an extension of [[Eastern bloc]], connoting the [[Soviet Union]], [[China]] and their [[communist]] allies, while the term "Western world" often connoted the [[United States]] and its [[NATO]] allies such as the [[United Kingdom]].

The concept is often another term for the [[Far East]] – a region that bears considerable cultural and religious commonality. Eastern philosophy, art, literature, and other traditions, are often found throughout the region in places of high importance, such as popular culture, architecture and traditional literature. The spread of [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Yoga]] is partly responsible for this.

Eastern culture has developed many themes and traditions. Some important ones are:

* [[Abrahamic religions]] (a.k.a. [[Abrahamic religions|West Asian religions]]) 
** [[Christianity]] — the majority of the modern world adheres to this faith although it isn't widely practiced in its native continent of Asia anymore and since the faith had spread to the [[Western World]] the notion of "Europe" and the "Western World" has been intimately connected with the concept of "[[Christendom|Christianity and Christendom]]" many even attribute Christianity for being the link that created a unified European identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawson|first=Christopher|title=Crisis in Western Education|year=1961|isbn=9780813216836|edition=reprint|author2=Glenn Olsen|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, vibrant indigenous minorities in the [[Levant]] have preserved their ancient beliefs, adhering to [[Syriac Christianity]] (i.e. [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] and [[Maronite people]]), an [[Eastern Christian]] sect.
** [[Islam]] — the majority of the world [[Muslim]] population have always lived in Asia, due to Islam spreading and becoming the dominant religion of these areas.
** [[Judaism]] — the national religion of the [[Israelites]]/[[Hebrews]] of the [[Fertile Crescent]], or what is now [[Israel]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Jordan]], [[Syria]], and [[Lebanon]]. They eventually evolved into the [[Jews]] (particularly [[Ashkenazi]], [[Sephardic]], [[Mizrahi]]) and [[Samaritans]] of today.
* [[Zoroastrianism]] — the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[state religion]] of [[Sassanid Persia|Sassanid Iran]]
* [[Eastern religions]] / [[Eastern philosophy]]
** [[Indian religions]]
*** [[Buddhism]] — the path of liberation attained through insight into the ultimate nature of reality.
*** [[Hinduism]] 
*** [[Jainism]]
*** [[Sikhism]] — a religion that developed in the warring plains of [[Punjab region|Punjab]] in an atmosphere of ideological clash between [[Islam]] and [[Hinduism]]. Its followers retain spiritual as well as martial qualities.
** [[East Asian religions|Taoic religions]] (a.k.a. [[East Asian religions]] or [[East Asian religions|Far Eastern religions]])
*** [[Chinese folk religion]]
*** [[Confucianism]] — the belief that human beings are teachable, improvable and perfectible through personal and communal endeavour especially including self-cultivation and self-creation.

Umar is the child of Turkish parents who came to the Netherlands in 1970.

The '''Ennead''' or '''Great Ennead''' was a group of nine [[Egyptian pantheon|deities]] in [[Egyptian mythology]] worshiped at [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]]: the [[sun god]] [[Atum]]; his children [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]] and [[Tefnut]]; their children [[Geb]] and [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]]; and their children [[Osiris]], [[Isis]], [[Seth (mythology)|Seth]], and [[Nephthys]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/937102309|title=Gods and men in Egypt : 3000 BCE to 395 CE|last=Dunand|first=Françoise|last2=Zivie-Coche|first2=Christiane|authorlink=Françoise Dunand|location=Ithaca, NY|year=2004|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0801488532|oclc=937102309}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ennead sometimes includes the son of Osiris and Isis, [[Horus]]. It rose to importance in [[Dynasty V|Dynasties V]] and [[Dynasty VI|VI]] and remained prominent in Egypt into its [[Ptolemaic Egypt|occupation]] by the [[ancient Macedonia|Macedonian]] [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] established by [[Alexander the Great]]'s [[diadochi|successor]] in the area, [[Ptolemy I]].

The Great Ennead was only one of several such groupings of nine deities in ancient Egypt and its claims to preeminence by its Heliopolitan priests were not respected throughout Egypt.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Creation Accounts in the Ancient Near East|last=Clifford|first=Richard|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=99-116}}&lt;/ref&gt; As close as [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] (also within modern [[Cairo]]), the priests of [[Ptah]] celebrated him as superior to the Nine.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition to Memphis having its own creation myth, the [[Ogdoad (Egyptian)|Ogdoad]]/Hermopolitan centered around physical creation and 8 primordial gods was another creation story that existed at the same time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Ennead is a borrowing via [[Latin]] of the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] name ''Enneás'' ({{lang|grc|Ἐννεάς}}), meaning "the Nine".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution=ennead, ''n.'' |title=Oxford English Dictionary |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |contribution-url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/62478 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was a [[calque]] of the Egyptian name, written ''{{lang|egy|Psḏt}}'' and also meaning "the Nine". Its original pronunciation is uncertain, since hieroglyphs do not record vowels. [[Egyptologist]]s conventionally transcribe it as ''Pesedjet''.

==History==
The [[ancient Egyptians]] created several enneads as their [[unification of Egypt|unification]] under [[Dynasty I]] brought numerous local cults into contact with one another. The ancient Egyptian mythology often had many different explanations for the same phenomenon. This concept is especially unique because no single story was more accurate than another, but rather the truth was a mix of them all&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. The [[Pyramid Texts]] of [[Dynasty V|Dynasties V]] and [[Dynasty VI|VI]] mention the "Great Ennead", the "Lesser Ennead", the "Dual Ennead", and the "Seven Enneads". Some [[pharaoh]]s established enneads that [[apotheosis|incorporated themselves as gods]]. The most notable case is [[Seti I]] of [[Dynasty XIX]], whose temple at [[Redesiyah]] celebrated an ennead of six major gods and three deified forms of himself. In the [[Calendar of Lucky and Unlucky Days]],&lt;ref&gt;Papyrus Cairo 86637.&lt;/ref&gt; the ennead mentioned may reference the [[Pleiades]].{{sfnp|Jetsu &amp; al.|2015}}

The most important was the "Great" or "Heliopolitan Ennead" of Awanu ({{lang-egy|I͗wnw}}), known under the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Greeks]] and [[Roman Egypt|Romans]] as [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]]. It celebrated the family of the [[sun god]] [[Atum]] (sometimes referred to as Atum-[[Atum-re|Re]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;) and thrived from the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] to the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic period]].

Its development remains uncertain, although it appears to have first appeared when [[Ra (god)|Ra]]'s cult—supreme under [[Dynasty V]]—declined in importance under [[Dynasty VI]]. [[Egyptologist]]s have traditionally theorized that the Heliopolitan priesthood established it to establish the preeminence of Atum over the others, incorporating some major gods in lesser positions and omitting others entirely. The most prominent of such deities was [[Osiris]], [[vegetation deity|god of vegetation]] and the [[Egyptian netherworld|afterlife]], who was incorporated into the Ennead as Atum's great-grandson. However, in the 20th century, some Egyptologists{{Who|date=December 2009}} question the whole scenario. After the Great Ennead was well established, the cult of Ra—[[syncretization|identified with]] Atum—recovered much of its importance until superseded by the cult of [[Horus (god)|Horus]]. The two were then combined as Ra–Horus of the Horizons.

{{anchor|Legend|Legends|Myth}}

==Myths==
According to the [[creation story]] of the Heliopolitan priests, the world originally consisted of the primordial waters of precreation personified as [[Naunet|Nun]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; From it arose a mound on the First Occasion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Upon the mound sat the self-begotten god [[Atum]], who was equated with the [[sun god]] [[Ra (god)|Ra]]. [[Atum]] evolved from Nun through self-creation&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Atum either [[spitting|spat]] or [[masturbation|masturbated]], producing [[Air (classical element)|air]] personified as [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]] and [[humidity|moisture]] personified as [[Tefnut]]. The siblings Shu and Tefnut mated to produce the earth personified as [[Geb]] and the nighttime sky personified as [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]].

Geb and Nut were the parents of [[Osiris (god)|Osiris]] and [[Isis (goddess)|Isis]] and of [[Set (god)|Set]] and [[Nephthys]], who became respective couples in turn. Osiris and Isis represent fertility and order, while Set and Nephthys represent chaos to balance out Osiris and Isis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Horus]], the son of Osiris and Isis, is often included in this creation tradition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to the duality of Ancient Egyptian myths, this is only one of [[Ancient Egyptian creation myths|many creation stories]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Egyptians believed no specific myth was more correct than the other, rather that some combination of these myths was correct.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This creation story, the Heliopolitan tradition, is one of physiological creation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The other major creation traditions are the [[Memphite Theology|Memphite]] Tradition and Hermopolitian/[[Ogdoad creation myth|Ogdoad]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Ethnic theme parks''' are theme parks based on demonstrating the traditions and cultures of a multitude of ethnic groups. In China, Windows Around the World and [[Happy Valley Beijing]] are two examples of these parks which, due to their unique potpourris of heritages, attract tourists worldwide.  The ethnic theme parks are advertised as a way to glimpse into different areas around the world in one easy visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wired Humanities Projects, University of Oregon|url=http://whp.uoregon.edu/chinatheme/tours/ethnic-tour.html|work=Chinese Theme Parks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The layout allocates a separate “village” to each [[ethnic group]], allowing tourists and other visitors to absorb the individuality they portray.  Heritage and history are simulated through elaborate costumes and roles. Visitors also have an opportunity to participate in some of the cultural practices of various ethnic groups and to engage in a question and answer based discussion.&lt;ref name="globalvillage"&gt;Gordon, Tamara, and Bruce Caron. ''Global Villages: The Globalization of Ethnic Display''. New York: Tourist Gaze Productions, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The precise infrastructure of each park is different, but each aims to provide a display case for as many cultural identities as possible. At ''Windows Around the World'', for example, national heritage is classified into three categories: primitive song and dance, professional modifications, and further creative modifications.&lt;ref name="globalvillage"/&gt;

==Controversy==
A debate over authenticity has been sparked in light of the fact that several employees represent nationalities separate from their own individual heritages. The [[Wa people]], for instance, play the roles of African ethnic groups, while [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] are portrayed by ethnic [[Mongols|Mongolians]].&lt;ref name="globalvillage"/&gt;

Disputes also linger over the degree to which governments and corporations seek to mask and embellish what they wish within the walls of the park. According to Thomas Mullaney, a Stanford University historian, these parks are highly politicized venues which seek to shape the popular view of China as a multiethnic state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wong|first=Edward|title=China's Han Flock to Theme Parks Featuring Minorities|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/24/world/asia/24park.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Far-Right subcultures''' refers to the symbolism, values and traits that hold relevance to various politically extreme right-wing groups and organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patyi|first1=Peter|last2=Levická|first2=Jana|title=Attractiveness of Right Wing Oriented Movements and Subcultures in Modern Society of the Slovak Republic|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|date=August 2014|volume=143|pages=832–837|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.07.485}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Subkulturen {{!}} Netz gegen Nazis|url=http://www.netz-gegen-nazis.de/category/ressorts/wissen/woran-man-sie-erkennt/subkulturen&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=CCyrWMXaIcGIaLizrZAL|website=www.netz-gegen-nazis.de|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three kinds of subcultures within far-right movements to distinguish: subcultural parasitism, subcultural creation around ideology and subcultures that are networking with far-right movements, as some football hooligans did with neo-nazis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/new-right-wing-alliance-of-neo-nazis-and-hooligans-appears-in-germany-a-1000953.html|title=Germany's New Right: The Unholy Alliance of Neo-Nazis and Football Hooligans - SPIEGEL ONLINE - International|first=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg|last=Germany|website=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subcultural Parasitism ==

[[Image:Neo-Nazi Skinhead.jpg|thumb|left|A neo-Nazi skinhead from Germany]]
Far-right ideologists try to infiltrate subcultures to spread their ideas amongst them.&lt;ref&gt;Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung: Rechtsextreme Jugendkultur http://www.bpb.de/politik/extremismus/rechtsextremismus/41740/jugendkultur&lt;/ref&gt; These attempts are defined as subcultural parasitism. The probably most known subculture, which got taken over by the far-right and neo-nazis is the [[Skinhead]] scene, which started originally in Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Worley, Matthew, and Nigel Copsey. "White youth: the Far Right, Punk and British youth culture." JOMEC Journal 9 (2016): 27-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples for subculture parasitism: the [[Nipster]], infiltration of the [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)]] by neo-nazis (Nazi Hipster), [[Nazi punk]], infiltration of the [[Heavy metal subculture]], known as [[National Socialist black metal]] (NSBM/NSCH). Subcultures as the [[Goth subculture]] and the [[Hip Hop]] subculture got also infiltrated by far-right movements and ideologists.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Some other examples for far-right or neo-Nazi subcultures: [[Esoteric Nazism]] and [[Nazi Satanism]].

== Cultural counter-subversion ==
There is another strategy of neo-nazis and far right movements, that is called cultural subversion. This strategy uses already existing forms of expression and organization and fills them with far right meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mut-gegen-rechte-gewalt.de/service/lexikon/k/kulturelle-subversion|title=Kulturelle Subversion - Mut Gegen Rechte Gewalt|website=www.mut-gegen-rechte-gewalt.de|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples: 
*Music: use of already existing songs and the change of its lyrics into something national or racist 
*Slogans: the change of the left-wing slogan 'Long live the international solidarity' into 'Long live the national solidarity'
*Forms of Organization: democratic forms of organizations are copied and accommodated with far right ideology

== Modern forms of far-right subcultures and lifestyles in specific countries ==
=== Italy ===
During the regime the [[National Fascist Party]] heavily influenced fashion in the pursuit for autarchy and the importance of aesthetics and symbolism: clothes had to be produced in Italy and had to reflect the values of the Italian people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=- la Repubblica.it|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2005/10/30/moda-autarchica-vestiti-di-regime-della.htmlhttp://mda-arte.blogspot.it/2012/09/mussolini-il-fascismo-e-la-moda.html|website=Archivio - la Repubblica.it|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pieces of clothing such as the '''black shirts''' became associated with the dreaded [[Blackshirts|Volunteer Militia for the Safety of the Nation]] and even to the regime itself. 
Nowadays [[Neo-fascism|neo-fascists]] still care a great deal about clothing, but with different approaches. Symbols and clothes like the [[Celtic Cross]] and the black clothing are still present and associated to the new filo-fascists political parties and movements, but, similarly to the neo-nazism case, there has also been a growing interest in "trendiness" and fashion, with new clothing brands that offer casual and formal clothing more in line with today's consumerist culture. This has led to three different types of brands usage by the neo-fascist subculture that still cares a big deal about clothing as a way to show their political affiliation, while caring about what is trendy as well:
* The use of brands that are not openly using symbols of fascism but that are thought to be targeting neo-fascist consumers in light of their choices in advertising and partnerships, with the choice of testimonials, models, settings and even copy material that recalls the neo-fascist archetypical man. For example, Pivert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pivert, l'hanno ribattezzata 'linea di abbigliamento fascista'. Il responsabile: "Non è così ma ai ragazzi di CasaPound piace"|url=http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2016/01/26/pivert-lhanno-ribattezzata-linea-di-abbigliamento-fascista-il-responsabile-non-e-cosi-ma-ai-ragazzi-di-casapound-piace/2405761/|website=Il Fatto Quotidiano|date=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The use of brands that while denying any political involvement (the apology of fascism in Italy is a felony officially) heavily rely on the fascist's regime icons, using symbols, mottos and images without using the name of the party while still making clear what is their political affiliation. An example is the decimaofficialstore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Per Natale rivive l’abbigliamento fascista|url=http://espresso.repubblica.it/attualita/2014/12/22/news/per-natale-rivive-l-abbigliamento-fascista-1.192927|website=l'Espresso|language=it-IT|date=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The use of brands that are arbitrarily given a power of identification with their political values by the members of the subculture itself.

[[File:Neo-Nazi celtic cross flag.svg|thumb|[[Celtic cross]] on a Neo-Fascist flag]]

The arbitrary appropriation of modern devices of today's [[consumer culture]] in addition to the ones typical of its "ancestor" in Neo-fascism is not just limited to fashion, examples of modern culture products that were not born with this political affiliation but were used by neo-fascists to frame their values and the adherence of its affiliates to them are [[Tolkien]]'s novels, which led to the "Campi Hobbit" (Hobbit Camps) experience: real political camps where space was given to topics often overlooked by typical political institutions, with right wing music groups, visual artists, radio podcasts performances and social issues discussions about topics such as young people's unemployment together with paramilitary activities being carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La Repubblica 08 giugno 2007|url=http://www.compagniadellanello.net/rassegna/repubblica_08_06_07.htm|website=www.compagniadellanello.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another very famous example is the politicization of [[Association football|football]], with the [[Ultras]] groups often affiliated with certain ideologies. The majority of ultras groups in fact present small "bands" within them that are openly neo-fascist or at least far-right extremists,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.osservatoriosport.interno.gov.it/allegati/rapporto_2015_versione_stampabile.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; with groups such as Hellas Verona's "Brigate Gialloblu" or Juventus' "Vikings" having an infamous record of violence episodes, which are not related to the sport nor their supported teams' ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Calcio, la piaga nera del tifo fascista|url=http://espresso.repubblica.it/inchieste/2016/07/11/news/calcio-la-piaga-nera-del-tifo-fascista-1.276905|website=l'Espresso|language=it-IT|date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{category see also|Neo-Nazism in Germany}}

==== Far right Organisations und Formations in Germany ====
*Far right parties: East-Germany: [[National Democratic Party of Germany]] (NPD); West-Germany: 'Die Rechte' and 'Dritter Weg'. All together there are around 6000 members of far right parties in Germany.
*Extreme right-wing comradeships: [[Blood &amp; Honour]] network (or 'White Power'). Both networks are primarily selling extreme right-wing music and organizing international concerts. Their offers play an important role regarding the far right Lifestyle and they have an integrating effect on the far right scene in general. The [[Autonome Nationalisten]] are a similar organization, for predominantly young far right. The ideology is the same but in terms of aesthetics, they are more orientated towards their political opponent on the left and copy their lifestyles and symbols for their own purposes. See also Cultural Subversion
*Intellectuals of the 'Neue Rechte' ([[New Right]]): they function as the source of inspiration and keyword transmitter. 
*Far-right projects: An innovation of the last years are far right projects at the interface of virtual and real life. Examples are the 'Identitären' ([[Identitarian movement]]) and the 'Unsterblichen'. The 'Unsterblichen' was started by far rights in east Germany. They formulated the prosecution of the supposed 'Volkstods' (death of the nation). Which can be seen as relation to the demographic change in Germany and the  fear of being swamped by foreign influences. The 'Unsterblichen' took over the flashmob idea and produced high quality choreographies for demonstrations which they filmed professionally and distributed them with music in social networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Borstel|first1=Dierk|title=Ungleichwertigkeitsideologien in der Einwanderungsgesellschaft|date=2017|publisher=Springer Fachmedien|location=Wiesbaden|isbn=978-3-658-14245-2|pages=153–164|edition=Borstel, Dierk; Bozay, Kemal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Identitarian movement is one of the most renowned far-right youth culture in Germany and part of the [[New Right]]. Within the New Right it has four unique position features: youthfulness,  excessive desire for action, pop culture and [[Corporate Identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bruns|first1=Julian|last2=Glösel|first2=Kathrin|last3=Strobl|first3=Natascha|title=Die Identitären.

Also referred to as the alternative right, the [[alt-right]] is a recent political movement which holds strong views on a wide array of political, cultural, racial and religious subjects, with a central theme being [[white supremacy]] and [[white nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AP Definitive Source {{!}} Writing about the 'alt-right'|url=https://blog.ap.org/behind-the-news/writing-about-the-alt-right|website=blog.ap.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political movement of the American Alternative Right is a political movement that has gained significant prominence since the buildup to the consequent election of [[Donald Trump]] in the [[2016 US election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alt Right: A Primer about the New White Supremacy|url=http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/domestic-extremism-terrorism/c/alt-right-a-primer-about-the.html?referrer=https://www.google.it/#.WKQq3BIrKTc|website=ADL}}&lt;/ref&gt; The typical alt-right supporter is a white US citizen, most likely of a family lineage without recent immigration to the USA. While there are numerous recorded cases of anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim behaviour and supporters to be of predominantly Christian background, personal religious disposition does not prove to be of great importance beyond those which are discriminated against.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Michael|first1=George|title=The seeds of the alt-right, America's emergent right-wing populist movement|url=http://theconversation.com/the-seeds-of-the-alt-right-americas-emergent-right-wing-populist-movement-69036|website=The Conversation|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2018}}

==== Adoption of Neo-Fascist/Nazi symbolism ====

[[File:Richard B. Spencer in 2016.jpg|thumb|right|187px|Richard B. Spencer speaking at an Alt-Right Rally, 2016]]

Since Donald Trump's victory in November 2016, the exposure and symbolism associated with the alt-right has become more distinct. In mid-November 2016 at an alt-right conference with approximately 200 people in Washington, D.C. One of the speakers at this event was president of the National Policy Institute and white supremacist; [[Richard Spencer (activist)|Richard Spencer]]. Audience members cheered and gave the [[Nazi salute]] when he said, "Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldstein|first1=Joseph|title=Alt-Right Gathering Exults in Trump Election With Nazi-Era Salute|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/us/alt-right-salutes-donald-trump.html|website=The New York Times|date=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parallel theme of cultural purity combined with the totalitarian and ominous connotations associated with Nazi history provide an aesthetic appeal to the themes and ideas of the alt-right. Due to the highly superficial nature of the group, understanding of the key concepts behind these other far-right political movements is secondary to the imagery and visual culture associated with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Romano|first1=Aja|title=The 2016 culture war, as illustrated by the alt-right|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2016/12/30/13572256/2016-trump-culture-war-alt-right-meme|website=Vox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Far-right subcultures and fashion labels ==
=== Fashion label abuse ===

Fashion label abuse means in this case, far-right movements, use specific labels and connect their ideology. Some prominent examples are [[Lonsdale (clothing)|Lonsdale]], [[Fred Perry]] and [[New Balance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/fashion-labels-worn-by-europes-skinheads-restore-their-reputation/a-5226933|title=Fashion labels worn by Europe's skinheads restore their reputation - Culture - DW - 16.02.2010|first=Deutsche Welle|last=(www.dw.com)|website=DW.COM|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British sport label Lonsdale became popular in the German neo-nazi movement because of the letters 'NSDA' in the name, which refers to the National Socialist German Workers' Party ([[NSDAP]], [[Nazi Party]]), that was active between 1920 and 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lonsdale {{!}} Netz gegen Nazis|url=http://www.netz-gegen-nazis.de/lexikontext/lonsdale|website=www.netz-gegen-nazis.de|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of Fred Perry can be explained through the demand in the skinhead scene. On top of that the brand offers polo shirts with a collar in the colors black-white-red, which was the flag color used by the nazi regime and is therefore as well prominent in German neo-nazi movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fred Perry {{!}} Netz gegen Nazis|url=http://www.netz-gegen-nazis.de/lexikontext/fred-perry|website=www.netz-gegen-nazis.de|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both brands distance themselves from any association. In November 2016 Matthew LeBretton, New Balance's vice president of public affairs, criticized the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, that the Obama administration led and [[Donald Trump]] opposes. After New Balance defended its opposition to TTP, Andrew Anglin, publisher of the American [[neo-nazi]] news and commentary website [[The Daily Stormer]], declared New Balance the “Official Shoes of White People”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=We live in crazy times: Neo-Nazis have declared New Balance the ‘Official Shoes of White People’|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/11/15/the-crazy-reason-neo-nazis-have-declared-new-balance-the-official-shoes-of-white-people/|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fashion label creation around far-right ideology ===

There are also fashion labels that got created for neo-nazis, by neo-nazis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netz-gegen-nazis.de/artikel/marken-der-rechtsextremen-szene |title=Marken der rechtsextremen Szene |date=27 March 2009 |publisher=Netz-gegen-Nazis.de| language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some examples for nazi fashion labels: Ansgar Aryan, Consdaple, Eric and Sons, Masterrace Europe, Outlaw, Reconquista, Rizist, Thor Steinar, Troublemaker, Dryve by Suizhyde, Greifvogel Wear, Hate-Hate, Hermannsland, Sport Frei, Pro Violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netz-gegen-nazis.de/lexikontext/marken-die-bei-neonazis-beliebt-sind|title=Marken, die bei Neonazis beliebt sind - Belltower News|website=www.netz-gegen-nazis.de|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Generation text''' is a term referring to those members of society who have grown up with [[cell phones]] from a young age. Furthermore, it can be applied to [[adolescent]]s and [[teenagers]] who feel that they are unable to function without a cell phone.

==Creation of the term==
The term ''generation text'' has been created by several people independently. Dr. [[Michael Osit]] published a book in 2008 called "Generation Text".
A second invention of the word occurred in 2009 at a [[Lights (musician)|Lights]] concert in Winnipeg, Canada by [[Ian Scott (Manitoba politician)|Ian Scott]]. While at the concert, Scott observed that many of the teenagers were either talking on their cell phones, [[text messaging]], or videoing concert footage using their phones. Also noticing that they appeared to be all of one specific generation, he coined the term "generation text".

'''Girl power''' is a [[slogan]] that encourages and celebrates [[women's empowerment]], independence, and confidence. The slogan's invention is credited to  US punk band [[Bikini Kill]], who published a [[zine]] called ''Girl Power'' in 1991.

== Early usage and origins==
[[File:Girl Power zine.jpg|thumb|left|158px|''Girl Power'' (1991), a [[zine]] that introduced the slogan to the punk lexicon.]]
[[File:01-21-2017 - Women's March on NYC (10696).jpg|thumb|Girls wearing "Girl power" sashes at the [[2017 Women's March]] in New York City]]

In 1991, US punk band [[Bikini Kill]] published a feminist [[zine]] called ''Girl Power''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/12/arts/music/kathleen-hanna-julie-ruin-hit-reset-interview.html |title=Kathleen Hanna on ''Hit Reset'', Her Recovery and Her Feminist Path |last=Coscarelli |first=Joe |date=July 11, 2016 |website=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band's lead singer, [[Kathleen Hanna]], said was inspired by the [[Black Power]] slogan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marcus|first1=Sara|title=Girls to the Front|date=2010|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term became popular in the early and mid 90s punk culture. ''The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll'' credits the zine with coining the slogan: "In their feminist fanzine Bikini Kill they articulated an agenda for young women in and outside of music; the band put those ideas to practice. (Ironically, the zine first coined the "girl power" slogan, later co-opted by England's [[bubblegum pop]] band the [[Spice Girls]].) Bikini Kill earned a reputation in the punk underground for confronting certain standards of that genre; for example, asking people to slam at the side of the stage, so that women would not get pushed out of the front, and inviting women to take the mike and talk about sexual abuse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/bikini-kill/biography |title=Bikini Kill Bio |website=RollingStone.com |access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase is sometimes [[Sensational spelling|sensationally spelled]] ''grrrl power'', based on the spelling of ''[[riot grrrl]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gonick|first=Marnina|title=Girl Culture|year=2008|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn. [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-313-33909-7|pages=310–314|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=arQy0v_PBx4C&amp;lpg=PA311&amp;ots=653MgneXMO&amp;dq=Riot%20Grrrls%20grrl%20power&amp;pg=PA311#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=Girl Power}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leonard|first=Marion|title=Sexing The Groove: Popular Music and Gender|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-14670-8|pages=230–55|chapter='Rebel Girl, You Are the Queen of My World': Feminism, 'Subculture' and Grrrl Power}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other musical artists who have used the slogan in their music are Welsh band [[Helen Love]], with it appearing in the chorus of their 1992 song “Formula One Racing Girls”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/elizabeth.ercocklly/helenlov.htm |title=Helen Love - Gabba Gabba We Accept You |publisher=Homepage.ntlworld.com |accessdate=2012-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023114007/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/elizabeth.ercocklly/helenlov.htm |archivedate=2012-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and pop-punk duo [[Shampoo (band)|Shampoo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freewilliamsburg.com/april_2001/shampoo.html |title=Shampoo - Interview by Alexander Laurence |publisher=Free Williamsburg |date=April 2001 |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; who released an album and single titled ''Girl Power'' in 1995.

== Spice Girls and scholarship ==
British pop quintet [[Spice Girls]] popularized the slogan in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2008/01/from-title-ix-to-riot-gr.html  |title=From Title IX to Riot Grrrls |publisher=Harvard Magazine |date=January–February 2008 |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/38786.stm |title=Girl power &amp;#124; You've come a long way baby |publisher=BBC News |date=December 30, 1997 |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sarler, Carol |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-396834/Girl-Power-betrayed-us.html |title=Girl Power: how it betrayed us |publisher=Daily Mail |date=21 July 2006 |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her 2002 book ''[[Girl Heroes|Girl Heroes: The New Force in Popular Culture]]'', Professor Susan Hopkins suggests a correlation between ''girl power'', Spice Girls, and [[Action hero#Female action heroes|female action heroes]] at the end of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Costi, Angela |url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2002/22/power_chicks/ |title=Super Slick Power Chicks: The New Force or Elaborate Parody? |publisher=Senses of Cinema |date=October 4, 2002 |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geri Halliwell]], a member of the Spice Girls, credited former Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], a leading conservative, as the pioneer of their ideology of girl power.&lt;ref&gt;Amanda Evans and Tara Brabazon, "I'll never be your woman: the Spice Girls and new flavours of feminism." ''Social Alternatives'' 17#2 (1998): 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/spice-girls-too-hot-to-handle-19970710 |title=Spice Girls: Too Hot to Handle |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=10 July 1997 |accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The slogan has also been examined within the context of the academic field, for example [[Buffy studies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thirdspace.ca/articles/karras.htm "The Third Wave's Final girl: Buffy the Vampire Slayer"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050620082403/http://www.thirdspace.ca/articles/karras.htm |date=June 20, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Media theorist Kathleen Rowe Karlyn in her article "Scream, Popular Culture, and Feminism's Third Wave: I'm Not My Mother"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Karlyn |first=Kathleen Rowe |url=http://www.genders.org/g38/g38_rowe_karlyn.html |title=Scream, Popular Culture, and Feminism's Third Wave: I'm Not My Mother |publisher=Genders |year=2003 |accessdate=2012-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612004031/http://www.genders.org/g38/g38_rowe_karlyn.html |archivedate=2012-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Irene Karras in "The Third Wave's [[Final girl]]: [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]" suggest a link with [[third-wave feminism]]. Frances Early and Kathleen Kennedy in the introduction to ''Athena’s Daughters: Television’s New Women Warriors'', discuss what they describe as a link between girl power and a [[List of women warriors in literature and popular culture|"new" image of women warriors]] in popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Riley |first=Robin |url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=238391094059727 |title=Review of Early, Frances; Kennedy, Kathleen, eds., Athena's Daughters: Television's New Women Warriors |publisher=H-Net Reviews |date=May 2004 |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Oxford English Dictionary''===
A 2001 update to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defined ''girl power'' as:

{{quote|Power exercised girls; spec. a self-reliant attitude among girls and young women manifested in ambition, assertiveness, and individualism. Although also used more widely (esp. as a slogan), the term has been particularly and repeatedly associated with popular music; most notably in the early 1990s with the briefly prominent "riot grrrl" movement in the United States (cf. RIOT GIRL n.); then, in the late 1990s, with the British all-female group The Spice Girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00307048?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=girl+power&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10 |title=OED:Girl power |publisher=Oxford English Dictionary |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The dictionary further offers an example of this term by quoting from "Angel Delight", an article in the March 24, 2001 issue of ''Dreamwatch'' about the television series ''[[Dark Angel (2000 TV series)|Dark Angel]]'':

{{quote|After the [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connors]] and [[Ellen Ripley]]s of the 1980s, the 1990s weren't so kind to the superwoman format&amp;mdash;[[Xena]] Warrior Princess excepted. But it's a new 2000 millennium now, and while ''[[Charlie's Angels (2000 film)|Charlie's Angels]]'' and ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' are kicking up a storm on movie screens, it's been down to [[James Cameron]] to bring empowered female warriors back to television screens. And tellingly, Cameron has done it by mixing the sober feminism of his ''[[The Terminator|Terminator]]'' and ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' characters with the sexed-up girl power of a [[Britney Spears]] concert. The result is ''Dark Angel''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkangelfan.com/news/254.shtml E y e s &lt;-&gt; &lt;-&gt; O n l y&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105035505/http://www.darkangelfan.com/news/254.shtml |date=2008-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Criticism===
Dr. Debbie Ging, Chair of the BA in Communications Studies in [[Dublin City University]], was critical of the "Girl power" ideals, and linked it to the sexualisation of younger children, girls in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Ging, Debbie. [http://webpages.dcu.ie/~gingd/pdf/SexualisationOfChildren.pdf "''Girl Power" doesn’t empower: why it’s time for an honest debate about the sexualisation of children in Ireland''] July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
Amy McClure of [[North Carolina State University]] warns against placing too much hope on girl power as an empowering concept. She says, “An ideology based on [[consumerism]] can never be a revolutionary social movement. The fact that it appears to be a revolutionary movement is a dangerous lie that not only marketers sell to us but that we often happily sell to ourselves.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p108568_index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080131183249/http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p108568_index.html |date=January 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Media can sometimes present a narrow definition of what it means to be a girl today. One common example being popular toys such Mattel's [[Barbie]]. The recent “I can be” Barbie&lt;ref&gt;http://icanbe.barbie.com&lt;/ref&gt; embodies this concept of “girl power”: that little girls can be anything they want when they grow up. Arguably, Barbie's image may also present narrowed options with which girls can identify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Lamb | first1 = Sharon | last2 = Brown | first2 = Lyn Mikel | authorlink1 = Sharon Lamb |authorlink2=Lyn Mikel Brown| title = Packaging Girlhood: rescuing our daughters from marketers' schemes | publisher = St. Martin's Griffin | location = New York | year = 2007 | isbn = 9780312370053 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hannah Jane Parkinson of ''[[The Guardian]]'' criticized the term as something "young women [that] are feeling more confident about calling themselves feminists and standing up for principles of equality" hide behind and denounced it for including the word "girl", claiming it promoted the calling of adult women as girls.&lt;ref name="tgljaja"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/08/stop-calling-women-girls-its-either-patronising-or-sexually-suggestive | title=Stop calling women 'girls'.

'''Heritage science''' is cross-disciplinary scientific research of [[cultural heritage]]. It encompasses research enabling access to [[cultural heritage]], its [[Art conservation|conservation]], [[Interpretation (aesthetics)|interpretation]] and [[management]].

The term has become widely used after 2006 when it became increasingly evident that the more traditional terms [[conservation science (cultural heritage)|conservation science]] or preservation science inadequately reflected the breadth of research into [[cultural heritage]]. Heritage scientists in museums, galleries, libraries, archives, universities and research institutions support conservation (often called [[conservation science (cultural heritage)|conservation science]]), access (e.g. development of new [[Information and communication technologies|ICT]] tools), interpretation, including [[archaeometry]] and [[archaeological science]] (e.g. dating, [[Provenance|provenancing]], attribution), heritage management (e.g. development of tools and knowledge supporting strategic or environmental management decisions) and wider societal engagement with heritage (e.g. heritage [[Value (ethics)|values and ethics]]). Heritage science is also an excellent vehicle for public engagement with science as well as heritage.

Heritage science is seen as "key to the long-term sustainability of heritage: it is about managing change and risk and maximising social, cultural and economic benefit not just today, but in such a way that we can pass on to future generations that which we have inherited."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldselect/ldsctech/256/256.pdf |format=PDF |title=Science and Technology Committee : Science and Heritage |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domains of research, where heritage science makes a particular input were recognised to be museums, galleries, libraries and archives; the built historic environment and archaeology, by the United Kingdom National Heritage Science Strategy documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagescienceforum.org.uk/strategy.php | title=UK National Heritage Science Strategy | accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
[[File:Red Rot Leather.jpg|right|thumbnail|Red rot on leather bindings was one of the first conservation issues to excite scientists.]]
The field still requires its literature canon and opinions on whether heritage science is a domain in its own right or a field of research diverge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5SpIq80XpU | title=Round Table discussion on the Future of Heritage Science| accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this appears a matter of academic recognition, rather than a matter of research practice.

Heritage science is an old field of research: in his [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures|Royal Institution Christmas Lecture]] in 1843, [[Michael Faraday]] already pointed out how pollution importantly contributes to book degradation. The following premises appear to be of defining importance:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://heritagescienceresearch.wordpress.com/2015/11/17/theory_heritagescience/ | title=A Brief Theory of Heritage Science| accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Heritage science is inherently biased, as scientists, by doing research on heritage, contribute to its value: they create and popularize heritage through their research. 
# Heritage science is neither fundamental nor experimental: work with actual heritage objects, building or sites cannot be repeatable because heritage is not an experiment. On the other hand, the [[scientific method]] and deductive reasoning is easily applied when working with models and model objects, which heritage scientists often do due to the high value of actual historic objects and consequentially, sampling restrictions.

Since the context of heritage is often unknown, there can be any number of variables affecting the heritage system under observation – inductive reasoning is therefore often applied in heritage science. In this aspect, the premise of heritage science comes close to social science.
Heritage that is accessible, in its preserved authentic form or as a (digital) reproduction, is a "resource for economic growth, employment and social cohesion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/culture/library/publications/2014-heritage-communication_en.pdf |format=PDF |title=Towards an integrated approach to cultural heritage for Europe |publisher=EU |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through improved access, heritage science therefore contributes to well-being. Heritage science is proof that there is no world of [[The Two Cultures|'Two Cultures']]. A scientist, researching heritage defies the existence of the divide: there can be no scientific research of heritage without a contribution by humanities research. Heritage science also successfully bridges science and culture, because it provides an attractive vehicle to convey ideas and concepts related to technology and engineering, as well as culture and society. Heritage science can be considered an anthropogenic analog to environmental geography, which was defined by [[Halford Mackinder]] in 1887 as a discipline that aims to "bridge one of the greatest of all gaps" between "the natural sciences and the study of humanity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacKinder|first=H. J.|date=1887|title=On the Scope and Methods of Geography|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1801248|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society and Monthly Record of Geography|volume=9|issue=3|pages=141–174|doi=10.2307/1801248}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Research==
[[Image:WoS publications 2015.png|right|thumbnail|Publication trends in the heritage science field, 2005-2014.]]

Heritage science is an increasingly lively science domain. Materials and techniques of the past are often very difficult to study and state-of-the-art techniques and methods need to be employed. Discoveries new to science are often the result of such endeavours, e.g. new antibiotics from bacteria discovered in the [[Cave of Altamira]], in Spain. With its wide definition, heritage science spans a significant variety of scientific activities. In order to support conservation, access, interpretation and management, heritage science must be based on an [[interdisciplinary]] palette of knowledge, from fundamental sciences ([[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[mathematics]], [[biology]]) to [[arts]] and [[humanities]] (conservation, [[archaeology]], [[philosophy]], [[ethics]], [[history]], [[art history]] etc.), including [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[computer science]]s and [[engineering]].

In academia, heritage science is often performed by scientists spending a proportion of their time on heritage-related research. The academic field, judged by the number of academic outputs published annually, is steadily increasing. This could be taken to estimate the domain size – with the number of outputs in 2014 being 6,800 (Source: Web of Science&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.webofknowledge.com/ |title=ISI Web of Knowledge |publisher=Images.isiknowledge.com |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;), it could be assumed that there are about 3,000 heritage scientists active in the field (publishing on average 2 academic publications per year). This goes against the generally held view that the field is small.

The proportion per country varies greatly, about 20% of researchers being active in the US, 15% in the UK, 10% in Italy, 5% France, and 5% in China (with a strong increase in the last decade).

Since 2013, the scientific domain has its own flagship journal, ''Heritage Science''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagesciencejournal.com/ |title=Heritage Science |publisher=Heritagesciencejournal.com |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Mind the Gap project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/about/our-role/collection-care/heritage-science-research-and-development/collaborative-working-practices-mind-the-gap/ |title= Mind the gap project |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; funded by the UK EPSRC/AHRC Science and Heritage Programme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagescience.ac.uk/ |title= UK AHRC/EPSRC Science and Heritage Programme |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported on the drivers and impediments in cross-disciplinary research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mind-the-gap-report-jan-2014.pdf |format=PDF |title=Mind the Gap Report |publisher=AHRC |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project found that there is no gap between rigour and relevance in heritage science research but rather that there is a continuum of activity. However, there was less satisfaction with heritage science research in relation to its impact on practice, in comparison to its academic impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagesciencejournal.com/content/2/1/11 |title= Mind the gap: rigour and relevance in collaborative heritage science research |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[File:SEAHA Mobile Heritage Lab.jpg|thumbnail|The SEAHA Mobile Heritage Laboratory for field research and public engagement with science and heritage.]]
The heritage science career paths are various. Due to the cross-disciplinary nature of heritage science, any academic background is suitable, from [[formal sciences]], [[natural sciences]] to [[social sciences]]. 
Most researchers have entered the field by carrying out doctoral research in the field, which is due to the fact that there is currently no undergraduate course in this domain. Since 2010, Master's degree courses in heritage science have become available at [[University College London]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/heritage/programmes/mres-msc/mres-seaha |title=Heritage Science Masters at UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Queens University Belfast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/gap/ProspectiveStudents/PostgraduateStudies/GraduateStudiesTaught/HeritageScience/ |title=Heritage Science Masters at Queens University, Belfast |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, students can obtain undergraduate and/or graduate degrees in conservation science at the [[University of Florence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unifi.it/p-cor2-2016-101227-B194-GEN-1-1.html|title=Offerta formativa - Università degli Studi di Firenze - UniFI|website=www.unifi.it|language=it|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Bologna]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://corsi.unibo.it/SCIENCEFORCONSERVATION/Pages/default.aspx|title=Two year master in Science for the conservation-restoration of cultural heritage - Ravenna - Università di Bologna|website=corsi.unibo.it|language=en|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a recently created programme at the [[Ca' Foscari University of Venice|University of Venice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unive.it/pag/20740/|title=Summary: Master's Degree Programme in Conservation Science and Technology for Cultural Heritage - Ca' Foscari|website=www.unive.it|language=it|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other universities in Italy have faculty members whose primary research focus is in heritage science; these groups often accept international students who would like to obtain a PhD in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scich.it/index.html|title=COLOMBINI GROUP - Chemical Science for the Safeguard of Cultural Heritage|website=www.scich.it|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scienzadeimateriali.campusnet.unito.it/do/docenti.pl/Alias?oscar.chiantore#profilo|title=Prof. Oscar Chiantore - Corso di Laurea Magistrale in Scienza dei Materiali - Università degli Studi di Torino|last=Torino|first=Università degli Studi di|website=scienzadeimateriali.campusnet.unito.it|language=it|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taught courses in heritage science programmes include elements of heritage science, e.g. technical art history is often part of [[art history]] courses, and [[natural sciences]] are often taught in conservation courses. [[Brandenburg University of Technology]] in Germany offers the international Master's programme World Heritage Studies &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.b-tu.de/en/heritage-studies-phd/|title=World Heritage Studies, Master of Arts|website=www.b-tu.de|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and PhD programme Heritage Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.b-tu.de/worldheritage-ma/|title=PhD Programme Heritage Studies|website=www.b-tu.de|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[University College London|UCL]], [[University of Oxford]] and [[University of Brighton]], the Centre for Doctoral Training in Science and Engineering in Arts, Heritage and Archaeology ([http://www.seaha-cdt.ac.uk/ SEAHA]) was established in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seaha-cdt.ac.uk/ |title=Centre for Doctoral Training in Science and Engineering in Arts, Heritage and Archaeology |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key aspect of the SEAHA scheme is the collaborative nature of projects, enabling partnerships between academic institutions, industry and national heritage agencies and giving an applied focus to the research training.

Since the field requires significant cross-disciplinary and transferrable skills, graduates may be able to take jobs in industry and academia. To work within the field of heritage science (e.g. in a museum laboratory), a PhD in the physical sciences and significant experience in a museum or conservation studio is typically required.

'''Human interactions with microbes''' include both practical and symbolic uses of [[microbe]]s, and negative interactions in the form of human, domestic animal, and crop diseases.

Practical use of microbes began in ancient times with [[fermentation in food processing]]; [[bread]], [[beer]] and [[wine]] have been produced by [[yeast]]s from the dawn of civilisation, such as in [[ancient Egypt]]. More recently, microbes have been used in activities from [[biological warfare]] to the production of chemicals by fermentation, as industrial chemists discover how to manufacture a widening variety of organic chemicals including [[enzyme]]s and bioactive molecules such as [[hormone]]s and [[competitive inhibition|competitive inhibitors]] for use as medicines. Fermentation is used, too, to produce substitutes for fossil fuels in forms such as [[ethanol]] and [[methane]]; [[Algae fuel|fuels may also be produced by algae]]. Anaerobic microorganisms are important in [[sewage treatment]]. In scientific research, yeasts and the bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' serve as [[model organism]]s especially in [[genetics]] and related fields.

On the symbolic side, an early poem about brewing is the [[Sumer]]ian "Hymn to [[Ninkasi]]", from 1800 BC. In the [[Middle Ages]], [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''[[The Decameron]]'' and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'': addressed people's fear of deadly contagion and the moral decline that could result. Novelists have exploited the [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|apocalyptic possibilities]] of [[pandemic]]s from [[Mary Shelley]]'s 1826 ''[[The Last Man]]'' and [[Jack London]]'s 1912 ''[[The Scarlet Plague]]'' onwards. [[Hilaire Belloc]] wrote a humorous poem to "The Microbe" in 1912. Dramatic plagues and mass infection have formed the story lines of many [[Hollywood]] films, starting with ''[[Nosferatu]]'' in 1922. In 1971, ''[[The Andromeda Strain]]'' told the tale of an [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial microbe]] threatening life on Earth. [[Microbiologist]]s since [[Alexander Fleming]] have used coloured or [[fluorescence|fluorescing]] colonies of bacteria to create miniature artworks.

Microorganisms such as [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es are important as [[pathogen]]s, causing disease to humans, [[crop plant]]s, and [[domestic animal]]s.

[[Culture]] consists of the [[social behaviour]] and [[Norm (social)|norms]] found in [[human]] [[society|societies]] and transmitted through social [[learning]]. [[Cultural universals]] in all human societies include expressive forms like [[art]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[ritual]], [[religion]], and [[technology|technologies]] like [[tool|tool usage]], [[cooking]], [[shelter (building)|shelter]], and [[clothing]]. The concept of [[material culture]] covers physical expressions such as technology, architecture and art, whereas immaterial culture includes principles of [[social organization]], [[mythology]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]], and [[science]].&lt;ref name=MacionisGerber2011&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |title=Sociology |last=Macionis |first=John J. |last2=Gerber |first2=Linda Marie |date=2011 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0137001613 |page=53 |accessdate=29 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818045455/https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |archivedate=18 August 2017 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article describes the roles played by microorganisms in human culture.

Since microbes were not known until the [[Early Modern]] period, they appear in earlier literature indirectly, through descriptions of [[baking]] and [[brewing]]. Only with the invention of the [[microscope]], as used by [[Robert Hooke]] in his 1665 book ''[[Micrographia]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hooke |first1=Robert|title=Micrographia: Or Some Physiological Descriptions of Minute Bodies Made by Magnifying Glasses, with Observations and Inquiries Thereupon |date=1665 |publisher=Courier Dover |isbn=0-486-49564-7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0DYXk_9XX38C&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=Micrographia+honeycomb#v=onepage&amp;q=Micrographia%20honeycomb&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek]] in the 1670s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Payne, A.S. |title=The Cleere Observer: A Biography of Antoni Van Leeuwenhoek |page=13 |publisher=Macmillan |date=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[germ theory of disease]], and progress in [[microbiology]] in the 19th century were microbes observed directly, identified as living organisms, and put to use on a scientific basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Germ Theory|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/3035/Germ-Theory.html|publisher=Rank|accessdate=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same knowledge also allowed microbes to appear explicitly in literature and the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Menagerie of Microbes|url=http://www.ascus.org.uk/exhibitions/menagerie-of-microbes/|publisher=Ascus|accessdate=27 September 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927162641/http://www.ascus.org.uk/exhibitions/menagerie-of-microbes/|archivedate=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food production===
{{Main|Fermentation in food processing}}

Controlled [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]] with microbes in [[brewing]], [[wine making]], [[baking]], [[pickling]] and cultured [[dairy product]]s such as [[yogurt]] and [[cheese]], is used to modify ingredients to make [[foods]] with desirable properties. The [[List of microorganisms used in food and beverage preparation|principal microbes involved]] are [[yeast]]s, in the case of beer, wine, and ordinary [[bread]]; and [[bacteria]], in the case of [[anaerobic respiration|anaerobically]] fermented [[vegetable]]s, [[dairy product]]s, and [[sourdough]] bread. The cultures variously provide flavour and aroma, inhibit pathogens, increase digestibility and palatability, make bread rise, reduce cooking time, and create useful products including [[alcohol]], [[organic acid]]s, [[vitamin]]s, [[amino acid]]s, and [[carbon dioxide]]. Safety is maintained with the help of [[food microbiology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foodsci.uoguelph.ca/dairyedu/micro.html |title= Dairy Microbiology |accessdate=9 October 2006 |publisher= University of Guelph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Steinkraus&gt;{{cite book |editor=Steinkraus, K.

===Water treatment===
{{Main|Sewage treatment}}
Oxidative sewage treatment processes rely on microorganisms to oxidise organic constituents. Anaerobic microorganisms reduce sludge solids producing [[methane]] gas and a sterile mineralised residue. In [[potable water]] treatment, one method, the [[slow sand filter]], employs a complex gelatinous layer composed of a wide range of microorganisms to remove both dissolved and particulate material from raw water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=Biology of Wastewater Treatment | author=Gray, N.F. | publisher=Imperial College Press | year=2004 | page=1164 | isbn=1-86094-332-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemicals, enzymes ===
[[File:Penicillin bioreactor.jpg|thumb|An early [[Penicillin]] bioreactor, from 1957, now in the [[Science Museum, London]]]]
{{main|Industrial enzymes}}

Microorganisms are used for many commercial and industrial purposes, including the production of chemicals, [[enzymes]] and other bioactive molecules, often through [[protein engineering]]. For example, [[acetic acid]] is produced by the  bacterium ''[[Acetobacter aceti]]'', while [[citric acid]] is produced by the fungus ''[[Aspergillus niger]]''. Microorganisms are used to prepare a widening range of bioactive molecules and enzymes. For example, [[Streptokinase]] produced by the bacterium ''[[Streptococcus]]'' and modified by [[genetic engineering]] is used [[clot buster|to remove clots]] from the blood vessels of patients who have suffered a [[myocardial infarctions|heart attack]]. [[Cyclosporin A]] is an [[immunosuppressive agent]] in [[organ transplantation]], while [[statins]] produced by the yeast ''[[Monascus purpureus]]'' serve as [[blood cholesterol]] lowering agents, [[competitive inhibition|competitively inhibiting]] the enzyme that synthesizes cholesterol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Biology textbook for class XII |publisher=National council of educational research and training |isbn=81-7450-639-X |page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science===
Microorganisms are essential tools in [[biotechnology]], [[biochemistry]], [[genetics]], and [[molecular biology]]. The yeasts brewer's yeast (''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'') and fission yeast (''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]]'') are important [[model organism]]s in science, since they are simple [[eukaryote]]s that can be grown rapidly in large numbers and are easily manipulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Castrillo J.I.; Oliver S.

===Endosymbiosis===
{{further|Human microbiota}}

Microbes can form an [[Endosymbiont|endosymbiotic]] relationship with larger organisms. For example, the bacteria that live within the human digestive system [[Human flora#Human bacterial flora and human health|contribute to human health]] through gut immunity, the synthesis of [[vitamin]]s such as [[folic acid]] and [[biotin]], and the fermentation of complex indigestible [[carbohydrate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=O'Hara, A. |author2=Shanahan, F. | title=The gut flora as a forgotten organ | journal=EMBO Rep | volume=7 | issue=7 | pages=688–93 | year=2006 | pmid=16819463 | doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400731 | pmc=1500832}}&lt;/ref&gt; Future drugs and food chemicals may need to be tested on the gut microbiota; it is already clear that [[probiotic]] supplements can promote health, and that gut microbes are affected by both diet and medicines.&lt;ref name="Valdes Walter Segal Spector p=k2179"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Valdes | first=Ana M | last2=Walter | first2=Jens | last3=Segal | first3=Eran | last4=Spector | first4=Tim D | title=Role of the gut microbiota in nutrition and health | journal=BMJ | date=2018 | doi=10.1136/bmj.k2179 | page=k2179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Warfare===

Advances in [[bacteriology]] in the 20th century increased the sophistication of possible [[bio-agent]]s in war. Biological sabotage—in the form of [[anthrax]] and [[glanders]]—was undertaken on behalf of the [[German Empire|Imperial German]] government during [[World War I]], with indifferent results.&lt;ref&gt;Koenig, Robert (2006), ''The Fourth Horseman: One Man's Secret Campaign to Fight the Great War in America'', PublicAffairs.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[World War II]], Britain weaponised [[tularemia]], [[Anthrax disease|anthrax]], [[brucellosis]], and [[botulism]] toxins, but never used them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=SoDwO-dl-i0C |title=Biological Agents, Volume 2 |last=Prasad |first=S.K. |year=2009 |publisher=Discovery Publishing House |page=36 |isbn=978-81-8356-381-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Famous fantastic mysteries 194902.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Jack London]]'s 1912 ''[[The Scarlet Plague]]'' was reprinted in the February 1949 issue of ''[[Famous Fantastic Mysteries]]'']]

The literary possibilities of [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic stories]] about [[pandemic]]s (worldwide outbreaks of disease) have been explored in novels and films from [[Mary Shelley]]'s 1826 ''[[The Last Man]]'' and [[Jack London]]'s 1912 ''[[The Scarlet Plague]]'' onwards. Medieval writings that deal with plague include [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''[[The Decameron]]'' and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'': both treat the people's fear of contagion and the resulting moral decline, as well as bodily death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Riva |first1=Michele Augusto |last2=Benedetti |first2=Marta |last3=Cesana |first3=Giancarlo |title=Pandemic Fear and Literature: Observations from Jack London's 'The Scarlet Plague' [another dimension] |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases |date=October 2014 |volume=20 |issue=10 |page=online |doi=10.3201/eid2010.130278 |url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/10/13-0278_article}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The making of beer has been celebrated in verse since the time of Ancient [[Sumeria]], c. 1800 BC, when the "Hymn to [[Ninkasi]]" was inscribed on a clay tablet.

Wine is a frequent topic in [[English literature]], from the spiced French and Italian "[[hippocras|ypocras]]", "[[claret|claree]]", and "[[Vernaccia|vernage]]" in Chaucer's ''[[The Merchant's Tale]]'' onwards.

Another classic film, [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s 1957 ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'', deals with the plague theme very differently, with the [[grim reaper]] directly represented by an actor in a hood.

===In art===
{{main|Microbial art}}

[[Microbial art]] is the creation of artworks by culturing bacteria, typically on [[agar plate]]s, to form desired patterns. These may be chosen to [[fluorescence|fluoresce]] under ultraviolet light in different colours.&lt;ref name=Science2009&gt;{{cite journal |editor-last=Torrice |editor-first=Michael |date=6 November 2009 |title=Petri Dish Artists |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/326/5954/777.2/tab-pdf |format=pdf |journal=Science |publisher=AAAS |volume=326 |issue=5954 |page=777 |doi=10.1126/science.326_777b |access-date=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Fleming]], the discoverer of [[penicillin]], created "germ paintings" using different species of bacteria that were naturally pigmented in different colours.&lt;ref name=Fleming&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/Painting-With-Penicillin-Alexander-Flemings-Germ-Art.html |title=Painting With Penicillin: Alexander Fleming's Germ Art |author=Dunn, Rob |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] |date=11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An instance of a [[protist]] in an artwork is the artist [[Louise Bourgeois]]'s [[bronze]] sculpture ''Amoeba''. It has a white [[patina]] resembling plaster, and was designed in 1963–5, based on drawings of a pregnant woman's belly that she made as early as the 1940s. According to the [[Tate Gallery]], the work "is a roughly modelled organic form, its bulges and single opening suggesting a moving, living creature in the stages of evolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Louise Bourgeois.

Microorganisms are the causative agents ([[pathogen]]s) in many infectious diseases of humans and domestic animals. [[Pathogenic bacteria]] cause diseases such as [[bubonic plague|plague]], [[tuberculosis]] and [[anthrax]]. Protozoa cause diseases including [[malaria]], [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], [[dysentery]] and [[toxoplasmosis]]. Microscopic fungi cause diseases such as [[ringworm]], [[candidiasis]] and [[histoplasmosis]]. [[Pathogenic viruses]] cause diseases such as [[influenza]], [[yellow fever]] and [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Alberts, B. |author2=Johnson, A. |author3=Lewis, J.  |title=Molecular Biology of the Cell |edition=4th |publisher=Garland Science |date=2002 |section=Introduction to Pathogens |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26917/ |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metapathogen.com | title=MetaPathogen | accessdate=15 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''International communication''' (also referred to as the ''[[study of global communication]]'' or '''transnational communication''') is the communication practice that occurs across international borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fortner|first=R. S.|title=International communication: History, conflict, and control of the global metropolis|year=1993|publisher=Wadsworth Pub. Co.|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for international communication was due to the increasing effects and influences of globalization. As a field of study, international communication is a branch of [[communication studies]], concerned with the scope of "government-to-government", "business-to-business", and "people-to-people" interactions at a global level.&lt;ref&gt;Thussu, D.K.(2006).''International Communication: Continuity and Change''. London:Hodder Education.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, international communication is being taught at colleges across the United States. Due to the increasingly globalized market, employees who possess the ability to effectively communicate across cultures are in high demand. International communication "encompasses political, economic, social, cultural and military concerns".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fortner|first=R. S.|title=International communication: History, conflict, and control of the global metropolis|year=1993|publisher=Wadsworth Pub. Co.|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical context ==

===Communication and empire===
Efficient communication networks played crucial roles in establishing ancient imperial authority and international trade. The extent of empire could be used as an 'indication of the [[communication efficiency|efficiency of communication]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Innis|first=H.|title=Empire and communications|year=1972|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|location=Toronto|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient empires such as Rome, Persia and China, all utilized writing in collecting information and dispersing, creating enormous postal and dispatch systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=S.|title=News and society in the Greek pols|year=1996|publisher=Duck worth|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as in fifteenth century, news had been disseminated trans-nationally in Europe. 'The wheat traders of Venice, the silver traders of Antwerp, the merchants of Nuremberg and their trading partners shared economic newsletters and created common values and beliefs in the rights of capital.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Voltmeter|first=Ingrid|title=International Communication Theory in Transition: Parameters of the New Global Public Sphere|url=http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/volkmer.html|accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The advent of telegraph and time–space compression===
{{see also|time space compression}}
In 1837, [[Samuel Morse]] invented [[telegraph]]. Given its speed and reliability in delivering information, telegraph offered opportunities for capital and military expansion. As showed in Table 1.1, the establishment of cable hardware signifies global power order in late nineteenth and early twentieth century.

===The era of news agencies===
The newspaper industry and international telegraph networks mutually facilitated each other. As the supply and demand of newspaper industry rapidly increased in nineteenth century, [[news agencies]] were established successively. [[The French Havas Agency]] was founded in 1835, the German agency [[Wolff]]in 1849 and the British [[Reuters]] in 1851. These three European agencies, which started to operate internationally, were all subsidized by their respective governments.

=== Radio broadcasting ===
Western countries seized the chances to implement radio communication after the first radio transmissions of human voice in 1902. But the two mechanisms of radio broadcasting were distinctively different. In the USA, [[the Radio Act of 1927]] confirm its status as an advertising-funded commercial enterprise, while in Britain, the public broadcasting pioneer [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] set up in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Thussu, D.K.(2006).''International Communication: Continuity and Change''. London:Hodder Education.&lt;/ref&gt; During the First World War and the Second World War, radio broadcasting played a significant role in both domestic public opinion management and international diplomacy propaganda abroad. Even in the Cold War times, this radio-dominated international communication still featured in propaganda respective ideologies. The prominent example is [[Voice of America|the Voice of America]], which ran a global network to indoctrinate "American dream" to its international audience.

===Demanding a new communication order===
Since the cold war officially ended in 1990, the intense relations of super powers halted with the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the emergence of the Third World countries, the unequally developed communication order can no longer exist. The Third World called for ceasing their marginalized communication status. Especially when international communications stepped into the information age, 'the convergence of telecommunication and computing and the ability to move all type of data – pictures, words, sounds – via the Internet have revolutionized international information exchange.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thussu|first=D.K.|title=International Communication: Continuity and Change|year=2006|publisher=Hodder Education|pages=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Considerations for international communication ===
When communicating internationally it is important to take culture into consideration. Though English has become the language of business, many businesses fail to recognize that the language used does not determine how business is conducted. Therefore, it is important to understand that intercultural and international communication are interchangeable.

As a tourist it may be acceptable to maintain the cultural norms from a country of origin when visiting, though attempting to adapt would be appreciated. However, when conducting business it is important to recognize cultural differences, especially when communicating.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Robert. "Intercultural Business Communication". Teaching English as a Second or Foreign Language. Oxford University Press. Retrieved 16 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the century there was a large amount of research based on the needs of those that travel abroad in order to commercialize products or services. The list of researchers includes Hofstede, 1991; Storti, 1994; Ansari &amp; Jackson, 1995; Cushner &amp; Brislin, 1996; Adler, 1997; Mead, 1998; and Marx, 1999. From those studies Gibson's volume becomes an important source of information for business professionals interested in succeeding internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gibson|first1=Robert|title=Intercultural Business Communication|url=http://www.cc.kyoto-su.ac.jp/information/tesl-ej/ej33/r8.html|website=Teaching English as a Second or Foreign Language|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=16 November 2014|ref=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As explained by Douglas Storey, there was a change in style and strategy of American diplomacy since 1979 after the first addition of Glen Fisher's book appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Storey|first1=Douglas|title=International Communication|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/216913937|publisher=Journalism Quarterly|accessdate=18 November 2014|ref=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the reason for international communication it is important to understand that international communication is not limited to the language spoken during communication.

== Scope and approaches of international communication research ==
International communication is widely spread and multilayered in contemporary society, however it is not considered as a separate academic discipline because of its overlapping with other subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stevenson|first=R.|title=Defining international communication as a field|journal=Journalism Quarterly|year=1992|issue=69|pages=543–553}}&lt;/ref&gt; International communication is 'a topic field rather than a discipline field' and international communication studies is a mode of 'organizing inquiry'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peters|first=J.|title=Genealogical notes on "the field"|journal=Journal of Communication|year=1993|volume=43|issue=4|pages=132–139|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1993.tb01313.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most obvious manifestations of international communication are [[world news]], when the media of one country cover news from abroad. But, apart from journalism, international communication also occurs in other areas (culture, technology, sciences) and the nature of the "information" that is circulated can be classified in a wide variety of categories, such as cultural (music, films, sports, TV shows from one country to another), scientific (research papers published abroad, scientific exchange or cooperation), and intelligence (diplomacy reports, international espionage, etc.).

Typically the study of international communication includes a deep attention to the circulation of news among different countries (and the resulting imbalances, from which came the concept of [[news flow]]), the power of media organizations (such as [[media conglomerate|conglomerates]] and news agencies), issues such as [[cultural imperialism]] and [[media imperialism]], and the political role that international cooperation can have in enhancing the media industry (and society as a whole) in a given region, such as proposed by [[development communication]] or [[communication for development]].

Some renowned scholars in international communication include [[Wilbur Schramm]], [[Ithiel de Sola Pool]], [[Johan Galtung]], [[Anthony Smith (producer)|Anthony Smith]], Robert Stevenson, [[Jeremy Tunstall]], [[Armand Mattelart]], [[Oliver Boyd-Barrett]], Ali Mohammadi, [[Annabelle Sreberny]], [[Cees J. Hamelink]], [[Daya Kishan Thussu]] and [[Chris Paterson]]. The ''[[International Communication Gazette]]'' and the ''[[Journal of International Communication]]'' are reference journals in this field.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

'''Itutu''', which literally translates as "[[Cool (aesthetic)|cool]]" from the [[Yoruba language]], has been used by the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] and more recently by [[African studies|Africanist]] art historians to describe the aesthetic that characterizes much Yoruba and some African-American art.  An "Itutu" aesthetic includes the appearance of a calm, collected face that is found in much [[Yoruba traditional art|Yoruba sculpture]].  It has been suggested by [[Robert Farris Thompson]] of Yale University that Itutu is the origin of the American idea of the "cool".  His 1973 article "An Aesthetic of the Cool" traces the idea of "Itutu" from the Yoruba to several other African civilizations and finally to the Americas, where the descendents of Africans perpetuated the importance of being "cool".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=Robert Farris|title=An Aesthetic of the Cool|journal=African Arts|date=1 January 1973|volume=7|issue=1|pages=41–91|doi=10.2307/3334749|jstor=3334749}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Katimavik''' ([[Inuktitut]]: "meeting place") is a registered charity which educates [[Canadians|Canadian]] youth through volunteer work. Katimavik provides opportunities for young Canadians to participate in intensive six-month periods of volunteer service through the following themed programs: "Cultural Discovery and Civic Engagement", "Eco-citizenship and Active Living", "Second Language and Cultural Identity", "Eco-internship" (Éco-stage), and "Katimavik Horizon". In each program, volunteers live in groups of 11 young people in one or two different regions of the country, work full-time for not-for-profit organizations, and engage in an educational curriculum in which volunteers improve their second official language, learn about environmental stewardship and Canadian cultures, and develop a healthy lifestyle and leadership skills.&lt;ref name="katimavik1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.katimavik.org/subsection-85/What-is-Katimavik |title=What is Katimavik? |publisher=Katimavik |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724142142/http://www.katimavik.org/subsection-85/What-is-Katimavik |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2011-12 program year, approximately 1,150 young Canadians volunteered in a Katimavik program and lived at one of 53 Katimavik houses located across the country while contributing to the work of one of 545 partner organizations.&lt;ref name="katimavik2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.katimavik.org/subsection-50/Mission-and-objectives |title=Our mission |publisher=Katimavik |date= |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724142251/http://www.katimavik.org/subsection-50/Mission-and-objectives |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is currently headed by Daniel Lapointe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.katimavik.org/news-421/Katimavik-Names-Daniel-Lapointe-to-Serve-as-CEO Katimavik Names Daniel Lapointe to Serve as CEO] from katimavik.org {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231215104/http://www.katimavik.org/news-421/Katimavik-Names-Daniel-Lapointe-to-Serve-as-CEO |date=December 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1977, more than 30,000 Canadians have participated in the program, staged in more than 2000 communities.&lt;ref name="katimavik2"/&gt;

==Overview==
Each Katimavik program consists of groups of 11 youth aged 17 to 21 who are drawn from across [[Canada]]. They travel together to one or two different places in Canada for a period of six months. During the 2007-2008 program year there were 99 such groups spread across Canada. Each participant volunteers for about 40 hours per week and completes a learning program that focuses on Canada's [[official language]]s, protecting the environment, leadership, [[cultural diversity]], and leading a healthy lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.katimavik.org/subsection-372/Life-in-Katimavik |title=Activities |publisher=Katimavik |date= |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724143735/http://www.katimavik.org/subsection-372/Life-in-Katimavik |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, more than 500 community non-profit organizations are assisted by Katimavik volunteers doing full-time work for them.&lt;ref name="katimavik2"/&gt; Katimavik has volunteer projects in all 10 Canadian provinces and three territories. Katimavik has signed partnerships with a number of post-secondary institutions in Canada, including [[Vancouver Island University]], [[Capilano University]], Quebec's public community colleges ([[CEGEP]]), and [[George Brown College]] in order for Katimavik participants to receive post-secondary credit for their experiences.

Katimavik has its national headquarters in [[Montréal]], Quebec, which also serves as regional office for the Atlantic and Quebec region. For the Central region, the regional office is located in [[Ottawa]], Ontario. For the North, Pacific and Prairies regions, the organization's regional office is located in [[Calgary]], Alberta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.katimavik.org/subsection-77/Contact-us |title=Contact us |publisher=Katimavik |date= |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726214637/http://www.katimavik.org/subsection-77/Contact-us |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Katimavik was started by [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s government and then Senator [[Jacques Hébert (Canadian politician)|Jacques Hébert]] as well as then [[Minister of National Defence (Canada)|Minister of National Defence]] [[Barney Danson]].  Legally, it was incorporated as '''OPCAN''', a non-profit corporation created by [[letters patent]] dated January 26, 1977 pursuant to Part II of the [[Canada Business Corporations Act|Canada Corporations Act]]. Much of Katimavik's structure was taken from [[Canadian Cadet Organizations]] and the defunct [[Company of Young Canadians]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, William Stenner. "Why I Hate Canadians", 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s Katimavik offered a military option, an opportunity to spend three months on an Army or Navy base learning fundamental skills such as first aid and map reading, as well as basic military skills, such as drills and rifle handling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The overall program grew quickly in its initial years to its peak in 1985-86, when there were more than 5,000 participants.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} The program was cancelled that year by [[Brian Mulroney]]'s new government.

The cancellation prompted founder Jacques Hébert to undertake on a 21-day [[hunger strike]] in protest, to no avail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.katimavik.org/subsection-53/History |title=Our history |publisher=Katimavik |date= |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726214852/http://www.katimavik.org/subsection-53/History |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently worked with Quebec region director Claude Raiche to continue Katimavik as an [[outdoor recreation]] training centre at [[Notre-Dame-de-l'Île-Perrot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.katimavik.org/files/File/rapportannuelEN20012002.pdf |title=Annual Report |publisher=Katimavik |year=2001–2002 |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306013545/http://www.katimavik.org/files/File/rapportannuelEN20012002.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It continued in this form until 1994 when [[Service Canada Centres for Youth|Youth Service Canada]] helped Katimavik to form a pilot program involving six projects and 66 participants. The next year, the [[Government of Canada]]'s [[Department of Canadian Heritage|Department of Heritage]] provided the program with ongoing funding and the number of projects and participants tripled. The size of the program then continued to increase; during the 2005-2006 program year there were 1,155 participants in 105 communities across Canada.  In 2008 Katimavik was granted consultative status at the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] which has allowed Katimavik to liaise with similar organizations in other countries and represent Canada internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://file.katimavik.org/homes/root/File/Background%20document_ENG.pdf |title=Background document: Katimavik-Opcan's Special Consultative Status with ECOSOC |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316120956/http://file.katimavik.org/homes/root/File/Background%20document_ENG.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Katimavik was told by the government that its funding was under review and that it was to cease recruitment activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://katimaviktoms.blogspot.com/2006/08/katimavik-funding-cuts.html |title=Unofficial Katimavik Blog: Katimavik funding cuts ? |publisher=blogspot.com |date=2006-08-14 |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316120956/http://katimaviktoms.blogspot.com/2006/08/katimavik-funding-cuts.html |archivedate=2012-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A letter-writing campaign was organized by Katimavik and funding levels were maintained until October 2010 when the government announced three-year funding in the sum of $15 million per year, a reduction from its previous funding levels ($19.7 million).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.katimavik.org/news-403/Katimavik-receives-multi-year-funding-from-the-federal-government Katimavik receives multi-year funding from federal government] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107210457/http://www.katimavik.org/news-403/Katimavik-receives-multi-year-funding-from-the-federal-government |date=January 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, Katimavik diversified its program offerings. Katimavik launched a program called Katimavik North which focused upon pairing groups of youth between the ages of 18 and 25 that were half-composed of young Canadians from the territories and half-composed of young Canadians from the southern provinces; the groups then lived in both Canada's north and south in order to learn from each culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.niyc.ca/opportunuties/katimavik-program |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706190640/http://www.niyc.ca/opportunuties/katimavik-program |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Katimavik expanded beyond youth service when it launched an Eco-stage program in conjunction with the [[Government of Quebec]]; the program allowed Quebecers between the ages of 18 and 35 to gain experience in an environmentally-related career while drawing upon the educational expertise that Katimavik has built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecostage.qc.ca/ |title=Éco-stage - Katimavik |publisher=Ecostage.qc.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104222427/http://www.ecostage.qc.ca/ |archivedate=2012-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current programs==
Katimavik's current program offerings relate to the themes of "Cultural Discovery and Civic Engagement", "Eco-citizenship and Active Living", "Second Language and Cultural Identity", and the program "Katimavik Horizon" which combines all of the program elements into a less focused but more diverse experience.&lt;ref name="katimavik1"/&gt; About these programs:

;Katimavik Horizon
This six-month program provides an opportunity to live and volunteer in two different Canadian communities. The volunteers can shape the program based on the particular aptitudes and interests of the
group.

;Cultural discovery and civic engagement
For six months youth volunteer in two distinct Canadian communities, one of which has a significant aboriginal population. This program is designed for youth who are interested in discovering the diversity of
Canada while engaging in meaningful volunteer service activities. Volunteers will explore the geography, history, economy and socio-cultural makeup of their host communities.

;Eco-citizenship and active living
This program gives youth the opportunity to develop a healthy lifestyle and to thoroughly acquire an understanding of the important ecological challenges in a Canadian community where they will be located
while participating in volunteer initiatives that promote environmental stewardship. Over the course of six months, volunteers obtain an in-depth knowledge and fully integrate in one Canadian community outside
the volunteer’s home province where they apply the principles of eco-citizenship.

;Second language and cultural identity
For six months youth volunteer in two Canadian communities: one Anglophone community in Western Canada and one Francophone community in Québec. It gives participants intense immersion in an linguistic and cultural experience while engaging in meaningful volunteer service.

;Éco-stage
Éco-stage is a three-month program for young Québécois between the ages of 18 and 35 who want to engage in periods of work experience related to getting professional experience in the environmental sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecostage.qc.ca/tabid/58.html |title=Vivez l'expérience Éco-stage! |publisher=Ecostage.qc.ca |language=French |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827225422/http://www.ecostage.qc.ca/tabid/58.html |archivedate=2011-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interns in this program receive a $3000 allowance to cover travel and accommodation expenses.

;British Columbia pilot project
In conjunction with the [[British Columbia]] [[Ministry of Children and Family Development (British Columbia)|Ministry of Children and Family Development]] and the Francophone Secretariat of British Columbia, Katimavik has a program in which British Columbia youth are paired with youth from Quebec in non-profit programs, including [[World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms]], with the aim of developing knowledge of sustainable agriculture and increasing employability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.katimavik.org/news/katimavik-and-bc-government-partners-promotion-youth-employability |title=Katimavik and the BC Government: partners in promotion of youth employability |publisher=Katimavik |date= |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201220436/http://www.katimavik.org/news/katimavik-and-bc-government-partners-promotion-youth-employability |archivedate=2012-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current funding==
Katimavik had a funding agreement with the Department of Canadian Heritage that ran until March 31, 2013. $15 million per year was contributed to the program under this agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.katimavik.org/sites/default/files/etatsfinanciers2011en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425091353/http://www.katimavik.org/sites/default/files/etatsfinanciers2011en.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Katimavik also has the organization the Katimavik Fund which receives donations on behalf of Katimavik, including those donations made via the Katimavik website.  The Eco-Internship program is currently supported by a funding agreement with the [[government of Quebec]].

==Application process and costs==
Youth who apply to the program are randomly selected though groups are based on demographic factors such as mother tongue, sex and province of origin. Selected applicants must submit a completed doctor's examination and criminal record check. The programs run for six-month periods from January to June and from July to December.

A selected group of eleven participants might include, for example, one from [[British Columbia]]/[[Yukon]], two from the [[Prairie provinces]], [[Nunavut]] and the [[Northwest Territories]], four from [[Ontario]], three from [[Quebec]] and one from the [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic provinces]]. These eleven youth will be between the ages of 17 and 21 (inclusive).

The Katimavik program receives financial support from the [[Citizen Participation Branch]] of the [[Department of Canadian Heritage]]. Because of this there is no cost for travel, food, or accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.katimavik.org/subsection-373/Destinations--Dates--Costs |title=Important dates |publisher=Katimavik |date= |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724142241/http://www.katimavik.org/subsection-373/Destinations--Dates--Costs |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, participants are paid an allowance of $3 a day to cover incidental living expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.katimavik.org/subsection-383/How-to-convince-your-parents |title=Convince your parents |publisher=Katimavik |date= |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724142508/http://www.katimavik.org/subsection-383/How-to-convince-your-parents |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; All activities planned by the group are arranged under various learning budgets. Since there is rarely time for any extracurricular activities outside of the program, any sort of group activity expenses are paid for out of the group budget and have to be agreed upon by the group and the Project Leader, i.e. hiking, visiting cultural centers, theater and media presentations, etc. There is a $300 non-refundable participation fee, payable once volunteers are officially accepted to Katimavik. This fee covers accident insurance and other administrative costs. There is also a $350 transportation deposit that is paid by volunteers upon departure and refunded upon completion of the program; if a volunteer leaves the program early this deposit is sacrificed in order to cover the increased costs associated with unplanned transportation home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.katimavik.org/eligibility-and-costs |title=Eligibility and costs |publisher=Katimavik |date= |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502115819/http://www.katimavik.org/eligibility-and-costs |archivedate=2012-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program life==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
Participants volunteer 35–40 hours a week and participate in workshops and activities with their fellow group members and Project Leader. Three groups in close communities form a "cluster" that may often meet up together for certain activities. Each cluster of four projects is monitored by a Project Coordinator.

During the program participants can expect to abide by certain standards of behaviour which fall into four main categories: participation, health and safety, and respect. Participants are monitored by their project leader, one who lives with them during each phase to lead the project. Project leaders can issue verbal warnings, commitments to improve, final warnings, and expulsions if the behavioural standards are not followed.

Katimavik builds participants' skills during the course of the program by implementing five learning programs, comprising various essential activities and workshops. Katimavik also implements a learning plan, which uses an [[AARR]] educational model (Anticipation, Action, Reflection, Recognition) and follows participants through each community. Participants receive six letters of appraisal (3 from the project leaders, and 3 from work supervisors), as well as a certificate of completion upon completion of the program.

While participants are in the program, they will spend a week of their time in each community living with a "host family". This is a family living in the community that has agreed to take on a participant (or two). This allows the participant to take some time off from group life, while living with members of the community, and learning what it's like to be a local.

Every group, every three months, is given budgets of varying amounts in each the following categories: Cultural Discovery, Environment, Healthy Life Style, Second Languages and Leadership. This money is spent in ways that correspond to program's learning objectives. The goal of the program's educational component is to build the capacities of participants in the following key areas:
* Interact with others in a variety of situations
* Adopt an open attitude towards the diversity of social and multicultural realities
* Communicate in both official languages
* Engage in diverse work experiences
* Apply habits that favor a healthy lifestyle
* Develop an integrated vision of environmental protection and sustainable development
* Engage as a citizen
* Prepare to integrate, as a citizen, into the job market, school or other life event

==Katimavik elimination, protests, and restoration attempts==
In the [[2012 Canadian federal budget]], Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that the program will be eliminated.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2012/03/29/federalbudget-flaherty-hilights.html |title=2012 Federal budget highlights |publisher=CBC.ca |date=March 29, 2012 |accessdate=2012-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stated reason was the comparatively high per-person cost of the program when compared to other government youth initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.budget.gc.ca/2012/plan/pdf/Plan2012-eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A Nationwide day of protest was held on July 21, 2012. Prominent politicians such as [[Elizabeth May]], leader of the Green Party, and NDP MP [[Charmaine Borg]] supported the rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metronews.ca/news/edmonton/301031/nationwide-day-of-protests-against-katimavik-cuts-set-for-saturday/|title=Nationwide day of protests against Katimavik cuts set for Saturday|work=Metro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conservative party encountered protest from politicians and supporters of the program after the budget was announced. An Ontarian mother, Colleen Cleve attempted to lodge a [[Class-Action]] lawsuit on behalf of the 600 Canadian youths who were selected but retroactively denied, her own two children among them. She states that the Federal government prematurely revoked and reneged on the contract with the youths, as government funding was not scheduled to expire until a year later in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/05/05/katimavik-cuts-lawsuit-colleen-cleve_n_1483551.html?ref=canada|title=Katimavik Cuts: Lawsuit May Be Coming Against Feds For Scrapping Trudeau-Era Youth Program's Funding|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NDP MP [[Charmaine Borg]] embarked on a cross-country tour to raise awareness and rally support in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.pe.ca/News/Local/2012-08-30/article-3064530/Saving-Katimavik/1|title=Saving Katimavik|work=theguardian.pe.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also introduced Bill 352 to restore $15M [[Canadian dollar|CAD]] Federal funding to the program.&lt;ref&gt;http://rabble.ca/blogs/bloggers/christophermajka/2012/09/charmaine-borg-versus-james-moore-irresistible-force-meets-i retrieved September 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberal party leader [[Justin Trudeau]] called for restoring funding to the program. His father Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] established the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2012/04/05/liberals-urge-govt-to-continue-funding-katimavik|title=Liberals urge gov't to continue funding Katimavik|work=Toronto Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Katimavik online petition was one of the many launched by the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] in 2012. Justin Trudeau claimed that the reasons the program was cancelled were ideological differences, comparing the $14M for the community-oriented Katimavik program with $207M for the military-oriented Cadet program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/katimavik-killed-for-ideological-reasons-trudeau-says-1.1277023 | date= April 5, 2012 |title= Katimavik killed for 'ideological' reasons, Trudeau says|work=CBC News| accessdate=2015-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a cross-country movement of Katimavik activists to relay packages to [[Stephen Harper]], including a journal signed by supporters along the way, a Katimavik T-shirt and signed petitions requesting reversal of the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brantfordexpositor.ca/2012/07/23/katimavik-relay-reaches-brantford-in-august|title=Katimavik relay reaches Brantford in August|work=Brantford Expositor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relay was routed through 50 communities served by Katimavik.&lt;ref&gt;http://explore-mag.com/6829/news/relay-to-save-katimavik&lt;/ref&gt;

Olympic gold medalist kayaker [[Adam van Koeverden]] claims that he owes his own existence to an encounter between his parents who worked as Katimavik team leaders upon university graduation and for five years later.&lt;ref&gt;http://m.theglobeandmail.com/commentary/katimavik-is-worth-saving/article4100797/?service=mobile retrieved September 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Van Koeverden describes Canadian youths as suffering from a crisis of identity as they try to define their relevance in life, and that Katimavik would be ideal to help them discover themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.theglobeandmail.com/commentary/katimavik-is-worth-saving/article4100797/?service=mobile|title=Katimavik is worth saving|work=theglobeandmail.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the [[University of Ottawa]] chapter of the [[Young Liberals of Canada]] devised a 'Pennies 4 Katimavik' penny drive inspired by the budget's announcement of the Canadian penny's obsolescence and of termination of government funding. The event was intended to raise $5K CAD and to inform the public of the merit of Katimavik and of the fate of its funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uranowski.wordpress.com/2012/04/28/pennies-4-katimavik-launches-today/|title="Pennies 4 Katimavik" Launches Today! |work=The Equivocator}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar drives were conducted through the country and announced by the project's Facebook page.

===Katimavik-like programs===
A Katimavik-affiliated program, 'Volunteering to Independence Program', where youths from Ontario were dispatched to [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]] began in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mykawartha.com/news-story/4035638-katimavik-pilot-project-starts-in-september/|title=Katimavik pilot project starts in September|work=mykawartha.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program varies from the old Katimavik program in that the program has no rotations and participants are from Ontario rather than across Canada.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10394">In philosophical discourse, '''lexis''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]]: λέξις "word") is a complete group of words in a language, vocabulary, the total set of all words in a language, and all words that have meaning or a function in grammar.

== Lexis according to Plato ==

According to [[Plato]], lexis is the manner of speaking. Plato said that lexis can be divided into [[mimesis]] (imitation properly speaking) and [[diegesis]] (simple narrative). Gerard Genette states: "Plato's theoretical division, opposing the two pure and heterogeneous modes of narrative and imitation, within poetic diction, elicits and establishes a practical classification of genres, which includes the two distinct modes...and a mixed mode, for example the Iliad".&lt;ref&gt;"Boundaries of a Narrative," ''New Literary History'', Vol. 8, No. 1, Readers and Spectators: Some Views and Reviews (Autumn, 1976), pp. 1–13. JSTOR. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the ''[[Iliad]]'', a Greek epic written by Homer, the mixed mode is very prevalent. According to [[Gerald Prince]], diegesis in the ''Iliad'' is the fictional storytelling associated with the fictional world and the enacting/re-telling of the story. Mimesis in the'' Iliad'' is the imitation of everyday, yet fantastical life in the ancient Greek world. Diegesis and mimesis combined represent the fullest extent of lexis; both forms of speech, narrating and re-enacting.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Prince. ''A Dictionary of Narratolog''y. 2003. University of Nebraska Press&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In conclusion, lexis is the larger overview of literature. Within lexis the two areas of differentiation of mimesis (imitation) are diegesis (narrative) and the "direct representation of the actors speaking to the public."&lt;ref&gt;Gennette 2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lexis according to Aristotle ==

According to Jose M. Gonzalez, "Aristotle instructs us to view of his psychology, as mediating the rhetorical task and entrusted with turning the orator's subject matter into such opinion of the listeners and gain their pistis."&lt;ref&gt;Jose M. Gonzalez, "Phantasia and Aristotle." JSTOR&lt;/ref&gt; Pistis is the Greek word for faith and is one of the rhetorical modes of persuasion.
 
Gonzalez also points out that, "By invoking phantasia, lexis against the background Aristotle instructs us to view of his psychology, as mediating the rhetorical task and entrusted with turning the orator's subject matter into such opinion of the listeners and gain their pistis." [[Phantasia (philosophy)|Phantasia]] is a Greek word meaning the process by which all images are presented to us. Aristotle defines phantasia as "our desire for the mind to mediate anything not actually present to the senses with a mental image." &lt;ref&gt;Jana Noel. "Interpreting Aristotle's Phantasia and Claiming its Role Within Phronesis". 1997.[http://www.ed.uiuc.edu/eps/PES-Yearbook/97_docs/noel.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle instructs the reader to use his or her imagination to create the fantastic, unordinary images, all the while using narrative and re-enactment to create a play either written or produced.

== Elements of rhetorical diction according to Aristotle ==

Although Aristotle at times seems to demean the art of diction or 'voice,' saying that it is not an "elevated subject of inquiry," he does go into quite a bit of detail on its importance and its proper use in rhetorical speech.  Often calling it "style," he defines good style as follows: that it must be clear and avoid extremes of baseness and loftiness.  Aristotle makes the cases for the importance of diction by saying that, "it is not enough to know what we ought to say; we must also say it as we ought.".&lt;ref&gt;''The Rhetoric and the Poetics of Aristotle''. Trans. W. Rhys Roberts. Ed.  [[Donald McQuade|Donald, McQuade]]. New York: The Modern Library, 1984, p. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; In an oratorical speech, one must consider not only the facts, but also how to put the facts into words and which words and, also, the "proper method of delivery." &lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle goes on to say that only the facts in an argument should be important but that since the listeners can be swayed by diction, it must also be considered. 
 
'''Voice''' 

At the time when Aristotle wrote his treatise on Rhetoric, orators had not paid much attention to voice.  They thought it was a subject only of concern to actors and poets. In ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|The Rhetoric]]'', Aristotles says, "proper method of delivery…affects the success of a speech greatly; but hitherto the subject has been neglected." &lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle defined voice as controlling one's voice, using rate, volume and pitch, to convey the appropriate emotions.  The manner of voice in which an idea or speech is conveyed affects not only the emotions of the audience but, also, their ability to understand this concept.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Although Aristotle gives this mention and explanation of voice, he does not go into specifics about how to produce appropriate voice or how to convey specific tones with one's voice.  This may or may not be due to his mild disdain for the topic as a whole. Modern scholars have explored voice more extensively. According to Taylor Stoehr, "voice is the pervasive reflection in written or spoken language, of an author's character, the marks by which we recognize his utterance as his.".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor Stoehr. "Tone and Voice."  ''College English'' Nov. 1968:  JSTOR. Pius XII Library, St. Louis, MO.  28 April 2008. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/374450]. p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;  However, just as in Aristotle's time set of specific rules or guidelines has yet been laid out for the production or interpretation of voice.  Due to the vast array of elements involved in the production of voice this task would be nearly, if not entirely, impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Stoehr 150&lt;/ref&gt;       

'''Language'''

As mentioned before, Aristotle thought the language of a speech should avoid being too lofty or too crude.  The speaker must use the ordinary language of everyday life.  However, because people best remember what is out of the ordinary, the speaker must use some language that gives the speech an air of importance.

The elevation of the language must correlate to the elevation of the subject or, in poetry, the character that is speaking.  In poetry, language and linguistic devices that convey a sense of importance are more appropriate, and should be used more often because the events of poetry are more removed from ordinary life.  They are less appropriate in rhetorical speech because the topics relate more directly to ordinary things and the people who are listening to the speech.  Most of all, the speaker must "give the impression of speaking naturally and not artificially." &lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; When one seems to speak with ease, the audience is more easily persuaded that the facts he is communicating are truthful. 

Also, a speaker must avoid using very many "strange words, compound words, and invented words.".&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald McQuade|McQuade]] 1984, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle considered this kind of language an excessive departure from the way people normally speak.  However, one acceptable departure from plain language is the use of [[metaphor]] because metaphors are used by all people in everyday conversation.

== Two forms of lexis ==

According to Aristotle, lexis, meaning the delivery of words, is the least important area of speech when in comparison to invention, arrangement and style.  However, lexis is still closely looked at and broken down into two forms.  The two types of lexis in rhetoric include: ''lexis graphike'' and ''lexis agonistike'' &lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Sonkowsky, ”An Aspect of Delivery in Ancient Rhetorical Theory.” p. 259 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/view/283710?seq=4&amp;Search=yes&amp;term=agonistike&amp;term=graphike&amp;term=lexis&amp;list=hide&amp;searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dlexis%2Bgraphike%2Band%2Blexis%2Bagonistike%26dc%3DAll%2BDisciplines&amp;item=1&amp;ttl=1&amp;returnArticleService=showArticle&amp;cookieSet=1]&lt;/ref&gt; The separate terms that describe the two forms of lexis, graphike and agonistike, have been conformed by several Latin terms.  Although the words directly relate to the type of lexis, the theories of Aristotle and Plato do not compare.

''Lexis graphike'' comes from the term ''zographia'', meaning realistic painting, and graphe, meaning writing. Plato believes that writing and painting are one of the same.   His theory proves that both do not have the capability to defend themselves through an argument, question and answer, which conveys that these forms can not prove truth. Although for Aristotle, ''lexis graphik''e is the most accurate delivery of language, which leads to his theory that proves that writing does not need to be questioned because it is already exact.&lt;ref&gt;Sonkowsky, 264&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Lexis agonistike'' however is from the term ''skiagraphia'', meaning a rough sketch or outline of painting.  Aristotle once again opposes Plato by believing that ''lexis agonistike'' does not need questions asked, but only answers.  The answer refers to the use of invention given to the actor because the writing portion is only outlined.&lt;ref&gt;Sonkowsky, 265&lt;/ref&gt;

To further understand the separate types of lexis, each type can be broken down by how the writing is prepared and delivered.  ''Lexis graphike'' is the most precise style of rhetoric and strongly appeals to intelligence.  The delivery of ''lexis graphike'' is designed for a careful reading from either the book or paper as opposed to a performance that leaves room for improvisation.&lt;ref&gt;Sonkowsky, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; This type of lexis is a simple, straight forward recitation rather than an elaborate presentation.  ''Lexis graphike'' is most accurately written and depends the least upon the person who is delivering the speech.  ''Lexis agonistike'' contradicts ''lexis graphike'' because it is typically carelessly written and meant for a full performance.  The lack of attention given to the written words allows the performer to improvise. This gives the presentation a style that reflects the entertainer rather the writer.&lt;ref&gt;Sonkowsky, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of monuments suffering damage from conflict in the [[Middle East]] during the 21st century. It is sorted by country.

==Afghanistan==
* The [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]] were a spectacular legacy of [[Buddhism]] in [[Afghanistan]]. The sandstone sculptures were among the tallest standing Buddhas in the world (the largest at 53 metres). The 35 structures had survived more than 1,500 years. The [[Taliban]] stated that they considered the monuments [[idolatrous]] and destroyed them with dynamite over several weeks, starting on 2 March 2001.&lt;ref name="Kieron Monks"&gt;{{cite news |title=The greatest buildings you'll never see: 20 priceless monuments lost in conflict |author=Kieron Monks |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/11/05/world/gallery/precious-monuments-lost-in-middle-east-conflicts/index.html|network=cnn |date=29 June 2015 |accessdate=2 July 2015 |work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Egypt==
* The [[Museum of Islamic Art, Cairo|Museum of Islamic Art]] in [[Cairo]] is home to one of the world's most impressive collections of Islamic art. It includes over 100,000 pieces that cover the entirety of [[Islamic history]]. The Cairo site was first built in 1881 and underwent a multi-million dollar renovation between 2003 and 2010.

: On January 24th, 2014 a car bomb attack targeting the Cairo police headquarters on the other side of the street caused considerable damage to the museum and destroyed many artifacts. It is estimated that 20-30% of the artifacts will need restoration. The blast also severely damaged the buildings facade, wiping out intricate designs in the Islamic style. The [[Egyptian National Library and Archives]] in the same building was also affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/01/140124-cairo-egypt-museum-islamic-art-bomb-artifacts-destroyed/|title=Cairo Blast Rips Into Islamic Art Museum, Damaging Key Global Collection|date=26 January 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-25877201 | work=BBC News | title=Cairo's Islamic Art Museum hit in blast | date=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/26/unesco-islamic-museum-cairo-blast|title=Unesco to assess blast damage at Islamic museum in Cairo|first=Associated Press in|last=Cairo|date=26 January 2014|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iraq==
* [[Great Mosque of Samarra]]. Once the largest [[mosque]] in the world, built in the 9th century on the [[Tigris River]] north of [[Baghdad]]. The mosque is famous for Malwiya Tower, a 52-meter minaret with spiraling ramps for worshipers to climb. The site was bombed in 2005, in an insurgent attack on a [[NATO]] position, destroying the top of the minaret and surrounding walls.&lt;ref name="Kieron Monks"/&gt;
* [[Tomb of Jonah]]. The purported resting place of biblical prophet Jonah, along with a tooth by some believed to be from the whale that consumed him in the myth. The site dated to the 8th century BC, and was of great importance to [[Christian]] and [[Muslim]] faiths. It was entirely blown up by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] militants in 2014 as part of their campaign against perceived apostasy.&lt;ref name="Kieron Monks"/&gt;
* [[Nimrud]]. The ancient [[Assyria]]n city around Nineveh Province, Iraq was home to countless treasures of the empire, including statues, monuments and jewels. Following the 2003 invasion the site has been devastated by looting, with many of the stolen pieces finding homes in museum abroad.&lt;ref name="Kieron Monks"/&gt;

[[File:Saint Elijah's Monastery 1.JPG|thumb|[[Dair Mar Elia]] monastery]]
* [[Dair Mar Elia]]. The Christian monastery near Mosul was founded in the late 6th century, and its sanctuary was built in the 11th century. The monastery was damaged during the invasion of 2003, before being completely destroyed by ISIL in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bailey|first1=Martin|title=Isil extremists destroy Iraq’s oldest Christian monastery|url=http://theartnewspaper.com/news/news/isil-extremists-destroy-iraq-s-oldest-christian-monastery/|work=[[The Art Newspaper]]|date=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lebanon==
* [[Old Beirut]] suffered through a brutal 15-year civil war, successive battles with [[Israel]], and sweeping urban development. It is referred to as the "Paris of the [[Middle East]]" and is known for its impressive landscape Ottoman, French and [[Art Deco]] architecture. Officials report that just 400 of 1200 protected historic buildings remain.&lt;ref name="Kieron Monks"/&gt;

==Libya==
* [[Cyrene (Libya)]]. A key city for the [[Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], established in [[630 BC]]. Famed as the basis for enduring myths and legends, such as that of the huntress heroine of the same name and bride of [[Apollo]]. The ruins were some of the best preserved from that period.

: In May 2011, a number of objects excavated from Cyrene in 1917 and held in the vault of the National Commercial Bank in [[Benghazi]] were stolen. Looters tunnelled into the vault and broke into two safes that held the artefacts which were part of the so-called 'Benghazi Treasure' . The whereabouts of these objects are currently unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/benghazi-treasure |title=Benghazi Treasure |publisher=Trafficking Culture Encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=2012-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: Parts of the UNESCO World Heritage site of Cyrene were destroyed in August 2013 by locals to make way for homes and shops. Approximately 200 vaults and tombs were leveled, as well as a section of a viaduct dating to the third century BC. Artifacts were thrown into a nearby river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.org/news/1242-130823-libya-cyrene-necropolis |title=Destruction of Cyrene Necropolis |publisher=Archaeological Institute of America |date= |accessdate=2013-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Palestine==
* Al-Omari Mosque, Gaza. Ancient monument in the heart of Jabalya's old town that dates back to the [[Mamluk]] Era. The walls, dome and roof were destroyed by Israeli airstrikes during the 2015 fighting in [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]], along with dozens more historic sites.&lt;ref name="Kieron Monks"/&gt; Mosques were targeted by Israel due to their use as launch sites for rockets and mortars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/long-neglected-gaza-heritage-wilts-in-war|title=Long-neglected Gaza heritage wilts in war|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syria==
* [[Armenian Genocide Memorial Church (Der Zor)]]. Memorial site to the 1.5 million killed between 1915 and 1923, the Deir Ez-zor became a yearly destination for pilgrims from around the world. The site included a church, museum, and fire that burned continuously. On 21 September 2014, the memorial complex was blown up by militants of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hayrumyan|first1=Naira|title=Middle East Terror: Memory of Armenian Genocide victims targeted by ISIS militants|url=http://www.armenianow.com/commentary/analysis/57070/armenia_church_syria_isis_aram_catholicos|work=[[ArmeniaNow]]|date=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=IS said to destroy Armenian Genocide memorial|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/is-reportedly-destroys-armenian-genocide-memorial/|work=[[The Times of Israel]]|date=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who destroyed the Armenian Genocide Martyrs’ Memorial Church in Deir Ezzor?|url=https://conflictantiquities.wordpress.com/2014/11/12/iraq-syria-islamic-state-destruction-deir-ez-zor-armenian-genocide-memorial-church-responsibility/|website=conflict antiquities|accessdate=20 March 2015|date=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ancient city of [[Bosra]]. Continually inhabited for 2,500 years, and became the capital of the Romans' Arabian empire/ The centerpiece is a magnificent Roman theatre dating back to the second century that survived intact until the current century. Archeologists have revealed the site is now severely damaged from mortar shelling.&lt;ref name="Kieron Monks"/&gt;

[[File:Aleppo Citadel 04.jpg|right|thumb|The fortified entrance of the Citadel of Aleppo]]
* [[Citadel of Aleppo]]. The fortress spans at least four millennia, from the days of [[Alexander the Great]], through Roman, Mongol, and Ottoman rule. The site has barely changed since the 16th century and is one of Syria's most popular [[World Heritage sites]].&lt;ref name="Kieron Monks"/&gt;

: In August 2012, during the [[Battle of Aleppo (2012)|Battle of Aleppo]] of the [[Syrian civil war]], the external gate of the citadel was damaged after being shelled during a clash between the [[Free Syrian Army]] and the [[Syrian Army]] to gain control over the citadel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Aleppo citadel hit by shelling, says opposition |agency=Agence France Presse |url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2012/Aug-11/184198-aleppo-citadel-hit-by-shelling-says-opposition.ashx#axzz23BbEcFXx |newspaper=The Daily Star Lebanon |date=11 August 2012 |accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Al-Madina Souq]]. The covered markets in the Old City are a famous trade center for the region's finest produce, with dedicated sub-souks for fabrics, food, and accessories. The tunnels became the scene of fierce fighting and many of the oldest are now damaged beyond recognition. This was described by UNESCO as a tragedy.&lt;ref name="Abigail Hauslohner and Ahmed Ramadan"/&gt;
* [[Deir ez-Zor suspension bridge]]. This French-built suspension bridge was a popular pedestrian crossing and vantage point for its views of the Euphrates River. The bridge was destroyed by [[Free Syrian Army]] militiamen during the [[Syrian civil war]] in May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.breakingnews.sy/ar/article/16724.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Khalid ibn al-Walid Mosque]]. Among Syria's most famous Ottoman-style mosques, which also shows [[Mamluk]] influence through its light and dark contrasts. As of 2007, activities in the mosque were organized by [[sheikh|shaykh]]s Haytham al-Sa'id and Ahmad Mithqan.&lt;ref&gt;Rougier, 2007, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; Stamps depicting the mosque have been issued in several denominations.

* [[Palmyra]]. An "oasis in the Syrian desert" according to [[UNESCO]], this Aramaic city has stood since the second millennium BC and featured some of the most advanced architecture of the priod. The site subsequently evolved through [[Greco-Roman]] and [[Persia]]n periods, providing unique historic insight into those cultures.

* The [[Great Mosque of Aleppo]]. A world heritage site originally built in 715 by the Umayyad dynasty, ranking it among the oldest mosques in the world. The epic structure evolved through successive eras, gaining its famous minaret in the late 11th century.&lt;ref name="Kieron Monks"/&gt;
[[File:Umayyad-mosque-aleppo-2013.png|Mosque in 2013, after destruction of the minaret|thumb|right]]
: On 13 October 2012 the mosque was seriously damaged during clashes between the armed groups of the [[Free Syrian Army]] and the [[Syrian Army]] forces.

: On 24 April 2013 the minaret of the mosque was reduced to rubble during an exchange of heavy weapons fire between government forces and rebels during the ongoing [[Syrian civil war]]. The [[Syrian Arab News Agency]] (SANA) reported that members of [[Jabhat al-Nusra]] detonated explosives inside the minaret, while opposition activists said that the minaret was destroyed by [[Syrian Army]] tank fire as part of an offensive.&lt;ref name=nytminaret1&gt;{{cite news|last=Saad|first=Hwaida|title=Storied Syrian Mosque’s Minaret Is Destroyed|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/25/world/middleeast/syria.html?hp&amp;_r=0|accessdate=24 April 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=24 April 2013|author2=Gladstone, Rick}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Countering assertions by the state media of Jabhat al-Nusra's involvement, opposition  sources described them as rebels from the [[Tawhid Brigades]] who were fighting government forces around the mosque.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; The opposition's main political bloc, the [[Syrian National Coalition]] (SNC), condemned the minaret's destruction, calling it "an indelible disgrace" and "a crime against human civilization."&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Spencer|title=Syria: 11th-century minaret of Great Umayyad Mosque of Aleppo destroyed|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/10016169/Syria-11th-century-minaret-of-Great-Umayyad-Mosque-of-Aleppo-destroyed.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=24 April 2013|accessdate=25 April 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of urban legends==
* '''[[999 phone charging myth]]''' is an urban legend which claims that calling the emergency services then hanging up charges mobile phone batteries.
* A '''[[Black dog (ghost)|black dog]]''' is the name given to a being found primarily in the folklores of Britain and Ireland. The black dog is essentially a nocturnal apparition, often said to be associated with the devil or a [[hellhound]]. Its appearance was regarded as a portent of death. It is generally supposed to be larger than a normal dog, and often has large, glowing eyes. It is often associated with electrical storms (such as Black Shuck's appearance at Bungay, Suffolk), and also with crossroads, places of execution and ancient pathways.
* '''[[Baby Train]]''' is an urban legend which claims that a small town had an unusually high birth rate because a train would pass through the town at 5:00 am and blow its whistle, waking up all the residents. Since it was too late to go back to sleep and too early to get up, couples would find other ways to amuse themselves in bed. This resulted in the mini-baby boom.&lt;ref name="Nicolaisen, W.F.H."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nicolaisen|first1=W.F.H.|title=The Baby Train and Other Lusty Urban Legends by Jan Harold Brunvand|journal=Folklore|date=1997|volume=108|pages=134–135|jstor=1260739|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis, Ltd. on behalf of Folklore Enterprises, Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Snopes, baby train"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Baby Train|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-baby-train/|website=Snopes|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Black-eyed children]]''' (or '''black-eyed kids''') are an urban legend of supposed paranormal creatures that resemble children between the ages of 6 and 16, with pale skin and black eyes, who are reportedly seen hitchhiking or panhandling, or are encountered on doorsteps of residential homes. Tales of black-eyed children have appeared in pop culture since the late 1990s.
* '''[[Black Shuck]]''', '''Old Shuck''', '''Old Shock''', or simply '''Shuck''' is the name given to a ghostly [[Black dog (ghost)|black dog]] which is said to roam the coastline and countryside of [[East Anglia]]. Accounts of the animal form part of the folklore of [[Norfolk]], [[Suffolk]], the [[Cambridgeshire]] [[fens]] and [[Essex]].
* The '''[[Blue star tattoo legend]]''' refers to a modern legend that [[LSD]] tabs are being distributed as lick-and-stick temporary tattoos to children.
* '''[[Bloody Mary (folklore)|Bloody Mary]]''' is a folklore legend consisting of a ghost or spirit conjured to reveal the future. She is said to appear in a mirror when her name is called multiple times. The Bloody Mary apparition may be benign or malevolent, depending on historic variations of the legend. The Bloody Mary appearances are mostly "witnessed" in group participation games.
* '''[[Bunny Man]]''' is an urban legend that probably originated from two incidents in [[Fairfax County, Virginia]], in 1970, but has been spread throughout the Washington D.C. area. There are many variations to the legend, but most involve a man wearing a rabbit costume ("bunny suit") who attacks people with an axe.
* The '''[[chupacabra]]''' (Spanish pronunciation: [tʃupaˈkaβɾa], from chupar "to suck" and cabra "goat", literally "goat sucker") is a legendary cryptid rumored to inhabit parts of the Americas, with the first sightings reported in Puerto Rico. The name comes from the animal's reported habit of attacking and drinking the blood of livestock, especially goats.
* '''[[Cow tipping]]''' purported activity of sneaking up on any unsuspecting or sleeping upright cow and pushing it over for entertainment.
* '''[[Creepypasta]]s''' are [[Horror and terror|horror]]-related [[legend]]s or images that have been copy-and-pasted around the [[Internet]]. These Internet entries are often brief, user-generated, paranormal stories intended to scare readers. They include gruesome tales of murder, suicide, and otherworldly occurrences. People often falsely believe them to be true.
* The '''[[Curse of the Bambino]]''' was a superstition evolving from the failure of the Boston Red Sox baseball team to win the World Series in the 86-year period from 1918 to 2004. While some fans took the curse seriously, most used the expression in a tongue-in-cheek manner.
* '''[[Hippo eats dwarf|Hippo Eats Dwarf]]'''. An internet-spread urban legend about a circus performer being accidentally swallowed by a hippopotamus.&lt;ref name="Boese2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boese|first=Alex|title=Hippo Eats Dwarf|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EJQzXOJtRfcC|date=5 February 2010|publisher=Pan Macmillan|isbn=978-0-330-52130-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[The Hook]]''', also called '''Hookman''', is a classic example of an urban legend.  Originating in post-war America, it recounts a story of a murderer with a hook [[prosthesis]] in place of a hand.
* '''[[JATO Rocket Car]]''' started as a [[Darwin Awards|Darwin Award]] winner where a driver strapped a pair of Jet Assisted Take Off [[JATO]] units to the rear of his car and ended up smashing into the side of a hill in Arizona.  No police agency in Arizona took a report of this type of accident.  The [[Arizona Department of Public Safety]] even issued a press release on their website debunking the report.  
* '''[[Killer in the backseat]]''' (also known as '''High Beams''') is a common car-crime urban legend well known mostly in the United States and United Kingdom. The legend involves a woman who is driving and being followed by a strange car or truck. The mysterious pursuer flashes his [[headlamp|high beams]], [[tailgating|tailgates]] her and sometimes even rams her vehicle. When she finally makes it home, she realizes that the driver was trying to warn her that there was a man (a [[murderer]], [[rapist]], or escaped [[mental patient]]) hiding in her back seat. Each time the man sat up to attack her, the driver behind had used his high beams to scare the killer, in which he ducks down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bronner |first= Simon J. |title= American Children's Folklore |authorlink= Simon J. Bronner |location= Little Rock |publisher= August House Publishers |year= 1988 |page= 149 |ISBN= 978-08748-306-8-2 |quote= ...

I followed the car home and flashed my brights each time I saw the figure. After she ran in the house, I told her to call the police...}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[The Licked Hand]]''', known sometimes as the '''Doggy Lick''' or '''Humans Can Lick Too''', is an urban legend popular among teenagers.  The story describes a killer who secretly spends the night under a girl's bed, licking her hand when offered, which she takes to be her dog.
* '''"[[Paul is dead]]"''' is an urban legend suggesting that [[Paul McCartney]] of the English rock band [[The Beatles]] died in 1966 and was secretly replaced by a look-alike.
* '''[[Sewer alligator]]''' is an urban legend based upon reports of alligator sightings in rather unorthodox locations, in particular New York City.
* '''Skeleton in a tree''' is an urban legend alleging that years after the [[St. Clair's Defeat|defeat of St. Clair]] in 1791 at [[Fort Recovery, Ohio|Fort Recovery]], [[Mercer County, Ohio]], the skeleton of a Captain Roger Vanderberg was found in [[Miami County, Ohio]] inside a tree, along with a diary; in fact no one of this name was a casualty of the 1791 battle, the story originated in 1864 from a Scottish novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ohioarchaeology.wordpress.com/2010/01/06/proposed-work-at-fort-recovery-may-solve-some-of-its-mysteries/#comment-1137%20See|title=Proposed Work at Fort Recovery May Solve Some of its Mysteries see letter in Comments by James L Murphy dated 7 January 2010 citing the story "Lost Sir Massingberd" |date=2010-01-06|newspaper=Ohio Historical Society Archaeology Blog|access-date=2018-02-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''[[Slender Man]]''' (also known as '''Slenderman''') is a fictional character that originated as an Internet meme created by Something Awful forums user Victor Surge in 2009. It is depicted as resembling a thin, unnaturally tall man with a blank and usually featureless face and wearing a black suit. The Slender Man is commonly said to stalk, abduct, or traumatize people, particularly children. The Slender Man is not tied to any particular story, but appears in many disparate works of fiction, mostly composed online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curlew|first1=Kyle|title=The legend of the Slender Man: The boogieman of surveillance culture|journal=First Monday|date=2017|volume=22|issue=6|doi=10.5210/fm.v22i6.6901}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[The Spider Bite]]''' or '''The Red Spot''' is a modern urban legend that emerged in Europe during the 1970s. It features a young woman who is bitten on the cheek by a spider. The bite swells into a large boil and soon bursts open to reveal hundreds of tiny spiders escaping from her cheek.
*'''"Vanishing Lady"''' aka "Vanishing Hotel Room": during an international exposition in Paris, a daughter leaves her ill mother in a hotel room; when she comes back her mother is gone and the hotel staff claim to have no knowledge of the missing woman. It is later revealed that the mother was dying of a plague and, fearing for the negative impact on the hotel's public image, the staff just disposed of the mother, redecorated the room and pretended like nothing had happened. Inspiration for the movie ''[[So Long at the Fair]]''. Based upon a turn-of-the-century [[Philadelphia]] newspaper story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=O’Toole |first1=Garson |title=Legend: The Vanishing Lady and the Vanishing Hotel Room – Quote Investigator |url=https://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/09/14/vanishing-lady/ |website=Quote Investigator |accessdate=23 October 2018 |date=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Vanishing hitchhiker|The Vanishing hitchhiker]]''' (or variations such as the '''ghostly hitchhiker''', the '''disappearing hitchhiker''', the '''phantom hitchhiker''' or simply the '''hitchhiker''') story is an urban legend in which people traveling by vehicle meet with or are accompanied by a hitchhiker who subsequently vanishes without explanation, often from a moving vehicle. Vanishing hitchhikers have been reported for centuries and the story is found across the world with many variants. The popularity and endurance of the legend has helped it spread into popular culture.
* '''[[Aerial firefighting#Urban legends about aerial firefighting|Water bomber picking up scuba diver]]''': about a [[aerial firefighting|water bomber]], or a helicopter with a dangling water bucket, scooping up a scuba diver and dumping him or her on a wildfire site. Urban legend debunking site [[Snopes.com]] reports there are no proven cases of this happening in reality.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9082">The market for '''luxury goods in China''' composes a significant proportion of all luxury goods sales worldwide.  In 2012, China surpassed Japan as the world's largest luxury market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China bans television ads for bling|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/08/business/china-bans-luxury-product-ads/index.html?hpt=hp_bn5|accessdate=February 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to a blue paper on commercial development in China, released in 2010 by the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]] (CASS), China's luxury goods market had increased to US$9.4 billion by the end of 2009. This accounted for 27.5% of the world's luxury goods market,&lt;ref name="China to be world's biggest luxury goods market"&gt;[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90778/90860/6991640.html China to be world's biggest luxury goods market in five years: blue paper]&lt;/ref&gt; an increase from 25% in 2008.&lt;ref name="people's daily"&gt;[http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90778/90857/90860/6710402.html China becomes world's 2nd largest luxury market], [[People's Daily Online]], July 27, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; On current growth rates, the luxury goods market in China is expected to grow to [[US$]]14.6 billion by 2014.&lt;ref name="korea it times"&gt;[http://www.koreaittimes.com/story/8980/keywords-learn-china Keywords to learn China], ''[[The Korea IT Times]]'', May 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market characteristics==
Chinese luxury goods consumers are younger than their [[Europe]]an counterparts, belonging to the 18-50 age group, compared to Europe's consumers who are generally in the over 40 age group. For this reason, China's luxury goods market is expected to grow faster than that of Europe's.&lt;ref name="korea it times"/&gt; Many of the young luxury goods buyers are self-employed or professionals. According to the consulting firm [[McKinsey &amp; Company]], 80% of Chinese luxury goods buyers are under 45, compared with 30% of luxury goods buyers in the United States and 19% in Japan.&lt;ref name="China appetite"&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30670835/ns/business-world_business/ China still has an appetite for luxury goods]&lt;/ref&gt; Retail sales in China account for only 7% of global retail sales of luxury consumer goods; however, Chinese buyers account for 25% of global retail sales of luxury consumer goods. Many shops in international travel destinations have specialized staff devoted to Chinese customers.&lt;ref name=Caixin022613 /&gt; 

According to 2007 Global Luxury Survey by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, most luxury goods buyers in China buy luxury products as a [[status symbol]]. The top five luxury watch brands in the country are [[Rolex]], [[Omega SA|Omega]], [[Cartier SA|Cartier]], [[Vacheron Constantin]], and [[Breitling SA|Breitling]].&lt;ref name="2007 Global Luxury Survey"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1659346_1659333,00.html Global Luxury Survey: China], ''[[TIME]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a confidential report titled ''"China Luxury Market study 2010"'' in November 2010, the management consulting firm [[Bain &amp; Company]] noted the top three luxury brands in China are [[Louis Vuitton]], [[Chanel]] and [[Gucci]]. According to the report, watches and bags led the growth of the luxury market in 2010. The report documented the top three luxury brands in the country for the following products:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bain.com/bainweb/PDFs/cms/Public/China_Luxury_Market_Study_2010.pdf China Luxury Market study 2010], [[Bain &amp; Company]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a ban instituted in October, 2012 on government agencies purchasing luxury goods, often used as "gifts", sales of luxury goods in China remained strong, but slowed, even falling slightly for some luxury retailers in the 4th quarter of 2012.&lt;ref name=Caixin022613&gt;{{cite news|title=China's Frills and Posh Market Springs a Leak: Wealthy Chinese consumers continue to drive global demand for luxury goods, but the engine is losing steam|url=http://english.caixin.com/2013-02-26/100494654.html|accessdate=February 26, 2013|newspaper=Caixin|date=February 26, 2013|author=Qu Yunxu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of February 2014 2/3rds of the luxury goods purchased by the wealthy in the People's Republic of China were purchased by tourists in Europe and the United States where, particularly in Europe, high-end retailers have hired staffed fluent in Mandarin.&lt;ref name = NYT020314 &gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/04/business/international/catering-to-the-chinese-shoppers-grand-tour.html "Catering to the Chinese Shopper’s Grand Tour"] article by Nicola Clark in ''[[The New York Times]]'' February 3, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Luxury cars==
Major global luxury brands like [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[BMW]], [[Audi]], and [[Lexus]] have operations in China. Audi, which has dominated China's luxury car market for more than two decades, is the market leader in the luxury car segment, with China being Audi's second largest market in the world. However Audi's market share in this category is gradually falling as BMW and Mercedes-Benz are adopting new strategies to boost sales. According to data from [[Global Insight]], Audi's market share in China decreased from 66% in 2004 to 42% in 2009, while the market share of BMW and Mercedes-Benz increased from 7% to 23%, and 9% to 16%, respectively. BMW is enlarging its current plant in China and building a second one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-04-21/audi-s-two-decade-china-dominance-threatened-by-bmw-mercedes.html Audi’s Two-Decade China Dominance Threatened by BMW, Mercedes], April 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Audi is still the dominant choice of car in the government fleet market.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/15/business/global/in-china-car-brands-evoke-an-unexpected-set-of-stereotypes.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all|title=In China, Car Brands Evoke an Unexpected Set of Stereotypes|author=ANDREW JACOBS|author2=ADAM CENTURY  |date= November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; BMW sales are growing but is perceived to be for the newly rich.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Mercedes is seen to be for old folks.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Brands such as BMW and Audi are designing customized cars for the Chinese luxury car market.

According to Stephan Winkelmann, CEO of [[Lamborghini]], "China's super car market is growing faster than our expectations, while the Western markets are declining. The strong demand will soon make China our second biggest market after the United States. If the high taxes on luxury cars are removed, China could very well become the biggest market."&lt;ref name="Rich Chinese"&gt;[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90778/90860/6967022.html Rich Chinese fueling luxury car market growth], ''[[People's Daily Online]]'', April 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013 the trend continued as the number of luxury cars and [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]]s shown expanded at the Shanghai auto show and plans were announced by both foreign and domestic auto manufacturers to introduce new models in China and increase production of larger cars.&lt;ref name=NYT42113&gt;{{cite news|title=Chinese Auto Buyers Grow Hungry for Larger Cars|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/22/automobiles/autoshow/chinese-auto-market-shifts-toward-larger-cars.html|accessdate=April 22, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 21, 2013|author=Keith Bradsher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Makapansgat pebble''' ([[ca.]] 3,000,000 [[Before Present|BP]]) is a 260-gram reddish-brown [[jasper]]ite [[Cobble (geology)|cobble]] with natural chipping and wear patterns that make it look like a crude rendition of a human face. 

The pebble is interesting in that it was found some distance from any possible natural source, associated with the bones of ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]'' in a cave in [[Makapansgat]], [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred S.|title=Gardner's Art Through the Ages: A Global History|year=2011|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-495-79986-3|pages=15–16|edition=Enhanced Thirteenth}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Though it is definitely not a manufactured object, it has been suggested that some [[australopithecine]] might have recognized it as a symbolic face, in possibly the earliest example of symbolic thinking or aesthetic sense in the human heritage, and brought the pebble back to the cave. This would make it a candidate for the oldest known [[manuport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunspot.sli.unimelb.edu.au/aura/MAKAPANSGAT.htm |title=Makapansgat cobble analysed |last=Bednarik |first=Robert G |date= |work= |publisher=[[University of Melbourne]] |accessdate=2010-05-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030330065452/http://sunspot.sli.unimelb.edu.au/aura/MAKAPANSGAT.htm |archivedate=2003-03-30 }} Archived by the [[Internet Archive]], original URI was &lt;nowiki&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunspot.sli.unimelb.edu.au/aura/MAKAPANSGAT.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030330065452/http://sunspot.sli.unimelb.edu.au/aura/MAKAPANSGAT.htm |archivedate=2003-03-30 |df= }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The teacher Wilfred I. Eizman found it in the Makapansgat, a dolerite cave in the Makapan Valley north of [[Mokopane]], [[Limpopo]], South Africa in 1925. Almost 50 years later, Raymond Dart was the first to describe it in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;OriginsNet: [http://www.originsnet.org/oldowangallery1/pages/a)makapansgat.htm Pebble of many faces]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Makapansgat pebble cannot be seen as [[art]] if a usual definition of the term is used, as the object was found and not made. Nevertheless that an Australopithecus may have recognized a face would reveal that the early hominid had some sort of capacity for symbolic thinking, necessary for the development of art and language.&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt; If the early hominid has seen this object really as a face, or had magical speculations towards this object or just enjoyed the pebble remains unclear.

'''Multiracism''' is the conflict between the various [[ethnic]] communities that conform a [[State (polity)|state]], based on the belief that racial differences produce an [[inherent superiority]] of a particular [[race (classification of human beings)|race]].

The term focuses upon the social and economic life of the [[ethnicities]], demonstrating that while some have found economic success, others have remained underprivileged. Many ethnic groups have tried to maintain a unity especially through [[language]], [[religion]], [[politics]] and [[culture]]. Similarly, many ethnic groups have faced varying types of hostility from both the state and other ethnic groups.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2980">The '''Ninety-Two Resolutions''' were drafted by [[Louis-Joseph Papineau]] and other members of the ''[[Parti canadien|Parti patriote]]'' of [[Lower Canada]] in 1834. The resolutions were a long series of demands for political reforms in the [[United Kingdom|British]]-governed colony.

Papineau had been elected speaker of the legislative assembly of [[Lower Canada]] in 1815. His party constantly opposed the unelected colonial government, and in 1828 he helped draft an early form of the resolutions, essentially a list of grievances against the colonial administration. To ensure that the views of the Legislative Assembly be understood by the [[British House of Commons]], the ''Parti patriote'' had sent its own delegation to London in order to submit a memoir and a petition signed by 87,000 people.

On February 28, 1834, Papineau presented the Ninety-Two Resolutions to the Legislative Assembly which were approved and sent to [[London]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/92-resolutions/&lt;/ref&gt;. The resolutions included, among other things, demands for an elected Legislative Council and an Executive Council responsible before the house of representatives. Under the [[Constitutional Act of 1791]], the government of Lower Canada was given an elected legislative assembly, but members of the upper houses were appointed by the Governor of the colony. 

In the resolutions, the elected representatives once again reiterated their loyalty to the British Crown, but expressed frustration that the government of London had been unwilling to correct the injustices caused by the past governments of the colony.

Papineau's resolutions were ignored for almost three years; meanwhile, the Legislative Assembly did all it could to oppose the un-elected upper houses while avoiding outright rebellion. [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|British Colonial Secretary]] [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord Russell]] eventually responded to them by issuing ten resolutions of his own (the [[Russell Resolutions]]). All of the Legislative Assembly's demands were rejected. {{wikisource|The Ninety-Two Resolutions of the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada|The Ninety-Two Resolutions}}

The ten resolutions reached Canada in 1837, and many of Papineau's reformists began to agitate for a rebellion. See the [[Lower Canada Rebellion]].

In 1671 an argument broke out in the French [[Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture|Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture]] in Paris about whether drawing or color was more important in painting. On one side stood the '''Poussinists''' (Fr. ''Poussinistes'') who were a group of French artists, named after the painter [[Nicolas Poussin]], who believed that drawing was the most important thing.&lt;ref name=BritP&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/473126/Poussinist Poussinist] ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', 2014. Retrieved 27 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side were the '''Rubenists''' (Fr. ''Rubénistes''), named after [[Peter Paul Rubens]], who prioritize color.&lt;ref name=BritR&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/511893/Rubenist Rubenist] ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', 2014. Retrieved 27 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a strong nationalistic flavour to the debate as Poussin was French but Rubens was [[Flemish]], though neither was alive at the time. After over forty years the final resolution of the matter in favor of the Rubenists was signalled when [[Antoine Watteau|Antoine Watteau's]] ''[[The Embarkation for Cythera]]'' was accepted as his [[reception piece]] by the French Academy in 1717.&lt;ref name=BritR/&gt; By that time the French [[Rococo]] was in full swing.

==The argument==
The Poussinists believed in the [[Platonic realism|Platonic]] idea of the existence in the mind of ideal objects that could be reconstructed in concrete form by the selection, using reason, of elements from nature. For the Poussinists, therefore, color was a purely decorative addition to form and drawing (design or ''[[disegno]]''), the use of line to depict form, was the essential skill of painting. Their leader was [[Charles Lebrun]]&lt;ref name=HF&gt;[[Hugh Honour|Honour, H.]] and J. Fleming, (2009) ''A World History of Art''. 7th edn. London: Laurence King Publishing, p. 609. {{ISBN|9781856695848}}&lt;/ref&gt; (died 1690), Director of the Academy, and their heroes were [[Raphael]], [[the Carracci]], and Poussin himself&lt;ref name=BritP/&gt; whose severe and stoical works exemplified their philosophy. Their touchstones were the forms of classical art.
[[Image:Peter Paul Rubens 083.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Hippopotamus and Crocodile Hunt|Hippopotamus Hunt]]'', Rubens, 1616.]]
They were opposed by the Rubenists who believed that colour, not drawing, was superior as it was more true to nature.&lt;ref name=Janson/&gt; Their models were the works of Rubens who had prioritised the accurate depiction of nature over the imitation of classical art. The Rubenists argued that the aim of painting was to deceive the eye by creating an imitation of nature.&lt;ref name=BritR/&gt; Drawing, according to the Rubenists, although based on reason, appealed only to a few experts whereas colour could be enjoyed by everyone. The ideas of the Rubenists therefore had revolutionary political connotations as they elevated the position of the lay person and challenged the idea that had held sway since the [[Renaissance]] that painting, as a [[Liberal arts education|liberal art]], could only be appreciated by the educated mind.&lt;ref name=Janson&gt;[[H. W. Janson|Janson, H.W.]] (1995) ''History of Art''. 5th edn. Revised and expanded by Anthony F. Janson. London: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]], p. 604. {{ISBN|0500237018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1672, [[Charles Le Brun]], Chancellor of the French Academy, attempted to halt the argument by stating officially that "the function of colour is to satisfy the eyes, whereas drawing satisfies the mind."&lt;ref name=BritP/&gt; He failed, and the debate was continued in the pamphlets of [[Roger de Piles]], who favoured the colourists and set out the arguments in his 1673 ''Dialogue sur le Coloris'' (Dialogue on Colour), and his 1677 ''Conversations sur la Peinture'' (Conversations on Painting).

The argument was similar to the argument over the merits of ''disegno'' and ''colore'' in Italy in the fifteenth century but with a particularly French character as the importance of drawing was one of the key tenets of the French Academy and any attack on it was effectively an attack on everything the Academy stood for, including its political functions in support of the King.
 
To a certain extent, the debate was simply about whether it was acceptable to paint purely in order to give pleasure to the viewer without the nobler purposes typical of a "history" painting.&lt;ref name=Lev&gt;Levey, Michael. (1993) ''Painting and sculpture in France 1700-1789''. New Haven: [[Yale University Press]], p. 1. {{ISBN|0300064942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resolution==
[[Image:L'Embarquement pour Cythere, by Antoine Watteau, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumb|right|Watteau's ''[[The Embarkation for Cythera]]'', 1717.]] 
A success for the Rubenists was achieved when Roger de Piles was elected a member (as an amateur) of the French Academy in 1699 and the final signal that the Rubenists had won came when [[Antoine Watteau]]'s ''The Embarkation for Cythera'' was accepted as his reception piece by the Academy in 1717.&lt;ref name=BritR/&gt;

Watteau's acceptance was, however, perhaps not everything that he could have hoped for. When he applied to join the Academy, there was no suitable category for his ''[[fête galante]]'' works, so the academy simply created one rather than reject his application, describing him as a "peintre des festes galantes".&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, Fred, S. (Ed.) (2011) ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages: A global history''.  Enhanced 13th edn. Boston: Wadsworth, p. 755. {{ISBN|978-0-495-79986-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, M. &amp; D. (2010) "fête galante" in ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms''. oxfordreference.com, [[Oxford University Press]]. Retrieved 8 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; While this acknowledged Watteau as the originator of that genre, and was a significant mark of acceptance both of him and his style of painting, it also prevented him being recognised as a [[History painting|history painter]], the highest class of painter, and the only one from which the academy's professors were drawn. Charles-Antoine Coypel, the son of its then director, tellingly said: "The charming paintings of this gracious painter would be a bad guide for whoever wished to paint the Acts of the Apostles."&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey Wine and Annie Scottez-De Wambrechies. "Watteau" in ''Grove Art Online''. [http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T090852pg1 oxfordartonline.com] Oxford University Press. Retrieved 8 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Watteau is considered the greatest of the Rubenist artists. Other important Rubenists include [[François Boucher]] and [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]]. [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]] benefited from the new found interest in [[still-life]] and [[genre painting]].&lt;ref&gt;Janson, 1995, p. 607.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The debate and the overlapping development of the Rococo in eighteenth century France have been seen as a form of revival. [[Michael Levey]] has pointed out that it was during the seventeenth century that the new categories of [[Genre art|genre]], [[Landscape art|landscape]] and still life had become established with their emphasis on the observation of nature, and therefore the arguments of the Rubenists amounted to a revival of existing traditions of naturalism and a call for a greater discipline in painting rather than representing an attitude of general licence or ''laissez faire'' as is sometimes assumed.&lt;ref name=Lev/&gt;

The argument also took place during the beginning of the [[Enlightenment Era|Enlightenment]] and the Rubenists found support in [[John Locke|John Locke's]] ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690) which argued that all ideas derived from experience and that none were innate. [[Jean-Baptiste Dubos]] observed that what was comprehended through the mind paled compared to what was apprehended through the senses.&lt;ref name=HF/&gt;

{{Violence against women}}
'''''Raptio''''' (in [[Archaic English|archaic]] or [[literary English]] rendered as '''''rape''''') is a [[Latin]] term for the large-scale abduction of women, i.e. [[kidnapping]] for [[marriage]] or [[enslavement]] (particularly [[sexual slavery]]). The equivalent term '''''Frauenraub''''', originally from [[German language|German]], is used in English in the field of [[art history]].

[[Bride kidnapping]] is distinguished from ''raptio'' in that the former is the abduction of one woman by one man (and his friends and relatives), whereas the latter is the abduction of women by groups of men, possibly in a time of war.

{{Wiktionary|rape}}

==Terminology==
The English word ''rape'' retains the Latin meaning in [[literary language]], but the meaning is obscured by the more current meaning of "sexual violation". The word is akin to ''rapine'', ''[[rapture]]'', ''[[wikt:raptor|raptor]]'', ''rapacious'' and ''ravish'', and referred to the more general violations, such as [[looting]], destruction, and capture of citizens, that are inflicted upon a town or country during [[war]], e.g. the [[Rape of Nanking]]. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' gives the definition "the act of carrying away a person, especially a woman, by force" besides the more general "the act of taking anything by force" (marked as ''obsolete'') and the more specific "violation or ravishing of a woman".

English ''rape'' was in use since the 14th century in the general sense of "seize prey, take by force", from ''raper'', an [[Old French]] legal term for "to seize", in turn from [[Latin]] ''rapere'' "seize, carry off by force, abduct". The Latin term was also used for sexual violation, but not always. It is contested that the legendary event known as "[[The Rape of the Sabine Women]]", while ultimately motivated sexually, did not entail sexual violation of the Sabine women on the spot, who were instead abducted, and then implored by the Romans to marry them (as opposed to striking a deal with their fathers or brothers first, as would have been required by law).

Though the sexual connotation is today dominant, the word "rape" can be used in a non-sexual context in literary English. In [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'', the title means "the theft of a lock [of hair]", exaggerating a trivial violation against a person. In the twentieth century, the classically trained [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] used the word with its old meaning of "seizing and taking away" in his ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. The [[Musical theatre|musical comedy]] ''[[The Fantasticks]]'' has [[The Fantasticks#Controversy|a controversial song]] ("It Depends on What You Pay") about "an old-fashioned rape". Compare also the adjective "rapacious" which retains the generic meaning of greedy and grasping.

In [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Roman Catholic canon law]], ''raptio'' refers to the legal prohibition of matrimony if the bride was abducted forcibly (Canon 1089 CIC).{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==History==
{{Further information|History of rape}}

The practice is surmised to have been common since anthropological antiquity. In [[Neolithic Europe]], excavation of the [[Linear Pottery culture]] site at [[Asparn an der Zaya|Asparn-Schletz]], [[Austria]], the remains of numerous slain victims were found. Among them, young adult females and children were clearly under-represented, suggesting that attackers had killed the men but abducted the [[nubile]] females.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenhauer, U., ''Kulturwandel und Innovationsprozess: Die fünf grossen 'W' und die Verbreitung des Mittelneolithikums in Südwestdeutschland.'' Archäologische Informationen 22, 1999,
215-239; an alternative interpretation is the focus of [[abduction of children]] rather than women, a suggestion also made for the mass grave excavated at [[Thalheim, Saxony|Thalheim]]. See E Biermann, ''Überlegungen zur Bevölkerungsgrösse in Siedlungen der Bandkeramik'' (2001) {{cite web |url=http://www.rheinland-archaeologie.de/BiLBK03.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102122819/http://www.rheinland-archaeologie.de/BiLBK03.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abduction of women is a common practice in [[tribal warfare|warfare]] among [[tribal societies]], along with [[cattle raiding]]. In [[historical human migrations]], the tendency of mobile groups of invading males to abduct indigenous females is reflected in the greater stability of [[Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroup]]s compared to [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup]]s. 
[[Image:Poussin RapeSabineLouvre.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Rape of the Sabine Women'', by [[Nicolas Poussin]], Rome, 1637-38 ([[Louvre Museum]])]]
The [[Rape of the Sabine Women]] is an important part of the [[Founding of Rome|foundation legends]] of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] (8th century BC). [[Romulus]] had established the settlement on the [[Palatine Hill]] with mostly male followers. Seeking wives, the Romans negotiated with the neighboring tribe of the [[Sabines]], without success. Faced with the extinction of their community, the Romans planned to abduct Sabine women. Romulus invited Sabine families to a festival of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune Equester]]. At the meeting he gave a signal, at which the Romans grabbed the Sabine women and fought off the Sabine men. The indignant abductees were implored by Romulus to accept Roman husbands. [[Livy]] claims that no sexual assault took place. He asserted that Romulus offered them free choice and promised civil and property rights to women. According to Livy he spoke to them each in person, "and pointed out to them that it was all owing to the pride of their parents in denying right of intermarriage to their neighbours. They would live in honourable wedlock, and share all their property and civil rights, and—dearest of all to human nature—would be the mothers of free men."&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.flash.net/~cohan/readings/Livysabine.html Livy: The Rape of the Sabines] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311040505/http://home.flash.net/~cohan/readings/Livysabine.html |date=2008-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The women married Roman men, but the Sabines went to war with the Romans. The conflict was eventually resolved when the women, who now had children by their Roman husbands, intervened in a battle to reconcile the warring parties. The tale is parodied by English short-story writer [[Saki]] in ''The Schartz-Metterklume Method''.&lt;ref&gt;H. H. Munro (Saki), ''Beasts and Super-Beasts: Beasts'', available at {{cite web |url=http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/372/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106102640/http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/372/ |archivedate=2009-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also serves as the main plot of the movie [[Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (film)|''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'']].

In [[Sanskrit literature]], the practice is known as ''[[Rakshasa]] Vivaha'' ("devil marriage"), mentioned e.g. by [[Kautilya]]. It is one of the eight forms of [[Hindu marriage]], the violent seizure or rape of a girl after the defeat or destruction of her relatives ([[Manu Smrti]] 3.33).

In the 3rd century, [[Gothic Christianity]] appears to have been initiated under the influence of Christian women captured by the [[Goths]] in [[Moesia]] and [[Thrace]]: in 251 AD, the Gothic army raided the Roman provinces of Moesia and Thrace, defeated and killed the Roman emperor [[Decius]], and took a number of (predominantly female) captives, many of whom were Christian. This is assumed to represent the first lasting contact of the Goths with Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Simek, Rudolf, ''Religion und Mythologie der Germanen'' (2003), p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Qur'an]], [[Islamic views on slavery#Concubinage|marriage to female prisoners of war who embraced Islam]] is recommended for those who cannot afford to marry other Muslim women according to [[Islamic marital jurisprudence|Islamic law]] ([[Sura 4]]:25).

Mutual abduction of women between Christian and Muslim communities was common in the [[Balkans under Ottoman rule]], and is a frequent theme in the [[Hajduk]] songs of the period.&lt;ref&gt;K. Simiczijev, ''Pieśń hajducka Słowian południowych'' ("the Hajduk songs of the South Slavs") 1985; review by Christo Vasilev, Jahrbuch für Volksliedforschung, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4690">'''Ritualization ''' is a behavior that occurs typically in a member of a given [[species]] in a highly [[stereotype]]d fashion and independent of any direct [[physiological]] significance. It is found, in differing forms, both in non-human animals and in humans.

==In non-human animals ==

[[Konrad Lorenz]], working with [[Greylag goose|greylag geese]] and other animals such as [[water shrew]]s, showed that ritualization was an important process in their development.&lt;ref&gt;[[Konrad Lorenz|Lorenz, Konrad]],''[[On Aggression]]'' 1963&lt;/ref&gt; He showed that the geese obsessively displayed a reflexive motor pattern of egg retrieval when stimulated by the sight of an egg outside their nest. Similarly, in the shrews, Lorenz showed that once they had become used to jumping over a stone in their path, they went on jumping at that place after the stone was taken away. This sort of behaviour is analogous to [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] in humans.&lt;ref name="Hoffman 2016 pp. 1–33"&gt;{{cite book | last=Hoffman | first=Kurt Leroy | title=Modeling Neuropsychiatric Disorders in Laboratory Animals | chapter=Animal models for studying obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | publisher=Elsevier | year=2016 | isbn=978-0-08-100099-1 | doi=10.1016/b978-0-08-100099-1.00001-7 | pages=161–241}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Oskar Heinroth]] in 1910 and Lorenz from 1935 onwards studied the triumph ceremony in geese; Lorenz described it as becoming a fixed ritual.&lt;ref name="Lorenz pp. 477–477"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lorenz | first=K. Z. | title=The Triumph Ceremony of the Greylag Goose, Anser anser L | journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | publisher=The Royal Society | volume=251 | issue=772 | date=1966-12-29 | issn=0962-8436 | doi=10.1098/rstb.1966.0038 | pages=477–477}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves a rolling behaviour (of the head and neck) and cackling with the head stretched forward, and occurs only among geese that know each other, meaning within a family or between mates. The triumph ceremony appears in varied situations, such as when mates meet after having been separated, when disturbed, or after an attack. The behaviour is now known also in other species, such as [[Canada goose]].&lt;ref name="Radesäter1974"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Radesäter |first1=Tommy |title=Form and Sequential Associations between the Triumph Ceremony and Other BehaviourPatterns in the Canada Goose Branta canadensis L. |journal=Ornis Scandinavica |date=1974 |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=87-101 |jstor=3676053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|Structural ritualization theory}}

Ritualization is associated with the work of [[Catherine Bell (religious studies scholar)|Catherine Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Catherine. ''Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice..'' Oxford University Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Bell, drawing on the [[Practice Theory]] of [[Pierre Bourdieu]], has taken a less [[structural-functionalism|functional]] view of [[ritual]] with her elaboration of ritualization. 

More recently scholars interested in the [[cognitive science of religion]] such as [[Pascal Boyer]], [[Pierre Liénard]], and William W. McCorkle, Jr. have been involved in experimental, ethnographic, and archival research on how ritualized actions might inform the study of ritualization and ritual forms of action. Boyer, Liénard, and McCorkle argue that ritualized compulsions are in relation to an evolved cognitive architecture where social, cultural, and environmental selection pressures stimulate "hazard-precaution" systems such as predation, contagion, and disgust in human minds.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, Pascal. ''The Naturalness of Religious Ideas.'' University of California Press, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, Pascal. ''[[Religion Explained|Religion Explained: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought.]]'' Basic Books, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, Pascal. "Religious Thought and Behavior as By-Products of Brain Functions," Trends in Cognitive Sciences, vol 7, pp 119-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, P and Liénard, P. "Why ritualized behavior? Precaution Systems and action parsing in developmental, pathological and cultural rituals .” Behavioral and Brain Sciences. 29: 595-650.&lt;/ref&gt; McCorkle argued that these ritualized compulsions (especially in regard to dead bodies vis-à-vis, mortuary behavior) were turned into ritual scripts by professional guilds only several thousand years ago with advancement in technology such as the domestication of plants and animals, literacy, and writing.&lt;ref&gt;McCorkle Jr., William W. "Ritualizing the Disposal of the Deceased: From Corpse to Concept." Peter Lang, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Neelly Bellah''' (1927–2013) was an American [[sociology|sociologist]] and the Elliott Professor of Sociology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He was internationally known for his work related to the [[sociology of religion]].&lt;ref name="Hartford Institute"&gt;{{cite web |title=Welcome to the Web Pages Dedicated to the Work of Robert N. Bellah |url=http://www.robertbellah.com |location=Hartford, Connecticut |publisher=Hartford Seminary |access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Bellah graduated ''[[summa cum laude]]'' from [[Harvard College]] in 1950, receiving a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in social relations with a concentration in [[social anthropology]].{{sfn|Wood|2005|p=182}} His undergraduate honors thesis won the Phi Beta Kappa Prize and was later published in 1952 with the title ''Apache Kinship Systems''.{{sfnm |1a1=Bellah |1a2=Tipton |1y=2006 |1p=523 |2a1=Bortolini |2a2=Cossu |2y=2015 |2p=39}}

Bellah graduated from [[Harvard University|Harvard]] in a joint sociology and Far East languages program, with [[Talcott Parsons]] and John Pelzel as his advisors,{{sfn|Bortolini|2010|p=7}} respectively.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Bellah first encountered the work of [[Talcott Parsons]] as an undergraduate when his senior honors thesis advisor was [[David Aberle]], a former student of Parsons.{{sfn|Bortolini|2010|p=7}} Parsons was specially interested in Bellah's concept of religious evolution and the concept of "civil religion". They remained intellectual friends until Parsons' death in 1979.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} He received his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in 1955.{{sfnm |1a1=Giesen |1a2=Šuber |1y=2005 |1p=49 |2a1=Yamane |2y=1998}} His doctoral dissertation was titled ''Religion and Society in Tokugawa Japan'' and was an extension of Weber's [[Protestant ethic]] thesis to Japan. It was published as ''Tokugawa Religion'' in 1957.

While an undergraduate at Harvard, Bellah was a member of the [[Communist Party USA]] from 1947 to 1949&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Bellah |first=Robert N. |year=2005 |title=McCarthyism at Harvard |url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2005/02/10/mccarthyism-at-harvard/ |magazine=The New York Review of Books |volume=52 |issue=2 |issn=0028-7504 |access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a chairman of the [[John Reed Club]], "a recognized student organization concerned with the study of [[Marxism]]".&lt;ref name="ny"&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Bellah |first1=Robert N. |last2=Bundy |first2=McGeorge |author2-link=McGeorge Bundy |last3=Kerr |first3=Clark |author3-link=Clark Kerr |last4=Cohen |first4=Marshall |last5=Conway |first5=John |last6=Doty |first6=Paul |display-authors=5 |year=1977 |title='Veritas' at Harvard: Another Exchange |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1977/jul/14/veritas-at-harvard-another-exchange/ |magazine=The New York Review of Books |volume=24 |issue=12 |issn=0028-7504 |access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the summer of 1954, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard [[McGeorge Bundy]], who later served as a national security adviser to [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], threatened to withdraw Bellah's graduate student fellowship if he did not provide the names of his former club associates.&lt;ref name="NYT: Obituary"&gt;{{cite news |last=Fox |first=Margalit |author-link=Margalit Fox |date=August 6, 2013 |title=Robert Bellah, Sociologist of Religion Who Mapped the American Soul, Dies at 86 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/07/us/robert-bellah-sociologist-of-religion-who-mapped-the-american-soul-dies-at-86.html |url-access=limited |work=The New York Times |access-date=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bellah was also interrogated by the Boston office of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] with the same purpose. As a result, Bellah and his family spent two years in Canada, where he was awarded a [[post-doctoral fellowship]] at the [[McGill University Institute of Islamic Studies|Islamic Institute in McGill University]] in [[Montreal]]. He returned to Harvard after [[McCarthyism]] declined due to the death of its main instigator senator [[Joseph McCarthy]]. Bellah afterwards wrote,

{{quote|... I know from personal experience that Harvard did some terribly wrong things during the McCarthy period and that those things have never been publicly acknowledged. At its worst it came close to psychological terror against almost defenseless individuals. ...The university and the secret police were in collusion to suppress political dissent and even to persecute dissenters who had changed their minds if they were not willing to become part of the persecution.&lt;ref name="ny" /&gt;}}

==Career==
Bellah's ''[[masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', ''Religion in Human Evolution'' (2011),{{sfnm |1a1=Miles |1y=2013 |1pp=853, 862 |2a1=Stausberg |2y=2014 |2p=281}} traces the biological and cultural origins of religion and the interplay between the two. The sociologist and philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]] wrote of the work: "This great book is the intellectual harvest of the rich academic life of a leading social theorist who has assimilated a vast range of biological, anthropological, and historical literature in the pursuit of a breathtaking project&amp;nbsp;... In this field I do not know of an equally ambitious and comprehensive study."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674061439&amp;content=reviews | title=About Religion in Human Evolution | publisher=Harvard University Press | accessdate=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book won the Distinguished Book Award of the [[American Sociological Association]]'s Section on Sociology of Religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sociology of Religion Section Award Recipients |url=http://www.asanet.org/asa-communities/asa-sections/current-sections/religion/section-sociology-religion-award-recipients |publisher=American Sociological Association |access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bellah is best-known for his 1985 book ''Habits of the Heart'',&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=robert+bellah&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%2C7&amp;as_sdtp=&lt;/ref&gt;{{verification failed|date=September 2018}}--&gt; which discusses how religion contributes to and detracts from America's common good, and for his studies of religious and moral issues and their connection to society. Bellah was perhaps best known for his work related to [[American civil religion]], a term which he coined in a 1967 article that has since gained widespread attention among scholars.{{sfn|Bellah|1967}}&lt;ref name="Woo 2013"&gt;{{cite news |last=Woo |first=Elaine |date=August 3, 2013 |title=Robert N.

He served in various positions at Harvard from 1955 to 1967 when he took the position of Ford Professor of Sociology at the [[University of California at Berkeley]]. He spent the remainder of his career at Berkeley.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} His views are often classified as [[communitarian]].{{sfnm |1a1=Bellah |1y=1998 |2a1=Dorrien |2y=1995 |2pp=336–343 |3a1=Eberly |3y=1998 |3p=108}} An academic biography of Robert Bellah, "the world's most widely read sociologist of religion",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bergman |first=Barry |date=October 26, 2006 |title=Of God, Justice, and Disunited States |url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/berkeleyan/2006/10/26_Bellah.shtml |work=The Berkeleyan |location=Berkeley, California |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |access-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is currently under way.{{sfnm |1a1=Bortolini |1y=2010 |2a1=Bortolini |2y=2011 |3a1=Bortolini |3y=2012}}

==Personal==
Bellah was born in [[Altus, Oklahoma|Altus]], [[Oklahoma]], on February 23, 1927.{{sfn|Wood|2005|p=182}} His father was a newspaper editor and publisher and died when he was two years old.{{sfn|Horowitz|2005|p=218}} His mother Lillian moved the family to [[Los Angeles]],{{sfn|Horowitz|2005|p=218}} where she had relatives.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Bellah grew up in Los Angeles{{sfn|Giesen|Šuber|2005|p=49}} and attended [[Los Angeles High School]], where he and his future wife, Melanie Hyman, were editors of the student newspaper. They got married in 1948 after she graduated from [[Stanford University]], and he began studying at Harvard University after a service in the [[US Army]]. Bellah's wife died in 2010.

Bellah was briefly a [[communism|communist]] during his student years at Harvard, as he recalled in 1977 in a letter to the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' regarding [[McCarthyism]] at the university:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Harvard's capitulation to McCarthyism is still being defended as a form of resistance to McCarthyism. An account of my experiences will, I believe, support [Sigmund] Diamond's and not [[McGeorge Bundy|[McGeorge] Bundy]]'s interpretation of those years.
I was a member of the [[CPUSA|Communist Party]] as a Harvard undergraduate from 1947 to 1949. During that period I was mainly involved in the [[John Reed Club]], a recognized student organization concerned with the study of [[Marxism]]. In that connection I might recount an incident that indicates that a difference between a public policy and a private policy at Harvard such as Diamond has suggested may already have begun in 1949. According to [[Seymour Martin Lipset|[Seymour Martin] Lipset]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1949, the John Reed Club sponsored a talk by a well-known Communist, [[Gerhart Eisler]], who was on his way to a job in East Germany after having been convicted for contempt of Congress. When the University was attacked for allowing students to be corrupted, [[Wilbur Bender]], then Dean of Harvard College, defended the students' right to hear, stating: "If Harvard students can be corrupted by an Eisler, Harvard College had better shut down as an educational institution...[p. 182]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I was, I believe, chairman of the John Reed Club at the time and was informed shortly after we announced that Eisler would speak that the university was considering forbidding the meeting and that the chairman and executive committee of the Club were asked to meet with an administrative officer. The administrator told us in the strongest terms that the invitation was extremely embarrassing for Harvard and asked us for the good of the school to withdraw the invitation. When we stood fast he told us that quite probably none of us would ever get jobs if we persisted in our course of action. The Harvard administration was attempting to do privately and indirectly what it would not do publicly and brazenly, namely suppress freedom of speech, which was precisely the aim of [[Joseph McCarthy|[Joseph] McCarthy]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bellah was fluent in Japanese and literate in Chinese, French, and German, and later studied [[Arabic language|Arabic]] at [[McGill University]] in Montreal.

Bellah died July 30, 2013, at an [[Oakland, California]], hospital from complications after [[heart surgery]]. He was 86 and is survived by his daughters Jennifer Bellah Maguire and Hally Bellah-Guther; a sister, Hallie Reynolds; and five grandchildren.&lt;ref name="Woo 2013"/&gt; Raised as a [[Presbyterian]], he converted to [[Episcopalianism]].&lt;ref name="NYT: Obituary"/&gt;

[[File:Servas meeting Piem VdA 01.png|thumb|A Servas local meeting in [[Collegno]], [[Italy]] in 2016]]
'''Servas International''' is a [[hospitality service]] and [[social networking service]]. It provides a platform for members to arrange [[homestay]]s, offer [[hospitality]], meet other members, and join events. The platform is a [[gift economy]]; hosts are not allowed to charge for [[lodging]]. However, members must pay an annual membership fee to the organization.

In [[Esperanto]], ''Servas'' means "we serve (peace)".

Servas is an accredited [[Non-governmental organization]] and has been affiliated with the [[United Nations]] since 1973.&lt;ref name=letter&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1980/0922/092250.html | title=Servas -- a letter of introduction to another culture | first=Charlotte | last=Fardelmann | work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] | date=September 22, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Servas was founded in 1948, in the aftermath of [[World War II]], by Bob Luitweiler and other Danish students as a [[peace movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/13/travel/airbnb-alternative-home-share-rentals.html | title=The Other Airbnbs: Alternative Home-Sharing Rentals | first=Elaine | last=Glusac | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=March 13, 2017}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/homes-and-property/interiors/competition-for-airbnb-as-other-home-sharing-sites-target-niche-audiences-1.3019944 | title=Competition for Airbnb as other home-sharing sites target niche audiences | first=Elaine | last=Glusac | work=[[The Irish Times]] | date=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How it works==
Unlike most hospitality services whereby users can join in a few minutes by registering online, members of Servas almost always must go through an interview process and submit letters of recommendation before they are admitted. Travelers write a self-introduction on a special form valid for one year, that is shown to hosts upon arrival. Although hosts do not charge for lodging, travelers must pay an annual fee to the organization, which varies according to region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/travel/1996/07/14/servas-with-a-smile/7b7de4fc-f813-461a-b5b3-3317ef6330ae/ | title=SERVAS WITH A SMILE | first=Dana | last=Hull | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=July 14, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=letter/&gt;

Local chapters of the organization elect representatives to handle interviews and determine membership fees.

A '''shield-maiden''' ({{lang-non|skjaldmær}}), in [[Scandinavian folklore]] and [[Norse mythology|mythology]] was a female warrior. They are often mentioned in [[saga]]s such as ''[[Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks]]'' and in ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''. Shield-maidens also appear in stories of other [[Germanic peoples]]: [[Goths]], [[Cimbri]], and [[Marcomanni]].&lt;ref name="nordisk"&gt;[http://runeberg.org/nfce/0728.html The article ''Sköldmö''] in ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'' (1917).&lt;/ref&gt; The mythical [[valkyrie]]s may have been based on the shield-maidens.&lt;ref name="nordisk"/&gt;

==Historical existence==
The historical existence of shield-maidens is heavily debated, but scholars including [[Neil Price (archaeologist)|Neil Price]],&lt;ref name="history.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/shows/vikings/videos/secrets-of-the-vikings-shield-maidens|title=Secrets of the Vikings: Shield Maidens|website=www.history.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125132543/http://www.history.com/shows/vikings/videos/secrets-of-the-vikings-shield-maidens|archivedate=25 January 2016|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that they existed while others, like scholar Judith Jesch disagree, citing a lack of hard evidence for trained or regular women warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/04/19/viking-women-warriors-and-valkyries/|title=Viking women, warriors, and valkyries|website=blog.britishmuseum.org|date=19 April 2014|first=Judith|last=Jesch|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194313/http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/04/19/viking-women-warriors-and-valkyries/|archivedate=3 March 2016|deadurl=yes|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/world/europe/sweden-viking-women-warriors-dna.html|title=A Female Viking Warrior?

==Historical accounts==
There are few historic attestations that [[Viking Age]] women took part in warfare, but the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] historian [[John Skylitzes]] records that women fought in battle when [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev]] attacked the Byzantines in [[Bulgaria]] in 971.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; When the [[Varangians]] (not to be confused with the Byzantine [[Varangian Guard]]) had suffered a devastating defeat in the [[Siege of Dorostolon]], the victors were stunned at discovering armed women among the fallen warriors.&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;Harrison, D. &amp; Svensson, K. (2007). ''Vikingaliv''. Fälth &amp; Hässler, Värnamo. {{ISBN|978-91-27-35725-9}}. p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Leif Erikson]]'s pregnant half-sister [[Freydís Eiríksdóttir]] was in [[Vinland]], she is reported to have taken up a sword, and, bare-breasted, scared away the attacking [[Skræling]]s.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; The fight is recounted in the ''[[Greenland saga]]'', though Freydís is not explicitly referred to as a shield-maiden in the text.&lt;ref name=Thorsson&gt;Thorsson, Ö. (Ed.) ''The Sagas of the Icelanders.'' Penguin Books, 1997. Anyway a mention of a single woman picking up a sword once can not be considered evidence of actual trained  female warriors.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saxo Grammaticus reported that shield-maidens fought on the side of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] at the [[Battle of Brávellir]] in the year 750:
{{quote|Now out of the town of Sle, under the captains [[Heiðr|Hetha]] (Heid) and Wisna, with Hakon Cut-cheek came Tummi the Sailmaker. On these captains, who had the bodies of women, nature bestowed the souls of men. [[Webiorg]] was also inspired with the same spirit, and was attended by Bo (Bui) Bramason and Brat the Jute, thirsting for war.|[[Saxo Grammaticus]]&lt;ref name=Saxo&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elton|first1=Oliver|title=THE DANISH HISTORY,  BOOKS I-IX by  Saxo Grammaticus|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1150|website=Project Gutenberg|publisher=Project Gutenberg|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Legendary accounts==
Examples of shield-maidens mentioned by name in the Norse sagas include [[Brynhildr]] in the ''[[Vǫlsunga saga]]'', [[Hervor]] in ''[[Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks]]'', the Brynhildr of the ''[[Bósa saga ok Herrauðs]]'', the Swedish princess Thornbjǫrg in ''[[Hrólfs saga Gautrekssonar]]'' and Princess Hed, Visna and [[Veborg]] in ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''.

Two shield-maidens appear in certain translations of the ''Hervarar saga''. The first of these Hervors was known to have taken up typically masculine roles early in her childhood and often raided travelers in the woods dressed as a man. Later in her life, she claimed the cursed sword [[Tyrfing]] from her father's burial site and became a seafaring raider.  She eventually settled and married. Her granddaughter was also named Hervor and commanded forces against attacking [[Huns]]. Although the saga remarks on her bravery she is mortally wounded by enemy forces and dies on the battlefield.&lt;ref name=Tolkien&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars Judith Jesch and Jenny Jochens theorize that shield-maidens' often grim fates or their sudden return to typically female roles is a testament to their role as figures of both male and female fantasy as well as emblematic of the danger of abandoning gender roles.&lt;ref name=Tolkien&gt;{{cite web|last=Tolkien|first=Christopher|title=The Saga of King Heidrik the Wise|url=http://vsnrweb-publications.org.uk/The%20Saga%20Of%20King%20Heidrek%20The%20Wise.pdf|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons Ltd.|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brynhildr Buðladóttir and Guðrún Gjúkadóttir===
{{Main|Brynhildr}}
Brynhildr of the ''Vǫlsunga saga'', along with her rival in love, [[Gudrun|Guðrún Gjúkadóttir]], provides an example of how a shield-maiden compares to more conventional aristocratic womanhood in the sagas.  Brynhildr is chiefly concerned with honor, much like a male warrior.  When she ends up married to Gudrun's brother [[Gunther|Gunnarr]] instead of [[Sigurd|Sigurðr]], the man she intended to marry, Brynhildr speaks a verse comparing the courage of the two men:
{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;Sigurd fought the dragon
And that afterward will be
Forgotten by no one
While men still live.
Yet your brother
Neither dared
To ride into the fire
Nor to leap across it.&lt;ref name=Byock&gt;Byock, Jesse L. (Trans.) ''Saga of the Volsungs.''University of California Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Brynhildr is married to Gunnarr and not Sigurðr because of deceit and trickery, including a potion of forgetfulness given to Sigurðr so he forgets his previous relationship with her.&lt;ref name=Byock/&gt; Brynhildr is upset not only for the loss of Sigurðr but also for the dishonesty involved. Similar to her male counterparts, the shield-maiden prefers to do things straightforwardly, without the deception considered stereotypically feminine in much of medieval literature. She enacts her vengeance directly, resulting in the deaths of herself, Sigurðr, and Sigurð's son by Guðrún. By killing the child, she demonstrates an understanding of feud and filial responsibility; if he lived, the boy would grow up to take vengeance on Brynhildr's family.

Guðrún has a similar concern with family ties, but at first does not usually act directly. She is more inclined to incite her male relatives to action than take up arms herself. Guðrún is no shield-maiden, and Brynhildr mocks her for this, saying, "Only ask what is best for you to know. That is suitable for noble women. And it is easy to be satisfied while everything happens according to your desires."&lt;ref name=Byock/&gt; In her later marriages, however, she is willing to kill her children, burn down a hall, and send her other sons to avenge the murder of her daughter, Svanhildr. In the world of the sagas, women can be both honorable and remorseless, much like the male heroes. While a shield-maiden does not fill a woman's typical role, her strength of character is found in even the more domestic women in these stories.

==Archaeology==
Graves of female settlers containing weapons have been uncovered, but scholars do not agree how these should be interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencenordic.com/don’t-underestimate-viking-women|title=Don’t underestimate Viking women|date=2 January 2013|first=Arild S.|last=Foss|website=sciencenordic.com|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norse immigrant graves in [[England]] and chemical analysis of the remains suggested a somewhat equal distribution of men and women, suggesting husbands and wives, while some of the women were buried with weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Warriors and women: the sex ratio of Norse migrants to eastern England up to 900 AD | last = McLeod | first = Shane | work = Early Medieval Europe | publisher = Wiley | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 332–353 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0254.2011.00323.x/full | doi=10.1111/j.1468-0254.2011.00323.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Invasion of the Viking women unearthed | url = http://content.usatoday.com/communities/sciencefair/post/2011/07/invasion-of-the-viking-women-unearthed/1?csp=34news#.U6xrxBwcqs8 | date = July 19, 2011 | publisher = [[USA Today]] | last = Vergano | first = Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a tie-in special to the TV series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'' Neil Price showed that a 10th Century [[Birka]]-burial excavated in the 1970s containing a large number of weapons and the bones of two horses turned out to be the grave of a woman upon bone analysis by Anna Kjellström.&lt;ref name="history.com"/&gt; In 2017, DNA analysis confirmed that the person was female&lt;ref name=jonson2017&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ajpa.23308|title=A female Viking warrior confirmed by genomics|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|year=2017|last1=Hedenstierna-Jonson|first1=Charlotte|last2=Kjellström|first2=Anna|last3=Zachrisson|first3=Torun|last4=Krzewińska|first4=Maja|last5=Sobrado|first5=Veronica|last6=Price|first6=Neil|last7=Günther|first7=Torsten|last8=Jakobsson|first8=Mattias|last9=Götherström|first9=Anders|last10=Storå|first10=Jan}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the so called [[Birka female Viking warrior]], but others including respected scholar of the Vikings, Judith Jesch says that conclusion is premature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/world/europe/sweden-viking-women-warriors-dna.html|title=A Female Viking Warrior?

==In popular culture==
While women warriors are a staple of [[fantasy]], they are not often referred to as shield-maidens. Some who are include [[Éowyn]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and Thorgil in [[Nancy Farmer]]'s ''[[The Sea of Trolls]]'' trilogy.

In the 2013 TV series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'', the legendary Viking shield-maiden [[Lagertha]], played by [[Katheryn Winnick]], is a principal character.

'''Stendhal syndrome''', '''Stendhal's syndrome''', '''hyperkulturemia''', or '''Florence syndrome''' is a [[psychosomatic]] disorder that causes [[Tachycardia|rapid heartbeat]], dizziness, [[Syncope (medicine)|fainting]], confusion and even [[hallucination]]s when an individual is exposed to an experience of great personal significance, particularly viewing [[art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1136/bcr.06.2008.0317| title = Stendhal syndrome: A case of cultural overload| journal = Case Reports| volume = 2009| pages = bcr0620080317| year = 2009| last1 = Nicholson | first1 = T.

==History==
[[File:Stendhal.jpg|thumb|upright|Stendhal syndrome was named after Marie-Henri Beyle (1783–1842), better known by his penname [[Stendhal]].]]
The illness is named after the 19th-century French author [[Stendhal]] (pseudonym of Marie-Henri Beyle), who described his experience with the phenomenon during his 1817 visit to [[Florence]] in his book ''Naples and Florence: A Journey from Milan to Reggio''.

When he visited the [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence|Basilica of Santa Croce]], where [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Michelangelo]] and [[Galileo Galilei]] are buried, he was overcome with emotion. He wrote:{{quote|I was in a sort of ecstasy, from the idea of being in Florence, close to the great men whose tombs I had seen. Absorbed in the contemplation of sublime beauty ... I reached the point where one encounters celestial sensations ... Everything spoke so vividly to my soul. Ah, if I could only forget. I had palpitations of the heart, what in Berlin they call 'nerves'. Life was drained from me. I walked with the fear of falling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=OxyNfsmXfYEC&amp;pg=PA196 | title=Interfaces of Performance | editor-first1=Maria |editor-last1= Chatzichristodoulou | editor-first2=Janis |editor-last2= Jefferies |editor-first3=Rachel |editor-last3= Zerihan | publisher = Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |year= 2009 |page= 196 |isbn= 9781409486145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
He had been shown the frescoes in the church including those by [[Giotto]], and modern writers frequently attribute his emotions mistakenly to the latter rather than powerful historical associations of the tombs. {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Although psychiatrists have long debated whether it really exists, its effects on some sufferers are serious enough for them to require treatment in hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/15/world/florence-s-art-makes-some-go-to-pieces.html |title=Florence's Art Makes Some Go to Pieces |location=Italy; Florence (Italy) |work=The New York Times |date=15 May 1989 |accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The staff at Florence's Santa Maria Nuova hospital are accustomed to dealing with tourists suffering from dizzy spells and disorientation after admiring the statue of David, the masterpieces of the Uffizi Gallery and other treasures of the Tuscan city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/7914746/Scientists-investigate-Stendhal-Syndrome-fainting-caused-by-great-art.html |title=Scientists investigate Stendhal Syndrome – fainting caused by great art |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=28 July 2010 |accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though there are many descriptions of people becoming dizzy and fainting while taking in Florentine art, especially at the aforementioned [[Uffizi]] in Florence, dating from the early 19th century on, the syndrome was only named in 1979, when it was described by Italian psychiatrist [[Graziella Magherini]], who observed and described more than 100 similar cases among tourists and visitors in Florence. There is no scientific evidence to define the Stendhal syndrome as a specific psychiatric disorder; on the other hand there is evidence that the same cerebral areas involved in emotional reactions are activated during the exposure to artworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |last1=Innocenti |first1=Claudia |last2=Fioravanti |first2=Giulia |last3=Spiti |first3=Raffaello |last4=Faravelli |first4=Carlo |title=La sindrome di Stendhal fra psicoanalisi e neuroscienze |journal=Rivista di Psichiatria |date=1 March 2014 |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=61–66  |doi=10.1708/1461.16139|pmid=24770571 |issn=2038-2502  |trans-title=[The Stendhal syndrome between psychoanalysis and neuroscience]. |language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Oxford Companion to Food''''' is an [[encyclopedia]] about [[food]]. It was edited by [[Alan Davidson (food writer)|Alan Davidson]] and published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 1999.  It was also issued in [[softcover]] under the name '''''The Penguin Companion to Food'''''. A second edition was edited by Tom Jaine and published in 2006.

The book, Davidson's ''magnum opus'' with "more than a million words, mostly his own",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/dec/04/guardianobituaries.food |title=Alan Davidson: Writer, publisher and diplomat who produced three great seafood books and ''the Oxford Companion To Food'' | publisher=[[The Guardian]] | work=Obituary| date=4 December 2003 |accessdate= 2010-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; covers the nature and history of foodstuffs worldwide, starting from [[aardvark]] and ending with [[Zuppa Inglese|zuppa inglese]]. It is compiled with especially strong coverage of [[European cuisine|European]] and in particular [[British cuisine|British cookery]] and contains no [[recipe]]s.  It was an "outgrowth"&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; of the annual [[Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery]].

The entry for this work in [[WorldCat]] includes the following abstract:

{{quote|The 2,650 alphabetical entries in this compendium represent 20 years of Davidson's work. They include information on specific foods, cooking terms, culinary tools, countries, traditions, and biographies of chefs and cookbook authors. The entries for countries cover foods, habits, and holidays with special foods. The entries about traditions cover religious laws that deal with food and/or fasting, such as [[Ramadan]] and [[kosher]] laws. There are 39 longer articles about staple foods such as rice and apples. A comprehensive bibliography provides access to further information. The book does not contain recipes, but it is an excellent companion for sources such as the [[Larousse Gastronomique]].&lt;ref name="Auchter"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Auchter |first=Dorothy |journal=American Libraries |volume=31|issue=5 |page=60|date=May 2000| title=Outstanding reference sources 2000| publisher= American Library Association (ALA)|location=Chicago| issn=0002-9769|oclc=854299}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Major articles are signed and include bibliographic references, and there is a comprehensive overall bibliography. Much of the material in it was previously published in Davidson's ''[[Petits Propos Culinaires]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Reception==
''[[The New York Times]]'' called the book "a masterly work with a variety of voices, from the straightforward, almost dry, to the quirky and the witty" and a work "dense with extremely thorough and well-written entries, enhanced by cross-references and indexes and larded with anecdotes and strong opinions."&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite web| title= 'The Oxford Companion to Food': 6 Pounds, With Light Touches | url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/books/112499oxford-book-review.html | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date= November 24, 1999 | author=Florence Fabricant |accessdate= 2010-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tombstone tourist''' (otherwise known as a "cemetery enthusiast", "cemetery tourist", "grave hunter", "graver", or "taphophile") describes an individual who has a passion for and enjoyment of [[cemetery|cemeteries]], [[epitaph]]s, [[Stone rubbing|gravestone rubbing]], photography, art, and history of (famous) deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rogak, Lisa |date=2004|title=Stones and Bones of New England: A guide to unusual, historic, and otherwise notable cemeteries|publisher= Globe Pequat |isbn= 0-7627-3000-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been most notably used by author and biographer Scott Stanton as the title of his former website and book, ''The Tombstone Tourist: Musicians'' (2003), about the lives and gravesites of famous musicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Tombstone Tourist: Musicians|authors=Stanton, Scott &amp; Stanton, Robin W. |isbn= 9780965996693|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cemetery tourists are particularly interested in the historical aspects of cemeteries or the historical relevance of their inhabitants. [[La Recoleta Cemetery]] in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina and [[Zentralfriedhof]] (Central Cemetery) in [[Vienna, Austria]] carry a large array of famous inhabitants and their tombs, that make the cemeteries significant tourist destinations.

[[Genealogy tourism|Genealogy tourists]] make considerable effort to search out cemeteries and their records, to verify grave records and ancestral burial locations.

==History==
For centuries, people have made [[pilgrimages]] to the burial sites of religious icons and leaders.  In fact, such was common during medieval times when people went to gravesites or to shrines to venerate saints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/NORpilgrimage.htm|title=Pilgrimage|author=Simkin, John|website=Spartacus Educational|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In China, the ancient tradition of [[Ancestor Worship]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themystica.com/mystica/articles/a/ancestor_worship.html|title=Ancestor Worship|website=Themystica.com|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; also involved a veneration of dead relatives with visitations to shrines and gravesites.

During the 19th century, garden cemeteries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timetravel-britain.com/05/April/cemeteries.shtml|title=London's Victorian Garden Cemeteries|website=Timetravel-britain.com|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; began to appear that encouraged visitors to stay and visit in the cemetery. Famous among these is the [[Père Lachaise cemetery]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pere-lachaise.com/perelachaise.php?lang=en|title=Cimetière du Père Lachaise -Visite virtuelle - Cemetery's virtual tour - Jim Morrison - Edith Piaf|website=Pere-lachaise.com|accessdate=4 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230091818/http://www.pere-lachaise.com/perelachaise.php?lang=en|archivedate=30 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Paris, France]], which continues to invite tourists to visit and see elaborate memorials not only to the world famous, but to lesser known individuals as well.

Cemetery records have also been a way of verifying genealogical data. Making gravestone rubbings was in practice for centuries as a way of providing this documentation and appreciating the carvings on the tombstones. Among genealogists, scouring cemeteries looking for the graves of dead ancestors is a common and longstanding practice with individuals often relying on limited and outdated information to find burial sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alsirat.com/silence/rubbings.html|title=City of the Silent - Tombstone Rubbings|website=Alsirat.com|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==
{{original research|section|date=July 2016}}
The appreciation of cemeteries has evolved along with science and technology.  The Internet allows enthusiasts to visit cemeteries (and in some cases the gravesites of their own ancestors) on websites such as [[Find a Grave]]. There are also many websites and books devoted to people's personal explorations into cemeteries, particularly ones that contain the remains of famous individuals. There are also tour companies that organize and plan tours to famous cemeteries.

The hunting of graves has become digital as many cemetery transcribers and ancestor hunters have begun using [[GPS]] equipment to locate the area where a graveyard or gravesite is reputed to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guerrero|first1=Russell|title=Plotting a Grave Project|url=http://www.trinity.edu/departments/public_relations/on_campus/cemetary_project/|website=Trinity University|accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''tour operator''' typically combines tour and travel components to create a package [[holiday]]. They advertise and produce brochures to promote their products, holidays and itineraries.

The most common example of a tour operator's product would be a [[flight]] on a [[charter airline]] plus a transfer from the [[airport]] to a [[hotel]] and the services of a local representative, all for one price. Niche tour operators may specialise in destinations, e.g. [[Italy]], activities and experiences, e.g. [[skiing]], or a combination thereof.

The original ''raison d'être'' of tour operating was the difficulty for ordinary folk of making arrangements in far-flung places, with problems of [[language]], [[currency]] and communication. The advent of the [[internet]] has led to a rapid increase in self-packaging of holidays. However, tour operators still have their competence in arranging tours for those who do not have time to do [[Do it yourself|DIY]] holidays, and specialize in large group events and meetings such as conferences or seminars. Also, tour operators still exercise contracting power with suppliers (airlines, hotels, other land arrangements, cruise companies and so on) and influence over other entities (tourism boards and other government authorities) in order to create packages and special group departures for destinations that might otherwise be difficult and expensive to visit.

The three major tour operator associations in the U.S. are the [[National Tour Association]] (NTA), the [[United States Tour Operators Association]] (USTOA), and the [[American Bus Association]] (ABA). In Europe, there are the [[European Tour Operators Association]] (ETOA), and in the UK, the [[Association of British Travel Agents]] (ABTA) and the [[Association of Independent Tour Operators]] (AITO).  The primary association for receptive North American inbound tour operators is the [[Receptive Services Association of America]] (RSAA).

'''Transculturation''' is a term coined by Cuban anthropologist [[Fernando Ortiz Fernández|Fernando Ortiz]] in 1947&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/s/a/sam50/readings521/ORTIZ_Counter-Engl.pdf Ortiz 1995], pp. v, 97&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the phenomenon of merging and converging cultures.

Transculturation encompasses more than transition from one culture to another; it does not consist merely of acquiring another culture (acculturation) or of losing or uprooting a previous culture (deculturation).  Rather, it merges these concepts and additionally carries the idea of the consequent creation of new cultural phenomena (neoculturation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ortiz|1995|pp=102–103|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/s/a/sam50/readings521/ORTIZ_Counter-Engl.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ortiz also referred to the devastating impact of Spanish colonialism on Cuba's indigenous peoples as a "failed transculturation". Transculturation can often be the result of colonial conquest and subjugation, especially in a postcolonial era as native peoples struggle to regain their own sense of identity.

In simple terms, transculturation reflects the natural tendency of people (in general) to resolve conflicts over time, rather than exacerbating them.  (In the modern context, both conflicts and resolutions are amplified by communication and transportation technology—the ancient tendency of cultures drifting or remaining apart has been replaced by stronger forces for bringing societies together.) Where transculturation impacts ethnicity and ethnic issues the term "ethnoconvergence" is sometimes used.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

In one general sense, transculturation covers [[war]], [[ethnic conflict]], [[racism]], [[multiculturalism]], [[cross-culturalism]], [[interracial marriage]], and any other of a number of contexts that deal with more than one culture.  In the other general sense, transculturation is one aspect of global phenomena and human events.

The general processes of transculturation are extremely complex—steered by powerful forces at the macrosocial level, yet ultimately resolved at the interpersonal level. The driving force for conflict is simple [[Proxemics|proximity]]—boundaries, once separating people (providing for a measure of isolation) become the issue of a conflict when societies encroach upon one another territorially.  If a means to co-exist cannot be immediately found, then conflicts can be hostile, leading to a process by which contact between individuals leads to some resolution. Often, history shows us, the processes of co-existence begins with hostilities, and with the natural passing of polarist individuals, comes the passing of their polarist sentiments, and soon some resolution is achieved.  Degrees of hostile conflict vary from outright genocidal conquest, to lukewarm infighting between differing political views within the same ethnic community.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

These changes often represent differences between homeland pons, and their [[diasporic]] communities abroad. Nevertheless, obstacles to '''ethnoconvergence''' are not great. The primary issue; [[language]], (''hence, communication and education'') can be overcome within a single generation—as is evident in the easy acclimation of children of foreign parents.  English, for example, is spoken by more non-Anglo-American people than Anglo-Americans, making it the current [[lingua-franca]], the worldwide de facto standard international language.

Processes of transculturation become more complex within the context of [[globalization]], given the multiple layers of abstraction that permeate everyday experiences. Elizabeth Kath argues that in the global era we can no longer consider transculturation only in relation to the face-to-face, but that we need to take into account the many layers of abstracted interactions that are interwoven through face-to-face encounters, a phenomenon that she describes as ''layers of transculturation''.&lt;ref&gt;Kath, Elizabeth (2015) [http://www.rowmaninternational.com/books/narratives-of-globalization "On Transculturation: Re-enacting and Remaking Latin Dance and Music in Foreign Lands"] In Julian Lee (Ed) ''Narratives of Globalization: Reflections on the Global Condition.''  Rowman &amp; Littlefield International&lt;/ref&gt; Kath draws upon the concept of constitutive abstraction as seen in the work of Australian social theorists Geoff Sharp&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Geoff (1993) "Extended Forms of the Social", ''Arena,'' 1&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]].&lt;ref&gt;James, Paul (1996) ''Nation Formation: Towards a Theory of Abstract Community,'' SAGE&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Emotional Ambivalence Across Times and Spaces: Mapping Petrarch's Intersecting Worlds|last = James|first = Paul|date = 2014|journal = Exemplaria|volume = 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homogenization versus ethnoconvergence==

It has been observed that even in monolingual, industrial societies like urban North America, some individuals do cling to a "modernized" primordial identity, apart from others. Some intellectuals, such as [[Michael Ignatieff]], argue that convergence of a general culture does not directly entail a similar convergence in [[ethnic]] identities. This can become evident in social situations, where people divide into separate groups, despite being of an identical "super-ethnicity", such as [[nationality]].

Within each smaller ethnicity, individuals may tend to see it perfectly justified to assimilate with other cultures, and some others view assimilation as wrong and incorrect for their culture. This common theme, representing dualist opinions of ethnoconvergence itself, within a single ethnic group is often manifested in issues of [[sexual partner]]s and [[marriage]], employment preferences, etc. These varied opinions of ethnoconvergence represent themselves in a spectrum; [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]], [[wikt:homogeneous|homogenization]], [[acculturation]], and [[cultural compromise]] are commonly used terms for ethnoconvegence which flavor the issues to a bias.

Often it's in a secular, multi-ethnic environment that cultural concerns are both minimised and exacerbated; Ethnic prides are boasted, hierarchy is created ("center" culture versus "periphery") but on the other hand, they will still share a common "culture", and common language and behaviours. Often the elderly, more conservative-in-association of a clan, tend to reject cross-cultural associations, and participate in ethnically similar community-oriented activities. [[Xenophobia|Xenophobes]] tend to think of cross-cultural contact as a component of assimilation, and see this as harmful.

==Obstacles to ethnoconvergence==

The obstacle to ethnoconvergence is [[ethnocentrism]], which is the view that one's culture is of greater importance than another's. Ethnocentrism often takes different forms, as it is a highly personal bias, and manifests itself in countless aspects of culture. [[Religion]], or belief, is the prime ethnocentric divider. Second is [[convention (norm)|custom]], which may overlap religion. With the adherence to each distinct component, comes the repulsion of the other. In most regions, ethnic divides are binary, meaning only two distinct cultures are present, each seeing the other as foreign. Many, however make the point that the binary example is the exception, and the norm is far more dynamic.

Ethnicity can be divided into two distinct areas, as they relate to ethnoconvergence:  Utilitarian traits, and traditional customs.

Religion, on the other hand, is a highly personal and attached part of culture. However, religion does not neatly correspond with ethnic identity. In many [[Multicultural|cosmopolitan]] societies, religion is everything—social, utilitarian, intellectual, political; from the point of view of people of immersed cultures; The very concept of ethnicity and its distinctions is incongruous to their immersed concepts.

In many societies, such as in those in Europe, languages are considered a significant component of ethnic values. This does not mean that most Europeans reject learning other languages. Quite the contrary, Europeans are often polyglots, and may label other individuals by their ethnicities; practical means of distinguishing cultures may resemble tendencies similar to ethnocentrism.

However, the political and cultural significance of regional or national languages are retained because these polyglots conform to the linguistic norms of the place they visit—doing "as the Romans do". Thus, conforming to the "ethnic integrity" of the region.

It has even become a cliché that "to learn a new language is to adopt a new soul". There are many other examples of the essential significance of language. In pre-[[Russia]]n [[Siberia]], [[Siberian Tatars|Tatar-Mongol]] colonists in the [[Taiga]] often recognized indigenous speakers of [[Turkic languages]] as their "own people" and non-Turkic groups as "foreigners", despite these indigenous groups having a similar level of material culture, and sharing much of a primitive culture with tribes foreign to the Muslim-Buddhist Tatar-Mongols.

==Transcultural communications==

In October 2011, U.S. communications agency [[Bromley Originate Change|Bromley]] launched a new model/[[strategy]] utilizing transcultural [[sociological]] theory as a means to segment and 'make sense' of the changing [[United States|American]] cultural landscape. Returning to classic social science as a solution, [[Bromley Originate Change|Bromley]] has embraced the anthropological approach put forward by thinkers like [[Fernando Ortiz Fernández|Fernando Ortiz]] as a way to account for ethnicity and language without being limited by them as a way for viewing the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1695">'''Teach''' is an [[Irish language]] term.

The following [[definition]] of the term has been given by [[Dónall Mac Giolla Easpaig]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''The word ''teach'', 'a house', is the only widely attested native Irish element to designate a church of monastic site in early placenames. the term is found in placenames of all periods but, generally speaking, the meaning '(monastic) church'. The late Deirdre Flanagan has suggested that the deployment of ''teach'' as an ecclesiastical placename element is a continuation of the pagan use of the term to [[denote]] sacred or mythological sites.  There is sufficient evidence available to show that [some] of the eccleiastical sitename [of Ireland] containing the element ''teach'' is of pre-Christian origin.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He further notes that along with the words [[Cíll]] and [[Díseart]] it can be loosely translated as church. Teach is purely [[Gaelic languages|Gaelic]], while the other two are derived from [[Latin]].

It is now used in Ireland to denote a secular dwelling, often a family house. An alternative form is ''tígh''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10559">A '''wayzgoose''' (or wayz-goose, waygoose or wayzegoose) was at one time an entertainment given by a master printer to his workmen each year on or about [[St Bartholomew's Day]] (24 August). It marked the traditional end of summer and the start of the season of working by candlelight. Later, the word came to refer to an annual outing and dinner for the staff of a [[printing]] works or the printers on a newspaper.

In modern times, the tradition has been adopted by large publishing and educational sales companies in The United States. Southwestern Advantage throws an annual festival at the end of the summer/fall (early September) for their most successful dealers to celebrate a long summer of work. The festivities largely consist of several days of chanting, games, and libations.

== Possible derivations ==

The derivation of the term is doubtful. It may be a misspelling for "waysgoose", from ''wase'', [[Middle English]] for "sheaf", thus meaning "sheaf" or "harvest [[goose]]", a bird eaten at harvest-time, cf. the "stubble-goose" mentioned by [[Chaucer]] in ''The Cook's Prologue''.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Wayzgoose |volume=28 |page=435 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most likely origin is the word "Weg(s)huis", which was current in early [[Modern Dutch]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} This word (literally, "way house") was one of several words meaning the English "inn" and was figuratively used for "a banquet". The Low Country origin of the word "wayzgoose" has never seriously been disputed by etymologists, seeing that much early [[Father of the Chapel|chapel]] terminology was borrowed from Low Country printers by their English apprentices (and later journeymen). The variety of spellings and pronunciations (including with and without the "z") indicate that it is an orally-borrowed Dutch word that fit somewhat uneasily in the mouth of English speakers.

Another plausible origin is a more general word for a merry-making or feast, reputedly referring to the grand goose-feast annually held at Waes, in [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], at [[Martinmas]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; However that is pronounced quite differently, as "Waas". It apparently means "cloud-veil" in Dutch: also there are no places called Waes or Waas in Brabant, but there are several places with "Waes" in their name in East Flanders.

Relations between [[England]] and the [[Low Countries]] were often very close, and it is plausible that such entertainments might have grown to be called colloquially a "Waes-Goose".&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; It is not clear why the term should have survived later in the printing trade. Certainly the goose has long ago parted company with the printers' wayzgoose, which was usually held in July,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History of Printing|year=1855|publisher=The Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge|pages=169–170|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qZEDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA169}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it had no fixed season.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;
A keepsake was often printed to commemorate the occasion. It could be printed ahead of time, or the printing could form part of the evening's activities.

Some bookbinders believe that Wayzgoose was held on St Bartholomew's Day because he was the patron saint of leather workers. It was no coincidence{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} that on August 24, 1456 the printing of the Gutenberg Bible was completed, perhaps triggering the very first wayzgoose party at Fust–Schöffer shop in Mainz.

The holiday, a break in printing, was traditionally also the day that papermakers took a break from making paper for the printers, and used up the last of the pulp to make paper for windows, waxed paper being the traditional window material for the yeoman class before the use of glass became more widespread, and after this was done, the pulp vats would be cleaned out for the new fibre, made from rags collected in the spring, and retted (prepared by rotting) over the summer.

The paper windows were fitted on St. Martin's Day (November 11).  Just as the saint had supposedly cut his cloak in half to share with a beggar during a snowstorm, so yeoman farmers would give offcuts of the windows to the poor, to help them keep warm during the coming winter.

Parchment was the original mediaeval material for keeping northern homes warm, for those who could not afford glass for the windows. The patron saint of parchment makers was the same St Bartholomew. With paper replacing parchment, the name of the traditional Martinmas party, the Wayzgoose, might have been transferred to both papermakers' and printers' parties.

A '''world language''' is spoken internationally and is learned and spoken by a large number of people as a [[second language]]. A world language is characterized not only by the total number of speakers (native and second language speakers), but also by its geographical distribution, as well as use in [[international organizations]] and [[diplomatic relations]].&lt;ref name="weltalmanach.de"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.weltalmanach.de/stichwort/stichwort_weltsprachen.html |title=Fischer Weltalmanach |publisher=S.

One of the most widely spoken and fastest spreading world languages today is [[English language|English]], which has over 980,000,000 first- and [[English as a second or foreign language|second-language]] users worldwide.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/eng |title=English |website=Ethnologue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

===Asian languages===

====Arabic====
[[Arabic language|Arabic]] gained international prominence because of the medieval [[Islamic conquests]] and the subsequent [[Arabization]] of the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], and it is also a [[liturgical language]] amongst Muslim communities outside the [[Arab World]].

====Chinese====
[[Standard Chinese]] is the direct replacement of [[Classical Chinese]], which was a historical [[lingua franca]] in [[Far East Asia]] until the early 20th century, and today serves as a common language between speakers of other [[varieties of Chinese]] not only within [[China proper]] (between the [[Han Chinese]] and other unrelated ethnic groups), but in [[overseas Chinese]] communities. It is also widely taught as a second language internationally.

====Indian languages====
The [[Languages of India|major languages]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]] have numbers of speakers comparable to those of major world languages primarily due to the large population in the region rather than a supra-regional use of these languages, although [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] (including all [[Hindi dialects]], and [[Urdu]]), [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] may fulfill the criteria in terms of supra-regional usage and international recognition.{{fact|date=August 2018}} As an example, the native speaking population of [[Bengali language|Bengali]] vastly outnumber those who speak French as a first language, and it is one of the [[List of languages by number of native speakers|most spoken languages]] (ranking fifth&lt;ref name="eth"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ethnologue.com/statistics/country |title=Summary by country |website=Ethnologue |access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; or sixth&lt;ref name=Encarta&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/media_701500404/Languages_Spoken_by_More_Than_10_Million_People.html |title=Languages Spoken by More Than 10 Million People |accessdate=2007-02-18 |publisher=Microsoft Encarta 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060109093116/http://encarta.msn.com/media_701500404/Languages_Spoken_by_More_Than_10_Million_People.html |archivedate=January 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) in the world with nearly 230 million total speakers, and is known for its long and rich literary tradition.

===European languages===

====English====
In addition to 370 million native speakers, English is estimated to have over 610 million second-language speakers,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; including anywhere between 200 and 350 million learners/users in China alone,&lt;ref name="Wei Su 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wei|first=Rining|author2=Jinzhi Su|title=The statistics of English in China|journal=English Today|publisher=Cambridge University Press|volume=28|issue=03|year=2012|pages=10–14|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0266078412000235|doi=10.1017/s0266078412000235|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; at varying levels of study and proficiency, though this number is difficult to accurately assess.&lt;ref name="Crystal2006"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://ebooks.cambridge.org/chapter.jsf?bid=CBO9780511791154&amp;cid=CBO9780511791154A019 |title=A History of the English Language |last=Crystal |first=David |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006 |editor-last=Hogg |editor-first=Richard |pages=420-439 |chapter=9 - English worldwide |editor-last2=Denison |editor-first2=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; English is also increasingly becoming the dominant language of scientific research and papers worldwide, having even outpaced national languages in Western European countries, including France, where a recent study showed that English has massively displaced French as the language of scientific research in "hard" as well as in applied sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Héran |first=François |date=June 2013 |title=No English please!

====French====
During the 19th and early 20th centuries, [[French language|French]] was the language of communication and diplomacy, and the favoured second language among the elite and the educated classes in Europe (including Russia, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, and Ukraine) - as well as in many [[Middle East and North Africa]]n countries such as Syria, Egypt, Ottoman Turkey and Iran. In addition, French enjoyed high status in some southeast Asian countries (Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia), and several South American ones like Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay. However, French has declined steadily since World War I, being gradually displaced by English - although in Lebanon, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco, French continues to be the favoured second language. Moreover, French still remains one of the [[working language]]s of many international organizations, including the [[United Nations]], [[European Union]] and [[NAFTA]]. French is also internationally recognized to be of high [[linguistic prestige]], still used in diplomacy and international commerce, as well as having a significant portion of second language speakers throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/sections/about-un/official-languages/ |title=Official Languages |website=United Nations |access-date=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====German====
[[German language|German]] served as a lingua franca in large portions of Europe for centuries, mainly the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and later the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. It remains an important second language in much of [[Central and Eastern Europe]], and in the international scientific community.

====Russian====
[[Russian language|Russian]] was used in the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[Soviet Union]], and its teaching was made compulsory in the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries. However, the use and teaching of Russian has declined sharply in both the former Eastern bloc and the [[near abroad]] since the break up of the Soviet Union and Russia’s deputy education minister was quoted as saying in December 2013 that the number of Russian speakers had fallen by 100 million since that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://thediplomat.com/2015/01/russias-waning-soft-power-in-central-asia/ |title=Russia’s Waning Soft Power in Central Asia |last=Blank  |first=Stephen |date=9 January 2015 |website=The Diplomat}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/71376 |title=Kyrgyzstan’s Russian-Language Teaching Getting Squeezed Out |  |date=15 December 2014 |work=Eurasianet |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.voanews.com/content/english-replaces-russian-as-top-foreign-language-of-study-in-ex-soviet-georgia/1528063.html |title=English Replaces Russian as Top Foreign Language of Study in Ex-Soviet Georgia |last=Brooke |first=James |date=17 October 2012 |work=VOA News}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still widely spoken throughout the [[Caucasus]], [[Central Asia]], [[Eastern Europe]] and the [[Baltic states]].

Russian is the largest [[native language]] in Europe, one of the [[Official languages of the United Nations|six official languages]] of the [[United Nations]], one of two official languages aboard the [[International Space Station]] and the third most widespread language on the [[Languages used on the Internet|Internet]] after [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_language/all |title=Usage Statistics and Market Share of Content Languages for Websites |website=w3techs.com |language=en |access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spanish====
[[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the [[List of languages by number of native speakers|world's second-most spoken native language]], after [[Mandarin Chinese]]. Spanish was used in the [[Spanish Empire]] and today is in use in [[Spain]], in [[Latin American]] countries (except Brazil, French Guyana, Suriname, Guiana, Haiti and other Caribbean islands), and is spoken in many parts of the [[United States]], particularly in Florida and the states which border Mexico. Indeed, by 2013 Spanish was the most widely taught non-English language in American secondary schools and schools of higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Goldberg |first=David |title=Enrollments in Languages Other Than English in United States Institutions of Higher Education, Fall 2013 |date=February 2015 |url=https://www.mla.org/content/download/31180/1452509/EMB_enrllmnts_nonEngl_2013.pdf |publisher=Modern Language Association of America |access-date=May 11, 2017 |last2=Looney |first2=Dennis  |last3=Lusin |first3=Natalia}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also an [[Official languages of the United Nations|official language of the United Nations]]. As of December 2017 Spanish had the third largest number of internet users by language (after English and Chinese).&lt;ref name="NIUBL-IWS"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats7.htm |title=Number of Internet Users by Language |website=Internet World Stats |access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Historical languages which had international significance as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of a historical [[empire]] include [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] in [[Ancient Egypt]]; [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] in the various [[Mesopotamia]]n civilizations and empires in the [[Ancient Near East]]; [[Ancient Greek]] in the [[Greek colonies]] in the form of various dialects, evolving to [[Koine Greek]] in the [[Hellenistic world]], after the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] and the [[Macedonian Empire]], and subsequently in the [[Greek East and Latin West|eastern part]] of the Roman Empire and the territories of the [[Byzantine Empire]]; [[Latin]] in the [[Roman Empire]] and presently as the standard liturgical language for the Catholic faithful worldwide; [[Classical Chinese]] in [[East Asia]] during the [[Imperial era of Chinese history]]; [[Persian language|Persian]] during the various succeeding [[Persian Empire]]s, and once served as the second lingua franca of the [[Islamic World]] after Arabic;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Islam: Religion, History, and Civilization |last=Nasr  |first=Seyyed Hossein |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sanskrit]] during the ancient and medieval historical periods of various states in [[South Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], and [[Central Asia]], and like Latin an important liturgical language of the [[Vedic mythology|Vedic religions]].

The [[Romance languages]] bear testimony to the role of [[Latin]] as the ''lingua franca'' of the [[Roman Empire]]; for example, [[Italian language|Italian]] has always been important in the [[Mediterranean]] region, and nowadays it is the most-spoken language among members of the [[Roman catholic]] hierarchy and it is also used in music (especially [[Opera]]) and the fashion industry. [[Turkish language|Turkish]] was similarly important as the primary language of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. [[Koine Greek]] was the "world language" of the [[Hellenistic period]], but its distribution is not reflected in the distribution of [[Modern Greek]] due to the linguistic impact of the [[Slavs|Slavic]], [[Muslim conquests|Arabic]] and [[Turkic migration|Turkic]] expansions. The distribution of the Arabic and [[Turkic languages]], in turn, are a legacy of the [[Caliphate]]s and the [[Turkic Khaganate]], respectively.

Just as all the living world languages owe their status to [[linguistic imperialism]], the suggestion of a given language as a world language or "[[universal language]]" has strong political implications. Thus, Russian was declared the "world language of [[proletarian internationalism|internationalism]]" in Soviet literature, which at the same time denounced French as the "language of fancy courtiers" and English as the "jargon of traders".&lt;ref name="Pei105"&gt;Pei, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; A number of [[international auxiliary languages]] have been introduced as prospective world languages, the most successful of them being [[Esperanto]], but none were learned by as many people as the world languages were.  Many natural languages have been proffered as candidates for a global ''[[lingua franca]]''.&lt;ref name="Pei105"/&gt;

==Living world languages==
Some sources&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-world-language.htm |title=What Is a World Language? (with pictures) |website=wisegeek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/11/what-global-language/378425/|title=What Global Language?|first=Barbara|last=Wallraff|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; define a living world language as having the following properties:
* a large number of speakers
* a substantial fraction of non-native speakers (function as ''[[lingua franca]]'')
* [[official language|official]] status in several countries
* use across several regions in the world 
* a linguistic community not defined strictly along [[ethnicity|ethnic]] lines ([[multiethnic]], [[pluricentric language]])
* one or more [[standard language|standard registers]] which are widely [[language education|taught]] as a [[foreign language]]
* association with [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|linguistic prestige]]
* use in [[international trade relations]]
* use in [[international organizations]]
* use in the [[academic community]]
* significant body of [[literature]]
 
Certain languages with greater than 100 million speakers, such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]], are not listed. Japanese, although considered to be one of the most significant languages internationally, along with the listed world languages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/reprints/weber/rep-weber.htm|title=The World's 10 most influential Languages|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is not considered a world language ''per se''. Japan as a region is nearly homogeneous from ethnic, cultural and linguistic standpoints. Thus Japanese has little history as a ''lingua franca'' amongst communities who do not share a mother tongue or first language; their overseas communities are strongly tied to ethnicity. While international interest since the 1980s has prompted many major universities, secondary schools, and even primary schools worldwide to [[Japanese language education|offer courses in the language]], Japanese only exerts a regionally limited sphere of influence.&lt;ref&gt;''cf.'' Pei p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
:{{note|Alpha|α}} In contrast to other pluricentric languages (e.g., Arabic or Malay), [[Ethnologue]] only lists "Standard German", thereby excluding Swiss German and numerous other varieties of German. Summing up Standard German as well as all undisputed German dialects/varieties (see ISO-list in infobox at [[German language]]) that are not listed under "Standard German" results in ca. 90 M native speakers. Furthermore, Ammon (2014)&lt;ref name="Ammon, 2014"/&gt; points out that Ethnologue overestimates L2 speakers, thus underestimating L1 speakers, in Germany by 5M --&gt; 95M L1 speakers.

[[File:A Specimen by William Caslon.jpg|thumb|right|''A Specimen'' of [[typeset]] [[font]]s and languages, by [[William Caslon]], letter founder; from the 1728 ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]''.]]

A '''written language''' is the representation of a spoken or gestural [[language]] by means of a [[writing system]]. Written language is an [[invention]] in that it must be taught to children, who will pick up [[spoken language]] ([[oral language|oral]] or [[sign language|sign]]) by exposure even if they are not specifically taught.

A written language exists only as a complement to a specific spoken language, and no [[natural language]] is purely written.

==Compared to spoken language==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2010}}
Written languages change more slowly than corresponding spoken languages. When at least one [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]] of a language is strongly divergent from spoken language, the resulting situation is called [[diglossia]]. However, that is still often considered as one language, between [[literary language]] and other registers, especially if the [[writing system]] reflects its [[pronunciation]].

Native readers and writers of [[English language|English]] are often unaware that the complexities of [[English spelling]] make written English a somewhat artificial construct. The traditional spelling of English, at least for inherited words, preserves a late [[Middle English]] [[phonology]] that is never used as a speech dialect. The artificial preservation of that form of the language, in writing, might make much of what is now written intelligibly to [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] (1343–1400) even if the medieval writer's speech could no longer be understood{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}.
