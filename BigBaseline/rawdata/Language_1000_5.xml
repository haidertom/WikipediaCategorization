'''American Sign Language''' ([[ASL]]) is a language that uses [[Sign language|signs]], facial expressions, and body postures to communicate ideas. [[American Sign Language|ASL]] is a rich, complex language on par with spoken languages, and employs rules of [[phonology]], [[syntax]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], etc. using manual/visual modes of communication, where spoken languages rely on the oral/aural modes of communication. ASL is used by [[Hearing loss|deaf]] and hard-of-hearing people in the North American continent, often as their primary language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/american-sign-language|title=American Sign Language|date=2015-08-18|work=NIDCD|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Language '''interpretation''' is defined by the [[International Organization for Standardization|International Standards Organization]] (ISO) as the following: "Rendering a spoken or signed message into another spoken or signed language, preserving the [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] and meaning of the source language content."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gala-global.org/what-interpreting|title=What is Interpreting?|date=2015-09-02|work=GALA Global|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASL [[Language interpretation|interpreters]] must understand the subject matter at hand{{clarify|reason=Does this merely refer to the vocabulary, or proficiency with the concepts the words represent (e.g. an interpreter in an graduate math class)?|date=July 2018}}, be able to reliably and fluently transmit the information without [[bias]], and be accustomed to navigating any kind of social situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://interpretersunlimited.com/best-asl-interpreters/|title=4 Characteristics of the Best ASL Interpreters {{!}} Interpreters Unlimited|website=interpretersunlimited.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASL interpreting is a multifaceted job, requiring management of linguistic, interpersonal, and environmental issues.

Training for ASL interpreters is highly varied, as are the education and [[Professional certification|certification]]s required for employment. Career and medical support for ASL interpreters has become a topic of concern and study in the last several years, in response to a high rate of interpreter burnout that has led to a [[shortage]] of ASL interpreters across the United States.

== The role of ASL interpreters ==
ASL interpreters work in a large variety of environments, including medical, legal, educational, mental health, vocational, and other environments. Interpreting is often viewed as a practice profession (other examples include law, teaching, counseling, [[Health professional|medicine]], etc.), which requires careful judgement of interpersonal and environmental factors as well as expertise in the skills of the profession itself.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Marschark, M., Peterson, R., &amp; Winston, E.(Eds.), Sign Language Interpreting and Interpreter Education: Directions for Research and Practice. : Oxford University Press. Retrieved 26 Apr. 2018, from http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof/9780195176940.001.0001/acprof-9780195176940.&lt;/ref&gt; The interpreter must be able to understand the concepts they are seeing and hearing, perform the mental translation, and communicate them effectively in the second language. Although the interpreter usually intends to be in the background of the conversation and not contribute beyond interpretation, overcoming differences between the languages often requires them to make judgements which might alter the flow of communication. As with any two languages, ASL and English do not have a one-to-one word correspondence, meaning interpreters cannot simply translate [[Literal translation|word-for-word]]. They must determine how to effectively communicate what one [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]] means, rather than strictly what they say, to the other. Sometimes these judgement calls and various linguistic barriers{{clarify|reason=If the primary linguistic barrier is non-literal translation, then that should simply be stated. If there are other factors, they should be explicitly listed somewhere.|date=July 2018}} cause the interpreters to affect the flow of conversation. For example: if a medical professional asks a patient if they are "sexually active," the interpretation can become complicated, because while the English phrase makes no overt reference to a partner or a specific act, in ASL it is very difficult to discuss sexual activity without reference to a partner or act. Consequently, the interpretation from English to ASL may result in the patient responding in dialogue rather than with the "yes/no" answer that the doctor might be expecting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Often, interpreters must manage situations in which the interlocuters' comments include [[connotation]]s that may be lost on the other party, and the interpreter is left with the decision of how to convey those connotations, or whether they even have the authority to do so. For example, a doctor may ask an interpreter to relay to the patient, "There is nothing more we can do for you. We're going to make you as comfortable as we can." While the literal meaning of the expression is easily conveyed, the interpreter would be aware that the [[Euphemism|euphemistic]] nature of this phrase in English might be lost on the deaf patient. Thus, the interpreter would put in the position of bluntly telling the patient that they are going to die. In a situation such as this, the interpreter may elect to discuss the interpretive difficulty with the doctor and allow the doctor the opportunity to communicate with the patient more directly and less euphemistically. The interpreter must not only be able to recognize the linguistic barrier in this situation, but also must be aware of the [[Interpersonal communication|interpersonal]] factors involved in the situation and the limitations of their role.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Challenges for the ASL interpreter ==
Degree programs in ASL Interpreting are available at colleges, universities, and technical schools across the country, ranging from [[associate degree]]s to [[master's degree]]s. In addition, interpreters work with mentors, attend workshops, and get certifications to become more adept, gain experience, and open additional career opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rid.org/about-rid/about-interpreting/become-an-interpreter/about-interpreting-education-programs-2/|title=Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf, Inc.|last=|first=|date=|website=rid.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, much research has gone into discerning whether ASL interpreters have access to adequate, specialized, real-world training and career support systems to ensure success and protect against interpreter burnout. Many studies note interpreter reports of frustration with training that proved inadequate to deal with real-world problems, and a lack of professional support.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Robyn K. Dean, Robert Q Pollard; Application of Demand-Control Theory to Sign Language Interpreting: Implications for Stress and Interpreter Training, ''The Journal of Deaf Studies and Deaf Education'', Volume 6, Issue 1, 1 January 2001, Pages 1–14, {{doi|10.1093/deafed/6.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of factors contribute to [[Psychological stress|stress]] for the interpreter: variable working conditions, expectations, and even understanding of the interpreter's role and responsibilities can all play a part. Often, interpreters are party to emotional or traumatizing experiences because they are needed to interpret in those situations, with no outlet for dealing with their internal reactions to them. Interpreters also experience physical stress, often in the form of cumulative trauma disorders such as [[carpal tunnel syndrome]] that may require them to take time off work to recuperate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Interpreting ASL as a profession carries a variety of demands. Robyn Dean and Robert Pollard, in applying control-demand theory to the profession, identify four categories of demands:

* Linguistic Demand—Demands that are directly or indirectly related to language itself. These include the clarity with which the interlocutors speak or sign, the interlocutor's language fluency, use of technical vocabulary, voice volume, etc. 
* Environmental Demand—Demands that are related to the setting of the interpretation. These include sight lines, background noise, lighting quality, visual distractions, seating arrangements, odors, etc.
* Interpersonal Demand—Demands that are related to the interaction of the interlocutors, as well as other people nearby. These include power and authority dynamics between the interlocutors, each person's understanding of the role of the interpreter, turn-taking, communication directed to the interpreter, etc.
* Intrapersonal Demand—Demands that relate to the interpreter themselves, either physically or psychologically. These include [[Vicarious traumatization|vicarious]] reactions, safety concerns, doubts about their performance, isolation, liability concerns, etc.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The relative lack of interpreter [[Postgraduate education|post-graduate]] training does little to prepare interpreters to deal with the varied demands above, which each may be prominent depending on the present interpreting job. Heller et al. (1986), Swartz (1999), and Watson (1987) (cited in Dean and Pollard 2001) all agree that this environment is a large contributor to interpreter burnout and, by extension, the current shortage of ASL interpreters in the United States.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, steps are being taken by several entities, including the Conference of Interpreter Trainers (CIT) and the [[Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf]] (RID), to create and adopt [[Academic standards|standards]] by which training programs can be judged. Laurie Swabey and Karen Malcolm's book ''In Our Hands: Educating Healthcare Interpreters'' (2012) discusses the specific difficulties that interpreters face in medical fields. The book covers issues that arise in mental health interpreting, the risks of vicarious trauma, explorations of authentic interactions to aid in discourse training, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Swabey, A. &amp; Malcolm, Karen. ''In Our Hands: Educating Healthcare Interpreters.'' Washington: Gallaudet University Press, 2012. ''Project MUSE'',&lt;/ref&gt; ''Topics in Signed Language Interpreting: Theory and Practice'', edited by Terry Janzen (2005), covers, among other things, the issues that arise with simultaneous interpretation, [[ethics]] and professionalism as they relate to interpreting, and a Deaf community perspective on best practices for interpreters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Topics in Signed Language Interpreting: Theory and Practice|last=Janzen|first=Terry|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|year=2005|isbn=9789027294159|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, a cohesive standard for postgraduate training and career support for ASL interpreters has yet to materialize.

The '''Adamic language''' is, according to [[Jews|Jewish]] tradition (as recorded in the ''[[midrash]]im'') and some [[Christians]], the language spoken by [[Adam]] (and possibly [[Eve]]) in the [[Garden of Eden]]. It is variously interpreted as either the language used by [[God]] to address Adam (the [[divine language]]), or the language invented by Adam with which he named all things (including Eve), as in the [[Genesis creation narrative]] ({{bibleref|Genesis|2:19|KJV}}).

== Middle Ages ==
{{further|Confusion of tongues|Lingua ignota}}

Traditional Jewish exegesis such as [[Midrash]] ([[Genesis Rabbah]] 38) says that Adam spoke the [[Hebrew language]] because the names he gives Eve – ''Isha'' ([[Book of Genesis]] 2:23) and ''Chava'' (Genesis 3:20) – only make sense in Hebrew. By contrast, [[Kabbalism]] assumed an "eternal Torah" which was not identical to the Torah written in Hebrew. Thus, [[Abulafia]]{{which|date=July 2016}} in the 13th century assumed that the language spoken in [[Paradise]] had been different from Hebrew, and rejected the claim then-current also among Christian authors, that a child left unexposed to linguistic stimulus would automatically begin to speak in Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Eco, ''The Search for the Perfect Language'' (1993), p. 32 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Umberto Eco]] (1993) notes that Genesis is ambiguous on whether the language of Adam was preserved by Adam's descendants until the [[confusion of tongues]] (Genesis 11:1–9), or if it began to evolve naturally even before Babel (Genesis 10:5).&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Eco, ''The Search for the Perfect Language'' (1993), 7–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dante Alighieri]] addresses the topic in his ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]'' (1302-1305). He argues that the Adamic language is of divine origin and therefore unchangeable.&lt;ref&gt;Mazzocco, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; He also notes that according to Genesis, the first speech act is due to Eve, addressing [[Serpents in the Bible|the serpent]], and not to Adam.&lt;ref&gt;''mulierem invenitur ante omnes fuisse locutam''. Umberto Eco, ''The Search for the Perfect Language'' (1993), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' (c. 1308-1320), however, Dante changes his view to another that treats the Adamic language as the product of Adam.&lt;ref&gt;Mazzocco, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; This had the consequence that it could not any longer be regarded immutable, and hence Hebrew could not be regarded as identical with the language of Paradise. Dante concludes (''Paradiso'' XXVI) that Hebrew is a derivative of the language of Adam. In particular, the chief Hebrew name for God in scholastic tradition, ''[[El (god)|El]]'', must be derived of a different Adamic name for God, which Dante gives as ''[[Close front unrounded vowel|I]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Paradiso'' 26.133f.; Mazzocco, p. 178f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabethan scholar [[John Dee]] makes references to an [[occult]] or angelic language recorded in his private journals and those of [[spirit medium]] [[Edward Kelley]]. Dee's journals did not describe the language as "[[Enochian]]", instead preferring "Angelical", the "Celestial Speech", the "Language of Angels", the "First Language of God-Christ", the "Holy Language", or "Adamical" because, according to Dee's Angels, it was used by Adam in Paradise to name all things. The language was later dubbed Enochian, due to Dee's assertion that the [[Biblical Patriarch]] [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] had been the last human (before Dee and Kelley) to know the language.

Dutch physician, linguist, and humanist [[Johannes Goropius Becanus]] (1519–1572) theorized in ''Origines Antwerpianae'' (1569) that [[Antwerp]]ian [[Brabantic]], spoken in the region between the [[Scheldt]] and [[Meuse]] Rivers, was the original language spoken in Paradise. Goropius believed that the most ancient language on Earth would be the simplest language, and that the simplest language would contain mostly short words. Since Brabantic has a higher number of short words than do Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, Goropius reasoned that it was the older language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gorporius Becanus |first=Johannes |date=2014 |title=Van Adam tot Antwerpen: Een bloemlezing uit de Origines Antwerpianae en de Opera van Johannes Goropius Becanus |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=bgWyCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=265 |location=Hilversum |publisher=Uitgeverij Verloren |page=265–277 |isbn=9789087044312 |accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work influenced that of [[Simon Stevin]] (1548–1620), who espoused similar ideas in "Uytspraeck van de weerdicheyt der Duytse tael", a chapter in ''[[De Beghinselen Der Weeghconst]]'' (1586).

=== Opponents ===
By the 17th century, the existence and nature of the alleged Adamic language was commonly discussed amongst European Jewish and Christian mystics and primitive linguists.&lt;ref name="Noordegraaf"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Noordegraaf |first=Jan |date=1983 |title=Nog eens Hedendaagsch fetischisme |url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_voo004198301_01/_voo004198301_01_0009.php |journal=Voortgang |publisher= Stichting Neerlandistiek VU |volume=4 |issue=10 |pages=193–230 |accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Boyle]] (1627–1691) was skeptical that Hebrew was the language best capable of describing the nature of things, stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I could never find, that the Hebrew names of animals, mentioned in the beginning of Genesis, argued a (much) clearer insight into their natures, than did the names of the same or some other animals in Greek, or other languages (1665:45).&lt;ref name="Noordegraaf"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[John Locke]] (1632–1704) expressed similar skepticism in his ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690).&lt;ref name="Noordegraaf"/&gt;

== Modern period ==

=== Latter Day Saint movement ===
[[Joseph Smith]], founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], in his [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible|revision of the Bible]], declared the Adamic language to have been "pure and undefiled".&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Moses]] [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/moses/6/6#6 6:6].&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Latter Day Saints]] believe it to be the language of [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= John S. |last= Robertson |contribution-url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/5449 |contribution= Adamic Language |pages= 18–19 |editor-last= Ludlow |editor-first= Daniel H |editor-link= Daniel H.

However, this belief seems to have never been formally or officially adopted.&lt;ref&gt;Copeland, Lee. "Speaking in Tongues in the Restoration Churches", ''Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought'', Vol 24, No. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other early Latter Day Saint leaders, including [[Brigham Young]],&lt;ref&gt;Brigham Young, [http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/MStar&amp;CISOPTR=7661&amp;filename=7662.pdf "History of Brigham Young"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612023524/http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=%2FMStar&amp;CISOPTR=7661&amp;filename=7662.pdf |date=12 June 2011 }}, ''[[Millennial Star]]'', vol. 25, no. 28, p. 439 (1863-07-11), cited in ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'' '''1''':297, footnote (Young prays in the Adamic tongue).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orson Pratt]],&lt;ref name=Pratt&gt;''[[Journal of Discourses]]'' [http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/JournalOfDiscourses3&amp;CISOPTR=1953&amp;filename=100504_170857_cp342_Va_M230_J82_v02.pdf '''2''':342]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025133000/http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=%2FJournalOfDiscourses3&amp;CISOPTR=1953&amp;filename=100504_170857_cp342_Va_M230_J82_v02.pdf |date=25 October 2007 }} (God = "Ahman"; Son of God = "Son Ahman"; Men = "Sons Ahman"; Angel = "Anglo-man").&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Elizabeth Ann Whitney]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Woman's Exponent]]'' [http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/WomansExp&amp;CISOPTR=6638&amp;filename=6639.pdf '''7''':83]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025132953/http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=%2FWomansExp&amp;CISOPTR=6638&amp;filename=6639.pdf |date=25 October 2007 }} (1 November 1878) (Whitney sings a hymn in the Adamic tongue).&lt;/ref&gt; claimed to have received several words in the Adamic language by [[revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelation]]. Some Latter Day Saints believe that the Adamic language is the "pure language" spoken of by [[Zephaniah]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Zephaniah|Zephaniah]] {{bibleverse-nb||Zephaniah|3:9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it will be restored as the [[universal language]] of humankind at the end of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oliver Cowdery]], [http://patriot.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/NCMP1820-1846&amp;CISOPTR=10065&amp;filename=5298.pdf "The Prophecy of Zephaniah"]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[Evening and Morning Star]]'', vol. 2, no. 18, p. 142 (March 1834).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce R. McConkie]] (1966, 2d ed.). ''[[Mormon Doctrine]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Bookcraft) p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ezra Taft Benson]] (1988). ''Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Bookcraft) p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Apostle (LDS Church)|Apostle]] [[Orson Pratt]] declared that "Ahman", part of the name of the settlement "[[Adam-ondi-Ahman]]" in [[Daviess County, Missouri]], was the name of God in the Adamic language.&lt;ref name = Pratt/&gt; An 1832 handwritten page from  the [[Joseph Smith Papers]], titled "A Sample of the Pure Language", and reportedly dictated by Smith to "Br. Johnson", asserts that the name of God is ''Awmen''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20161122044333/http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/sample-of-pure-language-between-circa-4-and-circa-20-march-1832/1 "Sample of the Pure Language" ca. March 1832]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latter Day Saint [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|endowment]] [[prayer circle]] once included use of the words "Pay Lay Ale".&lt;ref&gt;Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith, ''The Mormon Murders'' (New York: St. Martins's Press, 1988) {{ISBN|0-312-93410-6}}, p. 69. "the sign of the Second Token [is] raising both hands and then lowering them while repeating the incantation "Pay Lay Ale" three times"&lt;/ref&gt; These untranslated words are no longer used in [[Temple (LDS Church)|temple]] [[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]] and have been replaced by an English version, "O God, hear the words of my mouth".&lt;ref name = SLCM&gt;[http://www.utlm.org/newsletters/no76.htm "Current Mormon Temple Ceremony Now Available"], ''[[Salt Lake City Messenger]]'', no. 76, November 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe that the "Pay Lay Ale" sentence is derived from the Hebrew phrase "pe le-El" ({{lang|he|פה לאל}}), "mouth to God".&lt;ref name = SLCM/&gt;

Other words thought by some Latter Day Saints to derive from the Adamic language include ''[[Deseret (Book of Mormon)|deseret]]'' ("honey bee"), see [[Book of Ether|Ether]] [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/ether/2/3#3 2:3] and ''Ahman'' ("God") see [[Doctrine and Covenants]] [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/doctrineandcovenants/78/20#20 78:20] 

The [[Book of Moses]] refers to "a book of remembrance" written in the language of Adam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/moses/6/5,46#5 Moses 6:5, 46].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|text=[[dislocation (syntax)|dislocation]]s, an apposition-like structure whose elements are not placed side by side|opposition (disambiguation)}}

'''Apposition''' is a [[grammatical]] construction in which two elements, normally [[noun phrase]]s, are placed side by side, with one element serving to identify the other in a different way; the two elements are said to be ''in apposition''. One of the elements is called the '''appositive''', although its identification requires consideration of how the elements are used in a sentence.

For example, in the two sentences below, the phrases ''Alice Smith'' and ''my sister'' are in apposition, with the appositive identified with italics:
* My sister, ''Alice Smith'', likes jelly beans.
* Alice Smith, ''my sister'', likes jelly beans.

Traditionally, appositions were called by their [[Latin language|Latin]] name ''appositio'', although the English form is now more commonly used. It is derived from Latin: ''ad'' ("near") and ''positio'' ("placement").

Apposition is a figure of speech of the [[scheme (linguistics)|scheme]] type, and often results when the verbs (particularly verbs of being) in supporting clauses are eliminated to produce shorter descriptive phrases. This makes them often function as [[hyperbaton]]s, or figures of disorder, because they can disrupt the flow of a sentence. For example, in the phrase: "My wife, a nurse by training, ...", it is necessary to pause before the parenthetical modification "a nurse by training".

==Restrictive versus non-restrictive==
&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Non-restrictive appositive]] --&gt;
&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Restrictive appositive]] --&gt;

A '''restrictive appositive''' provides information essential to identifying the phrase in apposition.
It limits or clarifies that phrase in some crucial way, and the meaning of the sentence would change if the appositive were removed.
In English, restrictive appositives are not set off by [[comma (punctuation)|comma]]s.
The sentences below use restrictive appositives. Here and elsewhere in this section, the relevant phrases are marked as the ''appositive phrase''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; or the ''phrase in apposition''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;.
* ''My friend''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt; ''Alice Smith''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; likes jelly beans. &lt;small&gt;– I have many friends, but I am restricting my statement to the one named Alice Smith.&lt;/small&gt;
* He likes ''the television show''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt; ''The Simpsons''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;small&gt;– There are many television shows, and he likes that particular one.&lt;/small&gt;

A '''non-restrictive appositive''' provides information not critical to identifying the phrase in apposition.
It provides non-essential information, and the essential meaning of the sentence would not change if the appositive were removed.
In English, non-restrictive appositives are typically set off by commas.&lt;ref name=WritingPU&gt;
[http://www.princeton.edu/writing/center/resources/commas.pdf "Commas: Some Common Problems"]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Princeton Writing Program, [[Princeton University]], 1999, ''princeton.edu/writing/center/resources/''.&lt;/ref&gt;
The sentences below use non-restrictive appositives.
* ''Alice Smith''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;, ''my friend''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;, likes jelly beans. &lt;small&gt;– The fact that Alice is my friend was not necessary to identify her.&lt;/small&gt;
* I visited ''Canada''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;, ''a beautiful country''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;small&gt;– The appositive is not needed to identify Canada.&lt;/small&gt;
* ''The first to arrive at the house''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;, ''she''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt; unlocked the front door.

The same phrase can be a restrictive appositive in one context and a non-restrictive appositive in another:
* ''My brother''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt; ''Nathan''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; is here. &lt;small&gt;– Restrictive: I have many brothers, and the one named Nathan is here.&lt;/small&gt;
* ''My brother''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;, ''Nathan''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;, is here. &lt;small&gt;– Non-restrictive: I have only one brother and, as an aside, his name is Nathan.&lt;/small&gt;
If there is any doubt that the appositive is non-restrictive, it is safer to use the restrictive form.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}
In the example above, the restrictive first sentence is still correct even if there is only one brother.

A [[restrictiveness|relative clause]] is not always an appositive.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}
* ''My sister''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;, ''Alice Smith''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;, likes jelly beans. &lt;small&gt;– The appositive is the noun phrase ''Alice Smith''.&lt;/small&gt;
* ''My sister''&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;, ''a doctor whose name is Alice Smith''&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;, likes jelly beans. &lt;small&gt;– The appositive is the noun phrase with dependent relative clause ''a doctor whose name is Alice Smith''.&lt;/small&gt;
* My sister, whose name is Alice Smith, likes jelly beans. &lt;small&gt;– There is no appositive. There is a relative clause: ''whose name is Alice Smith''.&lt;/small&gt;

==Examples==
In the following examples, the appositive phrases are shown in italics:

* I was born in Finland, ''the land of a thousand lakes''. &lt;small&gt;– Appositives are not limited to describing people.&lt;/small&gt;
* Barry Goldwater, ''the junior senator from Arizona'', received the Republican nomination in 1964.
* John and Bob, ''both friends of mine'', are starting a band.
* Alexander the Great, ''the Macedonian conqueror of Persia'', was one of the most successful military commanders of the ancient world.
* Dean Martin, ''a very popular singer'', will be performing at the Sands Hotel.
* You are better than anyone, ''anyone I've ever met''.
* ''A staunch supporter of democracy'', Rob campaigned against the king's authoritarian rule.

A kind of appositive is the [[false title]], a restrictive phrase, as in "''Noted biologist'' Jane Smith has arrived.", where the phrase ''Noted biologist'' is used as an informal title. The use of false titles is [[False title#Controversy|controversial]].

Appositive phrases can also serve as definitions:
* No one – ''not a single person'' – should ever suffer that way.
&lt;!-- Is the following really an appositive? "the best" is a noun phrase, "better than all the rest" is an adjective phrase --&gt;
* You're simply the best, ''better than all the rest''.

==Appositive genitive==
In several languages, the same syntax that is used to express such relations as possession can also be used appositively. Examples include:

* In English:
** "Appositive oblique", a prepositional phrase with ''of'' as in: ''the month of December'', ''the sin of pride'', or ''the city of New York''. This has also been invoked as an explanation for the [[English possessive#Double genitive|double genitive]]: ''a friend of mine''.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 5, §14.3 (pages 447–448), Rodney Huddleston, Geoffrey K. Pullum, ''The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-521-43146-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** The ending ''-'s'' as in "[[In Dublin's Fair City]]". This is uncommon.
* In classical Greek:
** "Genitive of explanation" as in {{lang-gr|italic=yes|ὑὸς μέγα χρῆμα}} (hyòs méga chrêma), "a monster (great affair) of a boar" ([[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories of Herodotus]], 1.36);&lt;ref&gt;§1322 (pages 317–318), [[Herbert Weir Smyth]], revised by Gordon M. Messing, ''Greek Grammar'', Cambridge, Massachusetts : Harvard University Press, 1956 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0007&amp;query=head%3D%23366 Perseus Digital Library]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Japanese:

"'''Archi-writing'''" ({{lang-fr|archi-écriture}}) is a term used by French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] in his attempt to re-orient the relationship between speech and writing. 

Derrida argued that as far back as [[Plato]], speech had been always given priority over writing. In the West, phonetic writing was considered as a secondary imitation of speech, a poor copy of the immediate living act of speech. Derrida argued that in later centuries philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] both gave writing a secondary or parasitic role. In Derrida's essay ''Plato's Pharmacy'', he sought to question this prioritising by firstly complicating the two terms speech and writing.

According to Derrida, this complication is visible in the Greek word φάρμακον ''pharmakon'', which meant both "cure" and "poison". Derrida noted that Plato argued that writing was "poisonous" to memory, since writing is a mere repetition, as compared to the living memory required for speech. Derrida points out however, that since both speech and writing rely upon repetition they cannot be completely distinguished.

In the [[neologism]] ''archi-writing'', "archi-" meaning "origin, principle, or [[wikt:telos|telos]]", attempts to go beyond the simple division of writing/speech. Archi-writing refers to a kind of writing that precedes both speech and writing. Derrida argued that archi-writing is, in a sense, language, in that it is already there before we use it, it already has a pregiven, yet malleable, structure/genesis, which is a semi-fixed set-up of different words and syntax. This ''fixedness'' is the writing to which Derrida refers, just such a 'writing' can even be seen in cultures that do not employ ''writing'', it could be seen in notches on a rope or barrel, fixed customs, or placements around the living areas.

==Criticism==

Philosopher [[John R. Searle]] argued that most of Derrida's concepts were characterized by a "breathtaking implausibility", being based on an "eccentric reading of the history of Western philosophy", which overlooks or misstates many important details of philosophy and language (e.g., Derrida distorts Saussure's [[structural linguistics]]).&lt;ref&gt;Searle, John R. (1983) "The Word Turned Upside Down", ''The New York Review of Books'', Volume 30, Number 16, October 27, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6837">The '''Articulatory approach''' to teaching pronunciation considers learning how to pronounce a [[second language]] to be a [[motor skill]] which most students are not in a position to develop based on self-evaluation of their production. The role of the teacher is therefore to provide feedback on students' performance as part of coaching them in the movements of the [[vocal tract]] articulators (tongue, jaw, lips, etc.) which create speech sounds.

The Articulatory approach is an alternative to the imitative-intuitive and analytic-linguistic approaches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Celce-Murcia|first1=Marianne|last2=Brinton|first2=Donna|last3=Goodwin|first3=Janet|title=Teaching Pronunciation|date=2010|publisher=CUP|isbn=978-0521729765|page=2|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; both of which involve the teacher providing a model for her students to imitate. The model might be her own voice or a recording. In the articulatory approach, the students are not asked to match a model but instead to experiment with making sounds, with the teacher acting as a source of ideas, encouragement and feedback on how close the students are getting to the target.

== The problem of categorical perception ==
When learning a new language, students are not in a position to compare [[First language|L1]] and [[Second language|L2]] sounds competently because the L2 sounds are evaluated using the [[categorical perception]] developed for L1. [[Trubetzkoy]] described the process as follows:&lt;ref&gt;N.S.Trubetzkoy, N.S. (1939) Grundzüge der Phonologie (Principles of Phonology), p.51
&lt;/ref&gt; "The phonological system of a language is like a sieve through which everything that is said passes ... Each person acquires the system of his mother tongue. But when he hears another language spoken, he intuitively uses the familiar 'phonological sieve' of his mother tongue to analyze what has been said. However, since this sieve is not suited for the foreign language, numerous mistakes and misinterpretations are the result. The sounds of the foreign language receive an incorrect phonological interpretation since they are strained through the 'phonological sieve' of one's own mother tongue."

Users of the imitative-intuitive approach, who simply give their students a model to imitate ('Listen and Repeat') believe that this problem will resolve itself with exposure to L2 over the course of time. Users of the analytic-linguistic approach address the problem explicitly through listening exercises, recently including high variability phonetic training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Logan|first1=John|last2=Lively|first2=Scott|last3=Pisoni|first3=David|title=Training Japanese listeners to identify English /r/ and /l/: A first report|journal=J Acoust Soc Am|date=1991|volume=89|issue=2|pages=874–886}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Iverson|first1=Paul|last2=Hazan|first2=Valerie|last3=Bannister|first3=Kerry|title=Phonetic training with acoustic cue manipulations: A comparison of methods for teaching English /r/-/l/ to Japanese adults|journal=J Acoust Soc Am|date=2005|volume=118|issue=5|pages=3267–3278|doi=10.1121/1.2062307}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both approaches, it is believed that as students improve their perception of L2 sounds, they will be better able to match their production of L2 sounds to the models provided.

Proponents of the articulatory approach argue that it is more efficient to begin by working on the production of L2 sounds directly (as a motor skill rather than an imitative task) and that this leads to improved L2 perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Linebaugh|first1=Gary|last2=Roche|first2=Thomas|title=Evidence that L2 production training can enhance perception|journal=Journal of Academic Language &amp; Learning|date=2015|volume=9|issue=1|pages=1–17|url=http://journal.aall.org.au/index.php/jall/article/view/326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the late nineteenth century, [[Henry Sweet]] argued for the coaching of students in the use of their articulators: "Those who try to learn new sounds by ear alone, without any systematic training in the use of their vocal organs, generally succeed only partially. ... In the case of those who have only an average ear, and still more of those who have a defective ear, organic training is indispensable. There can be no question that flexible organs well trained together with only an average ear, will yield better results than even an exceptionally good ear without organic training. Nor must it be forgotten that fineness of ear is not necessarily accompanied by flexibility of the vocal organs."&lt;ref&gt;Sweet, H. (1877) A Handbook of Phonetics, London: MacMillan p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the phonetician [[J. C. Catford]] presented readers with "a series of simple introspective experiments [to be] carried out inside their own vocal tracts, their own throats and mouths. By actually making sounds (very often silently) and attending to the muscular sensations that accompany their production one can discover how they are produced ..."&lt;ref&gt;Catford, J. C. (1988) A practical introduction to phonetics. Oxford: Clarendon Press p.v&lt;/ref&gt;

Catford and Pisoni&lt;ref&gt;Catford, J. C. and Pisoni, D. B. (1970) Auditory vs. Articulatory Training in Exotic Sounds. The Modern Language Journal, 54: 477–481. {{doi|10.1111/j.1540-4781.1970.tb03581.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; undertook a small scale experiment in which they found that students learnt both the pronunciation and discrimination of foreign sounds better when they were explicitly taught how to produce them than when they were taught how to discriminate them by ear.

== Contemporary language teaching ==
Within foreign language teaching, the best known proponent of an articulatory approach was [[Caleb Gattegno]]. In his [[Silent Way]], the teacher does not model sounds, but encourages experimentation on the part of students, and gives them feedback on how closely they are approaching their targets.&lt;ref&gt;Kho, Mu-Jeong (2016).

'''Cluttering''' (also called '''tachyphemia''' or '''tachyphrasia''') is a [[speech disorder|speech]] and [[communication disorder]] characterized by a rapid rate of speech, erratic rhythm, and poor [[syntax]] or grammar, making speech difficult to understand.

==Classification==
Cluttering is a [[speech disorder|speech]] and [[communication disorder]] that has also been described as a [[fluency]] disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Daly
 | first = David A.
 |author2=Burnett, Michelle L.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is defined as:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Cluttering is a fluency disorder characterized by a rate that is perceived to be abnormally rapid, irregular, or both for the speaker (although measured syllable rates may not exceed normal limits). These rate abnormalities further are manifest in one or more of the following symptoms: (a) an excessive number of [[disfluencies]], the majority of which are not typical of people with [[stuttering]]; (b) the frequent placement of pauses and use of [[prosodic|prosodic patterns]] that do not conform to [[syntactic]] and [[semantic]] constraints; and (c) inappropriate (usually excessive) degrees of [[coarticulation]] among sounds, especially in multisyllabic words".&lt;ref&gt;St. Louis, K. O., Myers, F. L., Bakker, K., &amp; Raphael, L. J. (2007). Understanding and treating cluttering. In E. G. Conture &amp; R. F. Curlee (Eds.) Stuttering and related disorders of fluency, 3rd ed. (pp. 297-325). NY: Thieme.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[Stuttering]] is often misapplied as a common term referring to any dysfluency. It is also often incorrectly applied to normal dysfluency rather than dysfluency from a disorder.  Cluttered speech is exhibited by normal speakers, and is often referred to as stuttering. This is especially true when the speaker is nervous, where nervous speech more closely resembles cluttering than stuttering.

Cluttering is sometimes confused with stuttering. Both communication disorders break the normal flow of speech, but they are distinct. A stutterer has a coherent pattern of thoughts, but may have a difficult time vocally expressing those thoughts; in contrast, a clutterer has no problem putting thoughts into words, but those thoughts become disorganized during speaking. Cluttering affects not only speech, but also thought patterns, writing, typing, and conversation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stammering.org/cluttered.html When speech is too cluttered - British Stammering Association&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511151645/http://www.stammering.org/cluttered.html |date=2008-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stutterers are usually dysfluent on initial sounds, when beginning to speak, and become more fluent towards the ends of utterances. In contrast, clutterers are most clear at the start of utterances, but their speaking rate increases and intelligibility decreases towards the end of utterances.

Stuttering is characterized by struggle behavior, such as overtense speech production muscles. Cluttering, in contrast, is effortless.  Cluttering is also characterized by [[Relaxed pronunciation|slurred speech]], especially dropped or distorted /r/ and /l/ sounds; and monotone speech that starts loud and trails off into a murmur.

A clutterer described the feeling associated with a clutter as:
{{cquote|It feels like 1) about twenty thoughts explode on my mind all at once, and I need to express them all, 2) that when I'm trying to make a point, that I just remembered something that I was supposed to say, so the person can understand, and I need to interrupt myself to say something that I should have said before, and 3) that I need to constantly revise the sentences that I'm working on, to get it out right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Differential diagnosis==
Cluttering can often be confused with [[language delay]], [[language disorder]], [[learning disabilities]], and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | year = 1999
 | page=233
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Clutterers often have [[reading disabilities|reading]] and writing disabilities, especially sprawling, disorderly handwriting, which poorly integrate ideas and space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.content.onlypunjab.com/Article/Fluency-Disorders--Stuttering-vs-Cluttering/4200320092003249120 Fluency Disorders: Stuttering vs Cluttering&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120729022709/http://www.content.onlypunjab.com/Article/Fluency-Disorders--Stuttering-vs-Cluttering/4200320092003249120 |date=2012-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Because clutterers have poor awareness of their disorder, they may be indifferent or even hostile to speech-language pathologists. [[Delayed auditory feedback]] (DAF) is usually used to produce a more deliberate, exaggerated oral-motor response pattern. Other treatment components include improving [[narrative structure]] with [[Storytelling|story-telling]] [[picture book]]s, turn-taking practice, pausing practice, and language therapy.

==History==
[[Battaros]] was a legendary [[Libya]]n king who spoke quickly and in a disorderly fashion.  Others who spoke as he did were said to suffer from ''battarismus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | first=Deso A.
 | last=Weiss

 | page=1
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the earliest record of the speech disorder of cluttering.

In the 1960s, cluttering was called ''tachyphemia'', a word derived from the Greek for "fast speech". This word is no longer used to describe cluttering because fast speech is not a required element of cluttering.

Deso Weiss described cluttering as the outward manifestation of a "central language imbalance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The First World Conference on Cluttering was held in May 2007 in [[Razlog]], [[Bulgaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had over 60 participants from North America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wvutoday.wvu.edu/n/2007/07/16/5871 WVU researcher hopes to have the last word on 'cluttering' speech disorder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215150643/http://wvutoday.wvu.edu/n/2007/07/16/5871 |date=2015-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
Weiss claimed that Battaros, [[Demosthenes]], [[Pericles]], [[Justinian]], [[Otto von Bismarck]], and [[Winston Churchill]] were clutterers.  He says about these people, "Each of these contributors to [[World History|world history]] viewed his world holistically, and was not deflected by exaggerated attention to small details.  Perhaps then, they excelled because of, rather than in spite of, their 
[cluttering]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2624">'''Cognitive hearing science''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] science field concerned with the physiological and cognitive basis of hearing and its interplay with [[signal processing]] in [[hearing aid]]s. The field includes [[genetics]], [[physiology]], medical and technical [[audiology]], cognitive [[neuroscience]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[linguistics]] and [[social psychology]].

Theoretically the research in cognitive hearing science combines a physiological model for the information transfer from the outer [[Ear|auditory]] organ to the auditory [[cerebral cortex]], and a cognitive model for how [[language comprehension]] is influenced by the interplay between the incoming language signal and the individual's [[cognition|cognitive]] skills, especially the [[long-term memory]] and the [[working memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Project database |  url=http://vrproj.vr.se/detail.asp?arendeid=57495 | publisher=[[Swedish Research Council]] | accessdate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers examine the interplay between type of [[hearing impairment]] or [[deafness]], type of signal processing in different [[hearing aid]]s, type of listening environment and the individual's cognitive skills.

Research in cognitive hearing science has importance for the knowledge about different types of hearing impairment and its effects, as for the possibilities to determine which individuals can make use of certain type of signal processing in hearing aid or [[cochlear implant]] and thereby adapt hearing aid to the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=About Linnaeus Centre Head p. 3-4 |  url=http://www.ibl.liu.se/cdd/ihv/högerspalt-startsida-ihv/1.189512/broschyrHEADLinncentrum.pdf | publisher=[[Linköping University]] | accessdate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive hearing science has been introduced by researchers at the [[Linköping University]] research centre Linnaeus Centre HEAD (HEaring And Deafness) in Sweden, created in 2008 with a major 10-year grant from the Swedish Research Council.

'''''Crazy English''''' is a 1999 [[Cinema of China|Chinese documentary]] directed by [[Zhang Yuan (director)|Zhang Yuan]]. The film premiered along with Zhang's ''[[Seventeen Years (film)|Seventeen Years]]'' at the 1999 [[Locarno International Film Festival]]. It established Zhang's position as a "legitimate" director after years of working independently from, and often at odds with, the Chinese [[State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television|authorities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117914650.html|title=Seventeen Years Review|publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|author=Elley, Derek |date=1999-09-13 |accessdate=2008-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to earlier films, like ''[[East Palace, West Palace]]'' (1997), ''Crazy English'' was produced with the cooperation of the state-owned [[Xi'an Film Studio]], which enjoys a "presented by" billing in the film's credits.&lt;ref name=Elley&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117914589.html|title=Crazy English Review| author= Elley, Derek| publisher = ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' | date=1999-08-30|accessdate=2008-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subject ==
{{main|Li Yang (Crazy English)}}

The film follows one of the [[People's Republic of China]]'s most popular motivational speakers, [[Li Yang (Crazy English)|Li Yang]], the founder of "[[Crazy English]]". Li is known for his stadium-sized presentations where he exhorts his audiences to engage in mass recitations of English phrases and [[idiom]]s, often with a strong [[Chinese nationalism|nationalist]] bent: "Conquer English to Make China Stronger!".&lt;ref name=NYer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/04/28/080428fa_fact_osnos|title=Letter from China: Crazy English: Reporting and Essays| publisher = ''[[The New Yorker]]'' | author = Osnos, Evan| authorlink = Evan Osnos | date = 2008-04-28| accessdate=2008-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Li, however, has also courted controversy. Despite the fact that he teaches a foreign language, Li has never left China, a fact not revealed in the film until the end.&lt;ref name=Elley/&gt; Other common criticisms, including accusations that Li Yang is a "nationalist huckster" and that his methods do not actually improve English-speaking ability,&lt;ref name=NYer/&gt; receive a much more subtle presentation in Zhang's film.

The film follows Li on his tours throughout China with a few interspersed interviews. Zhang Yuan has described the film as a combination of [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'' and [[Robert Zemeckis]]' ''[[Forrest Gump]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, Michael (2005). "Wording up a Sweat in a Celluloid Sauna" in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=a5oy2HlLth8C Speaking in Images: Interviews with Contemporary Chinese Filmmakers]''. Columbia University Press, p. 144. {{ISBN|0-231-13331-6}}. Google Book Search. Retrieved 2008-08-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production history ==
The seeds for ''Crazy English'' first arose when Li Yang's manager asked to meet with Zhang Yuan at a bar in Beijing's [[Sanlitun]] neighborhood. At the time Zhang Yuan had not even heard of Li Yang or his "Crazy English" programs.&lt;ref name=B152&gt;Berry, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; After meeting with the manager, Zhang was sufficiently intrigued by the idea of a documentary about Li to arrange for an actual meeting with the motivational speaker.&lt;ref name=B152/&gt;

Once the two men met, Zhang Yuan "immediately" decided to make the film.&lt;ref name=B152/&gt; Though made with the assent of official authorities, the filmmakers were nevertheless forced to make certain cuts&lt;ref&gt;Tasker, Yvonne (2002). "Zhang Yuan" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=xjQ7ifqiIksC ''Fifty Contemporary Filmmakers'']. Routledge Publishing, p. 427. {{ISBN|0-415-18974-8}}. Google Book Search. Retrieved 2008-08-30.&lt;/ref&gt; before being allowed a limited release for their documentary.&lt;ref name="B153"/&gt; Zhang has noted that his own opinions of Li Yang vary dramatically from admiration to disgust.&lt;ref name=B152/&gt; One critic also noticed Zhang's ambivalence in the film and noted that the film seems to shift from appreciation or amusement at Li Yang's methodologies to one darker in tone, as Li Yang's mass rallies begin to resemble Mao-era [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guard]] rallies or even Hitler's [[Nuremberg Rally]].&lt;ref name=B152/&gt;

== Reception ==
Despite of its official approval, ''Crazy English'' received only a limited release in select cities within China.&lt;ref name=B153&gt;Berry, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang Yuan has stated that the film's reception within China was difficult to read, given the mass adoration (and criticism) that Li Yang often elicits.&lt;ref name=B153/&gt;

While China remained ambivalent, the west also responded to ''Crazy English'' with mixed reactions. At least one critic felt that the film was too long and better suited for [[television]] than film.&lt;ref name=Elley/&gt; On the other hand, the film journal ''[[Senses of Cinema]]'' showered praise on ''Crazy English'', saying, "This is a fascinating film - for China watchers, for educators and for fans of the documentary film - and is an absolute must for festival patrons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/festivals/00/8/miff/zhang.html |title=Zhang Yuan's Seventeen Years and Crazy English and Thai film Nang Nak |publisher=''[[Senses of Cinema]]'' |date=July 2000 |author=Freiberg, Freda |accessdate=2008-08-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080730155548/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/festivals/00/8/miff/zhang.html |archivedate=2008-07-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the film's subject, Li Yang was reportedly less than pleased by the film's portrayal of him as a demagogue, and he has gone on to say that the film was "not a real documentary" accusing Zhang of manipulating the film to appeal to Western audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/NM-e/83370.htm|title=Li Yang a Crazy Talker |publisher=''[[City Weekend]]''| accessdate=2008-08-30|date=2003-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the term used for the court or [[Levee (ceremony)|levee]] of the prince; an audience chamber&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=70SHv0axVTwC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;lpg=PA305&amp;dq=darbar+meaning+in+details&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_sbS78GiK5&amp;sig=biSOgEcPU31xi3JEd330ihqKHR4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZ6cnE3dzVAhWBXRQKHUa5BS04ChDoAQhaMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=darbar%20meaning%20in%20details&amp;f=false Islam and politics in Afghanstan]&lt;/ref&gt; or a place where Muslim Kings and other rulers had their formal and informal meetings, i.e. in European context, equivalent to a king's court.

Darbar is a Persian-derived term (from Persian: دربار - darbār) meaning the court or place of discussion of king, Prince, ruler or noble court. It was later used in [[Pakistan]], India and [[Nepal]] for a ruler's court or feudal levee as the latter came to be ruled and later administered by foreigners. A darbar may be either a [[feudal]] state council for administering the affairs of a princely state, or a [[Muslim]] [[shrine]] like [[Data Darbar|data darbar]] in [[Lahore]].

'''De-categorialization''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#-ise.2C_-ize_.28-isation.2C_-ization.29|or]] '''de-categorialisation''') in [[linguistics]], refers to one of the five principles by which [[grammaticalization]] can be detected while it is taking place (according to [[Paul Hopper]]). The other four are [[Layering (linguistics)|layering]], [[Divergence (linguistics)|divergence]], [[specialization (linguistics)|specialization]], and [[persistence (linguistics)|persistence]].

De-categorialization can be described as the loss of [[morphosyntactic]] properties.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2400">In [[linguistics]] and in particular in [[natural language understanding]], a '''dialog act''' is an utterance, in the context of a conversational dialog, that serves a function in the dialog. Types of dialog acts include a question, a statement, or a request for action.&lt;ref name="McTear2016"&gt;{{cite book |last1=McTear |first1=Michael |last2=Callejas |first2=Zoraida |last3=Griol |first3=David |title=The Conversational Interface: Talking to Smart Devices |date=2016 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783319329673 |pages=162-166 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X_w0DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA164&amp;dq=%22Dialog+act%22+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi8kqaEirHbAhVxFjQIHUPADJ0Q6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Dialog%20act%22%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false |accessdate=31 May 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dialog acts are a type of  [[speech act]]. 

Dialog act recognition, also known as spoken utterance classification, is an important part of spoken language understanding. AI inference models or statistical models are used to recognize and classify dialog acts.&lt;ref name="McTear2016" /&gt;

A [[dialog system]] typically includes a taxonomy of dialog types or ''tags'' that classify the different functions dialog acts can play.  One study had 42 types of dialog act in their taxonomy.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Dictation''' is the transcription of spoken text: one person who is "dictating" speaks and another who is "taking dictation" writes down the words as they are spoken. Among speakers of several languages, dictation is used as a test of [[language skill]], similar to [[spelling bee]]s in the English-speaking world. Secondary to teaching language skills, the exercise of dictation has also been used to introduce students to literary works, and to instill morals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldrich|first1=Leon W.|last2=Jones|first2=Olivia Mary|title=School Work|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W8EBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA62|year=1904|publisher=Editors of School Work|pages=62–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The first known written use of the word was in 1581. It derives from Latin, ''dictare'' (to assert).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dictated?show=0&amp;t=1341690020|title=Dictaphone|publisher= Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==

The exercise requires at least two persons: a reciter and a recorder. The reciter reads a selected text, evenly and clearly and at audible volume, by snippets of multiple words (three to ten or as need be). The text is transcribed by the recorders, as the reciter proceeds. Each snippet is read by the reciter at first slowly, then repeated once or twice at a normal pace. Once the selection has been read to the end in this way, the reciter reads the text once again from start to finish at a normal pace.  The recorders then have time to re-read their work, and edit where necessary. The exercise in [[Bloom's taxonomy#Cognitive|knowledge, comprehension and application]] comes to a close.

The [[Bloom's taxonomy|analysis and evaluation]] step now proceeds as follows, upon the revelation of the selected text. The process requires a red pen, and can be varied according to the maturity of the recorders, or as to taste:
* the reciter gathers the written work of the recorders and evaluates it;
* the recorders are given the selection and expected to grade themselves.
The latter auto-evaluation process is quicker, but is sometimes trickier for two reasons: one, the handwriting of the recorder is indistinguishable from that of the evaluator; and two, the severity of the evaluator may be in question as the same person (or class of persons) is employed.

The selected texts are often taken from a sentence, a paragraph or a page of a published book, and may include an homily in morals, honesty or nobility.  Biblical passages or pages from the [[La Fontaine's Fables|''Fables'' of La Fontaine]] have been employed with success throughout the ages.

==Dictation in different languages==

===French===

For speakers of [[French language|French]], ''la dictée'' is a school exercise that aims at testing the mastery of [[orthography]] and [[grammar]]. Since many features of [[French grammar]] are distinguished in writing but not in speech, this can be a challenging task.

Some ''dictées'' became famous for their difficulty or their interest, like those of [[Prosper Mérimée]] and [[Bernard Pivot]]. In several countries of the world (including [[Switzerland]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Poland]], and [[Canada]]), the dictations are the subject of structured championships, similar to English [[spelling bee]]s.

===Korean===

In [[South Korea]], ''badasseugi'' ([[Hangul]]: 받아쓰기) is a school exercise for children in the lower grades of [[Primary education|elementary school]]s. The [[Korean language]] is written using [[hangul]], which is basically a [[Phoneme|phonemic]] alphabet; however, Hangul writing is also [[morphophonemic]], so [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] knowledge (in addition to familiarity with hangul) is necessary for correct dictation. Also, [[Phonology|phonological]] rules such as [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]], [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]], and deletion can cause pronunciation to be different from what the written form may suggest. ''Badasseugi'' may take form of a word, a phrase, or a sentence, and is similar to spelling tests.

===Chinese===

Dictation in Chinese ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 听写 [[Pinyin]]: ''tīng xiě'', literally means 'listen and write') is a vital part of Chinese primary school education curriculum.  [[Chinese characters]] are unique because a single syllable can have different corresponding characters.  Since Chinese dictation is usually done in phrases (i.e. words are made up of more than one characters), this can help the person taking dictation to determine the proper character through phrases. Dictation also increases students' ability to write characters properly.

'''Elective mutism''' is a now outdated term which was defined as a refusal to speak in almost all social situations (despite normal ability to do so), while [[selective mutism]] was considered to be a ''failure'' to speak in specific situations and is strongly associated with [[social anxiety disorder]].  In contrast to selective mutism, it was thought someone who was electively mute may not speak in any situation, as is usually shown in books and movies.  Elective mutism was often attributed to defiance or the effect of [[Psychological trauma|trauma]]. Those who are able to speak freely in some situations but not in others are now better described by [[selective mutism]]&lt;ref&gt;Selective Mutism Resource Manual, Second Edition, Routledge, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
In 1877, a German physician named the disorder ''aphasia voluntaria'' to describe children who were able to speak normally but often "refused" to.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brighttots.com/Selective_Mutism.html Bright Tots: Selective Mutism&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, a study by [[Torey Hayden]] identified four "subtypes" of Elective Mutism:&lt;ref&gt;Torey Hayden. [http://www.torey-hayden.com/research/classification-of-elective-mutism.pdf Classification of elective mutism]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Symbiotic mutism: the most common form, caused by a vocal and dominating mother and absent father (very rarely the other way around) and characterized by the use of mutism as controlling behavior around other adults.
*Speech phobic mutism: the least common, in which the child showed distinct fear at hearing a recording of his or her voice.  This also involved ritualistic behaviors, which may reflect OCD, and was thought to be caused by the child having been told to keep a family secret.
*Reactive mutism: a reaction to trauma and/or abuse, with all children showing symptoms of depression and being notably withdrawn, usually showing no facial expressions.  Notably, Hayden admits that some children put in this category had no apparent incident to react to, but they were included because of their symptoms.
*Passive-aggressive mutism: silence is used as a display of hostility, connected to antisocial behavior.  Some of the children in her study had reportedly not been mute until age 9-12.

The ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM), first published in 1952, first included Elective Mutism in its third edition, published in 1980.  Elective mutism was described as "a continuous refusal to speak in almost all social situations" despite normal ability to speak.  While "excessive shyness" and other anxiety-related traits were listed as associated features, predisposing factors included "maternal overprotection", mental retardation, and trauma.  Elective mutism in the third edition revised (DSM III-R) is described similarly as in the third edition except for specifying that the disorder is ''not'' related to social anxiety disorder.

In 1994, the fourth edition of the DSM reflected the name change to selective mutism and redefined the disorder.

==Cultural references==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2012}}
Though elective mutism is no longer recognized by most psychiatrists, it is a popular character element or plot point in stories and movies.  Many characters choose to stop speaking, for various reasons.  Even more commonly, there are also characters who stop speaking after a traumatic incident.  In both these cases, often, and almost always in the second, the character is silent in all situations.  This is therefore not selective mutism, and anxiety is very rarely involved. Selective mutism itself is almost nonexistent in pop culture.

The following are a few references to stories including a character who does not speak despite being physically able to.

* In the book ''[[Cut (novel)|Cut]]'' by Patricia McCormick, the main character, Callie, is an elective mute.
* In ''[[The House of the Spirits]]'' by [[Isabel Allende]], Clara Trueba is mute after witnessing her sisters molestation and autopsy. "She could not move until the first lights of dawn appeared. Only then did she slip back into her bed, feeling within her the silence of the entire world. Silence filled her utterly."
*In ''[[Hannibal Rising]]'' by [[Thomas Harris]], [[Hannibal Lecter]] is mute after witnessing his sister killed and eaten.
* In the book ''[[Flying Solo (Fletcher novel)|Flying Solo]]'', the character Rachel is mute for six months after a classmate dies.
* In ''[[The Piano (film)|The Piano]]'', Ada is an elective mute. She chooses to learn to speak at the end of the film.
* In the 1993 movie, ''[[House of Cards (1993 film)|House of Cards]]'', Sally Matthews chooses not to speak after her father dies.
* In the book ''[[Halo: Ghosts of Onyx]]'', Lucy-B091 is mute after she is one of only two survivors from her unit of 300.
* In the movie ''[[The Prophet (2014 film)|The Prophet]]'' Kamila's daughter, Elmitra, is depicted as mute after the death of her father.
* In the 2014 video game ''[[Watch Dogs]]'', Aiden Pearce's nephew, Jackson, is electively mute after the death of his sister.
* In the book ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]'', Christian Grey is depicted as having been an elective mute from age 4, when he witnessed his birth mother's drug overdose and death and was with her body for days before being discovered, until he was 6 years old and he spoke his newly-adopted baby sister's name.
*In [[John Green (author)|John Green]]'s narrative YouTube series Swindon Town Swoodilypoopers, midfielder Maric Maric is selectively mute.

The '''Eskimo–Uralic''' hypothesis posits that the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] and [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo–Aleut]] language families belong to a common [[language family]] of which they are the two branches. Although substantial arguments for the hypothesis have been made, it is not generally accepted by [[linguist]]s. The best-known advocate of the Eskimo–Uralic hypothesis is [[Knut Bergsland]]. The hypothesis dates back to the pioneering Danish linguist [[Rasmus Rask]] in 1818, upon noticing similarities between [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic Eskimo]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]].

An '''experimental language''' is a [[constructed language]] designed for [[linguistics]] research, often on the relationship between [[language and thought]].

One particular assumption having received much attention in fiction is popularly known as the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]].  The claim is that the structure of a language somehow affects the way its speakers perceive their world, either strongly, in which case "language determines thought" ([[linguistic determinism]]), or weakly, in which case "language influences thought" ([[linguistic relativity]]). (For a list of languages that are merely mentioned, see the relevant section in [[List of constructed languages]].)

The extreme case of the strong version of the hypothesis would be the idea that words have a power inherent to themselves such that their use determines not just our thoughts, but even that which our thoughts are about, i.e. reality itself. This idea, however, is more properly treated within [[ontology]] than linguistics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Languages exploring the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis==

===Constructed languages===
* [[Láadan]] was designed by [[linguistics|linguist]] [[Suzette Haden Elgin]] in her science fiction novel [[Native Tongue (Suzette Haden Elgin novel)|''Native Tongue'']]'','' about a patriarchal society in which the overriding priority of the oppressed women is the secret development of a "feminist" language, Láadan, to aid them in throwing off their shackles.
* [[Loglan]], by [[James Cooke Brown]], was designed for linguistic research with the specific goal of making a language so different from natural languages that people learning it would think in a different way if the hypothesis were true. 
* [[Lojban]] is the successor of Loglan and has the same goals.
* [[Toki Pona]], by [[Sonja Elen Kisa]], is inspired by [[Taoist]] philosophy, among other things, and designed to shape the thought processes of its users in Zen-like fashion.

===Fictional languages===

====Named====
* ''[[Babel-17]]'', by [[Samuel R. Delany]], is centered on a fictional language that denies its speakers independent thought, forcing them to think purely logical thoughts. This language is used as a weapon of war, because it is supposed to convert everyone who learns it to a traitor. In the novel, the language Babel-17 is likened to computer programming languages that do not allow errors or imprecise statements.
* [[The Culture#Language|Marain]], in [[Iain M. Banks]]'s [[Culture series]]. The Culture believes (or perhaps has proved, or else actively made true) the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis that language affects society, and Marain was designed to exploit this effect. A related comment is made by the narrator in ''[[The Player of Games]]'' regarding gender-specific pronouns in English. Marain is also regarded as an aesthetically pleasing language.
* [[Newspeak]], by [[George Orwell]] in his dystopian novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', does not have any of the words expressing the ideas underlying a revolution with the idea that its speakers cannot revolt. All of the theory of Newspeak is aimed at eliminating such words. For example, ''bad'' has been replaced by ''ungood'', and the concept of "freedom" has been eliminated over time. According to the appendix on Newspeak, the result of the adoption of the language would be that "a heretical thought ... should be literally unthinkable, at least so far as thought is dependent on words."
* [[Pravic]] is one of the languages used in ''[[The Dispossessed]]'', by [[Ursula K. Le Guin]], that takes place partly on a world with an anarcho-communist society. Pravic contains little means for expressing possessive relationships, among other features.
* Tamarian, in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode "[[Darmok]]", is unintelligible to Starfleet's universal translators because it is too deeply rooted in local metaphor and consequently its sentences have no meaning to other civilizations.

====Unnamed====
* In ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]'', by [[Ayn Rand]], the World Council attempted to enforce collectivist thinking among the populace by removing from the language all words expressing individuality.
* In ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', by [[Frank Herbert]], [[Lady Jessica]] (who has extensive linguistic training) encounters the [[Fremen]], the native people of Dune. She is shocked by the violence of their language, as she believes their word choices and language structure reflect a culture of enormous violence. Similarly, earlier in the novel, her late husband, Duke Leto, muses on how the nature of Imperial society is betrayed by "the precise delineations for treacherous death" in its language, the use of highly specific terms to describe different methods for delivering poison.
* In [[Gulf (Heinlein)|''Gulf'']], by [[Robert A. Heinlein]], the characters are taught an artificial language which allows them to think logically and concisely by removing the "false to fact" linguistic constructs of existing languages.
* ''[[The Languages of Pao]]'', by [[Jack Vance]], centers on an experiment in modeling a civilization by tweaking its language. The mastermind behind this experiment, Lord Palafox, says in chapter 9: "We must alter the mental framework of the Paonese people, which is most easily achieved by altering the language." His son, Finisterle, says in chapter 11 to a class of linguists in training: "every language impresses a certain world-view upon the mind."
* In ''Mud/Aurora'', by [[D.D. Storm]], society is divided in three classes speaking three different languages, designed to allow survival on a hostile, deserted world of a wrecked starship's crew and their descendants. The long-forgotten ship's linguist hid the true history of their world within the language spoken by the descendants of the commanding officers, the Sah.
* ''[[Snow Crash]]'', by [[Neal Stephenson]], explores the (controversial) concept of [[neuro-linguistic programming]] and presents the [[Sumerian language]] as the [[firmware]] programming language for the [[brain stem]] which is supposedly functioning as the [[BIOS]] for the human brain. According to characters in the book, the goddess [[Asherah]] is the personification of a linguistic virus similar to a computer virus. The god [[Enki]] created a counter program which he called a [[nam-shub]] that caused all of humanity to speak different languages as a protection against Asherah, supposedly giving rise to the biblical story of the [[Tower of Babel]].
* In ''[[Story of Your Life]]'', by [[Ted Chiang]], learning the written language used by alien visitors to the Earth allows the person who learns the language to think in a different way, in which the past and future are illusions of conventional thought. This allows people who understand the language to see their entire life as a single unchangeable action, from past to future.
* In ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'', by [[Robert A. Heinlein]], Valentine Michael Smith is able to do things that most other humans cannot, and is unable to explain any of this in English. However, once others learn Martian, they start to develop the ability to do these things; those concepts could be explained only in Martian.
* ''[[The Unnamable (short story)|The Unnamable]]'', by [[H.P. Lovecraft]], explores the idea of whether or not someone can conceptualize something which cannot be described by any name.
* In ''[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]'', by [[Jorge Luis Borges]], the author discovers references in books to a universe of idealistic individuals whose languages have peculiarities that shape their idealism. For example, one of the language families lacks nouns, while another primarily uses monosyllabic adjectives to describe objects. As the story progresses the books become more and better known to the world at large, their philosophy starts influencing the real world, and Earth becomes the ideal world described in the books.

====Counterexamples====
* In ''[[The Citadel of the Autarch]]'', by [[Gene Wolfe]], one of the characters (an Ascian) speaks entirely in slogans, but is able to express deep and subtle meanings via context. The narrator, Severian, after hearing the Ascian speak, remarks that "The Ascian seemed to speak only in sentences he had learned by rote, though until he used each for the first time we had never heard them ... Second, I learned how difficult it is to eliminate the urge for expression. The people of Ascia were reduced to speaking only with their masters' voice; but they had made of it a new tongue, and I had no doubt, after hearing the Ascian, that by it he could express whatever thought he wished."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wolfe |first=Gene |year=1998 |title=The book of the new sun |publisher=SFBC |location=New York |page=776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ana Dili.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|The monument for the ''mother tongue'' ("Ana dili") in [[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhchivan]], [[Azerbaijan]]]]
A '''first language''', '''native language''', or '''mother/father/parent tongue''' (also known as '''arterial language''' or '''L1''') is a [[language]] that a person has been exposed to from birth&lt;ref&gt;Bloomfield, Leonard. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gfrd-On5iFwC&amp;dq Language] {{ISBN|81-208-1196-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; or within the [[critical period hypothesis|critical period]]. In some countries, the term ''native language'' or ''mother tongue'' refers to the language of one's ethnic group rather than one's first language.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JeTwQB5doD4C&amp;dq/  "K*The Native Speaker: Myth and Reality By Alan Davies] {{ISBN|1-85359-622-1}} {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children brought up speaking more than one language can have more than one native language, and be [[Simultaneous bilingualism|bilingual]] or [[multilingual]]. By contrast, a ''[[second language]]'' is any language that one speaks other than one's first language.

==Terminology==
[[File:Kituwah Academy.png|thumb|right|A lesson at Kituwah Academy on the [[Qualla Boundary]] in [[North Carolina]]. The [[language immersion]] school, operated by the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]], teaches the same curriculum as other [[United States|American]] [[primary schools]], but [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]] is the medium of instruction from [[preschool]] onward, and students learn it as a first language. Such schools have proven instrumental in the preservation and perpetuation of Cherokee.]]
One of the more widely accepted definitions of native speakers is that they were born in a particular country raised to speak the language of that country during the critical period of their development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipedr.com/vol26/16-ICLLL%202011-L00033.pdf|title=Who Is An Ideal Native Speaker?! Andisheh Saniei, English Language Department, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran|website=ipedr.com|accessdate=1 February 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202012310/http://www.ipedr.com/vol26/16-ICLLL%202011-L00033.pdf|archivedate=2 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The person qualifies as a "native speaker" of a language by being born and immersed in the language during youth, in a family in which the adults shared a similar language experience as the child.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Love, Nigel, and Umberto Ansaldo. "The Native Speaker and the Mother Tongue." Language Sciences 32.6 (2010): 589-93. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Native speakers are considered to be an authority on their given language because of their natural acquisition process regarding the language, as opposed to having learned the language later in life. That is achieved by personal interaction with the language and speakers of the language. Native speakers will not necessarily be knowledgeable about every grammatical rule of the language, but they will have good "intuition" of the rules through their experience with the language.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Sometimes, the term "'''mother tongue'''" or "'''mother language'''" is used for the language that a person learned as a child at home (usually from their parents). Children growing up in bilingual homes can, according to this definition, have more than one mother tongue or native language.

In the context of population censuses conducted on the Canadian population, [[Statistics Canada]] defines ''mother tongue'' as "the first language learned at home in childhood and still understood by the individual at the time of the census."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/Products/Reference/dict/pop082.htm |title=mother tongue |work=2001 census |accessdate=25 August 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916172728/http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/Products/Reference/dict/pop082.htm |archivedate=16 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }} {{Unreliable source?|date=August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is quite possible that the first language learned is no longer a speaker's dominant language. That includes young immigrant children whose families have moved to a new linguistic environment as well as people who learned their mother tongue as a young child at home (rather than the language of the majority of the community), who may have lost, in part or in totality, the language they first [[language acquisition|acquired]] (see [[language attrition]]).

===Mother tongue===
[[File:Int-mother-lang-day-monument.jpg|thumb|right|International Mother Language Day Monument in Sydney, Australia, unveiling ceremony, 19 February 2006]]
According to [[Ivan Illich]], the term "mother tongue" was first used by [[Catholic]] monks to designate a particular language they used, instead of [[Latin]], when they are "speaking from the pulpit". That is, the "holy mother the Church" introduced this term and colonies inherited it from Christianity as a part of colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;[Ivan Illich] in Patttanayak, 1981:24 cited in [https://www.academia.edu/411071/_M_Other_Tongue_Syndrome_From_Breast_To_Bottle._ "(M)other Tongue Syndrome: From Breast to Bottle"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830045733/http://www.academia.edu/411071/_M_Other_Tongue_Syndrome_From_Breast_To_Bottle._ |date=30 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Illich, [http://www.preservenet.com/theory/Illich/Vernacular.html "Vernacular Values"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160720033517/http://www.preservenet.com/theory/Illich/Vernacular.html |date=20 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, such as [[Kenya]], [[India]], and various East Asian countries, "mother language" or "native language" is used to indicate the language of one's [[ethnic group]] in both common and journalistic parlance ("I have no apologies for not learning my mother tongue"), rather than one's first language. Also, in [[Singapore]], "mother tongue" refers to the language of one's [[ethnic group]] regardless of actual proficiency, and the "first language" refers to English, which was established on the island under the [[British Empire]], which is the [[lingua franca]] for most post-independence Singaporeans because of its use as the language of instruction in government schools and as a working language.

[[J. R. R. Tolkien]], in his 1955 lecture "[[English and Welsh]]," distinguishes the "native tongue" from the "cradle tongue." The latter is the language one happens to learn during early childhood, and one's true "native tongue" may be different, possibly determined by an [[genetic memory (biology)|inherited linguistic taste]] and may later in life be discovered by a strong emotional affinity to a specific dialect (Tolkien personally confessed to such an affinity to the [[Middle English]] of the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] in particular).

On 17 November 1999, UNESCO designated 21 February as [[International Mother Language Day]].

==Significance==
The first language of a child is part of the personal, social and cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bisnet.or.id/vle/mod/resource/view.php?id=1663|title=Terri Hirst: The Importance of Maintaining a Childs First Language|author=|date=|website=bisnet.or.id|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312012655/http://bisnet.or.id/vle/mod/resource/view.php?id=1663|archivedate=12 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another impact of the first language is that it brings about the reflection and learning of successful social patterns of acting and speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-psych.stanford.edu/~lera/papers/mandarin.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510152648/http://www-psych.stanford.edu/~lera/papers/mandarin.pdf |archivedate=10 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is basically responsible for differentiating the linguistic competence of acting. While some argue that there is no such thing as "native speaker" or a "mother tongue," it is important to understand the key terms as well as understand what it means to be a "non-native" speaker and the implications that can have on one's life. Research suggest that while a non-native speaker may develop fluency in a targeted language after about two years of immersion, it can actually take between five and seven years for that child to be on the same working level as their native speaking counterparts. That has implications on the education of non-native speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Second Language Acquisition Essential Information: Professor J. Cumminshttp://esl.fis.edu/teachers/support/cummin.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The topic of native speaker also gives way to discussion about what exactly bilingualism is. One definition is that a person is bilingual by being equally proficient in both languages. A person who grows up speaking English and begins learning Spanish for four years is not necessarily bilingual unless they speak the two languages with equal fluency. Pearl and Lambert were the first to test only “balanced” bilinguals—that is, a child who is completely fluent in two languages and feel that neither is their “native” language because they grasp the two so perfectly. This study found the following: balanced bilinguals perform significantly better in tasks that require flexibility (they constantly shift between the two known languages depending on the situation/requires constant juggling), more aware of arbitrary nature of language and also that balanced bilinguals choose word associations based on logical rather than phonetic preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alsintl.com/blog/language-proficiency/ |title=Language Proficiency: Defining Levels Avoids Confusion |publisher=Alsintl.com |date=2013-08-26 |accessdate=2013-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917082347/http://www.alsintl.com/blog/language-proficiency |archivedate=17 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/khakuta/research/publications/(1985)%20-%20THE%20RELATIONSHIP%20BETWEEN%20DEGREE%20OF%20BILINGUALISM%20AND.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024165613/http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/khakuta/research/publications/(1985)%20-%20THE%20RELATIONSHIP%20BETWEEN%20DEGREE%20OF%20BILINGUALISM%20AND.pdf |archivedate=24 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multilingualism==
One can have two or more native languages, thus being a native ''bilingual'' or indeed ''[[Multilingualism|multilingual]]''. The order in which these languages are learned is not necessarily the order of proficiency. For instance, if a French-speaking couple have a child who learned French first but then the child grew up in an English-speaking country, the child would likely be most proficient in English. Other examples are in [[India]], [[Languages of Indonesia|Indonesia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Kenya]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], and [[Languages of South Africa|South Africa]], where most people speak more than one language.

The designation "native language," in its general usage, is thought to be imprecise and subject to various interpretations that are biased linguistically, especially with respect to bilingual children from ethnic minority groups. Many scholars{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} have given definitions of 'native language' based on common usage, the emotional relation of the speaker towards the language, and even its dominance in relation to the environment. However, all of three criteria lack precision. For many children whose home language differs from the language of the environment (the 'official' language), it is debatable which language is one's 'native language'. 

===Defining "native language"{{anchor|Defining native language}}===
*Based on origin: the language(s) one learned first (the language(s) in which one has established the first long-lasting verbal contacts).
*Based on internal identification: the language(s) one identifies with/as a speaker of;
*Based on external identification: the language(s) one is identified with/as a speaker of, by others.
*Based on competence: the language(s) one knows best.
*Based on function: the language(s) one uses most.

===Defining "native speaker"===
The article titled “The Native Speaker: An Achievable Model?” published by the Asian EFL Journal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Joseph|title=The Native Speaker: An Achievable Model?|journal=Asian EFL Journal|volume=7|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that there are six general principles that relate to the definition of "native speaker". The principles, according to the study, are typically accepted by language experts across the scientific field. A native speaker is defined according to the guidelines as this:

#The individual acquired the language in early childhood.
#The individual has intuitive knowledge of the language.
#The individual is able to produce fluent, spontaneous discourse.
#The individual is competent in communication.
#The individual identifies with or is identified by a language community.
#The individual has a dialect accent (including the official dialect).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3621">'''Foregrounding''' is the practice of making something stand out from the surrounding words or images.&lt;ref&gt;Leech, G. and Short, M. (2007) ''Style in Fiction'' (2nd ed.) Pearson Education Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; It is "the 'throwing into relief' of the linguistic sign against the background of the norms of ordinary language."&lt;ref&gt;Wales, K. (2001) ''Dictionary of Stylistics'' (2nd ed.) Pearson Education Ltd. p157&lt;/ref&gt; The term was first associated with Paul Garvin in the 1960s, who used it as a translation of the [[Czech (language)|Czech]] ''aktualisace'' (literally "to actualise"), borrowing the terms from the [[Prague school]] of the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Procházka (2010). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=c9a9nhXQUKEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=The%20Prague%20School%20and%20Theories%20of%20Structure&amp;hl=es&amp;pg=PA196#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Prague School and Theories of Structure]'' p.196 footnote 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two main types of foregrounding: [[parallelism (grammar)|parallelism]] and deviation. Parallelism can be described as unexpected regularity, while deviation can be seen as unexpected irregularity.&lt;ref&gt;Leech, G. (1969) ''A Linguistic Guide to English Poetry''. Longman&lt;/ref&gt; As the definition of foregrounding indicates, these are relative concepts. Something can only be unexpectedly regular or irregular within a particular context. This context can be relatively narrow, such as the immediate textual surroundings (referred to as a 'secondary norm'&lt;ref&gt;Leech, G. and Short, M. (2007) ''Style in Fiction'' (2nd ed.) Pearson Education Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;) or wider such as an entire genre (referred to as a 'primary norm'&lt;ref&gt;Leech, G. and Short, M. (2007) ''Style in Fiction'' (2nd ed.) Pearson Education Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;).

For example, the last line of a poem with a consistent metre may be foregrounded by changing the number of syllables it contains. This would be an example of a deviation from a secondary norm. In the following poem by [[E. E. Cummings]],&lt;ref&gt;as quoted in Wales, K. (2001) ''Dictionary of Stylistics'' (2nd ed.) Pearson Education Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; there are two types of deviation:

:light’s lives lurch

:a once world quickly from rises

:army the gradual of unbeing fro{{Clarify|date=June 2016}}

:on stiffening greenly air and to ghosts go

:drift slippery hands tease slim float twitter faces

:Only stand with me, love! against these its

:until you are, and until i am dreams...

Firstly, most of the poem deviates from 'normal' language (primary deviation). In addition, there is secondary deviation in that the penultimate line is unexpectedly different from the rest of the poem. [[Nursery rhyme]]s, adverts and [[slogan]]s often exhibit parallelism in the form of repetition and [[rhyme]], but parallelism can also occur over longer texts. For example, jokes are often built on a mixture of parallelism and deviation. They often consist of three parts or characters. The first two are very similar (parallelism) and the third one starts out as similar, but our expectations are thwarted when it turns out different in end (deviation).

Foregrounding can occur on all levels of language&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, p (2004) "Stylistics, A Resource Book". London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; ([[phonology]], [[graphology]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[lexis (linguistics)|lexis]], [[syntax]], [[semantics]] and [[pragmatics]]). It is generally used to highlight important parts of a text, to aid memorability and/or to invite interpretation.

'''Indeterminacy''', in [[philosophy]], can refer both to common scientific and mathematical concepts of [[uncertainty]] and their implications and to another kind of indeterminacy deriving from the nature of [[definition]] or meaning. It is related to [[deconstructionism]] and to [[Nietzsche]]'s criticism of the Kantian [[noumenon]].

==Indeterminacy in philosophy==
===Introduction===

The problem of indeterminacy arises when one observes the eventual circularity of virtually every possible definition. It is easy to find loops of definition in any dictionary, because this seems to be the only way that certain concepts, and generally very important ones such as that of [[existence]], can be defined in the English language. A definition is a collection of other words, and in any finite dictionary if one continues to follow the trail of words in search of the precise meaning of any given term, one will inevitably encounter this linguistic indeterminacy.

Philosophers and scientists generally try to eliminate indeterminate terms from their arguments, since any indeterminate thing is unquantifiable and untestable; similarly, any hypothesis which consists of a statement of the properties of something unquantifiable or indefinable cannot be falsified and thus cannot be said to be supported by evidence that does not falsify it. This is related to [[Karl Popper|Popper]]'s discussions of falsifiability in his works on the [[scientific method]]. The [[quantifiability]] of data collected during an experiment is central to the scientific method, since reliable conclusions can only be drawn from replicable experiments, and since in order to establish observer agreement scientists must be able to quantify experimental evidence.

===Kant and hazards of positing the "thing in itself"===

[[Immanuel Kant]] unwittingly proposed one answer to this question in his [[Critique of Pure Reason]] by stating that there must "exist" a "[[thing in itself]]"&amp;nbsp;– a thing which is the cause of phenomena, but not a [[phenomenon]] itself. But, so to speak, "approximations" of "things in themselves" crop up in many models of empirical phenomena. Singularities in physics, such as [[gravitational singularities]], ''certain aspects of which'' (e.g., their unquantifiability){{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} can seem ''almost'' to mirror various "aspects" of the proposed "thing in itself", are generally eliminated (or attempts are made at eliminating them) in newer, more precise models of the universe. Definitions of various [[psychiatric disorders]] stem, according to philosophers who draw on the work of [[Michel Foucault]], from a belief that something unobservable and indescribable is fundamentally "wrong" with the mind of whoever suffers from such a disorder. Proponents of Foucault's treatment of the concept of insanity would assert that one need only try to quantify various characteristics of such disorders as presented in today's [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]] (e.g., [[delusion]], one of the diagnostic criteria which must be exhibited by a patient if he or she is to be considered [[schizophrenic]]) in order to discover that the field of study known as [[abnormal psychology]] relies upon indeterminate concepts in defining virtually each "mental disorder" it describes. The quality that makes a belief a delusion is indeterminate to the extent to which it is unquantifiable; arguments that delusion is determined by popular sentiment (i.e., "almost no-one believes that he or she is made of cheese, and thus that belief is a delusion") would lead to the conclusion that, for example, [[Alfred Wegener|Alfred Wegener's]] assertion of [[continental drift]] was a delusion since it was dismissed for decades after it was made.

===Nietzsche and the indeterminacy of the "thing in itself"===

{{See also|Nietzsche and free will|Eternal return}}
Relevant criticism of Kant's original formulation of the "thing in itself" can be found in the works of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche]], who argued against what he held to be the indeterminate nature of such concepts as the Platonic idea, the subject, the Kantian noumenon, the opposition of "appearance" to "reality", etc. Nietzsche concisely argued against Kant's [[noumenon]] in his ''On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense'' as follows:

: "The 'thing in itself' (which is precisely what the pure truth, apart from any of its consequences, would be) is likewise something quite incomprehensible to the creator of language and something not in the least worth striving for."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicappeal.org/library/nietzsche/Nietzsche_various/on_truth_and_lies.htm Nietzsche, F., ''On Truth and Lies'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Beyond Good and Evil'', Nietzsche argues against the "misleading significance of words" and its production of a "thing in itself":

: "I would repeat it, however, a hundred times, that 'immediate certainty,' as well as 'absolute knowledge' and the 'thing in itself,' involve a CONTRADICTIO IN ADJECTO; we really ought to free ourselves from the misleading significance of words!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/nietzsche/1886/beyond-good-evil/ch01.htm Nietzsche, F. ''Beyond Good and Evil'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Nietzsche argued against such singularities as the atom in the scientific models of his day in ''The Will to Power'':

: "For all its detachment and freedom from emotion, our science is still the dupe of linguistic habits; it has never got rid of those changelings called 'subjects.' The atom is one such changeling, another is the Kantian 'thing-in-itself.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wutsamada.com/alma/modern/nietzquo.htm Nietzsche quotes]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Approximation versus equality===

The concept of something that is unapproachable but always further-approximable has led to a rejection by philosophers like [[Nietzsche]] of the concept of exact equality in general in favor of that of approximate similarity:

: "Every word instantly becomes a concept precisely insofar as it is not supposed to serve as a reminder of the unique and entirely individual original experience to which it owes its origin; but rather, a word becomes a concept insofar as it simultaneously has to fit countless more or less similar cases&amp;nbsp;– which means, purely and simply, cases which are never equal and thus altogether unequal."&lt;ref name="Nietzsche quote"&gt;[[q:Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche quote]]&lt;/ref&gt;

: "What then is truth? A movable host of metaphors, metonymies, and; anthropomorphisms: in short, a sum of human relations which have been poetically and rhetorically intensified, transferred, and embellished, and which, after long usage, seem to a people to be fixed, canonical, and binding. Truths are illusions which we have forgotten are illusions- they are metaphors that have become worn out and have been drained of sensuous force, coins which have lost their embossing and are now considered as metal and no longer as coins."&lt;ref name="Nietzsche quote"/&gt;

If one states an equation between two things, one states, in effect, that they are the same thing. It can be argued that this cannot possibly be true, since one will then consider the properties which the two sides of the equation share&amp;nbsp;– that which makes them "equal"&amp;nbsp;– but one also can, and does, consider them as two separate concepts. Even in a mathematical statement as simple as "x=x", one encounters fundamental differences between the two "x"es under consideration: firstly, that there are two distinct "x"es, in that they neither occupy the same space on this page nor in one's own mind. There would otherwise be only one "x". Secondly, that if two things were absolutely equal in every possible respect, then there would necessarily be no reason to consider their equality. Nothing could lead anyone to consider the possibility or impossibility of their equality if there were no properties ''not'' shared between "them", since there would necessarily be no relationship between them whatsoever. Thirdly, and most importantly, if two things were equal in every possible respect they would necessarily not be two things, but the very same thing, since there would be no difference to separate them.

In examples as odd as this, the differences between two approximately equal things may be very small indeed, and it is certainly true that they are quite irrelevant to most discussions. Acceptance of the reflexive property illustrated above has led to useful mathematical discoveries which have influenced the life of anyone reading this article on a computer. But in an examination of the possibility of the determinacy of any possible concept, differences like this are supremely relevant since that quality which could possibly make two separate things "equal" seems to be indeterminate.

===Indeterminacy of meaning and translation===
See:
* [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]: [[indeterminacy of translation]], [[indeterminacy of reference]]
* [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]: [[indeterminacy of interpretation]]&lt;ref&gt;Malpas, Jeffrey. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/davidson/ "Donald Davidson,"] ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The indeterminacy of the ''pharmakon'' in Derrida's [[Plato's Pharmacy]]===

{{main article|Pharmakon_(philosophy)|l1=Pharmakon (philosophy)}}

Indeterminacy was discussed in one of [[Jacques Derrida|Jacques Derrida's]] early works ''[[Plato's Pharmacy]]'' (1969),&lt;ref&gt;[http://social.chass.ncsu.edu/wyrick/debclass/pharma.htm Derrida, ''Plato's Pharmacy'' in ''Dissemination'', 1972, Athlone Press, London, 1981] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010200631/http://social.chass.ncsu.edu/wyrick/debclass/pharma.htm |date=2008-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a reading of [[Plato]]'s ''Phaedrus'' and ''Phaedo''.  Plato writes of a fictionalized conversation between [[Socrates]] and a student, in which Socrates tries to convince the student that writing is inferior to speech.&lt;ref&gt;''Phaedrus'' 275c&lt;/ref&gt;  Socrates uses the Egyptian myth of Thoth's creation of writing to illustrate his point.  As the story goes, Thoth presents his invention to the god-king of Upper Egypt for judgment.  Upon its presentation, Thoth offers script as a ''pharmakon'' for the Egyptian people.  The Greek word [[Pharmakon (philosophy)|pharmakon]] poses a quandary for translators: it is both a remedy and a poison.  In the proffering of a pharmakon, Thoth presents it as its true meaning: a harm and benefit.  The god-king, however, refuses the invention. Through various reasonings, he determines the pharmakon of writing to be a bad thing for the Egyptian people.  The pharmakon, the undecidable, has been returned decided.  The problem, as Derrida reasons, is this: since the word pharmakon, in the original Greek, means both a remedy and a poison, it cannot be determined as fully remedy or fully poison. Amon rejected writing as fully poison in Socrates' retelling of the tale, thus shutting out the other possibilities.

===Foucault and the indeterminacy of insanity===

The philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] wrote about the existence of such problems of precise definition in the very concept of [[insanity]] itself&amp;nbsp;– a ''very'' rough approximation of his argument can be found in the late social commentator and journalist [[Hunter S. Thompson]]'s book, ''[[Kingdom of Fear (book)|Kingdom of Fear]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The only difference between the Sane and the Insane, is IN and yet within this world, the Sane have the power to have the Insane locked up."&lt;ref&gt;[[q:Hunter S. Thompson|H. S. Thompson quote]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another summary of Foucault's original argument against the indeterminacy of the concept of insanity in his ''Madness and Civilization'' can be found in the following excerpt from the ''Literature, Arts, and Medicine Database'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Central to this is the notion of confinement as a meaningful exercise. Foucault's history explains how the mad came first to be confined; how they became identified as confined due to moral and economic factors that determined those who ought to be confined; how they became perceived as dangerous through their confinement, partly by way of atavistic identification with the lepers whose place they had come to occupy; how they were 'liberated' by Pinel and Tuke, but in their liberation remained confined, both physically in asylums and in the designation of being mad; and how this confinement subsequently became enacted in the figure of the psychiatrist, whose practice is 'a certain moral tactic contemporary with the end of the eighteenth century, preserved in the rites of the asylum life, and overlaid by the myths of positivism.' Science and medicine, notably, come in at the later stages, as practices 'elaborated once this division' between the mad and the sane has been made (ix)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://mchip00.nyu.edu/lit-med/lit-med-db/webdocs/webdescrips/foucault12432-des-.html Foucault, M. ''Madness and Civilisation''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907234548/http://mchip00.nyu.edu/lit-med/lit-med-db/webdocs/webdescrips/foucault12432-des-.html |date=2006-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''The Archaeology of Knowledge'', Foucault addresses indeterminacy directly by discussing the origin of the meaning of concepts:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Foucault directs his analysis toward the 'statement', the basic unit of discourse that he believes has been ignored up to this point. 'Statement' is the English translation from French énoncé (that which is enunciated or expressed), which has a peculiar meaning for Foucault. 'Énoncé' for Foucault means that which makes propositions, utterances, or speech acts meaningful. In this understanding, statements themselves are not propositions, utterances, or speech acts. Rather, statements create a network of rules establishing what is meaningful, and it is these rules that are the preconditions for propositions, utterances, or speech acts to have meaning. Statements are also 'events'. Depending on whether or not they comply with the rules of meaning, a grammatically correct sentence may still lack meaning and inversely, an incorrect sentence may still be meaningful. Statements depend on the conditions in which they emerge and exist within a field of discourse. It is huge collections of statements, called discursive formations, toward which Foucault aims his analysis.
[...]
Rather than looking for a deeper meaning underneath discourse or looking for the source of meaning in some transcendental subject, Foucault analyzes the conditions of existence for meaning. In order to show the principles of meaning production in various discursive formations he details how truth claims emerge during various epochs on the basis of what was actually said and written during these periods of time."&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Foucault#The_Archaeology_of_Knowledge|Foucault, M. ''The Archaeology of Knowledge'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The difference described by Foucault between the sane and the insane does have observable and very real effects on millions of people daily and can be characterized in terms of those effects, but it can also serve to illustrate a particular effect of the indeterminacy of definition: i.e., that insofar as the general public tends not to characterize or define insanity in very precise terms, it tends, according to Foucault, unnecessarily and arbitrarily to confine some of its members on an irrational basis. The less-precisely such states as "insanity" and "criminality" are defined in a society, the more likely that society is to fail to continue over time to describe the same behaviors as characteristic of those states (or, alternately, to characterize such states in terms of the same behaviors).

===Indeterminacy in discourse analysis===

Steve Hoenisch asserts in his article ''Interpretation and Indeterminacy in [[Discourse Analysis]]'' that "[T]he exact meaning of a speaker's utterance in a contextualized exchange is often indeterminate. Within the context of the analysis of the teacher-pupil exchange, I will argue for the superiority of interactional linguistics over speech act theory because it reduces the indeterminacy and yields a more principled interpretation[...]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.criticism.com/da/da_indet.htm Hoenisch, S. ''Interpretation and Indeterminacy in Discourse Analysis'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indeterminacy and consciousness===

[[Richard Dawkins]], the man who coined the term [[meme]] in the 1970s, described the concept of faith in his documentary, ''Root of All Evil?'', as "the process of non-thinking". In the documentary, he used [[Bertrand Russell]]'s analogy between a teapot orbiting the sun (something that cannot be observed because the brightness of the sun would obscure it even from the best telescope's view) and the object of one's faith (in this particular case, God) to explain that a highly indeterminate idea can self-replicate freely: "Everybody in the society had faith in the teapot. Stories of the teapot had been handed down for generations as part of the tradition of society. There are holy books about the teapot."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/WorldOfDawkins-archive/Dawkins/Work/Articles/1999-10-04snakeoil.shtml Dawkins ''World of Dawkins''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505103001/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/WorldOfDawkins-archive/Dawkins/Work/Articles/1999-10-04snakeoil.shtml |date=2008-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Darwin's Dangerous Idea'', [[Daniel Dennett]] argues against the existence of determinate meaning (in this case, of the subjective experience of vision for frogs) via an explanation of their indeterminacy in the chapter entitled ''The Evolution of Meanings'', in the section ''The Quest for Real Meanings'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Unless there were 'meaningless' or 'indeterminate' variation in the triggering conditions of the various frogs' eyes, there could be no raw material [...] for selection for a ''new'' purpose to act upon. The indeterminacy that Fodor (and others) see as a flaw [...] is actually a prediction for such evolution [of "purpose"]. The idea that there must be ''something determinate'' that the frog's eye really means&amp;nbsp;– some possibly unknowable proposition in froggish that expresses ''exactly'' what the frog's eye is telling the frog's brain&amp;nbsp;– is just [[essentialism]] applied to meaning (or function). Meaning, like function on which it so directly depends, is not something determinate at its birth. [...]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dennet argues, controversially,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-personal.umich.edu/~lormand/phil/cons/qualia.htm Lormand, E. ''Qualia! Now Showing at a Theatre near you'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lucs.lu.se/ftp/pub/LUCS_Studies/LUCS58.pdf De Leon, D. ''The Qualities of Qualia''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226091151/http://www.lucs.lu.se/ftp/pub/LUCS_Studies/LUCS58.pdf |date=2007-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; against [[qualia]] in ''[[Consciousness Explained]]''. Qualia are attacked from several directions at once: he maintains they do not exist (or that they are too ill-defined to play any role in [[science]], or that they are really something else, i.e. behavioral [[disposition]]s). They cannot simultaneously have all the properties
attributed to them by philosophers—incorrigible, ineffable, private, directly accessible and so on. The [[multiple drafts]] theory is leveraged to show that facts about qualia are not definite. Critics   object that one's own qualia are subjectively quite clear and distinct to ''oneself''.

The self-replicating nature of memes is a partial explanation of the recurrence of indeterminacies in language and thought{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}. The wide influences of Platonism and Kantianism in Western philosophy can arguably be partially attributed to the indeterminacies of some of their most fundamental concepts (namely, the Idea and the [[Noumenon]], respectively).

For a given meme to exhibit replication and heritability&amp;nbsp;– that is, for it to be able to make an ''imperfect copy'' of itself which is more likely to share any given trait with its "parent" meme than with some random member of the general "population" of memes&amp;nbsp;– it must in some way be mutable, since memetic replication occurs by means of human conceptual imitation rather than via the discrete molecular processes that govern genetic replication. (If a statement were to generate copies of itself ''that didn't meaningfully differ from it'', that process of copying would more accurately be described as "duplication" than as "replication", and it would be incorrect to term these statements "memes"; the same would be true if the "child" statements did ''not'' noticeably inherit a substantial proportion of their traits from their "parent" statements.)
In other words, if a meme is defined roughly (and somewhat arbitrarily) as a statement (or as a collection of statements, like Foucault's "discursive formations") that inherits ''some'', but not ''all'', of its properties (or elements of its definition) from its "parent" memes and which self-replicates, then indeterminacy of definition could be seen as ''advantageous'' to memetic replication, since an absolute rigidity of definition would preclude memetic adaptation.

It is important to note that indeterminacy in [[linguistics]] can arguably partially be defeated by the fact that languages are always changing. However, what the entire language and its collected changes continue to reflect is sometimes still considered to be indeterminate.

===Criticism===

Persons of [[faith]] argue that faith "is the basis of all knowledge". The Wikipedia article on faith states that "one must assume, believe, or have ''faith'' in the credibility of a person, place, thing, or idea in order to have a basis for [[knowledge]]." In this way the object of one's faith is similar to Kant's [[noumenon]].

This would seem to attempt to make direct use of the indeterminacy of the object of one's faith as evidential support of its existence: if the object of one's faith were to be proven to exist (i.e., if it were no longer of indeterminate definition, or if it were no longer unquantifiable, etc.), then faith in that object would no longer be necessary; arguments from authority such as those mentioned above wouldn't either; all that would be needed to prove its existence would be scientific evidence. Thus, if faith is to be considered as a reliable basis for knowledge, persons of faith would seem, in effect, to assert that indeterminacy is not only necessary, but good (see [[Nassim Taleb]]).

==Indeterminacy in new physical theories==

[[Science]] generally attempts to eliminate vague definitions, causally inert entities, and indeterminate properties, via further observation, experimentation, characterization, and explanation. [[Occam's razor]] tends to eliminate causally inert entities from functioning models of quantifiable phenomena, but some quantitative models, such as [[quantum mechanics]], actually imply certain indeterminacies, such as the relative indeterminacy of quantum particles' positions to the precision with which their momenta can be measured (and vice versa). (See Heisenberg's [[indeterminacy principle]].)

One ardent supporter of the possibility of a final unifying theory (and thus, arguably, of the possibility of the end of some current indeterminacies) in physics, [[Steven Weinberg]], stated in an interview with PBS&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/elegant/view-weinberg.html Weinberg, S. PBS interview]&lt;/ref&gt; that:

"Sometimes [...] people say that surely there's no final theory because, after all, every time we've made a step toward unification or toward simplification we always find more and more complexity there. That just means we haven't found it yet. Physicists never thought they had the final theory."

The Wikipedia article on the possibility of such a "[[theory of everything]]" notes that

"Other possibilities which may frustrate the explanatory capacity of a TOE may include sensitivity to the boundary conditions of the universe, or the existence of mathematical chaos in its solutions, making its predictions precise, but useless."

[[Chaos theory]] argues that precise prediction of the behavior of complex systems becomes impossible because of the observer's inability to gather all necessary data.

As yet, it seems entirely possible that there shall never be any "final theory" of all phenomena, and that, rather, explanations may instead breed more and more complex and exact explanations of the new phenomena uncovered by current experimentation. In this argument, the "indeterminacy" or "thing in itself" is the "final explanation" that will never be reached; this can be compared to the concept of the limit in [[calculus]], in that quantities may approach, but never reach, a given limit in certain situations.

===Criticism===

Proponents of a [[deterministic]] universe have criticised various applications of the concept of indeterminacy in the sciences; for instance, [[Einstein]] once stated that "God does not play dice" in a succinct (but now unpopular)  argument against the theory of [[quantum indeterminacy]], which states that the actions of particles of extremely low mass or energy are unpredictable because an observer's interaction with them changes either their positions or momenta. (The "dice" in Einstein's metaphor refer to the ''probabilities'' that these particles will behave in particular ways, which is how [[quantum mechanics]] addressed the problem.)

At first it might seem that a criticism could be made from a [[biology|biological]] standpoint in that an indeterminate idea would ''seem'' not to be beneficial to the species that holds it.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} A strong counterargument, however, is that not all traits exhibited by living organisms will be seen in the long term as evolutionarily advantageous, given that extinctions occur regularly and that phenotypic traits have often died out altogether&amp;nbsp;– in other words, an indeterminate meme may in the long term demonstrate its evolutionary value to the species that produced it in ''either'' direction; humans are, as yet, the only species known to make use of such concepts.
It might also be argued that conceptual vagueness is an inevitability, given the limited capacity of the human nervous systems.  We just do not have enough neurons to maintain separate concepts for "dog  with 1,000,000 hairs", "dog with 1,000,001 hairs" and so on. But conceptual [[vagueness]] is not [[metaphysical indeterminacy]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Synonymous concepts in philosophy==
Uncertainty and indeterminacy are words for essentially the same concept in both quantum mechanics. Unquantifiability, and undefinability (or indefinability), can also sometimes be synonymous with indeterminacy. In science, indeterminacy can sometimes be interchangeable with unprovability or unpredictability. Also, anything entirely inobservable can be said to be indeterminate in that it cannot be precisely characterized.

[[File:IME demonstratie - Matsuo Bashou - Furu ikeya kawazu tobikomu mizuno oto.png|thumb|Operation of a typical Japanese [[romaji]]-based IME]]
[[File:Interface of Weasel Input Method.png|thumb|Operation of a Chinese [[Pinyin]]-based IME]]

An '''input method''' (or '''input method editor''', commonly abbreviated '''IME''') is an [[operating system]] component or program that allows any data, such as keyboard strokes or mouse movements, to be received as input. In this way users can enter characters and symbols not found on their [[input device]]s. Using an input method is obligatory for any language that has more [[grapheme]]s than there are keys on the keyboard.

For instance, on the computer, this allows the user of [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] [[Keyboard layout|keyboards]] to input [[Chinese character|Chinese]], [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]], [[Hangul|Korean]] and [[Indic script|Indic]] characters; on many hand-held devices, such as mobile phones, it enables using the [[telephone keypad|numeric keypad]] to enter [[Latin alphabet|Latin alphabet characters]] (or any other alphabet characters) or a screen display to be touched to do so. On some operating systems, an input method is also used to define the behaviour of the [[dead key]]s.

==Implementations==
{{expand section|date=January 2011}}
Although originally coined for [[CJK]] (Chinese, Japanese and Korean) computing, the term is now sometimes used generically to refer to a program to support the input of any language. To illustrate, in the [[X Window System]], the facility to allow the input of [[Latin character]]s with [[diacritic]]s is also called an input method.

On [[Windows XP]] or later [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], Input method, or IME, are also called ''Text Input Processor'', which are implemented by the [[Text Services Framework]] API.

==Relationship between the methodology and implementation==
While the term ''input method editor'' was originally used for [[Microsoft Windows#Multilingual support: IMEs and LIPs|Microsoft Windows]], its use has now gained acceptance in other operating systems{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}, especially when it is important to distinguish between the [[Interface (computer science)|computer interface]] and implementation of input methods, or among the input methods themselves, the editing functionality of the program or operating system component providing the input method, and the general support of input methods in an operating system. This term has, for example, gained general acceptance on the GNU/Linux operating system; it is also used on the Mac OS.
*The term ''input method'' generally refers to a particular way to use the keyboard to input a particular language, for example the [[Cangjie method]], the [[pinyin method]], or the use of [[dead key]]s.
*On the other hand, the term ''input method editor'' on Microsoft products refers to the actual program that allows an input method to be used (for example MS New Pinyin). [[Predictive Input Method|PRIME]],{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} or [[Smart Common Input Method|SCIM]] prefer the term of ''Input Method Engine'', ''Input Method platform'' or ''Input Method environment'',{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} or the actual ''editing area'' that allows the user to do the input. It can also &lt;!-- apparently --&gt; refer to a character palette, which allows any Unicode character to be input individually. One might also interpret IME to refer to the editor used for creating or modifying the data files upon which an input method relies.

Interactive writing has been described by Swartz (2001) as "a teaching method in which children and teacher negotiate what they are going to write and then share the pen to construct the message."  Interactive writing is a cooperative event in which text is jointly composed and written.  The teacher uses the interactive writing session to model reading and writing strategies as he or she engages children in creating text.

Interactive writing was also included by Fountas &amp; Pinnell as part of their balanced literacy framework. Similar to shared writing, interactive writing allows a teacher and students to literally "share the pen" to create a joint sentence or message. Typically used in the primary grades, interactive writing is a powerful instructional medium for teaching phonics, spelling principles, rimes, writing conventions, and other key early writing skills. This form of interactive writing is thoroughly explained and detailed in the book ''Interactive Writing: How Language &amp; Literacy Come Together, K-2'' by Andrea McCarrier, Gay Su Pinnell, and Irene Fountas. 

Others have described '''interactive writing''' differently as a method used in [[literacy teaching]], especially for young children, whereby the students have the opportunity to practice their reading, studying and writing skills in a safe and creative environment. 

In this method the teacher(s) and students write to each other, by means of letters, [[dialogue journal]]s or a message board. The students are free to choose the topic and the length of their writings. The teachers respond without correcting or criticising the spelling, grammar or writing style, but rather modelling more appropriate forms of writing.

The aim of this method is to allow children to see literacy as something meaningful and enjoyable, rather than a mind-numbing school activity. The focus is on fluency rather than accuracy. The principle behind it is 'write to learn, not learn to write'. As such it relates to the learner-centered [[whole language]] approach.

The interactive writing method has been described in books such as:

Peyton, Joy Kreeft (ed.) (1990) ''Students and Teachers Writing Together: Perspectives on Journal Writing.''

Robinson, A., L. Crawford &amp; N. Hall (1990) ''some day you will no all about me: Young Children's Explorations in the World of Letter Writing.''

'''Language ideology''' (also referred to as '''linguistic ideology''') is a concept used primarily within the fields of [[anthropology]] (especially [[linguistic anthropology]]), [[sociolinguistics]], and [[cross-cultural studies]] to characterize any set of beliefs or feelings about [[language]]s as used in their social worlds. When recognized and explored, language ideologies expose connections between the beliefs speakers have about language and the larger social and cultural systems they are a part of, illustrating how these beliefs are informed by and rooted in such systems.  By doing so, language ideologies link the implicit as well as explicit assumptions people have about a language or language in general to their social experience and political as well as economic interests. Language ideologies are conceptualizations about languages, speakers, and discursive practices. Like other kinds of ideologies, language ideologies are influenced by political and moral interests and are shaped in a cultural setting. &lt;ref&gt;Irvine, J. T. (2012, January 11). Language Ideology. Retrieved February 9, 2018, from

==Applications and approaches==

===Definitions===
Several scholars have noted difficulty in attempting to delimit the scope, meaning, and applications of language ideology.  [[Linguistic anthropology|Linguistic anthropologist]] [[Paul Kroskrity]] describes language ideology as a “cluster concept, consisting of a number of converging dimensions” with several “partially overlapping but analytically distinguishable layers of significance,” and cites that in the existing scholarship on language ideology “there is no particular unity . . . no core literature, and a range of definitions.”&lt;ref name=Kroskrity&gt;{{cite book|last=Duranti|first=ed. by Alessandro|title=A companion to linguistic anthropology|year=2004|publisher=Blackwell|location=Malden, Mass. [u.a.]|isbn=0-631-22352-5|pages=496–517|edition=[Repr.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the broadest definitions is offered by Alan Rumsey, who describes language ideologies as “shared bodies of commonsense notions about the nature of language in the world.”&lt;ref name=Rumsey&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rumsey|first=Alan|title=Wording, Meaning, and Linguistic Ideology|journal=American Anthropologist|year=1990|volume=92|issue=2|pages=346–361|doi=10.1525/aa.1990.92.2.02a00060}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This definition is seen by Kroskrity as unsatisfactory, however, because “it fails to problematize language ideological variation and therefore promotes an overly homogeneous view of language ideologies within a cultural group.”&lt;ref name=Kroskrity /&gt;  Emphasizing the role of speakers’ awareness in influencing language structure, [[Michael Silverstein]] defines linguistic ideologies as “sets of beliefs about language articulated by users as a rationalization or justification of perceived language structure and use.”&lt;ref name=Silverstein&gt;Silverstein, M. (1979). Language Structure and Linguistic Ideology. In P. Clyne, W. Hanks, and C. Hofbauer (eds.), The Elements (pp. 193–248). Chicago: Chicago Linguistic Society.&lt;/ref&gt; Definitions that place greater emphasis on [[sociocultural linguistics|sociocultural factors]] include [[Shirley Heath]]’s characterization of language ideologies as “self-evident ideas and objectives a group holds concerning roles of language in the social experiences of members as they contribute to the expression of the group”&lt;ref name=Heath&gt;Heath, SB. (1977). Social history. In Bilingual Education: Current Perspectives. Vol. 1: Social Science, pp. 53--72. Arlington,
VA: Center for Applied Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Judith Irvine]]’s definition of the concept as “the [[cultural system]] of ideas about social and linguistic relationships, together with their loading of moral and political interests.”&lt;ref name="Irvine1989"&gt;[[Judith Irvine|Irvine, J.]] (1989). When talk isn't cheap: language and political economy. American Ethnologist 16(2):248-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical vs. neutral approaches===
The basic division in studies of language ideology is between neutral and critical approaches to [[ideology]].&lt;ref name=BB /&gt;  In neutral approaches to language ideology, speakers’ beliefs or ideas about language are understood as being shaped by the cultural systems in which they are embedded, but no attempt to identify variation within or across these systems is made.  Often, a single ideology will be identified in such cases.  Characterizations of language ideology as representative of an entire community or [[culture]], such as those routinely documented in [[ethnography|ethnographic research]], are common examples of neutral approaches to language ideology.&lt;ref name=Woolard /&gt;

Critical approaches to language ideology explore the capacity for language and linguistic ideologies to be used as strategies for maintaining [[Power (social and political)|social power]] and domination.  They are described by [[Kathryn Woolard]] and Bambi Schieffelin as studies of "some aspects of representation and [[social cognition]], with particular social origins or functional and formal characteristics."&lt;ref name=BB&gt;{{cite journal|last=Woolard|first=Kathryn A.|author2=Schieffelin, Bambi B. |title=Language Ideology|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1994|volume=23|issue=1|pages=55–82|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.23.100194.000415}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although such studies are often noted for their discussions of [[language politics]] and the intersection between language and [[social class]], the crucial difference between these approaches to language ideology and neutral understandings of the concept is that the former emphasize the existence of variability and contradiction both within and amongst ideologies, while the latter approach ideology as a conception on its own terms.&lt;ref&gt;Woolard, K.A. (1992) "Language Ideology: Issues and Approaches." In P. Kroskrity, B. Schieffelin, K. Woolard, eds. Language Ideologies. Special Issue of Pragmatics 2 (3): 235-249.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of inquiry==

===Language use and structure===
Many scholars have argued that ideology plays a role in shaping and influencing linguistic structures and speech forms.  Michael Silverstein, for example, sees speakers’ awareness of language and their rationalizations of its structure and use as critical factors that often shape the evolution of a language’s structure.&lt;ref name="Silverstein"/&gt;  According to Silverstein, the ideologies speakers possess regarding language mediate the variation that occurs due to their imperfect and limited awareness of linguistic structures, resulting in the regularization of any variation that is rationalized by any sufficiently dominant or culturally widespread ideologies.&lt;ref name="Silverstein"/&gt;  This is demonstrated by such linguistic changes as the rejection of “he” as the generic pronoun in [[English language|English]], which coincided with the rise of the [[feminist movement]] in the second half of the twentieth century {{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}.  In this instance, the accepted usage of the masculine pronoun as the generic form came to be understood as a linguistic symbol of [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] and male-dominated society, and the growing sentiment opposing these conditions motivated some speakers to stop using “he” as the generic pronoun in favor of the construction “he or she.”  This rejection of generic “he” was rationalized by the growing desire for [[gender equality]] and women’s empowerment, which was sufficiently culturally prevalent to regularize the change.

Alan Rumsey also sees linguistic ideologies as playing a role in shaping the structure of a language, describing a circular process of reciprocal influence where a language’s structure conditions the ideologies that affect it, which in turn reinforce and expand this structure, altering the language “in the name of making it more like itself.”&lt;ref name=Rumsey /&gt;  This process is exemplified by the excessive glottalization of consonants by bilingual speakers of [[endangered language|moribund]] varieties of [[Xincan languages|Xinca]], who effectively altered the structure of this language in order to make it more distinct from [[Spanish language|Spanish]].&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;Campbell, Lyle; &amp; Muntzel, M. (1989). The structural consequences of language death. In N. C. Dorian (Ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;  These speakers glottalized consonants in situations where more competent speakers of Xinca would not because they were not only less familiar with the phonological rules of the language, but because they wished to distinguish themselves from socially dominant Spanish, whose speakers viewed glottalized consonants as “exotic.”&lt;ref name=Campbell /&gt;

===Ethnography of speaking===
Studies of "ways of speaking" within specific communities have been recognized as especially productive sites of language ideological investigation.  They often include a community’s own theory of speech as a part of their ethnography, which allows for the documentation of explicit language ideologies on a community-wide level or in “the neutral sense of cultural conceptions.”&lt;ref name=Woolard /&gt;  A study of language socialization practices in [[Dominica]], for example, revealed that local notions of personhood, status, and authority are associated with the strategic usage of Patwa and English in the course of the adult-child interaction.&lt;ref name=Paugh&gt;Paugh, A.L. (2005). ‘Acting adult: Language socialization, shift, and ideologies in Dominica, West Indies’, in J. Cohen, K.T. McAlister, K. Rolstad, and J. MacSwan (eds.), Proceedings of the 4th International Symposium on Bilingualism. Cascadilla Press, Somerville, MA, 1807–1820.&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of Patwa by children is largely forbidden by adults due to a perception that it inhibits the acquisition of English and thus restricts [[social mobility]], which in turn has imbued Patwa with a significant measure of [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|covert prestige]] and rendered it a powerful tool for children to utilize in order to defy authority.&lt;ref name=Paugh /&gt;  Thus there are multiple, competing ideologies of Patwa in Dominica: one which encourages a shift away from Patwa usage; and another which contributes to its maintenance.

====Linguistic ideologies in speech act theory====
[[J. L. Austin]] and [[John Searle]]'s [[speech act theory]] has been described by several ethnographers, anthropologists, and linguists as being based in a specifically Western linguistic ideology that renders it inapplicable in certain ethnographic contexts.&lt;ref name=Woolard /&gt;  Jef Verschueren characterized speech act theory as privileging “a privatized view of language that emphasizes the psychological state of the speaker while downplaying the social consequences of speech,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Verschueren|first=Jef|title=What people say they do with words : prolegomena to an empirical-conceptual approach to linguistic action|year=1985|publisher=Ablex Pub. Corp.|location=Norwood, N.J.|isbn=0893911968}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while Michael Silverstein argued that the theory’s ideas about language “acts” and “forces” are “projections of covert categories typical in the [[metapragmatics|metapragmatic]] discourse of languages such as English.”&lt;ref name="Silverstein"/&gt;  Scholars have subsequently used speech act theory to caution against the positioning of linguistic theories as universal applicable, citing that any account of language will reflect the linguistic ideologies held by those who develop it.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, M.L. (1986). Ideology and Speech-Act Theory. Poetics Today 7.1: 59-72&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language contact and multilingualism===
Several scholars have noted that sites of cultural contact promote the development of new linguistic forms that draw on diverse language varieties and ideologies at an accelerated rate.  According to Miki Makihara and Bambi Schieffelin, it becomes necessary during times of cultural contact for speakers to actively negotiate language ideologies and to consciously reflect on language use.&lt;ref name=contact /&gt;  This articulation of ideology is essential to prevent misconceptions of meaning and intentions between cultures, and provides a link between sociocultural and linguistic processes in contact situations.&lt;ref name=contact&gt;{{cite book|last=Schieffelin|first=edited by Miki Makihara, Bambi B.|title=Consequences of contact : language ideologies and sociocultural transformations in Pacific societies|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University|location=Oxford|isbn=0195324986|pages=1–22|edition=[Reprint.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language policy and standardization===
The establishment of a [[standard language]] has many implications in the realms of politics and power.  Recent examinations of language ideologies have resulted in the conception of “standard” as a matter of ideology rather than fact,&lt;ref name=Woolard&gt;{{cite book|last=Woolard|first=Kathryn|title=Language ideologies : practice and theory|year=1998|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-19-510561-3|pages=3–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; raising questions such as “how doctrines of linguistic correctness and incorrectness are rationalized and how they are related to doctrines of the inherent representational power, beauty, and expressiveness of language as a valued mode of action.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Silverstein|first=Michael|title=Language and the Culture of Gender: At the Intersection of Structure, Usage and Ideology.|year=1985|publisher=Academic Press|location=Orlando, Fla.|pages=219–259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Language policy====
Governmental policies often reflect the tension between two contrasting types of language ideologies: ideologies that conceive of language as a resource, problem, or right&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ruiz|first=Richard|title=Orientations in Language Planning|journal=National Association for Bilingual Education Journal|year=1984|volume=8|series=15-34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M., &amp; Hornberger, N.H. (2016). Re-visiting orientations to language planning: problem, right, and resource. &lt;i&gt;Bilingual Review/La revista bilingüe, 33&lt;/i&gt;(3), 30-49. Available from http://bilingualreview.utsa.edu/index.php/br/article/view/118&lt;/ref&gt; and ideologies that conceive of language as pluralistic phenomena.&lt;ref name=Woolard /&gt; The language-related policies that emerge in such instances often reflect the compromise that is reached between these two types of ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M., &amp; Pietikäinen, S. (2014).  Shaping discourses of multilingualism through a language ideological debate: The case of Swedish in Finland. &lt;i&gt;Journal of Language and Politics, 13&lt;/i&gt;, 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Blommaert and Verschueren, this compromise is often reinterpreted as a single, unified ideology, evidenced by the many [[Europe]]an societies characterized by a language ideological ''[[Homogeneity|homogenism]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jaspers|first=Jürgen|title=Society and language use|year=2010|publisher=John Benjamins Pub. Co.|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9027207844|pages=189–210|author2=Östman, Jan-Ola |author3=Verschueren, Jef }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ideologies of linguistic purism====
[[Linguistic purism|Purist language ideologies]] or ideologies of linguistic conservatism can close off languages to nonnative sources of innovation, usually when such sources are perceived as socially or politically threatening to the target language.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, B. (1989). Francophonie: Purism at the International Level. In The Politics of Language Purism, ed. Bjorn H. Jernudd and Michael Shapiro, pp. 53-80. Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the [[Tewa]], for example, the influence of theocratic institutions and ritualized linguistic forms in other domains of Tewa society have led to a strong resistance to the extensive [[Loanword|borrowing]] and [[Language shift|shift]] many of its neighboring language communities have experienced. According to [[Paul Kroskrity]] this is due to a "dominant language ideology" through which ceremonial Kiva speech is elevated to a linguistic ideal and the cultural preferences that it embodies, namely regulation by convention, indigenous purism, strict compartmentalization, and linguistic indexing of identity, are recursively projected onto the Tewa language as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Kroskrity, Paul V. (1993). Language, History, and Identity: Ethnolinguistic Studies of the Arizona Tewa. Tucson: University of Arizona Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kroskrity, Paul V. (1998). Arizona Tewa Kiva Speech as a Manifestation of Linguistic Ideology. In ''Language ideologies: Practice and theory''. Bambi B. Schieffelin, Kathryn A. Woolard, and Paul V. Kroskrity, eds., pp. 103-122. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexandra Jaffe]] points out that language purism is often part of “essentializing discourses” that can lead to stigmatizing habitual language practices like [[code-switching]] and depict [[language contact|contact-induced linguistic changes]] as forms of cultural deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffe, Alexandra (2007). “Discourses of endangerment: Contexts and consequences of essentializing discourses.” In ''Discourses of Endangerment: Ideology and Interest in the Defence of Languages,'' eds. Alexandre Duchêne and Monica Heller, pp. 57-75. London: Continuum.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Standard language ideology====
As defined by [[Rosina Lippi-Green]], standard language ideology is "a bias toward an abstract, idealized homogeneous language, which is imposed and maintained by dominant institutions and which has as its model the written language, but which is drawn primarily from the spoken language of the upper middle class." According to Lippi-Green, part of this ideology is a belief that standard languages are internally consistent.&lt;ref name=Green1997&gt;Lippi-Green, R. (1997). English with an accent: Language, ideology, and discrimination in the United States. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Linguists generally agree, however, that variation is intrinsic to all spoken language, including standard varieties.&lt;ref name=Tollefson1999&gt;Tollefson, J.W. (1999). Language Ideology and Language Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

Standard language ideology is strongly connected with the concepts of [[linguistic purism]] and [[linguistic prescriptivism|prescriptivism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor=Elabbas Benmamoun|author=Keith Walters|author2=Reem Bassiouney|title=The Routledge Handbook of Arabic Linguistics|publisher=Routledge|date=2017|isbn=9781351377799|pages=483|chapter=Arab nationalism and/as language ideology|url=https://www.routledgehandbooks.com/pdf/doi/10.4324/9781315147062-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Language, Society and Power: An Introduction|author=Annabelle Mooney|author2=Betsy Evans|publisher=Routledge|date=2018|isbn=9780429823398|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nnd0DwAAQBAJ&amp;q=standard+language+ideology#v=snippet&amp;q=standard%20language%20ideology&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Tvrtko Vuković|editor2=Maša Kolanović|author=Mate Kapović|chapter=Jezik i konzervativizam|title=Komparativni postsocijalizam: slavenska iskustva|publisher=Zagrebačka slavistička škola|pages=391-400|date=2013|url=https://www.lupiga.com/vijesti/jezik-i-konzervatizam-nije-tesko-vidjeti-da-je-jezicni-purizam-desni-politicki-projekt|accessdate=16 November 2018|language=sh}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also linked with [[linguistic discrimination|linguicism]] (linguistic discrimination).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Miklós Kontra|title=The Unrecognized Linguistic Right in Hungarian Education|year=2012|url=http://allstudentsaboard.eu/Downloads/CountryInformation/LinguisticRights/Hungary_LR2.pdf|accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literacy===
[[Literacy]] cannot be strictly defined technically, but is rather a set of practices determined by the language ideology of a community.  It can be interpreted in a multitude of ways that are determined by political, social, and economic forces.&lt;ref&gt;Street, B.V. (1984). Literacy in Theory and Practice. New York: Cambridge Univ. Press&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Kathryn Woolard and Bambi Schieffelin, literacy traditions are closely linked to social control in most societies.&lt;ref name=BB /&gt;  The typical European literacy ideology, for example, recognizes literacy solely in an alphabetic capacity.&lt;ref name= Woolard /&gt;

====Kaluli literacy development====
In the 1960s, missionaries arrived in [[Papua New Guinea]] and exposed the [[Kaluli]] to [[Christianity]] and [[modernization]], part of which was accomplished through the introduction of literacy.&lt;ref name=kaluli&gt;Schieffelin, B. B. (2000). Introducing Kaluli Literacy: A Chronology of Influences. In P. V. Kroskrity (ed.), Regimes of Language: pp. 293–327. Santa Fe, NM: School of American Research Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Kaluli primers that were introduced by the missionaries promoted [[Westernization]], which effectively served to strip the [[Vernacular|vernacular language]] of cultural practices and from [[discourse]] in church and school.&lt;ref name="kaluli"/&gt;  Readers written in the 1970s used derogatory terms to refer to the Kaluli and depicted their practices as inferior, motivating the Kaluli to change their self-perceptions and orient themselves towards Western values.&lt;ref name="kaluli"/&gt;  The missionaries’ control of these authoritative books and of this new “technology of language literacy” gave them the power to effect culture change and morph the ideology of Kaluli into that of modern Christianity.&lt;ref name="kaluli"/&gt;

===Orthography===
[[Orthography|Orthographic systems]] always carry historical, cultural, and political meaning that are grounded in ideology.&lt;ref name= Woolard /&gt;  Orthographic debates are focused on political and social issues rather than on linguistic discrepancies, which can make for intense debates characterized by ideologically charged stances and symbolically important decisions.&lt;ref name= Woolard /&gt;

===Classroom practice/second language acquisition===
"Language ideologies are not confined merely to ideas or beliefs, but rather is extended to include the very language practices through which our ideas or notions are enacted" (Razfar, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;Razfar, A. (2005). Language ideologies in practice: Repair and classroom discourse. Linguistics and Education, 16(4), 404-424.&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers display their language ideologies in classroom instruction through various practices such as correction or repair, affective alignment, metadiscourse, and narrative (see Razfar &amp; Rumenapp, 2013, p.&amp;nbsp;289).&lt;ref&gt;Razfar, A., &amp; Rumenapp, J.C. (2013) Applying linguistics in the classroom: A sociocultural perspective. NY, NY: Routledge Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of ideology seeks to uncover the hidden world of students and teachers to shed light on the fundamental forces that shape and give meaning to their actions and interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Tollefson, J.W., Yamagami, M. (2012). Language ideology in a language classroom. The Encyclopedia of Applied Linguistics. Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''lecture''' (from the French 'lecture', meaning 'reading' [process]) is an oral [[presentation]] intended to present information or teach people about a particular subject, for example by a [[university]] or [[college]] [[teacher]]. Lectures are used to convey critical information, history, background, theories, and equations. A politician's speech, a minister's sermon, or even a businessman's sales presentation may be similar in form to a lecture.  Usually the lecturer will stand at the front of the room and recite information relevant to the lecture's content.

Though lectures are much criticised as a [[teaching method]], universities have not yet found practical alternative teaching methods for the large majority of their courses.&lt;ref name=cirtl /&gt;  Critics point out that lecturing is mainly a one-way method of [[communication]] that does not involve significant audience participation but relies upon [[passive learning]].  Therefore, lecturing is often contrasted to [[active learning]]. Lectures delivered by talented speakers can be highly stimulating; at the very least, lectures have survived in [[academia]] as a quick, cheap, and efficient way of introducing large numbers of students to a particular field of study.

Lectures have a significant role outside the classroom, as well. Academic and scientific awards routinely include a lecture as part of the honor, and academic conferences often center on "[[keynote|keynote addresses]]", i.e., lectures. The [[public lecture]] has a long history in the sciences and in [[social movement]]s. [[Hiring hall|Union halls]], for instance, historically have hosted numerous free and public lectures on a wide variety of matters. Similarly, [[Local church|churches]], [[Community centre|community center]]s, [[library|libraries]], [[museum]]s, and other organizations have hosted lectures in furtherance of their missions or their constituents' interests. Lectures represent a continuation of [[oral tradition]] in contrast to textual communication in books and other media. Lectures may be considered a type of [[grey literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://greynet.org/greysourceindex/documenttypes.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603045435/http://greynet.org/greysourceindex/documenttypes.html |archivedate=2016-06-03 |df= }} GreyNet International, Document Types in Grey Literature&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
[[File:Golan levin.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Golan Levin]] lecturing using a projected side]]
The noun "lecture" dates from 14th century, meaning "action of reading, that which is read," from the [[Latin]] ''lectus'', pp. of ''legere'' "to read." Its subsequent meaning as "oral discourse on a given subject before an audience for purposes of [[Education|instruction]]" is from the 16th century. The verb "to lecture" is attested from 1590.
The noun "lectern" refers to the reading desk used by lecturers.

==History==
The practice in the [[medieval university]] was for the instructor to read from an original source to a class of students who took notes on the lecture. The reading from original sources evolved into the reading of glosses on an original and then more generally to lecture notes. Throughout much of history, the diffusion of knowledge via handwritten lecture notes was an essential element of academic life.

[[File:Rembrandt - The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp.jpg|upright=1.3|thumb|Rembrandt's ''The Anatomy Lecture of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp'']]
Even in the twentieth century, the lecture notes taken by students, or prepared by a scholar for a lecture, have sometimes achieved wide circulation (see, for example, the genesis of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s ''Cours de linguistique générale'').  Many lecturers were, and still are, accustomed to simply reading their own notes from the lectern for exactly that purpose. Nevertheless, modern lectures generally incorporate additional activities, e.g. writing on a chalk-board, exercises, class questions and discussions, or student presentations.

The use of [[multimedia]] presentation software such as [[Microsoft PowerPoint]] has changed the form of lectures, e.g. video, graphics, websites, or prepared exercises may be included. Most commonly, however, only outlines composed of "bullet points" are presented.  Critics such as [[Edward Tufte]]  contend that this style of lecture bombards the audience with unnecessary and possibly distracting or confusing graphics.&lt;ref&gt;Tufte, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

A modified lecture format, generally presented in 5 to 15 minute short segments, is now commonly presented as video, for example in [[massive open online course]]s (MOOCs) or in programs such as the [[Khan Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/daphne_koller_what_we_re_learning_from_online_education.html Daphne Koller, ''What we're learning from online education''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804030308/http://www.ted.com/talks/daphne_koller_what_we_re_learning_from_online_education.html |date=2012-08-04 }}, June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
[[File:Hogarth lecture 1736.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.3|[[William Hogarth]]'s 1736 [[engraving]], 
''Scholars at a Lecture'']]
Bligh, in ''What's the Use of Lectures?'', argues that lectures "represent a conception of education in which teachers who know give knowledge to students who do not and are therefore supposed to have nothing worth contributing."  Based on his review of numerous studies, he concludes that lecturing is as effective, but not more effective, as any other teaching method in transmitting information.  Nevertheless, lecturing is not the most effective method for promoting student thought, changing attitudes, or teaching behavioral skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113| title = Natural Learning in Higher Education| author = J. Scott Armstrong| journal = Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning| year = 2012| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140916150012/https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113| archivedate = 2014-09-16| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bligh summarises research on memory to show the significance of the meaningfulness of material on retention (Marks and Miller 1964) and the importance of immediate rehearsal of information (Bassey 1968).  He relates his own research on arousal during lectures to suggest a decrement in attention during the first 25 minutes.  Lloyd (1968) and Scerbo et al. (1992) showed that students take less and less notes as lectures proceed. Bligh shows that after a short break filled by buzz group discussion, attention will recover somewhat. 
The largest section of Bligh's book is devoted to lecturing technique, particularly the organisation of lectures, how to make a point, the effectiveness of taking notes, the use of handouts, and ways of obtaining feedback.

The conception of the lecture as needing to be a didactic event has been challenged by Meltzer and Manivannan (2002) and Sandry (2005) who maintain that lectures can involve active learning.&lt;ref name="byrne"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275637847_Using_Technology_to_Prevent_Plagiarism_Skilling_the_Students|title=Using Technology to Prevent Plagiarism: Skilling the Students|first1=Christopher|last1=Ireland|first2=Gillian|last2=Byrne|date=29 April 2015|publisher=|via=ResearchGate|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831175516/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275637847_Using_Technology_to_Prevent_Plagiarism_Skilling_the_Students|archivedate=31 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Elliot (2005) sees difficulties in the encouragement of active learning with phenomena such as [[social loafing]] and [[Evaluation apprehension model|evaluation apprehension]] causing audience members to be reluctant to participate.&lt;ref name=byrne/&gt; A possible solution to the encouragement of audience involvement in lectures is the use of an [[Audience response#Use in Educational Settings|audience response system]] which allows audience members to participate anonymously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/02602938.2015.1024199 | volume=41 | title=Academic integrity: a quantitative study of confidence and understanding in students at the start of their higher education | journal=Assessment &amp; Evaluation in Higher Education | pages=482–497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantages===
The effectiveness of traditional lecture is and has been debated. Some advantages of lecturing include: quick exposure to new material, greater teacher control in the classroom, an engaging format, which may complement and clarify course material, and facilitating large-class communication.&lt;ref name=cirtl /&gt;  Lecturing also permits the dissemination of unpublished or not readily available material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advantages &amp; Disadvantages of Lecturing|url=http://www.southalabama.edu/languages/spanish/TRG/TRG/Enhancing_Learning/Lecturing/advantages.htm|website=TeachingResourcesGuide.com|publisher=South Alabama University|accessdate=4 March 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402112936/http://www.southalabama.edu/languages/spanish/TRG/TRG/Enhancing_Learning/Lecturing/advantages.htm|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
There has been much debate as to whether or not lecturing actually improves student learning in the classroom.  Commonly cited disadvantages of lecture include: placing students in a passive (rather than an active) role, encouraging one-way communication, requiring significant out-of-class time for students to engage with the material, and requiring the speaker to possess effective speaking skills.&lt;ref name=cirtl&gt;{{cite web|title=Lecturing: Advantages and Disadvantages of the Traditional Lecture Method|url=http://www.cirtl.net/node/2570|publisher=CIRTL Network|accessdate=11 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311181116/http://www.cirtl.net/node/2570|archivedate=11 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criticisms of lectures are often summarized by a quote generally misattributed&lt;ref name=notes2notes/&gt; to [[Mark Twain]]:
{{quote|College is a place where a professor’s lecture notes go straight to the students’ lecture notes, without passing through the brains of either.&lt;ref name=notes2notes&gt;{{cite web|title=The Professor’s Lecture Notes Go Straight to the Students’ Lecture Notes|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/08/17/lecture-minds/|work=Quote Investigator|accessdate=April 19, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502201823/http://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/08/17/lecture-minds/|archivedate=May 2, 2013|df=}}.

While lecturing is generally accepted as an effective form of instruction, there have been some prominent educators who have succeeded without the help of lectures.

Many [[university]] courses relying on lectures supplement them with smaller discussion sections, [[tutorial]]s, or laboratory experiment sessions as a means of further actively involving students. Often these supplemental sections are led by [[Postgraduate education|graduate student]]s, [[tutor]]s, [[teaching assistant]]s, or teaching [[fellow]]s rather than senior [[Faculty (division)|faculty]]. Those other forms of academic teaching include [[Conversation|discussion]] ([[recitation]] if conducted by a teaching assistant), [[seminar]]s, [[Training workshop|workshop]]s, [[observation]], practical application, [[case example]]s/[[case study]], [[experiential learning]]/[[active learning]], [[computer]]-based instruction, and [[tutorial]]s. 
  
In [[school]]s, the prevalent mode of student-teacher interaction is [[lesson]]s.

The term "[[Parlour|parlor]] lecture" gained currency throughout the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth of Nations]] and the [[United States|United States of America]] during the mid-19th century.  It referred to the custom of inviting noted speakers to deliver private lectures, which were typically hosted in the parlors of wealthy and socially influential families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.virginia.edu/~rmf8a/gaskell/EveningP.htm Gaskell's Compendium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202172539/http://people.virginia.edu/~rmf8a/gaskell/EveningP.htm |date=2008-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Media stylistics''' or '''mediated stylistics''' is a branch of [[Linguistics#Functional approaches|functional]] [[stylistics (linguistics)|stylistics]] that studies human communication in [[mass media]]. It can be considered a branch of [[media linguistics]]; that is, how media [[speech]] depends on the [[content (media)|content]], aims of communicators and the medium.

Media stylistics as a research approach is widely known in [[Eastern Europe]] and especially in [[Russia]], through the work of A. Vasileva, M. Kozhina, V. Kostomarov, L. Maydanova, I. Lysakova, K. Rogova, G. Solganik and others.

==Main problems==
Modern media stylistics in Russia develops mainly as stylistics of media text. The main particular problems of media stylistics are:
* the correlation between linguistic and extralinguistic organization of media texts;
* the role of the author's voice (G. Solganik, L. Kayda, L. Maydanova, N. Tsvetova, T. Shmeleva), their social (I. Lysakova) and genre (L. Duskaeva; I. Myasnikov; L. Maydanova, S. Kalganova, V. Konkov) typology;
* regularities of speech discovery of media texts as interaction of semantic positions (L. Duskaeva, T. Chernyshova), phatic (N. Kornilova, E. Chepkina, T. Chernyshova), polemic (L. Duskaeva, M. Kormilitsyna) and even hostile (E. Kakorina, V. Salimovsky, A. Skovorodnikov);
* sphere of concepts represented in media texts (E. Abramova, E. Malysheva, O. Orlova), their architectonics and composition (N. Bolotnova, L. Kayda, V. Konkov, N. Kuzmina);
* several expressive characteristics (T. Krasnova, M. Kormilitsyna) or their system (G. Bobrovskaya, G. Kopnina, A. Skovorodnikov; M. Kormilitsyna);
* idiostyle in a speech media environment (N. Bolotnova, M. Kormilitsyna O. Sirotinina), its textual (T. Matveeva) and functional semantics and stylistics (L. Duskaeva, T. Permyakova), intentional stylistics (L. Duskaeva, N. Tsvetova) and intentional (N. Klushina) categories - all those speech properties of texts which promote its effectiveness.

Along with stylistics of socio-political texts (V. Konkov, V. Salimovsky, G. Solganik, N. Klushina), the stylistics of journalistic leisure-texts develops (L. Duskaeva, N. Klushina, V. Konkov, E. Kara-Murza, T. Redkina, N. Tsvetova). The intentional-stylistic approach to the study of these texts develops extensively (V. Barbashov, L. Duskaeva, N. Kornilova, K.Prokhorova, N. Tsvetova) as well as stylistic approach to lingvo-etic problems (N. Bessarabova, T. Surikova, V. Suzdaltseva). As separate lines of media stylistics can be considered semiotic lingvostylistics of advertising texts (E. Kara-Murza), expert media stylistics (A. Baranov, E. Kara-Murza, M. Gorbanevsky, T. Chernyshova), stylistics of online media texts (E. Kakorina, T. Karpova).&lt;ref&gt;Duskaeva L. Media Stylistics: The New Concept or New Phenomenon // [[Russian Journal of Communication]]. 2011. № 4.

Broadly, any '''metalanguage''' is language or symbols used when language itself is being discussed or examined.&lt;ref&gt;2010. ''Cambridge Advanced Learner‘s Dictionary''. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]]. Dictionary online. Available from http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/metalanguage Internet. Retrieved 20 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In [[logic]] and [[linguistics]], a metalanguage is a language used to make statements about statements in another language (the [[object language]]). Expressions in a metalanguage are often distinguished from those in an object language by the use of italics, quotation marks, or writing on a separate line.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} The structure of sentences and phrases in a metalanguage can be described by a [[metasyntax]].&lt;ref&gt;van Wijngaarden, A., et al. "[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-95279-1_2 Language and metalanguage]." Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language Algol 68. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 1976. 17-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

There are a variety of recognized metalanguages, including ''embedded'', ''ordered'', and ''nested'' (or, ''hierarchical'').

=== Embedded ===

An '''embedded metalanguage''' is a language formally, naturally and firmly fixed in an object language. This idea is found in [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s book, ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', in a discussion of the relationship between formal languages and [[number theory]]: "... it is in the nature of any formalization of number theory that its metalanguage is embedded within it".&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas Hofstadter|Hofstadter, Douglas]]. 1980. [[Gödel, Escher, Bach|''Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid'']]. New York: Vintage Books {{isbn|0-14-017997-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs in natural, or informal, languages, as well—such as in English, where words such as ''noun,'' ''verb,'' or even ''word'' describe features and concepts pertaining to the English language itself.

=== Ordered ===

An '''ordered metalanguage''' is analogous to [[ordered logic]]. An example of an ordered metalanguage is the construction of one metalanguage to discuss an object language, followed by the creation of another metalanguage to discuss the first, etc.

=== Nested ===

A '''nested''' (or, ''hierarchical'') '''metalanguage''' is similar to an ordered metalanguage in that each level represents a greater degree of abstraction. However, a nested metalanguage differs from an ordered one in that each level includes the one below. The [[paradigmatic]] example of a nested metalanguage comes from the [[Scientific classification|Linnean taxonomic system]] in biology. Each level in the system incorporates the one below it. The language used to discuss genus is also used to discuss species; the one used to discuss orders is also used to discuss genera, etc., up to kingdoms.

== In natural language ==

Natural language combines nested and ordered metalanguages. In a natural language there is an infinite regress of metalanguages, each with more specialized vocabulary and simpler syntax. Designating the language now as L&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the grammar of the language is a discourse in the metalanguage L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, which is a sublanguage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The grammar of L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, which has the form of a factual description, is a discourse in the metametalanguage L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is also a sublanguage of L&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. The grammar of L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which has the form of a theory describing the syntactic structure of such factual descriptions, is stated in the metametametalanguage L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which likewise is a sublanguage of L&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. The grammar of L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has the form of a metatheory describing the syntactic structure of theories stated in L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and succeeding metalanguages have the same grammar as L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, differing only in reference. Since all of these metalanguages are sublanguages of L&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a nested metalanguage, but L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and sequel are ordered metalanguages.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''. p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; Since all these metalanguages are sublanguages of L&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; they are all embedded languages with respect to the language as a whole.

Metalanguages of formal systems all resolve ultimately to natural language, the 'common parlance' in which mathematicians and logicians converse to define their terms and operations and 'read out' their formulae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Types of expressions ==
There are several entities commonly expressed in a metalanguage. In logic usually the object language that the metalanguage is discussing is a [[formal language]], and very often the metalanguage as well.

=== Deductive systems ===

{{Main|Deductive system}}

A '''deductive system''' (or, ''deductive apparatus'' of a [[formal system]]) consists of the [[axiom]]s (or [[axiom schema]]ta) and [[rules of inference]] that can be used to [[formal proof|derive]] the [[theorem]]s of the system.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Hunter (logician)|Hunter, Geoffrey]]. 1971. ''Metalogic: An Introduction to the Metatheory of Standard First-Order Logic''. Berkeley:University of California Press {{isbn|978-0-520-01822-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metavariables ===

{{Main|Metavariable (logic)}}

A '''metavariable''' (or ''metalinguistic'' or ''metasyntactic'' variable) is a [[symbol (formal)|symbol]] or set of symbols in a metalanguage which stands for a symbol or set of symbols in some object language. For instance, in the sentence:

:Let ''A'' and ''B'' be arbitrary [[well-formed formula|formula]]s of a [[formal language]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;.

The symbols ''A'' and ''B'' are not symbols of the object language &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;, they are metavariables in the metalanguage (in this case, English) that is discussing the object language &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Metatheories and metatheorems ===
{{Main|Metatheory|Metatheorem}}
A ''metatheory'' is a [[theory]] whose subject matter is some other theory (a theory about a theory). [[Statement (logic)|Statements]] made in the metatheory about the theory are called [[metatheorem]]s. A '''metatheorem''' is a [[truth|true]] statement about a [[formal system]] expressed in a metalanguage. Unlike theorems proved within a given formal system, a metatheorem is proved within a [[metatheory]], and may reference concepts that are present in the [[metatheory]] but not the [[object theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[[George Ritzer|Ritzer, George]]. 1991. ''Metatheorizing in Sociology''. New York: Simon Schuster {{isbn|0-669-25008-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interpretations ===

{{Main|Interpretation (logic)}}

An '''interpretation''' is an [[Valuation (logic)|assignment]] of meanings to the [[symbol (formal)|symbols]] and [[word]]s of a language.

== Role in metaphor ==

Michael J. Reddy (1979) argues that much of the language we use to talk about language is conceptualized and structured by what he refers to as the [[conduit metaphor]].&lt;ref&gt;Reddy, Michael J. 1979. The conduit metaphor: A case of frame conflict in our language about language. In  Andrew Ortony (ed.), ''Metaphor and Thought''. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; This paradigm operates through two distinct, related frameworks.

The ''major framework'' views language as a sealed pipeline between people:&lt;br /&gt;
'''1.''' Language transfers people's thoughts and feelings ([[mental content]]) to others
   ''ex:'' Try to get your thoughts across better.
'''2.''' Speakers and writers insert their mental content into words
   ''ex:'' You have to put each concept into words more carefully.
'''3.''' Words are containers
   ''ex:'' That sentence was filled with emotion.
'''4.''' Listeners and writers extract mental content from words
   ''ex:'' Let me know if you find any new sensations in the poem.

The ''minor framework'' views language as an open pipe spilling mental content into the void:&lt;br /&gt;
'''1.''' Speakers and writers eject mental content into an external space
   ''ex:'' Get those ideas out where they can do some good.
'''2.''' Mental content is reified (viewed as concrete) in this space
   ''ex:'' That concept has been floating around for decades.
'''3.''' Listeners and writers extract mental content from this space
   ''ex:'' Let me know if you find any good concepts in the essay.

== Metaprogramming ==

Computers follow programs, sets of instructions in a formal language.  The development of a [[programming language]] involves the use of a metalanguage. The act of working with metalanguages in programming is known as ''[[metaprogramming]]''. [[Backus–Naur form]], developed in the 1960s by John Backus and Peter Naur, is one of the earliest metalanguages used in computing. Examples of modern-day programming languages which commonly find use in metaprogramming include [[ML (programming language)|ML]], [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[m4 (computer language)|m4]], and [[Yacc]].

The '''National Vocabulary Championship''' (NVC) was the first-ever U.S.-wide [[vocabulary]] competition for high school students created by [[Game Show Network|GSN]], in association with [[The Princeton Review]]. Thirty thousand high school students from across the United States participated in the inaugural year (2006-2007).

The NVC aimed to inspire students to expand their vocabularies and narrow the [[achievement gap]]. The program offered free educational resources, created spirited competition through testing and game play, and awarded more than $100,000 annually in college tuition and other prizes.

Fifty finalists nationally received a trip to the NVC Finals, where they competed to win $40,000 toward college tuition in the form of a [[529 plan]] and to be crowned the National Vocabulary Champion.

The host of the National Vocabulary Championship was GSN host [[Dylan Lane]].

The NVC was discontinued after the 2007-2008 academic and competition year due to changes in GSN policy and administration.

== How to Compete ==
The NVC was open to eligible high school students in the United States between the ages of 13 and 19 years old and in grades 9-12. [[Home schooling|Home-schooled]] students were also eligible to compete.

There were two ways to enter the competition:

Eligible students at participating schools in eight local markets could qualify to participate in a ''Citywide Championship'' for a chance to win $5,000 toward college tuition and other prizes, as well as a trip to the national finals.

Eligible students nationwide could also participate through a ''National Qualifying Competition'' via on-line and regional exams offered by The Princeton Review for a chance to compete in the NVC Finals.

==2007-2008 Citywide Championships==
Eight U.S. cities across the country were chosen each year to host Citywide Championship events. Eligible students who wanted to compete in one of the local Citywide Championships had to attend a participating high school, register with the designated NVC coach at their school, and take the NVC in-school qualifying exam. All public and private high schools within these markets and their surrounding areas were invited to participate and encourage their students to compete. Approximately 100 top scorers per market qualified to compete in each Citywide Championship, where one winner received $5,000 toward college tuition and other prizes as well as a trip to the national finals.

Below is a list of cities that the NVC visited in 2007-2008:
* Sacramento: Thursday, November 15 -- '''WINNER:''' Yvonne Lin (Sophomore) 
* Nashville: Tuesday, November 27 -- '''WINNER:''' Brian Swenson (Junior)
* St. Louis: Thursday, November 29  -- '''WINNER:''' Rajiv Tarigopula (Sophomore)
* Detroit: Monday, December 3 -- '''WINNER:''' Steven Banks (Senior)
* Northeast Ohio: Thursday, December 6 -- '''WINNER:''' Joel Fichter (Senior)
* New York: Monday, December 10 -- '''WINNER:''' Rebecca Maxfield (Junior)
* Pittsburgh: Monday, January 14 -- '''WINNER:''' John Oxenreiter (Senior)
* Philadelphia: Thursday, January 17 -- '''WINNER:''' Lauren Bezjak (Junior)

==National Qualifying Competition==
Eligible high school students who did not attend a participating school (listed under Citywide Championship) or who did not wish to take the in-school qualifying exam could compete in the National Qualifying Competition by following the below steps:
1) The NVC offered an online national qualifying exam during November 2007 at [http://www.winwithwords.com winwithwords.com]. For months leading up to the online exam, study tools and study modules were available at [http://www.winwithwords.com winwithwords.com]
Or:
2) Top-scoring students on the online national qualifying exam had an opportunity to advance to the regional exams, which took place at designated The Princeton Review locations across the country. Forty-two top scorers from the National Qualifying Competition joined the eight citywide champions at the national finals.

In [[language acquisition]], '''negative evidence''' is evidence concerning what is not possible in a language. There is debate among linguists whether negative evidence can help child language learners determine the [[grammar]] of their language by disconfirming incorrect hypotheses about how their language works. Importantly, negative evidence does not show what ''is'' grammatical, but helps eliminate ungrammatical constructions by revealing what is ''not'' grammatical. There are two main types of negative evidence in language acquisition: ''direct'' negative evidence and ''indirect'' negative evidence.

== Direct negative evidence ==
'''Direct negative evidence in language acquisition''' consists of utterances that indicate whether a construction in a language is [[Grammaticality|ungrammatical]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Direct negative evidence differs from indirect negative evidence because it is ''explicitly'' presented to a language learner (e.g. a child might be corrected by a parent). On the other hand, indirect negative evidence is used to determine ungrammatical constructions in a language by noticing the ''absence'' of such constructions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Direct negative evidence can be further divided into explicit and implicit forms. Explicit forms of evidence involve a parent telling their child that an utterance was incorrect and then supplying the correct version of that utterance. Implicit forms involve the repetition (or a modified repetition) of a child's ungrammatical utterance.

== Explicit direct negative evidence ==
A [[Corpus linguistics|corpus study]] found that explicit negative evidence was "very rare", and concluded that because parents do not reliably correct their children's grammatical errors, explicit negative evidence does not facilitate language learning.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Brown, R., &amp; Hanlon, C. (1970). Derivational complexity and order of acquisition on child speech. In J. Hayes (Ed.), Cognition and the developmenf of language (pp. 11-53). New York: Wiley.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;  Psychologist [[David McNeill]] argues that when parents correct children explicitly, the correction is unlikely to be helpful in learning grammar because it is a single correction that will most likely not be repeated, and therefore a child might not remember or even notice the correction.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This is demonstrated in the following exchange between a parent and child, which McNeill recorded:&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Child: Nobody don't like me.
:Mother: No, say, "nobody likes me."
:Child: Nobody don't like me.
:[This exchange is repeated several times]
:Mother: No, now listen carefully. Say, "Nobody likes me."
:Child: Oh! Nobody don't ''likes'' me.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;McNeill, D. (1966) Developmental Psycholinguistics. in&amp;nbsp; The Genesis of Language, F. Smith and G. Miller (eds). MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;As this conversation reveals, children are seemingly unable to detect differences between their ungrammatical sentences and the grammatical sentences that their parents produce. Therefore, children typically cannot use explicit negative evidence to learn that an aspect of grammar, such as using double negatives in English, is ungrammatical. This example also shows that children can make incorrect generalizations about which grammatical principle a parent corrects, suggesting that there must be something other than explicit feedback which drives children to arrive at a correct grammar.

== Implicit direct negative evidence ==
===In the input ===
Implicit direct negative evidence occurs when a parent responds to a child's ungrammatical utterance in a way that indicates that the utterance was not grammatical. This differs from explicit direct negative evidence because the parent merely implies that the child's utterance is ungrammatical, while explicit direct negative evidence involves a parent unambiguously telling a child that a sentence they produced is ungrammatical. There are several types of implicit direct negative evidence which parents utilize in responses to children's ungrammatical utterances.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; These forms include: repetitions, recasts, expansions, and requests for clarification.  Repetitions occur when a parent repeats a child's utterance word for word, whereas recasts occur when a parent repeats a child's utterance while correcting the ungrammatical part of the sentence.  Expansions are similar to recasts because they are potentially corrective utterances, but in expansions a parent also will lengthen the child's original utterance. Requests for clarification occur when a parent asks a question that can prompt a child to fix an ungrammatical sentence they previously said. Generally speaking, there is consensus that implicit direct negative evidence exists in the input, though there is debate about whether children can use implicit direct negative evidence to learn the grammar of their language. It is argued that parents frequently reformulate children's ungrammatical utterances.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Saxton, Matthew.&amp;nbsp;[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/014272370002006001 "Negative evidence and negative feedback: immediate effects on the grammaticality of child speech"].&amp;nbsp;''First Language''.&amp;nbsp;'''20'''&amp;nbsp;(60): 221–252.&amp;nbsp;[[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[https://doi.org/10.1177%2F014272370002006001 10.1177/014272370002006001].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utility===
Some types of implicit direct negative evidence, such as reformulations, occur regularly in the input, thus making them potentially usable forms of evidence. It is the presence of the reformulations, as well as the high percentage of correct parental speech, that allows children to learn.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Chouinard, Michelle M.; Clark, Eve V. (2003/08).&amp;nbsp;[https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-child-language/article/adult-reformulations-of-child-errors-as-negative-evidence/AC1DA451B23BDDCE589273617D8B4F4C "Adult reformulations of child errors as negative evidence"].&amp;nbsp;''Journal of Child Language''.&amp;nbsp;'''30'''&amp;nbsp;(3): 637–669.&amp;nbsp;[[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[https://doi.org/10.1017%2Fs0305000903005701 10.1017/s0305000903005701].&amp;nbsp;[[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]]&amp;nbsp;[https://www.worldcat.org/issn/1469-7602 1469-7602]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Snow, C.E.; Ferguson, C. A., eds. (1977).&amp;nbsp;''Talking to Children: language input and acquisition''. Cambridge Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have demonstrated that parents respond differently when children utter grammatical or ungrammatical utterances, and the researchers who conducted these studies believe that children can use this parental feedback to learn grammar because corrective and non-corrective parental feedback can be distinguished from each other.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Penner, Sharon (April 1987). "Parental Responses to Grammatical and Ungrammatical Child Utterances".&amp;nbsp;''Child Development''. 58, Issue 2: 376–385.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Some evidence also supports the hypothesis that children actually use implicit direct negative evidence in practice (see section below).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Though there have been a number of studies that support the hypothesis that children can use implicit direct negative evidence that exists in the input, there have also been studies which stand in stark contrast to this hypothesis.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Rhode, Douglas L.T.; Plaut, David C. (Spring 1999).&amp;nbsp;[https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0010027799000311/1-s2.0-S0010027799000311-main.pdf?_tid=eca927c4-be6c-11e7-a5a2-00000aab0f01&amp;acdnat=1509476249_3347feb9cae9a697da5b6075cb8de74a "Language acquisition in the absence of explicit negative evidence: how important is starting small?"]&amp;nbsp;(PDF).&amp;nbsp;''Cognition''.&amp;nbsp;'''72''': 67–109&lt;/ref&gt; Linguists who do not believe that implicit direct negative evidence is helpful for a language learner argue that studies supporting the utility of implicit direct negative evidence do not properly specify which types of utterances qualify as recasts. They criticize the fact that some types of implicit direct negative evidence are not necessarily corrective (i.e. parental responses that may qualify as implicit direct negative evidence can occur after either grammatical or ungrammatical utterances). Additionally, some of these linguists question how children would know to only pay attention to certain kinds of recasts and not others.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Furthermore, [[Gary Marcus]] argues that implicit direct negative evidence in the input is insufficient for children to learn the correct grammar of their language.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Marcus, G. F. (January 1993).&amp;nbsp;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8432090 "Negative evidence in language acquisition"].&amp;nbsp;''Cognition''.&amp;nbsp;'''46'''&amp;nbsp;(1): 53–85.&amp;nbsp;[[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]]&amp;nbsp;[https://www.worldcat.org/issn/0010-0277 0010-0277].&amp;nbsp;[[PubMed Identifier|PMID]]&amp;nbsp;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8432090 8432090].&lt;/ref&gt; He criticizes negative evidence because it does not explain why sentences are ungrammatical, thus making it difficult for children to learn what their correct grammar is. He also argues that for children to be able to even use implicit direct negative evidence, they would need to repeat a sentence 85 times and receive negative feedback in order to eliminate that sentence from their vocabulary. He then shows that children typically do not repeat ungrammatical utterances in such high quantities; therefore, language learners would not be able to benefit from implicit evidence. Marcus also purports that implicit evidence is largely unavailable because the feedback differs from parent to parent, and is inconsistent in both the frequency with which it is offered and the kinds of errors it corrects. Other studies demonstrate that implicit negative evidence decreases over time, so that as children get older there is less feedback, making it less available and, consequentially, less likely to be used in or account for children's unlearning of grammatical errors.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsh-Pasek, K., Treiman, R., &amp; Schneiderman, M. (1984). Brown and Hanlon revisited: Mothers’

sensitivity to ungrammatical forms. Journal of Child Language, 11, 81-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage===
Assuming that implicit direct negative evidence is usable, there are some studies which demonstrate that children do use implicit direct negative evidence to correct their grammatical mistakes.  For example, experiments show that children produce a greater number of grammatical sentences when parents provide them with any type of immediate implicit direct negative evidence, including recasts. This evidence supports claims that direct negative evidence assists a child in their language learning.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Chouinard also found that children are highly attentive to parental responses and that children respond to implicit correction in predictable ways.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Children tend to directly respond to these reformulations by either affirming the reformulation or disagreeing with their parent if the parent misunderstood the child's intended meaning, revealing that children can discern when parental feedback is meant to correct their grammatical errors. Additionally, children have been shown correct their initial errors when a parent recasts a child's morphological error.&lt;ref&gt;Farrar, Michael J.&amp;nbsp;[http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0012-1649.28.1.90 "Negative evidence and grammatical morpheme acquisition"].&amp;nbsp;''Developmental Psychology''.&amp;nbsp;'''28'''&amp;nbsp;(1): 90–98.&amp;nbsp;[[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[https://doi.org/10.1037%2F0012-1649.28.1.90 10.1037/0012-1649.28.1.90].&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other researchers have conducted studies that demonstrate that children do not ''need'' negative feedback in order to learn language.&lt;ref&gt;Bohannon, John N.; MacWhinney, Brian; Snow, Catherine.&amp;nbsp;[http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0012-1649.26.2.221 "No negative evidence revisited: Beyond learnability or who has to prove what to whom"].&amp;nbsp;''Developmental Psychology''.&amp;nbsp;'''26'''&amp;nbsp;(2): 221–226.&amp;nbsp;[[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[https://doi.org/10.1037%2F0012-1649.26.2.221 10.1037/0012-1649.26.2.221].&lt;/ref&gt; This is evidenced in a case study in which a mute child was tested to see whether he could comprehend a grammar even though he had received no corrective feedback (since corrective feedback occurs as a response to ungrammatical sentences that children produce). Though the child did not produce any speech and therefore did not receive any negative feedback, researchers found that he was able to learn grammatical rules. Although this study does not answer whether negative evidence can be helpful for learning language, it does suggest that direct negative evidence is not needed to learn grammar. Another study also demonstrates that implicit negative evidence is a negative predictor of the rate at which children eliminated ungrammatical utterances from their speech.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, J. L., Bonamo, K. M., &amp; Travis, L. L. (1995). Negative evidence on negative evidence.&amp;nbsp;''Developmental Psychology'',&amp;nbsp;''31''(2), 180-197. doi:10.1037/0012-1649.31.2.180&lt;/ref&gt;

== Direct negative evidence in language learning ==
Though there is no consensus regarding whether there is sufficient and usable implicit negative evidence in the input, if children ''are'' exposed to direct negative evidence, then they could use that evidence to validate hypotheses they have made about their grammar. On the other hand, if there is not sufficient usable negative evidence in the input, then there is a "no negative evidence" problem, which questions of how a language learner can learn language without negative evidence. This is a problem because if a child only hears grammatical sentences which are consistent with multiple grammars, then it would be impossible to determine which grammar is correct unless there was some other factor influencing what grammar a child ultimately hypothesizes to be correct.

Proponents of [[Psychological nativism#Language|linguistic nativism]] suggest that the answer to the "no negative evidence" problem is that language knowledge that cannot be learned is innate. They argue that the language input is not rich enough for children to develop a fully developed grammar from the input alone. This view is referred to as the&amp;nbsp;[[poverty of the stimulus]] argument. The central idea of the poverty of the stimulus argument is that children could have multiple hypotheses about aspects of their grammar which are distinguishable only by negative evidence (or by hearing ungrammatical sentences and recognizing those sentences as ungrammatical). Supporters of the poverty of the stimulus argument assert that because the negative evidence that is needed to learn language by the input alone does not exist, children cannot learn certain aspects of grammar from the input alone, and therefore there must be some aspects of grammar which involve innate mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Lasnik, Howard; Lidz, Jeffrey L. (2016-12-22).&amp;nbsp;[http://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199573776.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199573776-e-10 ''The Argument from the Poverty of the Stimulus''].&amp;nbsp;[[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[https://doi.org/10.1093%2Foxfordhb%2F9780199573776.013.10 10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199573776.013.10].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baker, C. L. (1979).&amp;nbsp;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4178133 "Syntactic Theory and the Projection Problem"].&amp;nbsp;''Linguistic Inquiry''.&amp;nbsp;'''10'''&amp;nbsp;(4): 533–581.&amp;nbsp;[[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[https://doi.org/10.2307%2F4178133 10.2307/4178133].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indirect negative evidence in language acquisition ==
'''Indirect negative evidence in language acquisition''' is information about the grammatical structure of their own language drawn from what the language learner does not hear in speech. Indirect negative evidence serves as a means for child language learners to constrain and refine hypotheses that they previously held about the structure of their language.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Child Language: Acquisition and Growth|last=Lust|first=Barbara|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521449227|pages=30–31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of indirect negative evidence ==
===General examples===
Indirect negative evidence can be used for more than just language learning. The calculation of probability based on observed occurrences, called [[Bayesian inference]], serves many purposes. For example, when we see a dog bark, we are likely to think that dogs bark, not that every kind of animal barks. This is because we have never seen horses or fish or any other animal bark, so our hypothesis becomes that only dogs bark.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Regier|first=Terry|last2=Gahl|first2=Susanne|title=Learning the unlearnable: the role of missing evidence|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2003.12.003|journal=Cognition|language=en|volume=93|issue=2|pages=147–155|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2003.12.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; We use this same inference to assume that the sun will rise tomorrow, having seen it rise every other day so far. No evidence received indicates that the sun may not rise once every two thousand years, or only rises on years that are not 2086, but since all evidence seen so far is consistent with the universal generalization, we infer that the sun does indeed rise every day.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Examples in language acquisition===
Regier &amp; Gahl argue that certain Poverty of the Stimulus problems could be overcome by using indirect negative evidence. For example, syntacticians argue that children could not learn that "one" is anaphoric to phrasal categories given that the evidence they are exposed to is equally consistent with "one" being anaphoric only to individual words. This is because the meanings produced by the phrasal hypothesis are a subset of those produced by the single word hypothesis. Children could thus use the fact that all of their data is consistent with both hypotheses as evidence in favor of the more restricted hypothesis.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==Utility of indirect negative evidence==
===Indirect negative evidence and word learning===
Child and adult speakers rely on 'suspicious coincidences' when learning a new word meaning.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xu|first1=Fei|last2=Tenebaum|first2=Joshua|title=Word Learning as Bayesian Inference|journal=Psychological Review|date=2007|volume=114|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.114.2.245}}&lt;/ref&gt; When learning a new word meaning, children and adults use only the first few instances of hearing that word in order to decide what it means, rapidly constricting their hypothesis if only used in a narrow context. In an experiment conducted by Xu and Tenebaum, 4-year-old participants learning a novel word 'fep' readily decided that it referred only to Dalmatians if only hearing it while shown pictures of Dalmatians; although they received no information that 'fep' was unable to refer to other kinds of dogs, the suspicious coincidence that they had never heard it in other contexts caused them to restrict their meaning to just one breed.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Child language learners can use this same type of probabilistic inference to decide when and how verbs can be used. A word children hear often, like 'disappear', is more likely to be used than a less common word with a similar meaning, 'vanish'. Children studied said that the ungrammatical sentence "*We want to disappear our heads" was ungrammatical, but when given the same sentence with vanish, they were less sure of the grammaticality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ambridge|first=Ben|last2=Pine|first2=J.M.|last3=Rowland|first3=C.F.|last4=Young|first4=C.R.|title=The effect of verb semantic class and verb frequency (entrenchment) on children’s and adults’ graded judgements of argument-structure overgeneralization errors.|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2006.12.015|journal=Cognition|language=en|volume=106|issue=1|pages=87–129|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2006.12.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the frequency of 'disappear' in intransitive clauses, learners could infer that if it were possible in transitive clauses, they would have heard it in those contexts. Thus, the high frequency of the intransitive use leads to the inference that the transitive is impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:468143/component/escidoc:532427/bowerman_1988_The-No.pdf|title=Explaining Language Universals|last=Bowerman|first=1988|publisher=Basil Blackwell|year=1988|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=73–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; This inference is less reliable with a less frequent verb like "vanish".

===Indirect negative evidence and syntax===
It has been argued that children use indirect negative evidence to make probabilistic inferences about the syntax of the language they are acquiring. A 2004 study by Regier &amp; Gahl produced a computational model which provides support for this argument.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; They assert that children can use the ''absence'' of particular patterns in the input in order to conclude that such patterns are illicit. According to Regier and Gahl, young language learners form hypotheses about what is and isn't correct based on probabilistic inferences. As children are exposed to more and more examples of a certain phenomenon, their hypothesis space narrows. Notably, Regier and Gahl assert that this ability for probabilistic inference can be used in all sorts of general learning tasks, and not just linguistic ones. Regier and Gahl also present their model as evidence against an argument from the poverty of the stimulus, because their model illustrates that syntactic learning is possible from using the input alone, and does not necessarily require some innate linguistic knowledge of syntax.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11621">'''Non-lexical [[vocable]]s''', which may be mixed with meaningful text, are a form of [[nonsense syllable]] used in a wide variety of music. A common English example would be "la la la", "na na na" or "da da da".

==Traditional music==
Non-lexical vocables are used in [[yodeling]], [[Blackfoot music]] and other [[Native American music]], [[Pygmy music]], the [[music of the Maldives]], [[Irish Music|Irish music]], and [[Music of Scotland|Highland Scots music]]. Vocables frequently act as formal markers, indicating the beginning and end of phrases, sections or songs themselves,&lt;ref&gt;Heth, cited in {{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also as onomatopoeic references, cueing devices, and other purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianencyclopedia.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0002542 "Native North Americans in Canada"], ''The Canadian Encyclopedia Historica: Encyclopedia of Music in Canada''. Accessed 01/23/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Blackfeet|Blackfoot]], like other [[Plains Indians]], use the [[consonant]]s ''h'', ''y'', ''w'', and [[vowel]]s. They avoid ''n'', ''c'' (''ts'') and other consonants. ''i'' and ''e'' tend slightly to be higher [[pitch (music)|pitches]], ''a'', ''o'', and ''u'' lower ones.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nettl, Bruno]] (1989). ''Blackfoot Musical Thought: Comparative Perspectives'', p.71. Ohio: The Kent State University Press. {{ISBN|0-87338-370-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[AIM Song]] has its origins in the Plains; as such, it holds similar characteristics to Blackfoot song. It is intended as an intertribal song, so the use of non-lexical vocables prevents bias to one particular [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|language]].

Other traditional musical forms employing non-lexical vocables include:
* [[Puirt à beul]] (traditional Scottish and Irish song form that sometimes employs nonsense syllables)
* [[Nigun]] in Jewish religious music
* [[Joik]] or luohti (improvised [[Sami people|Sami]] chant employing nonsense syllables and few or no lyrics)

==Jazz music==
{{main|Scat singing}}
[[Scat singing]] is a type of voice instrumental music. A scat is vocalized using wordless vocables and syllables (e.g. "bippity-bippity-doo-wop-razzamatazz-skoobie-doobie-shoobity-bee-bop-a-lula-shabazz") as employed by jazz singers. Scat singing gives singers the ability to sing improvised melodies and rhythms, to create the equivalent of an instrumental solo using their voice. [[Scatman John]] (John Paul Larkin) renewed interest in the genre briefly during the mid-90s.

Vocal improviser [[Bobby McFerrin]]’s performances at major concert halls worldwide show that “wordless singing has traveled far from the concepts demonstrated by [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Gladys Bentley]], [[Cab Calloway]], [[Anita O’Day]], and [[Leo Watson]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crowther|Pinfold|1997|p=135}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method of scat singing is practiced by guitarists who scat along with their solos note for note.  Notable practitioners include [[George Benson]], [[Sheldon Reynolds (guitarist)|Sheldon Reynolds]], and [[Rik Emmett]].

==Vocal percussion==
Non-lexical vocables that take on percussive roles:
* [[Bol (music) | Tabla Bols]]
* [[Beatboxing]]
* [[Konnakol]]

==Musical training==
* [[Solfège]], or solfa, is a technique for teaching [[sight-singing]], in which each note is sung to a special syllable (do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti). 
* [[Canntaireachd]] is an ancient Scottish practice of noting music with a combination of definite syllables for ease of recollection and transmission.
* In India, the origin of [[solmization]] was to be found in [[Vedic]] texts like the [[Upanishads]], which discuss a musical system of seven notes, realized ultimately in what is known as [[Swara|sargam]]. In [[Indian classical music]], the notes in order are: sa, re, ga, ma, pa, dha, and ni.
* [[Byzantine music]] also uses syllables derived from a hymn to name notes: starting with A, the notes are pa, vu, ga, di, ke, zo, ni.
* In Japan, the [[Iroha]], an ancient poem, is sometimes used as solfège (i, chi, yo, ra, ya, a, we).

==Popular music of the WWII era==
The song "[[Swinging the Alphabet]]" is sung by The Three Stooges in their short film ''[[Violent Is the Word for Curly]]'' (1938).  It is the only full-length song performed by the Stooges in their short films, and the only time they mimed to their own pre-recorded soundtrack.  The lyrics use each letter of the alphabet to make a nonsense verse of the song:
  B-A-bay, B-E-bee, B-I-bicky-bi, B-O bo, bicky-bi bo, B-U bu, bicky bi bo bu.
  C-A-cay, C-E-cee, C-I-cicky-ci, C-O co, cicky-ci co, C-U cu, cicky ci co cu.
  D-A-day, D-E-dee, D-I-dicky-di, D-O do, dicky-di do, D-U du, dicky di do du.
  F-A-fay, F-E-fee, F-I-ficky-fi, F-O fo, Ficky-fi fo, F-U fu, ficky fi fo fu.
  ...

The song "[[Mairzy Doats]]" (1943) used blurred lyrics that sound non-lexical:
  Mairzy doats and dozy doats and liddle lamzy divey
  A kiddley divey too, wouldn't you?
However, the lyrics of the bridge provide a clue:
  If the words sound queer and funny to your ear, a little bit jumbled and jivey,
  Sing "Mares eat oats and does eat oats and little lambs eat ivy."

==Popular music==
Examples of popular music employing non-lexical vocables include:
* [[A cappella]] (singing without instrumental accompaniment, sometimes accompanied by a chorus of nonsense syllables)
* [[Doo-wop]] (style of rhythm and blues music that often employs nonsense syllables)
* [[Kobaïan]] (language used by French progressive rock band [[Magma (band)|Magma]])
* [[Sigur Rós#Vonlenska|Vonlenska]], also called ''Hopelandic'', (gibberish language employed by the Icelandic post-rock band [[Sigur Rós]])

Jack Black uses non-lexical vocables whilst singing as Tenacious D

[[Van Morrison]] employed scat in his performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|contribution=Jim Morrison|title=Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll|editor-last=Pareles|editor-first=Jon|editor-link=Jon Pareles|editor2-last=Romanowski|editor2-first=Patricia|editor3-last=George-Warren|editor3-first=Holly|year=2001|publisher=Fireside|place=|isbn=978-0-7432-0120-9|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/van-morrison/biography|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scat singing]] influenced the development of [[doo-wop]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]]. It was popular enough in doo-wop that [[Barry Mann]] and [[Gerry Goffin]] made it the subject of a 1961 song, [[Who Put the Bomp (in the Bomp, Bomp, Bomp)]]". It has also appeared in various genres of [[rock music]]. [[Jim Morrison]] of [[The Doors]] sings a chorus of slow scat on the song "Cars Hiss By My Window", trying to replicate a harmonica solo he had heard, as well as on the song "[[Roadhouse Blues]]"; scat singing also notably opens the [[B-side]] of [[Joe Walsh]]'s 1973 album ''[[The Smoker You Drink, The Player You Get]]'' with the song "Meadow".  The technique was employed in the song "[[The Great Gig in the Sky]]" by [[Pink Floyd]], as well as the R&amp;B song "[[Rubber Biscuit]]" by [[The Chips]] (also as by [[The Blues Brothers]]).  The [[list of scat singers]] includes such greats as [[Jelly Roll Morton]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Cab Calloway]], [[Scatman Crothers]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Sarah Vaughan]], [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[Mel Tormé]], [[Tony Bennett]], [[Cleo Laine]], [[Roger Miller]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Van Morrison]], and the [[Pointer Sisters]].

Scatting also makes appearances in newer genres, including [[industrial music]], in the chorus of [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]]'s 1991 song "[[Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs|Jesus Built My Hotrod]]"; [[nu metal]] music, in the band [[Korn (band)|Korn]] (whose lead singer [[Jonathan Davis]] has incorporated scat singing into songs such as "Twist", "[[Ball Tongue]]", "[[Freak on a Leash]]", "[[B.B.K. (song)|B.B.K.]]", "Beat it Upright", "Liar", and "[[Rotting in Vain]]"); and the heavy metal subgenre of [[death metal]], where scat singing is used by [[John Tardy]] of the band [[Obituary (band)|Obituary]]. [[Jack Black]] incorporates scat into several [[Tenacious D]] songs, most notably: "[[Tribute (song)|Tribute]]", "Cosmic Shame", "Classico," "Jesus Ranch," Low Hangin' Fruit," and "Bowie". Singer [[JoJo (singer)|JoJo]] performs ad-libbed scats on the track "Yes or No". Other modern examples include "Under Pressure" by [[Queen (band)]], "Rag Doll" by [[Aerosmith]], "Under My Voodoo" by [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]], "No! Don't Shoot" by [[Foxy Shazam]], "Ma Meeshka Mow Skwoz" by [[Mr. Bungle]], "In My Bed" by [[Amy Winehouse]], and "Stuck in the Middle" by [[Mika (singer)|Mika]]. [[Scatman John]] combined scat and early-1990s [[electronic dance music]].

Examples by popular non-[[English-speaking|anglophone]] singers using such techniques include "[[Bla Bla Bla]]" by [[Gigi D'Agostino]], "Eena Mina Dika" in the Bollywood film ''[[Aasha (1957 film)|Aasha]]'', [[Eduard Khil]]'s "I Am Glad, Cause I'm Finally Returning Back Home" (known as "[[Trololo]]") sung entirely without lyrics, "[[Fuzao]]" by [[Faye Wong]], "[[Alive (Sa Dingding album)|Lagu Lagu]]" by [[Sa Dingding]] and "[[Din Daa Daa]]" by [[George Kranz]].

Due to the wide-ranging vocal styles used in popular music, occasionally songs have been mistakenly categorized as having non-lexical vocables, when in fact the singers are performing actual lyrics rendered partially (or completely) unintelligible to the ear of some (but not all) listeners. Two famous 1960s examples are "[[Louie Louie]]" as recorded by [[The Kingsmen]] and "[[Wooly Bully]]" by [[Sam the Sham|Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs]].

==Disney songs==
A signature of some [[Disney]] [[musical film]]s is their songs' use of [[nonsense word]]s, the longest and most famous of which is from ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', entitled  "[[Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious]]".  A close second is "[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]" from ''[[Song of the South]]'', which won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]]. Nonsense word song titles include:
*"[[Heigh-Ho]]" from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''  (1937)
*"[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]" from ''[[Song of the South]]''  (1946)
*"[[Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo]]" from ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''  (1950)
*"[[Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious]]" and "[[Chim Chim Cher-ee]]" from ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]''  (1964)
*"[[Substitutiary Locomotion]]" from ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'' (1971), which includes the incantation "Treguna Mekoides and Tracorum Satis Dee"
*"Whistle-Stop" from [[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]] (1973)
*"[[Whoop-de-Dooper Bounce]]" from ''[[The Tigger Movie]]'' (2000)

Nonsense lyrics also feature in the following Disney songs:
*"[[I Wanna Be Like You]]" from ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' features a segment of improvisational nonsense words.
*"Trashing the Camp" from ''[[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]]'' also contains a segment of improvisational nonsense words.
*"[[Everybody Wants to Be a Cat]]" from ''[[The Aristocats]]'', sung by [[Scatman Crothers]] as "Scat Cat", contains lengthy scat sequences.

An '''object language''' is a [[language]] which is the "object" of study in various fields including [[logic]], [[linguistics]], [[mathematics]], and [[theoretical computer science]].  The language being used to talk about an object language is called a [[metalanguage]].  An object language may be a [[formal language|formal]] or [[natural language|natural]] language.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

== Forms of object language ==
=== Formal languages ===

[[Mathematical logic]] and [[linguistics]] make use of metalanguages, which are languages for describing the nature of other languages. In mathematical logic, the object language is usually a [[formal language]]. The language which a metalanguage is used to describe is the object language. It is called that because that language is the object under discussion using the metalanguage.

For instance, someone who says "In French, you say ''Bonjour'' to greet someone" uses [[English language|English]] as a metalanguage to describe the object language [[French language|French]].

=== Computer languages ===

There are two ways the term ''object language'' can be used in computing: a language which is the object of formal specification, and a language which is the object (goal) of a compiler or interpreter.

==== Formal specification ====

{{Main|Specification language}}

Computer languages are object languages of the metalanguage in which their [[specification]] is written. In computer science this is referred to as the [[specification language]]. [[Backus–Naur form]] was one of the earliest used specification languages.

When [[compiler]]s are written using systems like [[lex (software)|lex]] and [[yacc]], the rules the programmer writes look much like a formal specification, but it is considered an [[implementation]] instead. Many [[programming language implementation]]s are not strictly the same as their specifications, adding features or making implementation-dependent design decisions.

==== Object Code ====

{{Main|Object file}}

At their basic level, computers act on what is given to them through a limited set of instructions which are understood by their [[CPU]]s. In the earliest computers, that meant programmers sometimes composed actual 1's and 0's to program. Since this requires considerable programmer training (and patience) to create instructions, later computer languages have gone to great lengths to simplify the programmer's task. For example, a high level programming language may allow a programmer to assign a value to a variable without specifying a memory location or a CPU instruction.

In this context, the high level programming language is the ''source language'', which is then translated by a [[compiler]] into [[object code]] that the CPU can read directly. This object code is the ''object language'', and varies depending on what CPU is being given the instructions.

''Object language'' in this context means something akin to "the object of what the programmer is trying to achieve". If the source language and object languages are viewed as formal (logical) languages, what the compiler does is ''interpret'' the source into the target language (this is different from the computer science use of ''[[interpreted language]]'' meaning one which is ''not'' compiled).

''Object language'' in this context is synonymous with ''target language''.  The object language of a translation most often is a [[machine language]], but can be some other kind of language, such as [[assembly language]].

Because the object language of compilation has usually been machine language, the term ''[[object file]]'' has come to mean a file containing machine instructions, and sometimes the translated program itself is simply called an ''object''.

''Object language'' should also not be confused with ''[[object-oriented language]]'', which is a type of computer [[programming language]] which changes the programmer's environment into convenient objects which can be used in something similar to a drag-and-drop fashion.

== Expressions in an object language ==
=== Symbols ===
{{Main|Symbol (formal)}}

A ''symbol'' is an [[idea]], [[abstraction]] or [[concept]], [[type-token distinction|token]]s of which may be marks or a configuration of marks which form a particular pattern. Although the term "symbol" in common use refers at some times to the idea being symbolized, and at other times to the marks on a piece of paper or chalkboard which are being used to express that idea; in the [[formal language]]s studied in [[mathematics]] and [[logic]], the term "symbol" refers to the idea, and the marks are considered to be a [[type-token distinction|token]] instance of the symbol.

=== Formulas ===
{{Main|Well-formed formula}}

In the formal languages used in mathematical logic and computer science, a ''well-formed formula'' or simply ''formula'' is an [[idea]], [[abstraction]] or [[concept]] which is expressed using the [[symbol (formal)|symbol]]s and [[formation rule]]s (also called the [[formal grammar]]) of a particular formal language. To say that a [[string (computer science)|string]] of symbols &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a well-formed formula with respect to a given formal grammar &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to saying that &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; belongs to the language generated by &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Formal systems ===
{{Main|Formal system}}

A ''formal system'' is a [[formal language]] together with a [[deductive system]] which consists of a set of [[inference rule]]s and/or [[axiom]]s. A formal system is used to [[formal proof|derive]] one expression from one or more other expressions previously expressed in the system. These expressions are called [[axiom]]s, in the case of those previously supposed to be true, or [[theorem]]s, in the case of those derived. A formal system may be formulated and studied for its intrinsic properties, or it may be intended as a description (i.e. a [[Interpretation (logic)|model]]) of external phenomena.

=== Theorems ===
{{Main|Theorem}}

A ''theorem'' is a [[symbol (formal)|symbol]] or string of symbols which is [[formal proof|derived]] by using a [[formal system]]. The string of symbols is a [[logical consequence]] of the [[axiom]]s and [[rule of inference|rules]] of the system.

=== Formal proofs ===
{{Main|Formal proof}}

A ''formal proof'' or ''derivation'' is a finite sequence of [[proposition]]s (called [[well-formed formula]]s in the case of a [[formal language]]) each of which is an [[axiom]] or follows from the preceding sentences in the sequence by a [[rule of inference]]. The last sentence in the sequence is a [[theorem]] of a [[formal system]]. The concept of [[natural deduction]] is a [[generalization]] of the concept of proof.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy]], ''deduction''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theories ===
{{Main|Theory (mathematical logic)}}

A ''theory'' is a set of [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentence]]s in a [[formal language]].

A '''phememe''' (from Ancient Greek [[wikt:φημί]] ‘I speak, say’) is a hypothesized [[speech sound]] with an abstract [[gesture|gestural]] meaning, proposed by the linguist [[Mary LeCron Foster]]. (The term ''phememe'' appeared earlier in the works of [[Leonard Bloomfield]], who defined it as a "smallest and meaningless unit of linguistic signaling" – either a [[phoneme]] or a [[taxeme]].&lt;ref&gt;Bloomfield, Leonard (1933), ''Language'', New York: Henry Holt, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;)

According to Foster, phememes were the fundamental building block of the earliest human spoken language (Primordial Language), as opposed to the [[phoneme]]s of attested languages, contemporary or historical. The phememe concept is thus important in the debate regarding the gestural [[origin of speech]]. By way of an example, the sound [m], as a meaningful oral gesture, is understood as pointing to “two opposed surfaces in tapering, pressing together, holding together, crushing, or resting against”.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Mary LeCron. 1978. The symbolic structure of primordial language. In Sherwood L. Washburn and Elizabeth R. McCown (eds.) ''Human Evolution: Biosocial Perspectives'', 77–121. Menlo Park, CA: Benjamin/Cummings.&lt;/ref&gt; Reflexes of this primordial [m], and its original meaning, are found in ostensibly unrelated present-day languages in words referring to the mouth, the female genitals, and semantic extensions of these, e.g. Latin ''mugio'' ‘to moo, bugle’, ''mutus'' ‘mute’, ''mucus'' ‘mucous’, Japanese ''mugon'' ‘silence, muteness’, Dravidian ''muka-'' ‘face, mouth’, Piro (Arawak) ''musi-'' ‘to be pregnant, impregnate’.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Mary LeCron. 1990. The Birth and Life of Signs. In Mary LeCron Foster and Lucy Botscharow (eds.) ''The Life of Symbols'', 285–306. Boulder, CO: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt; According to her most recent published work,&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Mary LeCron. 1996. The reconstruction of the evolution of human spoken language. In Andre Lock and Charles R. Peters (eds.) ''Handbook of Human Symbolic Evolution'', 747–775. Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Foster proposes that the phememic system of primordial spoken language consisted of the following phememes.

The philosopher Maxine Sheets-Johnstone makes extensive use of Foster’s concept of the phememe in arguing [[iconicity]] to be the foundation of the symbolic process.&lt;ref&gt;Sheets-Johnstone, Maxine. 1999. Sensory-kinetic Understandings of Language: An Inquiry into Origins. ''Evolution of Communication'' 3 (2): 149–183.&lt;/ref&gt; Earl R. Anderson&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Earl R. 1998. ''A Grammar of Iconism''. Cranbury, NJ: Associated University Presses. Pp. 63f.&lt;/ref&gt; points out that the phememe is thus an elaboration of earlier theories postulating a role for oral gesture in the origin of spoken language, such as those of the naturalist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]]&lt;ref&gt;The Expressiveness of Speech, or, Mouth-Gesture as a Factor in the Origin of Language. ''Fortnightly Review'' 64: 528–543.&lt;/ref&gt; and the anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor]],&lt;ref&gt;Tylor, Edward Burnett. 2010 [1871]. ''Primitive Culture: Researches into the Development of Mythology, Philosophy, Religion, Art, and Custom''. 2 volumes. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; who called his method ''generative philology''. An implication of the phememe hypothesis is that Primordial Language lacked [[double articulation]], which the American linguist [[Charles F. Hockett]] proposed as a central design feature of human language. According to this principle, linguistic signs are made up of building blocks, such as [[phoneme]]s, which are themselves meaningless, e.g. ''cat'' is composed of the phonemes /k/, /æ/ and /t/. Phememes came to be desemanticized and replaced by meaningless phonemes in later evolution. The anthropologist Gordon Hewes proposes that this shift was motivated by the advantages phonemes entail in rapid word retrieval.&lt;ref&gt;Hewes, Gordon W. 1983.

In [[mathematics]], [[semantics]], and [[philosophy of language]], the '''principle of compositionality''' is the principle that the meaning of a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its constituent expressions and the rules used to combine them. This principle is also called '''Frege's principle''', because [[Gottlob Frege]] is widely credited for the first modern formulation of it. However, the idea appears already among [[India]]n philosophers of grammar such as [[Yaska|Yāska]], and also in [[Plato]]'s work such as in ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}
Besides, the principle was never explicitly stated by Frege,&lt;ref&gt;Pelletier, Francis Jeffry. 2001. Did Frege believe Frege’s principle? ''Journal of Logic, Language, and Information'' 10:87–114.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was arguably already assumed by [[George Boole]]&lt;ref&gt;Boole, G. (1854). ''An investigation of the laws of thought: on which are founded the mathematical theories of logic and probabilities''. Walton and Maberly.&lt;/ref&gt; decades before Frege’s work.

==Overview==
The principle of compositionality states that in a meaningful sentence, if the [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] parts are taken out of the sentence, what remains will be the rules of composition. Take, for example, the sentence "Socrates was a man". Once the meaningful lexical items are taken away—"Socrates" and "man"—what is left is the pseudo-sentence, "S was a M". The task becomes a matter of describing what the connection is between S and M.

It is frequently taken to mean that every operation of the [[syntax]] should be associated with an operation of the semantics that acts on the meanings of the constituents combined by the syntactic operation. As a guideline for constructing semantic theories, this is generally taken, as in the influential work on the philosophy of language by [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], to mean that every construct of the syntax should be associated by a clause of the [[T-schema]] with an operator in the semantics that specifies how the meaning of the whole expression is built from constituents combined by the syntactic rule. In some general mathematical theories (especially those in the tradition of [[Montague grammar]]), this guideline is taken to mean that the interpretation of a language is essentially given by a [[homomorphism]] between an algebra of syntactic representations and an algebra of semantic objects.

The principle of compositionality also exists in a similar form in the [[Denotational semantics#Compositionality|compositionality of programming languages]].

== Critiques ==

The principle of compositionality has been the subject of intense debate. Indeed, there is no general agreement as to how the principle is to be interpreted, although there have been several attempts to provide formal definitions of it. (Szabó, 2012)

Scholars are also divided as to whether the principle should be regarded as a factual claim, open to [[empirical]] testing; an [[Logical truth|analytic truth]], obvious from the nature of language and meaning; or a [[methodology|methodological]] principle to guide the development of theories of syntax and semantics. The Principle of Compositionality has been attacked in all three spheres, although so far none of the criticisms brought against it have been generally regarded as compelling. Most proponents of the principle, however, make certain exceptions for [[idiomatic]] expressions in natural language. (Szabó, 2012)

Further, in the context of the philosophy of language, the principle of compositionality does not explain all of meaning. For example, you cannot infer [[sarcasm]] purely on the basis of words and their composition, yet a phrase used sarcastically means something completely different from the same phrase uttered straightforwardly. Thus, some theorists argue that the principle has to be revised to take into account linguistic and extralinguistic [[Context principle|context]], which includes the tone of voice used, common ground between the speakers, the intentions of the speaker, and so on. (Szabó, 2012)

'''''Protologism''''' is a term invented in the early 2000s{{refn|For the earliest date of the use of the word ''protologism'', {{harvtxt|Maxwell|2014}} and {{harvtxt|Miller|2014|p=x}} indicate 2005; {{harvtxt|Eismann|2015|p=1756}} and {{harvtxt|Epstein|2011|p=19}} indicate 2003.}} by [[Mikhail Epstein]], an American [[literary theorist]], to refer to a new [[word]] which has not gained wide acceptance in the language.{{refn|name=Humez}}{{refn|name=Moore}}

==Overview==
The word ''protologism'' describes one stage in the development of [[neologism]]s, at which a word is proposed, extremely new, or not established outside a very limited group of people.{{refn|name=Gryniuk}}{{refn|name=Aitken}} A protologism is coined to fill a gap in the language, with the hope of it becoming an accepted word.{{refn|name=Eismann}}{{refn|name=Maxwell}} The term ''protologism'' is [[autological]]; it is an example of the thing it describes.{{refn|{{harvtxt|Maxwell|2014}} writes, "In other words, the term ''protologism'' is a protologism. This phenomenon, where a word itself possesses the property it refers to, is technically described as being ''autological''". {{harvtxt|Aitken|2013|p=316}}, {{harvtxt|Humez|Humez|Flynn|2010|p=36}}, and {{harvtxt|Moore|2011}}, on the other hand, each describe ''protologism'' as a [[neologism]].}} Epstein coined the term by combining the Greek words ''{{lang|grc|[[Wiktionary:protos|protos]]}}'' and ''{{lang|grc|[[logos]]}}'':

{{quote|I suggest calling such brand new words 'protologisms' (from Greek ''protos'', meaning 'first, original' and Greek ''logos'', meaning 'word'; cf. ''prototype'', ''protoplasm''). The protologism is a freshly minted word not yet widely accepted. It is a verbal prototype, which may eventually be adopted for public service or remain a whim of linguo-poetic imagination.{{sfnp|Epstein|2012|p=101}}}}

According to Epstein, every word in use started out as a protologism, subsequently became a neologism, and then gradually grew to be part of the language.{{sfnp|Epstein|2012|p=101}} There is no fixed rule determining when a protologism becomes a stable neologism.{{sfnp|Solnyshkina|2009|p=186}} According to Kerry Maxwell, author of ''Brave New Words'':

{{quote|[A] protologism is unlikely to make the leap to neologism status unless society connects with the word or identifies a genuine need for it [...] there's no guarantee that simple exposure to these creations will be effective in getting them used, as discovered by British inventor Sir James Dyson when he fruitlessly attempted to promote a verb ''dyson'' (by analogy with ''hoover'') in the early 2000s.{{sfnp|Maxwell|2014}}

== Notes ==
{{reflist|30em|refs=

{{Refn |name=Aitken |"Most of [Lewis] Carroll's words were not adopted into the language, but nonetheless, such literary invention will be familiar to anyone reading academic writers, where terms are created for conveying particular innovative concepts. Linguists even have a word for such terms, ''protologisms'' (itself a modern neologism), a word that is new and not yet established beyond a small group" {{harv|Aitken|2013|p=316}}.}}

{{Refn |name=Eismann |"Ėpštejn's projective dictionary should be a collection of protologisms, a protologism being a new word, coined to designate a new phenomenon or to fill in blank spaces and semantic voids in the lexical-conceptual system, as he proclaimed in 2003" {{harv|Eismann|2015|p=1756}}.}}

{{Refn |name=Gryniuk |"This process [of lexicalization] does not seem to be coincidental because neologisms themselves are prone to go through certain stages of transformation. They begin as ''unstable'' creations (otherwise called ''protologisms''), that is, they are extremely new, being proposed, or being used only by a small subculture" {{harv|Gryniuk|2015|p=150}}.}}

{{Refn |name=Humez |"One such neologism is the Wiktionary's ''protologism'', a term invented by Mikhail Epstein of Emory University to refer to a newly created and proposed word which has not yet gained acceptance" {{harv|Humez|Humez|Flynn|2010|p=36}}.}}

{{Refn |name=Maxwell |"The term ''protologism'' describes a word which has been coined in the 'hope' that it will become accepted into usage" {{harv|Maxwell|2014}}.}}


{{Refn |name=Moore |"Recognising the preliminary (or even want-to-be) nature of many neologisms, Mikhail N. Epstein the American literary theorist and thinker coined his own: ‘protologism’, which refers to a neologism that has not yet been accepted as a useful or substantiated addition to the vocabulary" {{harv|Moore|2011}}.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4764">The '''Reader's Digest National Word Power Challenge''' was an annual [[vocabulary]] competition in the [[United States]] for youth in sixth, seventh, or eighth grade.  It was sponsored by [[Reader's Digest]] magazine.

== Competition ==
=== Levels ===
==== School ====
Competition began at school level.  Typically, teachers gave students 25-question [[multiple choice|multiple-choice]] tests.  Classroom winners then competed with other classroom winners from the same grade to determine the school-wide grade-level champion.  The school champion then took a multiple-choice test which determined the top 100 students in the state.

==== State ====
The top 100 students were invited to a state competition, where they were given 25 multiple-choice questions to determine the top ten.  The top ten then went through a few rounds of questions to determine the state champion.  The state champion advanced to national competition.

==== National ====
Students from every state, Washington, D.C., and one student from a [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] school got to compete at national level.  The students took a 25-question multiple-choice test, with the top ten scorers going on to compete in a nationally televised event.  The moderator was a celebrity; [[Al Roker]] was a regular.

=== Prizes ===
* All students at the state level received treat bags.
* The top 10 students at the state level received Reader's Digest books.
* All students at the national level received treat bags.
* All state winners were offered free trips to the location of the national competition (usually Florida).
* [[Scholarship]]s were awarded at the national level:
** First place: $25,000
** Second place: $15,000
** Third place: $10,000

== Current status ==
In 2007, the RDNWPC website stated that the competition would not be held for the 2007-2008 year.  The Reader's Digest website no longer mentions the RDNWPC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rd.com/nwpc/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503022316/http://www.rd.com/nwpc/ |date=May 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speech consists of an organized set of sounds or phonemes that are used to convey meaning while language is an arbitrary association of symbols used according to prescribed rules to convey meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Bernthal, J.E., Bankson, N.W., &amp; Flipsen, P. (2009) Articulation and Phonological Disorders: Speech Sound Disorders in Children. (6th edition). Boston, MA: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;
While [[grammatical]] and [[syntactic]] learning can be seen as a part of [[language acquisition]], speech acquisition focuses on the development of [[speech perception]] and [[speech production]] over the first years of a child's lifetime.  There are several models to explain the norms of speech sound or phoneme acquisition in children.

== Development of speech perception ==
Sensory learning concerning acoustic speech signals already starts during pregnancy.  Hepper and Shahidullah (1992) described the progression of fetal response to different pure tone frequencies.  They suggested fetuses respond to 500 Hertz (Hz) at 19 weeks gestation, 250&amp;nbsp;Hz and 500&amp;nbsp;Hz at 27 weeks gestation and finally respond to 250, 500, 1000, 3000&amp;nbsp;Hz between 33 and 35 weeks gestation.&lt;ref&gt;Hepper, P. G., &amp; Shahidullah, B. S. (1994). Development of fetal hearing. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition, 71(2), F81–F87.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lanky and Williams (2005)&lt;ref&gt;Lasky, R.E. &amp; Trickey, A.W. (2005). The Development of the Auditory System from Conception to Term. NeoReviews 6(3). DOI: 10.1542/neo.6-3-e141.&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that fetuses could respond to pure tone stimuli of 500&amp;nbsp;Hz as early as 16 weeks.

The newborn is already capable of discerning many phonetic contrasts. This capability may be innate. 
Speech perception becomes language-specific for vowels at around 6 months, for sound combinations at around 9 months and for language-specific consonants at around 11 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nrn1533 |pmid=15496861 |title=Early language acquisition: Cracking the speech code |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=5 |issue=11 |pages=831–43 |year=2004 |last1=Kuhl |first1=Patricia K. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also important that a newborn is already capable of detecting typical word stress patterns around the age of 8 months.

As an infant grows into a child their ability to discriminate between speech sounds should increase.  Rvachew (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Rvachew, S. (2007). Phonological Processing and Reading in Children With Speech Sound Disorders. American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology. 16. 260-270. https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9b7e/1674775fc3775c9c1a1da4b57c1e0ed2e821.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; described three developmental stages in which a child recognizes or discerns adult-like, phonological and articulatory representations of sounds.In the first stage, the child is generally unaware of phonological contrast and can produce sounds that are acoustically and perceptually similar.  In the second stage the child is aware of phonological contrasts and can produce acoustically different variations imperceptible to adult listeners. Finally, in the third stage, children become aware of phonological contrasts and produce different sounds that are perceptually and acoustically accurate to an adult production.

It is suggested that a child's perceptual capabilities continue to develop for many years. Hazan and Barrett (2000)&lt;ref&gt;Hazan, V. &amp; Barrett, S.(2000) Development of phonemic categorization in children aged 6-12. Journal of Phonetics 28(4):377-396 · https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222834995_The_development_of_phonemic_categorization_in_children_aged_6-12&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that this development can cotton into late childhood; 6 to 12 year old children showed increasing mastery of discriminating synthesized differences in place, manner, and voicing of speech sounds with out yet achieving adult-like accuracy in their own production.

== Typologies of infant vocalization==

Infants are born with the ability to vocalize, most notably through crying.  As they grow and develop, infants add more sounds to their inventory. 
There are two primary typologies of infant vocalizations. Typology 1: Stark Assessment of Early Vocal Development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/02699200500211451 |pmid=16728333 |pmc=3412408 |title=Assessing vocal development in infants and toddlers |journal=Clinical Linguistics &amp; Phonetics |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=351–69 |year=2009 |last1=Nathani |first1=Suneeti |last2=Ertmer |first2=David J. |last3=Stark |first3=Rachel E. }}&lt;/ref&gt; consists of 5 phases. 
#Reflexive (0 to 2 months of age) consisting of crying, fussing, and vegetative sounds
#Control of phonation (1 to 4 months of age) consonant-like sounds, clicks, and raspberry sound
#Expansion (3 to 8 months of age) isolated vowels, two or more vowels in a row, and squeals
#Basic canonical syllables (5 to 10 months of age) – a consonant vowel (CV) combination, often repeated (e.g. ba ba ba ba).
#Advanced forms (9 to 18 months of age) complex combinations of differing constant-vowel combinations (CVC) and jargon.

Typology 2: Oller's typology of infant phonations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Oller |first1=J. W. |last2=Oller |first2=S. D. |last3=Badon |first3=L. C. |year=2006 |title=Milestones: Normal Speech and Language Development Across the Life Span |publisher=Plural Publishing |location=San Diego }}{{page needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; consists primarily of 2 phases with several substages.  The 2 primary phases include Non-speech-like vocalizations and Speech-like vocalizations.  Non-speech-like vocalizations include a. vegetative sounds such as burping and b. fixed vocal signals like crying or laughing.  Speech-like vocalizations consist of a. quasi-vowels, b. primitive articulation, c. expansion stage and d. canonical babbling.

== Speech sound normative data ==

Knowing when a speech sound should be accurately produced helps parents and professionals determine when child may have an articulation disorder. There have been two traditional methods used to compare a child's articulation of speech sounds to chronological age. The first is comparing the number of correct responses on a standardized articulation test with the normative data for a given age on the same test.  This allows evaluators to see how well a child is producing sounds compared to their same aged peers.  The second method consists of comparing an individual sound a child produces with developmental norms for that individual sound. The second method can be difficult when considering the differing normative data and other factors that affect typical speech development. 
Many norms are based on age expectations in which a majority of children of a certain age are accurately producing a sound (75% or 90% depending on the study). Using the results from Sander (1972),&lt;ref&gt;Sander, E. K. (1972). When are speech sounds learned? Journal of Speech and Hearing Disorders, 37(1), 55–63.&lt;/ref&gt;  Templin (1957),&lt;ref&gt;Templin, M. (1957). Certain language skills in children: Their development and interrelationships. Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  and Wellman, Case, Mengert, &amp; Bradbury, (1931),&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, B., Case, I., Mengert, I., &amp; Bradbury, D. (1931). Speech sounds of young children. University of Iowa Study, Child Welfare, 5(2), 1–82.&lt;/ref&gt; the American Speech-Language Hearing Association suggests the following: Sounds mastered by age 3 include /p, m, h, n, w, b/; by age 4 /k, g, d, f, y/; by age 6 /t, ŋ, r, l/; by age 7 /tʃ, ʃ, j, θ/. and by age 8 /s, z, v, ð, ʒ/.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/ASHA/Practice_Portal/Clinical_Topics/Late_Language_Emergence/Consonant-Acquisition-Chart.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early, Middle, and Late 8s===

Shriberg (1993)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1044/jshr.3601.105 |pmid=8450654 |title=Four New Speech and Prosody-Voice Measures for Genetics Research and Other Studies in Developmental Phonological Disorders |journal=Journal of Speech Language and Hearing Research |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=105–40 |year=1993 |last1=Shriberg |first1=Lawrence D. }}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a model for speech sound acquisition known as the Early, Middle, and Late 8 based on 64 children with speech delays ages 3 to 6 years. Shriberg proposed that there were three stages of phoneme development. Using a profile of "consonant mastery" he developed the following:

* Early 8 – /m, b, j, n, w, d, p, h/
* Middle 8 – /t, ŋ, k, g, f, v, tʃ, dʒ/
* Late 8 – /ʃ, θ, s, z, ð, l, r, ʒ/

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33940">'''Syntactic bootstrapping''' is a theory in developmental psycholinguistics and language acquistion which proposes that children learn word meanings by recognizing syntactic categories (such as nouns, adjectives, etc.) and the structure of their language. It is proposed that children have innate knowledge of the links between syntactic and [[Semantics|semantic]] categories and can use these observations to make inferences about word meaning. Learning words in one's native language can be challenging because the extralinguistic context of use does not give specific enough information about word meanings.&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gleitman|first=Lila R.|last2=Cassidy|first2=Kimberly|last3=Nappa|first3=Rebecca|last4=Papafragou|first4=Anna|last5=Trueswell|first5=John C.|date=2005-01-01|title=Hard Words|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15473341lld0101_4|journal=Language Learning and Development|volume=1|issue=1|pages=23–64|doi=10.1207/s15473341lld0101_4|issn=1547-5441}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in addition to extralinguistic cues, conclusions about syntactic categories are made &lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gleitman|first=Lila R.|year=1990|title=The Structural Sources of Verb Meaning.|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED335884|journal=Language Acquisition|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=3–55|via=|doi=10.1207/s15327817la0101_2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which then lead to inferences about a word's meaning. This theory aims to explain the acquisition of lexical categories such as verbs, nouns, etc. and functional categories such as case markers, determiners, etc.

==History==

One of the earliest demonstrations of the existence of syntactic bootstrapping is an experiment done by [[Roger Brown (psychologist)|Roger Brown]] at [[Harvard University]] in 1957.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Roger W.|title=Linguistic determinism and the part of speech.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/h0041199|journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|volume=55|issue=1|pages=1–5|doi=10.1037/h0041199|year=1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his research, Brown demonstrated that preschool-aged children could use their knowledge of different parts of speech to distinguish the meaning of nonsense words in English. The results of Brown’s experiment provided the first evidence showing that children could use syntax to infer meaning for newly encountered words and that they acquired grammar and semantics simultaneously. Brown's experiment was the beginning of the framework needed in order for the theory to thrive.

This led developmental psycholinguists like [[Lila R. Gleitman|Lila Gleitman]], who coined the term syntactic bootstrapping in 1990,&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; to argue that syntax was pivotal for language learning, as it also gives a learner clues about [[semantics]]. According to Gleitman's hypothesis, verbs are learned with a delay compared to other parts of speech because the linguistic information that supports their acquisition is not available during the early stages of language acquisition.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The acquisition of verb meaning in children is pivotal to their language development. Syntactic bootstrapping seeks to explain how children acquire these words.

== Logic and evidence ==
The syntactic bootstrapping hypothesis is based on the idea that there are universal/innate links between syntactic categories and semantic categories. Learners can therefore use their observations about the syntactic categories of novel words to make inferences about their meanings. This hypothesis is intended to solve the problem that the extralinguistic context is uninformative by itself to make conclusions about a novel word's meaning.

For example, a child hears the sentence, “The cat meeped the bird.” If the child is familiar with the way arguments of verbs interact with the verb, he will infer that "the cat" is the agent and that "the bird" is the patient. Then, he can use these syntactic observations to infer that "meep" is a behaviour that the cat is doing to the bird.

Children's ability to identify syntactic categories may be supported by [[Prosodic bootstrapping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gervain|first=J.|last2=Nespor|first2=M.|last3=Mazuka|first3=R.|last4=Horie|first4=R.|last5=Mehler|first5=J.|year=2008|title=Bootstrapping word order in prelexical infants: A Japanese-Italian cross-linguistic study.|url=https://www.sissa.it/cns/Articles/Gervainetal08.pdf|journal=Cognitive Psychology|volume=57|pages=56–74|via=|doi=10.1016/j.cogpsych.2007.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosodic bootstrapping is the hypothesis that children use prosodic cues, such as intonation and stress, to identify word boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/707263897|title=Introduction to psycholinguistics : understanding language science|last=J.|first=Traxler, Matthew|date=2012|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=|isbn=9781405198622|edition=1st ed|location=Chichester, West Sussex|pages=335|oclc=707263897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sensitivity to syntactic categories ===

Landau and Gleitman (1985) found when studying the acquisition of the verbs ''look'' and ''see'' by blind children that contextual clues appeared to be insufficient to explain their ability to differentiate these verbs &lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language and Experience: Evidence from the Blind Child|last=Landau|first=Barbara|last2=Gleitman|first2=Lila|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1985|isbn=0-674-51025-9|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=120–156|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.''  They considered the possibility that perceptual verbs might be used more by the blind child's mother when talking about nearby objects, since the child had to touch objects to perceive them. An analysis of the mother's utterances however, found this not to be the case.

The solution investigated by Gleitman et al. was that syntactic categories (referred to as 'Sentence Frames' by Gleitman), narrow down the contexts in which verbs are present, allowing children to learn their specific meanings in isolation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Acquisition of Syntactic Structure|last=Becker|first=Misha|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1-107-00784-0|location=New York|pages=186-187}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This narrowing provided evidence for their original hypothesis. When utterances that selected for ''perception verbs only'' were analyzed, the mother's use of the verbs ''look'' and ''see'' for nearby objects increased significantly. Gleitman concluded that a narrowing of contexts, ''then'' contextual support were required for the blind children to learn verbs (in which they had no direct experience). By proxy, since there are many verbs that sighted children do not have direct experience with, they must use the same mechanism as well.

Waxman and Booth (2001) found that children who heard nouns focused on the object categories and children who focused on adjectives focused on an object's properties and categories. This shows that children are sensitive to different syntactic categories and can use their observations of syntax to infer word meaning.

=== Sensitivity to syntactic framing ===
In Roger Brown’s 1957 experiment, children between the ages of three and five were shown various pictures depicting nonsense words that represented either singular nouns, [[mass nounc|mass nouns]], [[count noun]]s or verbs. When the novel words were positioned in a question format, the children were able to use the placement of the novel word in the sentence to draw conclusions focus on different aspects of the image shown and adjusted their answer. For example, when Brown wanted the child to identify a mass noun, he would ask the children "do you see any sib", and the child would point at the pictured mass noun or noun indicating quantity. 
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Mass noun environment|| ''Do you see any '''sib'''?''
|-
| Verb environment|| ''What is '''sib'''bing?''
|-
| Singular noun environment || ''Do you see a '''sib'''?''
|}
When children made guesses, they were correct more than half of the time.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Roger W.|title=Linguistic determinism and the part of speech.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/h0041199|journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|volume=55|issue=1|pages=1–5|doi=10.1037/h0041199|year=1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that children are sensitive to the syntactic position of words, and can correctly associate a novel word with its syntactic category.

Harrigan, Hacquard, and Lidz (2016) &lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harrigan|first=Kaitlyn|last2=Hacquard|first2=V.|last3=Lidz|first3=J.|year=2016|title=Syntactic Bootstrapping in the Acquisition of Attitude Verbs: think, want and hope|journal=In Proceedings of WCCFL|volume=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;—Found that children's interpretation of a new attitude verb depended on the [[Subcategorization|syntactic frame]] in which it was introduced. In the experiment, children who heard the word 'hope' presented in the same syntactic frame as 'want' (i.e. followed by an infinitival verb) connected the new verb 'hope' with a meaning of desire. On the other hand, those that heard 'hope' presented in the same frame as 'think' (i.e. followed by a finite verb) made no such association between desire and the new verb, instead of associating the novel verb with belief. This provides evidence that children use syntax to some extent in learning the meaning behind these sorts of abstract verbs.

Papafragou, Cassidy, Gleitman (2007) &lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Papafragou|first=Anna|last2=Cassidy|first2=Kimberly|last3=Gleitman|first3=Lila R.|date=2007|year=|title=When we think about thinking: The acquisition of belief verbs|url=|journal=Cognition|volume=105|pages=125–165|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2006.09.008|pmc=2768311}}&lt;/ref&gt;—Participants were asked to identify verbs within the context of a video. Papafragou et al. had children watch 12 videotaped stories. 4 stories about the subject's desires and 8 stories that varied in the subject's beliefs and the framing of a novel verb. At the end of the tape, they would hear a sentence describing the scene but the sentence's verb was replaced with a novel word. Children were asked to respond with what they thought the word meant. Their responses were categorized 4 ways: Action, Belief, Desire, and Other. They found that action words were easily interpreted by children. However, false belief scenes with the complementizer phrase caused for children to respond with belief words more often. Results showed that participants in the experiment identified the verb most accurately when they could use both the video and sentence contexts. When it comes to attitude verbs, children are sensitive to the syntactic framing of the verb in question.

Wellwood, Gagliardi, and Lidz (2016) &lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wellwood|first=Alexis|last2=Gagliardi|first2=Annie|last3=Lidz|first3=Jeffrey|date=2016-07-02|title=Syntactic and Lexical Inference in the Acquisition of Novel Superlatives|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15475441.2015.1052878|journal=Language Learning and Development|volume=12|issue=3|pages=262–279|doi=10.1080/15475441.2015.1052878|issn=1547-5441}}&lt;/ref&gt;— showed that four-year-olds can understand the difference between a quantitative or qualitative word, based on its syntactic position within a sentence. In “Gleebest of the cows are by the barn,” the novel word “gleebest” is in a determiner position, and is inferred to mean “most” or “many.” In “the gleebest cows are by the barn,” “gleebest” is in an adjective position, and children infer it to mean “spotty” or another quality. These results are significant because they show children using syntax to understand word meanings.

In the Gillette et al. (1999) study&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillette|first=J.|last2=Gleitman|first2=H.|last3=Gleitman|first3=L.|last4=Lederer|first4=A.|date=1999-12-07|title=Human simulations of vocabulary learning|journal=Cognition|volume=73|issue=2|pages=135–176|issn=0010-0277|pmid=10580161|doi=10.1016/s0010-0277(99)00036-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;—, the researchers tested adults to see what difficulties they would face when asked to identify a word from a muted, videotaped scene. They found that adults had trouble identifying the word, especially verbs, when they could only refer to the scene.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; Their performance increased once they were given the syntactic context for the mystery word. These results indicate that word learning is aided by the presence of syntactic context.

==Acquiring lexical categories==

=== Acquiring verbs ===
Gillette et al. (1999) performed experiments which found that participants who were provided both environmental and syntactic contexts were better able to infer what muted word was uttered at a particular point in a video than when only the environmental context was provided.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; In the experiment, participants were shown muted videos of a mother and infant playing. At a particular point in the video, a beep would sound and participants had to guess what word the beep stood for. It was always a verb or noun. Experimental results showed that participants were correct on identifying nouns more often than verbs. This shows that certain contexts are conducive to learning certain categories of words, like nouns, while the same context is not conducive to learning other categories, like verbs. However, when the scene was paired with a sentence containing all novel words, but the same syntactic structure as the original sentence, adults were better able to guess the verb. This shows that syntactic context is useful in the acquisition of verbs.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

An early demonstration by Naigles (1990) of syntactic bootstrapping involved showing 2-year-olds a video of a duck using its left hand to push a rabbit down into a [[squatting position]] while both the animals wave their right arms in circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naigles|first1=L.|title=Children Use Syntax to Learn Verb Meaning|journal=Journal of Child Language|date=1990|volume=17|pages=357–374|doi=10.1017/S0305000900013817}}&lt;!--|accessdate=31 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

 '''Initial video''': Duck uses left hand to push rabbit into squatting position while both animals wave their right arms in circles

During the video, children are presented with one of the following two descriptions:

 (6) '''Utterance A''': ''The duck is '''kradding''' the rabbit.''
     (describes a situation where the duck does something to the rabbit)
 (7) '''Utterance B''': ''The rabbit and duck are '''kradding'''.''
     (describes a situation where the duck and the rabbit perform the same action)

Children were then presented two distinct follow-up videos.

 '''Follow-up video 1''': the duck pushing the rabbit
 '''Follow-up video 2''': the duck and the rabbit are both waving their arms in the air.

When instructed to "find kradding", children looked to the video that illustrated the utterance they heard during the initial video. Children who heard utterance A interpreted ''kradding'' to mean the act of the duck pushing on the rabbit, while children who heard utterance B assumed ''kradding'' was the action of arm waving. This indicates that children arrive at interpretations of a novel verb based on the utterance context and the syntactic structure in which it was embedded.

In 1990, Lila Gleitman took this idea further by examining the acquisition of verbs in more detail.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Gleitman, Lila. "The Structural Source of Verb Meanings", 1990&lt;/ref&gt; In her study, she found that children could differentiate between verbs that take one or more arguments and that this knowledge was used to help them narrow down the potential meanings for the verb in question. This discovery explains how children can learn the meaning of verbs that cannot be observed, like ‘think’.

In later studies, this was exemplified by Fisher as she proposed that children can use the number of noun phrases in a sentence as evidence about a verb's meaning.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Cynthia|year=1996|title=Structural Limits on Verb Mapping: The Role of Analogy in Children’s Interpretations of Sentences|url=|journal=Cognitive Psychology|volume=31|issue=12|pages=41–81|via=|doi=10.1006/cogp.1996.0012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that children expect the noun phrases in a sentence to map one-to-one with participant roles in the event described by that sentence. For example, if a toddler hears a sentence that contains two noun phrases, she can infer that that sentence describes an event with two participants. This constrains the meaning that the verb in that sentence can have. Fisher presented 3 and 5 year old children a video in which one participant caused a second participant to move. Children who heard that scene described by a transitive clause containing a novel verb, associated the subject of the verb with the agent. Children who heard the scene described by an intransitive clause associated the subject with either the agent or the patient.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; This shows that children make different inferences about meaning depending on the transitivity of the sentence.

==== Acquiring attitude verbs ====
Acquiring the meaning of attitude verbs, which refer to an individual’s mental state, provides a challenge for word learners since these verbs do not correlate with any physical aspects of the environment. Words such as 'think' and 'want' do not have physically observable qualities. Thus, there must be something deeper going on that enables children to learn these verbs referring to abstract mental concepts, such as syntactic frames as described in a study above by Harrigan, Hacquard, and Lidz.&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt; Because children have no initial idea about the meaning or usage of the words, syntactic bootstrapping aids them in figuring out when verbs refer to mental concepts. If a child hears the statement, "Matt thinks his grandmother is under the covers," three- to four-year-old children will understand that the sentence is about Matt's belief.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Papafragou|first=Anna|last2=Cassidy|first2=Kimberly|last3=Gleitman|first3=Lila R.|date=2007|year=|title=When we think about thinking: The acquisition of belief verbs|url=|journal=Cognition|volume=105|pages=|via=|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2006.09.008|pmc=2768311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children will understand from the syntactic frame in which it was uttered that the verb for mental state, ''thinks'', refers to Matt's beliefs and not to his grandmother's. In addition, Gillette et al. (1999)&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; show that mental state verbs cannot easily be identified when only visual context is available and that these verbs showed the greatest improvement when syntactic context was provided.

=== Acquiring nouns ===
The acquisition of nouns is related to the acquisition of the [[#The acquisition of the count/mass contrast|mass/count contrast]]. In 1969, [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]&lt;ref&gt;Quine, W. V. O. "Ontological Relativity and Other Essays", 1969&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that children cannot learn new nouns unless they have already acquired this semantic distinction. Otherwise, the word “apples” might refer to the individual objects in a pile or the pile itself, and the child would have no way to know without already understanding the difference between a mass and a count noun. Nancy N. Soja&lt;ref&gt;Soja, N "Inferences about the meanings of nouns: the relationship between perception and syntax", 1992&lt;/ref&gt; argues that Quine is mistaken, and that children can learn new nouns without fully understanding the mass/count distinction. She found in her study that 2-year old children were able to learn new nouns (some mass, some count nouns) from inferring meaning from the syntactic structure of the sentence the words were introduced in.

=== Acquiring adjectives ===
In a 2010 study, Syrett and Lidz&lt;ref&gt;Syrett, Kristen &amp; Jeffrey Lidz."30-Month-Olds Use the Distribution and Meaning of Adverbs to Interpret Novel Adjectives", 2010&lt;/ref&gt; show that children learn the meaning of novel gradable adjectives on the basis of the adverbs that modify them. Gradable adjectives have a scale associated with them: for example, the adjective “large” places the noun that it modifies on a size scale, while the adjective “expensive” places the noun that is modifiers on a price scale. In addition, gradable adjectives (GA's) subdivide into two classes: relative and maximal GA’s.

Relative GA’s are words like “big” in (5), and require a reference point: a big mouse is not the same size as a big elephant. As shown in (6) and (7), while relative GAs can be modified by the adverb ''very'' they cannot be modified by the adverb ''completely''.

 relative gradable adjectives
 (5) a.  ''a '''big''' mouse''
     b.  ''a '''big''' elephant''
 (6) a.  ''a very '''big''' mouse''
     b.  ''a very '''big''' elephant''
 (7) a. *''a completely '''big''' mouse''
     b. *''a completely '''big''' elephant''

Maximal GA’s are words like, “full” in (8); they operate on a close-ended scale. As shown in (9) and (10), while relative GAs cannot be modified by the adverb ''very'' they can be modified by the adverb ''completely''.

 maximal gradable adjectives
 (8)  a.    ''a '''full''' pool''
      b.    ''a '''full''' tank''
 (9)  a. ?? ''a very '''full''' pool''
      b. ?? ''a very '''full''' tank''
 (10) a.    ''a completely '''full''' pool''
      b.    ''a completely '''full''' tank''

In the 2010 study, Syrett and Lidz showed children pictures of objects that could be described in terms of both relative and maximal GA’s. For example, a picture of a container that could be described as both ''tall'' (a relative GA) and ''clear'' (a maximal GA).

When showing these objects to the children, the novel adjective used to describe them was prefaced with either adverb ''very'' (which usually modifies relative GA’s) or the adverb ''completely'' (which modifies maximal GA’s). As a control, in some contexts, no adverb was present. When the novel adjective was presented with the adverb ''very'', the children assigned a relative GA meaning to it, and when it was presented with adverb ''completely'', a maximal GA. When no adverb was present, the children were unable to assign a meaning to the adjective. This shows that, in order for children to learn the meaning of a new adjective, they depend on grammatical information provide by adverbs about the semantic class of the novel adjective.

An experiment by Wellwood, Gagliardi, and Lidz (2016) showed that four-year-olds associate unknown words with a quality meaning when they are presented with adjective syntax, and with a quantitative meaning when they are presented with determiner syntax. For example, in "Gleebest of the cows are by the barn," "gleebest" would be interpreted as "many" or "four," a quantity. Yet children associate the same unknown word with a quality interpretation when the word is presented in an adjective position. In the sentence "The gleebest cows are by the barn," "gleebest" would be interpreted as "striped" or "purple," a quality.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; This shows that children use syntax to identify whether a word is an adjective or a determiner, and use that category information to infer aspects of the word's meaning.

== Acquiring functional categories ==
There is a basic contrast between lexical categories (which include open-class items such as verbs, nouns, and adjectives), and [[functional item|functional categories]] (which include closed-class items such [[auxiliary verb]]s, case markers, [[complementizer]]s, [[coordination (linguistics)|conjunctions]] and [[determiner]]s. The acquisition functional categories has been studied significantly less than the lexical class, so much remains unknown. A 1998 study led by Rushen Shi&lt;ref&gt;Shi, Rushen, James L. Morgan, Paul Allopena. (1998). Phonological and acoustic bases for earliest grammatical category assignment; a cross-linguistic perspective&lt;/ref&gt; shows that, at a very young age, Mandarin and Turkish learners use [[phonology|phonological]], acoustic and distributional cues to distinguish between words that are lexical categories from words that are functional categories. 11 to 20-month old children were observed speaking with their mothers to evaluate whether speech directed at the children contained clues that they could then use to categorize words as "lexical" or "function". Compared to as lexical category words, functional category words were found to have the following properties:

* simpler syllable structures
* simpler vowels ([[monophthong|monopthongs]] as opposed to [[diphthong]]s)
* shorter duration
* lower amplitude
* occur much more frequently in speech

== Challenges to the theory ==
[[Steven Pinker]] presents his theory of [[semantic bootstrapping]], which hypothesizes that children use the meaning of words to start to learn the syntax of their language.  Gleitman (1990) counters Pinker’s ideas by asserting that context is insufficient to supply word meaning, as a single context can allow for multiple interpretations of an uttered sentence. She explains that simply observing objects and events in the world does not provide sufficient information to infer the meanings of words and sentences.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Pinker, however, argues that semantic bootstrapping and syntactic bootstrapping aren't conflicting ideas, and that semantic bootstrapping makes no claims about learning word meanings. He argues that since semantic bootstrapping is a hypothesis about how children acquire syntax, while syntactic bootstrapping is a hypothesis about how children acquire word meanings, the opposition between the two theories does not necessarily exist.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pinker|first=Steven|year=1994|title=How could a child use verb syntax to learn verb semantics?|url=|journal=Lingua|volume=94|pages=337–410|via=|doi=10.1016/0024-3841(94)90347-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinker agrees that syntactic categories are in fact used by children to learn semantics and accepts syntactic bootstrapping, but argues that Gleitman applies the hypothesis too broadly, and that is insufficient evidence to account for all of Gleitman's claims. Pinker argues that while children can use syntax to learn certain semantic properties within a single frame, like the number of arguments a verb takes or the types of arguments such as agent and patient, there are serious problems with the argument that children pick up on these semantic properties from the syntax when a verb is found in a wide range of syntactic frames. Pinker uses the verb "sew" as an example:
{| class="wikitable"
! colspan="4" |Frames of "sew" (Pinker 1994)
|-
| rowspan="4" |(You) sew
| colspan="2" |
|Activity
|-
| rowspan="3" |the shirt
|
|Activity done to an object.
|-
|for me
|Creating an object for a beneficiary.
|-
|out of rags
|Creating one object out of another.
|}
Pinker argues that the syntax provides information about possible verb frames, but does not help a learner "zoom in" on a verb's meaning after hearing it in multiple frames. According to Pinker, the frames presented above for "sew" can do nothing for learners other than clue them into the fact that "sewing" is some sort of activity. Furthermore, Pinker disagrees with Gleitman's claim that the ambiguities in the situations where a word is used could only be solved by using information about how the word behaves syntactically.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Applications cross-linguistically ==
With all of the studies above supporting or challenging syntactic bootstrapping, how does the theory hold up cross linguistically?

Two studies focusing on French and German were determining the use of syntactic contexts to classify novel words as nouns or verbs. The German study &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Höhle, B., Weissenborn, J., Kiefer, D., Schulz, A., &amp; Schmitz, M.|title=Functional elements in infants' speech processing: The role of determiners in the syntactic categorization of lexical elements.|journal=Infancy|date=2004|volume=5 | issue = 3 |pages=341–353|doi=10.1207/s15327078in0503_5}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that children between 14 and 16 months could use [[determiner]]s to classify a novel word as a noun, however, they could not show the same ability mapping pronoun environments to verbs. Overall, this exemplifies their ability to determine the categories of function words and shows a sensitivity to syntactic framing. Following this conclusion, Christophe et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Christophe, A., Millotte, S., Bernal, S., &amp; Lidz, J.|title=Bootstrapping lexical and syntactic acquisition|journal=Language and Speech|date=2008|volume=51(1-2)|pages=61–75|doi=10.1177/00238309080510010501}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that children can use this ability along with [[Prosodic bootstrapping]] to infer the syntactic category of the neighboring content words; as at 23 months they can classify novel nouns as well as verbs based on their surrounding syntactic envionrment. These studies follow the Syntactic Bootstrapping model of language acquisition, however, the determiner/noun and pronoun/verb environments are also found in English, som, how well does this theory apply to a Language structurally different from English?

Lee and Naigles (2005) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Joanne N.|last2=Naigles|first2=Letitia R.|year=2005|title=The Input to Verb Learning in Mandarin Chinese: A Role for syntactic bootstrapping|url=|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=41|issue=3|pages=529–540|via=|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.41.3.529}}&lt;/ref&gt; looked into how Mandarin children use the transitive versus intransitive environments to infer meaning in a language that allows the [[noun phrase]] (subject or object) argument to go unpronounced. Following Fisher’s studies where children use the number of NP’s to make conclusions about the causation in the sentence; 1 NP is an intransitive sentence and involves only the agent while 2 NP’s is a transitive environment and involves an action being taken upon something or someone. 
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|-
! colspan = "2"|Intransitive environment !!colspan="3" | Transitive environment
|-
| &lt;Agent&gt; || &lt;Non-causative verb&gt; || &lt;Agent&gt; || &lt;Causative verb&gt; || &lt;Theme&gt;
|-
| ''The dog'' || ''comes'' || ''The dog'' || ''brings'' || ''the lion''
|}
The environment above was presented in the study and then altered to test the change of interpretation the Mandarin children might have. Due to the pervasive [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|ellipsis]] in Mandarin, the number of NP’s in a phrase is a weaker clue in mapping causation or non-causation of a verb. Presented with an elided transitive environment ''The dog brings,'' the children determined the sentence to be intransitive, meaning they changed their interpretation of the verb based on the number of noun phrases presented. This was shown as the children used toys to act out the scenario they heard; if their interpretation were to be independent of the number of NP's they would have shown the dog bringing the lion, however, they showed the dog going on its own, showing their interpretation of the verb to be non-causative. This follows the syntactic bootstrapping theory as their mapping of verb meaning relied on the syntactic frame and content in the sentence. However, it poses another question about how Mandarin children can go on to map transitive or intransitive environments properly during their development.

A few studies have begun to look at how children learning languages with different word orders represent syntactic structures which are required for children to map word meanings or categories using syntactic bootstrapping. For example, the research on the acquisition of verbs presents English children as using information about the subject and objects to determine if the verb is causative or non-causative, however, will this ability change in a language which has the object occurring before the verb. One could assume this to be a difficult task if both an English child and child leaning an [[Subject–object–verb|SOV]] language have the same mental representation of syntactic structure. To address this, a Gervain, et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gervain, J., Nespor, M., Mazuka, R., Horie, R., &amp; Mehler, J.|title=Bootstrapping word order in prelexical infants: A Japanese–Italian cross-linguistic study|journal=Cognitive Psychology|date=2008|volume=57 | issue = 1 |pages=56–74|doi=10.1016/j.cogpsych.2007.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; looked at an infant’s mental representation of Japanese, which is a [[Complement (linguistics)|complement]] – [[Head (linguistics)|head]] language with an object-verb (OV) word order, and Italian, which like English, is head-complement and therefore has a verb-object (VO) word order. They found that 8-month-olds have a general knowledge of word order specific to their language preceding their acquisition of lexical items or syntactic categories. Their attuning of structural relations of syntactic categories (verbs, nouns, etc.) within their language allows them to then apply this knowledge later in their development, possibly allowing for language-specific syntactic bootstrapping.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20595">{{Linguistics}}
The '''theta-criterion''' (also named '''θ-criterion''') is a constraint on [[x-bar theory]] that was first proposed by {{harvs|txt|first=Noam|last=Chomsky|author-link=Noam Chomsky|year=1981}} as a rule within the system of principles of the [[government and binding theory]], called theta-theory (θ-theory).  As theta-theory is concerned with the distribution and assignment of [[theta roles|theta-roles]] (a.k.a. thematic roles), the theta-criterion describes the specific match between [[Argument (linguistics)|arguments]] and theta-roles (θ-roles) in [[logical form]] (LF):
{|
|-
|
{{Quote box
 |quote  = '''θ-criterion:''' ''Each argument bears one and only one θ-role, and each θ-role is assigned to one and only one argument.''
 |source = {{harv|Chomsky|1981|p=35}}
 |align  = center
 |fontsize=14
}}
|}

Being a constraint on x-bar theory, the criterion aims to parse out ill-formed sentences. Thus, if the number or categories of arguments in a sentence does not meet the theta-role assigner's requirement in any given sentence, that sentence will be deemed ungrammatical. {{harv|Carnie|2007|p=224}}. In other words, theta-criterion sorts sentences into grammatical and ungrammatical bins based on [[Selection (linguistics)|c-selection and s-selection]].

== Applied ==

=== Theta grid ===
A [[Theta role|theta-role]] is a status of [[thematic relation]] {{harv|Chomsky|1981|p=35}}. In other words, a theta-role describes the connection of meaning between a [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] or a [[verb]] and a [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituent]] selected by this predicate. The number, types and positions of theta-roles that a lexicon assigns is encoded in its lexical entry {{harv|Chomsky|1981|p=38}} and must be satisfied in syntactic structure following [[Projection Principle]].{{efn|Note that this doesn't mean that all theta-roles are obligatorily assigned. If a structural position that can be theta-marked is obligatory, then the theta-role assignment is also obligatory. Otherwise it is not {{harv|Chomsky|1981|p=40}}. See Transitivity section}} The [[Selection (linguistics)|selection]] of a constituent by a head based on meaning is called s-selection (semantic-selection) and those based on grammatical categories are called c-selection.{{efn|Such selection (theta-role assignment) is strictly local and only occurs between sister nodes. A lexical head assigns a theta-role to its complement, and the subject of this XP can receive a theta-role from the [[X']] including the head and its complement. The argument in subject position is called external argument, and the one in object position is called internal argument.{{harv|Williams|1981}} Adjuncts don't receive theta-roles so are not restricted by theta-criterion.}} {{harv|Sportiche|Koopman|Stabler|2014|p=141}} Such information can be expressed with a theta grid.

In the example below the verb 'love' has two theta-roles to assign: [[Thematic relation|agent]] (the entity who loves) and [[Thematic relation|theme]] (the entity being loved). In accordance with the theta-criterion, each theta-role must have its argument counterpart.
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-roles
!&lt;AGENT&gt;
!
!&lt;THEME&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;       |&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;      |&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|(1a)
|Megan
|loves
|Kevin
|-
| colspan="4" |{{harv|Carnie|2007|p=225 (22)}}
|}
In Example 1a, '''Megan''' and '''Kevin''' are the arguments that the verb assigns the agent and theme theta-roles to, respectively. Because there is a one-to-one mapping of argument to theta-role, the theta-criterion is satisfied and the sentence is deemed [[Grammaticality|grammatical]] {{harv|Carnie|2007|p=225}}. Below are two examples where the theta-criterion has not been fulfilled and are thus ungrammatical.
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-roles
!&lt;AGENT&gt;
!
!&lt;THEME&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;       |&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;      |&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|(1b)
|Megan
|loves
|
|-

|}
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-roles
!&lt;AGENT&gt;
!
!&lt;THEME&gt;
!
|-
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;        |&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;      |&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|&lt;nowiki&gt;    |&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|(1c)
|Megan
|loves
|Jason
|Kevin
|-
| colspan="5" |{{harv|Carnie|2007|p=226 (26)}}
|}
Example 1b is ungrammatical (marked with '''*''') because there are more theta-roles available than there are arguments. The theta-role '''theme''' does not have an argument matched to it. On the other hand, in example (1c), there are more arguments than theta-roles. Both theta-roles are matched to arguments ('''Megan''' with '''Agent''' and '''Jason''' with '''theme'''), but there is an argument left without a corresponding theta-role (Kevin has no theta-role) {{harv|Carnie|2007}}. Thus for reasons of inequality in number between theta-roles and arguments, with either having more than the other, the result will be ungrammatical.

=== Consequence on movement ===
Since [[Trace (linguistics)|trace]] transmits theta-role, [[Syntactic movement|movements]] resulting in non-local relations between theta-role assigners and receivers in [[Transformational grammar|surface structure]] don't violate theta-criterion. This allows us to generate sentences with [[Raising (linguistics)|DP-raising]], head movement, [[wh-movement]], etc. However, if a phrase occupies a theta-position (complement or selected subject) in [[D-structure]], it can no longer move to another theta-position or it will receive two theta-roles {{harv|Chomsky|1981|p=46}}.

=== Transitivity ===

[[Verb]]s that can be either [[Transitive verb|transitive]] or [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]] at the first glance could present a problem for the theta-criterion. For a transitive verb, such as "hit," we assign the [[theta role|theta-role]]s agent and theme to the arguments, as shown in (2b), (2c), and (2d):
[[File:MaryArrived-D.jpg|thumb|(3c). The underlying representation of "Mary arrived." by a [[Concrete syntax tree|syntactic tree]].]]
[[File:MaryArrived-S.png|thumb|(3d). The surface representation of "Mary arrived." by a syntactic tree. "Mary" is projected to the spec-TP position by the [[Extended Projection Principle|extended projection principle]] triggered by the [+tense] tense morpheme.]]

|}
The action of hitting here requires an animate subject, an [[Thematic relation|agent]], carry out the action. The [[Thematic relation|theme]] is then someone or something that undergoes the action.
For an intransitive verb, such as "arrive," we assign the theta-role theme to the sole argument, since "Mary" is the one the undergoes the action:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-roles
!&lt;THEME&gt;
!
!
|-
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|

|*Mary
|arrived
|an arrival.
|-
| colspan="4" |adapted from {{harv|Pesetsky &amp; Torrego|2002|p=22 (36a)}}
|}

The theta-criterion assigns the theta-role in the [[underlying structure]], as shown by (3c). The past-tense morpheme then requires a subject at the spec-TP position and forces the [[Syntactic movement|movement]] of "Mary," as shown by (3d).
A verb like "eat" can choose to take an object, as shown in (4):
{|
|-
|
 (4) a. ''John ate.''
     b. ''John ate something.''
     c. ''John ate a big lunch.''
         {{harv|Rice|1988|p=203 (1b-d)}}
|}
For this type of verb, the potential object is usually semantically limited and therefore can be inferred from the verb at a default value {{harv|Rice|1988|pp=203–4}}. For instance, for (4a), the listener/reader automatically assumes that John ate "something." What necessitates the object in (4c) is the distinction from the default meaning achieved by specifying what John ate {{harv|Rice|1988|p=208}}. As a result, this type of verbs can be treated the same as transitive verbs. The theta-roles of "agent" and "theme" can be assigned:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-roles
!&lt;AGENT&gt;
!
!(&lt;THEME&gt;)
|-
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;(|)&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|(4a)
|John
|ate.
|
|-
|(4b)
|John
|ate
|something.
|-
|(4c)
|John
|ate
|a big lunch.
|-
| colspan="4" |{{harv|Rice|1988|p=203 (1b-d)}}
|}

In summary, by assigning the correct theta-roles, theta-criterion is able to tell the real intransitive verbs, such as "arrive" apart from verbs that can appear intransitive, such as "eat."

=== PRO and pro ===

==== PRO ====
[[PRO (linguistics)|PRO]] (pronounced 'big pro') is a null pronoun phrase that occurs in a position where it does not get case (or gets null case){{efn|There are exceptions. For example, Icelandic PRO is argued to bear normal cases {{harv|Sigurðsson|2008}}}} but takes the theta-role assigned by the [[Nonfinite verb|non-finite verb]] to its subject. PRO's meaning is determined by the precedent DP that [[Control (linguistics)|controls]] it {{harv|Carnie|2012|p=429}}. As theta criterion states that each argument is assigned a theta-role, and those theta-roles must consist of a syntactic category that the verb selects even when there is no overt subject. This is where PRO comes in to help satisfy theta-criterion by appearing as the null subject attaining the appropriate theta role {{harv|Camacho|2013}}.
Below is an example containing PRO in a sentence:

 (5) a. ''Jean&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is likely  [t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; to leave]''.
     b. ''Jean is reluctant [PRO to leave]''.
        {{harv|Carnie|2012|p=430 (1)}}

Example (5a) is a [[Raising (linguistics)|raising]] sentence,and in contrast, (5b) is a [[Control (linguistics)|control]] sentence, meaning it does not involve any DP [[Syntactic movement|movement]]. The PRO, which is a "null DP" is in the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] position of the [[Dependent clause|embedded clause]].

 (6) a. ''Jean wants Brian&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; [t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; to leave]''.
     b. ''Jean persuaded Brian [PRO to leave]''.
       {{harv|Carnie|2012|p=430 (4}}

Similarly, example (6a) is a raising-to-object sentence; "Brian" raises to the object position of the verb ''want.''{{efn|This movement won't cause ''Brian'' to get a theta-role from the verb ''want'' because 1) ''want'' only assigns a proposition role to its complement, and that role is already assigned to the clause ''Brain to leave''. 2) ''Brian'' in such cases moved to the specifier position of AgrOP rather than directly into the complement position of ''want''. {{harvtxt|Carnie|2007|page=411}}}} In contrast, (6b) is an object control sentence.{{harv|Carnie|2012|p=430}} The verb ''persuade'' has three theta-roles to assign: "agent" to ''Jean'', "theme" to ''Brian'', and "proposition" to the clause [''PRO to leave'']. There is no raising, but there is a PRO in the subject position of the embedded clause that takes the verb leave's only theta-role, "agent". Since Brian does not receive theta-role from ''leave'', it only bears one theta-role, nor does PRO receive a second theta-role from ''persuade''. Every argument only receives one theta-role, and every theta-role of the two predicates is assigned to only one argument. The sentence is thus grammatical.

==== pro ====
[[Empty category#pro (little pro)|pro]], also known as little pro, is an [[empty category]] that occurs in a subject or object position of a [[finite clause]] (finite clauses must contain a verb which shows tense) in languages like Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, and some Arabic dialects ({{harvnb|Jaeggli|Safir|1989}}; {{harvnb|Rizzi|1986}}). pro differs from PRO in that it contains [[Case (linguistics)|case]]. The meaning of pro is determined not by its [[Antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]] but by verb [[Agreement (grammar)|agreement]] in the sentence. The DP is 'dropped' from a sentence if its reference can be recovered from the context.{{harv|Carnie|2012|p=429}} For example:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-roles
!&lt;AGENT&gt;
!
!&lt;THEME&gt;
!&lt;GOAL&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|(7a)
|Un bravo psicanalista
(A good psychoanalyst)
|può restituire
(can give back)
|'''pro'''
|a se stessi
(to themselves)
|-
| colspan="5" |'A good psychoanalyst can return people to themselves'.
|-
| colspan="5" |(Adapted from {{harvtxt|Rizzi|1986|page=504 (11b)}})
|}
The verb ''restituire'' 'give back' assigns three theta-roles, but there are only two overt arguments in the sentence. It ultimately satisfies theta-criterion because the role, theme, is taken by a pro, whose existence can be proved by the properly [[Binding (linguistics)|bound]] reflexive pronoun ''se stessi''. Compare (7a) with (7b) below:
 (7b) *''Un bravo psicanalista può dare aiuto a  se stessi''.
       A  good  psychoanalyst can give help  to oneself.
       'A good psychoanalyst can give help to themselves'.
      (Adapted from {{harvtxt|Rizzi|1986|page=504 (13b)}})
When the reflexive pronoun ''se stessi'' 'themselves' doesn't have a proper [[Antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]] to co-refer to, the sentence can't be grammatical. This indicates that in (7a) ''se stessi'' must have a proper antecedent in the sentence—the pro that takes the theme role.

=== Cognate object ===
[[Cognate object]]s are nominal complements of their cognate verbs that are normally [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]]. For example,
 (8) ''John died a gruesome death.''
      {{harv|Jones|1988|p=89 (1a)}}
Such a structure posed a problem for theta-criterion because normally the verb assigns only one theta-role, theme, which is already taken by the [[Determiner phrase|DP]], "John." The sentence should be thus predicted ill-formed. To explain the phenomenon, one way is to re-categorize such a verb as "die" so as to change the way it assigns theta-roles. For that purpose, (8) can be interpreted as follows:
 (9) ''John met a gruesome death.''
      {{harv|Jones|1988|p=91 (5a)}}
Or John ''underwent'' a gruesome death. If the verb "die" is essentially similar to the operation-verb "meet," the cognate objects should be assigned a theta-role—one restricted to the nominal form of the verb head {{harv|Jones|1988}}. In other words, "die" is now classified as a potentially transitive verb, assigning two theta-roles, agent to "John" and theme to "a gruesome death." Such a possibility is falsified, however, because cognate object constructions cannot be passivized {{harv|Jones|1988}}.
[[File:JohnDiedAGruesomeDeath.jpg|thumb|(11c) Tree structure of (11a) "John died a gruesome death." The adjunct phrase is highlighted in yellow. Substituting the adjunct DP "a gruesome death" with the [[adverbial phrase]] "gruesomely" will derive (11b).]]
 (10) a. ''A gruesome death was met by John.''
      b. ''*A gruesome death was died by John.''
      {{harv|Jones|1988|p=91 (6a), p=92 (11a)}}
As we can no longer consider verbs that take cognate objects the same as potentially transitive verbs, {{harvtxt|Jones|1988}} argues, based on the framework of {{harvtxt|Zubizarreta|1982}}, that cognate objects are [[Adjunct (grammar)|adjuncts]] rather than [[Argument (grammar)|arguments]], having the same meaning and structure as the manner [[adverb]]s in (12b).
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!Theta-role
!&lt;THEME&gt;
!
!
|-
|
|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|
|
|-
|(11a)
|John
|died
|a gruesome death.
|-
|(11b)
|John
|died
|gruesomely.
|-
| colspan="4" |{{harvtxt|Jones|1988|p=89 (1a), p. 93 (12a)}}
|}

Such an analysis restores cognate objects to the group of arguments satisfying the theta-criterion, as adjuncts, by definition, are not counted as arguments and therefore need not be restricted by theta criterion. The tree form (11c) shows the adjunct DP in its relative position.

=== Deverbal nouns ===

[[Deverbal noun]]s are derived from verbs and thus assign theta-roles as their verb stems do. For example,

 (12) (i) ''the barbarians' destruction of Rome''
     (ii) ''Rome's destruction (by the barbarians)''
    (iii) ''the destruction of Rome (by the barbarians)''
     (iv) ''*the barbarian's destruction''
    ({{harv|Chomsky|1981|p=104 (7)}})

According to {{harvtxt|Chomsky|1981|p=104}}, the constructions in (10) are analogous to "the barbarians destroyed Rome" and ''destruction'' needs to assign theta-roles in line with theta-criterion. It assigns "agent" to ''the barbarians'' and "theme" to ''Rome'' so (i) is fine. The verb "destroy" alone doesn't obligatorily assign theta-role to its subject so (ii) and (iii) is well-formed, too. However, "destroy" must assign a "theme", so (iv) is ruled out.

== Alternative approaches ==
Theta-criterion experienced its golden age in the 1980s when people discussed its application to various languages and structures and developed many other theories from it. However, after the [[minimalist program]] challenged some cornerstones of government and binding theory, people started to question the validity of this criterion, especially the number of theta-roles allowed to be taken by an argument. Hornstein and Boeckx, for example, proposed that there is no upper limit on the number of theta-roles an argument can receive during derivation. In their theory, the function of selecting correct number of arguments is shouldered by [[case theory]], and theta-roles are just features on verbs that needs to be checked {{harv|Hornstein|1999}}.

'''Vernacular orientation''' refers to the status that a language is afforded by one of its [[mother-tongue]] speakers (Tiessen, 2003).  This status is exhibited through the [[sociolinguistic]] behaviours of a mother-tongue speaker.  A speaker who exhibits positive [[vernacular]] orientation is one who exhibits a preferred status for their mother tongue in such things as patterns of language use, language attitudes, [[social network]]s and even levels of [[language proficiency]].  Likewise, a speaker who exhibits negative vernacular orientation is one who exhibits a preferred status for a language other than their mother tongue in these areas of sociolinguistic behaviour.

An example of research into vernacular orientation as expressed in a community can be found at [http://www.und.nodak.edu/dept/linguistics/theses/2003Tiessen.PDF].  This is a study on vernacular orientation in the [[Talysh people|Talysh]] community of the city of [[Sumgayit]] in the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]] for the purpose of gaining a greater understanding of its causes.  Vernacular orientation is described in three areas of sociolinguistic behaviour: patterns of vernacular language use, vernacular language proficiency and frequency of vernacular-speaking individuals in social networks. Data was collected through personal interviews. The questionnaires for these interviews were developed using a qualitative-relational research approach. The description of vernacular orientation takes the form of a criteria-based typology of which an analysis of influential factors is ultimately made. This analysis of influential factors demonstrates the interaction between vernacular orientation as described in the typology and the contextual elements of the family, socio-economic dynamics and individual attitudes.

'''''Word Wars''''' is a 2004 [[documentary film]] directed by [[Eric Chaikin]] and [[Julian Petrillo]] about competitive [[Scrabble]] playing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5725544/ AP via MSNBC "Film profiles the culture of Scrabble" August 16, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;
Its full title is: '''''Word Wars - Tiles and Tribulations on the Scrabble Circuit'''''. The film was an official selection at the 2004 [[Sundance film festival]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2003-12-02-sundance_x.htm ''USA Today'' "Sundance announces portion of 2004 lineup" 2 December 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; had a 25-city theatrical run, was included as part of the [[Discovery Times Channel]]'s "Screening Room" series, and was nominated for numerous awards including a 2004 Documentary [[Emmy]] for "Best Artistic or Cultural Programming" and an International Documentary Association (IDA) Award. The film is distributed by 7th Art Releasing. 

The film follows four players in the nine months leading up to the 2002 [[National Scrabble Championship]], which was held in [[San Diego]], [[California]]: [[Joe Edley]], [[Matt Graham (Scrabble)|Matt Graham]], [[Marlon Hill]], and [[Joel Sherman]]. These players also appear in [[Stefan Fatsis]]'s book ''[[Word Freak (book)|Word Freak]]'', as does Chaikin. Fatsis and Chaikin are both tournament Scrabble players themselves.&lt;ref&gt;''The Washington Times'' "Fightin' words spur vivid documentary" page M24 accessed via Ebbsco's Australia New Zealand Reference Centre 20 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
