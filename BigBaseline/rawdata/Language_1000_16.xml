      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4549">{{about|languages that naturally emerge in computer simulations or controlled psychological experiments with humans|planned or constructed human languages|constructed language|formal computer languages|formal language}}

'''Artificial languages''' are [[language]]s of a typically very limited size which emerge either in computer simulations between artificial agents, robot interactions or controlled psychological experiments with humans. They are different from both [[constructed language]]s and [[formal language]]s in that they have '''''not''''' been consciously devised by an individual or group but are the result of (distributed) conventionalisation processes, much like [[natural language]]s. Opposed to the idea of a central ''designer'', the field of '''artificial language evolution''' in which artificial languages are studied can be regarded as a sub-part of the more general [[cultural evolution]] studies.

==Origin==
The idea of creation of artificial language arose in 17th and 18th century as a result of gradually decreasing international role of Latin. The initial schemes ere mainly aimed at the development of a rational language free from inconsistence of living language and based on classification of concepts. The material of living languages also appears later.

== Motivation ==

The lack of empirical evidence in the field of [[evolutionary linguistics]] has led many researchers to adopt computer simulations as a means to investigate the ways in which artificial agents can self-organize languages with natural-like properties.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research is based on the hypothesis that [[natural language]] is a [[complex adaptive system]] that emerges through interactions between individuals and continues to evolve in order to remain adapted to the needs and capabilities of its users. By explicitly building all assumptions into computer simulations, this strand of research strives to experimentally investigate the dynamics underlying [[language change]] as well as questions regarding the [[origin of language]] under controlled conditions.

Due to its success the paradigm has also been extended to investigate the emergence of new languages in psychological experiments with humans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the focus of the investigations lies on the conventionalisation dynamics and higher-level properties of the resulting languages rather than specific details of the conventions, artificially evolved languages are typically not documented or re-used outside the single experiment trial or simulation run in which they emerge. In fact, the limited size and short-lived nature of artificial languages are probably the only things that sets them apart from ''natural'' languages, since ''all'' languages are artificial insofar as they are [[conventional]] (see also [[Constructed language#Planned, constructed, artificial]]).

== Uses ==

Artificial languages have been used in research in developmental psycholinguistics. Because researchers have a great deal of control over artificial languages, they have used these languages in '''[[statistical language acquisition]]''' studies, in which it can be helpful to control the linguistic patterns heard by infants.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8938">In [[linguistics]], '''backchannels''' are listener responses at a point in time of a conversation where another person is the primary speaker. Backchannels can be both [[Language|verbal]] and [[non-verbal]] in nature, and are frequently [[phatic expression]]s, primarily serving a social or meta-conversational purpose, rather than involving substantial two-way communication.

== Definition and Use ==
The term was coined by [[Victor Yngve]] in 1970, in the following passage: "In fact, both the person who has the turn and his partner are simultaneously engaged in both speaking and listening.  This is because of the existence of what I call the back channel, over which the person who has the turn receives short messages such as 'yes' and 'uh-huh' without relinquishing the turn."&lt;ref&gt;Yngve, Victor. "On getting a word in edgewise," page 568. Papers from the Sixth Regional Meeting [of the] Chicago Linguistic Society, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "backchannel" was designed to imply that there are two channels of [[communication]] operating simultaneously during a conversation.&lt;ref&gt;White, Sheida. "Backchannels across cultures: A study of Americans and Japanese ." Language in society (1989): 59-76.&lt;/ref&gt; The predominant channel is that of the speaker who directs primary speech flow. The secondary channel of communication (or backchannel) is that of the listener which functions to provide ''continuers'' or ''assessments'',&lt;ref&gt;Li, Han. "Patterns of Backchannel Responses in Canadian-Chinese Conversations" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Communication Association, TBA, San Francisco, CA, May 23, 2007 &lt;Not Available&gt;. 2009-02-04 &lt;http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p169308_index.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; defining a listener's comprehension and/or interest. Recent research, which can be seen below, has also suggested new terms for these two functions. They have proposed the term ''generic'' in place of ''continuers'' and ''specific'' in place of ''assessments''.

=== Applicability ===
Backchannel communication is present in all cultures and languages, though frequency and use may vary. Confusion or distraction can occur during an [[intercultural communication|intercultural]] encounter if participants from both parties are not accustomed to the same backchannel norms.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Nigel G. and Yaffa Al Bayyari. "American and Arab Perceptions of an Arabic Turn-Taking Cue." Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology (2010): 270-275.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of Backchannels ==
Due to research development in recent years,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iwasaki|first=S.|date=1997|title=The Northridge earthquake conversations: The floor structure and the ‘loop’ sequence in Japanese conversation|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216697000702|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|volume=28(6)|pages=661-693|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=English corpus linguistics: studies in honour of Jan Svartvik|last=Tottie|first=Gunnel|publisher=Longman|year=1991|isbn=|editor-last=Aijmer|editor-first=Karin|location=London|pages=254-271}}&lt;/ref&gt;  backchannel responses have been expanded to include sentence completions, requests for clarification, brief statements, and non-verbal responses and now fall into three categories: non-[[Word|lexical]], phrasal, and substantive.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Richard F. and Jina Lee. "Identifying units in interaction: Reactive tokens in Korean and English conversations." Journal of Sociolinguistics (2004): 380-407.&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Non-Lexical Backchannels ===
A non-lexical backchannel is a vocalized sound that has little or no referential meaning but still verbalizes the listener's attention, and that frequently co-occurs with gestures. In [[English language|English]], sounds like ''uh-huh'' and ''hmm'' serve this role. Non-lexical backchannels generally come from a limited set of sounds not otherwise widely used in contentful conversational speech; as a result, they can be used to express support, surprise, or a need for clarification at the same time as someone else's conversational turn without causing confusion or interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ward|first=Nigel|date=2006|title=Non-lexical conversational sounds in American English|url=|journal=Pragmatics &amp; Cognition|volume=14(1)|pages=129-182|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English allows for the [[reduplication]], or repetition, of syllables within a non-lexical backchannel, such as in responses like ''uh-huh'', ''mm-hm'', or ''um-hm'', as well as for single-syllable backchanneling. In a study examining the use of two-syllable backchannels that focused on ''mm'' and ''mm-hm'', Gardner found that the two tokens are generally not identical in function, with ''mm'' being used more productively as a continuer, a weak acknowledgment token, and a weak assessment marker. In contrast, ''mm-hm'' is generally used as a backchannel to signal that the speaker is yielding their conversational turn and allowing the other speaker to maintain control of the conversational floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gardner|first=Rod|date=1997|title=The Conversation Object Mm: A Weak and Variable Acknowledging Token|url=|journal=Research on Language and Social Interaction|volume=30(2)|pages=131-156|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phrasal &amp; Substantive Backchannels ===
Phrasal backchannels most commonly assess or acknowledge a speaker's communication with simple words or phrases (for example, "Really?" or "Wow!" in English). Substantive backchannels consist of more substantial [[Turn-Taking|turn-taking]] by the listener and usually manifest as asking for clarification or repetitions.

One of the conversational functions of phrasal backchannels is to assess or appraise a previous utterance. Goodwin argues that this is the case for the phrasal backchannel ''oh wow'', where use of the backchannel requires a specific conversational context where something unexpected or surprising was said. Similarly, more substantive backchannels such as ''oh come on, are you serious?'' require a context where the speaker is responding to something exasperating or frustrating. In both of these cases, Goodwin argues that the backchannels focus only on addressing some aspect of the immediately proceeding utterance rather than the larger conversation itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodwin|first=Charles|date=1986|title=Between and within: Alternative sequential treatments of continuers and assessments|url=|journal=Human Studies|volume=9|pages=205-217|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, they have a broad conversational distribution, appearing both in the middle of extended talk as well as at the end of longer conversational turns.

== Recent Research ==
More recent research has pushed back on the notion of backchannels, in which the listener's role is merely to receive information provided by the speaker. Bavelas, Coates, and Johnson&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bavelas|first=Janet B.|last2=Coates|first2=Linda|last3=Johnson|first3=Trudy|date=2000|title=Listeners as Co-Narrators|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=79|pages=941-952|via=EBSCOHost}}&lt;/ref&gt; put forth evidence that listeners' responses help shape the content of the speaker. They grouped acknowledgment tokens into two categories: generic and specific. Generic responses could be considered back channels and would include ''mm hm'' and ''yeah'', while specific responses would involve a reaction to the given context. Examples might include ''Oh!'' or a facial display of concern.

They transcribed students telling a fellow participant about a close call experience that they had had. With one group of participants, they had the listener perform another task to distract them from the story being told. The researchers asked independent reviewers to code the verbal and visual responses of the narration events as generic or specific. They also asked other independent reviewers to gauge the quality of the narration in each case.

They concluded that the responses from the distracted listeners included significantly fewer specific responses than from the undistracted listeners. In addition, they found that the quality of the narration was dramatically lower when the listener was distracted. Their basic contention was that listeners are co-narrators and help the storyteller in his or her narration. In other words, a storyteller tells a better story with an audience that is engaged than one that is not.

Tolins and Foxtree&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tolins|first=Jackson|last2=Fox Tree|first2=Jean E.|date=2014|title=Addressee backchannels steer narrative development|url=|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|volume=70|pages=152-164|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also published research demonstrating how backchannel communication influences speakers. Their research was specifically looking at how speakers respond to generic responses compared to specific responses.

'''''Bahasa''''', '''''bhasa''''', '''''basa''''', or '''''phasa''''' is the word for "language" in many Asian languages, which derives from the [[Sanskrit]] word भाषा ''{{IAST|bhāṣā}}'' "speech, spoken language". In many modern languages in [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]] which have been influenced by Sanskrit or [[Pali]], ''bahasa'' and cognate terms are used to mean "language" in general.

==Language names==

* [[Bahasa Rojak]] means "mixed language" in Malay
* [[Indonesian slang]] is sometimes referred to as ''bahasa gaul'' or ''bahasa prokem''

==Usage==
The word "Bahasa" in English is sometimes used to refer specifically to the [[Malay language]] (especially its [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] variety), usually by Western expatriates and their English-speaking Malaysian-Indonesian associates. This usage is of colonial origin, has never gained currency in linguistic circles and is considered incorrect by some.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050508115242/http://www.hawaii.edu/indolang/malay.html "Bahasa Indonesia: The Indonesian Language," George Quinn, Australian National University]&lt;/ref&gt; When Malaysian or Indonesian speakers refer to other languages, the non-capitalized word "bahasa" ("language") is used; for example, English and Italian are called ''bahasa Inggris'' and ''bahasa Italia'' respectively.

[[File:Bannwald BaWue Schild.jpg|thumb|Information sign]]
'''''Bannwald''''' is a German word used in parts of Germany and Austria to designate an area of protected forest. Its precise meaning has varied by location and over time.

== Etymology ==
The word ''Bannwald'' is a combination of ''Bann'' (English ''ban'') and ''Wald'' (English ''forest'' or ''wood''). ''Bann'' has many historical meanings in German, one of which refers to an area controlled by and set aside for the use of a landowner in medieval times (comparable to the forests subject to the royal ban in Anglo-Saxon England).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[John Mitchell Kemble]]|title=The Saxons in England: A History of the English Commonwealth Till the Period of the Norman Conquest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aGGZGJBRT-8C&amp;pg|date=1849|publisher=[[Longman]]|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Bannwald'' was a forest where a nobleman had the prerogative to make use of it and the creatures in it.&lt;ref name="Forestry"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Porteous|title=The Forest in Folklore and Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UZyjAQAAQBAJ|date=1928|publisher=[[Courier Dover Publications]]|isbn=978-0486420103|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; A royal ban forest existed at Dreieich (from the heathen worship of three oaks) for a very long period, and its charter was one of the most primitive.&lt;ref name="Forestry"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Jacob Grimm]]|title=Teutonic Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I2WhHX2peKEC|date=1835|publisher=[[Nabu Press]]|isbn=978-1171888192|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The (obsolete) [[French language|French]] literal equivalent [[:fr:bambois (toponyme)|''bambois'']] (also: ''banbois'')&lt;ref&gt;[[University of Lorraine]]: [http://docnum.univ-lorraine.fr/public/DDOC_T_2012_0207_TAVELLA_ANNEXES.pdf Page 9, Glossaire: Bambois, Banbois]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry Suter: [http://henrysuter.ch/glossaires/topoB0.html Toponymes: Baimbo, Bambois, Banbois]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Courrendlin]]: [http://www.courrendlin.ch/fr/Vivre-a-Courrendlin/Geographie/Lieux-dits/Lieux-dits.html Lieux-dits - Le Bambois: Forêt réservée et mise à ban]&lt;/ref&gt; is still the toponym of local forests&lt;ref&gt;Tous les Faits: [http://tous-les-faits.fr/bambois_(toponyme) Bambois (toponyme)]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205051047/http://tous-les-faits.fr/bambois_%28toponyme%29 |date=December 5, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in areas which once were part of the former [[Holy Roman Empire]].

In modern times, the term ''Bannwald'' is, in a certain sense, an archaic word which has been revived as a specific term for forests under various types of protection.

== Scope ==
The term is generally used with a rather broad meaning:
* ''[[Protection forest]]'', for the protection against avalanches, [[rockfall]], [[mudflow]], or [[flooding]]
* ''[[Forest reserve]]'', forest areas protected for reasons of [[nature conservation]] and [[environmental protection]]
* ''[[Protected forest|Recreational forest]]'', sometimes also as [[recreation area]]

Depending on the respective forest act, there may be an overlapping or difference in meaning between the terms ''banned forest'' and ''protection forest''.

== Function ==
[[File:Sebalder Reichswald Bannwald-Denkmal 001.JPG|thumb|Banned forest monument in the imperial forest of Nuremberg]]

[[Silvicultural]] use is still permitted and in the case of protection forests it is even welcome (except in [[Baden-Württemberg]]). However, it is prohibited in the core zones of [[nature reserves in Germany|nature reserves]]. ''[[exclusion zone|Forestal exclusion zones]]'' (temporarily restricted forest areas) subject to hunting prohibitions or restrictions, or temporary ''[[hunting|hunting grounds]]'' or ''[[game preserve]]s'' (areas closed during a [[hunting season]] or [[breeding season|breeding and upbringing season]]) are not classified as banned forests.

== History ==

The term ''Bann'' dates back to the [[Middle Ages]]. At that time a ''Bannwald'' referred to a forest area where the respective [[territorial lord]] had the exclusive right to use the forest (''forest privilege''). Originally this applied only to hunting (''hunting privilege'') and fishing, however, later it was extended to the complete use of the forest. In the mountain valleys of [[Switzerland]] banned forests had the function to protect against avalanches and also to provide sufficient timber for [[fencing]] torrents. Corresponding decrees from the 14th century deal with protection against avalanches, rockfalls and flooding. The concept of ''Bannwald'' plays an important part in [[Ludwig Ganghofer]]'s novel ''Die Martinsklause'' in which a tyrannical administrator in [[Berchtesgaden]] claims excessive privileges.

== Countries ==

=== Germany ===

==== Baden-Württemberg ====
[[Image:Bannwald BaWue Schlattstall.JPG|thumb|Banned forest with footpath in Baden-Württemberg]]
→ ''see also: [[:de:Liste der Bannwälder in Baden-Württemberg|List of Bannwälder in Baden-Württemberg]]''

In Baden-Württemberg, there are ''Bannwälder Totalreservate'', fully protected reserves where any use is strictly prohibited by law. In other federal states of Germany such ''total reserves'' are known under different names. Due to their structural diversity in living trees and dry wood banned forests are [[refugium (population biology)|refugia]] for many endangered species of animals, plants, and mushrooms.

==== Bavaria ====
In [[Bavaria]] "forest and its existence and size is extremely essential in particular in densely populated and sparsely wooded areas and consequently its size and structure must be preserved as it is of extraordinary importance for the climate, water resources or for air purification" and may be classified as banned forest."&lt;ref name=BayWald&gt;[https://archive.is/20130106012238/http://www.servicestelle.bayern.de/bayern_recht/recht_db.html?http://by.juris.de/by/WaldG_BY_2005_Art38.htm Bavarian Forestry Act of July 22, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hessen ====
[[Image:Bannwald rockenberg4.jpg|thumb|Information sign in [[Rockenberg]] (Hesse)]]
In [[Hesse]] a ''Bannwald'' is a forest which because of its location, size and extraordinary importance for hydrological balance, climate and air purification has to be preserved and may be cut only in exceptional cases.

=== Austria ===
In Austria, a ''Bannwald'' is a stricter form of a protection forest.&lt;ref&gt;Article 21 et seq. of the 1975 Forestry Act.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Switzerland ===
The Swiss Forestry Act of 1874 uses the term, '''''Schutzwald''''' ([[protection forest]]), rather than ''Bannwald''.

'''Cluttering''' (also called '''tachyphemia''' or '''tachyphrasia''') is a [[speech disorder|speech]] and [[communication disorder]] characterized by a rapid rate of speech, erratic rhythm, and poor [[syntax]] or grammar, making speech difficult to understand.

==Classification==
Cluttering is a [[speech disorder|speech]] and [[communication disorder]] that has also been described as a [[fluency]] disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is defined as:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Cluttering is a fluency disorder characterized by a rate that is perceived to be abnormally rapid, irregular, or both for the speaker (although measured syllable rates may not exceed normal limits). These rate abnormalities further are manifest in one or more of the following symptoms: (a) an excessive number of [[disfluencies]], the majority of which are not typical of people with [[stuttering]]; (b) the frequent placement of pauses and use of [[prosodic|prosodic patterns]] that do not conform to [[syntactic]] and [[semantic]] constraints; and (c) inappropriate (usually excessive) degrees of [[coarticulation]] among sounds, especially in multisyllabic words".&lt;ref&gt;St. Louis, K. O., Myers, F. L., Bakker, K., &amp; Raphael, L. J. (2007). Understanding and treating cluttering. In E. G. Conture &amp; R. F. Curlee (Eds.) Stuttering and related disorders of fluency, 3rd ed. (pp. 297-325). NY: Thieme.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[Stuttering]] is often misapplied as a common term referring to any dysfluency. It is also often incorrectly applied to normal dysfluency rather than dysfluency from a disorder.  Cluttered speech is exhibited by normal speakers, and is often referred to as stuttering. This is especially true when the speaker is nervous, where nervous speech more closely resembles cluttering than stuttering.

Cluttering is sometimes confused with stuttering. Both communication disorders break the normal flow of speech, but they are distinct. A stutterer has a coherent pattern of thoughts, but may have a difficult time vocally expressing those thoughts; in contrast, a clutterer has no problem putting thoughts into words, but those thoughts become disorganized during speaking. Cluttering affects not only speech, but also thought patterns, writing, typing, and conversation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stammering.org/cluttered.html When speech is too cluttered - British Stammering Association&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511151645/http://www.stammering.org/cluttered.html |date=2008-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stutterers are usually dysfluent on initial sounds, when beginning to speak, and become more fluent towards the ends of utterances. In contrast, clutterers are most clear at the start of utterances, but their speaking rate increases and intelligibility decreases towards the end of utterances.

Stuttering is characterized by struggle behavior, such as overtense speech production muscles. Cluttering, in contrast, is effortless.  Cluttering is also characterized by [[Relaxed pronunciation|slurred speech]], especially dropped or distorted /r/ and /l/ sounds; and monotone speech that starts loud and trails off into a murmur.

A clutterer described the feeling associated with a clutter as:
{{cquote|It feels like 1) about twenty thoughts explode on my mind all at once, and I need to express them all, 2) that when I'm trying to make a point, that I just remembered something that I was supposed to say, so the person can understand, and I need to interrupt myself to say something that I should have said before, and 3) that I need to constantly revise the sentences that I'm working on, to get it out right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Differential diagnosis==
Cluttering can often be confused with [[language delay]], [[language disorder]], [[learning disabilities]], and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Clutterers often have [[reading disabilities|reading]] and writing disabilities, especially sprawling, disorderly handwriting, which poorly integrate ideas and space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.content.onlypunjab.com/Article/Fluency-Disorders--Stuttering-vs-Cluttering/4200320092003249120 Fluency Disorders: Stuttering vs Cluttering&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120729022709/http://www.content.onlypunjab.com/Article/Fluency-Disorders--Stuttering-vs-Cluttering/4200320092003249120 |date=2012-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Because clutterers have poor awareness of their disorder, they may be indifferent or even hostile to speech-language pathologists. [[Delayed auditory feedback]] (DAF) is usually used to produce a more deliberate, exaggerated oral-motor response pattern. Other treatment components include improving [[narrative structure]] with [[Storytelling|story-telling]] [[picture book]]s, turn-taking practice, pausing practice, and language therapy.

==History==
[[Battaros]] was a legendary [[Libya]]n king who spoke quickly and in a disorderly fashion.  Others who spoke as he did were said to suffer from ''battarismus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the earliest record of the speech disorder of cluttering.

In the 1960s, cluttering was called ''tachyphemia'', a word derived from the Greek for "fast speech". This word is no longer used to describe cluttering because fast speech is not a required element of cluttering.

Deso Weiss described cluttering as the outward manifestation of a "central language imbalance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The First World Conference on Cluttering was held in May 2007 in [[Razlog]], [[Bulgaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had over 60 participants from North America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wvutoday.wvu.edu/n/2007/07/16/5871 WVU researcher hopes to have the last word on 'cluttering' speech disorder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215150643/http://wvutoday.wvu.edu/n/2007/07/16/5871 |date=2015-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
Weiss claimed that Battaros, [[Demosthenes]], [[Pericles]], [[Justinian]], [[Otto von Bismarck]], and [[Winston Churchill]] were clutterers.  He says about these people, "Each of these contributors to [[World History|world history]] viewed his world holistically, and was not deflected by exaggerated attention to small details.  Perhaps then, they excelled because of, rather than in spite of, their

'''Critical applied linguistics''' ('''CALx''') is an interdisciplinary critical approach to [[English language|English]] [[applied linguistics]]. One of the central concerns in this approach is exposing the political dimensions and power relations involved in  mainstream applied linguistics, in areas like language teaching, language policy and planning, language testing, language rights, and so on.

'''Elective mutism''' is a now outdated term which was defined as a refusal to speak in almost all social situations (despite normal ability to do so), while [[selective mutism]] was considered to be a ''failure'' to speak in specific situations and is strongly associated with [[social anxiety disorder]].  In contrast to selective mutism, it was thought someone who was electively mute may not speak in any situation, as is usually shown in books and movies.  Elective mutism was often attributed to defiance or the effect of [[Psychological trauma|trauma]]. Those who are able to speak freely in some situations but not in others are now better described by [[selective mutism]]&lt;ref&gt;Selective Mutism Resource Manual, Second Edition, Routledge, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
In 1877, a German physician named the disorder ''aphasia voluntaria'' to describe children who were able to speak normally but often "refused" to.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brighttots.com/Selective_Mutism.html Bright Tots: Selective Mutism&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, a study by [[Torey Hayden]] identified four "subtypes" of Elective Mutism:&lt;ref&gt;Torey Hayden. [http://www.torey-hayden.com/research/classification-of-elective-mutism.pdf Classification of elective mutism]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Symbiotic mutism: the most common form, caused by a vocal and dominating mother and absent father (very rarely the other way around) and characterized by the use of mutism as controlling behavior around other adults.
*Speech phobic mutism: the least common, in which the child showed distinct fear at hearing a recording of his or her voice.  This also involved ritualistic behaviors, which may reflect OCD, and was thought to be caused by the child having been told to keep a family secret.
*Reactive mutism: a reaction to trauma and/or abuse, with all children showing symptoms of depression and being notably withdrawn, usually showing no facial expressions.  Notably, Hayden admits that some children put in this category had no apparent incident to react to, but they were included because of their symptoms.
*Passive-aggressive mutism: silence is used as a display of hostility, connected to antisocial behavior.  Some of the children in her study had reportedly not been mute until age 9-12.

The ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM), first published in 1952, first included Elective Mutism in its third edition, published in 1980.  Elective mutism was described as "a continuous refusal to speak in almost all social situations" despite normal ability to speak.  While "excessive shyness" and other anxiety-related traits were listed as associated features, predisposing factors included "maternal overprotection", mental retardation, and trauma.  Elective mutism in the third edition revised (DSM III-R) is described similarly as in the third edition except for specifying that the disorder is ''not'' related to social anxiety disorder.

In 1994, the fourth edition of the DSM reflected the name change to selective mutism and redefined the disorder.

==Cultural references==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2012}}
Though elective mutism is no longer recognized by most psychiatrists, it is a popular character element or plot point in stories and movies.  Many characters choose to stop speaking, for various reasons.  Even more commonly, there are also characters who stop speaking after a traumatic incident.  In both these cases, often, and almost always in the second, the character is silent in all situations.  This is therefore not selective mutism, and anxiety is very rarely involved. Selective mutism itself is almost nonexistent in pop culture.

The following are a few references to stories including a character who does not speak despite being physically able to.

* In the book ''[[Cut (novel)|Cut]]'' by Patricia McCormick, the main character, Callie, is an elective mute.
* In ''[[The House of the Spirits]]'' by [[Isabel Allende]], Clara Trueba is mute after witnessing her sisters molestation and autopsy. "She could not move until the first lights of dawn appeared. Only then did she slip back into her bed, feeling within her the silence of the entire world. Silence filled her utterly."
*In ''[[Hannibal Rising]]'' by [[Thomas Harris]], [[Hannibal Lecter]] is mute after witnessing his sister killed and eaten.
* In the book ''[[Flying Solo (Fletcher novel)|Flying Solo]]'', the character Rachel is mute for six months after a classmate dies.
* In ''[[The Piano (film)|The Piano]]'', Ada is an elective mute. She chooses to learn to speak at the end of the film.
* In the 1993 movie, ''[[House of Cards (1993 film)|House of Cards]]'', Sally Matthews chooses not to speak after her father dies.
* In the book ''[[Halo: Ghosts of Onyx]]'', Lucy-B091 is mute after she is one of only two survivors from her unit of 300.
* In the movie ''[[The Prophet (2014 film)|The Prophet]]'' Kamila's daughter, Elmitra, is depicted as mute after the death of her father.
* In the 2014 video game ''[[Watch Dogs]]'', Aiden Pearce's nephew, Jackson, is electively mute after the death of his sister.
* In the book ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]'', Christian Grey is depicted as having been an elective mute from age 4, when he witnessed his birth mother's drug overdose and death and was with her body for days before being discovered, until he was 6 years old and he spoke his newly-adopted baby sister's name.
*In [[John Green (author)|John Green]]'s narrative YouTube series Swindon Town Swoodilypoopers, midfielder Maric Maric is selectively mute.

'''Eratosphere''' is the largest online free-to-join workshop for formal poetry.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Additionally, it is a forum for free verse, poetry and prose translation, fiction, art, literary criticism and critical discussions on writing. It was founded in 1999 by Alexander Pepple as a workshop complement to [[Able Muse]]. Eratosphere moderators have included some of the best known formal poets, including Marilyn Taylor—The Poet Laureate of Wisconsin, [[A. M. Juster]], [[A. E. Stallings]], [[R. S. Gwynn]], and several others.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The Distinguished Guest forum has hosted and continues to host presentations, and discussions with renowned writers and poets such as [[Richard Wilbur]]—a former US Poet Laureate and two-time winner of the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]], the late [[Anthony Hecht]], [[Timothy Steele]], [[Charles Martin (poet)|Charles Martin]], [[X. J. Kennedy]] and others,{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} and these discussions are permanently archived and accessible online.

{{italic title}}
'''''Etymologicum Magnum''''' ({{lang-el|Ἐτυμολογικὸν Μέγα}}, ''Ἐtymologikὸn Mέga'') (standard abbreviation '''''EM''''', or '''''Etym. M.''''' in older literature) is the traditional title of a Greek lexical [[encyclopedia]] compiled at [[Constantinople]] by an unknown [[lexicographer]] around 1150 AD. It is the largest Byzantine lexicon and draws on many earlier grammatical, lexical and rhetorical works. Its main sources were two previous ''etymologica'', the so-called ''[[Etymologicum Genuinum]]'' and the ''[[Etymologicum Gudianum]]''. Other sources include [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], the ''Epitome'' of [[Diogenianus]], the so-called ''Lexicon'' Αἱμωδεῖν (''Haimōdeῖn''), Eulogius’ Ἀπορίαι καὶ λύσεις (''Ἀporίai kaὶ lύseis''), [[Georgius Choeroboscus|George Choeroboscus]]’ ''Epimerismi ad Psalmos'', the ''Etymologicon'' of [[Orion of Thebes]], and collections of [[Scholion|''scholia'']].&lt;ref&gt;Reitzenstein (1897), 248–253, 351–352; Sturz (1820)&lt;/ref&gt; The compiler of the ''Etymologicum Magnum'' was not a mere copyist; rather he amalgamated, reorganised, augmented and freely modified his source material to create a new and individual work.

The ''[[editio princeps]]'' of the ''Etymologicum Magnum'' was published by [[Zacharias Calliergi|Zacharias Kallierges]] and [[Nikolaos Vlastos]] under the patronage of [[Anna Notaras]] at [[Venice]] in 1499. The typeface was designed and cut by Kallierges, modeled on his own handwriting. The decorative initial letters and headpieces are patterned on the decorations of the Byzantine manuscript tradition, and the woodcut borders incorporate elaborate arabesque designs, usually colored white on red, but also white on gold. The decorations of the Kallierges edition had a great influence in printing, especially on Greek liturgical books.&lt;ref&gt;Ecro Layton, ''Five Centuries of Books and Manuscripts in Modern Greek: A Catalogue of an Exhibition at the Houghton Library December 4, 1987, through February 17, 1988'' (Cambridge: Harvard College Library, 1990), pp. 39-41&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent complete edition is by [[Thomas Gaisford]] (Oxford 1848).&lt;ref&gt;T. Gaisford (ed.), ''Etymologicum Magnum'' (Oxford 1848; repr. Amsterdam 1965)&lt;/ref&gt; A new (uncompleted) edition is in preparation  by F. Lasserre and N. Livadaras (under the title ''Etymologicum Magnum Auctum'').&lt;ref&gt;F. Lasserre and N. Livadaras (eds.), ''Etymologicum Magnum Genuinum, Symeonis Etymologicum una cum Magna Grammatica, Etymologicum Magnum Auctum'', vol. 1 (Rome 1976); 2 (Athens 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fact''' is something that is consistent with objective [[reality]] or that can be proven with [[evidence]]. The usual test for a statement of fact is verifiability — that is whether it can be demonstrated to correspond to [[experience]]. Standard reference works are often used to check facts. [[Science|Scientific]] facts are verified by repeatable careful observation or measurement by [[experiments]] or other means.

== Etymology and usage ==
The word "fact" derives from the Latin ''factum'', and was first used in English with the same meaning: ''a thing done or performed'' a meaning now obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;"Fact". OED_2d_Ed_1989, (but note the conventional uses: ''after the fact'' and ''before the fact'').&lt;/ref&gt;  The common usage of "something that has really occurred or is the case" dates from the middle of the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (1a). OED_2d_Ed_1989 Joye ''Exp. Dan.'' xi. Z vij b, ''Let emprours and kinges know this godly kynges fact. 1545''&lt;/ref&gt;

Fact is sometimes used synonymously with ''[[truth]]'', as distinct from opinions, falsehoods, or matters of taste.  This use is found in such phrases as, "''It is a fact that the cup is blue"'' or "''Matter of fact"'',&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (4a) OED_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt; and "...&amp;nbsp;not history, nor fact, but imagination." Filmmaker [[Werner Herzog]] distinguishes between the two, claiming that "Fact creates norms, and truth illumination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wernerherzog.com/52.html |title=Werner Herzog Film: Statements / Texts |publisher=Wernerherzog.com |date=1999-04-30 |accessdate=2014-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715011254/http://www.wernerherzog.com/52.html |archivedate=2014-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fact also indicates a ''matter under discussion'' deemed to be true or correct, such as to emphasize a point or prove a disputed issue; (e.g., "...&amp;nbsp;the ''fact'' of the matter is ...").&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (6c). OED_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(See also "Matter" (2,6). Compact_OED)&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, ''fact'' may also indicate an ''allegation or stipulation'' of something that may or may not be a ''true fact'',&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (5). OED_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., "the author's facts are not trustworthy"). This alternate usage, although contested by some, has a long history in standard English.&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', "Fact has a long history of usage in the sense 'allegation'" AHD_4th_Ed. The OED dates this use to 1729.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fact may also indicate findings derived through a ''process of evaluation'', including review of testimony, direct observation, or otherwise; as distinguishable from matters of inference or speculation.&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (6a). OED_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt; This use is reflected in the terms "fact-find" and "fact-finder" (e.g., "set up a [[fact-finding]] commission").&lt;ref&gt;"Fact" (8). OED_2d_Ed_1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Facts may be checked by reason, experiment, personal experience, or may be argued from authority.  [[Roger Bacon]] wrote "If in other sciences we should arrive at certainty without doubt and truth without error, it behooves us to place the foundations of knowledge in mathematics."&lt;ref&gt;Roger Bacon, translated by Robert Burke ''Opus Majus'', Book I, Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In philosophy==

In [[philosophy]], the concept ''fact'' is considered in [[epistemology]] and [[ontology]]. Questions of [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] and truth are closely associated with questions of fact. A "fact" can be defined as something that is the case—that is, a [[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;"A fact, it might be said, is a state of affairs that is the case or obtains." – [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/states-of-affairs/ Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy. ''States of Affairs'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Wittgenstein, ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]],'' Proposition 2: What is the case -- a fact -- is the existence of states of affairs.&lt;/ref&gt;

Facts may be understood as information that makes a true sentence true.&lt;ref&gt;"A fact is, traditionally, the worldly correlate of a true proposition, a state of affairs whose obtaining makes that proposition true." – ''Fact'' in The Oxford Companion to Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; Facts may also be understood as those things to which a true sentence refers. The statement "Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system" is ''about'' the fact Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Oliver, ''Fact'', in {{cite book
| title     = Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy
| first     = Edward
| last      = Craig
| publisher = Routledge, Oxford
| year      = 2005
| isbn        = 0-415-32495-5
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Correspondence and the slingshot argument===

[[Pascal Engel|Pascal Engel's]] version of the [[correspondence theory of truth]] explains that what makes a sentence true is that it ''corresponds'' to a fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title     = Truth
| first     = Pascal
| last      = Engel
| publisher = McGill-Queen's Press- MQUP
| year      = 2002
| isbn        = 0-7735-2462-2
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This theory presupposes the existence of an objective world.

The [[Slingshot argument]] claims to show that all true statements stand for the same thing - the [[truth value]] ''true''. If this argument holds, and facts are taken to be what true statements stand for, then we reach the counter-intuitive conclusion that there is only one fact - ''the truth''.&lt;ref&gt;The argument is presented in many places, but see for example [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Davidson]], ''Truth and Meaning'', in {{cite book
| title     = Truth and Interpretation
| first     = Donald
| last      = Davidson
| publisher = Clarendon Press, Oxford
| year      = 1984
| isbn        = 0-19-824617-X
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compound facts===

Any non-trivial true statement about [[reality]] is necessarily an abstraction composed of a complex of [[object (philosophy)|objects]] and [[property (philosophy)|properties]] or [[logic of relatives|relations]].&lt;ref&gt;"Facts possess internal structure, being complexes of objects and properties or relations" Oxford Companion to Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the fact described by the true statement "[[Paris]] is the capital city of [[France]]" implies that there is such a place as Paris, there is such a place as France, there are such things as capital cities, as well as that France has a government, that the government of France has the power to define its capital city, and that the French government has chosen Paris to be the capital, that there is such a thing as a ''place'' or a ''government'', and so on.  The verifiable accuracy of all of these assertions, if facts themselves, may coincide to create the fact that Paris is the capital of France.

Difficulties arise, however, in attempting to identify the constituent parts of negative, modal, disjunctive, or moral facts.&lt;ref&gt;''Fact'', in ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'', Ted Honderich, editor. (Oxford, 1995) {{ISBN|0-19-866132-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fact–value distinction===
{{main|Fact–value distinction}}
Moral philosophers since [[David Hume#Ethics|David Hume]] have debated whether values are objective, and thus factual. In ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' Hume pointed out there is no obvious way for a series of statements about what ''ought'' to be the case to be derived from a series of statements of what ''is'' the case. Those who insist there is a logical gulf between [[Fact-value distinction|facts and values]], such that it is fallacious to attempt to derive values from facts, include [[G. E. Moore]], who called attempting to do so the [[naturalistic fallacy]].

===Factual–counterfactual distinction===
{{main|Counterfactual conditional}}

Factuality—what has occurred—can also be contrasted with counterfactuality:
what ''might have'' occurred, but did not. A counterfactual conditional or subjunctive conditional is a conditional (or "if-then") statement indicating what ''would be'' the case if events had been other than they were. For example, "If Alexander had lived, his empire would have been greater than Rome." This contrasts with an indicative conditional, which indicates what ''is'' (in fact) the case if its antecedent ''is'' (in fact) true—for example, "If you drink this, it will make you well."

Such sentences are important to [[modal logic]], especially since the development of [[possible world]] semantics.

==In science==
{{further|scientific method|philosophy of science}}

In science, a ''fact'' is a repeatable careful observation or measurement (by experimentation or other means), also called [[empirical evidence]].  Facts are central to building [[scientific theories]].  Various forms of observation and measurement lead to fundamental questions about the [[scientific method]], and the scope and validity of [[Philosophy of science|scientific reasoning]].

In the most basic sense, a scientific ''fact'' is an objective and verifiable observation, in contrast with a ''[[hypothesis]]'' or ''[[theory]]'', which is intended to explain or interpret facts.&lt;ref name="Gower000"&gt;{{cite book
| title     = Scientific Method: A Historical and Philosophical Introduction
| first     = Barry
| last      = Gower
| publisher = Routledge
| year      = 1997
| isbn        = 0-415-12282-1
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various [[scholars]] have offered significant refinements to this basic formulation.  Scientists are careful to distinguish between: 1) ''states of affairs'' in the external world and 2) ''assertions'' of fact that may be considered relevant in scientific analysis. The term is used in both senses in the philosophy of science.&lt;ref name="Ravetz000"&gt;{{cite book
| title     = Scientific Knowledge and Its Social Problems
| first     = Jerome Raymond
| last      = Ravetz
| publisher = Transaction Publishers
| year      = 1996
| isbn        = 1-56000-851-2
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars and clinical researchers in both the social and natural sciences have written about numerous questions and theories that arise in the attempt to clarify the fundamental nature of scientific fact.&lt;ref&gt;(Gower 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Pertinent issues raised by this inquiry include:
* the process by which "established fact" becomes recognized and accepted as such;&lt;ref&gt;(see e.g., Ravetz, p. 182 fn. 1)&lt;/ref&gt;
* whether and to what extent "fact" and "theoretic explanation" can be considered truly independent and separable from one another;&lt;ref&gt;Ravetz, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gower, p. 138"&gt;Gower, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;
* to what extent "facts" are influenced by the mere act of observation;&lt;ref name="Gower, p. 138"/&gt; and
* to what extent factual conclusions are influenced by history and consensus, rather than a strictly systematic methodology.&lt;ref&gt;Gower, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Consistent with the idea of [[confirmation holism]], some scholars assert "fact" to be necessarily "theory-laden" to some degree. [[Thomas Kuhn]] points out that knowing what facts to measure, and how to measure them, requires the use of other theories. For example, the age of [[fossils]] is based on [[radiometric dating]], which is justified by reasoning that radioactive decay follows a [[Poisson process]] rather than a [[Bernoulli process]]. Similarly, [[Percy Williams Bridgman]] is credited with the methodological position known as operationalism, which asserts that all observations are not only influenced, but necessarily defined by the means and assumptions used to measure them.

=== The scientific method ===
Apart from the fundamental inquiry into the nature of scientific fact, there remain the practical and social considerations of how fact is investigated, established, and substantiated through the proper application of the scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;Ravetz p. 181 et. seq. (Chapter Six: "Facts and their evolution")&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific facts are generally believed independent of the observer: no matter who performs a scientific experiment, all observers agree on the outcome.&lt;ref name="The Nature of Suffering and the Goals of Medicine"&gt;Cassell, Eric J. [https://books.google.com/books?id=K1kjFYrliTMC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;ots=3V6-UmUFmP&amp;dq=%22scientific+fact&amp;sig=YtQTgNbisFSQ1QfV-JNkmW7D0n4#PPA181,M1 The Nature of Suffering and the Goals of Medicine] ''[[Oxford University Press]]''. Retrieved 16 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to these considerations, there are the social and institutional measures, such as peer review and accreditation, that are intended to promote ''factual accuracy'' (among other interests) in scientific study.&lt;ref&gt;(Ravetz 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

== In history ==
{{further|Historiography}}

A common rhetorical cliché states, "[[History is written by the winners]]." This phrase suggests but does not examine the use of facts in the writing of history.

[[E. H. Carr]] in his 1961 volume ''[[What is History?]]'' argues that the inherent biases from the gathering of facts makes the objective truth of any historical [[perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] [[idealistic]] and impossible. Facts are, "like fish in the Ocean," of which we may only happen to catch a few, only an indication of what is below the surface. Even a dragnet cannot tell us for certain what it would be like to live below the Ocean's surface. Even if we do not discard any facts (or fish) presented, we will always miss the majority; the site of our fishing, the methods undertaken, the weather and even luck play a vital role in what we will catch. Additionally, the composition of history is inevitably made up by the compilation of many different biases of fact finding - all compounded over time. He concludes that for a historian to attempt a more objective method, one must accept that history can only aspire to a conversation of the present with the past - and that one's methods of fact gathering should be openly examined.  Historical truth and facts therefore change over time, and reflect only the present consensus (if that).

Nevertheless, the principles described herein have analogous treatment in other legal systems (such as [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems) as well.&lt;/ref&gt; the general concept and analysis of fact reflects fundamental principles of [[jurisprudence]], and is supported by several well-established standards.&lt;ref name="Estrich000"&gt;{{cite book

=== Legal pleadings ===
{{main|Pleading}}
A party to a civil suit generally must clearly state all relevant allegations of fact that form the basis of a [[Claim (legal)|claim]]. The requisite level of precision and particularity of these allegations varies, depending on the rules of civil procedure and jurisdiction. Parties who face uncertainties regarding facts and circumstances attendant to their side in a dispute may sometimes invoke alternative pleading.&lt;ref&gt;Roy W. McDonald, ''Alternative Pleading in the United States: I'' Columbia Law Review, Vol. 52, No. 4 (Apr., 1952), pp. 443-478&lt;/ref&gt; In this situation, a party may plead separate sets of facts that (when considered together) may be contradictory or mutually exclusive. This (seemingly) logically-inconsistent presentation of facts may be necessary as a safeguard against contingencies (such as ''[[res judicata]]'') that would otherwise preclude presenting a claim or defense that depends on a particular interpretation of the underlying facts.&lt;ref&gt;(McDonald 1952)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Feminist language reform''' or '''feminist language planning''' refers to the effort, often of political and [[grassroots]] movements, to change how [[language]] is used to [[gender]] people, activities and ideas on an [[individual]] and societal level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liddicoat|first1=A.

== History ==
[[Linguistics|Linguistic]] activism and feminist authorship stemming from [[second-wave feminism|second wave feminism]] in the 1960s and 70s began to draw attention to [[gender bias]] in [[language]], including "the uncovering of the gendered nature of many linguistic rules and norms".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Linguistic Sexism and Feminist Linguistic Activism|last = Pauwels|first = Anne|date = 2003|journal = The Handbook and Language of Gender|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarship such as [[Dennis Baron|Dennis Baron's]] "Grammar and Gender" and Anne Bodine's "Androcentrism in Prescriptive Grammar" uncovered historical [[male]] regulation to promote [[Patriarchy|male-centric]] language such as the use of "[[he]]" as a generic pronoun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Grammar and Gender|last = Baron|first = Dennis|publisher = Yale University Press|year = 1987|isbn = |location = New Haven, CT|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Androcentrism in prescriptive [[grammar]]: singular ‘they’, sex-indefinite ‘he’, and ‘he or she’|last = Bodine|first = Anne|date = 1975|journal = Language in Society|doi = 10.1017/s0047404500004607|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exposition and analysis of [[sexism]] in language through a [[grassroots]] feminist linguistics movement continued throughout the 80's and 90's, including study across languages and [[Speech community|speech communities]] such as Germany and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Gender and Language in Germany|last = Leue|first = Elisabeth|date = 2000|journal = Journal of Contemporary Central and Eastern Europe|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The [[battle]] of [[feminism]] and bon usage: instituting nonsexist usage in French|last = Fleischman|first = S.|date = 1997|journal = French Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Study and documentation of gendered language has since spread to cover over 30 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender across languages The linguistic representation of women and men|last = Hellinger|first = M.|publisher = John Benjamin's Publishing Company|year = 2001|isbn = |location = Amsterdam, The Netherlands|pages = Preface|last2 = Bußmann|first2 = H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist language planning has more recently been instituted centrally in countries such as [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Australia]], with mixed results.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Sweden have made strides towards shifting their language to fit a less misogynistic society. In the Swedish language, there has never been a word for the female genitalia or even a translation of the word “vagina”, even though the word ''snopp'' translates to “penis” and has been used as such since the 1960s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through history, there have been many slang terms used for the woman’s genitalia, including words such as ''fitta'' translated to “cunt”, ''där nere'' translated to “down-there”, and even ''mus'' translated to “mouse”. In the 1990s, Swedish media started to bring the absence of such a word to light. It wasn’t until the early 2000s did the feminists and activists start using the word ''snippa'' to be identified with the female genitalia. ''Snippa''’s origins can be traced back to many different Swedish dialects. It’s popular definition “refers to something small and/or narrow, for example a small pike or a narrow boat”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In regards to genitalia, “it might have been used to refer to female genitalia of cows and pigs in the early twentieth century”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since the popularization of using the word ''Snippa,'' the Swedish Academy added the word to the 2006 Swedish Language Dictionary.

Some language reformers directly work with identifying and changing sexist undertones and patriarchal vocabulary through a method called “linguistic disruption”.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; An example: In the United States, the word “herstory” became popularized “to refer to history which is not only about men”.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Sweden has also showed efforts in language planning regarding changing misogynistic undertones in their vocabulary. The Swedish Association for Sexuality Education has promoted the word ''slidkrans'' to replace the word for “hymen”, ''mödomshinna.'' “The new word, ''slidkrans'', is made up of the two parts ''slid'', translating to “vaginal” and ''krans'', translating to “garland”. It lacks the connotations of the ideology of virginity and honour attached to mödomshinna.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Additionally, Sweden has also shown efforts in accepting more of a non-gender binary identity by creating the gender-neutral pronoun ''hen,'' which has been used by feminists and the LGBT community. Feminist language reform regarding gender is not of recent efforts. Early feminist language reformists have been fighting the male-dominant approach to language and raising awareness to the public about the gendered structure of the society’s language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An interdisciplinary bibliography on language, gender, and sexuality|last=Motschenbacher|first=Heiko|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|year=2012|isbn=9789027273154|location=|pages=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia has been identified as a nation that officially promotes the feminist influence to its public bureaucracy by implementing feminist language reform across many institutions.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winter|first=Jo|date=December 23, 2010|title='Trajectories of Agency' and Discursive Identities in Education: A Critical Site in Feminist Language Planning|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/citedby/10.2167/cilp093.0#tabModule|journal=Current Issues in Language Planning|volume=|pages=171–198|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since this planned social shift, Australia has seen changes in political and government leadership that aim to interfere with this reform, such as a shift towards a conservative-leaning government.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; There are shifts that come from such movements that support them as well, such as the gender-neutral pronoun “they” being more widely accepted.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

The ongoing feminist movement acknowledges language as a “powerful instrument of patriarchy”.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pauwels|first=Anne|date=1999-11-14|title=Feminist Language Planning: Has it been worthwhile?|url=https://bop.unibe.ch/linguistik-online/article/view/1043|journal=Linguistik Online|language=de-DE|volume=2|issue=1|issn=1615-3014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goals set for linguistic reform aim to achieve linguistic equality of the sexes. A study of Australian newspapers from 1992 and 1996 found that the word “chairman” was used to describe all people holding the position, including women.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; This is an example of a linguistic issue that feminist’s seek to reform. Occupational nomenclature reflects gender bias when “professional nomenclature used in employment-related contexts displays bias in favour of men leading to women’s invisibility in this area.”&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; The invisibility of women is a linguistic feminist issue because when encountering sentences predominantly using male pronouns, listeners are more likely to think of men before women and therefore women get overlooked.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; Positions are gendered to be male and the “continuing, frequent use reflects the fact that far more men than women continue to occupy this position.”&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; This study further investigated and found instances of female professionals being specified as women while men would just be titled with the profession itself, for example “female judge,” “woman engineer,” and “woman politician.”&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

=== Switzerland ===
Switzerland has attempted to implement feminist language reform both formally and informally. However, changes in Switzerland have proven to be complicated due to the fact that Switzerland is a multilingual country (with the major languages being German, French, and Italian). The Bulletin Suisse de Linguistique Appliquée (Swiss Bulletin of Applied Linguistics) addressed this issue in 2000 when it created a special issue dedicated to the feminization of language in Switzerland. The bulletin attempted to critique language in Switzerland by creating a composite image of all the languages in Switzerland and how they interact with gender.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mucchi-Faina|first=Angelica|date=March 1, 2005|title=Visible or influential? Language reforms and gender (in)equality|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0539018405050466|journal=Social Science Information|volume=44|pages=10|via=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most commonly spoken language in Switzerland is German. German is a gendered language. This has concerned some language activists due to the fact that many important societal position such as judge and professor possess the gender of male and are often referred to as he/him. Activists worry that the gendering of those words discourage women from entering those fields. This facet of the German language is particularly important in Switzerland because it was historically used as a justification to restrict women’s right to vote and pass the bar.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=zzW5dqN8NiUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA163&amp;dq=switzerland+feminist+language+reform&amp;ots=fyNietMHbk&amp;sig=JVv4_W11OgUfYCSM5trQ16-Ky5g#v=onepage&amp;q=switzerland&amp;f=false|title=Social Communication|last=Fiedler|first=Klaus|date=2011-03-15|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9781136872426|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various attempts to implement feminist language reform have been undertaken in German speaking Switzerland. The government and other organizations have attempted to implement language feminization in the realms of policy making, teaching, advertising, etc.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Language feminization refers to when in writing or talking traditional male words are feminized by either using the feminine variant of the word or adding a feminine suffix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=mINlCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2635&amp;lpg=PA2635&amp;dq=feminization+%22abstract+nouns%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=p4RDWcmlbX&amp;sig=Q4QgBWuZOuhR6JYYfRCgYWhJKRw&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwig_t6AiPPPAhXCLMAKHYZrCoUQ6AEILzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=feminization%20%22abstract%20nouns%22&amp;f=false|title=Word-Formation: An International Handbook of the Languages of Europe|date=2016-01-15|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG|isbn=9783110379082|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these attempts have had only limited success. For example, private Swiss radio and television broadcasts still generally use the generic-masculine form of words.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The second most commonly spoken language in Switzerland is French which is also a gendered language. The French language raises similar concerns to that of the German language. This is because many nouns (especially those of professions) are gendered. To address these concerns, the Swiss government has created a guide on the non-sexist use of the French language. However, these attempts at change have been met with little success. This is due to the fact that Switzerland has limited influence over the French language. Meanwhile, France and specifically the government backed Académie Française (French Academy) (the French council for matters relating to the French language) has resisted feminist language reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fleischman|first=Suzanne|date=1997|title=The Battle of Feminism and Bon Usage: Instituting Nonsexist Usage in French|jstor=398544|journal=The French Review|volume=70|issue=6|pages=834–844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
The main focus of Feminist Language Reform is to acknowledge the often unconscious ways that language both silences and emphasizes gender in negative ways. In some languages it is clear with gendered nouns how some words are gendered to associate those words with maleness of femaleness. [[Feminist philosophy|Feminist Philosophers]] argue that English, a non gendered language, still has the need for Language Reform.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/feminism-language/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Saul|first=Jennifer|last2=Diaz-Leon|first2=Esa|date=2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previous [[language reform]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; attempts to avoid [[Sexism|sexist]] words or phrases were addressed in a [[Symptomatic treatment|symptomatic]] manner. Often in the workplace, employees were given pamphlets with lists of words to avoid or preferred words to use. Many [[Fourth-wave feminism|modern day feminists]] argue that this is ineffective because it does not address the root of the problem or make the large scale changes to the language that they feel are necessary.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=553f6fea-4b9e-4fff-af20-4d1bbc51bb3c@sessionmgr102&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ==#AN=edsgcl.16476233&amp;db=edsglr|title=Nonsexist language reform and 'political correctness.': Discovery Service for Loyola Marymount Univ|website=eds.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major part of the theory focuses on when words or phrases make one gender, typically women, subjugated or invisible compared to the other. The most popular examples are the pronoun “he” or the word “man”. Feminist Language Philosophers argue that these words participate in making women invisible by having them being used to refer to men and also women. The fact that the pronouns or words for the male [[gender]] can be also used to refer to the female [[gender]] shows how maleness is dominant and femaleness is subjugated.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Feminist Language Theory also focuses on when words or phrases emphasize a break in [[Gender role|gender norms]]. Clear examples of this are words like Lady Doctor or Manageress. These are positions of power that are typically held by men. Therefore, when a woman holds them, they need a new title to emphasize their break of social norm.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; It also goes both ways, with terms like male nurse referring to a man in a typically feminine role. Feminist Language Reform seeks to remove words like this because they help to sustain unhealthy gender norms.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Some modern [[Feminism|feminists]], like Sergio Bolaños Cuellar, argue that feminist language reforms needs to reverse the generic masculine forms and create a generic feminine form with words like he or man being replaced with she or woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bolaños Cuéllar|first=Sergio|date=2006-06-01|title=Women's language: a struggle to overcome inequality|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238766777_Women's_language_a_struggle_to_overcome_inequality|journal=Forma y Función}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation ==
Cases of feminist language [[plan]]ning have taken a largely [[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] approach in which the goal is to enact [[social change]] through the reform of language and language use.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This approach to [[language planning]] is divided into four stages:

# '''Fact-finding''' in which language [[:wikt:issue|issues]] are identified and [[report]]ed.
# '''Planning''' in which [[solution]]s to the issue are proposed.
# '''Implementation''' in which agreed upon methods are [[test (assessment)|tested]] and the final solution implemented.
# '''Evaluation and Feedback''' in which the results of the [[plan]] are assessed for effectiveness and the overall affects of the plan are evaluated.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Living with Patriarchy : Discursive Constructions of Gendered Subjects across Cultures|last = Majstorovic|first = Danijela|publisher = John Benjamins Publishing Company|year = 2011|isbn = 9789027206367|location = |pages = 74|last2 = Lassen|first2 = Inger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fuck''''' is a 2005 American documentary film by director [[Steve Anderson (director)|Steve Anderson]] about the word "[[fuck]]". The film argues that the word is an integral part of societal discussions about [[freedom of speech]] and [[censorship]]. It examines the term from perspectives which include art, linguistics, society and comedy, and begins with a segment from the 1965 propaganda film ''[[Perversion for Profit]]''. Scholars and celebrities analyze perceptions of the word from differing perspectives. Journalist [[Sam Donaldson]] talks about the versatility of the word, and comedian [[Billy Connolly]] states it can be understood despite one's language or location. Musician [[Alanis Morissette]] comments that the word contains power because of its taboo nature. The film features the last recorded interview of author [[Hunter S. Thompson]] before his suicide. Scholars, including linguist [[Reinhold Aman]], journalism analyst [[David Shaw (writer)|David Shaw]] and ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' editor [[Jesse Sheidlower]], explain the history and evolution of the word. Language professor [[Geoffrey Nunberg]] observes that the word's treatment by society reflects changes in our culture during the 20th century.

Anderson was exposed to public conceptions surrounding the word "fuck" by comedian [[George Carlin]]'s monologue "[[Seven dirty words|Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television]]". He named the film ''Fuck'' despite anticipating problems with marketing. Animator [[Bill Plympton]] provided sequences illustrating key concepts in the film. The documentary was first shown at the [[AFI Film Festival]] on November 7, 2005, at [[ArcLight Hollywood]] in [[Hollywood]].

''Fuck'''s reviews were generally mixed. Film critic [[A. O. Scott]] called the documentary a battle between advocates of morality and supporters of freedom of expression. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and the New York ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' criticized its length and other reviewers disliked its repetitiveness&amp;nbsp;– the word "fuck" is used 857&amp;nbsp;times in the film. In his 2009 book ''[[Fuck: Word Taboo and Protecting Our First Amendment Liberties]]'', law professor [[Christopher M. Fairman]] called the movie "the most important film using 'fuck'".&lt;ref name="fairman" /&gt; The [[American Film Institute]] said, "Ultimately, ''Fuck'' is a movie about free speech&amp;nbsp;... Freedom of expression must extend to words that offend. Love it or hate it, fuck is here to stay."&lt;ref name="vincelli" /&gt;

''Fuck'' later includes archival footage of comedians [[Lenny Bruce]] and [[George Carlin]], and analysis of the word's use in popular culture, from ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' (1970) to ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' (1983) and ''[[Clerks]]'' (1994).&lt;ref name="jackgarner" /&gt; Carlin's 1972 monologue "[[Seven dirty words|Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television]]" is excerpted in the film.&lt;ref name="jeffvice" /&gt;  Journalist [[Sam Donaldson]] comments on the versatility of "fuck": "It's one of those all-purpose words."&lt;ref name="sandiego" /&gt; Bill Maher comments, "It's the ultimate bad word",&lt;ref name="dvdverdict" /&gt; observing that thanks to Lenny Bruce, [[comedy club]]s have become "the freest free-speech zone" in the United States.&lt;ref name="aoscott" /&gt;

==Soundtrack==
''Fuck'' includes songs with similarly themed titles, including "[[Shut Up and Fuck]]" by American [[hard rock]] band [[Betty Blowtorch]], "Fucking Fucking Fuck" by Splatpattern and "[[I Love to Say Fuck]]" by American [[horror punk]] supergroup [[Murderdolls]]. Journalist Sam Peczek of ''Culture Wars'' compared the film's music to that in [[softcore pornography]], and observed that the soundtrack was broad in scope and helped accentuate the film's content.&lt;ref name="sampeczek" /&gt;

[[File:Steve Anderson film director.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Steve Anderson (director)|Steve Anderson]] decided to research the film's topic due to the word's versatility and his interest in language use as a writer.&lt;ref name="naughtywordintrigues" /&gt;|alt=Steve Anderson]]
Anderson made his directorial debut in 2003 with the film ''[[The Big Empty (2003 film)|The Big Empty]]'', starring actors [[Daryl Hannah]] and [[Jon Favreau]],&lt;ref name="naughtywordintrigues" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=December 1, 2006|title=Four Letters, Two Stars|first=Jennie|last= Punter|page=R17; Section: The Globe Review 7; film}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became fascinated by the usage of the word "fuck".&lt;ref name="sandiego"&gt;{{cite news|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100222003812/http://sandiegometro.archives.whsites.net/reel/index.php?reelID=987|archivedate=February 22, 2010|url=http://sandiegometro.archives.whsites.net/reel/index.php?reelID=987|accessdate=April 17, 2013|date=December 2006|title=The Reel Story: F*ck&amp;nbsp;– History of a bad word|work=San Diego Metropolitan Magazine &amp; Daily Business Report|first=Jean |last=Lowerison}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with the ''[[Democrat and Chronicle]]'', Anderson suggested he cursed a lot more than he used to after the film's production. He decided to research the film's topic due to the word's versatility and his interest in language as a writer.&lt;ref name="naughtywordintrigues" /&gt; Early exposure by Anderson to public perception of the word "fuck" came from ''[[Class Clown]]'' by comedian George Carlin, which included his monologue "Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television".&lt;ref name="naughtywordintrigues"&gt;{{cite news|title='Naughty word' intrigues Pittsford grad|date=January 4, 2007|first=Jack|last=Garner|work=[[Democrat and Chronicle]]|location=Rochester, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tucsoncitizen"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Tucson Citizen]]|first=Jack|last=Garner|title=Carlin's list a 'precursor' to new documentary|date=January 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The director explained in an interview that he was fascinated with the word "fuck" because of its different uses. He originally proposed the idea of a film about the word in jest, later realizing that the topic could fuel a documentary.&lt;ref name="jaystonecanwest"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jay ([[CanWest News Service]])|last=Stone|work=[[National Post]]|date=November 28, 2006|title=Defusing The F-bomb: New Doc. Director tackles The Profundity Of Profanity|page=B3}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Observer]]'' quoted him as saying that he was entertained by the word "fuck",&lt;ref name="rowanwalker" /&gt; and intrigued with the idea of examining how the word had been incorporated into popular culture.&lt;ref name="rowanwalker" /&gt; He wanted to analyze why some people were offended by its use and others enjoyed it, noting that the word sharpened debate about taboo language in society.&lt;ref name="rowanwalker" /&gt;

Anderson explained to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' the confusing, forbidden nature of the word "fuck" in the face of the increased pervasiveness of euphemisms for it.&lt;ref name="zoemak" /&gt; He commented on its taboo nature and demonstrated how it can be indirectly referred to, so youth understand the reference without using the word itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20040427&amp;slug=cursing27|title=Flush that potty mouth with popular euphemisms|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|first=Lynn ([[Los Angeles Times]])|last=Smith|date=April 27, 2004|page=C1; Edition: Fourth; Section: Northwest Life}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with the ''[[South China Morning Post]]'', Anderson said that film directors should fight against censorship, because it can block their true message.&lt;ref name="zoemak" /&gt;

The director told CanWest News Service that he hoped the documentary would provoke a wider discussion about freedom of speech, [[sexual slang]] and its media use. Anderson questioned whether the word should be used on ''[[NYPD Blue]]'', and how parents should discuss its use with their children. He emphasized that artists and filmmakers should be free to express their views without censorship, deferring to public opinion on the appropriateness of his documentary's title.&lt;ref name="jaystonecanwest" /&gt;

Anderson stated in an interview with [[IndieWire]] that freedom of speech was not guaranteed, but a concept requiring discussion and monitoring so it is not lost. He classified the word "fuck" as being at the core of discussion about freedom of speech. He acknowledged that there are terms considered by society more vulgar than "fuck", but said that this particular word creates controversy and dialogue.&lt;ref name="indiewire"&gt;{{cite news|date=November 9, 2006|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/indiewire_interview_steve_anderson_director_of_fuck2|accessdate=April 23, 2013|title=indieWIRE Interview: Steve Anderson, director of 'Fuck'|author=IndieWire staff|work=[[IndieWire]]|quote=From the very beginning we didn't know what we were going to call it. For the entire production it was known as "The Untitled F-Word Film." I always harbored the desire to eventually call it "Fuck" but as a producer as well as a director, you have to consider getting the film into theaters. People need to be able to see the film. In the end, after much discussion and many alternate titles, we decided to simply call if "Fuck." It was the honest thing to do.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson said that its title alone distinguished his documentary from others, in terms of promotional difficulty. During production, ''Fuck'' was known as ''The Untitled F-Word Film''.&lt;ref name="indiewire" /&gt;

==={{anchor|Title choice and marketing}}Title and marketing===
[[File:Fuck film interview grid.tif|thumb|Steve Anderson said that the title of his film was ''Fuck'', but he allowed marketing designs with an asterisk.&lt;ref name="fairman" /&gt;|alt=Fuck with asterisk instead of letter U, with background of tiled images of interviewees from film]]
In an interview about the film on his website, Anderson discussed problems he encountered in naming his film ''Fuck'' instead of a censored version of the word. Anderson always wanted to call it ''Fuck'', because it succinctly described the film's contents.&lt;ref name="fairman" /&gt;{{efn|''Fuck'' is styled as ''FUCK'', ''F★CK'', or ''F*CK''&lt;ref name="baumgarten" /&gt;&lt;ref name="financialtimes" /&gt; and alternatively referred to as ''Fuck: A Documentary'' and ''The F-Bomb: A Documentary''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dvd.netflix.com/Movie/The-F-Bomb-A-Documentary/70058003|accessdate=June 8, 2013|year=2013|work=[[Netflix]]|title=The F-Bomb: A Documentary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_f_bomb_a_documentary/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131027150801/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_f_bomb_a_documentary/|archivedate=October 27, 2013|accessdate=June 8, 2013|year=2013|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|title=The F-bomb: A Documentary}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} There were inherent problems with this approach, including an inability to advertise the true title in mainstream media such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''Los Angeles Times'' (they used four asterisks instead), although the real title might be permitted in [[alternative newspaper]]s such as ''[[LA Weekly]]''.&lt;ref name="fairman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jaystonecanwest" /&gt; Anderson also anticipated problems displaying the film's title during film festivals on theatre [[Marquee (sign)|marquees]].&lt;ref name="fairman" /&gt;

Anderson explained that although the title of his documentary was ''Fuck'', he allowed alternate designations using an asterisk. The film and content he controlled would refer to the title as ''Fuck'', including theatrical and DVD editions. He concluded that his struggle reflected the debate alluded to by the documentary, and this realization motivated him to stand firm on the film's title.&lt;ref name="fairman" /&gt; Because the film is about how a taboo word can impact culture, it was important to keep ''Fuck'' as its title.&lt;ref name="couldoscar"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|title=Could Oscar be a four-letter word?|date=March 27, 2006|page=1; Section: The Globe Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rainstorm Entertainment]] was confirmed in November 2003 to produce and finance the documentary, with production scheduled to begin in January 2004.&lt;ref name="rainstormswears"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rainstorm swears by doc|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=November 10, 2003|page=27|first=Dana|last=Harris}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was completed in 2005 by Anderson's company, Mudflap Films, and produced by Rainstorm Entertainment co-founders Steven Kaplan and Gregg Daniel,&lt;ref name="ianmohr" /&gt; and Bruce Leiserowitz, Jory Weitz and Richard Ardi.&lt;ref name="daringdocu" /&gt; Financial assistance was provided by Bad Apple Films of [[Spokane, Washington]].&lt;ref name="indiewire" /&gt;

[[File:Hunter S. Thompson in Fuck film.jpg|thumb|The documentary featured the last interview with author [[Hunter S. Thompson]] before his suicide and honored Thompson's contributions to journalism.|alt=Hunter S. Thompson]]
Thirty-five media commentators were interviewed for the film.&lt;ref name="stamets" /&gt;&lt;ref name="charlesbritton" /&gt; Jory Weitz helped obtain interviews; he had cast Anderson's previous film, ''The Big Empty'', and had industry credibility as executive producer of ''[[Napoleon Dynamite]]''.&lt;ref name="indiewire" /&gt; Anderson said he intended to select interviewees with a variety of perspectives, conservative as well as liberal. He described how, as confirmations of interview subjects came in, he was surprised when Pat Boone was among the first to confirm his participation. Anderson had previously worked as a cameraman on a piece with Boone about eight years before starting work on ''Fuck''. After confirming Boone, Bill Maher and Janeane Garofalo on ''Fuck'', it became easier for Anderson to confirm other interviewees. The film included the final video interview with Hunter S. Thompson before his suicide, and Anderson dedicated it to Thompson for his contributions to journalism.&lt;ref name="rebeccabachman" /&gt;

In an interview with the ''Santa Barbara Independent'', Anderson said that a schoolteacher in Philadelphia had been fired for showing the documentary to his students.&lt;ref name="rebeccabachman" /&gt; The teacher had researched the documentary, and wanted to teach his students the history of the word because of its frequent use in his class.&lt;ref name="rebeccabachman" /&gt; Anderson said it was not the use of the word "fuck" in the film that cost the teacher his job, but a 38-second scene from a ''[[Fuck for Forest]]'' concert in Europe where a couple engaged in sexual intercourse onstage as environmental advocacy.&lt;ref name="rebeccabachman" /&gt; The teacher showed the DVD to his 11th-grade journalism class at [[William Penn High School (Philadelphia)|William Penn High School]] without previewing it or sending [[permission slip]]s home to parents.&lt;ref name="90minutelapse"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jill|last=Porter|title=The 90-minute lapse that killed a 19-year career: Showing a DVD about the F-Word in class was a mistake&amp;nbsp;...

''Fuck'' was featured in a 2012 analysis in the academic journal ''Communication Teacher'', "Do You Talk to Your Teacher with That Mouth?

Their research incorporated interviews with Steve Anderson, students and data from [[Postgraduate education|graduate-level]] classes in language and culture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37276">'''Heritage language learning''' or heritage language acquisition is the act of [[language acquisition|learning]] a '''[[heritage language]]''' from an [[ethnolinguistic group]] that traditionally speaks the language, or from those whose family historically spoke the language.  According to a commonly accepted definition by Valdés,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The teaching of heritage languages: an introduction for Slavic-teaching professionals. The learning and teaching of Slavic languages and cultures.|last=Valdés|first=G.|publisher=Olga Kagan and Benjamin Rifkin|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=375–403}}&lt;/ref&gt; heritage languages are generally minority languages in society and are typically learned at home during childhood.  When a heritage language learner grows up in an environment with a dominant language that is different from their heritage language, the learner appears to be more competent in the dominant language and often feels more comfortable speaking in that language.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  "Heritage language" may also be referred to as "community language," "home language," and "ancestral language".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing Second Language Acquisition: perspectives and practices|last=Hummel|first=Kirsten|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different kinds of heritage language learners, such as learners with varying levels of proficiency in the heritage language, and also those who learn a "foreign" language in school with which they have some connection.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leeman|first=Jennifer|year=2015|title=Heritage Language Education and Identity in the United States|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1662798729|journal=Annual Review of Applied Linguistics|volume=35|pages=100–119|via=ProQuest|doi=10.1017/s0267190514000245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polinsky &amp; Kagan&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Polinsky | first1 = M. | last2 = Kagan | first2 = O. | year = 2007 | title = Heritage Languages: In the 'Wild' and in the Classroom | url = | journal = Language and Linguistics Compass | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 368–395 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-818x.2007.00022.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; label heritage language learners on a continuum that ranges from fluent speakers to individuals who speak very little of their heritage language. Valdés&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Valdés|first=Guadalupe|year=2005|title=Bilingualism, Heritage Language Learners, and SLA Research: Opportunities Lost or Seized?|url=|journal=The Modern Language Journal|volume=89.3|pages=410–26|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4781.2005.00314.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; points out that a connection with a heritage language does not have to be made only through direct previous exposure to the language or a certain amount of proficiency in the language. In her conception of heritage language learners, monolingual English-speaking students of Armenian ancestry in the United States could consider themselves to have a heritage language of Armenian. A different definition of heritage language learners or speakers limits the term to individuals who were exposed to the language in early childhood, but who later lost proficiency in the language in favor of adopting the majority language of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Montrul|first=Silvina|date=2010|title=Current Issues in Heritage Language Acquisition|url=|journal=Annual Review of Applied Linguistics|volume=30|pages=3–23|doi=10.1017/s0267190510000103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heritage language acquisition theories are highly contested. The most common theory is the Incomplete Acquisition Theory,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; but other scholars have considered delayed acquisition, variations in input, and cross-linguistic influence as factors that contribute to heritage language speakers' competence (see section on Acquisition Theories). For children who may have acquired a different dialect of the heritage language, they would require a unique type of instruction that may differ from styles of instruction that would be most beneficial for students who experience incomplete acquisition at an early age.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Heritage languages can be learned in various contexts, including public school instruction and language courses organized by a community which speaks the particular language during after-school hours or on the weekend.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When someone is engaged in informal heritage language learning, they are acquiring a language from a particular ethnolinguistic group that traditionally speaks the language, or from someone whose family historically spoke the language. Formal heritage language instruction occurs inside of a classroom, where learners are taught a language that is being used inside of the home or among members of their own ethnic group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Language programs that include Saturday schools and courses that happen outside of school hours are programs where children are encouraged to further develop and improve their heritage language proficiency.

According to Valdés,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; the term "heritage language" can be used very broadly and can refer to minority languages which are spoken by what many know as "linguistic minorities." Typically, these heritage languages are endangered or have a high possibility of disappearing soon without intervention, and because of this, there are several communities in the United States that have chosen to work towards maintaining these languages.

== Heritage language vs native language ==
&lt;nowiki/&gt;The difference between native language (or [[First language]]) and heritage language is an important distinction to make. The term "native language" tends to be associated with acquisition at a very early age and carries with it the notion that a person will achieve a high amount of fluency and proficiency in this language. Typically, the native language is the dominant language for a speaker and this speaker is expected to have natural understanding of not only linguistic knowledge, but also pragmatic and cultural knowledge, as well as skills such as writing creatively, making jokes, and translating.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Native Speaker in Applied Linguistics|last=Davies|first=Alan|publisher=The Handbook of Applied Linguistics|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=431–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the term "heritage language" is more associated with the language in which proficiency was sacrificed in order to gain proficiency in the dominant language in a particular community. This is not always the case, however, as some speakers of heritage languages have just as much proficiency in that language as in their other language(s).

Heritage language learners differ from other types of language learners. Kagan &amp; Dillon&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Kagan, O., &amp; Dillon, K. (2003). A new perspective on teaching Russian: Focus on the heritage learner. Heritage Language Journal, Available: {{cite web |url=http://www.international.ucla.edu/languages/heritagelanguages/journal/article.asp?parentid=3693 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129211636/http://international.ucla.edu/languages/heritagelanguages/journal/article.asp?parentid=3693 |archivedate=2009-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; provide us with distinctions among speakers of Russian as a native language, and learners of Russian as a heritage language or a foreign language in the table below. The goal of the research was to distinguish between types of language learners of Russian and to use that information to create a new perspective for instruction. The table explains that students whose native language was Russian had acquired it as a child and used it throughout life with exposure to a full language community of speakers. For the students who learned Russian as a foreign language (L2), there was first an L1 or native language before they began learning Russian, the foreign language, which was typically learned solely outside of the community. Lastly, the heritage speakers of Russian had acquired Russian as an L1, but when they immigrated to the United States, English became their primary language. This left most heritage language students with varying levels of proficiency in their heritage language due to the limited community that spoke Russian.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Acquisition theories ==
Acquisition theories have been proposed in an attempt to explain why heritage speakers’  competence in the heritage language diverges from that of their monolingual peers.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Silvina Montrul’s research has been foundational to this work.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Her Incomplete Acquisition Theory states that heritage speakers do not completely acquire the heritage language before switching to the L2. As attrition can also render a grammar “incomplete,” attrition is included in this theory. Multiple researchers&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Domínguez | first1 = L | year = 2009 | title = Charting the route of bilingual development: contributions from heritage speakers' early acquisition | url = | journal = Int. J. Biling | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 271–287 | doi=10.1177/1367006909339812}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; have refuted Silvina Montrul's proposal by suggesting that the Incomplete Acquisition Theory does not take into consideration delayed acquisition, input variation, and cross-linguistic influence, all of which factor into language competence.

As research on heritage language learners' acquisition is relatively recent, dating back to the early 2000s, there remains much to be discovered about the process. It should also be noted that the following acquisition theories pertain to language learners who have learned, at least partially, the heritage language before switching to the dominant language. For more information on heritage language learners who lack personal experience with the heritage language but have ancestry who spoke the language, see [[language revitalization]].

=== Incomplete Acquisition Theory ===

==== Incomplete Acquisition  ====
The Incomplete Acquisition Theory recognizes that complete acquisition of [[First language|L1]] takes place throughout childhood, stretching into the school-age period.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Montrul, S. (2010). Current Issues in Heritage Language Acquisition. ''Annual Review of Applied Linguistics'', ''30.'' 3-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, heritage language learners, who typically switch to the dominant culture’s language when they enter school and, consequently, experience a decline in input in the heritage language, do not completely acquire their first language.&lt;ref&gt;Guijarro-Fuentes, P., Schmitz, K. (2015). The nature and nurter of heritage language acquisition. ''Lingua'', ''164'' (B), 239-250.&lt;/ref&gt; As heritage language learners are rarely schooled in their L1, they are often orally proficient but illiterate or have underdeveloped written comprehension and production in the heritage language.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Montrul | first1 = S. | last2 = Foote | first2 = R. | last3 = Perpiñán | first3 = S. | year = 2008 | title = Gender Agreement in Adult Second Language Learners and Spanish Heritage Speakers: The Effects of Age and Context of Acquisition | url = | journal = Language Learning | volume = 58 | issue = 3| pages = 503–553 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9922.2008.00449.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In treating heritage language learning as interrupted L1 acquisition, in which the learner has access to Universal Grammar, it is expected that heritage language learners have knowledge of concepts found in early stages of L1 development, such as binding constraints, wh-movement, and aspects of lexical semantics, and struggle with grammatical concepts that require sustained exposure and practice in school-aged children, such as specialized vocabulary and uses of the subjunctive in Spanish.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Moreira Flores, C.M. (2015). Understanding heritage language acquisition. Some contributions from the research on heritage speakers of European Portuguese. ''Lingua'', ''164.'' 251-265.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Attrition ====
An incomplete grammar may be the result of attrition and fossilization of concepts in the L1 due to insufficient input once the child has switched to the dominant language.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Montrul, S., Bowles, M., (2009). Back to basics: incomplete acquisition of Differential Object Marking in Spanish heritage speakers. Biling.: Lang. Cogn. 12 (3), 363--383.&lt;/ref&gt; Attrition is the loss of, or failure to make full use of, “grammatical knowledge previously acquired".&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pires | first1 = A. | last2 = Rothman | first2 = J. | year = 2009 | title = Disentangling sources of incomplete acquisition: An explanation for competence divergence across heritage grammars | url = | journal = International Journal of Bilingualism | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 211–238 | doi=10.1177/1367006909339806}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fossilization occurs when a speaker lets go of non-core grammatical concepts but retains the basic core structure of the language.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Attrition and fossilization are considered to be part of the Incomplete Acquisition Theory because they render a language incomplete. However, Pires and Rothman (2009) argue that attrition should be distinguished from the Incomplete Acquisition Theory in future studies because, in instances of attrition, the speakers do, indeed, completely acquire the target grammar as children.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Alternative acquisition theories ===
==== Delayed Acquisition ====
Delayed acquisition may contribute to the difference in language competence between heritage speakers and monolingual speakers of the same language.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Late or delayed acquisition of a language can have "consequences for linguistic, neurological, and cognitive mechanisms" that work to make language acquisition "fast, effortless, and... successful".&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Flores and Barbosa (2014) studied the clitic placement of heritage speakers of Portuguese living in Germany and concluded that the heritage speakers went through the same stages of acquisition as their monolingual counterparts. However, the process of acquisition was delayed and took longer for the heritage speakers because they had reduced input of the heritage language.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;Flores, C. and Barbosa, P. (2014). ''When reduced input leads to delayed acquisition: A study on the acquisition of clitic placement by Portuguese heritage speakers.'' International Journal of Bilingualism, 18(3), 304-325. 
&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, this theory must be considered in conjunction with theories on input variation.

==== Input  ====
Theories of acquisition involving variations of input postulate that heritage language learners' production of the heritage language diverges from that of their monolingual peers who speak the same language because the two groups are exposed to different dialects and quantities of input.

=====Dialect Variation=====

Theories surrounding dialect variation suggest that errors or deviations from the standard dialect made by a heritage language learner may reflect the acquisition of a non-standard variety or informal register of the heritage language, which include variations on certain properties or the lack of certain properties found in the standard dialect.  Heritage language learners are often only exposed to one dialect or colloquial variety of the heritage language, unlike their monolingual peers who interact with a standard monolingual dialect found in formal instruction.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Furthermore, certain grammatical properties are only present in the standard dialect or are used infrequently in the colloquial dialect.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Pires and Rothaman use the expression, "missing-input competence divergence," to refer to instances when a grammatical property is missing from the colloquial variety.

The dramatic difference between standard and colloquial dialects is particularly evident in cases of verbal morphology, the clitic system, the subjunctive, and inflected infinitives in Brazilian Portuguese.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Pires and Rothman (2009) found that Brazilian Portuguese heritage learners do not acquire inflected infinitives because their input does not "robustly instantiate these forms".&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Similarly, Dominguez (2009) found that deviations in the use and distribution of indicative and subjunctive forms that were in the output of heritage Spanish speakers were also found in the children's input (parental speech).&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

In certain cases, heritage language learners receive their input from first-generation migrants who have shown effects of attrition in certain domains. Consequently, the language learner would be missing grammatical properties in their input as a result of the interlocutor's attrition and would replicate these errors in their output.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Pires and Rothman (2009) claim that due to their "inborn faculty of language," children automatically acquire the grammar found in their input.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Therefore, in conclusion, it is not a deficient ability to acquire the language, but rather, the absence of, or limited access to, certain properties in the child's input that leads to errors in language production.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Without access to a standard dialect of the target language often found in formal academic contexts, heritage language learners continue to make these production errors.

=====Quantity of Input=====

Heritage language learners may also have a smaller quantity of input than their monolingual peers because the heritage language is only found in a restricted number of contexts and with fewer interlocutors. Citing statistics found in studies on hearing children with deaf parents, Flores and Barbosa (2014) posit that bilingual heritage language learners need a minimum of 5 to 10 hours of interaction per week with the language to develop native-like proficiency. Hours of input may be particularly restricted once the heritage speaker switches to the dominant language.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

==== Cross-linguistic influence ====
Cross-linguistic influence may contribute to heritage speakers' competence divergence. Heritage language learners show a tendency to overuse grammatical properties that are found in both the heritage language and the dominant language.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Furthermore, heritage language learners may prefer grammatical structures from the dominant language and transfer them into the heritage language.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; To learn more about language transfer in bilingual individuals, see [[Crosslinguistic influence]].

== Identity and heritage language learning ==
There are many theories across disciplines that seek to explain the relationship between language and identity, but the existence of such a relationship is the common thread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rozanov | first1 = T | year = 2016 | title = Language and identity explored | url = | journal = Journal of Arts and Humanities | volume = 5 | issue = 6| pages = 1–8 | doi=10.18533/journal.v5i6.948}}&lt;/ref&gt; For heritage language learners, when their native or heritage language is not treated as valuable in the classroom, this negatively affects their view of themselves and their mental health.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leeman | first1 = J. | last2 = Rabin | first2 = L. | last3 = Roman-Mendoza | first3 = E. | year = 2011 | title = Identity and Activism in Heritage Language Education | url = | journal = The Modern Language Journal | volume = 95 | issue = | pages = 481–495 | doi=10.1111/j.1540-4781.2011.01237.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many minority language speakers’ children lose the ability to speak the minority language once they enter the classroom, because of several detrimental factors discussed below. Heritage language learning may help these children regain or avoid losing the ability to communicate with their parents.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yilmaz | first1 = T | year = 2016 | title = The motivational factors of heritage language learning in immigrant bilingualism | url = | journal = International Journal of Social Science and Humanity | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 191–200 | doi=10.7763/ijssh.2016.v6.642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without the ability to communicate with parents or other family members, it becomes difficult to create an identity intertwined with one's heritage culture. In fact, once the heritage language is lost, children may lose the cognitive ability to understand certain concepts or beliefs in their heritage culture. Those who lose the heritage language and choose not to actively maintain its use often assimilate into the dominant culture rather quickly.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; When heritage language learning does take place, the “standard” language is instructed, and learners whose heritage language is of a different dialect are judged for their variance from the standard. This results in a loss of self-esteem that makes strong self-identity difficult.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

One group of heritage language learners includes international adoptees. Some parents that adopt internationally see heritage language learning as a necessary part of the adoptees connection with their own cultural identity, and choose to learn the heritage language along with their child. Though the language is not a heritage language for these parents, it is the language their child might have been brought up in and is a necessary part of “culture keeping,” or the act of purposefully ensuring the adopted child holds onto their birth culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shin|first=Sarah|date=October 2012|title=Transforming culture and identity: transnational adoptive families and heritage language learning|doi=10.1080/07908318.2013.809095|journal=Language, Culture, and Curriculum|volume=26|issue=2|pages=161–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another sub-category of heritage language learners are mixed-heritage learners. Studies show that these individuals may have a confused sense of identity because they do not feel that they are fully accepted by either culture.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shin | first1 = S. J. | year = 2010 | title = "What About Me? I'm Not Like Chinese But I'm Not Like American": Heritage-Language Learning and Identity of Mixed-Heritage Adults | url = | journal = Journal of Language, Identity &amp; Education | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 203–219 | doi=10.1080/15348458.2010.486277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heritage language learning can be a way to help mixed-heritage individuals connect to the culture of their minority language parent, but these children face several obstacles in pursuing this language, as described in “Detrimental Factors to Heritage Language Learning.”

For all heritage language learners, Kondo-Brown suggests that proficiency is positively correlated to both a strong perception of heritage and ethnic identity and a strong community in one's ethnic group.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;Heritage Language Development : Focus on East Asian Immigrants. (2006). Amsterdam, NL: John Benjamins Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Much research backs this claim.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Y. G. (1992). ''The role of attitudes and motivation in learning a heritage language: A study of korean language maintenance in toronto.''
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Chinen, K., &amp; Tucker, G. R. (2003). Saturday-school participation, ethnic identity and Japanese language development. Heritage Language Journal, 1(1).''
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Oketani, H. (1997a). Additive bilinguals: The case of post-war second-generation Japanese Canadian youths. Bilingual Research Journal, 21, 15– 35.''
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Cho, G. (2000). The role of heritage language in social interactions and relationships: Reflections from a language minority group. Bilingual Research Journal, 24(4), 369– 384.''
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Lee, J. S. (2002). The Korean language in America: The role of cultural identity in heritage language learning. Language, Culture, and Curriculum, 15 (2), 117– 133.''
&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of Japanese heritage language learners, Kondo-Brown found that individuals with one parent speaking the language performed much better in both grammatical knowledge, and various self-assessment tools than those without a parent speaking Japanese. Individuals in this same study with either one Japanese speaking grandparent, or only being of Japanese descent performed on the same level, below those with one Japanese speaking parent. Kondo-Brown attributes this difference to variance in sense of ethnic identity.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

== Contexts of heritage language learning ==
{{Cleanup section|reason=this whole article needs to be reorganized, really.|date=March 2018}}
===Overview : Before a learning program begins===

Heritage language learning is generally an effort to recover one's cultural identity, and is therefore linked to the language loss experienced by immigrant and indigenous populations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Immigration and colonialism around the world have created communities of people who speak languages other than the dominant language at home.  Their minority status means that they must navigate the effects of linguistic difference, and the expression of culture, ethnicity, and values through language.  Heritage learners often cite a desire to connect with their cultural heritage as a major motivation for studying their heritage language.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  They may also be motivated by the global prominence and potential career advantages of some heritage languages.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Kagan, Olga (2012). ''Encyclopedia of Diversity in Education''. SAGE Publications, Inc. pp. 1048–1053. {{ISBN|9781412981521}} – via SAGE Knowledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  As both major immigrant destinations and exporters of the world's dominant language, the United States, Canada, Western Europe, and Australia are home to large populations of heritage language speakers.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Indigenous populations in Australia and the Americas also teach their own languages as heritage languages, attempting to revitalize them after the effects of colonial occupation.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

===Immigration situation different in various countries, dialects===

The distribution of immigrant languages around the world largely reflects immigration patterns; for example, Spanish and Chinese are more likely to be taught as heritage languages abroad.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The language profile of a single immigrant community can also vary due to the presence of different dialects. This variation in dialects and even writing systems can be another obstacle in meeting community needs.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Ebb and flow in a country's immigrant populations can also lead to significant variation in the abilities of heritage learners in a single classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koshiba|first=Kenta|last2=Kurata|first2=Naomi|year=2012|title=Language Identities of Japanese Home-background Speakers and their Language Learning Needs|doi=10.1080/10371397.2012.730481|journal=Japanese Studies|volume=32|issue=3|pages=357–375}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A study conducted by the [[Language Resource Center|National Heritage Language Resource Center (UCLA)]] shows that in the United States, heritage speakers' interest in their home language tends to wane as they enter school, but may rise again in the later teenage years, prompting the decision to study it in college.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

===Various obstacles for education programs===

The study and teaching of indigenous heritage languages stands at odds with colonial governments' earlier attempts at forced cultural assimilation.  The process of language loss accelerated by colonial policies and practices means that many indigenous languages are faced with the threat of extinction, and the effort to teach them as heritage languages intersects with broader [[language revitalization]] projects.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;Ball, Jessica (2009).

''The Canadian Modern Language Review''. '''66''': 19–40 – via Project MUSE.&lt;/ref&gt; While learners of immigrant languages are likely to have at least partial knowledge of their language from an early age, indigenous language learners may never have spoken their languages before they began learning them in a formal setting.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  Education in these languages is further complicated by social stigma, and the feelings of shame or inadequacy that some indigenous people may associate with their language due to colonial intervention.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  Adult speakers coming from a legacy such as that of [[Canadian Indian residential school system|Canada's residential schools]] (a project for assimilating indigenous peoples), whose negative psychological effects have been reported by [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission]], may be unable or unwilling to pass their language on to their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.myrobust.com/websites/trcinstitution/File/Reports/Survivors_Speak_English_Web.pdf|title=The Survivors Speak: A Report of The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada|last=Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada|first=|date=2015|work=|access-date=February 22, 2017|via=Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada|newspaper=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Heritage language pedagogy ==
Heritage language learners have widely varying circumstances and educational needs that set them apart from foreign language learners.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  They may have little to no understanding of the language, or be able to speak but not read or write it.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  Formal education in heritage languages has existed since the nineteenth century, in immigrant communities and private and religious schools.  Heritage languages did not attract the attention of public education and universities until the concept of heritage language itself began to emerge as a separate field from [[Language education|foreign language learning]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Heritage languages are also referred to as community, ethnic, ancestral, minority, or non-official languages, but the term ''heritage language'' appears to have originated with Canadian programs of this type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duff|first=Patricia A.|last2=Li|first2=Duanduan|date=2009-10-09|title=Indigenous, Minority, and Heritage Language Education in Canada: Policies, Contexts, and Issues|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/362176|journal=The Canadian Modern Language Review / La revue canadienne des langues vivantes|volume=66|issue=1|pages=1–8|issn=1710-1131|doi=10.3138/cmlr.66.1.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methods ===
When designing heritage language curricula and teaching methods, linguists and educators attempt to address the ways in which heritage learners are unique.&lt;ref&gt;University of California Heritage Language Focus Group (2003).  "[http://nhlrc.ucla.edu/nhlrc/page/curriculumguidelines/preface Curriculum Guidelines for Heritage Language Classrooms at the University of California.]"  Retrieved April 3, 2017 - via National Heritage Language Resource Center.&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to the teaching of foreign languages, heritage language teaching methods place more emphasis on literacy and experiential, content-based approaches.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  Because cultural identity is a definitive part of heritage language learning, languages are often taught alongside cultural practices.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Teaching heritage languages is not limited to the classroom; it may be a part of other local community contexts, such as a volunteer work and internships, field trips, oral history projects, or [[Scouting|Scout troops]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guardado|first=Martin|year=2009|title=Speaking Spanish Like a Boy Scout: Language Socialization, Resistance, and Reproduction in a Heritage Language Scout Troop|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/362171|journal=The Canadian Modern Language Review|volume=66|pages=102–129|via=Project MUSE|doi=10.3138/cmlr.66.1.101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;University of California Consortium for Language Learning and Teaching.

Retrieved April 3, 2017 - via National Heritage Language Resource Center.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heritage and foreign language teaching ===
One question facing heritage language programs is the relationship of heritage language learners to foreign language learners of that same language.  The two types of students have different educational, cultural, and psychological backgrounds, which can lead to uneven learning outcomes if they are taught together.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Heritage language learners can be taught in entirely separate programs from foreign language learners, or in courses where different types of learners are integrated to varying degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Dienst-Philipson, Samara (2009).  "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/305183156 Comparison of Methods for Teaching Spanish as a Heritage Language in the Mainstream Classroom]".  via ProQuest.&lt;/ref&gt;  They may also be taught alongside their foreign language counterparts with no distinction between them, as is usually the case in college language courses.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

== Detrimental factors to heritage language learning ==
American immigrants often end their pursuit of heritage language learning after two or three generations in the United States, and it is now becoming more common to shift into English within two generations.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The decision to end heritage language learning can stem from a variety of factors, but often includes societal pressure to use the dominant language.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Some L2 speakers view the dominant language as superior or associate it with higher class society, and prefer it to their heritage language, or believe it will lead them to greater opportunity than their native tongue.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Some parents discourage use of the heritage language in the home because of a fear that their children will have a harder time learning the dominant language if they are also learning another language.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This belief is not supported by research. Research by Yan and Elena (as cited in Yilmaz 2016) showed better performance in bilinguals as compared to monolinguals in metalinguistic ability, pragmatics, and attention control.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This and other research actually points to [[Cognitive advantages of bilingualism]] including greater cognitive ability and mental flexibility.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Practical limitations to heritage language learning are also possible, and can include limited access to resources for heritage language learning, and limited materials in the heritage language. A combination of a social and practical limitation, classrooms may also discourage the use of minority languages by students during instruction.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

In the sub-population of mixed-heritage learners, there may other stigmas that contribute to the loss of heritage language learning. If it is not widely accepted to marry outside of their culture, and individuals decide to do so anyhow, they may lose contact with their ethnic community upon marriage. This leaves them without access to a community of speakers in their heritage language. Their children now have little access to one parent’s native language, and little opportunity to pursue heritage language learning.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Although heritage language learning can be important in many cases, the stakes are particularly high when the language is near [[language extinction|extinction]]. In some cases, the active pursuit of heritage language learning is necessary to keep a minority languages alive, yet there may be limited learning materials and resources to do so. The language of the Cherokee people in North Carolina and in the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma fits into this category. In these situations, it is also likely that there is limited access to social communities of native speakers to communicate with. Without this natural input as well as pedagogical input, speakers may not achieve the fluency needed to keep the language alive, and the minority language may be lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peter | first1 = L. | last2 = Hirata-Edds | first2 = T. | year = 2009 | title = Learning to read and write cherokee: Toward a theory of literacy revitalization | url = | journal = Bilingual Research Journal | volume = 32 | issue = 2| pages = 207–227 | doi=10.1080/15235880903170041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Other uses}}{{Wiktionary|Howdy}}
'''Howdy''' is an informal [[greeting]], originally a shortened form of the greeting ''How do ye?'' It was first recorded as part of the South England dialect in 1563/87.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]],'' vol. VII, p. 453–454.&lt;/ref&gt;

Literature from that period includes the use of ''How-do, how-do'' and ''How'' as a greeting used by the Scottish when addressing Anglo settlers in greeting. The double form of the idiom is still found in parts of the American Southwest as ''Howdy, howdy''.  Without regard to etymological beginnings, the word is used as a greeting such as "Hello" and not, normally, as an enquiry. As a result, it's not followed by a [[question mark]]. Punctuating ''Howdy'' commonly follows these rules:
(i) If ''Howdy'' is used as a complete sentence, it's followed by an [[exclamation mark]].
(ii) If ''Howdy'' is the first word in a sentence, it's followed by a [[comma]].

In the rural Southwestern United States, ''Howdy'' is a colloquial contraction of the formal greeting of ''How do you do?'', and as such is considered a formal and acceptable greeting for residents of that region of the world. ''Howdy'' is also the official greeting of [[Texas A&amp;M University]], though the two are not always automatically associated.

The word became recently popular in other areas of the world as it is the default greeting from the dashboard of [[WordPress]], a very popular content management system.&lt;ref&gt;http://trends.builtwith.com/cms&lt;/ref&gt; The probable reason for using "Howdy" (instead of "Welcome" or "Hello") in the dashboard is because [[Matt Mullenweg]], one of the main developers of WordPress, was born and raised in Texas.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

==Boy howdy==
The phrase "boy howdy" is a development of the greeting which adds the exclamation "boy" to form an [[interjection]] which indicates an emphatic affirmation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.word-detective.com/2008/07/boy-howdy/comment-page-1/ |title=Boy Howdy |work=The Word Detective |date=14 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Herzensschatzikomm.jpg|thumb|An example of what hypergraphia may look like]]
'''Hypergraphia''' is a behavioral condition characterized by the intense desire to write or draw. Forms of hypergraphia can vary in writing style and content. It is a symptom associated with [[temporal lobe]] changes in [[epilepsy]], which is the cause of the [[Geschwind syndrome]], a mental disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Devinsky J, Schachter S |title=Norman Geschwind's contribution to the understanding of behavioral changes in temporal lobe epilepsy: the February 1974 lecture |journal=Epilepsy Behav |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=417–24 |date=August 2009 |pmid=19640791 |doi=10.1016/j.yebeh.2009.06.006|type=Biography, History article}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structures that may have an effect on hypergraphia when damaged due to temporal lobe epilepsy are the [[hippocampus]] and [[Wernicke's area]]. Aside from temporal lobe epilepsy, chemical causes may be responsible for inducing hypergraphia.

==Characteristics==
In some cases hypergraphia can manifest with compulsive drawing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=JK|last2=Robertson|first2=MM|last3=Trimble|first3=MR|title=The lateralising significance of hypergraphia in temporal lobe epilepsy|journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry|date=February 1982|volume=45|issue=2|pages=131–8|doi=10.1136/jnnp.45.2.131|pmid=7069424|pmc=1083040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawings by patients with hypergraphia exhibit repetition and a high level of detail, sometimes mixing both compulsive writing and drawing together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Neurology and General Medicine|last=Aminoff|first=Michael|publisher=|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing style===

Waxman and Geschwind were the first to describe hypergraphia, in the 1970s. The patients they observed displayed extensively compulsive detailed writing, sometimes with literary creativity. The patients kept diaries, which some used to meticulously document minute details of their everyday activities, write poetry, or create lists. Case 1 of their study wrote lists of her relatives, her likes and dislikes, and the furniture in her apartment. Beside lists, the patient wrote poetry, often with a moral or philosophical undertone. She described an incident in which she wrote the lyrics of a song she learned when she was 17 several hundred times and another incident in which she felt the urge to write a word over and over again. Another patient wrote [[Aphorism|aphorisms]] and certain sentences in repetition.&lt;ref name=Waxman1974&gt;{{cite journal|last=Waxman|first=SG|author2=Geschwind, N |title=Hypergraphia in temporal lobe epilepsy. 1974.|journal=Epilepsy &amp; Behavior|date=March 2005 |volume=6|issue=2|pages=282–91|pmid=15710320|doi=10.1016/j.yebeh.2004.11.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A patient from a separate study experienced "continuously rhyming in his head" for five years after a seizure and said that he "felt the need to write them down."&lt;ref name= Mendez1961&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mendez |first=MF |title=Hypergraphia for poetry in an epileptic patient|journal=The Journal of neuropsychiatry and clinical neurosciences|date=Fall 2005|volume=17|issue=4|pages=560–1|pmid=16388002|doi=10.1176/jnp.17.4.560}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patient did not talk in rhyme, nor did he read poetry. Language capacity and mental status were normal for this patient, except for recorded right temporal spikes on electroencephalograms. This patient had right hemisphere epilepsy. Functional MRI scans of other studies suggest that rhyming behavior is produced in the left hemisphere, but Mendez proposed that hyperactive electrical activity of the right hemisphere may induce a release of writing and rhyming abilities in the left hemisphere.&lt;ref name=Mendez1961 /&gt;

In addition to writing in different forms (poetry, books, repetition of one word), hypergraphia patients differ in the complexity of their writings. While some writers (e.g. [[Alice Flaherty]]) use their hypergraphia to help them write extensive papers and books, most patients do not write things of substance. Flaherty defines hypergraphia, as a result of temporal lobe epilepsy, as a condition that "increase[s] idea generation, sometimes at the expense of quality."&lt;ref name=Flaherty2005&gt;{{cite journal |author=Flaherty AW |title=Frontotemporal and dopaminergic control of idea generation and creative drive |journal=J. Comp. Neurol. |volume=493 |issue=1 |pages=147–53 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16254989 |pmc=2571074 |doi=10.1002/cne.20768|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients hospitalized with temporal lobe epilepsy and other disorders causing hypergraphia have written memos and lists (like their favorite songs) and recorded their dreams in extreme length and detail.&lt;ref name=Flaherty2005 /&gt; Some patients who also suffer from temporal lobe epilepsy record the times and locations of each seizure compiled as a list.&lt;ref name=Waxman1974 /&gt;

There are many accounts of patients writing in nonsensical patterns including writing in a center-seeking spiral starting around the edges of a piece of paper.&lt;ref name="Yamadori"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yamadori A, Mori E, Tabuchi M, Kudo Y, Mitani Y |title=Hypergraphia: a right hemisphere syndrome |journal=J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry |volume=49 |issue=10 |pages=1160–4 |date=October 1986 |pmid=3783177 |pmc=1029050 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.49.10.1160}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In one case study, a patient even wrote backwards, so that the writing could only be interpreted with the aid of a mirror.&lt;ref name=Waxman1974 /&gt; Sometimes the writing can consist of scribbles and frantic, random thoughts that are quickly jotted down on paper very frequently. Grammar can be present, but the meaning of these thoughts is generally hard to grasp and the sentences are loose.&lt;ref name="Yamadori" /&gt; In some cases, patients write extremely detailed accounts of events that are occurring or descriptions of where they are.&lt;ref name="Yamadori" /&gt;

==Causes==
Some studies have suggested that hypergraphia is related to [[bipolar disorder]], [[hypomania]], and [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name=Flaherty2011 /&gt; Although creative ability was observed in the patients of these studies, signs of creativity were observed, not hypergraphia specifically. Therefore, it is difficult to say with absolute certainty that hypergraphia is a symptom of these psychiatric illnesses because creativity in patients with bipolar disorder, hypomania, or schizophrenia may manifest into something aside from writing. However, other studies have shown significant accounts between hypergraphia and temporal lobe epilepsy&lt;ref name=Frequency_of_Hypergraphia&gt;{{ cite journal |last1 = Sachdev |first1 = H S |last2 = Waxman |first2 = S G |year = 1981 |title = Frequency of hypergraphia in temporal lobe epilepsy: an index of interictal behaviour syndrome. |journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry |quote = Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy tended to reply more frequently to a standard questionnaire, and wrote extensively (mean: 1301 words) as compared to others (mean: 106 words).

These findings suggest that hypergraphia may be a quantitative index of behaviour change in temporal lobe epilepsy. |pmid = 7241165 |pages = 358–60 |issue = 4 |volume = 44 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.44.4.358 |pmc=490963}}&lt;/ref&gt; and chemical causes. {{mcn|date=December 2013}}

=== Temporal lobe epilepsy ===
[[File:Gray728.svg|thumb|Image of the temporal lobe]]
Hypergraphia is a symptom of [[temporal lobe epilepsy]], a condition of reoccurring seizures caused by excessive neuronal activity, but it is not a common symptom among patients. Less than 10 percent of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy exhibit characteristics of hypergraphia.{{mcn|date=December 2013}} Temporal lobe epilepsy patients may exhibit irritability, discomfort, or an increasing feeling of dread if their writing activity is disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van Vugt P, Paquier P, Kees L, Cras P |title=Increased writing activity in neurological conditions: a review and clinical study |journal=J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry |volume=61 |issue=5 |pages=510–4 |date=November 1996 |pmid=8937347 |pmc=1074050 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.61.5.510}}&lt;/ref&gt; To elicit such responses when interrupting their writing suggests that hypergraphia is a compulsive condition, resulting in an obsessive motivation to write.&lt;ref name=Flaherty2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Flaherty|first=AW|title=Brain illness and creativity: mechanisms and treatment risks |journal=Canadian Journal of Psychiatry|date=March 2011|volume=56|issue=3 |pages=132–43|pmid=21443820|doi=10.1177/070674371105600303}}&lt;/ref&gt; A temporal lobe epilepsy may influence frontotemporal connections in such a way that the drive to write is increased in the [[frontal lobe]], beginning with the [[Prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]] and [[premotor cortex]] planning out what to write, and then leading to the [[motor cortex]] (located next to the [[central sulcus|central fissure]]) executing the physical movement of writing.&lt;ref name=Flaherty2011 /&gt;

Most temporal lobe epilepsy patients who suffer from hypergraphia can write words, but not all may have the capacity to write complete sentences that have meaning.&lt;ref name="Yamadori" /&gt;

=== Chemical ===
Certain drugs have been known to induce hypergraphia including [[donepezil]]. In one case study, a patient taking donepezil reported an elevation in mood and energy levels which led to hypergraphia and other excessive forms of speech (such as singing).&lt;ref name="Wicklund"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wicklund S, Wright M |title=Donepezil-induced mania |journal=J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=E27 |year=2012 |pmid=23037669 |doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11070160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six other cases of patients taking donepezil and experiencing mania have been previously reported. These patients also had cases of [[dementia]], cognitive impairment from a [[cerebral aneurysm]], bipolar I disorder, and/or depression. Researchers are unsure why donepezil can induce mania and hypergraphia. It could potentially result from an increase in [[acetylcholine]] levels, which would have an effect on the other neurotransmitters in the brain.&lt;ref name="Wicklund" /&gt;

Another potential cause of hypergraphia is from one of the body's neurotransmitters, [[dopamine]] (DA). Dopamine has been known to decrease latent inhibition, which causes a decrease in the ability to habituate to different stimuli. Low latent inhibition leads to an excessive level of stimulation and could contribute to the onset of hypergraphia and general creativity. This research implies that there is a direct correlation between the levels of DA between neuronal synapses and the level of creativity exhibited by the patient. DA agonists increase the levels of DA between synapses which results in higher levels of creativity, and the opposite is true for DA antagonists.&lt;ref name=Flaherty2005 /&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Cerebrum lobes.svg|thumbnail|left|Image of the brain lobes, including the temporal lobe and somatomotor (primary motor) cortex.]]
Several regions of the brain are involved in the act of writing. Primary areas are the superior [[parietal cortex]] and the [[frontal lobe]], the region of the brain that plans out movement.&lt;ref name=Planton&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Planton S, Jucla M, Roux FE, Démonet JF |title=The "handwriting brain": A meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies of motor versus orthographic processes |journal=Cortex |volume=49 |issue=10 |pages=2772–87 |year=2013 |pmid=23831432 |doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2013.05.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An area of the frontal lobe that is especially active is Exner's area, located in the [[premotor cortex]].&lt;ref name=Planton /&gt; The physical motion of the hand is controlled by the [[primary motor cortex]], also located in the frontal lobe, and the right cerebellum.&lt;ref name=Planton /&gt; Writing creatively and generating ideas, on the other hand, is controlled by the limbic system, specifically involving the activity of the hippocampus, which is important in the retrieval of long-term memories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shah C, Erhard K, Ortheil HJ, Kaza E, Kessler C, Lotze M |title=Neural correlates of creative writing: an fMRI study |journal=Hum Brain Mapp |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=1088–101 |date=May 2013 |pmid=22162145 |doi=10.1002/hbm.21493}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Words and ideas are cognized and understood by the [[temporal lobes]], and these temporal lobes are connected to the limbic system.&lt;ref name=Planton /&gt; 
[[File:Gray518.png|thumb|Image of the hippocampal gyrus]]

Although hypergraphia cannot be isolated to one specific part of the brain, some areas are known to have more of an effect than others.  The [[hippocampus]] has been found to play a role in the occurrence of temporal lobe epilepsy and schizophrenia.  In one study, rats induced with temporal lobe epilepsy showed an increase in dopamine neural activity in the hippocampus.  Because hypergraphia has been linked to temporal lobe epilepsy and schizophrenia, the hippocampus could have an effect on hypergraphia as well.&lt;ref name="Cifelli"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Cifelli P, Grace AA |title=Pilocarpine-induced temporal lobe epilepsy in the rat is associated with increased dopamine neuron activity|journal=The International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology|date=12 July 2011|volume=15|issue=07|pages=957–964|doi=10.1017/S1461145711001106}}&lt;!--|accessdate=10 November 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In another study, patients with bilateral hippocampal atrophy (BHA) showed signs of having Geschwind syndrome, including hypergraphia.&lt;ref name="Elst"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van Elst LT, Krishnamoorthy ES, Bäumer D, etal |title=Psychopathological profile in patients with severe bilateral hippocampal atrophy and temporal lobe epilepsy: evidence in support of the Geschwind syndrome?|journal=Epilepsy &amp; Behavior|date=June 2003|volume=4|issue=3|pages=291–7|pmid=12791331|doi=10.1016/s1525-5050(03)00084-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While epilepsy-induced hypergraphia is usually lateralized to the left cerebral hemisphere in the language areas, hypergraphia associated with lesions and other brain damage usually occurs in the right cerebral hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Ishikawa"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ishikawa|first=T|author2=Saito, M |author3=Fujimoto, S |author4= Imahashi, H |title=Ictal increased writing preceded by dysphasic seizures.|journal=Brain &amp; development|date=September 2000|volume=22|issue=6|pages=398–402|pmid=11042425|doi=10.1016/s0387-7604(00)00163-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lesions to the right side of the brain usually cause hypergraphia because they can disinhibit language function on the left side of the brain.&lt;ref name=Flaherty2005 /&gt; Hypergraphia has also been known to be caused by right hemisphere strokes and tumors.&lt;ref name="Yamadori" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Imamura"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Imamura|first=T|author2=Yamadori, A |author3=Tsuburaya, K |title=Hypergraphia associated with a brain tumour of the right cerebral hemisphere.|journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry|date=January 1992|volume=55|issue=1|pages=25–7|pmid=1548492|doi=10.1136/jnnp.55.1.25|pmc=488927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lesions to [[Wernicke's area]] (in the left temporal lobe) can increase speech output, which can sometimes manifest itself in writing.&lt;ref name=Flaherty2005 /&gt;

[[Lewis Carroll]], the author of ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'', is said to have had hypergraphia.&lt;ref name="Flaherty"&gt;Flaherty, ''The Midnight Disease'' p 26&lt;/ref&gt; In his lifetime he wrote over 98,000 letters varying in format.

{{Short description|A document format for reporting studies in the scientific literature}}
{{broader|Scientific article}}
In scientific writing, '''IMRAD''' or '''IMRaD''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪ|m|r|æ|d}}) ('''Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion''') is a common organizational structure (a document format). IMRaD is the most prominent norm for the structure of a [[scientific journal]] article of the [[original research]] type.&lt;ref name="pmid_15243643"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sollaci LB, Pereira MG | title = The introduction, methods, results, and discussion (IMRAD) structure: a fifty-year survey | journal = Journal of the Medical Library Association | volume = 92 | issue = 3 | pages = 364–7 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15243643 | pmc = 442179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Scientific Writing and Communication in Agriculture and Natural Resources|last=P.

==Overview==
[[File:Wineglass model for IMRaD structure..png|thumb|Fig.1: Wineglass model for IMRaD structure. The above scheme schematically shows how to line up the information in IMRaD writing. It has two characteristics, first one is "top-bottom symmetric shape", second one is "change of width", that means "the top is wide and it narrows towards the middle, and then widens again as it goes down toward the bottom". First one, "top-bottom symmetric shape" represents the symmetry of the story development. Second one, the change of the width of above diagram, represents the change of generality of the viewpoint.]]
Original research articles are typically structured in this basic order&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.routledge.com/Scientific-And-Medical-Communication-A-Guide-For-Effective-Practice/Mogull/p/book/9781138842557|title=Scientific And Medical Communication: A Guide For Effective Practice|last=Mogull|first=Scott A. | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=9781138842557|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hira&gt;{{cite book | first = Hilary | last = Glasman-deal | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2009 |title=Science research writing for non-native speakers of English |publisher=Imperial College Press |isbn=978-1-84816-310-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=George&gt;{{cite book | veditors= Hall GM | date = December 2012 |title=How to write a paper |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell, BMJ Books |isbn=978-0-470-67220-4 |edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Introduction – Why was the study undertaken? What was the [[research question]], the tested [[hypothesis]] or the purpose of the research?
*Methods – When, where, and how was the study done? What materials were used or who was included in the study groups (patients, etc.)?
*Results – What answer was found to the research question; what did the study find? Was the tested hypothesis true?
*Discussion – What might the answer imply and why does it matter? How does it fit in with what other researchers have found? What are the perspectives for future research?

The plot and the flow of the story of IMRaD is style writing are explained by a 'wine glass model'&lt;ref name=hira/&gt; or hourglass model.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Writing, compliant with IMRaD format (IMRaD writing) typically first presents "(a) the subject that positions the study from the wide perspective", "(b) outline of the study", develops through "(c) study method", and  "(d) the results", and concludes with "(e) outline and conclusion of the fruit of each topics", and "(f) the meaning of the study from the wide and general point of view".&lt;ref name=hira/&gt;  Here, (a) and (b) are mentioned in the section of the "Introduction", (c) and (d) are mentioned in the section of the "Method" and "Result" respectively, and (e) and (f) are mentioned in the section of the "Discussion" or "Conclusion".

In this sense, to explain how to line up the information in IMRaD writing, the 'wine glass model' (see the pattern diagram shown in Fig.1) will be helpful (see pp 2–3 of the Hilary Glasman-deal &lt;ref name=hira/&gt;). As mentioned in abovementioned textbook,&lt;ref name=hira/&gt; the scheme of 'wine glass model' have two characteristic. First one is "top-bottom symmetric shape" and Second one is "changing width" i.e. "the top is wide and it narrows towards the middle, and then widens again as it goes down toward the bottom". 
 
The First one, "top-bottom symmetric shape", represents the symmetry of the story development. Note the shape of the top trapezoid (representing the structure of Introduction) and the shape of the trapezoid at the bottom are reversed. This is expressing that the same subject introduced in Introduction will be taken up again in suitable formation for the section of Discussion/Conclusion in these section in the reversed order. (See the relationship between abovementioned  (a), (b) and (e), (f).)

The Second one, "the change of the width" of the schema shown in Fig.1, represents the change of generality of the view point. As along the flow of the story development, when the viewpoints are more general, the width of the diagram is expressed wider, and when they are more specialized and focused, the width is expressed narrower.

===As the standard format of academic journals===
The IMRAD format has been adopted by a steadily increasing number of [[academic journal]]s since the first half of the 20th century. The IMRAD structure has come to dominate academic writing in the sciences, most notably in [[empirical]] biomedicine.&lt;ref name="pmid_15243643"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Day |first=RA |title=The Origins of the Scientific Paper: The IMRAD Format |journal=American Medical Writers Association Journal |year=1989 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=16–18 |url=http://www.amwa.org/default/publications/journal/scanned/v04.2.pdf |access-date=2011-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927083129/http://www.amwa.org/default/publications/journal/scanned/v04.2.pdf |archive-date=September 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szklo|first=Moyses | name-list-format = vanc |title=Quality of scientific articles|journal=Revista de Saúde Pública|year=2006|volume=40|pages=30–35|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0034-89102006000400005&amp;nrm=iso|access-date=2011-06-17|doi=10.1590/s0034-89102006000400005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure of most [[public health journal]] articles reflects this trend. Although the IMRAD structure originates in the empirical sciences, it now also regularly appears in academic journals across a wide range of [[discipline (academia)|disciplines]]. Many scientific journals now not only prefer this structure but also use the IMRAD acronym as an instructional device in the instructions to their authors, recommending the use of the four terms as main headings. For example, it is explicitly recommended in the "[[Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals]]" issued by the [[International Committee of Medical Journal Editors]] (previously called the ''[[Vancouver guidelines]]''): &lt;blockquote&gt;
The text of observational and experimental articles is usually (but not necessarily) divided into the following sections: Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion. This so-called "IMRAD" structure is not an arbitrary publication format but rather a direct reflection of the process of scientific discovery. Long articles may need subheadings within some sections (especially Results and Discussion) to clarify their content. Other types of articles, such as case reports, reviews, and editorials, probably need to be formatted differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icmje.org/urm_full.pdf |title=Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals: Writing and Editing for Biomedical Publication - IV.A.1.a. General Principles |publisher=International Committee of Medical Journal Editors |access-date=2010-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706184319/http://www.icmje.org/urm_full.pdf |archive-date=July 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The IMRAD structure is also recommended for empirical studies in the 6th edition of the publication manual of the [[American Psychological Association]] ([[APA style]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=American Psychological Association|publisher=American Psychological Association|edition=6th|year=2010|title=Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association|isbn=978-1-4338-0562-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The APA publication manual is widely used by journals in the [[social science|social]], [[educational research|educational]] and [[behavioral science]]s.&lt;ref name=Tampere&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uta.fi/FAST/FIN/RESEARCH/imrad.html|title=The IMRAD Research Paper Format|publisher=Department of Translation Studies, [[University of Tampere]]|access-date=2008-10-22|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025070226/http://www.uta.fi/FAST/FIN/RESEARCH/imrad.html|archive-date=2008-10-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
The IMRAD structure has proved successful because it facilitates literature review, allowing readers to navigate articles more quickly to locate material relevant to their purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burrough-Boenisch|first=J|title=International Reading Strategies for IMRD Articles|journal=Written Communication|year=1999|volume=16|issue=3|pages=296–316|url=http://wcx.sagepub.com/content/16/3/296.abstract|access-date=2011-06-17|doi=10.1177/0741088399016003002}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the neat order of IMRAD rarely corresponds to the actual sequence of events or ideas of the research presented; the IMRAD structure effectively supports a reordering that eliminates unnecessary detail, and allows the reader to assess a well-ordered and noise-free presentation of the relevant and significant information. It allows the most relevant information to be presented clearly and logically to the readership, by summarizing the research process in an ideal sequence and without unnecessary detail.

==Caveats==
The idealised sequence of the IMRAD structure has on occasion been criticised for being too rigid and simplistic. In a radio talk in 1964 the [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel laureate]] [[Peter Medawar]] even criticised this instructive text structure for not giving a realistic representation of the thought processes of the writing scientist: "… the scientific paper may be a fraud because it misrepresents the processes of thought that accompanied or gave rise to the work that is described in the paper".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Medawar|first=P|title=Is the scientific paper fraudulent?|journal=The Saturday Review|year=1964|issue=August 1|pages=42–43|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1964aug01-00042|access-date=2012-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medawar's criticism was discussed at the XIXth General Assembly of the [[World Medical Association]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brain|first=L|title=Structure of the scientific paper|journal=Br Med J|volume=2|year=1965|issue=2|pages=868–869|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/2/5466/868.full.pdf|access-date=2011-06-19|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.5466.868 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Report of Editors' Conference |journal=BMJ |date=9 October 1965 |volume=2 |issue=5466 |pages=870–872 |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.5466.870 | url = http://www.bmj.com/content/2/5466/870.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; While respondents may argue that it is too much to ask from such a simple instructional device to carry the burden of representing the entire process of scientific discovery, Medawar's caveat expressed his belief that many students and faculty throughout academia treat the structure as a simple panacea. Medawar and others have given testimony both to the importance and to the limitations of the device.

==Abstract considerations==
In addition to the scientific article itself a brief [[abstract (summary)|abstract]] is usually required for publication. The abstract should, however, be composed to function as an autonomous text, even if some authors and readers may think of it as an almost integral part of the article. The increasing importance of well-formed autonomous abstracts may well be a consequence of the increasing use of searchable digital abstract archives, where a well-formed abstract will dramatically increase the probability for an article to be found by its optimal readership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Structured Abstract Initiative |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/resources/html/about/sa_initiative.html |publisher=Education Resources Information Center |access-date=2011-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608181554/http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/resources/html/about/sa_initiative.html |archive-date=June 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, there is a strong recent trend toward developing formal requirements for abstracts, most often structured on the IMRAD pattern, and often with strict additional specifications of topical content items that should be considered for inclusion in the abstract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ripple AM, Mork JG, Knecht LS, Humphreys BL | title = A retrospective cohort study of structured abstracts in MEDLINE, 1992-2006 | journal = Journal of the Medical Library Association | volume = 99 | issue = 2 | pages = 160–3 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21464855 | pmc = 3066587 | doi = 10.3163/1536-5050.99.2.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such abstracts are often referred to as "structured abstracts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Structured Abstracts|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/policy/structured_abstracts.html|author=U.S. National Library of Medicine|date=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growing importance of abstracts in the era of computerized literature search and [[information overload]] has led some users to modify the IMRAD acronym to AIMRAD, in order to give due emphasis to the abstract.

==Heading style variations==
Usually, the IMRAD article sections use the IMRAD words as [[wikt:heading|heading]]s. A few variations can occur, as follows: 
* Many journals have a convention of omitting the "Introduction" heading, based on the idea that the reader who begins reading an article does not need to be told that the beginning of the text is the introduction. This print-era proscription is fading since the advent of the Web era, when having an explicit "Introduction" heading helps with navigation via document maps and collapsible/expandable [[table of contents|TOC]] trees. (The same considerations are true regarding the presence or proscription of an explicit "Abstract" heading.)
* In some journals, the "Methods" heading may vary, being "Methods and materials", "Materials and methods", or similar phrases. Some journals mandate that exactly the same wording for this heading be used for all articles without exception; other journals reasonably accept whatever each submitted manuscript contains, as long as it is one of these sensible variants.
* The "Discussion" section may [[wikt:subsume|subsume]] any "Summary", "Conclusion", or "Conclusions" section, in which case there may or may not be any explicit "Summary", "Conclusion", or "Conclusions" [[wikt:subheading|subheading]]; or the "Summary"/"Conclusion"/"Conclusions" section may be a separate section, using an explicit heading on the same heading hierarchy level as the "Discussion" heading. Which of these variants to use as the default is a matter of each journal's chosen style, as is the question of whether the default style must be forced onto every article or whether sensible inter-article flexibility will be allowed.

==Other elements that are typical although not part of the [[acrostic]]==
* Disclosure statements (''see main article at [[conflicts of interest in academic publishing]]'')
** Reader's theme that is the point of this element's existence: "Why should I (the reader) trust or believe what you (the author) say? Are you just making money off of saying it?"
** Appear either in opening footnotes or a section of the article body
** Subtypes of disclosure:
*** Disclosure of funding (grants to the project)
*** Disclosure of conflict of interest (grants to individuals, jobs/salaries, stock or stock options)
* Clinical relevance statements
** Reader's theme that is the point of this element's existence: "Why should I (the reader) spend my time reading what you say? How is it relevant to my clinical practice? Basic research is nice, other people's cases are nice, but my time is triaged, so make your case for 'why bother'"
** Appear either as a display element (sidebar) or a section of the article body
** Format: short, a few sentences or bullet points
* Ethical compliance statements 
** Reader's theme that is the point of this element's existence: "Why should I believe that your study methods were ethical?"
** "We complied with the [[Declaration of Helsinki]]."
** "We got our study design approved by our local [[institutional review board]] before proceeding."
** "We got our study design approved by our local ethics committee before proceeding."
** "We treated our animals in accordance with our local [[Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee]]."

==Additional standardization (reporting guidelines)==

&lt;!-- [[Reporting standards in the scientific literature]] redirects here. This section needs to be [[WP:SPINOFF|spun off]] to a separate article titled "[[Reporting standards in the scientific literature]]", but I am not sure how soon I can devote time to building v1.0 of such an article. --&gt;

In the late 20th century and early 21st, the scientific communities found that the communicative value of journal articles was still much less than it could be if [[best practice]]s were developed, promoted, and enforced. Thus reporting guidelines (guidelines for how best to report information) arose. The general theme has been to create [[template (word processing)|templates]] and [[checklist]]s with the message to the user being, "your article is not complete until you have done all of these things." In the 1970s, the ICMJE (International Committee of Medical Journal Editors) released the [[Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals]] (Uniform Requirements or URM). Other such [[technical standard|standards]], mostly developed in the 1990s through 2010s, are listed below. The academic medicine community is working hard on trying to raise compliance with good reporting standards, but there is still much to be done;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Couzin-Frankel|first=Jennifer|date=2018-09-19|title=‘Journalologists’ use scientific methods to study academic publishing. Is their work improving science?|url=https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aav4758|journal=Science|language=en|doi=10.1126/science.aav4758|issn=0036-8075}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, a 2016 review of instructions for authors in 27 emergency medicine journals found insufficient mention of reporting standards,&lt;ref name="pmid_27881175"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sims MT, Henning NM, Wayant CC, Vassar M | title = Do emergency medicine journals promote trial registration and adherence to reporting guidelines? A survey of "Instructions for Authors" | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Trauma, Resuscitation and Emergency Medicine | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 137 | date = November 2016 | pmid = 27881175 | pmc = 5121955 | doi = 10.1186/s13049-016-0331-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2018 study found that even when journals' instructions for authors mention reporting standards, there is a difference between a mention or [[web badge|badge]] and enforcing the requirements that the mention or badge represents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Leung V, Rousseau-Blass F, Beauchamp G, Pang DS | title = ARRIVE has not ARRIVEd: Support for the ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting of in vivo Experiments) guidelines does not improve the reporting quality of papers in animal welfare, analgesia or anesthesia | journal = PLOS One | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = e0197882 | date = 2018-05-24 | pmid = 29795636 | pmc = 5967836 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0197882 | url = https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0197882 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of a need for best practices in [[data sharing]] has expanded the scope of these efforts beyond merely the pages of the journal article itself. In fact, from the most rigorous versions of the [[evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] perspective, the distance to go is still quite formidable.&lt;ref name="pmid_29595127"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jefferson T, Jørgensen L | title = Redefining the 'E' in EBM | journal = BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 46–47 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29595127 | doi = 10.1136/bmjebm-2018-110918 | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most researchers cannot be familiar with all of the many reporting standards that now exist, but it is enough to know which ones must be followed in one's own work, and to know where to look for details when needed. Several organizations provide help with this task of checking one's own compliance with the latest standards: 
* The [[EQUATOR Network]]
* The BioSharing collaboration ([https://biosharing.org/ biosharing.org])

Several important webpages on this topic are: 
* NLM's list at [https://www.nlm.nih.gov/services/research_report_guide.html Research Reporting Guidelines and Initiatives: By Organization] 
* The EQUATOR Network's list at [http://www.equator-network.org/toolkits/using-guidelines-in-journals/reporting-guidelines-and-journals-fact-fiction/ Reporting guidelines and journals: fact &amp; fiction]
* TRANSPOSE [https://transpose-publishing.github.io (Transparency in Scholarly Publishing for Open Scholarship Evolution)], “a grassroots initiative to build a crowdsourced database of journal policies,” allowing faster and easier lookup and comparison, and potentially spurring harmonization

'''Kursenieki language'''&lt;ref name="Kiseliunaite"/&gt; (Kursenieki: ''Kursisk valuod''; {{lang-lv|Kursenieku valoda}}) or '''Couronian language of Couronian isthmus'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Skujiņa|first=Valentīna|year=2007|title=Valodniecības pamatterminu skaidrojošā vārdnīca |url=http://termini.lza.lv/term.php?term=kursenieku%20valoda |location=Riga |publisher=Latvian Language Agency|page=|isbn=978-99-849-8369-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-de|Nehrungskurisch}} – 'Spit Curonian') is a dialect of the [[Latvian language]] spoken by the [[Kursenieki]] of the [[Curonian Spit]], a thin strip of land stretching between southwestern Lithuania and Russia. In the process of various migrations of the 14th–17th centuries, [[Curonians]] (already speaking a Latvian dialect) settled along the Curonian Spit in [[East Prussia]] and became known as [[Kursenieki]].

[[Image:Curonians kursenieki in 1649.png|thumb|left|200px|In 1649 settlement of the Kursenieki language speaking Kursenieki spanned from [[Klaipėda|Memel (Klaipėda)]] to [[Gdańsk|Danzig (Gdańsk)]] in [[Poland]].]]
Kursenieki language was influenced by [[Old Prussian]], [[Low German Language|Low German]], [[German language|High German]] and [[Samogitian dialect|the Samogitian dialect]] successively, and by the end of the 18th century new Curonian dialects had formed, with the dialect of the Curonian Spit being notably distinct, due to its isolation from the mainland. Kursenieki vocabulary published in 1927 shows: 60% of Curonian words were the same as Latvian, 26% were loanwords from “German” (i.e. Low German and High German), and 13% from Lithuanian dialects. The Kursenieki language is [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with Latvian, especially with its southwestern dialects, and Latvians can communicate easily with Kursenieki today.&lt;ref&gt;Pietsch, Richard: Deutsch-Kurisches Wörterbuch, Verlag Nordostdeutsches Kulturwerk Lüneburg 1991, p.17, {{ISBN|3-922296-60-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before [[World War II]], the Kursenieki language was a [[sociolect]] of Curonian fishermen of the Curonian Spit. In other spheres of everyday life Kursenieki used the Low German and High German languages.  
The events of the first half of the 20th century, including the Soviet and German [[Occupation of Baltic states|occupations of the Baltic states]] and later [[East Prussia]], led to the near extinction of the language, making it [[endangered language|severely endangered]]. Several remaining native speakers live in [[Germany]], having been [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expelled]] as "Germans" in the [[Evacuation of East Prussia|ethnic cleansing that took place in East Prussia]] after [[World War II]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12022">The '''language bioprogram theory''' or '''language bioprogram hypothesis'''&lt;ref&gt;See the Wiktionary entry for ''[[:wikt:bioprogram|bioprogram]].&lt;/ref&gt; ('''LBH''') is a theory arguing that the structural similarities between different [[creole language]]s cannot be solely attributed to their [[superstratum|superstrate]] and [[substratum|substrate]] languages.  As articulated mostly by [[Derek Bickerton]],&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1981}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1983}} {{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1984}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1988}}, and {{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[creolization]] occurs when the linguistic exposure of children in a community consists solely of a highly unstructured [[pidgin]]; these children use their innate language capacity to transform the pidgin, which characteristically has high syntactic variability,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1983|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; into a language with a highly structured grammar. As this capacity is universal, the grammars of these new languages have many similarities.

==Syntactic similarities==
By comparing [[Hawaiian Creole]], [[Haitian Creole]] and [[Sranan]], Bickerton identified twelve features which he believed to be integral to any creole:{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} 
*Sentence structure: [[subject–verb–object]] word order, with similar mechanisms for using word order to apply [[Focus (linguistics)|focus]] to one of these constituents.
*Articles: [[definite article]] applied to specific and identified noun phrase, [[indefinite article]] applied to specific and newly asserted noun phrase, and zero for nonspecific noun phrase.{{Dubious |Talk articles|date=February 2017}}
*TMA ([[tense–modality–aspect]]) systems
*distinction of realized and unrealized complements
*relativization and subject-copying
*negation
*existential and possessive
*[[copula (linguistics)|copula]]
*adjectives as verbs
*questions
*question words
*passive equivalents

Having analyzed these features, he believed that he was able to characterize, at least partly, the properties of innate grammar.&lt;ref name="Bickerton1983"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1983|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bickerton in his LBH, defined very precisely what he considers to be a creole: a language that has arisen out of a prior pidgin that had not existed for more than a generation and among a population where, at most, 20% were speakers of the dominant language and where the remaining 80% were linguistically diverse.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Such a definition excludes many languages that might be called creoles.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Moreover, lack of historical data makes it often impossible to evaluate such claims. In addition, many of the creole languages that fit this definition do not display all the twelve features,{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} while, according to {{Harvcoltxt|Mühlhäusler|1986}}, the left-out creoles often display more of them. Another problem, raised by {{Harvcoltxt|Mufwene|1986}}, is that if the same bioprogram was the starting point of all creoles, one must explain the differences between them, and language diversity in general, as the bioprogram is universal.

On the other hand, Bickerton, puts emphasis on children's contribution to the development of a creole and the abrupt character of this process.  For example, in {{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1983}}, he exhibits ungrammatical utterances made by English-speaking children between the ages of two and four, and argues that they are very similar to perfectly grammatical sentences of [[English-based creole languages]]:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Child 
!colspan=2|Creole
|-
|Where I can put it?||Where I can put om?||[[Hawaiian Creole|Hawaii]]
|-

|-
|Johnny big more than me||Johnny big more than me||Jamaica
|-
|Let Daddy get pen write it||Make Daddy get pen write am ||Guyana
|-
|I more better than Johnny||I more better than Johnny||Hawaii
|}

Normally, the grammar behind such utterances made by children is eventually altered as parents continue to model a grammar different from this innate one.  Presumably, if such children were removed from exposure to English parents, their grammars would continue to be that of creole languages.&lt;ref name="Bickerton1983" /&gt;

{{Harvcoltxt|Thomason|Kaufman|1988}} argue that this emphasis on child-input implies two different linguistic communities but that it is far simpler and more consistent with the data from multilingual communities to assume that the two groups form one speech community, and that both make contributions to the development of the emergent creole. Also, {{Harvcoltxt|Singler|1986}} points out that children were scarce on plantations, where creoles appeared, for several reasons, including absence of women as well as high rates of sterility, miscarriage, and infant mortality.

However, according to {{Harvcoltxt|Mühlhäusler|1986}}, the differences between the speech of children and adults in [[Tok Pisin]] are so big that communication is drastically hindered.

==Verbal system==
The verb [[grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] is typically close to an ideal tense–modality–aspect pattern.  In this system, the absence or presence of auxiliary [[verb]]s indicate tense (concurrent or anterior), modality (realis or irrealis) and aspect (punctual or progressive), and when present these auxiliaries occur in that order, and typically are based on similar meaning words in the pidgin or superstrate language.  Thus anterior tense may be marked by words such as ''bin'' in [[English language|English]]-based creoles (from ''been''), or ''té'' in French-based creoles (from ''été''), a future or subjunctive tense may be marked by ''go'' (from English ''go'') or ''al'' (from French ''aller''), and a non-punctual (non-stative) aspect by a word such as ''stei'' (from English ''stay'').

The above table demonstrates syntactic similarities of creole languages.  Stative verbs are those that cannot form the [[nonpunctual aspect]].  According to Bickerton, all observed creole languages strictly follow a structure that has the anterior particle precede the irreal particle, and the irreal particle precede the nonpunctual particle, although in certain languages some compounded forms may be replaced by other constructions.

==Creole Prototype==
[[John McWhorter|McWhorter]] contributed to the LBH with his Creole Prototype Theory, which argues that creoles exhibit some features that may be used to distinguish them from other languages without referring to the socio-historical dimension. According to {{Harvcoltxt|McWhorter|1992}}, creoles are much less likely than other languages:
#to use grammatical inflection via affixing,
#to develop productive, nontransparent derivational affixes, or
#to use tone to either mark lexical differences or as grammatical markers.

These features do not appear in creoles because creoles are relatively young languages, but they may appear later on in their grammars as the languages change. He does not claim that all creoles are ideal examples of the prototype, rather they exhibit varying degrees of conformity with the  prototype.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

==Proposed empirical study==

Bickerton proposed in 1976 an empirical test of his theory, which involved putting families speaking mutually unintelligible languages on a previously uninhabited island for three years.  Federal funding for the test was obtained, but the experiment was cancelled over concerns that [[informed consent]] could not be obtained, given the breadth of unknown possible hazards of participation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pri.org/stories/2009-04-24/linguistic-island-experiment A linguistic island experiment.]  The World, Public Radio International, 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Latrinalia''' is a type of deliberately inscribed marking made on [[latrine]]s: that is, bathrooms or lavatory walls.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/03/garden/03punk.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977282759&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.yahoo.com/music/blogs/stop-the-presses/rock-scariest-bathroom-immortalized-cbgb-movie-180133133.html&lt;/ref&gt; It can take the form of [[art]], [[drawing]]s, or [[language|word]]s, including [[poetry]] and personal reflections. Other types of latrinalia include political commentary as well as derogatory comments and pictures. When done without the [[property]] owner's [[consent]], it constitutes [[vandalism]]. Some venues have attempted to curb such vandalism by installing in the lavatory large [[blackboard]]s and providing free [[chalk]]; it is hoped that patrons will avail themselves of the blackboard and chalk rather than applying their latrinalia directly to the walls or toilet stalls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://130.212.44.5/storys01.php?storyid=3407 Golden Gate [X&amp;#93;Press Online | R.I.P.

==Etymology==
The late [[Alan Dundes]], a folklorist at [[University of California, Berkeley]], coined the term ''latrinalia'' in 1966 to refer to [[graffiti]] found in restrooms.&lt;ref name="Alan_Dundes"&gt;{{cite paper | author=[[Alan Dundes|Dundes, Alan]] | title=Here I Sit &amp;mdash; A Study of American Latrinalia | publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]]: Kroeber Anthropological Society Papers | date=1966 | url=http://sscl.berkeley.edu/~kas/kas_archives/vol_78/contents/volume_30-39.html | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051120032605/http://sscl.berkeley.edu/~kas/kas_archives/vol_78/contents/volume_30-39.html | archivedate=2005-11-20 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dundes preferred it over the term ''shithouse poetry'', as not all latrinalia is in verse or poetic form.&lt;ref name="Alan_Dundes" /&gt;

The word is derived from the [[compound (linguistics)|compounding]] of ''latrine'' (or toilet) and the [[Affix|suffix]] ''-alia'', which signifies a worthless collection of something &amp;mdash; in this case bathroom writings.

[[Image:The Hamptons.jpg|frame|right|James Merrill's childhood home was a 50-room mansion called "The Orchard," located in [[Southampton (village), New York|Southampton, New York]]]]

'''"Lost in Translation"''' is a [[narrative poetry|narrative poem]] by [[James Merrill]] (1926–1995), one of the most studied and celebrated of his shorter works. It was originally published in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine on April 8, 1974, and published in book form in [[1976 in literature|1976]] in ''[[Divine Comedies]]''.

The poem opens with a description of a summer Merrill spent as a child in a great house in [[The Hamptons]], with his [[governess]], waiting patiently for a rented wooden [[jigsaw puzzle]] to arrive in the mail from an [[Upper East Side]] [[Manhattan]] puzzle rental shop.

"Lost in Translation" is Merrill's most anthologized poem, and has been widely praised by literary critics including [[Harold Bloom]].

==Background==

Merrill wrote in his lifetime mainly for a select group of friends, fans, and critics, and expected readers of "Lost in Translation" to have some knowledge of his biography. Born in New York City, Merrill was the son of the founder of [[Merrill Lynch|the world's largest brokerage firm]]. He enjoyed a privileged upbringing in economic and cultural terms, although his intelligence and exceptional financial circumstances often made him feel lonely as a child. Merrill was the only son of [[Charles E. Merrill]] and Hellen Ingram. (Merrill had two older half siblings from his father's first marriage.)

Given that his parents were often preoccupied, his father with [[business]], his mother with [[socialite|social obligations]], Merrill developed a number of close relationships with household staff. "Lost in Translation" describes a profound childhood bond with the woman who taught him [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]]. Merrill's parents would divorce in 1939, when Merrill was thirteen years old, in a scandal that was front-page news on the ''[[New York Times]]''.

Not only is "Lost in Translation" a poem about a child putting together a jigsaw puzzle, it is an interpretive puzzle, designed to engage a reader's interest in solving mysteries at various narrative levels.

The poem is dedicated to Merrill's friend, the distinguished poet, critic, and translator [[Richard Howard]]. It consists of 215 lines with an additional four line [[epigraph (literature)|epigraph]]. The poem is mainly in unrhymed [[pentameter]] but includes a section in [[Ruba'i|Rubaiyat]] [[quatrain]] [[stanza]]s. "Lost in Translation" may be classified as an [[autobiographical]] [[narrative]] or [[narrative poem]], but is better understood as a series of [[story within a story|embedded narratives (stories within a story)]].

== Epigraph ==
Unusual for Merrill, the poem bears a mysterious four-line epigraph in [[German language|German]], which is printed without [[translation]] or [[Attribution (journalism)|attribution]]:

: ''Diese Tage, die leer dir scheinen''
: ''und wertlos für das All,''
: ''haben Wurzeln zwischen den Steinen''
: ''und trinken dort überall.''

In [[James Merrill]]'s own English version of this epigraph (published in 1985 in ''[[Late Settings]]''), these four lines are translated into English as follows:

: ''These days which, like yourself,''
: ''Seem empty and effaced''
: ''Have avid roots that delve''
: ''To work deep in the waste.''

== Synopsis ==
[[Image:Alsace map.png|thumb|right|200px|'''"Mademoiselle does borders...."''' Merrill's childhood governess was from [[Alsace]], on the border between France and Germany.]]

In "Lost in Translation", the narrator's puzzle-making companion is his French [[governess]], whom he repeatedly refers to as ''Mademoiselle.'' Part mother, part teacher, part [[nanny]], part servant, she is described by Merrill as "stout, plain, carrot-haired, devout."

At one point in the poem, Mademoiselle speaks the same phrase in French and in German. In addition to playing with the boy's [[marionette]]s and doing jigsaw puzzles with him, Mademoiselle is teaching the young James Merrill languages which would be critical to making him the sophisticated and urbane [[lyric poet]] of later life. By giving name, in several languages, to objects and tasks around the home, Mademoiselle helps the young James Merrill come to understand a doubleness about language itself, that objects and activities can have different names and connotations across languages.

From the child's point of view, the "puzzle" goes well beyond what is taking place on the card table. Merrill is puzzling through the mystery of his existence, puzzling through the mystery of what the world is, what objects are, what people do in life. An unspoken puzzle is solved when the young Merrill determines what his relationship to Mademoiselle is, given the frequent absence of his own mother. Mademoiselle knows "her place", he writes, indicating his first consciousness of his own class privilege, as well as (perhaps) the limits placed on Mademoiselle's maternal role.

Yet other puzzles are not solved until later in life. At one point the narrator's voice modulates into that of an adult. We find out that Mademoiselle hid her true origins from the boy (and from his family) because of the political tensions leading up to 1939 and to the outbreak of World War II. Mademoiselle claimed to be French and hid her German or [[Alsace|Alsatian]] birth. She presumably gained a French [[family name]] through marriage to a soldier who died in the [[Battle of Verdun]] in World War I (1914–1918). Mademoiselle could let no one know she was German for fear of losing her job and her employers' trust. This explains the fact that Merrill's own French, learned in imitation of his governess, was always spoken with a slight German accent. The boy finds out the full truth only as an adult, after a chance conversation with Mademoiselle's grown nephew, a [[United Nations]] [[Interpreting|interpreter]], who tells him the story of the governess's true origins.

The poem includes several other secondary narratives, including a section in which the puzzle itself is put together. Inspired by [[Omar Khayyám]]'s ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|Rubaiyat]]'' quatrains, Merrill describes an imaginary [[harem]]-like 19th century [[orientalism|Orientalist]] painting, by an alleged follower of [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]], that begins to appear as the puzzle pieces are put together. When the puzzle is nearly done, the piece that was missing the whole time is found under the table at the boy's feet. The missing piece is, in fact, an image of the boy's feet. When it is put in place, the portrait of the little boy in the puzzle is finally complete.

=== Puzzle ===
[[Image:rilke.jpg|thumb|200px|left|'''"This grown man reenters, wearing grey..."''']]

At the center of the poem is a mysterious sequence in which the poet, attending a present-day [[séance]], describes a [[Medium (spirituality)|medium]] who is able to divine that a piece of a wooden jigsaw puzzle has been concealed inside a box.

To understand "Lost in Translation", the reader must work out and solve a [[puzzle]] in the narrative text, revealed by a confession Merrill the adult makes at the end of the poem. The little boy has apparently kept a piece of the jigsaw puzzle, in the shape of a [[palm tree]], throughout his life. This fact has jogged the memory in Merrill of a poem called "Palme" by the French [[Symbolist poetry|Symbolist]] poet [[Paul Valéry]] (1871–1945), and that memory in turn has reminded Merrill of a German translation he has once seen of that same poem by poet [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] (1875–1926).

The poet knows that he has seen and read the Rilke translation before, because he can picture the words on the page. "The owlet umlaut peeps and hoots/ Above the open vowel", Merrill writes, in some of the poem's most quoted lines. Yet despite remembering the experience of reading the Rilke translation, he cannot locate a copy in [[Athens, Greece]] (where Merrill and his partner [[David Noyes Jackson|David Jackson]] were living six months of the year), and begins to doubt whether it exists except in his imagination. The poem "Lost in Translation" assumes the form of a letter to Richard Howard seeking an actual copy of that translation.

=== Solution ===
[[Image:1859-Martinique.web.jpg|thumb|right|200px|'''"An inchling, innocently branching [[Arecaceae|palm]]..."''']]

But the translation turns out not to have been lost, or a figment of the poet's imagination, for it is used to write the poem "Lost In Translation." The German epigraph at the beginning of the poem offers the key clue here. The four lines come from that "lost" German translation by Rilke of Valéry's "Palme". (Merrill's own English translation of "Palme" is the source of the translated quatrain above. See Merrill's "Paul Valéry: ''Palme''" in ''[[Late Settings]]'', 1985.)

The original in French:

: ''Ces jours qui te semblent vides
: ''Et perdus pour l'univers
: ''Ont des racines avides
: ''Qui travaillent les déserts.

from Paul Valéry, Charmes (1922) [http://wikilivres.ca/wiki/Palme Palme classical dizain 7th Stanza ]

The solution to the puzzle of the poem is hidden in plain sight all along. "Nothing's lost", Merrill suggests, when it comes to translating experience or memory, at least according to the way Merrill understands our human experience. The poem's coda salutes the power of the transformative imagination to recover meaning in the world from all we see and remember. Its language and phrasing offer a veiled tribute by Merrill to the poet he most admired from his father's generation, [[Wallace Stevens]] (author of "The Palm at the End of the Mind"):

:But nothing's lost. Or else: all is translation
:And every bit of us is lost in it...
:And in that loss a self-effacing tree,
:Color of context, imperceptibly
:Rustling with its angel, turns the waste
:To shade and fiber, milk and memory.

'''Língua dos Pês''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], ''P Language'') is a [[Language game (linguistics)|language game]] spoken in [[Brazil]] and [[Portugal]] with [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. It is also known in other languages, such as [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Afrikaans]].

==Function==

There are at least three different "dialects," or variations, of Língua do Pê.

==="Double talk" dialect===

This "dialect" of Língua do Pê is just like the [[Jeringonza]] and the Idioma F language games in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].  It works by repeating the [[Syllable rime|rime]] of each syllable, beginning it with ''p'' (''pê'' in Portuguese).  Examples:

* você → ''vo-po-cê-pê''
* gato → ''ga-pa-to-po''
* menino → ''me-pe-ni-pi-no-po''

===Vowel-changing dialect===

This "dialect" is like the one described above, except that some vowels are changed.  When an open syllable (one that ends in a vowel) has {{IPA|[o]}} or {{IPA|[e]}} as its vowel, it is changed to {{IPA|[ɔ]}} and {{IPA|[ɛ]}}, respectively. 

: '''Example:'''

* {{IPA|[vɔˈpɔsɛˈpɛ korˈportouˈpou ɔˈpɔ seuˈpeu kaˈpabɛˈpɛlɔˈpɔ]}}
* ''Você cortou o seu cabelo?'' (Did you cut your hair?)

Please note that the syllables beginning with ''p'' are stressed, not the original syllables.

==="Pê" dialect===

This "dialect" is more like Kongarian (a language game spoken with Hungarian) than the other "dialects" of Língua do Pê.  To speak it, the syllable ''pê'' is inserted before every syllable. This is the variant most used in Brazilian Portuguese, while the others are more common in European Portuguese.

: '''Example:'''

* ''pêLem pêBra pêCo pêMo pêE pêRa pêLe pêGal?''
* Lembra como era legal? (Do you remember how cool it was?)

===Dutch===

In the Netherlands, the most common version is to instert the syllable "ep" before every sonant.

:'''Example:'''

*De boer woont op het platteland. (The farmer lives in the countryside.)
*''Depe bepoer wepoont epop hepet plepattepelepand.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10695">In [[linguistics]], '''meaning''' is the information or concepts that a sender intends to convey, or does convey, in communication with a receiver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=meaning|website=Dictionary.com Unabridged|publisher=Random House, Inc.|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/meaning|accessdate=December 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.njit.edu/~lipuma/352comproc/comproc.htm|title=Communication Process|author=Nick Sanchez|publisher=New Jersey Institute of Technology|accessdate=January 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The sources of ambiguity ==
{{+rs|date=March 2016}}
Ambiguity means confusion about what is conveyed, since the current context may lead to different interpretations of meaning. Many words in many languages have [[polysemy|multiple definitions]]. Ambiguity is an effect of a rupture of the [[Law of identity|rule of identity]] in the context of the exchange of information. Particularly the ''sender'' may be physically absent, and the contexts explicitly divergent, such as will be the case when the receptor is a reader and the ''sender'' was a writer.

=== Pragmatics ===
{{main|Pragmatics}}

Pragmatics is the study of how context affects meaning.  The two primary forms of context important to pragmatics are [[linguistic context]] and situation context.

Linguistic context is how meaning is understood without relying on intent and assumptions.  In applied pragmatics, for example, meaning is formed through sensory experiences, even though sensory stimulus cannot be easily articulated in language or signs.  Pragmatics, then, reveals that meaning is both something affected by and affecting the world.  Meaning is something contextual with respect to language and the world, and is also something active toward other meanings and the world. Linguistic context becomes important when looking at particular linguistic problems such as that of pronouns.

Situation context refers to every non-linguistic factor that affects the meaning of a phrase. An example of situation context can be seen in the phrase "it's cold in here", which can either be a simple statement of fact or a request to turn up the heat, depending on, among other things, whether or not it is believed to be in the listener's power to affect the temperature.

=== Semantic meaning ===
{{main|Semantics}}

The relationship between words and their referents is called semantic.&lt;ref&gt;https://tr.scribd.com/document/137895627/%D0%92-%D0%9D-%D0%9A%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2-%D0%9A%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0&lt;/ref&gt; Semantics is the study of how meaning is conveyed through [[sign (semiotics)|sign]]s and [[language]]. Understanding how [[facial expressions]], [[body language]], and [[intonation (linguistics)|tone]] affect meaning, and how words, phrases, sentences, and punctuation relate to meaning are examples. Various subgroups of semantics are studied within the fields of linguistics, logic and [[Semantics (computer science)|computing]]. For example, [[Formal semantics (linguistics)|linguistic semantics]] includes the history of how words have been used in the past; [[Formal semantics (logic)|logical semantics]] includes how people mean and refer in terms of likely intent and assumptions.

During the 19th century, [[John Stuart Mill]] defined semantic meaning with the words "denotation" and "connotation".&lt;ref name="JSM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill/#LanLog |title=John Stuart Mill |author=Fred Wilson |date=Jan 3, 2002 |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Stanford |accessdate=October 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A denotation is the literal or primary meaning of a word. Connotations are ideas or feelings that a word invokes for a person in addition to its literal or primary meaning.

The original use of "meaning" as understood early in the 20th century occurred through [[Lady Welby]], after her daughter translated the term "semantics" from French.

=== Conceptual meaning ===
{{main|Concept}}

Languages allow information to be conveyed even when the specific words used are not known by the reader or listener. People connect words with meaning and use words to refer to concepts. A person's intentions affect what is meant. ''Meaning'' (in English) as ''intent'' harkens back to the Anglo-Saxons and is associated today still, with the German verb ''[[wikt:meinen|meinen]]'' as to think or intend.

== Semiotics ==
{{main|Semiotics}}

[[Ferdinand de Saussure]], in founding semiology, his original subset of the semiotics, started describing language in terms of ''Signs'', dividing those ''signs'' in turn into ''signifieds'' and ''signifiers''.  The signifier is the [[perception|perceptive]] side of a sign, thus the [[Hearing|sound]] form in case of oral language.  The signified is the signification ([[semantics|semantic]]) side, the mental construction or image associated with the sound, by either a speaker and hearer. A sign, then, is essentially a relationship between signified and signifier.

Signs are essentially [[conventional]], as any foreign language student is well aware: there is no reason that ''bat'' couldn't mean "body of water" or even "that bust of Napoleon over there". Since the choice of signifiers is ultimately arbitrary, the meaning cannot somehow be ''in'' the signifier. Saussure instead defers meaning to the sign itself: meaning is ultimately the same thing as the sign, and ''meaning'' means that relationship is between signified and signifier. All meaning is both within us and communal, thus [[culture|cultural]]. Signs "mean" by reference to our internal lexicon and grammar, and despite there being a matter of convention, so the communal part, signs also, because of the individual's uniqueness, can mean something only to the individual (what ''red'' means to one person may not be what ''red'' means to another, either in absolute value, or by including what's suggested by the context). However, while meanings carried by one given set of signifiers may vary to some extent from individual to individual, only those meanings that stay within a boundary are seen by other speakers of the language to belong to the language: if one were to refer to smells as red, most other speakers would assume the person is talking nonsense (although statements like this are common among people who experience [[synesthesia]], or in poetry).

'''Metalinguistic awareness''' refers to the ability to objectify [[language]] as a process as well as an artifact. The concept of metalinguistic awareness is helpful in explaining the execution and transfer of [[natural language|linguistic]] [[knowledge]] across languages (e.g. [[code switching]] as well as translation among bilinguals).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://coe.sdsu.edu/people/jmora/moramodules/MetaLingResearch.htm |date= 2001 |archive-date= 2010 |archive-url= https://dps-ela.wikispaces.com/file/detail/JK+Mora+Metalinguistic+Awareness+as+Defined|format= doc  |title= Metalinguistic Awareness as Defined Through Research  |last= Mora |first= Jill Kerper |publisher= San Diego State University |accessdate= 2009-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Metalinguistics can be classified as the ability to consciously reflect on the nature of language, by using the following skills: 

# an awareness that language has a potential greater than that of simple symbols (it goes beyond the meaning)
# an awareness that words are separable from their referents (meaning resides in the mind, not in the name, i.e. Sonia is Sonia, and I will be the same person even if somebody calls me another name)
# an awareness that language has a structure that can be manipulated (realizing that language is malleable: you can change and write things in many different ways (for example, if something is written in a grammatically incorrect way, you can change it)).

Metalinguistic awareness is also known as "metalinguistic ability", which can be defined similarly as [[metacognition]] ("knowing about knowing"). Metalinguistic awareness can also be defined as the ability to reflect on the use of language. As metalinguistic awareness grows, children begin to recognize that statements may have a literal meaning and an implied meaning. They begin to make more frequent and sophisticated use of metaphors such as the simile, "We packed the room like sardines". Between the ages of 6 and 8 most children begin to expand upon their metalinguistic awareness and start to recognize irony and sarcasm. These concepts require the child to understand the subtleties of an utterance's social and cultural context.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10550">[[File:Holbein-erasmus.jpg|thumb|240px|The [[Renaissance humanist]] scholar [[Desiderius Erasmus]] of Rotterdam may have coined the word.]]
A '''mumpsimus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ʌ|m|p|s|ɪ|m|ə|s}}) a "traditional custom obstinately adhered to however unreasonable it may be",{{sfn|Scarlett|Roland|1972|p=236}} or "someone who obstinately clings to an error, bad habit or prejudice, even after the foible has been exposed and the person humiliated; also, any error, bad habit, or prejudice clung to in this fashion".{{sfn|Elster|2006|p=29}} Thus it may describe behaviour or the person who behaves thus. For example, ''[[wikt:for all intensive purposes|all intensive purposes]]'' is a common [[eggcorn]] of the [[fixed expression]] ''all intents and purposes''; if a person who continues to say the eggcorn even after being made aware of the correct form, either the speaker or the phrase may be called a mumpsimus.

==Origin==
The term originates from an [[apocryphal]] story about a poorly educated [[Catholic priest]] saying [[Latin liturgical rites|Latin mass]] who, in reciting the [[postcommunion]] prayer {{lang|la|Quod ore sumpsimus, Domine}} (meaning: "What we have received in the mouth, Lord"), instead of  {{lang|la|sumpsimus}} (meaning: "we have received") substitutes the non-word ''mumpsimus'', presumably as a [[mondegreen]]. After being made aware of his mistake, he nevertheless persisted with his erroneous version, whether from stubbornness, force of habit, or refusing to believe he was mistaken.{{sfn|Leighton|Leighton|2003|p=39}}{{sfn |Derbyshire |1981 |p=258}}

The story was told by [[Desiderius Erasmus]] (1466–1536) in a letter he wrote in August 1516 to [[Henry Bullock]].{{sfn|Marshall|2001|p=513}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Correspondence of Erasmus: Letters 446 to 593, 1516-1517|chapter=Letter 456: to Henry Bullock|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=EGzfhhQ5NhYC&amp;pg=PA46 |author1=Desiderius Erasmus|author2=Roger Aubrey|author3=Baskerville Mynors|author4=Douglas Ferguson|author5=Scott Thomson |volume=4 |page=46 |publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erasmus used it as an analogy with those who refused to accept that ''[[Novum Instrumentum omne]]'', his edition of the [[Greek New Testament]], corrected errors in the Latin [[Vulgate]]. The English diplomat [[Richard Pace]] (1482–1536) included a variant in his 1517 work ''De Fructu qui ex Doctrina Percipitur'', where the priest was English and had been saying ''mumpsimus'' for thirty years when corrected.{{sfn|Hall|1873|p=137}} While Pace's book (written in Latin) is credited by the first edition of the  ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' as the origin of "mumpsimus",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/oed6barch#page/764/mode/1up |page=764 |volume=6: M–N |edition=1st |title=Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |date=1908 |editor-last=Bradley |editor-first=Henry |accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pace acknowledged his borrowing in a 1517 letter to Erasmus.{{sfn|Marshall|2001|p=514}} "Mumpsimus and sumpsimus" became proverbial among Protestants in the early [[English Reformation]].{{sfn|Marshall|2001}}

==Usage==
[[File:William Tyndale.jpg|thumb|240px|[[William Tyndale]] may have been the first to use the word in an English-language book.]]
Mumpsimus soon entered the language as a [[Cant (language)|cant]] word widely used by 16th-century writers.{{sfn|Elyot|1883|p=289}}
In [[William Tyndale]]'s 1530 book ''Practice of Prelates'', the word was used in the sense of a stubborn opponent to Tyndale's views. He said that the men whom Cardinal Wolsey had asked to find reasons why [[Catherine of Aragon]] was not truly the wife of King [[Henry VIII of England]] were "...all lawyers, and other doctors, mumpsimuses of divinity".{{sfn|Marshall|2001|p=516}} 
In 1531 Sir [[Thomas Elyot]] used the word in his ''Boke named the Gouvernor'' where he said of ''Magnanimitie'' that the word, "...being yet straunge, as late borowed out of the Latyne, shall not content all men, and specially them whome nothing contenteth out of their accustomed mumpsimus".{{sfn|Marshall|2001|p=515}}

Henry VIII in his speech at the [[State Opening of Parliament]] on Christmas Eve 1545 said:{{sfn|Dodd|1839|p=453}}
{{quote|
I see and hear daily, that you of the clergy preach one against  another, teach, one contrary to another, inveigh one against another,  without charity or discretion. Some be too stiff in their old ''mumpsimus'',  other be too busy and curious in their new ''sumpsimus''. Thus, all men  almost be in variety and discord, and few or none do preach, truly and sincerely, the word of God, according as they ought to do.
}}
[[Peter Heylin]] refers to the king's saying in his 1631 ''The History of St. George of Cappadocia'' when he talks of "...those self-conceited ones which are so stiffe&amp;mdash;as King Harry used to say&amp;mdash;in their new sumpsimus..."{{sfn|Hall|1873|p=137}} 
[[Hugh Latimer]] (1487–1555) used the term in two sermons he preached in 1552, saying: "When my neighbour is taught, and knoweth the truth, and will not believe it, but will abide in his old ''mumpsimus''..." and again: "Some be so obstinate in their old ''mumpsimus'', that they cannot abide the true doctrine of God."{{sfn|Foxe|1859|p=141}}

In an 1883 polemic on errors in translations of the Christian Bible, [[John Burgon]] says: "If men prefer ''their'' 'mumpsimus' to ''our'' 'sumpsimus', let them by all means have it: but pray let them keep their rubbish to themselves&amp;mdash;and at least leave our SAVIOUR's words alone."{{sfn|Burgon|1883|p=218}}

[[Eugene T. Maleska]], 1970s editor of [[The New York Times crossword puzzle|''The New York Times'' crossword puzzle]], received "dozens of letters" after "mumpsimus" appeared as an answer; he had felt that "it was time to revive the obsolete noun".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Maleska |first1=Eugene T. |title=Confessions Of A Crossword Editor |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/28/archives/confessions-of-a-crossword-editor.html |accessdate=14 September 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=28 October 1979 |page=SM24 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A. Leslie Derbyshire applied it in a 1981 [[management science]] book to managers who know how to do a better job but choose not to.{{sfn|Derbyshire|1981|p=258}} ''[[Garner's Modern English Usage]]'' says the word could describe [[George W. Bush]] because of his persistent habit of pronouncing "nuclear" as "[[nucular]]", despite the error being widely reported.{{sfn|Garner|2009|p=3709}}

The '''National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters Ltd''' (known as '''NAATI''') is the national standards and accreditation body for translators and [[Language interpretation|interpreters]] in Australia. NAATI's mission, as outlined in the NAATI Constitution, is to set and maintain high national standards in translating and interpreting to enable the existence of a pool of accredited translators and interpreters responsive to the changing needs and demography of the Australian community. The core focus of the company is issuing [[credential]]s (known as accreditations or recognitions) for practitioners who wish to work as translators and interpreters in Australia.

==Current Structure==
NAATI is a profit company that is jointly owned by the [[Commonwealth of Australia|Commonwealth]], [[States and territories of Australia|State and Territory]] governments of Australia. It is governed by a board of directors who are appointed by the members.

The members of NAATI are the nine [[Minister (government)|ministers]] who are responsible for multicultural affairs and/or [[citizenship]] in the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments. Members may appoint a representative to exercise any of their powers in relation to NAATI. These Member Representatives are separate to the NAATI board of directors.

The current members of NAATI include:

==Operational functions==
NAATI provides eight key services to assist individuals gain and maintain a credential to work as a translator or interpreter in Australia. These services include:

* Accreditation testing
* Skills assessments for migration purposes
There are two types of NAATI credentials – accreditation and recognition.

NAATI accreditation is an acknowledgement that an individual has demonstrated the ability to meet the professional standards required by the translation and interpreting industry. NAATI assesses practitioners and aspiring translators and interpreters against these standards so that English speaking and non-English speaking Australians can interact effectively with each other.

There are a couple of different ways you can gain NAATI accreditation, including:

NAATI recognition is granted in emerging languages or languages with very low community demand for which NAATI does not offer accreditation. The granting of NAATI recognition is an acknowledgement that an individual has recent and regular experience as a translator and/or interpreter with no defined skill level.

==Outline of NAATI credentials==
Under NAATI's current system, there are ten different types of credentials. These are listed in the table below.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Credential Name !! Pre-1992 Level !! Description
|-
| Conference Interpreter (Senior) || 5 || This is the highest level of NAATI interpreting accreditation. It reflects a level of excellence in conference interpreting, recognised through demonstrated extensive experience and international leadership. It encompasses and builds on the competencies of Conference Interpreter accreditation.
|-
| Advanced Translator (Senior) || 5 || This is the highest level of NAATI translating accreditation. It reflects a level of excellence in specialised translating, recognised through demonstrated extensive experience and international leadership. It encompasses and builds on the competencies of Advanced Translator accreditation.
|-
| Conference Interpreter || 4 (I) || This represents the level of competence required to handle complex, technical and sophisticated interpreting, in both consecutive and simultaneous modes, in line with recognised international practice. Conference interpreters operate in diverse situations including at conferences, high-level negotiations, court proceedings or may choose to specialise in a particular area(s).
|-
| Advanced Translator || 4 (T) || This represents the level of competence required to handle complex, technical and sophisticated translations in line with recognised international practice. Advanced Translators operate in diverse situations and may choose to specialise in a particular area(s) – including translating technical manuals, research papers, conferences, high-level negotiations and court proceedings.
|-
| Professional Interpreter || 3 (I) || This represents the minimum level of competence for professional interpreting and is the minimum level recommended by NAATI for work in most settings including banking, law, health, social and community services. Professional Interpreters are capable of interpreting across a wide range of semi-specialised situations and are capable of using the consecutive mode to interpret speeches or presentations.
|-
| Professional Translator || 3 (T) || This represents the minimum level of competence for professional translating and is the minimum level recommended by NAATI for work in settings including banking, law, health, social and community services. Translators at this level work across a wide range of subjects involving documents with specialised content.
|-
| Paraprofessional Interpreter || 2 (I) || This represents a level of competence in interpreting for the purpose of general conversations. Paraprofessional Interpreters generally undertake the interpretation of non-specialist dialogues. Practitioners at this level are encouraged to obtain Professional level accreditation if available.
|-
| Paraprofessional Translator || 2 (T) || This represents a level of competence enabling the production of a translation of non-specialised information (e.g. a birth certificate). Practitioners at this level are encouraged to obtain Professional level accreditation if available.
|-
| Recognised Interpreter || – || This credential is an acknowledgement that at the time of the award the applicant has had recent and regular work experience as an interpreter, but no level of proficiency is specified. Recognised interpreters are encouraged to obtain accreditation as it becomes available.
|-
| Recognised Translator || – || This credential is an acknowledgement that at the time of the award the applicant has had recent and regular work experience as a translator, but no level of proficiency is specified. Recognised translators are encouraged to obtain accreditation as it becomes available. 
|}

NAATI translator accreditation (professional level or higher) is usually awarded in one of the following directions:

* From a [[Languages Other Than English|Language other Than English]] (LOTE) into English; or
* From English into a LOTE; or
* Both directions.

NAATI interpreter accreditations (at all levels) are awarded in both directions.

Occasionally, NAATI has awarded accreditation in a language combination that does not feature English at the Conference Interpreter or Advanced Translator level e.g. Advanced Translator French to German or Conference Interpreter (Senior) French to/from Russian. This sort of accreditation can only be awarded on the basis of a professional membership of an international association such as [[International Association of Conference Interpreters|AIIC]] or AITC.

A '''neologism''' ({{IPAc-en|n|iː|ˈ|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|ɪ|z|əm}}; from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] νέο- ''néo-'', "new" and λόγος ''lógos'', "speech, utterance") is a relatively recent or isolated term, word, or phrase that may be in the process of entering common use, but that has not yet been fully accepted into mainstream language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=James M.|editor1-last=Malmkjær|editor1-first=Kirsten|title=The Linguistics encyclopedia|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-203-43286-X|page=601|edition=Ebook}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neologisms are often directly attributable to a specific person, publication, period, or event. In the process of language formation, neologisms are more mature than [[protologism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gryniuk|first1=D|title=On Institutionalization and De-Institutionalization of Late 1990s Neologisms|date=2015|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|page=150|quote=This process [of lexicalization] does not seem to be coincidental because neologisms themselves are prone to go through certain stages of transformation. They begin as ''unstable'' creations (otherwise called ''protologisms''), that is, they are extremely new, being proposed, or being used only by a small subculture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
Neologisms are often created by combining existing words (see [[compound noun and adjective]]) or by giving words new and unique [[suffix]]es or [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]]es. [[Portmanteaux]] are combined words that are sometimes used commonly. "Brunch" is an example of a portmanteau word (breakfast + lunch).  [[Lewis Carroll|Lewis Carroll's]] "snark" (snake + shark) is also a portmanteau. Neologisms also can be created through [[abbreviation]] or [[acronym]], by intentionally [[rhyme|rhyming]] with existing words or simply through playing with sounds.

Neologisms can become popular through [[memetics]], by way of [[mass media]], the [[Internet]], and [[word of mouth]], including academic discourse in many fields renowned for their use of distinctive [[jargon]], and often become accepted parts of the language. Other times, however, they disappear from common use just as readily as they appeared. Whether a neologism continues as part of the language depends on many factors, probably the most important of which is acceptance by the public. It is unusual, however, for a word to enter common use if it does not resemble another word or words in an identifiable way.

When a word or phrase is no longer "new", it is no longer a neologism. Neologisms may take decades to become "old", however. Opinions differ on exactly how old a word must be to cease being considered a neologism.

==Sources==
Popular examples of neologism can be found in science, fiction, branding, literature, linguistic and popular culture. Examples include ''[[laser]]'' (1960) from '''L'''ight '''A'''mplification by '''S'''timulated '''E'''mission of '''R'''adiation, ''[[robotics]]'' (1941), ''[[agitprop]]'' (1930).

==History and meaning==
The term ''neologism'' is first attested in English in 1772, borrowed from French ''néologisme'' (1734).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neologism|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00322941|publisher=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|format=draft revision|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A proponent of a new word or doctrine may be called a neologist.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Neologists might{{vague|date=September 2017}} study cultural and ethnic vernacular.

The term ''neologism'' has a broader meaning that includes not only "an entirely new lexical item" but also an existing word whose meaning has been altered.&lt;ref name="palgrave"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zuckermann|first1=Ghilʻad|title=Language contact and lexical enrichment in Israeli Hebrew|date=2003|url=http://www.palgrave.com/br/book/9781403917232|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1403917232|page=3|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sally Barr Ebest ''Writing from A to Z: the easy-to-use reference handbook'' 1999– p. 449  "A neologism is a newly coined word or phrase or a new usage of an existing word or phrase."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lynne Bowker, Jennifer Pearson ''Working With Specialized Language'' 2002 p. 214 "Neologisms can also be formed in another way, however, by assigning a new meaning to an existing word."&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, the latter process is called ''semantic shifting'',&lt;ref name="palgrave"/&gt; or ''semantic extension''.&lt;ref&gt;Ole Nedergaard Thomsen ''Competing models of linguistic change: evolution and beyond'' 2006 – p. 68 "Extensions, by contrast, are applications of extant means in new usage. Note that since individual speakers differ in their command of their shared tradition of speaking, one person's Extension may be experienced by another as a Neologism"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Picone ''Anglicisms, Neologisms and Dynamic French'' 1996 – p. 3 "Proceeding now to the task of defining terms, I will begin with the more general term 'neologism'. ...A neologism is any new word, morpheme or locution and any new meaning for a pre-existent word, morpheme or locution that appears in a language. ... Likewise, any semantic extension of a pre-existent word, morpheme or locution.. but is also, by accepted definition, a neologism."&lt;/ref&gt; Neologisms are distinct from a person's ''[[idiolect]]'', one's unique patterns of vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation.

Neologisms are usually introduced when an individual or individuals find that a specific notion is lacking a term in a language, or when the existing vocabulary is insufficiently detailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mesthrie|first1=Rajend|title=Language and Social History: Studies in South African Sociolinguistics|date=1995|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law, governmental bodies, and technology have a relatively high frequency of acquiring neologisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Solan|first1=Lawrence|title=The Oxford Handbook of Language and Law|date=2012|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greiffenstern|first1=Sandra|title=The Influence of Computers, the Internet and Computer-Mediated Communication on Everyday English|date=2010|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another trigger that motivates neologists and protologists to coin a neologism is in order to disambiguate a previously existing term that may have been obscure or vague due to having multiple senses.&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, Robert. "Shadow of a Doubt: A Phantom Caesura in Horace Odes 4.14." Classical Journal, The 109.4 (2014): 407-417.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2013}}
Neologisms may come from a word used in the narrative of a book. Examples include "[[grok]]" from ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'' by [[Robert A. Heinlein]]; "[[McJob]]" from ''[[Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture]]'' by [[Douglas Coupland]]; "[[cyberspace]]" from ''[[Neuromancer]]'' by [[William Gibson]]&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, Robin. 2003: "The Generative Edge." Foundation 87 (2003): 73–93.&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Quark#Etymology|quark]]" from [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''.

The title of a book may become a neologism, for instance, ''[[Catch-22]]'' (from the title of [[Joseph Heller]]'s novel). Alternatively, the author's name may give rise to the neologism, although the term is sometimes based on only one work of that author. This includes such words as "[[Orwellian]]" (from [[George Orwell]], referring to his novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'') and "Kafkaesque" (from [[Franz Kafka]]).

Names of famous characters are another source of literary neologisms, e.g. ''[[quixotism|quixotic]]'' (referring to the [[Don Quixote|title character]] in ''[[Don Quixote de la Mancha]]'' by [[Cervantes]]), ''[[Ebenezer Scrooge|scrooge]]'' (from the main character in [[Dickens]]'s ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'') and ''[[pollyanna]]'' (from [[Eleanor H. Porter]]'s book of the same name).

== Popular culture ==
Culture and technology use are major drivers in neologism development.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, L. J. (2005). The meaning of e- : neologisms as markers of culture and technology /.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Forgue, Guy (1979). "American Neologisms as a Reflection of Cultural Change since 1945". ''Proceedings of a Symposium on American Literature'': 199–211.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of recent pop-culture neologisms include Canadian "[[Snowmageddon]]", Russian "[[Monstration]]".

In these instances, words are used in small communities then spread through the use of social media. "Doggo-Lingo" specifically has spread primarily through [[Facebook]] group and [[Twitter]] account use.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Boddy, Jessica (April 23, 2017). [https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2017/04/23/524514526/dogs-are-doggos-an-internet-language-built-around-love-for-the-puppers "Dogs Are Doggos: An Internet Language Built Around Love For The Puppers"]. ''National Public Radio''.&lt;/ref&gt; The suspected origin of this way of referring to dogs stems from a Facebook group created in 2008 and gaining popularity in 2014 in Australia. The Facebook group called DogSpotting posts pictures of dogs that members have seen with amusing captions, often using Doggo-Lingo. In Australian English it is common to use [[Diminutives in Australian English|diminutives]], often ending in –o, which could be where doggo-lingo was first used.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The term has grown so that [[Merriam-Webster]] has acknowledged its use but notes the term needs to be found in published, edited work for a longer period of time before it can be deemed a new word making it the perfect example of a neologism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The use and over-use of brand names is another example of neologism creation. The terms "coke" or "[[cola]]" may be used in reference to any [[Coca-Cola]] like beverage regardless of brand. [[Kleenex]] is used in reference to any facial tissue. [[Xerox]] or xerox-ing is used in reference to any [[photocopier]] or action of photocopying.&lt;ref&gt;Sayadi, Forough (April 2011). [http://translationjournal.net/journal/56neologisms.htm "The Translation of Neologisms"]. ''Translation Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neologisms can also originate entirely online from [[social media]] and other forms of [[Mass media|Internet media]].

== Translations ==
Because neologisms originate in one language, translations between languages can be difficult.

In the scientific community, where English is the predominant language for published research and studies, like-sounding translations (referred to as 'naturalization') are sometimes used.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Linder | first1 = Daniel | year = 2016 | title = Non-native scientists, research dissemination and English neologisms: What happens in the early stages of reception and re-production? | url = | journal = Iberica | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 35–58 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the English word is used along with a brief explanation of meaning.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
The four translation methods are emphasized in order to translate neologisms: transliteration and transcription, the use of analogues, calque and loan translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://termcoord.eu/2015/06/the-translation-of-english-neologisms/|title = The Translation of English Neologisms|website = Terminology Coordination Unit [DGTRAD] |publisher = European Parliament|date = 22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When translating from English to other languages, the naturalization method is most often used.&lt;ref&gt;Lindblad, Jonathan. 2017. "Translation strategies of H.P. Lovecraft’s neologisms into Japanese." ''Networked Digital Library of Theses &amp; Dissertations''&lt;/ref&gt; The most common way that professional translators translate neologisms is through the [[Think aloud protocol]] (TAP), wherein translators find the most appropriate and natural sounding new word through speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moghadas | first1 = Seyed | year = 2014 | title = A Model for Cognitive Process of Neologisms Translation | url = | journal = International Journal of English Language and Translation Studies | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 4–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This way, translators are able to use potential translated neologisms in sentences and test them with different structures and syntax. Correct translations from [[English for specific purposes]] into other languages is crucial in various industries and legal systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liu | first1 = Hui | year = 2014 | title = A Probe Into Translation Strategies of Tech English Neologism in Petroleum Engineering Field | url = | journal = Studies in Literature and Language | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 33–37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kerremans | first1 = Koen | year = 2014 | title = Studying the Dynamics of Understanding and Legal Neologisms within a Linguistically Diverse Judicial Space: The Case of Motherhood in Belgium | url = | journal = International Conference; Meaning in Translation: Illusion of Precision''. | volume = 231 | issue = | pages = 46–52 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inaccurate translations can lead to 'translation asymmetry' or conceptual misunderstandings which can lead to miscommunication.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many technical glossaries of English translations exist to combat this issue in the medical, judicial, and technological fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Navarro | first1 = F | year = 2008 | title = Controversies in dermatology: One-Hundred Fifty English Words and Expressions in Dermatology That Present Difficulties or Pitfalls for Translation Into Spanish | url = | journal = Actas dermosifiliográficas (English Edition) | volume = 99 | issue = 5| pages = 349–362 | doi=10.1016/s1578-2190(08)70268-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other uses ==
In [[psychiatry]] and [[neuroscience]], the term ''neologism'' is used to describe words that have meaning only to the person who uses them, independent of their common meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2009|title=Neologisms|url=|journal=History of Psychiatry|volume=20|issue=4|pages=480–496|last1=Berrios|first1=G. E.|doi=10.1177/0957154x08348532}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of neologisms may also be due to [[aphasia]] acquired after [[brain damage]] resulting from a [[stroke]] or [[Traumatic brain injury|head injury]].&lt;ref&gt;B Butterworth, Hesitation and the production of verbal paraphasias and neologisms in jargon aphasia. Brain Lang, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[theology]], a neologism refers to a relatively new doctrine (for example, [[Transcendentalism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n9VDCgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=theology+neologism&amp;q=neologism#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Constructing Local Theologies|date=15 September 2015|publisher=Orbis Books|isbn=9781608336111|edition=30th Anniversary|language=en|chapter=1|last1=Schreiter|first1=Robert J.|accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="861">'''Paroemion''' is the repetition of usually initial consonant sounds in two or more neighboring words or syllables (as wild and woolly, threatening throngs). It is also called head rhyme or initial rhyme. It is also [[alliteration]] taken to an extreme where nearly every word in a sentence begins with the same consonant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odlt.org/ballast/paroemion.html |title=ODLT |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rowlandrhetoric.wikispaces.com/Paroemion|title=RowlandRhetoric - Paroemion|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An example of paroemion is:

{{quote|The delicious doughnut drew delicate designs, drizzling delectable damson drops down Dave's duck-down vest. "Darn!" Dave declared dragging his dripping dukes across the dreadfully delightful disaster.}}

'''Peng'im''' ({{zh|潮州话拼音方案}}: Diê⁵ziu¹uê⁷ Pêng¹im¹ huang¹uan³([[Chaozhou|Teochew]]) Dio⁷ziu¹uê⁷ Pêng¹im¹ huang¹uan³([[Shantou|Swatow]])) is a [[Teochew dialect]] [[romanisation]] system as a part of [[Guangdong romanization|Guangdong Romanisation]] published by Guangdong Provincial Education Department in 1960. Tone of this system is based on [[Swatow dialect]]. The system uses [[Latin alphabet]] to transcript pronunciation and numbers to note tones. Since Teochew has high phonetic similarity with [[Hokkien]], another [[Southern Min]] variety, [[Pe̍h-ōe-jī]] can also be used to transcribe Teochew. The name "Peng'im" is a transcription of "拼音" using this system.

==Contents==

===Alphabet===
This system uses the [[Latin alphabet]], but does not include f, j, q, v, w, x, y. ê is letter e with [[circumflex]].

===Initials===
There are 18 [[initials]]. [[Syllables]] not starting with consonants are called [[zero initials]].

      <comment>/* Gender */ ADDED: and does not have phi-feature agreement for gender. Many other languages of the world do have gendered nouns. German, for example, has three genders; feminine, masculine and neuter.</comment>

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7905">In [[linguistics]], especially within [[generative grammar]], '''phi features''' (denoted with the Greek letter [[Phi|φ]] 'phi') are the semantic features of [[Grammatical person|person]], [[Grammatical number|number]],  [[Grammatical gender|gender]], and [[Grammatical case|case]], as encoded in pronominal agreement with [[nouns]] and [[pronouns]] (the latter are said to consist only of phi-features, containing no lexical head). Several other features are included in the set of phi-features, such as the categorical features ±N (nominal) and ±V (verbal), which can be used to describe [[lexical category|lexical categories]] and case features.&lt;ref name="Kerstens, Johan"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=cJagGHOlKDUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1 The syntax of number, person, and gender: a theory of phi-features], Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co., 1993, p.2"&lt;/ref&gt;

Phi-features are often thought of as the "silent" features that exist on lexical heads (or, according to some theories&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/885337994|title=The universal structure of categories : towards a formal typology|last=Martina,|first=Wiltschko,|isbn=9781316004159|location=Cambridge|oclc=885337994}}&lt;/ref&gt;, within the syntactic structure) that are understood for number, gender, person or reflexivity. Due to their silent nature, phi-features are often only understood if someone is a native speaker of a language, or if the translation includes a gloss of all these features. Many languages exhibit a [[Pro-drop language|pro-drop]] phenomenon which means that they rely on other lexical categories to determine the phi-features of the lexical heads.

== Predicate-Argument Agreement ==
[[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/309976|title=Aspects of the theory of syntax|last=Noam.|first=Chomsky,|date=1965|publisher=M.I.T. Press|isbn=0262530074|location=Cambridge|oclc=309976}}&lt;/ref&gt; first proposed that the N node in a clause carries with it all the features to include person, number and gender. In [[English language|English]], we rely on nouns to determine the phi-features of a word, but other languages rely on inflections of the different parts of speech to determine person, number and gender of the nominal phrases to which they refer. Mainly '''verbs''' and '''adjectives''' are responsible for bearing inflections which signal the phi-features of a particular subject or object. Verbs appear to be responsible for carrying the most features and tend to carry person, number and gender agreements cross-linguistically for both subjects and objects&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511619830|title=The Syntax of Agreement and Concord|last=Baker|first=Mark C.|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511619830|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Adjectives also carry phi-features in some languages, they tend to agree in number and gender but rarely for person &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511619830|title=The Syntax of Agreement and Concord|last=Baker|first=Mark C.|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511619830|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Person ===
In English, person agreement is understood in the pronoun or noun overtly, while the verb carries the agreement marker to agree with the person phi-features on the Noun. For English, there is only one verb agreement required for the third person singular in the present tense (usually -s), as seen in the table '''Person Agreement for WALK: English'''. 
{| class="wikitable"
|+Agreement for WALK: English
!PERSON
!singular
!plural
|-
|'''1st'''
|I walk
|We walk
|-
|'''2nd'''
|You walk
|You (all) walk
|-
|'''3rd'''
|He/she/it '''''walks'''''
|They walk
|}
In a null-subject language such as [[Italian language|Italian]], however, subjects are not required (in fact, in many null subject languages, producing overt subjects is a sign of non-nativity). Therefore, Italian uses a different inflectional morphology for each pronominal that is based not the person features of the nominal subject it agrees with:

&lt;u&gt;- Camminare (''to walk''):&lt;/u&gt;
cammin'''o''' (''I walk)'', cammin'''iamo''' (''we walk'')

camm'''ini''' (''you walk''), cammin'''ate''' (''you all walk'')

cammi'''na''' (''he/she walks''), camm'''inano''' (''they walk'')
=== Number ===
In English, number agreement is not inflected on Verbs like they are in other languages. This is partly because English is a language that requires subjects and the subjects in English overtly express number. In English, number is a phi-feature that is understood on the noun. In terms of inflectional morphology, the most common in English is ''-s'' inflected on nouns that are plural:

- Duck'''s''', fridge'''s''', baseball'''s''', cup'''s''', book'''s''', mirror'''s''', car'''s''', building'''s''', clown'''s''', bridge'''s''', cream'''s'''....

Some cases of plurality in English require conjugation of the entire noun to express the phi-feature of plurality:

- M'''en''', wom'''en''', m'''ice''', t'''eeth'''....

Neither verbs nor adjectives are used to agree with the phi-features of the noun that they are agreeing with in English.
[[File:Feminine and Masculine inflections (singular) in Italian.png|alt=|thumb|419x419px|Bolded words are the inflected forms for gender in Italian.]]

=== Gender ===
English is a language that does not have gendered nominal phrases and pronouns (except in the case of proper names of nouns that are sentient beings who belong to a certain gender category) and does not have phi-feature agreement for gender. Many other languages of the world do have gendered nouns. [[German language|German]], for example, has three genders; feminine, masculine and neuter. Italian has two: feminine and masculine phi-features. For Italian, inflections on the '''adjectives''' and '''determiners''' are used for gender agreement within the pronominal phrase.

=== Case ===
Reflexivity is overt in English for every person:

my'''''self'',''' your'''''self'',''' him'''''self''''', your'''''selves''''', our'''''selves''''', them'''''selves'''''

In many languages, reflexivity is not overt for person. A prime example is apparent in [[French language|French]] ''se''. French ''se'' is used to express reflexivity for every expression of the third person. For this reason, some theories&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Déchaine|first=Rose-Marie|last2=Wiltschko|first2=Martina|date=2017-03-23|title=A Formal Typology of Reflexives|url=https://doi-org.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/10.1111/stul.12072|journal=Studia Linguistica|language=en|volume=71|issue=1-2|pages=60–106|doi=10.1111/stul.12072|issn=0039-3193}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that reflexive phi-features for languages such as French posit in a level on the syntactic structure that is silent, between the determiner and the noun.

X'-theory approaches categorical features in this way: when a head X selects its' complement to project to X', the XP that it projects to then is a combination of the head X and all of its' categorical features&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=1c4gAAAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=categorical+features+syntax&amp;ots=qYelHsihQL&amp;sig=VE_cP6B_sgmIe9tTy8W7tYg7r1o#v=onepage&amp;q=categorical%20features%20syntax&amp;f=false|title=The Syntax of Number, Person and Gender: A Theory of Phi-Features|last=Kerstens|first=Johan|date=2012-06-25|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9783110869361|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, those being either nominal, verbal, adjectival or prepositional features.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5293">A '''philosophical language''' is any [[constructed language]] that is constructed from [[first principles]], like a [[Engineered language|logical language]], but may entail a strong claim of absolute perfection or transcendent or even mystical truth rather than satisfaction of pragmatic goals. Philosophical languages were popular in [[Early Modern]] times, partly motivated by the goal of recovering the lost [[Adamic language|Adamic]] or [[Divine language]].  The term '''ideal language''' is sometimes used near-synonymously, though more modern philosophical languages such as [[Toki Pona]] are less likely to involve such an exalted claim of perfection. It may be known as a language of pure ideology. The axioms and grammars of the languages together differ from commonly spoken languages today. 

In most older philosophical languages, and some newer ones, words are constructed from a limited set of [[morphemes]] that are treated as "elemental" or fundamental. "Philosophical language" is sometimes used synonymously with "taxonomic language", though more recently there have been several [[conlang]]s constructed on philosophical principles which are not taxonomic.  Vocabularies of [[oligosynthetic language]]s are made of [[compound word]]s, which are coined from a small (theoretically minimal) set of [[morpheme]]s; oligoisolating languages, such as Toki Pona, similarly use a limited set of root words but produce phrases which remain series of distinct words. 

[[Toki Pona]] is based on [[minimalism|minimalistic]] [[voluntary simplicity|simplicity]], incorporating elements of [[Taoism]]. [[Láadan]] is designed to lexicalize and grammaticalize the concepts and distinctions important to women, based on [[muted group theory]].  

A priori languages are constructed languages where the vocabulary is invented directly, rather than being derived from other existing languages (as with [[Esperanto]] or [[Ido (language)|Ido]]).  Philosophical languages are almost all [[a priori (languages)|a priori languages]], but most ''a priori'' languages are not philosophical languages.  For example, [[Quenya]], [[Sindarin]], and [[Klingon language|Klingon]] are all ''a priori'' but not philosophical languages: they are meant to seem like natural languages, even though they have no genetic relation to any natural languages.

==History==
Work on philosophical languages was pioneered by [[Francis Lodwick]] (''A Common Writing'', 1647; ''The Groundwork or Foundation laid (or So Intended) for the Framing of a New Perfect Language and a Universal Common Writing'', 1652), Sir [[Thomas Urquhart]] (''[[Logopandecteision]]'', 1652), [[George Dalgarno]] (''Ars signorum'', 1661), and [[John Wilkins]] (''[[An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language|An Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language]]'', 1668).  Those were systems of hierarchical classification that were intended to result in both spoken and written expression. In 1855, English writer [[George Edmonds (lawyer)|George Edmonds]] modified Wilkins' system, leaving its taxonomy intact, but changing the grammar, orthography and pronunciation of the language in an effort to make it easier to speak and to read.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, George. ''A Universal Alphabet, Grammar, and Language''.  [[Richard Griffin and Company]], London and Glasgow, 1855.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gottfried Leibniz]] created ''[[lingua generalis]]'' (or ''lingua universalis'') in 1678, aiming to create a lexicon of characters upon which the user might perform calculations that would yield true propositions automatically; as a side effect he developed [[binary calculus]].&lt;ref name="lingua"&gt;[http://history-computer.com/Dreamers/Leibniz.html history-computer.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

These projects aimed not only to reduce or model grammar, but also to arrange all human knowledge into "characters" or hierarchies.  This idea ultimately led to the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', in the [[Age of Enlightenment]].  Leibniz and the encyclopedists realized that it is impossible to organize human knowledge unequivocally as a tree, and so impossible to construct an ''a priori'' language based on such a classification of concepts.  Under the entry ''Charactère'', [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|D'Alembert]] critically reviewed the projects of philosophical languages of the preceding century.  

After the ''Encyclopédie'', projects for ''a priori'' languages moved more and more to the fringe.  Individual authors, typically unaware of the history of the idea, continued to propose taxonomic philosophical languages until the early 20th century (for example, [[Ro (language)|Ro]]).  More recent philosophical languages have usually moved away from taxonomic schemata, such as 21st century [[Ithkuil]] by [[John Quijada]].

In [[linguistics]], a '''register complex''' is a combination of phonation type, [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], length, [[vowel]] quality and/or other variants that function dependently as distinguishing features within a single phonological system. In languages employing register systems, differences in a distinguishing feature correlate relative to the quality of another distinguishing feature.

For instance, in a system where [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], voice quality and [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] timing were distinguishing features, the meaning of a vowel-consonant cluster like "Pai" (as in the [[English language|English]] word "Pie") may depend on whether the cluster is voiced in a high, medium or low pitch relative to the clearness, breathiness and glotteral quality of speech, as well as relative to the duration of the cluster relative to other neighboring clusters. Thus, "Pai" voiced in a high tone with a breathy quality and unstressed along with other unstressed clusters would connote a different meaning if any of the three features changed relative to other features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.csuchico.edu/~gt18/Papers/Vietnamese_tonogenesis.pdf |title=Vietnamese and tonogenesis: revising the model and the analysis |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many register languages are [[tone (linguistics)|tonal]]. However, tone is not a universal distinguishing feature among register systems and register complexes are not a component of most tonal languages. In fact, tonal languages can employ either a register tone systems or a contour tone systems. Mandarin has a contour tone system, where the distinguishing feature of the tones are their shifts in pitch (their pitch shapes or contours, such as rising, falling, dipping, or peaking) rather than simply their pitch relative to each other as in a register tone system. Register tone systems are found in [[Bantu languages]] and throughout [[Africa]]. In some register tone systems, there is a default tone, usually low in a two-tone system or mid in a three-tone system, that is more common and less salient than other tones. There are also languages that combine register and contour tones, such as the [[Kru languages]], though in such cases the register tones may be analysed as being 'level' (unvarying pitch) contour tones. Furthermore, often the term 'register,' when not in the phrase 'register tone,' is used to indicate vowel phonation combined with tone in a single phonological system. [[Burmese language|Burmese]], [[Khmer language|Khmer]] and possibly [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] are register languages. Burmese is usually considered a tonal language and Khmer a vowel-phonation language, but in both cases differences in relative pitch or pitch contours are correlated with vowel phonation, so that neither exists independently.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11961">The '''Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf, Inc''' (RID) is a [[non-profit organization]], founded in 1964 and incorporated in 1972, that seeks to uphold standards, ethics, and professionalism for [[American Sign Language]] [[Language interpretation|interpreters]]. RID is the only organization in the United States that credentials both d/Deaf and Hearing interpreters to provide services in a wide range of settings, as well as test and certify interpreters for legal work. The RID Board is committed to the "4 R's" which are: Roots, Respect, Relevance and Results. As of 2014 there were over 15,000 members and 58 affiliate chapters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RID - 2014 Annual Report |url=http://www.rid.org/2014-annual-report/#mem-svcs|publisher=Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since August 2004, RID has been building stronger ties with the [[National Association of the Deaf (United States)|National Association of the Deaf]] (NAD), including a joint Code of Professional Ethics and the merging of their respective certification programs. They jointly developed the National Interpreter Certification test (NIC), which was adopted in 2005.

RID is headquartered in Alexandria, Virginia, with a roughly $3,000,000 annual budget and around 20 employees. The association's operations are led by an executive director (currently vacant) and governed by an eleven-member board of directors. 

== Governance and Operations ==
RID is governed by an eleven-member board of directors elected directly by the voting membership for a two-year term. Voting rights are determined by being a member in good standing of both RID (in the certified or associate category) and a sanctioned affiliate chapter. The board is made up of the following positions: 
* President
* Vice President
* Secretary
* Treasurer
* Member-at-Large
* Deaf Member-at-Large
* Region I Representative
* Region II Representative
* Region III Representative
* Region IV Representative
* Region V Representative
Following the expiration of the president's term, they serve an ex officio non-voting term on the board of directors as Immediate Past President. 

The Executive Board consists of the President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, Member-at-Large, and Deaf Member-at-Large, and is elected on odd years for two-year terms. The regional representative positions are elected on even years for two-year terms. 

To run for election to the Executive Board, members must collect 25 nomination signatures from voting members with at least one from each region of RID. Regional representative candidates must collect 25 nomination signatures from within their region. All positions except the Member-at Large require the candidate to be certified member of RID for four consecutive years prior to candidacy. Member-at-Large requires either associate or certified membership in RID for four consecutive years prior to candidacy. Additionally, regional representative candidates must have resided in their region at least two years prior to candidacy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3DKvZMflFLda1BVN2EyX25FdTA/view|title=RID Bylaws|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. If there are more than one candidates, an election is held via on-line balloting. p

The 2007–2018 board of directors are as follows:

RID operations are conducted by a paid staff led by an Executive Director. Since 2014, RID has not had a permanent Executive Director following the departure of Shane Feldman. The board contracted with Anna Witter-Merithew who served as Interim Executive Director until August 2017. Since that time, the board has served as Executive Director through President Melvin Walker while continuing a permanent Executive Director search.

== Code of Professional Conduct ==

As part of their push to improve the ethical behavior of practitioners in the field, RID revised and updated existing guidelines from the Code of Ethics.&lt;ref name=Code&gt;{{cite web|title=NAD-RID Code of Professional Conduct|url=http://www.rid.org/UserFiles/File/NAD_RID_ETHICS.pdf|publisher=Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf|accessdate=4 June 2013|year=2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930211448/http://www.rid.org/UserFiles/File/NAD_RID_ETHICS.pdf|archivedate=30 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the Code of Professional Conduct was adopted as the newest set of principles interpreters should adhere to. Certified interpreters have an especially strong duty to follow the principles laid out by RID, for the integrity of the work, the well being of the stakeholders, and to avoid causing harm.

The tenets from the current Code of Professional Conduct are:

# Interpreters adhere to standards of confidential communication.
# Interpreters possess the professional skills and knowledge required for the specific interpreting situation.
# Interpreters conduct themselves in a manner appropriate to the specific interpreting situation.
# Interpreters demonstrate respect for consumers.
# Interpreters demonstrate respect for colleagues, interns, and students of the profession.
# Interpreters maintain ethical business practices.
# Interpreters engage in professional development.

== RID certifications ==

RID has a national certification system with three key components:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About RID Overview|url=http://rid.org/aboutRID/overview/index.cfm|publisher=Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf|accessdate=4 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601064321/http://rid.org/aboutRID/overview/index.cfm|archivedate=1 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

* The National Testing System (NTS)
* The Certification Maintenance Program (CMP) - assures the continual skill development of certified interpreters.
* The Ethical Practices System (EPS) - gives consumers the ability to express concerns or make complaints about the quality of interpreting/transliterating services.

In previous incarnations of the NTS, the following certifications were given to interpreters meeting the testing criteria (All credentials awarded by the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf will remain valid as long as the holder of said certification(s) maintains their membership and maintenance program.):

Previously offered certificates:

* CSC - Comprehensive Skills Certificate (1972–1988)
* MCSC - Master Comprehensive Skills Certificate (1972–1988)
* RSC - Reverse Skills Certificate - awarded only to Deaf / hard-of-hearing interpreters/transliterators (1972–1988)
* OIC:C - Oral Interpreting Certificate, Comprehensive (1979–1985)
* OIC: S/V - Oral Interpreting Certificate, Spoken to Visible (1979–1985)
* OIC: V/S - Oral Interpreting Certificate, Visible to Spoken (1979–1985)
* IC - Interpretation Certificate (1972–1988)
* TC - Transliteration Certificate (1972–1988)
* IC/TC - Interpretation and Transliteration Certificates (1972–1988)
* SC: L - Specialist Certificate: Legal (first certificate version of this certification was offered 1975–1978)
* SC: PA - Specialist Certificate: Performing Arts (1971–1988)
* OIC: C - Oral Interpreting Certificate (1979–1983)
* CI - Certificate of Interpretation (1988–2005)
* CT - Certificate of Transliteration (1988–2005)
* NIC Advanced and NIC Master (These levels were offered from 2005 to 2011) 

Currently offered certificates:

* CDI - Certified Deaf Interpreter (On moratorium since August, 2015)
* OTC - Oral Transliteration Certificate (On moratorium since August, 2015)
* SC: L - Specialist Certificate: Legal (On moratorium since August, 2015)
* NIC- National Interpreter Certification 

RID granted certified membership to holders of the defunct NAD certification at levels III, IV and V as well as those who pass the Educational Interpreter Performance Assessment (EIPA) at proficiency level 4.0 with a passing score on the EIPA written exam. The certifications for these members are listed as:
* NAD III
* NAD IV
* NAD V
* ED:K12
No new certified member status is being granted for any of these categories. 

As of July 2005, a new certification test, developed with the NAD, was implemented and the CI and CT tests began to be phased out. The new generalist certification for hearing interpreters is the NAD-RID National Interpreter Certification (NIC). In 2015 NAD decided to withdraw its involvement from the NIC resulting its name being removed from the test. 

== CASLI ==
RID formed a [[limited liability company]] called the Center for Assessment of Sign Language Interpretation (CASLI) in 2015 to carry out all testing functions. CASLI is a wholly owned subsidiary, supported operationally by RID headquarters staff and governed by a Managing Board that reports to the RID Board of Directors. As of 2017, the Board of Managers consisted of: 
{| class="wikitable"

|-
|Vice President
|Keith Cagle
|-
|Vice President
|Patrick Boudreault
|-

|Anthony Aramburo
|-
|Treasurer
|Lyle Vold
|}
In 2017, CASLI's operations began direct supervision by Star Grieser, CDI who reports to the RID Deputy Director. 

CASLI's formation began a clearer philosophical and practical split of certification from professional testing. Under this new scheme, CASLI is granted greater autonomy to design, prepare and conduct generalist testing for both Deaf and hearing interpreters. RID retains the function of certifying interpreters based on their testing results and other certification criteria. As such, the EPS and CMP systems remain under RID's direct control.

[[Image:Rosagasario es de Centragasal.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A soccer-related example of ''rosarigasino'' in a graffiti.]]

'''Rosarigasino''' (also known as '''Gasó''') is a [[language game]] (in the form of a [[rhyme|rhyming]] [[slang]]) traditionally associated with the city of [[Rosario]], {{Province|Santa Fe|Argentina}}, even though very few people, if any, currently employ it.

It is similar to the much more common game of ''[[jeringonza]]''. The exact origins of this language remain uncertain, but scholars and historians agree that it was created in early 20th century by local prisoners to communicate with each other without being understood by guards.

''Rosarigasino'' functions by adding two [[syllable]]s to each word by inserting the sequence ''-gas-'' immediately after the [[stress (linguistics)|stress]]ed vowel and then repeating that vowel, followed by the rest of the word. The term ''rosarigasino'' itself is formed in this way, after the local residents' [[demonym]] (''rosarino''). Other examples (with the added sounds in '''bold'''):

:''colectivo'' ("bus") &amp;rarr; ''colecti'''gasi'''vo''
:''[[National Flag Memorial (Argentina)|Monumento a la Bandera]]'' ("Flag Memorial") &amp;rarr; ''Monume'''gase'''nto a la Bande'''gase'''ra''
:''peatonal'' ("pedestrian street") &amp;rarr; ''peatona'''gasa'''l''
:''[[Córdoba Street (Rosario)|Calle Córdoba]]'' ("Córdoba St.") &amp;rarr; ''Ca'''gasa'''lle Co'''gasó'''rdoba''

In the city of Rosario there is a sort of ''Academia'' or ''Association of Gasó''. Besides, in some places it is possible to purchase manuals or learning books. In 2005, a complete rosarigasino version of [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes']] novel [[Don Quixote de la Mancha]] was published, entitled ''Don Quijogasote de la Magasancha'' and translated by [[Chiquito Reyes|Bernardo "Chiquito" Reyes]].

[[File:Scream and shout.jpg|thumb|200px|An angry boy screaming.]]
A '''scream''', '''shout''', '''yell''', '''shriek''', '''hoot''', '''holler''', '''vociferation''', '''outcry''', '''bellow''', or '''raising one's voice''', is a loud [[speech production|vocalization]] in which air is passed through the [[vocal folds]] with greater force than is used in regular or close-distance vocalisation. This can be performed by any creature possessing lungs, including humans. There are slight differences in meaning among them; for example, "scream" and "shriek" generally refer to a higher-pitched, sharp sound, used by some birds and other animals, and a "hoot", such as emitted by an owl, usually does not involve words.

A scream is often an [[instinct]]ive or [[reflex]] action, with a strong [[emotion]]al aspect, like [[fear]], [[pain]], [[Surprise (emotion)|surprise]], [[joy]], [[anger]], etc.

==Troponyms==
A large number of words exist to describe the act of making loud vocalizations, whether intentionally or in response to stimuli, and with specific nuances. For example, an early twentieth century synonym guide places variations under the heading of "call", and includes as synonyms, bawl, bellow, clamor, cry (out), ejaculate, exclaim, roar, scream, shout, shriek, vociferate, and yell, each with its own implications.&lt;ref name="Fernald"&gt;James Champlin Fernald, "Call", ''English Synonyms and Antonyms: With Notes on the Correct Use of Prepositions" (1914), p. 136-37.&lt;/ref&gt; This source states:

{{quote|To ''call'' is to send out the voice in order to attract another's attention, either by word or by inarticulate utterance. Animals ''call'' their mates, or their young; a man ''calls'' his dog, his horse, etc. The sense is extended to include summons by bell, or any signal. To ''shout'' is to ''call'' or ''exclaim'' with the fullest volume of sustained voice; to ''scream'' is to utter a shriller cry; to ''shriek'' or to ''yell'' refers to that which is louder and wilder still. We ''shout'' words; in ''screaming'', ''shrieking'', or ''yelling'' there is often no attempt at articulation. To ''bawl'' is to utter senseless, noisy cries, as of a child in pain or anger. ''Bellow'' and ''roar'' are applied to the utterances of animals, and only contemptuously to those of persons. To ''clamor'' is to utter with noisy iteration; it applies also to the confused cries of a multitude. To ''vociferate'' is commonly applied to loud and excited speech where there is little besides the exertion of voice. In ''exclaiming'', the utterance may not be strikingly, though somewhat, above the ordinary tone and pitch; we may ''exclaim'' by mere interjections, or by connected words, but always by some articulate utterance. To ''ejaculate'' is to throw out brief, disconnected, but coherent utterances of joy, regret, and especially of appeal, petition, prayer; the use of such devotional utterances has received the special name of "ejaculatory prayer." To ''cry out'' is to give forth a louder and more excited utterance than in ''exclaiming'' or ''calling''; one often ''exclaims'' with sudden joy as well as sorrow; if he ''cries out'', it is oftener in grief or agony. In the most common colloquial usage, to ''cry'' is to express grief or pain by weeping or sobbing. One may ''exclaim'', ''cry out'', or ''ejaculate'' with no thought of others' presence; when he ''calls'', it is to attract another's attention.&lt;ref name="Fernald"/&gt;}}

Another source proposes different implications for some of these terms, stating that "the call is normally addressed to a specific person... and the shout projected to a distant but identifiable target, the holler is emitted to whomever may be within earshot".&lt;ref name="Shepherd"&gt;John Shepherd, "Holler/Hollering", ''Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World: Volume II: Performance and Production'' (2003), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Whooping is another name given to the same kind of noise making as hollering.&lt;ref name="Shepherd"/&gt; This source separately notes that a shout "may be angry or joyous; it may be directed to one person or many; and, sometimes, its purpose may be merely for the satisfaction of release or of hearing an echo".&lt;ref&gt;John Shepherd, "Shout/Shouter", ''Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World: Volume II: Performance and Production'' (2003), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

== As a phenomenon ==

=== In psychology ===
In psychology the scream is an important theme in the theories of [[Arthur Janov]]. In his book ''[[The Primal Scream]]'', Janov claims that the cure for neurosis is to confront the patient with his suppressed pain resulting from an experienced trauma. This confrontation gives birth to a scream. Janov believes that it is not necessary that it heals the patient from his trauma. The scream is only a form of expression of primal pain, which comes from one’s childhood, and the reliving of this pain and its expression. This finally appears through the scream and can cure the patient from his neurosis.

Janov describes the primal scream as very distinctive and unmistakable. It is a “strangely low, rattling and involuntary sound. […] Some people are moaning, groaning and are coiling themselves up. […] One screams as result of all the other times when it had to stay still, was making fun of, was humiliated or was beaten up”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Janov|first=Arthur|title=The Primal Scream|year=1970|location=New York|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Janov also says that the primal scream has series of reactions; “the patients that could not even say “piep” at home, suddenly feels powerful. The scream seems to be a liberating experience”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Janov|first=Arthur|title=The Primal Scream|year=1970|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Janov noticed this with all his patients. Women who seem to have baby-voices during the therapy are developing with their primal scream a very low voice.

=== As focus of power ===
[[Gregory Whitehead]], founder of the ''Institute for Screamscape Studies'', believes that the voice is used to focus the power: “scream used to be a psychological weapon both for you and against your opponent, it raises confidence to the person using it. Creating power with yell is having to affect someone without touching them”.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Whitehead quote from the Radio Play "Pressures of the unspeakable" Sydney, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; In this case screaming is a protective weapon, as also often used by animals, who scream as an expression of power or during fights with another animals.

=== Pleasure ===
Screaming and yelling are also a means of expressing pleasure. Studies on monkeys have shown that when female monkeys scream during sex, it helps the male ejaculate. An approximation of 86 percent of the times, where female monkeys screamed during sexual encounter, brought a 59 percent of success rate, in comparison to the 2 percent, without the female-scream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/7455-study-reveals-monkeys-shout-sex.html|title=Study Reveals Why Monkeys Shout During Sex|website=Livescience.com|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Gayle Brewer of the University of Central Lancashire and Colin Hendrie of the University of Leeds made a similar research with women, that shows that women also do scream often during intercourse as an encouragement for their partner to do "a better job".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-010-9632-1|title=Evidence to Suggest that Copulatory Vocalizations in Women Are Not a Reflexive Consequence of Orgasm|first1=Gayle|last1=Brewer|first2=Colin A.|last2=Hendrie|date=18 May 2010|journal=Arch Sex Behav|volume=40|pages=559–564|accessdate=6 June 2016|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1007/s10508-010-9632-1|issue=3|pmid=20480220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Birth ===
[[Gregory Whitehead]] defines the giving birth scream as a ''yes scream'',&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Whitehead quote from the Radio Play Pressures of the unspeakable" Sydney, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; because it expresses an opening into the world for a new human who begins life by screaming. Women describe this scream as unpremeditated and a reaction to the surprise of the baby’s head coming out. Some actually call this moment ''orgasmic pleasure''.

This moment is considered by most women to be very euphoric, that apparently some women are screaming of pain, pleasure and enthusiasm at the same time.

[[Ina May Gaskin]], one of the biggest promoters of the natural birth, is also encouraging women to make out with their man during birth as this helps their state of mind.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Reni Celeste, film philosopher and publisher, notes about [[Michel Chion]], composer, that he “locates the scream in the voice of the female and compares it to the female orgasm. The male, he explains, does not scream, he shouts. The shout marks territory, exercising will and structure. Tarzan shouts. The female scream reaches the infinite, it is a sound or cry at the brink of death. The male shout structures, the female scream opens a black hole to the limitless. The male director seeks to master the scream but he cannot-just as the female cannot herself master the scream. It exceeds control of both genders. In the scream speech reaches utter silence”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemonkeys.com/reni/silence.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 11, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014162724/http://www.cinemonkeys.com/reni/silence.html |archivedate=October 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First ===
[[Arthur Janov|Janov]] believes that for babies, screaming is the only form of communication he or she can have; it is the only way a baby can express his necessities, that he needs food, he is in pain or he simply needs some love. Janov writes, “screaming is a language – a primitive one, but a human language”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Janov|first=Arthur|title=The New Primal Scream; Primal Therapy 20 Years on|year=1991|location=Wilmington, DE|page=336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Communication and language ===
Diana König, journalist and broadcasting author, writes: “If the scream of babies is their first communication method, then the scream of adults is a recession from communication. By screaming, in the opposite of calling, the voice becomes overloaded and over-amplified, and it loses its control, its fundamental sound”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=König|first=Diana|title=Das Subjekt der Kunst: Schrei, Klange und Darstellung|year=2011|location=Bielefeld}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The scream is there before language and it appears where the language reaches its limits.

[[Elaine Scarry]], writer and literature professor, talks about language in connection to pain and she thinks that pain almost destroys the language because it brings people back into a state where sounds and screams are dominating as they were their means of communication before they learned how to speak. Pain cannot actually be communicated, as it is a personal experience and can only be experienced individually. Pain, as any other concept, is actually an individual experience that can only be communicated as an idea and it also is to be interpreted as. [[Hegel]] writes: “The biggest relief when having pain is to be able to scream it out […] through this expression, the pain becomes objective and this makes the connection between the subject, who is alone in pain, and the object, that is not in pain.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Michel|first=Karl Markus|title=Von Engeln, eulen und Sirenen|year=1988|location=Frankfurt am Main|page=380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnal and colleague &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2015.06.043 | volume=25 | title=Human Screams Occupy a Privileged Niche in the Communication Soundscape | journal=Current Biology | pages=2051–2056| pmc=4562283 }}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that human screams exploit a unique acoustic property, roughness, that selectively activates the auditory brain as well as the amygdala, a deep brain structure involved in danger processing.

{{details|The Scream}}
[[File:The Scream.jpg|thumb|upright|right|''[[The Scream]]'', [[Edvard Munch]] ]]
''[[The Scream]]'' ({{lang-no|Skrik}}) is the popular name given to each of four versions of a composition, created as both [[paintings]] and [[pastel]]s, by the [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] artist [[Edvard Munch]] between 1893 and 1910. ''Der Schrei der Natur'' (''The Scream of Nature'') is the title Munch gave to these works, all of which show a figure with an agonized expression against a landscape with a tumultuous orange sky.  [[Arthur Lubow]] has described ''The Scream'' as "an icon of modern art, a Mona Lisa for our time."&lt;ref name=Lubow&gt;Arthur Lubow, "[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/munch.html Edvard Munch: Beyond The Scream]", ''Smithsonian Magazine'', March 2006, (retrieved 29 March 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
{{details|Screaming (music)}}
In music there are long traditions of scream in rock, punk rock, heavy metal, rock and roll and emo music. Vocalists are developing various techniques of screaming that results in different ways of screaming. In rock and metal music singers are developing very demanding guttural and growled sounds.

Scream is also used predominant as an esthetic element in “cante jondo”, a vocal style in flamenco. The name of this style is translated as “deep sing”. The origins of flamenco and also of its name are still not clear. Flamenco is related to the gypsies’ music and it is said to have appeared in Andalusia in Spain. In cante jondo, that is a subdivision of flamenco, which is considered to be more serious and deep, the singer is reduced to the most rudimentary method of expression, which is the cry and the scream. Ricardo Molima, a Spanish poet, wrote "flamenco is the primal scream in its primitive form, from a people sunk in poverty and ignorance. Thus, the original flamenco song could be described as a type of self-therapy.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Molina|first=Ricardo|title=Misterios del Arte Flamenco|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David N. Green, musician, writer and composer, wrote in 1987 an essay about musicians using screams as a singing technique in music. He makes the distinction between harmonic scream that relates to the harmony of the music and has components of tonality, the true scream that is atonal, the lyrical scream that is related with the song’s lyrics and the pure scream that is not. The harmonic scream is the scream that is still very clear and has a defined pitch and that I actually relate to a fake scream, as it has no great disturbance, the lyrical scream that is related to words, most of the time swearing and the pure scream or the true scream, that in this case can also be called as the real scream or the primal scream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curiousgizmo.com/WORDS/Scream/SCREAM.htm|title=SCREAMS AND SCREAMERS IN ROCK AND ROLL|website=Curiousgizmo.com|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scream in music can also be seen in other ways than just a vocal action. Many musicians use scream as an inspirational source for their playing with instruments. This is usually represented in a loud hit on the instrument’s chords, in the case of the instruments that have chords, or a loud striking note, on the blowing instruments.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

=== Sound art ===
''Pressure of the unspeakable'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gregorywhitehead.net/2012/10/29/pressures-of-the-unspeakable/|title=Pressures of the Unspeakable|first=|last=GW|date=29 October 2012|website=Gregorywhitehead.net|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a radio feature work by [[Gregory Whitehead]]. Initiated in 1991 the project started with the founding of the ''Institute of the Screamscape studies'' where people were asked through radio and television to call on a hot line and scream. Whitehead notes: “In addition to framing the nervous system, the telephone-microphone-tape-recorder-radio circuitry also provided the key for the acoustic demarcation of pressure in the system: distortion, the disruption of digital codes, pure unmanageable noise. The scream as an eruption in excess of prescribed circuitries, as capable of “ blowing” communications technologies not designed for such extreme and unspeakable meanings”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiss|first=Allen S.|title=Phantasmic Radio|year=1995|location=Durham and London|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Whitehead gathered slowly an archive of screams that was edited and resulted in a theoretical narrative radio feature. 
Allen S. Weiss notes about his work that “the screamscape lies beyond any possible determination of authenticity”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiss|first=Allen S.|title=Phantasmic Radio|year=1995|location=Durham and London|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The people’s vociferations are just manifestations that through their anonymity create a sense of togetherness.

=== Theater ===
Actors are taught from the beginning of their careers how to scream correctly. They learn how to awaken that uncomfortable feeling in the listener without necessarily having to have any psychological attachment.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

=== Antonin Artaud ===
[[Antonin Artaud]]'s' last written work ''To have done with the judgment of god'' was Artaud's last written work that was recorded by him for the French radio in 1947. One day before it was scheduled, the director of the radio prohibited it for strong anti-religious and anti-American reasons. The piece consists of intensive texts with interludes of instrumental and vocal improvised sounds and screams.
Allen S. Weiss writes about [[Antonin Artaud]]’s scream: “the scream is the expulsion of an unbearable, impossible internal polarization between life’s forces and death’s negation, simultaneously signifying and simulation creation and destruction […] scream, as a nonmaterial double of excrement, may be both expression and expulsion, a sign of birth creation and frustration […] the scream is the desublimation of speech into the body, in opposition to the sublimation of body into meaningful speech”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiss|first=Allen S.|title=Phantasmic Radio|year=1995|location=Durham and London|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extreme character of the scream has a life danger element that stands for denying of death. In Artaud’s case, a person that was always very close to death and has been calling himself so ever since having strong shock therapies, the scream represents exactly this border between life and death, creation and destruction, of art work and of oneself.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Artaud’s screams are mostly related to words. The small interludes that are in between the texts parts sometimes contain screams.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

=== Performance art ===

[[Marina Abramovic]] used scream as an element in different performances: together with [[Ulay]] in ''AAA AAA'', the two are facing each other and are gradually screaming louder and louder while getting closer and closer to each other's face, until they both lose their voice; ''Freeing the voice'', where Abramovic is staying with her head upside down and screaming till she is left with no voice anymore.

=== Audio level ===
The volume levels of outcries may be very high, and this has become an issue in the sport of tennis, particularly with regards to [[Maria Sharapova]]'s loud [[tennis grunt]]s which have been measured as high as 101.2 decibels.&lt;ref name="grunt"&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/tennis/grunters-told-to-stop-the-racket/2007/12/18/1197740272449.html Tennis grunters told to stop the racket], Linda Pearce, Theage.com, retrieved December 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The loudest verified scream emitted by a human measured 129 dBA, a record set by teaching assistant Jill Drake in 2000.&lt;ref name="rec"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=340000|title=Classroom assistant pierces world record for loudest scream|date=6 September 2015|website=Tes.co.uk|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2354">'''Secondary reference''' points to the [[understanding|representation]] as a necessary part in granting a [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] to a (part of a) [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. In this approach, [[word]]s that don’t contribute to the representation are void; they can only provide a figurative expression. Examples of phrases which lack a secondary reference are 'a black Monday' (unless it is used figuratively) and [[Bernard Bolzano]]'s 'round [[quadrilateral|quadrangle]]'. [[Alexius Meinong]]'s Types of [[Object (philosophy)|objects]] can be mentioned here, too.

In the first case, one may have a representation of a Monday (or at least of something one calls a Monday), as well as of something black, but not of a 'black Monday', since these qualities don’t combine ('Monday' being too abstract to be combined with a concrete quality such as a color). In the second case, there is an incongruity: a quadrangle can be represented, but not a round one; conversely, there can be a circle, but it can’t be square. It may, therefore, be debated whether a representation is created here.

Another example is presented by [[George Berkeley]]. He says: "[...] Does it not require some pains and skill to form the general idea of a triangle (which is yet none of the most abstract, comprehensive and difficult) for it must be neither [[Oblique projection|oblique]] nor [[rectangle]], neither [[equilateral]], equicrural, nor scalenon, but ''all and none'' of these at once?" (''A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge'', Introduction, section 13.) Berkeley is here criticizing [[John Locke]], demonstrating that each representation is particular (i.e., individual).

Whether there is a meaning or not depends on the individual person: it is possible that a sentence has a meaning according to A, whereas B can’t discern any. This may, e.g., result from relevant knowledge which A possesses and B lacks, as in the case where one should decide the answer to the question 'Is 15 a prime number?' and A knows what a prime number is and B doesn’t; the sentence then doesn’t have a meaning for B.

'''Verbosity''' or '''verboseness''' is speech or writing that uses more words than necessary (for example, using "Despite the fact that" instead of "Although").&lt;ref name="communitycollege" /&gt; The opposite of verbosity is [[plain language]].
Some teachers, including the author of ''[[The Elements of Style]]'', warn writers not to be verbose. Similarly, some authors, including [[Mark Twain]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]], are known for their avoidance of verbosity. 

Synonyms for verbosity include '''wordiness''', '''verbiage''', '''prolixity''', '''grandiloquence''', '''garrulousness''', '''expatiation''', '''logorrhea''', and '''sesquipedalianism'''. 

Examples of verbosity are common in political speech, academic prose, and other genres.

==Etymology and synonyms==
The word ''verbosity'' comes from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''verbosus'', "wordy". There are many other English words that also refer to the use of excessive words.

''Prolixity'' comes from Latin ''prolixus'', "extended". ''Prolixity'' can also be used to refer to the length of a [[monologue]] or speech, especially a formal address such as a lawyer's [[oral argument]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Percy Anecdotes |last=Percy |first=Sholto |authorlink= Joseph Clinton Robertson |author2=Reuben Percy  |year=1826 |publisher=T. Boys |location=London |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SzJEAAAAIAAJ |page=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Grandiloquence'' is complex speech or writing judged to be pompous or bombastic [[diction]]. It is a combination of the Latin words ''grandis'' ("great") and ''loqui'' ("to speak").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/grandiloquence |title=Dictionary.com - Grandiloquence |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com|accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Logorrhea'' or ''logorrhoea'' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] λογόρροια, ''logorrhoia'', "[[word]]-[[flux]]") is an excessive flow of words. It is often used [[pejorative]]ly to describe prose that is hard to understand because it is needlessly complicated or uses excessive jargon. The term is also sometimes applied to unnecessarily wordy speech in general.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

''Sesquipedalianism'' is a linguistic style that involves the use of long words. Roman poet [[Horace]] coined the phrase ''sesquipedalia verba'' in his [[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0064%3Acard%3D73 |title=Ars Poetica, l.97 |publisher=[[Perseus Project]] |accessdate=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] of ''sesqui'', "one and a half", and ''pes'', "[[Foot (prosody)|foot]]", a reference to [[Meter (poetry)|meter]]. The earliest recorded usage in English of ''sesquipedalian'' is in 1656, and of ''sesquipedalianism'', 1863.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Simpson |first =J. A. |last2=Weiner |first2=E. S. C. |title=The Oxford English Dictionary (Second Edition) |year=1989 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Garrulous'' comes from Latin ''garrulus'', "talkative", a form of the verb ''garrīre'', "to chatter". The adjective may describe a person who is excessively talkative, especially about trivial matters, or a speech that is excessively wordy or diffuse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/garrulous |title=Dictionary.com - Garrulous |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com|accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The noun ''expatiation'' and the verb ''expatiate'' come from Latin ''expatiātus'', past participle from ''spatiārī'', "to wander". They refer to enlarging a discourse, text, or description.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/expatiation |title=Dictionary.com - expatiation |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com|accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific jargon==
The word ''logorrhea'' is often used [[pejorative]]ly to describe highly [[figurative language|abstract]] prose that contains little [[Literal and figurative language|concrete language]]. Since abstract writing is hard to visualize, it often seems confusing or excessive. Works in academic fields that involve many abstract ideas, such as [[philosophy]], often fail to include extensive concrete examples of their ideas.
 
In an attempt to prove that "logorrhea" accompanies a lack of academic rigor, physics professor [[Alan Sokal]] wrote a nonsensical essay, and had it published in a respected journal (''[[Social Text]]'') as a [[practical joke]]. The journal defended the article as genuine even after Sokal denounced his own article publicly. The episode has come to be known as the [[Sokal Affair]].&lt;ref name="Sokal"&gt;[http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/ The Sokal Affair]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is sometimes also applied to unnecessarily wordy speech in general; this is more usually referred to as ''prolixity''. Some people defend the use of additional words as [[idiom]]atic, a matter of artistic preference, or helpful in explaining complex ideas or messages.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==Examples==
[[Warren G. Harding]], the 29th [[President of the United States]], was notably verbose even in his era. {{citation needed|date=December 2012}} A Democratic leader, [[William Gibbs McAdoo]], described Harding's speeches as "an army of pompous phrases moving across the landscape in search of an idea."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/warrenharding|title=Warren G.

[[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Robert C. Byrd]] (Democrat, of [[West Virginia]]) lost his position as [[Majority Leader]] in 1989 because his colleagues felt his speeches, which often employed obscure [[allusion]]s to [[ancient Rome]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], were not an asset to the [[Party politics|party base]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-05-22-byrd-fight-GOP_x.htm |title=At 87, Byrd Faces Re-election Battle of His Career |date=2005-05-22|accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Michigan Law Review]]'' published a 229-page parody of postmodern writing titled "Pomobabble: Postmodern Newspeak and Constitutional 'Meaning' for the Uninitiated". The article consists of complicated and context-sensitive self-referencing narratives. The text is peppered with number of parenthetical citations and asides, which is supposed to mock the cluttered style of postmodern writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arrow|first=Dennis W.|title=Pomobabble: Postmodern Newspeak and Constitutional "Meaning" for the Uninitiated|journal=Michigan Law Review|date=December 1997|volume=96|issue=3|pages=461–690|jstor=1290146|doi=10.2307/1290146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The King's English]]'', Fowler gives a passage from ''[[The Times]]'' as an example of verbosity: "''The Emperor'' received yesterday and to-day General Baron von Beck.... It may therefore be assumed with some confidence that the terms of a feasible solution are maturing themselves in ''His Majesty's'' mind and may form the basis of further negotiations with Hungarian party leaders when ''the Monarch'' goes again to Budapest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fowler|first1=Henry Watson|last2=Fowler|first2=Francis George|title=The King's English|year=1908|publisher=Clarendon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fowler objected to this passage because ''The Emperor'', ''His Majesty'', and ''the Monarch'' all refer to the same person: "the effect", he pointed out in ''Modern English Usage'', "is to set readers wondering what the significance of the change is, only to conclude that there is none."

==Style advice==

The ancient Greek philosopher [[Callimachus]] is quoted as saying "Big book, big evil" (μέγα βιβλίον μέγα κακόν, ''mega biblion, mega kakon''), rejecting the [[Epic poetry|epic]] style of [[poetry]] in favor of his own.

[[William Strunk]], an American professor of English advised in 1918 to "Use the active voice: Put statements in positive form; Omit needless words."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strunk|first=William|title=The Elements of Style|year=1918|publisher=Feedbooks|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]'' (1926) [[Henry Watson Fowler]] says, "It is the second-rate writers, those intent rather on expressing themselves prettily than on conveying their meaning clearly, &amp; still more those whose notions of style are based on a few misleading rules of thumb, that are chiefly open to the allurements of [[elegant variation]]," Fowler's term for the over-use of [[synonym]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fowler|first=Henry Watson|title=A Dictionary of Modern English Usage|year=1994|publisher=Wordsworth Editions|isbn=978-1-85326-318-7|origyear=1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to Fowler's criticism of several words being used to name the same thing in English [[prose]], in some other languages, including [[French language|French]], it might be thought to be a good writing style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Translation And Creativity: Perspectives on Creative Writing And Translation Studies |chapter=Painting with words |editor=Eugenia Loffredo, Manuela Perteghella |first=Ann |last=Paterson |year=2006 |isbn=0-8264-8793-9 |page=88 |publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group|Continuum]]|quote=. . . the rule of ''elegant variation'' (that is, using synonyms wherever possible), which purists consider to be essential for good style in French.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Translator's Handbook: (with special reference to conference translation from French and Spanish) |first=Frederick |last=Fuller |year=1984 |isbn=0-271-00368-5 |page=35 |publisher=[[Penn State University Press]] |quote=''Elegant variation'' French tends to avoid repetition of proper names, with a description of the person, at second reference.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Twain]] (1835&amp;ndash;1910) wrote "generally, the fewer the words that fully communicate or evoke the intended ideas and feelings, the more effective the communication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.search.com/reference/Prolixity |title=Reference for Prolixity |publisher=Search.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716025741/http://www.search.com/reference/Prolixity |archivedate=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernest Hemingway]] (1899–1961), the 1954 [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] for literature, defended his concise style against a charge by [[William Faulkner]] that he "had never been known to use a word that might send the reader to the dictionary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1= Rovit|first1=Earl|last2=Waldhorn|first2=Arthur|title=Hemingway and Faulkner in Their Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9zRLAq6eBS4C&amp;pg=PA162|accessdate=28 February 2011|year=2006|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-0-8264-1825-8|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hemingway responded by saying, "Poor [[William Faulkner|Faulkner]]. Does he really think big emotions come from big words? He thinks I don't know the ten-dollar words. I know them all right. But there are older and simpler and better words, and those are the ones I use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Shapiro| first= Fred R.|title= The Yale Book of Quotations| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ck6bXqt5shkC&amp;pg=PA354 |accessdate= 28 February 2011| year= 2006 |publisher= Yale University Press| isbn=0-300-10798-6|page=354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An inquiry into the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|2005 London bombings]] found that verbosity can be dangerous if used by emergency services. It can lead to delay that could cost lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/8374581/77-inquests-emergency-services-should-use-plain-English.html |title=7/7 inquests: emergency services should use plain English|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 study from the [[psychology]] department of [[Princeton University]] found that using long and obscure words does not make people seem more intelligent. Dr. Daniel M. Oppenheimer did research which showed that students rated short, concise texts as being written by the most intelligent authors. But those who used long words or complex [[font]] types were seen as less intelligent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oppenheimer|first=Daniel M.|url=http://www.psych.utoronto.ca/users/psy3001/files/simple%20writing.pdf|format=PDF|year=2005|title=Consequences of Erudite Vernacular Utilized Irrespective of Necessity: Problems with using long words needlessly|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|volume=20|pages=139–15|doi=10.1002/acp.1178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Hamlet]]'', one of [[Polonius]]'s many [[sententiae|sententious]] maxims reads {{quote|Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,&lt;br&gt;And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,&lt;br&gt;I will be brief.}}
Shakespeare's audiences were not necessarily inclined to read Polonius as someone who is perfectly wise; his sentences, like that of much early modern drama, can easily be seen as part of a comic trope.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

[[George Orwell]] mocked logorrhea in "[[Politics and the English Language]]" (1946) by taking verse (9:11) from the book of [[Ecclesiastes]] in the [[Bible]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I returned and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and rewriting it as

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Objective consideration of contemporary phenomena compels the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable element of the unpredictable must invariably be taken into account."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Quantum physicist [[Richard Feynman]] has also spoken out against verbosity in scientific writing. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Feynman |first=Richard |date=Nov 1, 1992 |title=Surely you're joking, Mr. Feynman |publisher=Vintage Random House |page=9 |isbn= |accessdate=Jan 5, 2015 |quote='his almost compulsive need to solve puzzles, his provocative mischievousness, his indignant impatience with pretension and hypocrisy, and his talent for one-upping anybody who tries to one-up him'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech|title=My friend Richard Feynman |first=Leonard

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8952">The '''word count''' is the number of [[word]]s in a document or passage of text. Word counting may be needed when a text is required to stay within certain numbers of words. This may particularly be the case in [[academia]], legal proceedings, [[journalism]] and [[advertising]]. Word count is commonly used by [[translator]]s to determine the price for the translation job. Word counts may also be used to calculate measures of [[readability]] and to measure typing and reading speeds (usually in [[words per minute]]). When converting [[character (computing)|character]] counts to words, a measure of 5 or 6 characters to a word is generally used for English.&lt;ref&gt;The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America suggest [http://www.sfwa.org/2005/01/what-is-a-word/ 6 chars to a word]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Details and variations of definition ==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}
Variations in the [[operational definition]]s of how to count the words can occur (namely, what "counts as" a word, and which words "don't count" toward the total). However, especially since the advent of widespread [[word processing]], there is a broad consensus on these operational definitions (and hence the bottom-line integer result). The consensus is to accept the [[text segmentation]] rules generally found in most word processing software (including how [[Word#Word boundaries|word boundaries]] are determined, which depends on how [[word divider]]s are defined). The first trait of that definition is that a [[space (punctuation)|space]] (any of various [[whitespace character]]s, such as a "regular" word space, an [[space (punctuation)#Space characters and digital typography|em space]], or a [[tab key#Tab characters|tab character]]) is a word divider. Usually a [[hyphen]] or a [[slash (punctuation)|slash]] is, too. Different word counting programs may give varying results, depending on the [[text segmentation]] rule details, and on whether words outside the main text (such as [[note (typography)|footnotes]], [[note (typography)|endnotes]], or [[hidden text]]) are counted. But the behavior of most major word processing applications is broadly similar.

However, during the era when school assignments were done in [[handwriting]] or with [[typewriter]]s, the rules for these definitions often differed from today's consensus. Most importantly, many students were drilled on the rule that "certain words don't count", usually [[English articles|articles]] (namely, "a", "an", "the"), but sometimes also others, such as [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]]s (for example, "and", "or", "but") and some prepositions (usually "to", "of"). Hyphenated permanent compounds such as "follow-up" (noun) or "long-term" (adjective) were counted as one word. To save the time and effort of counting word-by-word, often a [[rule of thumb]] for the average number of words per line was used, such as 10 words per line. These "rules" have fallen by the wayside in the word processing era; the "word count" feature of such software (which follows the [[text segmentation]] rules mentioned earlier) is now the standard arbiter, because it is largely consistent (across documents and applications) and because it is fast, effortless, and costless (already included with the application).

As for which sections of a document "count" toward the total (such as [[note (typography)|footnotes]], [[note (typography)|endnotes]], [[abstract (summary)|abstract]]s, [[citation|reference lists and bibliographies]], [[table (information)|tables]], figure captions, [[hidden text]]), the person in charge (teacher, client) can define their choice, and users (students, workers) can simply [[selection (user interface)|select]] (or exclude) the elements accordingly, and watch the word count automatically update.

== Software ==
Modern [[web browser]]s support word counting via [[Browser extension|extensions]], via a [[JavaScript]] [[bookmarklet]],&lt;ref&gt;E.g., {{cite web | url=http://marklets.com/Word+Count.aspx | title=Word Count Bookmarklet | publisher=Marklets.com | accessdate=March 3, 2013 | author=Tavory, Ran}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[script (computing)|script]] &lt;ref&gt;E.g., {{cite web | url=https://wordcounttools.com/ | title=Word Count Tool | accessdate=March 6, 2014 | author=Word Counter}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is hosted in a website. Most [[word processor]]s can also count words. [[Unix]]-like systems include a  program, ''[[wc (Unix)|wc]]'', specifically for word counting. There are a wide variety of word counting tools available online.

As [[#Details and variations in how the count is defined|explained earlier]], different word counting programs may give varying results, depending on the [[text segmentation]] rule details. The exact number of words often is not a strict requirement, thus the variation is acceptable.

== In fiction ==
Novelist [[Jane Smiley]] suggests that length is an important quality of the [[novel]].&lt;ref&gt;Smiley, Jane. 2005. Thirteen Ways of Looking at the Novel. NY: Alfred A. Knopf, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; However, novels can vary tremendously in length; Smiley lists novels as typically being between 100,000 and 175,000 words,&lt;ref&gt;Smiley, 2005, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[National Novel Writing Month]] requires its novels to be at least 50,000 words. There are no firm rules: for example, the boundary between a [[novella]] and a [[novel]] is arbitrary and a literary work may be difficult to categorise.&lt;ref&gt;Edge, Tom, "Does Size Matter?"

'''Writer's block''' is a condition, primarily associated with [[writing]], in which an author loses the ability to produce new work, or experiences a creative slowdown. The condition ranges in difficulty from coming up with original ideas to being unable to produce a work for years. Throughout history, writer's block has been a documented problem.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;Clark, Irene. "Invention." Concepts in Composition: Theory and Practice in the Teaching of Writing. 2nd ed. New York: Routledge, 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Typewriter Adler No. 7 (5).jpg|thumb]]
Professionals who have struggled with the affliction include authors such as [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]&lt;ref&gt;Rienzi, Greg. "Great Scott: Fitzgerald's Baltimore." The JHU Gazette. Johns Hopkins University. 28. September 2009. Web. 19 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Joseph Mitchell (writer)|Joseph Mitchell]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-32602862 The ''New Yorker'' writer who didn't publish for 30 years ''BBC News'' feature and video 7 May 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; comic strip cartoonist [[Charles M. Schulz]],&lt;ref name=Downey&gt;Downey, Bill. Right Brain – Write ON!. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall, Inc. 1984. Print&lt;/ref&gt; composer [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-10766308 How great artists have fought creative block]&lt;/ref&gt; and songwriter [[Adele]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://shows.huffingtonpost.com/video/saturday-s-showbiz-news-adele-opens-up-about-writer-s-block-519185000?context=PC:homepage:PL6394:1445588705245 Adele Opens Up About Writer's Block]&lt;/ref&gt; Research concerning this topic was done in the late 1970s and 1980s. During this time, researchers were influenced by the Process and Post-Process movements, and therefore focused specifically on the writer's processes. The condition was first described in 1947 by psychoanalyst [[Edmund Bergler]].&lt;ref name="Akhtar2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Akhtar|first=Salman|title=Comprehensive dictionary of psychoanalysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=35HoGo2uF1kC&amp;pg=PA310|accessdate=17 October 2011|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Karnac Books|isbn=978-1-85575-860-5|page=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some great writers may have already suffered from writer’s block years before Bergler described it, such as [[Herman Melville]], who quit writing novels a few years after writing ''[[Moby-Dick]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, John J. “Wordsmiths Without Words.” National Review 68.9 (2016): 23-24. Academic Search Premier. Web. 20 Oct. 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Writer's block may have several causes. Some are [[Creativity|creative]] problems that originate within an author's work itself. A writer may run out of [[Artistic inspiration|inspiration]], or be distracted by other events. A fictional example can be found in [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Keep the Aspidistra Flying]]'', in which the protagonist Gordon Comstock struggles in vain to complete an [[epic poem]] describing a day in London: "It was too big for him, that was the truth. It had never really progressed, it had simply fallen apart into a series of fragments."&lt;ref&gt;George Orwell, ''Keep The Aspidistra Flying'', Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other blocks may be produced by adverse circumstances in a writer's life or career: physical illness, depression, the end of a [[Intimate relationship|relationship]], financial pressures, or a sense of failure.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} The pressure to produce work may in itself contribute to writer's block, especially if they are compelled to work in ways that are against their natural inclination (i.e. with a deadline or an unsuitable style or genre). Writer's block may also come from feeling intimidated by one's previous big successes.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The writer [[Elizabeth Gilbert]], reflecting on her post-bestseller prospects, proposed that such a pressure might be released by interpreting creative writers as "having" genius rather than "being" a genius.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/elizabeth_gilbert_on_genius.html Elizabeth Gilbert on nurturing creativity], a [[TED (conference)|TED]] talk in 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that writer's block is more than just a mentality. Under stress, a human brain will  "shift control from the [[cerebral cortex]] to the [[limbic system]]".&lt;ref name="writer's brain"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://quitwork.club/The-Writers-Brain-Rosanne-Bane41-50_1.pdf|title=The Writer's Brain|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The limbic system is associated with the instinctual processes, such as "fight or flight" response; and behavior that is based on "deeply engrained training". The limited input from the cerebral cortex hinders a person's creative processes, which are replaced by the behaviors associated with the limbic system. The person is often unaware of the change, which may lead them to believe they are creatively "blocked".&lt;ref name="writer's brain"/&gt; In her 2004 book ''The Midnight Disease: The Drive to Write, Writer's Block, and the Creative Brain'' ({{ISBN|9780618230655}}), the writer and [[neurology|neurologist]] [[Alice Weaver Flaherty|Alice W. Flaherty]] has argued that literary creativity is a function of specific [[List of regions in the human brain|areas of the brain]], and that block may be the result of brain activity being disrupted in those areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/06/14/040614fa_fact|first=Joan|last=Acolella|title=Blocked: why do writers stop writing?|work=The New Yorker|date=14 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a composition perspective, Lawrence Oliver says, in his article, "Helping Students Overcome Writer's Block", "Students receive little or no advice on how to generate ideas or explore their thoughts, and they usually must proceed through the writing process without guidance or corrective feedback from the teacher, who withholds comments and criticism until grading the final product."&lt;ref name=Oliver&gt;Oliver Jr., Lawrence J. "Helping Students Overcome Writer's Block." Journal of Reading. 26.2 (1982): 162–168. JSTOR. Online. 15 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He says, students "learn to write by writing", and often they are insecure and/or paralyzed by rules.&lt;ref name=Oliver /&gt;

Phyllis Koestenbaum wrote in her article "The Secret Climate the Year I Stopped Writing" about her trepidation toward writing, claiming it was tied directly to her instructor's response.&lt;ref name=Koestenbaum&gt;Koestenbaum, Phyllis. "The Secret Climate the Year I Stopped Writing." The Massachusetts Review. Vol. issue (Year): 278–308. Web. 15 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; She says, "I needed to write to feel, but without feeling I couldn't write."&lt;ref name=Koestenbaum /&gt; To contrast Koestenbaum experience, Nancy Sommers expressed her belief that papers do not end when students finish writing and that neither should instructors' comments.&lt;ref name=Sommers&gt;Somers, Nancy. "Across the Drafts." Concepts in Composition: Theory and Practice in Teaching of Writing. 2nd ed. New York: Routledge, 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; She urges a "partnership" between writers and instructors so that responses become a conversation.&lt;ref name=Sommers /&gt;

James Adams notes in his book, ''Conceptual Blockbusting'', various reasons blocks occur include fear of taking a risk, "chaos" in the pre-writing stage, judging versus generating ideas, an inability to incubate ideas, or a lack of motivation.&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;Adams, James. Conceptual Blockbusting. Cambridge: Perseus Publishing. 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
As far as strategies for coping with writer's block Clark describes: class and group discussion, journals, free writing and [[brainstorming]], clustering, list making, and engaging with the text.&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt; To overcome writing blocks, Oliver suggests asking writers questions to uncover their writing process.&lt;ref name=Oliver /&gt; Then he recommends solutions such as systematic questioning, freewriting, and encouragement.&lt;ref name=Oliver /&gt; A recent study of 2500 writers aimed to find techniques that writers themselves use to overcome writer's block.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stopprocrastinatingapp.com/writers-block|title=Study to discover strategies to overcome writer's block|website=www.stopprocrastinatingapp.com/writers-block|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research discovered a range of solutions from altering the time of day to write and setting deadlines to lowering expectations and using mindfulness meditation. 

Garbriele Lusser Rico's concern with the mind links to [[Lateralization of brain function|brain lateralization]], also explored by Rose and Linda Flowers and John R. Hayes among others. Rico's book, ''Writing the Natural Way'' looks into invention strategies, such as clustering, which has been noted to be an invention strategy used to help writers overcome their blocks,&lt;ref name=Rico&gt;Rico, Gabriele Lusser. ''Writing the Natural Way''. Boston: J. P. Teacher, Inc., 1983. Print&lt;/ref&gt; and further emphasizes the solutions presented in works by Rose, Oliver, and Clark. Similar to Rico, James Adams discusses right brain involvement in writing.&lt;ref name=Adams /&gt; While Downey purposes that he is basing his approach in practical concerns,&lt;ref name="Downey"/&gt; his concentration on right brain techniques speaks to cognitive theory approach similar to Rico's and a more practical advice for writers to approach their writer's block.&lt;ref name=Downey /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20561">'''Writing about Writing (WAW)''', is a method or theory of teaching composition which puts emphasis on reading and writing about writing in the writing course, and reimagines [[first-year composition]] as an "introduction to writing studies." This is not to say WAW only teaches a first-year writing course as if it were an introduction to a writing major, but rather it advocates merging the ''how'' of writing with its practice. An introduction course to a writing major has both a different audience and purpose than a first-year composition course framed in WAW. The development of WAW is largely credited to Elizabeth Wardle and Douglas Downs after the publication of their 2007 article "Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions."

==History==
Composition is not widely recognized as its own discipline. Composition instructors strive to teach students how to become better writers. As public perception often shapes public policy, this uninformed view of composition as a legitimate field of study has contributed to a lack of funding and emphasis on composition classes in academia.&lt;ref name= Carter&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carter|first=Shannon|title=Writing about Writing in Basic Writing: A Teacher/Researcher/Activist Narrative|journal=Basic Writing e-journal|origyear=2009|year=2010|volume=8-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions"===
In 2007, Douglas Downs and Elizabeth Wardle published an article titled "Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions" in which they propose a reform of first-year composition instruction based on the results of a test course they developed.  This course sought "to improve students' understanding of writing, [[rhetoric]], language, and literacy" and promoted a view of reading and writing as scholarly inquiry, encouraging "more realistic conceptions of writing."  &lt;ref name= DownsWardle&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downs|first=Douglas|author2=Elizabeth Wardle |title=Teaching About Writing, Righting Misconceptions: (Re)Envisioning 'First Year Composition' as 'Introduction to Writing Studies']|journal=College Composition and Communication|year=2007|volume=58|issue=4|pages=552–584}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article is considered to be revolutionary by other scholars in the field, and it's frequently cited by those who have continued the work in the WAW movement.

In the article, Downs and Wardle deny the existence of a universal educated discourse, which conflicts with first-year composition goals of preparing students to write across the curriculum. Downs and Wardle write that teaching students how to write across the curriculum supports the idea that "writing is not a real subject, that writing courses do not require expert instructors, and that rhetoric and composition are not genuine research areas or legitimate intellectual pursuits."&lt;ref name= DownsWardle /&gt;

The article goes on to outline the course they designed that is centered more on teaching the students about "writing studies", rather than how to write in college. The authors discuss readers, research assignments, reflective assignments and presentation assignments before going on to report case-studies of two students who took Downs' and Wardle's WAW-centered first-year composition course. While these were different types of students who had different learning outcomes, both stories illustrate the flexible nature of WAW and how this type of course can be tailored towards individual student needs. The authors discuss several benefits they observed of using WAW to teach first-year composition, but also indicate the presence of challenges associated with teaching this kind of course, and address both these challenges as well as critiques they received from colleagues.

The authors conclude that an implementation of WAW-centered classes in first-year composition professionalizes writing instruction, and raises awareness about writing studies as a legitimate discipline. Downs and Wardle write "rather than purporting to teach students 'academic writing' and claiming to prepare them for writing in their disciplines, the course teaches students what we as a field have learned about writing as an object of study."&lt;ref name= DownsWardle /&gt; Essentially, the aim of a WAW course is to demonstrate how writing works.

==="Continuing the Dialogue"===
After its publication, the article caused a stir in academia and received a lot of response from the community, prompting a follow-up article by Wardle in 2008 titled "Continuing the Dialogue: Follow-up Comments on 'Teaching about Writing, Righting
Misconceptions.'" In it, Wardle addresses responders who commented that she and Downs put too much emphasis on first-year composition within the field by explaining that first-year composition should not hold more value than other branches within their field, but it is of importance and merits scholarly inquiry. She reaffirms their main point as being "that we should reconceive the nature of FYC goals and focus on the content knowledge we have as a field from which students can benefit."&lt;ref name= follow&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wardle|first=Elizabeth|title=Continuing the Dialogue: Follow-up Comments on 'Teaching About Writing, Righting Misconceptions'|journal=College Composition and Communication|year=2008|volume=60|issue=1|pages=175–181}}&lt;/ref&gt; She goes on to write, "Let me be as clear as possible: Doug and I are arguing that composition instructors should refuse to separate knowledge about writing from practice in writing and some instruction on how to complete the writing tasks at hand."&lt;ref name=follow /&gt; Another misconception she addresses is misconstruing a first-year writing WAW approach as being the same as an introductory course to a writing ''major'' and dismisses the claims that a WAW approach is put in place to recruit writing majors. The differences between these two courses, she explains, are both audience and purpose. Downs and Wardle expanded have produced an accompanying textbook, ''Writing about Writing: A College Reader'', which was published in 2011.

==Benefits==
In "Teaching About Writing, Righting Misconceptions," Downs and Wardle discuss several benefits they found WAW affords students including:&lt;ref name=DownsWardle /&gt;
*an increased self-awareness about writing
*improved reading abilities
*improved confidence as a student
*raised awareness of research writing as conversation

WAW asks students to read about writing and various processes, which allows them to identify what works for them. By reading articles that a composition studies student might read, the first-year composition student is able to gain further insight into the ongoing conversation centered around writing. In her article "Writing about Writing in [[Basic writing|Basic Writing]]," Shannon Carter explains "a writing-about-writing approach foregrounds research in writing and related studies by asking students to read and discuss key research in the discipline and contribute to the scholarly conversation themselves." &lt;ref name=Carter /&gt; She explains that having students immerse themselves in this type of scholarship will not only improve their writing but their understanding of writing as an academic discipline will increase as well, which in turn contributes to changing the public perception that writing is only something that is a piece of other disciplines.

Many instructors who use WAW are also benefited in that they themselves are able to learn more about composition studies along with their class, promoting parallel learning. In an article titled "Seeing is Believing: Writing Studies with 'Basic Writing' Students," Charlton reports that some see value in teaching first-year composition from a cultural studies approach because not only does this allow for composition instructors to teach what they love, but the types of reading promote critical thinking and analysis—two goals many first-year composition courses have. Also, the article reports on several instructors incorporating graduate level writing-studies readings into their first-year writing courses with much success. Charlton writes, "Students were engaged and were developing research questions and projects that rivaled my on senior-level composition theory class, both in terms of complexity and overall quality of finished products."&lt;ref name= Jonikka&gt;{{cite journal|last=Charlton|first=Jonkka|title=Seeing is Believing: Writing Studies with 'Basic Writing' Students|journal=Basic Writing Online|origyear=2009|year=2012|volume=8/9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and responses==
As WAW is a relatively recent movement and is still in its early stages of development, proponents don't always agree on how WAW should be applied to the classroom. Carter points out instructors only account for a small portion of the composition community, and therefore disagreement is common and "often in fundamental ways." &lt;ref name=Carter /&gt;

In his response to Downs and Wardle's "Teaching About Writing, Righting Misconceptions," Joshua P. Kutney argues that providing students with an awareness of writing through WAW won't necessarily transfer to their writing performance. He compares WAW to students who take courses that raise their awareness of social problems. While students gain a greater sense of these issues through these courses, rarely do they display behavioral changes in regards to these issues.

Kutney also argues that an increased awareness of writing studies may result in students becoming more comfortable with validating their insufficiencies as a writer because they now recognize the difficulties expert writers have, and not because they now comprehend "the nuances of the composing process." He goes on to say that while Downs and Wardle discuss WAW as allowing students to see academic writing as engaging in an ongoing conversation, this knowledge might overwhelm the student and cause them to avoid engaging in the conversation altogether. Kutney writes, "While First-Year Composition may not do much to develop the writing abilities of students, Downs and Wardle offer no reason to think that Introduction to Writing Studies, a course that does not purport to teach writing, will do more." &lt;ref name= Kutney&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kutney|first=Joshua P.|title=Will Writing Awareness Transfer to Writing Performance? Response to Douglas Downs and Elizabeth Wardle, 'Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions'|journal=College Composition and Communication|year=2007|volume=59|issue=10|pages=276–279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their response to Downs and Wardle, Miles et al. claim a WAW approach seems like it serves as an introduction to a writing major, which would not be beneficial to first-year students. They take issue with Downs and Wardle's "dismissal of the importance of teaching situated procedural knowledge",&lt;ref name=Miles&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miles|first=Libby|title=Interchanges: Commenting on Douglas Downs and Elizabeth Wardle's 'Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions'|journal=College Composition and Communication|year=2008|volume=59|issue=3|pages=503–511|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably the rhetorical situation. Miles et al. claim the only rhetorical situation a WAW course exposes its students to is that of scholarly research. They also argue that Downs and Wardle put too much emphasis on first-year composition within the field of writing studies, seeing it as the predominant branch of the field. They also argue that Downs and Wardle fail to give voice to the students in their case study who didn't benefit from the WAW approach and that only those who did are highlighted. Another main criticism they have is WAW's reliance on one modality of research writing while they argue that their "research and scholarship is an interesting hybrid of several modalities at once."&lt;ref name=Miles /&gt;

Downs published a response to Miles et al. in which he expresses displeasure at the arguments the authors laid out:&lt;blockquote&gt; My first reaction to Miles et al.'s response to "FYC as Intro to Writing Studies" is about as magnanimous as their response itself – that is, not remotely. This disappoints me, because I do maintain the ideal of scholarship wherein a constructive dialectic stretches, shapes, and builds ideas rather than merely tearing them down. I confess my first instinct is to tear down Miles et al.'s response as they attempt to tear down the construct we forwarded. (Earning the condemnation of an entire department is bracing-and ironic when the scholarship of some of the signatories – for me, Schwegler and Shamoon – planted seeds of ideas they find unworkable.&lt;ref name=Downs&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downs|first=Douglas|title=Response to Miles et al.|journal=College Composition and Communication|year=2008|volume=60|issue=1|pages=175–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;He writes Miles et al. "seem to address us as if we are sitting at the kids' table at Thanksgiving dinner." His main contentions are:&lt;ref name=Downs /&gt;
*Miles et al. seem only to respond to arguments Downs and Wardle didn't make rather than focusing on the ones they did.
*There is a major difference between the type of course he and Wardle advocate from first-year writing and a course that serves as in introduction to a writing major.
*Miles et al. grossly misinterpreted the types of readings that are purposed to be involved in WAW, as they are not all of an academic nature and nowhere in Downs' and Wardle's article do they say that it is.
*In regards to the criticism that first-year writing students will have a difficult time comprehending readings that are also taught to graduate students, Downs states that it's an "admirable goal" of writing programs to support this kind of learning, and cutting first-year students off from this type of learning is "unnecessarily limiting."
He concludes by writing "I am grateful not only for the opportunity to respond, but to have something to respond to. And I wonder how differently our students might understand writing if they had similar opportunities."&lt;ref name=Downs /&gt;

A response to Downs' response to Miles et al. by Slomp and Sargent doesn't reject Downs and Wardle's ideas in the same way Miles et al. does, but calls for more research on the WAW method. The authors also argue that Downs and Wardle fail to position themselves into an ongoing conversation in the same way they advocate for in WAW. Slomp and Sargent say that Downs and Wardle paint themselves to be "lone pioneers" in this venture, but in the 1990s Wendy Bishop supported the use of writing as the main subject in the writing classroom. They also reference [[Peter Elbow]] as being someone who touched on similar ideas to WAW long before Downs and Wardle published "Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Slomp|first=David H.|author2=M. Elizabeth Sargent |title=Responses to Responses: Douglas Downs and Elizabeth Wardle's 'Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions'|journal=College Composition and Communication|year=2009|volume=60|issue=1|pages=171–175|url=http://www.ncte.org/library/NCTEFiles/Resources/Journals/CCC/0603-feb09/CCC0603ResponseTeaching.pdf/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shannon Carter, while a proponent of WAW, describes how it isn't always accessible to other instructors or policy makers. She describes how WAW can be "off-putting" to others, and the scholarship on the subject cannot be relied on in making changes to composition curriculum. She explains that while WAW can be effective for some, it is simply one way to approach teaching composition and won't work with everyone's teaching style.&lt;ref name=Carter /&gt;

As previously mentioned, many believe that because the readings are written by professionals for professionals, undergraduates will not be able to easily understand the concepts, which will negatively affect engagement with the course. Some even question Downs and Wardle's motives, and see WAW as a ploy in "recruiting" more students to become majors in the field.&lt;ref name= Jonikka /&gt;

==''Writing about Writing: A College Reader''==
Published in 2011, Downs and Wardle's book is described as "encouraging students to draw on what they know in order to contribute to ongoing conversations about writing and literacy." &lt;ref name=Bedford&gt;Bedford St. Martin's, [http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/Catalog/product/writingaboutwriting-firstedition-wardle/ Writing about Writing] 10 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the preface for the instructors, Downs and Wardle describes their frustration with composition courses that are based around themes that have nothing to do with writing. They list several reasons as to why WAW is a "smart choice" in terms of an approach to teaching first-year composition:&lt;ref name=WAW&gt;{{cite book|last=Downs|first=Douglas|author2=Elizabeth Wardle |title=Writing about Writing: A College Reader|year=2011|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-53493-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*WAW engages students in a relevant subject
*WAW engages students' own area of expertise
*WAW helps students transfer what they learn
*WAW has been extensively class tested—and it works.

The book addresses several questions geared towards helping the student understand multiple components of writing: Why study writing? How do readers read and writers write?  How do you write? How have you become the readers and writer you are today? How do communities shape writing? How do you make yourself heard as college writer? A mixture of selected readings from both scholars, authors, and students are provided, as well as various activities and discussion questions associated with the readings.&lt;ref name=WAW /&gt;

{{Writing systems worldwide}}
{{writing systems sidebar}}
A '''writing system''' is any conventional method of visually representing verbal [[communication]].  While both [[writing]] and [[spoken language|speech]] are useful in conveying [[message]]s, writing differs in also being a reliable form of [[information]] storage and [[information transfer|transfer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/definition.htm | title=Definitions of writing systems | publisher=www.omniglot.com | work=Omniglot: The Online Encyclopedia of Writing Systems and Languages | accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The processes of [[code|encoding and decoding]] writing systems involve shared understanding between writers and [[reading (process)|readers]] of the meaning behind the sets of [[character (symbol)|characters]] that make up a script.  Writing is usually recorded onto a [[Storage medium#Recording medium|durable medium]], such as paper or [[data storage device|electronic storage]], although non-durable methods may also be used, such as writing on a computer [[display device|display]], on a blackboard, in sand, or by [[skywriting]].

The general attributes of writing systems can be placed into broad categories such as [[alphabet]]s, [[syllabary|syllabaries]], or [[logogram|logographies]]. Any particular system can have attributes of more than one category. In the alphabetic category, there is a standard set of [[letter (alphabet)|letters]] (basic written [[symbol]]s or [[grapheme]]s) of [[consonant]]s and [[vowel]]s that encode based on the general principle that the letters (or letter pair/groups) represent [[phoneme|speech sounds]]. In a syllabary, each symbol correlates to a [[syllable]] or [[mora (linguistics)|mora]]. In a logography, each character represents a word, [[morpheme]], or other semantic units. Other categories include [[abjad]]s, which differ from alphabets in that vowels are not indicated, and [[abugida]]s or alphasyllabaries, with each character representing a consonant–vowel pairing. Alphabets typically use a set of 20-to-35 symbols to fully express a language{{Citation needed|reason=Even the basic Roman alphabet has more symbols — after all “A” and “a” are clearly different symbols, though maybe not letters.|date=February 2018}}, whereas syllabaries can have 80-to-100{{Citation needed|reason=So how come 710 Canadian syllabics are encoded in Unicode?|date=February 2018}}, and logographies can have several hundreds of symbols.{{Citation needed|reason=To read a Chinese newspaper or book you need to know several thousand Chinese characters.|date=February 2018}}

Most systems will typically have an ordering of its symbol elements so that groups of them can be coded into larger clusters like [[word]]s or [[acronym]]s (generally [[lexeme]]s), giving rise to many more possibilities ([[permutation]]s) in meanings than the symbols can convey by themselves. Systems will also enable the [[concatenation|stringing together]] of these smaller groupings (sometimes referred to by the generic term 'character strings') in order to enable a full expression of the language. The reading step can be accomplished purely in the mind as an internal process, or [[reading aloud|expressed orally]].  A special set of symbols known as [[punctuation]] is used to aid in structure and organization of many writing systems and can be used to help capture nuances and variations in the message's meaning that are communicated verbally by cues in [[rhythm|timing]], [[tone (linguistics)|tone]], [[pitch accent|accent]], [[inflection]] or [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]].  A writing system will also typically have a method for formatting recorded messages that follows the spoken version's rules like its [[grammar]] and [[syntax]] so that the [[receiver (information theory)|reader]] will have the [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] of the intended message accurately preserved.

Writing systems were preceded by [[proto-writing]], which used [[pictogram]]s, [[ideogram]]s and other [[mnemonic]] symbols. Proto-writing lacked the ability to capture and express a full range of thoughts and ideas. The invention of writing systems, which dates back to the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]] in the late [[Neolithic Era]] of the late [[4th millennium BC]], enabled the accurate durable recording of [[human history]] in a manner that was not prone to the same [[telephone (game)|types of error]] to which [[oral tradition|oral history]] is vulnerable. Soon after, writing provided [[postal system|a reliable form]] of long distance communication. With the advent of [[publishing]], it provided the [[media (communication)|medium]] for an early form of [[mass communication]].

The creation of a new alphabetic writing system for a language with an existing logographic writing system is called alphabetization, as when the [[People's Republic of China]] studied the prospect of alphabetizing the [[Chinese language]]s with [[Latin script]], [[Cyrillic script]], [[Arabic script]], and even numbers,&lt;ref name="isbn_9780060826581"&gt;{{Citation |last=Hessler |first=Peter |year=2006 |title=Oracle Bones: A Journey Between China's Past and Present |publisher=Harper Collins |chapter=Artifact K: The Lost Alphabets |pages=401–417 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JvmZjIDiOwcC |isbn=9780060826581 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the most common instance of it, converting to Latin script, is usually called [[romanization]].

== General properties ==
[[File:Kuozhai.jpg|thumb|Chinese characters (漢字) are morpho-syllabic. Each one represents a syllable with a distinct meaning, but some characters may have multiple meanings or pronunciations]]

Writing systems are distinguished from other possible [[symbolic communication]] systems in that a writing system is always associated with at least one [[spoken language]]. In contrast, visual representations such as drawings, paintings, and non-verbal items on maps, such as contour lines, are not language-related. Some symbols on information signs, such as the symbols for male and female, are also not language related, but can grow to become part of language if they are often used in conjunction with other language elements. Some other symbols, such as [[Numeral system|numerals]] and the [[ampersand]], are not directly linked to any specific language, but are often used in writing and thus must be considered part of writing systems.

Every human community possesses language, which many regard as an innate and defining condition of humanity. However, the development of writing systems, and the process by which they have supplanted traditional [[orality|oral]] systems of communication, have been sporadic, uneven and slow. Once established, writing systems generally change more slowly than their spoken counterparts. Thus they often preserve features and expressions which are no longer current in the spoken language. One of the great benefits of writing systems is that they can preserve a permanent record of information expressed in a language.

All writing systems require:

* at least one set of defined base elements or [[symbol]]s, individually termed ''signs'' and collectively called a ''script'';&lt;ref&gt;Coulmas, Florian. 2003. ''Writing systems. An introduction''. Cambridge University Press. pg. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;
* at least one set of rules and conventions ([[orthography]]) understood and shared by a community, which assigns [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]] to the base elements ([[grapheme]]s), their ordering and relations to one another;
* at least one language (generally [[spoken language|spoken]]) whose constructions are represented and can be recalled by the interpretation of these elements and rules;
* some physical means of distinctly representing the symbols by application to a permanent or semi-permanent [[medium (communication)|medium]], so they may be interpreted (usually visually, but tactile systems have also been devised).

== Basic terminology ==
[[File:A Specimen by William Caslon.jpg|thumb|''A Specimen'' of typefaces and styles, by [[William Caslon]], letter founder; from the 1728 ''[[Cyclopædia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'']]

In the examination of individual scripts, the study of writing systems has developed along partially independent lines. Thus, the terminology employed differs somewhat from field to field.

=== Text, writing, reading and orthography ===
The generic term ''text''&lt;ref&gt;David Crystal (2008), [http://as.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405152966.html ''A Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics'', 6th Edition], p.481, Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; refers to an instance of written or spoken material with the latter having been transcribed in some way. The act of composing and recording a text may be referred to as ''[[writing]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Hadumod Bußmann (1998), [https://books.google.com.tw/books/about/Routledge_Dictionary_of_Language_and_Lin.html?id=rhvDiOxOUe4C&amp;redir_esc=y ''Routledge Dictionary of Language and Linguistics''], p.1294, Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt; and the act of viewing and interpreting the text as ''[[Reading (activity)|reading]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hadumod Bußmann (1998), [https://books.google.com.tw/books/about/Routledge_Dictionary_of_Language_and_Lin.html?id=rhvDiOxOUe4C&amp;redir_esc=y ''Routledge Dictionary of Language and Linguistics''], p.979, Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Orthography]]'' refers to the method and rules of observed writing structure (literal meaning, "correct writing"), and particularly for [[alphabet]]ic systems, includes the concept of ''[[spelling]]''.

=== Grapheme and phoneme ===
{{main|grapheme|phoneme}}
A ''[[grapheme]]'' is a specific base unit of a writing system. Graphemes are the ''minimally significant'' elements which taken together comprise the set of "building blocks" out of which texts made up of one or more writing systems may be constructed, along with rules of correspondence and use. The concept is similar to that of the [[phoneme]] used in the study of spoken languages. For example, in the [[Latin]]-based writing system of standard contemporary English, examples of graphemes include the [[majuscule]] and [[Lower case|minuscule]] forms of the twenty-six letters of the alphabet (corresponding to various phonemes), marks of [[punctuation]] (mostly non-phonemic), and a few other symbols such as those for [[Arabic numeral|numerals]] (logograms for numbers).

An individual grapheme may be represented in a wide variety of ways, where each variation is visually distinct in some regard, but all are interpreted as representing the "same" grapheme. These individual variations are known as ''[[allograph]]s'' of a grapheme (compare with the term [[allophone]] used in linguistic study). For example, the minuscule letter ''a'' has different allographs when written as a [[cursive]], [[capital letters|block]], or [[typeface|typed]] letter. The choice of a particular allograph may be influenced by the medium used, the [[Writing implement|writing instrument]], the stylistic choice of the writer, the preceding and following graphemes in the text, the time available for writing, the intended audience, and the largely unconscious features of an individual's [[handwriting]].

=== Glyph, sign and character ===
The terms ''[[glyph]]'', ''[[sign (linguistics)|sign]]'' and ''character'' are sometimes used to refer to a grapheme. Common usage varies from discipline to discipline; compare [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform sign]], [[Maya script|Maya glyph]], [[Chinese character]]. The glyphs of most writing systems are made up of lines (or strokes) and are therefore called [[Linear writing|linear]], but there are glyphs in [[Non-linear writing|non-linear writing systems]] made up of other types of marks, such as Cuneiform and [[Braille]].

=== Complete and partial writing systems ===
Writing systems may be regarded as ''complete'' according to the extent to which they are able to represent all that may be expressed in the spoken language, while a ''partial'' writing system is limited in what it can convey.&lt;ref&gt;Harriet Joseph Ottenheimer (2012), [https://books.google.com.tw/books?id=EYcJAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA194 ''The Anthropology of Language: An Introduction to Linguistic Anthropology'', p.194], Cengage Learning&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Writing systems, languages and conceptual systems ===
Writing systems can be independent from languages, one can have multiple writing systems for a language, e.g., [[Hindi–Urdu controversy|Hindi and Urdu]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/27680/is-it-plausible-to-have-two-written-forms-of-one-spoken-language-that-are-so-dif StackExchange: Is it plausible to have two written forms of one spoken language that are so different as to be indecipherable?]&lt;/ref&gt; and one can also have one writing system for multiple languages, e.g., the [[Arabic script]]. Chinese characters were also borrowed by variant countries as their early writing systems, e.g., the [[Vietnamese language#Writing systems|early writing systems]] of [[Vietnamese language]] until the beginning of the 20th century.

To represent a [[conceptual system]], one uses one or more languages, e.g., mathematics is a conceptual system&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.tw/books?id=1_IkBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA126 Metaphor and Analogy in the Sciences, p.126], Springer Science &amp; Business Media (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; and one may use [[first-order logic]] and a [[natural language]] together in representation.

== History ==
{{main article|History of writing}}
[[File:Sanskrit Brhama English alphabets.jpg|thumb|Table of scripts in the introduction to ''[[Sanskrit]]-English Dictionary'' by [[Monier Monier-Williams]]]]

Writing systems were preceded by [[proto-writing]], systems of [[ideogram|ideographic]] and/or early [[mnemonic]] symbols. The best known examples are:

* [[Jiahu symbols]], carved on [[tortoise]] [[Animal shell|shells]] in [[Jiahu]], c. 6600 BC
* [[Vinča symbols]] ([[Tărtăria tablets]]), {{circa}}5300 BC
* Early [[Indus script]], c. 3500 BC.
* [[Nsibidi]] script, c. before 500 AD

The invention of the first writing systems is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]] in the late [[Neolithic]]{{dubious|Bronze Age is what follows after Neolithic, by definition. Or is there some deeper meaning hidden here?|date=May 2015}} of the late [[4th millennium BC]]. The [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] archaic [[cuneiform script]] and the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] are generally considered the earliest writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral proto-literate symbol systems from 3400 to 3200 BC with earliest coherent texts from about [[26th century BC|2600 BC]]. It is generally agreed that Sumerian writing was an independent invention; however, it is debated whether Egyptian writing was developed completely independently of Sumerian, or was a case of [[cultural diffusion]].

A similar debate exists for the [[Chinese script]], which developed around 1200 BC. [[Chinese script]] are probably an independent invention, because there is no evidence of contact between China and the literate civilizations of the Near East,&lt;ref&gt;David N. Keightley, Noel Barnard. The Origins of Chinese civilization. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4-vdP2aZWhUC&amp;pg=PA415 Page 415-416]&lt;/ref&gt; and because of the distinct differences between the Mesopotamian and Chinese approaches to [[logogram|logography]] and phonetic representation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Sex_and_Eroticism_in_Mesopotamian_Litera.html?id=Fn67_Rid51EC Sex and Eroticism in Mesopotamian Literature]. By Dr Gwendolyn Leick. Pg 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerican writing systems]] (including among others [[Olmec]] and [[Maya script]]s) are generally believed to have had independent origins.

A [[Mi'kmaq hieroglyphic writing|hieroglyphic writing system]] used by pre-colonial [[Mi'kmaq]], that was observed by missionaries from the 17th to 19th centuries, is thought to have developed independently. Although, there is some debate over whether or not this was a fully formed system or just a series of mnemonic pictographs.

It is thought that the first [[consonantal alphabet]]ic writing appeared before 2000 BC, as a representation of language developed by [[Semitic people|Semitic]] tribes in the Sinai-peninsula (see [[History of the alphabet]]). Most other alphabets in the world today either descended from this one innovation, many via the [[Phoenician alphabet]], or were directly inspired by its design.

The first true alphabet is the [[Greek alphabet|Greek script]] which consistently represents [[vowel]]s since 800 BC.&lt;ref name="Blackwell"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coulmas|first=Florian|title=The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Writing Systems|year=1996|publisher=Blackwell Publishers Ltd.|location=Oxford|isbn=0-631-21481-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="True alphabet"&gt;{{harvnb|Millard|1986|p=396}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Latin alphabet]], a direct descendant, is by far the most common writing system in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haarmann|2004|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functional classification ==
{{for|lists of writing systems by type|List of writing systems}}
[[File:Puyi's schoolbook - Forbidden City.JPG|thumb|This textbook for [[Puyi]] shows the [[English alphabet]]. Although the English letters run from left to right, the Chinese explanations run from top to bottom then right to left, as traditionally written]]

Several approaches have been taken to classify writing systems, the most common and basic one is a broad division into three categories: ''logographic'', ''syllabic'', and ''alphabetic'' (or ''segmental''); however, all three may be found in any given writing system in varying proportions, often making it difficult to categorise a system uniquely. The term ''complex system'' is sometimes used to describe those where the admixture makes classification problematic. Modern linguists regard such approaches, including Diringer's&lt;ref&gt;David Diringer (1962): ''Writing''. London.&lt;/ref&gt;
* pictographic script
* ideographic script
* analytic transitional script
* [[Phonetic transcription|phonetic script]]
* alphabetic script
as too simplistic, often considering the categories to be incomparable.
Hill&lt;ref&gt;Archibald Hill (1967): ''The typology of Writing systems''. In: William A. Austin (ed.), Papers in Linguistics in Honor of Leon Dostert. The Hague, 92–99.&lt;/ref&gt; split ''writing'' into three major categories of linguistic analysis, one of which covers discourses and is not usually considered writing proper:
* ''discourse system''
** ''iconic discourse system'', e.g. [[Amerindian languages|Amerindian]]
** ''conventional discourse system'', e.g. [[Quipu]]
* ''morphemic writing system'', e.g. [[Hieroglyph|Egyptian]], [[Cuneiform|Sumerian]], [[Maya writing|Maya]], [[Chinese character|Chinese]]
* ''phonemic writing system''
** ''partial phonemic writing system'', e.g. [[Demotic script|Egyptian]], [[Hebrew script|Hebrew]], [[Arabic script|Arabic]]
** ''poly-phonemic writing system'', e.g. [[Linear B]], [[Kana]], [[Cherokee script|Cherokee]]
** ''mono-phonemic writing system''
*** ''phonemic writing system'', e.g. [[Ancient Greek]], [[English writing system|Old English]]
*** ''morpho-phonemic writing system'', e.g. [[German writing system|German]], [[English writing system|Modern English]]
Sampson draws a distinction between ''[[semasiography]]'' and ''glottography''
* semasiography, relating visible marks to meaning directly without reference to any specific spoken language
* glottography, using visible marks to represent forms of a spoken language
** logography, representing a spoken language by assigning distinctive visible marks to linguistic elements of André Martinet's "first articulation" (Martinet 1949), i.e. morphemes or words
** phonography, achieving the same goal by assigning marks to elements of the "second articulation", e.g. phonemes, syllables
DeFrancis,&lt;ref&gt;John DeFrancis (1989): ''Visible speech. The diverse oneness of writing systems''. Honolulu&lt;/ref&gt; criticizing Sampson's&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Sampson (1986): ''Writing Systems. A Linguistic Approach''. London&lt;/ref&gt; introduction of ''semasiographic writing'' and ''featural alphabets'' stresses the phonographic quality of writing proper
* ''pictures''
** ''nonwriting''
** ''writing''
*** ''[[rebus]]''
**** ''syllabic systems''
***** ''pure syllabic'', e.g. Linear B, Yi, Kana, Cherokee
***** ''{{visible anchor|morpho-syllabic}}'', e.g. Sumerian, Chinese, Mayan
***** ''consonantal''
****** ''morpho-consonantal'', e.g. Egyptian
****** ''pure consonantal'', e.g. Phoenician
****** ''alphabetic''
******* ''pure phonemic'', e.g. Greek
******* ''morpho-phonemic'', e.g. English
Faber&lt;ref&gt;Alice Faber (1992): ''Phonemic segmentation as an epiphenomenon. Evidence from the history of alphabetic writing''. In: Pamela Downing et al. (ed.): The Linguistics of Literacy. Amsterdam. 111–134.&lt;/ref&gt; categorizes phonographic writing by two levels, linearity and coding:
* ''logographic'', e.g. [[Chinese character|Chinese]], [[Hieroglyph|Ancient Egyptian]]
* ''phonographic''
** ''syllabically linear''
*** ''syllabically coded'', e.g. [[Kana]], [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]
*** ''segmentally coded'', e.g. [[Hebrew script|Hebrew]], [[Syriac script|Syriac]], [[Arabic script|Arabic]], [[Ethiopian script|Ethiopian]], [[Amharic script|Amharic]], [[Devanagari]]
** ''segmentally linear''
*** ''complete'' (alphabet), e.g. [[Latin alphabet|Greco-Latin]], [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]
*** ''defective'', e.g. [[Ugaritic]], [[Phoenician script|Phoenician]], [[Aramaic script|Aramaic]], [[Old South Arabian]], [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet|Paleo-Hebrew]]

&lt;!--The oldest-known forms of writing were primarily [[logogram|logographic]] in nature, that is, based on [[pictogram|pictographic]] and [[ideogram|ideographic]] elements.

A ''logogram'' is a single written character which represents a complete grammatical word. Most traditional [[Chinese character]]s are classified as logograms.

As each character represents a single word (or, more precisely, a [[morpheme]]), many logograms are required to write all the words of language. The vast array of logograms and the memorization of what they mean are major disadvantages of logographic systems over alphabetic systems. However, since the meaning is inherent to the symbol, the same logographic system can theoretically be used to represent different languages. In practice, the ability to communicate across languages only works for the closely related [[varieties of Chinese]], as differences in syntax reduce the crosslinguistic portability of a given logographic system. [[Japanese language|Japanese]] uses [[kanji|Chinese logograms]] extensively in its writing systems, with most of the symbols carrying the same or similar meanings. However, the grammatical differences between Japanese and Chinese are significant enough that a long Chinese text is not readily understandable to a Japanese reader without any knowledge of basic [[Chinese grammar]], though short and concise phrases such as those on signs and newspaper headlines are much easier to comprehend.

While most languages do not use wholly logographic writing systems, many languages use some logograms. A good example of modern western logograms are the [[Hindu-Arabic numerals]]: everyone who uses those symbols understands what ''1'' means whether they call it ''one'', ''eins'', ''uno'', ''yi'', ''ichi'', ''ehad'', ''ena'', or ''jedan''. Other western logograms include the [[ampersand]] ''&amp;'', used for ''and'', the [[at sign]] ''@'', used in many contexts for ''at'', the [[percent sign]] ''%'' and the many signs representing units of currency ([[dollar sign|$]], [[Cent (currency)#Symbol|¢]], [[Euro sign|€]], [[Pound sign|£]], [[¥]] and so on.)

Logograms are sometimes called [[ideogram]]s, a word that refers to symbols which graphically represent abstract ideas, but linguists avoid this use, as Chinese characters are often [[semantics|semantic]]–[[phonetic]] compounds, symbols which include an element that represents the meaning and a [[phonetic complement]] element that represents the pronunciation. Some nonlinguists distinguish between [[lexigraphy]] and ideography, where symbols in lexigraphies represent words and symbols in ideographies represent words or morphemes.

The most important (and, to a degree, the only surviving) modern logographic writing system is the Chinese one, whose characters have been used with varying degrees of modification in [[varieties of Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], and other [[east Asian languages]]. [[Ancient Egypt]]ian hieroglyphs and the Mayan writing system are also systems with certain logographic features, although they have marked phonetic features as well and are no longer in current use. Vietnamese speakers switched to the [[Vietnamese alphabet|Latin alphabet]] in the 20th century and the [[Hanja|use of Chinese characters in Korean]] is increasingly rare. The [[Japanese writing system]] includes several distinct forms of writing including logography.

=== Syllabic systems: syllabary ===
{{main article|Syllabary}}
[[File:Cherokee stop sign.png|thumb|[[Bilingual]] stop sign in English and the [[Cherokee syllabary]], [[Tahlequah, Oklahoma]]]]

''Another type of writing system with systematic syllabic linear symbols, the [[abugida]]s, is discussed below as well.

As logographic writing systems use a single symbol for an entire word, a ''syllabary'' is a set of written symbols that represent (or approximate) [[syllable]]s, which make up [[word]]s. A symbol in a syllabary typically represents a [[consonant]] sound followed by a [[vowel]] sound, or just a vowel alone.

In a "true syllabary", there is no systematic graphic similarity between phonetically related characters (though some do have graphic similarity for the vowels). That is, the characters for {{IPA|/ke/}}, {{IPA|/ka/}} and {{IPA|/ko/}} have no similarity to indicate their common "k" sound (voiceless velar plosive). More recent creations such as the [[Cree syllabary]] embody a system of varying signs, which can best be seen when arranging the syllabogram set in an [[Syllable onset|onset]]–[[Syllable coda|coda]] or onset–[[Syllable rime|rime]] table.

Syllabaries are best suited to languages with relatively simple syllable structure, such as Japanese. The [[English language]], on the other hand, allows complex syllable structures, with a relatively large inventory of [[vowel]]s and complex [[consonant cluster]]s, making it cumbersome to write English words with a syllabary. To write English using a syllabary, every possible syllable in English would have to have a separate symbol, and whereas the number of possible syllables in Japanese is around 100, in English there are approximately 15,000 to 16,000.

However, syllabaries with much larger inventories do exist. The [[Yi script]], for example, contains 756 different symbols (or 1,164, if symbols with a particular tone diacritic are counted as separate syllables, as in [[Unicode]]). The [[Chinese script]], when used to write [[Middle Chinese]] and the modern [[varieties of Chinese]], also represents syllables, and includes separate glyphs for nearly all of the many thousands of syllables in [[Middle Chinese]]; however, because it primarily represents [[morpheme]]s and includes different characters to represent homophonous morphemes with different meanings, it is normally considered a logographic script rather than a syllabary.

Other languages that use true syllabaries include [[Mycenae]]an [[Greek language|Greek]] ([[Linear B]]) and [[Indigenous languages of the Americas]] such as [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]]. Several languages of the [[Ancient Near East]] used forms of [[cuneiform (script)|cuneiform]], which is a syllabary with some non-syllabic elements.

=== Segmental systems: Alphabets ===
{{main article|Alphabet}}

An ''alphabet'' is a small set of ''letters'' (basic written symbols), each of which roughly represents or represented historically a [[phoneme]] of a spoken [[language]]. The word ''alphabet'' is derived from [[alpha (letter)|alpha]] and [[beta (letter)|beta]], the first two symbols of the [[Greek alphabet]].

The first type of alphabet that was developed was the [[abjad]]. An abjad is an alphabetic writing system where there is one symbol per consonant. Abjads differ from other alphabets in that they have characters only for [[consonant]]al sounds. Vowels are not usually marked in abjads.

All known abjads (except maybe [[Tifinagh]]) belong to the Semitic family of scripts, and derive from the original [[Middle Bronze Age alphabets|Northern Linear Abjad]]. The reason for this is that [[Semitic languages]] and the related [[Berber languages]] have a [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphemic structure]] which makes the denotation of [[vowel]]s redundant in most cases.

Some abjads, like Arabic and Hebrew, have markings for vowels as well. However, they use them only in special contexts, such as for teaching. Many scripts derived from abjads have been extended with vowel symbols to become full alphabets. Of these, the most famous example is the derivation of the [[Greek alphabet]] from the Phoenician abjad. This has mostly happened when the script was adapted to a non-Semitic language.

The term ''abjad'' takes its name from the old order of the [[Arabic alphabet]]'s [[consonant]]s 'alif, bā', jīm, dāl, though the word may have earlier roots in [[Phoenician languages|Phoenician]] or [[Ugaritic]]. "Abjad" is still the word for alphabet in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], Malay and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]].

[[File:Bible printed with Balinese script.jpg|thumb|A Bible printed with [[Balinese script]]]]
An [[abugida]] is an alphabetic writing system whose basic signs denote consonants with an [[inherent vowel]] and where consistent modifications of the basic sign indicate other following vowels than the inherent one.

Thus, in an abugida there may or may not be a sign for "k" with no vowel, but also one for "ka" (if "a" is the inherent vowel), and "ke" is written by modifying the "ka" sign in a way that is consistent with how one would modify "la" to get "le". In many abugidas the modification is the addition of a vowel sign, but other possibilities are imaginable (and used), such as rotation of the basic sign, addition of [[Diacritic|diacritical marks]] and so on.

The contrast with "true [[syllabary|syllabaries]]" is that the latter have one distinct symbol per possible syllable, and the signs for each syllable have no systematic graphic similarity. The graphic similarity of most abugidas comes from the fact that they are derived from abjads, and the consonants make up the symbols with the inherent vowel and the new vowel symbols are markings added on to the base symbol.

In the [[Ge'ez script]], for which the linguistic term ''abugida'' was named, the vowel modifications do not always appear systematic, although they originally were more so. [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics]] can be considered abugidas, although they are rarely thought of in those terms. The largest single group of abugidas is the [[Brahmic family]] of scripts, however, which includes nearly all the scripts used in [[India]] and [[Southeast Asia]].

The name ''abugida'' is derived from the first four characters of an order of the Ge'ez script used in some contexts. It was borrowed from Ethiopian languages as a linguistic term by [[Peter T. Daniels]].

=== Featural systems ===
{{main article|Featural writing system}}
A ''featural'' script represents finer detail than an alphabet. Here symbols do not represent whole phonemes, but rather the elements (features) that make up the phonemes, such as [[voice (phonetics)|voicing]] or its [[place of articulation]]. Theoretically, each feature could be written with a separate letter; and abjads or abugidas, or indeed syllabaries, could be featural, but the only prominent system of this sort is [[Korean language|Korean]] [[hangul]]. In hangul, the featural symbols are combined into alphabetic letters, and these letters are in turn joined into syllabic blocks, so that the system combines three levels of phonological representation.

Many scholars, e.g. [[John DeFrancis]], reject this class or at least labeling hangul as such.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The Korean script is a conscious script creation by literate experts, which Daniels calls a "sophisticated [[grammatogeny]]".{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} These include [[stenography|stenographies]] and [[constructed script]]s of hobbyists and fiction writers (such as [[Tengwar]]), many of which feature advanced graphic designs corresponding to phonologic properties. The basic unit of writing in these systems can map to anything from phonemes to words. It has been shown that even the Latin script has sub-character "features".&lt;ref&gt;See {{citation |first=Beatrice |last=Primus |title=A featural analysis of the Modern Roman Alphabet |journal=Written Language and Literacy |volume=7 |issue=2 |year=2004 |pages=235–274 |url=http://idsl1.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/fileadmin/IDSLI/dozentenseiten/artikel_primus/Primus_Featural_Analysis_2004.pdf |accessdate=2015-12-05}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ambiguous systems ===

Most writing systems are not purely one type. The English writing system, for example, includes numerals and other logograms such as #, $, and &amp;, and the [[written language]] often does not match well with the spoken one. As mentioned above, all logographic systems have phonetic components as well, whether along the lines of a syllabary, such as Chinese ("logo-syllabic"), or an abjad, as in Egyptian ("logo-consonantal").

Some scripts, however, are truly ambiguous. The [[semi-syllabary|semi-syllabaries]] of ancient Spain were syllabic for [[plosive consonant|plosives]] such as ''p'', ''t'', ''k'', but alphabetic for other consonants. In some versions, vowels were written redundantly after syllabic letters, conforming to an alphabetic orthography. [[Old Persian cuneiform]] was similar. Of 23 consonants (including null), seven were fully syllabic, thirteen were purely alphabetic, and for the other three, there was one letter for /C''u''/ and another for both /C''a''/ and /C''i''/. However, all vowels were written overtly regardless; as in the Brahmic abugidas, the /C''a''/ letter was used for a bare consonant.

The [[zhuyin]] phonetic glossing script for Chinese divides syllables in two or three, but into [[syllable onset|onset]], [[Syllable medial|medial]], and [[syllable rime|rime]] rather than consonant and vowel. [[Pahawh Hmong]] is similar, but can be considered to divide syllables into either onset-rime or consonant-vowel (all consonant clusters and diphthongs are written with single letters); as the latter, it is equivalent to an abugida but with the roles of consonant and vowel reversed. Other scripts are intermediate between the categories of alphabet, abjad and abugida, so there may be disagreement on how they should be classified.

== Graphic classification ==

Perhaps the primary graphic distinction made in classifications is that of ''linearity''. Linear writing systems are those in which the characters are composed of lines, such as the [[Latin alphabet]] and [[Chinese character]]s. Chinese characters are considered linear whether they are written with a ball-point pen or a calligraphic brush, or cast in bronze. Similarly, [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] and [[Maya script|Maya glyphs]] were often painted in linear outline form, but in formal contexts they were carved in [[bas-relief]]. The earliest examples of writing are linear: the [[Cuneiform script|Sumerian script]] of c. 3300 BC was linear, though its [[cuneiform]] descendants were not. Non-linear systems, on the other hand, such as [[braille]], are not composed of lines, no matter what instrument is used to write them.

[[Cuneiform]] was probably the earliest non-linear writing. Its glyphs were formed by pressing the end of a reed stylus into moist clay, not by tracing lines in the clay with the stylus as had been done previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cuneiform.neocities.org/CWT/CWT.html|title=Cuneiform Writing Techniques|last=Cammarosano|first=Michele|website=cuneiform.neocities.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cammarosano|first=Michele|date=2014|title=The Cuneiform Stylus|url=https://www.academia.edu/12047738/The_Cuneiform_Stylus|journal=Mesopotamia|language=en|volume=XLIX|pages=53-90|via=https://osf.io/dfng4/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a radical transformation of the appearance of the script.

Braille is a non-linear adaptation of the Latin alphabet that completely abandoned the Latin forms. The letters are composed of raised bumps on the writing [[Substrate (printing)|substrate]], which can be leather ([[Louis Braille]]'s original material), stiff paper, plastic or metal.

There are also transient non-linear adaptations of the Latin alphabet, including [[Morse code]], the [[manual alphabet]]s of various [[sign language]]s, and semaphore, in which [[Flag semaphore|flags]] or [[Semaphore line|bars]] are positioned at prescribed angles. However, if "writing" is defined as a potentially permanent means of recording information, then these systems do not qualify as writing at all, since the symbols disappear as soon as they are used. (Instead, these transient systems serve as [[Signaling (telecommunications)|signals]].)

== Directionality ==
[[File:Writing directions of the world.svg|thumb|Overview of the writing directions used in the world]]
{{see also|Right-to-left|Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|Bi-directional text|Mirror writing}}

Scripts are also graphically characterized by the direction in which they are written. Egyptian hieroglyphs were written either left to right or right to left, with the animal and human glyphs turned to face the beginning of the line. The early alphabet could be written in multiple directions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Threatte, Leslie |title=The grammar of Attic inscriptions |publisher=W. de Gruyter |year=1980 |pages=54–55 |isbn=3-11-007344-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; horizontally (side to side), or vertically (up or down). Prior to standardization, alphabetical writing was done both left-to-right (LTR or sinistrodextrally) and right-to-left (RTL or dextrosinistrally). It was most commonly written [[boustrophedon]]ically: starting in one (horizontal) direction, then turning at the end of the line and reversing direction.

The [[Greek alphabet]] and its successors settled on a left-to-right pattern, from the top to the bottom of the page. Other scripts, such as [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], came to be written right-to-left. Scripts that incorporate [[Chinese characters]] have traditionally been written vertically (top-to-bottom), from the right to the left of the page, but nowadays are frequently written left-to-right, top-to-bottom, due to [[Western culture|Western]] influence, a growing need to accommodate terms in the [[Latin script]], and technical limitations in popular [[electronic document]] formats. Chinese characters sometimes, as in signage, especially when signifying something old or traditional, may also be written from right to left. The [[Old Uyghur alphabet]] and its descendants are unique in being written top-to-bottom, left-to-right; this direction originated from an ancestral Semitic direction by rotating the page 90° [[Clockwise and counterclockwise|counter-clockwise]] to conform to the appearance of vertical Chinese writing. Several scripts used in the [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippines]] and [[Indonesia]], such as [[Hanunó'o script|Hanunó'o]], are traditionally written with lines moving away from the writer, from bottom to top, but are read horizontally left to right; however, [[Kulitan script|Kulitan]], another Philippine script, is written top to bottom and right to left. [[Ogham]] is written bottom to top and read vertically, commonly on the corner of a stone.

== On computers ==

In computers and telecommunication systems, writing systems are generally not codified as such,{{clarify|date=June 2016}} but graphemes and other grapheme-like units that are required for text processing are represented by "[[character (computing)|characters]]" that typically manifest in [[character encoding|encoded]] form. There are many [[:Category:Character encoding|character encoding standards and related technologies]], such as [[ISO/IEC 8859-1]] (a character repertoire and encoding scheme oriented toward the Latin script), [[CJK characters|CJK]] (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) and [[bi-directional text]]. Today, many such standards are re-defined in a collective standard, the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 10646 "[[Universal Character Set]]", and a parallel, closely related expanded work, ''The Unicode Standard''. Both are generally encompassed by the term [[Unicode]]. In Unicode, each character, in every language's writing system, is (simplifying slightly) given a unique identification number, known as its ''code point''. Computer [[operating system]]s use code points to look up characters in the [[Typeface|font]] file, so the characters can be displayed on the page or screen.

A [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] is the device most commonly used for writing via computer. Each key is associated with a standard code which the keyboard sends to the computer when it is pressed. By using a combination of alphabetic keys with [[modifier key]]s such as [[Control key|Ctrl]], [[Alt key|Alt]], [[Shift key|Shift]] and [[AltGr key|AltGr]],&lt;!-- this is not meant to be an exhaustive list! --&gt; various character codes are generated and sent to the [[CPU]]. The [[operating system]] intercepts and converts those signals to the appropriate characters based on the [[keyboard layout]] and [[Input method editor|input method]], and then delivers those converted codes and characters to the running [[application software]], which in turn looks up the appropriate [[glyph]] in the currently used font file, and requests the operating system to draw these on the [[Computer display|screen]].
