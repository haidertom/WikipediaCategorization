[[Image:JO200109337.png|thumb|The Law as published in the ''[[Journal Officiel de la République Française]]'']]

The 2001 '''About-Picard law''' [abu pika:r] (named after French parliament members [[Nicolas About]] and [[Catherine Picard]]), a controversial piece of [[France|French]] legislation, broadly speaking, makes it possible to act against organisations (legal entities) when such organisations have become involved in certain crimes. The law, in its own words, aimed at movements deemed cultic (''mouvements sectaires'') that "undermine human rights and fundamental freedoms".  The law has caused controversy internationally, with some commentators alleging that it infringes [[religious freedom]] while proponents content it reinforces religious freedom.

==Background on Government and Religion in France ==
:{{Main|Status of religious freedom in France}}

[[Freedom of religion]] and [[separation of church and state]] have formed part of the French idea of the state since at least the [[French Revolution]] and in some ways long before, since the 16th century period of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and of the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]]. Separation of religion and state in France takes the form of ''[[laïcité]]'', by which political power avoids interference in the sphere of religious dogma, and religion avoids interference in public policies. The French understand "freedom of religion" primarily as the freedom of the individual to believe or not to believe what any religion teaches. Also, because of a long history of one single dominating church (the [[Catholic Church]]), the French state sees its duty less in protecting religion from state interference than in protecting the individual from interference by religion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

In the wake of the [[Order of the Solar Temple]] murders and suicides, the [[French National Assembly|French Parliament]] established the [[Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France]] to investigate cults. In December 1995 the Commission delivered a report on cults which caused much controversy, some of it due to a list extracted from a report by the [[French National Police]] on purported cults.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/rap-enq/r2468.asp
&lt;/ref&gt; (The Commission assimilated information and analysis from the French police secret service, the [[Direction centrale des renseignements généraux|Renseignements généraux]].)

Following the recommendations of the report, Prime Minister [[Alain Juppé]] set up in 1996 the "Interministerial board of observation of sects", followed in 1998 by the "Interministerial Mission in the Fight Against Sects" ([[Mission interministérielle de lutte contre les sectes|MILS]]). In 2002 the "Interministerial Monitoring Mission Against Sectarian Abuses" ([[MIVILUDES]]) replaced MILS.

Other action of the French government against potential abuses by cults resulted in the passing of the About-Picard law.

== The About-Picard law==

Commentators often refer to the Law 2001-504 of June 12, 2001&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=JUSX9903887L    &lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021114222634/http://religionandpolicy.org/show.php?p=1.1.105 approximate translation into English]&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as the About-Picard law, from the name of its ''[[rapporteur]]s'' (parliamentarians who report upon the draft law), [[French Senate|senator]] [[Nicolas About]] ([[Union pour la Démocratie Française|UDF]] center-right party)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.senat.fr/rap/l99-131/l99-131.html
&lt;/ref&gt; and [[French National Assembly|deputy]] [[Catherine Picard]] ([[French Socialist Party|PS]] center-left party).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nat.fr/rapports/r2472.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050208022636/http://www.assemblee-nat.fr/rapports/r2472.asp |archivedate=2005-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French parliament adopted the law with broad cross-party support under the government of center-right president [[Jacques Chirac]] and socialist prime minister [[Lionel Jospin]].

'''Article 223-15-2 of Penal code:'''&lt;br /&gt;(Act no. 2001-504 of 12 June 2001, article 10 Official Journal of 13 June 2001 ; Ordinance No. 2000-916 of 19 September 2000, article 3 Official Journal of 22 September 2000, into force 1 January 2002) 
       
« Fraudulently abusing the ignorance or state of weakness of a minor, or of a person whose particular vulnerability, due to age, sickness, infirmity, to a physical or psychological disability or to pregnancy, is apparent or known to the offender, or abusing a person in a state of physical or psychological dependency resulting from serious or repeated pressure or from techniques used to affect his judgement, in order to induce the minor or other person to act or abstain from acting in any way seriously harmful to him, is punished by three years' imprisonment and a fine of € 375,000.
Where the offence is committed by the legal or de facto manager of a group that carries out activities the aim or effect of which is to create, maintain or exploit the psychological or physical dependency of those who participate in them, the penalty is increased to five years' imprisonment and to a fine of € 750,000. »

The additional penalties that natural or legal persons may incur are mentioned in the following articles 223-15-3 and 4.

===Main points ===
Notable new points introduced by the law include:
* In the case of certain crimes, the law extends legal responsibility from individuals to organizations (corporations, associations, and other [[Juristic person|legal entities]]...).
* Courts can order the dissolution of organizations if they or their executives have been found guilty of these crimes.
 
The initial draft of the About-Picard law included the criminalization of "mental manipulation". Many organizations criticised this clause for its vagueness.  [[Minister of Justice (France)|Minister of Justice]] [[Élisabeth Guigou]] pushed for the removal of this clause, which the legislators excluded from the final version of the law. However, the law makes it a crime to defraud a person weakened by illness, old age, etc., but also of a person in a state of ''psychological or physical subjection resulting from grave or reiterated pressures or techniques able to alter judgement''.

=== Application of the law ===
There was one famous application of the law since its adoption: that of [[Arnaud Mussy]], leader of the tiny ''Néo-Phare'' (New Lighthouse) cult. Mussy, who claims that he is the [[Christ]], had announced imminent [[apocalypse]], resulting in the suicide of one of his followers and the attempted suicides of two others, who were severely wounded in 2001. The criminal court in Nantes sentenced him to three years in prison and 90,000 [[French Franc|FF]] damages in November 2004. It ruled that he had "abused fraudulently the state of ignorance and weakness of several persons in the state of bodily or mental dependence".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prevensectes.com/rev0506.htm#6a&lt;/ref&gt; A higher court in Rennes confirmed the sentence in July 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prevensectes.com/rev0507.htm#12
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of the Law ==
:''See [[Status of religious freedom in France]] for expressed concerns about other aspects of French policies with respect to minority religions.''

The French government, when challenged on issues of religious discrimination, states that it has no concern in any way with religious doctrine ''per se''. The government has taken the position that it will deal with the concrete consequences of cult affiliation, especially with respect to children. The government sees this as particularly important in the light of past abuse committed in some criminal cults, such as [[sexual slavery]] and [[mass suicide]].  According to government sources, none of the criteria listed in related government documents on sects discuss [[theology]]; they only focus on the actions and the methods of the groups.

Critics of the law see this as merely a semantic change &lt;!-- change from what? --&gt; and maintain that no empirical studies support claims of the use of techniques of coercive persuasion by NRMs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theology.homestead.com/Papers.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions inside France ===
{{See also|Status of religious freedom in France#Complaints by minority religions and groups|l1=Status of religious freedom in France: Complaints by minority religions}}

The [[Bishop of Soissons]], [[Marcel Herriot]], defended the law on 25 June 2000 asserting it was necessary to protect by law persons, family, society and religions themselves from sects that are violating fundamental freedoms and human dignity.

Some groups claim that the Parliamentary Reports and the controversy surrounding the About-Picard law have created an unhealthy atmosphere, resulting in minority religious groups suffering from excessively strict, uneven, or even abusive discrimination in the application of other laws by local authorities. For example, the group ''Coordination des Associations et Particuliers pour la Liberté de Conscience'' (Co-ordination of Associations and Individuals for Freedom of Conscience) requested the repeal of the law, asserting laws should not specify groups as "sectarian" or "cultic" as, in a democracy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coordiap.com/Gtemo01.htm&lt;/ref&gt; However, an [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] report has described this group as a partisan &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc05/EDOC10470.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051219055614/http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc05/EDOC10470.htm |archivedate=2005-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The umbrella association of French [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] sued the French government in the [[European Court of Human Rights|ECHR]] in case #53430/99, alleging that the publication of the parliamentary reports and the enactment of the About-Picard law infringed its civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=671525&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=1132746FF1FE2A468ACCBCD1763D4D8149&lt;/ref&gt; The court rejected the application.

In other cases (#53934/00), the Court affirmed that the publication of a Parliamentary Report disparaging to some groups did not constitute an infringement of human rights, even though these groups were not given a [[legal recourse]] for the removal of their name from the report.&lt;ref&gt;http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=682416&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=1132746FF1FE2A468ACCBCD1763D4D8149
&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights activists dubbed the law "un délit d'opinion" (a thought crime).&lt;ref&gt;The New Heretics of France: Minority Religions, la Republique, and the Government-Sponsored "War on Sects" Susan J. Palmer 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Statements by the Council of Europe ===

Forty different religious and human-rights groups submitted a petition to the [[Council of Europe]]'s Parliamentary Assembly. This petition led to a report (Report 9612 of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights of Europe) containing an expert paper by Swiss professor Joseph Voyame, who concluded:
:''"On the basis of the foregoing, I conclude that the French Law of 12 June 2001 is not incompatible with the Council of Europe’s values."''
Voyame deduces that the law clearly responds to a need, that the measure of dissolution appears radical, but also effective and reliable, and that judicial guarantees surround it. He also discusses the title with its mentioning of "cultic groups", but comes to the conclusion that the uncertainty regarding the definition has little importance:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The title is undeniably part of the [Act], but has no legislative authority in itself. Although it may be useful for the purposes of interpretation, it cannot be used in making a ruling that runs counter to a clear legal provision [...] As we will see, [Sections] 1, 19 and 20 of this [Act] identify the targeted incorporated organizations and groups with the greatest possible precision. It is these standard-setting texts that are decisive.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The report discussed several objections regarding the word "secte" (cult):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
... the word ‘sect’ has taken on an extremely pejorative connotation. In the eyes of the public, it stigmatises movements whose activities are dangerous either for their members or for society. Today, the world contains dozens, perhaps even hundreds, of groups both large and small, all with various beliefs and observances, which are not necessarily dangerous or prejudicial to freedom. It is true that among these groups are some which have committed criminal acts. Nevertheless, the existence of a few dangerous movements is not enough to condemn all the rest (...)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The report concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The act for the most part simply reiterates existing provisions in the Criminal Code, the Code of Consumption, the Code of Public Health and the New Code of Civil Procedure and does so for a precise purpose in conformity with the European Convention on Human Rights, as we have just seen. Consequently, even if it had been possible to achieve the same objective by recourse to existing provisions, there is nothing to prevent the passing of an act which has the advantage of grouping together all the provisions necessary to achieve that objective.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In November 2002, the Council of Europe passed a resolution inviting the Government of France to reconsider the About-Picard Law and to clarify certain terms in the law. It referred, however, to the Recommendation 1412 (1999) on the illegal activities of sects, where it had concluded that it was ''"essential to ensure that the activities of groups, whatever religious, esoteric or spiritual description they adopted, were in keeping with the principles of democratic societies and, in particular, the provisions of Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)."'' and it stated that ''"ultimately, should the case arise, it will be for the [[European Court of Human Rights]], and it alone, to say whether or not this law is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights."'' .

=== Reactions outside of France===
In an open letter dated June 2000 to Alain Vivien about religious freedom in France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |df= 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aaron Rhodes]], Executive Director of the [[International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights]] (IHFHR), wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We question ourselves how such a law can claim to guarantee human rights when it goes against the rights of association, expression, religion and conscience; when it puts in danger the right of minorities and maintains prejudices that are so incompatible with the concept of tolerance intrinsic to that of human rights. France must deal with its responsibilities and obligations as a signatory for the International Conventions and respect the European laws and its interpretation by the Court of Strasbourg, before one of its citizens become a victim of discrimination due to the law which you propose.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Alain Vivien responded: "[The IHFHR] seems today to have passed into the hands of [[Scientology|Scientologists]] and perhaps other transnational organizations". [[Aaron Rhodes]] then acknowledged that the Moscow office of the IHFHR had received funding from the [[Church of Scientology]] to print a leaflet about religious freedom in Russia, and voiced his astonishment at the charge. Rhodes voiced his embarrassment: "[...]for you and your fellow French citizens by your recourse to methods of denunciations and insinuations that remind us of those sometimes used by totalitarian and backward regimes."{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

====Reaction of the government of the United States of America ====
Some groups sought the help of their governments to fight what they saw as religious intolerance in France.&lt;ref&gt;http://bahai-library.com/newspapers/2000/090500-4.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The New Heretics of France: Minority Religions, la Republique, and the Government-Sponsored "War on Sects" Susan J. Palmer 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, the [[Church of Scientology]] utilised pressure groups against the French government, and had some success with the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] administration, which repeatedly brought the matter before the French government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antisectes.net/monde-usa.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303193106/http://www.antisectes.net/monde-usa.htm |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to pastor [[Jean-Arnold de Clermont]], head of the French Protestant federation and himself a strong critic of the first draft of the law, the complaints originating in the United States concerning religious freedom in France were largely based on biased, poor information.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apologeticsindex.org/news1/an010521-20.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a newspaper article published in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in June 2000,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,3604,331743,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; the French government considered American interference regarding religious freedom in France as unwarranted meddling by the US government in France's internal affairs. Paul Webster wrote that President [[Jacques Chirac]] told Clinton that religious freedom would no longer be a subject for bilateral presidential talks, "in the light of what has been officially described as 'shocking' White House support for [[Church of Scientology|Scientologists]] and [[Unification Church|Moonies]]". The French government also described the  [[United States Congress]]'s introduction of laws protecting religious freedom internationally as "an unacceptable intrusion into internal affairs". [[Alain Vivien]], former chairman of the French ministerial mission to combat the influence of cults (MILS), and the president of the ''Centre Contre les Manipulations Mentales'' (Centre Against Mental Manipulation), said many observers believed that Clinton was making his peace with big religious movements, "because they offer an indispensable source of [[campaign finance|political financing]]", and that with the help of Scientologists, cults were infiltrating UN and European human rights associations and collaborating on virulent reports against France's policies.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,3604,331743,00.html "France to crack down on sects"], by Paul Webster; Wednesday June 14, 2000. Retrieved 2007-01-01.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The French did not alter their law following these requests; and the claims and actions of the US government regarding the religious situation in France largely ceased with the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration.

Some critics of French legislation have voiced concerns that countries which do not have the same legal safeguards and constitutional rights as France may emulate this legislation. In the words of a US official:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/rm/14258.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-06-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116064332/http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/rm/14258.htm |archive-date=2009-01-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Yet the law itself remains problematic not only because of the threat the language carries in France, but because it is even now being considered for emulation by countries that lack France’s commitment to [[rule of law]] and human rights. Such a model serves only too well as cover for those nations who persecute under the guise of law enforcement.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 15 September 2006 the United States [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] released a report on religious freedom in France.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71380.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This report noted that "The constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respected this right in practice." It reported mostly anonymous concerns over repression of religious freedom in France, notably in regards to what the report referred to in one case as "cult groups", as well as the law banning religious symbols in schools, and rising anti-semitism in France.

The '''Agasha Temple of Wisdom''' is a [[spiritualism|spiritualist]] group founded in 1943 by [[Richard Zenor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=James|title=The Encyclopedia of Cults, Sects, and New Religions|date=1998|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=1573922226|page=32|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=oVQUAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the publication of [[James Crenshaw]]'s book ''Telephone Between Two Worlds'' in 1950, in which both Zenor and the temple were prominently featured, the temple became more popular. Upon Zenor's death in 1978, Geary Salvat was chosen to lead the group.

Geary Salvat is a follower of both Richard Zenor and of Ayuibbi Tobabu, and he has written a journal of quotes, ''Getting Into Gear''. He died in 2002.

The group focuses on communicating with the dead through [[mediumship|mediums]], placing particular attention on receiving and studying the teachings of "master teachers" such as Zenor's "Agasha".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malony|first1=H.

'''Agricultural spiritualism''' or the '''Spirit of Agriculture''' refers to the idea that the concepts of [[food]] [[production (economics)|production]] and [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] and the essential [[spiritualism|spiritual]] nature of [[human race|humanity]] are linked. It assumes that spirituality is inherent to human [[consciousness]], is perhaps a product of it, and is accessible to all who cultivate it. The association with [[agriculture]] includes such agricultural [[metaphor]]s as "cultivate" in language used by most [[mysticism|mystics]] across history.

Followers of this idea state the following reasons to justify this link:
*Agriculture was the preoccupation of the majority of the [[population]] of the world at the time that the major [[scripture]]s of the continuing [[religion]]s were compiled.
*The approach that agriculture takes to creating the optimal conditions for production of its [[harvest]] is the same as that recommended by the traditional religions for producing insight or wisdom.
*Historically, the adoption of agriculture liberated part of a population to focus on understanding of spirituality.

  Please note:
    The consensus since April 2007 has been to include all three of the definitions of atheism presented in the first paragraph below. They are the result of extensive debate and searches through existing sources – see, for example, the archived talkpage threads [[Talk:Atheism/Archive 27#A survey of definitions for atheism]] and [[Talk:Atheism/Archive 29#List of definitions]] – and formed part of the article when it achieved "Featured Article" status.

    Please, therefore, do not change the contents of the first paragraph without prior discussion on the talk page ([[Talk:Atheism]]), preferably after consulting at least these two threads. If you do make changes to the paragraph without prior discussion, be prepared to see them reverted as an invitation to discussion on the talk page (see [[Wikipedia:BRD]]).

'''Atheism''' is, in the broadest sense, the absence of [[belief]] in the existence of [[Deity|deities]].&lt;ref name="encyc-unbelief-def-issues" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oxdicphil" /&gt;&lt;ref name="religioustolerance" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/atheism |encyclopedia=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]] |title=Atheism |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |accessdate=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less broadly, atheism is the rejection of belief that any deities exist.&lt;ref name="eb2011-atheism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="encyc-philosophy" /&gt;  In an even narrower sense, atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities.&lt;ref name="encyc-unbelief-def-issues" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oxdicphil" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RoweRoutledge" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atheism-agnosticism/#1

The etymological root for the word ''atheism'' originated before the 5th century BCE from the ancient Greek {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:ἄθεος|ἄθεος]]}} (''atheos''), meaning "without god(s)". In antiquity it had multiple uses as a pejorative term applied to those thought to reject the gods worshiped by the larger society,&lt;ref name="drachmann" /&gt; those who were forsaken by the gods or those who had no commitment to belief in the gods.&lt;ref name="Battling Whitmarsh" /&gt; The term denoted a social category created by orthodox religionists into which those who did not share their religious beliefs were placed.&lt;ref name="Battling Whitmarsh"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whitmarsh|first1=Tim|title=Battling the Gods: Atheism in the Ancient World|publisher=Knopf Doubleday|isbn=978-0-307-94877-9 |chapter=8.

New Histories of Atheism}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the spread of [[freethought]], [[skeptical inquiry]], and subsequent increase in [[criticism of religion]], application of the term narrowed in scope. The [[List of atheist philosophers|first individuals]] to identify themselves using the word ''atheist'' lived in the 18th century during the [[Age of Enlightenment]].{{sfn|Armstrong|1999}}&lt;ref name="Hunter ch 1" /&gt; The [[French Revolution]], noted for its "unprecedented atheism," witnessed the first major political movement in history to advocate for the supremacy of human [[reason]].&lt;ref name="HancockLambert"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hancock |first=Ralph |title=The Legacy of the French Revolution |year=1996 |publisher=Rowman and Littlefield Publishers |location=Lanham, United States |isbn=978-0-847-67842-6 |page=22 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPgQy3VJ3iIC |accessdate=2015-05-30}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=uPgQy3VJ3iIC&amp;pg=PA22 Extract of page 22]&lt;/ref&gt; The French Revolution can be described as the first period where atheism became implemented politically.

Arguments for atheism range from the philosophical to social and historical approaches. Rationales for not believing in deities include arguments that there is a lack of [[Existence of God#Empirical arguments|empirical evidence]],&lt;ref name="logical" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://shook.pragmatism.org/skepticismaboutthesupernatural.pdf |title=Skepticism about the Supernatural |last=Shook |first=John R. |accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[problem of evil]], the [[argument from inconsistent revelations]], the rejection of concepts that cannot [[Falsifiability|be falsified]], and the [[argument from nonbelief]].&lt;ref name="logical" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Drange-1996" /&gt; Nonbelievers contend that atheism is a more [[parsimonious]] position than theism and that everyone is born without beliefs in deities;&lt;ref name="encyc-unbelief-def-issues" /&gt; therefore, they argue that the [[Philosophic burden of proof|burden of proof]] lies not on the atheist to disprove the existence of gods but on the theist to provide a rationale for theism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stenger|2007|pp=17–18}}, citing {{cite book |last=Parsons |first=Keith M. |title=God and the Burden of Proof: Plantinga, Swinburne, and the Analytical Defense of Theism |year=1989 |location=Amherst, New York |publisher=Prometheus Books |isbn=978-0-879-75551-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some atheists have adopted [[Secularism|secular]] philosophies (e.g. [[secular humanism]]),&lt;ref name="honderich" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fales |first=Evan |title=Naturalism and Physicalism |postscript=,}} in {{harvnb|Martin|2006|pp=122–131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; there is no one ideology or set of behaviors to which all atheists adhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|pp=3–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers disagree on how best to define and classify ''atheism'',&lt;ref name="eb1911-atheism" /&gt; contesting what supernatural entities are considered gods, whether it is a philosophic position in its own right or merely the absence of one, and whether it requires a conscious, explicit rejection. Atheism has been regarded as compatible with [[agnosticism]],&lt;ref name="agnosticism-compatible" /&gt;&lt;ref name="flint-agnostic-atheism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="encyc-unbelief-compatible" /&gt;&lt;ref name="martin-agnosticism-entails" /&gt;&lt;ref name="barker-agnostic-atheism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="besant-open-to-new-truth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="holyoake-question-of-probability" /&gt; and has also been contrasted with it.&lt;ref name="eb2011-atheism-critique" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eb2011concise-atheism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eb1911-atheism-sceptical" /&gt; A variety of categories have been used to distinguish the different forms of atheism.

=== Range ===
Some of the ambiguity and controversy involved in defining ''atheism'' arises from difficulty in reaching a consensus for the definitions of words like ''deity'' and ''god''. The plurality of wildly different [[conceptions of God]] and deities leads to differing ideas regarding atheism's applicability. The ancient Romans accused Christians of being atheists for not worshiping the [[paganism|pagan]] deities. Gradually, this view fell into disfavor as ''theism'' came to be understood as encompassing belief in any divinity.{{sfn|Martin|2006}}

With respect to the range of phenomena being rejected, atheism may counter anything from the existence of a deity, to the existence of any [[spirituality|spiritual]], [[supernatural]], or [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] concepts, such as those of [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Taoism]].&lt;ref name="eb2011-Rejection-of-all-religious-beliefs" /&gt;

=== Implicit vs. explicit ===
{{Main|Implicit and explicit atheism}}
Definitions of atheism also vary in the degree of consideration a person must put to the idea of gods to be considered an atheist. Atheism has sometimes been defined to include the simple absence of belief that any deities exist. This broad definition would include newborns and other people who have not been exposed to theistic ideas. As far back as 1772, [[Baron d'Holbach]] said that "All children are born Atheists; they have no idea of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=d'Holbach |first=P. H. T. |authorlink=Baron d'Holbach |title=Good Sense |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7319 |year=1772 |accessdate=2011-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, [[George H. Smith]] (1979) suggested that: "The man who is unacquainted with theism is an atheist because he does not believe in a god. This category would also include the child with the conceptual capacity to grasp the issues involved, but who is still unaware of those issues. The fact that this child does not believe in god qualifies him as an atheist."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1979|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Implicit atheism'' is "the absence of theistic belief without a conscious rejection of it" and ''explicit atheism'' is the conscious rejection of belief.
For the purposes of his paper on "philosophical atheism", [[Ernest Nagel]] contested including mere absence of theistic belief as a type of atheism.&lt;ref name= Nagel1959&gt;{{cite book

Thus, a child who has received no religious instruction and has never heard about God, is not an atheist – for he is not denying any theistic claims. Similarly in the case of an adult who, if he has withdrawn from the faith of his father without reflection or because of frank indifference to any theological issue, is also not an atheist – for such an adult is not challenging theism and not professing any views on the subject. &amp;nbsp;...

&lt;br /&gt;reprinted in ''Critiques of God'', edited by Peter A. Angeles, Prometheus Books, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Graham Oppy]] classifies as ''innocents'' those who never considered the question because they lack any understanding of what a god is. According to Oppy, these could be [[Infant cognitive development|one-month-old babies]], humans with severe traumatic [[Brain injury|brain injuries]], or patients with [[dementia|advanced dementia]].{{sfn|Oppy|2018|p=4|ps=:Agnostics are distinguished from innocents, who also neither believe that there are gods nor believe that there are no gods, by the fact that they have given consideration to the question whether there are gods. Innocents are those who have never considered the question whether there are gods. Typically, innocents have never considered the question whether there are gods because they are not able to consider that question. How could that be? Well, in order to consider the question whether there are gods, one must understand what it would mean for something to be a god. That is, one needs to have the concept of a god. Those who lack the concept of a god are not able to entertain the thought that there are gods. Consider, for example, one-month-old babies. It is very plausible that one-month-old babies lack the concept of a god. So it is very plausible that one-month-old babies are innocents. Other plausible cases of innocents include chimpanzees, human beings who have suffered severe traumatic brain injuries, and human beings with advanced dementia}}

=== Positive vs. negative ===
{{Main|Negative and positive atheism}}
Philosophers such as [[Antony Flew]]&lt;ref name="presumption"&gt;{{harvnb|Flew|1976|pp=14ff}}: "In this interpretation an atheist becomes: not someone who positively asserts the non-existence of God; but someone who is simply not a theist. Let us, for future ready reference, introduce the labels 'positive atheist' for the former and 'negative atheist' for the latter."&lt;/ref&gt;
and [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]]{{sfn|Martin|2006}} have contrasted positive (strong/hard) atheism with negative (weak/soft) atheism. Positive atheism is the explicit affirmation that gods do not exist. Negative atheism includes all other forms of non-theism. According to this categorization, anyone who is not a theist is either a negative or a positive atheist.
The terms ''weak'' and ''strong'' are relatively recent, while the terms ''negative'' and ''positive'' atheism are of older origin, having been used (in slightly different ways) in the philosophical literature&lt;ref name="presumption" /&gt; and in Catholic apologetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/jm3303.htm |title=On the Meaning of Contemporary Atheism |journal=The Review of Politics |first=Jacques |last=Maritain |date=July 1949 |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=267–280 |doi=10.1017/S0034670500044168 |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051113062053/http://www.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/jm3303.htm |archivedate=13 November 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Under this demarcation of atheism, most agnostics qualify as negative atheists.

While Martin, for example, asserts that agnosticism [[logical consequence|entails]] negative atheism,&lt;ref name="martin-agnosticism-entails" /&gt; many agnostics see their view as distinct from atheism,&lt;ref name=Kenny2006 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/omar-baddar/why-im-not-an-atheist-the-case-for-agnosticism_b_3345544.html | title=Why I'm Not an Atheist: The Case for Agnosticism |date=28 May 2013 |publisher=Huffington Post |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
which they may consider no more justified than theism or requiring an equal conviction.&lt;ref name=Kenny2006&gt;{{cite book |first=Anthony |last=Kenny |authorlink=Anthony Kenny |title=What I believe |chapter=Why I Am Not an Atheist |publisher=Continuum |isbn=978-0-82648971-5 |quote=The true default position is neither theism nor atheism, but agnosticism&amp;nbsp;... a claim to knowledge needs to be substantiated; ignorance need only be confessed. |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The assertion of unattainability of knowledge for or against the existence of gods is sometimes seen as an indication that atheism requires a [[leap of faith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Many atheists I know would be certain of a high place in heaven |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2009/0725/1224251303564.html |last=O'Brien |first=Breda |authorlink=Breda O'Brien |work=Irish Times |accessdate=2011-04-09 |date=7 July 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520132651/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2009/0725/1224251303564.html |archivedate=20 May 2011  |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Warner |first=Matthew |url=http://www.ncregister.com/blog/matthew-warner/more-faith-to-be-an-atheist-than-a-christian |title=More faith to be an atheist than a Christian |date=8 June 2012 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Common atheist responses to this argument include that unproven ''[[faith#Faith in world religions|religious]]'' propositions deserve as much disbelief as all ''other'' unproven propositions,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|pp=30–34}}. "Who seriously claims we should say 'I neither believe nor disbelieve that the Pope is a robot', or 'As to whether or not eating this piece of chocolate will turn me into an elephant I am completely agnostic'. In the absence of any good reasons to believe these outlandish claims, we rightly disbelieve them, we don't just suspend judgement."&lt;/ref&gt;
and that the unprovability of a god's existence does not imply equal probability of either possibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|p=22}}. "A lack of proof is no grounds for the suspension of belief. This is because when we have a lack of absolute proof we can still have overwhelming evidence or one explanation which is far superior to the alternatives."&lt;/ref&gt;
Australian philosopher [[J. J. C. Smart]] even argues that "sometimes a person who is really an atheist may describe herself, even passionately, as an agnostic because of unreasonable generalized [[philosophical skepticism]] which would preclude us from saying that we know anything whatever, except perhaps the truths of mathematics and formal logic."&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atheism-agnosticism/ |title=Atheism and Agnosticism |first=J.C.C. |last=Smart |date=9 March 2004 |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Consequently, some atheist authors such as [[Richard Dawkins]] prefer distinguishing theist, agnostic and atheist positions along a [[spectrum of theistic probability]]—the likelihood that each assigns to the statement "God exists".{{sfn|Dawkins|2006|p=50}}

=== Definition as impossible or impermanent ===
Before the 18th century, the existence of God was so accepted in the western world that even the possibility of true atheism was questioned. This is called ''theistic [[innatism]]''—the notion that all people believe in God from birth; within this view was the connotation that atheists are simply in denial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cudworth |first=Ralph |authorlink=Ralph Cudworth |title=The True Intellectual System of the Universe: the first part, wherein all the reason and philosophy of atheism is confuted and its impossibility demonstrated |year=1678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a position claiming that atheists are quick to believe in God in times of crisis, that atheists make [[deathbed conversion]]s, or that "there are no [[atheists in foxholes]]".&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: {{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/features/ohair090896.htm |title=Atheist Group Moves Ahead Without O'Hair |first=Sue Anne |last=Pressley |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=8 September 1996 |accessdate=2014-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There have however been examples to the contrary, among them examples of literal "atheists in foxholes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lowder |first=Jeffery Jay |year=1997 |title=Atheism and Society |url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/jeff_lowder/society.html |accessdate=2011-04-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522025011/http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/jeff_lowder/society.html |archivedate=22 May 2011  |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some atheists have doubted the very need for the term "atheism". In his book ''[[Letter to a Christian Nation]]'', [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In fact, "atheism" is a term that should not even exist. No one ever needs to identify himself as a "non-[[Astrology|astrologer]]" or a "non-[[Alchemy|alchemist]]". We do not have words for people who doubt that Elvis is still alive or that aliens have traversed the galaxy only to molest ranchers and their cattle. Atheism is nothing more than the noises reasonable people make in the presence of unjustified religious beliefs.{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=ypyMZlkgHGIC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=%22No+one+ever+needs+to+identify+himself+as+a+%22non-astrologer%22%22or+a%22%22non-alchemist%22 51]}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Pragmatic atheism===
Pragmatic atheism is the view one should reject a belief in a god or gods because it is unnecessary for a [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] life. This view is related to [[apatheism]] and [[practical atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://atheism.about.com/od/Atheist-Dictionary/g/Definition-Pragmatic-Atheist.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arguments ==
[[File:D'Holbach.jpg|thumb|[[Baron d'Holbach|Paul Henri Thiry, Baron d'Holbach]], an 18th-century advocate of atheism.
&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
"The source of man's unhappiness is his ignorance of Nature. The pertinacity with which he clings to blind opinions imbibed in his infancy, which interweave themselves with his existence, the consequent prejudice that warps his mind, that prevents its expansion, that renders him the slave of fiction, appears to doom him to continual error."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Henri Thiry, Baron d'Holbach, ''System of Nature; or, the Laws of the Moral and Physical World'' (London, 1797), Vol. 1, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Epistemological arguments ===
{{Further|Agnostic atheism|Theological noncognitivism}}
Atheists have also argued that people cannot know a God or prove the existence of a God.  The latter is called agnosticism, which takes a variety of forms. In the philosophy of [[immanence]], divinity is inseparable from the world itself, including a person's mind, and each person's [[consciousness]] is locked in the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]]. According to this form of agnosticism, this limitation in perspective prevents any objective inference from belief in a god to assertions of its existence. The [[Rationalism|rationalistic]] agnosticism of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] only accepts knowledge deduced with human rationality; this form of atheism holds that gods are not discernible as a matter of principle, and therefore cannot be known to exist. [[Skepticism]], based on the ideas of [[David Hume|Hume]], asserts that certainty about anything is impossible, so one can never know for sure whether or not a god exists. Hume, however, held that such unobservable metaphysical concepts should be rejected as "sophistry and illusion".&lt;ref name="hume-metaphysics" /&gt; The allocation of agnosticism to atheism is disputed; it can also be regarded as an independent, basic worldview.&lt;ref name="Zdybicka-p20"&gt;{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other arguments for atheism that can be classified as epistemological or [[ontology|ontological]], including  [[ignosticism]], assert the meaninglessness or unintelligibility of basic terms such as "God" and statements such as "God is all-powerful." [[Theological noncognitivism]] holds that the statement "God exists" does not express a proposition, but is nonsensical or cognitively meaningless. It has been argued both ways as to whether such individuals can be classified into some form of atheism or agnosticism. Philosophers [[Alfred Ayer|A. J. Ayer]] and [[Theodore M. Drange]] reject both categories, stating that both camps accept "God exists" as a proposition; they instead place noncognitivism in its own category.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodore Drange|Drange, Theodore M.]] (1998). "[http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/definition.html Atheism, Agnosticism, Noncognitivism]". [[Internet Infidels]], ''Secular Web Library''. Retrieved 2007-APR-07.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Ayer|Ayer, A. J.]] (1946). ''Language, Truth and Logic''. Dover. pp. 115–116. In a footnote, Ayer attributes this view to "Professor H. H. Price".&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metaphysical arguments ===
{{Further|Monism|Physicalism}}
Philosopher, [[Zofia Zdybicka]] writes:
{{quote|"Metaphysical atheism&amp;nbsp;... includes all doctrines that hold to metaphysical monism (the homogeneity of reality). Metaphysical atheism may be either: a) absolute — an explicit denial of God's existence associated with materialistic monism (all materialistic trends, both in ancient and modern times); b) relative — the implicit denial of God in all philosophies that, while they accept the existence of an absolute, conceive of the absolute as not possessing any of the attributes proper to God: transcendence, a personal character or unity. Relative atheism is associated with idealistic monism (pantheism, panentheism, deism)."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Epikouros BM 1843.jpg|thumb|left|[[Epicurus]] is credited with first expounding the [[problem of evil]]. [[David Hume]] in his ''[[Dialogues concerning Natural Religion]]'' (1779) cited Epicurus in stating the argument as a series of questions:{{sfn|Hume|1779}}
"Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is impotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?"]]

=== Logical arguments ===
{{further|Existence of God#Arguments against the existence of God|l1=Arguments against the existence of God|Problem of evil|Argument from nonbelief|l3=Divine hiddenness}}
Some atheists hold the view that the various [[conceptions of God|conceptions of gods]], such as the [[personal god]] of Christianity, are ascribed logically inconsistent qualities. Such atheists present [[existence of God#Deductive arguments|deductive arguments]] against the existence of God, which assert the incompatibility between certain traits, such as perfection, creator-status, [[immutability (theology)|immutability]], [[omniscience]], [[omnipresence]], [[omnipotence]], [[omnibenevolence]], [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]], personhood (a personal being), nonphysicality, [[justice]], and [[mercy]].&lt;ref name=logical&gt;{{cite web |author=Various authors |url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/nontheism/atheism/logical.html |title=Logical Arguments for Atheism |publisher=[[Internet Infidels]] |website=The Secular Web Library |accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodicy|Theodicean]] atheists believe that the world as they experience it cannot be reconciled with the qualities commonly ascribed to God and gods by theologians. They argue that an [[omniscience|omniscient]], [[omnipotence|omnipotent]], and [[omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] God is not compatible with a world where there is [[problem of evil|evil]] and [[suffering]], and where divine love is [[Divine hiddenness|hidden]] from many people.&lt;ref name="Drange-1996"&gt;{{cite web |first=Theodore M. |last=Drange |authorlink=Theodore Drange |year=1996 |url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/aeanb.html |title=The Arguments From Evil and Nonbelief |publisher=[[Internet Infidels]] |website=Secular Web Library |accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A similar argument is attributed to [[Siddhartha Gautama]], the founder of [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;V.A. Gunasekara, {{cite web |url=http://www.buddhistinformation.com/buddhist_attitude_to_god.htm |title=The Buddhist Attitude to God |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102053643/http://www.buddhistinformation.com/buddhist_attitude_to_god.htm |archivedate=2 January 2008}} In the Bhuridatta Jataka, "The Buddha argues that the three most commonly given attributes of God, viz. omnipotence, omniscience and benevolence towards humanity cannot all be mutually compatible with the existential fact of dukkha."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reductionary accounts of religion ===
{{Further|Evolutionary origin of religions|Evolutionary psychology of religion|Psychology of religion}}
Philosopher [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]]&lt;ref&gt;Feuerbach, Ludwig (1841) ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
and psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] have argued that God and other religious beliefs are human inventions, created to fulfill various psychological and emotional wants or needs. This is also a view of many [[Buddhism|Buddhists]].&lt;ref&gt;Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught.'' Grove Press, 1974. Pages 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], influenced by the work of Feuerbach, argued that belief in God and religion are social functions, used by those in power to oppress the working class. According to [[Mikhail Bakunin]], "the idea of God implies the abdication of human reason and justice; it is the most decisive negation of human liberty, and necessarily ends in the enslavement of mankind, in theory and practice." He reversed [[Voltaire]]'s famous aphorism that if God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him, writing instead that "if God really existed, it would be necessary to abolish him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/bakunin/godandstate/godandstate_ch1.html |title=God and the State |last=Bakunin |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Bakunin |year=1916 |website= |publisher=New York: Mother Earth Publishing Association |accessdate=2011-04-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521195435/http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bakunin/godandstate/godandstate_ch1.html |archivedate=21 May 2011  |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Apophatic theology]] is often assessed as being a version of atheism or agnosticism, since it cannot say truly that God exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Kvanvig |editor-first=Jonathan |editor-link=Jonathan Kvanvig |year=2015 |chapter=7.

== Atheistic philosophies ==
{{Further|Atheist existentialism|Secular humanism}}
[[Axiology|Axiological]], or constructive, atheism rejects the existence of gods in favor of a "higher absolute", such as [[Human nature|humanity]]. This form of atheism favors humanity as the absolute source of ethics and values, and permits individuals to resolve moral problems without resorting to God. Marx and Freud used this argument to convey messages of liberation, full-development, and unfettered happiness.&lt;ref name="Zdybicka-p20" /&gt; One of the most common [[criticism of atheism|criticisms of atheism]] has been to the contrary: that denying the existence of a god either leads to [[moral relativism]] and leaves one with no moral or ethical foundation,&lt;ref name="misconceptions"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.exchristian.net/2006/12/common-misconceptions-about-atheists.html |title=Common Misconceptions About Atheists and Atheism |last=Gleeson |first=David |date=10 August 2006 |accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; or renders life [[meaning of life (religious)|meaningless]] and miserable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1979|p=275}}. "Perhaps the most common criticism of atheism is the claim that it leads inevitably to [[moral bankruptcy]]."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blaise Pascal]] argued this view in his ''[[Pensées]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Blaise Pascal|Pascal, Blaise]] (1669). ''[[Pensées]]'', II: "The Misery of Man Without God".&lt;/ref&gt;

French philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] identified himself as a representative of an "[[atheist existentialism]]"{{sfn|Sartre|2004|p=127}}
concerned less with denying the existence of God than with establishing that "man needs&amp;nbsp;... to find himself again and to understand that nothing can save him from himself, not even a valid proof of the existence of God."{{sfn|Sartre|2001|p=45}}
Sartre said a corollary of his atheism was that "if God does not exist, there is at least one being in whom existence precedes essence, a being who exists before he can be defined by any concept, and&amp;nbsp;... this being is man."{{sfn|Sartre|2004|p=127}}
The practical consequence of this atheism was described by Sartre as meaning that there are no ''a priori rules'' or absolute values that can be invoked to govern human conduct, and that humans are "condemned" to invent these for themselves, making "man" absolutely "responsible for everything he does".{{sfn|Sartre|2001|p=32}}

=== Association with world views and social behaviors ===
Sociologist [[Phil Zuckerman]] analyzed previous social science research on secularity and non-belief, and concluded that societal well-being is positively correlated with irreligion. He found that there are much lower concentrations of atheism and secularity in poorer, less developed nations (particularly in Africa and South America) than in the richer industrialized democracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Norris |first=Pippa |first2=Ronald |last2=Inglehart |year=2004 |title=Sacred and Secular: Religion and Politics Worldwide |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Steve |year=2003 |title=Religion and Politics |location=Cambridge, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His findings relating specifically to atheism in the US were that compared to religious people in the US, "atheists and secular people" are less [[Nationalism|nationalistic]], prejudiced, [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]], [[Racism|racist]], dogmatic, [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]], closed-minded, and authoritarian, and in US states with the highest percentages of atheists, the murder rate is lower than average.

=== Irreligion ===
[[File:Lightmatter buddha3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Buddhism]] is sometimes described as nontheistic because of [[God in Buddhism|the absence]] of a [[creator god]], but that can be too simplistic a view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wallace |first=B.

People who self-identify as atheists are often assumed to be [[irreligion|irreligious]], but some sects within major religions reject the existence of a personal, [[creator deity]].&lt;ref name="winston2"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Winston |editor-first=Robert |title=Human |publisher=New York: DK Publishing, Inc |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-75661901-5 |page=299 |quote=Nonbelief has existed for centuries.

The strictest sense of positive atheism does not entail any specific beliefs outside of disbelief in any deity; as such, atheists can hold any number of spiritual beliefs. For the same reason, atheists can hold a wide variety of ethical beliefs, ranging from the [[moral universalism]] of [[humanism]], which holds that a moral code should be applied consistently to all humans, to [[moral nihilism]], which holds that morality is meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1979|pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atheism is accepted as a valid philosophical position within some varieties of [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Chakravarti| first = Sitansu| title = Hinduism, a way of life| publisher = Motilal Banarsidass Publ.| year = 1991| page = 71| url = https://books.google.com/?id=J_-rASTgw8wC&amp;pg=PA71| isbn = 978-81-208-0899-7|quote = According to Hinduism, the path of the atheist is very difficult to follow in matters of spirituality, though it is a valid one. |accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophers such as [[Slavoj Žižek]],&lt;ref&gt;Slavoj Žižek: Less Than Nothing (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alain de Botton]],&lt;ref&gt;Alain de Botton: [[Religion for Atheists]] (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alexander Bard]] and [[Jan Söderqvist]],&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Bard and Jan Söderqvist: The Global Empire (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; have all argued that atheists should reclaim religion as an act of defiance against theism, precisely not to leave religion as an unwarranted monopoly to theists.

=== Divine command ===
According to Plato's [[Euthyphro dilemma]], the role of the gods in determining right from wrong is either unnecessary or arbitrary. [[Divine command theory|The argument that morality must be derived from God]], and cannot exist without a wise creator, has been a persistent feature of political if not so much philosophical debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1979|p=275}}. "Among the many myths associated with religion, none is more widespread -{{sic}}or more disastrous in its effects—than the myth that moral values cannot be divorced from the belief in a god."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In [[Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' (Book Eleven: ''Brother Ivan Fyodorovich'', Chapter 4) there is the famous argument that ''If there is no God, all things are permitted.'': "'But what will become of men then?' I asked him, 'without God and immortal life? All things are lawful then, they can do what they like?'"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kant CPR A811"&gt;For [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], the presupposition of God, soul, and freedom was a practical concern, for "Morality, by itself, constitutes a system, but happiness does not, unless it is distributed in exact proportion to morality. This, however, is possible in an intelligible world only under a wise author and ruler. Reason compels us to admit such a ruler, together with life in such a world, which we must consider as future life, or else all moral laws are to be considered as idle dreams&amp;nbsp;..." (''Critique of Pure Reason'', A811).&lt;/ref&gt;
Moral precepts such as "murder is wrong" are seen as [[divine law]]s, requiring a divine lawmaker and judge. However, many atheists argue that treating morality legalistically involves a [[false analogy]], and that morality does not depend on a lawmaker in the same way that laws do.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] believed in a morality independent of theistic belief, and stated that morality based upon God "has truth only if God is truth—it stands or falls with faith in God."&lt;ref name="Fortin &amp; Benestad"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=19ccmx1W58IC&amp;pg=PA16|title =Human Rights, Virtue, and the Common Good|publisher = [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|quote=That problem was brought home to us with dazzling clarity by Nietzsche, who had reflected more deeply than any of his contemporaries on the implications of godlessness and come to the conclusion that a fatal contradiction lay at the heart of modern theological enterprise: it thought that Christian morality, which it wished to preserve, was independent of Christian dogma, which it rejected. This, in Nietzsche's mind, was an absurdity. It amounted to nothing less than dismissing the architect while trying to keep the building or getting rid of the lawgiver while claiming the protection of the law. | accessdate=2011-04-09|isbn = 978-0-8476-8279-9|year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Craig &amp; Moreland"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=g8bHRrVu3SsC&amp;pg=PA392|title =The Blackwell Companion to Natural Theology|publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell]]|quote=Morality "has truth only if God is truth–it stands or falls with faith in God" (Nietzsche 1968, p. 70).

There exist [[Normative ethics|normative ethical systems]] that do not require principles and rules to be given by a deity. Some include [[virtue ethics]], [[social contract]], [[Kantian ethics]], [[utilitarianism]], and [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]]. [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] has proposed that moral prescription (ethical rule making) is not just an issue to be explored by philosophy, but that we can meaningfully practice a [[science of morality]]. Any such scientific system must, nevertheless, respond to the criticism embodied in the [[naturalistic fallacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Principia Ethica |url=http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica/s.13 |year=1903 |first=G.

and [[Julian Baggini]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(among others) assert that behaving ethically only because of divine mandate is not true ethical behavior but merely blind obedience. Baggini argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics, claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves—to be able to discern, for example, that "thou shalt steal" is immoral even if one's religion instructs it—and that atheists, therefore, have the advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The contemporary British political philosopher [[Martin Cohen (philosopher)|Martin Cohen]] has offered the more historically telling example of Biblical injunctions in favor of torture and slavery as evidence of how religious injunctions follow political and social customs, rather than vice versa, but also noted that the same tendency seems to be true of supposedly dispassionate and objective philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;101 Ethical Dilemmas, 2nd edition, by Cohen, M., Routledge 2007, pp&amp;nbsp;184–5. (Cohen notes particularly that Plato and Aristotle produced arguments in favour of slavery.)&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen extends this argument in more detail in ''Political Philosophy from Plato to Mao'', where he argues that the [[Qur'an]] played a role in perpetuating social codes from the early 7th century despite changes in secular society.&lt;ref&gt;Political Philosophy from Plato to Mao, by Cohen, M, Second edition 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Karl Marx.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Karl Marx]]]]

The 19th-century German political theorist and sociologist Karl Marx called religion "the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the [[opium of the people]]". He goes on to say, "The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions. The criticism of religion is, therefore, in embryo, the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo."&lt;ref&gt;Marx, K. 1976. Introduction to A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right. Collected Works, v. 3. New York.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] said that "every religious idea and every idea of God is unutterable vileness&amp;nbsp;... of the most dangerous kind, 'contagion' of the most abominable kind.

== Etymology ==
[[File:Ephesians 2,12 - Greek atheos.jpg|thumb|left|The Greek word {{lang|grc|αθεοι}} (''atheoi''), as it appears in the [[Epistle to the Ephesians]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Ephesians|2:12}}) on the early 3rd-century [[Papyrus 46]]. It is usually translated into English as "[those who are] without God".&lt;ref&gt;The word {{lang|grc|αθεοι}}—in any of its forms—appears nowhere else in the [[Septuagint]] or the [[New Testament]]. {{cite book |last=Robertson |first=A.T. |title=Word Pictures in the New Testament |origyear=1932 |year=1960 |publisher=Broadman Press |chapter=Ephesians: Chapter 2 |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/r/robertson_at/wordpictures/htm/EPH2.RWP.html |quote=Old Greek word, not in LXX, only here in N.T.

In early [[ancient Greek]], the adjective ''{{Transl|grc|átheos}}'' ({{lang|grc|[[:wikt:ἄθεος|ἄθεος]]}}, from the [[privative a|privative ἀ-]] + {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:θεός|θεός]]}} "god") meant "godless". It was first used as a term of censure roughly meaning "ungodly" or "impious". In the 5th century BCE, the word began to indicate more deliberate and active godlessness in the sense of "severing relations with the gods" or "denying the gods". The term [[:wikt:ἀσεβής|ἀσεβής]] (''{{Transl|grc|asebēs}}'') then came to be applied against those who impiously denied or disrespected the local gods, even if they believed in other gods. Modern translations of classical texts sometimes render ''{{Transl|grc|átheos}}'' as "atheistic". As an abstract noun, there was also {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:ἀθεότης|ἀθεότης]]}} (''{{Transl|grc|atheotēs}}''), "atheism". [[Cicero]] transliterated the Greek word into the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|[[:wikt:atheos#Latin|átheos]]}}''.

Cudworth, Ralph. The true intellectual system of the universe. 1678. Chapter V Section II p.73&lt;/ref&gt;
At that time "deist" and "deism" already carried their modern meaning. The term ''theism'' came to be contrasted with deism.

[[Karen Armstrong]] writes that "During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the word 'atheist' was still reserved exclusively for [[polemic]]&amp;nbsp;... The term 'atheist' was an insult. Nobody would have dreamed of calling ''himself'' an atheist."{{sfn|Armstrong|1999}}

''Atheism'' was first used to describe a self-avowed belief in late 18th-century Europe, specifically denoting disbelief in the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[Abrahamic god]].&lt;ref name="adevism"&gt;In part because of its wide use in monotheistic Western society, ''atheism'' is usually described as "disbelief in God", rather than more generally as "disbelief in deities". A clear distinction is rarely drawn in modern writings between these two definitions, but some archaic uses of ''atheism'' encompassed only disbelief in the singular God, not in [[polytheism|polytheistic]] deities. It is on this basis that the obsolete term ''[[adevism]]'' was coined in the late 19th century to describe an absence of belief in plural deities.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 20th century, [[globalization]] contributed to the expansion of the term to refer to disbelief in all deities, though it remains common in Western society to describe atheism as simply "disbelief in God".{{sfn|Martin|2006}}

{{Main|History of atheism}}
While the earliest-found usage of the term ''atheism'' is in 16th-century [[France]],&lt;ref name="mw-online"&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/atheism | title=Merriam-Webster Online:Atheism | quote=First Known Use: 1546 | accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Golding /&gt; ideas that would be recognized today as atheistic are documented from the [[Vedic period]] and the [[classical antiquity]].

=== Early Indic religion ===
{{Main|Atheism in Hinduism}}
Atheistic schools are found in early Indian thought and have existed from the times of the [[historical Vedic religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pandian |title=India, that is, sidd |publisher=Allied Publishers |year=1996 |page=64 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=B90uj14NHjMC&amp;pg=PA64 |isbn=978-8-170-23561-3 |accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Among the six [[Astika and Nastika|orthodox]] schools of Hindu philosophy, [[Samkhya]], the oldest philosophical school of thought, does not accept God, and the early [[Mimamsa]] also rejected the notion of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dasgupta |first=Surendranath |title=A history of Indian philosophy, Volume 1 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |year=1992 |page=258 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PoaMFmS1_lEC&amp;pg=PA258 |isbn=978-8-120-80412-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The thoroughly materialistic and anti-theistic philosophical [[Cārvāka]] (or ''Lokāyata'') school that originated in [[India]] around the 6th century BCE is probably the most explicitly atheistic school of philosophy in India, similar to the Greek [[Cyrenaic school]]. This branch of Indian philosophy is classified as [[nastika|heterodox]] due to its rejection of the authority of [[Vedas]] and hence is not considered part of the six orthodox schools of Hinduism, but it is noteworthy as evidence of a materialistic movement within Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Charles A. Moore. ''A Sourcebook in Indian Philosophy''. (Princeton University Press: 1957, Twelfth Princeton Paperback printing 1989) pp. 227–249. {{ISBN|0-69101958-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Chatterjee and Datta explain that our understanding of Cārvāka philosophy is fragmentary, based largely on criticism of the ideas by other schools, and that it is not a living tradition:&lt;ref&gt;Satischandra Chatterjee and Dhirendramohan Datta. ''An Introduction to Indian Philosophy''. Eighth Reprint Edition. (University of Calcutta: 1984). p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|Though [[materialism]] in some form or other has always been present in India, and occasional references are found in the Vedas, the Buddhistic literature, the Epics, as well as in the later philosophical works we do not find any systematic work on materialism, nor any organized school of followers as the other philosophical schools possess. But almost every work of the other schools states, for refutation, the materialistic views. Our knowledge of Indian materialism is chiefly based on these.}}

Other Indian philosophies generally regarded as atheistic include [[Samkhya|Classical Samkhya]] and [[Mimamsa|Purva Mimamsa]]. The rejection of a personal creator God is also seen in [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]] in India.&lt;ref name="Joshi"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Joshi |first=L.R. |year=1966 |title=A New Interpretation of Indian Atheism |journal=Philosophy East and West |volume=16 |issue=3/4 |pages=189–206 |doi=10.2307/1397540 |ref=harv |jstor=1397540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Early Middle Ages]], the [[Islamic world]] experienced a [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age]].  Along with advances in science and philosophy, Arab and Persian lands produced outspoken rationalists and atheists, including [[Muhammad al Warraq]] (fl. 9th century), [[Ibn al-Rawandi]] (827–911), [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi|Al-Razi]] (854–925), and [[Al-Maʿarri]] (973–1058).

Individuals and groups such as [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]], [[David of Dinant]], [[Amalric of Bena]], and the [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]] maintained Christian viewpoints with [[pantheism|pantheistic]] tendencies.  [[Nicholas of Cusa]] held to a form of [[fideism]] he called ''[[De Docta Ignorantia|docta ignorantia]]'' ("learned ignorance"), asserting that God is beyond human categorization, and thus our knowledge of him is limited to conjecture. [[William of Ockham]] inspired anti-metaphysical tendencies with his [[nominalism|nominalistic]] limitation of human knowledge to singular objects, and asserted that the divine [[essence]] could not be intuitively or rationally apprehended by human intellect. Followers of Ockham, such as [[John of Mirecourt]] and [[Nicholas of Autrecourt]] furthered this view. The resulting division between [[Faith and rationality|faith and reason]] influenced later radical and reformist theologians such as [[John Wycliffe]], [[Jan Hus]], and [[Martin Luther]].&lt;ref name="Zdybicka 2005 4" /&gt;

The [[Renaissance]] did much to expand the scope of free thought and skeptical inquiry. Individuals such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] sought experimentation as a means of explanation, and opposed [[Appeal to authority|arguments from religious authority]].  Other critics of religion and the Church during this time included [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Bonaventure des Périers]], [[Michel de Montaigne]], and [[François Rabelais]].&lt;ref name="gordonstein" /&gt;

=== Early modern period ===
Historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]] wrote that the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] had paved the way for atheists by attacking the authority of the Catholic Church, which in turn "quietly inspired other thinkers to attack the authority of the new Protestant churches".&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; p.388&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deism]] gained influence in France, Prussia, and England. The philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]] was "probably the first well known 'semi-atheist' to announce himself in a Christian land in the modern era", according to Blainey. Spinoza believed that natural laws explained the workings of the universe. In 1661 he published his ''Short Treatise on God''.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; p.343&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Criticism of Christianity]] became increasingly frequent in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and England, where there appears to have been a religious [[malaise]], according to contemporary sources. Some Protestant thinkers, such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], espoused a materialist philosophy and skepticism toward supernatural occurrences, while Spinoza rejected [[divine providence]] in favor of a [[panentheistic]] naturalism. By the late 17th century, deism came to be openly espoused by intellectuals such as [[John Toland (Irish Philosopher)|John Toland]] who coined the term "pantheist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pantheism |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known explicit atheist was the German critic of religion [[Matthias Knutzen]] in his three writings of 1674.&lt;ref&gt;Winfried Schröder, in: Matthias Knutzen: Schriften und Materialien (2010), p. 8. See also Rececca Moore, ''The Heritage of Western Humanism, Scepticism and Freethought'' (2011), calling Knutzen "the first open advocate of a modern atheist perspective" [http://reason.sdsu.edu/germany.html online here]&lt;/ref&gt; He was followed by two other explicit atheist writers, the Polish ex-Jesuit philosopher [[Kazimierz Łyszczyński]] and in the 1720s by the French priest [[Jean Meslier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nova.wpunj.edu/newpolitics/issue40/Onfray40.htm |title=Michel Onfray on Jean Meslier |publisher=William Paterson University |accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of the 18th century, other openly atheistic thinkers followed, such as [[Baron d'Holbach]], [[Jacques-André Naigeon]], and other [[French materialism|French materialists]].&lt;ref name="Holbach-SoN"&gt;{{cite book |last=d'Holbach |first=P. H. T. |authorlink=Baron d'Holbach |title=The System of Nature |url=http://fulltextarchive.com/page/The-System-of-Nature-Vol-21/ |accessdate=2011-04-07 |year=1770 |volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Locke]] in contrast, though an advocate of tolerance, urged authorities not to tolerate atheism, believing that the denial of God's existence would undermine the social order and lead to chaos.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeremy Waldron]]; ''God, Locke, and Equality: Christian Foundations in Locke's Political Thought''; Cambridge, UK; 2002; p.217&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[David Hume]] developed a skeptical epistemology grounded in [[empiricism]], and [[Immanuel Kant]]'s philosophy has strongly questioned the very possibility of a metaphysical knowledge. Both philosophers undermined the metaphysical basis of natural theology and criticized classical [[arguments for the existence of God]].

[[File:Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]]'s ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' (1841) would greatly influence philosophers such as [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[David Strauss]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], and [[Max Stirner]]. He considered God to be a human invention and religious activities to be wish-fulfillment. For this he is considered the founding father of modern [[anthropology of religion]].]]
Blainey notes that, although [[Voltaire]] is widely considered to have strongly contributed to atheistic thinking during the Revolution, he also considered fear of God to have discouraged further disorder, having said "If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him."&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; pp.&amp;nbsp;390–391&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790), the philosopher [[Edmund Burke]] denounced atheism, writing of a "literary cabal" who had "some years ago formed something like a regular plan for the destruction of the Christian religion. This object they pursued with a degree of zeal which hitherto had been discovered only in the propagators of some system of piety&amp;nbsp;... These atheistical fathers have a bigotry of their own&amp;nbsp;...".  But, Burke asserted, "man is by his constitution a religious animal" and "atheism is against, not only our reason, but our instincts; and&amp;nbsp;... it cannot prevail long".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/burke/edmund/reflections-on-the-revolution-in-france/|title=Reflections on the Revolution in France|website=adelaide.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Baron d'Holbach]] was a prominent figure in the [[French Enlightenment]] who is best known for his atheism and for his voluminous writings against religion, the most famous of them being ''[[The System of Nature]]'' (1770) but also ''[[Christianity Unveiled]]''. One goal of the [[French Revolution]] was a restructuring and subordination of the clergy with respect to the state through the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]]. Attempts to enforce it led to [[anticlericalism|anti-clerical]] violence and the expulsion of many clergy from France, lasting until the [[Thermidorian Reaction]]. The radical [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]] seized power in 1793, ushering in the [[Reign of Terror]]. The Jacobins were deists and introduced the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]] as a new French state religion. Some atheists surrounding [[Jacques Hébert]] instead sought to establish a [[Cult of Reason]], a form of atheistic pseudo-religion with a goddess personifying reason. The [[Napoleonic era]] further institutionalized the secularization of French society.

In the latter half of the 19th century, atheism rose to prominence under the influence of [[rationalism|rationalistic]] and [[freethought|freethinking]] philosophers. Many prominent German philosophers of this era denied the existence of deities and were critical of religion, including [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Max Stirner]], [[Karl Marx]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BKz2FcDrFy0C&amp;pg=PA1 |title=Subjectivity and Irreligion: Atheism and Agnosticism in Kant, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |last=Ray |first=Matthew Alun |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-754-63456-0 |accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Marxism and religion}}
Atheism, particularly in the form of practical atheism, advanced in many societies in the 20th century. Atheistic thought found recognition in a wide variety of other, broader philosophies, such as [[existentialism]], [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|objectivism]], [[secular humanism]], [[nihilism]], [[anarchism]], [[logical positivism]], [[Marxism]], [[feminism]],&lt;ref name=feminism&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tAeFipOVx4MC&amp;pg=PA233&amp;dq=%22Feminism+and+Atheism%22 |last=Overall |first=Christine |chapter=Feminism and Atheism |year=2006 |accessdate=2011-04-09 |title=The Cambridge Companion to Atheism |isbn=978-1-139-82739-3}} in {{harvnb|Martin|2006|pp=233–246}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the general scientific and [[rationalist movement]].

[[File:Honourable Bertrand Russell.jpg|thumb|upright|The British philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]]]]
Logical positivism and [[scientism]] paved the way for [[neopositivism]], [[analytical philosophy]], [[structuralism]], and [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]. Neopositivism and analytical philosophy discarded classical rationalism and metaphysics in favor of strict empiricism and epistemological [[nominalism]]. Proponents such as [[Bertrand Russell]] emphatically rejected belief in God. In his early work, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] attempted to separate metaphysical and supernatural language from rational discourse. [[A. J. Ayer]] asserted the unverifiability and meaninglessness of religious statements, citing his adherence to the empirical sciences. Relatedly the [[Structural anthropology|applied structuralism]] of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]] sourced religious language to the human subconscious in denying its transcendental meaning. [[John Niemeyer Findlay|J. N. Findlay]] and [[J. J. C. Smart]] argued that the existence of God is not logically necessary. Naturalists and materialistic monists such as [[John Dewey]] considered the natural world to be the basis of everything, denying the existence of God or immortality.&lt;ref name="stanford" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2010 Eurobarometer Poll, the percentage of those polled who agreed with the statement "you don't believe there is any sort of spirit, God or life force" varied from a high percentage in France (40%), Czech Republic (37%), Sweden (34%), Netherlands (30%), and Estonia (29%); medium-high percentage in Germany (27%), Belgium (27%), UK (25%); to very low in Poland (5%), Greece (4%), Cyprus (3%), Malta (2%), and Romania (1%), with the European Union as a whole at 20%.&lt;ref name="EU" /&gt; In a 2012 Eurobarometer poll on discrimination in the European Union, 16% of those polled considered themselves non believers/agnostics and 7% considered themselves atheists.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Discrimination in the EU in 2012 |work=[[Eurobarometer|Special Eurobarometer]] |year=2012 |series=383 |page=233 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_393_en.pdf |accessdate=14 August 2013 |publisher=[[European Commission]] |location=[[European Union]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202023700/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_393_en.pdf |archivedate=2 December 2012 |df= }} The question asked was "Do you consider yourself to be...?", with a card showing: Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, Other Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, Buddhist, Hindu, Atheist, and non-believer/agnostic.

According to a [[Pew Research Center]] survey in 2012 [[Irreligion|religiously unaffiliated]] (including agnostics and atheists) make up about 18% of Europeans.&lt;ref name="Religiously Unaffiliated"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/global-religious-landscape-unaffiliated.aspx|title=Religiously Unaffiliated|date=18 December 2012|website=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the same survey, the religiously unaffiliated are the majority of the population only in two European countries: Czech Republic (75%) and Estonia (60%).&lt;ref name="Religiously Unaffiliated" /&gt;

===Asia===
There are another four countries where the unaffiliated make up a majority of the population: [[Irreligion in North Korea|North Korea]] (71%), [[Religion in Japan#Thoughts and movements against organised religion|Japan]] (57%), Hong Kong (56%), and China (52%).&lt;ref name="Religiously Unaffiliated" /&gt;

===Australasia===
According to the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]], 30% of Australians have "no religion", a category that includes atheists.&lt;ref name="abs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/mediareleasesbyReleaseDate/7E65A144540551D7CA258148000E2B85?OpenDocument |title=Religion In Australia |date=27 June 2017 |publisher=[[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] |accessdate=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

According to the [[World Values Survey]], 4.4% of Americans self-identified as atheists in 2014.&lt;ref name="WVS"&gt;{{cite web|title=WVS Database|url=http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSOnline.jsp|website=World Values Survey|publisher=Institute for Comparative Survey Research|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same survey showed that 11.1% of all respondents stated "no" when asked if they believed in God.&lt;ref name="WVS"/&gt; In 1984, these same figures were 1.1% and 2.2%, respectively. According to a 2014 report by the Pew Research Center, 3.1% of the US adult population identify as atheist, up from 1.6% in 2007; and within the religiously unaffiliated (or "no religion") demographic, atheists made up 13.6%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/americas-changing-religious-landscape/ America’s Changing Religious Landscape], Pew Research Center, 12 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2015 General Sociological Survey the number of atheists and agnostics in the US has remained relatively flat in the past 23 years since in 1991 only 2% identified as atheist and 4% identified as agnostic and in 2014 only 3% identified as atheists and 5% identified as agnostics.&lt;ref name="GSS 2014"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hout |first1=Michael |last2=Smith |first2=Tom |title=Fewer Americans Affiliate with Organized Religions, Belief and Practice Unchanged: Key Findings from the 2014 General Social Survey |url=http://www.norc.org/PDFs/GSS%20Reports/GSS_Religion_2014.pdf |website=General Social Survey |publisher=NORC |date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arab world ===
In recent years, the profile of atheism has risen substantially in the Arab world.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/4898/the-rise-of-arab-atheism |title=The rise of Arab atheism|accessdate=2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In major cities across the region, such as [[Cairo]], atheists have been organizing in cafés and social media, despite regular crackdowns from authoritarian governments.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; A 2012 poll by Gallup International revealed that 5% of Saudis considered themselves to be "convinced atheists."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; However, very few young people in the Arab world have atheists in their circle of friends or acquaintances. According to one study, less than 1% did in Morocco, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, or Jordan; only 3% to 7% in the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Palestine.&lt;ref name = "Tabah2016"&gt;[http://mmgsurvey.tabahfoundation.org/downloads/mmgsurvey_full_En_web.pdf Muslim Millennial Attitudes on Religion and Religious Leadership, Arab World], Tabah Foundation, Abu Dhabi, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; When asked whether they have "seen or heard traces of atheism in [their] locality, community, and society" only about 3% to 8% responded yes in all the countries surveyed. The only exception was the UAE, with a percentage of 51%.&lt;ref name = "Tabah2016"/&gt;

===Wealth and education===

A study noted positive correlations between levels of education and secularism, including atheism, in America.&lt;ref name="Zuckerman" /&gt; According to evolutionary psychologist Nigel Barber, atheism blossoms in places where most people feel economically secure, particularly in the [[Social democracy|social democracies]] of Europe, as there is less uncertainty about the future with extensive social safety nets and better health care resulting in a greater quality of life and higher life expectancy. By contrast, in underdeveloped countries, there are virtually no atheists.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Barber (2010). [http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-human-beast/201005/why-atheism-will-replace-religion Why Atheism Will Replace Religion]. [[Psychology Today]]. Retrieved 2013-05-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2008 study, researchers found intelligence to be negatively related to religious belief in Europe and the United States. In a sample of 137 countries, the correlation between national IQ and disbelief in God was found to be 0.60.&lt;ref name="intmag"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lynn |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Lynn |last2=Harvey |first2=John |last3=Nyborg |first3=Helmuth |title=Average intelligence predicts atheism rates across 137 nations |journal=[[Intelligence (journal)|Intelligence]] |year=2009 |volume=37 |pages=11–15 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289608000238 |doi=10.1016/j.intell.2008.03.004 |accessdate=2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary psychologist Nigel Barber states that the reason atheists are more intelligent than religious people is better explained by social, environmental, and wealth factors which happen to correlate with loss of religious belief as well. He doubts that religion causes stupidity, noting that some highly intelligent people have also been religious, but he says it is plausible that higher intelligence correlates to rejection of improbable religious beliefs and that the situation between intelligence and rejection of religious beliefs is quite complex.&lt;ref name="Nigel atheists"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barber|first1=Nigel|title=The Real Reason Atheists Have Higher IQs: Is Atheism a Sign of Intelligence?|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-human-beast/201005/the-real-reason-atheists-have-higher-iqs|publisher=Psychology Today|date=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2017 study, it was shown that compared to religious individuals, atheists have higher reasoning capacities and this difference seemed to be unrelated to sociodemographic factors  such as age, education and country of origin.&lt;ref name="Daws"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Daws|first1=Richard E.|last2=Hampshire|first2=Adam|title=The Negative Relationship between Reasoning and Religiosity Is Underpinned by a Bias for Intuitive Responses Specifically When Intuition and Logic Are in Conflict|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|date=19 December 2017|volume=8|pages=2191|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02191|pmid=29312057|pmc=5742220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attitudes toward atheism===

Statistically, atheists are held in poor regard across the globe. Non-atheists, and possibly even fellow atheists, seem to implicitly view atheists as prone to exhibit immoral behaviors ranging from mass murder to not paying at a restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carey|first1=Benedict|title=The Serial Killer Test: Biases Against Atheists Emerge in Study|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/07/health/atheists-religion-study.html|accessdate=2018-01-23|work=The New York Times|date=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Paris|first1=Agence France-Presse in|title=Atheists tend to be seen as immoral – even by other atheists: study|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/07/anti-atheist-prejudice-secularity|accessdate=2018-01-23|work=the Guardian|date=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gervais|first1=Will M.|last2=Xygalatas|first2=Dimitris|last3=McKay|first3=Ryan T.|last4=van Elk|first4=Michiel|last5=Buchtel|first5=Emma E.|last6=Aveyard|first6=Mark|last7=Schiavone|first7=Sarah R.|last8=Dar-Nimrod|first8=Ilan|last9=Svedholm-Häkkinen|first9=Annika M.|last10=Riekki|first10=Tapani|last11=Klocová|first11=Eva Kundtová|last12=Ramsay|first12=Jonathan E.|last13=Bulbulia|first13=Joseph|title=Global evidence of extreme intuitive moral prejudice against atheists|journal=Nature Human Behaviour|date=7 August 2017|volume=1|issue=8|pages=0151|doi=10.1038/s41562-017-0151|url=http://psyarxiv.com/csnp2/|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, according to a 2016 [[Pew Research Center]] publication, 15% of French people, 45% of Americans, and 99% of Indonesians explicitly believe that a person must believe in God to be moral. Pew furthermore noted that, in a U.S. poll, atheists and Muslims tied for the lowest rating among the major religious demographics on a "feeling thermometer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10 facts about atheists|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/06/01/10-facts-about-atheists/|website=Pew Research Center|accessdate=2018-01-23|date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first takes the privative ''a'' both before the Greek ''theos'' (divinity) and ''gnosis'' (to know) to mean that atheism is simply the absence of belief in the gods and agnosticism is simply lack of knowledge of some specified subject matter. The second definition takes atheism to mean the explicit denial of the existence of gods and agnosticism as the position of someone who, because the existence of gods is unknowable, suspends judgment regarding them&amp;nbsp;... The first is the more inclusive and recognizes only two alternatives: Either one believes in the gods or one does not. Consequently, there is no third alternative, as those who call themselves agnostics sometimes claim. Insofar as they lack belief, they are really atheists. Moreover, since absence of belief is the cognitive position in which everyone is born, the burden of proof falls on those who advocate religious belief. The proponents of the second definition, by contrast, regard the first definition as too broad because it includes uninformed children along with aggressive and explicit atheists. Consequently, it is unlikely that the public will adopt it."&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common among contemporary philosophers, and indeed it was not uncommon in earlier centuries, to reject positions on the ground that they are meaningless.

The word '''''catholic''''' (with lowercase ''c''; derived via [[Late Latin]] ''catholicus'', from the [[Greek language|Greek]] adjective {{lang|grc|καθολικός}} (''katholikos''), meaning "universal")&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Catholic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(cf. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2351864 Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'')]&lt;/ref&gt; comes from the Greek phrase {{lang|grc|καθόλου}} (''katholou''), meaning "on the whole", "according to the whole" or "in general", and is a combination of the Greek words {{lang|grc|κατά}} meaning "about" and {{lang|grc|ὅλος}} meaning "whole".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=catholic |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.strobert.org/user_image/pdf/On_Being_Catholic.pdf On Being Catholic]," by Claire Anderson M.Div.&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''Catholic''' (usually written with uppercase ''C'' in English) was first used to describe the [[Christian Church]] in the early 2nd century to emphasize its [[universalism|universal scope]].{{sayswho|date=October 2018}} In the context of [[Christianity|Christian]] [[ecclesiology]], it has a rich history and several usages. &lt;!-- ↓switched order↑ --&gt;

The word in English can mean either "of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic faith]]" or "relating to the historic doctrine and practice of the [[Western Church]]".{{refn|group=note|Western Christianity includes both the (Roman) Catholic Church, Protestant Churches that share historic ties with the Catholic Church, as well as [[independent Catholic Churches]] that split later.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/catholic?searchDictCode=all | title=catholic | publisher=Oxford University Press | accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Christians{{who|date=October 2018}} use it to refer more broadly to the whole [[Christian Church]] or to all believers in [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] regardless of denominational affiliation;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | title = Beliefs and Social Issues, FAQ | work = | publisher = United Methodist Church | url = http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&amp;b=3886045&amp;content_id=%7B0974694D-76D4-46D7-B7A8-4683C29B45D4%7D&amp;notoc=1 | doi = | accessdate = December 2009}}

&lt;/ref&gt; it can also more narrowly refer{{sayswho|date=October 2018}} to [[Catholicity]], which encompasses several historic churches sharing major beliefs. "[[Catholicos]]", the title used for the head of some churches in  [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] traditions, is derived from the same linguistic origin.

In non-ecclesiastical use, it derives its English meaning directly from its root, and is currently used to mean the following:
* including a wide variety of things; all-embracing
* universal or of general interest;
* [[liberalism|liberal]],{{sayswho|date=October 2018}} having broad interests, or wide sympathies;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Heritage Dictionary|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; or
* inclusive, inviting and containing strong evangelism.

The term has been incorporated into the name of the largest Christian communion, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (also called the Catholic Church). All of the three main branches of Christianity in the East ([[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Church]] and [[Church of the East]]) had always identified themselves as ''Catholic'' in accordance with Apostolic traditions and the [[Nicene Creed]]. [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]], [[Lutheran]]s, and some [[Methodism|Methodists]] also believe that their churches are "Catholic" in the sense that they too are in continuity with the original universal church founded by the Apostles. However, each church defines the scope of the "Catholic Church" differently. For instance, the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox churches, and Church of the East, each maintain that their own [[Christian denomination|denomination]] is identical with the original universal church, from which all other denominations broke away.

Distinguishing beliefs of [[Catholicity]], the beliefs of most Christians who call themselves "Catholic", include the [[episcopal polity]], that [[bishop]]s are considered the highest order of ministers within the Christian religion,&lt;ref&gt;F.L. Cross, ''Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'', 1977:175.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Nicene Creed]] of AD 381.  In particular, along with unity, [[sanctity]], and [[apostolicity]], catholicity is considered one of [[Four Marks of the Church]],&lt;ref&gt;Christliche Religion, Oskar Simmel Rudolf Stählin, 1960, 150&lt;/ref&gt; found the line of the Nicene Creed: "I believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church."

During the medieval and modern times, additional distinctions arose regarding the use of the terms ''Western Catholic'' and ''Eastern Catholic''. Before the [[East–West Schism]], those terms had just the basic geographical meanings, since only one undivided Catholicity existed, uniting the Latin speaking Christians of West and the Greek speaking Christians of the East. After the split of 1054 terminology became much more complicated, resulting in the creation of parallel and conflicting terminological systems.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Google books |id=0UIKAQAAMAAJ |title=Inventing Latin Heretics: Byzantines and the Filioque in the Ninth Century }} pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The Greek adjective ''katholikos'', the origin of the term "catholic" means "universal". Directly from the Greek, or via [[Late Latin]] ''catholicus'', the term ''catholic'' entered many other languages, becoming the base for the creation of various theological terms such as ''catholicism'' and ''[[catholicity]]'' ([[Late Latin]] ''catholicismus'', ''catholicitas'').

The term "catholicism" is the [[English language|English]] form of [[Late Latin]] ''catholicismus'', an abstract noun based on the adjective "catholic". The Modern Greek equivalent {{lang|el|[[:el:Καθολικισμός|καθολικισμός]]}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|katholikismos}}'') is back-formed and usually refers to the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;!--did the people citing "καθολικισμός" even check a dictionary?--&gt;

The terms "catholic", "catholicism" and "catholicity" is closely related to the use of the term ''[[Catholic Church (disambiguation)|Catholic Church]]''. The earliest evidence of the use of that term is the ''[[Letter to the Smyrnaeans]]'' that [[Ignatius of Antioch]] wrote in about 108 to Christians in [[Smyrna]]. Exhorting Christians to remain closely united with their [[bishop]], he wrote: "Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude [of the people] also be; even as, wherever [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] is, there is the Catholic Church."&lt;ref name="Smyrnaeans 8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.v.vii.viii.html|title=Chapter VIII.—Let nothing be done without the bishop|publisher=Christian Classics Ethereal Library|accessdate=21 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Angle|first=Paul T.|title=The Mysterious Origins of Christianity|publisher=Wheatmark, Inc.|year=2007|isbn=978-1-58736-821-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the second half of the second century, the word "catholic" began to be used to mean "orthodox" (non-heretical), "because Catholics claimed to teach the whole truth, and to represent the whole Church, while heresy arose out of the exaggeration of some one truth and was essentially partial and local".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/srawley/smyrnaeans.html|title=Ignatius Epistle to the Smyrnaeans|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 380, Emperor [[Theodosius I]] limited use of the term "Catholic Christian" exclusively to those who followed the same faith as [[Pope Damasus I]] of Rome and [[Pope Peter II of Alexandria|Pope Peter of Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/theodcodeXVI.html|title=Medieval Sourcebook: Theodosian Code XVI|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous other early writers including [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] (c. 315–386), [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430) further developed the use of the term "catholic" in relation to Christianity.

===Ignatius of Antioch===
[[File:Ignjatije Antiohijski.jpg|thumb|Ignatius of Antioch]]
The earliest recorded evidence of the use of the term "Catholic Church" is the ''[[Letter to the Smyrnaeans]]'' that [[Ignatius of Antioch]] wrote in about 107 to Christians in Smyrna. Exhorting Christians to remain closely united with their [[bishop]], he wrote: "Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude [of the people] also be; even as, wherever [[Jesus Christ]] is, there is the Catholic Church."&lt;ref name="Smyrnaeans 8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.v.vii.viii.html|title=Chapter VIII.—Let nothing be done without the bishop|publisher=Christian Classics Ethereal Library|accessdate=21 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Angle|first=Paul T.|title=The Mysterious Origins of Christianity|publisher=Wheatmark, Inc.|year=2007|isbn=9781587368219}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the meaning for Ignatius of this phrase J.H. Srawley wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This is the earliest occurrence in Christian literature of the phrase 'the Catholic Church' (ἡ καθολικὴ ἐκκλησία). The original sense of the word is 'universal'. Thus Justin Martyr (''Dial''. 82) speaks of the 'universal or [[general resurrection]]', using the words ἡ καθολικὴ ἀνάστασις. Similarly here the Church universal is contrasted with the particular Church of Smyrna. Ignatius means by the Catholic Church 'the aggregate of all the Christian congregations' (Swete, ''Apostles Creed'', p. 76). So too the letter of the Church of Smyrna is addressed to all the congregations of the Holy Catholic Church in every place. And this primitive sense of 'universal' the word has never lost, although in the latter part of the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|second century]] it began to receive the secondary sense of '[[orthodoxy|orthodox]]' as opposed to '[[heresy|heretical]]'. Thus it is used in an early [[Biblical Canon|Canon of Scripture]], the [[Muratorian fragment]] (''circa'' 170 A.D.), which refers to certain heretical writings as 'not received in the Catholic Church'. So too [[Cyril of Jerusalem]], in the [[Christianity in the 4th century|fourth century]], says that the Church is called Catholic not only 'because it is spread throughout the world', but also 'because it teaches completely and without defect all the doctrines which ought to come to the knowledge of men'. This secondary sense arose out of the original meaning because Catholics claimed to teach the whole truth, and to represent the whole Church, while heresy arose out of the exaggeration of some one truth and was essentially partial and local.&lt;ref&gt;[J.H. Srawley, The Epistles of St. Ignatius, Bishop of Antioch, vol. II,] pp. 41-42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/srawley/smyrnaeans.html another edition], p.97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By ''Catholic Church'' Ignatius designated the universal church. Ignatius considered that certain heretics of his time, who disavowed that Jesus was a material being who actually suffered and died, saying instead that "he only seemed to suffer" (Smyrnaeans, 2), were not really Christians.&lt;ref&gt;"As certain unbelievers maintain, that He only seemed to suffer, as they themselves only seem to be Christians". Ignatius said these heretics did not believe in the reality of Christ's flesh, which did suffer and was raised up again: "They confess not the Eucharist to be the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ, which suffered for our sins, and which the Father, of His goodness, raised up again" (Smyrnaeans, 7) and called them "beasts in the shape of men, whom you must not only not receive, but, if it be possible, not even meet with" (Smyrnaeans, 4).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other second-century uses===
The term is also used in the ''[[Martyrdom of Polycarp]]'' (155) and in the [[Muratorian fragment]] (about 177).

===Cyril of Jerusalem===
[[File:Saint Cyril of Jerusalem.jpg|thumb]]
As mentioned in the above quotation from J.H. Srawley, [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] (c. 315–386), who is venerated as a [[saint]] by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], and the [[Anglican Communion]], distinguished what he called the "Catholic Church" from other groups who could also refer to themselves as an ἐκκλησία (assembly or church):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Since the word [[Christian Church|Ecclesia]] is applied to different things (as also it is written of the multitude in the theatre of the Ephesians, ''And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the Assembly'' (Acts 19:14), and since one might properly and truly say that there is a ''Church of evil doers'', I mean the meetings of the heretics, the [[Marcionism|Marcionists]] and [[Manichaeism|Manichees]], and the rest, for this cause the Faith has securely delivered to you now the Article, "And in one Holy Catholic Church"; that you may avoid their wretched meetings, and ever abide with the Holy Church Catholic in which you were regenerated. And if ever you are sojourning in cities, inquire not simply where the Lord's House is (for the other sects of the profane also attempt to call their own dens houses of the Lord), nor merely where the Church is, but where is the Catholic Church. For this is the peculiar name of this Holy Church, the mother of us all, which is the [[Bride of Christ|spouse of our Lord Jesus Christ]], the Only-begotten [[Son of God]](Catechetical Lectures, XVIII, 26).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Theodosius I===
[[File:Theodosius.jpg|thumb|Theodosius I]]
[[Theodosius I]], Emperor from 379 to 395, declared "Catholic" Christianity the [[state religion|official religion]] of the Roman Empire, declaring in the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] of 27 February 380:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is our desire that all the various nations which are subject to our clemency and moderation, should continue the profession of that religion which was delivered to the Romans by the divine Apostle Peter, as it has been preserved by faithful tradition and which is now professed by the [[Pope Damasus I|Pontiff Damasus]] and by [[Pope Peter II of Alexandria|Peter, Bishop of Alexandria]], a man of apostolic holiness.

===Augustine of Hippo===
[[File:Augustinus 1.jpg|thumb|Augustine of Hippo]]
Only slightly later, Saint [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430) also used the term "Catholic" to distinguish the "true" church from heretical groups:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the Catholic Church, there are many other things which most justly keep me in her bosom. The consent of peoples and nations keeps me in the Church; so does her authority, inaugurated by miracles, nourished by hope, enlarged by love, established by age. The succession of priests keeps me, beginning from the very seat of the [[Apostle Peter]], to whom the Lord, after His resurrection, gave it in charge to feed His sheep (Jn 21:15–19), down to the present [[historical episcopate|episcopate]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;And so, lastly, does the very name of Catholic, which, not without reason, amid so many heresies, the Church has thus retained; so that, though all heretics wish to be called Catholics, yet when a stranger asks where the Catholic Church meets, no heretic will venture to point to his own chapel or house.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Such then in number and importance are the precious ties belonging to the Christian name which keep a believer in the Catholic Church, as it is right they should ... With you, where there is none of these things to attract or keep me... No one shall move me from the faith which binds my mind with ties so many and so strong to the Christian religion... For my part, I should not believe the gospel except as moved by the authority of the Catholic Church.&amp;nbsp;—St. Augustine (354–430): ''Against the Epistle of Manichaeus called Fundamental'', chapter 4: Proofs of the Catholic Faith.

===St Vincent of Lerins===
A contemporary of Augustine, [[St. Vincent of Lerins]], wrote in 434 (under the pseudonym Peregrinus) a work known as the ''[[Commonitory|Commonitoria]]'' ("Memoranda"). While insisting that, like the human body, church doctrine develops while truly keeping its identity (sections 54-59, chapter XXIII),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Commonitory for the Antiquity and Universality of the Catholic Faith Against the Profane Novelties of All Heresies.|publisher=[[Christian Classics Ethereal Library]]|author=[[Vincent of Lerins]]|accessdate=2012-03-05|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf211.iii.xxiv.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; he stated:

===Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church===
{{See also|Western Catholic (disambiguation)|Eastern Catholic (disambiguation)}}
During early centuries of Christian history, majority of Christians who followed doctrines represented in [[Nicene Creed]] were bound by one common and undivided [[Catholicity]] that was uniting the Latin speaking Christians of West and the Greek speaking Christians of the East. In those days, terms "eastern Catholic" and "western Catholic" had their basic geographical meanings, generally corresponding to existing linguistic distinctions between Greek East and Latin West. In spite of various and quite frequent theological and ecclesiastical disagreements between major Christian sees, common [[Catholicity]] was preserved until the great disputes that arose between 9th and 11th century. After the [[East–West Schism]], the notion of common [[Catholicity]] was broken and each side started to develop its own terminological practice.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

All major theological and ecclesiastical disputes in the Christian East or West have been commonly accompanied by attempts of arguing sides to deny each other the right to use the word "Catholic" as term of self-designation. After the acceptance of [[Filioque]] clause into the [[Nicene Creed]] by the Rome, Orthodox Christians in the East started to refer to adherents of Filioquism in the West just as "Latins" considering them no longer to be "Catholics".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The dominant view in the Eastern Orthodox Church, that all Western Christians who accepted Filioque interpolation and unorthodox Pneumatology ceased to be Catholics, was held and promoted by famous Eastern Orthodox canonist [[Theodore Balsamon]] who was [[patriarch of Antioch]]. He wrote in 1190:

{{quote|For many years the once illustrious congregation of the Western Church, that is to say, the Church of Rome, has been divided in spiritual communion from the other four Patriarchates, and has separated itself by adopting customs and dogmas alien to the Catholic Church and to the Orthodox ... So no Latin should be sanctified by the hands of the priests through divine and spotless Mysteries unless he first declares that he will abstain from Latin dogmas and customs, and that he will conform to the practice of the Orthodox.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=KugGDAAAQBAJ |title=Heresy and the Making of European Culture: Medieval and Modern Perspectives }} p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the other side of the widening rift, Eastern Orthodox were considered by western theologians to be ''Schismatics''. Relations between East and West were further estranged by the tragic events of the [[Massacre of the Latins]] in 1182 and [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)#Sack of Constantinople|Sack of Constantinople]] in 1204. Those bloody events were followed  by several failed attempts to reach reconciliation (see: [[Second Council of Lyon]], [[Council of Florence]], [[Union of Brest]], [[Union of Uzhhorod]]). During the late medieval and early modern period, terminology became much more complicated, resulting in the creation of parallel and confronting terminological systems that exist today in all of their complexity.

During the Early Modern period, a special term "Acatholic" was widely used in the West to mark all those who were considered to hold heretical theological views and irregular ecclesiastical practices. In the time of [[Counter-Reformation]] the term ''Acatholic'' was used by zealous members of the [[Catholic Church]] to designate [[Protestants]] as well as Eastern Orthodox Christians. The term was considered to be so insulting that the Council of the [[Metropolitanate of Karlovci|Serbian Orthodox Church]], held in [[Timișoara|Temeswar]] in 1790, decided to send an official plea to emperor [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]], begging him to ban the use of the term "Acatholic".&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=aSlYAAAAcAAJ |title=Радња Благовештенског сабора народа србског у Сремским Карловцима }} p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lutheran Churches ===
The [[Augsburg Confession]] found within the [[Book of Concord]], a compendium of belief of the [[Lutheran Church]]es, teaches that "the faith as confessed by Luther and his followers is nothing new, but the true catholic faith, and that their churches represent the true catholic or universal church".&lt;ref name="Ludwig2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Luther’s Catholic Reformation|last=Ludwig|first=Alan|date=12 September 2016|publisher=The Lutheran Witness|language=English|accessdate=22 February 2017|quote= When the Lutherans presented the Augsburg Confession before Emperor Charles V in 1530, they carefully showed that each article of faith and practice was true first of all to Holy Scripture, and then also to the teaching of the church fathers and the councils and even the canon law of the Church of Rome. They boldly claim, “This is about the Sum of our Doctrine, in which, as can be seen, there is nothing that varies from the Scriptures, or from the Church Catholic, or from the Church of Rome as known from its writers” (AC XXI Conclusion 1). The underlying thesis of the Augsburg Confession is that the faith as confessed by Luther and his followers is nothing new, but the true catholic faith, and that their churches represent the true catholic or universal church. In fact, it is actually the Church of Rome that has departed from the ancient faith and practice of the catholic church (see AC XXIII 13, XXVIII 72 and other places).}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Lutherans presented the Augsburg Confession to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1530, they believe to have "showed that each article of faith and practice was true first of all to Holy Scripture, and then also to the teaching of the church fathers and the councils".&lt;ref name="Ludwig2016"/&gt;

==Contemporary use{{anchor|Divergent usages}}==
The term "Catholic" is commonly associated with the whole of the church led by the Roman Pontiff, the [[Catholic Church]]. Other Christian churches that use the description "Catholic" include the Eastern Orthodox Church and other churches that believe in the [[historic episcopate]] (bishops), such as the [[Anglican Communion]].&lt;!--Some of them claim to be the one true Catholic Church from which, in their view, other Christians, including those in communion with the Pope, have fallen away.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roacusa.org/OrthodoxSchool/TwoThousandYearOldApostolic/Christianity.doc Steven Kovacevich, Apostolic Christianity and the 23,000 Western Churches], especially p. 15{{Dead link|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://orthodox.cn/contemporary/20000814basicprinciples/basicprinciples_encn.pdf Basic Principles Of The Attitude of The Russian Orthodox Church toward the Other Christian Confessions, adopted by the Jubilee Bishops’ Council of the Russian Orthodox Church, 14 August 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those who apply the term "Catholic Church" to all Christians object to the use of the term to designate what they view as only one church within what they understand as the "whole" Catholic Church.  In the [[English language]], the first known use of the term is in [[Andrew of Wyntoun]]'s ''[[Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland]]'', "He was a constant Catholic/All Lollard he hated and heretic."&lt;ref&gt;"Catholic", in ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''(1989), New York:  [[Oxford University Press]], [spelling modernized].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catholic Church{{anchor|Use by the Catholic Church}}===
{{See also|Catholic Church|Roman Catholic (term)}}
The [[Catholic Church]], led by the [[Pope]] in Rome, usually distinguishes itself from other churches by calling itself the "Catholic", however has also used the description "Roman Catholic". Even apart from documents drawn up jointly with other churches, it has sometimes, in view of the central position it attributes to the See of Rome, adopted the adjective "Roman" for the whole church, Eastern as well as Western, as in the papal encyclicals [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_31121929_divini-illius-magistri_en.html ''Divini illius Magistri''] and [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html ''Humani generis''.] Another example is its self-description as "the holy Catholic Apostolic Roman Church"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds2.v.ii.i.html English translation by [[Henry Edward Manning]] in [[Philip Schaff]], ''Creeds of Christendom: Volume II.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in the 24 April 1870 Dogmatic Constitution on the Catholic Faith of the [[First Vatican Council]]. In all of these documents it also refers to itself both simply as the Catholic Church and by other names. The [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], while united with Rome in the faith, have their own traditions and laws, differing from those of the [[Latin Rite]] and those of other Eastern Catholic Churches.

The contemporary Catholic Church has always considered itself to be the historic Catholic Church, and consider all others as "non-Catholics". This practice is an application of the belief that not all who claim to be Christians are part of the Catholic Church, as Ignatius of Antioch, the earliest known writer to use the term "Catholic Church", considered that certain heretics who called themselves Christians only seemed to be such.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0109.htm Smyrnaeans, 2]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
The [[Latin Rite]] of the [[Catholic Church]] and the 22 [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] consider that they continue and are charged with preserving the catholic tradition as handed down from the [[Early Church Fathers]]. Eastern Catholic churches are those [[particular church]]es that, in full communion with the [[Diocese of Rome|Bishop of Rome]] — the Pope — while remaining autonomous (in Latin, ''sui iuris''), preserve the liturgical, theological and devotional traditions of the various Eastern Christian churches with which they are associated. They include the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian]], [[Greek Byzantine Catholic Church|Greek]], [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Greek Melkite]], [[Maronite Church|Maronite]], [[Ruthenian Catholic Church|Ruthenian Byzantine]], [[Coptic Catholic Church|Coptic Catholic]], [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church|Syro-Malabar]], [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Church|Syro-Malankara]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church|Chaldean]] and [[Ethiopic Catholic Church|Ethiopic]] Rites. Under [[Pope John Paul II]] the Catholic Church issued a book of beliefs, the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', which states: "To believe that the Church is 'holy' and 'catholic,' and that she is 'one' and 'apostolic' (as the Nicene Creed adds), is inseparable from belief in God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P26.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 750]&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
In the [[English language]], the first known use of the term is in [[Andrew of Wyntoun]]'s ''[[Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland]]'', "He was a constant Catholic/All Lollard he hated and heretic."&lt;ref&gt;"Catholic", in ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''(1989), New York:  [[Oxford University Press]], [spelling modernized].&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
The term "Catholic" is commonly associated with the whole of the church led by the Roman Pontiff, the [[Catholic Church]], and whose over one billion adherents are about half of the estimated [[Largest religion|2.1 billion Christians]]. Other Christian churches also laying claim to the description "Catholic" include the Eastern Orthodox Church and those churches possessing the historic episcopate (bishops), such as those of the Anglican Communion. Some of them claim to be the one true Catholic Church from which, in their view, other Christians, including those in communion with the Pope, have fallen away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roacusa.org/OrthodoxSchool/TwoThousandYearOldApostolic/Christianity.doc Steven Kovacevich, Apostolic Christianity and the 23,000 Western Churches], especially p. 15{{Dead link|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://orthodox.cn/contemporary/20000814basicprinciples/basicprinciples_encn.pdf Basic Principles Of The Attitude of The Russian Orthodox Church toward the Other Christian Confessions, adopted by the Jubilee Bishops’ Council of the Russian Orthodox Church, 14 August 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
Many of those who apply the term "Catholic Church" to all Christians object to the use of the term to designate what they view as only one church within what they understand as the "whole" Catholic Church. However, the church in communion with the Bishop of Rome, both in its Western form and in that of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], has always considered itself to be the historic Catholic Church, with all others as "non-Catholics" and regularly refers to itself as "the Catholic Church". This practice is an application of the belief that not all who claim to be Christians are part of the Catholic Church, as Ignatius of Antioch, the earliest known writer to use the term "Catholic Church", considered that certain heretics who called themselves Christians only seemed to be such.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0109.htm Smyrnaeans, 2]&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
Though normally distinguishing itself from other churches by calling itself the "Catholic Church", it also uses the description "Roman Catholic Church". Even apart from documents drawn up jointly with other churches, it has sometimes, in view of the central position it attributes to the See of Rome, adopted the adjective "Roman" for the whole church, Eastern as well as Western, as in the papal encyclicals [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_31121929_divini-illius-magistri_en.html ''Divini illius Magistri''] and [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html ''Humani generis''.] Another example is its self-description as "the holy Catholic Apostolic Roman Church"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds2.v.ii.i.html English translation by [[Henry Edward Manning]] in [[Philip Schaff]], ''Creeds of Christendom: Volume II. The History of Creeds'']&lt;/ref&gt; (or, by separating each adjective, as the "Holy, Catholic, Apostolic and Roman Catholic.).
--&gt;

Regarding the relations with Eastern Christians, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] stated his wish to restore [[full communion|full unity]] with the Orthodox. The Roman Catholic Church considers that almost all of the ancient theological differences have been satisfactorily addressed (the [[Filioque]] clause, the nature of [[purgatory]], etc.), and has declared that differences in traditional customs, observances and discipline are no obstacle to unity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19641121_unitatis-redintegratio_en.html Second Vatican Council Decree on Ecumenism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306113628/http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19641121_unitatis-redintegratio_en.html |date=6 March 2013 }}, 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent historic ecumenical efforts on the part of the Catholic Church have focused on healing the rupture between the Western ("Catholic") and the Eastern ("Orthodox") churches. [[Pope John Paul II]] often spoke of his great desire that the Catholic Church "once again breathe with both lungs",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_25051995_ut-unum-sint_en.html Encyciclical ''Ut unum sint''], 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_sacri-canones_lt.html Apostolic Constitution ''Sacri Canones'']&lt;/ref&gt; thus emphasizing that the Roman Catholic Church seeks to restore [[Full communion#Roman Catholic Church|full communion]] with the separated Eastern churches.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/apr/02/guardianobituaries.catholicism Obituary of Pope John Paul II]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orthodoxy===
{{see also|Eastern Orthodox Church|Oriental Orthodox Church|Church of the East}}
All of the three main branches of Christianity in the East ([[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Church]] and [[Church of the East]]) are continuing to identify themselves as ''Catholic'' in accordance with Apostolic traditions and the [[Nicene Creed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=ZC7B3v80C |title=Catholicity and the Church }} pp.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] firmly upholds the ancient doctrines of [[Eastern Orthodox Church#Catholicity of the Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Catholicity]] and commonly uses the term ''Catholic'', as in the title of [http://www.pravoslavieto.com/docs/eng/Orthodox_Catechism_of_Philaret.htm ''The Longer Catechism of the Orthodox, Catholic, Eastern Church'']. So does the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox Church]] that belongs to [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] and considers its communion to be "the True Church of the Lord Jesus Christ".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suscopts.org/pdf/copticchurch/rituals2.pdf Characteristics of Our Coptic Church]&lt;/ref&gt; Non of the Eastern Churches, Orthodox or Oriental, have any intention to abandon ancient traditions of their own Catholicity.

===Protestantism===
Most [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and post-Reformation churches use the term ''Catholic'' (often with a lower-case ''c'') to refer to the belief that all Christians are part of one Church regardless of denominational divisions; e.g., Chapter XXV of the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] refers to the "catholic or universal Church". It is in line with this interpretation, which applies the word "catholic" (universal) to no one denomination, that they understand the phrase "[[one holy catholic and apostolic Church]]" in the [[Nicene Creed]], the phrase ''the Catholic faith'' in the [[Athanasian Creed]] and the phrase "holy catholic church" in the [[Apostles' Creed]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

The term is used also to mean those Christian churches that maintain that their [[Historical episcopate|episcopate]] can be [[apostolic succession|traced unbrokenly back]] to the [[Twelve Apostles|apostles]] and consider themselves part of a ''catholic'' (universal) body of believers. Among those who regard themselves as ''Catholic'' but not ''Roman Catholic'' are [[Anglican]]s{{cn|date=April 2018}} and [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]],&lt;ref name="Ludwig2016"/&gt; who stress that they are both Reformed and Catholic. The [[Old Catholic Church]] and the various groups classified as [[Independent Catholic Churches]] also lay claim to the description ''Catholic''. [[Traditionalist Catholic]]s, even if they may not be in communion with Rome, consider themselves to be not only Catholics but the "true" Roman Catholics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Some use the term "Catholic" to distinguish their own position from a [[Calvinist]] or [[Puritan]] form of Reformed-[[Protestantism]]. These include a faction of Anglicans often also called [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholics]], 19th century [[Neo-Lutheranism|Neo-Lutherans]], 20th century [[High Church Lutheran]]s or [[evangelical-Catholic]]s and others.

[[Methodist]]s and [[Presbyterian]]s believe their denominations owe their origins to the Apostles and the early church, but do not claim descent from ancient church structures such as the episcopate. However, both of these churches hold that they are a part of the catholic (universal) church. According to ''[[Harper's New Monthly Magazine]]'': {{quote|The various Protestant sects can not constitute one church because they have no [[intercommunion]]...each Protestant Church, whether Methodist or Baptist or whatever, is in perfect communion with itself everywhere as the Roman Catholic; and in this respect, consequently, the Roman Catholic has no advantage or superiority, except in the point of numbers.

===Independent Catholicism===
Some Independent Catholics accept that, among bishops, that of Rome is ''primus inter pares'', and hold that [[conciliarism]] is a necessary check against [[ultramontanism]]. They are however, by definition, not recognised by the [[Catholic Church]].

==Avoidance of use==
Some Protestant churches avoid using the term completely, to the extent among many Lutherans of reciting the Creed with the word "Christian" in place of "catholic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Center for the Study of Democracy''' is a research and education institute at [[St. Mary's College of Maryland]] that focuses on the study of the history of emerging democracy in [[St. Mary's City, Maryland]], the site of Maryland'a first colonial capital and the location of many firsts in the development of democratic rights in North America; this work is done in conjunction with studies of modern democracies.  

The mission of the Center for the Study of Democracy is to draw historical lessons and also inspiration from history, in order to increase understanding of the processes and principles that lead to the constructive maintenance and enhancement of democracy in the United States and around the world. 

It does so by drawing on in-depth historical research, in conjunction with in-depth research on modern democracy-related issues and events, as they both relate to the process of [[democratization]] (establishing and improving democracy in all of its processes). 

The Center also sponsors numerous ongoing public forums and debates and seminars on these issues, many of which are covered by the media. 

The debates also often include hosting and moderating major political leaders or policy leaders facing off against their opponents.  

The Center for the Study of Democracy also strives to better understand historic setbacks and inconsistencies in the [[democratization]] process of historic Maryland and the United States, in order to better understand how these were eventually overcome; taking lessons from history that can then be applied to study of how democracy might be more constructively furthered today. The center Works in particular to increase understanding of how democracy may be enhanced in spite of the many obstacles that democratization often faces. 

The Center is jointly run by the Public Honors College, [[St. Mary's College of Maryland]] and its partner institution and neighbor, [[St. Mary's City, Maryland#Historic St. Mary's City|Historic St. Mary's City]], one of the nation's preeminent historical and archeological research institutions,

'''Cosmography''' is the science that [[map]]s the general features of the [[cosmos]] or [[universe]], describing both [[heaven]] and [[Earth]] (but without encroaching on [[geography]] or [[astronomy]]). The 14th-century work ''[['Aja'ib al-makhluqat wa-ghara'ib al-mawjudat]]'' by [[Persian people|Persian]] physician [[Zakariya al-Qazwini]] is considered to be an early work of cosmography.

Traditional Hindu, Buddhist and [[Jainism|Jain]] cosmography schematize a universe centered on [[Mount Meru]] surrounded by rivers, continents and seas.  These cosmographies posit a universe being repeatedly created and destroyed over time cycles of immense lengths.

an Engraving on Wood, attributed to---&gt; &amp;ndash; by [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]], in the "Cosmographie" of Munster (Basle, 1552, folio).]]
In 1551, [[Martín Cortés de Albacar]], from [[Zaragoza]], Spain, published ''[[Breve compendio de la esfera y del arte de navegar]]''. Translated into English and reprinted several times, the work was of great influence in Britain for many years. He proposed spherical charts and mentioned magnetic deviation and the existence of magnetic poles.

[[Peter Heylin]]'s 1652 book ''Cosmographie'' (enlarged from his ''Microcosmos'' of 1621) was one of the earliest attempts to describe the entire world in English, and being the first known description of [[Australia]] and among the first of [[California]]. The book has 4 sections, examining the geography, politics, and cultures of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, with an addendum on ''[[Terra incognita|Terra Incognita]]'', including Australia, and extending to [[Utopia]], [[Álfheimr|Fairyland]], and the "Land of [[Chivalry|Chivalrie]]".

In 1659, Thomas Porter published a smaller, but extensive ''Compendious Description of the Whole World'', which also included a [[chronology]] of world events from [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] forward. These were all part of a major trend in the [[European Renaissance]] to explore (and perhaps comprehend) the known world.

The word was also commonly used by [[Buckminster Fuller]] in his lectures.

In [[astrophysics]], the term "cosmography" is beginning to be used to describe attempts to determine the large-scale [[Observable universe#Large-scale structure|matter distribution]] and [[kinematics]] of the [[universe|observable universe]], dependent on the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] but independent of the temporal dependence of the [[Scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] on the matter/energy composition of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Criticism of religion''' is [[criticism]] of the ideas, the truth, or the practice of [[religion]], including its political and social implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Beckford|first=James A.|title=Social Theory and Religion| page=2| year=2003| publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0-521-77431-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical records of criticism of religion goes back to at least 5th century BCE in [[ancient Greece]], with [[Diagoras of Melos|Diagoras "the Atheist" of Melos]]. In [[ancient Rome]], an early known example is [[Lucretius]]' ''[[De Rerum Natura]]'' from the 1st century BCE.

Every exclusive religion on Earth that promotes [[Truth claim|exclusive truth]] claims necessarily denigrates the truth claims of other religions.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Saumur v Quebec (City of)]]''. &lt;br/&gt;See also: &lt;br/&gt;{{cite book|author1=Katharine Gelber|author2=Adrienne Sarah Ackary Stone|title=Hate Speech and Freedom of Speech in Australia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y3oYYweMrF8C|year=2007|publisher=Federation Press|isbn=978-1-86287-653-8|quote=In some belief systems, religious leaders and believers maintain the right to both emphasise the benefits of their own religion and criticise other religions; that is, they make their own claims and deny the truth claims of others.|page=179}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book|quote=people of every religion, as well as of no religion, have a reason for wanting it to be possible to face other people with challenges to their faith, namely that this is the only way those people can be brought to see the truth.|author1=Michael Herz|author2=Peter Molnar|title=The Content and Context of Hate Speech: Rethinking Regulation and Responses|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KC0gAwAAQBAJ|date=9 April 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-37561-1}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web|quote=Due to the nature of religious belief, one person's faith often implies that another's is wrong and perhaps even offensive, constituting blasphemy.

==History of criticism of religion==
In his work ''[[De Rerum Natura]]'', the 1st century [[BCE]] Roman poet [[Titus Lucretius Carus]] wrote: "But 'tis that same religion oftener far / Hath bred the foul impieties of men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://books.mirror.org/gb.lucretius.html |author=Titus Lucretius Carus |authorlink=Titus Lucretius Carus |title=De Rerum Natura |accessdate=2007-08-05 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630071929/http://books.mirror.org/gb.lucretius.html |archivedate=2007-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A philosopher of the [[Epicurean]] school, [[Lucretius]], believed the world was composed solely of matter and void and that all phenomena could be understood as resulting from purely natural causes. Despite believing in Gods, Lucretius, like [[Epicurus]], felt that religion was born of fear and ignorance, and that understanding the natural world would free people of its shackles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/l/lucretiu.htm |title=Lucretius (c.99&amp;nbsp;– c.55 BCE) |publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=2007-08-05 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanford - Lucretius"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lucretius – Stanford Encyclopedia|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/|accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not against religion in and of itself, but against traditional religion which he saw as [[superstition]] for teaching that gods interfered with the world.&lt;ref name="Latin-English: On Nature"&gt;{{cite book|title=On the Nature of Things Translated by W.H.D. Rouse|year=1992|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-99200-8|author=Lucretius|page=8|quote=This (superstition) or "false religion", not "religion," is the meaning of "religio". The Epicureans were opposed, not to religion (cf. 6.68–79), but to traditional religion which taught that the gods govern the world. That Lucretius regarded "religio" as synonymous with "superstitio" is implied by "super....instans" in [line] 65.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 16th century, [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] said: "We Italians are irreligious and corrupt above others... because the church and her representatives have set us the worst example".&lt;ref name="{{ISBN|014044534x}}"&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Middlemore, S. G. C. |author2=Burckhardt, Jacob |author3=Murray, Peter |author4=Burke, Peter |title=The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy |publisher=Penguin Classics |location= |year= 1990|isbn=0-14-044534-X |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]], religion was merely a tool, useful for a ruler wishing to manipulate public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1232/1232-h/1232-h.htm |title=The Prince | first= Nicolo |last= Machiavelli | year = 1532| accessdate=2007-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, [[Voltaire]] was a [[deism|deist]] and was strongly critical of religious intolerance. [[Voltaire]] complained about Jews killed by other Jews for worshiping a golden calf and similar actions, he also condemned how Christians killed other Christians over religious differences and how Christians killed [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] for not being [[Baptism|baptised]]. Voltaire claimed the real reason for these killings was that Christians wanted to plunder the wealth of those killed. Voltaire was also critical of [[Muslim]] intolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.hanover.edu/texts/voltaire/volrelig.html|title=Voltaire's Philosophical Dictionary|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the 18th century, [[David Hume]] criticised [[teleological argument]]s for religion. Hume claimed that natural explanations for the order in the [[universe]] were reasonable, see [[David Hume#Design argument|design argument]]. An important aim of Hume's writings was demonstrating the unsoundness of the philosophical basis for religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-religion/|title=Hume on Religion|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Christopher Hitchens crop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Christopher Hitchens]], journalist and author of ''[[God is not Great]]'']]
In the early 21st century, the [[New Atheism|New Atheists]] became focal polemicists in modern criticism of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bailey|first=David|title=What are the merits of recent claims by atheistic scholars that modern science proves religion to be false and vain?|url=http://www.sciencemeetsreligion.org/theology/atheists.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The New Atheists|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/n-atheis/|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four authors come from widely different backgrounds and have published books which have been the focus of criticism of religion narratives, with over 100 books and hundreds of scholarly articles commenting on and critiquing the four Horsemen's works. Their books and articles have spawned debate in multiple fields of inquiry and are heavily quoted in popular media (online forums, [[YouTube]], television and popular philosophy). In ''[[The End of Faith]]'', philosopher [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] focuses on violence among other toxic qualities of religion. In ''[[Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon|Breaking the Spell]]'', philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] focuses on the question of "why we believe strange things". In ''[[The God Delusion]]'', biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] covers almost every facet of religion injecting both snarky irony and humor. In ''[[God Is Not Great]]'', journalist and polemicist [[Christopher Hitchens]] focused on how religious forces attacks human dignity and the corruption of religious organizations. In the ''Oxford Handbook of Atheism'', according to Thomas Zenc the four books were published during a time of intense debate on political, religious and sociological questions. The works share many common themes yet notably differ in scope, style and content. While according to Zenc the beginnings of a broader narrative ([[New Atheism]]) seems to have emerged it does not, stand up to the full definition of a movement.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Handbook on Atheism.

===Response to general criticism of religion in an historical context===

{{Main|Religion|Definition of religion}}

Today, religion is broadly conceived as an abstraction which entails beliefs, doctrines and sacred places—even though the ancient and medieval cultures that produced [[religious text]]s, like the [[Bible]] or the [[Quran]], did not have such conceptions or ideas in their languages, cultures, or histories.&lt;ref name="Nongbri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="50 myths"/&gt; However, there is still no scholarly consensus over what a religion is.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"&gt;{{Cite book|ref= harv|first= Timothy|last= Fitzgerald|title= Discourse on Civility and Barbarity|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 2007|pages= 45–46 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=b67p1VdF_OoC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nongbri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="50 myths" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dubuisson"/&gt;

Before the 17th century religion was conflated with every day life. [[Religion]] as a modern Western concept developed from the 17th century onwards.&lt;ref name="50 myths"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Morreall|first1= John|last2= Sonn|first2= Tamara|title= 50 Great Myths of Religion|chapter= Myth 1: All Societies Have Religions|date= 2013|publisher= Wiley-Blackwell|isbn= 9780470673508|pages= 12–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nongbri&gt;{{cite book|last1= Nongbri|first1= Brent|title= Before Religion: A History of a Modern Concept|date= 2013|publisher= Yale University Press|isbn= 030015416X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Harrison|first1= Peter|title= The Territories of Science and Religion|date= 2015|publisher= University of Chicago Press|isbn= 022618448X | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WLvnBgAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dubuisson&gt;{{cite book|first1= Daniel|last1= Dubuisson|title= The Western Construction of Religion : Myths, Knowledge, and Ideology|date= 2007|publisher= Johns Hopkins University Press|location= Baltimore, Md.|isbn= 0801887569 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kyl5K2TV8zMC}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Asia, no one before the 19th century self-identified as a "Hindu" or other similar identities.&lt;ref name="50 myths"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Invention Japan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Josephson|first1=Jason Ananda|title=The Invention of Religion in Japan|pages=11–12|date=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226412342}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="50 myths"/&gt;

With the existence of diverse modern categories of religion such as [[monotheism]], [[polytheism]], [[pantheism]], [[Nontheistic religions|nontheism]] and diverse specific religions such as [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], [[Taoism]], [[Buddhism]] and many others, it is not always clear to whom the criticisms are aimed at or to what extent they are applicable to other religions.

However, we feel that religion even in moderation provides a foundation for fanatical groups to thrive"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cvatheists.org/news/?p=1 "The Vernon Atheist Display,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617035811/http://www.cvatheists.org/news/?p=1 |date=2008-06-17 }} Press Release, CT Valley Atheists, December 17, 2007 .

Some criticisms of monotheistic religions have been:

==Explanations as non-divine in origin==

===Social construct===
{{See also|Development of religion}}

Dennett and Harris have asserted that theist religions and their scriptures are not divinely inspired, but man made to fulfill [[society|social]], [[biological]] and [[political]] needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon|Breaking the Spell]]|publisher=Allen Lane|year=2006|isbn=0-7139-9789-3|first=Daniel|last=Dennett|authorlink=Daniel Dennett}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[The End of Faith]]|publisher=W.

===Narratives to provide comfort and meaning===
[[David Hume]] argued that religion developed as a source of comfort in the face of the adversity, not as an honest grappling with verifiable truth. Religion is therefore an unsophisticated form of reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Bashevkin, Dovid.  [http://www.thelehrhaus.com/timely-thoughts/2016/9/29/jonah-and-the-varieties-of-religious-motivation-a-religious-educators-perspective-on-why-people-become-religious "Jonah and the Varieties of Religious Motivation."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012155807/http://www.thelehrhaus.com/timely-thoughts/2016/9/29/jonah-and-the-varieties-of-religious-motivation-a-religious-educators-perspective-on-why-people-become-religious |date=2016-10-12 }} ''Lehrhaus''.  9 October 2016.  2 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel Dennett]] has argued that, with the exception of more modern religions such as [[Raëlism]], [[Mormonism]], [[Scientology]] and the [[Bahá'í Faith]], most religions were formulated at a time when the origin of life, the workings of the body, and the nature of the stars and planets were poorly understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Dennett, Daniel Clement |title=Breaking the Spell : Religion as a Natural Phenomenon |publisher=Viking Adult |location= |year= 2006|isbn=0-670-03472-X |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These narratives were intended to give solace and a sense of relationship with larger forces. As such, they may have served several important functions in ancient societies. Examples include the views many religions traditionally had towards solar and lunar [[eclipse]]s and the appearance of [[comet]]s (forms of [[astrology]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title =When solar fears eclipse reason | work = | publisher =BBC News | date =2006-03-28 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4852690.stm | doi = | accessdate=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Comets in Ancient Cultures | work = | publisher =NASA | url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/deepimpact/media/f_ancient.html | doi = | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given current understanding of the physical world, where human knowledge has increased dramatically, Dawkins and French atheist philosopher [[Michel Onfray]] contend that continuing to hold on to these belief systems is irrational and no longer useful.&lt;ref name="The God Delusion" /&gt;&lt;ref name="{{ISBN|1-55970-820-4}}"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Onfray, Michel |authorlink=Michel Onfray |title=Atheist Manifesto: The Case Against Christianity, Judaism, and Islam |publisher=Arcade Publishing |location= |year= 2007|isbn=1-55970-820-4 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opium of the people====
[[File:Karl Marx 001.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Karl Marx]]]]
{{quote|Religious suffering is, at the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the [[opium of the people]].|[[Karl Marx]]&lt;ref name="critright"/&gt;}}
According to [[Karl Marx]], the father of "[[scientific socialism]]", religion is a tool used by the [[ruling class]]es whereby the masses can shortly relieve their suffering via the act of experiencing religious emotions. It is in the interest of the ruling classes to instill in the masses the religious conviction that their current suffering will lead to eventual happiness. Therefore, as long as the public believes in religion, they will not attempt to make any genuine effort to understand and overcome the real source of their suffering, which in Marx's opinion was their [[capitalist]] economic system. In this perspective, Marx saw religion as [[escapism]].&lt;ref name="critright"&gt;{{Cite book| last =Marx | first =Karl | authorlink =Karl Marx |chapter=Introduction | title = A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right | publisher =Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher |date=February 1844 | location = | url =http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/critique-hpr/intro.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx also viewed the Christian doctrine of [[original sin]] as being deeply [[anti-social behaviour|anti-social]] in character. Original sin, he argued, convinces people that the source of their misery lies in the inherent and unchangeable "sinfulness" of humanity rather than in the forms of social organization and institutions, which Marx argued can be changed through the application of collective social planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Marx | first =Karl | authorlink =Karl Marx | title =Das Kapital | publisher = | year =1867 | location =  | url =http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch26.htm | doi = | id = | nopp =true| page =Volume 1, Part VIII  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Viruses of the mind===
[[File:Richard dawkins lecture.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Richard Dawkins]], author of ''[[The God Delusion]]'']]
In his 1976 book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] coined the term [[memes]] to describe informational units that can be transmitted culturally, analogous to genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Dawkins | first =Richard | title =[[The Selfish Gene]], 30th Anniversary edition  | publisher =  | year =2006 | location = | url =  | doi =  | id =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later used this concept in the essay "[[Viruses of the Mind]]" to explain the persistence of religious ideas in human culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Dawkins | first =Richard | title =Viruses of the Mind | work = | publisher = | year =1991 | url =http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/Dawkins/viruses-of-the-mind.html | doi = | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Response to virus of the mind criticism====

Both the religious and non religious are critical of Dawkin's meme theory which has mostly been abandoned. [[John Bowker (theologian)|John Bowker]] criticized the idea that "God" and "Faith" are viruses of the mind, suggesting that Dawkins' "account of religious motivation [...] is [...] far removed from evidence and data" that it is unreasonable to extract certain behaviours solely through religious memes.&lt;ref&gt;In his 1992–93 [[Gresham College]] lectures, written in collaboration with the psychiatrist Quinton Deeley and published as ''Is God a Virus?'', SPCK, 1995, 274 pp. The quotes here come from p.73.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alister McGrath]] has responded by arguing that "memes have no place in serious scientific reflection",&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'', p.125, quoting [[Simon Conway Morris]] in support&lt;/ref&gt; that there is strong evidence that such ideas are not spread by random processes, but by deliberate intentional actions,&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'', p.126&lt;/ref&gt; that "evolution" of ideas is more [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] than [[Darwinian]]&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'', p.127&lt;/ref&gt; and that there is no evidence (and certainly none in the essay) that epidemiological models usefully explain the spread of religious ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'' pp.137–138&lt;/ref&gt; McGrath also points out that it is surveys in the United States report a high life satisfaction rate among the religious is not comparable with a virus.&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'', p.136, citing [[Harold G. Koenig|Koenig]] and Cohen, ''The Link between Religion and Health'', OUP, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental illness or delusion===

[[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] compares religion to [[mental illness]], saying it "allows otherwise normal human beings to reap the fruits of madness and consider them ''holy''".&lt;!--Italicized in original--&gt;&lt;ref name=endoffaith&gt;{{Cite book| last=Harris | first=Sam | authorlink =Sam Harris (author) | title=The End of Faith | publisher=W.W.

In his research recent brain imaging of religious subjects praying or meditating show identical activity in the respective human section of the brain which [[Ramachandran]] calls God-spots.

[[Psilocybin]] from mushrooms affect regions of the brain includingthe serotonergic system, which generating a sense of strong religious meaning, unity and ecstasy. Certain physical rituals may generate similar feelings.&lt;ref name=Gaps&gt;{{Cite news| last =Bradshaw | first =John | title = A God of the Gaps? | work = Ockham's Razor | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]  | date= 18 June 2006  | url = http://www.abc.net.au/rn/ockhamsrazor/stories/2006/1664571.htm  | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Michael Shermer]]'s book ''Why People Believe Strange Things'' he theorizes on how emerging mankind imposed made-up explanations and bizarre rituals for natural phenomena they didn't and couldn't understand. This is similar to the arguments made by [[Daniel Dennett]] in ''[[Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon|Breaking the Spell]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/225371513|title=Breaking the spell : religion as a natural phenomenon|last=Clement)|first=Dennett, D.

(Daniel|date=2007|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=9780143038337|location=London|oclc=225371513}}&lt;/ref&gt; however Shermer's argument goes further in that the peculiar and at times frightening rituals of religion are but one of many forms of strange customs that survive  to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/144596155|title=Why people believe weird things : pseudoscience, superstition, and other confusions of our time|last=Michael.|first=Shermer,|date=2007|publisher=Souvenir|isbn=9780285638037|location=London|oclc=144596155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immature stage of societal development===
[[File:Daniel Huntington Philosophy and Christian Art.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Natural philosophy|Philosophy]] and [[Christian Art]], W. Ridgway, 1878]]
Philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] posited that many societal constructs pass through [[Law of three stages|three stages]] and that religion corresponds to the two earlier, or more primitive stages by stating: "From the study of the development of human intelligence, in all directions, and through all times, the discovery arises of a great fundamental law, to which it is necessarily subject, and which has a solid foundation of proof, both in the facts of our organization and in our historical experience. The law is this: that each of our leading conceptions – each branch of our knowledge – passes successively through three different theoretical conditions: the theological, or fictitious; the metaphysical, or abstract; and the scientific, or positive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Comte|first=Auguste|title=Course of Positive Philosophy (1830)|url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/comte_cpp.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response to criticism===

In his book ''[[Is Religion Dangerous?]]'', [[Keith Ward]] notes that not all false opinions are delusions and that belief in God is different as many great minds and people who live ordinary lives and believe in God are not irrational people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Ward | first =Keith | authorlink =Keith Ward | title =Is Religion Dangerous? | publisher = Lion| year =2006 | location =London:Lion Hudson Plc | url = | doi = | isbn = 978-0-7459-5262-8 | page =172 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyperreligiosity or even "intensely professed atheism" can emerge from emotional disturbances involving temporal lobe epilepsy.&lt;ref name="Heilman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heilman|first1=Kenneth M.|last2=Valenstein|first2=Edward |title=Clinical Neuropsychology|date=13 October 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English|isbn=9780195384871|page=488|quote=Studies that claim to show no difference in emotional makeup between temporal lobe and other epileptic patients (Guerrant et. al., 1962; Stevens, 1966) have been reinterpreted (Blumer, 1975) to indicate that there is, in fact, a difference: those with temporal lobe epilepsy are more likely to have more serious forms of emotional disturbance. This typical personality of temporal lobe epileptic patient has been described in roughly similar terms over many years (Blumer &amp; Benson, 1975; Geschwind, 1975, 1977; Blumer, 1999; Devinsky &amp; Schachter, 2009). These patients are said to have a deepening of emotions; they ascribe great significance to commonplace events. This can be manifested as a tendency to take a cosmic view; hyperreligiosity (or intensely professed atheism) is said to be common.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have criticized the effects of adherence to dangerous practices such as self-sacrifice.&lt;ref name="self-sacrifice"&gt;Branden, N. (1963), "Mental Health versus Mysticism and Self-Sacrifice," Ayn Rand – The Virtue of Selfishness: A New Concept of Egoism.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jerusalem syndrome===
{{Main|Jerusalem syndrome}}
Jerusalem has loaned its name to a unique psychological phenomenon where Jewish or Christian individuals who develop obsessive religious themed ideas or delusions (sometimes believing themselves to be Jesus Christ or another prophet) will feel compelled to travel to Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jerusalem Syndrome: Jewish Virtual Library|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/jersynd.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jerusalem Syndrome|url=http://savvytraveler.publicradio.org/show/features/2000/20000603/jerusalem.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a period of 13 years (1980–1993) for which admissions to the [[Kfar Shaul Mental Health Centre]] in Jerusalem were analyzed, it was reported&lt;ref name="Bar-El"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1192/bjp.176.1.86 | last1 = Bar-el | first1 = Y | last2 = Durst | first2 = R | last3 = Katz | first3 = G | last4 = Zislin | first4 = J | last5 = Strauss | first5 = Z | last6 = Knobler | first6 = HY. |name-list-format=vanc | year = 2000 | title = Jerusalem syndrome | url = http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/176/1/86 | journal = [[British Journal of Psychiatry]] | volume = 176 | issue = 1| pages = 86–90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that 1,200 tourists with severe, Jerusalem-themed mental problems, were referred to this clinic. Of these, 470 were admitted to hospital. On average, 100 such tourists have been seen annually, 40 of them requiring admission to hospital. About 2 million tourists visit Jerusalem each year.

===Honor killings and stoning===
{{Main|Honor killings|stoning}}
Honor killings once well known in the Western are now extremely rare however they still occur in other parts of the world. An honor is when a person is killed by family for bringing [[honour|dishonor]] or [[shame]] upon the family.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/crimesofhonour_1.shtml#h3 |title=Ethics - Honour crimes |publisher=BBC |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stoning is a form of capital punishment whereby a group throws stones at a person until death ensues.

Until the early 2000s, stoning was a legal form of [[capital punishment]] in Iran.  In 2002, the Iranian judiciary officially placed a moratorium on stoning.&lt;ref name=BBC312&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6288156.stm |title=Iran 'adulterer' stoned to death |date=10 July 2007 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=3 December 2012 |archivedate=4 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Cf5UEbg5?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6288156.stm |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, judiciary spokesman [[Jamal Karimirad]] stated that "in the Islamic republic, we do not see such punishments being carried out", further adding that if stoning sentences were passed by lower courts, they were overruled by higher courts and "no such verdicts have been carried out".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4166137.stm |title=Iran denies execution by stoning |publisher=BBC News |date=11 January 2005 |accessdate=2010-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the judiciary decided to fully scrap the punishment from the books in legislation submitted to parliament for approval.&lt;ref name="afp.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iZ7aTbPW-vzYtgdxmx1O5Iok-CMQ |title=Iran to scrap death by stoning |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |date=August 6, 2008 |accessdate=September 23, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010081413/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iZ7aTbPW-vzYtgdxmx1O5Iok-CMQ |archivedate=October 10, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2013, Iranian parliament published official report about excluding stoning from penal code and it accused Western media for spreading "noisy propaganda" about the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rc.majlis.ir/fa/news/show/831790|title="سنگسار" در شرع حذف شدنی نیست|website=مرکز پژوهش ها}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genital modification and mutilation===
According to the [[World Health Organization]], female [[genital modification and mutilation|genital mutilation]] has no health benefits and is a violation of basic human rights. Though no first tier religious texts prescribe the practice, some practitioners do believe there is religious support for it. While it is mostly found in Muslim countries it is also practiced by some Christian and Animist countries mostly in Africa. GFA is not widely practiced in some Muslim countries making it difficult to separate religion from culture. Some religious leaders promote it, some consider it irrelevant to religion, and others contribute to its elimination". The practice is illegal in all Western countries and it is also illegal to transport a girl to another country to carry out FGM. Multiple parents have been charged for committing this crime in the United Kingdom with those charged being exclusively from Muslim countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/|title=Female genital mutilation|website=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, some have argued that failure to circumcise a baby boy may be unethical because it diminishes his right to good health.&lt;ref name="male circumcision" /&gt;

===Counterarguments to religion as harmful to individuals===
A metareview of 850 research papers on Religion in the [[United States]] concluded that "the majority of well-conducted studies found that higher levels of religious involvement are positively associated with indicators of psychological well-being ([[life satisfaction]], happiness, positive affect and higher morale and with lower rates of depression, suicidal thoughts and behavior and drug/alcohol use/abuse".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | doi = 10.1590/S1516-44462006005000006  | last1= Moreira-Almeida | first1 = Alexander | first2 = Francisco Lotufo |last2=Neto | last3= Koenig |first3= Harold G. | authorlink3=Harold G.

[[John William Draper]] and [[Andrew Dickson White]], authors of the [[conflict thesis]], have argued that when a religion offers a complete set of answers to the problems of purpose, [[morality]], origins, or science, it often discourages exploration of those areas by suppressing curiosity, denies its followers a broader perspective and can prevent social, moral and scientific progress. Examples cited in their writings include the [[Galileo affair|trial of Galileo]] and [[Giordano Bruno]]'s execution.

During the 19th century, the [[conflict thesis]] developed. According to this model, any interaction between religion and science must inevitably lead to open hostility, with religion usually taking the part of the aggressor against new scientific ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wilson|first=David B.|editor=Gary Ferngren|title=Science &amp; Religion: A Historical Introduction|year=2002|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=0-8018-7038-0|chapter=The Historiography of Science and Religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical conflict thesis was a popular [[historiography|historiographical]] approach in the [[history of science]] during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but its original form is almost entirely discarded by scholars today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Russell|first=Colin A.|editor=Gary Ferngren|title=Science &amp; Religion: A Historical Introduction|year=2002|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=0-8018-7038-0|page=7|chapter=The Conflict Thesis |quote=The conflict thesis, at least in its simple form, is now widely perceived as a wholly inadequate intellectual framework within which to construct a sensible and realistic historiography of Western science}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shapin1996"&gt;{{Cite book

==Morality==
{{See also|Human sacrifice|Morality and religion|Religious intolerance}}
[[Richard Dawkins]] contends that [[Theism|theistic religions]] devalue human compassion and morality. In his view, the [[Bible]] contains many injunctions against following one's conscience over scripture and positive actions are supposed to originate not from compassion, but from the fear of punishment.&lt;ref name="The God Delusion" /&gt; [[Albert Einstein]] stated that no religious basis is needed in order to display ethical behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Religion and Science| last=Einstein| first=Albert| newspaper=New York Times Magazine| date=1930-11-09|quote=A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Survey research suggests that believers do tend to hold different views than non-believers on a variety of social, ethical and moral questions. According to a 2003 survey conducted in the United States by [[The Barna Group]], those who described themselves as believers were less likely than those describing themselves as atheists or agnostics to consider the following behaviors morally acceptable: [[cohabitation|cohabitating]] with someone of the opposite sex outside of marriage, enjoying sexual fantasies, having an [[abortion]], sexual relationships outside of marriage, [[gambling]], consuming [[marijuana]], looking at [[pornography|pictures of nudity or explicit sexual behavior]], getting [[drunkeness|drunk]] and "[[homosexuality|having a sexual relationship with someone of the same sex]]".&lt;ref name="Morality Continues to Decay"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040203202833/http://www.barna.org/cgi-bin/PagePressRelease.asp?PressReleaseID=152&amp;Reference=F "The Barna Update: Morality Continues to Decay" (archive copy at the [[Internet Archive]])], [[The Barna Group]], November 3, 2003 ([http://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/5-barna-update/129-morality-continues-to-decay "The Barna Update: Morality Continues to Decay" – Summary version posted on the Barna website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224045707/https://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/5-barna-update/129-morality-continues-to-decay |date=2013-12-24 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===

In the 19th century, philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] argued that teaching some ideas to children at a young age could foster resistance to doubting those ideas later on.&lt;ref&gt;"And as the capacity for believing is strongest in childhood, special care is taken to make sure of this tender age. This has much more to do with the doctrines of belief taking root than threats and reports of miracles. If, in early childhood, certain fundamental views and doctrines are paraded with unusual solemnity, and an air of the greatest earnestness never before visible in anything else; if, at the same time, the possibility of a doubt about them be completely passed over, or touched upon only to indicate that doubt is the first step to eternal perdition, the resulting impression will be so deep that, as a rule, that is, in almost every case, doubt about them will be almost as impossible as doubt about one's own existence."- Arthur Schopenhauer -''On Religion: A Dialogue''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islam]] has permitted the [[child marriage]] of older men to girls as young as 9 years of age.&lt;ref name="seyaj.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Seyaj Organization for the Protection of Children. |url=http://seyaj.org/en/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822141947/http://seyaj.org/en/ |archivedate=August 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baptists|Baptist]] pastor [[Jerry Vines]] denounced Mohammed as a [[pedophile]] for marying and having had sex with a nine-year-old, referring to Muhammad as a "demon-possessed paedophile".&lt;ref name="Vines"&gt;{{Cite news| last=Cooperman | first=Alan | title=Anti-Muslim Remarks Stir Tempest | date=2002-06-20 | publisher=The Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A14499-2002Jun19?language=printer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homosexuals===
[[File:20051129 northlake-il5.jpg|frame|A [[Westboro Baptist Church]] picket in Northlake, Illinois on November 29, 2005]]
{{Main|Homosexuality and religion}}

[[Homosexuality]] is unambiguously condemned in [[Abrahamic religions]] where prohibition and execution of those who engage in male homosexual activity are found in the Old testament of the bible and in the Koran. Homosexuals are also condemned in the New Testament several times but without obligatory punishment. In the United States, conservative [[Christian right]] groups such as the [[Christian Legal Society]] and the [[Alliance Defense Fund]] have filed numerous lawsuits against public universities, aimed at overturning policies that protect homosexuals from discrimination and [[hate speech]]. These groups argue that such policies infringe their [[Freedom of religion|right to freely exercise religion]] as guaranteed by the [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Simon |first=Stephanie |title=Christians Sue for Right Not to Tolerate Policies |work= |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=10 April 2006 | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/1018310011.html?dids=1018310011:1018310011&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+10%2C+2006&amp;author=Stephanie+Simon&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A.1&amp;desc=Christians+Sue+for+Right+Not+to+Tolerate+Policies |accessdate=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most secularised Christian countries have legalised homosexual activity and several have legalised [[same-sex marriage]]. However, not all historically Christian countries have done so such as [[Russia]] and [[Uganda]] which have introduces discriminatory laws ranging from anti-propaganda laws to corporal punishment. Homosexuality is still illegal in most [[Muslim world|Muslim countries]] and several of these countries impose the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] for homosexual behavior. In July 2005, [[Mahmoud Asgari and Ayaz Marhoni|two Iranian men]] aged sixteen and eighteen were, supposedly, hanged for homosexuality, causing an international outcry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Eke |first=Steven |title=Iran 'must stop youth executions' |wor = |language= |publisher=BBC News |date=28 July 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4725959.stm |accessdate=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racism===
[[File:Ku Klux Klan members and a burning cross, Denver, Colorado, 1921.jpg|thumb|Burning cross often used by [[Ku Klux Klan]] to intimidate minorities]]
In line with other findings suggesting that religious humanitarianism is largely directed at in-group members, greater religious identification, greater extrinsic religiosity and greater religious fundamentalism were associated with racial prejudice.  This is congruent with the fact that 50% of religious congregations in the US are [[Racial segregation|racially segregated]], and only 12% have a degree of diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=Deborah L.|last2=Matz|first2=David C.|last3=Wood|first3=Wendy|title=Why Don’t We Practice What We Preach?

Religion has been used by some as justification for advocating [[racism]]. The [[Christian Identity]] movement has been associated with racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Berlet |first = Chip |authorlink = Chip Berlet |year = 2004 |url = http://www.publiceye.org/rightist/idennlns.html |title = A New Face for Racism &amp; Fascism  |work = White Supremacist, Antisemitic, and Race Hate Groups in the U.S.: A Genealogy |publisher = Political Research Associates   |accessdate = 2007-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are arguments that these positions may be as much reflections of contemporary social views as of what has been called [[scientific racism]].&lt;ref&gt;"Ostensibly scientific": cf. Adam Kuper, Jessica Kuper (eds.), ''The social science encyclopedia'' (1996), "Racism", p. 716: "This [''sc. scientific''] racism entailed the use of 'scientific techniques', to sanction the belief in European and American racial superiority"; ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Questions to sociobiology'' (1998), "Race, theories of", p. 18: "Its exponents [''sc. of scientific racism''] tended to equate race with species and claimed that it constituted a scientific explanation of human history"; Terry Jay Ellingson, ''The myth of the noble savage'' (2001), 147ff. "In scientific racism, the racism was never very scientific; nor, it could at least be argued, was whatever met the qualifications of actual science ever very racist" (p. 151); Paul A. Erickson, Liam D. Murphy, ''A History of Anthropological Theory'' (2008), p. 152: "Scientific racism: Improper or incorrect science that actively or passively supports racism".&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] had [[Black people and Mormonism|excluded African Americans]] from the [[Priesthood (LDS Church)|priesthood]] from 1860 to 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=One Nation Under Gods: A History of the Mormon Church|year=2002|first=Richard|last=Abanes|authorlink=Richard Abanes|isbn=1-56858-219-6|publisher=Four Walls Eight Windows}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist Mormon]] [[List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|sects]] within the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], rejected the Church's 1978 decision to allow African Americans to hold the priesthood and continue to deny activity in the church due to race.&lt;ref name="Primergroups"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Primer, Helping Victims of Domestic Violence and Child Abuse in Polygamous Communities: Fundamentalist Mormon Communities |url=http://attorneygeneral.utah.gov/cmsdocuments/The_Primer.pdf |publisher=Utah Attorney General's Office and Arizona Attorney General's Office |accessdate=29 June 2010 |date=June 2006 |page=41 |format=PDF |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

===Women===
{{See also|Gender and religion|Christianity and domestic violence|Islam and domestic violence|Misogyny}}
[[File:Woman walking in Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|A woman with burqa on walking by the road in northern Afghanistan]]

The content of the [[Religious text|holy books]] of [[Abrahamic religions]] contain severe restrictions on the rights of women ranging from prohibiting women from certain behaviour and activities to requiring women to submit to the will of their father and or husband.

According to [[Polly Toynbee]], religion interferes with [[bodily autonomy]] for both genders and fosters particularly negative attitudes towards women's bodies. Toynbee writes: "Women's bodies are always the issue - too unclean to be bishops, and dangerous enough to be covered up by Islam and mikvahed by Judaism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/oct/26/comment.politics|title=Polly Toynbee: A woman's supreme right over her own body and destiny is in jeopardy - Comment is free - The Guardian|author=Polly Toynbee|work=the Guardian|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is argued that religious sexual discrimination leads to unequal relations in [[marriage]], creating norms which subordinate the wife to the husband. The word [[Wiktionary:בעל|בעל]] (''ba`al''), Hebrew for "husband", used throughout the Bible, is synonymous with "owner" and "master".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/library/90607132/religion-and-sexism-images-of-woman-in-the-jewish|title=Religion and Sexism: Images of Woman in the Jewish and Christian Traditions|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mirrors the abrahamic view of God as an omnipotent, perfect power, where this power is one of domination, which is persistently associated with the characteristics of ideal [[masculinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-religion/#toc|title=Feminist Philosophy of Religion|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sheila Jeffreys]] argues: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Religion gives authority to traditional, patriarchal beliefs about the essentially subordinate nature of women and their naturally separate roles, such as the need for women to be confined to the private world of the home and family, that women should be obedient to their husbands, that women's sexuality should be modest and under the control of their menfolk, and that women should not use contraception or abortion to limit their childbearing. The practice of such ancient beliefs interferes profoundly with women's abilities to exercise their human rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=Man%27s+Dominion%3A+The+Rise+of+Religion+and+the+Eclipse+of+Women%27s+Rights&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1|title=Man's Dominion: The Rise of Religion and the Eclipse of Women's Rights - Google Search|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Islam====
[[Feminism|Feminist]] [[Julie Bindel]] argues that religions encourage the domination of men over women and that Islam promotes the submission of women to their husbands and encourages practices such as [[child marriage]]. She wrote that religion "promotes inequality between men and women", that Islam's message for a woman includes that "she will be subservient to her husband and devote her life to pleasing him" and that "Islam's obsession with virginity and childbirth has led to gender segregation and early marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://standpointmag.co.uk/features-may-10-why-do-western-women-convert-julie-bindel-islam-female-conversion|title=Why do Western Women Convert? - Standpoint|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islamic laws]] have been criticized by human rights organizations for exposing women to mistreatment and violence, preventing women from reporting rape and contributing to the discrimination of women.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/afghanistan0312webwcover_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations]] say that Islam is used to justify unnecessary and harmful [[female genital mutilation]], when the purposes range from deprivation of sexual satisfaction to discourage [[adultery]], insuring virginity to their husbands, or generating appearance of virginity.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.unfpa.org/public/News/pid/280 | title=Statement on the International Day Against Female Genital Mutilation | first=Thoraya |last=Ahmed Obaid | publisher = [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA) | date=6 February 2007 | accessdate=2008-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maryam Namazie]] argues that women are victimized under [[Sharia law]], both in criminal matters (such as punishment for improper veiling) and in civil matters; and also that women have judicial hurdles that are lenient or advantageous for men.&lt;ref name="onelawforall.org.uk"&gt;http://www.onelawforall.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/New-Report-Sharia-Law-in-Britain_fixed.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Phyllis Chesler]], Islam is connected to violence against women, especially in the form of honor killings. She rejects the argument that honor killings are not related to Islam and claims that while fundamentalists of all religions place restrictions on women, in Islam not only are these restrictions harsher, but Islam also reacts more violently when these rules are broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meforum.org/2067/are-honor-killings-simply-domestic-violence|title=Are Honor Killings Simply Domestic Violence?|work=Middle East Forum|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christianity====

Christianity has been criticized for painting women as sinful, untrustful, deceiving and desiring to seduce and incite men into sexual sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/2030628/The_Christian_Mens_Oldest_Prejudice_Misogyny_Hate_Or_Fear|title=The Christian Men's Oldest Prejudice: Misogyny, Hate Or Fear?|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Katharine M. Rogers argues that Christianity is misogynistic and that the "dread of female [[seduction]]" can be found in St. Paul's epistles.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Katharine M. ''The Troublesome Helpmate: A History of Misogyny in Literature,'' 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; K. K. Ruthven argues that the "legacy of Christian misogyny was consolidated by the so-called 'Fathers' of the Church, like [[Tertullian]], who thought a woman was not only 'the gateway of the devil' but also 'a temple built over a sewer'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=clOT7Hg2CfAC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=christian+misogyny#v=onepage&amp;q=christian%20misogyny&amp;f=false | title = Feminist literary studies: An introduction | isbn = 978-0-521-39852-7 | author1 = Ruthven | first1 = K.

[[Shechita|Kosher slaughter]] has historically attracted criticism from non-Jews as allegedly being inhumane and unsanitary,&lt;ref name="Shechita-Poland"&gt;{{Cite book|title=No way out: the politics of Polish Jewry, 1935–1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=co3KJikOaBYC&amp;pg=PA81#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|first=Emanuel|last=Melzer|pages=81–90|year=1997|publisher=Hebrew Union College Press|isbn=0-87820-418-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; in part as an [[antisemitic canard]] that eating ritually slaughtered meat caused degeneration&lt;ref name=Poliakov&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History of Anti-semitism: From Voltaire to Wagner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w39m4aohL9gC&amp;pg=PA153#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|first=Léon|last=Poliakov|page=153|year=1968|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-3766-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in part out of economic motivation to remove Jews from the meat industry.&lt;ref name="Shechita-Poland"/&gt; Sometimes these criticisms were directed at Judaism as a religion. In 1893, animal advocates campaigning against kosher slaughter in Aberdeen attempted to link cruelty with Jewish religious practice.&lt;ref name=Aberdeen&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Community on Trial: The Aberdeen Shechita Case, 1893|url=http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/jshs.2010.0103|first=Kenneth|last=Collins|journal=[[Journal of Scottish Historical Studies]]|volume=30|pages=75–92|date=November 2010|doi=10.3366/jshs.2010.0103}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, Polish critics of kosher slaughter claimed that the practice actually had no basis in Scripture.&lt;ref name="Shechita-Poland"/&gt; In contrast, Jewish authorities argue that the slaughter methods are based directly upon Genesis IX:3 and that "these laws are binding on Jews today".&lt;ref name=Chabad2/&gt;

While supporters of [[Shechita|kosher slaughter]] counter that [[Judaism]] requires the practice precisely because it is considered humane,&lt;ref name="Chabad2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/222241/jewish/Why-Do-Jews-Practice-Shechita.htm|title=Why Do Jews Practice Shechita?|author=Shechita UK|work=Chabad.org|publisher=Chabad-Lubavitch Media Center|accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research conducted by [[Temple Grandin]] and Joe M. Regenstein in 1994 concluded that—practiced correctly with proper restraint systems—kosher slaughter results in little pain and suffering and notes that behavioral reactions to the incision made during kosher slaughter are less than those to noises such as clanging or hissing, inversion or pressure during restraint.&lt;ref name="Grandin"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Temple |last1=Grandin |first2=Joe M. |last2=Regenstein|date=March 1994|title=Religious slaughter and animal welfare: a discussion for meat scientists.|journal=Meat Focus International|publisher=CAB International|pages=115–123|url=http://grandin.com/ritual/kosher.slaugh.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; those who practice and subscribe religiously and philosophically to [[Jewish vegetarianism]] disagree, stating that such slaughter is not required while a number, including medieval scholars of [[Judaism]] such as [[Joseph Albo]] and [[Isaac Arama]], regard vegetarianism as a moral [[ideal (ethics)|ideal]], not just out of a concern for [[animal welfare]], but also the slaughterer.&lt;ref name="innernet1"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.innernet.org.il/article.php?aid=107 |title=Contemporary Halakhic Problems |volume=3 |last=Bleich |first=J. David |authorlink=J. David Bleich |publisher=KTAV Publishing House |year=1989 |quote=A number of medieval scholars regard vegetarianism as a moral ideal, not because of a concern for the welfare of animals, but because of the fact that the slaughter of animals might cause the individual who performs such acts to develop negative character traits, viz., meanness and cruelty |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518014142/http://www.innernet.org.il/article.php?aid=107 |archivedate=2012-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of [[ritual slaughter]], such as [[Ritual slaughter#Islamic .E1.B8.8Eab.C4.AB.E1.B8.A5ah|Islamic ritual slaughter]], have also come under controversy. Writing for [[PETA]], Logan Scherer said that animals sacrificed according to Islamic law can not be stunned before they are killed.&lt;ref name="PETA Islam animals"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.peta.org/b/thepetafiles/archive/2009/12/08/the-cruelty-behind-muslim-ritual-slaughter.aspx | title=The Cruelty Behind Muslim Ritual Slaughter | publisher=PETA | date=December 8, 2009 | accessdate=July 25, 2012 | author=Scherer, Logan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Muslims are only allowed to eat meat that has been killed according to Sharia law and they say that Islamic law on ritual slaughter is designed to reduce the pain and distress that the animal suffers.&lt;ref name="BBC Islam Animals"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/animals_1.shtml | title=Treatment of animals: Islam and animals | publisher=BBC | date=August 13, 2009 | accessdate=July 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Farm Animal Welfare Committee]], halal and kosher practices should be banned because when animals are not stunned before death, they suffer needless [[pain]] for up to 2 minutes despite some [[Muslims (ethnicity)|Muslims]] and [[Jews]] arguing that loss of blood from slash to the throat renders the animals unconscious relatively quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Halal and Kosher slaughter 'must end'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2977086.stm|publisher=BBC News | date=2003-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response to criticism of morality===

Not all religions are hostile to homosexuality. Both [[Reform Judaism]] and the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] have advocated for equal rights for gay and lesbian people since the 1970s.{{efn|In 1970, the UUA passed a resolution calling for an end to anti-gay discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uua.org/lgbtq/witness/policy/facts&lt;/ref&gt; The Union for Reform Judaism passed a similar resolution in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrc.org/resources/stances-of-faiths-on-lgbt-issues-reform-judaism&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[Homosexuality and Hinduism|Hinduism]] does not view homosexuality as an issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/dec/04fire.htm] quote - "''Hinduism, unlike Christianity and Islam, does not view homosexuality as a religious sin.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Christians have made efforts toward establishing racial equality, contributing to the [[African-American civil rights movement (1954–1968)|civil rights movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Civil Rights Movement in the United States |work=MSN Encyclopedia Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761580647_2/Civil_Rights_Movement_in_the_United_States.html |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=3 January 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwb3GxQe?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761580647_2/Civil_Rights_Movement_in_the_United_States.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The African American Review'' sees as important the role Christian [[revivalism]] in the [[black church]] played in the civil rights movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title =Religious Revivalism in the Civil Rights Movement | work=African American Review | url =http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2838/is_4_36/ai_97515888 | date= Winter 2002 | accessdate =2007-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], an ordained [[Baptist]] minister, was a leader of the American civil rights movement and president of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]], a Christian civil rights organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Martin Luther King: The Nobel Peace Prize 1964 | publisher =The Nobel Foundation | url =http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1964/king-bio.html | accessdate = 2006-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dominionism===
{{Main|Dominionism}}
{{See also|Dominion theology|Christian reconstructionism}}
The term "[[dominionism]]" is often used to describe a political movement among [[fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christians]]. Critics view dominionism as an attempt to improperly impose Christianity as the national faith of the United States. It emerged in the late 1980s inspired by the book, film and lecture series "Whatever Happened to the Human Race?" by [[Francis Schaeffer|Francis A. Schaeffer]] and [[C. Everett Koop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Diamond | first =Sara | authorlink =Sara Diamond |  title =Spiritual Warfare: The Politics of the Christian Right | publisher =[[South End Press]] | year =1989 | location =Boston | doi =  | id =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schaeffer's views influenced conservatives like [[Jerry Falwell]], [[Pat Robertson]], [[Tim LaHaye]], [[Rutherford Institute|John W. Whitehead]] and although they represent different theological and political ideas, dominionists believe they have a Christian duty to take "control of a sinful secular society", either by putting fundamentalist Christians in office, or by introducing biblical law into the secular sphere.&lt;ref name=berlet1998 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Ansell | first=Amy E | title =Unraveling the Right: The New Conservatism in American Thought and Politics | publisher =Westview Press | year =1998 | location = | url = | doi = | isbn=0-8133-3147-1  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Schaeffer | first =Francis | authorlink =Francis Schaeffer | title =A Christian Manifesto | publisher =Crossway Books | year =1982  | location = | url = | doi = |  isbn=0-89107-233-0  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Social scientists have used the word "dominionism" to refer to adherence to [[dominion theology]]&lt;ref name="Barron1992a"&gt;{{cite book | last=Barron | first=Bruce | year=1992 | title=Heaven on Earth?

'''David Tynan O'Mahony''' (6 July 1936{{spaced ndash}}10 March 2005), better known as '''Dave Allen''', was an Irish [[observational comedy|observational comedian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Double|first1=Oliver|title=Stand-Up! on being a comedian|date=1997|contribution=Dave Allen|publisher=Methuen Publishing|location=London|isbn=978-0413703200|page=140|quote=This was quite an innovation, because up to this point there had been no tradition of observational comedy in British stand-up.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[satire|satirist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gaither|first1=Carl C. &amp; Alma E.|title=Gaither's Dictionary of Scientific Quotations|date=2012|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4614-1114-7|page=906|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially becoming known in Australia during 1963–64, Allen made regular television appearances in the United Kingdom from the later 1960s and until the mid-1980s. The [[BBC]] aired his ''Dave Allen Show'' 1972–1986,&lt;ref&gt;BBC's released DVD (this copy for Sweden and Finland), back side of its cover states (translated from Swedish "The best sketches 1971–1986 with Dave Allen" (a combination of him sitting in his famous chair, drinking, smoking and telling jokes - and his sketches)&lt;/ref&gt; which was also exported to several other European countries.&lt;ref&gt;The mentioned DVD clearly supports at least Sweden and Finland&lt;/ref&gt; His career had a major resurgence during the late 1980s and early 1990s. At the height of his career he was Britain's most controversial comedian, regularly provoking indignation at his frequent highlighting of political hypocrisy and disregard for religious authority. His television shows were also broadcast in the United States, Canada, Sweden, Australia and New Zealand.

==Early life==
David Tynan O'Mahony was born in [[Firhouse]], [[Dublin]], Ireland, the youngest of three sons&lt;ref name="GOC"/&gt; of Gerard "Cully" Tynan O'Mahony, managing editor of ''[[The Irish Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/12/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries | title=Dave Allen: Irreverent comedian whose reflective monologues provoked outrage and delight | first=Stephen | last=Dixon | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | date=12 March 2005 | accessdate=4 January 2014 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an English mother, Jean Archer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?indiv=1&amp;ti=0&amp;r=an&amp;db=ONSmarriage1984&amp;F2=O%27Mahony&amp;F4=1a&amp;F5=1402&amp;F0=Archer&amp;rank=0&amp;gss=angs-d&amp;pcat=BMD_MARRIAGE&amp;fh=0&amp;h=50606886&amp;recoff= |title=Ancestry.com |publisher=Search.ancestry.com |date= |accessdate=6 January 2014|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; His brothers were John and Peter.&lt;ref name="GOC"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Robin Brown (Director) |date=19 April 2013 |title=Dave Allen: God's Own Comedian |medium=Television documentary |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01s94tc |accessdate =12 November 2014 |location=London |publisher=[[BBC Two]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Mahony left school aged 16, after attending the secondary school at [[Newbridge College]], [[Terenure College]] and the [[Catholic University School]], and followed his father into [[journalism]]. He joined the ''Drogheda Argus'' as a [[copy boy]], but at the age of 19 went to [[London]].

==Career==
He drifted through a series of jobs, before becoming a [[Redcoats (Butlins)|Butlins Redcoat]] at [[Skegness]] in a troupe that also included the British jazz trumpeter and writer [[John Chilton]].  At the end of each summer season he did stand-ups at [[Striptease|strip]] clubs and for the next four years appeared in night clubs, theatres and working men's clubs. When entertainment work was slow he sold toys in a [[Sheffield]] store and also worked as a door-to-door draught-excluder salesman.  He changed his stage surname to "Allen" on the prompting of his agent, who believed that few people in Britain could pronounce "O'Mahony" correctly. Allen himself hoped that a surname beginning with "A" would put him at the top of any agent's list.

Allen lost the top of his left forefinger above the middle knuckle after catching it in a machine cog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sarah |last=Caden |date=20 February 2005 |url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/fingered-at-last-the-truth-behind-the-comedians-missing-digit-26205189.html |title=Fingered at last: the truth behind the comedian's missing digit |publisher=[[Irish Independent]] |accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he enjoyed inventing stories to explain the loss, which became a minor part of his act. One version was that his brother John had surprised him by snapping his jaw shut when they were children, resulting in him biting it off. A further explanation he gave on his programme, ''Dave Allen at Large'', was that he often stuck his finger in his whiskey glass, and it had been eaten away by strong drink. He also said it was worn away from repeatedly brushing the dust from his suit. One of his stand-up jokes was that, when he was a boy, he and his friends would go see a cowboy movie at the local cinema, then come out all ready to play Cowboys and Indians. Staring down at his truncated finger, he would mutter, "I had a sawn-off shotgun." On his show he told a long, elaborate ghost story, ending with "something evil" attacking Allen in a dark and haunted house. Allen grabbed and bit the attacker, the studio lights came back up, and it was his own left hand.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;Story related in "Dave Allen at Peace", Telemovie 9partially fictionalised), BBC, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen's first television appearance was on the BBC talent show ''New Faces'' in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/collections/p00btrgb/video/p00fprzc/spike_milligans_q_the_cash_machine/ "Great Irish Comedians"], BBC Comedy  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321163125/http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/collections/p00btrgb/video/p00fprzc/spike_milligans_q_the_cash_machine/ |date=21 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He hosted pop music shows in the early 1960s, including tours by [[Adam Faith]] and [[Helen Shapiro]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.flickr.com/photos/bradford_timeline/5548903853/in/set-72157626323725628/ |title=Helen Shapiro tour programme, 1961 |author=Bradford Timeline |work=Flickr |year=2011 |accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in early 1963 was the compère of a [[The Beatles Winter 1963 Helen Shapiro Tour|tour of Britain]], headlined by Shapiro, that also included [[The Beatles]], then starting to become well known. In 1962 he had toured [[South Africa]] with American vaudeville star [[Sophie Tucker]], whom he described as "one of the most charming and delightful performers with whom I have ever worked". Tucker was impressed with him and suggested that he try his luck in Australia. Moving there, he worked with [[Digby Wolfe]] on Australian television, becoming Wolfe's resident comedian.

While on tour in Australia in 1963, he quickly proved successful and accepted an offer to headline a television talk show with [[Nine Network|Channel 9]], ''Tonight with Dave Allen'', which was also successful. However, only six months after his television début he was banned from the Australian airwaves when, during a live broadcast, he told his show's producer—who had been pressing him to go to a commercial break—to "go away and masturbate", so that he could continue an entertaining interview with [[Peter Cook]] and [[Dudley Moore]]. The ban was dropped quietly as Allen's popularity continued unabated.

Allen returned to the United Kingdom in 1964 and made a number of appearances on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], including ''The Blackpool Show'' and ''[[Val Parnell]]'s [[Sunday Night at the London Palladium]]'', and on the BBC on ''[[Val Doonican|The Val Doonican Show]]''. In 1967 he hosted his own comedy/chat series, ''Tonight with Dave Allen'', made by [[Associated Television|ATV]], which earned him the [[Variety, the Children's Charity|Variety Club's]] ITV Personality of the Year Award.

He signed with the BBC in 1968 and appeared on ''The Dave Allen Show'', a variety/comedy sketch series. This was followed from 1971-79 by ''Dave Allen at Large''.  The theme tune for ''The Dave Allen Show'' and ''Dave Allen at Large'', written by [[Alan Hawkshaw]], was "Blarney's Stoned" (originally recorded for [[KPM Musichouse|KPM]] in 1969 under the title "Studio 69").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/features/tvthemes2.htm 'Off the telly' website]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228123122/http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/features/tvthemes2.htm |date=28 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shows introduced his solo joke-telling-while-sitting-on-a-stool-and-drinking routine. This stand-up routine by Allen led to sketches that continued the themes touched on in the preceding monologues. Meanwhile, he began to appear in theatre. In 1972 he acted as a doctor in the [[Royal Court Theatre|Royal Court]]'s production of [[Edna O'Brien]]'s play ''A Pagan Place''. With family friend [[Maggie Smith]]&lt;ref name="GOC"/&gt; in the lead, he appeared in ''[[Peter Pan]]'' in a run during 1973&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1485435/Dave-Allen.html |title=Dave Allen |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=12 March 2005 |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group|TMG]] |location=[[London, UK|London]] |issn=0307-1235 |oclc=49632006 |accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1974. Allen played the roles of [[George Darling (Peter Pan)|Mr Darling]] and [[Captain Hook]] in the production at the [[London Coliseum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bruce K. |last=Hanson |title=Peter Pan on Stage and Screen: 1904–2010 |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |publisher=McFarland |year=2011 |page=354}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen made ''The Dave Allen Show in Australia'' (1975–1977) for his old employers, Channel 9.

Allen was also a social commentator, appearing in several television documentaries for ITV, beginning with ''Dave Allen in the Melting Pot'' (1969), looking at life in [[New York City]] and dealing with issues such as racism and drugs. Later programmes included ''Dave Allen in Search of the Great English Eccentric'' (1974) and ''Eccentrics at Play'' (1974), in which he looked at [[Eccentricity (behavior)|colourful characters]] with idiosyncratic passions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hayward|first=Anthony |title=Dave Allen (obituary)|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/dave-allen-5838.html |accessdate=6 January 2014 |newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=12 March 2005|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Both the BBC and Dave Allen received death threats from the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] and the [[Provisional IRA]]" {{cn|date=November 2018}}
 
Allen's satirizing of religious ritual, especially Catholic, throughout each episode of ''Dave Allen at Large'' caused minor controversy, which - coupled with sometimes comparatively frank material - earned the show a risqué reputation. In 1977 the Irish state broadcaster [[Radio Telefís Éireann|RTÉ]] placed a ''[[de facto]]'' ban on Allen. Routines included sketches showing the Pope (played by Allen) and his cardinals doing a striptease to music ("[[The Stripper]]") on the steps of [[St. Peter's Basilica|St Peter's]], aggressive priests beating their parishioners and other priests, priests who spoke like [[Dalek]]s through electronic confessionals, and an extremely excitable Pope who spoke in a [[Chico Marx]] style accent as he ordered Allen to "getta your bum outta Roma!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Essential Dave Allen |year=2005 |editor-first=Graham |editor-last=McCann |publisher=Hodder and Stoughton |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 he played a troubled property man suffering a mid-life crisis in [[Alan Bennett]]'s television play ''One Fine Day''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137997/ |title=One Fine Day (TV Movie 1979) |work=IMDb |year=2014  |accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; New seasons of the comedy series, now titled ''Dave Allen'', were broadcast from 1981 until 1990.

===Later career===
His final series for the BBC in 1990 caused controversy with a joke:&lt;ref name="Newley"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Newley|first=Patrick|date=March 2005|title=Obituaries: Dave Allen|journal=The Stage|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/obituaries/2005/03/dave-allen/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plunkett"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/mar/11/broadcasting.uknews|title=Dave Allen dies aged 68 |last=Plunkett|first=John|date=11 March 2005|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1990/jan/16/offensive-language|title=Offensive Language|date=16 January 1990|work=Hansard HC Deb|pages=vol 165 c173W|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|We spend our lives on the run. We get up by the clock, eat and sleep by the clock, go to work by the clock, get up again, go to work – and then we retire. And what do they fucking give us? A clock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxNz_9FlxNw|title=Video of Show|date=11 January 1990|work="offensive language"|accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This prompted MP [[Robert Hayward]] to ask a [[question time|parliamentary question]] about "offensive language" in broadcasting.&lt;ref name="Newley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Plunkett" /&gt; In 1993 Allen returned to ITV, where he starred in the ''Dave Allen Show'', which was his final regular television series.

By the late 1990s Allen was living quietly in semi-retirement at home in [[Holland Park]], west London. A keen amateur artist, he continued to exhibit his paintings.&lt;ref name = "telegraph"/&gt; He had given up cigarettes in the 1980s, having smoked regularly during earlier television appearances. A comedy skit in 1994 talked not only about quitting smoking but hating the smell of smoke. The 90s saw him make occasional chat show appearances and discuss his career in the six-part ''The Unique Dave Allen'' (BBC, 1998), in between clips from his past BBC series.

As he grew older, he brought a rueful awareness of aging to his material, with reflections on the antics of teenagers and the sagging skin and sprouting facial hair of age. He was presented with a lifetime achievement award at the [[British Comedy Awards]] in 1996.

==Material==
===Act===
Allen's act was typified by a relaxed, rueful and intimate style. He sat on a high bar stool facing his audience, smoking and occasionally sipping from a glass of what he always allowed people to assume was whiskey but in fact was merely ginger ale with ice. He was a sober-minded man, and although he sometimes appeared crotchety and irritable on stage he always gave off an air of charm and serene melancholy, both in his act and in real life. Each day he pored over newspapers, scribbling notes and ideas for his routines. Along with his seated stand-up routines his television shows were interspersed with filmed sketch comedy.

===Religion===
He was a religious sceptic&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1485435/Dave-Allen.html |title=Dave Allen obituary |publisher=''Daily Telegraph'' |date=11 March 2005 |accessdate=29 May 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; (according to Allen, "what you might call a practising [[Atheism|atheist]]", and often joked, "I'm an atheist, thank God") as a result of his deeply held objections to the rigidity of his strict Catholic schooling. Consequently religion became an important subject for his humour, especially the Roman Catholic Church and the [[Church of England]], generally mocking church customs and rituals rather than beliefs. In 1998 he explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The hierarchy of everything in my life has always bothered me. I'm bothered by power. People, whoever they might be, whether it's the government, or the policeman in the uniform, or the man on the door—they still irk me a bit. From school, from the first nun that belted me—people used to think of the nice sweet little ladies—they used to knock the fuck out of you, in the most cruel way that they could. They'd find bits of your body that were vulnerable to intense pain—grabbing you by the ear, or by the nose, and lift you, and say 'Don't cry!' It's very hard not to cry. I mean, not from emotion, but pain. The priests were the same. And I sit and watch politicians with great cynicism, total cynicism.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the end of his act Allen always raised his glass and quietly toasted his audience with the words "Goodnight, thank you, and may your God go with you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/10026098/Dave-Allen-Gods-Own-Comedian-BBC2-review.html|title=Dave Allen – God's Own Comedian, BBC2, review|first=Martin|last=Chilton|date=28 December 2014|newspaper=Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on others==
Highly regarded in Britain, Allen's comic technique and style had a lasting influence on many young British comedians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_1999_May/ai_54738758/ |title=Mark Thomas: method and madness of a TV comic |first=Amy |last=Otchet |work=[[UNESCO Courier]] |year=May 1999 |accessdate=21 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126160232/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_1999_May/ai_54738758/ |archivedate=26 January 2012 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; His targets were often figures of authority, his style was observational rather than gag-driven, and his language frequently ripe;  as such he was a progenitor for the "alternative" comedians of the 1980s. In his native Ireland, he always remained somewhat controversial. His mocking of the Catholic Church made him unpopular amongst some Irish Catholics, while his mocking of the [[Ulster]] Protestant leader [[Ian Paisley, Baron Bannside|Ian Paisley]] made him unpopular amongst many [[Protestantism in Ireland|Protestants]] in [[Northern Ireland]].  

In a 2017 interview with [[Howard Stern]], [[Adam Sandler]] attributed Dave Allen as one of his first comedic influences when he saw his act at the Nevele hotel at the age of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-O3VjdmbzA|title=Howard Stern Show April 12 2017|first=|last=|date=13 April 2017|publisher=Howard Stern|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1964 Allen married actress Judith Stott, whom he had met in Australia. The marriage ended in divorce in 1983. Their son, Edward James Tynan O'Mahony (professionally Ed Allen), is also a comedian.

Allen's hobbies included painting, which he became increasingly enthusiastic about in his later years. His first exhibition, ''Private Views'', was held in [[Edinburgh]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ZvGmocvz_SYJ:https://www.scotsman.com/news/celebrity/final-bow-for-comic-who-put-the-alternative-into-comedy-1-739337+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=jp=|title=Final Bow for Comic who put the Alternative into Comedy |publisher=[[The Scotsman]] |date=  12 March 2005|accessdate=8 January 2017 |location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He died peacefully in his sleep as a result of [[Sudden arrhythmic death syndrome]] at his home in [[Kensington]], London, on 10 March 2005 at the age of 68. He was survived by Karin Tynan O'Mahony (née Stark), his wife of 18 months who had been his partner since 1986,&lt;ref name="GOC"/&gt; and his three children from his first marriage: his children Edward and Jane, and stepson Jonathan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-428602/Dave-Allen-leaves-3m--adopted-daughter.html |title=Dave Allen leaves £3m in his will... but nothing to his adopted daughter |publisher=[[Mail Online]] |date= 13 January 2007|accessdate=6 January 2014 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; a son of his first wife. Three weeks after Allen's death Karin gave birth to their son, Cullen.

A dramatisation of Allen's life and career, entitled ''Dave Allen At Peace'', was shown on [[RTÉ One]] and [[BBC Two]] in 2018, with [[Aidan Gillen]] portraying the comedian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2018/14/daveallen |title=BBC programme information, |accessdate=25 March 2018 |publisher=BBC Media Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''declaration of faith''' is a phrase that is said by a member of any [[religion]] to show either to themselves, their [[God]] or other members of the religion their belief and faith in the religion. Notable declarations of faith include the [[Sign of the Cross]] in [[Christianity]], the [[Shahadah]] in [[Islam]] and the [[Shema Yisrael]] in [[Judaism]].

There are numerous other declarations of faith, typically performed during religious rituals in many faiths. Often, the declaration of faith is led by the leader of the congregation and followers respond in kind.

'''Enlightenment''' is the "full comprehension of a situation".&lt;ref group="web" name="merriam-webster1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/enlightenment |title=enlightenment - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2007-04-25 |accessdate=2009-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is commonly used to denote the [[Age of Enlightenment]],{{refn|group=note|"Mankind's final coming of age, the emancipation of the human consciousness from an immature state of ignorance and error."{{sfn|Porter|2001|p=1}}}} but is also used in Western cultures in a religious context. It translates several Buddhist terms and concepts, most notably ''[[bodhi]]'',{{refn|group=note|When referring to the Enlightenment of the Buddha (''samma-sambodhi'') and thus to the goal of the [[Noble Eightfold Path|Buddhist path]], the word ''enlightenment'' is normally translating the Pali and Sanskrit word ''[[bodhi]]''}} ''[[kensho]]'' and ''[[satori]]''. Related terms from Asian religions are ''[[moksha]]'' (liberation) in [[Hinduism]],  ''[[Kevala Jnana]]'' in [[Jainism]], and ''ushta'' in [[Zoroastrianism]].

In Christianity, the word "enlightenment" is rarely used, except to refer to the Age of Enlightenment and its influence on Christianity. Roughly equivalent terms in Christianity may be [[Illuminationism|illumination]], [[kenosis]], [[metanoia (theology)|metanoia]], [[revelation]], [[salvation]] and [[Religious conversion|conversion]].

[[Perennial philosophy|Perennialists]] and [[Universalism|Universalists]] view enlightenment and [[mysticism]] as equivalent terms for religious or spiritual insight.
[[File:Kevalajnana.jpg|right|thumb|left|[[Mahavira]] attaining enlightenment.]]

==Western understanding==
In the Western world the concept of ''enlightenment'' in a religious context acquired a [[Romanticism|romantic]] meaning. It has become synonymous with [[self-realization]] and the [[True self and false self|true self]], which is being regarded as a substantial essence which is covered over by social conditioning.{{refn|group=note|[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] was an important influence on the development of this idea. See for example [[Rajneesh#Ego and the mind|Osho's teachings]] for a popularisation of this idea.}}

===As 'Aufklärung'===
{{Main article|Age of Enlightenment}}

The use of the Western word ''enlightenment'' is based on the supposed resemblance of ''bodhi'' with ''[[Age of Enlightenment|Aufklärung]]'', the independent use of reason to gain insight into the true nature of our world. As a matter of fact there are more resemblances with [[Romanticism]] than with the Enlightenment: the emphasis on feeling, on intuitive insight, on a true essence beyond the world of appearances.{{sfn|Wright|2000|p = 181-183}}

===Awakening: Historical period of renewed interest in religion===
The equivalent term "awakening" has also been used in a Christian context,&lt;ref&gt;J. Rixey Ruffin, ''A Paradise of Reason: William Bentley and Enlightenment Christianity in the Early Republic'', 0195326512, 9780195326512, 9781435620407 Oxford University Press 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; namely the [[Great Awakening]]s, several periods of [[Christian revival|religious revival]] in [[Religion in the United States|American religious history]]. Historians and theologians identify three or four waves of increased religious enthusiasm occurring between the early 18th century and the late 19th century. Each of these "Great Awakenings" was characterized by widespread revivals led by evangelical Protestant ministers, a sharp increase of interest in religion, a profound sense of conviction and redemption on the part of those affected, an increase in evangelical church membership, and the formation of new religious movements and denominations.

===Illumination===
{{Main article|Divine illumination}}

Another equivalent term is [[Illuminationism]], which was also used by Paul Demieville in his work ''The Mirror of the Mind'', in which he made a distinction between "illumination subie" and "illumination graduelle".{{sfn|Demieville|1991}}&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/Miscellaneous/ChanZenStudies.htm Bernard Faure, ''Chan/Zen Studies in English: The State Of The Field'']&lt;/ref&gt; Illuminationism is a [[doctrine]] according to which the process of human thought needs to be aided by divine grace. It is the oldest and most influential alternative to [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] in the [[theory of mind]] and [[epistemology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/illumination/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was an important feature of ancient [[Greek philosophy]], [[Neoplatonism]], [[medieval philosophy]], and in particular, the Illuminationist school of [[Islamic philosophy]].

[[Augustine]] was an important proponent of Illuminationism, stating that everything we know is taught to us by God as He casts His light over the world,&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://churchandpomo.typepad.com/conversation/2008/11/illumination-an.html ''Illumination and Enlightenment'']&lt;/ref&gt; saying that "The mind needs to be enlightened by light from outside itself, so that it can participate in truth, because it is not itself the nature of truth. You will light my lamp, Lord," &lt;ref&gt;''Confessions'' IV.xv.25&lt;/ref&gt; and "You hear nothing true from me which you have not first told me."&lt;ref&gt;''ibid'' X.ii.2&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine's version of illuminationism is not that God gives us certain information, but rather gives us insight into the truth of the information we received for ourselves.

===Romanticism and transcendentalism===
{{See also|Buddhist modernism|Transcendentalism|Perennial philosophy}}

This romantic idea of enlightenment as insight into a timeless, transcendent reality has been popularized especially by [[D.T. Suzuki]].&lt;ref group="web"&gt;[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/CriticalZen/whose%20zen_sharf.pdf Robert H. Sharf, ''Whose Zen?

Its History and Method]&lt;/ref&gt; Further popularization was due to the writings of [[Heinrich Dumoulin]].{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A}}{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-B}}&lt;ref group="web"&gt;[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/HistoricalZen/McRaeIntroduction.pdf Critical introduction by John McRae to the reprint of Dumoulin's ''A history of Zen'']&lt;/ref&gt; Dumoulin viewed metaphysics as the expression of a transcendent truth, which according to him was expressed by Mahayana Buddhism, but not by the pragmatic analysis of the oldest Buddhism, which emphasizes [[anatta]].{{sfn|Dumonlin|2000}} This romantic vision is also recognizable in the works of [[Ken Wilber]].{{sfn|Wilber|1996}}

In the oldest Buddhism this essentialism is not recognizable.{{sfn|Warder|2000|p = 116-124}}&lt;ref group="web"&gt;[http://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/publications/nlarc/Pruning_the_bodhi_tree.htm Nanzan Institute: Pruning the bodhi Tree]&lt;/ref&gt; According to critics it doesn't really contribute to a real insight into Buddhism:&lt;ref group="web"&gt;[http://meaningness.wordpress.com/2011/08/12/effing-the-ineffable/ David Chapman: Effing the ineffable]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experience===
{{main article|Religious experience}}

A common reference in Western culture is the notion of "enlightenment ''experience''". This notion can be traced back to [[William James]], who used the term "religious experience" in his book, ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]''.{{sfn|Hori|1999|p = 47}} [[Wayne Proudfoot]] traces the roots of the notion of "religious experience" further back to the German theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768–1834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. The notion of "religious experience" was used by Schleiermacher to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique.{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}

It was popularised by the [[Transcendentalists]], and exported to Asia via missionaries.{{sfn|King|2002}} Transcendentalism developed as a reaction against 18th-century rationalism, [[John Locke]]'s philosophy of [[Sensualism]], and the predestinationism of New England Calvinism. It is fundamentally a variety of diverse sources such as Hindu texts like the [[Vedas]], the [[Upanishads]] and the [[Bhagavad Gita]],{{sfn|Versluis|2001|p = 3}} various religions, and [[German idealism]].{{sfn|Hart|1995}}

It was adopted by many scholars of religion, of which William James was the most influential.{{sfn|Sharf|2000|p = 271}}{{refn|group=note|James also gives descriptions of conversion experiences. The Christian model of dramatic conversions, based on the role-model of Paul's conversion, may also have served as a model for Western interpretations and expectations regarding "enlightenment", similar to Protestant influences on Theravada Buddhism, as described by Carrithers: "It rests upon the notion of the primacy of religious experiences, preferably spectacular ones, as the origin and legitimation of religious action. But this presupposition has a natural home, not in Buddhism, but in Christian and especially Protestant Christian movements which prescribe a radical conversion."{{sfn|Carrithers|1983|p=18}} See Sekida for an example of this influence of William James and Christian conversion stories, mentioning Luther{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=196-197}} and St. Paul.{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=251}} See also McMahan for the influence of Christian thought on Buddhism.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}}}

The notion of "experience" has been criticised.{{sfn|Sharf|1995-B}}{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p = 282-286}}{{sfn|Low|2006|p = 12}} Robert Sharf points out that "experience" is a typical Western term, which has found its way into Asian religiosity via western influences.{{sfn|Sharf|1995-B}}{{refn|group=note|Robert Sharf: "[T]he role of experience in the history of Buddhism has been greatly exaggerated in contemporary scholarship. Both historical and ethnographic evidence suggests that the privileging of experience may well be traced to certain twentieth-century reform movements, notably those that urge a return to ''[[zazen]]'' or ''[[vipassana]]'' meditation, and these reforms were profoundly influenced by religious developments in the west [...] While some adepts may indeed experience "altered states" in the course of their training, critical analysis shows that such states do not constitute the reference point for the elaborate Buddhist discourse pertaining to the "path".{{sfn|Sharf|1995-C|p=1}}}} The notion of "experience" introduces a false notion of duality between "experiencer" and "experienced", whereas the essence of kensho is the realisation of the "non-duality" of observer and observed.{{sfn|Hori|1994|p = 30}}{{sfn|Samy|1998|p = 82}} "Pure experience" does not exist; all experience is mediated by intellectual and cognitive activity.{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p = 282}}{{sfn|Samy|1998|p = 80-82}} The specific teachings and practices of a specific tradition may even determine what "experience" someone has, which means that this "experience" is not the ''proof'' of the teaching, but a ''result'' of the teaching.{{sfn|Samy|1998|p = 80}} A pure consciousness without concepts, reached by "cleaning the doors of perception",{{refn|group=note|[[William Blake]]: "If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thru' narrow chinks of his cavern."&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.quotedb.com/quotes/2653 Quote DB]&lt;/ref&gt;}} would be an overwhelming chaos of sensory input without coherence.{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p = 284}}

Nevertheless, the notion of religious experience has gained widespread use in the study of religion,{{sfn|Spilka|2003|p = 246-289}} and is extensively researched.{{sfn|Spilka|2003|p = 246-289}}

==Asian cultures and religions==

===Buddhism===
{{main article|Enlightenment in Buddhism}}
The English term  "enlightenment" has commonly been used to translate several Sanskrit, Pali,&lt;ref group="web"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=pali&amp;query=enlightenment&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8 |title=The Pali Text Society's Pali-English dictionary |publisher=Dsal.uchicago.edu |accessdate=2009-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese and Japanese terms and concepts, especially ''[[bodhi]]'', ''[[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajna]]'', ''[[kensho]]'', ''[[satori]]'' and [[buddhahood]].

''Bodhi'' is a [[Theravada]] term. It literally means "awakening" and "understanding". Someone who is awakened has gained insight into [[Four Noble Truths|the workings of the mind]] which keeps us imprisoned in craving, suffering and [[Saṃsāra|rebirth]],&lt;ref group="web" name="merriam-webster1" /&gt; and has also gained insight into [[Noble Eightfold Path|the way]] that leads to ''[[nirvana]]'', the liberation of oneself from this imprisonment.

''Prajna'' is a [[Mahayana]] term. It refers to insight into our true nature, which according to [[Madhyamaka]] is [[Sunyata|empty]] of a personal essence in the stream of experience. But it also refers to the ''[[Tathāgata-garbha]]'' or [[Buddha-nature]], the essential basic-consciousness beyond the stream of experience.

In [[Zen]], ''kensho'' means "seeing into one's true nature".{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}} ''Satori'' is often used interchangeably with ''kensho'', but refers to the ''experience'' of ''kensho''.{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}}

Buddhahood is the attainment of full awakening and becoming a [[Buddha]]. According to the Tibetan [[Thubten Yeshe]],&lt;ref group="web"&gt;[http://www.lamayeshe.com/index.php?sect=article&amp;id=508 Lama Yeshe]&lt;/ref&gt; enlightenment full awakening; buddhahood. The ultimate goal of Buddhist practice, attained when all limitations have been removed from the mind and one's positive potential has been completely and perfectly realized. It is a state characterized by infinite compassion, wisdom and skill.&lt;ref group=web name=lamayeshe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lamayeshe.com/index.php?sect=static&amp;subsect=glossary#enlightenment|title=Lama Yeshe Wisdom Archive|location=Lincoln, MA, USA |accessdate=December 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
In [[Indian religion]]s ''moksha'' ([[Sanskrit]]: {{lang|sa|मोक्ष}} ''{{IAST|mokṣa}}''; liberation) or ''mukti'' ([[Sanskrit]]: {{lang|sa|मुक्ति}}; release —both from the root ''{{IAST|muc}}'' "to let loose, let go") is the final extrication of the [[soul]] or consciousness (''purusha'') from ''[[samsara]]'' and the bringing to an end of all the [[suffering]] involved in being subject to the cycle of repeated death and  [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] ([[reincarnation]]).

====Advaita Vedanta====
{{Main article|Advaita Vedanta|Neo-Advaita}}

''Advaita Vedanta'' ([[IAST]] ''{{IAST|Advaita Vedānta}}''; [[Sanskrit]]: अद्वैत वेदान्त {{IPA-sa|əd̪ʋait̪ə ʋeːd̪ɑːnt̪ə|}}) is a [[List of philosophical concepts|philosophical concept]] where followers seek liberation/release by recognizing identity of the Self (Atman) and the Whole (Brahman) through long preparation and training, usually under the guidance of a [[guru]], that involves efforts such as knowledge of scriptures, renunciation of worldly activities, and inducement of direct identity experiences. Originating in India before 788 AD, Advaita Vedanta is widely considered the most influential{{sfn|Indich|1995}} and most dominant&lt;ref group="web"&gt;[http://www.class.uidaho.edu/ngier/GB.htm ''Gandhi And Mahayana Buddhism'', Journal of Oriental Studies 35:2 (1996), pp. 84-105 (accessdate=2011-06-10)]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Zelliot|1980}} sub-school of the [[Vedānta]] (literally, ''end or the goal of the [[Vedas]]'', [[Sanskrit]]) school of [[Hindu philosophy]].{{sfn|Deutsch|1988}} Other major sub-schools of [[Vedānta]] are ''{{IAST|[[Vishishtadvaita|Viśishṭādvaita]]}}'' and ''[[Dvaita]]''; while the minor ones include [[Suddhadvaita]], [[Dvaitadvaita]] and [[Achintya Bhedabheda]].

''Advaita'' (literally, ''[[non-dual]]ity'') is a system of thought where "Advaita" refers to the identity of the Self (''[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]'') and the Whole ([[Brahman]]).{{refn|group=note|"Brahman" is not to be confused with [[Brahma]], the Creator and one third of the [[Trimurti]] along with [[Shiva]], the Destroyer and [[Vishnu]], the Preserver.}} Recognition of this identity leads to liberation. Attaining this liberation takes a long preparation and training under the guidance of a guru.

The key source texts for all schools of Vedānta are the [[Prasthanatrayi]]—the canonical texts consisting of the [[Upanishad]]s, the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and the [[Brahma Sutras]]. The first person to explicitly consolidate the principles of Advaita Vedanta was [[Adi Shankara|Shankara Bhagavadpada]],{{sfn|Collinson|1994}} while the first historical proponent was [[Gaudapada]], the guru of Shankara's guru [[Govinda Bhagavatpada]].

=====Philosophical system=====
Shankara systematized the works of preceding philosophers.{{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p = 680}} His system of Vedanta introduced the method of scholarly exegesis on the accepted metaphysics of the Upanishads. This style was adopted by all the later Vedanta schools.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Shankara's synthesis of Advaita Vedanta is summarized in this quote from the {{IAST|[[Viveka Chudamani|Vivekacūḍāmaṇi]]}}, one of his {{IAST|[[Adi Shankara#Prakaraṇa graṃtha|Prakaraṇa graṃthas]]}} (philosophical treatises):{{refn|group=note|The authorship of this work is disputed. Most 20th-century academic scholars feel it was not authored by Sankara, and [[Sacchidanandendra Saraswati|Swami Sacchidanandendra Saraswathi]] of Holenarsipur concurs.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;In half a couplet I state, what has been stated by crores of texts;&lt;br/&gt;
that is [[Brahman]] alone is real, the world is mithyā (not independently existent),&lt;br/&gt;
and the individual self is nondifferent from Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;Shankara, Vivekacūḍāmaṇi&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|{{IAST|slokārdhena pravaksāmi yaduktaṃ granthakotibhih, brahma satyaṃ jagat mithyā, jīvo brahmaiva nāparah}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=====Neo-Vedanta=====
{{Main article|Hindu reform movements|Swami Vivekananda|Ramakrishna Mission}}

In the 19th century, Vivekananda played a major role in the [[Hindu reform movements|revival of Hinduism]],{{sfn|Dense|1999|p = 191}} and the spread of Advaita Vedanta to the West via the [[Ramakrishna Mission]]. His interpretation of Advaita Vedanta has been called "Neo-Vedanta".{{sfn|Mukerji|1983}}

In a talk on "The absolute and manifestation" given in at London in 1896 [[Swami Vivekananda]] said,
{{quote|I may make bold to say that the only religion which agrees with, and even goes a little further than modern researchers, both on physical and moral lines is the Advaita, and that is why it appeals to modern scientists so much. They find that the old dualistic theories are not enough for them, do not satisfy their necessities. A man must have not only faith, but intellectual faith too".&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_2/Jnana-Yoga/The_Absolute_and_Manifestation |title=The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 2/Jnana-Yoga/The Absolute and Manifestation - Wikisource |publisher=En.wikisource.org |date=2008-04-05 |accessdate=2011-06-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110628193348/http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_2/Jnana-Yoga/The_Absolute_and_Manifestation| archivedate= 28 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Vivekananda emphasized [[samadhi]] as a means to attain liberation.{{sfn|Comans|1993}} Yet this emphasis is not to be found in the Upanishads nor in Shankara.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p = 307}} For Shankara, meditation and [[Nirvikalpa|Nirvikalpa Samadhi]] are means to gain knowledge of the already existing unity of Brahman and Atman,{{sfn|Comans|1993}} not the highest goal itself:
{{quote|[Y]oga is a meditative exercise of withdrawal from the particular and identification with the universal, leading to contemplation of oneself as the most universal, namely, Consciousness. This approach is different from the classical yoga of complete thought suppression.{{sfn|Comans|1993}}}}

Vivekenanda's modernisation has been criticized:{{sfn|Mukerji|1983}}{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}}
{{quote|Without calling into question the right of any philosopher to interpret Advaita according to his own understanding of it, [...] the process of Westernization has obscured the core of this school of thought. The basic correlation of renunciation and Bliss has been lost sight of in the attempts to underscore the cognitive structure and the realistic structure which according to Samkaracarya should both belong to, and indeed constitute the realm of māyā.{{sfn|Mukerji|1983}}}}

=====Neo-Advaita=====
{{Main article|Neo-Advaita}}

''Neo-Advaita'' is a [[new religious movement]] based on a modern, Western interpretation of [[Advaita Vedanta]], especially the teachings of [[Ramana Maharshi]].{{sfn|Lucas|2011}} Neo-Advaita is being criticized{{sfn|Marek|2008|p = 10, note 6}}{{refn|group=note|Marek: "Wobei der Begriff Neo-Advaita darauf hinweist, dass sich die traditionelle Advaita von dieser Strömung zunehmend distanziert, da sie die Bedeutung der übenden Vorbereitung nach wie vor als unumgänglich ansieht.

It can even be termed 'pseudo' because, by presenting the teaching in a highly attenuated form, it might be described as purporting to be Advaita, but not in effect actually being so, in the fullest sense of the word.

====Yoga====
{{Main article|Yoga}}

The prime means to reach moksha is through the practice of yoga ([[Sanskrit]], [[Pāli]]: {{lang|inc|[[:wikt:योग|योग]]}}, /ˈjəʊɡə/, ''{{IAST|yoga}}'') is a commonly known generic term for [[Human body|physical]], [[mind|mental]], and [[soul|spiritual]] disciplines which originated in [[ancient India]].{{sfn|Baptiste|2011}}{{sfn|Yogani|2011}} Specifically, yoga is one of the six ''[[Āstika and nāstika|āstika]]'' ("orthodox") schools of [[Hindu philosophy]]. It is based on the ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali]]''. Various traditions of yoga are found in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]].{{sfn|Lardner Carmody|1996|p = 68}}{{sfn|Sarbacker|2005|p = 1–2}}{{refn|group=note|Tattvarthasutra [6.1]{{sfn|Doshi|2007}}}}

Pre–philosophical speculations and diverse ascetic practices of first millennium BCE were systematized into a formal philosophy in early centuries CE by the ''Yoga Sutras of Patanjali''.{{sfn|Whicher|1998|p = 38–39}} By the turn of the first millennium, [[Hatha yoga]] emerged as a prominent tradition of yoga distinct from the Patanjali's ''Yoga Sutras''. While the ''Yoga Sutras'' focus on discipline of the mind, Hatha yoga concentrates on health and purity of the body.{{sfn|Larson|2008|p = 139–140}}

Hindu monks, beginning with [[Swami Vivekananda]], brought yoga to the West in the late 19th century. In the 1980s, yoga became popular as a physical system of health exercises across the Western world. Many studies have tried to determine the effectiveness of yoga as a complementary intervention for cancer, schizophrenia, asthma and heart patients. In a national survey, long-term yoga practitioners in the United States reported musculo–skeletal and mental health improvements.{{sfn|Birdee|2008}}

=====Jnana yoga=====
{{Main article|Jnana yoga}}

Classical Advaita Vedanta emphasises the path of ''jnana yoga'', a progression of study and training to attain [[moksha]].

=====Bhakti yoga=====
{{Main article|Bhakti}}

The paths of ''bhakti yoga'' and ''karma yoga'' are subsidiary.

In bhakti yoga, practice centers on the worship God in any way and in any form, like [[Krishna]] or [[Ayyappa]]. Adi Shankara himself was a proponent of devotional worship or ''[[Bhakti]]''. But Adi Shankara taught that while Vedic sacrifices, ''[[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]'' and devotional worship can lead one in the direction of ''jnana'' (true knowledge), they cannot lead one directly to ''[[moksha]]''. At best, they can serve as means to obtain moksha via shukla gati.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

=====Karma yoga=====
{{Main article|Karma yoga}}

Karma yoga is the way of doing our duties, in disregard of personal gains or losses. According to Sri Swami Sivananda,
{{quote|Karma Yoga is consecration of all actions and their fruits unto the Lord. Karma Yoga is performance of actions dwelling in union with the Divine, removing attachment and remaining balanced ever in success and failure.

Karma Yoga is selfless service unto humanity. Karma Yoga is the Yoga of action which purifies the heart and prepares the Antahkarana (the heart and the mind) for the reception of Divine Light or attainment of Knowledge of the Self. The important point is that you will have to serve humanity without any attachment or egoism.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.dlshq.org/teachings/karmayoga.htm Sri Swami Sivananda, ''Karma Yoga'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Jainism===
{{Main article|Jainism|Kevala Jnana|Mahavira}}

Jainism ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|eɪ|n|ɪ|z|əm}}; {{lang-sa|जैनधर्म}} ''{{IAST|Jainadharma}}'', {{lang-ta|சமணம்}} ''Samaṇam'', {{lang-bn|জৈনধর্ম}} ''{{IAST|Jainadharma}}'', {{lang-te|జైనమతం}} ''{{IAST|Jainamataṁ}}'', {{lang-ml|ജൈനമതം}} ''Jainmat'',  {{lang-kn|ಜೈನ ಧರ್ಮ}} ''{{IAST|Jaina dharma}}''), is an [[Indian religions|Indian religion]] that prescribes a path of [[Ahimsa in Jainism|non-violence]] towards all [[Jiva|living beings]]. Its philosophy and practice emphasize the necessity of self-effort to move the [[Jiva|soul]] toward divine consciousness and [[Moksa (Jainism)|liberation]]. Any soul that has conquered its own inner enemies and achieved the state of supreme being is called a ''jina'' ("conqueror" or "victor"). The ultimate status of these perfect souls is called [[siddha]]. Ancient texts also refer to Jainism as ''[[shramana]] dharma'' (self-reliant) or the "path of the [[nirgrantha|nirgantha]]s" (those without attachments or aversions).

In [[Jainism]] highest form of pure knowledge a soul can attain is called [[Kevala Jnana]] ( Sanskrit : केवलज्ञान )or Kevala Ṇāṇa (Prakrit : केवल णाण).  which means “absolute or perfect” and Jñāna, which means "knowledge". Kevala is the state of isolation of the jīva from the ajīva attained through ascetic practices which burn off one's karmic residues, releasing one from bondage to the cycle of death and rebirth. Kevala Jñāna thus means infinite knowledge of self and non-self, attained by a soul after annihilation of the all  [[Karma in Jainism#Ghatiya karmas|ghātiyā karmas]]. The soul which has reached this stage achieves [[Moksa (Jainism)|moksa]] or liberation at the end of its life span.

[[Mahavira]], 24th thirthankara of Jainism, is said to have practised rigorous austerities for 12 years before he attained enlightenment,

{{quote|During the thirteenth year, in the second month of summer, in the fourth fortnight, the light (fortnight) of Vaisakha, on its tenth day, when the shadow had turned towards the east and the first wake was over, on the day called Suvrata, in the Muhurta called Vigaya, outside of the town Grimbhikagrama on the bank of the river Rjupalika, not far from an old temple, in the field of the householder Samaga, under a Sal tree, when the moon was in conjunction with the asterism [[Nakshatra#Nakshatra descriptions|Uttara Phalguni]], (the Venerable One) in a [[squatting position]] with joined heels, exposing himself to the heat of the sun, after fasting two and a half days without drinking water, being engaged in deep meditation, reached the highest knowledge and intuition, called Kevala, which is infinite, supreme, unobstructed, unimpeded, complete, and full.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}}}

Kevala Jñāna is one of the five major events in the life of a [[Tirthankara]] and is known as Jñāna Kalyanaka and supposedly celebrated by all gods. Mahavira’s Kaivalya was said to have been celebrated by the demi-gods, who constructed the [[Samosarana]] or a grand preaching assembly for him.

==Western culture==
===Christianity===
{{See also|Religious conversion|Divinization (Christian)}}

The word "enlightenment" is not generally used in Christian contexts for religious understanding or insight. More commonly used terms in the Christian tradition are [[religious conversion]] and [[revelation]].

[[Lewis Sperry Chafer]] (1871–1952), one of the founders of [[Dispensationalism]], uses the word "[[illuminism]]". Christians who are "illuminated" are of two groups, those who have experienced true illuminism (biblical) and those who experienced false illuminism (not from the Holy Spirit).{{sfn|Chafer|1993|p = 12–14}}

Christian interest in eastern spirituality has grown throughout the 20th century. Notable Christians, such as [[Hugo Enomiya-Lassalle]] and [[Ama Samy|AMA Samy]], have participated in Buddhist training and even become Buddhist teachers themselves. In a few places Eastern contemplative techniques have been integrated in Christian practices, such as centering prayer.&lt;ref group="web"&gt;[http://www.centeringprayer.com/ Contemplative Outreach: Centering Prayer]&lt;/ref&gt; But this integration has also raised questions about the borders between these traditions.&lt;ref group="web"&gt;[http://www.innerexplorations.com/ewtext/chen.htm Inner Explorations: Christian Enlightenment?]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western esotericism and mysticism===
{{Main article|Mysticism|Western esotericism|Perennial philosophy}}
Western and Mediterranean culture has a rich tradition of [[esotericism]] and [[mysticism]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996}} The [[Perennial philosophy]], basic to the [[New Age]] understanding of the world, regards those traditions as akin to [[Eastern religions]] which aim at awakening/ enlightenment and developing wisdom. The hypothesis that all mystical traditions share a "common core",{{sfn|Hood|2001|p = 32}} is central to New Age, but contested by a diversity of scientists like Katz and Proudfoot.{{sfn|Hood|2001|p = 32}}

[[Judaism]] includes the mystical tradition of [[Kabbalah]]. [[Islam]] includes the mystical tradition of [[Sufism]]. In the [[Fourth Way]] teaching, enlightenment is the highest state of Man (humanity).{{sfn|Ouspensky|year unknown}}

===Nondualism===
{{Main article|Nondualism|New Age|Syncretism|Neo-Advaita}}

A popular western understanding sees "enlightenment" as "nondual consciousness", "a primordial, natural awareness without subject or object".&lt;ref group="web"&gt;[http://undividedjournal.com/about-the-journal/ Undivided Journal, ''About the Journal'']&lt;/ref&gt; It is used interchangeably with Neo-Advaita.

This nondual consciousness is seen as a common stratum to different religions. Several definitions or meanings are combined in this approach, which makes it possible to recognize various traditions as having the same essence.{{sfn|Katz|2007}} According to Renard, many forms of religion are based on an experiential or intuitive understanding of "the Real"{{sfn|Renard|2010|p = 59}}

This idea of nonduality as "the central essence"{{sfn|Wolfe|2009|p = iii}} is part of a modern mutual exchange and synthesis of ideas between western spiritual and esoteric traditions and Asian religious revival and reform movements.{{refn|group=note|See McMahan, "The making of Buddhist modernity"{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} and Rambachan, "The Limits of Scripture: Vivekananda's Reinterpretation of the Vedas"{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}} for descriptions of this mutual exchange.}} Western predecessors are, among others, [[New Age]],{{sfn|Hanegraaf|1996}} [[Ken Wilber|Wilber's]] synthesis of western psychology and Asian spirituality, the idea of a [[Perennial Philosophy]], and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]. Eastern influences are the [[Hindu reform movements]] such as [[Shri Aurobindo|Aurobindo's]] Integral Yoga and [[Swami Vivekananda|Vivekananda's]] [[Advaita Vedanta#Neo-Vedanta|Neo-Vedanta]], the [[Vipassana movement]], and [[Buddhist modernism]]. A truly syncretistic influence is [[Rajneesh|Osho]]{{sfn|Swartz|2010|p = 306}} and the [[Rajneesh movement]], a hybrid of eastern and western ideas and teachings, and a mainly western group of followers.{{sfn|Aveling|1999}}

==Cognitive aspects==
===Religious experience as cognitive construct===
"Religious experiences" have "evidential value",{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p = 25}} since they confirm the specific worldview of the experiencer:{{sfn|Yandell|1994}}{{sfn|Sharf|1995-B}}{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}}
{{quote|These experiences are ''cognitive'' in that, allegedly at least, the subject of the experience receives a reliable and accurate view of what, religiously considered, are the most important features of things. This, so far as their religious tradition is concerned, is what is most important about them. This is what makes them "salvific" or powerful to save.{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=18}}}}

Yet, just like the very notion of "religious experience" is shaped by a specific [[discourse]] and [[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]], the "uniformity of interpretation"{{sfn|Spilka|2003|p = 259}} may be due to the influence of religious traditions which shape the interpretation of such experiences.{{sfn|Spilka|2003|p = 259}}{{sfn|Sharf|1995-B}}{{sfn|Berger|1990}}{{sfn|Yandell|1994}}

===Various religious experiences===
Yandell discerns various "religious experiences" and their corresponding doctrinal settings, which differ in structure and phenomenological content, and in the "evidential value" they present.{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p = 19-23}} Yandell discerns five sorts:{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p = 23-31}}
# [[Numinous]] experiences – [[Monotheism]] (Jewish, Christian, Vedantic, Sufi Islam){{sfn|Yandell|1994|p = 24-26}}
# [[Nirvana|Nirvanic]] experiences – [[Buddhism]],{{sfn|yandell|1994|p = 24-25, 26-27}} "according to which one sees that the self is but [[Anatta|a bundle of fleeting states]]"{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p = 24-25}}
# [[Kevala Jnana|Kevala]] experiences{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p = 30}} – [[Jainism]],{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p = 25}} "according to which one sees the self as an indestructible subject of experience"{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p = 25}}
# [[Moksha]] experiences{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p = 29}} – Hinduism,{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p = 25}} Brahman "either as a cosmic person, or, quite differently, as qualityless"{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p = 25}}
# Nature mystical experience{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p = 30}}

===Cognitive science===
{{Main article|Cognitive science|Cognitive science of religion}}

Various philosophers and cognitive scientists state that there is no [[True self and false self|"true self"]] or a "little person" ([[homunculus]]) in the brain that "watches the show," and that consciousness is an [[Emergent properties|emergent property]] that arise from the various modules of the brain in ways that are yet far from understood.{{sfn|Dennett|1992}}{{sfn|Ramachandran|2012}}{{sfn|Damassio|2012}} According to Susan Greenfield, the "self" may be seen as a composite,{{sfn|Greenfield|2000}} whereas [[Douglas R. Hofstadter]] describes the sense of "I" as a result of cognitive process.{{sfn|Hofstadter|2007}}

This is in line with the Buddhist teachings, which state that
{{quote|[...] what we call 'I' or 'being,' is only a combination of physical and mental aggregates which are working together interdependently in a flux of momentary change within the law of cause and effect, and that there is nothing, permanent, everlasting, unchanging, and eternal in the whole of existence.{{sfn|Rahula|1959|p=66}}}}

To this end, Parfit called Buddha the "first [[Personal identity#The bundle theory of the self|bundle theorist]]".{{sfn|Parfit|1987}}

The idea that the mind is the result of the activities of neurons in the brain was most notably popularized by [[Francis Crick]], the co-discoverer of DNA, in his book [[The Astonishing Hypothesis]].{{sfn|Crick|1994}}{{refn|group=note|Crick, after his work on DNA focused his remaining research activities on the brain basis of consciousness.}} The basic idea can be traced back to at least [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac]]. According to Crick, the idea was not a novel one:
{{quote|[...] an exceptionally clear statement of it can be found in a well known paper by [[Horace Barlow]].{{sfn|Crick|1994}}}}

===Entheogens===
{{See also|Entheogen}}
Several users of entheogens [[Entheogenic drugs and the archaeological record|throughout the ages]] have claimed spiritual enlightenment with the use of these substances, their use and prevalence through history is well recorded, and continues today.  In modern times we have seen increased interest in these practices, for example the rise of interest in [[Ayahuasca]]. The psychological effects of these substances have been subject to scientific research focused on understanding their physiological basis.

==Definition==
Ethical monotheism originated within non-missionizing [[Judaism]] to the exclusion of other gods or higher powers in the biblical period.&lt;ref name=IJS&gt;{{cite web|title=CORE ETHICAL TEACHINGS OF JUDAISM|url=http://www.ijs.org.au/The-Ethical-Teachings-of-Judaism/default.aspx|website=ijs.org.au|publisher=Ian Lacey and Josie Lacey|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} It is evident in many different religions, such as Zoroastrianism, Christianity, Islam, Bahá'í Faith, Sikhism, and many more; all of these religions carry the belief of having one sole higher power, who controls everything that occurs in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Nikiprowetzky, V. (1975). Ethical monotheism. (2 ed., Vol. 104, pp. 69-89). New York: The MIT Press Article Stable. {{jstor|20024331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally, ethical monotheism implied the adherence to the non-physical, non-[[Matter|corporeal]], [[eternity|eternal]], and in no way [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] "[[God in Judaism|God of Abraham]], God of Isaac, and God of Jacob" (''[[Amidah#Structure of the weekday Amidah|Elohei Avraham, Elohei Yitzchak ve Elohei Ya`aqov]]'').{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} This original form of ethical monotheism is based on practice, tradition and—to some—the logical result of questions concerning the origin of the world, rather than arrived at as the conclusion of a [[Philosophy|philosophical]] argument. The worship of other gods that were not present at the [[Mattan Torah|revelation on Mount Sinai]], in particular the [[God in Christianity#The Son|God in Christianity]], is referred to as ''[[Avodah Zarah|avodah zarah]]'' in Judaism, and it is traditionally believed that there are neither other pagan gods nor other ([[Incarnation|incarnated]]) divine personages.

The God of ethical monotheism is worshiped in [[Islamization|Islam]] and in [[Bahá'í Faith]], but can also be the [[Zoroastrian]] higher divine uncreated spirit named [[Ahura Mazda]], and in [[Sikhism]] the [[Supreme Being]] or the creator of all named [[Waheguru]]. In [[Christianity]] the original God of ethical monotheism is worshiped as part of the [[Trinity]], or as part of [[non-trinitarian]] conceptions of God.&lt;ref name=HuffingtonPost&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weber Bederman|first1=Diane|title=The True Meaning of Ethical Monotheism|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/diane-bederman/what-is-ethical-monotheis_b_4993438.html|accessdate=26 December 2014|issue=Chaplain:Religion is an affair of the mind and heart.|publisher=TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.|date=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other gods are variously considered to be [[False god|false]] or [[demon]]ic, and it is believed that any other gods cannot be compared to the one true God.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, A.

'''Flagellation'''  (Latin ''flagellum'', "whip"), '''flogging''', '''whipping''' or '''lashing''' is the act of beating the human body with special implements such as [[whip]]s, [[wikt:lash|lash]]es, [[Birching|rod]]s, [[Switch (rod)|switches]], the [[cat o' nine tails]], the [[sjambok]], the [[knout]], etc. Typically, flogging is imposed on an unwilling subject as a punishment; however, it can also be submitted to willingly, or performed on oneself, in religious or [[impact play|sadomasochistic contexts]].

The strokes are usually aimed at the unclothed back of a person, in certain settings it can be extended to other corporeal areas. For a moderated subform of flagellation, described as ''bastinado'', the soles of a person's [[barefoot|bare feet]] are used as a target for beating (see [[foot whipping]]).

In some circumstances the word "flogging" is used loosely to include any sort of [[corporal punishment]], including [[birching]] and [[caning]]. However, in British legal terminology, a distinction was drawn (and still is, in one or two colonial territories) between "flogging" (with a [[cat-o'-nine-tails]]) and "whipping" (formerly with a whip, but since the early 19th century with a birch). In Britain these were both abolished in 1948.

==Current use as punishment==
{{main|Judicial corporal punishment}}
Officially abolished in most Western countries, flogging or whipping, including [[foot whipping]] in some countries, is still a common punishment in some parts of the world, particularly in [[Application of Islamic law by country|countries using Islamic law]] and in some territories formerly under British rule. Medically supervised [[caning]] is routinely ordered by the courts as a penalty for some categories of crime in [[Caning in Singapore|Singapore]], [[Caning in Brunei|Brunei]], [[Caning in Malaysia|Malaysia]], Indonesia, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and elsewhere.

Flogging is a form of punishment used under Islamic [[Sharia]] law. It is the prescribed punishment (''[[hudud]]'') for offences including fornication, alcohol use and slander and is also widely favoured as a discretionary punishment (''[[ta'zir]]'') for many offences, such as violating gender interaction laws (''[[zina]]''). Punishment is normally carried out in public. However, some scholars maintain that this goes against the teachings of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://islamqa.info/en/ref/72338/rape |title=Ruling on the crime of rape |date=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Islam, lashes for punishment for women are often performed with the Qu'ran under one arm to minimise the swing and as a reminder of the source of legislation. They are not supposed to leave permanent scars, and when the number of lashes is high, are frequently done in batches to minimise risk of harm.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Judaism===
{{Main|Corporal punishment (Judaism)}}

According to the [[Torah]] (Deuteronomy 25:1-3)  and [[Rabbinic law]] lashes may be given for offenses that do not merit capital punishment, and may not exceed 40. However, in the absence of a [[Sanhedrin]], corporal punishment is not practiced in Jewish law. [[Halakha]] specifies the lashes must be given in sets of three, so the total number cannot exceed 39. Also, the person whipped is first judged whether they can withstand the punishment, if not, the number of whips is decreased. [[Halakha|Jewish law]] limited flagellation to forty strokes, and in practice delivered thirty-nine, so as to avoid any possibility of breaking this law due to a miscount.

===Antiquity===
{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}
In [[Sparta]], young men were flogged as a test of their masculinity.

In the [[Roman Empire]], flagellation was often used as a prelude to [[crucifixion]], and in this context is sometimes referred to as '''[[Scourge|scourging]]'''. Whips with small pieces of metal or bone at the tips were commonly used. Such a device could easily cause disfigurement and serious trauma, such as ripping pieces of flesh from the body or loss of an eye. In addition to causing severe pain, the victim would approach a state of [[Hypovolemia|hypovolemic shock]] due to loss of blood.

The Romans reserved this treatment for non-citizens, as stated in the ''lex Porcia'' and ''lex Sempronia'', dating from 195 and 123 BC. The poet [[Horace]] refers to the ''horribile flagellum'' (horrible whip) in his ''Satires''. Typically, the one to be punished was stripped naked and bound to a low pillar so that he could bend over it, or chained to an upright pillar so as to be stretched out. Two [[lictor]]s (some reports indicate scourgings with four or six lictors) alternated blows from the bare shoulders down the body to the soles of the feet. There was no limit to the number of blows inflicted&amp;mdash;this was left to the lictors to decide, though they were normally not supposed to kill the victim. Nonetheless, [[Livy]], [[Suetonius]] and [[Josephus]] report cases of flagellation where victims died while still bound to the post. Flagellation was referred to as "half death" by some authors, as many victims died shortly thereafter. [[Cicero]] reports in ''In Verrem'', ''"{{lang|la|pro mortuo sublatus brevi postea mortuus}}"'' ("taken away for a dead man, shortly thereafter he was dead").

===From Middle Ages to modern times===
[[File:Supplice du Grand Knout.jpg|thumb|Punishment with a [[knout]]. Russia, 18th century.]]
The Whipping Act was passed in [[England]] in 1530. Under this legislation, [[vagrancy (people)|vagrant]]s were to be taken to a nearby populated area "and there tied to the end of a cart naked and beaten with whips throughout such market town till the body shall be bloody".&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Whipping|volume=28|pages=590–591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, offenders (mostly those convicted of theft) were usually sentenced to be flogged "at a cart's tail" along a length of public street, usually near the scene of the crime, "until his [or her] back be bloody". In the late seventeenth century, however, the courts occasionally ordered that the flogging should be carried out in prison or a [[house of correction]] rather than on the streets. From the 1720s courts began explicitly to differentiate between private whipping and public whipping. Over the course of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries the proportion of whippings carried out in public declined, but the number of private whippings increased. The public whipping of women was abolished in 1817 (after having been in decline since the 1770s) and that of men ended in the early 1830s, though not formally abolished until 1862. Private whipping of men in prison continued and was not abolished until 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/static/Punishment.jsp#corporal London lives]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1948 abolition did not affect the ability of a prison's visiting justices (in England and Wales, but not in Scotland, except at Peterhead) to order the birch or cat for prisoners committing serious assaults on prison staff. This power was not abolished until 1967, having been last used in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.corpun.com/counukj.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whipping occurred during the French Revolution, though not as official punishment. On 31 May 1793, the Jacobin women seized a revolutionary leader, [[Anne Josephe Theroigne de Mericourt]], stripped her naked, and flogged her on the bare bottom in the public garden of the [[Tuileries]].  After this humiliation, she refused to wear any clothes, in memory of the outrage she had suffered.&lt;ref&gt;Roudinesco, Elisabeth (1992). ''Madness and Revolution: The Lives and Legends of Theroigne de Mericourt'', Verso. {{ISBN|0-86091-597-2}}. p.198&lt;/ref&gt; She went mad and ended her days in an asylum after the public whipping.

In the [[Russian Empire]], [[knout]]s were used to flog criminals and political offenders. Sentences of a hundred lashes would usually result in death. Whipping was used as a punishment for [[Serfdom in Russia|Russian serfs]].&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, Tim (2001). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EJCOl7S0UYgC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Imperial Russia, 1801-1905]''. Routledge. p.83. {{ISBN|0-415-23110-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use against slaves===
[[File:Cicatrices de flagellation sur un esclave.jpg|thumb|200px|An African-American slave named [[Gordon (slave)|Gordon]], photo taken at Baton Rouge, 1863. The scars are clearly visible because of [[keloid]] formation.]]

Whipping has been used as a form of discipline on slaves. It was frequently carried out during the period of [[slavery in the United States]], by slave owners and their slaves. The power was also given to slave "patrollers," mostly poor whites, who had among their powers the ability to whip any slave who violated the [[slave codes]].

===Flogging as military punishment===
In the 18th and 19th centuries, European armies administered floggings to common soldiers who committed breaches of the military code.

====United States====
During the [[American Revolutionary War]], the American Congress raised the legal limit on lashes from 39 to 100 for soldiers who were convicted by courts-martial.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, p 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, officers were not flogged. However, in 1745, a [[cashiering|cashiered]] British officer's sword could be broken over his head, among other indignities inflicted on him.&lt;ref&gt;Tomasson, p 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the urging of [[New Hampshire]] Senator [[John P. Hale]], the [[United States]] Congress banned flogging on all U.S. ships on 28 September 1850, as part of a then-controversial amendment to a naval appropriations bill.&lt;ref name=Congress&gt;Hodak, George. [http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/congress_bans_maritime_flogging/ "Congress Bans Maritime Flogging"]. ''ABA Journal''. September 1850, p. 72. Retrieved 18 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://legisworks.org/congress/31/session-1/chap-80.pdf 31st Congress, Session 1, Chapter 80 (1850), p515.] Quote: ''"''Provided'', That flogging in the navy, and on board vessels of commerce, be, and the same is hereby, abolished from and after the passage of this act."''&lt;/ref&gt; Hale was inspired by [[Herman Melville]]'s "vivid description of flogging, a brutal staple of 19th century naval discipline" in Melville's "novelized memoir" ''[[White Jacket]]''.&lt;ref name=Congress /&gt; Melville also included a vivid depiction of flogging, and the circumstances surrounding it, in his more famous work, ''[[Moby-Dick]]''.

Military flogging was abolished in the United States Army on 5 August 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of the United States Army|last=Weigley|first=Russell|publisher=|year=1984|isbn=978-0253203236|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The punishment was abolished in the [[Royal Navy]] in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.victorianweb.org/history/armyrefs.html Cardwell's Army Reforms 1870--1881]"&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
Flogging was a common disciplinary measure in the [[Royal Navy]] that became associated with a seaman's manly disregard for pain.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.rmg.co.uk/explore/sea-and-ships/facts/ships-and-seafarers/life-at-sea-in-the-age-of-sail Life at sea in the age of sail]". National Maritime Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; Aboard ships, [[knittles]] or the [[cat o' nine tails]] was used for severe formal punishment, while a "rope's end" or "starter" was used to administer informal, on-the-spot discipline. In severe cases a person could be "flogged around the fleet": a significant number of lashes (up to 600) was divided among the ships on a station and the person was taken to all ships to be flogged on each.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Grint, The Arts of Leadership, 2000, {{ISBN|0191589330}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=rJ6yjNy___AC&amp;pg=PA238, pp.237-238]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1879 a motion to abolish flogging in the Royal Navy was debated in the House of Commons. [[John O'Connor Power]], the member for Mayo, asked the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] to bring the navy cat-of-nine-tails to the [[House of Commons Library|Commons Library]] so that the members might see what they were voting about.  It was the Great "Cat" Contention, "Mr Speaker, since the Government has let the cat out of the bag, there is nothing to be done but to take the bull by the horns." [[Poet Laureate]] [[Ted Hughes]] celebrates the occasion in his poem, "Wilfred Owen's Photographs": "A witty profound Irishman calls/For a 'cat' into the House, and sits to watch/The gentry fingering its stained tails./Whereupon ...Quietly, unopposed,/The motion was passed."&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Ted, "Wilfred Owen's Photographs", ''Lupercal'', 1960. See also Stanford, Jane, ''That Irishman: the Life and Times of John O'Connor Power'', 2011, pp. 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the maximum number of lashes that could be inflicted on soldiers in the British Army reached 1,200. This many lashes could permanently disable or kill a man. [[Charles Oman]], historian of the [[Peninsular War]], noted that the maximum sentence was inflicted "nine or ten times by general court-martial during the whole six years of the war" and that 1,000 lashes were administered about 50 times.&lt;ref&gt;Oman, p 239.&lt;/ref&gt; Other sentences were for 900, 700, 500 and 300 lashes. One soldier was sentenced to 700 lashes for stealing a beehive.&lt;ref&gt;Oman, p 246.&lt;/ref&gt; Another man was let off after only 175 of 400 lashes, but spent three weeks in the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Oman, p 254.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the war, the more draconian punishments were abandoned and the offenders shipped to New South Wales instead, where more whippings often awaited them. (See [[Flagellation#Australian penal colonies|Australian penal colonies]] section.) Oman later wrote: {{quote|If anything was calculated to brutalize an army it was the wicked cruelty of the British military punishment code, which [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] to the end of his life supported. There is plenty of authority for the fact that the man who had once received his 500 lashes for a fault which was small, or which involved no moral guilt, was often turned thereby from a good soldier into a bad soldier, by losing his self-respect and having his sense of justice seared out. Good officers knew this well enough, and did their best to avoid the cat-of-nine-tails, and to try more rational means{{mdash}}more often than not with success.&lt;ref&gt;Oman, p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The 3rd battalion's [[Royal Anglian Regiment]] nickname of "The Steelbacks" is taken from one of its former regiments, the [[48th (Northamptonshire) Regiment of Foot]] who earned the nickname for their stoicism when being flogged with the cat-o'-nine tails ("Not a whimper under the lash"), a routine method of administering punishment in the Army in the 18th and early 19th centuries.

====France====
Meanwhile, during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] the French Army stopped floggings altogether. The [[King's German Legion]] (KGL), which were German units in British pay, did not flog. In one case, a British soldier on detached duty with the KGL was sentenced to be flogged, but the German commander refused to carry out the punishment. When the British 73rd Foot flogged a man in occupied France in 1814, disgusted French citizens protested against it.&lt;ref&gt;Rothenberg, p.179.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Singapore====
{{Main|Caning in Singapore}}
One of few countries where corporal punishment is still officially used in the armed forces is [[Singapore]], where military legislation provides that errant soldiers can be sentenced by court-martial to strokes of the cane. It is also used for crimes including but not limited to rape, vandalism and molestation etc.

=== Australian penal colonies ===
[[File:FremantletPrisonWhippingPost 2005 SeanMcClean.jpg|thumb|[[Fremantle Prison]] whipping post.]]
{{See also|History of Australia}}

Once common in the [[British Army]] and British [[Royal Navy]] as a means of discipline, flagellation also featured prominently in the British [[penal colony|penal colonies]] in [[early colonial Australia]]. Given that convicts in Australia were already "imprisoned", punishments for offenses committed there could not usually result in imprisonment and thus usually consisted of corporal punishment such as [[hard labour]] or flagellation. Unlike Roman times, British law explicitly forbade the combination of corporal and [[capital punishment]]; thus, a convict was either flogged or hanged but never both.

Flagellation took place either with a single whip or, more notoriously, with the [[cat o' nine tails]]. Typically, the offender's upper half was bared and he was suspended by the wrists beneath a tripod of wooden beams (known as 'the triangle').  In many cases, the offender's feet barely touched ground, which helped to stretch the skin taut and increase the damage inflicted by the whip.  It also centered the offender's weight in his shoulders, further ensuring a painful experience.

With the prisoner thus stripped and bound, either one or two floggers administered the prescribed number of strokes, or "lashes," to the victim's back. During the flogging, a doctor or other medical worker was consulted at regular intervals as to the condition of the prisoner.  In many cases, however, the physician merely observed the offender to determine whether he was conscious.  If the prisoner passed out, the physician would order a halt until the prisoner was revived, and then the whipping would continue.

Female convicts were also subject to flogging as punishment, both on the convict ships and in the penal colonies. Although they were generally given fewer lashes than males (usually limited to 40 in each flogging), there was no other difference between the manner in which males and females were flogged.

Floggings of both male and female convicts were public, administered before the whole colony's company, assembled especially for the purpose.  In addition to the infliction of pain, one of the principal purposes of the flogging was to humiliate the offender in front of his mates and to demonstrate, in a forceful way, that he had been required to submit to authority.

At the conclusion of the whipping, the prisoner's lacerated back was normally rinsed with [[brine]], which served as a crude and painful disinfectant.

Flogging still continued for years after independence. The last person flogged in Australia was [[William John O'Meally]] in 1958 in [[Melbourne]]'s [[HM Prison Pentridge|Pentridge Prison]].

==As a religious practice==

[[File:Striding flagellant.jpg|thumb|Self-flagelation is ritually performed in the [[Philippines]] during Holy Week (on [[Good Friday]], before Easter).]]
{{Main|Self-flagellation}}

===Antiquity===
During the [[Ancient Roman religion|Ancient Roman festival]] of [[Lupercalia]] young men ran through the streets with thongs cut from the hide of goats which had just been sacrificed, and women who wished to conceive put themselves in their way to receive blows, apparently mostly on the hands.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The eunuch priests of the goddess [[Cybele]], the ''[[galli]]'', flogged themselves until they bled during the annual festival called [[Dies sanguinis]]. [[Greco-Roman mysteries|Greco-Roman mystery religions]] also sometimes involved ritual flagellation, as famously depicted in the [[Villa of the Mysteries]] at [[Pompeii]], apparently showing initiation into the [[Dionysian Mysteries]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Christianity===
[[Image:Flagellants.png|thumb|[[Flagellants]]. From a fifteenth-century woodcut.]]

[[Flagellation of Christ|''The Flagellation'', in a Christian context]], refers to an episode in the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]] prior to [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus' crucifixion]]. The practice of [[mortification of the flesh]] for religious purposes has been utilised by members of various [[Christian denominations]] since the time of the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] in 1054. Nowadays the 
[[Discipline (instrument of penance)|instrument of penance is called a discipline]], a cattail whip usually made of knotted cords, which is flung over the shoulders repeatedly during private prayer.&lt;ref name="Opus Dei Information Office"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.opusdei.org/art.php?w=32&amp;p=9316 |title= Opus Dei and corporal mortification |publisher= Opus Dei Information Office |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 13th century, a group of Roman Catholics, known as the [[Flagellant]]s, took self-mortification to extremes. These people would travel to towns and publicly beat and whip each other while preaching repentance.

[[Martin Luther]], the founder of the [[Lutheran Church]], regularly practiced self-flagellation as a means of mortification of the flesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wall|first=James T. |title=The Boundless Frontier: America from Christopher Columbus to Abraham Lincoln|publisher=[[University Press of America]]|language=English |page=103|quote=Though he did not go to the ends that had Luther— including even self-flagellation— the methods of ritualistic observance, self-denial, and good works did not satisfy.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the [[Congregationalist]] writer [[Sarah Osborn]] (1714-1796) also practiced self-flagellation in order "to remind her of her continued sin, depravity, and vileness in the eyes of God".&lt;ref name="Rubin1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rubin|first=Julius H.|title=Religious Melancholy and Protestant Experience in America|year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English |isbn=9780195083019|page=115|quote=In the many letters to her correspondents, Fish, Anthony, Hopkins, and Noyes, Osborn examined the state of her soul, sought spiritual guidance in the midst of her perplexities, and created a written forum for her continued self-examination.

Her view was that loving acceptance of the many sufferings of daily life was pleasing to God, and fostered loving relationships with other people, more than taking upon oneself extraneous sufferings through instruments of penance. As a Carmelite nun, Saint Thérèse practiced voluntary corporal mortification.

Some members of strict [[monastic]] orders, and some members of the Catholic lay organization [[Opus Dei]], practice mild self-flagellation using the discipline.&lt;ref name="Opus Dei Information Office"/&gt; [[Pope John Paul II]] took the discipline regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barron|first=Fr.

Flagellation is also used as a sexual practice in the context of [[BDSM]]. The intensity of the beating is usually far less than used for punishment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11107">'''Hierotopy''' (from {{lang-grc|ἱερός}}, sacred + {{lang-grc|τόπος}}, place, space) is the creation of [[sacred]] spaces viewed as a special form of human creativity and also a related academic field where specific examples of such creativity are studied. The concept and the term were developed in 2002  by [[Russia]]n art-historian and [[Byzantinism|byzantinist]] [[Alexei Lidov]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Hierotopy. The creation of sacred spaces as a form of creativity and subject of cultural history" in ''Hierotopy. Creation of Sacred Spaces in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A.Lidov, Moscow: Progress-Tradition, 2006, pp. 32-58&lt;/ref&gt; Hierotopy accounts for the ways in which a vast array of media (e.g. religious [[image]]s, [[ritual]], [[song]], [[incense]], [[light]]) are used to organize sacred spaces. As an academic field, it spans the disciplines of [[art history]], [[archeology]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[ethnology]] and [[religious studies]], but it possesses an object of study and a methodology of its own. It differs from the phenomenology of the sacred (which has been studied by [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Rudolf Otto]] and [[Pavel Florensky]]) insofar as it focuses on historical examples of hierotopic projects, that is, projects establishing a medium of communication between the [[mundane]] and the [[sacred]]. Though related with religious [[mysticism]], hierotopy deals first and foremost with forms of conscious, creative activity. 

According to the hierotopic approach, [[icon]]s and other sacred [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] are viewed not as isolated objects, but as components of larger hierotopic projects. Though such artifacts often play a prominent role in hierotopic studies, it is these projects themselves – including both their conceptual and artistic aspects, as well as the historical developments leading to their formation – that are the primary focus of study. The role played by the creators of sacred spaces is also of chief importance, and could be compared with that of an artist. The creative element at work here resembles the work of contemporary film directors, for both involve the coordinated effort of various artists and specialists in shaping a single, comprehensive vision.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "The Creator of Sacred Space as a Phenomenon of Byzantine Culture" in ''L’artista a Bisanzio e nel mondo cristiano-orientale'', ed. Michele Bacci, Pisa, 2003, pp.135-176&lt;/ref&gt; As examples of hierotopic projects, one can consider [[Solomon|King Solomon]]'s construction of the [[Solomon's Temple|First Temple]], the erection of [[Hagia Sophia]] by [[Justinian I|Emperor Justinian]], as well as the work of [[Abbot Suger]] in the conception of first [[Gothic architecture|Gothic cathedrals]]. Hierotopic projects are not limited to churches and sanctuaries; in other cases, landscapes,&lt;ref&gt;Sh. Tsuji. "Creating an Iconic Space. The Transformation of Narrative Landscape" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp. 627-642&lt;/ref&gt; architectural compounds &lt;ref&gt;G. Zelenskaya. "New Jerusalem near Moscow. Aspects of the Conception and New Discoveries" in: ''New Jerusalems. Hierotopy and iconography of sacred spaces'', Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 745-773&lt;/ref&gt; and even cities&lt;ref&gt;E. Kirichenko. "The Church and the City: on the Symbolic and Structural Unity of the Russian Sacred Space" in ''Hierotopy. Comparative studies of sacred spaces'', Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 292-322&lt;/ref&gt; and countries&lt;ref&gt;[[:ru:Петрухин, Владимир Яковлевич|V. Petrukhin]]. "Hierotopy of the Russian Land and the Primary Chronicle" in ''Hierotopy. Creation of Sacred Spaces in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', Moscow, 2006, pp. 480-490&lt;/ref&gt; have become products of hierotopic creativity. 

The topics of hierotopic study cover a broad span of interests and range, for example, from the role played by light in church architecture &lt;ref&gt;A. Godovanets. "The Icon of Light in the Architectural Space of Hagia Sophia" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp. 119-142&lt;/ref&gt; to the study of religious ceremonies, feasts&lt;ref&gt;L. Beliaev. "The Hierotopy of the Orthodox Feast: on the National Traditions in the Making of Sacred Spaces" in: ''Hierotopy. Comparative studies of sacred spaces'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 270-291&lt;/ref&gt; and folk customs.&lt;ref&gt;A. Moroz. "Sacred and Horrible Places. Creation of Sacred Spaces in Traditional Culture" in: ''Hierotopy. Comparative studies of sacred spaces'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 259-269&lt;/ref&gt;  The comparison of hierotopic models at work in different cultures is another focus of interest.&lt;ref&gt;N. Isar. "Vision and Performance. A Hierotopic Approach to Contemporary Art", in ''Hierotopy. Comparative studies of sacred spaces'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 341-375&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Chegodaev. "The Hierotopy of the Ancient Egyptian Sarcophagus" in ''Hierotopy. Comparative studies of sacred spaces'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 18-37&lt;/ref&gt; 

Six international [[symposium|symposia]] (2004, 2006, 2009, 2011, 2014, 2017) have been organized on hierotopic subjects.

== Spatial icons ==
The concept of the ''[[spatial icon]]'' plays a central role in  hierotopy and is used to describe the perception of sacred spaces. Spatial icons are understood to play a mediating role between the [[mundane]] and the [[sacred]]. They are mediatory images that are evoked, for example, in the space of a [[temple]] or [[sanctuary]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Hierotopy: Spatial icons and Image-Paradigms in Byzantine Culture", Moscow: Theoria, 2009, Ch. 2. Spatial Icons. The miraculous performance with the Hodegetria of Constantinople. pp. 39-70, 311-316&lt;/ref&gt; Hierotopic creativity is a sort of art, which can be described as the creation of spatial icons. This concept applies to the way in which the perception of architecture, light, image, ritual practice, as well as various other components forming sacred spaces, is unified into a single vision. It is also used in the study both of "sacred landscapes", such as the [[New Jerusalem Monastery]] near [[Moscow]], as well as of various ritual practices creating iconic medium, such as the [[Donkey walk]] in [[medieval]] Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;M. Flier. "The Image of the Tsar in the Muscovite Palm Sunday Ritual" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp.533-562&lt;/ref&gt; Spatial icons are essentially dynamic and performative in nature, such that the formal boundary between ‘image’ and ‘beholder’ no longer pertains. Typically, the beholders of spatial icons are actively involved in some way and become, to a certain extent, co-creators of the icons.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "The Byzantine World and Performative Spaces" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp. 17-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transfer of sacred spaces ==
The transfer of sacred spaces is an important form of hierotopic creativity. While an original sacred space often appears as the result of a [[theophany]], such as a divine visitation or omen, this  primary sacred space is then consciously reproduced in [[sanctuary|sanctuaries]] or [[temple]]s as a spatial icon. For example, the construction of the [[First Temple]], as recounted in the [[Old Testament]], can be viewed as the reproduction of the sacred space of the [[Tabernacle]]. Similarly, in the design and construction of many Christian churches, the First Temple itself has been taken as a hierotopic prototype.  Multiple "New Jerusalems" (reproductions of the Holy City of [[Jerusalem]]), aimed to establish a link to the space of the [[Holy Land]], are common both to the Eastern and Western branches of the [[Christianity|Christian]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. [http://hierotopy.ru/contents/NewJerusalems_01_Lidov_Introduction_2009_RusEng.pdf "New Jerusalems. Transferring of the Holy Land as Generative Matrix of Christian Culture"] in ''New Jerusalems. Hierotopy and iconography of sacred spaces'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 8-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Image-paradigms ==
The perception of sacred spaces has been analyzed by Lidov in terms of ''image-paradigms''.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Image-paradigms as a category of visual culture. Hierotopic approach to the art history", ''Russian Journal of Art History(Iskusstvoznanie)'', 2011, No 3-4, pp.109-122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Image-Paradigms as a Notion of Mediterranean Visual Culture: a Hierotopic Approach to Art History" in ''Crossing Cultures. Papers of  the International Congress of Art History. CIHA-2008'', Melbourne, 2009, pp.177-183&lt;/ref&gt; According to his conception, an image-paradigm is a guiding image-vision that is created with the help of various media and that is aimed at evoking the same image in the mind of beholders of a sacred space. An image-paradigm, which is essentially different from an illustrative picture or representation, is a means of communication between the creators of sacred spaces and their beholders. It constitutes a kernel of meaning that gives form to an entire hierotopic project. As an example, the image of the [[Heavenly Jerusalem]], which was present in [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] churches without being directly represented, is one of the most significant image-paradigms in the Christian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Hierotopy: Spatial icons and Image-Paradigms in Byzantine Culture", Moscow: Theoria, 2009.  Ch. 10, Image-Paradigms as a New Notion of Visual Culture, pp. 293-305, 335-337.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. L. Kessler. "Seeing Medieval Art", Broadview Press, 2004, ch.5, Church, pp. 109-110&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kathenotheism''' is a term coined by the [[philology|philologist]] [[Max Müller]] to mean the worship of one [[god]] at a time. It is closely related to [[henotheism]], the worship of one god while not rejecting the existence of other gods. Müller coined the term in reference to the [[Vedas]], where he explained each deity is treated as [[Supreme Being|supreme]] in turn.

Kathenotheism, a more specific form of  [[henotheism]], refers to the worship of a succession of supreme gods "one at a time", from the Greek ''kath' hena'' "one by one" + ''[[theism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=kathenotheism Online Etymology Dictionary: kathenotheism]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Greece==
The ancient [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic religion]] has a theology comparable to kathenotheism. The Orphic Hymns address each god of the Olympian pantheon as supreme in turn.

==Hinduism==
The [[Smarta Tradition]] of Hinduism worship the five major deities as supreme in turn and collectively.

!| Scientology symbol
||&lt;!--WP:NFC--&gt;
|| The "new-era" Scientology symbol is an "S" curving through two triangles. The "S" stands for Scientology. The top triangle represents a set of Scientology factors — knowledge, responsibility and control. Collectively the first three factors make up the KRC triangle. The lower triangle consists of the ARC triangle of affinity, reality and communication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iasmembership.org/scientology/symbol.html International Association of Scientologists Membership Homepage], by the International Association of Scientologists&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
!| Dianetics symbol
|| [[File:Dianet.png|80px]]
|| The stripes of this symbol represent green for growth, and yellow for life. The four green stripes recall the four divisions of a human's urge to survive which are revealed in [[Dianetics]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bonafidescientology.org/Chapter/04/page17.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
!| Infinite Dianetics symbol
|| 
|| Scientology teaches that all beings have an "urge towards the infinite." This symbol reflects the belief in Scientology that Dianetic processing (the triangle) aids in the attainment of the infinite.  Some variants of this symbol have an [[infinity symbol]] overlapping a triangle, while others place the infinity within the triangle's boundaries, as on the front cover of some versions of Route to Infinity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}
|-
!| Operating Thetan symbol
|| 
|| The [[Operating Thetan]] symbol is patterned after the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|Egyptian hieroglyphic]] of a [[Scarabaeus sacer|scarab beetle]]. Scarab beetles were symbolic of resurrection and renewal, and are also an important part of [[Rosicrucianism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crossroad.to/articles2/2002/carl-teichrib/11scarab.htm Scarab - The Magical Beetle of Egypt], by Carl Teichrib&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/NewAge/Hubbard_Occult.htm Factnet Report:  Hubbard and the Occult], by Jon Atack&lt;/ref&gt; The Operating Thetan symbol is prominently displayed on the side of the Scientology cruise ship ''[[Freewinds]]'' (see [[:Image:Freewinds logo.jpg]]).
Operating Thetans are said to be in a spiritual state above ''[[Clear (Scientology)|Clear]]''.  Scientologists say that one who has achieved the state of Operating Thetan is essentially a being able to operate free of the encumbrances of the material universe, as outlined in ''Scientology 8-8008''.
|-
!| Church of Scientology cross symbol
|align="center" | [[File:Scientology symbol.svg|80px|Stylized version of cross symbol]]
|| This symbol is mainly used to specifically denote the Church of Scientology, and may or may not represent the practice of Scientology in general. The cross's eight points represent the eight [[Scientology beliefs and practices#dynamics|dynamics]] in Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scientology.org/faq/background-and-basic-principles/what-is-the-scientology-cross.html&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Scientology cross]] for more details on this symbol.
|-
!| Sea Org symbol
| style="text-align:center"|[[File:Sea Org logo.svg|75px|The Sea Org symbol]]
|| The [[Sea Org]] is the central management organisation of the Church of Scientology. The Sea Org was founded by Scientology leader L. Ron Hubbard in 1968, as an organisation for implementing Scientology technology around the world through the operation of a fleet of ships. Members of the Sea Org sign an employment contract with the organisation for one billion years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/media/acrobat/2005-12/21006456.pdf Copy of Sea Org agreement form], [[LA Times]].&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
!| L. Ron Hubbard symbol
|| 
|| This symbol is a pictograph made of a cursive "L", "R" and "H". Designed to imitate an [[assay office]] [[hallmark]], it is used to authenticate L. Ron Hubbard's many works.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}
|-
!| Church of Spiritual Technology logo
| align="center" | [[File:ChurchOfSpritualTechnologyLogo.svg|80px]]
||
The symbol for the [[Church of Spiritual Technology]] is engraved into the Earth's surface in Scientology's [[Trementina Base]], in a mountainous region of New Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/26/AR2005112601065_pf.html  A Place in the Desert for New Mexico's Most Exclusive Circles], Washington Post, 11/27/2005&lt;/ref&gt; large enough to be seen from a high altitude.

==Trademarks==
All official symbols of Scientology are trademarks held by the [[Religious Technology Center]] (RTC). They are said by the center to be used "on Scientology religious materials to signify their authenticity ... and provide a legal mechanism to ensure the spiritual technologies are orthodox and ministered according to Mr. Hubbard's Scripture. These marks also provide the means to prevent anyone from engaging in some distorted use of Mr. Hubbard's writings, thereby ensuring the purity of the religion for all eternity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://davidmiscavige.rtc.org/ENG/CORP/rtc.htm Biography of David Miscavige], from the Religious Technology Center, a Scientology organization&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marxism''' is a method of [[socioeconomic]] analysis that views [[Social class|class]] relations and [[social conflict]] using a [[Historical materialism|materialist interpretation of historical development]] and takes a [[dialectic]]al view of social transformation. It originates from the works of 19th-century German philosophers [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]].

Marxism uses a methodology, now known as [[historical materialism]], to analyze and critique the development of [[capitalism]] and the role of [[class struggle]]s in systemic economic change.

According to Marxist theory, class conflict arises in [[Capitalism|capitalist societies]] due to contradictions between the material interests of the oppressed [[proletariat]]—a class of wage labourers employed to produce goods and services—and the [[bourgeoisie]]—the [[ruling class]] that owns the [[means of production]] and extract their wealth through appropriation of the [[surplus product]] ([[Profit (economics)|profit]]) produced by the proletariat.

This class struggle that is commonly expressed as the revolt of a society's [[productive forces]] against its [[relations of production]], results in a period of short-term crises as the bourgeoisie struggle to manage the intensifying [[alienation of labor]] experienced by the proletariat, albeit with varying degrees of [[class consciousness]]. This crisis culminates in a [[proletarian revolution]] and eventually leads to the establishment of [[socialism]]—a socioeconomic system based on [[social ownership]] of the means of production, [[To each according to his contribution|distribution based on one's contribution]] and [[Production for use|production organized directly for use]]. As the productive forces continued to advance, Marx hypothesized that socialism would ultimately transform into a [[communist society]]; a classless, stateless, humane society based on [[common ownership]] and the underlying principle: "[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs]]".

Marxism has developed into many different branches and schools of thought, though now there is no single definitive Marxist theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolff and Resnick|first=Richard and Stephen|title=Economics: Marxian versus Neoclassical|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|date=August 1987|isbn=978-0-8018-3480-6|page=130|quote=The German Marxists extended the theory to groups and issues Marx had barely touched. Marxian analyses of the legal system, of the social role of women, of foreign trade, of international rivalries among capitalist nations, and the role of parliamentary democracy in the transition to socialism drew animated debates&amp;nbsp;... Marxian theory (singular) gave way to Marxian theories (plural).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different Marxian schools place a greater emphasis on certain aspects of [[classical Marxism]] while rejecting or modifying other aspects. Many schools of thought have sought to combine Marxian concepts and non-Marxian concepts, which has then led to contradictory conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Hara|first=Phillip|title=Encyclopedia of Political Economy, Volume 2|publisher=[[Routledge]]|date=September 2003|isbn=978-0-415-24187-8|page=107|quote=Marxist political economists differ over their definitions of capitalism, socialism and communism. These differences are so fundamental, the arguments among differently persuaded Marxist political economists have sometimes been as intense as their oppositions to political economies that celebrate capitalism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, lately there is movement toward the recognition that [[historical materialism]] and [[dialectical materialism]] remains the fundamental aspect of all [[Marxist schools of thought]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Communism: The Great Misunderstanding|last=Ermak|first=Gennady|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=978-1533082893}}&lt;/ref&gt; which should result in more agreement between different schools.

Marxism has had a profound and influential impact on global academia and has expanded into many fields such as [[Marxist archaeology|archaeology]], [[anthropology]],&lt;ref&gt;Bridget O'Laughlin (1975) ''Marxist Approaches in Anthropology'' Annual Review of Anthropology Vol. 4: pp. 341–70 (October 1975) {{doi|10.1146/annurev.an.04.100175.002013}}.&lt;br&gt;William Roseberry (1997) ''Marx and Anthropology'' Annual Review of Anthropology, Vol. 26: pp. 25–46 (October 1997) {{doi|10.1146/annurev.anthro.26.1.25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[media studies]],&lt;ref&gt;S.

== Etymology ==
The term "Marxism" was popularized by [[Karl Kautsky]], who considered himself an "orthodox" Marxist during the dispute between the orthodox and revisionist followers of Marx.&lt;ref name="Georges Haupt 2010. pp. 18–19"&gt;Georges Haupt, Peter Fawcett, Eric Hobsbawm. ''Aspects of International Socialism, 1871–1914: Essays by Georges Haupt''. Paperback Edition. Cambridge, England, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2010. pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Kautsky's revisionist rival [[Eduard Bernstein]] also later adopted use of the term.&lt;ref name="Georges Haupt 2010. pp. 18–19"/&gt; Engels did not support the use of the term "Marxism" to describe either Marx's or his views.&lt;ref name="Georges Haupt 2010. Pp. 12"&gt;Georges Haupt, Peter Fawcett, Eric Hobsbawm. ''Aspects of International Socialism, 1871–1914: Essays by Georges Haupt''. Paperback Edition. Cambridge, England, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2010. pp. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Engels claimed that the term was being abusively used as a rhetorical qualifier by those attempting to cast themselves as "real" followers of Marx while casting others in different terms, such as "Lassallians".&lt;ref name="Georges Haupt 2010. Pp. 12"/&gt; In 1882, Engels claimed that Marx had criticized self-proclaimed "Marxist" [[Paul Lafargue]], by saying that if Lafargue's views were considered "Marxist", then "one thing is certain and that is that I am not a Marxist".&lt;ref name="Georges Haupt 2010. Pp. 12"/&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:Karl Marx 001.jpg|thumb|[[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883)]]
Marxism analyzes the material conditions and the economic activities required to fulfill human material needs to explain [[social phenomena]] within any given society.

It assumes that the form of economic organization, or [[mode of production]], influences all other social phenomena—including social relations, political institutions, legal systems, cultural systems, aesthetics, and ideologies. The economic system and these social relations form a [[base and superstructure]].

As [[forces of production]], i.e. [[technology]], improve, existing forms of social organization become obsolete and hinder further progress. As [[Karl Marx]] observed: "At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or—this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms—with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an era of social revolution".&lt;ref&gt;''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'' (1859). Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; These inefficiencies manifest themselves as social contradictions in society in the form of [[class struggle]].&lt;ref name="ComparingEconomic"&gt;''Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century'' (2003) by Gregory and Stuart. p. 62. ''Marx's Theory of Change''. {{ISBN|0-618-26181-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]], this struggle materializes between the minority (the [[bourgeoisie]]) who own the [[means of production]] and the vast majority of the population (the [[proletariat]]) who produce goods and services. Starting with the conjectural premise that [[social change]] occurs because of the struggle between different [[Social class|classes]] within society who are under contradiction against each other, a Marxist would conclude that [[capitalism]] exploits and oppresses the proletariat, therefore capitalism will inevitably lead to a [[proletarian revolution]].

[[Marxian economics]] and its proponents view capitalism as economically unsustainable and incapable of improving the living standards of the population due to its need to compensate for [[Tendency of the rate of profit to fall|falling rates of profit]] by cutting employee's wages, social benefits and pursuing military aggression. The [[Socialist mode of production|socialist system]] would succeed capitalism as humanity's mode of production through workers' [[revolution]]. According to Marxian [[crisis theory]], [[socialism]] is not an inevitability, but an economic necessity.&lt;ref&gt;Free will, non-predestination and non-determinism are emphasized in Marx's famous quote "Men make their own history". ''The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte'' (1852).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a socialist society, [[private property]]—in the form of the means of production—would be replaced by co-operative ownership. A socialist economy would not base production on the creation of private profits, but on the criteria of satisfying human needs—that is, [[Production for use|production would be carried out directly for use]]. As [[Friedrich Engels]] said: "Then the capitalist mode of appropriation in which the product enslaves first the producer, and then appropriator, is replaced by the mode of appropriation of the product that is based upon the nature of the modern means of production; upon the one hand, direct social appropriation, as means to the maintenance and extension of production on the other, direct individual appropriation, as means of subsistence and of enjoyment".&lt;ref&gt;''Socialism, Utopian and Scientific'' (1882). Chapter three.&lt;/ref&gt;

The materialist theory of history&lt;ref&gt;Evans, p. 53; Marx's account of the theory is the Preface to ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'' (1859). [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/index.htm]. Another exposition of the theory is in ''The German Ideology''. It, too, is available online from [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology marxists.org].&lt;/ref&gt; analyses the underlying causes of societal development and change from the perspective of the collective ways that humans make their living. All constituent features of a society (social classes, political pyramid, ideologies) are assumed to stem from economic activity, an idea often portrayed with the metaphor of the [[base and superstructure]].

The base and superstructure metaphor describes the totality of social relations by which humans produce and re-produce their social existence. According to Marx: "The sum total of the forces of production accessible to men determines the condition of society" and forms a society's economic base. The base includes the material forces of production, that is the labour and material means of production and relations of production, i.e., the social and political arrangements that regulate production and distribution. From this base rises a superstructure of legal and political "forms of social consciousness" of political and legal institutions that derive from the economic base that conditions the superstructure and a society's dominant ideology. Conflicts between the development of material productive forces and the relations of production provokes social revolutions and thus the resultant changes to the economic base will lead to the transformation of the superstructure.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'' (1859), [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/preface.htm Preface], Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1977, with some notes by R. Rojas and Engels: ''[[Anti-Dühring]]'' (1877), Introduction [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/introduction.htm General]
&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship is reflexive, as at first the base gives rise to the superstructure and remains the foundation of a form of social organization, hence that formed social organization can act again upon both parts of the base and superstructure so that the relationship is not static but a [[dialectic]], expressed and driven by conflicts and contradictions. As Engels clarified: "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes".&lt;ref&gt;''The Communist Manifesto'' (1847). Chapter one.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx considered class conflicts as the driving force of human history since these recurring conflicts have manifested themselves as distinct transitional stages of development in Western Europe. Accordingly, Marx designated human history as encompassing four stages of development in relations of production:&lt;ref&gt;Marx does not claim to have produced a master-key to history as historical materialism is not "an historico-philosophic theory of the ''marche generale'', imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself". Letter to editor of the Russian newspaper paper ''Otetchestvennye Zapiskym'' (1877). He explains that his ideas are based upon a concrete study of the actual conditions in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Primitive communism]]: as in co-operative tribal societies.
# [[Slave]] society: a development of tribal to city-state; aristocracy is born.
# [[Feudalism]]: aristocrats are the ruling class; merchants evolve into capitalists.
# [[Capitalism]]: capitalists are the ruling class, who create and employ the proletariat.

According to the Marxist theoretician and [[revolutionary]] [[Vladimir Lenin]], "the principal content of Marxism" was "Marx's economic doctrine".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Len67|Lenin 1967 (1913)]]. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx believed that the capitalist bourgeois and their economists were promoting what he saw as the lie that "the interests of the capitalist and of the worker are&amp;nbsp;... one and the same", therefore he believed that they did this by purporting the concept that "the fastest possible growth of productive [[Capital (economics)|capital]]" was best not only for the wealthy capitalists but also for the workers because it provided them with employment.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mar49|Marx 1849]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Exploitation is a matter of [[surplus labour]]—the amount of labour one performs beyond what one receives in goods. Exploitation has been a socioeconomic feature of every class society and is one of the principal features distinguishing the social classes. The power of one social class to control the [[means of production]] enables its exploitation of the other classes.

In capitalism, the [[labor theory of value|labour theory of value]] is the operative concern; the [[Value (economics)|value]] of a [[Commodity (Marxism)|commodity]] equals the socially necessary labour time required to produce it. Under that condition, [[surplus value]] (the difference between the value produced and the value received by a labourer) is synonymous with the term "surplus labour", thus capitalist exploitation is realised as deriving surplus value from the worker.

In pre-capitalist economies, exploitation of the worker was achieved via physical coercion. In the capitalist mode of production, that result is more subtly achieved and because workers do not own the means of production, they must voluntarily enter into an exploitive work relationship with a capitalist in order to earn the necessities of life. The worker's entry into such employment is voluntary in that they choose which capitalist to work for. However, the worker must work or starve, thus exploitation is inevitable and the "voluntary" nature of a worker participating in a capitalist society is illusory.
&lt;!-- Production, not circulation. Marx emphasised that capitalism (''per se'') does not cheat the worker. --&gt;

[[Marx's theory of alienation|Alienation]] is the estrangement of people from their humanity (&lt;small&gt;German:&lt;/small&gt; ''Gattungswesen'', "species-essence", "species-being"), which is a systematic result of capitalism. Under capitalism, the fruits of production belong to the employers, who expropriate the surplus created by others and so generate alienated labourers.&lt;ref&gt;"Alienation" entry, ''A Dictionary of Sociology''&lt;/ref&gt; In Marx's view, alienation is an objective characterization of the worker's situation in capitalism—his or her self-awareness of this condition is not prerequisite.

=== Social classes ===
{{main|Marxian class theory}}
{{see also|Social class|Class conflict|Classless society|Three-component theory of stratification}}
Marx distinguishes social classes on the basis of two criteria: ownership of [[means of production]] and control over the [[labour power]] of others. Following this criterion of class based on property relations, Marx identified the [[social stratification]] of the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] with the following social groups:
* [[Proletariat]]: "[...] the class of modern wage labourers who, having no means of production of their own, are reduced to selling their [[labour power]] in order to live."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Engels|first1=Friedrich|authorlink1=Friedrich Engels|title=Manifesto of the Communist Party|date=1888|location=London|pages=Footnote|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm#a1|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capitalist mode of production establishes the conditions enabling the bourgeoisie to [[Exploitation (Marxism)|exploit]] the proletariat because the workers' labour generates a [[surplus value]] greater than the workers' [[wages]].
* [[Bourgeoisie]]: those who "own the means of production" and buy labour power from the proletariat, thus exploiting the proletariat. They subdivide as bourgeoisie and the petite bourgeoisie.
** [[Petite bourgeoisie]] are those who work and can afford to buy little labour power i.e. small business owners, peasant landlords, trade workers and the like. Marxism predicts that the continual reinvention of the means of production eventually would destroy the petite bourgeoisie, degrading them from the middle class to the proletariat.
* [[Lumpenproletariat]]: the outcasts of society such as the criminals, vagabonds, beggars, or prostitutes without any [[Political consciousness|political]] or [[class consciousness]]. Having no interest in international or national economics affairs, Marx claimed that this specific sub-division of the proletariat would play no part in the eventual social revolution.
* [[Landlords]]: a historically important social class who retain some wealth and power.
* [[Peasantry]] and [[farmers]]: a scattered class incapable of organizing and effecting socio-economic change, most of whom would enter the proletariat while some would become landlords.

[[Class consciousness]] denotes the awareness—of itself and the social world—that a social class possesses and its capacity to rationally act in their best interests, hence class consciousness is required before they can effect a successful revolution and thus the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].

Without defining [[Ideology#Ideology as an instrument of social reproduction|ideology]],&lt;ref&gt;Joseph McCarney: ''[http://marxmyths.org/joseph-mccarney/article.htm Ideology and False Consciousness]'', April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Marx used the term to describe the production of images of social reality. According to Engels, "ideology is a process accomplished by the so-called thinker consciously, it is true, but with a [[false consciousness]]. The real motive forces impelling him remain unknown to him; otherwise it simply would not be an ideological process. Hence he imagines false or seeming motive forces".&lt;ref&gt;Engels: [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1893/letters/93_07_14.htm Letter] to [[Franz Mehring]], (London 14 July 1893), Donna Torr, translator, in ''Marx and Engels Correspondence'', International Publishers, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the ruling class controls the society's means of production, the superstructure of society (the ruling social ideas), are determined by the best interests of the ruling class. In ''The German Ideology'', he says "[t]he ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e., the class which is the ruling material force of society, is, at the same time, its ruling intellectual force."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01b.htm|title=Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, ''The German Ideology''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[political economy]]" initially referred to the study of the material conditions of economic production in the capitalist system. In Marxism, political economy is the study of the means of production, specifically of capital and how that manifests as economic activity.

This new way of thinking was invented because socialists believed that common ownership of the "means of production" (that is the industries, the land, the wealth of nature, the trade apparatus, the wealth of the society, etc.) will abolish the exploitative working conditions experienced under capitalism. Through working class revolution, the state (which Marxists see as a weapon for the subjugation of one class by another) is seized and used to suppress the hitherto ruling class of capitalists and by implementing a commonly-owned, democratically controlled workplace create the society of communism, which Marxists see as true democracy. An economy based on co-operation on human need and social betterment, rather than competition for profit of many independently acting profit seekers, would also be the end of class society, which Marx saw as the fundamental division of all hitherto existing history.

Marx saw work, the effort by humans to transform the environment for their needs, as a fundamental feature of human kind. [[Capitalism]], in which the product of the worker's labor is taken from them and sold at market rather than being part of the worker's life, is therefore alienating to the worker. Additionally, the worker is compelled by various means (some nicer than others) to work harder, faster and for longer hours. While this is happening, the employer is constantly trying to save on labor costs: pay the workers less, figure out how to use cheaper equipment, etc. This allows the employer to extract the largest mount of work (and therefore potential wealth) from their workers. The fundamental nature of capitalist society is no different from that of slave society: one small group of society exploiting the larger group.

Through [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]], the [[profit motive]] is eliminated and the motive of furthering human flourishing is introduced. Because the surplus produced by the workers is property of the society as whole, there are no classes of producers and appropriators. Additionally, the state, which has its origins in the bands of retainers hired by the first ruling classes to protect their economic privilege, [[Withering away of the state|will disappear as its conditions of existence have disappeared]].&lt;ref name="Origins of the Family- Chapter IX"&gt;{{cite web|author=Frederick Engels|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/ch09.htm |title=Origins of the Family- Chapter IX|publisher=Marxists.org|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ZhaoDickson2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jianmin Zhao|author2=Bruce J.

== Revolution, socialism and communism ==
[[File:Madrid may day375.jpg|thumb|Leftist protester wielding a [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] with a [[raised fist]], both are symbols of revolutionary socialism.]]
According to [[Orthodox Marxism|orthodox Marxist theory]], the overthrow of capitalism by a [[Revolutionary socialism|socialist revolution]] in contemporary society is inevitable. While the inevitability of an eventual socialist revolution is a controversial debate among many different Marxist schools of thought, all Marxists believe socialism is a necessity, if not inevitable. Marxists believe that a socialist society is far better for the majority of the populace than its capitalist counterpart. Prior to the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian revolution]] of 1917, Lenin wrote: "The socialization of production is bound to lead to the conversion of the means of production into the property of society&amp;nbsp;... This conversion will directly result in an immense increase in productivity of labour, a reduction of working hours, and the replacement of the remnants, the ruins of small-scale, primitive, disunited production by collective and improved labour".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Len67|Lenin 1967 (1913)]]. p. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of the 1905 revolution and the failure of socialist movements to resist the outbreak of World War One led to renewed theoretical effort and valuable contributions from Lenin and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] towards an appreciation of Marx's [[crisis theory]] and efforts to formulate a theory of imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;Samezo Kuruma (September 1929).

== Classical Marxism ==
{{main|Classical Marxism}}
"Classical Marxism" denotes the collection of socio-eco-political theories expounded by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. "Marxism", as [[Ernest Mandel]] remarked, "is always open, always critical, always self-critical". As such, classical Marxism distinguishes between "Marxism" as broadly perceived and "what Marx believed", thus in 1883 Marx wrote to the French labour leader [[Jules Guesde]] and to Marx's son-in-law [[Paul Lafargue]]—both of whom claimed to represent Marxist principles—accusing them of "revolutionary phrase-mongering" and of denying the value of reformist struggle.

From Marx's letter derives the paraphrase:&lt;blockquote&gt;"If that is Marxism, then I am not a Marxist".&lt;ref&gt;"Accusing Guesde and Lafargue of 'revolutionary phrase-mongering' and of denying the value of reformist struggles, Marx made his famous remark that, if their politics represented Marxism, 'ce qu'il y a de certain c'est que moi, je ne suis pas Marxiste' ('what is certain is that I myself am not a Marxist')". See [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/05/parti-ouvrier.htm "Programme of the French Worker's Party"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hall|first=Stuart|author2=Dave Morely|author3=Kuan-Hsing Chen|title=Stuart Hall: Critical Dialogues in Cultural Studies|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-08803-9|page=418|accessdate=4 March 2013|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EPENAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA418|quote=I have no hesitation in saying that this represents a gigantic crudification and simplification of Marx's work – the kind of simplification and reductionism which once led him, in despair, to say "if that is marxism, then I am not a marxist"}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;American Marxist scholar [[Hal Draper]] responded to this comment by saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;"There are few thinkers in modern history whose thought has been so badly misrepresented, by Marxists and anti-Marxists alike".&lt;ref&gt;Not found in search function at [http://www.marxists.org/archive/draper/index.htm Draper Arkiv].&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;On the other hand, the book ''Communism: The Great Misunderstanding'' argues that the source of such misrepresentations lies in ignoring the philosophy of Marxism, which is dialectical materialism. In large, this was due to the fact that ''[[The German Ideology]]'', in which Marx and Engels developed this philosophy, did not find a publisher for almost one hundred years.

[[File:Gordon Childe.jpg|thumb|One of the 20th century's most prominent Marxist academics, the Australian archaeologist [[V. Gordon Childe]]]]
Marxism has been adopted by a large number of academics and other scholars working in various disciplines.

The [[Archaeological theory|theoretical development]] of [[Marxist archaeology]] was first developed in the Soviet Union in 1929, when a young archaeologist named Vladislav I. Ravdonikas (1894–1976) published a report entitled "For a Soviet history of material culture". Within this work, the very discipline of archaeology as it then stood was criticised as being inherently bourgeois, therefore anti-socialist and so, as a part of the academic reforms instituted in the Soviet Union under the administration of Premier [[Joseph Stalin]], a great emphasis was placed on the adoption of Marxist archaeology throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tri07|Trigger 2007]]. pp. 326–40.&lt;/ref&gt; These theoretical developments were subsequently adopted by archaeologists working in capitalist states outside of the Leninist bloc, most notably by the Australian academic [[V. Gordon Childe]] (1892–1957), who used Marxist theory in his understandings of the development of human society.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gre81|Green 1981]]. p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marxist sociology]] is the study of [[sociology]] from a Marxist perspective.&lt;ref name="black"&gt;Allan G. Johnson, ''The Blackwell dictionary of sociology: a user's guide to sociological language'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2000, {{ISBN|0-631-21681-2}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=V1kiW7x6J1MC&amp;pg=PA183 p. 183-84 (Google Books)].&lt;/ref&gt; Marxist sociology is "a form of [[conflict theory]] associated with&amp;nbsp;... Marxism's objective of developing a [[Positivism (sociology)|positive]] ([[empirical]]) science of [[capitalist]] [[society]] as part of the mobilization of a revolutionary [[working class]]".&lt;ref name="encofsoc"&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/research/marxist-sociology-eos-03/ "Marxist Sociology"], ''Encyclopedia of Sociology'', Macmillan Reference, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Sociological Association]] has a section dedicated to the issues of Marxist sociology that is "interested in examining how insights from Marxist [[methodology]] and Marxist analysis can help explain the complex dynamics of modern society".&lt;ref name="section"&gt;[http://www2.asanet.org/sectionmarxist/about.html About the Section on Marxist Sociology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109001255/http://www2.asanet.org/sectionmarxist/about.html |date=2009-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by the thought of [[Karl Marx]], Marxist sociology emerged during the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century. As well as Marx, [[Max Weber]] and [[Émile Durkheim]] are considered seminal influences in [[History of sociology|early sociology]]. The first Marxist school of sociology was known as [[Austro-Marxism]], of which [[Carl Grünberg]] and [[Antonio Labriola]] were among its most notable members. During the 1940s, the [[Western Marxist]] school became accepted within Western academia, subsequently fracturing into several different perspectives such as the [[Frankfurt School]] or [[critical theory]]. Due to its former state-supported position, there has been a backlash against Marxist thought in [[post-communist]] states (see [[sociology in Poland]]) but it remains dominant in the sociological research sanctioned and supported by those communist states that remain (see [[sociology in China]]).

[[Marxian economics]] refers to a school of economic thought tracing its foundations to the critique of classical [[political economy]] first expounded upon by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolff and Resnick|first=Richard and Stephen|title=Economics: Marxian versus Neoclassical|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|date=August 1987|isbn=978-0801834806|page=130|quote=Marxian theory (singular) gave way to Marxian theories (plural).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marxian economics concerns itself with the analysis of [[Crisis theory|crisis]] in [[capitalism]], the role and distribution of the [[surplus product]] and [[surplus value]] in various types of [[economic system]]s, the nature and origin of [[Value (economics)|economic value]], the impact of class and class struggle on economic and political processes, and the process of [[Evolutionary economics|economic evolution]]. Although the Marxian school is considered [[heterodox economics|heterodox]], ideas that have come out of Marxian economics have contributed to mainstream understanding of the global economy. Certain concepts of Marxian economics, especially those related to [[capital accumulation]] and the [[business cycle]], such as [[creative destruction]], have been fitted for use in capitalist systems.

[[Marxist historiography]] is a school of [[historiography]] influenced by Marxism.  The chief tenets of Marxist historiography are the centrality of [[social class]] and [[economic]] constraints in determining historical outcomes. Marxist historiography has made contributions to the history of the [[working class]], oppressed nationalities, and the [[methodology]] of [[People's history|history from below]]. [[Friedrich Engels]]' most important historical contribution was ''Der deutsche Bauernkrieg'' (''The [[German Peasants' War]]''), which analysed social warfare in early Protestant Germany in terms of emerging capitalist classes. ''The German Peasants' War'' indicate the Marxist interest in [[People's history|history from below]] and class analysis, and attempts a dialectical analysis. Engels' short treatise ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' (1870s) was salient in creating the [[socialist]] impetus in British politics. Marx's most important works on social and political history include ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]'', ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', ''[[The German Ideology]]'', and those chapters of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' dealing with the historical emergence of [[Capitalism|capitalists]] and [[Proletariat|proletarians]] from [[Pre-industrial society|pre-industrial]] English society. Marxist historiography suffered in the [[Soviet Union]], as the government requested overdetermined historical writing. Notable histories include the ''Short Course History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ([[Bolshevik]])'', published in the 1930s to justify the nature of Bolshevik party life under [[Joseph Stalin]]. A circle of historians inside the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) formed in 1946. While some members of the group (most notably [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] and [[E. P. Thompson]]) left the CPGB after the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]], the common points of British Marxist historiography continued in their works. Thompson's ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]'' is one of the works commonly associated with this group. [[Eric Hobsbawm]]'s ''Bandits'' is another example of this group's work. [[C. L. R. James]] was also a great pioneer of the 'history from below' approach. Living in Britain when he wrote his most notable work ''[[The Black Jacobins]]'' (1938), he was an [[Anti-Stalinist left|anti-Stalinist]] Marxist and so outside of the CPGB. In India, B. N. Datta and [[Damodar Dharmananda Kosambi|D. D. Kosambi]] are considered the founding fathers of  Marxist historiography. Today, the senior-most scholars of Marxist historiography are [[Ram Sharan Sharma|R. S. Sharma]], [[Irfan Habib]], [[Romila Thapar]], [[D. N. Jha]] and [[K. N. Panikkar]], most of whom are now over 75 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Bottomore, T. B. 1983. A Dictionary of Marxist thought. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marxist literary criticism]] is a loose term describing [[literary criticism]] based on socialist and dialectic theories. Marxist criticism views literary works as reflections of the social institutions from which they originate. According to Marxists, even literature itself is a social institution and has a specific ideological function, based on the background and ideology of the author. Notable marxist literary critics include [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Terry Eagleton]] and [[Fredric Jameson]]. [[Marxist aesthetics]] is a theory of [[aesthetics]] based on, or derived from, the theories of [[Karl Marx]]. It involves a [[dialectical]] and [[materialist]], or [[dialectical materialist]], approach to the application of Marxism to the cultural sphere, specifically areas related to taste such as art, beauty, etc. Marxists believe that economic and social conditions, and especially the class relations that derive from them, affect every aspect of an individual's life, from religious beliefs to legal systems to cultural frameworks. Some notable Marxist aestheticians include [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]], [[Mikhail Lifshitz]], [[William Morris]], [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Georg Lukács]], [[Louis Althusser]], [[Jacques Rancière]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and [[Raymond Williams]].

According to a 2007 survey of American professors by [[Neil Gross]] and Solon Simmons, 17.6% of social science professors and 5.0% of humanities professors identify as Marxists, while between 0 and 2% of professors in all other disciplines identify as Marxists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gross |first1=Neil |last2=Simmons |first2=Solon |title=The Social and Political Views of American Professors |date=2007 |citeseerx=10.1.1.147.6141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels ===
{{main|Karl Marx|Friedrich Engels}}
[[File:Engels.jpg|thumb|[[Friedrich Engels]]]]
Karl Marx (5 May 1818 – 14 March 1883) was a [[German philosopher]], political economist and socialist revolutionary who addressed the matters of [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of the working class, the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] and historical materialism. He is famous for analysing history in terms of class struggle, summarised in the initial line introducing ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' (1848): "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles".&lt;ref&gt;''The Communist Manifesto (1847). Chapter one.&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedrich Engels (28 November 1820 – 5 August 1895) was a German [[Political philosophy|political philosopher]] who together with Marx co-developed communist theory. Marx and Engels first met in September 1844. Discovering that they had similar views of philosophy and socialism, they collaborated and wrote works such as ''Die heilige Familie'' (''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]''). After Marx was deported from France in January 1845, they moved to Belgium, which then permitted greater [[freedom of expression]] than other European countries. In January 1846, they returned to Brussels to establish the Communist Correspondence Committee.

In 1847, they began writing ''The Communist Manifesto'' (1848), based on Engels' ''The Principles of Communism''. Six weeks later, they published the 12,000-word pamphlet in February 1848. In March, Belgium expelled them and they moved to [[Cologne]], where they published the ''[[Neue Rheinische Zeitung]]'', a politically [[Political radicalism|radical]] newspaper. By 1849, they had to leave Cologne for London. The Prussian authorities pressured the British government to expel Marx and Engels, but Prime Minister [[Lord John Russell]] refused.

After Marx's death in 1883, Engels became the editor and translator of Marx's writings. With his ''[[Origins of the Family, Private Property, and the State]]'' (1884)&amp;nbsp;– analysing [[Monogamy|monogamous]] [[marriage]] as guaranteeing male social domination of women, a concept analogous, in communist theory, to the capitalist class's economic domination of the working class—Engels made [[intellectual]]ly significant contributions to [[feminist theory]] and [[Marxist feminism]].

=== Late 20th century===
[[File:Fidel Castro - UN General Assembly 1960.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fidel Castro]] at the UN General Assembly, 1960]]
In 1959, the [[Cuban Revolution]] led to the victory of [[Fidel Castro]] and his [[July 26 Movement]]. Although the revolution was not explicitly [[socialist]], upon victory Castro ascended to the position of Prime Minister and adopted the [[Leninist]] model of socialist development, forging an alliance with the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;See [[#Col03|Coltman 2003]] and [[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]].&lt;/ref&gt; One of the leaders of the revolution, the Argentine Marxist revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] (1928–1967), subsequently went on to aid revolutionary socialist movements in [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo-Kinshasa]] and Bolivia, eventually being killed by the Bolivian government, possibly on the orders of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), though the CIA agent sent to search for Guevara, Felix Rodriguez, expressed a desire to keep him alive as a possible bargaining tool with the Cuban government. He would posthumously go on to become an internationally recognised icon.

In the People's Republic of China, the [[Maoist]] government undertook the [[Cultural Revolution]] from 1966 through to 1976 to ameliorate capitalist elements of Chinese society and achieve socialism. However, upon [[Mao Zedong]]'s death, his rivals seized political power and under the Premiership of [[Deng Xiaoping]] (1978–1992), many of Mao's Cultural Revolution era policies were revised or abandoned and much of the state sector privatised.

The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the collapse of most of those socialist states that had professed a [[Marxist–Leninist]] ideology. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the emergence of the [[New Right]] and [[neoliberal]] capitalism as the dominant ideological trends in western politics—championed by U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and U.K. Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]—led the west to take a more aggressive stand against the Soviet Union and its Leninist allies. Meanwhile, in the Soviet Union the reformist [[Mikhael Gorbachev]] became Premier in March 1985 and sought to abandon Leninist models of development towards [[social democracy]]. Ultimately, Gorbachev's reforms, coupled with rising levels of popular [[ethnic nationalism]] in the Soviet Union, led to the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|state's dissolution]] in late 1991 into a series of constituent nations, all of which abandoned Marxist–Leninist models for socialism, with most converting to capitalist economies.

=== 21st century ===

[[File:VISITA DE ESTADO - XI JINPING (30930224182).jpg|thumb|right|[[Xi Jinping]] in 2016]]
At the turn of the 21st century, China, Cuba, Laos, North Korea and Vietnam remained the only officially Marxist–Leninist states remaining, although a Maoist government led by [[Prachanda]] was elected into power in Nepal in 2008 following a long guerrilla struggle.

The early 21st century also saw the election of socialist governments in several Latin American nations, in what has come to be known as the "[[pink tide]]". Dominated by the Venezuelan government of [[Hugo Chávez]], this trend also saw the election of [[Evo Morales]] in Bolivia, [[Rafael Correa]] in Ecuador and [[Daniel Ortega]] in Nicaragua. Forging political and economic alliances through international organisations like the [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas]], these socialist governments allied themselves with Marxist–Leninist Cuba and although none of them espoused a Leninist path directly, most admitted to being significantly influenced by Marxist theory.

For Italian Marxist Gianni Vattimo in his 2011 book ''[[Hermeneutic Communism]]'', "this new weak communism differs substantially from its previous Soviet (and current Chinese) realization, because the South American countries follow democratic electoral procedures and also manage to decentralize the state bureaucratic system through the [[Bolivarian missions]]. In sum, if weakened communism is felt as a specter in the West, it is not only because of media distortions but also for the alternative it represents through the same democratic procedures that the West constantly professes to cherish but is hesitant to apply".&lt;ref&gt;Gianni Vattimo and Santiago Zabala. ''Hermeneutic Communism: From Heidegger to Marx'' Columbia University Press. 2011. p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chinese President]] [[Xi Jinping]] has announced a deepening commitment of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] to the ideas of Marx. At an event celebrating the 200th anniversary of Marx's birth, Xi said “We must win the advantages, win the initiative, and win the future. We must continuously improve the ability to use Marxism to analyse and solve practical problems...” also adding “powerful ideological weapon for us to understand the world, grasp the law, seek the truth, and change the world,”. Xi has further stressed the importance of examining and continuing the tradition of the [[Communist Party of China|CPC]] and embrace its revolutionary past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-marx-china/no-regrets-xi-says-marxism-still-totally-correct-for-china-idUSKBN1I50ET|title=No regrets: Xi says Marxism still 'totally correct' for China|first=Christian|last=Shepherd|publisher=|newspaper=Reuters|date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/17/asia/xi-jinping-marxism-china-intl/index.html|title=At the height of his power, China's Xi Jinping moves to embrace Marxism|first=Steven Jiang|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1270109/chinas-communist-party-and-xi-jinping-are-celebrating-the-200th-birthday-of-karl-marx-with-a-vengeance/|title=China's huge celebrations of Karl Marx are not really about Marxism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
{{main|Criticisms of Marxism}}
{{see also|Criticisms of socialism|Criticisms of communist party rule}}
Criticisms of Marxism have come from various political ideologies and academic disciplines. These include general criticisms about lack of internal consistency, criticisms related to historical materialism, that it is a type of historical determinism, the necessity of suppression of individual rights, issues with the implementation of communism and economic issues such as the distortion or absence of price signals and reduced incentives. In addition, empirical and epistemological problems are frequently identified.&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Howard and J. E. King, 1992, ''A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929–1990''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=popper&gt;{{cite book|last=Popper|first=Karl|title =Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=978-0-415-28594-0|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Maynard Keynes. Essays in Persuasion. W. W. Norton &amp; Company. 1991. p. 300 {{ISBN|978-0-393-00190-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Marxists have criticised the academic [[institution]]alisation of Marxism for being too shallow and detached from political action. For instance, Zimbabwean [[Trotskyist]] [[Alex Callinicos]], himself a professional academic, stated: "Its practitioners remind one of [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]], who in the Greek legend fell in love with his own reflection&amp;nbsp;... Sometimes it is necessary to devote time to clarifying and developing the concepts that we use, but indeed for Western Marxists this has become an end in itself. The result is a body of writings incomprehensible to all but a tiny minority of highly qualified scholars".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cal10|Callinicos 2010]]. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, there are intellectual critiques of Marxism that contest certain assumptions prevalent in Marx's thought and Marxism after him, without exactly rejecting Marxist politics.&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{cite book|last=Baudrillard|first=Jean|date=1973|title=The Mirror of Production}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other contemporary supporters of Marxism argue that many aspects of Marxist thought are viable, but that the corpus is incomplete or outdated in regards to certain aspects of economic, political or [[social theory]]. They may therefore combine some Marxist concepts with the ideas of other theorists such as [[Max Weber]]—the [[Frankfurt School]] is one example.&lt;ref&gt;Held, David (1980), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=Fredric|editor1-last=Nealon|editor1-first=Jeffrey|editor2-last=Irr|editor2-first=Caren|title=Rethinking the Frankfurt School: Alternative Legacies of Cultural Critique|date=2002|publisher=SUNY Press|location=Albany|pages=11–30|chapter=The Theoretical Hesitation: Benjamin's Sociological Predecessor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== General criticisms ===
Philosopher and historian of ideas [[Leszek Kołakowski]] pointed out that "Marx's theory is incomplete or ambiguous in many places, and could be 'applied' in many contradictory ways without manifestly infringing its principles". Specifically, he considers "the laws of dialectics" as fundamentally erroneous, stating that some are "truisms with no specific Marxist content", others "philosophical dogmas that cannot be proved by scientific means" and some just "nonsense". He believes that some Marxist laws can be interpreted differently, but that these interpretations still in general fall into one of the two categories of error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Main Currents of Marxism|last=Kołakowski|first=Leszek|publisher=W. W. Norton and Company|year=2005|isbn=9780393329438|location=New York|pages=662, 909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Okishio's theorem]] shows that if capitalists use cost-cutting techniques and real wages do not increase, the rate of profit must rise, which casts doubt on Marx's view that the rate of profit would tend to fall.&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Howard and J. E. King. (1992) A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929–1990, chapter 7, sects. II–IV. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The allegations of inconsistency have been a large part of Marxian economics and the debates around it since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;See M. C. Howard and J. E. King, 1992, ''A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929–1990''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Kliman argues that this undermines Marx's critiques and the correction of the alleged inconsistencies, because internally inconsistent theories cannot be right by definition.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kliman states that "Marx’s value theory would be ''necessarily wrong'' if it were internally inconsistent. Internally inconsistent theories may be appealing, intuitively plausible and even obvious, and consistent with all available empirical evidence––but they cannot be right. It is necessary to reject them or correct them. Thus the alleged proofs of inconsistency trump all other considerations, disqualifying Marx’s theory at the starting gate. By doing so, they provide the principal justification for the suppression of this theory as well as the suppression of, and the denial of resources needed to carry out, present-day research based upon it. This greatly inhibits its further development. So does the very charge of inconsistency. What person of intellectual integrity would want to join a research program founded on (what he believes to be) a theory that is internally inconsistent and therefore false?" (Andrew Kliman, ''Reclaiming Marx's "Capital": A Refutation of the Myth of Inconsistency,'' Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2007, p. 3, emphasis in original). However, in his book, Kliman presents an interpretation where these inconsistencies can be eliminated. The connection between the inconsistency allegations and the lack of study of Marx’s theories was argued further by [[John Cassidy (journalist)|John Cassidy]] ("The Return of Karl Marx," ''The New Yorker'', Oct. 20 &amp; 27, 1997, p. 252): "His mathematical model of the economy, which depended on the idea that labor is the source of all value, was riven with internal inconsistencies and is rarely studied these days."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epistemological and empirical critiques ===
Marx's predictions have been criticized because they have allegedly failed, with some pointing towards the GDP per capita increasing generally in capitalist economies compared to less market oriented economics, the capitalist economies not suffering worsening economic crises leading to the overthrow of the capitalist system and communist revolutions not occurring in the most advanced capitalist nations, but instead in undeveloped regions.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Kliman, ''Reclaiming Marx's "Capital"'', Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, p. 208, emphases in original.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD.ZG|title=GDP per capita growth (annual %)|date=2016|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his books ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' and ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]'', [[philosopher of science]] [[Karl Popper]], criticized the [[explanatory power]] and [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of historical materialism.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org|title=Science as Falsification|last=Popper|first=Sir Karl|date=1963|website=stephenjaygould.org.|publisher=|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popper believed that Marxism had been initially scientific, in that Marx had postulated a genuinely predictive theory. When these predictions were not in fact borne out, Popper argues that the theory avoided [[Falsifiability|falsification]] by the addition of ad hoc hypotheses that made it compatible with the facts. Because of this, Popper asserted, a theory that was initially genuinely scientific degenerated into [[pseudoscientific]] dogma.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge|last=Popper|first=Sir Karl|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=978-0-415-28594-0|pages=449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socialist critiques ===
[[Democratic socialist]]s and social democrats reject the idea that socialism can be accomplished only through extra-legal class conflict and a proletarian revolution. The relationship between Marx and other socialist thinkers and organizations—rooted in Marxism's "scientific" and anti-utopian socialism, among other factors—has divided Marxists from other socialists since Marx's life.

After Marx's death and with the emergence of Marxism, there have also been dissensions within Marxism itself—a notable example is the splitting of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] into [[Bolsheviks]] and [[Mensheviks]]. [[Orthodox Marxist]]s became opposed to a less dogmatic, more innovative, or even [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] Marxism.

=== Anarchist and libertarian critiques ===
{{main|Libertarian socialism|Libertarian Marxism}}
[[Anarchism]] has had a strained relationship with Marxism since Marx's life. Anarchists and many non-Marxist libertarian socialists reject the need for a [[Dictatorship of the proletariat|transitory state phase]], claiming that socialism can only be established through decentralized, non-coercive organization. Anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]] criticized Marx for his authoritarian bent.&lt;ref name=Bakunin1872&gt;{{citation|last=Bakunin|first=Mikhail|authorlink=Mikhail Bakunin|title=Letter to ''La Liberté'', quoted in ''Bakunin on Anarchy'', translated and edited by Sam Dolgoff, 1971|date=5 October 1872|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1872/la-liberte.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrases "barracks socialism" or "[[barracks communism]]" became a shorthand for this critique, evoking the image of citizens' lives being as regimented as the lives of [[conscript]]s in a [[barracks]].&lt;ref name="Sperber_2013"&gt;{{citation|last=Sperber|first=Jonathan|year=2013|title=Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hBpSh9JYAKcC|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co|postscript=.|isbn=9780871403544}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Noam Chomsky]] is critical of Marxism's dogmatic strains and the idea of Marxism itself, but still appreciates Marx's contributions to political thought. Unlike some anarchists, Chomsky does not consider Bolshevism "Marxism in practice", but he does recognize that Marx was a complicated figure who had conflicting ideas, while he also acknowledges the latent authoritarianism in Marx he also points to the libertarian strains that developed into the [[council communism]] of [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Anton Pannekoek]]. However, his commitment to libertarian socialism has led him to characterize himself as an anarchist with radical Marxist leanings (see [[political positions of Noam Chomsky]]).

Libertarian Marxism refers to a broad scope of economic and political philosophies that emphasize the [[anti-authoritarian]] aspects of Marxism. Early currents of libertarian Marxism, known as [[left communism]], emerged in opposition to [[Marxism–Leninism]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Herman Gorter]], [[Anton Pannekoek]], [[Sylvia Pankhurst]], Otto Ruhl ''Non-Leninist Marxism: Writings on the Workers Councils''. Red and Black, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and its derivatives such as [[Stalinism]], [[Ceaușism]] and [[Maoism]]. Libertarian Marxism is also often critical of [[reformist]] positions, such as those held by [[social democrats]]. Libertarian Marxist currents often draw from Marx and Engels' later works, specifically the ''[[Grundrisse]]'' and ''[[The Civil War in France]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Ernesto Screpanti, Libertarian communism: Marx Engels and the Political Economy of Freedom, Palgrave Macmillan, London, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizing the Marxist belief in the ability of the [[working class]] to forge its own destiny without the need for a revolutionary party or [[State (polity)|state]] to mediate or aid its liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Draper, Hal. [https://jps.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/srv/article/view/5333"The Principle of Self-Emancipation in Marx and Engels"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723070247/https://jps.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/srv/article/view/5333|date=23 July 2011}} ''Socialist Register''. Vol 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with anarchism, libertarian Marxism is one of the main currents of [[libertarian socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam. [http://chomsky.info/audionvideo/19700216.mp3 "Government In The Future"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121062818/http://chomsky.info/audionvideo/19700216.mp3|date=21 November 2010}} Poetry Center of the New York YM-YWHA. Lecture.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic critiques ===
Other critiques come from an economic standpoint. [[Vladimir Karpovich Dmitriev]] writing in 1898,&lt;ref&gt;V. K. Dmitriev, 1974 (1898), ''Economic Essays on Value, Competition and Utility''. Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ladislaus Bortkiewicz|Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz]] writing in 1906–1907&lt;ref&gt;Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz, 1952 (1906–1907), "Value and Price in the Marxian System", ''International Economic Papers'' 2, 5–60; Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz, 1984 (1907), "On the Correction of Marx's Fundamental Theoretical Construction in the Third Volume of ''Capital''". In Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk 1984 (1896), ''Karl Marx and the Close of his System'', Philadelphia: Orion Editions.&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent critics have alleged that Marx's [[value theory]] and law of the [[tendency of the rate of profit to fall]] are internally inconsistent. In other words, the critics allege that Marx drew conclusions that actually do not follow from his theoretical premises. Once these alleged errors are corrected, his conclusion that aggregate price and profit are determined by and equal to aggregate value and surplus value no longer holds true. This result calls into question his theory that the exploitation of workers is the sole source of profit.&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Howard and J. E. King. (1992) A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929–1990, chapter 12, sect. III. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Marxism and socialism have received considerable critical analysis from multiple generations of [[Austrian School|Austrian economists]] in terms of scientific methodology, economic theory and political implications.&lt;ref&gt;Sennholz, Hans F. [https://mises.org/daily/3910/What-We-Can-Know-About-the-World "What We Can Know About The World"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Von Mises, Ludwig. [https://books.google.com/books/about/Omnipotent_Government.html?id=QoOMaqfdpT4C "Omnipotent Government"].&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Marginal utility#The Marginal Revolution|marginal revolution]], subjective value theory was rediscovered by [[Carl Menger]], a development that fundamentally undermined the British cost theories of value. The restoration of subjectivism and [[praxeological]] methodology previously used by classical economists including [[Richard Cantillon]], [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot]], [[Jean-Baptiste Say]] and [[Frédéric Bastiat]] led Menger to criticise [[historicist]] methodology in general. Second-generation Austrian economist [[Eugen Böhm von Bawerk]] used praxeological and subjectivist methodology to attack the law of value fundamentally. Non-Marxist economists have regarded his criticism as definitive, with [[Gottfried Haberler]] arguing that Böhm-Bawerk's critique of Marx's economics was so thorough and devastating that as of the 1960s no Marxian scholar had conclusively refuted it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gottfried Haberler]] in [[Milorad M. Drachkovitch]] (ed.), ''Marxist Ideology in the Contemporary World – Its Appeals and Paradoxes'' (New York: Praeger, 1966), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Third-generation Austrian [[Ludwig von Mises]] rekindled debate about the [[economic calculation problem]] by identifying that without price signals in capital goods, all other aspects of the market economy are irrational. This led him to declare that "rational economic activity is impossible in a socialist [[commonwealth]]".&lt;ref name="Mises"&gt;{{cite book|title=Economic calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth|accessdate=9 August 2008|last=Von Mises|first=Ludwig|authorlink=Ludwig von Mises|date=1990|format=PDF|publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]|url=https://mises.org/pdf/econcalc.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daron Acemoglu]] and [[James A. Robinson (economist)|James A. Robinson]] argue that Marx's economic theory was fundamentally flawed because it attempted to simplify the economy into a few general laws that ignored the impact of institutions on the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Acemoglu |first1=Daron |last2=Robinson |first2=James A. |title=The Rise and Decline of General Laws of Capitalism |journal=NBER Working Paper Series |date=December 2014 |url=https://www.nber.org/papers/w20766.pdf |accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Nakchong.jpg|thumb|Nakchhong, the kirat priest.]]
'''Nakchhong''' (नाक्छोङ) are priests of the [[Kirati]] people, an ethnic group that is predominantly located in the [[Himalayas]].  

Nakchhong maintain a [[vegetarian]] diet as part of their spiritual regime.  The Kirati believe that Nakchhong are chosen bodies of good spirits.  One of the foremost Kirat, Mundhum, has taught that there are two types of spirits.  Rumahang, the divine spirit, is a supreme spirit who created the universe and living beings on this earth.  Rumahang represents truth, happiness, compassion and love.  Conversely, the devil spirit represents destruction, jealousy and hatred. Thus, Nakchhong act under Rumahang against the devil spirits.  

Those who possess a magical weapon (any kind of BAN to harm or kill another) are regarded as chosen bodies of the devil spirit.  On the other hand, Nakchhong do not have any magical weapons to harm or kill other living beings.

Nakchhong frequently work with the following materials:
*[[Aduwa (Kirat culture)|Aduwa]] (ginger)
*[[Pokhemma]]
*[[Tupla (Kirat culture)|Tupla]] (cut pieces of the front part of a banana leaf)
*Chindo: Gourd filled with [[Jand (Kirat culture)|Jand]] (millet beer)

{{Irreligion sidebar|expanded=nontheism}}
'''Nontheistic religions''' are traditions of [[religious belief|thought]] within a [[religion | religious context]]—some otherwise aligned with [[theism]], others not—in which [[nontheism]] informs religious beliefs or practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=  Williams|first= J. Paul|author2= Horace L. Friess|authorlink2=Horace L. Friess |title= The Nature of Religion|journal= Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|year= 1962|volume= 2|issue= 1|pages= 3–17|jstor= 1384088|publisher= Blackwell Publishing|doi= 10.2307/1384088}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nontheism has been applied{{by whom?|date=June 2018}} to the fields of [[Christian apologetics]] and general [[liberal theology]], and plays significant roles in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Satanism]]. While many approaches to religion exclude nontheism by definition, some inclusive definitions of religion show how religious practice and belief do not depend on the presence of god(s). For example, [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] and [[Peter Mandaville]] distinguish between religion and [[spirituality]], but provide a definition of the term that avoids the usual reduction to "religions of the book":

{{quote|Religion can be defined as a relatively-bounded system of beliefs, symbols and practices that addresses the nature of existence, and in which communion with others and Otherness is lived as if it both takes in and spiritually transcends socially-grounded ontologies of time, space, embodiment and knowing.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Existence of gods ===
{{See also|God in Buddhism}}

The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] said that ''[[Deva (Buddhism)|devas]]'' (translated as "gods") do exist, but they were regarded as still being trapped in ''[[Samsara (Buddhism)|samsara]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Thirty-one planes of Existence|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sagga/loka.html|publisher=Access To Insight|accessdate=May 26, 2010|author=John T Bullitt|year=2005|quote=The suttas describe thirty-one distinct "planes" or "realms" of existence into which beings can be reborn during this long wandering through samsara. These range from the extraordinarily dark, grim, and painful hell realms to the most sublime, refined, and exquisitely blissful heaven realms. Existence in every realm is impermanent; in Buddhist cosmology there is no eternal heaven or hell. Beings are born into a particular realm according to both their past kamma and their kamma at the moment of death. When the kammic force that propelled them to that realm is finally exhausted, they pass away, taking rebirth once again elsewhere according to their kamma. And so the wearisome cycle continues.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are not necessarily wiser than we. In fact, the Buddha is often portrayed as a teacher of the gods,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Teacher of the Devas|year=1997|publisher=Buddhist Publication Society|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/jootla/wheel414.html|author=Susan Elbaum Jootla|editor=Access To Insight|location=Kandy, Sri Lanka|chapter=II. The Buddha Teaches Deities|quote="Many people worship Maha Brahma as the supreme and eternal creator God, but for the Buddha he is merely a powerful deity still caught within the cycle of repeated existence. In point of fact, "Maha Brahma" is a role or office filled by different individuals at different periods." "His proof included the fact that "many thousands of deities have gone for refuge for life to the recluse Gotama" (MN 95.9). Devas, like humans, develop faith in the Buddha by practicing his teachings." "A second deva concerned with liberation spoke a verse which is partly praise of the Buddha and partly a request for teaching. Using various similes from the animal world, this god showed his admiration and reverence for the Exalted One.", "A discourse called Sakka's Questions (DN 21) took place after he had been a serious disciple of the Buddha for some time. The sutta records a long audience he had with the Blessed One which culminated in his attainment of stream-entry. Their conversation is an excellent example of the Buddha as "teacher of devas," and shows all beings how to work for Nibbana."}}&lt;/ref&gt; and superior to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhikku|first=Thanissaro|title=Kevaddha Sutta|year=1997|publisher=Access To Insight|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.11.0.than.html#bigbrahma|authorlink=Digha Nikaya, 11|quote=When this was said, the Great Brahma said to the monk, 'I, monk, am Brahma, the Great Brahma, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Sovereign Lord, the Maker, Creator, Chief, Appointer and Ruler, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be... That is why I did not say in their presence that I, too, don't know where the four great elements... cease without remainder. So you have acted wrongly, acted incorrectly, in bypassing the Blessed One in search of an answer to this question elsewhere. Go right back to the Blessed One and, on arrival, ask him this question. However he answers it, you should take it to heart.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the time of the Buddha, the denial of the existence of a [[creator deity]] has been seen as a key point in distinguishing Buddhist from non-Buddhist views.&lt;ref&gt;B. Alan Wallace, ''Contemplative Science.'' Columbia University Press, 2007, pages 97-98.&lt;/ref&gt; The question of an independent creator deity was answered by the Buddha in the [[Brahmajala Sutta (Theravada)|Brahmajala Sutta]]. The Buddha denounced the view of a creator and sees that such notions are related to the false view of [[Sassatavada|eternalism]], and like the 61 other views, this belief causes [[Dukkha|suffering]] when one is [[Upādāna|attached]] to it and states these views may lead to desire, aversion and delusion. At the end of the Sutta the Buddha says he knows these 62 views and he also knows the truth that surpasses them.

===Metaphysical questions===
On one occasion, when presented with a problem of [[metaphysics]] by the monk Malunkyaputta, the Buddha responded with the [[Parable of the Poison Arrow]]. When a man is shot with an arrow thickly smeared with poison, his family summons the doctor to have the poison removed, and the doctor gives an antidote:&lt;ref name=hanh&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|But the man refuses to let the doctor do anything before certain questions can be answered.  The wounded man demands to know who shot the arrow, what his caste and job is, and why he shot him.  He wants to know what kind of bow the man used and how he acquired the ingredients used in preparing the poison.  Malunkyaputta, such a man will die before getting the answers to his questions.  It is no different for one who follows the Way.  I teach only those things necessary to [[Bodhi|realize the Way]].  Things which are not helpful or necessary, I do not teach.}}

== Christianity ==
 {{Main|Secular theology|Christian atheism}}
A few [[Liberal Christianity|liberal Christian]] [[theologians]], define a "nontheistic God" as "the ground of all being" rather than as a personal [[divinity|divine]] [[being]]. [[John Shelby Spong]] refers to a theistic God as "a personal being with expanded supernatural, human, and parental qualities, which has shaped every religious idea of the Western world."&lt;ref&gt;''A New Christianity for a New World: Why Traditional Faith Is Dying and How a New Faith Is Being Born'', {{ISBN|0-06-067063-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a nontheist, [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist]], and [[rationalism|rationalist]] perspective, the concept of divine grace appears to be the same concept as [[luck]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Arnold S. "Ability", ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 60, No. 19&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bust of Paul Johannes Tillich (daylight).JPG|170px|thumb|right|Bust of [[Paul Tillich]]]]
	
Many of them owe much of their [[theology]] to the work of Christian existentialist [[philosopher]] [[Paul Tillich]], including the phrase "the ground of all being". Another quotation from Tillich is, "God does not exist. He is being itself beyond essence and existence. Therefore to argue that God exists is to deny him."&lt;ref&gt;Tillich, Paul. (1951) ''Systematic Theology'', p.205.&lt;/ref&gt; This Tillich quotation summarizes his conception of God. He does not think of God as a being that exists in time and space, because that constrains God, and makes God finite. But all beings are finite, and if God is the Creator of all beings, God cannot logically be finite since a finite being cannot be the sustainer of an infinite variety of finite things. Thus God is considered beyond being, above finitude and limitation, the power or essence of being itself. 

===Nontheist Quakers=== 
[[File:Nontheist.JPG|thumb|150px|Logo of the Society of Nontheist Friends]]
{{Main|Nontheist Quakers}}
A nontheist Friend or an atheist Quaker is someone who affiliates with, identifies with, engages in and/or affirms [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] practices and processes, but who does not accept a belief in a theistic understanding of [[God]], a Supreme Being, the [[divinity|divine]], the [[soul]] or the [[supernatural]]. Like theistic Friends, nontheist Friends are actively interested in realizing centered [[peace]], simplicity, integrity, community, equality, [[love]], [[happiness]] and [[social justice]] in the Society of Friends and beyond.

== Hinduism ==
{{Main|Atheism in Hinduism}}
Hinduism is characterised by extremely diverse beliefs and practices.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Robinson, ''Interpretations of the Bhagavad-Gītā and Images of the Hindu Tradition: The Song of the Lord.'' Routledge Press, 1992, page 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of [[R.C. Zaehner]], "it is perfectly possible to be a good Hindu whether one's personal views incline toward [[monism]], [[monotheism]], [[polytheism]], or even [[atheism]]."&lt;ref name="Catherine Robinson 1992, page 51"&gt;Catherine Robinson, ''Interpretations of the Bhagavad-Gītā and Images of the Hindu Tradition: The Song of the Lord.'' Routledge Press, 1992, page 51.&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to say that it is a religion that neither depends on the existence or non-existence of God or Gods.&lt;ref&gt;R. C. Zaehner, (1966) ''Hinduism'', P.1-2, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, Hinduism can be seen as having three more important strands: one featuring a personal Creator or Divine Being, one that emphasises an impersonal Absolute and a third that is pluralistic and non-absolute. The latter two traditions can be seen as nontheistic.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, Paul J, (2005) ''Nontheistic Conceptions of the Divine'' Ch. 3. in  T''he Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Religion'' by William J Wainwright, p.59 . Oxford University Press US, {{ISBN|0-19-513809-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Vedas are broadly concerned with the completion of ritual, there are some elements that can be interpreted as either nontheistic or precursors to the later developments of the nontheistic tradition. The oldest Hindu scripture, the [[Rig Veda]] mentions that 'There is only one god though the sages may give it various names' (1.164.46). [[Max Müller]] termed this [[henotheism]], and it can be seen as indicating one, non-dual divine reality, with little emphasis on personality.&lt;ref&gt;Masih, Y. A comparative study of religions, P.164, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 2000 {{ISBN|81-208-0815-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The famous [[Nasadiya Sukta]], the 129th Hymn of the tenth and final Mandala (or chapter) of the Rig Veda,  considers creation and asks "The gods came afterwards, with the creation of this universe. /Who then knows whence it has arisen?".&lt;ref&gt;O'Flaherty, Wendy Doniger, (1981)''The Rig Veda: An Anthology of One Hundred Eight Hymns'' (Classic) Penguin&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen to contain the intuition that there must be a single principle behind all phenomena: 'That one' (tad ekam), self-sufficient, to which distinctions cannot be applied.&lt;ref&gt;Collinson, Diané and Wilkinson, Robert Thirty-Five Oriental Philosophers, P. 39, Routledge, 1994 {{ISBN|0-415-02596-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mohanty, Jitendranath (2000), Classical Indian Philosophy: An Introductory Text, p:1 Rowman &amp; Littlefield, {{ISBN|0-8476-8933-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is with the [[Upanishads]], reckoned to be written in the first millennia (coeval with the ritualistic [[Brahmanas]]), that the Vedic emphasis on ritual was challenged. The Upanishads can be seen as the expression of new sources of power in India. Also, separate from the Upanishadic tradition were bands of wandering ascetics called Vadins whose largely nontheistic notions rejected the notion that religious knowledge was the property of the Brahmins. Many of these were [[shramana]]s, who represented a non-Vedic tradition rooted in India's pre-Aryan history.&lt;ref&gt;Jaroslav Krejčí, Anna Krejčová (1990) Before the European Challenge: The Great Civilizations of Asia and the Middle East, p:170, SUNY Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-0168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis of the Upanishads turned to knowledge, specifically the ultimate identity of all phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Doniger,Wendy, (1990) ''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions'',P. 441, Merriam-Webster, {{ISBN|0-87779-044-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is expressed in the notion of [[Brahman]], the key idea of the Upanishads, and much later philosophizing has been taken up with deciding whether Brahman is personal or impersonal.&lt;ref&gt;Smart, Ninian (1998) The World's Religions P.73-74, CUP {{ISBN|0-521-63748-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The understanding of the nature of Brahman as impersonal is based in the definition of it as 'ekam eva advitiyam' (Chandogya Upanishad 6.2.1) - it is one without a second and to which no substantive predicates can be attached.&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright, William J. (2005) Ch.3 Nontheistic conceptions of the divine. ''The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Religion'' p.67 OUP, {{ISBN|0-19-513809-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, both the [[Chandogya]] and [[Brihadaranyaka]] Upanishads assert that the individual [[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]] and the impersonal Brahman are one.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Richard H. (2004) ''Mysticism and Morality: A New Look at Old Questions'', P. 80, Lexington Books, {{ISBN|0-7391-0784-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mahāvākyas|mahāvākya]] statement [[Tat Tvam Asi]], found in the Chandogya Upanishad, can be taken to indicate this unity.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Robert L, (1991) ''Ganesh: Studies of an Asian God'', SUNY Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-0656-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter Upanishad uses the negative term [[Neti neti]] to 'describe' the divine.
[[File:Patanjali Statue.jpg|270px|thumb|right|[[Patañjali]] statue in Pantanjali Yog Peeth Haridwar]]
Classical [[Samkhya]], [[Mimamsa]], early [[Vaisheshika]] and early [[Nyaya]] schools of Hinduism do not accept the notion of an omnipotent creator God at all.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, Gerald James, Ch. Indian Conceptions of Reality and Divinity found in ''A Companion to World Philosophies'' By Eliot Deutsch, Ronald Bontekoe, P. 352, Blackwell, {{ISBN|0-631-21327-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Kenneth W. and Sarma, D S, Eds. (1953) Ch. 5. P.207 Hindu Religious Thought by Satis Chandra Chatterjee, ''The Religion of the Hindus: Interpreted by Hindus'', Ronald Press. {{ISBN|81-208-0387-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Sankhya and Mimamsa schools no longer have significant followings in India, they are both influential in the development of later schools of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Gavin D, ''An Introduction to Hinduism'',(p.232) CUP, {{ISBN|0-521-43878-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larson, Gerald James,(1999) ''Classical Samkhya'', Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, {{ISBN|81-208-0503-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yoga of [[Patanjali]] is the school that probably owes most to the Samkhya thought. This school is dualistic, in the sense that there is a division between 'spirit' (Sanskrit: [[purusha]]) and 'nature' (Sanskrit: [[prakṛti]]).&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein, Georg (1989), ''Yoga: The Technology of Ecstasy'', Tarcher, {{ISBN|0-87477-520-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It holds Samadhi or 'concentrative union' as its ultimate goal&lt;ref&gt;King, Richard (1999) ''Indian Philosophy: An Introduction to Hindu and Buddhist Thought'', p:191, Edinburgh University Press, {{ISBN|0-7486-0954-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it does not consider God's existence as either essential or necessary to achieving this.&lt;ref&gt;Clements, Richard Pauranik, ''Being a Witness in Theory and Practice of Yoga'' by Knut A. Jacobsen&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bhagavad Gita]], contains passages that bear a monistic reading and others that bear a theistic reading.&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, Keith. E., ''On Interpreting the "Bhagavadgītā"'', Philosophy East and West 32, no 1 (January, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the book as a whole has been interpreted by some who see it as containing a primarily nontheistic message,&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Robinson, ''Interpretations of the Bhagavad-Gītā and Images of the Hindu Tradition: The Song of the Lord''. Routledge Press, 1992, page 45, 98, 115, 136.&lt;/ref&gt; and by others who stress its theistic message.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Robinson, ''Interpretations of the Bhagavad-Gītā and Images of the Hindu Tradition: The Song of the Lord.'' Routledge Press, 1992, pages 47, 51.&lt;/ref&gt; These broadly either follow after either [[Adi Shankara|Sankara]] or [[Ramanuja]]&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Gavin D, ''An Introduction to Hinduism'', (pps 239-234) CUP, {{ISBN|0-521-43878-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a nontheistic passage might be "The supreme Brahman is without any beginning. That is called neither being nor non-being," which Sankara interpreted to mean that Brahman can only be talked of in terms of negation of all attributes—'Neti neti'.&lt;ref&gt;Swami Gambhirananda, (1995), [http://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/ ''Bhagavadgita: with the Commentary of Sankaracharya''], Ch. 13. Vs. 13, Advaita Ashrama, Calcutta {{ISBN|81-7505-150-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Advaita Vedanta]] of [[Gaudapada]] and [[Adi Shankara|Sankara]] rejects theism as a consequence of its insistence that Brahman is "Without attributes, indivisible, subtle, inconceivable, and without blemish, Brahman is one and without a second. There is nothing other than He."&lt;ref&gt;Richards, John, [http://www.realization.org/page/namedoc0/vc/vc_10.htm ''Viveka-Chudamani of Shankara'' Vs 468.]&lt;/ref&gt; This means that it lacks properties usually associated with God such as omniscience, perfect goodness, omnipotence, and additionally is identical with the whole of reality, rather than being a causal agent or ruler of it.&lt;ref&gt;Wainright, William, (2006), [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concepts-god/ ''Concepts of God''], Stanford Encyclopedia of Religion&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jainism==
{{Main|God in Jainism}}
{{Further|Jainism and non-creationism}}
Jain texts claim that the universe consists of ''[[jiva]]'' (life force or souls) and [[ajiva]] (lifeless objects). According to Jain doctrine, the universe and its constituents-soul, matter, space, time, and principles of motion-have always existed. The universe and the matter and souls within it are eternal and uncreated, and there is no omnipotent [[creator god]]. Jainism offers an elaborate cosmology, including heavenly beings/''devas'', but these heavenly beings are not viewed as creators-they are subject to suffering and change like all other living beings, and are portrayed as mortal.

According to the Jain concept of divinity, any soul who destroys its ''[[Karma in Jainism|karmas]]'' and desires, achieves liberation/Nirvana. A soul who destroys all its passions and desires has no desire to interfere in the working of the universe. If godliness is defined as the state of having freed one's soul from ''karmas'' and the attainment of enlightenment/Nirvana and a god as one who exists in such a state, then those who have achieved such a state can be termed gods (''[[Tirthankara]]'').

Besides scriptural authority, Jains also employ [[syllogism]] and [[deductive reasoning]] to refute [[creationism|creationist]] theories. Various views on divinity and the universe held by the [[Historical Vedic religion|vedics]], [[samkhya|sāmkhyas]], mimimsas, Buddhists, and other school of thoughts were criticized by Jain Ācāryas, such as [[Jinasena]] in [[Adipurana|Mahāpurāna]].

==Satanism==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
Lucien Greaves, the founder of [[the Satanic Temple]], argues that contemporary [[Satanism]] is "the future of religion" insofar as it offers a model for how religious traditions can evolve and be maintained without the need for the supernatural, as cultural and philosophical identities that inform the narratives and the rituals of individuals adherents and communities. His organization challenges the traditional view that [[religion]] must incorporate supernatural claims.

==Others==
Philosophical models not falling within established religious structures, such as [[Daoism]], Confucianism,  [[Deism]] and [[Pandeism]], have also been considered to be nontheistic religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Ancient Greek religion==
[[File:Venere di Milo 02.JPG|thumb|upright|Statue of ''[[Aphrodite of Milos]]'', the Greek goddess of love and beauty, ({{circa|100}} BC), [[Louvre]]]]
[[Hesiod]] the writer of the poem ''[[Theogony]]'', which describes the origins and genealogies of the [[Greek gods]] in [[Ancient Greek religion]], suggested that farmers should "Sow naked, and plough naked, and harvest naked, if you wish to bring in all [[Demeter]]'s fruits in due season."{{sfn|Villing|2010|p=40}} [[Demeter]] is the goddess of the harvest and agriculture, who presided over grains and the fertility of the earth.

== Abrahamic religions ==

The [[Abrahamic religion]]s of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam all recount the legend of the [[Garden of Eden]], found in the [[Hebrew Bible]], in which [[Adam and Eve]] are unaware of their nakedness until they eat the fruit of the [[Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil]].  After this, they feel ashamed and try to cover themselves with fig leaves.{{bibleverse||Genesis|3:74|NIV}} Judaism does not share the Christian association of nakedness with [[original sin]], an aspect integral to the doctrine of redemption and salvation. In Islam the garden is in Paradise, not on Earth. {{efn|when they tasted of the tree, their shame became manifest to them, and they began to sew together the leaves of the garden over their bodies.{{Cite quran|7|22}} }} This is to show that women and men should be covered in clothing, for nudity has the stigma of shame attached to it.{{efn|O children of Adam! We have indeed sent down to you clothing to cover your shame, and (clothing) for beauty and clothing that guards (against evil), that is the best.{{Cite quran|7|26}} }} Each of these religions has its own unique understanding of what is meant to be taught with the recounting of the story of Adam and Eve.

{{see also|Tzniut}}

In Judaism, nudity is an aspect of [[body modesty]] which is regarded as very important in most social and familial situations. Attitudes to modesty vary between the different movements within Judaism as well as between communities within each movement. In more strict (orthodox) communities, modesty is an aspect of [[Tzniut]] which generally has detailed rules of what is appropriate behaviour. [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] and [[Reform Judaism]] generally promote modesty values but do not regard the strict Tzniut rules as binding, with each person being permitted (at least in principle) to set their own standards. With the exception of the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] community, Jewish communities generally tend to dress according to the standards of the society in which they find themselves.

A person who enters a ritual bath (a ''[[mikveh]]'') does so without clothing, and with no jewelry or even bandages.

Care needs to be taken when reading the Bible, where some references to nakedness serve as a euphemism for intimate sexual behaviour.{{sfn|Telushkin|1977|p=17-18}} For example, in the story of Noah we see the hesitancy of two of [[Noah]]'s sons when they have to cover their father's nakedness, averting their eyes, after Noah's youngest son "saw his father's nakedness and told his two brothers outside" what he had done to his father.{{efn|[Noah] drank the wine [of his vineyard] and became drunk. He uncovered himself inside his tent. Ham saw his father's nakedness and told his two brothers outside. And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid [it] upon both their backs, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces [were] backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness. And when Noah awoke and learned what [Ham] had done to him, he said "Cursed be Canaan [Ham's son], the lowest of slaves shall he be to his brothers.{{bibleverse||Genesis|9:21-25|NIV}} }}{{efn|it has been suggested that this episode involved Ham doing more than just viewing his father's nakedness.{{sfn|Edwards|1978|p=113}} }} Nakedness may also be a metaphor for empty-handedness, specifically in situations where a sacrifice or offering to God is expected.

=== Christianity ===

[[File:Baptism - Marcellinus and Peter.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Representation of baptism in early Christian art]]
[[File:Chlodwigs taufe.jpg|thumb|upright|Baptism of [[Clovis I]] (496)]]
''{{Main article|Christian naturism}}''

The early Christian Church reflected the contemporary attitudes of Judaism towards nudity. The Old Testament is not positive towards nudity.{{sfn|Knights|1999}} In the [[Old Testament]], Isaiah in {{bibleverse||Isaiah|20|NIV}} walk nude as a sign of shame against Egypt. 

The first recorded [[liturgy]] of [[baptism]], written down by Saint [[Hippolytus of Rome]] in his ''[[Apostolic Tradition]]'', required men, women and children to remove all clothing, including all foreign objects such as jewellery and hair fastenings.{{sfn |Hippolytus|2013|p=33}} {{harvtxt|Guy|2003}}, however argues that complete nudity for baptism candidates (especially women) would not be the norm. He notes that at certain times and in certain places candidates may have been totally naked at the point of baptism, but the Jewish taboo of female nakedness would have mitigated widespread practice of naked baptism.

Later [[Christian]] attitudes to nudity became more restrictive, and baptisms were segregated by sex and then later were usually performed with clothed participants. Some of the [[Eastern Orthodox church]]es today maintain the early church's liturgical use of baptismal nudity, particularly for infants but also for adults.

Several saints, such as a number of the [[Desert Fathers]] as well as [[Basil Fool for Christ]], practiced nudity as a form of [[ascetic]] poverty.

Early Christian art included depictions of nudity in baptism. When artistic endeavours revived following the [[Renaissance]], the [[Catholic Church]] was a major sponsor of art bearing a religious theme, many of which included subjects in various states of dress and including full nudity. Painters sponsored by the Church included [[Raphael]], [[Caravaggio]] and [[Michelangelo]], but there were many others. Many of these paintings and statues were and continue to be displayed in churches, some of which were painted as murals, the most famous of which are at the [[Sistine Chapel]] painted by Michelangelo.

{{harvtxt|Smith|1966}}, in discussing [[logion]] 37{{efn|Jesus' disciples ask, "When will you be revealed to us and when will we see you? Jesus said: When you unclothe yourselves without being ashamed and take off your clothes and put them under your feet as little children and tread on them, then [shall you see] the Son of the Living One and you shall not fear"&lt;ref name="free_Gosp"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Gospel of Thomas Translated by Paterson Brown | author =  | work = freelyreceive.net | date =  | accessdate = 2016-07-18 | url = http://freelyreceive.net/metalogos/files/thomas.html#37 | language =   | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 }} of the [[Gospel of Thomas]], notes that early Christian art depicts,{{sfn|Wilpert|1929}} as one would expect, Adam and Eve in Paradise naked. The only other Old Testament figures who are depicted nude are [[Jonah]] emerging from the mouth of the Great Fish, [[Daniel]] emerging from the Lion's Den, and the resurrected in [[Ezekiel]]'s vision of the dry bones:&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref |Ezekiel|37:1|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; these Old Testament scenes containing nude figures are precisely those which were held to be types of the [[resurrection]]. Among the New Testament illustrations, apart from baptismal scenes, there are nudes only in one representation of the raising of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] and one representation of the [[Miracle at Cana]].

In 1981, [[Pope John Paul II]] expressed the Catholic Church's attitude to the exposure of the human body in ''[[Love and Responsibility]]'': "The human body can remain nude and uncovered and preserve intact its splendour and its beauty... Nakedness as such is not to be equated with physical shamelessness... Immodesty is present only when nakedness plays a negative role with regard to the value of the person... The human body is not in itself shameful... Shamelessness (just like shame and modesty) is a function of the interior of a person."{{sfn|Wojtyla|2013|p=}}

=== Christian sects ===

Sects have arisen within [[Christianity]] from time to time that have viewed nudity in a more positive light. For example, to the [[Adamites]] and the [[Freedomites]] social nudity was an integral part of their ritual.

Today, [[Christian naturist]]s maintain that [[naturism|social nudity]] is a normal part of Christianity and is acceptable. {{harvtxt|De Clercq|2011}} argues that the significance of the human need for clothing by far exceeds its theological meaning.

=== Islam ===

''{{Main article|Intimate parts in Islam}}''

In [[Islam]] the area of the body not meant to be exposed in public is called the ''[[awrah]]'', and while referred to in the [[Qur'an]], is addressed in more detail in [[hadith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bukhari:6:60:282|url=http://www.sultan.org/books/bukhari/060.htm#006.060.282}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunnan Abu Dawud 32:4091|url=http://www.2muslims.com/directory/hadith/sunnan_abu_dawud/32/4091}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Sunni tradition, the male ''awrah'' is from the navel to knees. Other denominations have differing interpretations. For women, there are different classifications of ''awrah''. In public, many Muslim women wear the [[hijab]] and long dresses which covers most of their head and body, with only specific body parts such as hands and face exposed. But in front of direct family (parents, children, siblings), the ''awrah'' is relaxed further, allowing them to be uncovered, except between the chest and the thighs. [[Sharia]] law in some Islamic countries requires women to observe [[purdah]], covering their entire bodies, including the face (see [[niqab]] and [[burqa]]), However, the degrees of covering vary according to local custom and/or interpretation of Sharia law.

* '''For men''', the [[awrah]] is from the navel (not inclusive) to the knees (not inclusive according to the [[Shafi'i]]s, [[Hanbali]]s and [[Maliki]]s; inclusive according to the [[Hanafi]]s). However, in most Islamic cultures, a man is frowned upon should he walk around in public without covering the upper half of his body.
* '''For women''', in front of non-[[mahram]] men and non-Muslim women, the [[awrah]] is the whole body, apart from the hands and the face (and, solely according to the Hanafis, the feet). In front of Muslim women it is from the navel (not inclusive) to the knees (not inclusive according to the [[Shafi'i]]s, [[Hanbali]]s and [[Maliki]]s, inclusive according to the [[Hanafi]]s), and with [[mahram]] men there are three opinions:
# It is from the shoulders (inclusive) down to the knees (inclusive). ([[Hanbali]] opinion)
# It is from the stomach (inclusive) down to the knees (inclusive according to the [[Hanafis]], but not according to the [[Shafi'i]]s and [[Maliki]]s). ([[Hanafi]], [[Shafi'i]], and [[Maliki]] opinion)
# It is from the navel (not inclusive) to the knees (inclusive) when with either. (Alternate [[Hanafi]] opinion)

* '''For both genders''', it is encouraged to wear loose clothing. Note that the awrah is not necessarily what is preferable to wear but what is the bare minimum. It is reported that [[Muhammad]] said, "Modesty is a part of faith."&lt;ref&gt;Bukhari and Muslim&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indian religions ==

[[File:Naga baba.jpg|thumb|right|Naga mystics, at the Hindu bathing ceremony of Ardha [[Kumbh Mela]], at [[Allahabad]]]]

In ancient [[Indian Subcontinent|Indian]] cultures, there was a tradition of extreme asceticism (obviously [[minoritarian]]) that included full nudity. This tradition continued from the [[gymnosophists]] (philosophers in antiquity) to certain holy men (who may however cover themselves with ashes) in present-day [[Hindu]] devotion and in [[Jainism]].

=== Hinduism ===
====Philosophical basis====
The philosophical basis of nudity arises out of the concept of ‘Purushartha’ (four ends of human life). ‘Purushartha’ ([[Puruṣārtha]]) are ‘Kama’ (enjoyment), ‘Artha’ (wealth), ‘Dharma’ (virtue) and ‘Moksha’ (liberation). It is ‘Purushartha’ which impels a human being towards nudity or any of its related aspect(s) either for spiritual aim or for the aim of enjoyment. Practice of ‘Dharma’ (virtue) brings good result(s) and non-practice of ‘Dharma’ leads to negative result(s).&lt;ref&gt;Sanyal, Jagdiswar, Guide to Indian Philosophy, Sribhumi Publishing Company, 79, Mahatma Gandi Road, Kolkata – 700 009 (ed. 1999) pp.9 and 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;
=====Spiritual basis=====
In the spiritual aspect of Hinduism nudity symbolizes renunciation ('tyaga' in Hindi) of the highest type. A nude person or deity (for example [[Kali]] is a nude deity) denotes one who is devoid of [[Maya (religion)|Maya]] or attachment to the body and one who is an embodiment of infinity. &lt;ref&gt;Pravrajika Vedantaprana, Saptahik Bartaman, Volume 28, Issue 23, Bartaman Private Ltd., 6, JBS Haldane Avenue, 700 105 (ed. 10 October, 2015) p.16&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Trailanga Swami]], the famous nude saint of India, had given an explanation for nudity in religion in the following words, “Lahiri Mahasaya is like a divine kitten, remaining wherever the Cosmic Mother has placed him. While dutifully playing the part of a worldly man, he has received that perfect Self-realization which I have sought by renouncing everything – even my loincloth!”&lt;ref&gt;Yogananda, Paramhansa , Autobiography of a Yogi, Chapter 31: An Interview with the Sacred Mother, Jaico Publishing House, 127, Mahatma Gandhi Road Fort, Mumbai  - 400 023 (ed. 1997) p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Material basis=====
In comparison in the material aspect nudity is considered an art. This view is supported by Sri Aurobindo in his book ''The Renaissance in India''. He says about Hinduism in the book – “Its spiritual extremism could not prevent it from fathoming through a long era the life of the senses and its enjoyments, and there too it sought the utmost richness of sensuous detail and the depths and intensities of sensual experience. Yet it is notable that this pursuit of the most opposite extremes never resulted in disorder…”&lt;ref&gt; SRINVANTU Magazine, 63, College Street, Kolkata – 700 073(ed. 8th June, 2018) pp.26 and 28 (Website: http://srinvantu.com/ &lt;/ref&gt;
Extreme hedonists and materialists like the [[Charvaka]]s are very candid with regard to pursuing of sensual pleasures. They say, “Marthakamaveva purusharthau” (Riches and pleasure is the summum bonum of life). ).&lt;ref&gt;Sanyal, Jagdiswar, Guide to Indian Philosophy, Sribhumi Publishing Company, 79, Mahatma Gandi Road, Kolkata – 700 009 (ed. 1999) p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;There is another sloka in support of their view – “Anganalingananadijanyam sukhameva purusatha” (The sensual pleasure arising from the embrace of a woman and other objects is the highest good or end) ).&lt;ref&gt;Sanyal, Jagdiswar, Guide to Indian Philosophy, Sribhumi Publishing Company, 79, Mahatma Gandi Road, Kolkata – 700 009 (ed. 1999) p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;
For non-hedonists pursuing [[kama]] (sensual pleasures) accompanied with [[dharma]] (virtue) can be the highest ideal or goal in life. There is nothing wrong in it. ).&lt;ref&gt;Sanyal, Jagdiswar, Guide to Indian Philosophy, Sribhumi Publishing Company, 79, Mahatma Gandi Road, Kolkata – 700 009 (ed. 1999) p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

====Occurrence====
Some of the famous nude male and female yogi (male and female saints of India) of Hinduism include Lalla Yogishwari ([[Lalleshwari]]) &lt;ref&gt;Yogananda, Paramhansa , Autobiography of a Yogi, Chapter 20: We Do Not Visit Kashmir, Jaico Publishing House, 127, Mahatma Gandhi Road Fort, Mumbai  - 400 023 (ed. 1997) p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;, Trailanga Swami, Harihar Baba, Tota Puri. &lt;ref&gt;Roy Sankarnath, Bharater Sadhak (Saints of India), 3 and 4, Hare Street, Kolkata – 700 001 (ed.  1980, Volume 7) pp. 187 and 251&lt;/ref&gt;Also in the biography of saint Gorakhnath we have reference to  nude male and female yogis who had visited the famous Amarnath Temple during medieval period of India.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Sankarnath, Bharater Sadhak (Saints of India), 3 and 4, Hare Street, Kolkata – 700 001 (ed.  1980, Volume 7) p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; 

Among the Hindu religious sects, only the [[sadhu]]s (monks) of the [[Nāga]] sect can be seen nude.{{sfn|Crooke|1919}} They usually wear a loin-cloth around their waist, but not always; and usually remain in their [[Akhara]] or deep forest or isolation and come out in public only once every four years during [[Kumbh Mela]]. They have a very long history and are warrior monks, who usually also carry a ''[[talwar]]'' ([[sword]]), ''[[trishula|trishul]]'' ([[trident]]), ''bhala'' ([[javelin]]) or such weapons, and in medieval times have fought many wars to protect Hindu temples and shrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Siddharth|first1=Gautam|title=Nagas: Once were warriors|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/Nagas-Once-were-warriors/articleshow/18026313.cms|website=Times of India|publisher=Times Syndication Service|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jainism ===

In the ''[[Digambara]]'' sect of [[Jainism]], monks and nuns are "sky-clad" and the members of this sect also keep their holy statues naked. However, the ''[[Śvētāmbara|Shwetambar]]'' sect is "white-clad" and their holy statues wear a loin cloth.{{sfn|Sharma| Sharma|2004|p=262}}

== New religious movements ==

[[File:Raëlian Women at the Seoul, Korea Love Hug Festival.jpg|thumb|upright|Raelians in South Korea]]

=== Neopaganism ===

In many modern [[Neopaganism|neopagan]] [[religious movement]]s, such as [[Wicca]], social and ritual nudity is (relatively) commonplace. In Wicca, the term [[Skyclad (Neopaganism)|''skyclad'']] refers to ritual nudity instead of social nudity.{{sfn|Zimmermann|Gleason|2006|p=77}}

=== Raëlism ===

In [[Raëlism]], nudity is not problematic. Raëlists in North America have formed GoTopless.org, which organizes demonstrations in support of [[topfreedom]] on the basis of the legal and public attitudes to the gender inequality. GoTopless sponsors an annual "[[Go Topless Day]]" protest (also known as "National GoTopless Day", "International Go-Topless Day", etc.) in advocacy for women's right to go topless on gender equality grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moye|first1=David|title=Take Off Your Shirt Everybody!

They apply principles used in organizing communities developing open-source software for organizing group efforts innovating with human culture. New open-source religions may develop their rituals, praxes, or systems of beliefs through a continuous process of refinement and dialogue among participating practitioners.

==Origin==

In 1994, with his essay, "The Holy War: Mac vs. DOS," the scholar and novelist [[Umberto Eco]] popularized the use of religious metaphors in comparing [[operating system]] design and user experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eco|first1=Umberto|title=The Holy War: Mac vs. DOS|journal=Espresso|date=September 30, 1994|url=http://cliffarnold.com/macvdos.pdf|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1990s, the term "open-source religion" began appearing in technology magazines as a reference to the open-source [[Linux]] operating system's organizing principle and as an analogy for highlighting the philosophical differences between advocates of open-source vs. proprietary software .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liebmann|first1=Lenny|title=Say Hello to the 'Lintel' Reformation|journal=Computerworld|date=May 10, 1999|volume=33|issue=19|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90foRW8FHpkC&amp;pg=PT31&amp;dq=%22Open+Source+Religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KIAAVfW0JYmbyQSr6IHIBA&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foster|first1=Ed|title=Apple padlocks UI decor|journal=InfoWorld|date=June 6, 2001|volume=23|issue=24|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_TgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=%22Open+Source+Religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KIAAVfW0JYmbyQSr6IHIBA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, [[Daniel Kriegman]] began describing a religion he invented called Ozacua (later Yoism) as "the world's first opensource religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ozacua: the Living Religion (5 April 2001) |url=http://www.ozacua.com/ |website=ozacua.com |publisher=Daniel Kriegman |accessdate=11 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010419072235/http://www.ozacua.com/ |archivedate=April 19, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lovink|first1=Geert|title=Dark Fiber: Tracking Critical Internet Culture|date=2002|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-12249-9|page=334|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p_7YWf9WpwYC&amp;pg=PA334&amp;dq=%22Open+Source+Religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KIAAVfW0JYmbyQSr6IHIBA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=religion&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of an "open source religion" was further expanded upon by the media theorist, [[Douglas Rushkoff]] in his book, ''Nothing's Sacred: The Truth about Judaism'' (2003), where he offered the following description as an introduction to [[Open Source Judaism]]:
:An open source religion would work the same way as open source software development: it is not kept secret or mysterious at all. Everyone contributes to the codes we use to comprehend our place in the universe. We allow our religion to evolve based on the active participation of its people....An open source relationship to religion would likewise take advantage of the individual points of view of its many active participants to develop its more resolved picture of the world and our place within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rushkoff|first=Douglas|title=Nothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism|year=2004|publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=USA|page=111|isbn=1400051398|url=http://www.rushkoff.com/nothing-sacred/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discordianism, Copyleft, and open-source software===
[[File:Principia Discordia page "00075-Page 00088".jpg|thumb|Page of the Principia Discordia that includes the following Copyright disclaimer, "Ⓚ ALL RIGHTS REVERSED – Reprint what you like," the earliest example of what would become a declaration of [[copyleft]].]]
[[File:Circled latin capital letter k.svg|thumb|Discordian reference to the mythological Kallisti, or [[Apple of Discord]], by way of a kosher food symbol in place of a conventional Copyright symbol.]]
Before the coinage of the term [[open-source]] in 1998 or even the birth of the [[Free Software]] movement, the ''[[Principia Discordia]]'', a [[Discordian]] religious text written by [[Malaclypse the Younger|Greg Hill]] with [[Kerry Wendell Thornley]], included the following Copyright disclaimer in its 4th edition (1970), "Ⓚ ALL RIGHTS REVERSED – Reprint what you like." By the summer of 1970, the implications of the disclaimer were being discussed in other [[Underground Press|underground publications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clutterbuck|first1=Brenton|title=Chasing Eris: An Interlude on Copyleft|url=http://historiadiscordia.com/chasing-eris-an-interlude-on-copyleft/|website=Historia Discordia|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Commercial publishers are not likely to be interested in the ''Principia'' due, at least, to the counter copyright on it–for, if they had a good seller, then other publishers could print it out from under them. Consequently publication and distribution will have to occur spontaneously, thru the “underground”, as alternative cultures learn to meet their own needs and provide their own services. This non-commercial limitation of the ''Principia'' is to provide less limitations in other respects, and it is not an accident. The ''Principia'' is not simply a handbook, it is a demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Greater Poop|date=July–August 1970|issue=30|page=1|url=http://historiadiscordia.com/greg-hills-discordian-newsletter-the-greater-poop/greg_hill-197007_08-the_greater_poop-poop30_page_00001/|accessdate=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Via the counterculture, by the mid-1970s, the concept had influenced a generation of Discordians including the nascent hacker culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buxton|first1=Kristin|title=The Lifecycle of the Principia Discordia: The dissemination of the religion disguised as a joke and joke disguised as a religion|url=http://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/articles/principia-discordia|website=The Lazarus Corporation|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project to create [[Tiny BASIC]] was proposed in Bob Albrecht and [[Dennis Allison]]'s ''[[Dr. Dobb's Journal|Dr. Dobb's Journal of Tiny BASIC Calisthenics &amp; Orthodontia]]'', a journal of the [[Homebrew Computer Club]], a small group of computer hobbyists who began meeting in 1975 around [[Silicon Valley]]. The first lines of the source code for Tiny Basic as released in 1976 by [[Li-Chen Wang]] stated ‘(ↄ) COPYLEFT ALL WRONGS RESERVED’. In 1984/5 programmer [[Don Hopkins]] sent [[Richard Stallman]] a letter labeled "[[Copyleft]]—[[all rights reversed]]". Stallman chose the phrase to identify his free software method of distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution |last= Stallman |first= Richard  |year= 1999 |publisher= O'Reilly Media |isbn= 1-56592-582-3 |pages= 59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between Discordianism and "Kopyleft" remain part of the culture of Discordianism, as explained by the Discordian Rev. Dr. Jon Swabey in his ''Apocrypha Discordia.''
:Discordianism and the concept of KopyLeft go hand in hand. Although just a small part of the counter-culture gestalt, I believe that the ''Principia Discordia'' was probably one of the earliest expressions and strongest champions of this idea, which has since seen such concepts as the [[Open Source Software]] initiative, with endeavours such as the [[Linux]] Operating System.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swabey|first1=Jon|title=Apocrypha Discordia|date=2001|url=http://www.23ae.com/files/apocrypha2.pdf|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open-source in established religious traditions==
For established traditions whose canonical works, records of discourse, and inspired artworks reside in the [[public domain]], keeping these works open and available in the face of proprietary interests has inspired several open-source initiatives. Open access to resources and [[adaptive reuse]] of shared materials under [[open content]] licensing provide a structure by which communities can innovate new religious systems collaboratively under the aegis of copyright law. For some religious movements, however, [[public access]] and [[literacy]], and the potential of adaptive reuse also provide an opportunity for innovation and reform within established traditions. In an interview by [[Alan Jacobs (academic)|Alan Jacobs]] in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' magazine on open-source religion, Aharon Varady (founding director of the [[Open Siddur Project]]) explained that "cultures breathe creativity like we breathe oxygen" arguing that open-source provides one possible strategy for keeping a tradition vibrant while also preserving historical works as non-proprietary during a period of transition from analog to digital media.&lt;ref  name="jacobs"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jacobs|first=Alan|title=The Potential and Promise of Open-Source Judaism|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/06/the-potential-and-promise-of-open-source-judaism/258394/|work=The Atlantic Magazine Online|publisher=The Atlantic Magazine|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open-source Judaism===
Although a work of radical 1960s Jewish counterculture rather than an explicitly religious work, the satirical songbook ''Listen to the mocking bird'' (Times Change Press, 1971) by [[the Fugs]]' [[Tuli Kupferberg|Naphtali "Tuli" Kupferberg]] contains the earliest explicit mention of "copyleft" in a copyright disclaimer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kupferberg|first1=Naphtali|title=Listen to the Mocking Bird: Satiric Songs to Tunes You Know|date=1971|publisher=Times Change Press|location=Washington, New Jersey|url=https://archive.org/stream/2917619.0001.001.umich.edu#page/2/mode/2up|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[Open Source Judaism|open-source efforts in Judaism]] begin to appear in 1988 with the [[free software]] code written for calculating the Hebrew calendar included in [[Emacs]]. After the popularization of the term "[[open-source]]" in 1998, essays and manifestos linking open-source and Judaism began appearing in 2002 among Jewish thinkers familiar with trends in new media and open-source software. In August 2002, Aharon Varady proposed the formation of an "[[Open Siddur Project|Open Siddur]]," an open-source licensed [[user-generated content]] project for digitizing liturgical materials and writing the code needed for the [[web-to-print]] publishing of [[Siddur]]im (Jewish prayer books).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Varady |first1=Aharon |title=update 2002-08-08 |url=http://aharon.varady.net/omphalos/2002/08/update-2002-08-08 |website=Aharon's Omphalos |publisher=Aharon Varady |accessdate=16 June 2014 }} and {{cite web|last=Varady |first=Aharon |title=The Open Siddur Project |url=http://varady.net/open_siddur/ |work=Aharon Varady's Homepage |publisher=The Internet Archive's Wayback Machine |accessdate=5 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021013153654/http://varady.net/open_siddur/ |archivedate=October 13, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, media theorist [[Douglas Rushkoff]] began articulating his understanding of open-source in Judaism. "The object of the game, for me," Rushkoff explained, "was to recontextualize Judaism as an entirely Open Source proposition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rushkoff |first1=Douglas |title=Open-Source Religion |url=http://www.g4tv.com/screensavers/features/44075/OpenSource_Religion.html |website=G4 TV - The Screen Savers |publisher=G4 TV |accessdate=23 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312093353/http://www.g4tv.com/screensavers/features/44075/OpenSource_Religion.html |archivedate=March 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Open-Source Judaism.svg|thumb|Open-Source Judaism logo]]
The term "Open Source Judaism" first appeared in [[Douglas Rushkoff]]'s book ''Nothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism'' (2003). Rushkoff employed the term "Open Source" to describe a democratic organizational model for collaborating in a commonly held source: the [[Hebrew Bible]] and other essential works of [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. Rushkoff conceived of Judaism as essentially an open-source religion which he conceived as, "the contention that religion is not a pre-existing truth but an ongoing project. It may be divinely inspired, but it is a creation of human beings working together. A collaboration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rushkoff|first=Douglas|title=Nothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism|year=2004|publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=USA|isbn=1400051398|url=http://www.rushkoff.com/nothing-sacred/}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Rushkoff, open-source offered the promise of enacting change through a new culture of collaboration and improved access to sources. "Anyone who wants to do Judaism should have access to Judaism. Judaism is not just something that you do, it's something you enact. You've got to learn the code in order to alter it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lehmann-Haupt|first=Rachel|title=Is Judaism Becoming Irrelevant?|url=http://www.alternet.org/story/16146/is_judaism_becoming_irrelevant|accessdate=7 December 2013|newspaper=AlterNet|date=2003-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2003 publication of Rushkoff's book ''Nothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.rushkoff.com/nothingsacred.html|title=Nothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism|author=Douglas Rushkoff|publisher=Three Rivers Press|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an online forum dedicated to "Open Source Judaism" inspired several online projects in creating web applications for generating custom made [[haggadah|haggadot]] for [[Passover]], however neither content nor code for these were shared under [[free content|free-culture]] [[license compatibility|compatible]] [[open content]] terms.

Beginning with the [[Open Siddur Project]] in 2009, open-source projects in Judaism began to publicly share their software code with open-source licenses and their content with [[free content|free-culture]] [[license compatibility|compatible]] [[open content]] licenses. The explicit objectives of these projects also began to differ from Rushkoff's "Open Source Judaism." Rather than seek reforms in religious practices or doctrines, these projects used Open Content licenses to empower users to access and create their own resources from a common store of canonical texts and associated translations and metadata. By 2012, [[Open Source Judaism|open-source projects in Judaism]] were mainly active in facilitating collaboration in sharing resources for transcribing and translating existing works in the Public Domain, and for adaptation and dissemination of works being shared by copyright owners under Open Content licenses.&lt;ref name="jacobs"/&gt;

===Open-source Yoga===
Following proprietary claims on Yoga movements by some Yoga instructors, Open Source Yoga Unity was formed in 2003 to assert that Yoga movements reside in the [[public domain]]. The organization provides a common voice, and the pooling of resources, to legally resist the application of a proprietary [[Copyright]] to any Yoga style thereby "ensuring its continued natural unfettered practice for all to enjoy and develop." The organization explains, that "while we appreciate the teachings of yoga teachers, we do not believe that they have the legal right to impose control over another's Yoga teaching or practice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Open Source Yoga Unity|url=https://www.facebook.com/yogaunity/info?tab=page_info|website=Open Source Yoga Unity Facebook Page|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Open Source Yoga Unity v. Bikram Choudhury (2005), the organization settled out of court, avoiding a federal court hearing to determine whether Bikram Choudhury’s copyrighted sequence of 26 poses and two breathing exercises could be legally protected.&lt;ref&gt;Open Source Yoga Unity v. Bikram Choudhury (N.D. Cal., 4/1/05, No. C 03–3182 PJH)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open-source Wicca===
Concerned with the lack of a source text containing documentation on [[Wicca]] in the tradition of [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], Dr. [[Leo Ruickbie]] self-published ''Open Source Wicca: The Gardnerian Tradition'' (2007) for "putting you back in control of spirituality." The work, a collection of "the original foundation documents of Wicca" authored between 1949 and 1961, was published [http://www.witchology.com/contents/opensourcewicca/gardnerianindex.php digitally] and in print under a [[Creative Commons]] [[Attribution (copyright)|Attribution]] license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ruickbie|first1=Leo|title=Open Source Wicca|url=http://p2pfoundation.net/Open_Source_Wicca|publisher=Leo Ruickbie|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open-source in establishing new religions==
Several projects aiding individuals and communities in formulating their own belief systems cite inspiration from ideas common to the [[open-source movement]] and self-identify as open-source religions or religious initiatives. The establishment of new religions through open-source methods is closely related to [[chaos magic]], which emphasizes the pragmatic use of belief systems and the creation of new and unorthodox methods,&lt;ref name="New Encyclopedia of the Occult"&gt;{{cite book|last=Greer|first=John Michael|title=The New Encyclopedia of the Occult|year=2003|publisher=Llewellyn Publications|location=St. Paul, MN|isbn=9781567183368|pages=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; the difference being that any knowledge gained through such innovation is shared openly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=A.o.C.|first1=Fra.|title=Open Source Magic|url=http://osogd.org/library/the-aerodynamic-biscuits/142-2/|publisher=Open Source Order of the Golden Dawn|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yoism===
[[File:Yoism symbol.svg|thumb|Yoism]]
According to its founder, [[Daniel Kriegman]], Yoism (founded 1994) combines rational inquiry, empiricism, and science with [[Spinoza]]n or [[Einstein]]ian [[pantheism]].&lt;ref name=DemocratAndChronile&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yoism.org/?q=node/409|title=Civil commitment still evolving in N.Y.|author=Gary Craig|date=2011-04-11|publisher=Rochester Democrat and Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url= http://www.yoism.org/?q=node/395|title=Open to Revisions|first=Sam|last=Kean|date=May–June 2009|work=Search Magazine|accessdate=2010-09-19|quote=[Daniel Kriegman] based the [...] religion on a cocktail of rational inquiry, empiricism, and science.

===Belief Genome Project===
The Belief Genome Project aims to use [[crowdsourcing]] to catalog all beliefs as a resource for those wishing to build and discover their own belief system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Sidian M.S.|title=Open Source Religion Basics|url=http://www.opensourcereligion.net/page/open-source-religion-basics|website=OpenSourceReligion.net|publisher=Sidian M.S. Jones|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is an initiative of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100402231809/http://www.opensourcereligion.net/ Open Source Religion Social Network] , a website established in 2009 by Sidian M.S. Jones which he described as "a system for the mixing of religious and non-religious beliefs in an individual, even across multiple religions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Sidian M.S.|title=Open Source Religion|url=http://opensourcereligion.net|website=OpenSourceReligion.net|publisher=Sidian M.S. Jones|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human Worship===

Human Worship, or Open Religion, is an "eternal tradition of considering [[Human]] absolute, highest value", "considering God as Human continuation to infinity through Soul", described in its sacred book, shared in [[public domain]] by the formula "[[All rights reserved]] for [[God]]. Open Soul Holy [[Scripture]] of Human Worship is word of God, common heritage of Humankind, published anonymously, free for copying".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Soul: Holy Scripture of Human Worship|url=https://www.academia.edu/34660139/Open_Soul_Holy_Scripture_of_Human_Worship|website=Academia.edu|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blessing gesture and sacred sign of Open Religion is the [[circle]] or [[zero]],  with the human in the center of [[coordinates]]. Human Worshippers bow to every human [[soul]], laying the hand on [[heart]] and saying "Believe in yourself!". They organize "soul societies" for [[missionary]] work, [[friendship]], [[love]] and common [[joy]]. Also they believe in every human  having the capacity to be a [[prophet]], every human action to be [[prayer]] and all consequences as [[revelation]] from God, claiming that practical experience inspires true [[faith]] and [[skeptics]] are the same holy persons as prophets.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2816">'''Pious fraud''' is used to describe [[fraud]] in [[religion]] or medicine. A pious fraud can be counterfeiting a [[miracle]] or falsely attributing a [[Pseudepigraph|sacred text to a biblical figure]] due to the belief that the "[[Consequentialism|end justifies the means]]", in this case the end of increasing [[faith]] by whatever means available.{{citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for definition of term|date=February 2011}}

==Use of the phrase==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' reports the phrase was first used in English in 1678. [[Edward Gibbon]] was particularly fond of the phrase, using it often in his monumental and controversial work ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' in which he criticized the likelihood of some of the [[martyr]]s and miracles of the early [[Christian]] church.

[[William W. Howells]] wrote that [[shaman]]s know that their tricks are impostures, but that all who studied them agree that they really believe in their power to deal with [[spirit]]s. According to Howells, their main purpose is an honest one and they believe that this justifies the means of hoodwinking his followers in minor technical matters.&lt;ref&gt;William Howells,  1962. ''The Heathens: Primitive Man and his Religions'' [[New York City]]: [[National Museum of American History]] [http://www.amnh.org/] in Robert S. Ellwood ''Civilized Shamans: Sacred Biography and Founders of [[New Religious Movement]]s'',  in ''New Religions in a Postmodern World'' edited by [[Mikael Rothstein]] and Reender Kranenborg (Studies in New Religions [[Aarhus University]] Press) 2003 {{ISBN|87-7288-748-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thomas Jefferson==
{{See also|Religious views of Thomas Jefferson}}
[[Thomas Jefferson]] wrote to a doctor-friend in 1805:
{{quote|One of the most successful physicians I have ever known, has assured me, that he used more bread pills, drops of coloured water, and powders of hickory ashes, than of all other medicines put together. It was certainly a pious fraud.|"Placebo Effects and Science Journalism at the Mind/Body Boundary". Steve Silberman, The Journal of Mind-Body Regulation, 2011}}

==Isaac Newton==
In [[Isaac Newton]]'s dissertation, ''[[An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture]]'', he blames the "Roman Church" for many abuses in the world, accusing it of "pious frauds".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9129">'''Religion and geography''' is the study of the impact of [[geography]], i.e. place and space, on [[religious belief]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Park|first=Chris|title=Routledge Companion to the Study of  Religion|editor=Hinnells, J|publisher=Routledge|date=2004|chapter=Religion and geography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect of the relationship between religion and geography is ''religious geography'', in which geographical ideas are influenced by religion, such as early map-making, and the ''biblical geography'' that developed in the 16th century to identify [[List of Biblical places|places from the Bible]].&lt;ref name="phg.sagepub"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kong|first=Lily|date=1990|title=Geography and religion: trends and prospects|journal=Progress in Human Geography|volume=14|issue=3|pages=355–371|url=http://phg.sagepub.com/cgi/pdf_extract/14/3/355|doi=10.1177/030913259001400302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research traditions==
Traditionally, the relationship between geography and religion can clearly be seen by the influences of religion in shaping cosmological understandings of the world. From the sixteenth and seventeenth century, the study of geography and religion mainly focused on mapping the spread of Christianity (termed ecclesiastical geography by Issac 1965), though in the later half of the seventeenth century, the influences and spread of other religions were also taken into account.&lt;ref name="phg.sagepub" /&gt;

Other traditional approaches to the study of the relationship between geography and religion involved the theological explorations of the workings of Nature – a highly environmentally deterministic approach which identified the role of geographical environments in determining the nature and evolution of different religious traditions.&lt;ref name="phg.sagepub" /&gt;

Thus, geographers are less concerned about religion per se, but are more sensitive to how religion as a cultural feature affects social, cultural, political and environmental systems. The point of focus is not the specifics of religious beliefs and practices, but how these religious beliefs and practices are internalised by adherents, and how these processes of internalization influence, and is influenced by, social systems.

==Sacred places==
Traditional cultural geographical approaches to the study of religion mainly seek to determine religion’s impact on the landscape. A more contemporary approach to the study of the intersections of geography and religion not only highlights the role of religion in affecting landscape changes and in assigning sacred meanings to specific places, but also acknowledges how in turn, religious ideology and practice at specific spaces are guided and transformed by their location.&lt;ref name="phg.sagepub" /&gt;

Religious experiences and the belief in religious meanings transforms physical spaces into sacred spaces. These perceptions and imaginings influence the way such spaces are used, and the personal, spiritual meanings developed in using such sacred spaces. These religiously significant spaces go beyond officially religious/spiritual spaces (such as places of worship) to include non-official religious spaces such as homes, schools and even bodies.&lt;ref name="Kong2005"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kong|first=Lily|date=2005|title=Religious schools: for spirit, (f)or nation|journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|volume=23|pages=615–631|doi=10.1068/d394|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kong|first=Lily|date=2002|title= In Search of Permanent Homes: Singapore's House Churches and the Politics of Space |journal=Urban Studies|volume=39|issue=9|pages=1573–1586|doi=10.1080/00420980220151664}}&lt;/ref&gt; These works have focused on both material aspects of spaces (such as architectural distinctiveness) and socially constructed spaces (such as rituals and demarcation of sacred spaces) to present religious meaning and significance.

A key focus in the study of sacred places is the politics of identity, belonging and meaning that are ascribed to sacred sites, and the constant negotiations for power and legitimacy. Particularly in multicultural settings, the contestation for legitimacy, public approval, and negotiations for use of particular spaces are at the heart of determining how communities understand, internalise and struggle to compete for the right to practice their religious traditions in public spaces.&lt;ref name="phg.sagepub" /&gt;

==Community and identity==
Religion may be a starting point to examine issues of ethnic identity formation and the construction of ethnic identity&lt;ref name="Peach2002"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peach|first=Ceri|date=2002|title=Social Geography: New Religions and Ethnoburbs – Contrasts with Cultural Geography|journal=Progress in Human Geography|volume=26|issue=2|pages=252–260|doi=10.1191/0309132502ph368pr }}&lt;/ref&gt; Geographers studying the negotiations of religious identity within various communities are often concerned with the overt articulation of religious identity, for example, how adherents in different locations establish their distinctive (religious and cultural) identities through their own understandings of the religion, and how they externally present their religious adherence (in terms of religious practice, ritual and behaviour). As an overarching theme, the articulation of religious identity is concerned with material aspects of symbolizing religious identity (such as architecture and the establishment of a physical presence), with negotiations and struggles in asserting religious identity in the face of persecution and exclusion and with personal practices of religious ritual and behaviour that re-establishes one’s religious identity&lt;ref name="Kong2005" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chivallon|first=Christine|date=2001|title=Religion as Space for the Expression of Caribbean Identity in the United Kingdom |journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|volume=19| issue=4|pages=461–483|doi=10.1068/d2341}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gale|first=Richard|date=2007|title=The Place of Islam in the Geography of Religion: Trends and Intersections|journal=Geography Compass|volume=1| issue=5|pages=1015–1036|doi=10.1111/j.1749-8198.2007.00054.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New geographies of religion==
As research on geography and religion has grown, one of the new focuses of geographical research examines the rise of religious fundamentalism, and the resulting impact this has on the geographical contexts in which it develops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stump|first=Roger|title=Boundaries of Faith: Geographical Perspectives on Religious Fundamentalism| publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, migration processes have resulted in the development of religious pluralism in numerous countries, and the landscape changes that accompany the movement and settlement of communities defined by religion is a key focus in the study of geography and religion.&lt;ref name="Kong2010"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kong|first=Lily|date=2010|title=Global shifts, theoretical shifts: Changing geographies of religion |journal=[[Progress in Human Geography]]|volume=34|issue=6|pages=755–776|doi=10.1177/0309132510362602}}&lt;/ref&gt; More work needs to be done to examine the intersections and collisions that occur due to the movement of communities (for example, the migration of Muslim communities to western countries) and highlight how these communities negotiate their religious experiences in new spaces.&lt;ref name="Peach2002" /&gt; Recent research in this area has been published by [[Barry A. Vann]] who analyzes Muslim population shifts in the Western world and the theological factors that play into these demographic trends. &lt;ref&gt;Barry A. Vann (2011), ''Puritan Islam: The Geoexpansion of the Muslim World''. Prometheus Books.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another new area of interest in the study of geography and religion explores different sites of religious practice beyond the ‘officially sacred’ – sites such as religious schools, media spaces, banking and financial practices (for example, [[Islamic banking]]) and home spaces are just some of the different avenues that take into account informal, everyday spaces that intersect with religious practice and meaning.&lt;ref name="Kong2010" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14069">'''Religiosity''' is difficult to define, but different scholars have seen this concept as broadly about religious orientations and involvement. It includes experiential, ritualistic, ideological, intellectual, consequential, creedal, communal, doctrinal, moral, and cultural dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holdcroft|first1=Barbara|title=What is Religiosity?|journal=Catholic Education: A Journal of Inquiry and Practice|date=September 2006|volume=10|issue=1|pages=89–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologists of religion have observed that the people's beliefs, sense of belonging, and behavior often are not congruent with an individual's actual religious beliefs since there is much diversity in how one can be religious or not.&lt;ref name="chaves" /&gt; Multiple problems exist in measuring religiosity. For instance, variables such as church attendance produce different results when different methods are used such as traditional surveys vs time use surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rossi |first1=Maurizio |last2=Scappini |first2=Ettore |title=Church Attendance, Problems of Measurement, and Interpreting Indicators: A Study of Religious Practice in the United States, 1975-2010 |journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |date=June 2014 |volume=53 |issue=2 |page=249–267 |doi=10.1111/jssr.12115 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jssr.12115 |publisher=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |issn=0021-8294}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

==Diversity in an individuals' beliefs, affiliations, and behaviors==

Decades of anthropological, sociological, and psychological research have established that "religious congruence" (the assumption that religious beliefs and values are tightly integrated in an individual's mind or that religious practices and behaviors follow directly from religious beliefs or that religious beliefs are chronologically linear and stable across different contexts) is actually rare. People’s religious ideas are fragmented, loosely connected, and context-dependent; like in all other domains of culture and in life. The beliefs, affiliations, and behaviors of any individual are complex activities that have many sources including culture. As examples of religious incongruence he notes, "Observant Jews may not believe what they say in their Sabbath prayers. Christian ministers may not believe in God. And people who regularly dance for rain don’t do it in the dry season."&lt;ref name="chaves"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chaves|first1=Mark|title=SSSR Presidential Address Rain Dances in the Dry Season: Overcoming the Religious Congruence Fallacy|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|date=March 2010|volume=49|issue=1|pages=1–14|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2009.01489.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demographic studies often show wide diversity of religious beliefs, belonging, and practices in both religious and non-religious populations. For instance, out of Americans who are not religious and not seeking religion: 68% believe in God, 12% are atheists, 17% are agnostics; also, in terms of self-identification of religiosity 18% consider themselves religious, 37% consider themselves as spiritual but not religious, and 42% considers themselves as neither spiritual nor religious; and 21% pray every day and 24% pray once a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.trincoll.edu/aris/files/2011/08/NONES_08.pdf|title=American Nones: The Profile of the No Religion Population|year=2008|publisher=American Religious Identification Survey|accessdate=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pew 2012 breakdown"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/10/09/nones-on-the-rise-religion/ |title=Religion and the Unaffiliated |work="Nones" on the Rise |date=October 9, 2012 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]: Religion &amp; Public Life |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Most Nones Believe God"&gt;{{cite web|title=Most of the Religiously Unaffiliated Still Keep Belief in God|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/daily-number/most-of-the-religiously-unaffiliated-still-keep-belief-in-god/|website=Pew Research Center|date=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global studies on religion also show diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Religious Landscape|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-exec/|website=Pew Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
Numerous studies have explored the different components of human religiosity (Brink, 1993; Hill &amp; Hood 1999). What most have found is that there are multiple dimensions (they often employ [[factor analysis]]). For instance, Cornwall, Albrecht, Cunningham and Pitcher (1986) identify six dimensions of religiosity based on the understanding that there are at least three components to religious behavior: knowing (cognition in the mind), feeling (effect to the spirit), and doing (behavior of the body). For each of these components of religiosity, there were two cross classifications resulting in the six dimensions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cornwall |author2=Albrecht |author3=Cunningham |author4=Pitcher |title=The Dimensions of Religiosity: A Conceptual Model with an Empirical Test|journal=Review of Religious Research|year=1986|volume=27|issue=3|pages=226–244|doi=10.2307/3511418}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cognition
**traditional [[orthodoxy]]
**particularistic orthodoxy
*Effect
**Palpable
**Tangible
*Behavior
**religious behavior
**religious participation

Other researchers have found different dimensions, ranging generally from four to twelve components. What most measures of religiosity find is that there is at least some distinction between religious doctrine, religious practice, and [[spirituality]].

For example{{original research inline|date=February 2011}}, one can accept the truthfulness of the [[Bible]] (belief dimension), but never attend a church or even belong to an organized religion (practice dimension).  Another example is an individual who does not hold orthodox [[Christian]] doctrines (belief dimension), but does attend a [[Charismatic Movement|charismatic]] [[worship]] service (practice dimension) in order to develop his/her sense of oneness with the [[divinity|divine]] (spirituality dimension).

An individual could disavow all doctrines associated with organized religions (belief dimension), not affiliate with an organized religion or attend religious services (practice dimension), and at the same time be strongly committed to a higher power and feel that the connection with that higher power is ultimately relevant (spirituality dimension). These are explanatory examples of the broadest dimensions of religiosity and may not be reflected in specific religiosity measures.

Most dimensions of religiosity are correlated, meaning people who often attend church services (practice dimension) are also likely to score highly on the belief and spirituality dimensions. But individuals do not have to score high on all dimensions or low on all dimensions; their scores can vary by dimension.

[[Sociologists]] have differed over the exact number of components of religiosity. [[Charles Y. Glock|Charles Glock]]'s five-dimensional approach (Glock, 1972: 39) was among the first of its kind in the field of [[sociology of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Glock, C. Y. (1972) ‘On the Study of Religious Commitment’ in J. E. Faulkner (ed.) Religion’s Influence in Contemporary Society, Readings 
in the Sociology of Religion, Ohio: Charles E. Merril: 38-56.&lt;/ref&gt; Other sociologists adapted Glock's list to include additional components (see for example, a  [[Mervin F. Verbit#The Twenty Four-Dimensional Religiosity Measure|six component measure]] by [[Mervin F. Verbit]]).&lt;ref&gt;Verbit, M. F. (1970). The components and dimensions of religious behavior: Toward a reconceptualization of religiosity. American mosaic, 24, 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Küçükcan, T. (2010). Multidimensional Approach to Religion: a way of looking at religious phenomena. Journal for the Study of Religions and Ideologies, 4(10), 60-70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eskieserler.com/dosyalar/mpdf%20(1135).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

(2005) report that the contribution of genes to variation in religiosity (called [[heritability]]) increases from 12% to 44% and the contribution of shared (family) effects decreases from 56% to 18% between [[adolescence]] and [[adulthood]].&lt;ref&gt;L. B. Koenig, M. McGue, R. F. Krueger and T. J. Bouchard, Jr. (2005). Genetic and environmental influences on religiousness: findings for retrospective and current religiousness ratings. ''Journal of Personality'', '''73''', [https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-6494.2005.00316.x 471-88]&lt;/ref&gt;

A market-based theory of religious choice and governmental regulation of religion have been the dominant theories used to explain variations of religiosity between societies{{Clarify|date=January 2017}}.  However, Gill and Lundsgaarde (2004) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = State Welfare Spending and Religiosity | journal = Comparative Political Studies | first = Anthony | last = Gill |author2=Erik Lundsgaarde  | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 399–436 | year = 2004| doi = 10.1177/1043463104046694 }}  [http://faculty.washington.edu/tgill/Gill%20Lundsgaarde%20Welfare%20Religion.pdf Free PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; documented a much stronger correlation between welfare state spending and religiosity.  See "Welfare spending vs Church attendance" diagram on the right.

===Just-world hypothesis===
Studies have found [[Just-world hypothesis|belief in a just world]] to be correlated with aspects of religiousness.&lt;ref&gt;Begue, L. (2002). Beliefs in justice and faith in people: just world, religiosity and interpersonal trust. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 32(3), 375-382.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurst, J., Bjorck, J., &amp; Tan, S. (2000). Causal attributions for uncontrollable negative events. ''Journal of Psychology and Christianity'', 19, 47–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk-aversion===
Several studies have discovered a positive correlation between the degree of religiousness and [[Risk aversion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Risk aversion and religion | journal = Journal of Risk and Uncertainty | first = Charles | last = Noussair |author2=Stefan T.

[[Theologians]] however have questioned the utility of an approach to religion by way of a so-called instinct;&lt;ref&gt;Louis Berkhof, ''Systematic Theology'' (1996) p. 111-2&lt;/ref&gt;[[psychologists]] have disputed the existence of any such specific [[instinct]];&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Pratt, ''The Religious Consciousness'' (2004) p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;  while others would point to the advance of [[secularization]] in the modern world as refuting the assumption of a specific religious instinct inevitably leading to the establishment of religion as a fundamental human institution.&lt;ref&gt;Peter L. Berger, ''A Rumour of Angels'' (1973) p. 13-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observations==
{{main|Paleolithic religion}}
There are no religious [[ritual]]s observed in animals, including our close relatives, chimpanzees and other apes, although chimps were observed to have sometimes collective excitements for no reason.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anth.uconn.edu/faculty/sosis/publications/Alcorta_Sosis,_Signals_and_rituals_of_humans_and_animals.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

Archaeologists have established the existence of [[Funeral|burial rituals]] among [[Neanderthal]]s some 50,000 years ago:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SDHsE_Efy0EC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=NEANderthal+religious+rituals&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tiAUESD11q&amp;sig=Wc-0NamAlVujLYC6fwaxW9ku6ZM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZFu4TMDmHMP38AaX8I3DDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| title=Prayer: A History| authors=Philip Zaleski, Carol Zaleski| publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt| year= 2006| isbn= 978-0-618-77360-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; their appearance has sometimes been taken as evidence of the human capacity to ''transform'' instinct, rather than to be driven by it.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (1993) p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freud and Jung==
[[Sigmund Freud]] saw human weakness and helplessness as a fundamental force behind the establishment of religion&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Civilization, Society and Religion'' (PFL 12) p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; - a view which might seem to draw support from the [[World Values Survey|Inglehart-Welzel]] thesis that links the insecurities of traditional economies to a search for spiritual certainty, the affluence of modernisation to a declining stress on religion.&lt;ref&gt;R. F. Foster, ''Luck of the Irish'' (2008) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Jung]] (1875–1961) theorized the existence of a [[collective unconscious]], as a residue of what has been learned in humankind's evolution and ancestral past, which contains the instinctual potential for [[creativity]] as well as the spiritual heritage of mankind,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/22596676/Jung-and-Religion-The-Opposing-Self| title=Jung and religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which unconsciously dictates our behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Locke |first=John |url=http://www.powells.com/biblio?isbn=9780892540495 |title=Jung's Thoughts on God: The Religious Depths of Our Psyches (Jung on the Hudson Book Series) by Donald Dyer - Powell's Books |publisher=Powells.com |date=2010-10-02 |accessdate=2010-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While he recognized in man a genetic predisposition to order experience in mythological, religious or symbolic terms,&lt;ref&gt;R. Gregory ed., ''The Oxford Companion to the Mind'' (1987) p. 405&lt;/ref&gt; Jung reserved judgement as to what bearing this had for the truth-value of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Jung, ''Man and his Symbols'' (1978) p. 75-82&lt;/ref&gt; 

He never ceased however to stress the important challenge all such factors presented to any shallowly rationalistic world-view.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, p.90-3 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Durkheim]] saw the social, not the instinctual side of mankind as the key to their religious experience.&lt;ref&gt;E. Durkheim, ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life'' (1971) p. 418&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1018">'''Resacralization''' is the return of [[religious]] meanings to public sectors of social life such as [[politics]], the [[arts]], and the [[human body|body]], and the resistance of [[secularization]]. This is consistent with Berger's (1967) definition of secularization as the removal of religious meanings from public life, or [[privatization]]. Another possible definition of resacralization would be the growing realization that the separation between public and private spheres is itself a cultural construction of modern [[society]].

{{Bertrand Russell}}

'''Russell's teapot''' is an [[analogy]], formulated by the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] (1872–1970), to illustrate that the [[philosophic burden of proof]] lies upon a person making [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] claims, rather than shifting the burden of ''disproof'' to others.  

Russell specifically applied his analogy in the context of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Allhoff, Scott C. Lowe. ''The Philosophical Case Against Literal Truth: Russell's Teapot // Christmas - Philosophy for Everyone: Better Than a Lump of Coal''. — John Wiley and Sons, 2010. — Т. 5. — P. 65-66. — 256 p. — (Philosophy for Everyone). — {{ISBN|9781444330908}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that if he were to assert, without offering proof, that a [[teapot]], too small to be seen by telescopes, orbits the Sun somewhere in space between the Earth and Mars, he could not expect anyone to believe him solely because his assertion could not be proven wrong. 

Russell's teapot is still invoked in discussions concerning the [[existence of God]], and has had influence in various fields and media.

== Description ==
In an article titled "Is There a God?" commissioned, but never published, by ''Illustrated'' magazine in 1952, Russell wrote:

{{quote|Many orthodox people speak as though it were the business of sceptics to disprove received dogmas rather than of dogmatists to prove them. This is, of course, a mistake. If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Is There a God? [1952]|editor-first=John G.|editor-last=Slater|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|authorlink=Bertrand Russell|title=The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell, Vol. 11: Last Philosophical Testament, 1943–68|year=1952|url=http://russell.mcmaster.ca/cpbr11p69.pdf|publisher=[[Routledge]]|pages=542–548|isbn=9780415094092}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In 1958, Russell elaborated on the analogy:

{{quote|I ought to call myself an agnostic; but, for all practical purposes, I am an atheist. I do not think the existence of the Christian God any more probable than the existence of the [[Ancient Greek religion|Gods of Olympus]] or [[Norse religion|Valhalla]]. To take another illustration: nobody can prove that there is not between the Earth and Mars a china teapot revolving in an elliptical orbit, but nobody thinks this sufficiently likely to be taken into account in practice. I think the Christian God just as unlikely.&lt;ref name="garvey"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Brian |last=Garvey |title=Absence of Evidence, Evidence of Absence, and the Atheist's Teapot |journal=[[Ars Disputandi]] |year=2010 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=9–22 |doi=10.1080/15665399.2010.10820011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

== Analysis ==
Chemist [[Peter Atkins]] said that the point of Russell's teapot is that there is no burden on anyone to disprove assertions. [[Occam's razor]] suggests that the simpler theory with fewer assertions (e.g., a universe with no supernatural beings) should be the starting point in the discussion rather than the more complex theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Science|editor=Clayton, Philip|editor2=Simpson, Zachary R.|first=Peter|last=Atkins|authorlink=Peter Atkins|contribution=Atheism and science|pages=129–130 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-WhGyYy0SIoC|accessdate=2016-03-03|isbn=9780199279272|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, philosopher [[Paul Chamberlain]] says it is logically erroneous to assert that positive truth claims bear a burden of proof while negative truth claims do not.&lt;ref name="chamberlain"&gt;{{cite book |first=Paul |last=Chamberlain|title=Why People Don't Believe: Confronting Six Challenges to Christian Faith|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2AdNgqzawLAC&amp;pg=PA82 |year=2011|publisher=Baker Books|isbn=978-1-4412-3209-0|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says that all truth claims bear a burden of proof, and that like [[Mother Goose]] and the [[tooth fairy]], the teapot bears the greater burden not because of its negativity, but because of its triviality, arguing that "When we substitute normal, serious characters such as Plato, Nero, Winston Churchill, or George Washington in place of these fictional characters, it becomes clear that anyone denying the existence of these figures has a burden of proof equal to, or in some cases greater than, the person claiming they do exist."&lt;ref name="chamberlain"/&gt;

In his books ''[[A Devil's Chaplain]]'' (2003) and ''[[The God Delusion]]'' (2006), geneticist [[Richard Dawkins]] used the teapot as an analogy of an argument against what he termed "agnostic conciliation", a policy of intellectual appeasement that allows for philosophical domains that concern exclusively religious matters.&lt;ref name="devchap"&gt;{{cite book | title = A Devil's Chaplain: Reflections on Hope, Lies, Science, and Love | authorlink = Richard Dawkins | first = Richard | last = Dawkins | publisher = [[Houghton Mifflin]] | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-618-33540-4 | title-link = A Devil's Chaplain | chapter = The Great Convergence | pages = 146-151 | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nBRYZtOuqZcC&amp;pg=PA146 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Science has no way of establishing the existence or non-existence of a god. Therefore, according to the agnostic conciliator, because it is a matter of individual taste, belief and disbelief in a supreme being are deserving of equal respect and attention. Dawkins presents the teapot as a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' of this position: if agnosticism demands giving equal respect to the belief and disbelief in a supreme being, then it must also give equal respect to belief in an orbiting teapot, since the existence of an orbiting teapot is just as plausible scientifically as the existence of a supreme being.&lt;ref name = "goddel"&gt;{{cite book | title = The God Delusion | first = Richard | last = Dawkins | authorlink = Richard Dawkins | publisher = [[Random House]] | year = 2016 | edition = 10th Anniversary | isbn = 9781784161934 | title-link = The God Delusion | chapter = The Poverty of Agnosticism | pages = 69-77 | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=emE7DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher Brian Garvey argues that the teapot analogy fails with regard to religion because, with the teapot, the believer and non-believer are simply disagreeing about one item in the universe and may hold in common all other beliefs about the universe, which is not true of an atheist and a theist.&lt;ref name="garvey"/&gt; Garvey argues that it is not a matter of the theist propounding existence of a thing and the atheist simply denying it – each is asserting an alternative explanation of why the cosmos exists and is the way it is: "the atheist is not just denying an existence that the theist affirms – the atheist is in addition committed to the view that the universe is not the way it is because of God. It is either the way it is because of something other than God, or there is no reason it is the way it is."&lt;ref name="garvey"/&gt;

Philosopher [[Peter van Inwagen]] argues that while Russell's teapot is a fine piece of rhetoric, its logical argument form is less than clear, and attempting to make it clear reveals that the Teapot Argument is very far from cogent.&lt;ref name = "Epistemology"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Right to Believe: Perspectives in Religious Epistemology | editor1-first = Dariusz | editor1-last = Łukasiewicz | editor2-first = Roger | editor2-last = Pouivet | first = Peter | last = van Inwagen | authorlink = Peter van Inwagen | chapter = Russell's China Teapot | pages = 11-26 | publisher = [[Ontos Verlag]] | location = Frankfurt | year = 2012 | isbn = 9783110320169 | url = https://books.google.com.au/books?id=bmyK32rqKf0C&amp;pg=PA11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another philosopher, [[Alvin Plantinga]] states that a falsehood lies at the heart of Russell's argument. Russell's argument assumes that there is no evidence against the teapot, but Plantinga disagrees:

{{quote|Clearly we have a great deal of evidence against teapotism. For example, as far as we know, the only way a teapot could have gotten into orbit around the sun would be if some country with sufficiently developed space-shot capabilities had shot this pot into orbit. No country with such capabilities is sufficiently frivolous to waste its resources by trying to send a teapot into orbit. Furthermore, if some country had done so, it would have been all over the news; we would certainly have heard about it. But we haven't. And so on. There is plenty of evidence against teapotism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Gutting|first = Gary|authorlink = Gary Gutting|date = February 9, 2014|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|url = http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/is-atheism-irrational/|title = Is Atheism Irrational?|accessdate = July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Philosopher [[Gary Gutting]] rejects Russell's teapot for similar reasons, arguing that Russell's argument accords theism far less support than it actually has. Gutting points out that numerous sensible, competent people appeal to personal experience and arguments in support of God's existence. Thus, to simply reject the existence of God, out of hand, seems unjustified, according to Gutting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/11/on-dawkinss-atheism-a-response|date = August 11, 2010|accessdate = November 27, 2018|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|title = On Dawkins's Atheism: A Response|first = Gary|last = Gutting|authorlink = Gary Gutting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The literary critic [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]], without believing in God, says that belief in God "is a good deal more reasonable than belief in a teapot" because God is a "grand and big idea" which "is not analogically disproved by reference to celestial teapots or vacuum cleaners, which lack the necessary bigness and grandeur" and "because God cannot be [[Reification (fallacy)|reified]], cannot be turned into a mere thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=James|last=Wood|authorlink=James Wood (critic)|title=The Celestial Teapot|journal=[[The New Republic]]|date=18 December 2006|issue=27|url=http://www.tnr.com/article/the-celestial-teapot|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One counter-argument, advanced by philosopher Eric Reitan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first = Eric |last=Reitan |title=Contributors |publisher=Religion Dispatches |url=http://www.religiondispatches.org/contributors/ericreitan/}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that belief in God is different from belief in a teapot because teapots are physical and therefore in principle verifiable, and that given what we know about the physical world we have no good reason to think that belief in Russell's teapot is justified and at least some reason to think it not.&lt;ref name=Reitan&gt;{{cite book | title = Is God a Delusion? |first = Eric |last=Reitan|publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | date = 2008 | media_type = | pages = 78–80 | isbn = 978-1-4051-8361-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similar analogies ==
Other thinkers have posited non-disprovable analogies, such as [[J. B. Bury]] in his 1913 book, ''History of Freedom of Thought'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some people speak as if we were not justified in rejecting a theological doctrine unless we can prove it false. But the burden of proof does not lie upon the rejecter.... If you were told that in a certain planet revolving around Sirius there is a race of donkeys who speak the English language and spend their time in discussing eugenics, you could not disprove the statement, but would it, on that account, have any claim to be believed? Some minds would be prepared to accept it, if it were reiterated often enough, through the potent force of suggestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= History of Freedom of Thought|edition= Illustrated Edition, published 2014 by [[Lulu Press, Inc.]]|isbn= 9781304988607 |last= Bury|first= John Bagnall|authorlink= J.

[[Astronomer]] [[Carl Sagan]] in his 1995 book ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'' offered a similar non-disprovable analogy called the Dragon in the Garage as an example of skeptical thinking. If Sagan claimed there was a dragon in his garage, you would wish to verify it for yourself but if Sagan's dragon was impossible to detect:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now, what's the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all? If there's no way to disprove my contention, no conceivable experiment that would count against it, what does it mean to say that my dragon exists?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sagan|first1=Carl|authorlink=Carl Sagan|title=The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark|date=1995|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=9780394535128|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ybvaAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=editions:r7NWYii6Wt0C|accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Influence in religious parodies ==
The concept of Russell's teapot has influenced more explicitly [[Parody religion|religion-parodying]] concepts such as the [[Invisible Pink Unicorn]]&lt;ref name = "goddel"/&gt; and the [[Flying Spaghetti Monster]].&lt;ref name="Wolf2006"&gt;{{cite news | title=The Church of the Non-Believers | first=Gary | last=Wolf | date=14 November 2006 | publisher=[[Wired News]] | url=https://www.wired.com/2006/11/atheism/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1960s musician and psychedelic poet [[Daevid Allen]] of the band [[Gong (band)|Gong]] employed the image of a flying teapot in his [[Gong (band)#Mythology|Planet Gong Universe]] and the ''[[Flying Teapot (album)|Flying Teapot]]'' album trilogy, and refers to Russell's teapot in his book ''Gong Dreaming 2: The Histories &amp; Mysteries of Gong from 1969-1975''.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

A '''sacred garden''' is a religiously-influenced [[garden]], often found on [[temple]] grounds.

==Overview==
Religion has been an important influence on garden design. Temple gardens were made in [[Mesopotamia]] and [[ancient Egypt]]. [[Sacred grove]]s were made in ancient India, Greece, Rome, China and Japan. [[Sacred tree]]s were important in [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic]] and Germanic Europe and still are important in India. 

Many groves or forests were sacred in [[ancient India]] and continue to be so in modern [[Hindu]] worship. [[Buddhism]] had a significant influence on garden design, with the [[Zen]] gardens of [[China]] and [[Japan]] as famous examples. In Christianity, particularly [[Catholicism]] and [[Anglicanism]], [[Mary garden]]s are common among churches and institutions.

The practise of creating sacred gardens is re-invigorated and adapted for modern times in the ''Ringing Cedars'' series of books by Russian author [[Vladimir Megre]].

The '''Scientific study of religion''' represents the systematic effort by scholars and researchers to investigate religious phenomena, as well as the sociology of church participation. 

The [[Society for the Scientific Study of Religion]] was founded in 1949 by scholars in religion and social science, and it publishes the ''[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]'', a quarterly which "offers perspectives on national and international issues such as brainwashing and cults, religious persecution, and [[right wing authoritarianism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/journal.asp?ref=0021-8294&amp;site=1 |title=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion - Wiley Online Library |publisher=Blackwellpublishing.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center for the Scientific Study of Religion (CSSR) at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] is a leading center for the sociology of religion, and particularly for the study of religious influences on human behavior and population outcomes. The CSSR went offline in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.prc.utexas.edu/cssr/about_the_center/about_the_center.htm | publisher=University of Texas at Austin | work=Center for the Scientific Study of Religion (CSSR) | title=About the Center | accessdate=September 7, 2015 | author=Roemer, Michael K.| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609010657/http://www.prc.utexas.edu/cssr/about_the_center/about_the_center.htm | archivedate=June 9, 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Does the CSSR still exist?

[[File:Shroud of Charlemagne manufactured in Constantinople 814.jpg|thumb|Portion of the death shroud of [[Charlemagne]]. It represents a [[quadriga]] and was manufactured in [[Constantinople]].]]
'''Shroud''' usually refers to an item, such as a cloth, that covers or protects some other object. The term is most often used in reference to ''[[burial]] sheets'', '''mound shroud''', '''grave clothes''', '''winding-cloths''' or '''winding-sheets''', such as the famous [[Shroud of Turin]] or ''[[Tachrichim]]'' (burial shrouds) that [[Jews]] are dressed in for burial. Traditionally, mound shrouds are made of white [[cotton]], [[wool]] or [[linen]], though any material can be used so long as it is made of [[natural fibre]]. Intermixture of two or more such fibres is forbidden,&lt;ref&gt;Alfred J. Kolatch, ''The Jewish Book of Why'' (New York: Jonathan David Publishers, 1981), pp. 52-53&lt;/ref&gt; a proscription that ultimately derives from the [[Torah]], ''viz.'', [[Deuteronomy|Deut.]] 22:11.

A traditional Orthodox Jewish shroud consists of a tunic; a hood; pants that are extra-long and sewn shut at the bottom, so that separate foot coverings are not required; and a belt, which is tied in a knot shaped like the Hebrew letter ''shin'', mnemonic of one of God's names, Shaddai.  Early shrouds incorporated a cloth, the ''sudarium'', that covered the face, as depicted in traditional artistic representations of the entombed Jesus or His friend, Lazarus ([[Gospel of John|John]] 11, ''q.v.'').  An especially pious man may next be enwrapped in either his [[kittel]] or his [[tallit]], one tassel of which is defaced to render the garment ritually unfit, symbolizing the fact that the decedent is free from the stringent requirements of the 613 ''mitzvot'' (commandments). The shrouded body is wrapped in a winding sheet, termed a ''sovev'' in Hebrew (a cognate of ''svivon'', the spinning [[Hanukkah]] toy that is familiar under its Yiddish name, ''[[dreidel]]''), before being placed either in a plain coffin of soft wood (where required by governing health codes) or directly in the earth.  [[Croesus]]-rich or dirt-poor, every Orthodox Jew is dressed to face the Almighty on the same terms.

The [[Early Christian Church]] also strongly encouraged the use of winding-sheets, except for monarchs and bishops. The rich were wrapped in cerecloths, which are fine fabrics soaked or painted in wax to hold the fabric close to the flesh. An account of the opening of the coffin of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] says that the "innermost covering seems to have been a very fine linen cerecloth, dressed close to every part of the body". Their use was general until at least the Renaissance – clothes were very expensive, and they had the advantage that a good set of clothes was not lost to the family.
In Europe in the Middle Ages, coarse linen shrouds were used to bury most poor without a coffin. In poetry shrouds have been described as of sable, and they were later embroidered in black, becoming more elaborate and cut like shirts or shifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Design for Death|last=Jones|first=Barbara|publisher=Andre Deutsch Limited|year=1967|isbn=|location=London|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;Françoise Piponnier and Perrine Mane; ''Dress in the Middle Ages''; p.112, Yale UP, 1997; {{ISBN|0-300-06906-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Orthodox Christians]] still use a burial shroud, usually decorated with a cross and the [[Trisagion]]. The special shroud that is used during the Orthodox [[Holy Week]] services is called an [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|Epitaphios]]. Some Catholics also use the burial shroud particularly the [[Eastern Catholics]] and traditionalist [[Roman Catholics]].

Muslims as well use burial shrouds that are made of white cotton or linen.  The [[Burying in Woollen Acts]] 1666-80 in England were meant to support the production of woollen cloth.

A '''stumbling block''' or '''scandal''' in the [[Bible]], or in politics (including history), is a [[metaphor]] for a behaviour or attitude that leads another to [[sin]] or to destructive behaviour. 

==Bible use==

===Hebrew Bible===
The origin of the metaphor is the prohibition of putting a stumbling block before the blind ({{bibleverse|Leviticus|19:14|}}). [[Geoffrey W. Bromiley]] calls the image "especially appropriate to a rocky land like [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |authorlink=Geoffrey W. Bromiley |encyclopedia=The international standard Bible encyclopedia |page=641 |year=1995 |quote=The concept of a stumbling block was especially appropriate to a rocky land like Palestine, where stones and pebbles are plentiful on all the unpaved roads (in contrast to countries with alluvial soil, like Egypt or Mesopotamia).}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Hebrew Bible]], the term for "stumbling block" is [[Biblical Hebrew]] {{transl|he|miḵšōl}} ({{lang|he|מִכְשׁוֹל|rtl=yes}}). In the [[Septuagint]], {{transl|he|miḵšōl}} is translated into [[Koine Greek]] {{transl|grc|skandalon}} ({{lang|grc|{{linktext|σκανδαλον}}}}), a word which occurs only in [[Hellenistic literature]], in the sense "snare for an enemy; cause of moral stumbling".&lt;ref name="oedetymology"&gt;OED "scandal", etymology.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Septuagint {{bibleverse|Psalms|140:9|}} a stumbling block means anything that leads to sin.&lt;ref name="Khatry"&gt;{{cite  dissertation |origyear=1991 |isbn=158112094X |first=Ramesh |last=Khatry |title=The Authenticity of the Parable of the Wheat and the Tares and Its Interpretation |date=July 15, 2000 |institution=[[Westminster College, Oxford]] in collaboration with [[Wycliffe Hall, Oxford|Wycliffe Hall]] |page=137 |quote=Thematically, the usage in Mt 13:41 resembles that of Jewish tradition where to skandalon merely means anything that leads to sin. For example, Mt 13:41b is very similar to LXX Ps 140:9. LXX Ps 140:9 – apo skandalōn tōn ergazomenōn tēn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Testament===
The New Testament usages of {{lang|el-Latn|skandalon}}, such as {{bibleverse|Matthew|13:41|}}, resemble Septuagint usage.&lt;ref name="Khatry"/&gt; It appears 15 times in the New Testament in 12 unique verses according to [[Strong's Concordance]].  These passages are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G4625|title=G4625 - skandalon - Strong's Greek Lexicon (KJV)|work=blueletterbible.org|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{bibleverse|Matthew|13:41|}}, {{bibleverse|Matthew|16:23|}} , {{bibleverse|Matthew|18:7|}}  (3 times), {{bibleverse|Luke|17:1|}} , {{bibleverse|Romans|9:33|}}, {{bibleverse|Romans|11:9|}}, {{bibleverse|Romans|14:13|}}, {{bibleverse|Romans|16:17|}}, {{bibleverse|1 Corinthians|1:23|}}, {{bibleverse|Galatians|5:11|}}, {{bibleverse|1 Peter|2:8|}}, {{bibleverse|1 John|2:10|}}, and {{bibleverse|Revelation|2:14|}}.

The noun  {{lang|el-Latn|skandalon}} has a derived [[verb]], {{lang|el-Latn|skandalizo}} (formed with the {{lang|el-Latn|-iz}} suffix as English "scandalize"), meaning literally "to trip somebody up" or, idiomatically, "to cause someone to sin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Gospel according to Matthew: an introduction and commentary |page=271 |first=R. T. |last=France |year=1985 |quote=(ii) On stumbling-blocks (18:6–9) These sayings are linked together by the words skandalizo ('cause to sin', w. 6,8,9) and skandalon ('temptation (to sin)' 3 times in v. 7), a 'stumbling-block', something which trips someone up.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This verb appears 29 times in 27 New Testament verses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?t=kjv&amp;strongs=g4624|title=G4624 - skandalizō - Strong's Greek Lexicon (KJV)|accessdate=27 May 2016|work=blueletterbible.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Leviticus warning is developed in [[rabbinical Judaism]] as ''[[lifnei iver]]'' "before the blind."

===Christianity===

====Catholicism====
"Scandal" is discussed by [[Thomas Aquinas]] in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Vander Heeren 1912, "Notion of scandal"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3043.htm#article|title=Scandal|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|year=1920|work=SUMMA THEOLOGICA|pages=Secunda Secundae Partis, Q. 43|language=English|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1992 ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', it is discussed under the fifth commandment ([[Thou shalt not kill]]) section "Respect for the Dignity of Persons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P80.HTM|title=Part three: Life in Christ / Section two: The Ten Commandments / Chapter two: You shall love your neighbor as yourself / Article 5: The fifth commandment / ii. Respect for the dignity of persons |year=1992|work=Catechism of the Catholic Church|publisher=[[Holy See]]|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Active scandal'' is performed by a person; ''passive scandal'' is the reaction of a person to active scandal ("scandal given" or in Latin {{lang|la|scandalum datum}}), or to acts which, because of the viewer's ignorance, weakness, or malice, are regarded as scandalous ("scandal received" or in Latin {{lang|la|scandalum acceptum}}).&lt;ref&gt;Vander Heeren 1912, "Divisions"&lt;/ref&gt; 

In order to qualify as scandalous, the behavior must, in itself, be evil or give the appearance of evil.&lt;ref name="cases1"&gt;Vander Heeren 1912, "Cases in which the sin of scandal occurs (1)"&lt;/ref&gt;   To do a good act or an [[indifferent act]], even knowing that it will inspire others to sin — as when a student studies diligently to do well, knowing it will cause [[envy]] — is not scandalous.&lt;ref name="cases1"/&gt;  Again, to ask someone to commit [[perjury]] is scandalous, but for a judge to require witnesses to give an oath even when he knows the witness is likely to commit perjury is not scandalous.&lt;ref name="cases1"/&gt; It does not require that the other person actually commit sin; to be scandalous, it suffices that the act is of a nature to lead someone to sin.&lt;ref name="cases1"/&gt; Scandal is performed with the intention of inducing someone to sin.&lt;ref name="cases1"/&gt;  Urging someone to commit a sin is therefore active scandal.&lt;ref name="cases1"/&gt;  In the case where the person urging the sin is aware of its nature and the person he is urging is ignorant, the sins committed are the fault of the person who urged them.&lt;ref name="cases1"/&gt; Scandal is also performed when someone performs an evil act, or an act that appears to be evil, knowing that it will lead others into sin.&lt;ref name="cases1"/&gt;  (In case of an apparently evil act, a sufficient reason for the act despite the faults it will cause negates the scandal.&lt;ref name="cases1"/&gt;) Scandal may also be incurred when an innocent act may be an [[occasion of sin]] to the weak, but such acts should not be foregone if the goods at stake are of importance.&lt;ref name="cases3"&gt;Vander Heeren 1912, "Cases in which the sin of scandal occurs (3)"&lt;/ref&gt;

====Protestantism====
The term "stumbling block" is common in Protestant writings. An early use was [[Martin Luther]]'s consideration that the common belief that the Mass was a sacrifice was a "stumbling block."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert C. |last=Croken |title=Luther's first front: the Eucharist as sacrifice |page=26 |year=1990 |quote=A second stumbling block (and it is significant that Luther considers it a "second" stumbling block) to the true doctrine of the Mass is the common belief that the Mass is a sacrifice. According to this belief, Christ is offered to God ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern "scandal"==
{{main|scandal}}
The  Greek word {{lang|el-Latn|skandalon}} was [[loanword|borrowed]] from Greek to Latin to French, and finally to English as "scandal".&lt;ref name="oedetymology"/&gt; The modern English meaning of ''[[scandal]]'' is a [[semantic drift|development]] from the religious meaning, via the intermediate sense of "damage to reputation".&lt;ref&gt;OED "scandal", senses 1–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the religious conception of surrender||Surrender (disambiguation)}}
To '''surrender''' in [[spirituality]] and [[religion]] means that a believer completely gives up his own will and subjects his thoughts, ideas, and deeds to the will and teachings of a [[higher power]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} It may also be contrasted with [[Submission]]. Surrender is willful acceptance and yielding to a dominating force and their will.

==In Christianity==
[[File:Christian Flag etc Covenant Presbyterian Long Beach 20050213.jpg|thumb|The [[Christian Flag]], displayed next to the [[pulpit]] on the [[chancel]] of a church sanctuary. Its white [[Flag terminology|field]] represents [[Jesus]]' surrender to God's will.]]
{{See also|Cupio dissolvi}}
In Christianity, the first main principle of surrender is "Dying to Self", or the "emptying of self" to allow Christ to live through the believer, illustrated in the following passages: 
{{Quote|If any [man] come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.|[[Gospel of Luke|Luk]] 14:26&lt;ref name="KJV"&gt;The [[Bible]], [[Authorized King James Version|King James Version]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|For to me to live [is] Christ, and to die [is] gain.|Phl 1:21&lt;ref name="KJV"/&gt;}}

{{Quote|For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.|[[Epistle to the Colossians|Col]] 3:3&lt;ref name="KJV"/&gt;}}

The second issue of surrender in Christianity is allowing Christ to "take our place" through the believer, in other words, the emptying of self so that God may live through the believer as evidenced in Phl 1:21.

Another principle central to the Christian concept of surrender is the concept of surrender to [[God's Will]]. Surrendering to God's will entails both the "surrender of our will to His in macrocosm", in which His plan prevails over man's and the adversary, and secondarily to the surrender of one's will for individual life to "His will for our personal lives in microcosm." This is done through the emptying or dying of self, the "putting self aside" in favor of divine influence. This includes the idea of surrendering to a call. The corollary of this personal surrender is obedience, and obedience to God is denoted as bringing about His will, having lasting effects, and often associated with earthly and divine blessings.

The supreme act of surrender which the believer is called to emulate is the surrender of Christ first as coming into the world as God incarnate and then the surrender to the Cross in the act of sacrificial atonement, breaking the curse of sin and death from the [[Fall of Man|Fall]].

{{Quote|But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.|Phl 2:7-8&lt;ref name="KJV"/&gt;}}

{{Quote|Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.|Luk 22:42&lt;ref name="KJV"/&gt;}}

Surrender is also noted in Christian doctrine as one of the three columns of victorious living, or Christian victory: the Blood of the Lamb [Christ], their Testimony of the Word of God [Scriptures] and their lives, and Loving not their lives to death.

The [[Christian Flag]], which represents all of [[Christendom]], has a white field, with a red [[Latin cross]] inside a blue canton. In conventional [[vexillology]], a [[white flag]] is linked to surrender, a reference to the Biblical description [[Jesus]]' non-violence and surrender to [[Will of God|God's will]].&lt;ref name="Prayer Foundation"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.prayerfoundation.org/christian_flag.htm|title =The Christian Flag|publisher = Prayer Foundation|quote=The flag's most conspicuous symbol is the Christian cross, the most universal symbol for Christianity.  The red color represents the blood of Christ and brings to mind his crucifixion.  Christians believe that Jesus Christ's death and resurrection is the means God uses to save believers from their sins. The cross and blood have been used since earliest Christianity to symbolize salvation through Jesus; in the words of the Apostle Paul, "And having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself;" -Colossians 1:20. The white field draws on symbolism throughout the Bible equating white clothes with purity and forgiveness.  People who have been "washed white as snow" in the Bible have been cleansed from their sins (Isaiah 1:18; Psalm 51:2).  In conventional vexillology (the study of flags, their history and symbolism), a white flag is linked to surrender, a reference to the Biblical description Jesus' non-violence and surrender to God's will. The symbolism behind the blue canton has been interpreted to represent Heaven, truth, or the Christian ritual of Baptism in water.|accessdate = 2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Hinduism==
According to the [[Bhagavad Gita]], [[Krishna]] said the following to the warrior [[Arjuna]], who became his disciple:

{{Quote|I consider the yogi-devotee—who lovingly contemplates on Me with supreme faith, and whose mind is ever absorbed in Me—to be the best of all the yogis.|Chapter 6, Verse 47}}
{{Quote|After attaining Me, the great souls do not incur rebirth in this miserable transitory world, because they have attained the highest perfection.|Chapter 8, Verse 15}}
{{Quote|... those who, renouncing all actions in Me, and regarding Me as the Supreme, worship Me... For those whose thoughts have entered into Me, I am soon the deliverer from the ocean of death and transmigration, Arjuna. Keep your mind on Me alone, your intellect on Me. Thus you shall dwell in Me hereafter.|Chapter 12, Verses 6-8}}
{{Quote|And he who serves Me with the yoga of unswerving devotion, transcending these qualities [binary opposites, like good and evil, pain and pleasure] is ready for liberation in [[Brahman]].|Chapter 14, Verse 26}}
{{Quote|Fix your mind on Me, be devoted to Me, offer service to Me, bow down to Me, and you shall certainly reach Me. I promise you because you are My very dear friend.|Chapter 18, Verse 65}}
{{Quote|Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vedabase.net/bg/18/66/en1 Bhagavad-Gita 18.66] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212101753/http://vedabase.net/bg/18/66/en1 |date=2007-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|Chapter 18, Verse 66}}

Several [[guru]]s teach their disciples the importance of surrender to God or to themselves, as part of the guru-disciple relationship. For example, the ''Sri Sai Satcharita'', the biography of [[Sai Baba of Shirdi]] says that surrender to the guru is the only ''[[sadhana]]''.

[[Prem Rawat]], formerly called Guru Maharaj Ji, was quoted in 1978 "But there is nothing to understand! And if there is something to understand, there is only one thing to understand, and that is to surrender!"&lt;ref&gt;[[Divine Light Mission|DLM]]. (1979). The essence of everything. In ''[[The Golden Age (DLM magazine)|The Golden Age]]'' ''51''. (See [[Wikiquote:Prem Rawat]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Islam==
The concept of  surrender is when a person abides by the five main [[Five Pillars of Islam|Pillars of Islam]].&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/295507/Islam |title=Islām |work= |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Online |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  following the faith means surrendering or submitting one's will to [[God in Islam|God]]. This means that Muslims in their daily life should strive for excellence under the banner of God's will.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/conversion/beginner_1.shtml Living Allah's way]. BBC-Religion and Ethics Retrieved on 22 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Every single action in a Muslim's life, whether marriage or building one's career, should theoretically be for the sake of God.

      <comment>The use of [sic] here is bizarre, and implies that the usage is incorrect when it is not.  Anyone who doesn't know the meanings of the verb "to bear" can look it up in a dictionary.  And why would it be marked with a [sic] in Mormon usage, but not in the reference to Quaker usage?</comment>

{{Evidence law}}
In [[law]] and in [[religion]], '''testimony''' is a solemn attestation as to the truth of a matter.

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary}}
The words "testimony" and "testify" both derive from the [[Latin]] word ''testis'', referring to the notion of a disinterested [[Third-party source|third-party]] witness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=testify|work=Online Etymology Dictionary |last=Harper |first=Douglas |title=testify |accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=testimony|work=Online Etymology Dictionary |last=Harper |first=Douglas |title=testimony |accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law==

In the [[law]], testimony is a form of [[evidence (law)|evidence]] that is obtained from a [[witness]] who makes a solemn statement or declaration of fact. Testimony may be oral or written, and it is usually made by [[oath]] or [[affirmation in law|affirmation]] under penalty of [[perjury]]. To be admissible in court and for maximum reliability and validity, written testimony is usually witnessed by one or more persons who swear or affirm its authenticity also under penalty of perjury. Unless a witness is testifying as an [[expert witness]], testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is generally limited to those opinions or inferences that are rationally based on the perceptions of the witness and are helpful to a clear understanding of the witness' testimony. 

Legitimate expert witnesses with a genuine understanding of legal process and the inherent dangers of false or misleading testimony refrain from making statements of fact. They also recognize that they are in fact not witnesses to an alleged crime or other event in any way, shape or form. Their expertise is in the examination of evidence or relevant facts in the case. They should make no firm judgement or claim or accusation about any aspect of the case outside their narrow range of expertise. They also should not allege any fact they can't immediately and credibly prove scientifically.
 
For example, a hair sample from a crime scene entered as evidence by the prosecution should be described by an expert witness as "consistent with" a sample collected from the defendant, rather than being described as a "match". A wide range of factors make it physically impossible to prove for certain that two hair or tissue samples came from a common source.

Having not actually witnessed the defendant at the scene, the expert witness can not state for a fact that the sample is a match to the defendant, particularly when the samples were collected at different times and different places by different collectors using different collection methods. Ultimately, the testimony of expert witnesses is regarded as supportive of evidence rather than evidence in and of itself, and a good defense attorney will point out that the expert witness is not in fact a witness to anything, but rather an observer.

When a witness is asked a question, the opposing attorney can raise an [[Objection (law)|objection]], which is a legal move to disallow or prevent an improper question to others, preferably before the witness answers, and mentioning one of the standard reasons, including:
* argumentative
* asked and answered
* [[best evidence rule]]
* calls for speculation
* calls for a conclusion
* [[compound question]] or narrative
* [[hearsay]]
* inflammatory
* incompetent witness (e.g., child, mental or physical impairment, intoxicated)
* irrelevant, immaterial (the words "irrelevant" and "immaterial" have the same meaning under the Federal Rules of Evidence. Historically, irrelevant evidence referred to evidence that has no probative value, i.e., does not tend to prove any fact. Immaterial refers to evidence that is probative, but not as to any fact material to the case. See Black's Law Dictionary, 7th Ed.).
* lack of foundation
* [[leading question]]
* [[privilege (evidence)|privilege]]
* vague
* [[ultimate issue (law)|ultimate issue testimony]]
There may also be an objection to the answer, including:
* non-responsive

Up until the mid-20th century, in much of the [[United States]], an attorney often had to follow an objection with an '''exception''' to preserve the issue for appeal. If an attorney failed to "take an exception" immediately after the court's ruling on the objection, he waived his client's right to appeal the issue. Exceptions have since been abolished, due to the widespread recognition that forcing lawyers to take them was a waste of time.

When a party uses the testimony of a witness to show proof, the opposing party often attempts to [[Witness impeachment|impeach]] the witness. This may be done using [[cross-examination]], calling into question the witness's [[Competence (law)|competence]], or by attacking the [[Character evidence|character]] or [[Habit evidence|habit]] of the witness. So, for example, if a witness testifies that he remembers seeing a person at 2:00 pm on a Tuesday and his habit is to be at his desk job on Tuesday, then the opposing party would try to impeach his testimony related to that event.

==Religion==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Fasting]] --&gt;
[[Christians]] in general, especially within the [[Evangelical]] tradition, use the term "to testify" or "to give one's testimony" to mean "to tell the story of how one became a Christian". Commonly it may refer to a specific event in a Christian's life in which they believe God did something deemed particularly worth sharing. Christians often give their testimony at their own [[baptism]] or at [[evangelistic]] events. Many Christians have also published their testimonies on the internet.

===Types===
Many [[Holiness movement|holiness]] churches devote a portion of their mid-week service to allow members to give a personal testimony about their faith and experiences in living the Christian life.

In the [[Religious Society of Friends]], the word ''testimony'' is used to refer to the ways in which [[Religious Society of Friends|Friends]] ''testify'' or ''bear witness'' to their beliefs in their everyday lives. In this context, the word ''testimony'' refers not to the underlying belief, but the committed action which arises out of their beliefs, which ''testifies'' to their beliefs. Common areas which modern [[Religious Society of Friends|Friends]] are said to testify are [[peace testimony|testimony towards peace]], [[testimony of simplicity|testimony to simplicity]], [[testimony of integrity|testimony to truth and integrity]], [[testimony of equality|testimony to equality]].

In some [[religion]]s (most notably [[Mormonism]] and [[Islam]]) many adherents testify as a profession of their [[faith]], often to a congregation of believers. In [[Mormonism]], testifying is also referred to as "bearing one's testimony," and often involves the sharing of personal experience—ranging from a simple anecdote to an account of [[Revelation (Latter Day Saints)#Personal revelation|personal revelation]]—followed by a statement of belief that has been confirmed by this experience. Within [[Mormon]] [[Culture of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|culture]], the word "testimony"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url= http://lds.org/study/topics/testimony?lang=eng |contribution= Testimony |title= Gospel Study: Study by Topic |work= LDS.org |publisher= [[LDS Church]] |date= |accessdate= 2011-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; has become synonymous with "belief." Although testimony and belief are often used interchangeably, they are inherently different. Most Mormons believe that when faith is acted upon, individuals can receive a spiritual witness which solidifies belief into testimony. Mormons are taught that if the exercise of faith brings forth good works, they can know their religious principles are true. An individual who no longer believes in the religion is referred to as having "lost their testimony."

==Literature==
[[File:Bataan Death March Testimonies.jpg|thumb|[[Bataan Death March|Bataan Death March Testimonies]]]]
Some published [[oral history|oral]] or written [[autobiography|autobiographical]] [[narrative]]s are considered "testimonial [[literature]]" particularly when they present [[evidence (law)|evidence]] or [[first-person narrative|first person]] accounts of [[human rights]] abuses, [[violence]] and [[war]], and living under conditions of social [[oppression]]. This usage of the term comes originally from [[Latin America]] and the Spanish term ''"testimonio"'' when it emerged from human rights [[tribunal]]s,  [[truth commissions]], and other [[international human rights instruments]] in countries such as [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]]. One of the most famous, though controversial, of these works to be translated into English is ''[[I, Rigoberta Menchú]]''. The autobiographies of [[Frederick Douglass]] can be considered among the earliest significant English-language works in this [[genre]].

==Philosophy==
In [[philosophy]], a testimony is known as statements that are based on personal experience or personal knowledge. A statement is accepted on the basis of person's testimony if his or her asserting it renders it acceptable. We can also, rationally accept a claim on the basis of another person's testimony unless at least one of the following is found to be true:
# The claim is implausible;
# The person or the source in which the [[Cause of action|claim]] is quoted lacks [[credibility]];
# The claim goes beyond what the person could know from his or her own [[experience]] and competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A practical study of Argument|edition=6th|author=[[Trudy Govier]]|origyear=1985|year=2005|isbn=9780534605254}} For the notion of testimony in general, and especially after David Hume, see the seminal research by C. A. J. Coady, Testimony: A Philosophical Study, Oxford 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[New Testament]] contain many passages outlining approaches to, and descriptions of, [[Violence|violent]] activities, centering on the [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|ancient nation of Israel]] and their involvement with [[Gentile]] nations. They also provide civil guidelines on the subject of violent activity as it pertains to individuals within the nation, distinguishing individualistic from [[Nationalism|nationalistic]] actions.

These texts contain [[narrative]]s, [[poetry]], and instruction describing, commanding, or condemning violent actions by God, individuals, groups, and governments.  These actions include war, human and animal sacrifice, murder, rape, stoning, sexism, slavery, criminal punishment, and violent language.&lt;ref name=CreachResources&gt;{{cite book | last = Creach | first = "Jerome F.

Within the [[Pentateuch]] the terms ''gazal'' (rob) and ''asaq'' (oppress) are frequently used in combination to describe the human violence of taking/robbing/plundering as [[oppression]] of the poor which may or may not include physical, verbal or other types of harm.  They are also used both separately and in combination throughout the remainder of the Hebrew Bible describing robbing the poor (Isaiah 3:14, 10:2; Jeremiah 22:3; Micah 2:2, 3:2; Malachi 1:3), withholding the wages of a hired person (cf. Deuteronomy 24:14), political oppression (Hosea 12:7), charging oppressive interest (Ezekiel 22:12), and oppressing the outsider in their midst (Ezekiel 22:7) as acts of violence.&lt;ref name="David J.A.

Over half the occurrences of the verb and noun for the root ''ḥ-r-m'' are concerned with the destruction of nations in war, but other terms associated with what Old Testament scholar Eric Siebert describes as "divine violence" may or may not include war. Siebert says divine violence is "violence God is said to have perpetrated, caused, or sanctioned." Specifically, this includes (1) violence God commits without using human agents (e.g., sending down fire on Sodom and Gomorrah); (2) violence God commissions, typically unbeknownst to those being commissioned (e.g., using Babylon to punish Judah for their sins); and (3) violence God commands directly (e.g., ordering [[Israelites]] to wipe out [[Canaanites]])."&lt;ref name="Eric Siebert"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seibert|first1=Eric A.|title=Recent Research on Divine Violence in the Old Testament (with Special Attention to Christian Theological Perspectives)|journal=Currents in Biblical Research|date=21 October 2016|volume=15|issue=1|pages=8–40|doi=10.1177/1476993X15600588}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, concerning those who worship idols, Deuteronomy 7:16 uses ''akal'' ("consume") when saying "You must ''destroy'' (consume) all the peoples the Lord your God gives over to you…".  Deuteronomy 7:24, on the other hand, uses ''abad'' when saying "you shall make their name ''perish'' from under heaven…" while Deuteronomy 20:10-18 says  "…you shall not leave alive anything that breathes.  But you shall utterly destroy (''ha-harem taharimem'') them, the Hittite and the Amorite, the Canaanite and the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite, as the Lord your God has commanded you…".  "Amos 1:3–2:3 uses akal to indict Israel’s neighbors for various acts of cruelty during war (e.g., the Ammonites “ripped open pregnant women in Gilead in order to enlarge their territory”; 1:13) and uses those [[war crime]]s of surrounding peoples to draw a parallel with Israel’s mistreatment of the poor, thus elevating economic injustice to the level of war crimes." (2:6–8).&lt;ref name=CreachResources/&gt;{{rp|44}}

Other terms are: ''ṣamat'' (put an end to, exterminate...annihilate); ''shamad'' (destroy, exterminate); ''nakah'' (to strike fatally, kill, in manslaughter, murder...as retaliation ...in warfare, conquest...combat...attack, rout); ''aqar'' (pluck up, often in the violent sense); ''qatsah'' (to cut off, in a destructive sense); ''shabat'' (with zeker can refer to one's "memory" being "blotted out" but in another idiom it means to "be blotted out...from...[the] earth" to "be exterminated, be destroyed, perish"; and ''kalah'' (kalah in Qal can mean "be finished, be destroyed).&lt;ref name="David J.A.

[[Moses]], a Hebrew [[Finding of Moses|raised by]] [[Bithiah|Pharaoh's daughter]], one day encounters an Egyptian beating a Hebrew. He slays the Egyptian and flees Egypt. God hears the plight of the Israelites and sends Moses back to Egypt to bring them out of that land to [[Canaan]]. At one point during the journey back, God intends to kill Moses, but he is [[Zipporah at the inn|saved by his wife Zipporah]] (Exodus 2-4).&lt;ref name=Segal&gt;{{cite book|last=Segal|first=Joseph M.|title=Joseph's Bones:Understanding the Struggle Between God and Mankind in the Bible| year=2007| publisher=Riverhead Books: The Penguin Group| location=New York|page=437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moses asks Pharaoh to release the Israelites, but Pharaoh responds by [[Bricks without straw|demanding more work]] from them. Moses repeats his request several times as the [[Plagues of Egypt]] afflict the Egyptians, but God makes Pharaoh refuse until the tenth plague, when God kills all firstborn people and cattle in Egypt, apart from those of the Israelites, who are [[Plagues_of_Egypt#10._Death_of_firstborn_.28.D7.9E.D6.B7.D7.9B.D6.B7.D6.BC.D7.AA_.D7.91.D6.B0.D6.BC.D7.9B.D7.95.D6.B9.D7.A8.D7.95.D6.B9.D7.AA.29:_Ex._11:1.E2.80.9312:36|protected]].

At [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]], God gives the Israelites the [[Ten Commandments]] and the [[Covenant Code]] (Exodus 20-23). These laws include [[thou shalt not kill]], [[eye for an eye]] and laws about [[The Bible and slavery|slavery]] and other things. [[List of capital crimes in the Torah|Capital punishment]] is prescribed for some crimes. [[Animal sacrifice]] in the form of [[Burnt offering (Judaism)|burnt offering]]s is mentioned, and it is prescribed that an ox that kills a person is to be stoned. The Code states that "And a stranger shalt thou not wrong, neither shalt thou oppress him; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt." and "Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child." The Israelites promise to follow these laws (Exodus 24:3).&lt;ref name="Christopher B.

The Israelites break their promise by worshiping the [[Golden Calf]]. God is angered by this and intends to "consume them", but Moses persuades him not to do so. Moses is also angered, and he breaks two stone tablets with God's writing. On Moses' command, the [[Levites]] kill about three thousand people (Exodus 32).&lt;ref name="Karla R.

God has Moses make new stone tablets, and gives Moses the [[Ritual Decalogue]], which states in part "Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest they be for a snare in the midst of thee. But ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and ye shall cut down their [[Asherah pole|Asherim]]" (Exodus 34).&lt;ref name="William J.

The [[Book of Leviticus]] sets out detailed rules for animal sacrifice. The [[Holiness code]], Leviticus 17-26, sets out a list of prohibitions, and the punishments for breaking them. Punishments include execution, sometimes by [[Stoning#Judaism|stoning]] or [[Death by burning|burning]].&lt;ref name="Jan Joosten"&gt;{{cite book| last=Joosten| first=Jan|title=People and Land in the Holiness Code: An Exegetical Study of the Ideational Framework of the Law in Leviticus 17-26 |year=1996| publisher=E.J.Brill| location=New York| isbn=90-04-10557-3| pages=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Book of Deuteronomy====
[[Deuteronomy]] begins with a review of previous stories, including a battle between the Israelites and the Amorites (Deuteronomy 1:41-44), and the destruction of [[Rephaim]] by the Ammonites with Yahweh's help (2:21), along with similar other displacements.&lt;ref name="Peter C.

Similar treatment, at Yahweh's command, was given to the people under Og king of Bashan.&lt;ref name="Peter C.

Similar threats of destruction for disobedience, or idolatry more specifically, can be found in Deuteronomy 6, 8, 11. On the other hand, God promises that if his people obey him he will give them victory in fighting their enemies in Deuteronomy 6, 11.&lt;ref name="Peter C. Craigie"/&gt;{{rp|327}}

Deuteronomy 13 insists that those who advocate the worship of other deities must be killed, and that a town that worships other deities must be entirely exterminated, including its livestock. Deuteronomy 14 forbids self-mutilation. Deuteronomy 17 punishes anyone who worships any deity or feature of the natural world with stoning to death, and likewise imposes the death penalty on anyone who disobeys the judicial decision of a priest.&lt;ref name="Bernard M.

Deuteronomy 19 imposes the death penalty for premeditated murder, establishes cities of refuge, and also imposes the ''lex talionis'': "life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot" limiting vengeance (verse 21, NRSV).&lt;ref name="Gary Harlan Hall"/&gt;{{rp|297–299}} Deuteronomy 20 regulates warfare, allowing for various exemptions from military service, and mandating that a city which Israel fights (outside of Canaan) should have all of its males slaughtered, with women taken as spoils of war.

It also mandates the stoning to death of rebellious children. Deuteronomy 22 orders the killing of women who cannot prove that they were virgins on their wedding night, and of both the man and woman when a man sleeps with another man's wife. It also mandates the death penalty for a man who has sexual relations with a betrothed virgin, and of the virgin if she does not cry out for help when raped.&lt;ref name="Gary Harlan Hall"/&gt;{{rp|312–344}}

Deuteronomy 24 imposes the death penalty for the kidnapping of a fellow Israelite, and forbids putting parents to death for crimes committed by their children, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Gary Harlan Hall"/&gt;{{rp|367–370}} Deuteronomy 25 allows for judges to have people punished in legal disputes by flogging, but limits the number of strikes to forty.

Deuteronomy 28 contains blessing and curses: blessing, including the defeat of Israel's enemies, if Israel obeys; and curses if Israel disobeys. These curses include disease, famine, defeat and death in warfare, insanity, abuse and robbery, enslavement, and cannibalism due to extreme hunger.

Joshua finishes most of the conquest of Canaan, with the exception of Gibeon and possibly some Canaanites and Amelakites: "For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, to come against Israel in battle, that they might be utterly destroyed, that they might have no favour, but that they might be destroyed, as the LORD commanded Moses."

[[David]], anointed king in secret (1 Samuel 16), comes into Saul's service and "loved him greatly".&lt;ref name="Diana Vikander Edelman"/&gt;{{rp|117-125}} The Philistines attack Israel, David slays their champion [[Goliath]], and they flee. David becomes popular, witch makes Saul fear him and plot his death. David and Saul's daughter [[Michal]] wish to marry, and Saul asks for a dowry of one hundred foreskins of the Philistines. David delivers two hundred, and becomes the king's son-in-law (1 Samuel 18). Saul again wishes David dead, but they are reconciled by Saul's son [[David and Jonathan|Jonathan]].

War comes again, David is victorious. Saul again wants to kill David, and he flees with help from his wife. Saul searches for him and slays the inhabitants of the city [[Nob, Israel|Nob]] for aiding David (1 Samuel 22). David defeats the Philistines at [[Keilah]], then flees the city pursued by Saul (1 Samuel 22). David and Saul reconcile. David seeks refuge with [[Achish]], king of [[Gath (city)|Gath]], and claims he is raiding Judah but is actually raiding and killing in other places (1 Samuel 27). The Philistines begins a war against Saul. David's wives [[Ahinoam]] and [[Abigail]] are taken in a raid on [[Ziklag]], but he rescue them (1 Samuel 30). The men of Israel flee before the Philistines, and three of Saul's sons are slain. Saul asks his armour-bearer to kill him, but is refused, so he takes his own life. The armour-bearer also takes his own life. Saul's body is beheaded and fastened to a city-wall by the victorious Philistines, but it is retaken by inhabitants of [[Jabesh-Gilead]] (1 Samuel 30).

A man tells David of Saul's death and that he himself killed Saul. David has him killed (2 Samuel 1). A long war starts between David and Saul's son [[Ish-bosheth]] (2 Samuel 3). David demands and is granted the return of his first wife Michal, despite the public grief of her new husband [[Palti, son of Laish|Palti]]. Two men assassinate Ish-bosheth, and David has them killed (2 Samuel 4). David wars victoriously with the Philistines. While transporting the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem, a man called [[Uzzah]] carelessly touches it and is killed by God (2 Samuel 6).

David defeats and plunder several enemies, and "executed justice and righteousness unto all his people." (2 Samuel 8). [[Ammon#Biblical narrative|The children of Ammon]] mistreat David's emissaries, and is defeated by his army (2 Samuel 10).

In order to make [[Bathsheba]] his wife, David successfully plots the death of [[Uriah the Hittite|her husband]]. This displeases God, and David is told that "the sword shall never depart from thy house." God kills David's and Bathsheba's child, that was conceived during her previous marriage. She then gives birth to [[Solomon]].  David conquers and plunders the city [[Rabbah]] (2 Samuel 11-12).

David's son [[Amnon]] rapes his half-sister [[Tamar (daughter of David)|Tamar]]. [[Absalom]], her full brother, in return has him killed (2 Samuel 13). Absalom conspires and revolts against David. Absalom is finally defeated and dies in the [[Battle of the Wood of Ephraim]], and David mourns him (2 Samuel 15-19). [[Sheba son of Bichri]] revolts, but is ultimately beheaded (2 Samuel 20).

In 2 Samuel 21, David has seven of Sauls sons and grandsons killed, including "the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul", though he spares Sauls grandson [[Mephibosheth]]. More wars take place. 2 Samuel 23 names and praises several of [[David's Mighty Warriors|David's warriors]].

===Apocalypse===
{{Main|Apocalypticism}}

The [[Book of Revelation]] is full of imagery of war, genocide, and destruction. It describes the [[Apocalypse]], the [[Last Judgment#Christianity|last judgment]] of all the nations and people by God, which includes plagues, war, and economic collapse. Some other books of the Gospels also use apocalyptic language and forms.  Scholars define this as language that "views the future as a time when divine saving and judging activity will deliver God's people out of the present evil order into a new order...This transformation will be cataclysmic and cosmic."&lt;ref name="James Bailey"/&gt;

Whenever Jesus calls people to a new vision in light of God's impending kingdom, judgment, or a future resurrection, he is using apocalyptic speech.&lt;ref name="James Bailey"&gt;{{cite book|author1-last=Bailey| author1-first=James L.|author2-last="Vander Broek"| author2-first=Lyle D.| title=Literary Forms in the New Testament: A Handbook| year =1992|publisher=Westminster/John Knox Press| location=Louiseville, Kentucky|isbn=0-664-25154-4|page=122,123}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Jesus uses apocalyptic speech in Matthew 10:15 when he says "it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town,"  and in Mark 14:62, where he alludes to the book of Daniel with himself in the future "sitting at the right hand of God." Bailey and Vander Broek go on to say, "In the material about John the Baptizer there also appear apocalyptic images: 'the wrath to come' (Luke 3:7); 'the axe ... lying at the root of the tree' (Luke 3:9);  the Coming One with 'winnowing fork ... in His hand' (Luke 3:17); and chaff burning with 'unquenchable fire' (Luke 3:17)."&lt;ref name="James Bailey"/&gt;{{rp|124}}

Charles B. Strozier, psychoanalyst historian says: "The most troubling dimension of 'endism' is its relation to violence. ... fundamentalists generally believe... transformation can only be accomplished violently, and that the move from our time into the next requires mass death and destruction when '...this earth will be purged in the fires of God's anger, that Jesus will return, and that a new heaven and a new earth will be reborn'".&lt;ref name="Charles B.

==Theological reflections and responses==
Texts of violence have produced a wide variety of theological responses.

===Various views===
As part of the many reflections on [[religious violence]] inspired by the [[Abrahamic religions]] that followed [[9/11]], [[John J. Collins]] wrote a short book called "Does the Bible Justify Violence?".&lt;ref name=McCormick&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCormick|first1=Patrick|title=Turn the other page|work=U.S. Catholic;|issue=70(11)|date=Nov 2005|pages=34ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=John J.|title=Does the Bible Justify Violence?|date=2004|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=9781451411287}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1–3}}  In the book he reviews the passages in the Bible describing violence done by God, commanded or promised by God, and done by people, as well as how these texts have been used by religious people and governments throughout history.&lt;ref name=McCormick/&gt;  For example, he discusses [[The Exodus]] and the conquest of the Canaanites in the subsequent [[Book of Joshua]], as two sides of the same coin; the Exodus story has inspired hope for millennia as well as civil rights movements; at the same time people identifying with the liberated Israel supported by God have cited the conquest to justify actions ranging from [[genocide of indigenous peoples]] to [[Apartheid]].&lt;ref name=Collins/&gt;{{rp|19–20}}  Collins concludes that the Bible speaks in many voices and answers his question as follows: "....historically people have appealed to the Bible precisely because of its presumed divine authority, which gives an aura of certitude to any position it can be shown to support -- in the phrase of Hannah Arendt, 'God-like certainty that stops all discussion.'  And here, I would suggest, is the most basic connection between the Bible and violence, more basic than any command or teaching it contains....The Bible has contributed to violence in the world precisely because it has been taken to confer a degree of certitude that transcends human discussion and argumentation."&lt;ref name=Collins/&gt;{{rp|32–33}}  Collins, writing as a Christian scholar, also notes:  "It is not unusual for Christian interpreters to claim that 'the Biblical witness to the innocent victims and the God of victims demystifies and demythologizes this sacred social order' in which violence is grounded.  Such a selective reading, privileging the death of Jesus or the suffering servant, is certainly possible and even commendable, but it does not negate the force of the biblical endorsements of violence that we have been considering. The full canonical shape of the Christian Bible, for what it is worth, still concludes with the judgement scene in Revelation, in which the Lamb that was slain returns as the heavenly warrior with a sword for striking down the nations."&lt;ref name=Collins/&gt;{{rp|27}}

[[Regina Schwartz]] is among those who seek to reimagine Christianity and the Christian biblical canon in ways that reduce violence which she describes as arising from the ancient Israelite invention of monotheism and some of the ways that the ancient Israelites conceived of themselves in relation to that one god and to other peoples, which Christians inherited. She wrote:  "The Other against whom Israel's identity is forged is abhorred, abject, impure, and in the "Old Testament," vast numbers of them are obliterated, while in the "New Testament," vast numbers are colonized (converted).  The tying of identity to rejection runs counter to much of the drive that could be found elsewhere, both in the Bible and throughout religious myth and ritual, to forge identity through analogy, even identification....Among all the rich variety, I would categorize two broad understandings of identity in the Bible: one grounded in Negation (or scarcity) and the other in Multiplicity (or plenitude).&lt;ref name="Regina Schwartz"&gt;{{cite book | last =Schwartz | first =Regina | title = The Curse of Cain: The Violent Legacy of Monotheism | publisher = the University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago, Ill | year = 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18–19}} Near the end of her book, she wrote:  "My re-vision would produce an alternative Bible that subverts the dominant vision of violence and scarcity with an ideal of plenitude and its corollary ethical imperative of generosity. It would be a Bible embracing multiplicity instead of monotheism."&lt;ref name="Regina Schwartz"/&gt;{{rp|176}}

Stephen Geller notes that both the Deuteronomist and the Priestly authors working in the [[Axial Age]] were re-evaluating and reformulating their traditions, like their neighbors were, using the literary means available to them. The Deuteronomists expressed their new notions of the transcendence and power of God by means of ideas and associated laws around unity—the one-ness of God, worshipped at the one temple in Jerusalem, by one people, kept distinct from the rest of world just as God is; zealously and violently so.&lt;ref name=geller&gt;{{cite book|last1=Geller|first1=Stephen A.|title=Sacred enigmas : literary religion in the Hebrew Bible|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=0415127718|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32-22}}  Likewise the Priestly author adapted the myths and rituals of the ANE and the specific traditions of the ancient Israelites to forge different meanings for blood sacrifice than their neighbors had, specifically in the elaborate and precarious rituals on the [[Day of Atonement]] when the High Priest had to enter the Holy of Holies and the presence of God; in their work the Priestly authors also attempted to express the transcendence and unity of God who is yet in a relationship with humanity with all its variable sinfulness.  In Geller's reading the blood is not magical nor is the animal just a substitute for a human sacrifice; instead blood is at once an expression of the violence of the fallen world where people kill in order to eat (unlike Eden) and the blood itself becomes a means for redemption; it is forbidden to be eaten, as a sign of restraint and recognition, and is instead offered to God, and in that action the relationship between fallen humanity and God is restored. The Priestly authors underline the importance of all this by recalling the mortal danger faced by the High Priests, through the telling of the deaths of [[Nadab and Abihu]] when God refused their "strange offering" and consumed them with fire.&lt;ref name=geller/&gt;{{rp|32-22}} One result of this reformulating work, is a God with aspects of terrifying and powerful otherness; as Annie Dillard wrote in [[Pilgrim at Tinker Creek]]: "Does anyone have the foggiest idea what sort of power we so blithely invoke? Or, as I suspect, does no one believe a word of it? The churches are children playing on the floor with their chemistry sets, mixing up a batch of TNT to kill a Sunday morning. It is madness to wear ladies’ straw hats and velvet hats to church; we should all be wearing crash helmets. Ushers should issue life preservers and signal flares; they should lash us to our pews. For the sleeping god may wake someday and take offense, or the waking god may draw us out to where we can never return."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dillard|first1=Annie|title=Pilgrim at Tinker Creek|date=1999|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|isbn=9780072434170|edition=1st Perennial classics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evan Fales, Professor of Philosophy, calls the doctrine of [[substitutionary atonement]] that some Christians use to understand the crucifixion of Jesus, "psychologically pernicious" and "morally indefensible".  Fales founds his argument on [[John Locke]]’s statement that revelation must conform to our understanding. Philosopher and Professor [[Alvin Plantinga]] says this rests upon seeing God as a kind of specially talented human being.&lt;ref name="Evan Fales"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fales | first = Evan |editor1-last =Bergman |editor1-first = Michael | editor2-last= Murray | editor2-first= Michael J. | editor3-last=Rea | editor3-first=Michael C. | title = Divine evil?

Historian [[Philip Jenkins]] (quoting Phyllis Trible) says the Bible is filled with "texts of terror" but he also asserts these texts are not to be taken literally. Jenkins says eighth century BCE historians added them to embellish their ancestral history and get readers' attention.&lt;ref name="Philip Jenkins"&gt;{{cite book| last = Jenkins | first = Philip | title = Laying Down the Sword; Why We Can't Ignore The Bible's Violent Verses | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 2011 | page =8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Old Testament scholar [[Ellen F. Davis|Ellen Davis]] is concerned by what she calls a "shallow reading" of Scripture, particularly of 'Old Testament' texts concerning violence, which she defines as a "reading of what we think we already know instead of an attempt to dig deeper for new insights and revelations."  She says these difficult texts typically have internal correctives that support an educative reading.&lt;ref name="Ellen Davis"&gt;{{cite book | last = Davis | first =  Ellen F. | title = Wondrous Depth: Preaching the Old Testament| publisher = Westminster John Knox Press | location = Louisville, Kentucky | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CreachOxford/&gt;{{rp|8–9}}

===The problem of evil===
Discussions of bible and violence often lead to discussions of the [[theodicy]] - the question of how evil can persist in the world if God is all-powerful, all-knowing, and good.&lt;ref name=LevonsonCreation/&gt;{{rp|xv-xvi}}

Philosopher [[Eleonore Stump]] says the larger context of God permitting suffering for good purposes in a world where evil is real allows for such events as the killing of those intending evil and God to still be seen as good.&lt;ref name="Eleonore Stump"&gt;{{cite book | last = Stump| first = Eleonore |editor1-last =Bergman |editor1-first = Michael | editor2-last= Murray | editor2-first= Michael J. | editor3-last=Rea | editor3-first=Michael C. | title = Divine evil?

Jon Levenson resolves the problem of evil by describing God's power not as static, but as unfolding in time: "the operative dichotomy, thus, is not that between limitation and omnipotence, but that which lies between omnipotence as a static attribute and omnipotence as a dramatic enactment: the absolute power of God realizing itself achievement and relationship. What the biblical theology of dramatic omnipotence shares with the theology of a limited God is a frank recognition of God's setbacks, in contrast to the classic theodicies with their exaggerated commitment to divine impassibility and their tendency to describe imperfection solely to human free will, the recalcitrance of matter, or the like."&lt;ref name=LevonsonCreation/&gt;{{rp|xvi}}

===Genesis and violence at creation===
[[File:Babylonian religion and mythology (1899) (14595850218).jpg|thumb|The god [[Marduk]] (right) fighting [[Tiamat]]]]
In 1895 [[Hermann Gunkel]] observed that most Ancient Near Eastern (ANE) creation stories contain a [[theogony]] depicting a god doing combat with other gods thus including violence in the founding of their cultures.&lt;ref name="Herman Gunkel 2006"&gt;{{cite book | author1-last= Gunkel | author1-first=Hermann | author2-last=Zimmern | author2-first= Heinrich |translator-last=Whitney Jr. | translator-first= K. William |title = Creation And Chaos in the Primeval Era And the Eschaton: A Religio-historical Study of Genesis 1 and Revelation 12 |publisher = Eerdman's |location=Grand Rapids | year =2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the Babylonian creation epic [[Enuma Elish]], the first step of creation has [[Marduk]] fighting and killing [[Tiamat]], a chaos monster, to establish order.&lt;ref name=CreachOxford/&gt;{{rp|4–5,16,18}} Kenneth A. Mathews says, "It has been typical of scholarship since Gunkel's ''Schöfung und Chaos'' (1895) to interpret Genesis 1's subjugation of 'the deep' and division of the 'waters' as a remnant of the battle motif between Marduk and watery Tiamat, which was taken up by the Hebrew author and demythologized, [but] most contemporary scholars now see the association of the Hebrew '''tehôm''' ('deep,' 1:2) with Tiamat as superficial."&lt;ref name="Kenneth A. Mathews"&gt;{{cite book| last=Mathews| first ="Kenneth A." | title =The New American Commentary: Genesis 1-11:26 | volume=1A | year=1996 |publisher = Broadman and Holman Publishers | location = Nashville, Tennessee |isbn = 978-0-8054-0101-1 | pages=92–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "The fact [the Genesis creation account] was likely part of the last stages of the creation of the Pentateuch may indicate that the portrait of God in Gen. 1:1–2:4a was normative for those who gave the Old Testament canon its present shape. Hence, it seems that the account of God creating without violence in Gen. 1:1–2:4a “now serves as the overture to the entire Bible, dramatically relativizing the other cosmologies."&lt;ref name=CreachOxford/&gt;{{rp|4}} 

Canaanite creation stories like the ''Enuma Elish'' use very physical terms such as "tore open," "slit," "threw down," "smashed," and "severed" whereas in the Hebrew Bible, Leviathan is not so much defeated as domesticated.&lt;ref name="Christopher B. Hays"/&gt;{{rp|69,70}}  Theologian Christopher Hays says Hebrew stories use a term for dividing (bâdal; separate, make distinct) that is an abstract concept more reminiscent of a Mesopotamian tradition using non-violence at creation. Most modern scholars agree that "Gen. 1:1–2:4a narrates a story of God creating without violence or combat. In [the Genesis] account, the elements do not represent rival deities, and the story declares the creation “good” (Gen. 1:10, 12, 18, 21, 25, 31). What is more, in Gen. 1:1–2:4a the elements participate in the process of ordering at God’s invitation (Gen. 1:9, 11, 20).”&lt;ref name=CreachOxford/&gt;{{rp|4}}&lt;ref name="Christopher B. Hays"/&gt;{{rp|69-72}}  Old Testament scholar [[Walter Brueggemann]] says "God's characteristic action is to "speak"... God "calls the world into being"... "The way of God with his world is the way of language."&lt;ref name="Walter Brueggemann"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brueggemann|first1=Walter|title=Genesis: Interpretation: A Bible Commentary for Teaching and Preaching|date=2010|publisher=Westminster Jon Know Press|location=Louisville, Kentucky|isbn=978-0-664-23437-9|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These stories in Genesis are not the only stories about creation in the Bible. In Proverbs 8, for example one reads of personified ''Wisdom'' being present and participant in creation.&lt;ref name="Christopher B.

However, he also says the differences are more pronounced than the similarities.&lt;ref name="Christopher B. Hays"/&gt;{{rp|69,70}}  Hays says ''Enuma Elish'' and Memphite theology are focused on a certain locale, where Genesis one does not mention a location (Isaiah 66:1); as has been noted, there is no theogeny in Genesis; and in the Canaanite stories the creators are glorified by being identified with other known deities whereas in Genesis, YHWH is glorified by the denial of other deities.&lt;ref name="Christopher B. Hays"/&gt;{{rp|69-72}}

The intent of Genesis 1:1-2n concerning "creation from nothing" is disputed. [[Jon Levenson]], writing Jewish [[biblical theology]], asserts the creation stories in Genesis are not ''[[ex nihilo]]'', but rather a generation of order out of chaos, similar to other ANE creation myths; the order allows life to flourish and holds back chaos which brings violence and destruction, which has never been obliterated and is always breaking back in.  He finds that the writers of the Hebrew Bible referred to God's actions at creation as a statement of faith in a God who could protect and maintain them, or who could also step back and allow chaos to rush back in, as God did with the Flood.  He finds that the writers of the Hebrew Bible also held up God's actions at creation as a challenge for God to act, and a challenge for themselves to work in covenant with God in the ongoing work of generating and maintaining order.&lt;ref name=LevonsonCreation&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levenson|first1=Jon D.|title=Creation and the persistence of evil : the Jewish drama of divine omnipotence|date=1994|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J.|isbn=9780691029504|edition=Paperback with revisions of the original edition, first published in 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Preface (1994)}}  In this, the Bible story is dissimilar to the both the Memphite story and the Babylonian in that the Hebrew Bible says the divine gift of working with God in creation is limited to humankind, meaning, for the Hebrews, humans alone are part of God's being.

Warfare represents a special category of biblical violence and is a topic the Bible addresses, directly and indirectly, in four ways: there are verses that support [[pacifism]], and verses that support [[non-resistance]]; 4th century theologian [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] found the basis of [[just war]] in the Bible, and [[preventive war]] which is sometimes called [[crusade]] has also been supported using Bible texts.&lt;ref name="Robert G.

===The Book of Judges and violence against women===

[[File:Cathedral Basilica of Saint Clement, Tenancingo, Mexico State, Mexico04.jpg|thumb|Deborah the Judge, Tenancingo, Mexico State, Mexico]]

Violence against women appears throughout the Old Testament. Many have attributed this to a [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] society, while some scholars say the problem stems from the larger context of a male dominated culture. Women are treated in differing ways in the Bible. For example, the Book of Judges includes the judge [[Deborah]], who was honored, as well as two of the most egregious examples in the Bible of violence against women: [[Jephthah]]’s daughter (Judg. 11:29–40) and the Levite’s concubine (Judg. 19).&lt;ref name=CreachOxford/&gt;{{rp|12}}&lt;ref name="Carol Meyers"&gt;{{cite book | last =Meyers | first = Carol | title =Discovering Eve: Ancient Israelite Women in Context | publisher =Oxford University Press | location = New York |year= 1988 | page = 43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar author [[Phyllis Trible]] looks at these instances from the perspective of the victim making their [[pathos]] palpable, underlying their human reality, and the tragedy of their stories.&lt;ref name="Phyllis Trible"&gt;{{cite book| last=Trible | first=Phyllis| title=Texts of Terror:Literary-Feminist readings of Biblical Narratives | publisher=Fortress Press | year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some feminist critiques of Judges say the Bible gives tacit approval to violence against women by not speaking out against these acts.&lt;ref name=CreachOxford/&gt;{{rp|14}}

O'Connor says women in the Old Testament generally serve as points of reference for the larger story, yet Judges abounds with stories where women play the main role.  O'Connor explains the significance of this, saying: "The period between the death of Joshua and the anointing of Saul...was a period of uncertainty and danger... lack of human leadership is viewed as disastrous, for when "every one does what is right in their own eyes, the results are awful" and that is illustrated by the violent acts against women recorded in Judges.&lt;ref name="OConnor1986"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/1811/58724/HAR_v10_277.pdf?sequence=1|title=The Women in the Book of Judges|last=O'Connor|first=M.|year=1986|journal=Hebrew Annual Review|volume=10|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|url=http://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1008&amp;context=fac_dis|year=1992|last=Hartman|first=Harvey D.|title=The Feminine Gender as a Literary Device in the Narrative of Judges}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|277,278}}

Beginning with the larger context and tracing the decline of Israel by following the deteriorating status of women and the violence done to them, which progresses from the promise of life in the land to chaos and violence, the effects of the absence of authority such as a king (Judges 21:25) is reflected in the violence against women that occurs when government fails and social upheaval occurs.&lt;ref name=CreachOxford/&gt;{{rp|14}}&lt;ref name="Mariam M.

===The violence of Hell===
{{main|Problem of Hell}}
The ancient Israelites did not worship the dead, sacrifice to them, or hope to reunite with them in an afterlife; a concept of hell as a place of punishment in the afterlife arose in [[Second Temple Judaism]] and was further developed in the Christian tradition; Judaism subsequently moved away from this notion.&lt;ref name="Alice K. Turner"&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Alice K.|title=The History of Hell|year=1993|publisher=Harcourt Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-15-600137-3| page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are Hebrew Bible verses indicating early Jewish thought did contain some belief in an afterlife. For example Isaiah 26:14 which is part of Proto-Isaiah (chapters 1–39), containing the words of Isaiah who lived in the Kingdom of Judah during the reigns of four kings from the mid to late 8th century BCE speaks of "the dead who live no more" as being "punished and destroyed". And Daniel 12:2,3 which is generally believed to date to the second century BCE asserts, "Many of those who sleep in the dust of the ground will awake, these to everlasting life, but the others to disgrace and everlasting contempt." More evidence comes from Maccabees, written in the second century BCE, and by the first century CE, friction between the Sadducees and the Pharisees over this issue is documented by both the New Testament writers and Josephus giving evidence of its presence in Jewish thought.&lt;ref name="Alice K. Turner"/&gt;{{rp|43}}

The word Sheol appears 65 times in the Hebrew Bible and the term "Tartaros" appears frequently in Jewish apocalyptic literature where it refers to a place where the wicked are punished.&lt;ref name = "John F. Walvoord"/&gt;{{rp|22}}&lt;ref name="William Crockett"/&gt;{{rp|14}}&lt;ref name="Alice K. Turner"/&gt;  In the New Testament there are three words translated ''Hell'': the Greek word ''hades,'' which is a general equivalent of the Hebrew ''Sheol,'' is used to identify the temporary place of the unsaved after death but is not used in relationship to the lake of fire or eternal punishment;  ''gehenna'' is uniformly translated Hell and refers to eternal punishment; and one occurrence of ''tartaros'' appears in 2 Peter 2:4 and is considered equivalent to ''gehenna''.  All the references to ''gehenna'' (except James 3:6) are spoken by Jesus himself.  A literal interpretation involves violence.&lt;ref name="John F. Walvoord"&gt;{{cite book | last = Walvoord | first = John F. |editor1-last =Crockett |editor1-first = William | editor2-last= Gundry | editor2-first= Stanley N. | title = Four Views on Hell | year = 1996 | publisher=Zondervan| isbn=0-310-21268-5| pages=11–28| chapter = chapter 1: The Literal View}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="William Crockett chapter"&gt;{{cite book | last = Crockett | first = William |editor1-last =Crockett |editor1-first = William | editor2-last= Gundry | editor2-first= Stanley N. | title = Four Views on Hell | year = 1996 | publisher=Zondervan| isbn=0-310-21268-5| pages=37–39, 43–91 | chapter = chapter 2: The Metaphorical View}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jesus also taught punishment in Hell would be by degrees (an idea Dante later developed) with one servant receiving a lighter beating than others, hypocrites receiving more condemnation than others, and so on.&lt;ref name = "John F. Walvoord"/&gt;{{rp|21}}

According to a statement by the publisher of "Four Views on Hell", [[Zondervan]], "probably the most disturbing concept in Christian tradition is the prospect that one day vast numbers of people will be consigned to Hell."&lt;ref name = "William Crockett"&gt;{{cite book| editor1-last=Crockett| editor1-first=William| editor2-last=Gundry| editor2-first= Stanley N.| title=Four views on Hell| year=1996| publisher = Zondervan| location =Grand Rapids, Michigan| isbn=0-310-21268-5| page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

C.S.Lewis argued that people choose Hell rather than repent and submit to God. Miroslav Wolf argues that the doctrine of final judgment provides a necessary restraint on human violence. Tim Keller says it is right to be angry when someone brings injustice or violence to those we love and therefore a loving God can be filled with wrath because of love, not in spite of it. Oliver O'Donovan argues that without the judgment of God we would never see the love in redemption.&lt;ref name="Stanley N.

===Marcionism and supersessionism===

As the [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|early Christian Church began to distinguish itself from Judaism]], the "Old Testament" and a portrayal of God in it as violent and unforgiving were sometimes contrasted rhetorically with certain teachings of Jesus to portray an [[image of God]] as more loving and forgiving, which was framed as a new image.&lt;ref name=Meyer/&gt;

[[Marcion of Sinope]], in the early second century, developed an [[Marcionism|early Christian dualist belief system]] that understood the [[Yahweh|god of the Old Testament]] and [[Creator deity|creator]] of the material universe, who he called the [[Demiurge]], as an altogether different being than the God about whom Jesus spoke. Marcion considered Jesus' universal [[God]] of compassion and love, who looks upon humanity with benevolence and mercy, incompatible with Old Testament depictions of divinely ordained violence. Accordingly, he did not regard the Hebrew scriptures as part of [[Development of the New Testament canon#Marcion of Sinope|his scriptural canon]].&lt;ref&gt;Metzger, Bruce. ''Canon of the NT'' {{ISBN|978-0-19-826180-3}}; The [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] of 1913 characterized Marcion as "perhaps the most dangerous foe Christianity has ever known."; [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/origin_nt.v.vi.html Harnack's Origin of the New Testament]: "Marcion, on the contrary, treats the Catholic Church as one that “follows the Testament of the Creator-God,” and directs the full force of his attack against this Testament and against the falsification of the Gospel and of the Pauline Epistles by the original Apostles and the writers of the Gospels. He would necessarily have dealt with the two Testaments of the Catholic Church if the Church had already possessed a New Testament. His polemic would necessarily have been much less simple if he had been opposed to a Church which, by possessing a New Testament side by side with the Old Testament, had ipso facto placed the latter under the shelter of the former. In fact Marcion’s position towards the Catholic Church is intelligible, in the full force of its simplicity, only under the supposition that the Church had not yet in her hand any “litera scripta Novi Testamenti.”"&lt;/ref&gt; Marcion's teaching was repudiated by [[Tertullian]] in five treatises titled "[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ante-Nicene_Fathers/Volume_III/Anti-Marcion/The_Five_Books_Against_Marcion Against Marcion]" and Marcion was ultimately excommunicated by the [[Christian Church|Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Jeremiah |first=Jorge V. |last=Pixley |author-link=George V.

For example, a recent edition of Religious Studies News, an Internet journal of the Society of Biblical Literature, advertises itself as a feature on violence in the Bible, yet articles focus with virtual singularity on Hebrew Bible texts and Hebrew Bible atrocities.... But by raising questions only about Hebrew texts, this issue performs a sort of violence of its own—the "real" problem lies in the "Jewish" texts, not in the Christian Testament....More troubling than studies of violence in the Bible that ignore the New Testament are those that lift up the New Testament as somehow containing the antidote for Old Testament violence.

That is the center of Christian faith. All the rest turns on this. A curious consequence of this confession is that simply because Christians are Christians they inevitably adopt some specific posture toward the Jewish people, a posture that is always theological and practical at once....The question, then, has never been whether Christians should speak and act with reference to the Jewish people. Rather, the question has been how they should do so, and how what they would say and do would affect the existence of the Jewish people. For most of the past two millennia, the church's posture toward the Jewish people has come to expression in the teaching known as supersessionism, also known as the theology of displacement.... In the early nineteenth century, some progressive Christian theologians carried the idea of supersessionism to a new level. According to them, the God of Jesus Christ was not revealed by the Hebrew Bible at all, and therefore had never entered into a special relationship with the Jewish people in the first place.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociological reflections and responses==

Jože Krašovec described the [[ancient near east]]ern (ANE) context in which the stories and text of the Hebrew Bible originated, in which gods were identified with peoples, and the flourishing or destruction of a people were a reflection of the power of its god or gods; while the ancient Israelites conceived of its deity as one person in contrast to the polytheistic conception of its neighbors, it remained like other ANE peoples in considering itself as a whole in relationship with its god.  From this foundation arose notions of flourishing of the nation as a whole, as well as [[collective punishment]] of the ancient Israelites and their enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krašovec|first1=Jože|title=Reward, punishment, and forgiveness : the thinking and beliefs of ancient Israel in the light of Greek and modern views|date=1999|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden [u.a.]|isbn=9004114432|oclc=42475527|chapter=Chapter XII: Holy War as Punishment and protection }} He cites the following examples of collective punishment (of descendants) in the Bible:
::Ex 20:5 - "You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, 6 but showing love to a thousand {generations} of those who love me and keep my commandments."
::Deut 5:9-10
::Exodus 34:6-7:  "And he passed in front of Moses, proclaiming, "The LORD, the LORD, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness, 7 maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children and their children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation."
::Deuteronomy 7:9-10 - "Know therefore that the LORD your God is God; he is the faithful God, keeping his covenant of love to a thousand generations of those who love him and keep his commands. 10 But those who hate him he will repay to their face by destruction;       he will not be slow to repay to their face those who hate him."
::Jeremiah 32:18  - " You show love to thousands but bring the punishment for the fathers' sins into the laps of their children after them. O great and powerful God, whose name is the LORD Almighty"
&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar [[Nur Masalha]] writes that the "genocide" of the extermination commandments has been "kept before subsequent generations" and served as inspirational examples of divine support for slaughtering enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Masalha, Nur, ''The Bible and Zionism: invented traditions, archaeology and post-colonialism in Palestine-Israel, Volume 1'', Zed Books, 2007, pp 273-276:
:"[[Michael Prior (theologian)|Prior]] revisits the old ground [in his book ''The Bible and colonialism: a moral critique''] … First, the biblical narrative, with its 'divine promise' was inherently linked with the mandate to ethnically cleanse or exterminate the indigenous people … third, in the narrative of the Book of Deuteronomy the divine command to commit 'genocide' is explicit.  Fourth, genocide and mass slaughter follow in the Book of Joshua.  These highly dubious traditions of the Bible have been kept before subsequent generations of Jews and Christians in their prayers…. The historical evidence, however, strongly suggests that such [[genocidal massacre]]s never actually took place, although these racist, xenophobic and militaristic narratives remained for later generations as powerful examples of divine aid in battle and of a divine command for widespread slaughter of an enemy…. [Professor Bernardo Gandulla, of the University of Buenos Aires], while sharing Prior's critique of the perverse use that Zionism and the State of Israel have made of the Bible to support their 'ethnic cleansing' policies in Palestine, …  Prior … found incitement to war and violence in the very foundation documents of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.  In the Hebrew Bible, for instance, there is a dominant strand that sees God as ethnocentric and militaristic.  Furthermore, in their conquest of Canaan, the Israelites are commanded by Yahweh to destroy the indigenous inhabitants of Palestine.  Later in the days of the Israelite kingdoms, they are urged to show no pity, but to massacre their enemies…. Today, both Christian Zionists in the West and Israeli messianics continue to refer to the Hebrew Scriptures for archetypal conflicts, which guide their attitudes towards the indigenous inhabitants of Palestine: the Palestinian Muslims and Christians."  Masalha refers to: [[Michael Prior (theologian)|Prior, Michael P.]], ''The Bible and colonialism: a moral critique'', Sheffield Academic Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur Grenke quotes historian, author and scholar [[David Stannard]]: "Discussing the influence of Christian beliefs on the destruction of the Native peoples in the Americas, Stannard argues that while the New Testament view of war is ambiguous, there is little such ambiguity in the Old Testament. He points to sections in Deuteronomy in which the Israelite God, Yahweh, commanded that the Israelites utterly destroy idolaters whose land they sought to reserve for the worship of their deity (Deut 7:2, 16, and 20:16–17). ... According to Stannard, this view of war contributed to the ... destruction of the Native peoples in the Americas. It was this view that also led to the destruction of European Jewry. Accordingly, it is important to look at this particular segment of the Old Testament: it not only describes a situation where a group undertakes to totally destroy other groups, but it also had a major influence on shaping thought and belief systems that permitted, and even inspired, genocide.&lt;ref&gt;Grenke, Arthur, ''God, greed, and genocide: the Holocaust through the centuries'', New Academia Publishing, LLC, 2005, pp 17–18: "Discussing the influence of Christian beliefs on the destruction of the Native peoples in the Americas, Stannard argues that while the New Testament view of war is ambiguous, there is little such ambiguity in the Old Testament.

Sociologists Frank Robert Chalk and Kurt Jonassohn question "the applicability of the term [genocide] to earlier periods of history, and the judgmental and moral loadings that have become associated with it."&lt;ref name="Frank Robert Chalk"&gt;{{cite book|author1-last=Chalk| author1-first="Frank Robert"| author2-last=Jonassohn| author2-first=Kurt| title=The History and Sociology of Genocide: Analyses and Case Studies| year=1990| publisher = Yale University Press| location=New Haven, Connecticut| isbn=0-300-04445-3| pages=3, 23–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since most societies of the past endured and practiced genocide, it was accepted as "being in the nature of life" because of the "coarseness and brutality" of life.&lt;ref name="Frank Robert Chalk"/&gt;{{rp|27}} Chalk and Jonassohn say the Old Testament contains cases they would consider genocide (if they were factual) because of women and children being killed even though it was war and casualties in war are excluded from the definition of genocide.

Historian and author [[William T. Cavanaugh]] says every society throughout history has contained both hawks and doves.

Arie Versluis says, "...indigenous populations have also appealed to the command (in Deut.7) in order to expel their colonizers.

Scholar Leonard B. Glick states that [[Jewish fundamentalism|Jewish fundamentalists]] in Israel, such as [[Shlomo Aviner]], consider the [[Palestinians]] to be like biblical Canaanites, and that some fundamentalist leaders suggest that they "must be prepared to destroy" the Palestinians if the Palestinians do not leave the land.&lt;ref&gt;Glick, Leonard B., "Religion and Genocide", in ''The Widening circle of genocide'',   Alan L. Berger (Ed). Transaction Publishers, 1994, p 46::"[God] looked with favor on what we may fairly call their [Israelite] proto-genocidal destructiveness.  The Book of Joshua provides us with one of the earliest texts in which a deity quite plainly promotes the destruction of a people.  As the Hebrews, under Joshua's leadership, undertake the conquest of Canaan, they massacre everyone who stands in their way…. It is instructive (and distressing) to note that contemporary Jewish ultra-nationalists in Israel root their politics in the Book of Joshua and equate their territorial aspirations with the will of God.  Here, for example, is [[Shlomo Aviner]], a prominent theorist of the Gush Emunim … movement: 'from the point of view of mankind's humanistic morality we were in the wrong in (taking the land) from the Canaanites.  There is only one catch.  The command of God ordered us to be the people of the land of Israel'.  Others have identified the Palestinians as 'Canaanites' who are engaged in a 'suicidal' struggle opposing God's own intentions;  hence the Jewish people must be prepared to destroy them if they persist in pursuing their collective 'death-wish'."&lt;/ref&gt; Several scholars draw similar conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Whitelam, Keith W., ''The invention of ancient Israel: the silencing of Palestinian history'', Routledge, 1996, especially pp 71–121.  Cited by Ehrlich,  pp 117 "Keith Whitelam (1996) has published a book [''The invention of ancient Israel: the silencing of Palestinian history''] in which he has implied that the modern European imperialist Zionist Jewish movement has drawn inspiration from the biblical conquest tradition … Parallels are thus drawn in Whitelam's thought between the genocidal Israelites presumably of Joshua's day and the racist Zionists of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and also between the ancient Canaanites and the modern Palestinians … the interpretations attributed to [Whitelam] of the place of the book of Joshua and its … genocidal account of Israel's emergence in the land that it claims as its own pose a challenge to Judaism…. It thus behooves us to ask … how has the Jewish community dealt with these foundational narratives, saturated as they are with acts of violence against others?…."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boustan, Ra'anan S., ''Violence, Scripture, and Textual Practice in Early Judaism and Christianity'', BRILL, 2010, page 4-5
:"Later readers of the Bible dramatically transformed this divine directive [Deut 20:15-18] through hermeneutic alignment of the Canaanites with the current detested 'other'.  Thus the Canaanites have been identified with … Palestinians (by militant Zionists), and scores of other 'enemies' of Israel.  In doing so, the violence perpetrated against these groups is not only justified, but indeed, part and parcel of the original divine plan.  The violent legacy of the Bible is a product of both its own violent narrative and the hermeneutics of violence applied to it".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[René Girard]], historian, literary critic, and philosopher of social science says that, "desire is mimetic (i.e. all of our desires are borrowed from other people), that all conflict originates in mimetic desire (mimetic rivalry), that the scapegoat mechanism is the origin of sacrifice and the foundation of human culture, and religion was necessary in human evolution to control the violence that can come from mimetic rivalry, and that the Bible reveals these ideas and denounces the scapegoat mechanism.".&lt;ref name="René Girard"&gt;{{cite book | last=Girard | first=René | title=The Scapegoat | year=1986 | publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press | location=Baltimore | isbn=0-8018-3315-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher, sociologist, theologian and author [[Jacques Ellul]] says: "I believe that the biblical teaching is clear. It always contests political power. It incites to "counterpower," to "positive" criticism, to an irreducible dialogue (like that between king and prophet in Israel), to antistatism, to a decentralizing of the relation, to an extreme relativizing of everything political, to an anti-ideology, to a questioning of all that claims either power or dominion (in other words, of all things political)...Throughout the Old Testament we see God choosing what is weak and humble to represent him (the stammering Moses, the infant Samuel, Saul from an insignificant family, David confronting Goliath, etc.). Paul tells us that God chooses the weak things of the world to confound the mighty..."

'''''The World of the Bible''''', published by [[Bayard Presse]], is a 150-page quarterly review that offers a historical, archeological, and artistic approach to the biblical universe. It succeeded Bible and Terre Sainte ([[Bible]] and Holy Land), {{ISSN|0006-0712}}, a periodical published by the eponymous organization from 1957 to 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.theworldofthebible.com/about-us/|website=The World of the Bible|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editor in chief of The World of the Bible is Benoît de Sagazan since October 2008.

Due to its editorial style, The World of the Bible is more appropriately called a review than a magazine. Its writers and contributors are often authorities in their disciplines, which vary from exegesis, history of religions, archeology, to art history.

Established scholars, such as Thomas Römer (professor at the Collège de France), Daniel Marguerat ([[University of Lausanne]]), Marie-Françoise Baslez (Sorbonne), Michel Quesnel ([[Catholic University of Lyon]]), Simon Claude Minouni (EPHE), Régis Burnet ([[Catholic University of Louvain-la-Neuve]]), Bertrand Lafond (CNRS), François Brossier (professor emeritus at the Catholic Institute of Paris), and archeologist Estelle Villeneuve (Maison René Ginouvès of archeology and ethnology, Nanterre), preside over its editorial and scientific committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Les Auteurs et Chercheurs du Monde de la Bible|url=http://prod.mondedelabible.com/les-auteurs-et-chercheurs-du-monde-de-la-bible/|website=Le Monde de la Bible|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Boehme Portrait 1730.jpeg|thumb|right|An idealised portrait of Jakob Böhme]]

'''Theosophy''', also known as '''Christian theosophy''' and '''Boehmian theosophy''', refers to a range of positions within [[Christianity]] which focus on the attainment of direct, unmediated knowledge of the nature of [[divinity]] and the origin and purpose of the universe.
They have been characterized as [[mystical]] and [[occult]]ist philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Forward, to the East: Mapthali Herz Imber's Perception of Kabbalah|last=Huss|first=Boaz|year=2013|journal=Journal of Modern Jewish Studies|volume=12|issue=3|page=398|doi=10.1080/14725886.2013.826464}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophy is considered part of [[Western esotericism]], which believes that hidden knowledge or wisdom from the ancient past offers a path to [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] and salvation.

The foundation of Christian theosophy is usually attributed to the German philosopher [[Jakob Böhme]].

In 1875, the term "theosophy" was adopted and revived by the [[Theosophical Society]], an esoteric organisation which spawned a spiritual movement also called [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]].&lt;ref&gt; "Following a period of obscurity, it was then revived at the end of the nineteenth century by the Russian occultist Helena Petrovna Blavatsky" Partridge, C. (2013). Understanding the Dark Side. Chester: University of Chester. page 3&lt;/ref&gt; In the twentieth century, theosophy became the object of study for various scholars of Western esotericism.

Theosophy comes from the Greek ''{{lang|grc|theosophia}}'' ({{lang|grc|θεοσοφία}}), which combines ''{{lang|grc|theos}}'' (θεός), "God"&lt;ref&gt;Liddell and Scott: ''Greek-English Lexicon''&lt;/ref&gt; and ''{{lang|grc|sophia}}'' ({{lang|grc|σοφία}}), "wisdom". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Theosophy |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/philosophy-and-religion/other-religious-beliefs-and-general-terms/miscellaneous-religion/theosophy |website=Encylopedia.com |publisher=Encylopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology |accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its etymological meaning is thus "wisdom of God."{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=24}} 

The term ''theosophia'' appeared (in both Greek and Latin) in the works of early [[church fathers]], as a synonym for [[theology]]:{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=24}}&lt;ref name = "Lobel"&gt;{{harvnb|Lobel|2007|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''theosophoi'' are "those knowing divine things".{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=24}}&lt;ref name="Faivre 1987"&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term however acquired various other meanings throughout its history.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adjective "theosophos" (θεόσοφος) "wise in divine things" was applied by [[Iamblichus]] to the [[gymnosophists]] (Γυμνοσοφισταί), i.e. the Indian [[yogi]]s or [[sadhu]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iamblichus]] (''De mysteriis'' 7.1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars of esotericism such as [[Joscelyn Godwin|Godwin]] and [[Antoine Faivre|Faivre]] differentiated the tradition of religious illumination from the religious system established in the late nineteenth century by [[Helena Blavatsky]] by referring to the latter with a capital letter as Theosophy, and the former with a lower-case letter as theosophy.{{sfn|Godwin|1994|p=xii}}&lt;ref name="Faivre 1994"/&gt; Followers of Blavatsky's movement are known as Theosophists, while adherents of the older tradition are termed theosophers.{{sfn|Godwin|1994|p=xii}}&lt;ref name="Faivre 1994"/&gt; Causing some confusion was the fact that a few Theosophists — such as C. C. Massey — were also theosophers.{{sfn|Godwin|1994|p=xii}}&lt;ref name="Faivre 1994"/&gt;

Antoine Faivre suggested that it be called "Boehmian theosophy".{{sfn|Faivre|1998|p=116}}

==Historical development==
{{see also|Transcendent theosophy}}
===Antiquity and medieval ending c. 1450 CE===
The term theosophy was used as a synonym for theology as early as the 3rd century CE.&lt;ref name = "Lobel" /&gt; The 13th century work ''[[Summa philosophiae]]'' attributed to [[Robert Grosseteste]] made a distinction between theosophers and theologians. In Summa, theosophers were described as authors only inspired by the holy books, while theologians like [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] and [[Origen]] were described as persons whose task was to explain theosophy. Therefore, the terms were the opposite of the present-day meaning.&lt;ref name="Faivre 1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Faivre|first=Antoine|title=Access to Western Esotericism|year=1994|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=0791421783}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===16th to 19th century===
During the [[Renaissance]], use of the term diverged to refer to [[gnostic]] knowledge that offers the individual enlightenment and salvation through a knowledge of the bonds that are believed to unite her or him to the world of divine or intermediary spirits.&lt;ref name="Faivre 1987"&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Christian theosophy arose in Germany in the 16th century. Inspired to a considerable extent by the works of [[Paracelsus]] (1493–1541).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Faivre|first=Antoine|title=Access to Western Esotericism|year=1994|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=0791421783|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term had not yet reached a settled meaning, however, as the mid-16th century ''Theosophia'' by [[Johannes Arboreus]] provided a lengthy exposition that included no mention of esotericism.&lt;ref name="Faivre1987"&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|1987|p=465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Christian theosophy and [[Pietism]] arose in response to the orthodoxy of the [[Lutheran Reformation]].{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=87}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote="[I]n the first decades of the seventeenth century, the German cobbler Jacob Böhme (1575–1624) wrote an oeuvre of impressive depth and originality that has become foundational for one of the major currents in the history of Western esotericism: Christian theosophy. In a heartfelt attempt to understand how a good God could have created a world so full of evil and suffering, Böhme developed a dramatic visionary cosmogony filled with alchemical and Paracelsian references, that described the 'birth of God' himself out of the unfathomable mysteries of the ''Ungrund''."|source=— Religious studies scholar Wouter Hanegraaff{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013|p=32}} }}

The work of the 17th-century German Christian mystic [[Jakob Boehme]] (1575–1624) strongly contributed to spread the use of the word "theosophy", even though Boehme rarely used the word in his writings. It is on account of the title of some of his works, but these titles appear to have been chosen more by the editors than by Boehme himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=13, see also p.19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, Boehme gave the word "theosophy" a limited meaning, making it clear that he was not conflating [[nature]] with [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boehme's work has been described as being "foundational" for Christian theosophy.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013|p=32}} There were relatively few theosophers in the 17th century, but many of them were prolific.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|pp=10–11 Faivre's list of 17th century theosophers in North-Western Europe (including Germany) consists of roughly ten names.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of Germany, there were also theosophers from Holland, England, and France. This group is represented by [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]] (1618–1699), [[Robert Fludd]] (1574–1637), [[John Pordage]] (1608–1681), [[Jane Leade]] (1623–1704), [[Henry More]] (1614–1687), [[Pierre Poiret]] (1646–1719), and [[Antoinette Bourignon]] (1616–1680).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=10-11 Henry More is added to the list by Faivre with some reservations}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophers of this period often inquired into nature using a method of interpretation founded upon a specific myth or revelation, applying [[active imagination]] in order to draw forth symbolic meanings and further their pursuit of knowledge toward a complete understanding of these mysteries.&lt;ref name="Faivre 1987"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|OED|1989|}} v. XVII, p. 903.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Athanasius Kircher]]'s ''[[Oedipus Aegyptiacus]]'' (1652), Kircher assigned the word theosophy to the metaphysics adhered to in [[ancient Egypt]], and to [[Neo-Platonism]], and thus he gave once again the word one of its most generally accepted meanings, that of divine metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, the word theosophy came into more widespread use among some philosophers. However, the term "theosophy" was still "practically absent" throughout the entire eighteenth century in dictionaries and encyclopedias, where it only appeared more and more frequently beginning in the second half of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=47 (Diderot is the one exception Faivre mentions)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophers themselves used the word theosophy sparingly, at least up until the middle of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Jakob Brucker]] (1696–1770) included a long chapter on theosophy in his monumental work {{cite book|title=Historia critica philosophia}} (1741). He included theosophers alongside other currents in esotericism in what was then a standard reference in the history of philosophy. By the 18th century, the word ''theosophy'' was often used in conjunction with {{clarify span|panosophy, i.e., a knowledge of divine things that is acquired by deciphering the supposed hieroglyphics of the concrete universe.|explain=panosophy vs. pansophy?|date=January 2015}} The term ''theosophy'' is more properly reserved for the reverse process of contemplating the divine in order to discover the content of the concrete universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|1987|p=467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, [[Robert Hindmarsh]], a printer with a Methodist background, formed a "Theosophical Society" in 1783, for translating, printing and distributing the writings of Swedenborg.&lt;ref&gt;Hindmarsh, Robert, ''Rise and Progress of The New Jerusalem Church In England, America and Other Parts,'' Hoderson and Sons, London 1861; {{ISBN|1-4021-3146-1}}.

Groups such as the [[Martinist Order]] founded by [[Papus]] in 1891, followed the theosophical current closely linked to the Judeo-Christian-Islamic tradition and Western esotericism. Theosophers outside of the initiate societies included people such as [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]] (1853–1900), whose views have been described as follows: "although empiricism and rationalism rest on false principles, their respective objective contents, external experience, qua the foundation of natural science, and logical thought, qua the foundation of pure philosophy, are to be synthesized or encompassed along with mystical knowledge in 'integral knowledge,' what Solovyov terms 'theosophy.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nemeth IEP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common characteristics==

Faivre stated that "Theosophy is a gnosis that has a bearing not only on the salvific relations the individual maintains with the divine world, but also on the nature of God Himself, or of divine persons, and on the natural universe, the origin of that universe, the hidden structures that constitute it in its actual state, its relationship to mankind, and its final ends."{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=23}}

Theosophy actually designates a specific flow of thought or tradition within the modern study of esotericism. Thus, it follows the path starting from the more modern period of the 15th century onward. Faivre describes the "theosophic current" or theosophy as a single esoteric current among seven other esoteric currents in early modern Western thought  (i.e., [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], Neo-Alexandrian [[hermetism|Hermeticism]], [[Christian Kabbalah]], Paracelsism (i.e., the studying of the "prognostications" of [[Paracelsus]]), [[Three Books of Occult Philosophy|philosophia occulta]] and [[Rosicrucianism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Faivre noted that there are "obvious similarities" between earlier theosophy and modern Theosophy as both play an important part in Western esotericism and both claim to deal with wisdom from a gnostic perspective. But he says there are also differences, since they do not actually rely on the same reference works; and their style is different. The referential corpus of earlier  theosophy "belongs essentially to the Judeo-Christian type", while that of modern Theosophy "reveals a more universal aspect".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are many differences between Christian theosophy and the Theosophical movement begun by Helena Blavatsky, the differences "are not important enough to cause an insurmountable barrier".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Modern theosophy retains its western Hermetic motive, logic and end.... The continuities are greater than the differences." Handbook of the Theosophical Current , Olav Hammer, Mikael Rothstein, BRILL, 2013 {{ISBN|9789004235977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theosophers engage in analysis of the universe, humanity, divinity, and the reciprocal effects of each on the other. The starting point for theosophers may be knowledge of external things in the world or inner experiences and the aim of the theosopher is to discover deeper meanings in the natural or divine realm. [[Antoine Faivre]] notes, "the theosophist dedicates his energy to inventing (in the word's original sense of 'discovering') the articulation of all things visible and invisible, by examining both divinity and nature in the smallest detail."&lt;ref name="Faivre 1987"/&gt; The knowledge that is acquired through meditation is believed to change the being of the meditator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Faivre identified three characteristics of theosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|pp=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three characteristics of theosophy are listed below.

''Theosophy'':
# Divine/Human/Nature Triangle: The inspired analysis which circles through these three angles. The intradivine within; the origin, death and placement of the human relating to Divinity and Nature; Nature as alive, the external, intellectual and material. All three complex correlations synthesize via the intellect and imaginative processes of Mind.  
# Primacy of the Mythic: The creative Imagination, an external world of symbols, glyphs, myths, synchronicities and the myriad, along with image, all as a universal reality for the interplay conjoined by creative mind.
# Access to Supreme Worlds: The awakening within, inherently possessing the faculty to directly connect to the Divine world(s). The existence of a special human ability to create this connection. The ability to connect and explore all levels of reality; co-penetrate the human with the divine; to bond to all reality and experience a unique inner awakening.

==Legacy and reception==

The scholar of esotericism [[Wouter Hanegraaff]] described Christian theosophy as "one of the major currents in the history of Western esotericism".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013|p=32}} 

===Academic study===

Christian theosophy is an under-researched area; a general history of it has never been written.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faivre|2000|p=31, also xxx.(Preface)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French scholar [[Antoine Faivre]] had a specific interest in the theosophers and illuminists of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. He wrote his doctoral thesis on [[Karl von Eckartshausen]] and Christian theosophy.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=6}}
Scholars of esotericism have argued that Faivre's definition of Western esotericism relies on his own specialist focus on Christian theosophy, Renaissance Hermeticism, and Romantic ''Naturphilosophie'' and therefore creates an "ideal" type of esotericism that does not suit all esoteric currents.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=11}}

{{TOC limit|2}}

== Theories ==
Central theories are [[Ed Diener|Diener's]] [[tripartite model of subjective well-being]], [[Carol Ryff|Ryff's]] [[Six-factor Model of Psychological Well-being]], [[Corey Keyes|Corey Keyes']] work on [[flourishing]], and [[Martin Seligman|Seligman]]'s contributions to [[positive psychology]] and his theories on ''authentic happiness'' and [[Martin Seligman#PERMA|P.E.R.M.A.]]

Positive psychology is concerned with [[eudaimonia]], "the good life" or [[flourishing]], living according to what holds the greatest value in life – the factors that contribute the most to a well-lived and fulfilling life. While not attempting a strict definition of the good life, positive psychologists agree that one must live a [[Happiness|happy]], engaged, and meaningful life in order to experience "the good life". [[Martin Seligman]] referred to "the good life" as "using your signature strengths every day to produce authentic happiness and abundant gratification".&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, M.E.P. (2009). Authentic Happiness. New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Christopher Peterson (psychologist)|Christopher Peterson]], "eudaimonia trumps hedonism".&lt;ref name="Peterson2008"&gt;Christopher Peterson (2008), [https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-good-life/200805/what-is-positive-psychology-and-what-is-it-not ''What Is Positive Psychology, and What Is It Not?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on positive psychology, well-being, eudaimonia and happiness, and the theories of Diener, Ryff, Keyes and Seligmann cover a broad range of levels and topics, including "the biological, personal, relational, institutional, cultural, and global dimensions of life."{{sfn|Seligman|Csikszentmihalyi|2000}}

The pursuit&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;http://thriving.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/Catalino - Prioritizing Positivity (Simon-Thomas Lecture).pdf&lt;/ref&gt; of happiness predicts both positive emotions and less depressive symptoms. People&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; who prioritize happiness are more psychologically able, all else held equal.

== Methodology of study ==

=== Well-being measurement ===
Different ways of measuring well-being reveal different contributing factors. The correlation between two of these, life satisfaction and happiness, in the World Values Survey (1981–2005) is only 0.47.&lt;ref name="internationaljournalofwellbeing.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://internationaljournalofwellbeing.org/index.php/ijow/article/viewFile/364/477 |title=A statistical meta-analysis of the wellbeing literature |website=internationaljournalofwellbeing.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are different, but related concepts which are used interchangeably outside of academia. Typically, life satisfaction, or evaluative wellbeing is measured with Cantril’s self-anchoring ladder, a questionnaire where wellbeing is rated on a scale from 1–10. Happiness or hedonic/Affective well-being measurement is measured with the positive and negative affect schedule (PANAS), a more complex scale.

=== Limitations ===
The UK Government's Department of Health compiled a factsheet in 2014, in which it is stated that the key limitations to well-being, quality of life and life satisfaction research are that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wellbeing-and-health-policy|title=Wellbeing and health policy - GOV.UK|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There are numerous associations and correlations in the body of evidence, but few causal relationships, since existing longitudinal datasets "''do not use consistent wellbeing and predictor measures at different time points''";
* After controlling for mental health status, not many of the found associations are still significant;
* Subgroup analyses are rare;
* There are too few studies to conduct meta-analyses;
* There are too few interventional studies.

== Major factors ==

=== For evaluative well-being (life satisfaction) ===
Mental health is the strongest&lt;ref&gt;[http://cep.lse.ac.uk/_new/research/wellbeing/causes_and_effects_of_wellbeing.as ]{{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; individual predictor of life satisfaction. Mental illness is associated&lt;ref name=pmid26321990&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Garaigordobil M | title = Predictor variables of happiness and its connection with risk and protective factors for health | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 6 | pages = 1176 | year = 2015 | pmid = 26321990 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01176 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with poorer well-being. In fact, mental health is the strongest determinant of quality of life at a later age.

Studies&lt;ref name=pmid10784456&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mendlowicz MV, Stein MB | title = Quality of life in individuals with anxiety disorders | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 157 | issue = 5 | pages = 669–82 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10784456 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.157.5.669 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have documented the relationship between anxiety and quality of life.

The VOXEU&lt;ref name="voxeu1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voxeu.org/article/origins-happiness|title=Origins of happiness: Evidence and policy implications|first1=Andrew|last1=Clark|first2=Sarah|last2=Fleche|first3=Richard|last3=Layard|first4=Nattavudh|last4=Powdthavee|first5=George|last5=Ward | name-list-format = vanc |date=12 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; analysis of happiness showed the principal determinants of an adult’s life satisfaction to be income, parenting, family break up, mother's mental health and schooling.
The factors that explain life satisfaction roughly map (negatively) to those factors that explain misery. They are first and foremost diagnosed depression/anxiety, which explains twice as much as the next factor, physical health (number of medical conditions), that explains just as much variance in subjective well-being between people, as income and whether someone is partnered.
These factors count twice as much as each of whether someone is employed and whether they are a non-criminal, which in turn are 3 times as important as years of education.

Overall, the best predictor of an adult's life satisfaction is their emotional health as a child as reported by the mother and child. It trumps factors like the qualifications that someone gets and their behaviour at 16 as reported by the mother. A child and therefore an adult's emotional health is most affected itself by a mother's mental health, which is just over twice as important as family income.
2/3 as important as family income is parent's involvement, which is 0.1 partial correlation coefficients more important than aggressive parenting (negative), father's unemployment (negative), family conflict (negative) and whether the mother worked in the subject's 1st year of life.

Whether the mother worked thereafter has 0 correlation with well-being, however. In terms of non-family factors, the place where someone goes to secondary school matters a fair bit more than observed family background altogether, which in turn is slightly more important than the place where someone went to primary school.

=== For affective well-being (happiness) ===

The main determinants of affective well-being, by correlation and effect size are:&lt;ref name="internationaljournalofwellbeing.org"/&gt;

# Corruption index (-0.54)
# Public service quality (0.40)
# GDP per capita (although, there is evidence of publication bias) (0.39)
# Economic freedom (0.35)
# Human rights violations (-0.33)
# Political and economic violence (-0.28)
# Life expectancy at birth (0.27)
# Unemployment (0.19)
# Are you married (0.07)

Determinants that correlate highly with one another, for instance, alternative ways of measuring corruption, are excluded from this list.

== Biological factors ==

=== Gender ===
Over the last 33 years, a significant decrease in women's happiness leads researchers to believe that men are happier than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stevenson |first=B. |last2=Wolfers |first2=J. |year=2009|title=The paradox of declining female happiness |journal=American Economic Journal: Economic Policy |volume= 1 |issue=2 |pages=190–225. |doi=10.1257/pol.1.2.190 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a Pew Research Centre survey found that more women are satisfied with their lives than men, overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/men-or-women-happier.htm|title=Are men or women happier?|date=20 May 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has found no gender gap in happiness.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Happiness Inequality in the United States |first1=Betsey |last1=Stevenson |first2=Justin |last2=Wolfers |year=2008 |journal=[[Journal of Legal Studies]] |volume=37 |issue=S2 |pages=S33–S79 |doi=10.1086/592004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of these findings could be due to the way men and women differ in calculating their happiness. Women calculate the positive self-esteem, closeness in their relationships and religion. Men calculate positive self-esteem, active leisure and mental control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reid | first1 = A. | year = 2004 | title = Gender and sources of subjective well-being | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 51 | issue = 11/12| pages = 617–629 | doi = 10.1007/s11199-004-0714-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, neither men nor women are at greater risk for being less happy than the other. Earlier in life, women are more likely than men to fulfill their goals (material goals and family life aspirations), thereby increasing their [[life satisfaction]] and overall happiness. However, it is later in life that men fulfill their goals, are more satisfied with their family life and financial situation and, as a result, their overall happiness surpasses that of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Plagnol A, Easterlin R |title=Aspirations, attainments, and satisfaction: life cycle differences between American women and men |journal=Journal of Happiness Studies |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=601–619 |year=2008 |doi=10.1007/s10902-008-9106-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Possible explanations include the unequal division of labor within the household,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mencarini L, Sironi M |title=Happiness, Housework and Gender Inequality in Europe |journal=European Sociological Review |volume=0 |issue=2 |pages=1–17 |year=2010 |doi=10.1093/esr/jcq059 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or that women experience more variance (more extremes) in emotion but are ''generally'' happier.&lt;ref name="EcoAgeHap" /&gt; Effects of gender on well-being are paradoxical: men report feeling less happy than women,{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} however, women are more susceptible to depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Strickland B |title=Women and depression |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=132–5 |year=1992 |jstor=20182155 |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.ep10769766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study was conducted by Siamak Khodarahimi to determine the roles of gender and age on positive psychology constructs – psychological hardiness, emotional intelligence, self-efficacy and happiness – among 200 Iranian adolescents and 200 young adults who were questioned through various tests. The study found that the males of the sample showed significantly higher rates in psychological hardiness, emotional intelligence, self-efficacy and happiness than females, regardless of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khodarahimi|first1=Siamak | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Role of Gender on Positive Psychology Constructs in a Sample of Iranian Adolescents and Young adults|journal=Applied Research in Quality of Life|date=5 February 2013|volume=9|issue=1|pages=45–61|doi=10.1007/s11482-013-9212-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Determining whether emotions have a genetic trait or not were studied by David Lykken and Auke Tellegen. They found that up to 80% of a long-term sense of [[well-being]] is due to heredity. Basically, our families are important to our eventual emotional lives as adults because they provide us with genetic material that largely determines our base [[emotional]] responsiveness to the world. Therefore, [[genetics|genetic]] makeup is far more important to the long-term quality of our emotional lives than is learned behavior or the quality of our early childhood environment, at least as found in our current socio-economic paradigm.&lt;ref name="Lykken"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lykken D, Tellegen A | year = 1996 | title = Happiness is a stochastic phenomenon | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 186–189 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00355.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining theoretical 20%, however, still leaves room for significant change in thoughts and behavior from environmental/learned sources that should not be understated, and the interpretation of variance in twin studies is controversial, even among clinical psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://vaughanbell.net/nature-vs-nurture-is-a-lie/ |title= Nature vs nurture is a lie | last1 = Bell | first1 = Vaughan | name-list-format = vanc | journal = The Psychologist | date = July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual differences in both overall Eudaimonia, identified loosely with [[self-control]], and in the facets of eudaimonia are inheritable. Evidence from one study supports 5 independent genetic mechanisms underlying the Ryff facets of this trait, leading to a genetic construct of eudaimonia in terms of general self-control, and four subsidiary biological mechanisms enabling the psychological capabilities of purpose, agency, growth, and positive social relations.&lt;ref name="pmid22432931"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Archontaki D, Lewis GJ, Bates TC | title = Genetic influences on psychological well-being: a nationally representative twin study | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 81 | issue = 2 | pages = 221–30 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 22432931 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6494.2012.00787.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurology===
It is generally accepted that happiness is at least in part mediated through [[dopaminergic]], [[adrenergic]] and [[serotonergic]] metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dfarhud D, Malmir M, Khanahmadi M | title = Happiness &amp; Health: The Biological Factors- Systematic Review Article | journal = Iranian Journal of Public Health | volume = 43 | issue = 11 | pages = 1468–77 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 26060713 | pmc = 4449495 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A correlation has been found between [[hormone]] levels and happiness. [[SSRI]]s, such as Prozac, are used to adjust the levels of [[serotonin]] in the [[Major depressive disorder|clinically unhappy]]. Researchers, such as [[Bruce K. Alexander|Alexander]], have indicated that many peoples usage of narcotics may be the unwitting result of attempts to readjust hormone levels to cope with situations that make them unhappy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alexander |first1=Bruce K. | title=Rat Park |journal=Psychopharmacology |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A positive relationship has been found between the volume of gray matter in the right [[precuneus]] area of the brain and the subject's subjective happiness score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sato W, Kochiyama T, Uono S, Kubota Y, Sawada R, Yoshimura S, Toichi M | title = The structural neural substrate of subjective happiness | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 16891 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26586449 | pmc = 4653620 | doi = 10.1038/srep16891 | bibcode = 2015NatSR...516891S }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meditation]] based interventions, including [[mindfulness]], have been found to correlate with a significant gray matter increase within the [[precuneus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kurth F, Luders E, Wu B, Black DS | title = Brain Gray Matter Changes Associated with Mindfulness Meditation in Older Adults: An Exploratory Pilot Study using Voxel-based Morphometry | journal = Neuro | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 23–26 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25632405 | pmc = 4306280 | doi = 10.17140/NOJ-1-106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hölzel BK, Carmody J, Vangel M, Congleton C, Yerramsetti SM, Gard T, Lazar SW | title = Mindfulness practice leads to increases in regional brain gray matter density | journal = Psychiatry Research | volume = 191 | issue = 1 | pages = 36–43 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21071182 | pmc = 3004979 | doi = 10.1016/j.pscychresns.2010.08.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kurth F, MacKenzie-Graham A, Toga AW, Luders E | title = Shifting brain asymmetry: the link between meditation and structural lateralization | journal = Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 55–61 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 24643652 | pmc = 4994843 | doi = 10.1093/scan/nsu029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fox KC, Nijeboer S, Dixon ML, Floman JL, Ellamil M, Rumak SP, Sedlmeier P, Christoff K | title = Is meditation associated with altered brain structure?

=== Neuroscience's findings ===
[[Neuroscience]] and brain imaging have shown increasing potential for helping science understand happiness and sadness. Though it may be impossible to achieve any comprehensive objective measure of happiness, some physiological correlates to happiness can be measured. [[Stefan Klein]], in his book ''The Science of Happiness'', links the dynamics of [[Neurobiology|neurobiological]] systems (i.e., dopaminergic, opiate) to the concepts and findings of positive psychology and social psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Stefan | last = Klein | authorlink = Stefan Klein | title = The Science of Happiness | publisher = Marlowe &amp; Company | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-56924-328-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nobel prize]] winner [[Eric Kandel]] and researcher Cynthia Fu described very accurate diagnoses of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] just by looking at fMRI brain scans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/episodes/2008/12/05 |title=Diagnosis – Radiolab |publisher=Wnyc.org |access-date=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By identifying [[neural correlate]]s for [[emotions]], scientists may be able to use methods like [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|brain scans]] to tell us more about the different ways of being "happy". Richard Davidson has conducted research to determine which parts of the brain are involved in [[positive emotions]]. He found that the left prefrontal [[cortex (anatomy)|cortex]] is more activated when we are happy and is also associated with greater ability to recover from negative [[emotion]]s as well as enhanced ability to suppress negative emotions. Davidson found that people can train themselves to increase activation in this area of their brains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Luz A, Dunne J, Davidson R | year = 2007 | chapter = Meditation and the neuroscience of consciousness | veditors = In Zelazo P, Moscovitch M, Thompson E | title = Cambridge Handbook of Consciousness | publisher = Cambridge University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that our [[brain]] can change throughout our lives as a result of our experiences; this is known as [[neuroplasticity]].

The evolutionary perspective offers an alternative approach to understanding happiness and quality of life. Key guiding questions are: What features are included in the brain that allow humans to distinguish between positive and negative states of mind? How do these features improve humans' ability to survive and reproduce? The evolutionary perspective claims that the answers to these questions point towards an understanding of what happiness is about and how to best exploit the capacities of the brain with which humans are endowed. This perspective is presented formally and in detail by the evolutionary biologist [[Bjørn Grinde]] in his book ''[[Darwinian Happiness]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Grinde | first = Bjørn | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2002 | title = Happiness in the perspective of evolutionary psychology | journal = Journal of Happiness Studies | volume = 3 | pages = 331–354 | doi = 10.1023/A:1021894227295 | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal factors ==

=== In relation with age ===

==== In adolescence ====
There has been a significant focus in past research on adulthood, in regards to well-being and development and although eudaimonia is not a new field of study, there has been little research done in the areas of adolescence and youth. Research that has been done on this age group had previously explored more negative aspects than well-being, such as problem and risk behaviours (i.e. drug and alcohol use).

Researchers who conducted a study in 2013 recognized the absence of adolescents in eudaimonic research and the importance of this developmental stage. Adolescents rapidly face cognitive, social and physical changes, making them prime subjects to study for development and well-being. The ''eudaimonic identity theory'' was used in their research to examine the development of identity through self-discovery and self-realization. They emphasize the personal value found in discovering and appeasing one's “''daimon''” ([[Daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]]) through subjective experiences that develop eudaimonic happiness from aligning with one's true self.&lt;ref name = "Coatsworth_2013"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Coatsworth JD, Sharp EH | title = The best within us: Positive psychology perspectives on eudaimonia | date = 2013 | publisher = American Psychological Association | location  = Washington, DC }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|250}}

Researchers focused their studies on PYD ([[positive youth development]]) and the ''eudaimonic identity theory'' in the context of three developmental elements: ''self-defining activities'', ''personal expressiveness'' and ''goal-directed behaviours''.

They determined that adolescents sample multiple ''self-defining activities''; these activities aid in identity formation, as individuals choose activities that they believe represents who they are. These ''self-defining activities'' also help determine the adolescent's social environments. For example, an adolescent involved in sports, would likely surround themselves with like-minded active and competitive people.

''Personal expressiveness'', as coined by psychologist A. S. Waterman, are the activities that we choose to express and connect with our “''daimon''” through subjective experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Waterman AS |title=Two conceptions of happiness: Contrasts of personal expressiveness (eudaimonia) and hedonic enjoyment|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1993|volume=64|issue=4|pages=678–691|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.64.4.678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, ''goal-directed behaviours'', are developed through goal setting, where individuals work towards identity establishment. Adolescents recognize their passions, abilities and talents and aim to fulfill their goals and behave in a way that appeases their true self.&lt;ref name = "Coatsworth_2013" /&gt;{{rp|251}}

The study on adolescents was conducted in Italy, Chile and the United States, which produced slightly varied outcomes. Outcomes were contingent on availability, access and choice of opportunities (activities).&lt;ref name = "Coatsworth_2013" /&gt;{{rp|254}} Socioeconomic context also affected the results, as not all individuals could access the activities that may be more in-line with their true selves.

The Personally Expressive Activities Questionnaire (PEAQ) was used to conduct the study. Adolescence was the youngest age group that the PEAQ was used on. The PEAQ asked adolescents to self-report on activities they participate in and describe themselves with ''self-defining activities''.&lt;ref name = "Coatsworth_2013" /&gt;{{rp|260}} It was reported that 80% of adolescents defined themselves with two to four ''self-defining activities'' signifying an understanding in adolescence of self-concept through the domains of leisure, work and academia.&lt;ref name = "Coatsworth_2013" /&gt;{{rp|255}}

Leisure activities were found to have the largest impact on individuals because these activities were the most self-directed of the three domains, as adolescents had the choice of activity, and were more likely to be able to align it with their true selves. The study found that subjective experiences were more important than the activities themselves and that adolescents reported higher levels of well-being. They reported that when adolescents express themselves through ''self-defining activities'' across multiple domains, they have a clearer image of themselves, of what they want to achieve and higher wellness. ''Goal-setting'' was found to be a unique predictor; when adolescents work towards goals set by themselves and accomplish them, they are likely to have a clearer emerging identity and higher well-being. Researchers found that more adolescents were happy when they were involved in self-chosen activities because the activities were chosen in line with their true self.&lt;ref name = "Coatsworth_2013" /&gt;{{rp|257–259}}

==== In midlife ====
The [[midlife crisis]] may mark the first reliable drop in happiness during an average human's life. Evidence suggests most people generally become happier with age, with the exception of the years 40 – 50, which is the typical age at which a ''crisis'' might occur. Researchers specify that people in both their 20s and 70s are happier than during midlife, although the extent of happiness changes at different rates. For example, feelings of stress and anger tend to decline after age 20, worrying drops after age 50, and enjoyment very slowly declines in adulthood but finally starts to rise after age 50.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianHappiness&gt;{{cite news|last=Bakalar |first=Nicholas | name-list-format = vanc |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/01/health/research/01happy.html?_r=1 |title=The Guardian, Happiness May Come With Age, Study Says.

Well-being in late life is more likely to be related to other contextual factors including proximity to death.&lt;ref name=pmid18605841&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gerstorf D, Ram N, Estabrook R, Schupp J, Wagner GG, Lindenberger U | title = Life satisfaction shows terminal decline in old age: longitudinal evidence from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 1148–59 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18605841 | pmc = 3551350 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.44.4.1148 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid18361663&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gerstorf D, Ram N, Röcke C, Lindenberger U, Smith J | title = Decline in life satisfaction in old age: longitudinal evidence for links to distance-to-death | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 154–68 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18361663 | pmc = 3482430 | doi = 10.1037/0882-7974.23.1.154 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However most of this terminal decline in well-being could be attributed to other changes in age-normative functional declines including physical health and function.&lt;ref name=pmid24660795&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burns RA, Mitchell P, Shaw J, Anstey KJ | title = Trajectories of terminal decline in the well-being of older women: the DYNOPTA project | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 44–56 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24660795 | doi = 10.1037/a0035370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there is growing debate that assumptions that a single population estimate of age-related changes in well-being truly reflects the lived experiences of older adults has been questioned. The use of growth mixture modelling frameworks has allowed researchers to identify homogenous groups of individuals who are more similar to each other than the population based on their level and change in well-being and has shown that most report stable well-being in their late life and in the decade prior to death.&lt;ref name=pmid25108532&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burns RA, Byles J, Magliano DJ, Mitchell P, Anstey KJ | title = The utility of estimating population-level trajectories of terminal wellbeing decline within a growth mixture modelling framework | journal = Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology | volume = 50 | issue = 3 | pages = 479–87 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25108532 | doi = 10.1007/s00127-014-0948-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings are based on decades of data, and control for cohort groups; the data avoids the risk that the drops in happiness during midlife are due to populations' unique midlife experiences, like a war. The studies have also controlled for income, job status and parenting (as opposed to [[childlessness]]) to try to isolate the effects of age.

Researchers found support for the notion of age changes inside the individual that affect happiness.
This could be for any number of reasons. Psychological factors could include greater awareness of one's self and preferences; an ability to control desires and have more realistic expectations – unrealistic expectations tend to foster unhappiness; moving closer to death may motivate people to pursue personal goals; improved social skills, like forgiveness, may take years to develop – the practice of forgiveness seems linked to higher levels of happiness; or happier people may live longer and are slightly overrepresented in the elderly population. Age-related chemical changes might also play a role.&lt;ref name=GuardianHappiness/&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardAge/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news|last=Bakalar |first=Nicholas  | name-list-format = vanc |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/01/health/research/01happy.html?_r=1 |title=The Guardian, Happiness May Come With Age, Study Says |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2010-05-31 |access-date=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EcoAgeHap&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/17722567 |title=Age and happiness: The U-bend of life|publisher=The Economist |date=2010-12-16 |access-date=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have found older individuals reported more health problems, but fewer problems overall. Young adults reported more anger, anxiety, depression, financial problems, troubled relationships and career stress. Researchers also suggest depression in the elderly is often due largely to passivity and inaction – they recommend people continue to undertake activities that bring happiness, even in old age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The activity restriction model of depressed affect suggests that stressors that disrupt traditional activities of daily life can lead to a decrease in mental health. The elderly population is vulnerable to activity restriction because of the disabling factors related to age. Increases in scheduled activity as well as social support can decrease the chances of activity restriction.&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, S. J., Snyder, C. R. "The Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology". Oxford University Press, 2009. p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In relation with depression and languishing ===
A study by Keyes found that there are major costs of depression, which 14% of adults experience annually: it impairs social roles; it costs billions each year due to work absenteeism, diminished [[productivity]], and [[healthcare]] costs; finally, depression accounts for at least one-third of [[suicides]]. Therefore, it is important to study flourishing to learn about what is possible if issues such as depression are tackled and how the ramifications of focusing on the positive make life better not just for one person, but also for others around them.&lt;ref name = "Keyes_2002" /&gt;

Flourishing has significant positive aspects magnified when compared to languishing adults and when languishing adults are compared to depressed adults, as explained by Keyes. For example, languishing adults have the same amount of chronic [[disease]] as those that are depressed whereas flourishing adults are in exceptionally better [[physical health]]. Languishing adults miss as many days at work as depressed adults and, in fact, visit [[Physician|doctors]] and [[therapists]] more than depressed adults.&lt;ref name="(2001).

==== Positive psychology interventions (PPI) in patients ====
A [[Strength-based practice|strengths-based approach]] to personal positive change aims to have clinical psychology place an equal weight on both positive and negative functioning when attempting to understand and treat distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Duckworth AL, Steen TA, Seligman ME | title = Positive psychology in clinical practice | journal = Annual Review of Clinical Psychology | volume = 1 | issue =  | pages = 629–51 | year = 2005 | pmid = 17716102 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.1.102803.144154 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This rationale is based on empirical findings. Because positive characteristics interact with negative life events to predict disorder the exclusive study of negative life events could produce misleading results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen LH, McGowan J, Fooskas S, Rose S | title = Positive life events and social support and the relationship between life stress and psychological disorder | journal = American Journal of Community Psychology | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 567–87 | date = October 1984 | pmid = 6496413 | doi = 10.1007/BF00897213 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/n2527h6pr72571x1/ | doi-broken-date = 2018-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, psychologists are looking to use positive psychology to treat patients. Amy Krentzman, among the others, discussed positive intervention as a way to treat patients. She defined positive intervention as a therapy or activity primarily aimed at increasing positive feelings, positive behaviors, or positive cognitions, as opposed to focusing on negative thoughts or dysfunctional behaviors. A way of using positive intervention as a clinical treatment is to use positive activity interventions. Positive activity interventions, or PAIs, are brief self-administered exercises that promote positive feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. Two widely used PAIs are “Three Good Things” and “Best Future Self.” “Three Good Things” requires a patient to daily document, for a week, three events that went well during the day, and the respective cause, or causes (this exercise can be modified with counterfactual thinking, that is, adding the imagination of things had them been worse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?dq=gratitude+counterfactual&amp;ei=YB2eVeC2I8Ll8AXNjYfoCA&amp;hl=en&amp;id=Qz4nhZ3ZMmgC&amp;lpg=PA332&amp;ots=CGH8m_Ee_j&amp;pg=PA332&amp;sa=X&amp;sig=pSTwZDyMo3_feDWFMeADTsaiWDY&amp;source=bl&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA|title=The Psychology of Gratitude|first1=Robert A.|last1=Emmons|first2=Michael E.|last2=McCullough | name-list-format = vanc |date=26 February 2004|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;). “Best Future Self” has a patient “think about their life in the future, and imagine that everything has gone as well as it possibly could. They have worked hard and succeeded at accomplishing all of their life goals. Think of this as the realization of all of their life dreams.” The patient is then asked to write down what they imagined. These positive interventions have been shown to decrease depression,&lt;ref name="Krentzman_2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bolier L, Haverman M, Westerhof GJ, Riper H, Smit F, Bohlmeijer E | title = Positive psychology interventions: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies | journal = BMC Public Health | volume = 13 | pages = 119 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23390882 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2458-13-119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and interventions focusing on strengths and positive emotions can, in fact, be as effective in treating disorder as other more commonly used approaches such as [[cognitive behavioral therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seligman ME, Steen TA, Park N, Peterson C | title = Positive psychology progress: empirical validation of interventions | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 60 | issue = 5 | pages = 410–21 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16045394 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.60.5.410 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sin2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sin NL, Lyubomirsky S | title = Enhancing well-being and alleviating depressive symptoms with positive psychology interventions: a practice-friendly meta-analysis | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 65 | issue = 5 | pages = 467–87 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19301241 | doi = 10.1002/jclp.20593 | url = http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~sonja/papers/SL2009.pdf | access-date = 2017-06-14 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120120164432/http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~sonja/papers/SL2009.pdf# | archive-date = 2012-01-20 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the apparent effect of PPIs cannot be caused by [[publication bias]], according to a [[meta-analysis]] on 49 studies (2009). PPIs studied included producing gratitude letters, performing optimistic thinking, replaying positive life experiences, and socializing with people.&lt;ref name=Sin2009 /&gt;

Also, in a newer meta-analysis (39 studies, 6,139 participants, 2012), the [[standardized mean difference]] was 0.34 higher for subjective well-being, 0.20 for psychological well-being and 0.23 for depression. Three to six months after the intervention, the effects for subjective well-being and psychological well-being were still significant, so effects seem fairly sustainable. However, in high-quality studies the positive effect was weaker, though positive, so authors considered further high-quality studies necessary to strengthen the evidence. They claimed that the above-mentioned meta-analysis (2009) did not put enough weight on the quality of studies.
PPIs found positive included blessings, kindness practices, taking personal goals, and showing gratitude.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The interventions called "Gratitude Journaling" and "Three Good Things" seem to operate via gratitude.&lt;ref name="Krentzman_2013"/&gt; There is evidence that, when gratitude journaling, focussing on quality over quantity as well as people more than possessions, yields greater benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/tips_for_keeping_a_gratitude_journal|title=Tips for Keeping a Gratitude Journal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence of a diminished effect from gratitude journaling if it is done more than once or twice a week. Journaling sans gratitude is effective in decreasing negative emotions in general, which suggests that the act of journaling, rather than gratitude alone, is involved in the treatment effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/research/action/romantic-relationships.aspx|title=Breakups aren't all bad: Coping strategies to promote positive outcomes|website=www.apa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Positive psychology seeks to inform clinical psychology of the potential to expand its approach, and of the merit of the possibilities. Given a fair opportunity, positive psychology might well change priorities to better address the breadth and depth of the human experience in clinical settings.

==== Post-traumatic growth ====
[[Posttraumatic growth]] (PTG) is a possible outcome after a traumatic event, besides [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD). Following a traumatic event, for instance rape, incest, cancer, attack, or combat, "it is normal to experience debilitating symptoms of depression and anxiety."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Reivich K, Shatte A |year=2003|title=The Resilience Factor: Seven Essential Skills For Overcoming Life's Inevitable Obstacles|publisher=Three Rivers Press|edition=Reprint|pages=9–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person who shows PTG however, will experience these negative outcomes for a time and then show an increase in well-being, higher than it was before the trauma occurred. [[Martin Seligman]], a founder of positive psychology, emphasizes that "arriving at a higher level of psychological functioning than before" is a key point in PTG.&lt;ref name="Seligman_2011"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Seligman ME |year=2011|title=Flourish: A visionary new understanding of happiness and wellbeing|location=New York, NY|publisher=Free Press|chapter=Ch. 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; If instead an individual experiences a depressive period but recovers from an incident and returns to their normal level of psychological functioning, they are demonstrating [[Psychological resilience|resilience]].&lt;ref name="Seligman_2011"/&gt; This suggests that in PTG, the trauma acts as a turning point for the person to achieve greater well-being. Seligman recognizes "the fact that trauma often sets the stage for growth" and given the right tools, individuals can make the most of that opportunity."&lt;ref name="Seligman_2011"/&gt;

When reflecting on a traumatic growth, Seligman suggests using the following five elements to facilitate PTG: understand the response to trauma, reduce anxiety, utilize constructive disclosure, create a trauma narrative, and articulate life principles and stances that are more robust to challenge.&lt;ref name="Seligman_2011"/&gt; Someone experiencing PTG will achieve elements of Seligman’s "good life" theory, including a more meaningful and purposeful valuing of life, improved positive relationships, accomplishment, and a more optimistic and open mindset according to the [[Broaden-and-build|broaden-and-build theory]].&lt;ref name="pmid8827649"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tedeschi RG, Calhoun LG | title = The Posttraumatic Growth Inventory: measuring the positive legacy of trauma | journal = Journal of Traumatic Stress | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 455–71 | date = July 1996 | pmid = 8827649 | doi = 10.1002/jts.2490090305 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Post-traumatic growth in constructive journalism ====
The phenomenon of PTG is applicable to many disciplines. The construct is important not only for just soldiers, emergency responders, and survivors of traumatic events, but on average, for everyday citizens facing typical adversity. One way to expose citizens to stories of PTG is through constructive journalism. Constructive journalism, as defined by PhD student Karen McIntyre at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, is "an emerging style of journalism in which positive psychology techniques are applied to news work with the aim of engaging readers by creating more productive news stories, all while maintaining core journalistic functions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = McIntyre K |year=2014|title=My current research focus is the subject of my dissertation: constructive journalism|url=http://karenmcintyre.org/research-2/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cathrine Gyldensted, an experienced reporter with a Masters in applied positive psychology and coauthor of two books, demonstrated that typical news reporting, which is associated with negative valence, harms mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis | vauthors = Gyldensted C |year=2011|title= Innovating News Journalism through Positive Psychology|type=Master Thesis|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/mapp_capstone/20/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using PTG to focus on victims' strengths and instances of overcoming adversity encourages readers to implement similar ideals in their own lives. "So the goal of positive psychology in well-being theory is to measure and to build human flourishing."&lt;ref name="Seligman_2011" /&gt; Combining positive psychology constructs like PTG, PERMA, and "broaden and build" with journalism could potentially improve affect and inspire individuals about the benefits of positive psychology.

PERMA not only plays a role in our own personal lives but also can be used for public major news stories. With this model, journalists can instead focus on the positives of a story and ask questions about how conflicts or even tragedies have brought people together, how someone has experienced post-traumatic growth, and more. News stories then shift the perspective from a victimizing one to an uplifting one. Positive psychology is slowly but steadily making its way through news reporting via constructive journalism. PERMA helps journalists ask the right questions to continue that progress by bringing the focus of a potentially negative story to the positives and solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://positivepsychologynews.com/news/cathrine-gyldensted/2013072426851|title=Hurricane Sandy, Utoya, Homelessness: Constructive News out of Loss}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Affect - ratio of positive to negative affect ====
Fredrickson and Losada postulated in 2005 that the [[ratio]] of positive to negative [[affect (psychology)|affect]], known as the [[critical positivity ratio]], can distinguish [[individual]]s that flourish from those that do not. Languishing was characterized by a ratio of positive to negative affect of 2.5. Optimal functioning or flourishing was argued to occur at a ratio of 4.3. The point at which flourishing changes to languishing is called the [[Losada line]] and is placed at the positivity ratio of 2.9. Those with higher ratios were claimed to have broader behavioral repertoires, greater [[flexibility (personality)|flexibility]] and resilience to [[adversity]], more social [[resources]], and more optimal functioning in many areas of their life.&lt;ref name="Frederickson, B.L., &amp; Losada, M.F."&gt;Fredrickson, B. L., &amp; Losada, M. F. (2005). Positive affect and complex dynamics of human flourishing. American Psychologist, 60, 678-686.&lt;/ref&gt; The model also predicted the existence of an upper limit to happiness, reached at a positivity ratio of 11.5. Fredrickson and Losada claimed that at this limit, flourishing begins to disintegrate and productivity and creativity decrease. They suggested as positivity increased, so to "appropriate negativity" needs to increase. This was described as time-limited, practicable [[feedback]] connected to specific circumstances, i.e. [[constructive criticism]].&lt;ref name="Frederickson, B.L., &amp; Losada, M.F." /&gt;

This positivity ratio theory was widely accepted until 2013, when Nick Brown, a graduate student in applied positive psychology, co-authored a paper with [[Alan Sokal]] and Harris Friedman, showing that the mathematical basis of the paper was invalid.&lt;ref name=pmid23855896&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown NJ, Sokal AD, Friedman HL | title = The complex dynamics of wishful thinking: the critical positivity ratio | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 801–13 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 23855896 | doi = 10.1037/a0032850 | arxiv = 1307.7006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fredrickson partially retracted the paper, agreeing that the math may be flawed, but maintaining that the empirical evidence is still valid.&lt;ref name=pmid23855895&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fredrickson BL | title = Updated thinking on positivity ratios | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 814–22 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 23855895 | doi = 10.1037/a0033584 }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Brown and colleagues insist there is no evidence for the critical positivity ratio whatsoever.&lt;ref name=pmid25197848&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown NJ, Sokal AD, Friedman HL | title = The persistence of wishful thinking | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 69 | issue = 6 | pages = 629–32 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25197848 | doi = 10.1037/a0037050 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In relation with basic emotions ===
Most [[psychologist]]s focus on a person's most basic [[List of emotions|emotions]]. There are thought to be between seven and fifteen basic [[emotion]]s. The [[emotion]]s can be combined in many ways to create more subtle variations of [[emotional]] experience. This suggests that any attempt to wholly eliminate negative emotions from our life would have the unintended consequence of losing the variety and subtlety of our most profound emotional experiences. Efforts to increase positive emotions will not automatically result in decreased negative [[emotion]]s, nor will decreased negative emotions necessarily result in increased positive emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Schimmack, U. (2005). The structure of subjective well-being. In M. Eid &amp; R. Larsen (Eds.) The science of subjective well-being. New York, NY, US: Guilford Press, pp. 97–123.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell and Feldman Barrett (1992) described emotional reactions as core affects, which are primitive emotional reactions that are consistently experienced but often not acknowledged; they blend pleasant and unpleasant as well as activated and deactivated dimensions that we carry with us at an almost unconscious level.&lt;ref name=pmid10353204&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Russell JA, Barrett LF | title = Core affect, prototypical emotional episodes, and other things called emotion: dissecting the elephant | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 76 | issue = 5 | pages = 805–19 | date = May 1999 | pmid = 10353204 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.76.5.805 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence suggests negative emotions can be damaging. In an article titled "The undoing effect of positive emotions", [[Barbara Fredrickson]] et al. hypothesized positive emotions undo the cardiovascular effects of negative emotions. When people experience [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], they show increased [[heart rate]], higher [[blood sugar]], [[immune suppression]], and other adaptations optimized for immediate action. If unregulated, the prolonged physiological activation can lead to illness, [[coronary heart disease]], and heightened mortality. Both lab and survey research substantiate that positive emotions help people under stress to return to a preferable, healthier physiological baseline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fredrickson BL, Mancuso RA, Branigan C, Tugade MM | title = The Undoing Effect of Positive Emotions | journal = Motivation and Emotion | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 237–258 | date = December 2000 | pmid = 21731120 | pmc = 3128334 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research shows that improved mood is one of the various benefits of physical exercise.&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,197466,00.html Best Benefit of Exercise?

==== Behavioral repertoire ====
The [[broaden-and-build]] theory of positive emotions suggests positive emotions (e.g. [[happiness]], [[Interest (emotion)|interest]], [[Anticipation (emotion)|anticipation]])&lt;ref name="IPP2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Compton|first=William C | name-list-format = vanc |title=An Introduction to Positive Psychology|publisher=[[Wadsworth Publishing]]|year=2005|pages=23–40|chapter=2|isbn=0-534-64453-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; broaden one's awareness and encourage novel, varied, and exploratory thoughts and actions. Over time, this broadened behavioral repertoire builds skills and resources. For example, curiosity about a landscape becomes valuable navigational knowledge; pleasant interactions with a stranger become a supportive friendship; aimless physical play becomes exercise and physical excellence. Positive emotions are contrasted with negative emotions, which prompt narrow survival-oriented behaviors. For example, the negative emotion of [[anxiety]] leads to the specific [[fight-or-flight response]] for immediate survival.&lt;ref name="IPP2"/&gt;

==== Elevation ====
After several years of researching [[disgust]], [[Jonathan Haidt]], and others, studied its opposite; the term "elevation" was coined. Elevation is a pleasant moral emotion, involving a desire to act morally and do "good". As an emotion it has a biological basis, and is sometimes characterized by a feeling of expansion in the chest or a tingling feeling on the skin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Haidt|Haidt, Jonathan]] (2005). ''[[The Happiness Hypothesis]]''. Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haidt, J. (2003). [http://faculty.virginia.edu/haidtlab/articles/haidt.elevation-and-positive-psychology.manuscript.html Elevation and the positive psychology of morality]. In C. L. M. Keyes &amp; J. Haidt (Eds.) ''Flourishing: Positive Psychology and the Life Well-lived''. Washington DC: American Psychological Association. (pp.&amp;nbsp;275–289).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The concept of "flourishing" ===
{{Main|Flourishing}}

The term flourishing, in positive psychology, refers to optimal human functioning. It comprises four parts: goodness, generativity, growth, and [[psychological resilience|resilience]] (Fredrickson, 2005).&lt;ref name=pmid16221001&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fredrickson BL, Losada MF | title = Positive affect and the complex dynamics of human flourishing | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 60 | issue = 7 | pages = 678–86 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16221001 | pmc = 3126111 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.60.7.678 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fredrickson (2005), goodness is made up of: happiness, contentment, and effective performance; generativity is about making life better for future generations, and is defined by “broadened thought-action repertoires and behavioral flexibility”; growth involves the use of personal and social assets; and resilience reflects survival and growth after enduring a hardship.&lt;ref name=pmid16221001/&gt; A flourishing life stems from mastering all four of these parts. Two contrasting ideologies are languishing and psychopathology. On the mental health continuum, these are considered intermediate mental health disorders, reflecting someone living an unfulfilled and perhaps meaningless life. Those who languish experience more emotional pain, psychosocial deficiency, restrictions in regular activities, and missed workdays.&lt;ref name=pmid16221001/&gt; 
	
Fredrickson &amp; Losada (2005) conducted a study on university students, operationalizing positive and negative affect.&lt;ref name=pmid16221001/&gt; Based on a mathematical model which has been strongly criticized,&lt;ref name=pmid23855896/&gt; and now been formally withdrawn by Fredrickson as invalid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0034435 |title='Positive affect and the complex dynamics of human flourishing': Correction to Fredrickson and Losada (2005) |journal=American Psychologist |volume=68 |issue=9 |page=822 |year=2013 |last1=Fredrickson |first1=Barbara L |last2=Losada |first2=Marcial F | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fredrickson &amp; Losada claimed to have discovered a [[critical positivity ratio]], above which people would flourish and below which they would not. Although Fredrickson claims that her experimental results are still valid,&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Fredrickson, B. L. (2013). [http://www.unc.edu/peplab/publications/Fredrickson%202013%20Updated%20Thinking.pdf Updated thinking on positivity ratios]. American Psychologist. Electronic publication ahead of print.&lt;/ref&gt; these experimental results have also been questioned due to poor statistical methodology, and [[Alan Sokal]] has pointed out that "given [Fredrickson and Losada's] experimental design and method of data analysis, no data whatsoever could possibly give any evidence of any nonlinearity in the relationship between "flourishing" and the positivity ratio — much less evidence for a sharp discontinuity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/2013/09/19/fredrickson-losada-positivity-ratio-paper-partially-withdrawn/|title=Fredrickson-Losada "positivity ratio" paper partially withdrawn|publisher=Retraction Watch|date=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study surveyed a U.S. sample of 3,032 adults, aged 25–74. Results showed 17.2 percent of adults were flourishing, while 56.6 percent were moderately mentally healthy. Some common characteristics of a flourishing adult included: educated, older, married and wealthy. The study findings suggest there is room for adults to improve as less than 20 percent of Americans are living a flourishing life. (Keyes, 2002).&lt;ref name = "Keyes_2002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keyes CL | year = 2002 | title = The Mental Health Continuum: From Languishing to Flourishing in Life | url = | journal = Journal of Health &amp; Social Behavior | volume = 43 | issue = 2| pages = 207–222 | doi=10.2307/3090197| jstor = 3090197 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benefits from living a flourishing life emerge from research on the effects of experiencing a high ratio of positive to negative affect. The studied benefits of positive affect are increased responsiveness, "broadened behavioral repertoires", increased instinct, and increased perception and imagination.&lt;ref name=pmid16221001/&gt; In addition, the good feelings associated with flourishing result in improvements to immune system functioning, cardiovascular recovery, lessened effects of negative affect, and frontal brain asymmetry.&lt;ref name=pmid16221001/&gt; Other benefits to those of moderate mental health or moderate levels of flourishing were: stronger psychological and social performance, high resiliency, greater cardiovascular health, and an overall healthier lifestyle (Keyes, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keyes CL | title = Promoting and protecting mental health as flourishing: a complementary strategy for improving national mental health | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 62 | issue = 2 | pages = 95–108 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17324035 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066x.62.2.95 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The encountered benefits of flourishing suggest a definition: "[flourishing] people experience high levels of emotional, psychological and social well being due to vigor and vitality, self-determination, continuous self- growth, close relationships and a meaningful and purposeful life" (Siang-Yang, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;70).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Siang-Yang | first1 = T. | year = 2006 | title = Applied Positive Psychology: Putting Positive Psychology into Practice | url = | journal = Journal of Psychology &amp; Christianity | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 68–73 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Happiness ===
==== Happiness measurement ====
===== Oxford Happiness Questionnaire =====
Psychologists Peter Hills and [[Michael Argyle (psychologist)|Michael Argyle]] developed the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meaningandhappiness.com/oxford-happiness-questionnaire/214/ Oxford Happiness Questionnaire] by Michael Argyle and Peter Hills, a survey of current level of happiness. See also discussion in Hills, P., &amp; Argyle, M. (2002). The Oxford Happiness Questionnaire: a compact scale for the measurement of psychological well-being. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 33, 1073–1082.&lt;/ref&gt; as a broad measure of psychological well-being. The approach was criticized for lacking a theoretical model of happiness and for overlapping too much with related concepts such as [[self-esteem]], sense of purpose, social interest, [[kindness]], sense of [[humor]] and aesthetic appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Todd B. | last = Kashdan | url = http://mason.gmu.edu/~tkashdan/publications/happy.PDF | title = The assessment of subjective well-being (issues raised by the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire) | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | year = 2004 | pages = 1225–1232 | volume = 36 | doi = 10.1016/S0191-8869(03)00213-7 | issue = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Satisfaction with Life Scale =====
"Happiness" encompasses different emotional and mental phenomena. One method of assessment is [[Ed Diener]]'s Satisfaction with Life Scale. According to Diener, this five-question survey corresponds well with impressions from friends and family, and low incidence of [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt;{{clarify|date=June 2014}}

Rather than long-term, big picture appraisals, some methods attempt to identify the amount of positive affect from one activity to the next. Scientists use beepers to remind volunteers to write down the details of their current situation. Alternatively, volunteers complete detailed diary entries each morning about the day before.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt; A discrepancy arises when researchers compare the results of these short-term "experience sampling" methods, with long-term appraisals. Namely, the latter may not be very accurate; people may not know what makes their life pleasant from one moment to the next. For instance, parents' appraisals mention their children as sources of pleasure, while "experience sampling" indicates parents were not enjoying caring for their children, compared to other activities.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/daniel_kahneman_the_riddle_of_experience_vs_memory.html |title=Daniel Kahneman: The riddle of experience vs. memory &amp;#124; Video on |publisher=Ted.com |access-date=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Daniel Kahneman]] explains this discrepancy by differentiating between happiness according to the "experiencing self" compared to the "remembering self": when asked to reflect on experiences, [[List of memory biases|memory biases]] like the Peak-End effect (e.g. we mostly remember the dramatic parts of a vacation, and how it was at the end) play a large role. A striking finding was in a study of [[colonoscopy]] patients. Adding 60 seconds to this invasive procedure, Kahneman found participants reported the colonoscopy as ''more'' pleasant. This was attributed to making sure the colonoscopy instrument was not moved during the extra 60 seconds – movement is the source of the most discomfort. Thus, Kahneman was appealing to the remembering self's tendency to focus on the end of the experience. Such findings help explain human error in [[affective forecasting]] – people's ability to predict their future emotional states.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
[[File:Mrs. Humphrey Devereux by John Singleton Copley.jpg|thumb|upright|The "remembering self" may not be the best source of information for pleasing the "experiencing self".]]

==== Changes in happiness levels ====
[[File:Daniel KAHNEMAN.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Daniel Kahneman]]]]
Humans exhibit a variety of abilities. This includes an ability of emotional ''Hedonic Adaptation'', an idea suggesting that beauty, fame and money do not generally have lasting effects on happiness (this effect has also been called the [[Hedonic treadmill]]). In this vein, some research has suggested that only recent events, meaning those that occurred within the last 3 months, affect happiness levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Suh E, Diener E, Fujita F | title = Events and subjective well-being: only recent events matter | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 70 | issue = 5 | pages = 1091–102 | date = May 1996 | pmid = 8656337 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.70.5.1091 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tendency to adapt, and therefore return to an earlier level of happiness, is illustrated by studies showing lottery winners are no happier in the years after they've won.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt; Other studies have shown [[Paraplegia|paraplegics]] are nearly as happy as control groups that are not paralyzed,&lt;ref name=Seligman2002&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Seligman | first1 = Martin E. P. | name-list-format = vanc | authorlink = Martin Seligman|title = Authentic Happiness: Using the New Positive Psychology to Realize Your Potential for Lasting Fulfillment | year = 2002 | publisher = Free Press | location = New York | isbn = 0-7432-2297-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; after equally few years. Daniel Kahneman explains: "they are not paraplegic full time... It has to do with allocation of attention". Thus, contrary to our [[impact bias]]es, lotteries and paraplegia do not change experiences to as great a degree as we would believe.

However, in a newer study (2007), winning a medium-sized lottery prize had a lasting mental wellbeing effect of 1.4 GHQ points on Britons even two years after the event.&lt;ref name=jgao&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gardner J, Oswald AJ | title = Money and mental wellbeing: a longitudinal study of medium-sized lottery wins | journal = Journal of Health Economics | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–60 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 16949692 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhealeco.2006.08.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, adaptation can be a very slow and incomplete process. Distracting life changes such as the death of a spouse or losing one's job can show measurable changes in happiness levels for several years.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt; Even the "adapted" paraplegics mentioned above did ultimately report lower levels of pleasure (again, they were happier than one would expect, but not fully adapted).&lt;ref name=Diener&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/significant-results/201304/5-myths-positive-psychology|title=5 Myths of Positive Psychology| first = Robert | last = Biswas-Diener | name-list-format = vanc |work=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, adaptation is a complex process, and while it ''does'' mitigate the emotional effects of many life events it cannot mitigate them entirely.

===== Happiness set point =====
The happiness set point idea is that most people return to an average level of happiness – or a set point – after temporary highs and lows in emotionality. People whose set points lean toward positive emotionality tend to be cheerful most of the time and those whose set points tend to be more negative emotionality tend to gravitate toward pessimism and anxiety. Lykken found that we can influence our level of well-being by creating environments more conductive to feelings of happiness and by working with our genetic makeup.&lt;ref name="Lykken" /&gt; One reason that subjective well-being is for the most part stable is because of the great influence genetics have. Although the events of life have some effect on subjective well-being, the general population returns to their set point.&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, S. J., Snyder, C. R. "The Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology". Oxford University Press, 2009. p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LyubomirskyHappiness.jpg|thumb|right|In the recipe for one person's happiness, it is nonsensical to blame one ingredient (because all are necessary). However, when comparing two people's happiness, ingredients like genetics can account for as much as half the difference.]]
In her book ''[[The How of Happiness]]'', [[Sonja Lyubomirsky]] similarly argued people's happiness varies around a genetic set point. [[Robert Biswas-Diener|Diener]] warns, however, that it is nonsensical to claim that "happiness is influenced 30–50% by genetics". Diener explains that the recipe for happiness for an individual always requires genetics, environment, and behaviour too, so it is nonsensical to claim that an individual's happiness is due to only one ingredient.

Only differences in happiness can be attributed to differences in factors. In other words, Lyubomirsky's research does not discuss happiness in one individual; it discusses differences in happiness between two or more people. Specifically, Lyubomirsky suggests that 30–40% of the difference in happiness levels is due to genetics (i.e. [[heritable]]). In other words, still, Diener says it makes no sense to say one person's happiness is "due 50% to genetics", but it does make sense to say one person's difference in happiness is 50% due to differences in their genetics (and the rest is due to behaviour and environment).&lt;ref name="Lykken" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Diener/&gt;

Findings from twin studies support the findings just mentioned. Twins reared apart had nearly the same levels of happiness thereby suggesting the environment is not entirely responsible for differences in people's happiness.&lt;ref name="Lykken" /&gt; Importantly, an individual's baseline happiness is not ''entirely'' determined by genetics, and not even by early life influences on one's genetics. Whether or not a person manages to elevate their baseline to the heights of their genetic possibilities depends partly on several factors, including actions and habits. Some happiness-boosting habits seem to include gratitude, appreciation, and even altruistic behavior.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt; Other research-based habits and techniques for increasing happiness are discussed on this page.

Besides the development of new habits, the use of antidepressants, effective exercise, and a healthier [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] have proven to affect mood significantly. There is evidence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://faunalytics.org/veganism-help-reduce-stress-anxiety/|title=Does Veganism Help Reduce Stress and Anxiety? - Faunalytics|date=25 May 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that a vegan diet reduces stress and anxiety. [[Exercise]] is sometimes called the "miracle" or "wonder" drug – alluding to the wide variety of proven benefits it provides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=American Association of Kidney Patients|title=Physical Activity and Exercise: The Wonder Drug|url=http://www.aakp.org/aakp-library/Physical-Activity-and-Exercise/|access-date=2017-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927221329/http://www.aakp.org/aakp-library/Physical-Activity-and-Exercise/#|archive-date=2011-09-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pimlott N | title = The miracle drug | journal = Canadian Family Physician Medecin De Famille Canadien | volume = 56 | issue = 5 | pages = 407, 409 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20463262 | pmc = 2868602 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is worth mentioning that a recent book, ''[[Anatomy of an Epidemic]]'', challenges the use of non-conservative usage of medications for mental patients, specially with respect to their long-term positive feedback effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thersa.org/__data/assets/file/0009/407961/20110706MartinSeligman.mp3|title=Seligman, Martin E.P. (6 July 2011). "Flourish". Royal Society of Arts. audio|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche]] has said that neuro scientists have found that with meditation, an individual's happiness baseline can change.&lt;ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/science-has-proved-that-meditation-can-improve-quality-of-life-buddhist-master/articleshow/58200304.cms|title=Science has proved that meditation can improve quality of life: Buddhist master - Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and meditation has been found to increase happiness in several studies.A study on Brahma Kumaris [[Raja yoga]] meditators showed them having higher [[happiness]] (Oxford happiness questionnaire) than the control group.&lt;ref name=pmid24298493&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramesh MG, Sathian B, Sinu E, Kiranmai SR | title = Efficacy of rajayoga meditation on positive thinking: an index for self-satisfaction and happiness in life | journal = Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research | volume = 7 | issue = 10 | pages = 2265–7 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24298493 | doi = 10.7860/JCDR/2013/5889.3488 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Evidences against the happiness set point theory =====
In recent large panel studies divorce, death of a spouse, unemployment, disability and similar events have been shown to change the long-term subjective well-being, even though some adaptation does occur and inborn factors affect this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00479.x |jstor=20183166 |title=Adaptation and the Set-Point Model of Subjective Well-Being |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=75–9 |year=2016 |last1=Lucas |first1=Richard E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fujita and Diener found that 24% of people changed significantly between the first five years of the study and the last five years. Almost one in four people showed changes in their well-being over the years; indeed sometimes those changes were quite dramatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fujita F, Diener E | title = Life satisfaction set point: stability and change | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 88 | issue = 1 | pages = 158–64 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15631581 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.88.1.158 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Headey found that 5–6% of people dramatically increased their life satisfaction over a 15- to 20-year period and that the goals people pursued significantly affected their life satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Headey | first1 = B. | year = 2008 | title = Life goals matter to happiness: A revision of set-point theory | url = | journal = Social Indicators Research | volume = 86 | issue = 2| pages = 312–231 | doi = 10.1007/s11205-007-9138-y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Personal training to increase happiness =====
The easiest and best possible way to increase one's happiness is by doing something that increases the ratio of positive to negative emotions. Contrary to some beliefs, in many scenarios, people are actually very good at determining what will increase their positive emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thayer RE, Newman JR, McClain TM | title = Self-regulation of mood: strategies for changing a bad mood, raising energy, and reducing tension | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 67 | issue = 5 | pages = 910–25 | date = November 1994 | pmid = 7983582 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.67.5.910 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been many techniques developed to help increase one's happiness.

A first technique is known as the "Sustainable Happiness Model (SHM)." This model proposes that long-term happiness is determined upon: (1) one's genetically determined [[#Happiness set point|set-point]], (2) circumstantial factors, and (3) intentional activities. Lyubomirsky, Sheldon and Schkade suggest to make these changes in the correct way in order to have long-term happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lyubomirsky S, Sheldon KM, Schkade D | year = 2005 | title = Pursuing happiness: The architecture of sustainable change | url = | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 111–131 | doi = 10.1037/1089-2680.9.2.111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another suggestion of how to increase one's happiness is through a procedure called "Hope Training." Hope Training is primarily focused on hope due to the belief that hope drives the positive emotions of well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Lopez SJ, Floyd RK, Ulven JC, Snyder CR |year=2000|contribution=Hope therapy: Building a house of hope|editor=C.R. Snyder|title=The handbook of hope: Theory, measures, and applications|pages=123–148|location=New York|publisher=Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This training is based on the hope theory, which states that well-being can increase once people have developed goals and believe themselves to achieve those goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Rand, Kevin L., &amp; Cheaven, Jennifer S|year=2009|contribution=Hope theory|title=Oxford handbook of positive psychology|edition=2nd |editors= Lopez, Shane, J., Snyder, C.R. |location=New York, NY, US|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=323–333}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main purposes of hope training is to eliminate individuals from false hope syndrome. False hope syndrome particularly occurs when one believes that changing their behavior is easy and the outcomes of the change will be evidenced in a short period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00076 |title=The False-Hope Syndrome |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=9 |issue=4 |page=128 |year=2016 |last1=Polivy |first1=Janet |last2=Herman |first2=C. Peter  | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are coaching procedures based on positive psychology, which are backed by scientific research, with availability of intervention tools and assessments that positive psychology trained coaches can utilize to support the coaching process. Positive psychology coaching uses scientific evidence and insights gained in these areas to work with clients in their goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Biswas-Diener | first = Robert | name-list-format = vanc |year=2010|title=Practicing Positive Psychology Coaching: Assessment, Diagnosis, and Intervention | isbn = 978-0-470-53676-6|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Time and happiness ====
[[File:Slavyansky-Family portrait.jpg|thumb|A portrait commemorating a family's day together]]
[[Philip Zimbardo]] suggests we might also analyze happiness from a "time perspective". He suggested the sorting of people's focus in life by valence (positive or negative) and also by their time perspective (past, present, or future orientation). Doing so may reveal some individual conflicts, not over whether an activity is enjoyed, but whether one prefers to risk delaying gratification further. Zimbardo also believes research reveals an optimal balance of perspectives for a happy life; commenting, our focus on reliving positive aspects of our past should be high, followed by time spent believing in a positive future, and finally spending a moderate (but not excessive) amount of time in enjoyment of the present.&lt;ref name=ZimbardoTime&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/philip_zimbardo_prescribes_a_healthy_take_on_time.html |title=Philip Zimbardo prescribes a healthy take on time &amp;#124; Video on |publisher=Ted.com |access-date=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The "flow" ===
In the 1970s Csikszentmihalyi's started to study ''[[Flow (psychology)|flow]]'', a state of absorption where one's abilities are well-matched to the demands at-hand. Flow is characterized by intense concentration, loss of self-awareness, a feeling of being perfectly challenged (neither bored nor overwhelmed), and a sense "time is flying". Flow is intrinsically rewarding; it can also assist in the achievement of goals (e.g., winning a game) or improving skills (e.g., becoming a better chess player).&lt;ref name=Csikszentmihalyi1990&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Csikszentmihalyi | first1 = Mihaly | title = Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience | year = 1990 | publisher = Harper &amp; Row | location = New York | isbn = 0-06-016253-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone can experience flow, in different domains, such as play, creativity, and work.

Flow is achieved when the challenge of the situation meets one's personal abilities. A mismatch of challenge for someone of low skills results in a state of anxiety; insufficient challenge for someone highly skilled results in boredom.&lt;ref name=Csikszentmihalyi1990/&gt; The effect of challenging situations means that flow is often temporarily exciting and variously stressful, but this is considered [[Eustress]], which is also known as "good" stress. Eustress is arguably less harmful than [[chronic stress]], although the pathways of stress-related systems are similar. Both can create a "wear and tear" effect; however, the differing physiological elements and added psychological benefits of eustress might well balance any wear and tear experienced.

Csikszentmihalyi identified nine indicator elements of flow:
1. Clear goals exist every step of the way, 2. Immediate feedback guides one's action, 3. There is a balance between challenges and abilities, 4. Action and awareness are merged, 5. Distractions are excluded from consciousness, 6. Failure is not worrisome, 7. Self-consciousness disappears, 8. Sense of time is distorted, and 9. The activity becomes "[[autotelic]]" (an end in itself, done for its own sake)&lt;ref name="In zone"&gt;{{cite web |title="In the zone": enjoyment, creativity, and the nine elements of "flow" |publisher=MeaningandHappiness.com|url=http://www.meaningandhappiness.com/zone-enjoyment-creativity-elements-flow/26/|access-date=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; His studies also show that flow is greater during work while happiness is greater during leisure activities.&lt;ref name="Lopez, S. J. 2009. p. 200"&gt;Lopez, S. J., Snyder, C. R. ''The Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology''. Oxford University Press, 2009. p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health ===

==== Addiction ====
Arguably, some people pursue ineffective shortcuts to feeling good. These shortcuts create positive feelings, but are problematic, in part because of the lack of effort involved. Some examples of these shortcuts include shopping, drugs, chocolate, loveless sex, and TV. These are problematic pursuits because all of these examples have the ability to become addictive. When happiness comes to us so easily, it comes with a price we may not realize. This price comes when taking these shortcuts is the only way to become happy, otherwise viewed as an [[addiction]].&lt;ref name="Krentzman_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krentzman AR | title = Review of the application of positive psychology to substance use, addiction, and recovery research | journal = Psychology of Addictive Behaviors | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 151–65 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 22985057 | pmc = 3531570 | doi = 10.1037/a0029897 }} (Date is for advance online publication. The final form was published in March 2013.)&lt;/ref&gt; A review by Amy Krentzman on the Application of Positive Psychology to Substance Use, Addiction, and Recovery Research, identified, in the field of positive psychology, three domains that allow an individual to thrive and contribute to society.

One of these, A Pleasant Life, involves good feelings about the past, present, and future. To tie this with addiction, they chose an example of [[alcoholism]]. Research on positive affect and alcohol showed a majority of the population associates drinking with pleasure. The pleasure one feels from alcohol is known as somatic pleasure, which is immediate but a short lived sensory delight. The researchers wanted to make clear pleasure alone does not amount to a life well lived; there is more to life than pleasure. Secondly, the Engaged Life is associated with positive traits such as strength of character. A few examples of character strength according to ''Character Strength and Virtues: A Handbook and Classification'' by [[Martin Seligman|Seligman]] and Peterson (2004) are bravery, integrity, citizenship, humility, prudence, gratitude, and hope, all of which are shown in the rise to recovery. To descend into an addiction shows a lack of character strength; however, rising to recovery shows the reinstatement of character strengths, including the examples mentioned above. Thirdly, the Meaningful Life is service and membership to positive organizations. Examples of positive organizations include family, workplace, social groups, and society in general. Organizations, like [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], can be viewed as a positive organization. Membership fosters positive affect, while also promoting character strengths, which as seen in the Engaged Life, can aid in beating addiction.&lt;ref name="Krentzman_2013"/&gt;

==== Emotional health ====
Researcher Dianne Hales described an ''emotionally healthy'' person as someone who exhibits flexibility and adaptability to different circumstances, a sense of meaning and affirmation in life, an "understanding that the self is not the center of the universe", compassion and the ability to be unselfish, an increased depth and satisfaction in intimate relationships, and a sense of control over the mind and body.&lt;ref name=twsMay18&gt;{{cite news | first = Dianne | last = Hales | name-list-format = vanc  |title= An Invitation to Health, Brief: Psychological Well-Being 2010–2011 Edition | publisher = Wadsworth Cengage Learning  |page=26 |year= 2010 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=oP91HVIMPRIC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mental health ====
[[Richard Layard|Layard]] and others show that the most important influence on happiness is mental health.&lt;ref name="voxeu1"/&gt;

L.M. Keyes and Shane Lopez illustrate the four typologies of mental health functioning: flourishing, struggling, floundering and languishing. However, complete mental health is a combination of high emotional well-being, high psychological well-being, and high social well-being, along with low mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;Keyes, C.L.M., &amp; Lopez, S.J. (2002). Toward a science of mental health: Positive directions in diagnosis and interventions. In C.R. Snyder &amp; S.J. Lopez (Eds.), ''Handbook of positive psychology'' (pp. 45–59). London: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although health is part of well-being, some people are able to maintain satisfactory wellbeing despite the presence of psychological symptoms.&lt;ref name= Bos&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bos EH, Snippe E, de Jonge P, Jeronimus BF | title = Preserving Subjective Wellbeing in the Face of Psychopathology: Buffering Effects of Personal Strengths and Resources | journal = PLOS One | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = e0150867 | year = 2016 | pmid = 26963923 | pmc = 4786317 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0150867 | url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0150867 | bibcode = 2016PLoSO..1150867B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Physical health ====
Meta-analyses published between 2013 and 2017 show that exercise is associated with reductions in depressive symptoms, fatigue and QoL plus improvements in attention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, social functioning, schizophrenic symptoms, and verbal fluency in various special populations. However, aerobic exercise has no significant effect on anxiety disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kspope.com/ethics/exercise-meta-analyses.php|title=Meta-Analyses: Exercise's Psychological &amp; Physical Effects on Health, Disorders, &amp; Quality of Life|website=kspope.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 a study conducted by Andrew Steptow and Michael Marmot at University College London, found that happiness is related to biological markers that play an important role in health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Steptoe A, Wardle J, Marmot M | title = Positive affect and health-related neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and inflammatory processes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 | issue = 18 | pages = 6508–12 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15840727 | pmc = 1088362 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0409174102 | bibcode = 2005PNAS..102.6508S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers aimed to analyze whether there was any association between well-being and three biological markers: heart rate, [[cortisol]] levels, and plasma fibrinogen levels. The participants who rated themselves the least happy had cortisol levels that were 48% higher than those who rated themselves as the most happy. The least happy subjects also had a large plasma fibrinogen response to two stress-inducing tasks: the Stroop test, and tracing a star seen in a mirror image. Repeating their studies three years later Steptow and Marmot found that participants who scored high in positive emotion continued to have lower levels of cortisol and fibrinogen, as well as a lower heart rate.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In Happy People Live Longer (2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Frey BS | title = Psychology. Happy people live longer | journal = Science | volume = 331 | issue = 6017 | pages = 542–3 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21292959 | doi = 10.1126/science.1201060 | bibcode = 2011Sci...331..542F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruno Frey reported that happy people live 14% longer, increasing longevity 7.5 to 10 years and [[Richard Davidson]]'s bestseller (2012) ''The Emotional Life of Your Brain'' argues that positive emotion and happiness benefit long-term health.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

However, in 2015 a study building on earlier research found that happiness has no effect on mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu B, Floud S, Pirie K, Green J, Peto R, Beral V | title = Does happiness itself directly affect mortality?

Happiness does however seem to have a protective impact on immunity. The tendency to experience positive emotions was associated with greater resistance to [[Common cold|colds]] and [[Influenza|flu]] in interventional studies irrespective of other factors such as smoking, drinking, exercise, and sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen S, Doyle WJ, Turner RB, Alper CM, Skoner DP | title = Emotional style and susceptibility to the common cold | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 65 | issue = 4 | pages = 652–7 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12883117 | doi = 10.1097/01.PSY.0000077508.57784.DA }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen S, Alper CM, Doyle WJ, Treanor JJ, Turner RB | title = Positive emotional style predicts resistance to illness after experimental exposure to rhinovirus or influenza a virus | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 68 | issue = 6 | pages = 809–15 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17101814 | doi = 10.1097/01.psy.0000245867.92364.3c }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Positive emotional states have a favorable effect on mortality and survival in both healthy and diseased populations.

==== Alternative medicine ====
Health consumers sometimes confuse the terms "wellness" and "well-being". Wellness is a term more commonly associated with alternative medicine which may or may not coincide with gains in subjective well-being. In 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tga.gov.au/australian-government-response-review-medicines-and-medical-devices-regulation|title=Australian Government Response to the Review of Medicines and Medical Devices Regulation| publisher = Australian Government Department of Health. Therapeutic Goods Administration|date=15 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Australian Government reviewed the effectiveness of numerous complementary therapies: they found low-moderate quality evidence that the Alexander technique, Buteyko, massage therapy (remedial massage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amt.org.au/downloads/submissions/Evidence-Based-Massage-2009.pdf |title=Evidence based massage |website=www.amt.org.au |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;), tai chi and yoga are helpful for certain health conditions. On the other hand, the balance of evidence indicates that homeopathy, aromatherapy, bowen therapy, Feldenkrais, herbalism, homeopathy, iridology, kinesiology, pilates, reflexology and rolfing shiatsu were classed as ineffective.

==== Fruit and vegetable consumption ====
There is growing evidence that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables is related to greater happiness, life satisfaction, and positive mood as well. This evidence cannot be entirely explained by demographic or health variables including [[Socioeconomic status|socio-economic status]], [[Physical exercise|exercise]], [[smoking]], and [[body mass index]], suggesting a causal link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Conner TS, Brookie KL, Richardson AC, Polak MA | title = On carrots and curiosity: eating fruit and vegetables is associated with greater flourishing in daily life | journal = British Journal of Health Psychology | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 413–27 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25080035 | doi = 10.1111/bjhp.12113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies have found that fruit and vegetable consumption predicted improvements in positive mood the next day, not vice versa. On days when people ate more fruits and vegetables, they reported feeling calmer, happier, and more energetic than normal, and they also felt more positive the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = White BA, Horwath CC, Conner TS | title = Many apples a day keep the blues away--daily experiences of negative and positive affect and food consumption in young adults | journal = British Journal of Health Psychology | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 782–98 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 23347122 | doi = 10.1111/bjhp.12021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cross-sectional study|Cross-sectional studies]] worldwide support a relationship between happiness and fruit and vegetable intake. Those eating fruits and vegetables each day have a higher likelihood of being classified as “very happy,” suggesting a strong and positive correlation between fruit and vegetable consumption and happiness.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rooney C, McKinley MC, Woodside JV | title = The potential role of fruit and vegetables in aspects of psychological well-being: a review of the literature and future directions | journal = The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society | volume = 72 | issue = 4 | pages = 420–32 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24020691 | doi = 10.1017/S0029665113003388 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether it be in South Korea,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kye SY, Park K | title = Health-related determinants of happiness in Korean adults | journal = International Journal of Public Health | volume = 59 | issue = 5 | pages = 731–8 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25033934 | doi = 10.1007/s00038-014-0588-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fararouei M, Brown IJ, Akbartabar Toori M, Estakhrian Haghighi R, Jafari J | title = Happiness and health behaviour in Iranian adolescent girls | journal = Journal of Adolescence | volume = 36 | issue = 6 | pages = 1187–92 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24215965 | doi = 10.1016/j.adolescence.2013.09.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chile,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Piqueras JA, Kuhne W, Vera-Villarroel P, van Straten A, Cuijpers P | title = Happiness and health behaviours in Chilean college students: a cross-sectional survey | journal = BMC Public Health | volume = 11 | issue =  | pages = 443 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21649907 | pmc = 3125376 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2458-11-443 }}&lt;/ref&gt; USA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boehm JK, Williams DR, Rimm EB, Ryff C, Kubzansky LD | title = Association between optimism and serum antioxidants in the midlife in the United States study | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 75 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–10 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23257932 | pmc = 3539819 | doi = 10.1097/PSY.0b013e31827c08a9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blanchflower |first1=David G. |last2=Oswald |first2=Andrew J. |last3=Stewart-Brown |first3=Sarah  | name-list-format = vanc |title=Is Psychological Well-Being Linked to the Consumption of Fruit and Vegetables? |journal=Social Indicators Research |volume=114 |issue=3 |year=2012 |pages=785–801 |doi=10.1007/s11205-012-0173-y }}&lt;/ref&gt; greater fruit and vegetable consumption had a positive association with greater happiness, independent of factors such as [[smoking]], [[Physical exercise|exercise]], [[body mass index]], and [[Socioeconomic status|socio-economic factors]].

The documentary ‘food matters’ includes claims of well-being benefits of raw foods, which has been disputed as pseudoscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyondveg.com/tu-j-l/raw-cooked/raw-cooked-1i.shtml |title=Digestive Leukocytosis-What a Close Reading of Kouchakoff Reveals |publisher=Beyondveg.com |date= |access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hedonic well-being ===
Eudaimonic well-being has been found to be empirically distinguishable from hedonic well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10902-015-9683-z |title=Revisiting the Empirical Distinction Between Hedonic and Eudaimonic Aspects of Well-Being Using Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling |journal=Journal of Happiness Studies |volume=17 |issue=5 |page=2023 |year=2015 |last1=Joshanloo |first1=Mohsen }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Joshanloo M | title = A New Look at the Factor Structure of the MHC-SF in Iran and the United States Using Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 72 | issue = 7 | pages = 701–13 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 26990960 | doi = 10.1002/jclp.22287 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Identity ===
Individual roles play a part in cognitive well-being. Not only does having social ties improve cognitive well-being, it also improves psychological health.&lt;ref name="Thoits 1992 237"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thoits|first=Peggy | name-list-format = vanc |title=Identity Structures and Psychological Well-Being: Gender and Marital Status Comparisons|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|date=September 1992|volume=55|issue=3|page=237|doi=10.2307/2786794|jstor=2786794}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having multiple identities and roles helps individuals to relate to their society and provide the opportunity for each to contribute more as they increase their roles, therefore creating enhanced levels of cognitive well-being. Each individual role is ranked internally within a [[hierarchy]] of salience. [[Salience (neuroscience)|Salience]] is “...the subjective importance that a person attaches to each identity”.&lt;ref name="Thoits 1992 237"/&gt;

Different roles an individual has have a different impact on their well-being. Within this hierarchy, higher roles offer more of a source to their well-being and define more meaningfulness to their overall role as a human being.

[[Ethnic Group|Ethnic identity]] may play a role in an individual's cognitive well-being. Studies have shown that “...both social psychological and developmental perspectives suggest that a strong, secure ethnic identity makes a positive contribution to [[cognitive]] well-being”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Phinney | first1 = Jean S. | last2 = Horenczyk | first2 = Gabriel | last3 = Liebkind | first3 = Karmela | last4 = Vedder | first4 = Paul | name-list-format = vanc | title = Ethnic Identity, Immigration, and Well-Being: An Interactional Perspective | journal = Journal of Social Issues |date=September 2001|volume=57|issue=3|pages=493–510|doi=10.1111/0022-4537.00225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those in an acculturated society may feel more equal as a human being within their culture, therefore experiencing increased well-being.

=== Optimism and helplessness ===
[[File:Fluorescent Lamp.jpg|thumb|left|[[J.B. MacKinnon]] recommended taking full responsibility for one small, but clear improvement for the world (the way energy-saving activists did by promoting a new kind of lamp). Inspired by sociological research, MacKinnon said "vertical agitation" helps reduce feelings of helplessness.]]

[[Learned optimism]] refers to development of one's potential for a [[sanguine]] outlook.{{clarify|date=May 2018}} Optimism is learned as personal efforts and abilities are linked to personally desired outcomes. In short, it is the belief one can influence the future in tangible and meaningful ways. Learned optimism contrasts with [[learned helplessness]], which consists of a belief, or beliefs, one has no control over what occurs, and that something external dictates outcomes, e.g., success. Optimism is learned by consciously challenging negative [[Intrapersonal communication|self talk]]. This includes self talk on any event viewed as a personal failure that permanently affects all areas of the person's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2012.12.004 |title=Great expectations: A meta-analytic examination of optimism and hope |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=54 |issue=7 |page=821 |year=2013 |last1=Alarcon |first1=Gene M |last2=Bowling |first2=Nathan A |last3=Khazon |first3=Steven  | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intrapersonal, or internal, dialogues influence one's feelings. In fact, reports of happiness are correlated with the general ability to "rationalize or explain" social and economic inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Conservatives Happier Than Liberals | first = Jeanna
 | last = Bryner | name-list-format = vanc |work=LiveScience.com|url=http://www.livescience.com/health/080507-liberal-conservative.html|access-date=2008-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hope]] is a powerful positive feeling, linked to a learned style of goal-directed thinking. Hope is fostered when a person utilizes both ''pathways thinking'' (the perceived capacity to find routes to desired goals) and ''agency thinking'' (the requisite motivations to use those routes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | veditors = Snyder CR | year = 2000 | title = Handbook of hope: Theory, measures, and applications. | location = San Diego, CA | publisher =  Academic Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author and journalist [[J.B. MacKinnon]] suggested the cognitive tool of "Vertical Agitation" can assist in avoiding helplessness (e.g., paralysis in the face of Earth's many problems). The concept stemmed from research on denial by sociologist [[Stanley Cohen (sociologist)|Stanley Cohen]]. Cohen explained: in the face of massive problems people tend towards learned helplessness rather than confronting the [[Cognitive dissonance|dissonant]] facts of the matter. Vertical Agitation involves focusing on one part of a problem at a time, while holding oneself accountable for solving the problem – all the way to the highest level of government, business and society (such as advocating strongly for something: [[Compact fluorescent lamp|eco-friendly lightbulbs]]). This allows each individual in society to make vital "trivial" (read: small) changes, without being intimidated by the work needed to be done as a whole. Mackinnon added: a piecemeal approach also keeps individuals from becoming too 'holier than thou' (harassing friends and family about ''every'' possible improvement), where widespread practice of Vertical Agitation would lead to much improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utne.com/environment/Eco-Uncertainty-JB-MacKinnon-Explore.aspx |title=In an Age of Eco-Uncertainty: Vertical Agitation, Eco-Douchebags, Cohen' s Rule, and Lifestyle as Social Change |publisher=Utne.com |access-date=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personal finances ===

It has been argued that money cannot effectively "buy" much happiness unless it is used in certain ways, and that "Beyond the point at which people have enough to comfortably feed, clothe, and house themselves, having more money – even a lot more money – makes them only a little bit happier."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bennett|first1=Drake | name-list-format = vanc | title = Happiness: A buyer’s guide | url = http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/08/23/happiness_a_buyers_guide/ |access-date=1 April 2017|work=The Boston Globe|date=23 August 2009|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''[[Stumbling on Happiness]]'', psychologist [[Daniel Gilbert (psychologist)|Daniel Gilbert]] described research suggesting money makes a significant difference to the poor (where basic needs are not yet met), but has a greatly diminished effect once one reaches middle class (i.e. the [[Easterlin paradox]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Easterlin RA, McVey LA, Switek M, Sawangfa O, Zweig JS | title = The happiness-income paradox revisited | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 107 | issue = 52 | pages = 22463–8 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21149705 | pmc = 3012515 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1015962107 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/12/08/1015962107 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..10722463E }}&lt;/ref&gt; Every dollar earned is just as valuable to happiness up to a $75,000 annual income,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://80000hours.org/articles/money-and-happiness/|title=Everything you need to know about whether money makes you happy - 80,000 Hours|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; thereafter, the value of each additional dollar earns a diminishing amount of happiness.

People overestimate the influence of wealth by 100%.&lt;ref name=Aknin09&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/17439760903271421 |title=From wealth to well-being?

Professor of Economics [[Richard Easterlin]] noted that [[job satisfaction]] does not depend on salary. In other words, having extra money for luxuries does not increase happiness as much as enjoying one's job or social network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Easterlin R |year=2008|title=Income and happiness: towards a unified theory|journal=The Economic Journal|volume=11|issue=473|pages=465–484|doi= 10.1111/1468-0297.00646|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/files/papers/others/everything/easterlin2001a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert is thus adamant, people should go to great lengths to figure out which jobs they would enjoy, and to find a way to do one of those jobs for a living (that is, provided one is also attentive to social ties).

Unemployment is detrimental to individual well-being. However, that does not hold true in countries where unemployment is widespread. Psychology Today&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-mindful-self-express/201110/preserving-mental-health-during-unemployment|title=Preserving Mental Health During Unemployment|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; reports that the impact of unemployment is dampened in those for whom work is less central to their identity, those who receive less criticism and less negative judgments from others, those who can meet their immediate financial obligations and those who do not see their unemployment as high stress and negative. Other protective factors include the expectation of reemployment, routines that structure one's time and evaluating oneself as worthy, competent and successful. According to the latest&lt;ref name="liu.se"/&gt; systematic review of the economic literature on life satisfaction, unemployment is worse for wellbeing for those that are right wing or live in high income countries. Not all unemployment is bad, however: international data from sixteen Western countries indicates that retirement at any age yields large increases in subjective well-being that returns to trend by age 70.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-012-9399-2|title=Subjective Well-Being and Retirement: Analysis and Policy Recommendations | first = Elizabeth Mokyr | last = Horner | name-list-format = vanc |date=1 February 2014|publisher=|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|volume=15|issue=1|pages=125–144|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1007/s10902-012-9399-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive coaching, a workplace intervention for well-being and performance, is proven to work in certain contexts, according to a 2013 independent quantitative scientific summary synthesising high quality scientific research on coaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leadingchangenetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Structuring-and-Understanding-the-Coaching-Industry.pdf |title=Structure and understanding |website=leadingchangenetwork.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; It tells us that standard effect sizes for the outcomes of performance/skills, well-being, coping, goal-attainment and work/career attitudes range from 0.43 to 0.74.

A more recent study has challenged the [[Easterlin paradox]]. Using recent data from a broader collection of countries, a positive link was found between GDP and well-being; and there was no point at which wealthier countries' subjective well-being ceased to increase. It was concluded economic growth does indeed increase happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Stevenson, B., Wolfers, J.|year=2008|title=Economic growth and subjective well-being: Reassessing the Easterlin paradox|journal=Brookings Papers on Economic Activity|volume=39|issue=1|pages=1–102|doi=10.3386/w14282|url=http://users.nber.org/~jwolfers/papers/EasterlinParadox.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wealth is strongly correlated with life satisfaction but the correlation between money and emotional well-being is weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kahneman D, Deaton A | title = High income improves evaluation of life but not emotional well-being | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 107 | issue = 38 | pages = 16489–93 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20823223 | pmc = 2944762 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1011492107 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..10716489K }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pursuit of money may lead people to ignore leisure time and relationships, both of which may cause and contribute to happiness.&lt;ref name=Aknin09/&gt; The pursuit of money at the risk of jeopardizing one's personal relationships and sacrificing enjoyment from one's leisure activities seems an unwise approach to finding happiness.

Money, or its hectic pursuit, has been shown to hinder people's [[savoring]] ability, or the act of enjoying everyday positive experiences and emotions. In a study looking at working adults, wealthy individuals reported lower levels of savoring ability (the ability to prolong positive emotion) relative to their poorer peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Quoidbach J, Dunn EW, Petrides KV, Mikolajczak M | title = Money giveth, money taketh away: the dual effect of wealth on happiness | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 759–63 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20483819 | doi = 10.1177/0956797610371963 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have routinely shown that nations are happier when people's needs are met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/07/14/world-happiest-countries-lifestyle-realestate-gallup-table.html |title=Forbes article "Table: The World's Happiest Countries" |publisher=Forbes.com |date=2010-07-14 |access-date=2011-11-12 |first=Francesca |last=Levy  | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some studies suggest, however, that people are happier after spending money on experiences, rather than physical things,&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dunn EW, Aknin LB, Norton MI | title = Spending money on others promotes happiness | journal = Science | volume = 319 | issue = 5870 | pages = 1687–8 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18356530 | doi = 10.1126/science.1150952 | bibcode = 2008Sci...319.1687D }}&lt;/ref&gt; and after spending money on others, rather than themselves.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; However, purchases that buy ‘time’, for instance, cleaners or cooks typically increase individual well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whillans AV, Dunn EW, Smeets P, Bekkers R, Norton MI | title = Buying time promotes happiness | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 114 | issue = 32 | pages = 8523–8527 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28739889 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1706541114 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/114/32/8523 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lottery winners report higher levels of happiness immediately following the event. But research shows winner's happiness levels drop and return to normal baseline rates within months to years. This finding suggests money does not cause long-term happiness (1978).&lt;ref name="Brickman_1978"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brickman P, Coates D, Janoff-Bulman R | title = Lottery winners and accident victims: is happiness relative? | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 36 | issue = 8 | pages = 917–27 | date = August 1978 | pmid = 690806 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.36.8.917  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a more recent British study on lottery prizes between £1,000 and £120,000, a positive effect even two years after the event was found, the return to normal being only partial and varying.&lt;ref name=jgao /&gt;

One&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1877163 |title=The American Dream or the American Delusion?

Degree of ownership also matter:
“...housing property rights matter for subjective well-being. Specifically, using subjective well-being data from China, the authors find that homeownership is associated with higher levels of life satisfaction, although this happiness premium is larger for people who have full ownership compared to those who have only a minor ownership stake in their home.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2016.10.001 |title=Institutions and well-being |journal=European Journal of Political Economy |volume=45 |page=1 |year=2016 |last1=Bennett |first1=Daniel L |last2=Nikolaev |first2=Boris |last3=Aidt |first3=Toke S  | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the latest&lt;ref name="liu.se"/&gt; systematic review of the economic literature on life satisfaction, living in rural areas seems to have some association with well-being, because the included studies tend to control for income and rural areas tend to be poor. Income has a high effect on happiness and incomes are higher in urban areas, so chasing a rural lifestyle at the expense of income may be a ‘grass is always greener’ move.

Adults who live with parents also tend to have&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/living-at-home-with-your-parents/8135918|title=Adults living with their parents are Australia’s least happy, survey finds|first=Ange|last=McCormack | name-list-format = vanc |date=20 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; poorer levels of well-being.

=== Mindfulness ===
{{Main|Mindfulness (psychology)}}
[[File:Rollercoaster Tornado Avonturenpark Hellendoorn Netherlands.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Researchers recommend attending to the past to find fond memories, and the future to find hope, but ultimately focussing mostly on the present.&lt;ref name=ZimbardoTime/&gt; Daydreaming usually precedes drops in happiness. Mindfulness and activities that bring focus to the present (like roller coasters) may bring happiness partly by shifting people's focus away from the slightly saddening question "Am I happy?".&lt;ref name=GilbertWandering/&gt;&lt;ref name=KillingsworthMoment/&gt;]]

[[Mindfulness (psychology)|Mindfulness]] is an intentionally focused awareness of one's immediate experience. "Focused awareness" is a conscious moment-by-moment attention to situational elements of an experience: i.e., thoughts, emotions, physical sensations, and surroundings. An aim of mindfulness is to become grounded in the present moment; one learns to observe the arising and passing of experience. One does not judge the experiences and thoughts, nor do they try to "figure things out" and draw conclusions, or change anything – the challenge during mindfulness is to simply observe.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, J. (2003) Insight Meditation: The Practice of Freedom, Shambala, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Gunaratana H | year=1992|title=Mindfulness in Plain English|publisher=Wisdom Publications|quote="It should be noted that mindfulness is not an evolving term. It has a very distinct longstanding meaning that has remained the same since it was introduced over 2500 years ago. The practice is challenging and requires determination and dedication, particularly when one is starting out. As time passes, the practice becomes more natural."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benefits of mindfulness practice include reduction of stress, anxiety, depression, and chronic pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown KW, Ryan RM, Creswell JD  | year = 2007 | title = Mindfulness: Theoretical foundations and evidence for its salutary effects | url = | journal = Psychological Inquiry | volume = 18 | issue = 4| pages = 211–237 | doi=10.1080/10478400701598298}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Reverence (emotion)]].

Ellen J. Langer argued people slip into a state of "mindlessness" by engaging in rote behavior, performing familiar, scripted actions without much cognition, as if on autopilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Wayne | last1 = Weiten | first2 = Dana S. | last2 = Dunn | first3 = Elizabeth Yost | last3 = Hammer | name-list-format = vanc |title=Psychology Applied to Modern Life|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|page=521}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of focusing on present experiences also mention research by Psychologist [[Daniel Gilbert (psychologist)|Daniel Gilbert]], who suggested daydreaming, instead of a focus on the present, may impede happiness.&lt;ref name=GilbertWandering&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Killingsworth MA, Gilbert DT | title = A wandering mind is an unhappy mind | journal = Science | volume = 330 | issue = 6006 | pages = 932 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 21071660 | doi = 10.1126/science.1192439 | bibcode = 2010Sci...330..932K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=When the Mind Wanders, Happiness Also Strays | first = John | last = Tierney | name-list-format = vanc | publisher = The New York Times | date = 2010-11-15|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/16/science/16tier.html?_r=1&amp;hp|access-date=2010-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow researcher, Matt Killingsworth, found evidence to support the harm of daydreaming. Fifteen thousand participants from around the world provided over 650 000 reports (using an online application on their phones that requested data at random times). Killingsworth found people who reported daydreaming soon reported less happiness; daydreaming is extremely common.&lt;ref name=KillingsworthMoment&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ted.com/talks/matt_killingsworth_want_to_be_happier_stay_in_the_moment.html |title=Matt Killingsworth: Want to be happier? Stay in the moment|work=ted.com|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zimbardo (see "Time Perspectives" above) bestowed the merits of a present-focus, and recommended occasional recall of past positive experiences. Reflecting on past positive experiences can influence current mood, and assist in building positive expectations for the future.

There is research that suggests a person's focus influences level of happiness, where thinking too much about happiness can be counter-productive. Rather than asking: "Am I happy?" – which when posed just 4 times a day, starts to decrease happiness, it might well be better to reflect on one's values (e.g., "Can I muster any hope?").&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite AV media|url=http://www.cbc.ca/ideas/episodes/2011/06/20/say-no-to-happiness/|publisher=CBC Ideas|title=Say no to happiness|time=about 10 minutes in| first = Todd | last = Kashdan | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asking different questions can assist in redirecting personal thoughts, and perhaps, lead to taking steps to better apply one's energies. The personal answer to any particular question can lead to positive actions, and hopefulness, which is a very powerful, and positive feeling. Hopefulness is more likely to foster happiness, while feelings of hopelessness tend to undermine happiness.

Todd Kashdan, researcher and author of "Designing Positive Psychology", explained early science's findings should not be overgeneralized or adopted too uncritically. Mindfulness to Kashdan is very resource-intensive processing; he warned it is not simply better at all times. To illustrate, when a task is best performed with very little conscious thought (e.g., a paramedic performing practiced, emergency maneuvers).&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt; Nevertheless, development of the skill lends to its application at certain times, which can be useful for the reasons just described; Professor of Psychology and Psychiatry Richard J. Davidson highly recommends "mindfulness [[meditation]]" for use in the accurate identification and management of emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/training-the-emotional-brain|title=Training the Emotional Brain – An Interview with Richard J.

[[Ed Diener]] et al. (1999) suggested this equation: positive emotion – negative emotion = subjective well-being. Since tendency to positive emotion has a correlation of 0.8 with [[extroversion]] and tendency towards negative emotion is indistinguishable from [[neuroticism]], the above equation could also be written as extroversion – neuroticism = happiness. These two traits could account for between 50% to 75% of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Diener | first1 = Ed | last2 = Suh | first2 = Eunkook M. | last3 = Lucas | first3 = Richard E. | last4 = Smith | first4 = Heidi L. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Subjective well-being: Three decades of progress.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1 January 1999 |volume=125|issue=2|pages=276–302|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.125.2.276}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are all referring to the [[Big Five personality traits]] model of personality.

An emotionally stable (the opposite of [[Neuroticism|Neurotic]]) [[personality psychology|personality]] correlates well with happiness. Not only does emotional stability make one less prone to negative emotions, it also predicts higher social intelligence – which helps to manage relationships with others (an important part of being happy, discussed below).&lt;ref name="EcoAgeHap"/&gt;

Cultivating an [[Extroversion|extroverted]] [[temperament]] may correlate with happiness for the same reason: it builds relationships and support groups. Some people may be fortunate, from the standpoint of [[Personality psychology|personality theories]] that suggest individuals have control over their long-term behaviors and cognitions. Genetic studies indicate genes for personality (specifically [[extroversion]], [[neuroticism]] and [[conscientiousness]]), and a general factor linking all 5 traits, account for the heritability of [[subjective well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiss A, Bates TC, Luciano M | title = Happiness is a personal(ity) thing: the genetics of personality and well-being in a representative sample | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 205–10 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18315789 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02068.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research suggests there is a happiness gene, the 5-HTT gene.&lt;ref name="Journal of Human Genetics"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nordqvist|first=Christian| name-list-format = vanc |title=Happiness Gene Located | url = http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/224536.php | publisher=Medical News Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Purpose in life ===
Purpose in life refers broadly to the pursuit of life satisfaction. It has also been found that those with high purpose in life scores have strong goals and sense of direction. They feel there is meaning to their past and present life, and hold beliefs that continue to give their life purpose. Research in the past has focused on purpose in the face of adversity (what is awful, difficult, or absurd in life). Recently, research has shifted to include a focus on the role of purpose in personal fulfillment and self-actualization.

The [[self-control]] approach, as expounded by [[C. R. Snyder]], focusses on exercising self-control to achieve self-esteem by fulfilling goals and feeling in control of our own success. This is further reinforced by a sense of intentionality in both efforts and outcomes.&lt;ref name="FeldmanSnyder2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feldman|first1=David B.|last2=Snyder|first2=C. R.  | name-list-format = vanc  |title=Hope and the Meaningful Life: Theoretical and Empirical Associations Between Goal–Directed Thinking and Life Meaning|journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology|volume=24|issue=3|year=2005|pages=401–421|issn=0736-7236|doi=10.1521/jscp.24.3.401.65616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[intrinsic motivation]] approach of [[Viktor Frankl]] emphasized finding value in three main areas: creative, experiential, and attitudinal. Creative values are expressed in acts of creating or producing something. Experiential values are actualized through the senses, and may overlap the hedonistic view of happiness. Attitudinal values are prominent for individuals who are unable to pursue the preceding two classes of values. Attitudinal values are believed to be primarily responsible for allowing individuals to endure suffering with dignity.&lt;ref name="FeldmanSnyder2005"/&gt;

A personal sense of responsibility is required for the pursuit of the values that give life meaning, but it is the realization that one holds sole responsibility for rendering life meaningful that allows the values to be actualized and life to be given true purpose. Determining what is meaningful for one's self provides a sense of autonomy and control which promotes self-esteem.&lt;ref name="FeldmanSnyder2005"/&gt;

Purpose in life is positively correlated with education level and volunteerism. However, it has also been found to decrease with age.
Purpose in life is both highly individual, and what specifically provides purpose will change over the course of one's lifetime.&lt;ref name="RyffSinger2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryff|first1=Carol D.|last2=Singer|first2=Burton H.  | name-list-format = vanc  |title=Know Thyself and Become What You Are: A Eudaimonic Approach to Psychological Well-Being|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|volume=9|issue=1|year=2006|pages=13–39|issn=1389-4978|doi=10.1007/s10902-006-9019-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All three of the above theories have self-esteem at their core. Self-esteem is often viewed as the most significant measure of psychological well-being, and highly correlated with many life-regulating skills. Purpose in life promotes and is a source of self-esteem; it is not a by-product of self-esteem.

=== Self-efficacy ===
[[Self-efficacy]] refers to a belief that one's ability to accomplish a task is a function of personal effort. Low self-efficacy, or a disconnect between ability and personal effort, is associated with [[Depression (mood)|depression]]; by comparison, high self-efficacy is associated with positive change, including overcoming abuse, overcoming eating disorders, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. High self-efficacy also has positive benefits for one's [[immune system]], aids in stress management, and decreases pain.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; A related concept, [[Personal effectiveness]], is primarily concerned with planning and the implementation of methods of accomplishment.

=== Sports ===
According to Bloodworth and McNamee sports and physical activities are a key contributor to the development of people's well-being. The influence of sports on well-being is conceptualized within a framework which includes impermanence, its [[hedonistic]] shallowness and its [[epistemological]] inadequacy.{{clarify|date=February 2015}} Researching the effect of sport on well-being is difficult as some societies are unable to access sports, a deficiency in studying this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bloodworth | first1 = Andrew | first2 = Mike | last2 = McNamee | name-list-format = vanc |title=Sport, physical activity and well-being: An objectivist account|journal=Sport, Education and Society|date=August 2012|volume=17|issue=4|page=18|doi=10.1080/13573322.2011.608948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Suffering ===
{{Quote box|align=left|width=30%| quoted=1 |quote= Research has shown it is possible to help suffering people by building their strengths. In addition, prevention researchers have discovered strengths act as buffers against mental illness. The strengths that represent major strides in prevention include: courage, future mindedness, optimism, faith, work ethic, hope, honesty, perseverance, and the capacity for flow and insight.&lt;ref name=PennUniPPC/&gt;}}
[[Suffering]] can indicate behavior worthy of change, as well as ideas that require a person's careful attention and consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mendeley.com/research/role-suffering-human-flourishing-contributions-positive-psychology-theology-philosophy/ |title=M Elizabeth Lewis Hall, Richard Langer, Jason Mcmartin.

The [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s Positive Psychology Center explains: "Psychology’s concern with remedying human problems is understandable and should certainly not be abandoned.

[[File:Dalai Lama and Seattle Mayor Norm Rice, 1993.jpg|thumb|right|According to Peterson, the Buddhist saying that "life is suffering" can be understood as a reality that humans must accept, as well as a call to cultivate virtues.]]
In reference to the Buddhist saying "Life is suffering", researcher and clinical psychologist [[Jordan Peterson]] suggested this view as realistic, not pessimistic, where acceptance of the reality life is harsh, provides a freedom from the expectation one should always be happy. This realization can assist in the management of inevitable suffering. To Peterson, virtues are important because they provide people with essential tools to escape suffering (e.g., the strength to admit [[cognitive dissonance|dissonant]] truths to themselves). Peterson maintained suffering is made worse by false philosophy (i.e., denial that natural suffering is inevitable).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvo.org/TVO/WebObjects/TVO.woa?videoid%3F713852509001 |title=TVO.ORG &amp;#124; Video &amp;#124; TVO – Jordan Peterson on The Necessity of Virtue |publisher=TVO |date=2011-01-14 |accessdate=2011-02-07 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Martin Seligman|Seligman]] believes positive psychology is "not a luxury", saying "most of Positive Psychology is for all of us, troubled or untroubled, privileged or in privation, suffering or carefree. The pleasures of a good conversation, the strength of gratitude, the benefits of kindness or wisdom or spirituality or humility, the search for meaning and the antidote to "fidgeting until we die" are the birthrights of us all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.authentichappiness.sas.upenn.edu/newsletter.aspx?id=52 |title=Martin P Seligman.

Positive coping is defined as "a response aimed at diminishing the physical, emotional, and psychological burden that is linked to stressful life events and daily hassles"&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 1999 pp. 3-19"&gt;Snyder, C. R., &amp; Dinoff, B. L. (1999). Coping: Where have you been? In C. R. Snyder (Ed.), ''Coping: The psychology of what works'' (pp. 3–19). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is found that proper coping strategies will reduce the burden of short-term stress and will help relieve long-term stress. Stress can be reduced by building resources that inhibit or buffer future challenges. For some people, these effective resources could be physiological, psychological or social.&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 1999 pp. 3-19"/&gt;

=== Terror management ===
[[Terror management theory]] maintains that people suffer [[cognitive dissonance]] (anxiety) when they are reminded of their inevitable death. Through terror management, individuals are motivated to seek consonant elements – symbols which make sense of mortality and death in satisfactory ways (i.e. boosting self-esteem).

Research has found that strong belief in religious ''or'' secular meaning systems affords psychological security and hope. It is moderates (e.g. agnostics, slightly religious individuals) who likely suffer the most anxiety from their meaning systems. Religious meaning systems are especially adapted to manage anxiety about death or dying because they are unlikely to be disconfirmed (for various reasons), they are all encompassing, and they promise literal immortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vail KE, Rothschild ZK, Weise DR, Solomon S, Pyszczynski T, Greenberg J | title = A terror management analysis of the psychological functions of religion | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 84–94 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 19940284 | doi = 10.1177/1088868309351165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://doubtreligion.blogspot.com/2011/03/episode-81-sacrificial-lambs.html|title=Reasonable Doubts: Episode 81 Sacrificial Lambs|author=Fletcher|work=doubtreligion.blogspot.com}}{{self-published inline|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether emotional effects are beneficial or adverse seems to vary with the nature of the belief. Belief in a benevolent God is associated with lower incidence of general anxiety, social anxiety, paranoia, obsession, and compulsion whereas belief in a punitive God is associated with greater symptoms. (An alternative explanation is that people seek out beliefs that fit their psychological and emotional states.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Silton NR, Flannelly KJ, Galek K, Ellison CG | title = Beliefs about God and mental health among American adults | journal = Journal of Religion and Health | volume = 53 | issue = 5 | pages = 1285–96 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 23572240 | doi = 10.1007/s10943-013-9712-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citizens of the world's poorest countries are the most likely to be religious, and researchers suggest this is because of religion's powerful coping abilities.&lt;ref name=GallupE&gt;[http://www.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx Religiosity Highest in World's Poorest Nations], Gallup Global Reports, August 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallup.com/poll/116449/Religion-Provides-Emotional-Boost-World-Poor.aspx Religion Provides Emotional Boost to World’s Poor], Gallup Global Reports, March 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Luke Galen also supports terror management theory as a partial explanation of the above findings.

== Relational factors ==

=== Love and caring ===
The capacity for loving attachments and relationships, especially with parents, is the strongest predictor of well-being later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vaillant|first1=George E. | name-list-format = vanc |authorlink1=George Eman Vaillant|title=Triumphs of Experience|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674067424|page=191|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pPobx78zuj8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA191#v=onepage&amp;q=loving%20relationship&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 April 2017|language=en|date=2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marriage ===
[[Martin Seligman|Seligman]] writes: "Unlike money, which has at most a small effect, marriage is robustly related to happiness... In my opinion, the [[Correlation does not imply causation|jury is still out on what causes]] the proven fact married people are happier than unmarried people." (pp.&amp;nbsp;55–56&lt;ref name="Seligman2002"/&gt;). Married persons report higher levels of happiness and well-being than single people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Orden SR, Bradburn NM |title=Dimensions of Marriage Happiness |journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume=73 |issue=6 |pages=715–731 |date=May 1968 |jstor=2775777 |doi=10.1086/224565}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other data has shown a spouse's happiness depends on the happiness of their partner. When asked, spouses reported similar happiness levels to each other. The data also shows the spouses' happiness level fluctuates similarly to one another. If the husband is having a bad week, the wife will similarly report she had a bad week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoppmann CA, Gerstorf D, Willis SL, Schaie KW | title = Spousal interrelations in happiness in the Seattle Longitudinal Study: considerable similarities in levels and change over time | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–8 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21038942 | pmc = 3133667 | doi = 10.1037/a0020788 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is little data on alternatives like [[polyamory]], although one study stated wife order in polygyny did not have a substantial effect on life or marital satisfaction over all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gwanfogbe PN, Schumm WR, Smith M, Furrow JL |title=Polygyny and marital/life satisfaction: An exploratory study from rural Cameroon |journal=Journal of Comparative Family Studies |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=55–71  |date=January 1997|jstor=41603479}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study also found younger wives were happier than older wives.

On the other hand, at least one large study in Germany found no difference in happiness between married and unmarried people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200303/marriage-is-not-the-key-happiness|title=&lt;/font&gt;Marriage Is Not the Key to Happiness| first = Anne | last = Becker | name-list-format = vanc |work=Psychology Today|date=March 18, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown that married couples are consistently happier and more satisfied with their life than those who are single.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Diener E, Suh EM |year=2000|title=Culture and subjective well-being|location=&lt;/font&gt;Cambridge, MA|publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research findings have indicated that marriage is the only real significant bottom-up predictor of life satisfaction for men and women, and that those people who have a higher life satisfaction prior to marriage, tend to have a happier marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Diener, M., &amp; Diener McGavran, M.

Self-reported satisfaction typically drops as the years of marriage roll on, particularly for couples who have children compared to those who do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/meet-catch-and-keep/201710/defy-the-odds-heres-how-keep-your-relationship-happy|title=Defy the Odds: Here's How to Keep Your Relationship Happy|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for this decline include a drop in affectionate behaviour. One team of researcher from Northwestern University who summarised the literature in 2013, identifies that this trend does not reverse throughout the marital period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/eli-finkel/documents/InPress_FinkelSlotterLuchiesWaltonGross_PSci_000.pdf |title=A Brief Intervention to Promote Conflict Reappraisal Preserves Marital Quality Over Time |website=faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surprisingly, there has been a steady decline in the positive relationship between marriage and well-being in the United States since the 1970s. This decline is due to women reporting being less happy than previously and single men reporting being happier than previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Glenn ND, Weaver CN | year = 1988 | title = The changing relationship of marital status to reported happiness | url = | journal = Journal of Marriage and the Family | volume = 50 | issue = 2| pages = 317–324 | doi=10.2307/351999| jstor = 351999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research does exist, however, suggesting that compared to single people, married people have better physical and psychological health and tend to live longer.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.socec.2005.11.043 |title=Does marriage make people happy, or do happy people get married? |journal=The Journal of Socio-Economics |volume=35 |issue=2 |page=326 |year=2006 |last1=Stutzer |first1=Alois |last2=Frey |first2=Bruno S  | name-list-format = vanc  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With this, a two-factor theory of love was developed by Barnes and Sternberg. This theory is composed of two components: passionate love and companionate love. Passionate love is considered to be an intense longing for a loved one. This love is often experienced through joy and sexual fulfillment, or even through rejection. On the other hand, companionate love is associated with affection, friendship and commitment. Stutzer and Frey (2006) found that the absence of loneliness and the emotional support that promotes self-esteem are both important aspects that contribute to individual well-being within marriage.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Both passionate and companionate love are the foundations for every variety of love that one may experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Barnes ML, Sternberg RJ | year=1997|contribution=A hierarchical model of love and its prediction of satisfaction in close relationships|editors=R.

Because of the expansive research done on the significance of social support within a marriage, it is important to understand that this research was inspired by a theory called the attachment theory perspective. Attachment theory stresses the importance of support and care giving in a relationship for the development of trust and security. Attachment theory, as conceptualized by Collins and Feeney (2000) is an interpersonal, transactional process that involves one partners caregiving responses.&lt;ref name=pmid10870908&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Collins NL, Feeney BC | title = A safe haven: an attachment theory perspective on support seeking and caregiving in intimate relationships | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 78 | issue = 6 | pages = 1053–73 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10870908 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.78.6.1053 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parenthood ===
While the mantle of parenting is sometimes held as the necessary path of adulthood, study findings are actually mixed as to whether parents report higher levels of happiness relative to non-parents. Folk wisdom suggests a child brings partners closer; research has found couples actually become less satisfied after the birth of the first child.&lt;ref name=Twenge03&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2003.00574.x |title=Parenthood and Marital Satisfaction: A Meta-Analytic Review |journal=Journal of Marriage and Family |volume=65 |issue=3 |page=574 |year=2003 |last1=Twenge |first1=Jean M |last2=Campbell |first2=W.

By contrast, parents' self-report levels of happiness are higher than those of non-parents. This may be due to already happy people having more children than unhappy people. In addition, it might also be that, in the long-term, having children gives more meaning to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

By contrast, many studies found having children makes parents less happy.

However, when adults without children are compared to empty nest parents, parenthood is positively associated with emotional well-being.&lt;ref name=Evenson05/&gt; People found parenthood to be more stressful in the 1970s than they did in the 1950s. This is thought to be because of social changes in regards to employment and marital status.&lt;ref name=McLanahan87/&gt;

Males apparently become less happy after the birth of a child due to added economic pressure and taking on the role of being a parent.&lt;ref name=Twenge03/&gt; A conflict between partners can arise when the couple does not desire traditional roles, or has an increasing number of roles.&lt;ref name=Twenge03/&gt; Unequal responsibilities of child-rearing between men and women account for this difference in satisfaction. Fathers who worked and shared an equal part in child-raising responsibilities were found to be the least satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;Ferri, E., Smith, K. (1996). ''Parenting in the 1990s''.

Researchers implemented the Huta &amp; Ryan Scale: Four Eudaimonic Measurement Questionnaire to analyze the participants eudaimonic motives, through motivation towards activities. The investigation was conducted on Canadian university undergraduates. The four eudaimonic pursuits as described by Huta &amp; Ryan are: 
# "Seeking to pursue excellence or a personal ideal" 
# "Seeking to use the best in yourself" 
# "Seeking to develop a skill, learn, or gain insight into something" 
# "Seeking to do what you believe in".&lt;ref name="Huta"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huta|first1=Veronika|title=Huta, Veronika. "Linking Peoples' Pursuit of Eudaimonia and Hedonia with Characteristics of Their Parents: Parenting Styles, Verbally Endorsed Values, and Role Modeling. |journal=Journal of Happiness|date=2011|volume=13|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study determined that participants derived well-being from eudaimonic pursuits only if their parents had role modeled eudaimonia, but not if their parents had merely verbally endorsed eudaimonia.&lt;ref name="Huta"/&gt;

Studies were also conducted on responsiveness and demandingness. The studies participants were American university undergraduates. The terms are described as follows; responsiveness satisfies the basic psychological need for autonomy. This is relevant to eudaimonia because it supports and implements the values of initiative, effort, and persistence, and integration of one's behaviour's values, and true-self. Autonomy is an important psychological factor because it provides the individual with independence. Demandingness cultivates many of the qualities needed for eudaimonia, including structure, self-discipline, responsibility, and vision. Responsiveness and demandingness are reported to be good aspects of parenting. The studies report both of these qualities as important factors to well-being.&lt;ref name="Huta"/&gt;

The study addressed parenting style by assessing and using adaptions of Baumrind's Parent Behaviour Rating Interview. Adaptions of this interview were made into a seventy-five question based survey; participants answered questions organized into fifteen subscales. The study determined that eudaimonically oriented participants reported their parents had been both demanding and responsive towards them. A [[multiple regression]] showed that demandingness and responsiveness together explained as much as twenty-eight percent of the variance in eudaimonia, this suggests parenting played a major role in the development of this pursuit. This supported the expectation that eudaimonia is cultivated when parents encourage internal structure, self-discipline, responsibility, and vision, and simultaneously fulfill a child's needs for autonomy. The research concludes that parents who want their children to experience eudaimonia must firstly themselves "mentor" their children in the approaches to attain eudaimonia. To encourage eudaimonia verbally is not sufficient enough to suffice eudaimonia into adulthood. Parents must clearly role model eudaimonia for it to truly be present in the child's life.&lt;ref name="Seligman_2011"/&gt;

=== Social ties ===
In the article "Finding Happiness after Harvard", [[George Eman Vaillant|George Vaillant]] concluded a study on what aspects of life are important for "successful living". In the 1940s, Arlie Bock, while in charge of the Harvard Health Services, started a study, selecting 268 Harvard students from graduating classes of 1942, '43, and '44. He sought to identify the aspects of life contributing to "successful living". In 1967, the psychiatrist George Vaillant continued the study, undertaking follow-up interviews to gauge the lives of many of the students. In 2000, Vaillant again interviewed these students as to their progress in life. Vaillant observed: health, close relationships, and how participants dealt with their troubles. Vaillant found a key aspect to successful living is healthy and strong relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shenk J |title=Finding happiness After Harvard |journal=Wilson Quarterly |volume=33 |pages=73–74 |date=Autumn 2009 |url=http://www.wilsonquarterly.com/article.cfm?AT=0&amp;AID=1501 |access-date=2017-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027190526/http://www.wilsonquarterly.com/article.cfm?AT=0&amp;AID=1501# |archive-date=2012-10-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A widely publicized study from 2008 in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' reported happiness in [[social network]]s may spread from person to person.&lt;ref name=Fowler08&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fowler JH, Christakis NA | title = Dynamic spread of happiness in a large social network: longitudinal analysis over 20 years in the Framingham Heart Study | journal = BMJ | volume = 337 | issue = 768 | pages = a2338 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19056788 | pmc = 2600606 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.a2338 | author1-link = James H. Fowler }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers followed nearly 5000 individuals for 20 years in the long-standing [[Framingham Heart Study]] and found clusters of happiness and unhappiness that spread up to 3 degrees of separation on average. Happiness tended to spread through close relationships like friends, siblings, spouses, and next-door neighbors; researchers reported happiness spread more consistently than unhappiness through the network. Moreover, the structure of the social network appeared to affect happiness, as people who were very central (with many friends, and friends of friends) were significantly happier than those on the network periphery. People closer with others are more likely to be happy themselves.&lt;ref name=Fowler08/&gt; Overall, the results suggest happiness can spread through a population like a virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/05/health/05happy-web.html|title=Strangers May Cheer You Up, Study Says  |publisher=New York Times|date=December 5, 2008 | first=Pam | last=Belluck | name-list-format = vanc |access-date=2010-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rob Stein,[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/04/AR2008120403537.html "Happiness Can Spread Among People Like a Contagion, Study Indicates,"] ''[[The Washington Post]]'', December 5, 2008, Page A08&lt;/ref&gt; Having a best friend buffers one's negative life experiences.

Neuroeconomist Paul Zak studies morality, oxytocin, and trust, among other variables. Based on research findings, Zak recommends: people hug others more often to get into the habit of feeling trust. He explains "eight hugs a day, you'll be happier, and the world will be a better place".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_zak_trust_morality_and_oxytocin.html|title=Trust, morality -- and oxytocin?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, Anderson et al. found that [[sociometric status]] (the amount of respect one has from face-to-face peer group) is significantly and causally related to happiness as measured by [[subjective well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Anderson C, Kraus MW, Galinsky AD, Keltner D | title = The local-ladder effect: social status and subjective well-being | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 23 | issue = 7 | pages = 764–71 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22653798 | doi = 10.1177/0956797611434537 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Institutional factors ==

=== Education ===

==== Education and intelligence ====
Research suggests neither a good education nor a high IQ reliably increases happiness.&lt;ref name=NYSciHap&gt;{{cite news |last=Wallis |first=Claudia | name-list-format = vanc  | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1015902-1,00.html |title=Science of Happiness: New Research on Mood, Satisfaction |publisher=TIME |date=2005-01-09 |accessdate=2011-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115020515/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C1015902-1%2C00.html |archivedate=2010-11-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Anders Ericsson]] argued an IQ above 120 has a decreasing influence on success. Presumably, IQs above 120 do not additionally cause other happiness indicators like success (with the exception of careers like [[Theoretical physics]], where high IQs are more predictive of success). Above that IQ level, other factors, like social skills and a good mentor, matter more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Making of an Expert

[[Martin Seligman]] has said: "As a professor, I don't like this, but the cerebral virtues—curiosity, love of learning—are less strongly tied to happiness than interpersonal virtues like kindness, gratitude and capacity for love."&lt;ref name=NYSciHap/&gt;

=== Educational goals ===
John White (2013) investigated the educational goals at public schools in Britain. School-education involves both cognitive and conceptual [[learning]], but also the development social skills and personal development. Ideally, children develop self-confidence, and create purpose for themselves. According to White, in the past schools only focused on [[knowledge]] and [[education]] but now [[United Kingdom|Britain]] has moved to a broader direction. White's Every Child Matters initiative seeks to enhance children's well-being across the range of children's services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=John| name-list-format = vanc |title=Education in Well-Being|journal=The Oxford handbook of happiness|pages=540–550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Physical education ====
As a basic building block to a better existence, positive psychology aims to improve the quality of experiences. Within its framework, students could learn to become excited about physical activity. Playing comes natural to children; positive psychology seeks to preserve this zest (a sense of excitement and motivation for life)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.positive-living-now.com/increase-your-happiness-add-some-zest-to-your-life/|title = Increase your happiness: add some zest to your life|date = January 18, 2013|accessdate = April 6, 2015|website = Positive-Living-Now|publisher = |last = Minarik|first = Susan K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; for movement in growing and developing children. If offered in an interesting, challenging and pleasurable way physical activity would thus internalize an authentic feeling of happiness in students. Positive psychology's approach to physical activity could give students the means of acquiring an engaged, pleasant and meaningful life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cherubini|first=Jeffrey| name-list-format = vanc |title=Positive Psychology and Quality Physical Education|journal=Journal of Physical Education, Recreation &amp; Dance|date=September 2009|volume=80|issue=7|pages=42–47, 51|doi=10.1080/07303084.2009.10598356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== School education ====
&lt;!-- I don't object to the addition of this study, but it is not appropriately concise, and should accordingly be drastically cut down. --&gt;
Positive psychology is beneficial to schools and students because it encourages individuals to strive to do their best, whereas scolding has the opposite effect. Clifton and Rath&lt;ref name="Clifton, D 2005, pp. 47-51"&gt;Clifton, D, Rath, T 2005, ‘Every moment matters’, How full is your bucket? Positive strategies for work and life, Gallup Press, New York, pp. 47–51&lt;/ref&gt; discussed research conducted by Dr. Elizabeth Hurlock in 1925, where fourth, fifth and sixth graders were either praised, criticized or ignored, based on their work on math problems. Praised students improved by 71%, those criticized improved by 19%, and students provided with no feedback improved a mere 5%. Praise seems an effective method of fostering improvement.

According to Clifton and Rath&lt;ref name="Clifton, D 2005, pp. 47-51"/&gt; ninety nine out of one hundred people prefer the influence of positive people. The benefits include: increased productivity, and contagious positive emotions, which assists one in working to the best of her, or his, abilities. Even a single negative person can ruin the entire positive vibe in an environment. Clifton and Rath&lt;ref name="Clifton, D 2005, pp. 47-51"/&gt; cited ‘positive emotions as an essential daily requirement for survival’.

In 2008, in conjunction with the Positive Psychology Center at the University of Pennsylvania, a whole-of-school implementation of Positive Psychology was undertaken by Geelong Grammar School (Victoria, Australia). This involved training of teaching staff in the principles and skills of positive psychology. Ongoing support was provided by The Positive Psychology Center staff, who remained in-residence for the entire year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Seligman M, Ernst R, Gillham J, Reivich K, Links M |title=Positive education: positive psychology and classroom interventions |journal=Oxford Review of Education |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=293–311 |year=2009 |doi=10.1080/03054980902934563 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Staats, Hupp and Hagley (2008) used positive psychology to explore academic honesty. They identified positive traits displayed by heroes, then determined if the presence of these traits in students predicted future intent to cheat. The results of their research: ‘an effective working model of heroism in the context of the academic environment’ (Staats, Hupp &amp; Hagley, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Staats S, Hupp JM, Hagley AM | title = Honesty and heroes: a positive psychology view of heroism and academic honesty | journal = The Journal of Psychology | volume = 142 | issue = 4 | pages = 357–72 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18792648 | doi = 10.3200/JRLP.142.4.357-372 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== School grades of children ====
According to a study reported in the ''NY Post'' newspaper, 48% of parents reward their children's good grades with cash or something else of meaning. Among many families in the United States, this is controversial. Although psychology experts support the offer of reward for good behavior as a better alternative than the use of punishment for bad behavior, in some circumstances, families cannot afford to give their children an average of 16 dollars for every good grade earned. Alternatives for money include allowing a child extra time on a computer or staying up later than usual. Some psychology experts believe the best reward is praise and encouragement because material rewards can cause long-term negative effects for children.
 
A study, regarding rewards for children, conducted in 1971 by psychologist, Edward L. Deci, at the University of Rochester, is still referenced today. Featured in the ''New York Times'', it focused on the short- and long-term effects of rewards for positive behavior. Deci suggested rewards for positive behavior is an effective incentive for only a short period. At the outset, rewards can support motivation to work hard and strive towards personal goals. However, once rewards cease, children showed less interest in the task relative to participants who never received rewards. Deci pointed out, at a young age, children's natural instinct is to resist people who try to control their behavior, which he cited as support for his conclusion rewards for good behavior have limited effectiveness.

In contrast, the ''New York Times'' featured research findings that supported the merits of offering rewards to children for good behavior. Expert economists argued children experiencing trouble with their behavior or schoolwork should have numerous helpful options, including rewards. Although children might well experience an initial attraction to financial or material, a love for learning could develop subsequently. Despite the controversy regarding the use of rewards, some experts believe the best way to motivate a child is to offer rewards at the beginning of the school year, but if unsuccessful they recommend teachers and parents stop using the reward system. Because of individual differences among children, no one method will work for everyone. Some children respond well to the use of rewards for positive behavior, while others evidence negative effects. The results seem to depend on the person.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==== Youth development ====
[[Positive Youth Development]] focuses on the promotion of healthy development rather than viewing youth as prone to problems needing to be addressed. This is accomplished through programs and efforts by communities, schools, and government agencies.&lt;ref name="website- Aspe.hhs.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Positive Youth Development in the U.S.: Research Findings on Evaluations of Positive Youth Development Programs|url=http://aspe.hhs.gov/HSP/PositiveYouthDev99/index.htm|accessdate=April 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Work ===
{{Main|Happiness at work}}

It has been argued that [[happiness at work]] is one of the driving forces behind positive outcomes at work, rather than just being a resultant product.&lt;ref name="Boehm &amp; Lyubomirsky 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boehm JK, Lyubomirsky S |title=Does Happiness Promote Career Success? |journal=Journal of Career Assessment |volume=16 |issue=1 |year=2008 |pages=101–16 |doi=10.1177/1069072707308140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a large body of positive [[psychological research]] into the relationship between happiness and productivity,&lt;ref name="test3"&gt;Carr, A.: "Positive Psychology: The Science of Happiness and Human Strengths" Hove, Brunner-Routledge 2004{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="test4"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Isen |first1=A. |chapter=Positive Affect and Decision-making |editor1-first=Michael |editor1-last=Lewis |editor2-first=Jeannette M. |editor2-last=Haviland-Jones | name-list-format = vanc |title=Handbook of Emotions |edition=2nd  |pages=417–36 |location=New York |publisher=Guilford Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-1-57230-529-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid11392858&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Buss DM | title = The evolution of happiness | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 55 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–23 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 11392858 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.55.1.15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; happiness at work has traditionally been seen as a potential by-product of positive outcomes at work, rather than a pathway to success in business. However a growing number of scholars, including Boehm and Lyubomirsky, argue that it should be viewed as one of the major sources of positive outcomes in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Boehm &amp; Lyubomirsky 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid16351326&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lyubomirsky S, King L, Diener E | title = The benefits of frequent positive affect: does happiness lead to success? | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 131 | issue = 6 | pages = 803–55 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16351326 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.131.6.803 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Human Resource Management ====
A practical application of positive psychology is to assist individuals and organizations in identifying strengths so as to increase and sustain well-being. Therapists, counselors, coaches, various psychological professionals, HR departments, business strategists, and others, are using new methods and techniques to broaden and build upon the strengths of a wide population of individuals. This includes those not suffering from mental illness or disorder. &lt;!-- The phrase "broaden and build" is a reference to the prominent positive psychology theory of Barbara Fredrickson. --&gt;

==== Workplace ====
{{main|Positive psychology in the workplace}}
Positive psychology has been implemented in business management practice, but has faced challenges. Wong &amp; Davey (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.regent.edu/acad/global/publications/sl_proceedings/2007/wong-davey.pdf |title=Wong &amp; Davey (2007) |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted managers can introduce positive psychology to a workplace, but they might struggle with positive ways to apply it to employees. Furthermore, for employees to welcome and commit to positive psychology, its application within an organization must be transparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=P. Alex |last1=Linley |first2=Susan |last2=Harrington  | name-list-format = vanc  |title=Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology and Work |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JR51T4KHf3AC&amp;pg=PA327 |year=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-533544-6 |page=327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Managers must also understand the implementation of positive psychology will not necessarily combat any commitment challenges that exist.

Lyubomirsky et al. report: "Study after study shows that happiness precedes important outcomes and indicators of thriving, including fulfilling and productive work".

Positive psychology, when applied correctly, can provide employees with a greater opportunity to use skills and vary work duties.

Can an organization implement positive change? Lewis et al. (2007) developed [[appreciative inquiry]] (AI), which is an integrated, organizational-level methodology for approaching [[organizational development]]. Appreciative inquiry is based on the generation of organizational resourcefulness, which is accomplished by accessing a variety of human psychological processes, such as: positive emotional states, imagination, social cohesion, and the social construction of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lewis S, Passmore J, Cantore S |title=Positive psychology and managing change |journal=The Psychologist |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=932–4 |year=2008 |doi= |url=http://www.mendeley.com/research/positive-psychology-managing-change/#}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A relatively new practice in the workplace is recruiting and developing people based on their strengths (what they love to do, are naturally good at and energises them). Standard Chartered Bank pioneered this approach in the early 2000s. More and more organisations are realising the benefit of recruiting people who are in their element in the job as opposed to simply having the right competencies for the job. Aviva, Morrisons (a large UK supermarket) and Starbucks have all adopted this approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://engagingminds.co.uk/sbr/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/How-strengths-based-recruitment-transforms-organisations.pdf|title=How Strengths-based Recruitment Transforms Organisations|work=engagingminds.co.uk|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Howard Gardner]] has extensively researched the merit of undertaking good work at one's job. He suggested young generations (particularly in the United States) are taught to focus on the selfish pursuit of money for its own sake, although having money does not engender happiness, and psychological studies show that there is a strong correlation between the wealthy and experience of intensively negative emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.webmd.com/balance/news/20060630/study-money-wont-make-you-happy|title=Study: Money Won't Make You Happy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner's proposed alternatives loosely follow the pleasant/good/meaningful life classifications outlined above; he believes young people should be trained to pursue excellence in their field, as well as engagement (see flow, above) in accordance with their moral belief systems.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Gardner, TVOpodcast ''Excellence in education'', http://www.tvo.org/TVOsites/WebObjects/TvoMicrosite.woa?bi?1260050400000&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criminology ===

==== Offender rehabilitation ====
Traditional work with offenders has focused on their deficits (e.g., with respect to socialization, and schooling) and other "criminogenic" risk-factors. Rehabilitation more often than not has taken the form of forced treatment or training, ostensibly for the good of the offender, and the community. Arguably, this approach has shortcomings, suggesting a need to make available additional positive options to treatment staff so they can best assist offenders, and so that offenders can better find their way forward. Positive psychology has made recent inroads with the advent of the "Good Lives Model", developed by Tony Ward, Shadd Maruna, and others. With respect to rehabilitation: "Individuals take part ... because they think that such activities might either improve the quality of their life (an intrinsic goal) or at least look good to judges, parole boards and family members (an extrinsic goal)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Tony | last1 = Ward | first2 = Shadd | last2 = Maruna  | name-list-format = vanc |title=Rehabilitation|location=London, New York|publisher=Routledge |year=2007|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Positive criminology and positive victimology ====
[[Positive criminology]] and positive victimology are conceptual approaches, developed by the Israeli criminologist Natti Ronel and his research team, that follow principles of positive psychology and apply them into the fields of criminology and victimology, respectively. Positive criminology and victimology both place an emphasis on social inclusion and on unifying and integrating forces at individual, group, social and spiritual levels that are associated with the limiting of crime and recovery from victimization. In traditional approaches the study of crime, violence and related behaviors emphasizes the negative aspects in people's lives that are associated with deviance, criminality and victimization. A common understanding is that human relationships are affected more by destructive encounters than by constructive or positive ones. Positive criminology and victimology argue that a different approach is viable, based on three dimensions – social integration, emotional healing and spirituality – that constitute positive direction indicators.

=== Economics ===
{{merge|Happiness_economics|discuss=Talk:Happiness_economics#Merger proposal|date=April 2018}}
In [[economics]], the term well-being is used for one or more [[Numerical data|quantitative]] measures intended to assess the [[quality of life]] of a group, for example, in the [[capabilities approach]] and the [[Happiness economics|economics of happiness]]. As with the related [[cognate]] terms '[[wealth]]' and 'welfare', economics sources often contrast the state with its opposite.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Economic Literature'' [[JEL classification codes#Health, education, and welfare JEL: I Subcategories|Health, education, and welfare JEL: I Subcategories]] at JEL: I3 - Welfare and Poverty.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Smith]], 1776.

=== Political views ===
Psychologists in the happiness community feel politics should promote population happiness. Politics should also consider level of human happiness among future generations, concern itself with life expectancy, and focus on the reduction of suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brülde B |title=Happiness, Morality, and Politics |journal=Journal of Happiness Studies |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=567–583 |date=October 2010 |doi=10.1007/s10902-010-9207-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on political affiliation, some studies argue conservatives, on average, are happier than liberals.

== Environmental factors ==
Living in an environment with more green spaces is associated with higher well-being, partly due to the beneficial effects on psychological relaxation, stress alleviation, increased physical activity, and reduced exposure to air pollutants and noise, among others.&lt;ref name= who&gt;{{cite journal |author=Egorov et al.| year = 2016 | title = Urban green spaces and health: A review of the evidence| journal = World Health Organization  | url = http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/321971/Urban-green-spaces-and-health-review-evidence.pdf?ua=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= BosGr&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bos EH, van der Meulen L, Wichers M, Jeronimus BF | title = A Primrose Path?

== Cultural factors ==
{{main|Culture and positive psychology}}

=== Culture ===
People base their own well-being in relation to their environment and the lives of others around them. Well-being is also subject to how one feels other people in their environment perceive them, whether that positively or negatively. Whether or not other cultures are subject to internal culture appraisal is based on that culture's type. According to Diener and Suh,
{{quote|[[Collectivistic]] cultures are more likely to use norms and the social appraisals of others in evaluating their subjective well-being, whereas those [individualistic] societies are more likely to heavily weight the internal [frame of reference] arising from one’s own happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diener|first1=Ed|last2=Suh|first2=Eunkook M. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Culture and subjective well-being|date=2003|publisher=MIT|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=978-0-262-54146-6|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Different views on well-being ===
Various cultures have various perspectives on the nature of positive human functioning. For example, studies on [[aversion to happiness]], or fear of happiness, indicates that some individuals and cultures are averse to the experience of happiness, because they believe happiness may cause bad things to happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joshanloo|first1=Mohsen|last2=Weijers|first2=Dan | name-list-format = vanc |title=Aversion to Happiness Across Cultures: A Review of Where and Why People are Averse to Happiness|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|date=15 December 2013|volume=15|issue=3|pages=717–735|doi=10.1007/s10902-013-9489-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical evidence indicates that there are fundamental differences in the ways well-being is construed in Western and non-Western cultures, including the Islamic and East Asian cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joshanloo|first1=Mohsen|title=A Comparison of Western and Islamic Conceptions of Happiness|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|date=15 December 2012|volume=14|issue=6|pages=1857–1874|doi=10.1007/s10902-012-9406-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exploring various cultural perspectives on well-being, Joshanloo (2014) identifies and discusses six broad differences between Western and non-Western conceptions of well-being. For example, whereas Western cultures tend to emphasize the absence of negative emotions and autonomy in defining well-being, Eastern cultures tend to emphasize virtuous or religious activity, self-transcendence, and harmony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joshanloo|first1=Mohsen|title=Eastern Conceptualizations of Happiness: Fundamental Differences with Western Views|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|date=21 March 2013|volume=15|issue=2|pages=475–493|doi=10.1007/s10902-013-9431-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eunkook M. Suh (University of California) and Shigehiro Oishi (University of Minnesota; now at University of Virginia) examined the differences of happiness on an international level and different cultures' views on what creates well-being and happiness. In a study, of over 6,000 students from 43 nations, to identify mean life satisfaction, on a scale of 1–7, the Chinese ranked lowest at 3.3; and Dutch scored the highest at 5.4. When asked how much subjective well-being was ideal, Chinese ranked lowest at 4.5, and Brazilians highest at 6.2, on a scale of 1–7. The study had three main findings: (1) People living in individualistic, rather than collectivist, societies are happier; (2) Psychological attributes referencing the individual are more relevant to Westerners; (3) Self-evaluating happiness levels depend on different cues, and experiences, from one's culture.&lt;ref name="free-books-online.org"&gt;{{cite web| vauthors = Eunkook S |year=2002|title=Subjective Well-Being Across Cultures|accessdate= November 23, 2012|url=http://free-books-online.org/psychology/cross-cultural-psychology/subjective-well-being-across-cultures/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408081703/http://free-books-online.org/psychology/cross-cultural-psychology/subjective-well-being-across-cultures/|archivedate=April 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of a study by Chang E. C. showed that Asian Americans and Caucasian Americans have similar levels of optimism but Asian Americans are far more pessimistic than Caucasian Americans. However, there were no major differences in depression across cultures. On the other hand, pessimism was positively linked to [[problem solving]] behaviors for Asian Americans, but was negatively linked for Caucasian Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Lopez SJ, Snyder CR | title = The Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2009 | page = 53 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion and spirituality ===
Religiousness and spirituality are closely related but distinct topics. [[Religion]] is any organized, and often [[Institutionalisation|institutionalized]], system of cultural practices and beliefs pertaining to the meaning of human existence. It occurs within a traditional context such as a formal religious institution.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;[[Raymond Paloutzian|Paloutzian, R. F.]], &amp; Park, C. L. (Eds.). (2005). Handbook of the psychology of religion and spirituality. New York, NY, US: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spirituality]], on the other hand, is a general term applied to the process of finding meaning and a better understanding of one's place in the universe. It is the individual or collective search for that which is sacred or meaningful in life.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = George LK, Larson DB, Koenig HG, McCullough ME | year = 2000 | title = Spirituality and health: What we know, what we need to know | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 102–116 | doi=10.1521/jscp.2000.19.1.102}}&lt;/ref&gt; One may therefore be religious but not spiritual, and vice versa.

==== Religion ====
{{see also|Psychology of religion|}}

There have been some studies of how [[Religion and happiness|religion relates to happiness]]. Causal relationships remain unclear, but more religion is seen in happier people. Consistent with PERMA, religion may provide a sense of meaning and connection to something bigger, beyond the self. Religion may also provide community membership and hence relationships. Another component may have to do with ritual.&lt;ref&gt;2009 article in Frontiers in Evolutionary Neuroscience{{full citation needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religion and happiness have been studied by a number of researchers, and [[religion]] features many elements addressing the components of happiness, as identified by [[positive psychology]]. Its association with happiness is facilitated in part by the social connections of organized religion,&lt;ref name=Routledge2012&gt;{{cite web | title = Are Religious People Happier Than Non-religious People?

There are a number of mechanisms through which religion may make a person happier, including social contact and support that result from religious pursuits, the mental activity that comes with optimism and volunteering, learned coping strategies that enhance one's ability to deal with stress, and psychological factors such as "reason for being." It may also be that religious people engage in behaviors related to good health, such as less [[substance abuse]], since the use of psychotropic substances is sometimes considered abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baetz M, Toews J | title = Clinical implications of research on religion, spirituality, and mental health | journal = Canadian Journal of Psychiatry.

The ''[[Handbook of Religion and Health]]'' describes a survey by Feigelman (1992) that examined happiness in Americans who have given up religion, in which it was found that there was little relationship between religious disaffiliation and unhappiness.&lt;ref&gt;Koenig. Harold G., Larson, David B., and Mcculloug, Michael E. – ''[[Handbook of Religion and Health]]'' (see [[Handbook of Religion and Health|article]]), p. 122, Oxford University Press (2001), {{ISBN|0-8133-6719-0}}&lt;br /&gt;Feigelman et al. (1992) examined happiness in Americans who have given up religion. Using pooled data from the General Social Surveys conducted between 1972 and 1990, investigators identified more than 20,000 adults for their study. Subjects of particular interest were “disaffiliates”—those who were affiliated with a religion at age 16 but who were not affiliated at the time of the survey (disaffiliates comprised from 4.4% to 6.0% of respondents per year during the 18 years of surveys). “Actives” were defined as persons who reported a religious affiliation at age 16 and a religious affiliation at the time of the survey (these ranged from 84.7% to 79.5% of respondents per year between 1972 and 1990). Happiness was measured by a single question that assessed general happiness (very happy, pretty happy, not too happy). When disaffiliates (n = 1,420) were compared with actives (n = 21,052), 23.9% of disaffiliates indicated they were “very happy, ” as did 34.2% of actives. When the analysis was stratified by marital status, the likelihood of being very happy was about 25% lower (i.e., 10% difference) for married religious disaffiliates compared with married actives. Multiple regression analysis revealed that religious disaffiliation explained only 2% of the variance in overall happiness, after marital status and other covariates were controlled. Investigators concluded that there was little relationship between religious disaffiliation and unhappiness (quality rating 7)&lt;/ref&gt; A survey by Kosmin &amp; Lachman (1993), also cited in this handbook, indicates that people with no religious affiliation appear to be at greater risk for depressive symptoms than those affiliated with a religion.&lt;ref&gt;Koenig. Harold G., Larson, David B., and Mcculloug, Michael E. – ''[[Handbook of Religion and Health]]''(see [[Handbook of Religion and Health|article]]), p. 111, Oxford University Press (2001)&lt;br /&gt;Currently, approximately 8% of the U.S. population claim no religious affiliation (Kosmin &amp; Lachman, 1993). People with no affiliation appear to be at greater risk for depressive symptoms than those affiliated with a religion. In a sample of 850 medically ill men, Koenig, Cohen, Blazer, Pieper, et al. (1992) examined whether religious affiliation predicted depression after demographics, medical status, and a measure of religious coping were controlled. They found that, when relevant covariates were controlled, men who indicated that they had "no religious affiliation" had higher scores on the [[Hamilton Depression Rating Scale]] (an observer-administered rating scale) than did men who identified themselves as moderate Protestants, Catholics, or nontraditional Christians.&lt;/ref&gt; A review of studies by 147 independent investigators found, "the correlation between religiousness and depressive symptoms was -.096, indicating that greater religiousness is mildly associated with fewer symptoms."&lt;ref name=PsyB129 /&gt;

The [[Legatum Prosperity Index]] reflects the repeated finding of research on the science of happiness that there is a positive link between religious engagement and well-being: people who report that God is very important in their lives are on average more satisfied with their lives, after accounting for their income, age and other individual characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;The 2008 Legatum Prosperity Index, Summary p. 40.&lt;br&gt; Research suggests that religious people's happiness is less vulnerable to fluctuations in economic and political uncertainty, personal unemployment and income changes. The Prosperity Index identifies similar effects at the country level, with a number of highly religious countries reporting higher levels of happiness than might be expected based on the standard of living alone: this effect is most pronounced in Mexico, El Salvador, the Dominican republic, Indonesia, Venezuela and Nigeria.&lt;/ref&gt;

Surveys by [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]], the [[National Opinion Research Centre]] and the [[Pew Research Center|Pew Organisation]] conclude that spiritually committed people are twice as likely to report being "very happy" than the least religiously committed people.&lt;ref&gt;[[Is Religion Dangerous?]]p156, citing [[David Myers (academic)|David Myers]] ''The Science of Subjective Well-Being'' Guilford Press 2007&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of over 200 social studies contends that "high religiousness predicts a lower risk of depression and drug abuse and fewer suicide attempts, and more reports of satisfaction with sex life and a sense of well-being.
However, the links between religion and happiness are always very broad in nature, highly reliant on scripture and small sample number.

However, there remains strong disagreement among scholars about whether the effects of religious observance, particularly attending church or otherwise belonging to religious groups, is due to the spiritual or the social aspects—i.e. those who attend church or belong to similar religious organizations may well be receiving only the effects of the social connections involved. While these benefits are real enough, they may thus be the same one would gain by joining other, secular groups, clubs, or similar organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert D. Putnam]] makes this argument in his book (with David Campell) ''American Grace'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, 2012).{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religiousness has often been found to correlate with positive health attributes. People who are more religious show better emotional well-being and lower rates of delinquency, alcoholism, drug abuse, and other social problems.&lt;ref name = "Donahue_1995"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Donahue MJ, Benson PL | year = 1995 | title = Religion and the well-being of adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Social Issues | volume = 51 | issue = 2| pages = 145–160 | doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1995.tb01328.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six separate factors are cited as evidence for religion's effect on well-being: religion (1) provides social support, (2) supports healthy lifestyles, (3) promotes personality integration, (4) promotes generativity and altruism, (5) provides unique coping strategies, and (6) provides a sense of meaning and purpose.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Emmons, R. A. (1999) ''The psychology of ultimate concerns: Motivation and spirituality in personality.'' New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt; Many religious individuals experience emotions that create positive connections among people and allow them to express their values and potential. These four emotions are known as "sacred emotions," which are said to be (1) gratitude and appreciation, (2) forgiveness, (3) compassion and empathy, and (4) humility.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Emmons, R. A., (2005). Emotion and Religion. In: Handbook of the psychology of religion and spirituality. Paloutzian, Raymond F. (Ed), Park, Crystal L. (Ed), New York, NY, US: Guilford Press, 2005. pp. 235–252.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social interaction is necessarily a part of the religious experience. Religiosity has been identified to correlate positively with prosocial behavior in trauma patients, and prosocial behavior is furthermore associated with well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=2012-03828-001|title = The relation between trauma exposure and prosocial behavior.|last = Frazier|first = Patricia | name-list-format = vanc |date = May 2013|journal = Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has stronger associations with well-being in individuals genetically predisposed towards social sensitivity in environments where religion prioritizes social affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Religion and Well-being The Moderating Role of Culture and the Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR) Gene|url = http://jcc.sagepub.com/content/42/8/1394|journal = Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|date = 2011-11-01|access-date = 2015-04-12|issn = 0022-0221|pages = 1394–1405|volume = 42|issue = 8|doi = 10.1177/0022022111412526|first = Joni Y.|last = Sasaki|first2 = Heejung S.|last2 = Kim|first3 = Jun|last3 = Xu | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been linked to greater resilience against stress&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://hdl.handle.net/1805/14103|title = Religiosity and Spirituality as Resiliency Resources: Moderation, Mediation, or Moderated Mediation?|last1 = Reuter|first1 = Kirby K.|last2 = Bigatti|first2 = Silvia M. | name-list-format = vanc |date = March 2014|journal = Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|doi = 10.1111/jssr.12081| hdl = 1805/14103|pmid = |volume=53 |pages=56–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as higher measures of self-actualization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Graff RW, Ladd CE | title = POI correlates of a religious commitment inventory | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 502–4 | date = October 1971 | pmid = 5115658 | doi = 10.1002/1097-4679(197110)27:4&lt;502::AID-JCLP2270270431&gt;3.0.CO;2-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and success in romantic relationships and parental responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Religion or spirituality has positive impact on romantic/marital relationships, child development, research shows|url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/12/141208105320.htm|access-date = 2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These benefits, while being correlational, may come about as a result of becoming more religiously involved. The benefit of having a secure social group likely plays a key part in religion's positive effects. One form of Christian counseling uses religion through talk therapy and assessments to promote mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/1268720312?accountid=14816|title = Clinical Appraisal of Spirituality: In Search of Rapid Assessment Instruments (RAIs) for Christian Counseling|last = Greggo|first = Stephen P | name-list-format = vanc |date = 2012|journal = Journal of Psychology and Christianity|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another instance, people who were not Buddhist, but were exposed to Buddhist concepts, scored higher on measures of outgroup acceptance and prosociality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Study finds being exposed to Buddhist concepts reduces prejudice and increases prosociality – The Mirror Post|url = http://www.themirrorpost.com/2015/04/study-finds-being-exposed-to-buddhist.html|website = www.themirrorpost.com|accessdate = 2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect was found not only in Western countries, but also in places where Buddhism is prevalent, indicating a general association of Buddhism with acceptance. This finding seems to indicate that merely encountering a religious belief system such as Buddhism may allow some of its effects to be transferred to nonbelievers.

However, many disagree that the benefits the religious experience are due to their beliefs, and some find there to be no conclusive psychological benefits of belief at all. For example, the health benefit that the elderly gain from going to church may in fact be the'' ''reason they are able to go to church; the less healthy cannot leave their homes. Meta analysis has found that find studies purporting the beneficial results of religiosity often fail to fully represent data correctly due to a number of issues such as self-report bias, the use of inappropriate comparison groups, and the presence of criterion contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Does religious belief promote prosociality?

They have shown that, when scientifically rigorous studies are performed (by randomizing the patients and preventing them from knowing that they are being prayed for), there is no discernible effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Are there demonstrable effects of distant intercessory prayer?

Religion has power as a cohesive social force, and whether or not it is always beneficial is debated. Irrespective of a group's beliefs, many find that simply belonging to a tight social group reduces anxiety and mental health problems. In addition, there may be a degree of self-selectivity amongst the religious; the behavioral benefits they display may simply be common aspects of those who choose to or are able to practice religion. As a result, whether or not religion can be prescribed scientifically as a means of self-betterment is unclear.

==== Spirituality ====
While religion is often formalised and community-oriented, [[spirituality]] tends to be individually based and not as formalised. In a 2014 study, 320 children, ages 8–12, in both public and private schools, were given a Spiritual Well-Being Questionnaire assessing the correlation between spirituality and happiness. Spirituality – and not religious practices (praying, attending church services) – correlated positively with the child's happiness; the more spiritual the child was, the happier the child was. Spirituality accounted for about 3–26% of the variance in happiness.&lt;ref name = "Holder_2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holder |first1=Mark D. |last2=Coleman |first2=Ben |last3=Wallace |first3=Judi M. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Spirituality, Religiousness, and Happiness in Children Aged 8–12 Years |journal=Journal of Happiness Studies |volume=11 |issue=2 |year=2008 |pages=131–50 |doi=10.1007/s10902-008-9126-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meditation has been found to lead to high activity in the brain's left prefrontal cortex, which in turn has been found to correlate with happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shontell|first1=Alyson|title=A 69-year-old monk who scientists call the 'world's happiest man' says the secret to being happy takes just 15 minutes a day|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-be-happier-according-to-matthieu-ricard-the-worlds-happiest-man-2016-1|website=Business Insider|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study using the Oxford happiness questionnaire on Brahma Kumaris [[Raja yoga]] meditators showed them having higher happiness than the control group.&lt;ref name=pmid24298493/&gt; [[Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche]] has said that neuro scientists have found that with meditation, an individual's happiness baseline can change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/science-has-proved-that-meditation-can-improve-quality-of-life-buddhist-master/articleshow/58200304.cms|title=Science has proved that meditation can improve quality of life: Buddhist master|work=Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people describe themselves as both religious and spiritual, but [[spirituality]] represents just one particular function of religion. Spirituality as related to positive psychology can be defined as "a search for the sacred".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pargament KI | year = 1999 | title = The psychology of religion and spirituality? Yes and no. | url = | journal = International Journal for the Psychology of Religion | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 3–16 | doi=10.1207/s15327582ijpr0901_2}}&lt;/ref&gt; What is defined as sacred can be related to God, life itself, or almost any other facet of existence. It simply must be viewed as having spiritual implications which are transcendent of the individual.&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 2002"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Snyder, C. R., Lopez, Shane|year=2002|title=Handbook of Positive Psychology|location= New York|publisher= Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spiritual well-being addresses this human need for [[Self-transcendence|transcendence]] and involves social as well as existential well-being. Spiritual [[well-being]] is associated with various positive outcomes such as better physical and psychological well-being, lower anxiety, less depression, [[self-actualization]], positive relationships with parents, higher rates of positive personality traits and acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=James M. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Psychology, Religion, and Spirituality|date=2009|publisher=Springer Science + Business Media, LLC|location=New York|page=359}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have cautioned to differentiate between correlative and causal associations between spirituality and psychology.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schuurmans-Stekhoven | first1 = James | year = 2011 | title = Is it God or just the data that moves in mysterious ways?

Reaching the sacred as a personal goal, also called spiritual striving, has been found to correlate highest with well-being compared to other forms of striving.&lt;ref name=jstor27522349/&gt; This type of striving can improve a sense of self and relationships and creates a connection to the transcendent&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 2002"/&gt; Additionally, multiple studies have shown that self-reported spirituality is related to lower rates of mortality and depression and higher rates of happiness.&lt;ref name = "Holder_2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fehring RJ, Miller JF, Shaw C | title = Spiritual well-being, religiosity, hope, depression, and other mood states in elderly people coping with cancer | journal = Oncology Nursing Forum | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 663–71 | date = May 1997 | pmid = 9159782 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Strawbridge WJ, Cohen RD, Shema SJ, Kaplan GA | title = Frequent attendance at religious services and mortality over 28 years | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 87 | issue = 6 | pages = 957–61 | date = June 1997 | pmid = 9224176 | pmc = 1380930 | doi = 10.2105/ajph.87.6.957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, most research on spirituality examines ways in which spirituality can help in times of crisis. Spirituality has been found to remain constant when experiencing traumatic events and/or life stressors such as accidents, war, sickness, and death of a loved one. When confronted with an obstacle, people might turn to prayer or meditation. [[Coping (psychology)|Coping]] mechanisms involving spirituality include meditative meditation, creating boundaries to preserve the sacred, spiritual purification to return to the righteous path, and spiritual reframing which focuses on maintaining belief. One clinical application of spirituality and positive psychology research is the "psychospiritual intervention," which represents the potential that spirituality has to increase well-being.&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 2002" /&gt; These coping mechanisms that aim to preserve the sacred have been found by researchers to increase well-being and return the individual back to the sacred.&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 2002"/&gt;

Overall, spirituality is a process that occurs over a lifetime and includes searching, conserving, and redefining what is sacred in an extremely individualized manner. It does not always have a positive effect and in fact has been associated with very negative events and life changes. Research is lacking in spirituality but it is necessary because spirituality can assist in enhancing the experiences of the uncontrollable parts of life.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

== Other factors ==

=== Modernity ===
Much research has pointed at the rising rates of depression, leading people to speculate that modernization may be a factor in the growing percentage of depressed people. One study found that women in urban America were much more likely to experience depression than those in rural Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Colla J, Buka S, Harrington D, Murphy JM | title = Depression and modernization: a cross-cultural study of women | journal = Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology | volume = 41 | issue = 4 | pages = 271–9 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16520885 | doi = 10.1007/s00127-006-0032-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have found a positive correlation between a country's GDP per capita, as quantitative measure of modernization, and lifetime risk of a mood disorder trended toward significance (p=0.06).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hidaka BH | title = Depression as a disease of modernity: explanations for increasing prevalence | journal = Journal of Affective Disorders | volume = 140 | issue = 3 | pages = 205–14 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 22244375 | pmc = 3330161 | doi = 10.1016/j.jad.2011.12.036 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people believe it is the increased number of pressures and expectations, increased isolation, increased individualism, and increased inactivity that contribute to higher rates of depression in modern societies.

=== Weather ===
Some evidence suggests sunnier climates do not predict happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lucas RE, Lawless NM | title = Does life seem better on a sunny day?

That is not to say weather is never a factor for happiness. Perhaps the changing norms of sunlight cause [[seasonal affective disorder]], which undermines level of happiness.

== Additional future research ==
Positive psychology research and practice is currently conducted and developed in various countries throughout the world. To illustrate, in Canada, Charles Hackney of Briercrest College applies positive psychology to the topic of personal growth through martial arts training; [[Paul T. P. Wong|Paul Wong]], president of the International Network on Personal Meaning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meaning.ca/ |title=International Network on Personal Meaning and Meaning of Life |publisher=Meaning.ca |date=1999-03-15 |accessdate=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; is developing an existential approach to positive psychology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Wong PT | year = 2009 | chapter = Existential positive psychology | veditors = Lopez SJ | title = Encyclopedia of positive psychology | volume = 1 | pages = 361–368 | location = Oxford, UK | publisher = Wiley Blackwell }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Wong PT, Ivtzan I, Lomas T | year = 2016 | chapter = Good work: A meaning-centred approach | veditors = Oades LG, Steger MF, Fave AD, Passmore J | title = The Wiley Blackwell handbook of the psychology of positivity and strengths-based approaches at work | location = West Sussex, UK | publisher = Wiley Blackwell }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is framed in the [[second wave positive psychology]] (PP 2.0).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wong PT | year = 2011 | title = Positive psychology 2.0: Towards a balanced interactive model of the good life | url = | journal = Canadian Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 2| pages = 69–81 | doi = 10.1037/a002251 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Ivtzan I, Lomas T, Hefferon K, Worth P | year = 2015 | title = Second wave positive psychology: Embracing the dark side of life. | location = London, UK | publisher = Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Mention MAPP program in England, school based on positive psychology in Australia, etc.--&gt;

The research program ‘Understanding Positive Emotions’ at Human Science Lab, [[London]], investigates how material [[well-being]] and [[perceptual]] well-being work as relative determinants in conditioning our [[mind]] for positive emotions.&lt;ref name="Understanding Positive Emotions"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://humansciencelab.org.uk| title=Understanding Positive Emotions |publisher=Human Science Lab | access-date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive and behavioral change, although sometimes slight and complex, can produce an 'intense affect'.

Isen (2009) remarked that further progress requires suitable research methods, and appropriate theories on which to base contemporary research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Isen AM |year=2009|contribution=Positive Affect as a Source of Human Strength| veditors = Snyder CR, Lopez SJ |title=Handbook of positive psychology|pages=179–195|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chang (2008) suggested that researchers have a number of paths to pursue regarding the enhancement of emotional intelligence, even though emotional intelligence does not guarantee the development of positive affect; in short, more study is required to track the gradient of positive affect in psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Chang KB | year=2008|chapter=Can We Improve Emotional Intelligence|title=Emotional Intelligence; Perspectives on Educational and Positive Psychology|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing Inc.|location= New York|pages=25–45|isbn=9781433101960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wickedness''' is generally considered a synonym for [[evil]] or [[sin]]fulness.  Among theologians and philosophers, it has the [[Technical terminology|more specific meaning]] of evil committed [[Consciousness#In philosophy|consciously]] and of [[free will]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first= Ron |last= Rosenbaum |authorlink= Ron Rosenbaum | url= http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/the_spectator/2011/09/does_evil_exist_neuroscientists_say_no_.single.html | title= The End of Evil? | date= September 30, 2011 | publisher= [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] | accessdate= 2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be considered the quality or state of being wicked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wickedness|title=Definition of WICKEDNESS|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term wickedness dates back to the 1300s and is derived from the words ''wicked'' and ''-ness''. Wicked is an extended form of the term wick meaning bad and is also associated with the Old English term ''wicca'' meaning wizard. There isn’t a corresponding verb to the term, but the term wretched is also associated with the term. The term -ness is a word forming element denoting action, quality or state and is typically added to an adjective or past participle to make it an abstract noun. It is an Old English term and also comes from the Proto-Germanic term ''in-assu'' and many other cognates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=wickedness|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As characterized by [[Martin Buber]] in his 1952 work ''Bilder von Gut und Böse'' (translated as ''Good and Evil: Two Interpretations''),&lt;!-- this is a quote of the characterization as opposed to a translation --&gt; "The first stage of evil is '[[sin]],' occasional [[wikt:directionlessness|directionlessness]]. Endless possibility can be overwhelming, leading man to grasp at anything, distracting and busying himself, in order to not have to make a real, committed choice. The second stage of evil is 'wickedness,' when caprice is embraced as a deformed substitute for [[will (philosophy)|genuine will]] and becomes characteristic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first= Sarah |last= Scott| work= [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] | url= http://www.iep.utm.edu/buber/#SH2e | title= Martin Buber (1878—1965) | date= July 9, 2010 | publisher= [[University of Tennessee at Martin]] | issn= 2161-0002 &lt;!-- sic --&gt;| accessdate= 2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wickedness [[connotation|connotes]] [[wikt:blameworthiness|blameworthiness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first= Garrath |last= Williams | work= [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] | url= http://www.iep.utm.edu/responsi/#H3 | title= Responsibility | date= March 9, 2009 | publisher= [[University of Tennessee at Martin]] | issn= 2161-0002 &lt;!-- sic --&gt;| accessdate= 2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wickedness and Power==
Throughout history power is typically seen to be a very dangerous and destructive element in people’s lives. It’s a canker to society or is wicked if you will. Some theorists believe that power itself is actually in fact morally neutral. It is the results of power that determine whether or not power is seen as good. The people in power are then also seen as not wicked in their nature, but rather the urgency for power and within the nature of it is what makes power seen as a wicked idea. Theorists believe that if men were the wicked ones in the equation then the solution to the issues at stake would be ethical improvement. In the end, it isn’t power or man that are wicked, but the results of power that cause it to be wicked.&lt;ref&gt;French, A. (1980). Thucydides and the Power Syndrome. Greece &amp; Rome, 27(1), 22-30. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://mccclib.mccc.edu:2112/stable/642773&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==What Causes Someone to be Wicked==
There are two different types of wickedness that some people will argue. There is natural wickedness. This is the type of wickedness that is unpreventable such as earthquakes, tornadoes and other types of natural disasters. The second type of wickedness is moral wickedness. This type of wickedness is types of evil that are acted out by humans and can arguably be preventable. What causes the separation between the two is the response to both types of wickedness. During a natural disaster people tend to be sympathetic to the victims of the destruction. It’s this sympathy to the victims that classifies a natural disaster as a form of wickedness. In contrast, to moral wickedness where people will be sympathetic to the victim of the person who committed the wicked behavior. This distinguishes the person who committed the act as a wicked being. It is based on the modern consciousness of society that determines whether the act is considered wicked.&lt;ref&gt;Billias, Nancy (2010) Promoting and Producing Evil. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://mccclib.mccc.edu:2094/lib/mccc/detail.action?docID=10447250&amp;p00=%22promoting+and+producing+evil%22&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heavy Metal and Wickedness==
Heavy Metal is a genre of music with lyrics that are dark and people consider to be satanic. It was introduced on Friday the 13th in February 1970 when Black Sabbath released Black Sabbath. Around this time period the Vietnam War was going on, the deaths of Martin Luther King Jr. and John F. Kennedy occurred, the death of Flower Power and the second Cold War was coming into play. These events influenced the lyrics of the songs that are considered heavy metal. While it may seem evil or a form of protest it is really up to interpretation over whether or not Heavy Metal is considered wicked and connected to the devil.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Balmain, Collette. Drawmer, Lois (2009) Something Wicked This Way Comes. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://mccclib.mccc.edu:2094/lib/mccc/detail.action?docID=10380355&amp;p00=%22something+wicked+this+way+comes%22&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wickedness and Witches==
It is believed that there are four different types of witches that occur within society. First there is the white witch, who is good with herbs and spices. The white witch is considered to be a type of good witch. Then there is the weak influencer. This type of witch uses their power to try to influence others, which can be considered both good and evil.Then there is the type of witch that projects evil onto others. This type of witch is the one that is considered to be wicked. Finally, there is the witch that springs from imagination. Depending on how the person who is imagining the witch sees the witch determines whether this witch is considered good or wicked. Some people speculate that we all are witches in the sense that we all influence people in some way, shape or form.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, E. (1976). Witches: Wise, Weak, or Wicked Women? Journal of Religion and Health, 15(2), 136-139. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://mccclib.mccc.edu:2112/stable/27505341&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wickedness and Religion==
'''Buddhism'''

In the Buddhist religion, those who are wicked are sent to hell. This is typically seen as a Western idea, but it is visible in the Buddhist’s belief. There are 18 different hells and depending on the wicked behavior that is acted out determines which hell you will go to.

In the first hell whatever wicked behavior you have committed will be punished by forced nakedness, which is a horrendous punishment.

In the Burning Cauldron hell, those who have cooked meat are placed there.

In the Hell of Feces and Filth those who have eaten meat are detained here.

In the Hell of Cutting and Grinding if the person committed an act of taking a life they are placed here.

In the Freezing Hell those who did not keep feast days, didn’t do good deeds or didn’t follow the Buddhist way are placed here.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Åke Green''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈoːkɛ ˈɡreːn|lang}}; born 3 June 1941) is a Swedish [[Pentecostal]] [[Christian]] pastor who was prosecuted, but [[acquitted]], under Sweden's law against [[hate speech]] because of critical opinions on [[homosexuality]] in his [[sermon]]s. The [[Judicial system of Sweden#Courts|district court]] found him guilty and sentenced him to one month in prison. The sentence was appealed to the court of appeals ([[hovrätt]]). On 11 February 2005, the [[Göta Court of Appeal]] overturned the decision and acquitted Åke Green. On 9 March, the [[Prosecutor-General of Sweden|Prosecutor-General]] (''Riksåklagaren'') appealed this decision to the [[Supreme Court of Sweden|Supreme Court]], which on 29 November also acquitted.

The Supreme Court stated that Åke Green had violated Swedish law as it currently stands regarding agitation against groups, and that the constitutionally guaranteed [[freedom of expression]] as well as [[freedom of religion]] does not protect him. However, the  Supreme Court also stated that the  [[freedom of expression]] as well as [[freedom of religion]] provided by the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which is superior to normal Swedish law according to the lex superior principle regarding the [[ECHR]] found in the Instrument of Government (Regeringsformen) 2:19, gives him protection, since  jurisprudence  shows that a conviction would probably not be upheld by the [[European Court of Justice|European Court]].&lt;ref name="TheLocal29"&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/2590/20051129/ The Local, 29 Nov 2005: Åke Green cleared over gay sermon]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SupCourt"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120218220008/http://www.domstol.se/Domstolar/hogstadomstolen/Avgoranden/2005/Dom_pa_engelska_B_1050-05.pdf Judgment of the Supreme court of Sweden]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hogstadomstolen.se/pressmeddelanden.htm |title=Supreme court press release 2005-11-29 (In Swedish) |accessdate=2006-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060217161725/http://www.hogstadomstolen.se/pressmeddelanden.htm |archivedate=17 February 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In 2002, the [[Riksdag]] included references to sexual orientation in a list of groups protected against persecution in the form of threats and expressions of disdain. The list appears in a section of Swedish [[criminal law]] (''Brottsbalken'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sweden.gov.se/content/1/c4/15/36/d74ceabc.pdf The Swedish Penal Code (English), chapter 16, section 8]&lt;/ref&gt; known as The Act on Agitation Against a National or Ethnic Group (''Lagen om hets mot folkgrupp'').

== The sermon ==
At his church in [[Borgholm]], Green delivered a sermon&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eaec.org/bibleanswers/ake_green_sermon.htm&lt;/ref&gt; in which he described "sexual perversions" (referencing homosexuality) as "abnormal, a horrible [[cancer]]ous [[tumor]] in the body of society."  He also said that a person cannot be a Christian and a homosexual at the same time.

Green had invited members of the media to attend the sermon, but none were present when he preached it in the presence of about fifty listeners. He wrote a summary of the sermon, including the above-mentioned quotes, which was printed in the local newspaper Ölandsbladet. A representative of nearby [[Kalmar]]'s [[RFSL]], an [[LGBT]] equal rights organization, reported the sermon to the police and the controversy began.&lt;ref&gt;Den svenska politiken - Struktur, processer och resultat. Henry Bäck, Torbjörn Larsson, 2006. p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The [[Judicial system of Sweden#Courts|district court]] found Åke Green guilty and sentenced him to one month in prison. The sentence was appealed to the court of appeals ([[hovrätt]]) and Green's lawyer maintained his client's religious freedom had been violated. On 11 February 2005 Göta hovrätt overturned the decision and acquitted Åke Green. On 9 March, the [[Prosecutor-General of Sweden|Prosecutor-General]] (''Riksåklagaren'') appealed this decision to the [[Supreme Court of Sweden|Supreme Court]], which on 29 November also acquitted him.

The Supreme Court stated that Åke Green had violated Swedish hate speech law (''Lagen om hets mot folkgrupp'').  A conviction would probably not be upheld by the [[European Court of Human Rights|European Court]]&lt;ref name="TheLocal29"/&gt; considering Article 9 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which covers freedom of religion. After a discussion of the [[case law]] regarding Article 9 and 10 the court stated: "Under these circumstances, it is likely that the European Court, in a determination of the restriction of Åke Green’s right to preach his Biblically based opinion that a judgment of conviction would constitute, would find that this restriction is not proportionate, and would therefore be a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights."&lt;ref name="SupCourt"/&gt;

The sentence has raised a controversy all around the world, with disputes between those who see it as a victory for [[human rights]] and freedom from intolerance, and those who see it as an attack on [[freedom of religion|religious freedom]] and the right to [[freedom of speech|free speech]], which in themselves are both regarded as [[human right]]s.

Green became a cause celebre for [[Homophobia|anti-gay]] preacher [[Fred Phelps]], who has labelled anyone who held the belief that [[God]] could love non-elect [[sin]]ners as being eternally [[damnation|damned]]. Nonetheless, Phelps installed a monument praising Green on his website. (All of the other "monuments" to people on Phelps' sites actually express joy at the death of that person.) Phelps also launched a new website,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.godhatessweden.com God Hates Sweden] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050105032032/http://www.godhatessweden.com/ |date=5 January 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (GodHatesSweden.com) partially in tribute to Green. Green subsequently denounced Phelps.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=818&amp;date=20050107&lt;/ref&gt; "I think it is appalling that people say things like that," Green said, "it is extremely unpleasant." In response, Phelps and his organization, the [[Westboro Baptist Church]], denounced Green as a traitor and an ingrate, and he later removed the Green tribute from his website.

Åke Green was also supported by [[Ulf Ekman]] of [[Livets Ord]] and [[Robert Vesterlund]]'s ''[[Info-14]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Responding to the sentence, Sören Andersson, the president of [[Swedish Federation for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Rights]] (RFSL), said that religious freedom could never be used as a reason to persecute people.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thelocal.se/2590/20051129/ Åke Green cleared over gay sermon&lt;/ref&gt;

== Temperance organisations==
In the beginning of 2008 the organisation [[IOGT-NTO]], a Swedish [[temperance movement|temperance]] movement, decided to withdraw Åke Green's membership, stating that his statements about homosexuality conflict with IOGT-NTO's bylaws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iogt.se/templates/NewsPageSmall____15743.aspx (Swedish) IOGT-NTO's decision to exclude Åke Green]&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, Green became an adherent of the Christian temperance movement, the [[Blue ribbon#Other symbols|Blue Ribbon]]. He was involved in another controversy following the announcement that he was to hold a speech at a common manifestation together with the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]] on 1 May 2008, in [[Vänersborg]]. The Social Democrats excluded members of the Blue Ribbon, including Green, after several protests,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ttela.se/?article=38461 (Swedish) "Åke Green no longer welcome", story published in local paper TTELA]&lt;/ref&gt; some of which were published in Vänersborgs local newspaper, ''TTELA''.
