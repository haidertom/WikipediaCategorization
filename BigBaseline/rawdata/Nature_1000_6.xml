[[File:Kaskaskia Island 1993 flooding.jpg|thumb|[[Mississippi River]] at [[Kaskaskia, Illinois]] during the [[Great Flood of 1993]].]]
A '''one-hundred-year flood''' is a [[flood]] event that has a 1% probability of occurring in any given year.

The 100-year flood is also referred to as the 1% flood, since its annual exceedance probability is 1%.&lt;ref name="Holmes"&gt;Holmes, R.R., Jr., and Dinicola, K. (2010) ''100-Year flood–it's all about chance '' [http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/106/ U.S. Geological Survey General Information Product 106]&lt;/ref&gt;  For river systems, the 100-year flood is generally expressed as a flowrate.   Based on the expected 100-year flood flow rate, the flood [[water]] level can be mapped as an area of inundation.  The resulting [[floodplain]] map is referred to as the 100-year floodplain.  Estimates of the 100-year flood flowrate and other streamflow statistics for any stream in the United States are available.&lt;ref name="Ries"&gt;Ries, K.G., and others (2008) ''StreamStats: A water resources web application '' [http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2008/3067/ U.S. Geological Survey, Fact Sheet 2008-3067]  [http://water.usgs.gov/osw/streamstats/ Application home page] URL accessed 2015-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK The [[Environment Agency]] publishes a comprehensive map of all areas at risk of a 1 in 100 year flood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maps.environment-agency.gov.uk/wiyby/wiybyController?x=460730.0&amp;y=189442.0&amp;topic=floodmap&amp;ep=map&amp;scale=9&amp;location=OX10%200AJ&amp;lang=_e&amp;layerGroups=default&amp;distance=&amp;textonly=off|publisher=[[Environment Agency]]|title=Flood Map for Planning (Rivers and Sea)|access-date=25 August 2016|date=2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916225532/http://maps.environment-agency.gov.uk/wiyby/wiybyController?x=460730.0&amp;y=189442.0&amp;topic=floodmap&amp;ep=map&amp;scale=9&amp;location=OX10%200AJ&amp;lang=_e&amp;layerGroups=default&amp;distance=&amp;textonly=off|archive-date=2016-09-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Areas near the coast of an ocean or large lake also can be flooded by combinations of [[tide]], [[storm surge]], and [[wind wave|waves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coastal Flooding|url=https://www.floodsmart.gov/floodsmart/pages/coastal_flooding/cf_overview.jsp|website=FloodSmart|publisher=National Flood Insurance Program|accessdate=7 March 2016|ref=NFIP coastal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308052549/https://www.floodsmart.gov/floodsmart/pages/coastal_flooding/cf_overview.jsp|archive-date=2016-03-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maps of the riverine or coastal 100-year floodplain may figure importantly in building permits, environmental regulations, and [[flood insurance]].

==Probability==
A common misunderstanding is that a 100-year flood is likely to occur only once in a 100-year period.  In fact, there is approximately a 63.4% chance of one or more 100-year floods occurring in any 100-year period. On the [[Danube]] River at [[Passau]], Germany, the actual intervals between 100-year floods during 1501 to 2013 ranged from 37 to 192 years.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"&gt;Eychaner, J.H. (2015) ''Lessons from a 500-year record of flood elevations  '' [http://www.floods.org/ace-files/documentlibrary/publications/asfpmpubs-techrep7_2015.pdf Association of State Floodplain Managers, Technical Report 7] URL accessed 2015-06-27.&lt;/ref&gt; The probability '''P&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''' that one or more floods occurring during any period will exceed a given flood threshold can be expressed, using the [[binomial distribution]], as

&lt;math&gt;P_{e}=1-\left[ 1-\left( \frac{1}{T} \right) \right]^{n}&lt;/math&gt;

where  '''T''' is the threshold [[return period]] (e.g. 100-yr, 50-yr, 25-yr, and so forth), and '''n''' is the number of years in the period. The [[probability of exceedance]] '''P&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''' is also described as the natural, inherent, or hydrologic risk of failure.&lt;ref name="Mays"&gt;Mays, L.W (2005) ''Water Resources Engineering, chapter 10, Probability, risk, and uncertainty analysis for hydrologic and hydraulic design'' Hoboken: J. Wiley &amp; Sons&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maidment"&gt;Maidment, D.R. ed.(1993) ''Handbook of Hydrology, chapter 18, Frequency analysis of extreme events''  New York: McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[expected value]] of the number of 100-year floods occurring in any 100-year period is 1.

Ten-year floods have a 10% chance of occurring in any given year (P&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; =0.10); 500-year have a 0.2% chance of occurring in any given year (P&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; =0.002); etc. The percent chance of an X-year flood occurring in a single year is 100/X. A similar analysis is commonly applied to [[coastal flood]]ing or rainfall data. The [[return period|recurrence interval]] of a storm is rarely identical to that of an associated riverine flood, because of rainfall timing and location variations among different [[drainage basin]]s.

The field of [[extreme value theory]] was created to model rare events such as 100-year floods for the purposes of civil engineering.  This theory is most commonly applied to the maximum or minimum observed stream flows of a given river. In desert areas where there are only ephemeral washes, this method is applied to the maximum observed rainfall over a given period of time (24-hours, 6-hours, or 3-hours). The extreme value analysis only considers the most extreme event observed in a given year. So, between the large spring runoff and a heavy summer rain storm, whichever resulted in more runoff would be considered the extreme event, while the smaller event would be ignored in the analysis (even though both may have been capable of causing terrible flooding in their own right).

==Statistical assumptions==

There are a number of [[Statistical assumption|assumptions]] which are made to complete the analysis which determines the 100-year flood. First, the extreme events observed in each year must be [[statistical independence|independent]] from year-to-year. In other words, the maximum river flow rate from 1984 cannot be found to be [[Statistical significance|significantly]] [[correlation and dependence|correlated]] with the observed flow rate in 1985.  1985 cannot be correlated with 1986, and so forth. The second assumption is that the observed extreme events must come from the same [[probability distribution function]]. The third assumption is that the probability distribution relates to the largest storm (rainfall or river flow rate measurement) that occurs in any one year. The fourth assumption is that the probability distribution function is stationary, meaning that the [[mean]] (average), [[standard deviation]] and [[Minima and maxima (introduction)|max/min]] values are not increasing or decreasing over time.  This concept is referred to as [[Stationary process|stationarity]].&lt;ref name="Maidment"/&gt;&lt;ref name="B17C"&gt;{{cite book |last1=England |first1=John |last2=and seven others |title=Guidelines for determining flood flow frequency—Bulletin 17C |date=29 March 2018 |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/tm4B5 |accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first assumption is often but not always valid and should be tested on a case by case basis. The second assumption is often valid if the extreme events are observed under similar climate conditions. For example, if the extreme events on record all come from late summer thunder storms (as is the case in the southwest U.S.), or from snow pack melting (as is the case in north-central U.S.), then this assumption should be valid. If, however, there are some extreme events taken from thunder storms, others from snow pack melting, and others from hurricanes, then this assumption is most likely not valid. The third assumption is only a problem when trying to forecast a low, but maximum flow event (for example, an event smaller than a 2-year flood). Since this is not typically a goal in extreme analysis, or in civil engineering design, then the situation rarely presents itself. The final assumption about stationarity is difficult to test from data for a single site because of the large uncertainties in even the longest flood records&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt; (see next section). More broadly, substantial evidence of [[climate change]] strongly suggests that the probability distribution is also changing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/319/5863/573.full |work=Science Magazine |title=Stationarity is Dead |publisher=Sciencemag.org |date=2008-02-01 |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that managing flood risks in the future will become even more difficult.&lt;ref name=IPPC&gt;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2012) ''Managing the risks of extreme events and disasters to advance climate change adaptation,'' [http://ipcc-wg2.gov/SREX/images/uploads/SREX-SPMbrochure_FINAL.pdf Summary for policymakers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150719211442/http://ipcc-wg2.gov/SREX/images/uploads/SREX-SPMbrochure_FINAL.pdf |date=2015-07-19 }}  Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 19 p.&lt;/ref&gt; The simplest implication of this is that not all of the historical data are, or can be, considered valid as input into the extreme event analysis.

==Probability uncertainty==

When these assumptions are violated there is an ''unknown'' amount of uncertainty introduced into the reported value of what the 100-year flood means in terms of rainfall intensity, or flood depth. When all of the inputs are known the uncertainty can be measured in the form of a confidence interval. For example, one might say there is a 95% chance that the 100-year flood is greater than X, but less than Y.&lt;ref name="Holmes"/&gt;

Direct statistical analysis&lt;ref name="B17C"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ACWI"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bulletin 17C |url=https://acwi.gov/hydrology/Frequency/b17c/ |publisher=Advisory Committee on Water Information |accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to estimate the 100-year riverine flood is possible only at the relatively few locations where an annual series of maximum instantaneous flood discharges has been recorded. In the United States as of 2014, taxpayers have supported such records for at least 60 years at fewer than 2,600 locations, for at least 90 years at fewer than 500, and for at least 120 years at only 11.&lt;ref name="NWIS"&gt;[http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis ''National Water Information System database''] U.S. Geological Survey. URL accessed 2014-01-30.&lt;/ref&gt;  For comparison, the total area of the nation is about {{convert|3,800,000|sqmi|km2}}, so there are perhaps 3,000 stream reaches that drain watersheds of {{convert|1,000|sqmi|km2}} and 300,000 reaches that drain {{convert|10|sqmi|km2}}. In urban areas, 100-year flood estimates are needed for watersheds as small as {{convert|1|sqmi|km2}}. For reaches without sufficient data for direct analysis, 100-year flood estimates are derived from [[regression analysis|indirect statistical analysis]] of flood records at other locations in a hydrologically similar region or from other [[Hydrology#Modeling|hydrologic models]]. Similarly for coastal floods, [[tide gauge]] data exist for only about 1,450 sites worldwide, of which only about 950 added information to the global data center between January 2010 and March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obtaining Tide Gauge Data|url=http://www.psmsl.org/data/obtaining/|website=Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level|publisher=PSMSL|accessdate=7 March 2016|ref=PSMSL_data}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Passau flood scale Sept 2012.JPG|thumb|High-water scale 1501-2002 at [[Passau|Passau, Germany]], as of September 2012]]
Much longer records of flood elevations exist at a few locations around the world, such as the [[Danube]] River at [[Passau]], Germany,  but they must be evaluated carefully for accuracy and completeness before any statistical interpretation.

For an individual stream reach, the uncertainties in any analysis can be large, so 100-year flood estimates have large individual uncertainties for most stream reaches.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|24}}  For the largest recorded flood at any specific location, or any potentially larger event, the recurrence interval always is poorly known.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|20,24}}  Spatial variability adds more uncertainty, because a flood peak observed at different locations on the same stream during the same event commonly represents a different recurrence interval at each location.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|20}}  If an extreme storm drops enough rain on one branch of a river to cause a 100-year flood, but no rain falls over another branch, the flood wave downstream from their junction might have a recurrence interval of only 10 years. Conversely, a storm that produces a 25-year flood simultaneously in each branch might form a 100-year flood downstream. During a time of flooding, news accounts necessarily simplify the story by reporting the greatest damage and largest recurrence interval estimated at any location. The public can easily and incorrectly conclude that the recurrence interval applies to all stream reaches in the flood area.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|7,24}}

==Observed intervals between floods==
Peak elevations of 14 floods as early as 1501 on the [[Danube]] River at [[Passau]], Germany, reveal great variability in the actual intervals between floods.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|16–19}}  Flood events greater than the 50-year flood occurred at intervals of 4 to 192 years since 1501, and the 50-year flood of 2002 was followed only 11 years later by a 500-year flood. Only half of the intervals between 50- and 100-year floods were within 50 percent of the nominal average interval. Similarly, the intervals between 5-year floods during 1955 to 2007 ranged from 5 months to 16 years, and only half  were within 2.5 to 7.5 years.

==Regulatory use==
In the United States, the 100-year flood provides the risk basis for [[flood insurance]] rates. Complete information on the [[National Flood Insurance Program]] (NFIP) is available [http://www.floodsmart.gov/ here.] A ''regulatory flood'' or ''base flood'' is routinely established for river reaches through a science-based rule-making process targeted to a 100-year flood at the historical average recurrence interval. In addition to historical flood data, the process accounts for previously established regulatory values, the effects of flood-control reservoirs, and changes in land use in the watershed. [[Coastal flood]] hazards have been mapped by a similar approach that includes the relevant physical processes. Most areas where serious floods can occur in the United States have been mapped consistently in this manner. On average nationwide, those 100-year flood estimates are well sufficient for the purposes of the NFIP and offer reasonable estimates of future flood risk, if the future is like the past.&lt;ref name="Eychaner"/&gt;{{rp|24}} Approximately 3% of the U.S. population lives in areas subject to the 1% annual chance coastal flood hazard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crowell|first1=Mark|last2=others|title=An estimate of the U.S. population living in 100-year coastal flood hazard areas|journal=Journal of Coastal Research|date=2010|volume=26|issue=2|pages=201–211|doi=10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-09-00076.1|url=http://www.floods.org/PDF/JCR_Est_US_Pop_100y_CFHA_2010.pdf|accessdate=6 March 2016|ref=Crowell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, removing homes and businesses from areas that flood repeatedly can protect people and reduce insurance losses, but in practice it is difficult for people to retreat from established neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="schwartz"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schwartz |first1=Jen |title=Surrendering to rising seas |journal=Scientific American |date=1 August 2018 |volume=319 |issue=2 |pages=44-55 |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/surrendering-to-rising-seas/ |accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''amity-enmity complex''' was a term introduced by [[Sir Arthur Keith]]. His work, ''[[A New Theory of Human Evolution]]'' (1948), posited that humans evolved as differing races, tribes, and cultures, exhibiting patriotism, morality, leadership and nationalism. Those who belong are part of the [[in-group]], and tolerated; all others are classed as [[Ingroups and outgroups|out-group]], and subject to hostility; 'The code of enmity is a necessary part of the machinery of evolution. He who feels generous towards his enemy... has given up his place in the turmoil of evolutionary competition.' [[Conscience]] in humans evolved a duality; to protect and save friends,
and also to hate and fight enemies. &lt;ref&gt; Sir Arthur Keith, A new theory of evolution, Watts and Co, 1948, p 82 &lt;/ref&gt;
Keith's work summarized earlier opinions on human [[tribalism]] by [[Charles Darwin]],&lt;ref&gt; Darwin, [[Descent of Man]], 1879, chapter 7, On the Races of man &lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Russel Wallace]],&lt;ref&gt; Darwinism, Wallace, 1889, chapter 15 &lt;/ref&gt; and [[Herbert Spencer]].

==Case studies==
{{Unsourced section|date=November 2017}}
# United States; [[racial segregation]]: Keith suggested that racial segregation imposed by [[Jim Crow law]]s was a 'vast experiment' in which ten million coloureds were 'marked off (in 1948) from the rest by a frontier as sharply defined and jealously guarded as the frontiers of a kingdom'.
# [[Apartheid]] in [[South Africa]]: White 'dominance' was 'deeply seated in the primitive organization of the Human brain. [[Boer]] and British settlers both agree 'there is an impassable frontier between them and the native races of Africa and Asia'.
# Jews in Europe: 'The Jews maintain a racial frontier (in 1948), such as dominant races surround themselves with; they carry themselves as if racially distinct...the Jewish frontier may be strengthened by the faith which is (sic) the standard of the race.'  Keith alleged that Jews had a 'dual code; conduct towards their fellows is based on amity, that to all outside their circle is based on enmity. The use of the dual code is the mark of an evolving race.'
# The Indian [[caste system]].

==Disruption==
The amity-enmity complex maintains 'tribal spirit' and thus unity, of the community, 'as long as personal contact between its members is possible.' If the community grows beyond this limitation, then disruption, swarming and disintegration occur. Modern mass communication enables communities 'of 100 million' to remain intact.

==Cyclical effect==
Keith expressed regret that this phenomenon, which explains so much, had not become common knowledge:  "[W]e eternally experience the misery... of each new manifestation of the complex, then invent some new 'ism' to categorise this behavior as an evil, dealing with a common behavioural trait piecemeal [instead of] finally grasping and understanding the phenomenon."&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Keith]], ''A New Theory of Human Evolution'', 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2017}}

== Modern examples of tribal instinct==
Colleges, sports teams, churches, trades unions, female fashions and political parties enable people to exhibit tribal loyalty within large, mass-communicating nations. 'In politics we have to take sides.' But all these 'petty manifestations' are cast aside in time of war.
[[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Lloyd George]] are cited as statesmen who knew how to exploit the tribal spirit for political ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/3/1/3/6/31369/|title=Index of /files/31369|website=www.gutenberg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2017}}

==In later works==
[[Robert Ardrey]] pointed out that similar behavior can be observed in most primates, especially baboons and chimps.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Ardrey]], ''[[African Genesis]]'', Fontana, 1969, pp. 85-89.&lt;/ref&gt; "Nationalism as such is no more than a human expression of the animal drive to maintain and defend a territory... the mentality of the single Germanic tribe under Hitler differed in no way from that of early man or late baboon."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Ardrey]], ''[[African Genesis]]'', Fontana, 1969, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

The amity-enmity complex is a serious obstacle to [[world peace]] and [[world government]], and may even lead to [[nuclear holocaust]]:  "How can we get along without war?... if we fail to get along without war, the future will be as lacking in human problems as it will be remarkably lacking in men."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Ardrey]], ''[[African Genesis]]'', Fontana, 1969, p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Desmond Morris]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Desmond Morris]], ''[[The Human Zoo (book)|The Human Zoo]]'', Cape, 1969, chapter one: Tribes and Supertribes; chapter four: Ingroups and Outgroups &lt;/ref&gt; makes a prescriptive point:  "We must try to step outside our groups and look down on human battlefields with the unbiased eye of a hovering Martian."  And he warns that "the truly violent species all appear to have exterminated themselves, a lesson we should not overlook."  The inherited aggression of the amity-enmity rivalry between communities is rationalized under a "persistent cloak of ideology... a matter of ideals, moral principles, social philosophies or religious beliefs....  [O]nly an immense amount of intellectual restraint will save the situation."&lt;ref&gt;[[Desmond Morris]], ''[[The Human Zoo (book)|The Human Zoo]]'', Cape, 1969, chap. four.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War Two]], a debate about the place of instinct and learning (the [[nature versus nurture|nature-versus-nurture]] debate) has occurred. According to [[Steven Pinker]], the "bitter lessons of lynchings, world wars, and the Holocaust" have caused "prevailing theories of mind" to be "refashioned to make racism and sexism as untenable as possible. The doctrine of the [[blank slate]] became entrenched in intellectual life."&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Pinker]], ''[[The Blank Slate]]'', 2002, pp. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinker makes the point that "conflicts of interest are inherent to the human condition."  Man is a product of nature, as much as malarial mosquitoes; both "are doing exactly what evolution designed them to do, even if the outcome makes people suffer...  [We] cannot call their behavior pathological...  [T]he belief that violence is an aberration is dangerous."&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Pinker]], ''[[The Blank Slate]]'', 2002, pp. 313-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freeman and Co.|location=New York|pages=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, types of settings in which analog observation is utilized include clinical offices or research laboratories, but, by definition, analog observations can be made in any artificial environment, even if the environment is one which the subject is likely to encounter naturally.

== Applications ==

'''Analog observation''' is typically divided into two iteration of application: The first iteration primarily studies the effect of manipulation of variables in the subject's environment, including setting and events, on the subject's behavior. The second iteration primarily seeks to observe the subject's behavior in [[quasi-experiment]]al social situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Corsini|first=Raymond J.|title=Encyclopedia of psychology|year=1984|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Brights Movement''' is an international intellectual movement, whose members refer to themselves as Brights and hold a [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist]] [[worldview]].

Most Brights believe that public policies should be based on science (a body of knowledge obtained and tested by use of the [[scientific method]]). Brights are likely to oppose the practice of basing public policies on [[supernatural]] doctrines. Brights may therefore be described as [[secularists]].

The most politically active Brights frequently and openly advocate [[scientocracy]], the practice of basing public policies on science. They look forward to living in an era when the best available scientific evidence provides a foundation for the [[humane]] and [[compassionate]] operation of human societies.

== Terminology ==
The Bright movement has proposed the following terminology:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-brights.net|title=The Brights' Net - Who are The Brights?|publisher=The Brights' Net|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* super (noun): someone whose worldview includes supernatural and/or mystical elements
* bright (noun): someone whose worldview is naturalistic (no supernatural and mystical elements)
* Bright: a bright who has registered on the Bright website as a member of the movement

== History ==
Paul Geisert, who coined the term bright and co-founded the bright movement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kzYGLAFV8k|title=A Glimpse Inside: The Brights' Network - Describing the Brights' Net (Paul Geisert)|author=The Brights' Net|publisher=YouTube|date=8 August 2012|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a one-time Chicago biology teacher, professor, entrepreneur and writer of learning materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-brights.net/people/enthusiastic/index3.html|title=The Brights' Net - Enthusiastic Brights (Page 3)|publisher=The Brights' Net|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In deciding to attend the [[Godless Americans March on Washington]] in 2002, Geisert disliked the label "godless" as he saw it as synonymous with evil, he thought this would alienate the public. He sought a new, positive word that might become well-accepted and improve the image of those who did not believe in the supernatural, in the same way that the term "[[gay]]" did. A few weeks later, Geisert came up with the noun "bright" after brainstorming lots of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csindy.com/coloradosprings/the-bright-side/Content?oid=1808508/|title=The Bright side|last=Leibrock|first=Rachel|work=[[Colorado Springs Independent]]|date=12 August 2010|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Religion Be Damned"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2003/10/religion-be-damned/|title=Religion Be Damned|newspaper=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|date=1 October 2003|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then ran into another room and told his wife: "I've got the word, and this is going to be big!".&lt;ref name="Sptimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/07/20/Floridian/A_brights_idea.shtml|title=A brights idea|newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=20 July 2003|accessdate=20 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also co-founded by his wife, [[Mynga  Futrell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dflwh-_CGY|title=A Civic Umbrella for a Wide-Ranging Diversity: The Brights and Tradition|author=The Brights' Net|publisher=YouTube|date=8 August 2012|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Futrell and Geisert remain co-directors of the organization to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-brights.net/vision/faq.html#12|title=Who directs The-Brights.Net?|publisher=The Brights' Net|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After coming up with the term they pitched their idea to friends and decided to unveil their idea at an [[Atheist Alliance International]] conference in [[Tampa]], [[Florida]]. They called the organizers and got permission to present the idea.&lt;ref name="Sptimes"/&gt;

Geisert and Futrell made their proposal in Spring 2003 at an atheist conference in Florida which was attended by [[Richard Dawkins]].&lt;ref name="The Church of the Non-Believers"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.11/atheism.htmlti|title=The Church of the Non-Believers|newspaper=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|date=14 November 2006|accessdate=14 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; They launched the Brights' Net website on June 4, 2003. The movement gained early publicity through articles by Richard Dawkins in ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,981412,00.html|title=The future looks bright|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|author-link=Richard Dawkins|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=21 June 2003|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Wired magazine|Wired]]'';&lt;ref name="Religion Be Damned"/&gt; and by [[Daniel Dennett]] in  ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="Dennett Defense"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/12/opinion/the-bright-stuff.html|title=The Bright Stuff|last=Dennett|first=Daniel C.|author-link=Daniel Dennett|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 July 2003|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement continued to grow and experienced accelerated registrations following media debate around [[New Atheism]]&lt;ref name="The Church of the Non-Believers"/&gt; prompted by a series of book releases in late 2006 including ''[[The God Delusion]]'', ''[[Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon|Breaking the Spell]]'', ''[[God Is Not Great]]'', ''[[The End of Faith]]'' and ''[[Letter to a Christian Nation]]''. The movement has grown to be a constituency of over 78,000 Brights in 204 nations and territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-brights.net/funding/supportbrights/|title=Supporting the Brights|publisher=The Brights' Net|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- A website has been set up by Quebecan Brights and titled brightsquebec.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brightsquebec.org|title=Brights Quebec|publisher=Brights Quebec|deadurl=usurped}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

== Brights ==
Many, but not all, brights also identify as [[Atheism|atheist]], [[Antitheism|antitheist]], [[Humanism|humanist]] (specifically [[Secular humanism|secular humanist]]), [[Freethought|freethinker]], [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist]], [[irreligion]]ist, [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalist]], [[Materialism|materialist]] or [[Physicalism|physicalist]], [[Agnosticism|agnostic]], [[Skepticism|skeptic]], or even [[Naturalistic pantheism|naturalistic pantheist]].&lt;ref name="FAQ1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-brights.net/vision/faq.html#1|title=Bright (n.)--What is the definition?||publisher=The Brights' Net|accessdate=4 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the "movement is not associated with any defined beliefs". The website Brights' Net says its goal is to include the umbrella term bright in the vocabulary of this existing "community of reason".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-brights.net/vision/faq.html#8|title=What is the Purpose of the Brights' Net?|publisher=The Brights' Net|accessdate=4 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, "the broader intent is inclusive of the many-varied persons whose worldview is naturalistic", but are in the "general population" as opposed to associating solely with the "community of reason". Thus, persons who can declare their naturalistic worldview using the term bright extend beyond the familiar secularist categories as long as they do not hold theistic worldviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://the-brights.net/movement/bulletin/bulletin.html?b=70|title=Theistic Brights? – Not So!|publisher=The Brights' Net|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Registrations even include some members of the clergy, such as [[Presbyterian]] ministers and a Church History Professor and ordained priest.

Dawkins compares the coining of bright to the "triumph of [[consciousness-raising]]" from the term gay:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Gay is succinct, uplifting, positive: an "up" word, where homosexual is a down word, and [[queer]], [[faggot (epithet)|faggot]] and pooftah are insults. Those of us who subscribe to no religion; those of us whose view of the universe is natural rather than supernatural; those of us who rejoice in the real and scorn the false comfort of the unreal, we need a word of our own, a word like "gay"[,] [...] a noun hijacked from an adjective, with its original meaning changed but not too much. Like gay, it should be catchy: a potentially prolific meme. Like gay, it should be positive, warm, cheerful, bright.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite the explicit difference between the noun and adjective, there have been comments on the comparison. In his ''Wired'' article, Dawkins stated: "Whether there is a statistical tendency for brights [noun] to be bright [adjective] is a matter for research".

Notable people who have self-identified as brights at one time or another include: biologists Richard Dawkins and [[Richard J. Roberts]]; cognitive scientist [[Steven Pinker]]; philosophers Daniel Dennett and  [[Massimo Pigliucci]]; stage magicians and [[debunker]]s [[James Randi]] and [[Penn &amp; Teller]]; [[Amy Alkon]]; [[Sheldon Lee Glashow]]; [[Babu Gogineni]]; [[Edwin Kagin]]; [[Mel Lipman]]; [[Piergiorgio Odifreddi]]; and [[Air America Radio]] talk show host [[Lionel (radio personality)|Lionel]].

=== Contrasted with supers ===
Daniel Dennett, in his book ''[[Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon]]'', suggests that if non-naturalists are concerned with connotations of the word bright, then they should invent an equally positive sounding word for themselves, like supers (i.e. one whose world view contains supernaturalism).&lt;ref name="Dennett 2006"&gt;{{cite book|title=Breaking the Spell|last=Dennett|first=Daniel C.|author-link=Daniel Dennett|year=2006|location=London|publisher=Penguin|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also suggested this during his presentation at the Atheist Alliance International '07 convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saliental.blogspot.com/2006/09/dan-dennett-at-aaic-07.html|title=Dan Dennett at AAIC '07|publisher=Salient|date=21 September 2006|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyyRAE7PDvw|title=Award &amp; Speech at AAI 07 pt1 of 2|last=Dennett|first=Daniel C.|author-link=Daniel Dennett|publisher=YouTube|date=26 October 2007|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geisert and Futrell maintain that the [[neologism]] has always had a kinship with [[the Enlightenment]], an era which celebrated the possibilities of science and a certain amount of free inquiry. They have endorsed the use of super as the antonym to bright, although this term makes the assumption that anyone not a bright necessarily subscribes to notions of supernaturalism.

== Symbol ==
The Brights' avatar represents a celestial body viewed from space. As there is no up or down or right or left in outer space, the arrangement of planet and darkness and starlight is changeable.&lt;ref name="symbology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-brights.net/vision/symbolism.html|title=Brights Symbology|publisher=The Brights Net|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the symbol is open to the viewer's interpretation, it is generally meant to invoke transition and a sense of gradual illumination.  The intentional ambiguity of the avatar is meant to symbolically reflect an important question: Is the future of humankind becoming luminous or more dim? The Brights aspire "to take the promising route, whereby the imagery brings to mind a gradually increasing illumination for this earth of ours, an escalation of enlightenment".&lt;ref name="symbology"/&gt; This optimistic interpretation of the Brights' symbol is summarized by the [[motto]] "Embrightenment Now!".

== Name controversy ==
The movement has been criticised by some (both religious and non-religious) who have objected to the adoption of the title "bright" because they believe it suggests that the individuals with a naturalistic [[worldview]] are more intelligent ("brighter") than non-naturalists, such as [[Philosophical skepticism|philosophical skeptics]] or [[Idealism|idealists]], believers in the [[paranormal]], [[Philosophical theism|philosophical theists]], or the [[religiosity and intelligence|religious]].&lt;ref name="not so bright"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122730390376349015|title=Not So 'Bright'|last=D'Souza|first=Dinesh|author-link=Dinesh D'Souza|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[Dow Jones]]|date=12 October 2003|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] published an article by [[Chris Mooney (journalist)|Chris Mooney]] titled "Not Too 'Bright{{'"}} in which he stated that although he agreed with the movement, Richard Dawkins's and Daniel Dennett's "campaign to rename religious unbelievers 'brights' could use some rethinking" because of the possibility that the term would be misinterpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/not_too_bright/|title=Brights: Not Too 'Bright'|last=Mooney|first=Chris|author-link=Chris Mooney (journalist)|publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]|date=15 October 2003|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journalist and noted atheist [[Christopher Hitchens]] likewise found it a "cringe-making proposal that atheists should conceitedly nominate themselves to be called 'brights{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/features/2007/god_is_not_great/religion_poisons_everything.html|title=Religion Poisons Everything (Exclusive Excerpts from Christopher Hitchens' ''God Is Not Great'')|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|author-link=Christopher Hitchens|newspaper=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=25 April 2017|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to this, Daniel Dennett has stated:&lt;ref name="Dennett 2006"/&gt;
{{quote|text=There was also a negative response, largely objecting to the term that had been chosen [not by me]: ''bright'', which seemed to imply that others were dim or stupid. But the term, modeled on the highly successful hijacking of the ordinary word "gay" by homosexuals, does not have to have that implication. Those who are not gays are not necessarily glum; they're ''straight''. Those who are not brights are not necessarily dim.}}

'''''Building Safer Communities. Risk Governance, Spatial Planning and Responses to Natural Hazards''''' is a 2009 book edited by Urbano Fra Paleo, published by [[IOS Press]].

This textbook examines the central principles of enhanced [[risk governance]], whose implementation might help to mitigate the increasing losses caused by [[natural hazards]]. It promotes the adoption of [[proactive]], preventive approaches in [[public policies]], particularly through [[land use planning]], by influencing on the occupation of hazard-prone areas.
It serves both as a comprehensive introduction to the formulation and implementation at the strategic level of policies that address [[risk]], and as an advancement in the integration of current practices, including [[emergency management]], [[environmental management]], [[community development]] and [[spatial planning]]. 
The authors study and construe solutions that review integrated strategies of the various levels of government considering:
* The central role of [[local government]] in planning for [[Disaster mitigation|mitigation]],
* The integration of mitigation with other social, economic and environmental goals,
* The engagement of all [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] in mitigation planning,
* The avoidance of disruption of [[Natural environment|environmental]] functions,
* The need of integrating mandates of higher level government with cooperative planning in order to both secure local government participation and make planning [[sustainable]],
* [[Participatory decision-making]] processes need to be improved by differentiating among their types and applications, in order to effectively respond in [[risk management]],
* People [[perception]] of and response to risk must be part of the planning process,
* Processes of human exposure to natural hazards should be fully understood in order to prevent further exposure,
* The [[precautionary principle]] needs to be integrated in risk management, although under comprehensible [[regulation]] in order to promote action,
* Urban risk governance can only be understood within the framework of regional and biophysical systems,
* [[Social impact assessment]] is a tool that helps to better identify the social and [[community]] dimensions of risk,
* Planning should be considered more as a process than as a result, and
* Post-[[disaster]] recovery also provides opportunities for mitigation and community improvement.&lt;ref name=auth&gt;[http://www.iospress.nl/loadtop/load.php?isbn=9781607500469  Building Safer Communities.

[[Romanticism]] grew largely out of an attempt to understand not just inert nature, but also vital nature. Romantic works in the realm of art and [[medicine|Romantic medicine]] were a response to the general failure of the application of method of inertial science to reveal the foundational laws and operant principles of vital nature. German romantic science and medicine sought to understand the nature of the life principle identified by John Hunter as distinct from matter itself via [[Blumenbach|Johan Friedrich Blumenbach]]'s ''Bildungstrieb'' and [[Hahnemann|Romantic medicine]]'s ''Lebenskraft'', as well as Röschlaub's development of the [[Brunonian|Brunonian system of medicine]] system of John Brown, in his ''excitation theory'' of life (German:''Erregbarkeit theorie''), working also with  Schelling's ''Naturphilosophie'', the work of [[Goethe]] regarding morphology, and the first dynamic conception of physiology of [[Richard Saumarez]]. But it is in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] that we find the question of life and vital nature most intensely and comprehensively examined, particularly in his '''''Hints towards the Formation of a more Comprehensive Theory of Life'''''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (1818), providing the foundation for [[Romanticism and epistemology|Romantic philosophy]], science and medicine.&lt;ref name=Levere&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levere|first1=Trevor H.|title=Coleridge and the Sciences|journal=CUP Archive|date=June 28, 1990|pages=295–306|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=0jc4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA295&amp;dq=Owen+Barfield+Hints+Towards+a+More+Comprehensive+Theory+of+Life&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Owen%20Barfield%20Hints%20Towards%20a%20More%20Comprehensive%20Theory%20of%20Life&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is key to understanding the relationship of Romantic literature and science.&lt;ref name=JSTOR&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Male|first1=Roy R.

== Background ==
The Enlightenment had developed a philosophy and science supported by formidable twin pillars: the first the Cartesian split of mind and matter, the second Newtonian physics, with its conquest of inert nature, both of which focused the mind's gaze on things or objects. For Cartesian philosophy, life existed on the side of matter, not mind; and for the physical sciences, the method that had been so productive for revealing the secrets of inert nature, should be equally productive in examining vital nature. The initial attempt to seek the cause and principle of life in matter was challenged by John Hunter, who held that the principle of life was not to be found nor confined within matter, but existed independently of matter itself, and informed or animated it, that is, he implied, it was the unifying or antecedent cause of the things or what Aristotelean philosophy termed ''natura naturata'' (the outer appearances of nature).
 
This reduction of the question of life to matter, and the corollary, that the method of the inertial sciences was the way to understand the very phenomenon of life, that is, its very nature and essence as a power (''natura naturans''), not as manifestations through sense-perceptible appearances (''natura naturata''), also reduced the individual to a material-mechanical 'thing' and seemed to render human freedom an untenable concept. It was this that Romanticism challenged, seeking instead to find an approach to the essence of nature as being also vital not simply inert, through a systematic method involving not just physics, but physiology (living functions). For Coleridge, quantitative analysis was anti-realist and needed to be grounded in qualitative analysis ('-ologies') (as was the case with Goethe's approach).&lt;ref name=Dyssebeia&gt;{{cite web|title=Two Metaphors In Coleridge's Theory of Life|url=http://dyssebeia.wordpress.com/2013/10/17/two-metaphors-in-coleridges-theory-of-life/|website=Dyssebeia|publisher=[[Wordpress]]|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
At the same time, the Romantics had to deal with the idealistic view that life was a 'somewhat' outside of things, such that the things themselves lost any real existence, a stream coming through Hume and Kant, and also infusing the German natural philosophical stream, German idealism, and in particular ''naturphilosophie'', eventuating scientifically in the doctrine of 'vitalism'. For the Romantics, life is independent of and antecedent to nature, but also infused and suspended in nature, not apart from it, As David Bohm expresses it in more modern terms "In nature nothing remains constant…everything comes from other things and gives rise to other things. This principle is…at the foundation of the possibility of our understanding nature in a rational way."&lt;ref name=Bohm&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bohm|first1=David|title=Causality and Chance in Modern Physics|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|location=1957|page=1|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=nweG_wrUHuAC&amp;q=foundation#v=snippet&amp;q=foundation&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And as Coleridge explained, 'this antecedent unity, or cause and principle of each union, it has since the time of Bacon and Kepler been customary to call a law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=[[Wesleyan University Press]]|location=Middletown, CT|page=44, note 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; And as law, "we derive from it a progressive insight into the necessity and generation of the phenomena of which it is the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=45, fn 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coleridge’s theory of life ==

Coleridge's was the dominant mind on many issues involving the philosophy and science in his time, as John Stuart Mill acknowledged, along with others since who have studied the history of Romanticism.

:The name of Coleridge is one of the few English names of our time which are likely to be oftener pronounced, and to become symbolical of more important things, in proportion as the inward workings of the age manifest themselves more and more in outward facts.&lt;ref name=Mill&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mill|first1=John Stuart|title=Collected Works of John Stuart Mill|edition=Vol. 10|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=241&amp;chapter=21494&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]

For Coleridge, as for many of his romantic contemporaries, the idea that matter itself can begat life only dealt with the various changes in the arrangement of particles and did not explain life itself as a principle or power that lay behind the material manifestations, ''natura naturans'' or "the productive power suspended and, as it were, quenched in the product" Until this were addressed, according to Coleridge, "we have not yet attained to a science of nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This productive power is above sense experience, but not above nature herself, that is, supersensible, but not supernatural, and, thus, not 'occult' as was the case with vitalism. Vitalism failed to distinguish between spirit and nature, and then within nature, between the visible appearances and the invisible, yet very real and not simply hypothesized notion, essence or motivating principle (''natura naturans''). Even Newton spoke of things invisible in themselves (though not in their manifestations), such as force, though Comte, the thorough materialist, complained of the use of such terms as the 'force of gravity' as being relics of animism.&lt;ref name="What Coleridge Thought"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matter was not a 'datum' or thing in and of itself, but rather a product or effect, and for Coleridge, looking at life in its broadest sense, it was the product of a polarity of forces and energies, but derived from a unity which is itself a power, not an abstract or nominal concept, that is Life, and this polar nature of forces within the power of Life is the very law or 'Idea' (in the Platonic sense) of Creation.&lt;ref name="What Coleridge Thought"/&gt;

== Life as polarity/function/motion ==

For Coleridge the essence of the universe is motion and motion is driven by a dynamic polarity of forces that is both inherent in the world as potential and acting inherently in all manifestations. This polarity is the very dynamic that acts throughout all of nature, including into the more particular form of 'life biological', as well as of mind and consciousness.
 
:The tendency having been ascertained, what is its most general law? I answer—polarity, or the essential dualism of Nature, arising out of its productive unity, and still tending to reaffirm it, either as equilibrium, indifference, or identity.&lt;ref name="Theory of Life"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleridge|first1=Samuel Taylor|title=Hints Towards a More Comprehensive Theory of Life|date=1848|publisher=Lea and Blanchard|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=AXcNAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=coleridge+theory+of+life&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vGNTVLG8E8OogwSsvoCgDw&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And this polarity is dynamic, that is real, though not visible, and not simply logical or abstract. Thus, the polarity results in manifestations that are real, as the opposite powers are not contradictory, but counteracting and inter-penetrating.

:...first, that two forces should be conceived which counteract each other by their essential nature; not only not in consequence of the accidental direction of each, but as prior to all direction, nay, as the primary forces from which the conditions of all possible directions are derivative and deducible: secondly, that these forces should be assumed to be both alike infinite, both alike indestructible... this one power with its two inherent indestructible yet counteracting forces, and the results or generations to which their inter-penetration gives existence, in the living principle and in the process of our own self-consciousness.&lt;ref name=BL&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleridge|first1=Samuel Taylor|title=Biographia Literaria|date=1834|publisher=Leavitt, Lord &amp; Company|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=QHdaAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=coleridge+biographia+literaria&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j2RTVMaCA4aeNtPPgMAN&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=biographia%20literaria&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, then, Life itself is not a thing—a self-subsistent hypostasis—but an act and process...&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

And in that sense Coleridge re-phrases the question "What is Life?" to "What is not Life that really is?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This dynamic polar essence of nature in all its functions and manifestations is a universal law in the order of the law of gravity and other physical laws of inert nature. And, critically, this dynamic polarity of constituent powers of life at all levels is not outside or above nature, but is within nature (''natura naturans''), not as a part of the visible product, but as the ulterior natural functions that produce such products or things.

:a Power, acting in and by its Product or Representative to a predetermined purpose is a Function…

:The first product of its energy is the thing itself… Still, however, its productive energy is not exhausted in this product, but overflows, or is effluent, as the specific forces, properties, faculties, of the product. It reappears, in short, as the function of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=34, fn 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is these functions that provided the bridge being sought by Romantic science and medicine, in particular by Andreas Röschlaub and the [[Brunonian system|Brunonian system of medicine]], between the inertial science of inert nature (physics) and the vital science of vital nature (physiology) and its therapeutic application or physic (the domain of the physician).

=== Romanticism and vitalism ===

Coleridge was influenced by German philosophy, in particular Kant, Fichte and Schelling (Naturphilosophie), as well as the physiology of Blumenbach and the dynamic excitation theory of life of the Brunonian system. He sought a path that was neither the mystical tendency of the earlier vitalists nor the materialistic reductionist approach to natural science, but a dynamic one.

:What Coleridge was after was definitely not animism or naive vitalism based on vital substance, or mechanical philosophy based on material substance. He was trying to find a general law...that explicates its self-regulating internal power.&lt;ref name=Hawk&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hawk|first1=Byron|title=A Counter-history of Composition: Toward Methodologies of Complexity|date=2007|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|pages=142–144|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=dnHFgu43x1oC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;lpg=PA281&amp;dq=Coleridge%27s+theory+of+life&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UljAqrEoxP&amp;sig=ojuS_BPEC--PNpfZVQ15yb1PUIs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tfpTVODlMsebNpTGgsgE&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Coleridge%27s%20theory%20of%20life&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coleridge's challenge was to describe something that was dynamic neither in mystical terms not materialistic ones, but via analogy, drawing from the examples of inertial science. As one writer explains, he uses the examples of electricity, magnetism and gravity not because they are like life, but because they offer a way of understanding powers, forces and energies, which lie at the heart of life. And using these analogies, Coleridge seeks to demonstrate that life is not a material force, but a product of relations amongst forces. Life is not linear and static, but dynamic process of self-regulation and [[emergence|Emergent evolution]] that results in increasing complexity and individuation.&lt;ref name=Hawk/&gt; This spiral, upward movement (cf. Goethe's ideas) creates a force for organization that unifies, and is most intense and powerful in that which is most complex and most individual - the self-regulating, enlightened, developed individual mind. But at the same time, this process of life increases interdependence (like the law of comparative advantage in economics) and associational powers of the mind. Thus, he is not talking about an isolated, individual subjective mind, but about the evolution of a higher level of consciousness and thought at the core of the process of life.&lt;ref name=Hawk/&gt;

== Life and liberty ==

And the direction of this motion is towards increasing individuation, that is the creation of specific, individual units of things. At the same time, given the dynamic polarity of the world, there must always be an equal and opposite tendency, in this case, that of connection. So, a given of our experience is that man is both an individual, tending in each life and in history generally to greater and greater individualization, and a social creature seeking interaction and connection. It is the dynamic interplay between the individuation and connecting forces that leads to higher and higher individuation.
 
:By Life I everywhere mean the true Idea of Life,… the tendency to individuation… [which] cannot be conceived without the opposite tendency to connect, even as the centrifugal power supposes the centripetal, or as the two opposite poles constitute each other, and are the constituent acts of one and the same power in the magnet…. Again, if the tendency be at once to individuate and to connect, to detach, but so as either to retain or to reproduce attachment, the individuation itself must be a tendency to the ultimate production of the highest and most comprehensive individuality. This must be the one great end of Nature, her ultimate object, or by whatever other word we may designate that something which bears to a final cause the same relation that Nature herself bears to the Supreme Intelligence.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

== Creative life and vital nature ==

Coleridge makes a further distinction between mathematics and life, the latter being productive or creative, that is, living, and the former ideal. Thus, the mathematical approach that works so well with inert nature, is not suitable for vital nature.

:In its productive power, of which the product is the only measure, consists its incompatibility with mathematical calculus. For the full applicability of an abstract science ceases, the moment reality begins.

:This productive or generative power of life exists in all manifestations of life. These manifestations are the finite product of the dynamic interaction of infinite and non-destructible forces, but the forces are not extinguished in the product - they take on a different role, namely that of functions. Thus, the very nature of the “given” is contained in its manifestations such that the whole is contained in all the parts. 
The counteraction then of the two assumed forces does not depend on their meeting from opposite directions; the power which acts in them is indestructible; it is therefore inexhaustibly re-ebullient; and as something must be the result of these two forces, both alike infinite, and both alike indestructible; and as rest or neutralization cannot be this result; no other conception is possible, but that the product must be a tertium aliquid, [a third thing] or finite generation. Consequently this conception is necessary. Now this tertium aliquid can be no other than an inter-penetration of the counteracting powers, partaking of both… Consequently the 'constituent powers', that have given rise to a body, may then reappear in it as its function: "a Power, acting in and by its Product or Representative to a predetermined purpose is a Function...the first product of its energy is the thing itself: ''ipsa se posuit et iam facta est ens positum''. Still, however, its productive energy is not exhausted in this product, but overflows, or is effluent, as the specific forces, properties, faculties, of the product. It reappears, in short, as the function of the body...The vital functions are consequents of the ''Vis Vitae Principium Vitale'', and presuppose the Organs, as the Functionaries.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

Life, that is, the essential polarity in unity (multeity in unity) in Coleridge’s sense also has a four beat cycle, different from the arid dialectics of abstraction - namely the tension of the polar forces themselves, the charge of their synthesis, the discharge of their product (indifference) and the resting state of this new form (predominance). The product is not a neutralization, but a new form of the essential forces, these forces remaining within, though now as the functions of the form.

:But as little can we conceive the oneness, except as the mid-point producing itself on each side; that is, manifesting itself on two opposite poles. Thus, from identity we derive duality, and from both together we obtain polarity, synthesis, indifference, predominance. (BL)
To make it adequate, we must substitute the idea of positive production for that of rest, or mere neutralization. To the fancy alone it is the null-point, or zero, but to the reason it is the punctum saliens, and the power itself in its eminence.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

== Life and matter ==

This dynamic polarity that is Life is expressed at different levels. At its most basic it is Space-Time, with its product - motion. The interplay of both gives us either a line or a circle, and then there are different degrees possible within a given form or “predominance” of forces. Geometry is not conceivable except as the dynamic interplay of space (periphery) and time (point). Space, time and motion are also geometrically represented by width, length (breadth) and depth. And this correspondence is repeated throughout the scale of Life.

:We have been thus full and express on this subject, because these simple ideas of time, space, and motion, of length, breadth, and depth, are not only the simplest and universal, but the necessary symbols of all philosophic construction. They will be found the primary factors and elementary forms of every calculus and of every diagram in the algebra and geometry of a scientific physiology. Accordingly, we shall recognise the same forms under other names; but at each return more specific and intense; and the whole process repeated with ascending gradations of reality, exempli gratiâ: Time + space = motion; Tm + space = line + breadth = depth; depth + motion = force; Lf + Bf = Df; LDf + BDf = attraction + repulsion = gravitation; and so on, even till they pass into outward phenomena, and form the intermediate link between productive powers and fixed products in light, heat, and electricity.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

Matter, then, is the product of the dynamic forces - repulsion (centrifugal), and attraction (centripetal); it is not itself a productive power. It is also the mass of a given body.
 
:If we pass to the construction of matter, we find it as the product, or tertium aliquid, of antagonist powers of repulsion and attraction. Remove these powers, and the conception of matter vanishes into space—conceive repulsion only, and you have the same result. For infinite repulsion, uncounteracted and alone, is tantamount to infinite, dimensionless diffusion, and this again to infinite weakness; viz., to space. Conceive attraction alone, and as an infinite contraction, its product amounts to the absolute point, viz., to time. Conceive the synthesis of both, and you have matter as a fluxional antecedent, which, in the very act of formation, passes into body by its gravity, and yet in all bodies it still remains as their mass...&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

Coleridge’s understanding of life is contrasted with the materialist view which is essentially reduced to defining life as that which is the opposite of not-life, or that which resists death, that is, that which is life.

:By an easy logic, each of the two divisions has been made to define the others by a mere assertion of their assumed contrariety. The theorist has explained Y+X by informing us that it is the opposite of Y-X: and if we ask, what then is Y-X, we are told that it is the opposite of Y+X! A reciprocation of good services....I turn to a work by the eminent French physiologist, Bichat, where I find this definition: Life is the sum of all the functions by which death is resisted....that is, that life consists in being able to live!...as if four more inveterate abstractions could be brought together than the words life, death, function, and resistance.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

== Cognition and life ==

The problem for Coleridge and the Romantics was that the intellect, 'left to itself' as Bacon stated, was capable of apprehending only the outer forms of nature (natura naturata) and not the inmost, living functions (natura naturans) giving rise to these forms. Thus, effects can only be 'explained' in terms of other effects, not causes. It takes a different capacity to 'see' these living functions, which is an imaginative activity. For Coleridge, there is an innate, primitive or 'primary' imagination that configures invisibly sense-experience into perception, but a rational perception, that is, one raised into consciousness and awareness and then rationally presentable, requires a higher level, what he termed 'secondary imagination', which is able to connect with the thing being experienced, penetrate to its essence in terms of the living dynamics upholding its outer form, and then present the phenomena as and within its natural law, and further, using reason, develop the various principles of its operation.

This cognitive capacity involved what Coleridge termed the 'inmost sense' or what Goethe termed the '''Gemüt'''. It also involved the reactivation of the old Greek noetic capacity, and the ability to 'see' or produce the theory (Greek ''theoria'' from the verb 'to see') dynamic polarities, or natural Laws, the dynamic transcendent (foundational) entities that Plato termed 'Ideas' (''eidos'').

Since ''natura naturata'' is sustained by ''natura naturans'', and the creative power of ''natura naturans'' is one of a kind with the human mind, itself creative, then there must be a correspondence or connection between the mind and the things we perceive, such that we can overcome the apparent separation between the object and the representation in the mind of the object that came to bedevil Enlightenment thought (Hume, Kant). As one commentator noted "to speak at all of the unity of intelligence and nature is of course flatly to contradict Descartes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and evolution ==

For Coleridge the power of life lies in every seed as a potential to be unfolded as a result of interaction with the environment (heat, light, air, moisture, etc.), an insight which allowed him to see in the Brunonian system a dynamic polarity in excitation theory.
 
Coleridge also saw that there was a progressive movement through time and space of life or the law of polarity, from the level of physics (space and time) and the mineral or inert nature (law of gravity, operating through forces of attraction and repulsion), up to man, with his law of resonance in terms of his innate desire to be himself (force of individuation) and to also connect with like-minded (force of connection), as Goethe expressed in his novel ''Elective Affinities'' (''Wahlverwandschaften'') as well as in his own life's experience.
 
Evolution occurred because the original polarity of creation, the very 'Law of Creation', itself gives birth to subsequent polarities, as each pole is itself a unity that can be further polarized (what Wilhelm Reich later termed 'orgonomic functionalism' and what at the biological level constitutes physiology),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; an insight that would later be taken up by the concept of emergent evolution, including the emergence of mind and consciousness.

:the productive power, or ''vis naturans'', which in the sensible world, or n''atura naturata'', is what we mean by the word, nature, when we speak of the same as an agent, is essentially one (that is, of one kind) with the intelligence, which is in the human mind above nature."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And that this is so, is also an intimate and shared experience of all humans, as is set out in Reid's Common Sense philosophy. As Coleridge states

:but for the confidence which we place in the assertions of our reason and our conscience, we could have no certainty of the reality and actual outness of the material world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That nature evolves towards a purpose, and that is the unfolding of the human mind and consciousness in all its levels and degrees, is not teleological but a function of the very nature of the law of polarity or creation itself, namely that of increasing individuation of an original unity, what Coleridge termed 'multeity in unity'. As he states, "without assigning to nature as nature, a conscious purpose" we must still "distinguish her agency from a blind and lifeless mechanism."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

While man contains and is subject to the various laws of nature, man as a self-conscious being is also the summa of a process of creation leading to greater mind and consciousness, that is, a creative capacity of imagination. Instead of being a creature of circumstance, man is the creator of them, or at least has that potential.
 
:Naked and helpless cometh man into the world. Such has been the complaint from eldest time; but we complain of our chief privilege, our ornament, and the connate mark of our sovereignty. Porphyrigeniti summus! …Henceforth he is referred to himself, delivered up to his own charge…&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=29, fn 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2939">A '''Darwin machine''' (a 1987 coinage by [[William H. Calvin]], by [[analogy]] to a [[Turing machine]]) is a machine that, like a Turing machine, involves an [[iteration]] process that yields a high-quality result, but, whereas a Turing machine uses [[logic]], the Darwin machine uses rounds of variation, [[Selection (biology)|selection]], and [[inheritance]].
 
In its original connotation, a Darwin machine is any process that [[Bootstrapping|bootstrap]]s quality by utilizing all of the six essential features of a Darwinian process:  A ''pattern'' is ''copied'' with ''variations'', where populations of one variant pattern ''compete'' with another population, their relative success biased by a ''multifaceted environment'' ([[natural selection]]) so that winners predominate in producing the further variants of the next generation (Darwin's ''inheritance principle'').

More loosely, a Darwin machine is a process that utilizes some subset of the Darwinian essentials, typically [[natural selection]] to create a non-reproducing pattern, as in [[neural Darwinism]]. Many aspects of [[neural development]] utilize overgrowth followed by pruning to a pattern, but the resulting pattern does not itself create further copies.

''Darwin machine'' has been used multiple times to name computer programs after [[Charles Darwin]].

'''Debris''' or '''débris''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|d|ɛ|b|r|iː|,_|ˈ|d|eɪ|b|r|iː}}, {{IPAc-en|US|d|ə|ˈ|b|r|iː}}) is [[rubble]], wreckage, [[ruins]], [[litter]] and discarded [[waste|garbage/refuse/trash]], scattered remains of something destroyed, discarded, or as in geology, large rock fragments left by a melting glacier etc. Depending on context, ''debris'' can refer to a number of different things. The first apparent use of the French  word in English is in a 1701 description of the army of [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] upon its retreat from a battle with the army of Oliver Cromwell, in England.&lt;ref&gt;Warwick, Sir Philip. (1701). Memoires of the Reigne of King Charles I: With a continuation to the happy restoration of King Charles II. London: Ri.Chiswell. p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disaster==
In disaster scenarios, [[tornado]]s leave behind large pieces of houses and mass destruction overall. This debris also flies around the tornado itself when it is in progress. The tornado's winds capture debris it kicks up in its wind orbit, and spins it inside its vortex. The tornado's wind radius is larger than the funnel itself. tsunamis and hurricanes also bring large amounts of debris, such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Earthquakes rock cities to rubble debris.

==Geological==
[[Image:ObsidianDomeCA.JPG|thumb|[[Obsidian]] debris (talus), Obsidian Dome, [[California]].]]
In [[geology]], debris usually applies to the remains of geological activity including [[landslide]]s, [[volcanic]] explosions, [[avalanches]], [[Mudslide|mudflows]] or [[Glacial lake outburst flood]]s (Jökulhlaups) and [[moraine]], [[lahars]], and [[lava]] eruptions. Geological debris sometimes moves in a [[stream]] called a [[debris flow]].  When it accumulates at the base of hillsides, it can be called "talus" or "[[scree]]".

In [[mining]], debris called ''attle'' usually consists of rock fragments which contain little or no ore.

==Marine==
{{Main|marine debris}}
[[Image:Marine debris on Hawaiian coast.jpg|thumb|[[Marine debris]] washed ashore on [[Hawaii]]]]
''Marine debris'' applies to floating garbage such as [[bottles]], [[Tin can|cans]], [[expanded polystyrene foam|styrofoam]], cruise [[ship]] waste, offshore [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[gas]] exploration and production facilities [[pollution]], and [[fishing]] paraphernalia from professional and recreational boaters. Marine debris is also called [[litter]] or [[flotsam and jetsam]]. Objects that can constitute marine debris include used [[automobile]] [[tires]], [[detergent]] [[bottles]], [[medical waste]]s, discarded fishing line and [[Net (device)|nets]], soda cans, and [[bilge]] waste solids.

In addition to being unsightly, it can pose a serious threat to marine life, [[boats]], [[human swimming|swimmers]], [[underwater diving|divers]], and others. For example, each year millions of seabirds, sea [[turtle]]s, [[fish]], and marine [[mammal]]s become entangled in marine debris, or ingest plastics which they have mistaken for food. As many as 30,000 northern fur seals per year get caught in abandoned fishing nets and either drown or suffocate. [[Whales]] mistake [[plastic]] bags for [[squid]], and [[birds]] may mistake plastic pellets for fish [[roe|eggs]]. At other times, animals accidentally eat the plastic while feeding on natural food.

The largest concentration of marine debris is the [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]].

Marine debris most commonly originates from land-based sources. Various international agencies are currently working to reduce marine debris levels around the world.

==Meteorological==
In [[meteorology]], debris usually applies to the remains of [[human]] habitation and natural [[flora (plants)|flora]] after [[storm]] related destruction. This debris is also commonly referred to as '''storm debris'''. Storm debris commonly consists of roofing material, downed [[tree]] [[branch|limbs]], downed [[wikt:signs|signs]], downed [[power line]]s and poles, and wind-blown garbage. Storm debris can become a serious problem immediately after a storm, in that it often blocks access to individuals and communities that may require emergency services. This material frequently exists in such large quantities that disposing of it becomes a serious issue for a community. In addition, storm debris is often hazardous by its very nature, since, for example, downed power lines annually account for storm-related deaths.

==Space==
{{Main|space debris}}
''Space debris'' usually refers to the remains of [[spacecraft]] that have either fallen to [[Earth]] or are still orbiting Earth. Space debris may also consist of natural components such as chunks of [[rock (geology)|rock]] and [[ice]]. The problem of space debris has grown as various space programs have left legacies of launches, explosions, repairs, and discards in both low Earth [[orbit]] and more remote orbits. These orbiting fragments have reached a great enough proportion to constitute a hazard to future space launches of both [[satellite]] and manned vehicles. Various government agencies and international organizations are beginning to track space debris and also research possible solutions to the problem. While many of these  items, ranging in size from [[nut (hardware)|nut]]s and [[Screw|bolts]] to entire satellites and spacecraft, may fall to Earth, other items located in more remote orbits may stay aloft for centuries. The velocity of some of these pieces of space junk have been clocked in excess of 17,000 miles per hour (27,000&amp;nbsp;km/h). A piece of space debris falling to Earth leaves a fiery trail, just like a [[meteor]].

A [[debris disk]] is a circumstellar disk of dust and debris in orbit around a star.

==Surgical==
In [[medicine]], debris usually refers to biological matter that has accumulated or lodged in [[surgical instruments]] and is referred to as '''surgical debris'''. The presence of surgical debris can result in cross-infections or [[nosocomial infection]]s if not removed and the affected surgical instruments or equipment properly [[disinfect]]ed.

==War==
[[Image:Boys Toys edit.jpg|thumb|right|A child plays on an abandoned tank outside [[Phnom Penh]], [[Cambodia]] in 1991]]
In the aftermath of a war, large areas of the region of conflict are often strewn with ''war debris'' in the form of abandoned or destroyed hardware and vehicles, mines, [[unexploded ordnance]], bullet casings and other fragments of metal.

Much war debris has the potential to be lethal and continues to kill and maim civilian populations for years after the end of a conflict. The risks from war debris may be sufficiently high to prevent or delay the return of refugees. In addition war debris may contain hazardous chemicals or radioactive components that can contaminate the land or poison civilians who come into contact with it. Many [[Mine clearance agencies]] are also involved in the clearance of war debris.

[[Land mines]] in particular are very dangerous as they can remain active for decades after a conflict, which is why they have been banned by international war regulations.

In November 2006 the Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title=Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War (Protocol V to the 1980 Convention)
| year=2003
| publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross
| accessdate=2006-06-20
| url=http://www.icrc.org/IHL.nsf/FULL/610?OpenDocument
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
came into effect with 92 countries subscribing to the treaty that requires the parties involved in a conflict to assist with the removal of unexploded ordnance following the end of hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title=War Debris Treaty To Come Into Force in November
| year=2006

| accessdate=2006-06-20
| url=http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?F=1803977&amp;C=mideast
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the countries most affected by war debris are [[Afghanistan]], [[Angola]], [[Cambodia]], [[Iraq]] and [[Laos]].

Similarly ''military debris'' may be found in and around [[firing range]]s and military training areas.

Debris can also be used as [[Cover (military)|cover]] for military purposes, depending on the situation.

==Culinary==
In South Louisiana's [[Louisiana Creole cuisine|Creole]] and [[Cajun]] cultures, debris (pronounced "DAY-bree") refers to chopped organs such as liver, heart, kidneys, tripe, spleen, brain, lungs and pancreas.

'''Dessauite-(Y)''' is a mineral member of the crichtonite group with the formula (Sr,Pb)(Y,U)(Ti,Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;38&lt;/sub&gt;. It is associated with derbylite, hematite, rutile, [[karelianite]], [[siderite]], and [[calcite]]. Founded in the Buca della Vena Mine, Tuscany, Italy, the mineral was called dessauite in honor of professor Gabor Dessau (1907–1983).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.minsocam.org/msa/ammin/toc/Articles_Free/1997/Orlandi_p807-811_97.pdf|title = Dessauite, (Sr,Pb)(Y,U)(Ti,Fe3+)20O38, a new mineral of the crichtonite group from Buca della Vena mine, Tuscany, Italy.|last = Orlandi|first = Paolo|date = 1997|journal = Journal of the Mineralogical Society of America|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Structure==
Dessauite occurs as small, flattened rhombohedral crystals, tabular {001} with hexagonal outline. Members of the Crichtonite group may be confused with ilmenite or hematite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mindat.org/min-29190.html|title = Crichtonite Group|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between dessauite and other minerals in the crichonite group is the occurrence of three additional octahedral sites and of a site in square pyramidal coordination, all with low occupancies. The mineral is black and opaque, presents a metallic luster, and it is brittle. Dessauite presents dimensions of diameter up to 1mm and thickness up to 0.2mm. In reflected plane-polarized light the color is ash-grey with pale bluish tones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The calculated density is 4.68 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The habit is tabular, forming thin dimensions in one direction and hardness of 6.5 and 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dessauite Mineral Data|url = http://www.webmineral.com/data/Dessauite.shtml#.Vl8dlnarTIU|website = www.webmineral.com|accessdate = 2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dessauite differs from other elements of the crichtonite group because of the quantity of cations and X-ray diffraction pattern.

==Occurrence==
Dessauite was found in the Buca della Vena Mine, Apuan Alps, northern Tuscany, Italy, with many other minerals, coming from hydrothermal fluids circulating through a small hematite-barite ore deposit within dolomite, during an alpine metamorphic event. It occurs in calcite veins hosted within dolomite and is associated with calcite, rutile, hematite, siderite, and derbylite.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8836">[[File:Deyrolle, 46 Rue du Bac, 75007 Paris 2013.jpg|thumb]]
During the 20th century, '''Deyrolle''' was a Parisian institution for [[natural science]]s and [[pedagogy]]. It is one of the best known companies of [[entomology]] and [[taxidermy]] of [[Paris]]. Today, Deyrolle is a shop and a [[cabinet of curiosities]] open to the public, a reference in the field of taxidermy, entomology and natural sciences, whose vocation is to show the beauty of Nature. Deyrolle is also involved in pedagogy and art.

== History ==

=== Since 1831 ===
Deyrolle was created in 1831 by '''Jean-Baptiste Deyrolle''', who was soon succeeded by his son [[Achille Deyrolle|Achille]], at 46 rue du Bac in a building constructed in 1697-1699 by Jean-Baptiste Voille for a member of the Bruand family (Libéral Bruand). It was deeply transformed in 1739 by Samuel-Jacques Bernard, son of the banker of Louis XIV, Samuel Bernard (7&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; arrondissement). Beyond its scientific material, minerals collections, seashells, fossils, mounted animals and prehistoric tools, Deyrolle provides pedagogical charts to schools and universities in France, made to illustrate teacher’s lessons. (''Musée scolaire Deyrolle'').

In 2001 Louis Albert de Broglie bought Deyrolle and he restored the shop.

=== The fire of 2008 ===
On February the 1st 2008, the [[Cabinet of curiosities|Cabinet of Curiosities]] was destroyed by a big fire. The cause was probably a short-circuit. A big part of the rooms and of the collections has been destroyed: butterflies, insects, and animals (zebras, alligators, gazelles, bears, lions, shellfish and turtles). On May the 15th 2008, the building was already cleaned and the two rooms of the first floor reopened.

Some artists that contributed to save Deyrolle:

[[Jan Fabre]] - [[Nan Goldin]] - [[Jacques Grange]] - [[Karen Knorr]] - [[Marie-Jo Lafontaine]] - Claude Lalanne - [[Les Lalanne|François-Xavier Lalanne]] - [[Pierre Alechinsky]] - [[Yann Arthus-Bertrand]] - [[Miquel Barceló|Miquel Barcelo]] - Pascal Bernier - Laurent Bochet - [[Sophie Calle]] - [[Johan Creten]] - Marc Dantan - Nicolas Darrot - [[Mark Dion]] - [[Bettina Rheims]] - [[Bernar Venet]] - [[Huang Yong Ping]].

== Pedagogy ==

=== The ancient charts ===
Deyrolle is well known for its '''pedagogical charts'''. It all starts around 1871, when [[Émile Deyrolle|Emile Deyrolle]] developed everything that concerns the educational material, anatomical models in staff, biology pieces, and most of all, the creation of coloured wall charts, published under the name "Musée scolaire Deyrolle". They are meant to teach the "Leçons de choses" ("Lessons of things") but also [[Botany]], [[Zoology]], [[Entomology]], [[Geography]], [[Anatomy]], [[Civics]], [[Physics]], [[Chemistry]], [[Geology]], [[Mineralogy]], [[Biology]], etc.

« ''Visual instruction is the least tiring for the mind, but this education can have good results only if the ideas engraved in the children’s mind are rigorously exact.'' » [[Émile Deyrolle]]

=== Deyrolle pour l'Avenir ===
In 2007, Louis Albert de Broglie restarts the publishing activity with the creation of new educational charts, to tackle contemporary environmental and societal issues. It is the start of a new collection of educational charts published under the name of Deyrolle pour l’Avenir (DPA). There are charts on [[sustainable development]], [[climate change]]s, [[endangered species]], [[renewable energy]], etc.

== The savoir-faire ==

=== Taxidermy ===
Deyrolle is a reference in the field of taxidermy. We can find birds, beasts and mammals from all over the world. At Deyrolle, with only a few exceptions, no animal was killed to be mounted: the non-domestic species come from zoos, parks, where they died of old age or illness. They are traceable, and protected species are held and delivered in accordance with the [[CITES|Washington Convention (CITES)]].

=== Entomology ===
Deyrolle is also known for its entomological collections. The drawers of the entomological room are filled with colourful butterflies, beetles, and other insects. It is possible to see the experts of the entomology team working on the mounting of insects.

== Art ==
The first aim of Deyrolle was to teach [[natural science]]s to children and students, but Deyrolle was a point of interest also for artists: the surrealists [[André Breton]] and [[Salvador Dalí]], the painters [[Jean Dubuffet]] and Mathieu, the writers [[Louise Lévêque de Vilmorin|Louise de Vilmorin]] and [[Théodore Monod]], [[Raymond Queneau]] and many others stopped regularly at the shop.

=== Deyrolle and artists today ===
Today, Deyrolle continues its proximity with artists and the shop welcomes a lot of exhibitions and events during the year: [[Bettina Rheims]], [[Eric Sanders (playwright)|Éric Sander]] or also Charwei Tsai was exhibited at Deyrolle. [[Woody Allen]] used the rooms of Deyrolle in July 2010 for his movie ''[[Midnight in Paris]]'', and [[Wes Anderson]] is a huge fan of the shop.

Deyrolle also develops collaborations with artists. We can mention Aurèle or [[Damien Hirst]], for example.

=== Music ===
In 2005, French singer [[Nolwenn Leroy]] shot the artwork for her album ''[[Histoires Naturelles (album)|Histoires Naturelles]]'' at Deyrolle, as well as the music video for the single "Histoire Naturelle".

=== Exhibitions ===

Received [[radiation]] is unevenly distributed over the planet, because the Sun heats equatorial regions more than polar regions. The atmosphere and ocean work non-stop to even out solar heating imbalances through [[evaporation]] of surface water, convection, rainfall, winds, and ocean circulation. Earth is very close to being in [[radiative equilibrium]], the situation where the incoming solar energy is balanced by an equal flow of heat to space; under that condition, global temperatures will be ''relatively'' stable. Globally, over the course of the year, the Earth system—land surfaces, oceans, and atmosphere—absorbs and then radiates back to space an average of about 240 watts of solar power per square meter. Anything that increases or decreases the amount of incoming or outgoing energy will change global temperatures in response.&lt;ref name="Lindsey 2009"&gt;{{cite journal

However, Earth's energy balance and heat fluxes depend on many factors, such as atmospheric composition (mainly aerosols and greenhouse gases), the [[albedo]] (reflectivity) of surface properties, cloud cover and vegetation and land use patterns.

Changes in surface temperature due to Earth's energy budget do not occur instantaneously, due to the [[inertia]] of the [[ocean]]s and the [[cryosphere]]. The net heat flux is buffered primarily by becoming part of the [[ocean heat content|ocean's heat content]], until a new equilibrium state is established between radiative forcings and the climate response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Energy budget==
[[File:Earth_heat_balance_Sankey_diagram.svg|thumb|250px|left|A [[Sankey diagram]] illustrating the Earth's energy budget described in this section &amp;mdash; line thickness is linearly proportional to relative amount of energy.&lt;ref name="energy_budget" /&gt;]]
In spite of the enormous transfers of energy into and from the Earth, it maintains a relatively constant temperature because, as a whole, there is little net gain or loss: Earth emits via atmospheric and terrestrial radiation (shifted to longer electromagnetic wavelengths) to space about the same amount of energy as it receives via insolation (all forms of electromagnetic radiation).

To quantify Earth's ''heat budget'' or ''heat balance'', let the insolation received at the top of the atmosphere be 100 units (100 units = about 1,360 watts per square meter facing the sun), as shown in the accompanying illustration. Called the [[albedo]] of Earth, around 35 units are reflected back to space: 27 from the top of clouds, 2 from snow and ice-covered areas, and 6 by other parts of the atmosphere. The 65 remaining units are absorbed: 14 within the atmosphere and 51 by the Earth’s surface. These 51 units are radiated to space in the form of terrestrial radiation: 17 directly radiated to space and 34 absorbed by the atmosphere (19 through latent heat of condensation, 9 via convection and turbulence, and 6 directly absorbed). The 48 units absorbed by the atmosphere (34 units from terrestrial radiation and 14 from insolation) are finally radiated back to space. These 65 units (17 from the ground and 48 from the atmosphere) balance the 65 units absorbed from the sun in order to maintain zero net gain of energy by the Earth.&lt;ref name="energy_budget"&gt;

===Incoming radiant energy (shortwave)===

The total amount of energy received per second at the top of [[Earth's atmosphere]] (TOA) is measured in [[watt]]s and is given by the [[solar constant]] times the cross-sectional area of the Earth. Because the surface area of a sphere is four times the cross-sectional surface area of a sphere (i.e. the area of a circle), the average TOA flux is one quarter of the solar constant and so is approximately 340&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Earth's radiation balance and its representation in CMIP5 models|publisher=Copernicus|year=2013|author1=Wild, Martin |author2=Folini, Doris |author3=Schär, Christoph |author4=Loeb, Norman |author5=Dutton, Ellsworth |author6=König-Langlo, Gert |bibcode=2013EGUGA..15.1286W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the absorption varies with location as well as with diurnal, seasonal and annual variations, the numbers quoted are long-term averages, typically averaged from multiple satellite measurements.&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;

Of the ~340&amp;nbsp;W/m² of solar radiation received by the Earth, an average of ~77&amp;nbsp;W/m² is reflected back to space by clouds and the atmosphere and ~23&amp;nbsp;W/m² is reflected by the surface [[albedo]], leaving ~240&amp;nbsp;W/m² of solar energy input to the Earth's energy budget. This gives the earth a mean net albedo of 0.29.&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;

===Earth's internal heat and other small effects===
The [[Earth's internal heat budget|geothermal heat flux]] from the Earth's interior is estimated to be 47 [[terawatt]]s.&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;Davies, J. H., &amp; Davies, D. R. (2010). Earth's surface heat flux. Solid Earth, 1(1), 5–24.&lt;/ref&gt; This comes to 0.087&amp;nbsp;watt/square metre, which represents only 0.027% of Earth's total energy budget at the surface, which is dominated by 173,000 terawatts of incoming [[solar radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ISBN=978-0-470-94341-0|author=Archer, D.|year=2012|title=Global Warming: Understanding the Forecast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World energy consumption|Human production of energy]] is even lower, at an estimated 18 TW.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

[[Photosynthesis]] has a larger effect: [[photosynthetic efficiency]] turns up to 2% of incoming sunlight into [[primary production|biomass]], for a total photosynthetic productivity of earth between ~1500–2250 TW (~1%+/-0.26% solar energy hitting the Earth's surface).&lt;ref name="PLoS"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pisciotta JM, Zou Y, Baskakov IV |title=Light-Dependent Electrogenic Activity of Cyanobacteria |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=e10821 |year=2010 |pmid=20520829 |pmc=2876029 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0010821|bibcode=2010PLoSO...510821P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other minor sources of energy are usually ignored in these calculations, including accretion of [[interplanetary dust]] and [[solar wind]], light from stars other than the Sun and the thermal radiation from space. Earlier, [[Joseph Fourier]] had claimed that deep space radiation was significant in a paper often cited as the first on the [[greenhouse effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=William M. Connolley's page about Fourier 1827: MEMOIRE sur les temperatures du globe terrestre et des espaces planetaires|url=http://www.wmconnolley.org.uk/sci/fourier_1827/|last=Connolley|first=William M.|authorlink=William Connolley|publisher=William M. Connolley|date=18 May 2003|accessdate=5 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Longwave radiation===
{{main|Outgoing longwave radiation}}
Longwave radiation is usually defined as outgoing [[infrared]] energy leaving the planet. However, the atmosphere absorbs parts initially, or cloud cover can reflect radiation. Generally, heat energy is transported between the planet's surface layers (land and ocean) to the atmosphere, transported via [[evapotranspiration]] and [[latent heat]] fluxes or [[thermal conduction|conduction]]/[[convection]] processes.&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;  Ultimately, energy is radiated in the form of longwave [[Infrared#Earth as an infrared emitter|infrared radiation]] back into space.

Recent satellite observations indicate additional precipitation, which is sustained by increased energy leaving the surface through evaporation (the latent heat flux), offsetting increases in longwave flux to the surface.&lt;ref name=SatObsEva /&gt;

==Earth's energy imbalance==
If the incoming energy flux is not equal to the outgoing energy flux, net heat is added to or lost by the planet (if the incoming flux is larger or smaller than the outgoing respectively).

===Indirect measurement===
An imbalance must show in something on Earth warming or cooling (depending on the direction of the imbalance), and the ocean being the larger [[thermal reservoir]] on Earth, is a prime candidate for measurements.

Earth's energy imbalance measurements provided by [[Argo (oceanography)|Argo floats]] have detected an accumulation of [[ocean heat content]] (OHC). The estimated imbalance was measured during a deep [[solar minimum]] of 2005–2010 to be 0.58 ± 0.15&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref name="Imbalance"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=James Hansen |author2=Makiko Sato |author3=Pushker Kharecha |author4=Karina von Schuckmann |publisher=NASA|date=January 2012|url=http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/hansen_16/|title=Earth's Energy Imbalance}}&lt;/ref&gt; This level of detail cannot be inferred directly from measurements of surface energy fluxes, which have combined uncertainties of the order of ± 17&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An update on Earth's energy balance in light of the latest global observations|url = http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v5/n10/full/ngeo1580.html|journal = Nature Geoscience|date = 2012-10-01|issn = 1752-0894|pages = 691–696|volume = 5|issue = 10|doi = 10.1038/ngeo1580|first = Graeme L.|last = Stephens|first2 = Juilin|last2 = Li|first3 = Martin|last3 = Wild|first4 = Carol Anne|last4 = Clayson|first5 = Norman|last5 = Loeb|first6 = Seiji|last6 = Kato|first7 = Tristan|last7 = L'Ecuyer|first8 = Paul W. |last8 = Stackhouse Jr.|first9 = Matthew|last9 = Lebsock|bibcode = 2012NatGe...5..691S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Direct measurement ===
Several [[satellite]]s indirectly measure the energy absorbed and radiated by Earth and by inference the energy imbalance. The [[NASA]] [[Earth Radiation Budget Satellite|Earth Radiation Budget Experiment]] (ERBE) project involves three such satellites: the [[Earth Radiation Budget Satellite]] (ERBS), launched October 1984; NOAA-9, launched December 1984; and NOAA-10, launched September 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icp.giss.nasa.gov/education/radforce/ Effect of the Sun's Energy on the Ocean and Atmosphere (1997)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today NASA's satellite instruments, provided by CERES, part of the NASA's [[Earth Observing System]] (EOS), are designed to measure both solar-reflected and Earth-emitted radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= B.A. Wielicki |display-authors=etal |title=Mission to Planet Earth: Role of Clouds and Radiation in Climate |journal=Bull.

==Natural greenhouse effect==

{{See also|Greenhouse effect}}
The major [[atmosphere of Earth|atmospheric]] gases ([[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]]) are transparent to incoming sunlight but are also transparent to outgoing thermal ([[infrared]]) radiation. However, [[water vapor#Water vapor in Earth.27s atmosphere|water vapor]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]] and other trace gases are opaque to many [[wavelength]]s of thermal radiation. The Earth's surface radiates the net equivalent of 17 percent of the incoming [[solar radiation|solar energy]] in the form of thermal infrared. However, the amount that directly escapes to space is only about 12 percent of incoming solar energy. The remaining fraction, 5 to 6 percent, is absorbed by the atmosphere by [[greenhouse gas]] [[molecule]]s.&lt;ref name="lindsey greenhouse effect p6"&gt;Edited quote from public-domain source: {{citation

[[File:CO2 H2O absorption atmospheric gases unique pattern energy wavelengths of energy transparent to others.png|500px|thumb|Atmospheric gases only absorb some wavelengths of energy but are transparent to others. The absorption patterns of water vapor (blue peaks) and carbon dioxide (pink peaks) overlap in some wavelengths. Carbon dioxide is not as strong a greenhouse gas as water vapor, but it absorbs energy in wavelengths (12–15 micrometres) that water vapor does not, partially closing the "window" through which heat radiated by the surface would normally escape to space. (Illustration NASA, Robert Rohde)&lt;ref name="NASA climate forcings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/EnergyBalance/page7.php|title=NASA: Climate Forcings and Global Warming|date=January 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
When greenhouse gas molecules absorb thermal infrared energy, their temperature rises. Those gases then radiate an increased amount of thermal infrared energy in all directions. Heat radiated upward continues to encounter greenhouse gas molecules; those molecules also absorb the heat, and their temperature rises and the amount of heat they radiate increases. The atmosphere thins with [[altitude]], and at roughly 5–6&amp;nbsp;[[kilometre]]s, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the overlying atmosphere is so thin that heat can escape to space.&lt;ref name="lindsey greenhouse effect p6"/&gt;

Because greenhouse gas molecules radiate infrared energy in all directions, some of it spreads downward and ultimately returns to the Earth's surface, where it is absorbed. The Earth's surface temperature is thus higher than it would be if it were heated only by direct solar heating. This supplemental heating is the natural greenhouse effect.&lt;ref name="lindsey greenhouse effect p6"/&gt; It is as if the Earth is covered by a blanket that allows high frequency radiation (sunlight) to enter, but slows the rate at which the low frequency infrared radiant energy emitted by the Earth leaves.

==Climate sensitivity==
{{Main|Radiative forcing}}
A change in the incident radiated portion of the energy budget is referred to as a [[radiative forcing]].

[[Climate sensitivity]] is the [[steady state]] change in the equilibrium temperature as a result of changes in the energy budget.

===Climate forcings and global warming===
[[File:NASA Hansen Aerosol effect on expected energy imbalance Earth budget.gif|right|300px|thumb|Expected Earth energy imbalance for three choices of aerosol climate forcing. Measured imbalance, close to 0.6 W/m², implies that aerosol forcing is close to −1.6 W/m². (Credit: NASA/GISS)&lt;ref name="Imbalance" /&gt;]]
Climate forcings are changes that cause temperatures to rise or fall, disrupting the energy balance. Natural climate forcings include changes in the Sun's brightness, [[Milankovitch cycles]] (small variations in the shape of Earth's orbit and its axis of rotation that occur over thousands of years) and volcanic eruptions that inject light-reflecting particles as high as the [[stratosphere]]. Man-made forcings include particle pollution ([[aerosols]]) that absorb and reflect incoming sunlight; [[deforestation]], which changes how the surface reflects and absorbs sunlight; and the rising concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which decreases the rate at which heat is radiated to space.

A forcing can trigger [[feedback]]s that intensify ([[positive feedback]]) or weaken ([[negative feedback]]) the original forcing. For example, [[Arctic sea ice decline|loss of ice]] at the poles, which makes them less reflective, causes greater absorption of energy and so increases the rate at which the ice melts, is an example of a positive feedback.&lt;ref name="NASA climate forcings" /&gt;

The observed planetary energy imbalance during the [[solar cycle 24|recent solar minimum]] shows that solar forcing of climate, although natural and significant, is overwhelmed by anthropogenic climate forcing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/hansen_16/|title=NASA GISS: Science Brief: Earth's Energy Imbalance|website=www.giss.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[NASA]] scientists reported that to stop [[global warming]] atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content would have to be reduced to 350&amp;nbsp;ppm or less, assuming all other climate forcings were fixed. The impact of anthropogenic [[aerosols]] has not been quantified, but individual aerosol types are thought to have substantial heating and cooling effects.&lt;ref name="Imbalance" /&gt;

Energy resources bring with them great social and economic promise, providing financial growth for communities and energy services for local economies. However, the infrastructure which delivers energy services can break down in an '''energy accident''', sometimes causing much damage, and '''energy fatalities''' can occur, and with many systems often deaths will happen even when the systems are working as intended.

Historically, [[coal mining]] has been the most dangerous energy activity and the list of historical [[coal]] [[Mining accident|mining disasters]] is a long one. [[Underground mining]] hazards include suffocation, gas poisoning, roof collapse and [[gas]] explosions. [[Open cut mining]] hazards are principally mine wall failures and vehicle collisions. In the US alone, more than 100,000 coal miners have been killed in accidents over the past century,&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125676950 "Former Miner Explains Culture Of Mining.]" NPR: National Public Radio. April 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; with more than 3,200 dying in 1907 alone.&lt;ref name="Coal Mining Steeped in History"&gt;"[http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/Mine/story?id=1475697 Coal Mining Steeped in History]". ABC News. January 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Benjamin K. Sovacool]], 279 ''major'' energy accidents occurred from 1907 to 2007 and they caused 182,156 deaths with $41 billion in property damages, with these figures not including deaths from smaller accidents.&lt;ref name=bksenpol&gt;[[Benjamin K. Sovacool]]. A preliminary assessment of major energy accidents, 1907–2007, ''[[Energy Policy (journal)|Energy Policy]]'' 36 (2008), pp. 1802–1820.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by far the greatest energy fatalities that result from energy generation by humanity, is the creation of [[air pollution]].

According to [[Benjamin K. Sovacool]], while responsible for less than 1 percent of the total number of energy accidents, [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] facilities claimed 94 percent of reported immediate fatalities. Results on immediate fatalities are dominated by one disaster in which  Typhoon Nina in 1975 washed out the [[Shimantan Dam]] (Henan Province, China) and 171,000 people perished.&lt;ref name=bksenpol/&gt; While the other major accident that involved greater than 1000 immediate deaths followed the rupture of the [[1998 Jesse pipeline explosion|NNPC petroleum pipeline]] in 1998 and the resulting explosion.&lt;ref name=bksenpol/&gt; The other singular accident described by Sovacool is the ''predicted'' latent death toll of greater than 1000, as a result of the 1986 [[steam explosion]] at the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl nuclear reactor]] in the Ukraine. With approximately 4000 deaths in total, to eventually result in the decades ahead due to the [[radio-isotope]] pollution released.

In the oil and gas industry, the need for improved [[safety culture]] and training within companies is evidenced by the finding that workers new to a company are more likely to be involved in fatalities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Coal mining accidents resulted in 5,938 immediate deaths in 2005, and 4746 immediate deaths in 2006 in China alone according to the [[World Wildlife Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pozon|first=Ina|author2=Puanani Mench|title=Coming Clean: The future of coal in the Asia-Pacific region|journal=WWF|year=2006|url=http://wwf.panda.org/index.cfm?uNewsID=112520|accessdate=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal mining is the most dangerous occupation in China, the death rate for every 100 tons of coal mined is 100 times that of the death rate in the US and 30 times that achieved in South Africa. Moreover, 600,000 Chinese coal miners, as of 2004, were suffering from [[Coalworker's pneumoconiosis]] (known as "black lung") a disease of the lungs caused by long-continued inhalation of coal dust. And the figure increases by 70,000 miners every year in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-11/13/content_391242.htm|title= Coal mining: Most deadly job in China}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, coal mining has been a very dangerous activity and the list of historical [[coal]] [[mining disasters]] is a long one. In the US alone, more than 100,000 coal miners were killed in accidents over the past century,&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt; with more than 3,200 dying in 1907 alone.&lt;ref name="Coal Mining Steeped in History"/&gt; In the decades following this peak, an annual death toll of 1,500 miner fatalities occurred every year in the US until approximately the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.msha.gov/MSHAINFO/FactSheets/MSHAFCT2.HTM|title= Injury Trends in Mining }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal mining fatalities in the US between 1990 and 2012 have continued to decline, with fewer than 100 each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.msha.gov/MSHAINFO/FactSheets/MSHAFCT10.HTM|title= Mine Safety and Health at a Glance}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See more [[Coal mining disasters in the United States]])

In the United States, in the 2000s, after three decades of regulation on the [[Environmental impact of the coal industry]], including regulations in the 1970s and 1990s from the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], an act created to cut down on pollution related deaths from fossil fuel usage, US [[coal]] fired power plants were estimated, in the 2000s, to continue to cause between 10,000 and 30,000 latent, or air pollution related deaths per year, due to the emissions of [[sulfur dioxide]], [[nitrogen oxides]] and directly emitted [[particulate matter]] that result when coal is burnt.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hks.harvard.edu/m-rcbg/rpp/RFF-DP-12-25.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[World Health Organization]] in 2012, urban outdoor air pollution, from the burning of [[fossil fuel]]s and [[biomass]] is estimated to cause 3 million deaths worldwide per year and indoor air pollution from biomass and fossil fuel burning is estimated to cause approximately 4.3 million premature deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/|title= Air quality and health}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 a team of researchers estimated the number of premature deaths caused by particulate matter in outdoor air pollution as 2.1 million, occurring annually.&lt;ref name="spaceref.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iopscience.iop.org"/&gt;

==Economic costs==
Benjamin Sovacool says that while hydroelectric plants were responsible for the most fatalities,{{Contradict-inline|reason=The table in the Fatalities section above attributes a far higher number of fatalities to fossil fuels|date=June 2017}} [[nuclear power]] plants rank first in terms of their economic cost, accounting for 41 percent of all property damage. Oil and hydroelectric follow at around 25 percent each, followed by natural gas at 9 percent and coal at 2 percent.&lt;ref name=bksenpol/&gt; Excluding Chernobyl and the Shimantan Dam, the three other most expensive accidents involved the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]] (Alaska), The [[Prestige oil spill]] (Spain), and the [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island nuclear accident]] (Pennsylvania).&lt;ref name=bksenpol/&gt; However analysis presented in the international Journal, ''Human and Ecological Risk Assessment'' found that coal, oil, [[Liquid petroleum gas]] and hydro accidents have cost more than nuclear power accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10807030802387556|title=A Comparative Analysis of Accident Risks in Fossil, Hydro, and Nuclear Energy Chains|journal=Human and Ecological Risk Assessment: an International Journal|volume=14|issue=5|pages=947|year=2008|last1=Burgherr|first1=Peter|last2=Hirschberg|first2=Stefan}} See also [http://gabe.web.psi.ch/pdfs/_2012_LEA_Audit/TA01.pdf], p. 968 onwards.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern-day U.S. regulatory agencies frequently implement regulations on conventional pollution if one life or more is predicted saved per $6 million to $8 million of economic costs incurred.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times.

'''Cochlea''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|k|l|i|ə}} is Latin for “snail, shell or screw” and originates from the Greek word κοχλίας ''kohlias''. The modern definition, the auditory portion of the [[inner ear]], originated in the late 17th century. Within the mammalian cochlea exists the [[organ of Corti]], which contains [[hair cell]]s that are responsible for translating the vibrations it receives from surrounding fluid-filled ducts into [[electrical impulse]]s that are sent to the brain to process sound.&lt;ref name=Dugdale /&gt; This spiral-shaped cochlea is estimated to have originated during the early [[Cretaceous Period]], around 120 million years ago.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt; Further, the auditory innervation of the spiral-shaped cochlea also traces back to the Cretaceous period.&lt;ref name=Luo /&gt; The evolution of the human cochlea is a major area of scientific interest because of its favourable representation in the [[fossil]] record.&lt;ref name=Clack /&gt; During the last century, many scientists such as evolutionary biologists and paleontologists strove to develop new methods and techniques to overcome the many obstacles associated with working with ancient, delicate artifacts.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ladeveze /&gt;&lt;ref name=Armstrong /&gt; In the past, scientists were limited in their ability to fully examine specimens without causing damage to them.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt; In more recent times, technologies such as micro-CT scanning became available.&lt;ref name=Ladeveze /&gt; These technologies allow for the visual differentiation between fossilized animal materials and other sedimentary remains.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt; With the use of X-ray technologies, it is possible to ascertain some information about the auditory capabilities of extinct creatures, giving insight to human ancestors as well as their contemporary species.&lt;ref name=Armstrong /&gt;

== Comparative anatomy ==
While the basic structure of the inner ear in [[lepidosaurs]] (lizards and snakes), [[archosaurs]] (birds and crocodilians) and [[mammals]] is similar, and the organs are considered to be homologous, each group has a unique type of auditory organ.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt; The hearing organ arose within the lagenar duct of stem reptiles, lying between the saccular and lagenar epithelia. In lepidosaurs, the hearing organ, the basilar papilla, is generally small, with at most 2000 hair cells, whereas in archosaurs the basilar papilla can be much longer (&gt;10mm in owls) and contain many more hair cells that show two typical size extremes, the short and the tall hair cells. In mammals, the structure is known as the organ of Corti and shows a unique arrangement of hair cells and supporting cells. All mammalian organs of Corti contain a supporting tunnel made up of pillar cells, on the inner side of which there are inner hair cells and outer hair cells on the outer side. The [[definitive mammalian middle ear]] and the elongated cochlea allows for better sensitivity for higher frequencies.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt;

=== Lepidosaurs ===
As in all lepidosaurs and archosaurs, the single-ossicle (columellar) middle ear transmits sound to the footplate of the columella, which sends a pressure wave through the inner ear. In snakes, the basilar papilla is roughly 1mm long and only responds to frequencies below about 1&amp;nbsp;kHz. In contrast, lizards tend to have two areas of hair cells, one responding below and the other above 1&amp;nbsp;kHz. The upper frequency limit in most lizards is roughly 5–8&amp;nbsp;kHz. The longest lizard papillae are about 2mm long and contain 2000 hair cells and their afferent innervating fibers can be very sharply tuned to frequency.&lt;ref name=Manley2 /&gt;

=== Archosaurs ===
In birds and crocodilians, the similarity of the structure of the [[basilar papilla]] betrays their close evolutionary relationship. The basilar papilla is up to about 10mm long and contains up to 16500 hair cells. While most birds have an upper hearing limit of only about 6&amp;nbsp;kHz, the barn owl can hear up to 12&amp;nbsp;kHz and thus close to the human upper limit.&lt;ref name=Koeppl /&gt;

=== Mammals ===
{{See also|Evolution of mammalian auditory ossicles}}
Egg-laying mammals, the monotremes (spiny anteater and platypus), do not have a spiral cochlea, but one shaped more like a banana, up to about 7&amp;nbsp;mm long. Like in lepidosaurs and archosaurs, it contains a lagena, a vestibular sensory epithelium, at its tip. Only in therian mammals (marsupials and placentals) is the cochlea truly coiled 1.5 to 3.5 times. Whereas in monotremes there are many rows of both inner and outer hair cells in the organ of Corti, in therian (marsupial and placental) mammals the number of inner hair-cell rows is one, and there are generally only three rows of outer hair cells.&lt;ref name=Manley2 /&gt;

=== Amphibians ===
Amphibians have unique inner ear structures. There are two sensory papillae involved in hearing, the basilar (higher frequency) and amphibian (lower frequency) papillae, but it is uncertain whether either is homologous to the hearing organs of lepidosaurs, archosaurs and mammals and we have no idea when they arose.&lt;ref name=Romer /&gt;

=== Fish ===
Fish have no dedicated auditory epithelium, but use various vestibular sensory organs that respond to sound. In most teleost fishes it is the saccular macula that responds to sound. In some, such as goldfishes, there is also a special bony connection to the gas bladder that increases sensitivity allowing hearing up to about 4&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name=Romer /&gt;

=== Neanderthals to modern humans ===
The size of cochlea has been measured throughout its evolution based on the fossil record. In one study, the basal turn of the cochlea was measured, and it was hypothesized that cochlear size correlates with body mass. The size of the basal turn of the cochlea was not different in Neanderthals and Holocene humans, however it became larger in early modern humans and Upper Paleolithic humans. Furthermore, the position and orientation of the cochlea is similar between Neanderthals and Holocene humans, relative to plane of the lateral canal, whereas early modern and upper Paleolithic humans have a more superiorly placed cochlea than Holocene humans. When comparing hominins of the Middle Pleistocene and Neanderthals and Holocene humans, the apex of the cochlea faces more inferiorly in the hominins than the latter two groups. Finally, the cochlea of European middle Pleistocene hominins faces more inferiorly than Neanderthals, modern humans, and Homo erectus.&lt;ref name=Spoor /&gt;
Human beings, along with Apes, are the only mammals that do not have high frequency (&gt;32&amp;nbsp;kHz) hearing.&lt;ref name=Spoor /&gt; Humans have long cochleae, but the space devoted to each frequency range is quite large (2.5mm per octave), resulting in a comparatively reduced upper frequency limit.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt; The human cochlea has approximately 2.5 turns around the modiolus (the axis).&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt; Humans, like many mammals and birds, are able to perceive auditory signals that displace the eardrum by a mere picometre.&lt;ref name=Drake /&gt;

== The ear ==
Because of its prominence and preserved state in the fossil record, until recently, the ear had been used to determine phylogeny.&lt;ref name=Clack /&gt; The ear itself contains different portions, including the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear and all of these show evolutionary changes that are often unique to each lineage [14]. It was the independent evolution of a tympanic middle ear in the Triassic era that produced strong selection pressures towards improved hearing organs in the separate lineages of land vertebrates.&lt;ref name=Clack /&gt;

=== Evolutionary perspective ===
The cochlea is the tri-chambered auditory detection portion of the ear, consisting of the scala media, the scala tympani, and the scala vestibuli.&lt;ref name=Romer /&gt; Regarding mammals, placental and marsupial cochleae have similar cochlear responses to auditory stimulation as well as DC resting potentials.&lt;ref name=Fernandez /&gt; This leads to the investigation of the relationship between these therian mammals and researching their ancestral species to trace the origin of the cochlea.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt;

This spiral-shaped cochlea that is in both marsupial and placental mammals is traced back to approximately 120 million years ago.&lt;ref name= Manley /&gt; The development of the most basic basilar papilla (the auditory organ that later evolved into the Organ of Corti in mammals) happened at the same time as the water-to-land transition of vertebrates, approximately 380 million years ago.&lt;ref name=Manley2 /&gt; The actual coiling or spiral nature of the cochlea occurred to save space inside the skull.&lt;ref name=Luo /&gt; The longer the cochlea, the higher is the potential resolution of sound frequencies given the same hearing range.&lt;ref name=Luo /&gt; The oldest of the truly coiled mammalian cochleae were approximately 4&amp;nbsp;mm in length.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt;

The earliest evidence available for primates depicts a short cochlea with prominent laminae, suggesting that they had good high-frequency sensitivity as opposed to low-frequency sensitivity.&lt;ref name=Coleman /&gt; After this, over a period of around 60 million years, evidence suggests that primates developed longer cochleae and less prominent laminae, which means that they had an improvement in low-frequency sensitivity and a decrease in high-frequency sensitivity.&lt;ref name=Coleman /&gt; By the early Miocene period, the cycle of the elongation of the cochleae and the deterioration of the laminae was completed.&lt;ref name=Coleman /&gt; Evidence shows that primates have had an increasing cochlear volume to body mass ratio over time.&lt;ref name=Luo /&gt; These changes in the cochlear labyrinth volume negatively affect the highest and lowest audible frequencies, causing a downward shift.&lt;ref name=Luo /&gt; Non-primates appear to have smaller cochlear labyrinth volumes overall when compared to primates.&lt;ref name=Luo /&gt; Some evidence also suggests that selective forces for the larger cochlear labyrinth may have started after the basal primate node.&lt;ref name=Luo /&gt;
 
Mammals are the subject of a substantial amount of research not only because of the potential knowledge to be gained regarding humans, but also because of their rich and abundant representation in the fossil record.&lt;ref name=Luo2 /&gt; The spiral shape of the cochlea evolved later on in the evolutionary pathway of mammals than previously believed, just before the therians split into the two lineages marsupials and placentals, about 120 million years ago.&lt;ref name=Manley  /&gt;

=== The evolution of prestins ===

Parallel to the evolution of the cochlea, [[prestins]] show an increased rate of evolution in therian mammals. Prestins are located in the outer hair cells of mammalian cochlea and are considered motor proteins. They are found in the hair cells of all vertebrates, including fish, but are thought to have initially been membrane transporter molecules. A high concentration of prestins are found only in the lateral membranes of therian outer hair cells (there is uncertainty with regard to concentrations in monotremes). This high concentration is not found in inner hair cells, and is also lacking in all hair cell types of non-mammals.&lt;ref name=Koeppl2 /&gt;  Prestin also has a role in motility, which evolved a greater importance in the motor function in land vertebrates, but this developed vastly differently in different lineages. In certain birds and mammals, prestins function as both transporters and motors, but the strongest evolution to robust motor dynamics only evolved in therian mammals. It is hypothesized that this motor system is significant to the therian cochlea at high frequencies because of the distinctive cellular and bony composition of the organ of Corti that allows the prestins to intensify movements of the whole structure.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt;
Modern ultra-sound echolocating species such as bats and toothed whales show highly evolved prestins, and these prestins show identical sequence alterations over time. Unusually, the sequences thus apparently evolved independent from each other during different time periods. Furthermore, the evolution of neurotransmitter receptor systems (acetylcholine) that regulate the motor feedback of the outer hair cells coincides with prestin evolution in therians. This suggests that there was a parallel evolution of a control system and a motor system in the inner ear of therian mammals.&lt;ref name=Manley2 /&gt;

=== Homoplasies (convergent evolution) ===
Land vertebrates evolved middle ears independently in each major lineage, and are this the result of parallel evolution.&lt;ref name=Manley2 /&gt; The configurations of the middle ears of monotreme and therian mammals can thus be interpreted as convergent evolution or homoplasy.&lt;ref name=Luo2 /&gt; Thus evidence from fossils demonstrate homoplasies for the detachment of the ear from the jaw.&lt;ref name=Luo2 /&gt; Furthermore, it is apparent that the land-based eardrum, or tympanic membrane, and connecting structures such as the Eustachian tube evolved convergently in multiple different settings as opposed to being a defining morphology.&lt;ref name=Kitazawa /&gt;

The '''extended evolutionary synthesis''' consists of a set of theoretical concepts more comprehensive than the earlier [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of [[evolutionary biology]] that took place between 1918 and 1942. The extended evolutionary synthesis was called for in the 1950s by [[C. H. Waddington]], argued for on the basis of [[punctuated equilibrium]] by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Niles Eldredge]] in the 1980s, and was reconceptualized in 2007 by [[Massimo Pigliucci]] and [[Gerd B. Müller]].

The extended evolutionary synthesis revisits the relative importance of different factors at play, examining several assumptions of the earlier synthesis, and augmenting it with additional causative factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Wade | first1=Michael J | year=2011 | title=The Neo-Modern Synthesis: The Confluence of New Data and Explanatory Concepts | url=http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/61/5/407.full | journal=BioScience | volume=61 | pages=407–408 | doi=10.1525/bio.2011.61.5.10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smee 2015"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laland|first=Kevin N.|last2=Uller|first2=Tobias|last3=Feldman|first3=Marcus W.|last4=Sterelny|first4=Kim|last5=Müller|first5=Gerd B.|last6=Moczek|first6=Armin|last7=Jablonka|first7=Eva|last8=Odling-Smee|first8=John|date=2015-08-22|title=The extended evolutionary synthesis: its structure, assumptions and predictions|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1813/20151019|journal=Proc.

Not all biologists have agreed on the need for, or the scope of, an extended synthesis. Many have collaborated on another synthesis in [[evolutionary developmental biology]], which concetrates on developmental [[molecular genetics]] and [[evolution]] to understand how [[natural selection]] operated on developmental processes and [[deep homology|deep homologies]] between organisms at the level of [[conserved sequence|highly conserved genes]].

==The preceding "modern synthesis"==
[[File:Modern Synthesis.svg|thumb|upright=1.75|Several major ideas about [[evolution]] came together in the [[population genetics]] of the early 20th century to form the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]], including [[genetic variation]], [[natural selection]], and particulate ([[Mendelian genetics|Mendelian]]) inheritance. This ended the [[eclipse of Darwinism]] and supplanted a variety of [[alternatives to Darwinism|non-Darwinian theories of evolution]]. However, it did not unify all of biology, omitting sciences such as [[developmental biology]].]]
{{main|Modern synthesis (20th century)}}

The modern synthesis was the widely accepted early-20th-century synthesis reconciling [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of evolution by [[natural selection]] and [[Gregor Mendel]]'s theory of [[Mendelian genetics|genetics]] in a joint mathematical framework. It established [[evolution]] as [[biology]]'s central [[paradigm#Scientific paradigm|paradigm]]. The 19th-century ideas of [[natural selection]] by Darwin and [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian genetics]] were united by researchers who included [[Ronald Fisher]], one of the three founders of [[population genetics]], and [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and [[Sewall Wright]], between 1918 and 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=National Academy of Sciences |authorlink=National Academy of Sciences |year=1999 |title=Science and Creationism: A View from the National Academy of Sciences |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6024 |edition= 2nd |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=National Academy Press |isbn=0-309-06406-6 |lccn=99006259 |oclc=43803228 |page=28 |quote=The scientific consensus around evolution is overwhelming.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bock |first=Walter J. |date=July 1981 |title=Reviewed Work: ''The Evolutionary Synthesis.

==Early history==

During the 1950s, the English biologist [[C. H. Waddington]] called for an extended synthesis based on his research on [[epigenetics]] and [[genetic assimilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Wilkins | first1=Adam S | year=2008 | title=Waddington's Unfinished Critique of Neo-Darwinian Genetics: Then and Now | url=| journal=Biological Theory | volume=3 | issue=3| pages=224–232 | doi=10.1162/biot.2008.3.3.224}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Pigliucci | first1=Massimo | authorlink=Massimo Pigliucci | display-authors=1 | last2=et al | year=2006 | title=Phenotypic plasticity and evolution by genetic assimilation | url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/209/12/2362.full | journal=Journal of Experimental Biology | volume=209 | issue=| pages=2362–2367 | doi=10.1242/jeb.02070}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huang S. (2011). ''The molecular and mathematical basis of Waddington’s epigenetic landscape: A framework for post-Darwinian biology?'' BioEssays 34: 149-157.&lt;/ref&gt; An extended synthesis was also proposed by the Austrian zoologist [[Rupert Riedl]], with the study of [[evolvability]].&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Günter P; Laubichler; Manfred D. (2004).

''[[Journal of Experimental Zoology]]'' (Mol Dev Evol) 302B: 92-102.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, [[Michael J. D.

White''. Systematic Botany. Vol. 3, No. 1. p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1980s: punctuated equilibrium==

In the 1980s, the American palaeontologists [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Niles Eldredge]] argued for an extended synthesis based on their idea of [[punctuated equilibrium]], the role of species selection shaping large scale evolutionary patterns and [[natural selection]] working on multiple levels extending from genes to species.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, Stephen Jay.

==Contributions from evolutionary developmental biology==
{{main|Evolutionary developmental biology}}

Some researchers in the field of [[evolutionary developmental biology]] proposed another synthesis.

===Predictions===
The extended synthesis is characterized by its additional set of predictions that differ from the standard modern synthesis theory:

# changes in phenotype are predominantly positive, rather than neutral (see: [[neutral theory of molecular evolution]])

===Testing===

The extended evolutionary synthesis is currently being tested by a group of scientists from eight institutions in Britain, Sweden and the United States. The £7.7 million project is supported by a £5.7 million grant from the [[John Templeton Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=|first1=|title=Should Evolutionary Theory Evolve|url=https://www.southampton.ac.uk/news/2016/04/evolution-templeton-grant.page|website=University of Southampton|date=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Laland|first1=Kevin|title=Launching the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis project|url=https://natureecoevocommunity.nature.com/users/24915-kevin-laland/posts/14200-launching-the-extended-evolutionary-synthesis-project|website=Nature Research Ecology &amp; Evolution Community|date=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is headed by [[Kevin Laland|Kevin N. Laland]] at the [[University of St Andrews]] and Tobias Uller at [[Lund University]]. According to Laland what the extended synthesis "really boils down to is recognition that, in addition to selection, drift, mutation and other established evolutionary processes, other factors, particularly developmental influences, shape the evolutionary process in important ways."&lt;ref&gt;[https://evolution-institute.org/empowering-the-extended-evolutionary-synthesis/ "Empowering the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis"]. The Evolution Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status==
Biologists disagree on the need for an extended synthesis. Opponents contend that the modern synthesis is able to fully account for the newer observations, whereas others criticize that the Extended synthesis is not radical enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Craig|first=Lindsay R.|date=2010-06|title=The So-Called Extended Synthesis and Population Genetics|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1162/BIOT_a_00035|journal=Biological Theory|language=en|volume=5|issue=2|pages=117–123|doi=10.1162/biot_a_00035|issn=1555-5542}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents think that the conceptions of evolution at the core of the modern synthesis are too narrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Laland, Kevin, Tobias Uller, Marc Feldman, Kim Sterelny, Gerd B.

For example, [[Denis Noble]] says that using terms and categories of the modern synthesis distort the picture of biology that modern experimentation has discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noble|first1=Denis |authorlink=Denis Noble |title=Evolution Beyond Neo-Darwinism: A New Conceptual Framework|journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology|date=1 January 2015|volume=218|issue=Pt 1|pages=7–13|doi=10.1242/jeb.106310|pmid=25568446 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/218/1/7.long|pmc=4436573}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents therefore claim that the extended synthesis is necessary to help expand the conceptions and framework of how evolution is considered throughout the biological disciplines.&lt;ref name="Smee 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Müller|first=Gerd B.|date=2017-10-06|title=Why an extended evolutionary synthesis is necessary|url=http://rsfs.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/7/5/20170015|journal=Interface Focus|language=en|volume=7|issue=5|pages=20170015|doi=10.1098/rsfs.2017.0015|issn=2042-8898|pmc=5566817|pmid=28839929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13234">Some individuals and organizations have promoted designs for a [[flag]] representing the planet [[Earth]], though none have been officially recognized as such by any governmental body. The most widely recognized flags associated with Earth are the [[flag of the United Nations]] and the [[Earth Day]] flag.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Listed below are some of the unofficial contenders for a Flag of Earth:

==John McConnell's "Earth Day" flag==
[[File:Earth Day Flag.png|thumb|350px|The Earth Day flag, John McConnell's latest proposal]]
[[File:EarthFlag1.svg|thumb|350px|McConnell's original design]]

A flag designed by [[John McConnell (peace activist)|John McConnell]] in 1969 for the first [[Earth Day]] is a dark blue field [[Charge (heraldry)|charged]] with ''[[The Blue Marble]]'', a famous [[NASA]] photo of the [[Earth]] as seen from [[outer space]]. The first edition of McConnell's flag used [[screen-printing]] and used different colors: ocean and land were blue and the clouds were white. McConnell presented his flag to the United Nations as a symbol for consideration.&lt;ref name="Weir"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weir|title=Peace, Justice, Care of Earth|year=2007|publisher=Press On Publishing|isbn=0971749124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the political views of its creator and its having become a symbol of Earth Day, the flag is associated with [[Environmentalism|environmental awareness]], and the celebration of the global community.&lt;ref name="Weir"/&gt; It was offered for sale originally in the ''[[Whole Earth Catalog]]'', and is the only flag which was endorsed by McConnell.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthflag.net |title=Authentic Earth Flag |publisher=Earthflag.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Blue Marble'' image was placed in the public domain, and the public nature of this image was the basis of a legal battle that resulted in the invalidation of a trademark and copyright that was originally issued to the Earth Day flag through its original promotional entity, World Equity, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tabberone.com/Trademarks/CopyrightLaw/Copyrightability/articles/EarthFlagVsAlamoFlag_A.shtml|title=Copyright Law - Copyrightability - Articles - Copyright Protection Not Available for Earth Flag|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This does not invalidate the official history of McConnell's flag, only the official documentation that was issued on it.&lt;ref name="Weir"/&gt;

===One Flag in Space===
The One Flag in Space initiative is an offshoot of the Space Generation Congress (SGC), the Space Generation Advisory Council's yearly world meeting. It promotes usage of the ''Blue Marble'' flag for [[space exploration]] (it does not explicitly mention it being McConnell's design).

==United Nations flag==
[[File:Flag of the United Nations.svg|thumb|350px|The [[Flag of the United Nations]]]]

Adopted in 1946, the [[flag of the United Nations]] has been used to indicate world unity, although it technically only represents the [[United Nations]] itself. It has a geographical representation of the planet, and its high visibility usage makes it a well-known contender for representing Earth. During the planning for NASA's moon landings of the 1960s, it was suggested that a UN flag be used in place of the flag of the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Platoff |first=Anne |title=Where No Flag Has Gone Before: Political and Technical Aspects of Placing a Flag on the Moon (NASA Contractor Report 188251) |publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] |date=August 2003 |url=https://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/flag/flag.htm |accessdate=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="World Peace Flag" of Universal Peace Congress==
{{main|Peace flag#Earth flag}}
[[File:Peace Congress flag.svg|thumb|350px|Van Kirk's World Peace Flag]]

James William van Kirk, a minister from Youngstown, Ohio, designed in 1913 a [[peace flag]] with [[Rainbow flag|rainbow stripes]], stars and a globe. With this flag, he twice made a peace tour through Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Corien Glaudemans, 'Een vredesapostel uit Ohio', in: ''Den Haag Centraal'', 16 oktober 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Universal Peace Congress]] adopted this flag as its World Peace Flag.&lt;ref&gt;Devere Allen, "The Fight for Peace". 1940. p.553.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Olympic flag ==
[[File:Olympic flag.svg|thumb|right|350px|[[Olympic flag]]]]
Designed by [[Pierre de Coubertin]] in 1914 and adopted in [[Olympic games]] since 1920, the [[Olympic flag]] represents all mankind and has a white bar with 5 interlocking rings of 5 colors. The five rings represent the five [[continent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reports/EN/en_report_1303.pdf|title=The Olympic symbols|publisher=[[International Olympic Committee]]|accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The six colors (including the white color of the background) represent all of the world's nations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reports/EN/en_report_1303.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== "World Citizen" flag of World Service Authority ==
[[File:World Citizen Flag.svg|thumb|right|350px|World Citizen flag by Garry Davis]]
The [[Global citizenship#World citizen|World Citizen]] is a [[social movement]] for global [[citizenship]] under a proposed [[world government]]. In 1953, one of its activists, [[Garry Davis]], founded the [[World Service Authority]], which sells the [[World Passport]] (a fantasy travel document) with a proposed flag of the world.&lt;ref name="European Council"&gt;[http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/08/st16/st16225.en08.pdf Table of travel documents entitling the holder to cross the external borders and which may be endorsed with a visa - (Parts II and II) and Part V (documents to which visas cannot be affixed].

===James W. Cadle's "Flag of Earth"===
[[File:Flag of Earth.svg|thumb|350px|Flag of Earth by James Cadle]]
Another Earth flag was created around the same time in 1970 by a farmer from [[Homer, Illinois]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flagofearth.org/flown.html|title=The Flag of Earth - Flown|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; named James W. Cadle. Cadle's version of the Earth flag consists of a blue circle representing Earth in the center of the flag, a segment of a large yellow circle representing the sun and a small white circle for the moon, all on a black background. It is particularly popular amongst [[SETI]] researchers and is used by SETI worldwide. {{cn|date=June 2018}} The flag flies at the [[Ohio State University Radio Observatory]] and was lowered to [[half mast]] when [[Carl Sagan]] died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~carlkop/sagan.html |title=Carl Sagan |publisher=Xs4all.nl |date= |accessdate=2010-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flag of Earth Co. International was also founded by Cadle which sold the flag. The Flag of Earth became [[public domain]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flagofearth.org/original.html|title=James Cadle's Flag of Earth Home Page|last=Cadle|first=James  W.|date=|website=|publisher=North American AstroPhysical Observatory (NAAPO)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-02|quote="The Flag of Earth is now 34-years-old, and on November 1, 2003, became part of the public domain."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Flag is an international flag created in 1988 by Paul Carroll to act as a symbol to inspire "positive global change while continuing to embrace and celebrate cultural diversity.&lt;ref name="WorldFlagProjectVision"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vision|url=http://www.theworldflag.org/vision.php|website=WorldFlagProject.org|publisher=The World Flag Project|accessdate=30 November 2015|ref=World Flag Project Vision}}&lt;/ref&gt;"  The current 2008 version of the combined World Flag has a world map 216 flags; including the flags of every [[Member states of the United Nations|UN member state]], the [[United Nations]], and several territories of larger nations.&lt;ref name=WorldFlagProjectVision /&gt;

The World Flag has been flown at the [[Headquarters of the United Nations|UN Headquarters]] for the ''A Prayer for Peace'' event, [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|The World Trade Center]], [[Earth Day]] in [[Central Park]], and at various other events around the world.&lt;ref name=WorldFlagProjectHistory&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.theworldflag.org/history.php|website=TheWorldFlag.org|publisher=The World Flag Project|accessdate=30 November 2015|ref=WorldFlagProjectHistory}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Custom Flags|url=http://www.australianflagmakers.com.au/custom-made-flags/|publisher=www.australianflagmakers.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oskar Pernefeldt's "International Flag of the Planet Earth"===
[[File:International Flag of Planet Earth.svg|thumb|350px|Oskar Pernefeldt’s proposal]]
In 2015 a Swedish artist, Oskar Pernefeldt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The International Flag of the Planet Earth|url=http://www.flagofplanetearth.com/#intro-shift|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the "International Flag of the Planet Earth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Here’s what the flag of Planet Earth could look like | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2015/05/21/heres-what-the-flag-of-planet-earth-could-look-like/ | accessdate=23 May 2015 | publisher=[[Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was conceived to be used in space expeditions and it has two main purposes: 
# To be used while representing planet Earth.
# To remind the people of Earth that we share this planet, no matter of national boundaries. That we should take care of each other and the planet we live on.

The creators predict that it will be eventually used in Mars landing in 2025 or in a future colony on that planet. The flag is used by space research groups with intent to implanting a base on [[Mars]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://g1.globo.com/fantastico/noticia/2017/11/pesquisador-brasileiro-visita-estacao-no-deserto-que-simula-planeta-marte.html Pesquisador brasileiro visita estação no deserto que simula planeta Marte], [[Fantástico]], November 12, 2017, 4 minutes and 26 seconds of video&lt;/ref&gt; The design of the flag consists of seven rings intersecting each other and a deep-blue-sea in the background. The rings are centered on the flag forming a flower in the middle, representing life on Earth. The intersection of the rings represent that all things on Earth are linked directly or indirectly. The rings are organized in a [[Borromean rings]]–like fashion, representing not only the [[seven continents]], but how no part of Earth can be removed without the whole structure collapsing. Finally, the deep-blue represents the ocean and the importance of water for life on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nusigma {{!}} This Could Become the Official Flag of Planet Earth|url = http://nusigma.in/official-flag-of-planet-earth/|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160210114338/http://nusigma.in/official-flag-of-planet-earth/|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2016-02-10|website = nusigma.in|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thomas Mandl's "One World Flag"===
[[File:OWF_One_World_Flag_by_Thomas_Mandl.svg|thumb|right|350px|One World Flag]]
The One World Flag is a concept published in 2018 by the German activist and visual artist Thomas Mandl. The design of the flag consists of a blue circle on a translucent blank background. Through the usage of [[Sheer fabrics]], the environment blends into the flag background and thus becomes an integral part of the flag design representing the ever-changing nature of culture, society, politics, and environment of the planet earth. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.br.de/puls/themen/welt/one-world-flag-thomas-mandl-interview-100.html|title=One World, one flag|publisher=Bavarian Broadcasting, BR|accessdate=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60541">{{short description|Hypothesis that living organisms interact with their surroundings in a self-regulating system}}
[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumb|The study of planetary habitability is partly based upon extrapolation from knowledge of the [[Earth]]'s conditions, as the Earth is the only planet currently known to harbour life.]]

The '''Gaia hypothesis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|aɪ|.|ə}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|eɪ|.|ə}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|aɪ|ˈ|ʌ}}), also known as the '''Gaia theory''' or the '''Gaia principle''', proposes that living [[organism]]s interact with their [[inorganic]] surroundings on [[Earth]] to form a [[synergistic]] and [[Homeostasis|self-regulating]], [[complex system]] that helps to maintain and perpetuate the conditions for [[life]] on the planet.

The hypothesis was formulated by the chemist [[James Lovelock]]&lt;ref name="J1972" /&gt; and co-developed by the microbiologist [[Lynn Margulis]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="lovelock1974"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lovelock|first1=J.E.|last2=Margulis|first2=L.|title=Atmospheric homeostasis by and for the biosphere: the Gaia hypothesis|journal=Tellus|date=1974|volume=26|series=Series A|issue=1–2|pages=2–10|doi=10.1111/j.2153-3490.1974.tb01946.x|url=http://tellusa.net/index.php/tellusa/article/view/9731|accessdate=20 October 2012|publisher=International Meteorological Institute|location=Stockholm|issn=1600-0870|ref=harv|bibcode=1974Tell...26....2L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelock named the idea after [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], the primordial goddess who personified the Earth in [[Greek mythology]]. In 2006, the [[Geological Society of London]] awarded Lovelock the [[Wollaston Medal]] in part for his work on the Gaia hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wollaston Award Lovelock|url=https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/About/History/Awards-Citations-Replies-2001-Onwards/2006-Awards-Citations-Replies|accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topics related to the hypothesis include how the [[biosphere]] and the [[evolution]] of organisms affect the stability of [[global temperature]], [[salinity]] of [[seawater]], [[atmospheric oxygen]] levels, the maintenance of a [[hydrosphere]] of liquid water and other environmental variables that affect the [[habitability of Earth]].

The Gaia hypothesis was initially criticized for being [[teleological]] and against the principles of [[natural selection]], but later refinements aligned the Gaia hypothesis with ideas from fields such as [[Earth system science]], [[biogeochemistry]] and [[systems ecology]].&lt;ref name="Turney, Jon 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwartzman2002"&gt;{{cite book |author=Schwartzman, David |title=Life, Temperature, and the Earth: The Self-Organizing Biosphere |publisher=Columbia University Press |date=2002 |isbn=0-231-10213-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gribbin, John (1990), "Hothouse earth: The greenhouse effect and Gaia" (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson)&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelock also once described the "geophysiology" of the Earth.&lt;ref name="agesofgaia"&gt;Lovelock, James, (1995) "The Ages of Gaia: A Biography of Our Living Earth" (W.W.Norton &amp; Co)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Explain|date=December 2017}} Even so, the Gaia hypothesis continues to attract criticism, and today some scientists consider it to be only weakly supported by, or at odds with, the available evidence.&lt;ref name="kirchner2002"&gt;{{Citation |last= Kirchner |first = James W. |title =Toward a future for Gaia theory |journal=[[Climatic Change (journal)|Climatic Change]] |volume = 52 |pages = 391–408 |date = 2002 | doi = 10.1023/a:1014237331082 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="volk2002"&gt;{{Citation |last= Volk |first = Tyler |title =The Gaia hypothesis: fact, theory, and wishful thinking |journal = Climatic Change |volume = 52 |pages = 423–430 |date = 2002 | doi = 10.1023/a:1014218227825 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="beerling2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Beerling |first=David |authorlink=David Beerling|date=2007 |title=The Emerald Planet: How plants changed Earth's history |url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780192806024.do |location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press |page= |isbn= 978-0-19-280602-4 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Gaian hypotheses suggest that organisms [[Co-evolution|co-evolve]] with their environment: that is, they "influence their [[abiotic]] environment, and that environment in turn influences the [[Biota (ecology)|biota]] by [[Darwinism|Darwinian process]]". Lovelock (1995) gave evidence of this in his second book, showing the evolution from the world of the early [[Bacteria|thermo-acido-philic]] and [[methanogenic bacteria]] towards the oxygen-enriched [[atmosphere]] today that supports more [[Phanerozoic|complex life]].

A reduced version of the hypothesis has been called "influential Gaia"&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lapenis|first=Andrei G.|year=2002|title=Directed Evolution of the Biosphere: Biogeochemical Selection or Gaia?|url=|journal=The Professional Geographer|volume=54 |issue=3|pages=379–391|via=[Peer Reviewed Journal]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in "Directed Evolution of the Biosphere: Biogeochemical Selection or Gaia?" by Andrei G. Lapenis, which states the [[Biota (ecology)|biota]] influence certain aspects of the abiotic world, e.g. [[temperature]] and atmosphere.  This is not the work of an individual but a collective of Russian scientific research that was combined into this peer reviewed publication. It states the coevolution of life and the environment through “micro-forces”&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; and biogeochemical processes. An example is how the activity of [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] bacteria during Precambrian times have completely modified the [[Earth's atmosphere|Earth atmosphere]] to turn it aerobic, and as such supporting evolution of life (in particular [[eukaryotic]] life).

Since barriers existed throughout the Twentieth Century between Russia and the rest of the world, it is only relatively recently that the early Russian scientists who introduced concepts overlapping the Gaia hypothesis have become better known to the Western scientific community.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; These scientists include:
# [[Piotr Kropotkin|Piotr Alekseevich Kropotkin]] (1842–1921)
# Rafail Vasil’evich Rizpolozhensky (1847–1918)
# [[Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadsky]] (1863–1945)
# Vladimir Alexandrovich Kostitzin (1886–1963)

Biologists and Earth scientists usually view the factors that stabilize the characteristics of a period as an undirected [[emergent property]] or [[entelechy]] of the system; as each individual species pursues its own self-interest, for example, their combined actions may have counterbalancing effects on environmental change. Opponents of this view sometimes reference examples of events that resulted in dramatic change rather than stable equilibrium, such as the conversion of the Earth's atmosphere from a [[reducing environment]] to an [[oxygen]]-rich one at the end of the [[Archean|Archaean]] and the beginning of the [[Proterozoic]] periods.

Less accepted versions of the hypothesis claim that changes in the biosphere are brought about through the [[Superorganism|coordination of living organisms]] and maintain those conditions through [[homeostasis]]. In some versions of [[Gaia philosophy]], all lifeforms are considered part of one single living planetary being called ''Gaia''. In this view, the atmosphere, the seas and the terrestrial crust would be results of interventions carried out by Gaia through the [[Coevolution|coevolving]] diversity of living organisms.

The Gaia hypothesis was an influence on the [[deep ecology]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;David Landis Barnhill, Roger S. Gottlieb (eds.), ''Deep Ecology and World Religions: New Essays on Sacred Ground'', SUNY Press, 2010, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
The Gaia hypothesis posits that the Earth is a self-regulating [[complex system]] involving the [[biosphere]], the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], the [[hydrosphere]]s and the [[pedosphere]], tightly coupled as an evolving system. The hypothesis contends that this system as a whole, called Gaia, seeks a physical and chemical environment optimal for contemporary life.&lt;ref name="vanishing255"&gt;Lovelock, James. ''The Vanishing Face of Gaia''. Basic Books, 2009, p. 255. {{ISBN|978-0-465-01549-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaia evolves through a [[Cybernetic#In biology|cybernetic]] [[feedback]] system operated unconsciously by the [[biota (ecology)|biota]], leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability in a full homeostasis. Many processes in the Earth's surface essential for the conditions of life depend on the interaction of living forms, especially [[microorganisms]], with inorganic elements. These processes establish a global control system that regulates Earth's [[Sea surface temperature|surface temperature]], [[atmosphere composition]] and [[ocean]] [[salinity]], powered by the global thermodynamic disequilibrium state of the Earth system.&lt;ref&gt;Kleidon, Axel. ''How does the earth system generate and maintain thermodynamic disequilibrium and what does it imply for the future of the planet?''. Article submitted to the ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society'' on Thu, 10 Mar 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Article submitted to Royal Society is not a valid reference. This must be replaced by actual article citation if accepted, or an alternative reference --&gt;

The existence of a planetary homeostasis influenced by living forms had been observed previously in the field of [[biogeochemistry]], and it is being investigated also in other fields like [[Earth system science]]. The originality of the Gaia hypothesis relies on the assessment that such homeostatic balance is actively pursued with the goal of keeping the optimal conditions for life, even when terrestrial or external events menace them.&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, James.

===Regulation of global surface temperature===
[[File:All palaeotemps.png|thumb|Rob Rohde's palaeotemperature graphs]]
{{See also|Paleoclimatology}}
Since life started on Earth, the energy provided by the [[Sun]] has increased by 25% to 30%;&lt;ref name="Owen1979"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Owen, T. | author2 = Cess, R.D. | author3 = Ramanathan, V. | date = 1979 | title = Earth: An enhanced carbon dioxide greenhouse to compensate for reduced solar luminosity | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 277 | pages = 640–2 | doi = 10.1038/277640a0 | issue=5698 | bibcode = 1979Natur.277..640O | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the surface temperature of the planet has remained within the levels of habitability, reaching quite regular low and high margins.  Lovelock has also hypothesised that methanogens produced elevated levels of methane in the early atmosphere, giving a view similar to that found in petrochemical smog, similar in some respects to the atmosphere on [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].&lt;ref name="agesofgaia"/&gt; This, he suggests tended to screen out ultraviolet until the formation of the ozone screen, maintaining a degree of homeostasis.  However, the [[Snowball Earth]]&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, P.F. 2001. [http://www.snowballearth.org ''Snowball Earth theory'']&lt;/ref&gt; research has suggested that "oxygen shocks" and reduced methane levels led, during the [[Huronian]], [[Sturtian]] and [[Marinoan]]/[[Cryogenian|Varanger]] Ice Ages, to a world that very nearly became a solid "snowball". These epochs are evidence against the ability of the pre [[Phanerozoic]] biosphere to fully self-regulate.

Processing of the greenhouse gas CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, explained below, plays a critical role in the maintenance of the Earth temperature within the limits of habitability.

The [[CLAW hypothesis]], inspired by the Gaia hypothesis, proposes a [[feedback|feedback loop]] that operates between [[ocean]] [[ecosystem]]s and the [[Earth]]'s [[climate]].&lt;ref name="CLAW87"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/326655a0 |author=[[Robert Jay Charlson|Charlson, R.

Currently the increase in human population and the environmental impact of their activities, such as the multiplication of [[greenhouse gases]] may cause [[negative feedback]]s in the environment to become [[positive feedback]].

====Daisyworld simulations====
[[File:StandardDaisyWorldRun2color.gif|thumb|Plots from a standard black &amp; white [[Daisyworld]] simulation]]
{{Main|Daisyworld}}
James Lovelock and [[Andrew Watson (scientist)|Andrew Watson]] developed the mathematical model [[Daisyworld]], in which temperature regulation arises from a simple ecosystem consisting of two species whose activity varies in response to the planet's environment. The model demonstrates that beneficial feedback mechanisms can emerge in this "toy world" containing only self-interested organisms rather than through classic [[group selection]] mechanisms.&lt;ref name="daisyworld"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daisyworld examines the [[Earth's energy budget|energy budget]] of a planet populated by two different types of plants, black daisies and white daisies. The colour of the daisies influences the [[albedo]] of the planet such that black daisies absorb light and warm the planet, while white daisies reflect light and cool the planet. As the model runs the output of the "sun" increases, meaning that the surface temperature of an uninhabited "gray" planet will steadily rise. In contrast, on Daisyworld competition between the daisies (based on temperature-effects on growth rates) leads to a shifting balance of daisy populations that tends to favour a planetary temperature close to the optimum for daisy growth.

It has been suggested that the results were predictable because Lovelock and Watson selected examples that produced the responses they desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1023/A:1023494111532 | date = 2003 | last1 = Kirchner | first1 = James W. | journal = Climatic Change | volume = 58 |issue=1–2| pages = 21–45 |title=The Gaia Hypothesis: Conjectures and Refutations | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation of oceanic salinity===
Ocean [[salinity]] has been constant at about 3.5% for a very long time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Introduction to Ocean Sciences|last=Segar|first=Douglas|publisher=Library of Congress|year=2012|isbn=978-0-9857859-0-1|location=http://www.reefimages.com/oceans/SegarOcean3Chap05.pdf|pages=Chapter 5 3rd Edition|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salinity stability in oceanic environments is important as most cells require a rather constant salinity and do not generally tolerate values above 5%. The constant ocean salinity was a long-standing mystery, because no process counterbalancing the salt influx from rivers was known. Recently it was suggested&lt;ref name="Gorham19912"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gorham|first=Eville|date=1 January 1991|title=Biogeochemistry: its origins and development|url=https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00002942|journal=Biogeochemistry|publisher=Kluwer Academic|volume=13|issue=3|pages=199–239|doi=10.1007/BF00002942|issn=1573-515X|ref=harv|accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that salinity may also be strongly influenced by [[seawater]] circulation through hot [[basalt]]ic rocks, and emerging as hot water vents on [[mid-ocean ridge]]s. However, the composition of seawater is far from equilibrium, and it is difficult to explain this fact without the influence of organic processes. One suggested explanation lies in the formation of salt plains throughout Earth's history. It is hypothesized that these are created by bacterial colonies that fix ions and heavy metals during their life processes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the biogeochemical processes of the earth, sources and sinks are the movement of elements. The composition of salt ions within our oceans and seas are: sodium (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), chlorine (Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), sulfate (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;), Magnesium (Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) and potassium (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).  The elements that comprise salinity do not readily change and are a conservative property of seawater.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  There are many mechanisms that change salinity from a particulate form to a dissolved form and back. The known sources of sodium i.e. salts is when weathering, erosion, and dissolution of rocks transport into rivers and deposit into the oceans.

The Gaia hypothesis states that the Earth's [[Atmospheric chemistry#Atmospheric composition|atmospheric composition]] is kept at a dynamically steady state by the presence of life.&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, James. ''The Vanishing Face of Gaia''. Basic Books, 2009, p. 163. {{ISBN|978-0-465-01549-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The atmospheric composition provides the conditions that contemporary life has adapted to. All the atmospheric gases other than [[noble gas]]es present in the atmosphere are either made by organisms or processed by them.

The stability of the atmosphere in Earth is not a consequence of [[chemical equilibrium]]. [[Oxygen]] is a reactive compound, and should eventually combine with gases and minerals of the Earth's atmosphere and crust.  Oxygen only began to persist in the atmosphere in small quantities about 50 million years before the start of the [[Great Oxygenation Event]].&lt;ref name=Anabar2007&gt;{{Cite journal| last4 = Arnold| last6 = Creaser| last3 = Lyons| first1 = A. | first2 = Y.| last9 = Scott| last2 = Duan | first3 = T. | first4 = G.| last8 = Gordon | first5 = B. | first10 = J. | first6 = R.| last10 = Garvin | first7 = A.| last11 = Buick | first8 = G. | first11 = R. | first9 = C.| title = A whiff of oxygen before the great oxidation event?| journal = Science| volume = 317| issue = 5846| year = 2007| last7 = Kaufman| pages = 1903–1906| last5 = Kendall| pmid = 17901330| last1 = Anbar | doi = 10.1126/science.1140325|bibcode = 2007Sci...317.1903A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the start of the [[Cambrian]] period, atmospheric oxygen concentrations have fluctuated between 15% and 35% of atmospheric volume.&lt;ref name=Berner1999&gt;{{Cite journal

Recent work on the findings of fire-caused charcoal in Carboniferous and Cretaceous coal measures, in geologic periods when O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; did exceed 25%, has supported Lovelock's contention. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Processing of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;===
{{See also|Carbon cycle}}
Gaia scientists see the participation of living organisms in the [[carbon cycle]] as one of the complex processes that maintain conditions suitable for life. The only significant natural source of [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric carbon dioxide]] ([[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) is [[volcanic activity]], while the only significant removal is through the precipitation of [[carbonate rocks]].&lt;ref name="Karhu1996"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Karhu, J.A. | author2 = Holland, H.D. | date = 1 October 1996 | title = Carbon isotopes and the rise of atmospheric oxygen | journal = [[Geology (journal)|Geology]] | volume = 24 | issue = 10 | pages = 867–870 | url = http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/24/10/867 | doi = 10.1130/0091-7613(1996)024&lt;0867:CIATRO&gt;2.3.CO;2|bibcode = 1996Geo....24..867K | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon precipitation, solution and [[Carbon fixation|fixation]] are influenced by the [[bacteria]] and plant roots in soils, where they improve gaseous circulation, or in coral reefs, where calcium carbonate is deposited as a solid on the sea floor. Calcium carbonate is used by living organisms to manufacture carbonaceous tests and shells. Once dead, the living organisms' shells fall to the bottom of the oceans where they generate deposits of chalk and limestone.

One of these organisms is ''[[Emiliania huxleyi]]'', an abundant [[coccolithophore]] [[algae]] which also has a role in the formation of [[cloud]]s.&lt;ref name="Harding2006"&gt;{{cite book |author=Harding, Stephan |title=Animate Earth |publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing |date=2006 |pages=65 |isbn=1-933392-29-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; excess is compensated by an increase of coccolithophoride life, increasing the amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; locked in the ocean floor. Coccolithophorides increase the cloud cover, hence control the surface temperature, help cool the whole planet and favor precipitations necessary for terrestrial plants.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Lately the atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration has increased and there is some evidence that concentrations of ocean [[algal bloom]]s are also increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | date = 12 September 2007 | title = Interagency Report Says Harmful Algal Blooms Increasing | url = http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases2007/sep07/noaa07-r435.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080209234239/http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases2007/sep07/noaa07-r435.html | archivedate = 9 February 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lichen]] and other organisms accelerate the [[weathering]] of rocks in the surface, while the decomposition of rocks also happens faster in the soil, thanks to the activity of roots, fungi, bacteria and subterranean animals. The flow of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to the soil is therefore regulated with the help of living beings. When CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels rise in the atmosphere the temperature increases and plants grow. This growth brings higher consumption of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by the plants, who process it into the soil, removing it from the atmosphere.

==History==

===Precedents===
[[File:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|thumb|''[[Earthrise]]'' taken from [[Apollo 8]] on December 24, 1968]]
The idea of the Earth as an integrated whole, a living being, has a long tradition. The [[Gaia (mythology)|mythical Gaia]] was the primal Greek goddess personifying the [[Earth]], the Greek version of "[[Mother Nature]]" (from Ge = Earth, and Aia = 
[[PIE]] grandmother), or the [[Earth Mother]]. James Lovelock gave this name to his hypothesis after a suggestion from the novelist [[William Golding]], who was living in the same village as Lovelock at the time ([[Bowerchalke]], [[Wiltshire]], UK). Golding's advice was based on Gea, an alternative spelling for the name of the Greek goddess, which is used as prefix in geology, geophysics and geochemistry.&lt;ref name=vanish09 /&gt; Golding later made reference to Gaia in his [[Nobel prize]] acceptance speech.

In the eighteenth century, as [[geology]] consolidated as a modern science, [[James Hutton]] maintained that geological and biological processes are interlinked.&lt;ref name=CapraWeb&gt;{{cite book |author=Capra, Fritjof |title=The web of life: a new scientific understanding of living systems |publisher=Anchor Books |location=Garden City, N.Y |date=1996 |page=23|isbn=0-385-47675-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the [[naturalist]] and explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]] recognized the coevolution of living organisms, climate, and Earth's crust.&lt;ref name=CapraWeb /&gt; In the twentieth century, [[Vladimir Vernadsky]] formulated a theory of Earth's development that is now one of the foundations of ecology. Vernadsky was a Ukrainian [[geochemist]] and was one of the first scientists to recognize that the oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere result from biological processes. During the 1920s he published works arguing that living organisms could reshape the planet as surely as any physical force. Vernadsky was a pioneer of the scientific bases for the environmental sciences.&lt;ref&gt;S.R. Weart, 2003, ''The Discovery of Global Warming'', Cambridge, Harvard Press&lt;/ref&gt; His visionary pronouncements were not widely accepted in the West, and some decades later the Gaia hypothesis received the same type of initial resistance from the scientific community.

Also in the turn to the 20th century [[Aldo Leopold]], pioneer in the development of modern [[environmental ethics]] and in the movement for [[wilderness]] conservation, suggested a living Earth in his biocentric or holistic ethics regarding land.

{{quotation|It is at least not impossible to regard the earth's parts—soil, mountains, rivers, atmosphere etc,—as organs or parts of organs of a coordinated whole, each part with its definite function. And if we could see this whole, as a whole, through a great period of time, we might perceive not only organs with coordinated functions, but possibly also that process of consumption as replacement which in biology we call metabolism, or growth. In such case we would have all the visible attributes of a living thing, which we do not realize to be such because it is too big, and its life processes too slow.| Aldo Leopold | ''Animate Earth''.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, Stephan.

Another influence for the Gaia hypothesis and the [[environmental movement]] in general came as a side effect of the [[Space Race]] between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. During the 1960s, the first humans in space could see how the Earth looked as a whole. The photograph ''[[Earthrise]]'' taken by astronaut [[William Anders]] in 1968 during the [[Apollo 8]] mission became, through the [[Overview Effect]] an early symbol for the global ecology movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitaljournalist.org/issue0309/lm11.html 100 Photographs that Changed the World by Life - The Digital Journalist]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formulation of the hypothesis===
[[File:James Lovelock in 2005.jpg|thumb|[[James Lovelock]], 2005]]
Lovelock started defining the idea of a self-regulating Earth controlled by the community of living organisms in September 1965, while working at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] in California on methods of detecting [[life on Mars (planet)|life on Mars]].&lt;ref name="Lovelock1965"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lovelock, J.E. | date = 1965 | title = A physical basis for life detection experiments | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 207 | issue = 7 | pages = 568–570 | doi = 10.1038/207568a0 | pmid=5883628|bibcode = 1965Natur.207..568L | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jameslovelock.org/page4.html Geophysiology]&lt;/ref&gt;  The first paper to mention it was ''Planetary Atmospheres: Compositional and other Changes Associated with the Presence of Life'', co-authored with C.E. Giffin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Lovelock, J.E. | author2 = Giffin, C.E. | date = 1969 | title = Planetary Atmospheres: Compositional and other changes associated with the presence of Life | journal = Advances in the Astronautical Sciences | volume = 25 | pages = 179–193 | isbn = 0-87703-028-6 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; A main concept was that life could be detected in a planetary scale by the chemical composition of the atmosphere. According to the data gathered by the [[Pic du Midi de Bigorre|Pic du Midi observatory]], planets like Mars or Venus had atmospheres in [[chemical equilibrium]]. This difference with the Earth atmosphere was considered to be a proof that there was no life in these planets.

Lovelock formulated the ''Gaia Hypothesis'' in journal articles in 1972&lt;ref name="J1972"&gt;{{cite journal | author = J. E.

Lovelock called it first the Earth feedback hypothesis,&lt;ref name="Lovelock01"&gt;{{harvnb|Lovelock, James|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was a way to explain the fact that combinations of chemicals including [[oxygen]] and [[methane]] persist in stable concentrations in the atmosphere of the Earth. Lovelock suggested detecting such combinations in other planets' atmospheres as a relatively reliable and cheap way to detect life.

Later, other relationships such as sea creatures producing sulfur and iodine in approximately the same quantities as required by land creatures emerged and helped bolster the hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=W.D. | last1=Hamilton | first2=T.M. | last2=Lenton | title=Spora and Gaia: how microbes fly with their clouds | journal=Ethology Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume=10 | pages=1–16 | date=1998 | issue=1 | url=http://ejour-fup.unifi.it/index.php/eee/article/viewFile/787/733 | format=PDF | doi=10.1080/08927014.1998.9522867 | ref=harv | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723055017/http://ejour-fup.unifi.it/index.php/eee/article/viewFile/787/733 | archivedate=2011-07-23 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971 [[microbiologist]] Dr. [[Lynn Margulis]] joined Lovelock in the effort of fleshing out the initial hypothesis into scientifically proven concepts, contributing her knowledge about how microbes affect the atmosphere and the different layers in the surface of the planet.&lt;ref name="Turney, Jon 2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Turney, Jon |title=Lovelock and Gaia: Signs of Life |publisher=Icon Books |location=UK |date=2003 |isbn=1-84046-458-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The American biologist had also awakened criticism from the scientific community with her theory on the origin of [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[organelle]]s and her contributions to the [[endosymbiotic theory]], nowadays accepted. Margulis dedicated the last of eight chapters in her book, ''The Symbiotic Planet'', to Gaia. However, she objected to the widespread personification of Gaia and stressed that Gaia is "not an organism", but "an emergent property of interaction among organisms". She defined Gaia as "the series of interacting ecosystems that compose a single huge ecosystem at the Earth's surface. Period". The book's most memorable "slogan" was actually quipped by a student of Margulis': "Gaia is just symbiosis as seen from space".

James Lovelock called his first proposal the ''Gaia hypothesis'' but has also used the term ''Gaia theory''. Lovelock states that the initial formulation was based on observation, but still lacked a scientific explanation. The Gaia hypothesis has since been supported by a number of scientific experiments&lt;ref name="J1990"&gt;{{cite journal | author = J. E. Lovelock | title = Hands up for the Gaia hypothesis | date = 1990 | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 344 | issue = 6262 | pages = 100–2 | doi = 10.1038/344100a0|bibcode = 1990Natur.344..100L | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provided a number of useful predictions.&lt;ref name="Volk2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Volk, Tyler |title=Gaia's Body: Toward a Physiology of Earth |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |date=2003 |isbn=0-262-72042-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, wider research proved the original hypothesis wrong, in the sense that it is not life alone but the whole Earth system that does the regulating.&lt;ref name="vanishing255"/&gt;

===First Gaia conference===
In 1985, the first public symposium on the Gaia hypothesis, ''Is The Earth A Living Organism?'' was held at [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], August 1–6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Joseph |first=Lawrence E. |title=Britain's Whole Earth Guru |work=The New York Times Magazine |date=November 23, 1986 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/23/magazine/britain-s-whole-earth-guru.html |accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal sponsor was the [[National Audubon Society]]. Speakers included James Lovelock, [[George Wald]], [[Mary Catherine Bateson]], [[Lewis Thomas]], [[John Todd (Canadian biologist)|John Todd]], Donald Michael, [[Christopher Bird]], [[Thomas Berry]], [[David Abram]], [[Michael A. Cohen|Michael Cohen]], and William Fields. Some 500 people attended.&lt;ref&gt;Bunyard, Peter (1996), "Gaia in Action: Science of the Living Earth" (Floris Books)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Gaia conference===
In 1988, [[climatology|climatologist]] [[Stephen Schneider]] organised a conference of the [[American Geophysical Union]]. The first Chapman Conference on Gaia,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; was held in San Diego, California on March 7, 1988.

During the "philosophical foundations" session of the conference, [[David Abram]] spoke on the influence of metaphor in science, and of the Gaia hypothesis as offering a new and potentially game-changing metaphorics, while [[James Kirchner]] criticised the Gaia hypothesis for its imprecision. Kirchner claimed that Lovelock and Margulis had not presented one Gaia hypothesis, but four -

* [[Coevolution|CoEvolutionary]] Gaia: that life and the environment had evolved in a coupled way. Kirchner claimed that this was already accepted scientifically and was not new.
* [[Homeostatic]] Gaia: that life maintained the stability of the natural environment, and that this stability enabled life to continue to exist.
* [[Geophysics|Geophysical]] Gaia: that the Gaia hypothesis generated interest in geophysical cycles and therefore led to interesting new research in terrestrial geophysical dynamics.
* Optimising Gaia: that Gaia shaped the planet in a way that made it an optimal environment for life as a whole. Kirchner claimed that this was not testable and therefore was not scientific.

Of Homeostatic Gaia, Kirchner recognised two alternatives. "Weak Gaia" asserted that life tends to make the environment stable for the flourishing of all life. "Strong Gaia" according to Kirchner, asserted that life tends to make the environment stable, ''to enable'' the flourishing of all life. Strong Gaia, Kirchner claimed, was untestable and therefore not scientific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode=1989RvGeo..27..223K | doi = 10.1029/RG027i002p00223 | title=The Gaia hypothesis: Can it be tested? | date=1989 | last1=Kirchner | first1=James W. | journal=Reviews of Geophysics | volume=27 | issue=2 | pages=223 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovelock and other Gaia-supporting scientists, however, did attempt to disprove the claim that the hypothesis is not scientific because it is impossible to test it by controlled experiment. For example, against the charge that Gaia was teleological, Lovelock and Andrew Watson offered the [[Daisyworld]] Model (and its modifications, above) as evidence against most of these criticisms.&lt;ref name="daisyworld"/&gt;  Lovelock said that the Daisyworld model "demonstrates that self-regulation of the global environment can emerge from competition amongst types of life altering their local environment in different ways".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=10968941 | date=2000 | last1=Lenton | first1=TM | last2=Lovelock | first2=JE | title=Daisyworld is Darwinian: Constraints on adaptation are important for planetary self-regulation | volume=206 | issue=1 | pages=109–14 | doi=10.1006/jtbi.2000.2105 | journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovelock was careful to present a version of the Gaia hypothesis that had no claim that Gaia intentionally or consciously maintained the complex balance in her environment that life needed to survive. It would appear that the claim that Gaia acts "intentionally" was a metaphoric statement in his popular initial book and was not meant to be taken literally. This new statement of the Gaia hypothesis was more acceptable to the scientific community. Most accusations of [[teleology|teleologism]] ceased, following this conference.

===Third Gaia conference===
By the time of the 2nd Chapman Conference on the Gaia Hypothesis, held at Valencia, Spain, on 23 June 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simón|first=Federico|title=GEOLOGÍA Enfoque multidisciplinar La hipótesis Gaia madura en Valencia con los últimos avances científicos|journal=El País|date=21 June 2000|url=http://elpais.com/diario/2000/06/21/futuro/961538404_850215.html|accessdate=1 December 2013|language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; the situation had changed significantly. Rather than a discussion of the Gaian teleological views, or "types" of Gaia hypotheses, the focus was upon the specific mechanisms by which basic short term homeostasis was maintained within a framework of significant evolutionary long term structural change.

The major questions were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Information Chapman Conference on the Gaia Hypothesis University of Valencia Valencia, Spain June 19-23, 2000 (Monday through Friday) |url=http://www.agu.org/meetings/chapman/chapman_archive/cc00bcall.html |work=AGU Meetings |accessdate=7 January 2017 |author=American Geophysical Union }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# "How has the global biogeochemical/climate system called Gaia changed in time? What is its history? Can Gaia maintain stability of the system at one time scale but still undergo vectorial change at longer time scales? How can the geologic record be used to examine these questions?"
# "What is the structure of Gaia? Are the feedbacks sufficiently strong to influence the evolution of climate? Are there parts of the system determined pragmatically by whatever disciplinary study is being undertaken at any given time or are there a set of parts that should be taken as most true for understanding Gaia as containing evolving organisms over time? What are the feedbacks among these different parts of the Gaian system, and what does the near closure of matter mean for the structure of Gaia as a global ecosystem and for the productivity of life?"
# "How do models of Gaian processes and phenomena relate to reality and how do they help address and understand Gaia? How do results from Daisyworld transfer to the real world? What are the main candidates for "daisies"? Does it matter for Gaia theory whether we find daisies or not? How should we be searching for daisies, and should we intensify the search? How can Gaian mechanisms be investigated using process models or global models of the climate system that include the biota and allow for chemical cycling?"

In 1997, Tyler Volk argued that a Gaian system is almost inevitably produced as a result of an evolution towards far-from-equilibrium homeostatic states that maximise [[entropy]] production, and Kleidon (2004) agreed stating: "...homeostatic behavior can emerge from a state of MEP associated with the planetary albedo"; "...the resulting behavior of a biotic Earth at a state of MEP may well lead to near-homeostatic behavior of the Earth system on long time scales, as stated by the Gaia hypothesis". Staley (2002) has similarly proposed "...an alternative form of Gaia theory based on more traditional Darwinian principles... In [this] new approach, environmental regulation is a consequence of population dynamics, not Darwinian selection. The role of selection is to favor organisms that are best adapted to prevailing environmental conditions. However, the environment is not a static backdrop for evolution, but is heavily influenced by the presence of living organisms. The resulting co-evolving dynamical process eventually leads to the convergence of equilibrium and optimal conditions".

===Fourth Gaia conference===
A fourth international conference on the Gaia hypothesis, sponsored by the Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority and others, was held in October 2006 at the Arlington, VA campus of George Mason University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaia Theory Conference at George Mason University Law School|url=http://www.arlingtonva.us/departments/Communications/PressReleases/page7530.aspx|accessdate=1 December 2013|author=Official Site of Arlington County Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin Ogle, Chief Naturalist, for NVRPA, and long-time Gaia hypothesis proponent, organized the event.  Lynn Margulis, Distinguished University Professor in the Department of Geosciences, University of Massachusetts-Amherst, and long-time advocate of the Gaia hypothesis, was a keynote speaker. Among many other speakers: Tyler Volk, Co-director of the Program in Earth and Environmental Science at New York University; Dr. Donald Aitken, Principal of Donald Aitken Associates; Dr. Thomas Lovejoy, President of the Heinz Center for Science, Economics and the Environment; Robert Correll, Senior Fellow, Atmospheric Policy Program, American Meteorological Society and noted environmental ethicist, J. Baird Callicott.

This conference approached the Gaia hypothesis as both science and metaphor as a means of understanding how we might begin addressing 21st century issues such as climate change and ongoing environmental destruction.

==Criticism==
After initially being largely ignored by most scientists (from 1969 until 1977), thereafter for a period the initial Gaia hypothesis was criticized by a number of scientists, such as [[Ford Doolittle]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doolittle|first=W. F.|year=1981|title=Is Nature Really Motherly|url=|journal=The Coevolution Quarterly|volume=Spring|pages=58–63|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Dawkins]]&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Extended Phenotype: the Long Reach of the Gene|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1982|isbn=0-19-286088-7|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stephen Jay Gould]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Turney, Jon. "Lovelock and Gaia: Signs of Life" (Revolutions in Science)&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelock has said that because his hypothesis is named after a Greek goddess, and championed by many non-scientists,&lt;ref name="Lovelock01"/&gt; the Gaia hypothesis was interpreted as a [[neo-Pagan]] [[religion]]. Many scientists in particular also criticised the approach taken in his popular book ''Gaia, a New Look at Life on Earth'' for being [[teleology|teleological]]—a belief that things are purposeful and aimed towards a goal. Responding to this critique in 1990, Lovelock stated, "Nowhere in our writings do we express the idea that planetary self-regulation is purposeful, or involves foresight or planning by the [[biota (ecology)|biota]]".

[[Stephen Jay Gould]] criticised Gaia as being "a metaphor, not a mechanism."&lt;ref name="Gould 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gould S.J. |title=Kropotkin was no crackpot |journal=Natural History |volume=106 |pages=12–21 |date=June 1997  |url=http://libcom.org/library/kropotkin-was-no-crackpot |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted to know the actual mechanisms by which self-regulating homeostasis was achieved. In his defense of Gaia, David Abram argues that Gould overlooked the fact that "mechanism", itself, is a metaphor — albeit an exceedingly common and often unrecognized metaphor — one which leads us to consider natural and living systems as though they were machines organized and built from outside (rather than as [[autopoiesis|autopoietic]] or self-organizing phenomena). Mechanical metaphors, according to Abram, lead us to overlook the active or agential quality of living entities, while the organismic metaphorics of the Gaia hypothesis accentuate the active agency of both the biota and the biosphere as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Abram, D. (1988) "The Mechanical and the Organic: On the Impact of Metaphor in Science" in Scientists on Gaia, edited by Stephen Schneider and Penelope Boston, Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildethics.org/essays/the_mechanical_and_the_organic.html |title=The Mechanical and the Organic |accessdate=August 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223165936/http://www.wildethics.org/essays/the_mechanical_and_the_organic.html |archivedate=February 23, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to causality in Gaia, Lovelock argues that no single mechanism is responsible, that the connections between the various known mechanisms may never be known, that this is accepted in other fields of biology and ecology as a matter of course, and that specific hostility is reserved for his own hypothesis for other reasons.&lt;ref name="Lovelock, James 2001"&gt;Lovelock, James (2001), ''Homage to Gaia: The Life of an Independent Scientist'' (Oxford University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from clarifying his language and understanding of what is meant by a life form, Lovelock himself ascribes most of the criticism to a lack of understanding of non-linear mathematics by his critics, and a linearizing form of [[greedy reductionism]] in which all events have to be immediately ascribed to specific causes before the fact. He also states that most of his critics are biologists but that his hypothesis includes experiments in fields outside biology, and that some self-regulating phenomena may not be mathematically explainable.&lt;ref name="Lovelock, James 2001"/&gt;

===Natural selection and evolution===
Lovelock has suggested that global biological feedback mechanisms could evolve by [[natural selection]], stating that organisms that improve their environment for their survival do better than those that damage their environment. However, in the early 1980s, [[Ford Doolittle|W. Ford Doolittle]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] separately argued against Gaia. Doolittle argued that nothing in the [[genome]] of individual organisms could provide the feedback mechanisms proposed by Lovelock, and therefore the Gaia hypothesis proposed no plausible mechanism and was unscientific.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Dawkins meanwhile stated that for organisms to act in concert would require foresight and planning, which is contrary to the current scientific understanding of evolution.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Like Doolittle, he also rejected the possibility that feedback loops could stabilize the system.

[[Lynn Margulis]], a microbiologist who collaborated with Lovelock in supporting the Gaia hypothesis, argued in 1999, that "[[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s grand vision was not wrong, only incomplete. In accentuating the direct competition between individuals for resources as the primary selection mechanism, Darwin (and especially his followers) created the impression that the environment was simply a static arena". She wrote that the composition of the Earth's atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere are regulated around "set points" as in [[homeostasis]], but those set points change with time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Margulis, Lynn. Symbiotic Planet: A New Look At Evolution. Houston: Basic Book 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary biologist [[W. D. Hamilton]] called the concept of Gaia [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]], adding that it would take another [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] to explain how Gaian self-regulation takes place through Darwinian [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name=vanish09&gt;Lovelock, James. ''The Vanishing Face of Gaia''.

===Criticism in the 21st century===
The Gaia hypothesis continues to be broadly skeptically received by the scientific community. For instance, arguments both for and against it were laid out in the journal ''Climatic Change'' in 2002 and 2003. A significant argument raised against it are the many examples where life has had a detrimental or destabilising effect on the environment rather than acting to regulate it.&lt;ref name="kirchner2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="volk2002"/&gt; Several recent books have criticised the Gaia hypothesis, expressing views ranging from "... the Gaia hypothesis lacks unambiguous observational support and has significant theoretical difficulties"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Waltham |first=David |authorlink=David Waltham |date=2014|title=Lucky Planet: Why Earth is Exceptional – and What that Means for Life in the Universe |url=http://www.iconbooks.com/blog/title/lucky-planet/ |location= |publisher=Icon Books |page= |isbn=9781848316560 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to "Suspended uncomfortably between tainted metaphor, fact, and false science, I prefer to leave Gaia firmly in the background"&lt;ref name="beerling2007"/&gt; to "The Gaia hypothesis is supported neither by evolutionary theory nor by the empirical evidence of the geological record".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cockell |first1=Charles |authorlink1=Charles Cockell |last2=Corfield |first2=Richard |last3=Dise |first3= Nancy  |last4=Edwards |first4=Neil  |last5=Harris |first5=Nigel  |date=2008 |title= An Introduction to the Earth-Life System |url= http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/earth-and-environmental-science/palaeontology-and-life-history/introduction-earth-life-system |location=Cambridge (UK) |publisher= Cambridge University Press |page= |isbn= 9780521729536 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[CLAW hypothesis]],&lt;ref name="CLAW87" /&gt; initially suggested as a potential example of direct Gaian feedback, has subsequently been found to be less credible as understanding of [[cloud condensation nuclei]] has improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1= Quinn |first1=P.K. |last2= Bates |first2=T.S. |title =The case against climate regulation via oceanic phytoplankton sulphur emissions |journal =Nature |volume=480 |pages =51–56 |date = 2011 |doi=10.1038/nature10580|bibcode = 2011Natur.480...51Q |pmid=22129724}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the [[Medea hypothesis]] was proposed: that life has highly detrimental (biocidal) impacts on planetary conditions, in direct opposition to the Gaia hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ward (2009), ''The Medea Hypothesis: Is Life on Earth Ultimately Self-Destructive?'', {{ISBN|0-691-13075-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent book-length evaluation of the Gaia hypothesis considering modern evidence from across the various relevant disciplines the author, Toby Tyrrell, concluded that: "I believe Gaia is a dead end. Its study has, however, generated many new and thought provoking questions. While rejecting Gaia, we can at the same time appreciate Lovelock's originality and breadth of vision, and recognise that his audacious concept has helped to stimulate many new ideas about the Earth, and to champion a holistic approach to studying it".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Tyrrell |first=Toby |authorlink= |date= 2013|title= On Gaia: A Critical Investigation of the Relationship between Life and Earth |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9959.html |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=209 |isbn=9780691121581 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere he presents his conclusion "The Gaia hypothesis is not an accurate picture of how our world works".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Tyrrell |first = Toby |title =Gaia: the verdict is… |journal = New Scientist |volume = 220 |pages = 30–31 |date= 26 October 2013 |doi=10.1016/s0262-4079(13)62532-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement needs to be understood as referring to the "strong" and "moderate" forms of Gaia—that the biota obeys a principle that works to make Earth optimal (strength 5) or favourable for life (strength 4) or that it works as a homeostatic mechanism (strength 3). The latter is the "weakest" form of Gaia that Lovelock has advocated. Tyrrell rejects it. However, he finds that the two weaker forms of Gaia—Coeveolutionary Gaia and Influential Gaia, which assert that there are close links between the evolution of life and the environment and that biology affects the physical and chemical environment—are both credible, but that it is not useful to use the term "Gaia" in this sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Tyrrell |first=Toby |authorlink= |date= 2013|title= On Gaia: A Critical Investigation of the Relationship between Life and Earth |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9959.html |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=208 |isbn=9780691121581 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Geologic Clock with events and periods.svg|thumb|right|325px|Geologic time represented in a diagram called a geological clock, showing the relative lengths of the eons of Earth's history and noting major events]]
The '''geological history of Earth''' follows the major events in Earth's past based on the [[geological time scale]], a system of [[Chronological dating|chronological measurement]] based on the study of the planet's rock layers ([[stratigraphy]]). Earth formed [[Age of the Earth|about 4.54 billion years ago]] by accretion from the [[solar nebula]], a disk-shaped mass of dust and gas left over from the formation of the Sun, which also created the rest of the [[Solar System]].

Earth was initially molten due to extreme [[volcanism]] and frequent collisions with other bodies. Eventually, the outer layer of the planet cooled to form a solid [[crust (geology)|crust]] when water began accumulating in the atmosphere. The [[Moon]] formed soon afterwards, possibly as a result of the impact of a planetoid with the Earth. [[Outgassing]] and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere. Condensing [[water vapor]], augmented by ice delivered from [[comet]]s, [[Origin of water on Earth|produced the oceans]].

As the surface continually reshaped itself over hundreds of millions of years, continents formed and broke apart. They [[Plate tectonics|migrated across the surface]], occasionally combining to form a [[supercontinent]]. Roughly {{Ma|750}}, the earliest-known supercontinent [[Rodinia]], began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form [[Pannotia]], {{Ma|600|540}}, then finally [[Pangaea]], which broke apart {{Ma|200}}.

The present pattern of [[ice age]]s began about {{Ma|40}}, then intensified at the end of the [[Pliocene]]. The polar regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating every 40,000–100,000&amp;nbsp;years. The [[last glacial period]] of the [[Quaternary ice age|current ice age]] ended about 10,000&amp;nbsp;years ago.

== Precambrian ==
{{Life timeline}}
{{Main|Precambrian}}
The Precambrian includes approximately 90% of geologic time. It extends from 4.6 billion years ago to the beginning of the Cambrian Period (about 541 [[annum|Ma]]).  It includes three eons, the Hadean, Archean, and Proterozoic.

Major volcanic events altering the Earth's environment and causing extinctions may have occurred 10 times in the past 3 billion years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/earth-rsquo-s-lost-history-of-planet-altering-eruptions-revealed/?WT.mc_id=SA_FB_ENGYSUS_NEWS|title=Earth's Lost History of Planet-Altering Eruptions Revealed|last=Witze|first=Alexandra|work=Scientific American|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hadean Eon ===
{{Main|Hadean}}
[[File:Protoplanetary-disk.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Artist's conception of a [[protoplanetary disc]]]]
During Hadean time (4.6&amp;ndash;4 [[annum|Ga]]), the [[Solar System]] was forming, probably within a large cloud of gas and dust around the sun, called an [[accretion disc]] from which [[History of Earth#Origin|Earth formed]] {{Ma|4500}}.&lt;ref name="age_earth"&gt;{{cite book | first=G.B. | last=Dalrymple | date=1991 | title=The Age of the Earth | publisher=Stanford University Press | location=California | isbn=0-8047-1569-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Hadean Eon is not formally recognized, but it essentially marks the era before we have adequate record of significant solid rocks.

[[Earth]] was initially molten due to extreme [[volcanism]] and frequent collisions with other bodies. Eventually, the outer layer of the planet cooled to form a solid [[crust (geology)|crust]] when water began accumulating in the atmosphere. The [[Moon]] formed soon afterwards, possibly as a result of the [[giant impact hypothesis|impact]] of a large planetoid with the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Canup, R.

Some of the material survived to form an orbiting moon. More recent potassium isotopic studies suggest that the Moon was formed by a smaller, high-energy, high-angular-momentum giant impact cleaving off a significant portion of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=K.|last2=Jacobsen|first2=S.B.|title=Potassium isotopic evidence for a high-energy giant impact origin of the Moon|journal=Nature|date=Sep 12, 2016|doi=10.1038/nature19341|volume=538|pages=487–490|pmid=27617635|bibcode=2016Natur.538..487W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outgassing and [[Volcano|volcanic]] activity produced the primordial atmosphere.

During the Hadean the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] occurred (approximately {{Ma|4100|3800}}) during which a large number of impact craters are believed to have formed on the Moon, and by inference on Earth, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]] and [[Mars]] as well.

=== Archean Eon ===
{{Main|Archean}}
The Earth of the early Archean ({{Ma|4000|2500}}) may have had a different tectonic style. During this time, the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]] cooled enough that rocks and continental plates began to form. Some scientists think because the Earth was hotter, that plate tectonic activity was more vigorous than it is today, resulting in a much greater rate of recycling of crustal material. This may have prevented cratonisation and continent formation until the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] cooled and convection slowed down. Others argue that the subcontinental lithospheric mantle is too buoyant to [[Subduction|subduct]] and that the lack of Archean rocks is a function of [[erosion]] and subsequent [[tectonic]] events.

In contrast to the [[Proterozoic]], Archean rocks are often heavily metamorphized deep-water sediments, such as [[graywacke]]s, [[mudstone]]s, volcanic sediments and [[banded iron formation]]s. [[Greenstone belt]]s are typical Archean formations, consisting of alternating high- and low-grade metamorphic rocks. The high-grade rocks were derived from volcanic [[island arc]]s, while the low-grade metamorphic rocks represent deep-sea sediments eroded from the neighboring island rocks and deposited in a [[forearc|forearc basin]]. In short, greenstone belts represent sutured protocontinents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|pp=302&amp;ndash;303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Earth's [[magnetic field]] was established 3.5 billion years ago. The [[solar wind]] flux was about 100 times the value of the modern [[Sun]], so the presence of the magnetic field helped prevent the planet's atmosphere from being stripped away, which is what probably happened to the [[atmosphere of Mars]]. However, the field strength was lower than at present and the [[magnetosphere]] was about half the modern radius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Staff | title=Oldest measurement of Earth's magnetic field reveals battle between Sun and Earth for our atmosphere | date=March 4, 2010 | work=Physorg.news | url=http://www.physorg.com/news186922627.html | accessdate=2010-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proterozoic Eon ===
{{Main|Proterozoic}}
The geologic record of the Proterozoic ({{Ma|2500|541}}) is more complete than that for the preceding [[Archean]]. In contrast to the deep-water deposits of the Archean, the Proterozoic features many [[stratum|strata]] that were laid down in extensive shallow [[Epeiric Sea|epicontinental seas]]; furthermore, many of these rocks are less [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphosed]] than Archean-age ones, and plenty are unaltered.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|p=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; Study of these rocks show that the eon featured massive, rapid [[continent]]al accretion (unique to the Proterozoic), [[supercontinent cycle]]s, and wholly modern [[orogeny|orogenic]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|pp=315&amp;ndash;318, 329&amp;ndash;332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly {{Ma|750}},&lt;ref name="ICS2008"&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5nDdmUWXk?url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/upload/ISChart2008.pdf International Stratigraphic Chart 2008, International Commission on Stratigraphy]&lt;/ref&gt; the earliest-known supercontinent [[Rodinia]], began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form [[Pannotia]], 600–540&amp;nbsp;Ma.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Murphy, J. B. |author2=Nance, R. D. | title=How do supercontinents assemble? | journal=American Scientist | date=1965 | volume=92 | issue=4 | pages=324–333 | url=http://scienceweek.com/2004/sa040730-5.htm | accessdate=2007-03-05 | doi=10.1511/2004.4.324 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first-known glaciations occurred during the Proterozoic, one began shortly after the beginning of the eon, while there were at least four during the Neoproterozoic, climaxing with the [[Snowball Earth]] of the Varangian glaciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|pp=320&amp;ndash;321, 325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phanerozoic Eon ==
{{Main|Phanerozoic}}
The '''Phanerozoic''' Eon is the current eon in the geologic timescale. It covers roughly 541&amp;nbsp;million years. During this period continents drifted about, eventually collected into a single landmass known as [[Pangea]] and then split up into the current continental landmasses.

The Phanerozoic is divided into three eras – the [[Paleozoic]], the [[Mesozoic]] and the [[Cenozoic]].

Most of biological evolution occurred during this time period.

=== Paleozoic Era ===
{{Main|Paleozoic}}
The '''Paleozoic''' spanned from roughly {{Ma|541|252}} (Ma)&lt;ref name="ICS2015"/&gt; and is subdivided into six [[period (geology)|geologic periods]]; from oldest to youngest they are the [[Cambrian]], [[Ordovician]], [[Silurian]], [[Devonian Period|Devonian]], [[Carboniferous]] and [[Permian]]. Geologically, the [[Paleozoic]] starts shortly after the breakup of a supercontinent called [[Pannotia]] and at the end of a global ice age. Throughout the early Paleozoic, the Earth's landmass was broken up into a substantial number of relatively small continents. Toward the end of the era the continents gathered together into a supercontinent called [[Pangaea]], which included most of the Earth's land area.

==== Cambrian Period ====
{{Main|Cambrian}}
The '''Cambrian''' is a major division of the [[geologic timescale]] that begins about 541.0 ± 1.0 Ma.&lt;ref name="ICS2015"/&gt; [[Cambrian]] continents are thought to have resulted from the breakup of a [[Neoproterozoic]] supercontinent called Pannotia. The waters of the Cambrian period appear to have been widespread and shallow. Continental drift rates may have been anomalously high. [[Laurentia]], [[Baltica]] and [[Siberia]] remained independent continents following the break-up of the supercontinent of Pannotia. [[Gondwana]] started to drift toward the South Pole. [[Panthalassa]] covered most of the southern hemisphere, and minor oceans included the [[Proto-Tethys Ocean]], [[Iapetus Ocean]] and [[Khanty Ocean]].

==== Ordovician period ====
{{Main|Ordovician}}
The '''Ordovician''' period started at a major extinction event called the [[Cambrian–Ordovician extinction event]] some time about 485.4 ± 1.9 Ma.&lt;ref name="ICS2015"/&gt;  During the [[Ordovician]] the southern continents were collected into a single continent called Gondwana. Gondwana started the period in the equatorial latitudes and, as the period progressed, drifted toward the South Pole. Early in the Ordovician the continents Laurentia, Siberia and Baltica were still independent continents (since the break-up of the supercontinent Pannotia earlier), but [[Baltica]] began to move toward Laurentia later in the period, causing the Iapetus Ocean to shrink between them. Also, [[Avalonia]] broke free from Gondwana and began to head north toward Laurentia. The [[Rheic Ocean]] was formed as a result of this. By the end of the period, Gondwana had neared or approached the pole and was largely glaciated.

The Ordovician came to a close in a series of [[extinction event]]s that, taken together, comprise the second-largest of the five major extinction events in [[History of Earth|Earth's history]] in terms of percentage of [[genus|genera]] that became extinct. The only larger one was the Permian-Triassic extinction event. The extinctions occurred approximately {{Ma|447|444}} &lt;ref name="ICS2015"/&gt; and mark the boundary between the Ordovician and the following [[Silurian]] Period.

The most-commonly accepted theory is that these events were triggered by the onset of an [[ice age]], in the Hirnantian faunal stage that ended the long, stable [[greenhouse]] conditions typical of the Ordovician. The ice age was probably not as long-lasting as once thought; study of oxygen [[isotope]]s in fossil brachiopods shows that it was probably no longer than 0.5 to 1.5 million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|p=358}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The event was preceded by a fall in atmospheric carbon dioxide (from 7000ppm to 4400ppm) which selectively affected the shallow seas where most organisms lived. As the southern supercontinent [[Gondwana]] drifted over the South Pole, ice caps formed on it. Evidence of these ice caps have been detected in Upper Ordovician rock strata of North Africa and then-adjacent northeastern South America, which were south-polar locations at the time.

==== Silurian Period ====
{{Main|Silurian}}
The '''Silurian''' is a major division of the [[geologic timescale]] that started about 443.8 ± 1.5 Ma.&lt;ref name="ICS2015"/&gt; During the [[Silurian]], Gondwana continued a slow southward drift to high southern latitudes, but there is evidence that the Silurian ice caps were less extensive than those of the late Ordovician glaciation. The melting of ice caps and glaciers contributed to a rise in [[sea level]]s, recognizable from the fact that Silurian sediments overlie eroded Ordovician sediments, forming an [[unconformity]]. Other [[craton]]s and continent fragments drifted together near the equator, starting the formation of a second supercontinent known as [[Euramerica]]. The vast ocean of Panthalassa covered most of the northern hemisphere. Other minor oceans include Proto-Tethys, Paleo-Tethys, Rheic Ocean, a seaway of Iapetus Ocean (now in between Avalonia and Laurentia), and newly formed [[Ural Ocean]].

==== Devonian Period ====
{{Main|Devonian}}
The '''Devonian''' spanned roughly from 419 to 359 Ma.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;  The period was a time of great tectonic activity, as [[Laurasia]] and Gondwana drew closer together. The continent Euramerica (or Laurussia) was created in the early Devonian by the collision of Laurentia and Baltica, which rotated into the natural dry zone along the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]. In these near-deserts, the [[Old Red Sandstone]] sedimentary beds formed, made red by the oxidized iron ([[hematite]]) characteristic of drought conditions. Near the equator Pangaea began to consolidate from the plates containing North America and Europe, further raising the northern [[Appalachian Mountains]] and forming the [[Caledonian Mountains]] in [[Great Britain]] and [[Scandinavia]]. The southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent of [[Gondwana]]. The remainder of modern Eurasia lay in the Northern Hemisphere. Sea levels were high worldwide, and much of the land lay submerged under shallow seas. The deep, enormous Panthalassa (the "universal ocean") covered the rest of the planet. Other minor oceans were Paleo-Tethys, Proto-Tethys, Rheic Ocean and Ural Ocean (which was closed during the collision with Siberia and Baltica).

==== Carboniferous Period ====
{{Main|Carboniferous}}
The '''Carboniferous''' extends from about 358.9 ± 0.4 to about 298.9 ± 0.15 Ma.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;

A global drop in sea level at the end of the Devonian reversed early in the [[Carboniferous]]; this created the widespread epicontinental seas and carbonate deposition of the [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]]. There was also a drop in south polar temperatures; southern Gondwana was glaciated throughout the period, though it is uncertain if the ice sheets were a holdover from the Devonian or not. These conditions apparently had little effect in the deep tropics, where lush [[coal]] swamps flourished within 30 degrees of the northernmost glaciers. A mid-Carboniferous drop in sea-level precipitated a major marine extinction, one that hit [[crinoid]]s and [[ammonite]]s especially hard. This sea-level drop and the associated unconformity in North America separate the [[Mississippian Period]] from the [[Pennsylvanian period]].&lt;ref name="Stanley, 414"&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|p=414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Carboniferous was a time of active mountain building, as the supercontinent Pangea came together. The southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent Gondwana, which collided with North America-Europe ([[Laurussia]]) along the present line of eastern [[North America]]. This continental collision resulted in the [[Hercynian orogeny]] in Europe, and the [[Alleghenian orogeny]] in North America; it also extended the newly uplifted Appalachians southwestward as the [[Ouachita Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|pp=414&amp;ndash;416}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same time frame, much of present eastern [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] plate welded itself to Europe along the line of the [[Ural mountains]]. There were two major oceans in the Carboniferous the Panthalassa and Paleo-Tethys. Other minor oceans were shrinking and eventually closed the [[Rheic Ocean]] (closed by the assembly of South and North America), the small, shallow [[Ural Ocean]] (which was closed by the collision of [[Baltica]], and [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]] continents, creating the Ural Mountains) and Proto-Tethys Ocean.
[[File:Pangea animation 03.gif|thumb|Pangaea separation animation]]

==== Permian Period ====
{{Main|Permian}}
The '''Permian''' extends from about 298.9 ± 0.15 to 252.17 ± 0.06 Ma.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;

During the [[Permian]] all the Earth's major land masses, except portions of East Asia, were collected into a single supercontinent known as [[Pangaea]]. Pangaea straddled the equator and extended toward the poles, with a corresponding effect on ocean currents in the single great ocean (''[[Panthalassa]]'', the ''universal sea''), and the [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean]], a large ocean that was between Asia and Gondwana. The Cimmeria continent rifted away from Gondwana and drifted north to Laurasia, causing the Paleo-Tethys to shrink. A new ocean was growing on its southern end, the Tethys Ocean, an ocean that would dominate much of the Mesozoic Era. Large continental landmasses create climates with extreme variations of heat and cold ("continental climate") and monsoon conditions with highly seasonal rainfall patterns. [[Desert]]s seem to have been widespread on Pangaea.

=== Mesozoic Era ===
{{Main|Mesozoic}}
[[File:249 global.png|thumb|Plate tectonics- {{Ma|249}}]]
[[File:290 global.png|thumb|Plate tectonics- {{Ma|290}}]]
The '''Mesozoic''' extended roughly from {{Ma|252|Cenozoic}}.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;

After the vigorous convergent plate mountain-building of the late [[Paleozoic]], [[Mesozoic]] tectonic deformation was comparatively mild. Nevertheless, the era featured the dramatic rifting of the supercontinent [[Pangaea]]. Pangaea gradually split into a northern continent, [[Laurasia]], and a southern continent, [[Gondwana]]. This created the [[passive continental margin]] that characterizes most of the [[Atlantic]] coastline (such as along the U.S. East Coast) today.

==== Triassic Period ====
{{Main|Triassic}}
The '''Triassic''' Period extends from about 252.17 ± 0.06 to 201.3 ± 0.2 Ma.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;  During the [[Triassic]], almost all the Earth's land mass was concentrated into a single [[supercontinent]] centered more or less on the equator, called [[Pangaea]] ("all the land"). This took the form of a giant "[[Pac-Man]]" with an east-facing "mouth"  constituting the [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys sea]], a vast gulf that opened farther westward in the mid-Triassic, at the expense of the shrinking [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean]], an ocean that existed during the [[Paleozoic]].

The remainder was the world-ocean known as [[Panthalassa]] ("all the sea"). All the deep-ocean sediments laid down during the Triassic have disappeared through [[subduction]] of oceanic plates; thus, very little is known of the Triassic open ocean. The supercontinent Pangaea was rifting during the Triassic&amp;mdash;especially late in the period&amp;mdash;but had not yet separated. The first nonmarine sediments in the [[rift]] that marks the initial break-up of Pangea&amp;mdash;which separated [[New Jersey]] from [[Morocco]]&amp;mdash;are of Late Triassic age; in the U.S., these thick sediments comprise the [[Newark Supergroup]].&lt;ref name=lasdtri&gt;{{cite web

| title = Triassic world
| accessdate = 2007-07-19

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because of the limited shoreline of one super-continental mass, Triassic marine deposits are globally relatively rare; despite their prominence in [[Western Europe]], where the Triassic was first studied. In [[North America]], for example, marine deposits are limited to a few exposures in the west. Thus Triassic [[stratigraphy]] is mostly based on organisms living in lagoons and hypersaline environments, such as ''Estheria'' crustaceans and terrestrial vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sereno P.

==== Jurassic Period ====
{{Main|Jurassic}}
The '''Jurassic''' Period extends from about 201.3 ± 0.2 to 145.0 Ma.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;
During the early [[Jurassic]], the supercontinent [[Pangaea]] broke up into the northern supercontinent [[Laurasia]] and the southern supercontinent [[Gondwana]]; the [[Gulf of Mexico]] opened in the new rift between North America and what is now [[Mexico]]'s [[Yucatan Peninsula]]. The Jurassic North [[Atlantic Ocean]] was relatively narrow, while the South Atlantic did not open until the following Cretaceous Period, when Gondwana itself rifted apart.&lt;ref name=panjur2&gt;{{cite web

| title = Pangea Begins to Rift Apart

| publisher = C. R. Scotese
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys Sea]] closed, and the [[Mediterranean Basin|Neotethys]] basin appeared. Climates were warm, with no evidence of [[glacier|glaciation]]. As in the Triassic, there was apparently no land near either pole, and no extensive ice caps existed. The Jurassic geological record is good in western [[Europe]], where extensive marine sequences indicate a time when much of the continent was submerged under shallow tropical seas; famous locales include the [[Jurassic Coast]] [[World Heritage Site]] and the renowned late Jurassic ''[[lagerstätte]]n'' of [[Holzmaden]] and [[Solnhofen limestone|Solnhofen]].&lt;ref name=lasdjur&gt;{{cite web

In contrast, the North American Jurassic record is the poorest of the Mesozoic, with few outcrops at the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalatlas.gov/articles/geology/legend/ages/jurassic.html |title=Jurassic Rocks – 208 to 146 million years ago |accessdate=2007-07-19 |work=nationalatlas.gov |publisher=United States Department of the Interior |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140930212425/http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/geology/legend/ages/jurassic.html |archivedate=2014-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the [[Epeiric Sea|epicontinental]] [[Sundance Sea]] left marine deposits in parts of the northern plains of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] during the late Jurassic, most exposed sediments from this period are continental, such as the [[alluvium|alluvial]] deposits of the [[Morrison Formation]]. The first of several massive [[batholith]]s were emplaced in the northern [[American cordillera|Cordillera]] beginning in the mid-Jurassic, marking the [[Nevadan orogeny]].&lt;ref&gt;Monroe and Wicander, 607.&lt;/ref&gt; Important Jurassic exposures are also found in Russia, India, South America, Japan, [[Australasia]] and the United Kingdom.

==== Cretaceous Period ====
{{Main|Cretaceous}}
[[File:100 global.png|thumb|Plate tectonics- 100 Ma,&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt; [[Cretaceous]] period]]
The '''Cretaceous''' Period extends from circa {{Ma|145.0}} to {{Ma|Paleogene}}.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;

During the [[Cretaceous]], the late [[Paleozoic]]-early Mesozoic [[supercontinent]] of [[Pangaea]] completed its breakup into present day [[continent]]s, although their positions were substantially different at the time. As the [[Atlantic Ocean]] widened, the convergent-margin [[orogeny|orogenies]] that had begun during the Jurassic continued in the [[American cordillera|North American Cordillera]], as the [[Nevadan orogeny]] was followed by the [[Sevier orogeny|Sevier]] and [[Laramide orogeny|Laramide orogenies]]. Though Gondwana was still intact in the beginning of the Cretaceous, [[Gondwana]] itself broke up as [[South America]], [[Antarctica]] and [[Australia]] rifted away from [[Africa]] (though [[India]] and [[Madagascar]] remained attached to each other); thus, the South Atlantic and [[Indian Ocean]]s were newly formed. Such active rifting lifted great undersea mountain chains along the welts, raising [[sea level|eustatic sea levels]] worldwide.

To the north of Africa the [[Tethys Sea]] continued to narrow. Broad shallow seas advanced across central [[North America]] (the [[Western Interior Seaway]]) and Europe, then receded late in the period, leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between [[coal]] beds. At the peak of the Cretaceous [[transgression (geology)|transgression]], one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged.&lt;ref&gt;Dougal Dixon et al., ''Atlas of Life on Earth'', (New York: Barnes &amp; Noble Books, 2001), p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cretaceous is justly famous for its [[chalk]]; indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the [[Phanerozoic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mid-ocean ridge]] activity—or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for [[Coccolithophores|calcareous nanoplankton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|pp=279&amp;ndash;281}}&lt;/ref&gt; These widespread [[carbonate]]s and other [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary deposits]] make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine. Famous [[Geologic formation|formations]] from North America include the rich marine fossils of [[Kansas]]'s [[Smoky Hill Chalk|Smoky Hill Chalk Member]] and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous [[Hell Creek Formation]]. Other important Cretaceous exposures occur in [[Europe]] and [[China]]. In the area that is now India, massive [[lava]] beds called the [[Deccan Traps]] were laid down in the very late Cretaceous and early Paleocene.

=== Cenozoic Era ===
{{Main|Cenozoic}}
The '''Cenozoic''' Era covers the {{period start|Cenozoic}}&amp;nbsp;million years since the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] up to and including the present day. By the end of the [[Mesozoic]] era, the continents had rifted into nearly their present form. [[Laurasia]] became [[North America]] and [[Eurasia]], while [[Gondwana]] split into [[South America]], [[Africa]], [[Australia]], [[Antarctica]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]], which collided with the Asian plate. This impact gave rise to the Himalayas. The Tethys Sea, which had separated the northern continents from Africa and India, began to close up, forming the [[Mediterranean sea]].

==== Paleogene Period ====
{{Main|Paleogene}}
The '''Paleogene''' (alternatively '''Palaeogene''') [[geologic period|Period]] is a unit of [[geologic time]] that began {{period start|Paleogene}} and ended 23.03 Ma&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt; and comprises the first part of the [[Cenozoic]] Era. This period consists of the [[Paleocene]], [[Eocene]] and [[Oligocene]] Epochs.

===== Paleocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Paleocene}}
The '''Paleocene''', lasted from {{Ma|Paleocene}} to {{Ma|56.0}}.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;

In many ways, the [[Paleocene]] continued processes that had begun during the late Cretaceous Period. During the Paleocene, the [[continent]]s continued to drift toward their present positions. Supercontinent [[Laurasia]] had not yet separated into three continents. [[Europe]] and [[Greenland]] were still connected. [[North America]] and [[Asia]] were still intermittently joined by a land bridge, while Greenland and North America were beginning to separate.&lt;ref name="Hooker"&gt;Hooker, J.J., "Tertiary to Present: Paleocene", pp. 459-465, Vol. 5. of Selley, Richard C., L. Robin McCocks, and Ian R. Plimer, Encyclopedia of Geology, Oxford: Elsevier Limited, 2005. {{ISBN|0-12-636380-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Laramide orogeny]] of the late Cretaceous continued to uplift the [[Rocky Mountains]] in the American west, which ended in the succeeding epoch. South and North America remained separated by equatorial seas (they joined during the [[Neogene]]); the components of the former southern supercontinent [[Gondwana]] continued to split apart, with [[Africa]], South America, [[Antarctica]] and [[Australia]] pulling away from each other. Africa was heading north toward [[Europe]], slowly closing the [[Tethys Ocean]], and [[India]] began its migration to Asia that would lead to a tectonic collision and the formation of the [[Himalayas]].

===== Eocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Eocene}}
During the '''[[Eocene]]''' ({{Ma|56.0}} - {{Ma|33.9}}),&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt; the continents continued to drift toward their present positions. At the beginning of the period, Australia and Antarctica remained connected, and warm [[equator]]ial currents mixed with colder Antarctic waters, distributing the heat around the world and keeping global temperatures high. But when Australia split from the southern continent around 45 [[annum|Ma]], the warm equatorial currents were deflected away from Antarctica, and an isolated cold water channel developed between the two continents. The Antarctic region cooled down, and the ocean surrounding Antarctica began to freeze, sending cold water and ice floes north, reinforcing the cooling. The present pattern of [[ice age]]s began about {{Ma|40}}.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The northern [[supercontinent]] of [[Laurasia]] began to break up, as [[Europe]], [[Greenland]] and [[North America]] drifted apart. In western North America, [[Orogeny|mountain building]] started in the Eocene, and huge lakes formed in the high flat basins among uplifts. In Europe, the [[Tethys Sea]] finally vanished, while the uplift of the [[Alps]] isolated its final remnant, the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], and created another shallow sea with island [[archipelago]]s to the north. Though the North [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] was opening, a land connection appears to have remained between North America and Europe since the faunas of the two regions are very similar. [[India]] continued its journey away from [[Africa]] and began its collision with [[Asia]], creating the [[Himalaya]]n orogeny.

===== Oligocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Oligocene}}
The '''Oligocene''' Epoch extends from about {{Ma|34}} to {{Ma|23}}.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt; During the [[Oligocene]] the continents continued to drift toward their present positions.

[[Antarctica]] continued to become more isolated and finally developed a permanent [[ice cap]]. [[Orogeny|Mountain building]] in western [[North America]] continued, and the [[Alps]] started to rise in [[Europe]] as the [[African Plate|African plate]] continued to push north into the [[Eurasian plate]], isolating the remnants of [[Tethys Sea]]. A brief marine incursion marks the early Oligocene in Europe. There appears to have been a land bridge in the early Oligocene between [[North America]] and [[Europe]] since the [[Fauna (animals)|faunas]] of the two regions are very similar. During the Oligocene, [[South America]] was finally detached from [[Antarctica]] and drifted north toward [[North America]]. It also allowed the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] to flow, rapidly cooling the continent.

==== Neogene Period ====
{{Main|Neogene}}
The '''Neogene''' Period is a unit of [[geologic timescale|geologic time]] starting 23.03 Ma.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt; and ends at 2.588 Ma.  The Neogene Period follows the [[Paleogene]] Period. The Neogene consists of the [[Miocene]] and [[Pliocene]] and is followed by the [[Quaternary]] Period.

===== Miocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Miocene}}
The '''Miocene''' extends from about 23.03 to 5.333 Ma.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;

During the [[Miocene]] continents continued to drift toward their present positions. Of the modern geologic features, only the land bridge between [[South America]] and [[North America]] was absent, the subduction zone along the [[Pacific Ocean]] margin of South America caused the rise of the [[Andes]] and the southward extension of the [[Meso-American]] peninsula. [[India]] continued to collide with [[Asia]]. The Tethys Seaway continued to shrink and then disappeared as [[Africa]] collided with [[Eurasia]] in the [[Turkey|Turkish]]-[[Arabia]]n region between 19 and 12 [[annum|Ma]] ([[International Commission on Stratigraphy|ICS]] 2004). Subsequent uplift of mountains in the western [[Mediterranean]] region and a global fall in sea levels combined to cause a temporary drying up of the Mediterranean Sea resulting in the [[Messinian salinity crisis]] near the end of the Miocene.

===== Pliocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Pliocene}}
The '''Pliocene''' extends from {{Ma|5.333}} to {{Ma|2.588}}.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;  During the [[Pliocene]] continents continued to drift toward their present positions, moving from positions possibly as far as {{convert|250|km|mi|0}} from their present locations to positions only 70&amp;nbsp;km from their current locations.

South America became linked to North America through the [[Isthmus of Panama]] during the Pliocene, bringing a nearly complete end to South America's distinctive [[Marsupialia|marsupial]] faunas. The formation of the Isthmus had major consequences on global temperatures, since warm equatorial ocean currents were cut off and an Atlantic cooling cycle began, with cold Arctic and Antarctic waters dropping temperatures in the now-isolated Atlantic Ocean. [[Africa]]'s collision with [[Europe]] formed the [[Mediterranean Sea]], cutting off the remnants of the [[Tethys Ocean]]. Sea level changes exposed the land-bridge between [[Alaska]] and Asia. Near the end of the Pliocene, about {{Ma|2.58}} (the start of the Quaternary Period), the [[Quaternary glaciation|current ice age]] began. The polar regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating every 40,000–100,000&amp;nbsp;years.

==== Quaternary Period ====
{{Main|Quaternary}}

===== Pleistocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Pleistocene}}
The '''Pleistocene''' extends from {{Ma|2.588}} to 11,700 years before present.&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt;  The modern [[continent]]s were essentially at their present positions during the [[Pleistocene]], the [[tectonic plate|plates]] upon which they sit probably having moved no more than {{convert|100|km|mi|0}} relative to each other since the beginning of the period.

===== Holocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Holocene}}
[[File:Earth dry elevation.stl|thumb|right|Current Earth - without water (click/enlarge to "spin" 3D-globe).]]
The '''Holocene''' Epoch began approximately 11,700 calendar years before present&lt;ref name="ICS2015" /&gt; and continues to the present. During the [[Holocene]], continental motions have been less than a kilometer.

The [[last glacial period]] of the [[Quaternary ice age|current ice age]] ended about 10,000&amp;nbsp;years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Staff | url = http://www.lakepowell.net/sciencecenter/paleoclimate.htm | title = Paleoclimatology - The Study of Ancient Climates | publisher = Page Paleontology Science Center | accessdate = 2007-03-02 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/617EaUwHQ?url=http://www.lakepowell.net/sciencecenter/paleoclimate.htm | archivedate = 2011-08-22 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ice melt caused world [[Sea level rise|sea levels to rise]] about {{convert|35|m|ft|0}} in the early part of the Holocene. In addition, many areas above about [[40th parallel north|40 degrees north]] latitude had been depressed by the weight of the Pleistocene [[glacier]]s and rose as much as {{convert|180|m|ft|0}} over the late Pleistocene and Holocene, and are still rising today. The sea level rise and temporary land depression allowed temporary marine incursions into areas that are now far from the sea. Holocene marine fossils are known from [[Vermont]], [[Quebec]], [[Ontario]] and [[Michigan]]. Other than higher latitude temporary marine incursions associated with glacial depression, Holocene fossils are found primarily in lakebed, floodplain and cave deposits. Holocene marine deposits along low-latitude coastlines are rare because the rise in sea levels during the period exceeds any likely upthrusting of non-glacial origin. [[Post-glacial rebound]] in [[Scandinavia]] resulted in the emergence of coastal areas around the [[Baltic Sea]], including much of [[Finland]]. The region continues to rise, still causing weak [[earthquake]]s across [[Northern Europe]]. The equivalent event in North America was the rebound of [[Hudson Bay]], as it shrank from its larger, immediate post-glacial [[Tyrrell Sea]] phase, to near its present boundaries.

Throughout the Phanerozoic [[history of the Earth]], the planet's climate has been fluctuating between two dominant [[climate state]]s: the '''greenhouse Earth''' and the '''icehouse Earth'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

These two climate states last for  millions of years and should not be confused with [[glacial period|glacial]] and [[interglacial]] periods, which occur only during an icehouse period and tend to last less than 1 million years. There are [[Timeline of glaciation|five known great glaciation]]s in Earth's climate history; the main factors involved in changes of the [[paleoclimate]] are believed to be the concentration of atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]], changes in the [[Earth's orbit]], and oceanic and [[orogenic]] changes due to [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plate dynamics]]. Greenhouse and icehouse periods have profoundly shaped the [[evolution]] of life on Earth.

==Greenhouse Earth==
===Overview of greenhouse Earth===
A "greenhouse Earth" or "hothouse Earth" is a period in which there are no continental [[glacier]]s whatsoever on the planet, the levels of carbon dioxide and other [[greenhouse gas]]es (such as [[water vapor]] and [[methane]]) are high, and [[sea surface temperature]]s (SSTs) range from 28&amp;nbsp;°C (82.4&amp;nbsp;°F) in the [[tropics]] to 0&amp;nbsp;°C (32&amp;nbsp;°F) in the [[polar region]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Price|first=Gregory|author2=Paul J. Valdes |author3=Bruce W.

This state should not be confused with a hypothetical ''hothouse earth'', which is an irreversible tipping point corresponding to the ongoing [[runaway greenhouse effect]] on [[Venus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Steffen | first=Will | last2=Rockström | first2=Johan |authorlink2=Johan Rockström | last3=Richardson | first3=Katherine | last4=Lenton | first4=Timothy M. | last5=Folke | first5=Carl | last6=Liverman | first6=Diana | last7=Summerhayes | first7=Colin P. | last8=Barnosky | first8=Anthony D. | last9=Cornell | first9=Sarah E. | last10=Crucifix | first10=Michel | last11=Donges | first11=Jonathan F. | last12=Fetzer | first12=Ingo | last13=Lade | first13=Steven J. | last14=Scheffer | first14=Marten | last15=Winkelmann | first15=Ricarda | last16=Schellnhuber | first16=Hans Joachim | title=Trajectories of the Earth System in the Anthropocene | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | publisher=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | date=2018-08-06 | issn=0027-8424 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1810141115 | page=201810141 | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[IPCC]] states that "a 'runaway greenhouse effect'—analogous to [that of] Venus—appears to have virtually no chance of being induced by [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] activities."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipcc.ch/meetings/session31/inf3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes of greenhouse Earth===
There are several theories as to how a greenhouse Earth can come about.  The geological record shows CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other greenhouse gases are abundant during this time. [[Tectonic movement]]s were extremely active during the more well-known greenhouse ages (such as 368 million years ago in the [[Paleozoic]] Era). Because of [[Divergent boundary|continental rifting]] ([[continental plate]]s moving away from each other) [[volcanic]] activity becomes more prominent, producing more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and heating up the Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norris|first=Richard D.|author2=Karen L.

==Icehouse Earth==
{{Life timeline}}
{{see also|Ice age|Timeline of glaciation}}

===Overview of icehouse Earth===
An "icehouse Earth" is the earth as it experiences an [[ice age]]. Unlike a greenhouse Earth, an icehouse Earth has [[ice sheet]]s present, and these sheets wax and wane throughout times known as [[glacial periods]] and [[interglacial|interglacial period]]s. During an icehouse Earth, greenhouse gases tend to be less abundant, and temperatures tend to be cooler globally. The Earth is currently in an icehouse stage,&lt;ref name="Montanez-p24-27"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Montanez|first=Isabel|author2=G.S. Soreghan|title=Earth's Fickle Climate: Lessons Learned from Deep-Time Ice Ages|journal=Geotimes|date=March 2006|volume=51|pages=24–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; as ice sheets are present on both [[Geographical pole|pole]]s and glacial periods have occurred at regular intervals over the past million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Monnin |first1=E. |last2=Indermühle |first2=A. |last3=Dällenbach |first3=A. |last4=Flückiger |first4=J. |last5=Stauffer |first5=B. |last6=Stocker |first6=T.

===Causes of icehouse Earth===
The causes of an icehouse state are much debated, because not much is really known about the transition periods between greenhouse to icehouse climates and what could make the climate so different. One important aspect is clearly the decline of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere, possibly due to low volcanic activity.

Other important issues are the movement of the tectonic plates and the opening and closing of oceanic gateways.&lt;ref name="Smith-p337-340"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Alan G.|author2=Kevin T. Pickering|title=Oceanic gateways as a critical factor to initiate icehouse Earth|journal=Journal of the Geological Society|year=2003|volume=160|pages=337–340|doi=10.1144/0016-764902-115}}&lt;/ref&gt; These seem to play a crucial part in icehouse Earths because they can bring forth cool waters from very deep water circulations that could assist in creating ice sheets or thermal isolation of areas. Examples of this occurring are the opening of the [[Oligocene#The opening of the Tasman Gateway|Tasmanian gateway]] 36.5 million years ago that separated [[Australia]] and [[Antarctica]] and which is believed to have set off the [[Cenozoic]] icehouse,&lt;ref name="Exon-p11-17"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Exon|first=N.|author2=J.

The revealed fresh [[soil]]s act as [[scrubber]]s of carbon dioxide, which can significantly affect the amount of this greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. An example of this is the collision between the [[Indian subcontinent]] and the [[Asia]]n continent, which created the [[Himalayas|Himalayan Mountains]] about 50 million years ago.

=== Glacials and interglacials ===
{{main|Glacial period|Interglacial}}
Within icehouse states, there are "[[glacial period|glacial]]" and "[[interglacial]]" periods that cause ice sheets to build up or retreat. The causes for these glacial and interglacial periods are mainly variations in the movement of the earth around the [[Sun]].&lt;ref name="Broecker-p49-56"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Broecker|first=Wallace S.|author2=George H. Denton|title=What Drives Glacial Cycles|journal=Scientific American|date=January 1990|pages=49–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The astronomical components, discovered by the Serbian geophysicist [[Milutin Milanković]] and now known as [[Milankovitch cycles]], include the [[axial tilt]] of the Earth, the [[orbital eccentricity]] (or shape of the [[orbit]]) and the [[precession]] (or wobble) of the [[Earth's rotation|Earth's spin]]. The tilt of the axis tends to fluctuate between 21.5° to 24.5° and back every 41,000 years on the vertical axis. This change actually affects the [[seasonality]] upon the earth, since more or less [[Insolation|solar radiation]] hits certain areas of the planet more often on a higher tilt, while less of a tilt would create a more even set of seasons worldwide. These changes can be seen in ice cores, which also contains information that shows that during glacial times (at the maximum extension of the ice sheets), the atmosphere had lower levels of carbon dioxide. This may be caused by the increase or redistribution of the [[acid]]/[[Base (chemistry)|base]] balance with [[bicarbonate]] and [[carbonate]] [[ion]]s that deals with [[alkalinity]]. During an Icehouse, only 20% of the time is spent in interglacial, or warmer times.&lt;ref name="Broecker-p49-56" /&gt;

=== Snowball earth ===
{{main|Snowball Earth}}
A "[[snowball earth]]" is the complete opposite of greenhouse Earth, in which the earth's surface is completely frozen over; however, a snowball earth technically does not have continental ice sheets like during the icehouse state. "The Great Infra-[[Cambrian]] Ice Age" has been claimed to be the host of such a world, and in 1964, the scientist [[W. Brian Harland]] brought forth his discovery of indications of glaciers in [[low latitudes]] (Harland and Rudwick). This became a problem for Harland because of the thought of the "Runaway Snowball Paradox" (a kind of [[Snowball effect]]) that, once the earth enters the route of becoming a snowball earth, it would never be able to leave that state. However, in 1992 {{ill|Joseph Kirschvink|display=1|de}} brought up a solution to the paradox. It is believed that since the continents at this time were huddled at the low and mid-latitudes that there was a great cooling event by planetary [[albedo]], or reflection of the earth’s surface. Kirschvink explained that the way to get out of the snowball could be connected to carbon dioxide, since volcanic activity would not halt, and that the buildup and lack of "[[scrubber|scrubbing]]" of this carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, that the earth would return to a greenhouse state. Some scientists believe that the end of the snowball Earth caused an event known as the [[Cambrian Explosion]], which produced the beginnings of [[multi-cellular]] life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maruyama|first=S.|author2=M. Santosh|title=Models on Snowball Earth and Cambrian explosion: A synopsis|journal=Gondwana Research|year=2008|volume=14|pages=22–32|doi=10.1016/j.gr.2008.01.004|bibcode=2008GondR..14...22M}}&lt;/ref&gt; However some biologists claim that a complete snowball Earth could not have happened since [[photosynthetic]] life would not have survived underneath many meters of ice without [[sunlight]]. However, it has been observed that, even under meters of thick ice around Antarctica, sunlight shows through. Most scientists{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} today believe that a "hard" Snowball Earth, one completely covered by ice, is probably impossible. However, a "slushball earth", with points of openings near the [[equator]], is possible.

Recent studies may have again complicated the idea of a snowball earth. In October 2011, a team of French researchers announced that the carbon dioxide during the last speculated "snowball earth" may have been lower than originally stated, which provides a challenge in finding out how Earth was able to get out of its state and if it were a snowball or slushball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=CNRS|first=Delegation Paris Michel-Ange|title=Snowball Earth's hypothesis challenged|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/000102083450.htm|work=ScienceDaily|accessdate=24 November 2011}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transitions==

===Causes===
The [[Eocene]], which occurred between 53 and 49 million years ago, was the Earth's warmest temperature period for 100 million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Herath|first=Anuradha K.|title=From Greenhouse to icehouse|url=http://www.astrobio.net./exclusive/3320/from-greenhouse-to-icehouse|work=Astrobio|accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this "super-greenhouse" eventually became an icehouse by the late Eocene. It was believed that the decline of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; caused this change, though there are possible [[positive feedback]]s, or added influence that contributes to the cooling.

The best record we have for a transition from an icehouse to a greenhouse period where plant life exists is during the [[Permian]] [[Age (geology)|epoch]] that occurred around 300 million years ago. In 40 million years a major transition took place, causing the Earth to change from a moist, icy planet where [[rainforest]]s covered the tropics, into a hot, dry, and windy location where little could survive. Professor [[Isabel P. Montañez]] of [[University of California, Davis]], who has researched this time period, found the climate to be "highly unstable" and "marked by dips and rises in carbon dioxide".&lt;ref name="UCDavis"&gt;{{cite web|last=University of California-Davis|title=A Bumpy Shift from Ice House to Greenhouse|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/01/070104144854.htm|work=ScienceDaily|accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impacts===
The Eocene-Oligocene transition, the latest transition occurring approximately 34 million years ago, resulted in rapid global temperature decrease, the glaciation of Antarctica and a series of biotic extinction events. The most dramatic species turnover event associated with this time period is the [[Grande Coupure]], a period which saw the replacement of European tree-dwelling and leaf-eating mammal species by migratory species from Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prothero|first=D. R.|date=1994-01-01|title=The Late Eocene-Oligocene Extinctions|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.ea.22.050194.001045|journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences|volume=22|issue=1|pages=145–165|doi=10.1146/annurev.ea.22.050194.001045|bibcode=1994AREPS..22..145P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
The science of [[paleoclimatology]] attempts to understand the history of greenhouse and icehouse conditions over geological time. Through the study of [[ice core]]s, [[dendrochronology]], [[ocean]] and [[lake]] [[sediment]]s ([[varve]]), [[palynology]] ([[fossil]]ized [[pollen]]) and [[isotope]] analysis (such as [[Radiometric dating]] and stable isotope analysis), scientists can create models of past climate. One study has shown that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels during the [[Permian]] age rocked back and forth between 250 [[parts per million]] (which is close to present-day levels) up to 2,000 parts per million.&lt;ref name="UCDavis" /&gt; Studies on lake sediments suggest that the "Hothouse" or "super-Greenhouse" [[Eocene]] was in a "permanent [[El Nino]] state" after the 10&amp;nbsp;°C warming of the deep ocean and high latitude surface temperatures shut down the [[Pacific Ocean]]'s El Nino-[[Southern Oscillation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huber|first=Matthew|author2=Rodrigo Caballero|title=Eocene El Nino: Evidence for Robust Tropical Dynamics in the "Hothouse"|journal=Science|date=7 February 2003|volume=299|pages=877–881|bibcode = 2003Sci...299..877H |doi = 10.1126/science.1078766|pmid=12574626}}&lt;/ref&gt; A theory was suggested for the [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum]] on the sudden decrease of carbon isotopic composition of global inorganic carbon pool by 2.5 parts per million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Higgins|first=John A.|author2=Daniel P. Schrag|title=Beyond Methane: Towards a theory for the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|year=2006|volume=245|pages=523–537|bibcode = 2006E&amp;PSL.245..523H |doi = 10.1016/j.epsl.2006.03.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A hypothesis noted for this negative drop of isotopes could be the increase of [[methane hydrate]]s, the trigger for which remains a mystery. This increase of [[Atmospheric methane|methane in the atmosphere]], which happens to be a potent, but short-lived greenhouse gas, increased the global temperatures by 6&amp;nbsp;°C with the assistance of the less potent carbon dioxide.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

* A greenhouse period ran from 4.6 to 2.4 billion years ago.
* [[Huronian|Huronian Glaciation]] - an icehouse period that ran from 2.4 billion years ago to 2.1 billion years ago
* A greenhouse period ran from 2.1 billion to 720 million years ago.
* [[Cryogenian]] - an icehouse period that ran from 720 to 635 million years ago, at times the entire Earth was frozen over

==Modern conditions==
Currently, the Earth is in an icehouse climate state. About 34 million years ago, ice sheets began to form in [[Antarctica]]; the ice sheets in the [[Arctic]] did not start forming until 2 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Montanez-p24-27" /&gt; Some processes that may have led to our current icehouse may be connected to the development of the Himalayan Mountains and the opening of the [[Drake Passage]] between [[South America]] and Antarctica.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Scientists have been attempting to compare the past transitions between icehouse and greenhouse, and vice versa to understand where our planet is now heading.

Without the human influence on the greenhouse gas concentration, the Earth would be heading toward a [[ice age|glacial]] period. Predicted changes in [[orbital forcing]] suggest that in absence of human-made [[global warming]] the next glacial period would begin at least 50,000 years from now&lt;ref name=BergerLoutre&gt;{{cite journal |author=Berger A, Loutre MF |title=Climate. An exceptionally long interglacial ahead? |journal=Science |volume=297 |issue=5585 |pages=1287–8 |date=August 2002 |pmid=12193773 |doi=10.1126/science.1076120 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/297/5585/1287 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Milankovitch cycles]]).

But due to the ongoing anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, the Earth is instead heading toward a greenhouse Earth period.&lt;ref name="Montanez-p24-27" /&gt; Permanent ice is actually a rare phenomenon in the history of the Earth, occurring only in coincidence with the icehouse effect, which has affected about 20% of Earth's history.

'''Historicism''' is the idea of attributing meaningful significance to space and time, such as historical period, geographical place, and local culture. Historicism tends to be [[hermeneutics|hermeneutical]] because it values cautious, rigorous, and contextualized interpretation of information; or [[relativism|relativist]], because it rejects notions of universal, fundamental and immutable interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Kahan, Jeffrey. "Historicism." ''Renaissance Quarterly'', vol. 50, no. 4 December 22, 1997, p. 1202&lt;/ref&gt; The approach varies from individualist theories of knowledge such as [[empiricism]] and [[rationalism]], which neglect the role of [[tradition]]s.

The term "historicism" (''Historismus'') was coined by German philosopher [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian Leiter, Michael Rosen (eds.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Continental Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 175: "[The word 'historicism'] appears as early as the late eighteenth century in the writings of the German romantics, who used it in a neutral sense. In 1797 Friedrich Schlegel used 'historicism' to refer to a philosophy that stresses the importance of history..."; Katherine Harloe, Neville Morley (eds.), ''Thucydides and the Modern World: Reception, Reinterpretation and Influence from the Renaissance to the Present'', Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 81: "Already in   Friedrich Schlegel's ''Fragments about Poetry and Literature'' (a collection of notes attributed to 1797), the word ''Historismus'' occurs five times."&lt;/ref&gt; Over time it has developed different and somewhat divergent meanings. Elements of historicism appear in the writings of French essayist [[Michel de Montaigne]] (1533–1592) and Italian philosopher [[G. B. Vico]] (1668–1744), and became more fully developed with the [[dialectic]] of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Georg Hegel]] (1770–1831), influential in 19th-century Europe. The writings of [[Karl Marx]], influenced by Hegel, also include historicism. The term is also associated with the empirical social sciences and with the work of [[Franz Boas]].

Historicism may be contrasted with [[reductionism|reductionist]] theories—which assumes that all developments can be explained by fundamental principles (such as in [[economic determinism]])—or with theories that posit that historical changes occur as a result of random chance.

The Austrian-English philosopher [[Karl Popper]] condemned historicism along with the [[determinism]] and [[holism]] which he argued formed its basis. In his ''[[Poverty of Historicism]]'', he identified historicism with the opinion that there are "inexorable laws of historical destiny", which opinion he warned against. This contrasts with the contextually relative interpretation of historicism for which its proponents argue. [[Talcott Parsons]] criticized historicism as a case of idealistic fallacy in ''The Structure of Social Action'' (1937).

[[Post-structuralism]] uses the term "[[New Historicism]]", which has some associations with both anthropology and Hegelianism.

The [[#Christian historicism|theological use]] of the word denotes the interpretation of biblical prophecy as being related to church history.

==Variants==

===Hegelian===
[[File:G.W.F. Hegel (by Sichling, after Sebbers).jpg|right|thumb|G. W. F. Hegel (1770–1831)]]

Hegel viewed the realization of human freedom as the ultimate purpose of history, which could only be achieved through the creation of the perfect state. And this progressive history would only occur through a dialectical process: namely, the tension between the purpose of humankind (freedom), the position that humankind currently finds itself, and mankind's attempt to bend the current world into accord with its nature. However, because humans are often not aware of the goal of both humanity and history, the process of achieving freedom is necessarily one of self-discovery. Hegel also saw the progress toward freedom being conducted by the "spirit" (Geist), a seemingly supernatural force that directed all human actions and interactions. Yet Hegel makes clear that the spirit is a mere abstraction, and only comes into existence "through the activity of finite agents." Thus, Hegel's philosophy of history is not necessarily metaphysical, despite the fact that many of Hegel's opponents and interpreters have understood Hegel's philosophy of history as a metaphysical and determinist view of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Hegel|last=Beiser|first=Frederick C.|publisher=Cambridge University PRess|year=1993|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=289–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Karl Popper in his book ''The Poverty of Historicism'' interpreted Hegel's philosophy of history as metaphysical and deterministic. Popper referred to this "Hegelian" philosophy of history as ''Historicism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Poverty of Historicism|last=Popper|first=Karl Popper|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1957|isbn=|location=London|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel's historicism also suggests that any human [[society]] and all human activities such as [[science]], [[art]], or [[philosophy]], are defined by their history. Consequently, their essence can be sought only by understanding said history. The history of any such human endeavor, moreover, not only continues but also reacts against what has gone before; this is the source of Hegel's famous dialectic teaching usually summarized by the slogan "[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|thesis, antithesis, and synthesis]]".  (Hegel did not use these terms, although [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Johann Fichte]] did.) Hegel's famous [[aphorism]], "Philosophy is the history of philosophy," describes it bluntly.

Hegel's position is perhaps best illuminated when contrasted against the atomistic and reductionist opinion of human societies and social activities self-defining on an ''ad hoc'' basis through the sum of dozens of interactions. Yet another contrasting model is the persistent metaphor of a [[social contract]].  Hegel considers the relationship between individuals and societies as organic, not atomic: even their social discourse is mediated by [[philosophy of language|language]], and language is based on [[etymology]] and unique character. It thus preserves the culture of the past in thousands of half-forgotten [[metaphor]]s.  To understand why a person is the way he is, you must examine that person in his society: and to understand that society, you must understand its history, and the forces that influenced it.  The ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', the "Spirit of the Age," is the concrete embodiment of the most important factors that are acting in human history at any given time. This contrasts with teleological theories of activity, which suppose that the end is the determining factor of activity, as well as those who believe in a [[tabula rasa]], or blank slate, opinion, such that individuals are defined by their interactions.

These ideas can be interpreted variously.  The [[Right Hegelians]], working from Hegel's opinions about the organicism and historically determined nature of human societies, interpreted Hegel's historicism as a justification of the unique destiny of national groups and the importance of stability and institutions.  Hegel's conception of human societies as entities greater than the individuals who constitute them influenced nineteenth-century [[romantic nationalism]] and its twentieth-century excesses.  The [[Young Hegelians]], by contrast, interpreted Hegel's thoughts on societies influenced by social conflict for a doctrine of [[social progress]], and attempted to manipulate these forces to cause various  results.  Karl Marx's doctrine of "historical inevitabilities" and [[historical materialism]] is one of the more influential reactions to this part of Hegel's thought.  Significantly, Karl Marx's [[Marx's theory of alienation|theory of alienation]] argues that [[capitalism]] disrupts traditional relationships between workers and their work.

Hegelian historicism is related to his ideas on the means by which human societies progress, specifically the [[Hegelian dialectic|dialectic]] and his conception of logic as representing the inner essential nature of reality. Hegel attributes the change to the "modern" need to interact with the world, whereas ancient philosophers were self-contained, and medieval philosophers were monks. In his History of Philosophy Hegel writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In modern times things are very different; now we no longer see philosophic individuals who constitute a class by themselves. With the present day all difference has disappeared; philosophers are not monks, for we find them generally in connection with the world, participating with others in some common work or calling. They live, not independently, but in the relation of citizens, or they occupy public offices and take part in the life of the state. Certainly they may be private persons, but if so, their position as such does not in any way isolate them from their other relationship. They are involved in present conditions, in the world and its work and progress. Thus their philosophy is only by the way, a sort of luxury and superfluity. This difference is really to be found in the manner in which outward conditions have taken shape after the building up of the inward world of religion. In modern times, namely, on account of the reconciliation of the worldly principle with itself, the external world is at rest, is brought into order — worldly relationships, conditions, modes of life, have become constituted and organized in a manner which is conformable to nature and rational. We see a universal, comprehensible connection, and with that individuality likewise attains another character and nature, for it is no longer the plastic individuality of the ancients. This connection is of such power that every individuality is under its dominion, and yet at the same time can construct for itself an inward world.&lt;ref name=LecturesOnTheHistoryOfPhilosophyVolume3&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Lectures_on_the_History_of_Philosophy.html?id=ik05WhN4ga0C&amp;pg=PA167#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Lectures on the History of Philosophy, Volume 3"], By Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Translated by E. S. Haldane and Frances H. Simson, M. A., ''University of Nebraska Press'', 1995&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This opinion that entanglement in society creates an indissoluble bond with expression, would become an influential question in philosophy, namely, the requirements for individuality.  It would be considered by [[Nietzsche]], [[John Dewey]] and [[Michel Foucault]] directly, as well as in the work of numerous artists and authors. There have been various responses to Hegel's challenge. The Romantic period emphasized the ability of individual genius to transcend time and place, and use the materials from their heritage to fashion works which were beyond determination. The modern would advance versions of John Locke's infinite malleability of the human animal. Post-structuralism would argue that since history is not present, but only the image of history, that while an individual era or power structure might emphasize a particular history, that the contradictions within the story would hinder the very purposes that the history was constructed to advance.

===Anthropological&lt;!--'Anthropological historicism'--&gt;===
In the context of [[anthropology]] and other sciences which study the past, historicism has a different meaning. '''Anthropological historicism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Byron Kaldis (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy and the Social Sciences'', SAGE Publications, 2013, p. 421.&lt;/ref&gt; is associated with the work of [[Franz Boas]]. His theory used the [[Diffusion (anthropology)|diffusionist]] concept that there were a few "cradles of civilization" which grew outwards, and merged it with the idea that societies would adapt to their circumstances, which is called [[historical particularism]]. The school of historicism grew in response to [[Classical social evolutionism|unilinear theories]] that social development represented adaptive fitness, and therefore existed on a continuum. While these theories were espoused by [[Charles Darwin]] and many of his students, their application as applied in [[social Darwinism]] and [[general evolution]] characterized in the theories of [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Leslie White]], historicism was neither anti-selection, nor anti-evolution, as Darwin never attempted nor offered an explanation for cultural evolution. However, it attacked the notion that there was one normative spectrum of development, instead emphasizing how local conditions would create adaptations to the local environment. [[Julian Steward]] refuted the viability of globally and universally applicable adaptive standards proposing that culture was honed adaptively in response to the idiosyncrasies of the local environment, the [[cultural ecology]], by [[specific evolution]]. What was adaptive for one region might not be so for another. This conclusion has likewise been adopted by modern forms of biological evolutionary theory.

The primary method of historicism was empirical, namely that there were so many requisite inputs into a society or event, that only by emphasizing the data available could a theory of the source be determined. In this opinion, grand theories are unprovable, and instead intensive field work would determine the most likely explanation and history of a culture, and hence it is named "historicism."

This opinion would produce a wide range of definition of what, exactly, constituted culture and history, but in each case the only means of explaining it was in terms of the historical particulars of the culture itself.

===New===
{{main|New Historicism}}
Since the 1950s, when [[Jacques Lacan]] and Foucault argued that each epoch has its own knowledge system, within which individuals are inexorably entangled, many [[post-structuralist]]s have used ''historicism'' to describe the opinion that all questions must be settled within the cultural and social context in which they are raised. Answers cannot be found by appeal to an external truth, but only within the confines of the norms and forms that phrase the question.  This version of historicism holds that there are only the raw texts, markings and artifacts that exist in the present, and the conventions used to decode them. This school of thought is sometimes given the name of ''New Historicism''.

The same term, ''new historicism'' is also used for a school of literary scholarship which interprets a [[poem]], [[drama]], etc. as an expression of or reaction to the power-structures of its society. [[Stephen Greenblatt]] is an example of this school.

===Modern===
Within the context of 20th-century philosophy, debates continue as to whether ahistorical and immanent methods were sufficient to understand meaning—that is to say, "what you see is what you get" positivism—or whether context, background and culture are important beyond the mere need to decode words, phrases and references. While post-structural historicism is relativist in its orientation, that is, it sees each culture as its own frame of reference, a large number of thinkers have embraced the need for historical context, not because culture is self-referential, but because there is no more compressed means of conveying all of the relevant information except through history. This opinion is often seen as deriving from the work of [[Benedetto Croce]]. Recent historians using this tradition include [[Thomas Kuhn]].

===Christian===
{{main|Historicism (Christian eschatology)}}

====Eschatological====
In [[Christianity]], the term ''historicism'' refers to the confessional [[Protestantism|Protestant]] form of prophetical interpretation which holds that the fulfillment of [[Bible|biblical]] [[prophecy]] has occurred throughout history and continues to occur; as opposed to other methods which limit the time-frame of prophecy-fulfillment to the past or to the future.

====Dogmatic and ecclesiastic====
There is also a particular opinion in [[ecclesiastical history]] and in the [[History of Catholic dogmatic theology|history of dogmas]] which has been described as historicist by Pope [[Pius XII]] in the encyclical ''[[Humani generis]]''. "They add that the history of dogmas consists in the reporting of the various forms in which revealed truth has been clothed, forms that have succeeded one another in accordance with the different teachings and opinions that have arisen over the course of the centuries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pius XII |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html |title=Humani generis, 15 |publisher=[[Vatican.va]] |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419021937/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html |archivedate=2012-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critics==

===Karl Marx===
The social theory of Karl Marx, with respect to modern scholarship, has an ambiguous relation to historicism. Critics of Marx have charged his theory with historicism since its very genesis. However, the issue of historicism also finds itself important to many debates within Marxism itself; the charge of historicism has been made against various types of Marxism, typically disparaged by Marxists as "vulgar" Marxism.

Marx himself expresses critical concerns with this historicist tendency in his [[Theses on Feuerbach]]:
{{quote|The materialist doctrine that men are products of circumstances and upbringing, and that, therefore, changed men are products of changed circumstances and changed upbringing, forgets that it is men who change circumstances and that the educator must himself be educated. Hence this doctrine is bound to divide society into two parts, one of which is superior to society. The coincidence of the changing of circumstances and of human activity or self-change [Selbstveränderung] can be conceived and rationally understood only as revolutionary [[praxis (process)|practice]].&lt;ref name="Theses on Feuerbach"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/theses/index.htm | title = Theses on Feuerbach | website = | publisher = | accessdate = February 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Karl Popper===

[[Karl Popper]] used the term ''historicism'' in his influential books ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' and ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', to mean: "an approach to the social sciences which assumes that ''historical prediction'' is their primary aim, and which assumes that this aim is attainable by discovering the 'rhythms' or the 'patterns', the 'laws' or the 'trends' that underlie the evolution of history".&lt;ref name = "Poverty 3"&gt;POPPER, Karl, p. 3 of ''The Poverty of Historicism'', italics in original&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Popper wrote with reference to [[Hegel]]'s theory of [[history]], which he criticized extensively. However, there is wide dispute whether Popper's description of "historicism" is an accurate description of Hegel, or more his characterisation of his own philosophical antagonists, including [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] thought, then widely held as posing a challenge to the philosophical basis of the [[Western world|West]], as well as theories such as [[Oswald Spengler|Spengler's]] which drew predictions about the future course of events from the past.

In ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', Popper attacks "historicism" and its proponents, among whom (as well as Hegel) he identifies and singles out [[Plato]] and [[Marx]]—calling them all "enemies of the open society".  The objection he makes is that historicist positions, by claiming that there is an inevitable and deterministic pattern to history, abrogate the [[democracy|democratic]] responsibility of each one of us to make our own free contributions to the evolution of society, and hence lead to [[totalitarianism]].

Another of his targets is what he terms "moral historicism", the attempt to infer moral values from the course of history; in Hegel's words, that "history is the world's court of justice".  This may take the form of conservatism (former might is right), positivism (might is right) or futurism (presumed coming might is right). As against these, Popper says that he does not believe "that success proves anything or that history is our judge".&lt;ref&gt;''The Open Society and its Enemies'', vol. 2 p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Futurism must be distinguished from prophecies that the right will prevail: these attempt to infer history from ethics, rather than ethics from history, and are therefore historicism in the normal sense rather than moral historicism.

He also attacks what he calls "[[Historism]]", which he regards as distinct from historicism.  By historism, he means the tendency to regard every argument or idea as completely accounted for by its historical context, as opposed to assessing it by its merits.  In Popperian terms, the "[[New Historicism]]" is an example of historism rather than of historicism proper.

===Leo Strauss===
[[Leo Strauss]] used the term ''historicism'' and reportedly termed it the single greatest threat to intellectual freedom insofar as it denies any attempt to address injustice-pure-and-simple (such is the significance of historicism's rejection of "natural right" or "right by nature").  Strauss argued that historicism "rejects political philosophy" (insofar as this stands or falls by questions of permanent, trans-historical significance) and is based on the belief that "all human thought, including scientific thought, rests on premises which cannot be validated by human reason and which came from historical epoch to historical epoch." Strauss further identified [[R. G. Collingwood]] as the most coherent advocate of historicism in the English language.  Countering Collingwood's arguments, Strauss warned against historicist social scientists' failure to address real-life problems—most notably that of tyranny—to the extent that they relativize (or "subjectivize") all ethical problems by placing their significance strictly in function of particular or ever-changing socio-material conditions devoid of inherent or "objective" "value." Similarly, Strauss criticized [[Eric Voegelin]]'s abandonment of ancient political thought as guide or vehicle in interpreting modern political problems.

In his books, ''[[Natural Right and History]]'' and ''[[On Tyranny]]'', Strauss offers a complete critique of historicism as it emerges in the works of Hegel, Marx, and [[Heidegger]]. Many believe that Strauss also found historicism in [[Edmund Burke]], [[Tocqueville]], [[Augustine]], and [[John Stuart Mill]]. Although it is largely disputed whether Strauss himself was a historicist, he often indicated that historicism grew out of and against Christianity and was a threat to civic participation, belief in human agency, religious pluralism, and, most controversially, an accurate understanding of the classical philosophers and religious prophets themselves. Throughout his work, he warns that historicism, and the understanding of [[Progress (history)|progress]] that results from it, expose us to [[tyranny]], totalitarianism, and [[Ochlocracy|democratic extremism]]. In his exchange with [[Alexandre Kojève]] in ''On Tyranny'', Strauss seems to blame historicism for [[Nazism]] and [[Communism]]. In a collection of his works by Kenneth Hart entitled ''[[Jewish Philosophy and the Crisis of Modernity]]'',  he argues that [[Islam]], traditional [[Judaism]], and ancient Greece, share a concern for sacred law that makes them especially susceptible to historicism, and therefore to tyranny.  Strauss makes use of Nietzsche's own critique of progress and historicism, although Strauss refers to Nietzsche himself (no less than to Heidegger) as a "radical historicist" who articulated a philosophical (if only untenable) justification for historicism.

'''Industrial melanism''' is an [[evolution]]ary effect prominent in several [[arthropod]]s, where dark [[pigmentation]] ([[melanism]]) has evolved in an environment affected by [[industrial pollution]], including sulphur dioxide gas and dark soot deposits. Sulphur dioxide kills [[lichen]]s, leaving tree [[Bark (botany)|bark]] bare where in clean areas it is boldly patterned, while soot darkens bark and other surfaces. Darker pigmented individuals have a higher fitness in those areas as their [[camouflage]] matches the polluted background better; they are thus favoured by [[natural selection]].  This change, extensively studied by [[Bernard Kettlewell]], is a popular [[Teaching of evolution|teaching example in Darwinian evolution]], providing [[Coloration evidence for natural selection|evidence for natural selection]].&lt;ref name="Majerus2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Majerus |first1=Michael E.

Industrial melanism is widespread in the [[Lepidoptera]] (butterflies and moths), involving over 70 species such as ''[[Odontopera bidentata]]'' (scalloped hazel)&lt;ref name=CookTurner2008&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cook |first1=L.

It is also seen in a beetle, ''[[Adalia bipunctata]]'' (two-spot ladybird), where camouflage is not involved as the insect has conspicuous [[aposematism|warning coloration]], and in the seasnake ''[[Emydocephalus annulatus]]'' where the melanism may help in excretion of trace elements through [[sloughing]] of the skin. The rapid decline of melanism that has accompanied the reduction of pollution, in effect a [[natural experiment]], makes natural selection for camouflage "the only credible explanation".&lt;ref name=CookTurner2008/&gt;

Other explanations for the observed correlation with industrial pollution have been proposed, including strengthening the immune system in a polluted environment, absorbing heat more rapidly when sunlight is reduced by air pollution, and the ability to excrete trace elements into melanic scales and feathers.

==History==
[[File:Biston betularia 20110529 102239 8073M.JPG|thumb|upright|Intermediate ''insularia'' form (between pale ''typica'' and dark ''carbonaria'' in tone) of peppered moth on a [[lichen]]-covered [[birch]] tree: [[Bernard Kettlewell]] counted the frequencies of all three forms.&lt;ref name=Kettlewell1955/&gt;]]

Industrial melanism was first noticed in 1900 by the geneticist [[William Bateson]]; he observed that the colour morphs were inherited, but did not suggest an explanation for the [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]].&lt;ref name=CookTurner2008/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bateson, William |authorlink=William Bateson |year=1900 |title=Collective enquiry as to progressive melanism in moths—memorandum from the Evolution Committee of the Royal Society |journal=Entomological Record |volume=12 |page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, the geneticist [[Leonard Doncaster]] described the increase in frequency of the melanic forms of several moth species from about 1800 to 1850 in the [[Industrial Revolution|heavily industrialised]] north-west region of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Doncaster, Leonard |authorlink=Leonard Doncaster |year=1906 |title=Collective enquiry as to progressive melanism in Lepidoptera |journal=Entomological Record |volume=18 |pages=165–168, 206–208, 222–276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, the evolutionary biologist [[J. B. S. Haldane]] constructed a [[mathematical model|mathematical argument]] showing that the rapid growth in frequency of the ''carbonaria''  form of the peppered moth, ''Biston betularia'', implied [[natural selection|selective pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haldane |first=J.

From 1955 onwards, the geneticist [[Bernard Kettlewell]] conducted [[Kettlewell's experiment|a series of experiments]] exploring the [[peppered moth evolution|evolution of melanism in the peppered moth]].

By 1973, pollution in England had begun to decrease, and the dark ''carbonaria'' form had declined in frequency. This provided convincing evidence, gathered and analysed by Kettlewell and others such as the entomologist and geneticist [[Michael Majerus]] and the population geneticist Laurence M. Cook, that its rise and fall had been caused by natural selection in response to the changing pollution of the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kettlewell, H. B.

==Taxonomic range==

Industrial melanism is known from over 70 species of [[moth]] that Kettlewell found in England, and many others from Europe and North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hendry |first1=Andrew P. |last2=Kinnison |first2=Michael T. |title=Microevolution Rate, Pattern, Process |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E031CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA185 |year=2012 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-010-0585-2 |pages=185–}}, which cites Kettlewell 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;
Among these, ''[[Apamea crenata]]'' (clouded border brindle moth) and ''[[Acronicta rumicis]]'' (knot grass moth) are always polymorphic, though the melanic forms are more common in cities and (like those of the peppered moth) are declining in frequency as those cities become less polluted.&lt;ref name=CookTurner2008/&gt;

Among other insects, industrial melanism has been observed in a [[beetle]], ''[[Adalia bipunctata]]'', the two-spot ladybird.&lt;ref name="MuggletonLonsdale1975"/&gt;

In the vertebrates, industrial melanism is known from the turtle-headed seasnake ''[[Emydocephalus annulatus]]'',&lt;ref name=Goiran/&gt; and may be present in urban [[feral pigeon]]s.&lt;ref name="ChatelainGasparini2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chatelain |first1=M. |last2=Gasparini |first2=J. |last3=Jacquin |first3=L. |last4=Frantz |first4=A. |title=The adaptive function of melanin-based plumage coloration to trace metals |journal=Biology Letters |volume=10 |issue=3 |year=2014 |pages=20140164–20140164 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2014.0164|pmc=3982444 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|Peppered moth evolution}}

For [[camouflage]] from predators against that clean background, they had generally light coloration.&lt;ref name=MuggletonLonsdale1975/&gt; During the [[Industrial Revolution]] in England, [[sulphur dioxide]] pollution in the atmosphere reduced the lichen cover, while [[soot]] blackened the bark of urban trees, making the light-colored moths more vulnerable to predation.

Melanic ''B. betularia'' have been widely observed in North America. In 1959, 90% of ''B. betularia'' in Michigan and Pennsylvania were melanic. By 2001, melanism dropped to 6% of the population, following clean air legislation.&lt;ref name=Grant2002&gt;{{cite journal |author=Grant, B. S.; Wiseman L.

It has been suggested that the demonstrated relationship between melanism and pollution can not be fully proven because the exact reason for increase in survivability can not be tracked and pin-pointed. However, as air quality has improved in industrial areas of America and Britain, through improved [[regulation]], offering the conditions for a [[natural experiment]], melanism has sharply declined in moths including ''B. betularia'' and ''[[Odontopera bidentata]]''. Cook and J. R. G. Turner have concluded that "natural selection is the only credible explanation for the overall decline",&lt;ref name=CookTurner2008/&gt; and other biologists working in the area concur with this judgement.&lt;ref name=Grant1998&gt;{{cite journal |author=Grant, B.

===Immunity===

In 1921, the evolutionary biologist [[Richard Goldschmidt]] argued that the observed increase in the melanic form of the black arches moth, ''[[Lymantria monacha]]'', could not have been caused by [[mutation pressure]] alone, but required a selective advantage from an unknown cause: he did not consider camouflage as an explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldschmidt |first=R. |authorlink=Richard Goldschmidt |title=Controversial Geneticist and Creative Biologist: A Critical Review of His Contributions with an Introduction by Karl von Frisch |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D5L5BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA75 |year=2013 |publisher=[[Birkhäuser]] |isbn=978-3-0348-5855-7 |page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly a century later, it was suggested that the moth's industrial melanism might, in addition ([[pleiotropy]]) to providing camouflage with "the well-known protective dark coloration",&lt;ref name=Mikkola2010/&gt; also confer better immunity to toxic chemicals from industrial pollution. The darker forms have a stronger [[immune response]] to foreign objects; these are encapsulated by [[haemocyte]]s (insect blood cells), and the capsule so formed is then hardened with deposits of the dark pigment, [[melanin]].&lt;ref name=Mikkola2010&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mikkola, K.; Rantala, M. J. |date=2010 |title=Immune defence, a possible nonvisual selective factor behind the industrial melanism of moths (Lepidoptera) |journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=99 |issue=4 |pages=831–838 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.2010.01398.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gillespie andKanost1997"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gillespie |first1=Jeremy P. |last2=Kanost |first2=Michael R. |last3=Trenczek |first3=Tina |title=Biological Mediators of Insect Immunity |journal=Annual Review of Entomology |volume=42 |issue=1 |year=1997 |pages=611–643 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.42.1.611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trace metal excretion===

A non-camouflage mechanism has been suggested for some vertebrates. In tropical ocean regions subject to industrial pollution the turtle-headed seasnake ''[[Emydocephalus annulatus]]'' is more likely to be melanic. These snakes shed their skin every two to six weeks. Sloughed skin contains toxic minerals, higher for dark skin, so industrial melanism could be selected for through improved excretion of trace elements.{{efn|The article does not address whether this is a genetic mutation or reversible adaptation by individuals.&lt;ref name=Goiran/&gt;}}&lt;ref name=Goiran&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goiran, C.; Bustamante, P.; Shine, R. |title=Industrial Melanism in the Seasnake Emydocephalus annulatus |journal=Current Biology |volume=27 |issue=16 |pages=2510–2513.e2 |year=2017 |pmid=28803870 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2017.06.073}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same may apply in the case of urban feral pigeons, which have the ability to remove trace metals such as zinc to their feathers. However, toxic lead was not found to accumulate in feathers, so the putative mechanism is limited in its range.&lt;ref name="ChatelainGasparini2014"/&gt;

===Thermal advantage===

}}

Melanic forms of the two-spot ladybird ''[[Adalia bipunctata]]'' are very frequent in and near cities, and rare in unpolluted countryside, so they appear to be industrial. Ladybirds are [[aposematic]] (with conspicuous warning coloration), so camouflage cannot explain the distribution. A proposed explanation is that the melanic forms have a thermal advantage directly linked to the pollution aspect of industrialization, since smoke and particulates in the air reduce the amount of sunlight that reaches the habitats of these species. Melanic phenotypes should then be favoured by natural selection, as the dark coloration absorbs the limited sunlight better.&lt;ref name="MuggletonLonsdale1975"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Muggleton |first1=John |last2=Lonsdale |first2=David |last3=Benham |first3=Brian R. |title=Melanism in ''Adalia bipunctata'' L. (Col., Coccinellidae) and its Relationship to Atmospheric Pollution |journal=The Journal of Applied Ecology |volume=12 |issue=2 |year=1975 |pages=451 |doi=10.2307/2402167}}&lt;/ref&gt; A possible explanation might be that in colder environments, the thermal advantages of industrial melanism might increase activity and the likelihood to mate. In the Netherlands, melanic ''A. bipunctata'' had a distinct mating advantage over the non-melanic form.&lt;ref name="De JongVerhoog1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=De Jong |first1=Peter W. |last2=Verhoog |first2=Michelle D. |last3=Brakefield |first3=Paul M. |title=Sperm competition and melanic polymorphism in the 2-spot ladybird, ''Adalia bipunctata'' (Coleoptera, Coccinellidae)  |journal=Heredity |volume=70 |issue=2 |year=1993 |pages=172–178 |doi=10.1038/hdy.1993.26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MuggletonLonsdale1975/&gt;

However, thermal melanism failed to explain the distribution of the species near [[Helsinki]] where the city forms a relatively warm 'heat island', while near the Finnish coast there is more sunlight as well as more melanism, so the selective pressure driving melanism requires a different explanation.&lt;ref name=Mikkola1988&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mikkola, K.; Albrecht, A. |year=1988 |title=The melanism of ''Adalia-bipunctata'' around the Gulf of Finland as an industrial phenomenon (Coleoptera, Coccinellidae) |journal=Annales Zoologici Fennici |volume=25 |pages=77-85 |jstor=23734522}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in [[Birmingham]] similarly found no evidence of thermal melanism but a strong correlation with smoke pollution; melanism declined from 1960 to 1978 as the city became cleaner. Further, the same study found that a related species, ''[[Adalia decempunctata]]'', experienced no change in frequency of melanism in the same places in that period.&lt;ref name="BrakefieldLees1987"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brakefield |first1=Paul M. |last2=Lees |first2=David R. |title=Melanism in Adalia ladybirds and declining air pollution in Birmingham |journal=Heredity |volume=59 |issue=2 |year=1987 |pages=273–277 |doi=10.1038/hdy.1987.123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''information society''' is a [[society]] where the creation, distribution, use, integration and manipulation of [[information]] is a significant economic, political, and cultural activity. Its main drivers are digital [[information and communication technologies]], which have resulted in an [[information explosion]] and are profoundly changing all aspects of social organization, including the [[economy]],&lt;ref&gt;Hilbert, M.

Digital Technology and Social Change [Open Online Course at the University of California] freely available at: https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/949415&lt;/ref&gt; The people who have the means to partake in this form of society are sometimes called [[digital citizen]]s, defined by K. Mossberger as “Those who use the Internet regularly and effectively”. This is one of many dozen labels that have been identified to suggest that humans are entering a new phase of society.&lt;ref name="Beniger 1986"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Control Revolution: Technological and Economic Origins of the Information Society |last= Beniger |first=James R. |authorlink= James R. Beniger |date=1986 |location=Cambridge, Mass. |publisher=Harvard University Press|title-link= The Control Revolution }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The markers of this rapid change may be technological, economic, occupational, spatial, cultural, or some combination of all of these.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last=Webster |first=Frank |title=Theories of the Information Society |date=2002 |publisher=Routledge |location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Information society is seen as the successor to [[industrial society]]. Closely related concepts are the [[post-industrial society]] ([[Daniel Bell]]), [[post-fordism]], [[postmodernity|post-modern]] society, knowledge society, telematic society, [[Information Revolution]], [[liquid modernity]], and [[network society]] ([[Manuel Castells]]).

==Definition==
There is currently no universally accepted concept of what exactly can be termed information society and what shall rather not so be termed. Most theoreticians agree that a transformation can be seen that started somewhere between the 1970s and today and is changing the way societies work fundamentally. Information technology goes beyond the [[internet]], and there are discussions about how big the influence of specific media or specific modes of production really is. Frank Webster notes five major types of information that can be used to define information society: technological, economic, occupational, spatial and cultural.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Webster, the character of information has transformed the way that we live today. How we conduct ourselves centers around theoretical knowledge and information.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, F. (2006). Chapter 2: What is an information society? In ''Theories of the Information Society'', 3rd ed. (pp. 15-31). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kasiwulaya and Gomo (Makerere University) allude{{Where|date=February 2018}}&lt;!-- Exactly where do they make this allusion (if allusions are even worth bothering with)? --&gt;{{Dubious|date=February 2018}}&lt;!-- If they don't dare say it but merely allude to it, why are we bothering with this? --&gt; that information societies are those that have intensified their use of IT for economic, social, cultural and political transformation. In 2005, governments reaffirmed their dedication to the foundations of the Information
Society in the [[Tunis Commitment]] and outlined the basis for implementation and follow-up in the Tunis Agenda for the Information Society. In particular, the Tunis Agenda addresses the issues of financing of ICTs for development and Internet governance that could not be resolved in the first phase.

Some people, such as [[Antonio Negri]], characterize the information society as one in which people do immaterial labour. By this, they appear to refer to the production of knowledge or cultural artifacts. One problem with this model is that it ignores the material and essentially industrial basis of the society. However it does point to a problem for workers, namely how many creative people does this society need to function?  For example, it may be that you only need a few star performers, rather than a plethora of non-celebrities, as the work of those performers can be easily distributed, forcing all secondary players to the bottom of the market. It ''is'' now common for publishers to promote only their best selling authors and to try to avoid the rest—even if they still sell steadily. Films are becoming more and more judged, in terms of distribution, by their first weekend's performance, in many cases cutting out opportunity for word-of-mouth development.

[[Michael Buckland]] characterizes information in society in his book ''Information and Society.'' Buckland expresses the idea that information can be interpreted differently from person to person based on that individual's experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buckland|first1=Michael|title=Information in Society|date=March 3, 2017|publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering that metaphors and technologies of information move forward in a reciprocal relationship, we can describe some societies (especially the [[Japanese society]]) as an information society because we think of it as such.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Boyle (academic)|James Boyle]], 1996, 6{{Vague|date=February 2018}}&lt;!-- WHAT, published by Boyle in 1996? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Kasiwulaya and Walter, Makerere University. Makerere University Press.{{Vague|date=February 2018}}&lt;!-- WHAT is this? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The word information may be interpreted in many different ways. According to Buckland in ''Information and Society'', most of the meanings fall into three categories of human knowledge: information as knowledge, information as a process, and information as a thing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Information and Society|last=Buckland|first=Michael|publisher=MIT Press|year=2017|isbn=|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of technologically mediated information has been quantified in different ways, including society's technological capacity to store information, to communicate information, and to compute information. It is estimated that, the world's technological capacity to store information grew from 2.6 (optimally compressed) [[exabytes]] in 1986, which is the informational equivalent to less than one 730-MB [[CD-ROM]] per person in 1986 (539 MB per person), to 295 (optimally compressed) [[exabytes]] in 2007.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/60 "The World’s Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information"], Martin Hilbert and Priscila López (2011), [[Science (journal)|Science]], 332(6025), 60-65; free access to the article through here: martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html&lt;/ref&gt; This is the informational equivalent of 60 [[CD-ROM]] per person in 2007&lt;ref name="Hilbertvideo2011"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIKPjOuwqHo "video animation on The World’s Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information from 1986 to 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; and represents a sustained annual growth rate of some 25%.

The world's combined effective capacity to exchange information through two-way [[telecommunication]] networks was 281 [[petabytes]] of (optimally compressed) information in 1986, 471 [[petabytes]] in 1993, 2.2 (optimally compressed) [[exabytes]] in 2000, and 65 (optimally compressed) [[exabytes]] in 2007, which is the informational equivalent of 6 newspapers per person per day in 2007.&lt;ref name="Hilbertvideo2011"/&gt; The world's technological capacity to compute information with humanly guided general-purpose computers grew from 3.0 × 10^8 MIPS in 1986, to 6.4 x 10^12 MIPS in 2007, experiencing the fastest growth rate of over 60% per year during the last two decades.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"/&gt;

[[James R. Beniger]] describes the necessity of information in modern society in the following way: “The need for sharply increased control that resulted from the industrialization of material processes through application of inanimate sources of energy probably accounts for the rapid development of automatic feedback technology in the early industrial period (1740-1830)” (p.&amp;nbsp;174)
“Even with enhanced feedback control, industry could not have developed without the enhanced means to process matter and energy, not only as inputs of the raw materials of production but also as outputs distributed to final consumption.”(p.&amp;nbsp;175)&lt;ref name="Beniger 1986"/&gt;

==Development of the information society model==
[[File:Clark's Sector Model.png|right|thumb|450px|Colin Clark (economist)|[[Colin Clark (economist)|Colin Clark]]'s sector model of an economy undergoing technological change. In later stages, the [[Quaternary sector of the economy]] grows.]]
One of the first people to develop the concept of the information society was the economist [[Fritz Machlup]]. In 1933, Fritz Machlup began studying the effect of patents on research. His work culminated in the study ''The production and distribution of knowledge in the United States'' in 1962. This book was widely regarded&lt;ref&gt;Susan Crawford: "[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&amp;artid=227258 The Origin and Development of a Concept: The Information Society]". ''Bull Med Libr Assoc.'' 71(4) October 1983: 380–385.&lt;/ref&gt; and was eventually translated into [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. The Japanese have also studied the information society (or ''jōhōka shakai'', [[:ja:情報化社会|情報化社会]]).

The issue of technologies and their role in contemporary society have been discussed in the scientific literature using a range of labels and concepts. This section introduces some of them. Ideas of a knowledge or [[information economy]], [[post-industrial society]], [[postmodernism|postmodern]] society, [[network society]], the [[information revolution]], informational capitalism, network capitalism, and the like, have been debated over the last several decades.

Fritz Machlup (1962) introduced the concept of the [[knowledge economy|knowledge industry]]. He began studying the effects of patents on research before distinguishing five sectors of the knowledge sector: education, research and development, mass media, information technologies, information services. Based on this categorization he calculated that in 1959 29% per cent of the GNP in the USA had been produced in knowledge industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Intellectual Capital, Knowledge Management and Organizational Learning|last=Rooney|first=Jim|publisher=Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited|year=2014|isbn=978-1-910309-71-1|location=UK|pages=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Machlup|first1=Fritz|title=The Production and Distribution of Knowledge in the United States|date=1962|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=What's the year referring to?|date=November 2009}}

=== Economic transition ===
[[Peter Drucker]] has argued that there is a transition from an economy based on material goods to one based on knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Drucker]] (1969) ''The Age of Discontinuity''. London: Heinemann&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marc Porat]] distinguishes a primary (information goods and services that are directly used in the production, distribution or processing of information) and a secondary sector (information services produced for internal consumption by government and non-information firms) of the information economy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marc Porat]] (1977) The Information Economy. Washington, DC: US Department of Commerce&lt;/ref&gt;

Porat uses the total value added by the primary and secondary information sector to the GNP as an indicator for the information economy. The [[OECD]] has employed Porat's definition for calculating the share of the information economy in the total economy (e.g. OECD 1981, 1986). Based on such indicators, the information society has been defined as a society where more than half of the GNP is produced and more than half of the employees are active in the information economy.&lt;ref name=deutsch1983&gt;Karl Deutsch (1983) Soziale und politische Aspekte der Informationsgesellschaft. In: Philipp Sonntag (Ed.) (1983) Die Zukunft der Informationsgesellschaft. Frankfurt/Main: Haag &amp; Herchen. pp. 68-88&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Daniel Bell]] the number of employees producing services and information is an indicator for the informational character of a society. "A post-industrial society is based on services. (…) What counts is not raw muscle power, or energy, but information. (…) A post industrial society is one in which the majority of those employed are not involved in the production of tangible goods".&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Bell]] (1976) The Coming of Post-Industrial Society. New York: Basic Books, 127, 348&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alain Touraine]] already spoke in 1971 of the post-industrial society. "The passage to postindustrial society takes place when investment results in the production of symbolic goods that modify values, needs, representations, far more than in the production of material goods or even of 'services'. Industrial society had transformed the means of production: post-industrial society changes the ends of production, that is, culture. (…) The decisive point here is that in postindustrial society all of the economic system is the object of intervention of society upon itself. That is why we can call it the programmed society, because this phrase captures its capacity to create models of management, production, organization, distribution, and consumption, so that such a society appears, at all its functional levels, as the product of an action exercised by the society itself, and not as the outcome of natural laws or cultural specificities" (Touraine 1988: 104). In the programmed society also the area of cultural reproduction including aspects such as information, consumption, health, research, education would be industrialized. That modern society is increasing its capacity to act upon itself means for Touraine that society is reinvesting ever larger parts of production and so produces and transforms itself. This makes Touraine's concept substantially different from that of Daniel Bell who focused on the capacity to process and generate information for efficient society functioning.

[[Jean-François Lyotard]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-François Lyotard]] (1984) ''The Postmodern Condition''. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 5&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that "knowledge has become the {{sic|principle}} force of production over the last few decades". Knowledge would be transformed into a commodity. Lyotard says that postindustrial society makes knowledge accessible to the layman because knowledge and information technologies would diffuse into society and break up Grand Narratives of centralized structures and groups. Lyotard denotes these changing circumstances as postmodern condition or postmodern society.

Similarly to Bell, Peter Otto and Philipp Sonntag (1985) say that an information society is a society where the majority of employees work in information jobs, i.e. they have to deal more with information, signals, symbols, and images than with energy and matter. [[Radovan Richta]] (1977) argues that society has been transformed into a scientific civilization based on services, education, and creative activities. This transformation would be the result of a scientific-technological transformation based on technological progress and the increasing importance of computer technology. Science and technology would become immediate forces of production (Aristovnik 2014: 55).

[[Nico Stehr]] (1994, 2002a, b) says that in the knowledge society a majority of jobs involves working with knowledge. "Contemporary society may be described as a knowledge society based on the extensive penetration of all its spheres of life and institutions by scientific and technological knowledge" (Stehr 2002b: 18). For Stehr, knowledge is a capacity for social action. Science would become an immediate productive force, knowledge would no longer be primarily embodied in machines, but already appropriated nature that represents knowledge would be rearranged according to certain designs and programs (Ibid.: 41-46). For Stehr, the economy of a knowledge society is largely driven not by material inputs, but by symbolic or knowledge-based inputs (Ibid.: 67), there would be a large number of professions that involve working with knowledge, and a declining number of jobs that demand low cognitive skills as well as in manufacturing (Stehr 2002a).

Also [[Alvin Toffler]] argues that knowledge is the central resource in the economy of the information society: "In a Third Wave economy, the central resource – a single word broadly encompassing data, information, images, symbols, culture, ideology, and values –  is actionable knowledge" (Dyson/Gilder/Keyworth/Toffler 1994).

At the end of the twentieth century, the concept of the [[network society]] gained importance in information society theory. For [[Manuel Castells]], network logic is besides information, pervasiveness, flexibility, and convergence a central feature of the information technology paradigm (2000a: 69ff). "One of the key features of informational society is the networking logic of its basic structure, which explains the use of the concept of 'network society'" (Castells 2000: 21). "As an historical trend, dominant functions and processes in the Information Age are increasingly organized around networks. Networks constitute the new social morphology of our societies, and the diffusion of networking logic substantially modifies the operation and outcomes in processes of production, experience, power, and culture" (Castells 2000: 500). For Castells the network society is the result of informationalism, a new technological paradigm.

[[Jan Van Dijk]] (2006) defines the network society as a "social formation with an infrastructure of social and media networks enabling its prime mode of organization at all levels (individual, group/organizational and societal). Increasingly, these networks link all units or parts of this formation (individuals, groups and organizations)" (Van Dijk 2006: 20). For Van Dijk networks have become the nervous system of society, whereas Castells links the concept of the network society to capitalist transformation, Van Dijk sees it as the logical result of the increasing widening and thickening of networks in nature and society. [[Darin Barney]] uses the term for characterizing societies that exhibit two fundamental characteristics: "The first is the presence in those societies of sophisticated – almost exclusively digital – technologies of networked communication and information management/distribution, technologies which form the basic infrastructure mediating an increasing array of social, political and economic practices. (…) The second, arguably more intriguing, characteristic of network societies is the reproduction and institutionalization throughout (and between) those societies of networks as the basic form of human organization and relationship across a wide range of social, political and economic configurations and associations".&lt;ref&gt;[[Darin Barney]] (2003) The Network Society. Cambridge: Polity, 25sq&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critiques ===
The major critique of concepts such as information society, knowledge society, network society, postmodern society, postindustrial society, etc. that has mainly been voiced by critical scholars is that they create the impression that we have entered a completely new type of society. "If there is just more information then it is hard to understand why anyone should suggest that we have before us something radically new" (Webster 2002a: 259). Critics such as [[Frank Webster (sociologist)|Frank Webster]] argue that these approaches stress discontinuity, as if contemporary society had nothing in common with society as it was 100 or 150 years ago. Such assumptions would have ideological character because they would fit with the view that we can do nothing about change and have to adopt to existing political realities (kasiwulaya 2002b: 267).

These critics argue that contemporary society first of all is still a capitalist society oriented towards accumulating economic, political, and [[cultural capital]]. They acknowledge that information society theories stress some important new qualities of society (notably globalization and informatization), but charge that they fail to show that these are attributes of overall capitalist structures. Critics such as Webster insist on the continuities that characterise change. In this way Webster distinguishes between different epochs of capitalism: laissez-faire capitalism of the 19th century, [[corporate capitalism]] in the 20th century, and informational capitalism for the 21st century (kasiwulaya 2006).

For describing contemporary society based on a dialectic of the old and the new, continuity and discontinuity, other critical scholars have suggested several terms like:
* transnational network capitalism, transnational informational capitalism ([[Christian Fuchs (sociologist)|Christian Fuchs]] 2008, 2007): "Computer networks are the technological foundation that has allowed the emergence of global network capitalism, that is, regimes of accumulation, regulation, and discipline that are helping to increasingly base the accumulation of economic, political, and cultural capital on transnational network organizations that make use of cyberspace and other new technologies for global coordination and communication. [...] The need to find new strategies for executing corporate and political domination has resulted in a restructuration of capitalism that is characterized by the emergence of transnational, networked spaces in the economic, political, and cultural system and has been mediated by cyberspace as a tool of global coordination and communication. Economic, political, and cultural space have been restructured; they have become more fluid and dynamic, have enlarged their borders to a transnational scale, and handle the inclusion and exclusion of nodes in flexible ways. These networks are complex due to the high number of nodes (individuals, enterprises, teams, political actors, etc.) that can be involved and the high speed at which a high number of resources is produced and transported within them. But global network capitalism is based on structural inequalities; it is made up of segmented spaces in which central hubs (transnational corporations, certain political actors, regions, countries, Western lifestyles, and worldviews) centralize the production, control, and flows of economic, political, and cultural capital (property, power, definition capacities). This segmentation is an expression of the overall competitive character of contemporary society." (Fuchs 2008: 110+119).
* digital capitalism (Schiller 2000, cf. also [[Peter Glotz]]):&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Glotz]] (1999) Die beschleunigte Gesellschaft. Kulturkämpfe im digitalen Kapitalismus. München: Kindler.&lt;/ref&gt; "networks are directly generalizing the social and cultural range of the capitalist economy as never before" (Schiller 2000: xiv)
* virtual capitalism: the "combination of marketing and the new information technology will enable certain firms to obtain higher profit margins and larger market shares, and will thereby promote greater concentration and centralization of capital" (Dawson/[[John Bellamy Foster]] 1998: 63sq),
* high-tech capitalism&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Fritz Haug]] (2003) High-Tech-Kapitalismus. Hamburg: Argument.&lt;/ref&gt; or informatic capitalism (Fitzpatrick 2002) – to focus on the computer as a guiding technology that has transformed the productive forces of capitalism and has enabled a globalized economy.

Other scholars prefer to speak of information capitalism (Morris-Suzuki 1997) or informational capitalism ([[Manuel Castells]] 2000, [[Christian Fuchs (sociologist)|Christian Fuchs]] 2005, Schmiede 2006a, b). Manuel Castells sees informationalism as a new technological paradigm (he speaks of a mode of development) characterized by "information generation, processing, and transmission" that have become "the fundamental sources of productivity and power" (Castells 2000: 21). The "most decisive historical factor accelerating, channelling and shaping the information technology paradigm, and inducing its associated social forms, was/is the process of capitalist restructuring undertaken since the 1980s, so that the new techno-economic system can be adequately characterized as informational capitalism" (Castells 2000: 18). Castells has added to theories of the information society the idea that in contemporary society dominant functions and processes are increasingly organized around networks that constitute the new social morphology of society (Castells 2000: 500). [[Nicholas Garnham]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Garnham]] (2004) Information Society Theory as Ideology. In: Frank Webster (Ed.) (2004) The Information Society Reader. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; is critical of Castells and argues that the latter’s account is technologically determinist because Castells points out that his approach is based on a dialectic of technology and society in which technology embodies society and society uses technology (Castells 2000: 5sqq). But Castells also makes clear that the rise of a new "mode of development" is shaped by capitalist production, i.e. by society, which implies that technology isn't the only driving force of society.

[[Antonio Negri]] and [[Michael Hardt]] argue that contemporary society is an Empire that is characterized by a singular global logic of capitalist domination that is based on immaterial labour. With the concept of immaterial labour Negri and Hardt introduce ideas of information society discourse into their Marxist account of contemporary capitalism. Immaterial labour would be labour "that creates immaterial products, such as knowledge, information, communication, a relationship, or an emotional response" (Hardt/Negri 2005: 108; cf. also 2000: 280-303), or services, cultural products, knowledge (Hardt/Negri 2000: 290). There would be two forms: intellectual labour that produces ideas, symbols, codes, texts, linguistic figures, images, etc.; and [[affective labor|affective labour]] that produces and manipulates affects such as a feeling of ease, well-being, satisfaction, excitement, passion, joy, sadness, etc. (Ibid.).

Overall, neo-Marxist accounts of the information society have in common that they stress that knowledge, information technologies, and computer networks have played a role in the restructuration and globalization of capitalism and the emergence of a flexible regime of accumulation ([[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] 1989). They warn that new technologies are embedded into societal antagonisms that cause [[structural unemployment]], rising poverty, [[social exclusion]], the [[deregulation]] of the [[welfare state]] and of [[labour rights]], the lowering of wages, welfare, etc.

Concepts such as knowledge society, information society, network society, informational capitalism, postindustrial society, transnational network capitalism, postmodern society, etc. show that there is a vivid discussion in contemporary sociology on the character of contemporary society and the role that technologies, information, communication, and co-operation play in it.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Information society theory discusses the role of information and information technology in society, the question which key concepts shall be used for characterizing contemporary society, and how to define such concepts. It has become a specific branch of contemporary sociology.

==Second and third nature==
{{One source section|date=August 2017}}
Information society is the means of getting information from one place to another.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=22}} As technology has advanced so too has the way people have adapted in sharing this information with each other.

"Second nature" refers a group of experiences that get made over by culture.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=23}} They then get remade into something else that can then take on a new meaning. As a society we transform this process so it becomes something natural to us, i.e. second nature. So, by following a particular pattern created by culture we are able to recognise how we use and move information in different ways. From sharing information via different time zones (such as talking online) to information ending up in a different location (sending a letter overseas) this has all become a habitual process that we as a society take for granted.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=21}}

However, through the process of sharing information vectors have enabled us to spread information even further. Through the use of these vectors information is able to move and then separate from the initial things that enabled them to move.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=24}} From here, something called "third nature" has developed. An extension of second nature, third nature is in control of second nature. It expands on what second nature is limited by. It has the ability to mould information in new and different ways. So, third nature is able to ‘speed up, proliferate, divide, mutate, and beam in on us from else where.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=25}} It aims to create a balance between the boundaries of space and time (see second nature). This can be seen through the telegraph, it was the first successful technology that could send and receive information faster than a human being could move an object.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=26}} As a result different vectors of people have the ability to not only shape culture but create new possibilities that will ultimately shape society.

Therefore, through the use of second nature and third nature society is able to use and explore new vectors of possibility where information can be moulded to create new forms of interaction.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=28}}

==Sociological uses==

In [[sociology]], '''''informational society''''' refers to a [[postmodernity|post-modern]] type of society. Theoreticians like [[Ulrich Beck]], [[Anthony Giddens]] and [[Manuel Castells]] argue that since the 1970s a transformation from [[industrial society]] to informational society has happened on a global scale.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonid Grinin|Grinin, L.]] 2007. Periodization of History: A theoretic-mathematical analysis. In: [http://urss.ru/cgi-bin/db.pl?cp=&amp;page=Book&amp;id=53184&amp;lang=en&amp;blang=en&amp;list=1 ''History &amp; Mathematics'']. Moscow: KomKniga/URSS. P.10-38. {{ISBN|978-5-484-01001-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[steam power]] was the technology standing behind industrial society, so [[information technology]] is seen as the catalyst for the changes in work organisation, societal structure and politics occurring in the late 20th century.

In the book ''[[Future Shock]]'', [[Alvin Toffler]] used the phrase '''super-industrial society''' to describe this type of society.  Other writers and thinkers have used terms like "[[post-industrial society]]" and "post-modern industrial society" with a similar meaning.

== Related terms ==
A number of terms in current use emphasize related but different aspects of the emerging global economic order.  The Information Society intends to be the most encompassing in that an economy is a subset of a society.  The [[Information Age]] is somewhat limiting, in that it refers to a 30-year period between the widespread use of computers and the [[knowledge economy]], rather than an emerging economic order.  The knowledge era is about the nature of the content, not the socioeconomic processes by which it will be traded.  The [[computer revolution]], and knowledge revolution refer to specific revolutionary transitions, rather than the end state towards which we are evolving. The [[Information Revolution]] relates with the well known terms agricultural revolution and [[industrial revolution]].
* The [[information economy]] and the [[knowledge economy]] emphasize the [[Content (media and publishing)|content]] or [[intellectual property]] that is being traded through an information market or [[knowledge market]], respectively. [[Electronic commerce]] and [[electronic business]] emphasize the nature of transactions and running a business, respectively, using the [[Internet]] and [[World-Wide Web]].  The [[digital economy]] focuses on trading bits in [[cyberspace]] rather than atoms in physical space.  The network economy stresses that businesses will work collectively in webs or as part of business ecosystems rather than as stand-alone units. [[Social networking]] refers to the process of collaboration on massive, global scales.  The [[internet economy]] focuses on the nature of markets that are enabled by the Internet.
* Knowledge services and knowledge value put content into an economic context. Knowledge services integrates [[Knowledge management]], within a [[Knowledge organization]], that trades in a [[Knowledge market]]. In order for individuals to receive more knowledge, surveillance is used. This relates to the use of Drones as a tool in order to gather knowledge on other individuals. Although seemingly synonymous, each term conveys more than nuances or slightly different views of the same thing.  Each term represents one attribute of the likely nature of economic activity in the emerging post-industrial society.  Alternatively, the new economic order will incorporate all of the above plus other attributes that have not yet fully emerged.
* In connection with the development of the information society, appeared [[information pollution]], evolving [[information ecology]] - associated with information [[hygiene]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240515256_Information_ecology__a_viewpoint?ev=prf_pub Eryomin A.L. Information ecology - a viewpoint]// International Journal of Environmental Studies. - 1998. - Vol. 54. - pp. 241-253.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, It is important to selectively select the information. Due to information revolution, the amount of information is puzzling. Among these, we need to develop techniques that refine information. This is called ''data mining.'' It is an engineering term, but it is used in sociology. In other words, if the amount of information was competitive in the past, the quality of information is important today.

==Intellectual property considerations==
One of the central paradoxes of the information society is that it makes information easily reproducible, leading to a variety of freedom/control problems relating to [[intellectual property]]. Essentially, business and capital, whose place becomes that of producing and selling information and knowledge, seems to require control over this new resource so that it can effectively be managed and sold as the basis of the information economy. However, such control can prove to be both technically and socially problematic. Technically because [[copy protection]] is often easily circumvented and socially ''rejected'' because the users and citizens of the information society can prove to be unwilling to accept such absolute [[commodification]] of the facts and information that compose their environment.

Responses to this concern range from the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] in the United States (and similar legislation elsewhere) which make [[copy protection]] (see [[Digital Rights Management|DRM]]) circumvention illegal, to the [[free software]], [[open source]] and [[copyleft]] movements, which seek to encourage and disseminate the "freedom" of various information products (traditionally both as in "gratis" or free of cost, and liberty, as in freedom to use, explore and share).

Caveat: Information society is often used by politicians meaning something like "we all do internet now"; the sociological term information society (or informational society) has some deeper implications about change of societal structure. Because we lack political control of intellectual property, we are lacking in a concrete map of issues, an analysis of costs and benefits, and functioning political groups that are unified by common interests representing different opinions of this diverse situation that are prominent in the information society.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, James. “A Politics of Intellectual Property: Environmentalism for the Net?” Duke Law Journal, vol. 47, no. 1, 1997, pp. 87–116.

==Life and work==
Jack Collom was born John Aldridge Collom in [[Chicago]] on November 8, 1931.&lt;ref name="tributes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crist-mort.tributes.com/dignitymemorial/obituary/Jack-Aldridge-Collom-104946242|title=Jack Collom  Obituary  – Boulder, Colorado – Crist Mortuary|website=crist-mort.tributes.com|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="poetryfoundation.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/jack-collom|title=Jack Collom|date=3 July 2017|website=Poetry Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in the small town of [[Western Springs, Illinois]],&lt;ref name="omniverse.us"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://omniverse.us/featured-essay-jack-collom/|title=Featured Essay: Jack Collom – OmniVerse|website=omniverse.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; spent much of his time [[birdwatching]],&lt;ref name="woodlandpattern.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woodlandpattern.org/archives/poems/?poem=139|title=Jack Collom · Poems · Woodland Pattern|website=www.woodlandpattern.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over the years became an inveterate bird-watcher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-931157-01|title=''Red Car Goes By: Selected Poems 1955–2000'' (Reviewed)|publisher=''Publisher's Weekly''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collom moved to [[Fraser, Colorado]], in 1947.&lt;ref name="omniverse.us"/&gt; He studied Forestry at [[Colorado State University|Colorado A&amp;M]] College where he earned a B.S. in 1952.&lt;ref name="foundationforcontemporaryarts.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foundationforcontemporaryarts.org/recipients/jack-collom|title=Jack Collom :: Foundation for Contemporary Arts|website=www.foundationforcontemporaryarts.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, he spent four years in the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]],&lt;ref name="foundationforcontemporaryarts.org"/&gt; and he started writing poetry in 1955 while stationed in [[Tripoli]], Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1990/0924/lpoet.html|title=New Twist for Nature Poetry|first=M. S.|last=Mason|date=24 September 1990|publisher=|via=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; His unit was next stationed at [[Neubiberg]], a base just south of [[Munich]], in [[Bavaria]]. It is there he met his first wife (a native German), in 1956. After his discharge from the military, he moved back to the US after a brief time living in Germany, and worked in factories for twenty years while writing poetry.&lt;ref name="woodlandpattern.org"/&gt;

He received his B.A. in English (1972) and M.A. in English literature (1974) from the [[University of Colorado]],&lt;ref name="foundationforcontemporaryarts.org"/&gt; where he had studied on the [[G.I. Bill of Rights|G.I. Bill]].&lt;ref name="woodlandpattern.org"/&gt; In 1974, he began teaching in the "Poetry-in-the-Schools" programs in Colorado, Wyoming, and Nebraska.&lt;ref name="kgnu"/&gt; In 1980, he began teaching poetry in the public schools of New York City,&lt;ref name="kgnu"/&gt; by way of the  "Poets In Public Service" and "Teachers &amp; Writers" programs.&lt;ref name="jacketmagazine.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jacketmagazine.com/36/r-collom-hejinian-rb-grenier.shtml|title=Jacket 36 – Late 2008 – Jack Collom and Lyn Hejinian: «Situations, Sings» (collaborative poems), reviewed by Robert Grenier|website=jacketmagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collom continued to teach creative writing to children for the next 35 years, in both elementary and secondary schools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecafereview.com/fall-2014-poets-jack-collom/|title=Jack Collom – The Cafe Review|date=12 January 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he developed a pedagogy for this type of educational approach.&lt;ref name="eventful.com"/&gt;

{{quote|I think of my general approach as organic, inductive, building from the children's familiars up, rather than teaching them intricate forms to master, or attempting to initiate them into a sophisticated sensibility. Time enough for that, and to avoid its pitfalls, when and if they have written personally for some while, and of course writing personally in some strong sense is what the most developed poetry still is. Heavy programming from me at this point would draw out less of their particular gifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/onteaching/how-i-teach-poetry-schools|title=How I Teach Poetry in the Schools|first=Jack|last=Collom|date=April 23, 2014|website=poets.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Subsequently, [[Teachers &amp; Writers Collaborative]] published three books of Collom's essays and commentary on this experience (which included the young students' poems), notably ''Poetry Everywhere'' and ''Moving Windows''.&lt;ref name="woodlandpattern.org"/&gt;

From 1966 to 1977, he published the work of many writers in a [[Literary magazine|little magazine]] called "The".&lt;ref name="kgnu"/&gt; He was twice awarded Poetry Fellowships from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]],&lt;ref name="jacketmagazine.com"/&gt; and received a [[Foundation for Contemporary Arts]] Grants to Artists award (2012).&lt;ref name="foundationforcontemporaryarts.org" /&gt; From 1986 until his death in 2017, Collom taught at [[Naropa University]]'s [[Jack Kerouac School]] of Disembodied Poetics as an [[Professor|adjunct professor]],&lt;ref name="poetryfoundation.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="naropa" /&gt; where he shaped Writing Outreach, a community creative-writing project, into a course.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jackkerouacschool.org/2013/02/13/folio-jks-faculty-reading-to-celebrate-recent-publications/|title=FOLIO: JKS Faculty Reading to Celebrate Recent Publications|first=|last=administrator|date=February 13, 2013|publisher=Jack Kerouac School /Folio: Events Newsletter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="naropa.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magazine.naropa.edu/2011-fall/features/from-nature-to-nurture.php|title=From Nature to Nurture|website=magazine.naropa.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, he pioneered Eco-Lit,&lt;ref name="corpse.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corpse.org/archives/issue_9/critiques/collom.htm|title=Exquisite Corpse – A Journal of Letters and Life|website=www.corpse.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the first ecology literature courses ever offered in the United States.&lt;ref name="dailycamera.com" /&gt; Some of his accomplishments as an environmentalist-poet are documented in ''American Environmental Leaders: From Colonial Times to the Present''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.credoreference.com/book/ghael|title=American environmental leaders from colonial times to the present|first1=Anne|last1=Becher|first2=Joseph|last2=Richey|date=5 July 2017|publisher=Grey House Pub.|via=Open WorldCat}}&lt;/ref&gt; His nature writings and essays about the environment were published in various venues, including ''ecopoetics'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ecopoetics.wordpress.com|title=ecopoetics|website=ecopoetics}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Alphabet of Trees: A Guide to Writing Nature Poetry'',&lt;ref name="corpse.org"/&gt; and ''ISLE'', the journal of Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and the Environment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://academic.oup.com/isle/article-abstract/7/2/243/731906/In-the?redirectedFrom=fulltext Interdiscip Stud Lit Environ (2000) Volume 7 (Issue 2): 243].

He read and taught throughout the United States, in Mexico, [[Costa Rica]], Austria, Belgium, and Germany. In 2008, he was the plenary speaker at the "Poetic Ecologies" conference at the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]].&lt;ref name="omniverse.us"/&gt; In 2009, he led a three-week Creativity and Aging Program at Woodland Pattern in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name="woodlandpattern.org"/&gt;

He worked with numerous dancers, visual artists and musician/composers, and recorded three CDs: ''Calluses of Poetry''&lt;ref&gt;''Calluses of Poetry'', audiobook/CD produced by Treehouse Press, 1996 {{ISBN|9780965187800}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Colors Born of Shadow'',&lt;ref&gt;''Colors Born of Shadow'', audiobook/CD produced by Treehouse Press, 1999 ASIN B000F7G0IY&lt;/ref&gt; with Ken Bernstein,&lt;ref name="kgnu"/&gt; and ''Blue Yodel Blue Heron'', with Dan Hankin and Sierra Collom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Blue Yodel Blue Heron|publisher=Baksun Books|year=2002|isbn=9781887997539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, his adopted hometown of Boulder, Colorado, declared and celebrated a "Jack Collom Day".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Personal life ==
{{quote box
 |quote =I felt, and events have born out, that eco-lit was really an upcoming topic for the world. I was motivated by the cause of ecology—saving nature and ourselves from our own foolish extinction through pollution and overuse of resources—and the fact that it's an art with admirable philosophical achievements. But also for the fun of it. Humor is an important part of the class, and we can go from discussing the most tragic thing to cracking jokes. I'm for that kind of juxtaposition, which sometimes goes against expectations because people want to look upon nature very solemnly due to its beauty or endangered status. But I think humor is as deep as anything.

'''Legal naturalism''' is a term coined by [[Olufemi Taiwo]] to describe a current in the social philosophy of [[Karl Marx]] which can be interpreted as one of [[Natural Law]]. Taiwo considered it the manifestation of Natural Law in a [[dialectical materialism|dialectical materialist]] context.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20100">'''{{Main|List of invasive species}}'''

This is a '''list of [[invasive species]] in Asia'''. A species is regarded as invasive if it has been introduced by human action to a location, area, or region where it did not previously occur naturally (i.e., is not a [[native species]]), becomes capable of establishing a breeding population in the new location without further intervention by humans, and becomes a ''pest'' in the new location, directly threatening agriculture and/or the local [[biodiversity]].

The term '''invasive species''' refers to a subset of those species defined as [[introduced species]]. If a species has been introduced but remains local, and is not problematic to agriculture or to the local biodiversity, then it cannot be considered to be an invasive species and does not belong on this list.

This is a '''list of [[invasive species]] in [[North America]]'''. A species is regarded as invasive if it has been introduced by human action to a location, area, or region where it did not previously occur naturally (i.e., is not a [[native species]]), becomes capable of establishing a breeding population in the new location without further intervention by humans, and becomes a pest in the new location, directly threatening human industry, such as agriculture, or the local [[biodiversity]].

The term ''invasive species'' refers to a subset of those species defined as [[introduced species]]. If a species has been introduced, but remains local, and is not problematic for human industry or the local biodiversity, then it is not considered invasive, and does not belong on this list.

'''''Manilkara bidentata''''' is a species of ''[[Manilkara]]'' native to a large area of northern [[South America]], [[Central America]] and the [[Caribbean]].  Common names include '''bulletwood''',&lt;ref&gt;{{PLANTS|id=MABI5|taxon=Manilkara bidentata|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''balatá''', '''ausubo''', '''massaranduba''', and (ambiguously) "[[Cow-tree (disambiguation)|cow-tree]]".

Balatá is a large [[tree]], growing to {{convert|30–45|m|abbr=on}} tall. The [[leaf|leaves]] are alternate, elliptical, entire, and {{convert|10–20|cm|abbr=on}} long. The [[flower]]s are white, and are produced at the beginning of the rainy season. The [[fruit]] is a yellow [[Berry (botany)|berry]], {{convert|3–5|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter, which is edible; it contains one (occasionally two) [[seed]](s). Its [[latex]] is used industrially for products such as [[chicle]].

==Uses==
[[File:Logging Bulletwood Berbice-Guyana JK.JPG|thumb|left|Harvesting bulletwood in [[Guyana]]]]
[[File:Tropenmuseum Royal Tropical Institute Objectnumber 1336-6 Zweep van balata.jpg|thumb|A whip handle of balatá, made before 1939]]

The [[latex]] is extracted in the same manner in which sap is extracted from the [[rubber tree]]. It is then dried to form an [[Elasticity (physics)|inelastic]] rubber-like material. It is almost identical to [[gutta-percha]] (produced from a closely related [[southeast Asia]]n tree), and is sometimes called ''gutta-balatá''.

Balatá was often used in the production of high-quality [[golf ball]]s, to use as the outer layer of the ball. Balatá-covered balls have a high spin rate, but do not travel as far as most balls with a [[Surlyn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.dupont.com/Surlyn/en_US/|title=Ionomer Resin- DuPont™ Surlyn® - DuPont USA|website=2.dupont.com|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; cover. Due to the nondurable nature of the material the golf club strikes, balatá-covered balls do not last long before needing to be replaced. While once favored by professional and low-handicap players, they are now obsolete, replaced by newer Surlyn and [[polyurethane|urethane]] technology.

Today, Brazil is the largest producer of Massaranduba wood, where it is cut in the Amazon rainforest.

The tree is a [[hardwood]] with a red heart, which is used for [[furniture]] and as a [[construction]] material where it grows. Locals often refer to it as '''bulletwood''' for its extremely hard wood, which is so dense that it does not float in water. Drilling is necessary to drive nailed connections. In trade, it is occasionally (and incorrectly) called "[[brazilwood]]".

The fruit, like that of the related sapodilla (''[[Manilkara zapota|M. zapota]]''), is edible.

Though its [[heartwood]] may present in a shade of purple, ''Manilkara bidentata'' should not be confused with another tropical tree widely known as "purpleheart", ''[[Peltogyne]] pubescens''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.simonandshock.com/lumber.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106165409/http://www.simonandshock.com/lumber.htm |archivedate=2009-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This timber is being used to produce outdoor furniture and is being marketed as "Pacific Jarrah" in Australia.

The '''maximum power principle''' or '''Lotka's principle'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tilley |first1=David Rogers |title=Howard T. Odum’s contribution to the laws of energy |journal=Ecological Modelling |date=2004 |volume=178 |pages=121–125 |doi=10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2003.12.032 |url=http://www.unicamp.br/fea/ortega/extensao/davidtilley-2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been proposed as the fourth [[Principles of energetics|principle of energetics]] in [[Open system (systems theory)|open system]] [[thermodynamics]], where an example of an open system is a biological cell. According to [[Howard T. Odum]], "The maximum power principle can be stated: During self-organization, system designs develop and prevail that maximize power intake, energy transformation, and those uses that reinforce production and efficiency."&lt;ref&gt;H.T. Odum 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;311&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Chen (2006) has located the origin of the statement of maximum power as a formal principle in a tentative proposal by [[Alfred J. Lotka]] (1922a, b). Lotka's statement sought to explain the Darwinian notion of evolution with reference to a physical principle. Lotka's work was subsequently developed by the [[systems ecology|systems ecologist]] [[Howard T. Odum]] in collaboration with the Chemical Engineer Richard C. Pinkerton, and later advanced by the Engineer [[Myron Tribus]].

While Lotka's work may have been a first attempt to formalise evolutionary thought in mathematical terms, it followed similar observations made by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Vito Volterra|Volterra]] and Ludwig [[Boltzmann]], for example, throughout the sometimes controversial history of natural philosophy.  In contemporary literature it is most commonly associated with the work of Howard T. Odum.

The significance of Odum's approach was given greater support during the 1970s, amid times of [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]], where, as Gilliland (1978, pp.&amp;nbsp;100) observed, there was an emerging need for a new method of analysing the importance and value of energy resources to economic and environmental production. A field known as [[energy analysis]], itself associated with [[net energy]] and [[EROEI]], arose to fulfill this analytic need. However, in energy analysis intractable theoretical and practical difficulties arose when using the [[energy unit]] to understand, a) the conversion among concentrated fuel types (or [[energy types]]), b)  the contribution of labour, and c) the contribution of the environment.

==Philosophy and theory==
Lotka said (1922b: 151): 
{{cquote|The principle of natural selection reveals itself as capable of yielding information which the first and second laws of thermodynamics are not competent to furnish. The two fundamental laws of thermodynamics are, of course, insufficient to determine the course of events in a physical system. They tell us that certain things cannot happen, but they do not tell us what does happen.}}

Gilliland noted that these difficulties in analysis in turn required some new theory to adequately explain the interactions and transactions of these different energies (different concentrations of fuels, labour and environmental forces). Gilliland (Gilliland 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;101) suggested that Odum's statement of the maximum power principle (H.T.Odum 1978, pp.&amp;nbsp;54–87) was, perhaps, an adequate expression of the requisite theory:
{{cquote|That theory, as it is expressed by the maximum power principle, addresses the empirical question of why systems of any type or size organize themselves into the patterns observed. Such a question assumes that physical laws govern system function. It does not assume, for example, that the system comprising economic production is driven by consumers; rather that the whole cycle of production-consumption is structured and driven by physical laws.}}

This theory Odum called maximum power theory. In order to formulate maximum power theory Gilliland observed that Odum had added another law (the maximum power principle) to the already well established laws of thermodynamics. In 1978 Gilliland wrote that Odum's new law had not yet been validated (Gilliland 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;101). Gilliland stated that in maximum power theory the [[second law efficiency]] of thermodynamics required an additional physical concept: "the concept of second law efficiency under maximum power" (Gilliland 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;101):

{{cquote|Neither the first or second law of thermodynamics include a measure of the rate at which energy transformations or processes occur. The concept of maximum power incorporates time into measures of energy transformations. It provides information about the rate at which one kind of energy is transformed into another as well as the efficiency of that transformation.}} 
     
In this way the concept of maximum power was being used as a principle to quantitatively describe the selective law of biological [[evolution]]. Perhaps H.T.Odum's most concise statement of this view was (1970, p.&amp;nbsp;62):

{{cquote|Lotka provided the theory of natural selection as a maximum power organizer; under competitive conditions systems are selected which use their energies in various structural-developing actions so as to maximize their use of available energies. By this theory systems of cycles which drain less energy lose out in comparative development. However Leopold and Langbein have shown that streams in developing erosion profiles, meander systems, and tributary networks disperse their potential energies more slowly than if their channels were more direct. These two statements might be harmonized by an optimum efficiency maximum power principle (Odum and Pinkerton 1955), which indicates that energies which are converted too rapidly into heat are not made available to the systems own use because they are not fed back through storages into useful pumping, but instead do random stirring of the environment.}}

The Odum–Pinkerton approach to Lotka's proposal was to apply [[Ohm's law]] – and the associated [[maximum power theorem]] (a result in [[electric power|electrical power]] systems) – to ecological systems. Odum and Pinkerton defined "power" in electronic terms as the rate of [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]], where Work is understood as a "[[Thermodynamic free energy|useful energy]] transformation". &lt;!-- (In electrical engineering and physics, "[[Power (physics)|power]]" is defined as the rate of doing work or consuming energy, without any distinction between "useful energy" and any other energy.) --&gt;The concept of maximum power can therefore be defined as the '''''maximum''' rate of '''useful''' energy transformation''. Hence the underlying philosophy aims to unify the theories and associated laws of electronic and thermodynamic systems with biological systems. This approach presupposed an [[Analogical models|analogical view]] which sees the world as an ecological-electronic-economic engine.

==Proposals for maximum power principle as 4th thermodynamic law==
{{quotation|It has been pointed out by [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]] that the fundamental object of contention in the life-struggle, in the evolution of the organic world, is available energy. In accord with this observation is the principle that, in the struggle for existence, the advantage must go to those organisms whose energy-capturing devices are most efficient in directing available energy into channels favorable to the preservation of the species.|A.J. Lotka 1922a, p. 147}}

{{quotation|...it seems to this author appropriate to unite the biological and physical traditions by giving the Darwinian principle of natural selection the citation as the ''fourth law of thermodynamics'', since it is the controlling principle in rate of heat generation and efficiency settings in irreversible biological processes.|H.T. Odum 1963, p. 437}}

{{quotation|...it may be time to recognize the maximum power principle as the fourth thermodynamic law as suggested by Lotka.|H.T. Odum 1994}}

==Definition in words==
{{cquote|The maximum power principle can be stated: During self-organization, system designs develop and prevail that maximize power intake, energy transformation, and those uses that reinforce production and efficiency. (H.T. Odum 1995, p. 311)}}

{{cquote|...the maximum power principle ... states that systems which maximize their flow of energy survive in competition. In other words, rather than merely accepting the fact that more energy per unit of time is transformed in a process which operates at maximum power, this principle says that systems organize and structure themselves naturally to maximize power. Systems regulate themselves according to the maximum power principle. Over time, the systems which maximize power are selected for whereas those that do not are selected against and eventually eliminated. ... Odum argues ... that the free market mechanisms of the economy effectively do the same thing for human systems and that our economic evolution to date is a product of that selection process. (Gilliland 1978, pp. 101–102)}}

Odum et al. viewed the [[maximum power theorem]] as a principle of '''power-efficiency reciprocity selection''' with wider application than just electronics. For example, Odum saw it in open systems operating on solar energy, like both photovoltaics and photosynthesis (1963, p.&amp;nbsp;438). Like the maximum power theorem, Odum's statement of the maximum power principle relies on the notion of 'matching', such that high-quality energy maximizes power by matching and amplifying energy (1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;262, 541): "in surviving designs a matching of high-quality energy with larger amounts of low-quality energy is likely to occur" (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;260). As with electronic circuits, the resultant rate of energy transformation will be at a maximum at an intermediate power efficiency. In 2006, T.T. Cai, C.L. Montague and J.S. Davis said that, "The maximum power principle is a potential guide to understanding the patterns and processes of ecosystem development and sustainability. The principle predicts the selective persistence of ecosystem designs that capture a previously untapped energy source." (2006, p.&amp;nbsp;317). In several texts H.T. Odum gave the [[Atwood machine]] as a practical example of the 'principle' of maximum power.

=== Mathematical definition ===
The mathematical definition given by H.T. Odum is formally analogous to the definition provided on the [[maximum power theorem]] article. (For a brief explanation of Odum's approach to the relationship between ecology and electronics see [[Howard T. Odum#Ecological analog of Ohm.27s Law|Ecological Analog of Ohm's Law]])

==Contemporary ideas==
Whether or not the principle of maximum power efficiency can be considered the fourth law of thermodynamics and the fourth principle of energetics is moot. Nevertheless, H.T. Odum also proposed a corollary of maximum power as the organisational principle of evolution, describing the evolution of [[microbiological]] systems, [[economic systems]], [[planet]]ary systems, and [[astrophysical]] systems. He called this corollary the '''[[Maximum empower#Empower and maximum empower|maximum empower]]''' principle.  This was suggested because, as S.E. Jorgensen, M.T. Brown, H.T. Odum (2004) note,

{{quotation|Maximum power might be misunderstood to mean giving priority to low level processes. ... However, the higher level transformation processes are just as important as the low level processes. ... Therefore, Lotka's principle is clarified by stating it as the principle of self organization for maximum ''empower''. |p. 18}}

C. Giannantoni may have confused matters when he wrote "The "Maximum Em-Power Principle" (Lotka–Odum) is generally considered the "Fourth Thermodynamic Principle" (mainly) because of its practical validity for a very wide class of physical and biological systems" (C. Giannantoni 2002, § 13, p.&amp;nbsp;155). Nevertheless,  Giannantoni has proposed the Maximum Em-Power Principle as the fourth principle of thermodynamics (Giannantoni 2006).

The preceding discussion is incomplete. The "maximum power" was discovered several times independently, in physics and engineering, see: Novikov (1957), El-Wakil (1962), and Curzon and Ahlborn (1975). The incorrectness of this analysis and design evolution conclusions was demonstrated by Gyftopoulos (2002).

'''Moisture expansion''' is the tendency of matter to change in volume in response to a change in moisture content. The macroscopic effect is similar to that of [[thermal expansion]] but the microscopic causes are very different. Moisture expansion is caused by [[hygroscopy]].

'''Nature-based solutions''' ('''NBS''' or '''NbS''') refers to the [[sustainable management]] and use of nature for tackling socio-environmental challenges. The challenges include issues such as [[climate change]], [[water security]], [[water pollution]], [[food security]], [[human health]], and [[disaster]] [[risk]] management. 

A definition by the [[European Union]] states that these solutions are "inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simultaneously provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build [[Resilience (engineering and construction)|resilience]]. The [http://www.naturebasedsolutionsinitiative.org/about/ Nature-based Solutions Initiative] meanwhile defines them as "actions that work with and enhance nature so as to help people adapt to change and disasters". Such solutions bring more, and more diverse, nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-efficient and systemic interventions".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.think-nature.eu/|title=thinknature|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With NBS, healthy, resilient and diverse [[ecosystems]] (whether natural, managed or newly created) can provide solutions for the benefit of societies and overall [[biodiversity]].

For instance, the restoration or protection of [[mangroves]] along coastlines utilizes a nature-based solution to accomplish several things. Mangroves moderate the impact of waves and wind on coastal settlements or cities and sequester CO&lt;sub&gt;2.&lt;/sub&gt; . They also provide safe nurseries for marine life that can be the basis for sustaining populations of fish that local populations may depend on. Additionally, the mangrove forests can help control coastal erosion resulting from sea level rise. Similarly, in cities [[green roofs]] or walls are nature-based solutions that can be used to moderate the impact of high temperatures, capture storm water, abate [[pollution]], and act as carbon sinks, while enhancing [[biodiversity]].

Conservation approaches and environment management initiatives have been carried out for decades. What is new is that the benefits of such nature-based solutions to human well-being have been articulated well more recently. Even if the term itself is still being framed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-01-12|title=‘Nature-based solutions’ is the latest green jargon that means more than you might think|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/541133b|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=541|issue=7636|pages=133–134|doi=10.1038/541133b|bibcode=2017Natur.541R.133.}}&lt;/ref&gt; examples of nature-based solutions can be found all over the world, and imitated. Nature-based solutions are on their way to being mainstreamed in national and international policies and programmes (e.g. climate change policy, law, infrastructure investment and financing mechanisms).{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} For example, the theme for [[World Water Day]] 2018 was "Nature for water" and by [[UN-Water]]'s accompanying [[UN World Water Development Report]] had the title "Nature-based Solutions for Water".&lt;ref&gt;UN-Water (2018) [http://www.unwater.org/publications/world-water-development-report-2018/ World Water Development Report 2018: Nature-based Solutions for Water], Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;

Societies increasingly face challenges such as [[climate change]], [[urbanization]], jeopardized [[food security]] and [[water resource]] provision, and [[disaster]] [[risk]]. One approach to answer these challenges is to singularly rely on technological strategies. An alternative approach is to manage the [[Socio-ecological system|(socio-)ecological systems]] in a comprehensive way in order to sustain and potentially increase the delivery of ecosystem services to humans. In this context, nature-based solutions (NBS) have recently been put forward by practitioners and quickly thereafter by [[policymakers]]. These solutions stress the sustainable use of nature in solving coupled environmental-social-economic challenges. 

While [[ecosystem services]] are often valued in terms of immediate benefits to human well-being and economy, NBS focus on the benefits to people and the environment itself, to allow for sustainable solutions that are able to respond to environmental change and [[hazard]]s in the long-term. NBS go beyond the traditional biodiversity conservation and management principles by "re-focusing" the debate on humans and specifically integrating societal factors such as human well-being and [[poverty reduction]], [[Socioeconomic development|socio-economic development]], and [[governance]] principles. 

With respect to water issues, NBS can achieve the following, according to the [[World Water Development Report]] 2018 by [[UN-Water]]:&lt;ref&gt;UN-Water (2018) [http://www.unwater.org/publications/world-water-development-report-2018/ World Water Development Report 2018], Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Use natural processes to enhance water availability (e.g., [[soil]] moisture retention, [[groundwater recharge]]),  
* Improve [[water quality]] (e.g., [[Wetland|natural wetlands]] and [[constructed wetlands]] to treat [[wastewater]], [[riparian buffer]] strips), and  
* Reduce risks associated with water‐related disasters and climate change (e.g., [[floodplain restoration]], [[green roofs]]).

These organisations refer to "policies and measures that take into account the role of ecosystem services in reducing the vulnerability of society to climate change, in a multi-sectoral and multi-scale approach".&lt;ref name="Cowan3" /&gt;

Similarly, the concept of [[ecological engineering]] generally refers to "protecting, restoring (i.e. ecosystem restoration) or modifying ecological systems to increase the quantity, quality and sustainability of particular services they provide, or to build new ecological systems that provide services that would otherwise be provided through more conventional engineering, based on non-renewable resources".&lt;ref name="Borsje8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barot9" /&gt;

== Objectives and framing ==

The general objective of NBS is clear, namely the sustainable management and use of nature for tackling societal challenges.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature). 2016. Resolution 077 World Conservation Congress 2016, Hawai’i (https://portals.iucn.org/congress/motion/077)
17. European Commission. 2016. Horizon2020 Work Programme 2016–2017 – 12. Climate action, environment, resource efficiency &amp; raw materials, 99 pp. (http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2016_2017/main/h2020-wp1617-climate_en.pdf)
&lt;/ref&gt; However, different stakeholders view NBS from other perspectives.&lt;ref name="Eggermont15"&gt;Eggermont, H., E. Balian, J. M.N. Azevedo, V. Beumer, T. Brodin, J. Claudet, B. Fady, M. Grube, H. Keune, P. Lamarque, K. Reuter, M. Smitt, C. Van Ham, W.W. Weisser, X. Le Roux. 2015. Nature-based solutions: New influence for Environmental Management and Research in Europe. GAIA Ecological Perspectives 24/4: 243–248.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[IUCN]]&lt;ref name="IUCN16"&gt;IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature). 2016. Resolution 077 World Conservation Congress 2016, Hawai’i (https://portals.iucn.org/congress/motion/077)&lt;/ref&gt; defines NBS as "actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems, which address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, while simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits". This framing puts the need for well-managed and restored ecosystems at the heart of NBS, with the overarching goal of "Supporting the achievement of society's development goals and safeguard human well-being in ways that reflect cultural and societal values and enhance the resilience of ecosystems, their capacity for renewal and the provision of services". 

In the context of the ongoing political debate on jobs and growth (main drivers of the current EU policy agenda), the European Commission underlines that NBS can transform environmental and societal challenges into innovation opportunities, by turning [[natural capital]] into a source for green growth and sustainable development.&lt;ref name="European Commission 2015" /&gt; In their view, NBS to societal challenges are "solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simultaneously provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. Such solutions bring more, and more diverse, nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-efficient and systemic interventions.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"&gt;European Commission. 2016. Horizon2020 Work Programme 2016–2017 – 12. Climate action, environment, resource efficiency &amp; raw materials, 99 pp. (http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2016_2017/main/h2020-wp1617-climate_en.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;" 

This framing is somewhat broader, and puts economy and social assets at the heart of NBS as importantly as sustaining environmental conditions. It shares similarities with the definition proposed by Maes and Jacobs (2015)&lt;ref&gt;Maes, J., S. Jacobs. 2015. Conservation Letters {{doi|10.1111/conl.12216}}&lt;/ref&gt; defining NBS as "any transition to a use of ES with decreased input of non-renewable natural capital and increased investment in renewable natural processes". In their view, development and evaluation of NBS spans three basic requirements: (1) decrease of fossil fuel input per produced unit; (2) lowering of systemic trade-offs and increasing synergies between ES; and (3) increasing labor input and jobs. Here, nature is seen as a tool to inspire more systemic solutions to societal problems.

Whatever definition used, promoting sustainability and the increased role of natural, self-sustained processes relying on [[biodiversity]], are inherent to NBS. They constitute actions easily seen as positive for a wide range of stakeholders, as they bring about benefits at environmental, economic and social levels. As a consequence, the concept of NBS is gaining acceptance outside the conservation community (e.g. urban planning) and is now on its way to be mainstreamed into policies and programmes (climate change policy, law, infrastructure investment and financing mechanisms).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

== Types ==

[[File:Fig 2 NbS.jpg|thumb|upright=1.46|Schematic presentation of the NBS typology.&lt;ref name="Eggermont15"/&gt;]]

In 2015,&lt;ref name="Eggermont15"/&gt; the European network [http://www.biodiversa.org BiodivERsA] mobilized a range of scientists, research donors and stakeholders and proposed a typology characterizing NBS along two gradients. 1. "how much engineering of biodiversity and ecosystems is involved in NBS", and 2. "how many ecosystem services and stakeholder groups are targeted by a given NBS". The typology highlights that NBS can involve very different actions on ecosystems (from protection to management and even creation of new ecosystems) and is based on the assumption that the higher the number of services and stakeholder groups targeted, the lower the capacity to maximize the delivery of each service and simultaneously fulfil the specific needs of all stakeholder groups. As such, three types of NBS are distinguished (Figure 2):

=== Type 1 – Minimal intervention in ecosystems ===
Type 1 NBS consists of no or minimal intervention in ecosystems, with the objectives of maintaining or improving the delivery of a range of ES both inside and outside of these conserved ecosystems. Examples include the protection of mangroves in coastal areas to limit risks associated to extreme weather conditions and provide benefits and opportunities to local populations; and the establishment of marine protected areas to conserve biodiversity within these areas while exporting biomass into fishing grounds. This type of NBS is connected to, for example, the concept of [[Man and the Biosphere Programme|biosphere reserves]] which incorporates core protected areas for nature conservation and buffer zones and transition areas where people live and work in a sustainable way.

=== Type 2 – Some interventions in ecosystems and landscapes ===
Type 2 NBS corresponds to management approaches that develop sustainable and multifunctional ecosystems and landscapes (extensively or intensively managed). These types improve the delivery of selected ES compared to what would be obtained with a more conventional intervention. Examples include innovative planning of agricultural landscapes to increase their multi-functionality; and approaches for enhancing tree species and genetic diversity to increase forest resilience to extreme events. This type of NBS is strongly connected to concepts like natural systems agriculture,&lt;ref name="Jackson1" /&gt; agro-ecology,&lt;ref&gt;Alteri, M.A. 1989. Agroecology – a new research and development paradigm for world agriculture. Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment 27: 37–36.&lt;/ref&gt; and evolutionary-orientated forestry.&lt;ref&gt;Lefèvre F. et al. 2014. Considering evolutionary processes in adaptive forestry. Annals of Forest Science 71: 723 – 739.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Type 3 – Managing ecosystems in extensive ways ===
Type 3 NBS consists of managing ecosystems in very extensive ways or even creating new ecosystems (e.g., artificial ecosystems with new assemblages of organisms for green roofs and walls to mitigate city warming and clean polluted air). Type 3 is linked to concepts like green and blue infrastructures and objectives like restoration of heavily degraded or polluted areas and greening cities.

Type 1 and 2 would typically fall within the IUCN NBS framework, whereas Type 2 and moreover Type 3 are often exemplified by EC for turning natural capital into a source for green growth and sustainable development.

=== Hybrid solutions ===
Hybrid solutions exist along this gradient both in space and time. For instance, at landscape scale, mixing protected and managed areas could be needed to fulfil multi-functionality and sustainability goals. Similarly, a [[constructed wetland]] can be developed as a type 3 but, when well established, may subsequently be preserved and surveyed as a type 1.

== Examples ==

Demonstrating the benefits of nature and healthy ecosystems and showcasing the return on investment they can offer is necessary in order to increase awareness, but also to provide support and guidance on how to implement NBS. A large number of initiatives around the world already highlight the effectiveness of NBS approaches to address a wide range of societal challenges.

==== East Kolkata wetlands ====
In 2018, [[The Hindu]] reported that the [[East Kolkata wetlands]], the world's largest organic sewage treatment facility had been used to clean the sewage of Kolkata in an organic manner by using algae for several decades. In use since the 1930s, the natural system was discovered by Dhrubajyoti Ghosh, an ecologist and a municipal engineer in the 1970s while working in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestatesman.com/opinion/wetlands-will-weep-today-1502586927.html|title=The wetlands will weep today|last1=Ghatak|first1=Aditi Roy|date=17 February 2018|accessdate=8 March 2018|publisher=The Statesman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghosh worked for decades to protect the wetlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dhrubajyoti.net/publ/Dr.%20Ghosh_changemaker.pdf|title=The Calcutta Wetlands: turning bad water into good|last1=Ghosh|first1=Dhrubajyoti|website=www.dhrubajyoti.net|publisher=Changemakers (issue October 2008)|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been a practice in [[Kolkata]], one of the five largest cities in [[India]], for the municipal authorities to pump sewage into shallow ponds (''bheris'').&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://dhrubajyoti.net/Final%20Ecosystem%20Book.pdf|title=Ecosystem management – towards merging theory and practice|last1=Ghosh|first1=Dhrubajyoti|date=2 October 2014|publisher=Nimby books|isbn=9788190657044|location=New delhi|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the heat of the tropical sun, algae proliferated in them, converting the sewage into clean water, which in turn was used by villagers to grow paddy and vegetables. This system has been in use in the region since the 1930s and treats 750 million litres of [[wastewater]] per day, giving livelihood to 100,000 people in the vicinity.&lt;ref name="kol"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aseem|first1=Shrivastava|title=The ecologically subsidised city: on Kolkata's wetland communities|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-ecologically-subsidised-city/article22970933.ece|accessdate=8 March 2018|publisher=The Hindu|date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For his work, Ghosh was included in the UN Global 500 Roll of Honour in 1990 and received the [[Luc Hoffmann]] award in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.global500.org/index.php/year/1990?start=100|title=Global 500 environmental forum|website=www.global500.org|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practical implementation ==
{{refimprove|section|date=March 2018}}
There is currently no accepted basis on which a government agency, municipality or private company can systematically assess the efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability of a particular nature-based solution. However, a series of principles are proposed to guide effective and appropriate implementation, and thus to upscale NBS in practice. For example, NBS embrace and are not meant to replace nature conservation norms. Also, NBS are determined by site-specific natural and cultural contexts that include traditional, local and scientific knowledge. NBS are an integral part of the overall design of policies, and measure or actions, to address a specific challenges. Finally, NBS can be implemented alone or in an integrated manner with other solutions to societal challenges (e.g. technological and engineering solutions) and they are applied at the landscape scale.

Implementing NBS requires political, economic, and scientific challenges to be tackled. First and foremost, private sector investment is needed, not to replace but to supplement traditional sources of capital such as public funding or [[philanthropy]]. The challenge is therefore to provide a robust evidence base for the contribution of nature to economic growth and jobs, and to demonstrate the economic viability of these solutions – compared to technological ones – on a timescale compatible with that of global change. Furthermore, it requires measures like adaptation of economic subsidy schemes, and the creation of opportunities for [[conservation finance]], to name a few. Indeed, such measures will be needed to scale up NBS interventions, and strengthen their impact in mitigating the world's most pressing challenges.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Since 2016, the EU is supporting a multi-stakeholder dialogue platform (called ThinkNature) to promote the co-design, testing and deployment of improved and innovative NBS in an integrated way.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Creation of such science-policy-business-society interfaces could promote the market uptake of NBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nikolaidis|first=Nikolaos P.|last2=Kolokotsa|first2=Dionyssia|last3=Banwart|first3=Steven A.|date=2017-03-16|title=Nature-based solutions: business|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7645/full/543315d.html?foxtrotcallback=true|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=543|issue=7645|pages=315–315|doi=10.1038/543315d|issn=0028-0836|bibcode=2017Natur.543..315N}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is part of the EU’s Horizon 2020 – Research and Innovation programme, and will last for 3 years. There are a total of 17 international partners involved, including the Technical University of Crete (Project Leader), the University of Helsinki and BiodivERsA.

In 2017, as part of the Presidency of the [[Estonia|Estonian Republic]] of the [[Council of the European Union]], a conference called “Nature-based Solutions: From Innovation to Common-use” was organized by the Ministry of the Environment of Estonia and the University of Tallinn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nbs2017.eu/|title=Nature-Based Solutions, Tallinn, 24–26 October 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conference aimed to strengthen synergies among various recent initiatives and programs related to NBS launched by the European Commission and by the EU Member States, focusing on policy and governance of NBS, and on research and innovation.

=== Nature-based Solutions in the Paris Agreement ===
In recognition of the importance of natural ecosystems for mitigation and adaptation, the [http://unfccc.int/files/essential_background/convention/application/pdf/english_paris_agreement.pdf Paris Agreement] calls on all Parties to acknowledge “the importance of the conservation and enhancement, as appropriate, of sinks and reservoirs of the greenhouse gases” and to “note the importance of ensuring the integrity of all ecosystems, including oceans, and the protection of biodiversity, recognized by some cultures as Mother Earth”. It then includes in its Articles several references to nature-based solutions. For example, Article 5.2 encourages Parties to adopt “…policy approaches and positive incentives for activities relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and the role of conservation and sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries; and alternative policy approaches, such as joint mitigation and adaptation approaches for the integral and sustainable management of forests, while reaffirming the importance of incentivizing, as appropriate, non-carbon benefits associated with such approaches”. Article 7.1 further encourages Parties to build the resilience of socioeconomic and ecological systems, including through economic diversification and sustainable management of natural resources. In total, the Agreement refers to nature (ecosystems, natural resources, forests) in 13 distinct places. An in-depth analysis &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbspolicyplatform.org/|title=Nature-Based Solutions Policy Platform|website=www.nbspolicyplatform.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; of all Nationally Determined Contributions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unfccc.int/process/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions/ndc-registry|title=Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) {{!}} UNFCCC|website=unfccc.int|language=en|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; submitted to UNFCCC, revealed that around 130 NDCs or 65% of signatories commit to nature-based solutions in their climate pledges, suggesting broad consensus for the role of nature in helping meet climate change goals. However, high-level commitments rarely translate into robust, measurable actions on-the-ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=July 2016|title=Ecosystem-based adaptation: a win–win formula for sustainability in a warming world?|url=http://pubs.iied.org/17364IIED/?k=Ecosystem-based+Adaptation+EbA&amp;p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The term NBS was put forward by practitioners in the late 2000s (in particular the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|International Union for the Conservation of Nature]] and the [[World Bank]]) and thereafter by policymakers in Europe (most notably the [[European Commission]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Faivre|first=Nicolas|last2=Fritz|first2=Marco|last3=Freitas|first3=Tiago|last4=Boissezon|first4=Birgit de|last5=Vandewoestijne|first5=Sofie|title=Nature-Based Solutions in the EU: Innovating with nature to address social, economic and environmental challenges|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2017.08.032|journal=Environmental Research|volume=159|pages=509–518|doi=10.1016/j.envres.2017.08.032|bibcode=2017ER....159..509F}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term "nature-based solutions" was first used in the late 2000s.&lt;ref name="MacKinnon11"&gt;MacKinnon, K., C. Sobrevila, V. Hickey. 2008. Biodiversity, climate change and adaptation: nature-based solutions from the Word Bank portfolio. Washington D.C.: World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mittermeier12"&gt;Mittermeier, R. et al. 2008. A Climate For Life: Meeting the Global Challenge. Arlington, VA: International League of Conservation Photographers.&lt;/ref&gt; It was used in the context of finding new solutions to mitigate and adapt to climate change effects, whilst simultaneously protecting biodiversity and improving sustainable livelihoods. 

The IUCN referred to NBS in a position paper for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature). 2009. No time to lose – make full use of nature-based solutions in the post-2012 climate change regime. Position paper on the Fifteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 15). Gland: IUCN.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was also adopted by European policymakers, in particular by the European Commission in a report&lt;ref name="European Commission 2015"&gt;European Commission. 2015. Towards an EU Research and Innovation policy agenda for nature-based solutions &amp; re-naturing cities. Final Report of the Horizon2020 Expert Group on Nature-Based Solutions and Re-Naturing Cities. Brussels: European Commission.&lt;/ref&gt; stressing that NBS can offer innovative means to create jobs and growth as part of a green economy. The term started to make appearances in the mainstream media around the time of the Global Climate Action Summit in California in September 2018 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nathalieseddon.blogspot.com/2018/09/global-climate-action-summit-kicks-off.html|title=Global Climate Action Summit kicks off today in San Francisco with nature-based solutions high on the agenda|website=Global Climate Action Summit kicks off today in San Francisco with nature-based solutions high on the agenda|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Villa Cassel.jpg|thumb|The nature centre of [[Pro Natura (Switzerland)|Pro Natura]] near the [[Aletsch Glacier]] ([[Swiss Alps]]).]]

A '''nature center''' (or '''nature centre''') is an organization with a [[visitor center]] or [[interpretive center]] designed to educate people about nature and the environment. Usually located within a protected [[Open space reserve|open space]], nature centers often have trails through their property.  Some are located within a state or city [[park]], and some have special [[garden]]s or an [[arboretum]].  Their properties can be characterized as nature preserves and wildlife sanctuaries.  Nature centers generally display small live animals, such as [[reptile]]s, [[rodent]]s, [[insect]]s, or [[fish]].  There are often museum exhibits and displays about [[natural history]], or preserved mounted animals or nature [[dioramas]].   Nature centers are staffed by paid or volunteer [[naturalists]] and most offer educational programs to the general public, as well as summer camp, after-school and school group programs.

Some nature centers allow free admission but collect voluntary donations in order to help offset expenses.  They usually rely on support from dedicated [[volunteering|volunteers]].

[[Environmental education]] centers differ from nature centers in that their museum exhibits and education programs are available mostly by appointment, although casual visitors may be allowed to walk on their grounds.

Some city, state and national parks have facilities similar to nature centers, such as museum exhibits, [[dioramas]] and trails, and some offer park nature education programs, usually presented by a [[park ranger]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1370">'''Naturhistorieselskabet''' - the Society for Natural History - was a private society that was the only institution to offer education in [[natural history]] in [[Denmark]] in the late 18th century. The spirit of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and an escalating [[agriculture|agricultural]] crisis, led the [[List of Danish monarchs|king]] and the [[Denmark|Danish]] elite to call foreign experts on [[economy]], including [[botany]] and [[silviculture]], to the country. The autonomous [[University of Copenhagen]], on the other hand, was reluctant to employ foreign experts in little-established disciplines. Naturhistorieselskabet was formed in 1788 in order to ensure education in [[botany]], [[zoology]] and [[mineralogy]] based on private funds. For example, [[Martin Vahl]] lectured in [[botany]]. After the appointment in 1795 of a professor in [[geology]] and in 1797 one in [[botany]], the society gradually lost its importance. It was soon abolished and its collections donated to the state (much later united with the university collections).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2871">'''Political naturalism''' is a minor [[political ideology]] and [[legal system]] which believes that there is a [[natural law]], just and obvious to all, that crosses ideologies, faiths and personal thinking, that naturally guaranties justice. It is inspired by [[sociological naturalism]], and [[methodological naturalism|scientific naturalism]]'s belief that the precision of [[natural sciences]] can be applied to social sciences, and hence to practical social activities like politics and law.

It may be seen as a natural law-based version of [[Liberal legalism|legalism]]/[[constitutionalism]] (especially [[Constitutionalism#Prescriptive use|of prescriptive constitutionalism]], in the way it tries, idealistically, to make a constitution how it should justly be), and it bears relation with many [[constitutional monarchies]] (as in that system they too believe in [[rule of the law]] and in certain things who are naturally correct (like [[monarchy]], monarchic [[institutions]] and [[traditions]].

The roots of this legal political ideology may be found in positive visions of natural law (like [[John Locke]]'s and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]'s, and even in the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[[s:United States Declaration of Independence|United States Declaration of Independence]], 1776, "We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catholic]] [[Germany|German]] [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] politician and diplomat Karl Friedrich von Savigny also thought so.&lt;ref&gt;He stated that "laws are not made ''but found''", implying the existence of already existing natural laws.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its main modern thinker is [[Egypt]]ian legal scholar and creator of the [[Egyptian Civil Code]] [[Abd El-Razzak El-Sanhuri|Al-Razzak Al-Sanhuri]].&lt;ref&gt;Abd Al-Razzak Al-Sanhuri, Egyptian Civil Code, Article 1, 1949, ''«in the absence of any applicable legislation, the judge shall decide according to the custom and failing the custom, according to the principles of Islamic Law. In the absence of these principles,'' '''the judge shall have recourse to natural law''' ''and the rules of equity.»''&lt;/ref&gt; Through the Egyptian Code, many other Arab constitutions (in monarchist and pre-dictatorships [[Iraq]] and [[Libya]] and modern [[Qatar]]) ended up including political naturalist laws, and Al-Sanhuri himself wrote the [[Syrian]] and [[Jordan]]ian [[civil codes]] and the [[Kuwait]]i [[commercial code (law)|commercial code]].

'''Primary energy''' ('''PE''') is an [[energy]] form found in nature that has not been subjected to any [[energy engineering|human engineered]] conversion process. It is energy contained in raw [[fuel|fuels]], and other forms of energy received as input to a [[system]]. Primary energy can be [[non-renewable resource|non-renewable]] or [[renewable energy|renewable]].

Where primary energy is used to describe fossil fuels, the [[embodied energy]] of the fuel is available as thermal energy and around 70% is typically lost in conversion to electrical or mechanical energy. There is a similar 60-80% conversion loss when solar and wind energy is converted to electricity, but today's UN conventions on energy statistics counts the electricity made from wind and solar as the primary energy itself for these sources. One consequence of this counting method is that the contribution of wind and solar energy is under reported compared to fossil energy sources, and there is hence an international debate on how to count primary energy from wind and solar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sauar|first1=Erik|title=IEA underreports contribution solar and wind by a factor of three compared to fossil fuels|url=http://energypost.eu/iea-underreports-contribution-solar-wind-factor-three-compared-fossil-fuels/|website=energypost.eu|publisher=Energy Post|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Total primary energy supply''' ('''TPES''') is the sum of production and imports subtracting exports and storage changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/factbook-2013-en/06/01/01/index.html?contentType=&amp;itemId=%2fcontent%2fchapter%2ffactbook-2013-41-en&amp;mimeType=text%2fhtml&amp;containerItemId=%2fcontent%2fserial%2f18147364&amp;accessItemIds=|title=OECD Factbook 2013: Economic, Environmental and Social Statistics|year=2013|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of primary energy is used in [[energy distance|energy statistics]] in the compilation of [[energy accounting|energy balances]], as well as in the field of [[energetics]]. In energetics, a primary energy source (PES) refers to the energy forms required by the energy sector to generate the supply of [[energy carrier|energy carriers]] used by human society.&lt;ref name="GIAMPIETROMAYUMI2009"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Giampietro |first1=Mario |last2=Mayumi |first2=Kozo |title=The Biofuel Delusion: The Fallacy of Large Scale Agro-Biofuels Production |publisher=Earthscan, Taylor &amp; Francis group |year=2009 |pages=336 |isbn=978-1-84407-681-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Secondary energy''' is a carrier of energy, such as electricity. These are produced by conversion from a primary energy source.

The use of primary energy as a measure ignores conversion efficiency. Thus forms of energy with poor conversion efficiency, particularly the thermal sources, coal, gas and nuclear are overstated, whereas energy sources such as hydroelectricity which are converted efficiently, while a small fraction of primary energy are significantly more important than their total raw energy supply may seem to imply.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

PE and TPES are better defined in the context of [[worldwide energy supply]].

==Examples of sources==
Primary energy sources should not be confused with the [[energy system]] components (or conversion processes) through which they are converted into energy carriers.

In certain situations, the use of resources by human society is performed at a much higher rate than the minimum rate at which it can be geophysically renewed.

==Usable energy==
{{main|exergy}}
[[File:Different energy forms (PES).png|thumb|Primary energy sources are transformed by the energy sector to generate energy carriers.]]
Primary energy sources are transformed in [[energy conversion]] processes to more convenient forms of energy that can directly be used by society, such as [[electrical energy]], refined [[fuels]], or synthetic fuels such as [[hydrogen fuel]]. In the field of [[energetics]], these forms are called [[energy carrier]]s and correspond to the concept of "secondary energy" in energy statistics.

===Conversion to energy carriers (or secondary energy)===
Energy carriers are energy forms which have been transformed from primary energy sources. Electricity is one of the most common energy carriers, being transformed from various primary energy sources such as coal, oil, natural gas, and wind. Electricity is particularly useful since it has low entropy (is highly ordered) and so can be converted into other forms of energy very efficiently. [[District heating]] is another example of secondary energy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/facility-owners-and-managers/existing-buildings/use-portfolio-manager/understand-metrics/difference   U.S. EPA Energy STAR] Retrieved 2017-11-03&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[laws of thermodynamics]], primary energy sources cannot be produced. They must be available to society to enable the production of energy carriers.&lt;ref name="GIAMPIETROMAYUMI2009" /&gt;

[[Thermal efficiency|Conversion efficiency]] varies. For thermal energy, electricity and mechanical energy production is limited by [[Carnot's theorem]], and generates a lot of [[waste heat]]. Other non-thermal conversions can be more efficient. For example, while wind turbines do not capture all of the wind's energy, they have a high conversion efficiency and generate very little waste heat since wind energy is low entropy. In principle solar photovoltaic conversions could be very efficient, but current conversion can only be done well for narrow ranges of wavelength, whereas solar thermal is also subject to Carnot efficiency limits. Hydroelectric power is also very ordered, and converted very efficiently. The amount of usable energy is the [[exergy]] of a system.

===Site and source energy===
Site energy is the term used in North America for the amount of end-use energy of all forms consumed at a specified location. This can be a mix of primary energy (such as natural gas burned at the site) and secondary energy (such as electricity). Site energy is measured at the campus, building, or sub-building level and is the basis for energy charges on utility bills.&lt;ref name="NRCan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Measuring energy: site energy vs. source energy in ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager|url=http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/efficiency/buildings/energy-benchmarking/update/getready/19453|publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]]|accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Source energy, in contrast, is the term used in North America for the amount of primary energy consumed in order to provide a facility’s site energy. It is always greater than the site energy, as it includes all site energy and adds to it the energy lost during transmission, delivery, and conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torcellini|first=Paul|last2=Pless|first2=Shanti|last3=Deru|first3=Michael|last4=Crawley|first4=Drury|date=June 2006|title=Zero energy buildings: a critical look at the definition|url=https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy06osti/39833.pdf|journal=ACEEE Summer Study|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory/U.S. Department of Energy|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While source or primary energy provides a more complete picture of energy consumption, it cannot be measured directly and must be calculated using conversion factors from site energy measurements.&lt;ref name="NRCan" /&gt; For electricity, a typical value is three units of source energy for one unit of site energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Site Energy vs Source Energy|url=http://wbi.worldbank.org/energy/content/site-energy-vs-source-energy|publisher=The World Bank|accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this can vary considerably depending on factors such as the primary energy source or fuel type, the type of power plant, and the transmission infrastructure. One full set of conversion factors is available as technical reference from [[Energy Star|Energy STAR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://portfoliomanager.energystar.gov/pdf/reference/Source%20Energy.pdf|title=Technical Reference: Source Energy|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Either site or source energy can be an appropriate metric when comparing or analyzing energy use of different facilities. The U.S [[Energy Information Administration]], for example, uses primary (source) energy for its energy overviews&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/|title=Total Energy - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|website=www.eia.gov|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; but site energy for its Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/terminology.php|title=Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|website=www.eia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Residential Building Energy Consumption Survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/terminology.php|title=Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|website=www.eia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]'s [[Energy Star|Energy STAR]] program recommends using source energy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/facility-owners-and-managers/existing-buildings/use-portfolio-manager/understand-metrics/difference|title=The difference between source and site energy|website=www.energystar.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States Department of Energy|US Department of Energy]] uses site energy in its definition of a [[Zero-energy building|zero net energy building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://energy.gov/eere/buildings/articles/doe-releases-common-definition-zero-energy-buildings-campuses-and|title=DOE Releases Common Definition for Zero Energy Buildings, Campuses, and Communities|website=Energy.gov|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Energy accidents}}

Energy accidents are accidents that occur in systems that provide energy or power. These can result in fatalities, as can the normal running of many systems, for example those deaths due to pollution.

Globally, coal is responsible for 100,000 deaths per trillion kWh.&lt;ref name=deadly&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-deathprint-a-price-always-paid/#2f9f079649d2 How Deadly Is Your Kilowatt? We Rank The Killer Energy Sources James Conca, June 10, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5455">The '''Ramsauer–Townsend effect''', also sometimes called the '''Ramsauer effect''' or the '''Townsend effect''', is a physical phenomenon involving the [[scattering]] of low-energy [[electron]]s by [[atom]]s of a [[noble gas]]. Since its explanation requires the [[Wave–particle duality|wave theory]] of [[quantum mechanics]], it demonstrates the need for physical theories more sophisticated than those of [[classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]].

== Definitions ==
When an electron moves through a gas, its interactions with the gas atoms cause scattering to occur. These interactions are classified as ''[[Elasticity (physics)|inelastic]]'' if they cause [[excited state|excitation]] or [[ion]]ization of the atom to occur and ''elastic'' if they do not.

The ''probability of scattering'' in such a system is defined as the number of electrons scattered, per unit electron current, per unit path length, per unit pressure at 0&amp;nbsp;°C, per unit [[solid angle]]. The ''number of collisions'' equals the total number of electrons scattered elastically and inelastically in all angles, and the ''probability of collision'' is the total number of collisions, per unit electron current, per unit path length, per unit pressure at 0&amp;nbsp;°C.

Because noble gas atoms have a relatively high [[Ionization energy|first ionization energy]] and the electrons do not carry enough energy to cause excited electronic states, ionization and excitation of the atom are unlikely, and the probability of elastic scattering over all angles is approximately equal to the probability of collision.

== Description ==
The effect is named for [[Carl Ramsauer]] (1879-1955) and [[John Sealy Townsend]] (1868-1957), who each independently studied the collisions between atoms and low-energy electrons in the early 1920s.

If one tries to predict the probability of collision with a classical model that treats the electron and atom as hard spheres, one finds that the probability of collision should be independent of the incident electron energy (see Kukolich). However, Ramsauer and Townsend observed that for slow-moving electrons in argon, krypton, or xenon, the probability of collision between the electrons and gas atoms obtains a minimum value for electrons with a certain amount of kinetic energy (about 1 electron volts for xenon gas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ramsauer-Townsend effect|url=http://www.hep.wisc.edu/~prepost/407/ramsauer/ramsauer.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This is the Ramsauer–Townsend effect.

No good explanation for the phenomenon existed until the introduction of quantum mechanics, which explains that the effect results from the wave-like properties of the electron. A simple model of the collision that makes use of wave theory can predict the existence of the Ramsauer-Townsend minimum. Bohm presents one such model that considers the atom as a finite square [[potential well]].

Predicting from theory the kinetic energy that will produce a Ramsauer-Townsend minimum is quite complicated since the problem involves understanding the wave nature of particles. However, the problem has been extensively investigated both experimentally and theoretically and is well understood (see Johnson and Guet).

In 1970 Gryzinski has proposed classical explanation of Ramsauer effect&lt;ref name=Gryz&gt;[http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.24.45 M. Gryziński, ''Ramsauer Effect as a Result of the Dynamic Structure of the Atomic Shell''], Phys. Rev. Lett., 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; using effective picture of atom as oscillating multipole of electric field (dipole, quadrupole, octupole), which was a consequence of his [[free-fall atomic model]].

'''Revolving rivers''' are a surprising, uncommon way of [[sand]] pile growth that can be found in a few sands around the world, but has been studied in detail only for one [[Cuba]]n sand from a place called Santa Teresa ([[Pinar del Rio]] province).

==Description==

When pouring "revolving" sand on a flat surface from a fixed position, the growth of a conical pile does not occur by the common [[avalanche]] mechanism, where sand slides down the pile in a more or less random fashion. What happens in that a relatively thin "river" of flowing sand travels from the pouring point at the apex of the pile to its base, while the rest of the sand at the surface is static. In addition, the river "revolves" around the pile either in clockwise or counter-clockwise directions (looking from top) depending on the initial conditions of the experiment. Actually the river constitutes the "cutting edge" of a layer of sand that deposits as a helix on the conical pile, and makes it grow.
For small sandpiles, rivers are continuous, but they become intermittent
for larger piles.

== History and state of the art ==

The phenomenon was observed first by E. Altshuler at the [[University of Havana]] in 1995, but at the time he assumed that it was well known, and temporarily forgot about it. In 2000, being at the [[University of Houston]], he told K. E. Bassler, who showed a vivid interest in the matter. Embarrassingly enough, Altshuler was unable to demonstrate it before Bassler using a random sand from Houston, so he had to send him a video from [[Cuba]] after his return to the island.

Once the existence of the strange phenomenon was confirmed for everyone, E. Altshuler and a number of collaborators performed a systematic study in [[Havana]], which was then jointly published with Bassler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Altshuler E.|display-authors=etal|title=
Sandpile formation by revolving rivers|journal=Physical Review Letters| date=2003 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.91.014501|pmid=12906542|bibcode=2003PhRvL..91a4501A|volume=91|issue=1|pages=014501|arxiv=cond-mat/0206493}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Further work has been done to understand in more detail the
phenomenon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Altshuler E.|display-authors=etal|title=
Revolving rivers in sandpiles: from continuous to intermittent flows|journal=Physical Review E|date=2008 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.77.031305|volume=77|issue=3 Pt 1|pmid=18517368|page=031305|arxiv=0711.0920|bibcode=2008PhRvE..77c1305A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kong, X.-Z.|display-authors=etal|title=Kinetic energy sandpile model for conical sandpile development by revolving rivers
|journal=Physics Letters A|date=2006 |
url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037596010501337X|doi=10.1016/j.physleta.2005.08.068|volume=348|issue=3–6|pages=77–81|bibcode=2006PhLA..348...77K}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been found in other sands from different parts of the world. 
However, the connection between the physical, chemical (and possibly biological) properties of the grains in a specific sand, the nature of the inter-grain interactions, and the emergence of the revolving rivers is still an open question.

Sand from Santa Teresa is made of almost pure [[silicon dioxide]] grains with an average [[grain size]] of 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm approximately and no visible special features regarding grain shape. But in spite of its apparent simplicity, many puzzles still remain. For example, after many experiments one batch of sand may stop showing revolving rivers (just as [[singing sand]] eventually stops singing), which suggests that the decay is connected to certain properties of the surface of the grains that degrade by continued friction.

Videos of the effect are available on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=YouTubeRiosEng| author=Complexperiments |date=2010 |

Innovations conventionally associated with terrestrially first appeared in aquatic [[elpistostegalians]] such as ''[[Panderichthys]] rhombolepis'', ''[[Elpistostege]] watsoni'', and ''[[Tiktaalik roseae]]''. Phylogenetic analyses distribute the features that developed along the tetrapod stem and display a stepwise process of character acquisition, rather than abrupt.&lt;ref name=downs2008&gt;Downs, J.

By the [[Upper Devonian]] period, the fin-limb transition as well as other skeletal changes such as gill arch reduction, opercular series loss, mid-line fin loss, and scale reduction were already completed in many aquatic organisms.&lt;ref name=coates&gt;Coates, M.I., Jeffery, J.E., &amp; Ruta, M.

Some adaptations required to adjust to non-aquatic life include the movement and use of alternating limbs, the use of pelvic appendages as sturdy propulsors, and the use of a solid surface at the organism’s base to generate propulsive force required for walking.&lt;ref name=king&gt;King, H.M., Shubin, N.H., Coates, M.I., &amp; Hale, M.E.

=== Head changes in [[Osteichthyes]] ===

[[File:Osteolepis BW.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Restoration of ''Osteolepis'']] 

The [[Osteolepiformes]] and Elpistostegalia are two crown groups of rhipidistians with respect to the tetrapods.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of skull roof and cheekbone patterns in these organisms match those found in the first tetrapods. Palatal and nasal skeletal features like choanae are present in these groups and are also observed in modern amphibians. This indicates that incipient air breathing was developed, as well as modification of the hyoid arch towards stapes development.&lt;ref name=clack2002&gt;Clack, J. A. (2002). A revised reconstruction of the dermal skull roof of Acanthostega gunnari, an early tetrapod from the Late Devonian. Earth and Environmental Science Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 93(02), 163-165.&lt;/ref&gt; These characteristics account for why osteichthyans are accepted as the sister group of tetrapods.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt;

The elpistostegalid fish are considered the most apomorphic of fish in comparison to tetrapods.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt;  From well-preserved fossils, it is observed that they share a paltybasic skull with eye ridges, and external nares situated on the margin of the mouth.&lt;ref name=downs2008&gt;Downs, J. P., Daeschler, E. B., Jenkins, F. A., &amp; Shubin, N. H. (2008). The cranial endoskeleton of Tiktaalik roseae. Nature, 455(7215), 925-929.&lt;/ref&gt; Development of eye ridges and flatting of the skull are also observed in primitive fossil amphibians and reptiles. The most likely reason for the traits to be adaptive was for their use in aerial vision above the waterline.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt; The traits enabled animals to check area on land for safe spots if being chased by a predator in water, as well as being useful for searching for prey items above the water. The water-based [[lateral line system]] was used substantially by these aquatic tetrapods to detect danger from predators.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Osteichthyan diversification, there were no changes related to respiration in the transition as can be seen by the nasal region and palatal morphology in elpistostegalid fishes. The primary change from basic ostelepiform ancestors to the first elpistostegalid in the middle Devonian was to the pre-existing roof skulls.&lt;ref&gt;LONG, J. A. (1990).

=== Head changes in prototetrapod ===

[[File:Elginerpeton BW.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Restoration of ''Elginerpeton'']]

In ''[[Elginerpeton pancheni]]'', a prototetrapod from the late [[Frasnian]], basic tetrapod characteristics in the lower jaw and the cranium are observed. The taxon is believed to fill the gap between elpistostegalid fishes and well-preserved Devonian tetrapods. The ''Elginerpeton'' is considered more derived than the elpistostegalid fishes due to presence of paired fangs on the parasymphysial toothplate, a slender shaped anterior coronoid, and in the loss of the intracranial joint and coronoid fossa.&lt;ref name=Ahlberg1998&gt;Ahlberg, P. E., &amp; Clack, J. A. (1998). Lower jaws, lower tetrapods–a review based on the Devonian genus Acanthostega. Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh: Earth Sciences, 89(01), 11-46.&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of the intercranial joint was a direct functional necessity to strengthen the broad and long platybasic skull when the animal was out of the water.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt;  The tubular lower jaw of the ''Elginerpeton'', compared to the flat-lamina jaw shape of fishes gave it superior cross-sectional force, required when not supported in an aquatic setting – allowing for opening of the mouth outside of water. The adaptation may also be interpreted as a specialization for buccopharyngeal breathing. It is speculated to be the first step towards aerial respiration in the transition from fish to tetrapod.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004).

=== Head changes in aquatic tetrapods ===
[[File:Acanthostega BW.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Restoration of ''Acanthostega'']] 
In the tetrapod and higher clades from the lower-middle [[Famennian]] there are several defining changes on the basis of anatomy of ''[[Ichthyostega]]'', ''[[Tulerpeton]]'', and ''[[Acanthostega]]''. In the cranium, there is a stapes derived from the hyomandibular of fishes; a single bilateral pair of nasal bones, and a fenestra ovalis in the otic capsule of the braincase.&lt;ref&gt;Lebedev, O. A., &amp; Coates, M. I. (1995). The postcranial skeleton of the Devonian tetrapod Tulerpeton curtum Lebedev. Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 114(3), 307-348.&lt;/ref&gt;  The opening of the otic wall of the braincase can be considered a paedomorphic feature for tetrapods and is linked to the stapes functionally.&lt;ref name=Clack1994&gt;Clack, J. A. (1994). Earliest known tetrapod braincase and the evolution of the stapes and fenestra ovalis.&lt;/ref&gt; The stapes was thought to be just a structural support between the palate and the stapedial plate of the braincase.&lt;ref name=Clack1994&gt;Clack, J. A. (1994). Earliest known tetrapod braincase and the evolution of the stapes and fenestra ovalis.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Acanthostega'', it is likely that due to the otic capsule of the brain case being mesial to the stapedial plate, sound was picked up from the palate or the otic notch to allow for rudimentary hearing. It was able to perceive vibrations by opening its mouth by way of the palate. Other factors that caused aquatic tetrapods to spend more time on land caused the development of terrestrial hearing with the development of a tympanum within an otic notch and developed by convergent evolution at least three times.&lt;ref&gt;Laurin, M.

In Annales des Sciences Naturelles-Zoologie et Biologie Animale (Vol. 19, No. 1, pp. 1-42). Elsevier Masson.&lt;/ref&gt;
There was also a change in the dermal bones of the skull in the aquatic tetrapods.&lt;ref name=clack2002&gt;Clack, J. A. (2002). A revised reconstruction of the dermal skull roof of Acanthostega gunnari, an early tetrapod from the Late Devonian.

The feature allows for a stronger bite as well as increasing the strength of the skull.&lt;ref name=clack2002&gt;Clack, J. A. (2002).

=== Teeth and feeding mechanisms ===

Feeding on land is a completely different task than feeding in water. Water is much more dense and viscous compared to air, causing hunting techniques adapted in water to be less successful when applied on land.&lt;ref name=Lauder&gt;Lauder, G. V. (1985). Aquatic feeding in lower vertebrates. Functional vertebrate morphology, 210-229.&lt;/ref&gt; The main technique used in water is suction feeding and is used by most aquatic vertebrates.

In ''Acanthostega'', which is more derived, the large teeth are absent. In ''Eusthenopetron'' and ''Panderichthys'', an ossified operculum is exhibited unlike in the ''Tiktaalik'', ''Ventastega'', and ''Acanthostega''. These differences as well as reductions of the gill chamber and changes in the nature of the lower jaw are hypothesized to indicate a reduced reliance on suction feeding in early tetrapods in comparison to osteolepiform fish.&lt;ref name=Ahlberg1998&gt;Ahlberg, P.

Journal of Experimental Biology, 209(11), 2085–2102.&lt;/ref&gt; The main cause of sutural deformation is caused by strain during feeding activity, most prominent with feeding mechanisms involving sucking a prey into the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;Markey, M. J., Main, R. P., &amp; Marshall, C. R. (2006). In vivo cranial suture function and suture morphology in the extant fish ''[[Polypterus]]'': implications for inferring skull function in living and fossil fish. Journal of Experimental Biology, 209(11), 2085–2102.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a tension anteriorly, and compression posteriorly strain patterns are observed in ''Polypterus'', a prey-sucking predator. In terrestrial tetrapod ''[[Phonerpeton]]'', there is compression between the frontals and parietals and a complex loading between the post parietals. There is no evidence of tensile strain in any sutures. ''Acanthostega'' fossil records demonstrate that no strain pattern was exhibited that relate to prey capture by means of suction. The load compression is similar to extant tetrapods. It is most likely that the organism captured prey by biting in the water or near the edge of the water. This finding indicates that the terrestrial mode of feeding first emerged in an aquatic environment.&lt;ref name= Markey2007&gt;Markey, M. J., &amp; Marshall, C. R. (2007). Terrestrial-style feeding in a very early aquatic tetrapod is supported by evidence from experimental analysis of suture morphology. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 104(17), 7134-7138.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neck ==
The cranial endoskeleton of ''T. roseae'' shares derived features with tetrapods. There was a loss of opercular and extrascapular elements, enhancing head mobility in ''T. roseae'' compared to other tetrapodomorph fish.&lt;ref name=downs2008&gt;Downs, J. P., Daeschler, E. B., Jenkins, F. A., &amp; Shubin, N. H. (2008). The cranial endoskeleton of Tiktaalik roseae. Nature, 455(7215), 925-929.&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of the neck allowed for locomotion in shallow waters. This environment allows for less motility compared to the three-dimensional space that fish are able to orient themselves in. The body of the organism in these environments would be fixed in the shallow pools with appendages planted on a substrate.&lt;ref name=downs2008&gt;Downs, J. P., Daeschler, E. B., Jenkins, F. A., &amp; Shubin, N. H. (2008). The cranial endoskeleton of Tiktaalik roseae. Nature, 455(7215), 925-929.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Acanthostega'' and ''Ichthyostega'', which are considered to be more derived than other basal aquatic tetrapods, the pectoral girdle is decoupled from the skull. There is also a loss of the dorsal pectoral girdle bones, which permits a large degree of movement for the shoulder. This allowed for a greater degree of movement, and is a necessity for improving aquatic maneuveurs and terrestrial locomotion.&lt;ref&gt;Johanson, Z., Ahlberg, P., &amp; Ritchie, A. (2003). The braincase and palate of the tetrapodomorph sarcopterygian Mandageria fairfaxi: morphological variability near the fish–tetrapod transition. Palaeontology, 46(2), 271-293.&lt;/ref&gt; This could have been driven by the need to lift the head to aid aerial respiration by using nostrils and choanae.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limbs ==

Limbs in vertebrates are occasionally organized into stylopod (relating to the humerus and femur), zeugopod (relating to the radius and tibia, along with associated structures) and autopod (relating to digits) categories, although anatomically, the evolutionary differences between these groups in early tetrapods tends to be vague.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gilbert&gt;Gilbert, S.F. (2000). Development of the tetrapod limb. Developmental Biology 6. Retrieved from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9975/&lt;/ref&gt;
	
The transition from fins to limbs occurred once an endoskeleton entered the base of the fin, as seen in today's lungfish.&lt;ref name=hinch&gt;Hinchliffe, R.J. (1994). Evolutionary developmental biology of the tetrapod limb. Developmental 1994 Supplement, 163-168.&lt;/ref&gt; This is thought to have originated in the group [[Sarcopterygians]], including osteolipiforms like ''Eusthenopteron'', due to the homology of the tetrapod forelimb and the osteolepiform fin endoskeleton.&lt;ref name=hinch /&gt;

''Acanthostega'' is a partially aquatic tetrapod with developed limbs that shares features common with the earlier tetrapods, ''Panderichthys'' and ''Eusthenopteron''.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; Like ''Panderichthys'',  the humerus of ''Acanthostega'' is flattened dorso-ventrally, the intermedium terminates level with the radius, and the endoskeleton can be divided into stylopodium, zeugopodium and autopodium segments.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; Similar to ''Eusthenopteron'', the radials do not articulate with the radius on the distal end.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt;  ''Acanthostega'' also has a 1:2 ratio of humerus to radius and ulna, a feature seen in all tetrapods higher than ''Acanthostega'' on the phylogeny.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt;

Unlike ''Panderichthys'', ''Acanthostega'' hind limbs are at least the size of its fore limbs, if not larger.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; This development of larger limbs is required to physically support the organism during emergence from an aquatic setting to land. The humerus and femur of ''Acanthostega'' also contain evidence of greater development of the appendicular muscles compared to more aquatic tetrapods, hinting at the presence of digits.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt;

Similarly, ''Ossinodus'' has two hindlimbs located bilaterally and proximodistally aymmetrical.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the presence of a small femur during juvenile development, this Carboniferous- period tetrapod is thought to be aquatic during juvenile development; only emerging onto land once it reaches adulthood.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ossinodus'' also has a broad, flat tibia, akin to ''Acanthostega'', and is thought to be only partially terrestrial.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pelvis ==
The development of the pelvic region was crucial for the adaptation from water to land, yet some features of tetrapod locomotion are thought to have arose before the origin of digited limbs or the transition from water to land.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; The fossil record of early tetrapods shows evidence of distinct pelvic development occurring in osteolepiforms, further supporting osteolepiform ancestry of terrestrial tetrapods.&lt;ref name=king /&gt;

''Acanthostega'' has a large pelvis, with the iliac region articulating with the axial skeleton and a broad ischial plate.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; It has a sacrum; a fundamental skeletal feature that allows the organism to transfer force produced in its hindlimbs to its axial skeleton, and move in a terrestrial environment.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; A pubo-ischiadic symphysis is also observed, uniting the two pelvic halves.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt;

In contrast, ''[[Protopterus]] annectens'' (a member of lungfish, thought to be a sister group to tetrapods) has a small, anatomically simpler pelvis, a derived limb endoskeleton and a lack of digits.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; Yet, it shares the ability to lift itself using a solid surface as a base with its pelvic region with ''Acanthostega'' and is also observed to move with tetrapod-like locomotion in an aquatic environment.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; This illustrates that a fundamental innovation in tetrapods is also found in a lower, sister taxon, in which members lack a sacrum.&lt;ref name=king /&gt;

== Digits and Limb Joints ==

''Acanthostega'' is the earliest example of a digitized tetrapod.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; The humerus and femur of ''Acanthostega'' contain evidence of greater development of the appendicular muscles compared to more aquatic tetrapods.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; ''Acanthostega'' has a total lack of dermal fin rays and displays the presence of two or more spool-shaped bones or cartilages articulating individually in antero-posterial sets on the distal end of its limbs.&lt;ref name=coates /&gt; This feature can now be distinguished as digits instead of the endoskeletal radials seen in earlier tetrapods.

''[[Pederpes]]'', a tetrapod from the Early Carboniferous period, also has hindlimbs containing 5 digits that are rotated to face anteriorly.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike previous tetrapods, who have been only partially adapted to land, ''Pederpes'' has the novel ability to bend its limbs and propel itself forwards in a terrestrial setting. This is attributed to the symmetry of the digits and limbs in ''Pederpes'', allowing it to rotate its hindlimbs to an anteriorly facing position and propel itself from the edge of the foot when moving forward.&lt;ref name=Long2004&gt;Long, J. A., &amp; Gordon, M. S. (2004). The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition*. Physiological and Biochemical Zoology, 77(5), 700-719.&lt;/ref&gt; This morphological development of bendable wrists and ankles can distinguish ''Pederpes'' the first true terrestrial tetrapod.

'''Straw''' is an agricultural [[byproduct]] consisting of the dry [[wikt:stalk|stalk]]s of [[cereal]] plants after the [[grain]] and [[chaff]] have been removed. It makes up about half of the yield{{Clarify|reason=money? weight?|date=September 2018}} of cereal crops such as [[barley]], [[oat]]s, [[rice]], [[rye]] and [[wheat]].  It has a number of different uses, including [[fuel]], [[livestock bedding]] and [[fodder]], [[thatching]] and [[basket making]].

Straw is usually gathered and stored in a '''straw bale''', which is a [[wikt:bale|bale]], or bundle, of straw tightly bound with twine or wire. Straw bales may be square, rectangular, or round, and can be very large, depending on the type of [[baler]] used.

== Uses==

Current and historic uses of straw include:

* [[Fodder|Animal feed]]
**Straw may be fed as part of the [[roughage]] component of the diet to cattle or horses that are on a near maintenance level of energy requirement. It has a low digestible energy and nutrient content (as opposed to [[hay]], which is much more nutritious). The heat generated when microorganisms in a herbivore's gut digest straw can be useful in maintaining body temperature in cold climates. Due to the risk of [[impaction (animals)|impaction]] and its poor nutrient profile, it should always be restricted to part of the diet.  It may be fed as it is, or chopped into short lengths, known as [[chaff]].
* [[Basketry]]
** [[Bee skep]]s and linen baskets are made from coiled and bound together continuous lengths of straw. The technique is known as lip work.
* Bedding: humans or [[livestock]]
**The straw-filled mattress, also known as a [[palliasse]], is still used in many parts of the world.
**It is commonly used as bedding for ruminants and horses. It may be used as bedding and food for small animals, but this often leads to injuries to mouth, nose and eyes as straw is quite sharp.
* [[Biofuel]]s
**The use of straw as a carbon-neutral energy source is increasing rapidly, especially for [[biobutanol]]. Straw or hay briquettes are a biofuel substitute to coal.
* [[Biogas]]
**Straw, processed first as [[briquette]]s, has been fed into a biogas plant in Aarhus University, Denmark, in a test to see if higher [[gas]] yields could be attained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dca.au.dk/en/current-news/news/show/artikel/vejen-fra-toert-halm-til-brugbar-energi-forkortes-markant/|title=show|last=252507@au.dk|date=2017-06-30|website=dca.au.dk|language=en|access-date=2017-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Biomass]]
**The use of straw in large-scale biomass power plants is becoming mainstream in the EU, with several facilities already online. The straw is either used directly in the form of bales, or densified into pellets which allows for the feedstock to be transported over longer distances. Finally, [[torrefaction]] of straw with pelletisation is gaining attention, because it increases the energy density of the resource, making it possible to transport it still further. This processing step also makes storage much easier, because torrefied straw pellets are hydrophobic. Torrefied straw in the form of pellets can be directly co-fired with coal or natural gas at very high rates and make use of the processing infrastructures at existing coal and gas plants. Because the torrefied straw pellets have superior structural, chemical and combustion properties to coal, they can replace all coal and turn a coal plant into an entirely biomass-fed power station. First generation pellets are limited to a [[co-firing]] rate of 15% in modern [[Integrated gasification combined cycle|IGCC]] plants.
*Construction material: 
**In many parts of the world, straw is used to bind clay and [[concrete]]. A mixture of clay and straw, known as [[cob (building)|cob]], can be used as a building material.  There are many recipes for making cob.
**When [[Baler|baled]], straw has moderate insulation characteristics (about R-1.5/inch according to Oak Ridge National Lab and Forest Product Lab testing).  It can be used, alone or in a post-and-beam construction, to build [[straw-bale construction|straw bale houses]]. When bales are used to [[Building construction|build]] or [[Thermal insulation|insulate]] buildings, the straw bales are commonly finished with [[earthen plaster]]. The plastered walls provide some [[thermal mass]], compressive and ductile structural strength, and acceptable fire resistance as well as thermal resistance (insulation), somewhat in excess of North American [[building code]]. Straw is an abundant agricultural waste product, and requires little energy to bale and transport for construction. For these reasons, straw bale construction is gaining popularity as part of [[passive solar]] and other [[renewable energy]] projects.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.earthhealing.info/strawbale.pdf The Straw Bale House: Suitability for the Eastern U.S.]&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Composite lumber]]: Wheat straw can be used as a fibrous filler combined with polymers to produce composite lumber.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/1367/adding-value-to-wheat-straw/ Adding Value to Wheat Straw By Anduin Kirkbride-McElroy.  Biomass Magazine, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Erosion control]]
**Straw bales are sometimes used for [[sediment control]] at [[construction]] sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casqa.org California Stormwater Quality Association.] Menlo Park, CA.
[http://www.cabmphandbooks.com/Documents/Construction/SE-9.pdf “California Stormwater BMP Handbook: Straw Bale Barrier.”] Best Management Practice (BMP) No. SE-9. January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, bales are often ineffective in protecting [[water quality]] and are maintenance-intensive.  For these reasons the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and various state agencies recommend use of alternative sediment control practices where possible, such as [[silt fence]]s, [[fiber roll]]s and [[geotextiles]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

* Hats
**There are several styles of [[straw hat]]s that are made of woven straw.
**Many thousands of women and children in England (primarily in the [[Luton]] district of Bedfordshire),&lt;ref name="eb9"&gt;{{Cite EB9|wstitle=Straw Manufactures|volume=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and large numbers in the United States (mostly [[Massachusetts]]), were employed in [[Straw Plaiting|plaiting straw]] for making hats.  By the late 19th century, vast quantities of plaits were being imported to England from Canton in China,&lt;ref name="eb9" /&gt; and in the United States most of the straw plait was imported.&lt;ref name="ac"&gt;{{Cite AmCyc|wstitle=Straw}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**A fiber analogous to straw is obtained from the plant ''[[Carludovica palmata]]'', and is used to make [[Panama hats]].&lt;ref name="ac" /&gt;
**Traditional Japanese rain protection consisted of a straw hat and a [[mino (straw cape)|mino cape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Henshall|first1=Kenneth|title=A History of Japan: From Stone Age to Superpower|publisher=Springer|isbn=9780230346628|page=67|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vD76fF5hqf8C&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;pg=PA67|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Horticulture]]
**Straw is used in [[cucumber]] houses and for [[mushroom]] growing.
**In [[Japan]], certain trees are wrapped with straw to protect them from the effects of a hard winter as well as to use them as a trap for parasite insects.
**It is also used in ponds to reduce [[alga]]e by changing the nutrient ratios in the water.
**The soil under [[strawberry|strawberries]] is covered with straw to protect the ripe berries from dirt, and straw is also used to cover the plants during winter to prevent the cold from killing them.
**Straw also makes an excellent [[mulch]].
*[[Packaging]]
**Straw is resistant to being crushed and therefore makes a good packing material. A company in France makes a straw mat sealed in thin plastic sheets.
**Straw envelopes for wine bottles have become rarer, but are still to be found at some wine merchants.
**Wheat straw is also used in compostable [[food packaging]] such as compostable plates. Packaging made from wheat straw can be certified compostable and will biodegrade in a commercial composting environment.&lt;ref name="VBC"&gt;Viv Biz Club: [http://vivbizclub.com/products/biodegradable-food-packaging/compostable-plates/ Compostable Plates] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731150916/http://vivbizclub.com/products/biodegradable-food-packaging/compostable-plates/ |date=2010-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Paper
**[[File:Belarusian Straw Bird.jpg|thumb|Belarusian Straw Bird]]Straw can be pulped to make [[paper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QbH9AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA176&amp;dq=Straw+can+be+pulped+to+make+paper&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3zoywk-vUAhUM0GMKHUv6AEoQ6AEIPTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Straw%20can%20be%20pulped%20to%20make%20paper&amp;f=false|title=Tomorrow's World: Britain's Share in a Sustainable Future|last=McLaren|first=Duncan|last2=Bullock|first2=Simon|last3=Yousuf|first3=Nusrat|date=2013-11-05|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=9781134044825|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Rope
**Rope made from straw was used by thatchers, in the packaging industry and even in iron foundries.
* [[Shoe]]s
** [[Koreans]] wear [[jipsin]], sandals made of straw.
** In some parts of Germany like [[Black Forest]] and [[Hunsrück]] people wear straw shoes at home or at carnival.
*Targets
**Heavy gauge straw rope is coiled and sewn tightly together to make [[archery]] targets. This is no longer done entirely by hand, but is partially mechanised.  Sometimes a paper or plastic target is set up in front of straw bales, which serve to support the target and provide a safe backdrop.
* [[Thatching]]
**Thatching uses straw, [[Reed (plant)|reed]] or similar materials to make a waterproof, lightweight roof with good insulation properties.  Straw for this purpose (often [[wheat]] straw) is grown specially and harvested using a [[reaper-binder]].

== Health and safety ==
Dried straw presents a fire hazard that can ignite easily if exposed to sparks or an open flame. It can also trigger [[allergic rhinitis]] in people who are hypersensitive to airborne allergens such as straw dust.

== Research==
In addition to its current and historic uses, straw is being investigated as a source of [[fine chemical]]s including [[alkaloid]]s, [[flavonoid]]s, [[lignin]]s, [[phenols]], and [[steroid]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid24138469"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Schnitzer M, Monreal CM, Powell EE | title=Wheat straw biomass: A resource for high-value chemicals| journal=Journal of Environmental Science and Health, Part B| year= 2014 | volume= 49 | issue= 1 | pages= 51–67 | pmid=24138469 | doi=10.1080/03601234.2013.836924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Evolutionary biology}}
The '''theoretical foundations of evolutionary psychology''' are the general and specific scientific theories that explain the ultimate origins of psychological traits in terms of [[evolution]]. These theories originated with [[Charles Darwin]]'s work, including his speculations about the evolutionary origins of social instincts in humans. Modern [[evolutionary psychology]], however, is possible only because of advances in evolutionary theory in the 20th century.

Evolutionary psychologists say that [[natural selection]] has provided humans with many [[psychological adaptation]]s, in much the same way that it generated humans' anatomical and physiological adaptations.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; As with adaptations in general, psychological adaptations are said to be specialized for the environment in which an organism evolved, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness, or EEA.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also "Environment of evolutionary adaptation," a variation of the term used in Economics, e.g., in Rubin, Paul H., 2003, ''"Folk economics"'' Southern Economic Journal, 70:1, July 2003, 157-171.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexual selection]] provides organisms with adaptations related to mating.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; For male [[mammal]]s, which have a relatively fast reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to adaptations that help them compete for females.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; For female mammals, with a relatively slow reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to choosiness, which helps females select higher quality mates.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Charles Darwin described both natural selection and sexual selection, but he relied on group selection to explain the evolution of self-sacrificing behavior. Group selection is a weak explanation because in any group the less self-sacrificing animals will be more likely to survive and the group will become less self-sacrificing.

In 1964, [[W.D. Hamilton|William D. Hamilton]] proposed [[inclusive fitness]] theory, emphasizing a "[[gene-centered view of evolution|gene's-eye]]" view of evolution. Hamilton noted that individuals can increase the replication of their genes into the next generation by helping close relatives with whom they share genes survive and reproduce. According to "[[Hamilton's rule]]", a self-sacrificing behavior can evolve if it helps close relatives so much that it more than compensates for the individual animal's sacrifice. Inclusive fitness theory resolved the issue of how "altruism" evolved. Other theories also help explain the evolution of altruistic behavior, including [[evolutionary game theory]], [[tit-for-tat]] reciprocity, and generalized reciprocity. These theories not only help explain the development of altruistic behavior but also account for hostility toward cheaters (individuals that take advantage of others' altruism).&lt;ref name = "moralanimal"/&gt;

Several mid-level evolutionary theories inform evolutionary psychology. The [[r/K selection]] theory proposes that some species prosper by having many offspring while others follow the strategy of having fewer offspring but investing much more in each one. Humans follow the second strategy. [[Parental investment]] theory explains how parents invest more or less in individual offspring based on how successful those offspring are likely to be, and thus how much they might improve the parents' inclusive fitness. According to the [[Trivers-Willard hypothesis]], parents in good conditions tend to invest more in sons (who are best able to take advantage of good conditions), while parents in poor conditions tend to invest more in daughters (who are best able to have successful offspring even in poor conditions). According to [[life history theory]], animals evolve life histories to match their environments, determining details such as age at first reproduction and number of offspring. [[Dual inheritance theory]] posits that genes and human culture have interacted, with genes affecting the development of culture and culture, in turn, affecting human evolution on a genetic level (see also the [[Baldwin effect]]).

[[Criticism of evolutionary psychology|Critics of evolutionary psychology]] have sometimes challenged its theoretical underpinnings, saying that humans never developed powerful social instincts through natural selection and that the hypotheses of evolutionary psychologists are merely just-so-stories.

==General evolutionary theory==
{{Main|Evolution}}
Evolutionary psychology primarily uses the theories of natural selection, sexual selection, and inclusive fitness to explain the evolution of psychological adaptations.

Evolutionary psychology is sometimes seen not simply as a subdiscipline of psychology but as a metatheoretical framework in which ''the entire field of psychology can be examined.''&lt;ref name="Cosmides"&gt;{{cite web |last=Cosmides |first=L |authorlink=Leda Cosmides |author2=Tooby J |authorlink2=John Tooby  |date=1997-01-13 |url=http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/research/cep/primer.html |title= Evolutionary Psychology: A Primer |accessdate=2008-02-16 |publisher=Center for Evolutionary Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural selection===
{{Main|Natural selection}}
Evolutionary psychologists consider Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection to be important to an understanding of psychology.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"&gt;Gaulin, Steven J. C. and Donald H. McBurney. Evolutionary Psychology. Prentice Hall. 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-13-111529-3}}, Chapter 2, “Natural Selection,” p 25-56.&lt;/ref&gt; Natural selection occurs because individual organisms who are genetically better suited to the current environment leave more descendants, and their genes spread through the population, thus explaining why organisms fit their environments so closely.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; This process is slow and cumulative, with new traits layered over older traits.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; The advantages created by natural selection are known as adaptations.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Evolutionary psychologists say that animals, just as they evolve physical adaptations, evolve psychological adaptations.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt;

Evolutionary psychologists emphasize that natural selection mostly generates specialized adaptations, which are more efficient than general adaptations.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; They point out that natural selection operates slowly, and that adaptations are sometimes out of date when the environment changes rapidly.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; In the case of humans, evolutionary psychologists say that much of human nature was shaped during the stone age and may not match the contemporary environment.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt;

===Sexual selection===
{{Main|Sexual selection}}
Sexual selection favors traits that provide mating advantages, such as the peacock's tail, even if these same traits are usually hindrances.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Evolutionary psychologists point out that, unlike natural selection, sexual selection typically leads to the evolution of sex differences.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"&gt;Gaulin, Steven J. C. and Donald H. McBurney. Evolutionary Psychology. Prentice Hall. 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-13-111529-3}}, Chapter 2, “Natural Selection,” p 25-56.&lt;/ref&gt; Sex differences typically make reproduction faster for one sex and slower for the other, in which case mates are relatively scarce for the faster sex.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Sexual selection favors traits that increase the number of mates for the fast sex and the quality of mates for the slow sex.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; For mammals, the female has the slower reproduction rate.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Males typically evolve either traits to help them fight other males or traits to impress females.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Females typically evolve greater abilities to discern the qualities of males, such as choosiness in mating.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt;

===Inclusive fitness===
[[Inclusive fitness]] theory, proposed by [[W.D. Hamilton|William D. Hamilton]], emphasized a "[[Gene-centered view of evolution|gene's-eye]]" view of evolution.  Hamilton noted that what evolution ultimately selects are genes, not groups or species.  From this perspective, individuals can increase the replication of their genes into the next generation not only directly via reproduction, by also indirectly helping close relatives with whom they share genes survive and reproduce.   General evolutionary theory, in its modern form, ''is'' essentially inclusive fitness theory.

Inclusive fitness theory resolved the issue of how "altruism" evolved. The dominant, pre-Hamiltonian view was that altruism evolved via [[group selection]]: the notion that altruism evolved for the benefit of the group. The problem with this was that if one organism in a group incurred any fitness costs on itself for the benefit of others in the group, (i.e. acted "altruistically"), then that organism would reduce its own ability to survive and/or reproduce, therefore reducing its chances of passing on its altruistic traits.

Furthermore, the organism that benefited from that altruistic act and only acted on behalf of its own fitness would increase its own chance of survival and/or reproduction, thus increasing its chances of passing on its "selfish" traits.
Inclusive fitness resolved "the problem of altruism" by demonstrating that altruism can evolve via kin selection as expressed in [[Hamilton's rule]]:
&lt;center&gt;cost &amp;lt; relatedness × benefit&lt;/center&gt;
In other words, altruism can evolve as long as the fitness ''cost'' of the altruistic act on the part of the actor is less than the ''degree of genetic relatedness'' of the recipient times the fitness ''benefit'' to that recipient.
This perspective reflects what is referred to as the [[gene-centered view of evolution]] and demonstrates that group selection is a very weak selective force.

| '''''[[Sexual selection]]'''''&lt;ref name="moralanimal"/&gt;

Organisms can evolve physical and mental traits designed specifically to attract mates (e.g., the Peacock's tail) or to compete with members of one's own sex for access to the opposite sex (e.g., antlers).

| [[W.D. Hamilton]] (1964)
| '''''[[Inclusive fitness]] (or "gene's eye view", "kin selection") / Evolution of sexual reproduction'''''&lt;ref name="moralanimal"/&gt;

Selection occurs most robustly at the level of the gene, not the individual, group, or species. Reproductive success can thus be indirect, via shared genes in kin. Being altruistic toward kin can thus have genetic payoffs. (Also see [[Gene-centered view of evolution]])
Also, Hamilton argued that sexual reproduction evolved primarily as a defense against pathogens (bacteria and viruses) to "shuffle genes" to create greater diversity, especially immunological variability, in offspring.
| Altruism toward kin, parental investment, the behavior of the social insects with sterile workers (e.g., ants).

| [[Robert Trivers]] (1972)
| '''''[[Parental Investment]] Theory / Parent - Offspring Conflict / Reproductive Value'''''&lt;ref name="moralanimal"/&gt;

The two sexes often have conflicting strategies regarding how much to invest in offspring, and how many offspring to have. Parents allocate more resources to their offspring with higher reproductive value (e.g., "mom always liked you best"). Parents and offspring may have conflicting interests (e.g., when to wean, allocation of resources among offspring, etc.)

| '''''Game Theory / [[Evolutionary Game Theory]]'''''&lt;ref name="moralanimal"/&gt;

Organisms adapt, or respond, to competitors depending on the strategies used by competitors. Strategies are evaluated by the probable payoffs of alternatives. In a population, this typically results in an "evolutionary stable strategy," or "evolutionary stable equilibrium"—strategies that, on average, cannot be bettered by alternative strategies.

A specific game strategy (see above) that has been shown to be optimal in achieving an evolutionary stable equilibrium in situations of repeated social interactions. One plays nice with non-kin if a mutually beneficially reciprocal relationship is maintained across multiple interactions, while cheating is punished.
| Cheater detection, emotions of revenge and guilt, etc.

| [[Herbert Gintis]] (2000, 2003) and others

(Also called "strong reciprocity"). One can play nice with non-kin strangers even in single interactions if social rules against cheating are maintained by neutral third parties (e.g., other individuals, governments, institutions, etc.), a majority group members cooperate by generally adhering to social rules, and social interactions create a positive sum game (i.e., a bigger overall "pie" results from group cooperation).

Generalized reciprocity may be a set of adaptations that were designed for small in-group cohesion during times of high intertribal warfare with out-groups.

Today the capacity to be altruistic to in-group strangers may result from a serendipitous generalization (or "mismatch") between ancestral tribal living in small groups and today's large societies that entail many single interactions with strangers. (The dark side of generalized reciprocity may be that these adaptations may also underlie aggression toward out-groups.)

==Middle-level evolutionary theories==
Middle-level evolutionary theories are consistent with general evolutionary theory, but focus on certain domains of functioning (Buss, 2011)&lt;ref&gt;Buss, D.M. (2011). Evolutionary Psychology. NY: Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;  Specific evolutionary psychology hypotheses may be derivative from a mid-level theory (Buss, 2011).   Three very important middle-level evolutionary theories were contributed by [[Robert Trivers]] as well as [[Robert MacArthur]] and [[E. O. Wilson]]&lt;ref name="Pianka, E.R 1970"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trivers|first=Robert L.|title=The evolution of reciprocal altruism|journal=Quarterly Review of Biology|volume=46|issue=1|pages=35–57|date=March 1971|doi=10.1086/406755|jstor=2822435}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last=Trivers|first=Robert L.|chapter=Parental investment and sexual selection|editor=Bernard Campbell|title=Sexual selection and the descent of man, 1871-1971|pages=136–179|publisher=Aldine Transaction (Chicago)|date=1972|isbn=0-202-02005-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Trivers|first=Robert L.|title=Parent-offspring conflict|volume=14|issue=1|pages=249–264|date=1974|doi=10.1093/icb/14.1.249|publisher=The Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology|journal=American Zoologist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The theory of '''[[parent-offspring conflict]]''' rests on the fact that even though a parent and his/her offspring are 50% genetically related, they are also 50% genetically different. All things being equal, a parent would want to allocate their resources equally amongst their offspring, while each offspring may want a little more for themselves. Furthermore, an offspring may want a little more resources from the parent than the parent is willing to give. In essence, parent-offspring conflict refers to ''a conflict of adaptive interests'' between parent and offspring. However, if all things are not equal, a parent may engage in discriminative investment towards one sex or the other, depending on the ''parent's'' condition.
*The '''[[Trivers–Willard hypothesis]]''', which proposes that parents will invest more in the sex that gives them the greatest reproductive payoff (grandchildren) with increasing or marginal investment. Females are the heavier parental investors in our species. Because of that, females have a better chance of reproducing at least once in comparison to males, but males in good condition have a better chance of producing high numbers of offspring than do females in good condition. Thus, according to the [[Trivers–Willard hypothesis]], parents in good condition are predicted to favor investment in sons, and parents in poor condition are predicted to favor investment in daughters.
*'''[[r/K selection theory]]''',&lt;ref name="Pianka, E.R 1970"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pianka | first1 = E.R. | authorlink = Eric Pianka | date = 1970 | title = On r and K selection | journal = American Naturalist | volume = 104 | issue = 940| pages = 592–597 | doi = 10.1086/282697 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which, in [[ecology]], relates to the selection of traits in organisms that allow success in particular environments. [[r-selected]] species, i.e., species in unstable or unpredictable environments, produce many offspring, each of which is unlikely to survive to adulthood. By contrast, [[K-selected]] species, i.e., species in stable or predictable environments, invest more heavily in fewer offspring, each of which has a better chance of surviving to adulthood.
*'''[[Life history theory]]''' posits that the schedule and duration of key events in an organism's lifetime are shaped by natural selection to produce the largest possible number of surviving offspring.  For any given individual, available resources in any particular environment are finite. Time, effort, and energy used for one purpose diminishes the time, effort, and energy available for another. Examples of some major life history characteristics include: age at first reproductive event, reproductive lifespan and aging, and number and size of offspring. Variations in these characteristics reflect different allocations of an individual's resources (i.e., time, effort, and energy expenditure) to competing life functions. For example, [[attachment theory]] proposes that caregiver attentiveness in early childhood can determine later [[Attachment in adults|adult attachment style]]. Also, [[Jay Belsky]] and others have found evidence that if the father is absent from the home, girls reach first menstruation earlier and also have more short term sexual relationships as women.&lt;ref&gt;Buss, D. (2011).  Evolutionary Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5340">The '''Wigner effect''' (named for its discoverer, [[Eugene Wigner]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.1707653 | title = Theoretical Physics in the Metallurgical Laboratory of Chicago | year = 1946 | last1 = Wigner | first1 = E. P. | journal = Journal of Applied Physics | volume = 17 | issue = 11 | pages = 857–863|bibcode = 1946JAP....17..857W }}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the '''discomposition effect''' or '''Wigner's Disease''',&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, Richard; (1995); "Dark Sun: The Making Of The Hydrogen Bomb"; Simon &amp; Schuster; pg 277.&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[dislocation]] of [[atom]]s in a solid caused by [[neutron radiation]]. 

Any solid can display the Wigner effect. The effect is of most concern in [[neutron moderator]]s, such as [[graphite]], intended to reduce the speed of [[Neutron temperature#Fast|fast neutrons]], thereby turning them into [[Neutron temperature|thermal neutrons]] capable of sustaining a nuclear chain reaction involving [[uranium-235]].

== Explanation ==
To create the Wigner effect, [[neutron]]s that collide with the atoms in a [[crystal structure]] must have enough [[energy]] to displace them from the lattice. This amount ([[threshold displacement energy]]) is approximately 25 [[Electronvolt|eV]]. A neutron's energy can vary widely, but it is not uncommon to have energies up to and exceeding 10 MeV (10,000,000 eV) in the centre of a [[nuclear reactor]]. A neutron with a significant amount of energy will create a [[Collision cascade|displacement cascade]] in a matrix via [[elastic collision]]s. For example, a 1 MeV neutron striking [[graphite]] will create 900 displacements; not all displacements will create defects, because some of the struck atoms will find and fill the vacancies that were either small pre-existing voids or vacancies newly formed by the other struck atoms.

The atoms that do not find a [[vacancy defect|vacancy]] come to rest in non-ideal locations; that is, not along the symmetrical lines of the lattice. These atoms are referred to as [[interstitial defect|interstitial atoms]], or simply interstitials. An interstitial atom and its associated vacancy are known as a [[Frenkel defect]]. Because these atoms are not in the ideal location, they have an energy associated with them, much as a ball at the top of a hill has [[Potential energy#Gravitational potential energy|gravitational potential energy]]. This energy is referred to as [[Wigner energy]]. When a large number of [[interstitial defect|interstitials]] have accumulated, they pose a risk of releasing all of their energy suddenly, creating a rapid, very great increase in temperature. Sudden, unplanned increases in temperature can present a large risk for certain types of nuclear reactors with low operating temperatures; one such was the indirect cause of the [[Windscale fire]]. Accumulation of energy in irradiated graphite has been recorded as high as 2.7 kJ/g, but is typically much lower than this.&lt;ref&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency. [http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/te_1521_web.pdf Characterization, Treatment and Conditioning of Radioactive Graphite from Decommissioning of Nuclear Reactors] (September 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Graphite, having a heat capacity of 0.720 J/g°C, could see a sudden increase in temperature of about 3750&amp;nbsp;°C (6780&amp;nbsp;°F).

Despite some reports,&lt;ref&gt;Workshop on Short-Term Health Effects of Reactor Accidents: Chernobyl, August 8–9, 1986
V.P. Bond and E.P. Cronkite, Editors　[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/6905797-IIYHeP/6905797.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Wigner energy buildup had nothing to do with the cause of the [[Chernobyl disaster]]: this reactor, like all contemporary power reactors, operated at a high enough temperature to allow the displaced graphite structure to realign itself before any potential energy could be stored.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/chernobyl-meltdown-no-graphite-us-nuclear-reactors-2016-4&lt;/ref&gt; Wigner energy may have played some part following the [[prompt criticality|prompt critical]] neutron spike, when the accident entered the graphite fire phase of events.

== Dissipation of Wigner energy ==
A buildup of Wigner energy can be relieved by heating the material. This process is known as [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]]. In graphite this occurs at 250&amp;nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euronuclear.org/info/encyclopedia/w/wigner-energy.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intimate Frenkel pairs ==
In 2003, it was postulated that Wigner energy can be stored by the formation of metastable defect structures in graphite. Notably, the large energy release observed at 200–250&amp;nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]] has been described in terms of a metastable interstitial-vacancy pair.&lt;ref&gt;Metastable Frenkel Pair Defect in Graphite: Source of Wigner Energy? C. P. Ewels, R. H. Telling, A. A. El-Barbary, M. I. Heggie, and P. R. Briddon Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 025505 – Published 10 July 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The interstitial atom becomes trapped on the lip of the vacancy, and there is a barrier for it to recombine to give perfect graphite.

Compared to the preindustrial era, wildland land fire in the [[conterminous U.S.]] has been reduced 90 percent with proportional reductions in wildland fire emissions. Land use changes ([[agricultur]]e and [[urbanization]]) are responsible for roughly 50 percent of this decrease, and land management decisions (land [[habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]], [[Wildfire suppression|suppression]] actions, etc.) are responsible for the remainder. [[human impact on the environment|Anthropogenic]] activities (e.g., [[industrial production]], [[transportation]], [[agriculture]], etc.) today have more than replaced the lost preindustrial wildland fire atmospheric emissions.&lt;ref&gt;Leenhouts, B. 1998.Assessment of biomass burning in the conterminous United States.
