'''''Abie's Irish Rose''''' is a popular comedy by [[Anne Nichols]] familiar from stage productions, films and radio programs. The basic premise involves an [[Irish Catholic]] girl and a young [[Jew]]ish man who marry despite the objections of their families.

==Theater and films==
Although initially receiving poor reviews, the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Play (theatre)|play]] was a commercial hit, running for 2,327 performances between May 23, 1922, and October 1, 1927, at the time the [[List of Broadway shows that have held title of longest-running show|longest run in Broadway theater history]], surpassing the record 1,291 performances set by the [[Winchell Smith]] and [[Frank Bacon (actor)|Frank Bacon]] 1918 play, ''[[Lightnin' (play)|Lightnin']]''.&lt;ref&gt;W. R. Benet, ''The Reader's Encyclopedia'', 1948, ''s.v.'' "''Abie's Irish Rose''"; [http://www.world-theatres.com/longruns.html#longruns.london.html Long Runs in the Theater website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402061014/http://world-theatres.com/longruns.html |date=2010-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Abroad", ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]] June 2, 1927, ProQuest Historical Newspapers, ''The Guardian'' and ''The Observer'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  The show's touring company had a similarly long run and held the record for longest running touring company for nearly 40 years until the record was broken by ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' in the 1960s. The touring company's male lead was played by a young [[George Brent]], the future Hollywood actor's first major role, and the female lead was played by [https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/153781 Peggy Parry].

The play was twice the inspiration for films: in 1928 with [[Charles "Buddy" Rogers]] and [[Nancy Carroll]], directed by [[Victor Fleming]], and in 1946 with Richard Norris and [[Joanne Dru]], directed by A. Edward Sutherland. The 1946 version, produced by [[Bing Crosby]], met with considerable published controversy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/24671 AFI|Catalog Abie's Irish Rose (1946)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio==
It inspired the weekly [[NBC]] radio series, '''''Abie's Irish Rose''''',  which replaced ''Knickerbocker Playhouse'' and ran from January 24, 1942, through September 2, 1944. Faced with listener protests about its stereotyped ethnic portrayals, the radio series was cancelled in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/24671 AFI|Catalog Abie's Irish Rose (1946)]&lt;/ref&gt; Nichols wrote the scripts. Axel Gruenbert&lt;ref name="bb020742"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ackerman|first1=Paul|title=Program Reviews: 'Abie's Irish Rose'|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/40s/1942/Billboard%201942-02-07.o.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2015|agency=Billboard|date=February 7, 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Joe Rines directed the cast that starred Richard Bond, Sydney Smith, [[Richard Coogan]] and [[Bud Collyer|Clayton "Bud" Collyer]] as Abie Levy. Betty Winkler, [[Mercedes McCambridge]], [[Julie Stevens (American radio actress)|Julie Stevens]], [[Bernard Gorcey]], and Marion Shockley portrayed Rosemary Levy. Solomon Levy was played by Alfred White, [[Charlie Cantor]] and [[Alan Reed]].

Others in the radio cast: [[Walter Kinsella (actor)|Walter Kinsella]] (as Patrick Murphy), [[Menasha Skulnik]] (Isaac Cohen), Anna Appel (Mrs. Cohen), Ann Thomas (Casey), Bill Adams (Father Whelan), Amanda Randolph (maid) and Dolores Gillenas (the Levys' twins). The announcer was Howard Petrie, and Joe Stopak provided the music. The opening theme music was "[[My Wild Irish Rose]]" by [[Chauncey Olcott]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunning, John. ''On The Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio''. Oxford University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-19-507678-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic premise was extensively copied, and Anne Nichols sued one imitator, Universal Pictures, which produced ''[[The Cohens and Kellys]]'', a motion picture play about an Irish boy who marries a Jewish girl from feuding families. However, in ''[[Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp.]]'', 45 F.2d 119 ([[2d Cir.]] 1930).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] found for the defendant, holding that [[Copyright in the United States|copyright protection]] cannot be extended to the characteristics of [[stock character]]s in a story, whether it be a book, play or film.

==Plot==
The plot was ably summarized by Judge [[Learned Hand]], in his opinion in the lawsuit:
:''Abie's Irish Rose'' presents a Jewish family living in prosperous circumstances in New York. The father, a widower, is in business as a merchant, in which his son and only child helps him. The boy has philandered with young women, who to his father's great disgust have always been Gentiles, for he is obsessed with a passion that his daughter-in-law shall be an orthodox Jew. When the play opens the son, who has been courting a young Irish Catholic girl, has already married her secretly before a Protestant minister, and concerned about how to soften the blow for his father securing a favorable reception for his bride, while concealing her faith and race. To accomplish this he introduces her to his father as a Jewish girl in whom he is interested and conceals the fact they are married. The girl somewhat reluctantly agrees to the plan; the father takes the bait, becomes infatuated with the girl, insists that they must marry. He assumes they will because it's the father's idea. He calls in a rabbi, and prepares for the wedding according to the Jewish rite.

:Meanwhile the girl's father, also a widower who lives in California and is as intense in his own religious antagonism as the Jew, has been called to New York, supposing that his daughter is to marry an Irishman and a Catholic. Accompanied by a priest, he arrives at the house at the moment when the marriage is being celebrated, so too late to prevent it, and the two fathers, each infuriated by the proposed union of his child to a heretic, fall into unseemly and grotesque antics. The priest and the rabbi become friendly, exchange trite sentiments about religion, and agree that the match is good. Apparently out of abundant caution, the priest celebrates the marriage for a third time, while the girl's father is inveigled away. The second act closes with each father, still outraged, seeking to find some way by which the union, thus trebly insured, may be dissolved.

:The last act takes place about a year later, the young couple having meanwhile been abjured by each father, and left to their own resources.  They have had twins, a boy and a girl, but their fathers know no more than that a child has been born. At Christmas each, led by his craving to see his grandchild, goes separately to the young folks' home, where they encounter each other, each laden with gifts, one for a boy, the other for a girl. After some slapstick comedy, depending upon the insistence of each that he is right about the sex of the grandchild, they become reconciled when they learn the truth, and that each child is to bear the given name of a grandparent. The curtain falls as the fathers are exchanging amenities, and the Jew giving evidence of an abatement in the strictness of his orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coolcopyright.com/cases/fulltext/nicholsuniversaltext.htm Cool Copyright: Nichols vs. Universal, Circuit Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, November 10, 1930] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717083655/http://www.coolcopyright.com/cases/fulltext/nicholsuniversaltext.htm |date=July 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been some variations of the plot in different versions of the play/film. Nichols' original Broadway play had the couple meeting in France during [[World War I]], with the young man having been a soldier and the girl a nurse who had tended to him. In this version, the priest and the rabbi from the wedding are also veterans of the same war, and recognize one another from their time in the service.

==Critical response==
Although the play was a tremendous popular success, it was universally loathed by the critics. [[Robert Benchley]], then the theatre critic for ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, nursed a particular hatred for it. Part of Benchley's job was to write capsule reviews each week. ''Abie's Irish Rose'' he described variously as "Something Awful", "Just about as low as good clean fun can get", "Showing that the Jews and the Irish crack equally old jokes", "The comic spirit of 1876", "People laugh at this every night, which explains why democracy can never be a success", "Will the Marines never come?" and finally "Hebrews 13:8," a Biblical passage that reads, “Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and today, and forever.”&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Herrmann, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;  He also held a contest for an outsider to contribute the capsule review, which [[Harpo Marx]] won with "No worse than a bad cold."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Malarcher, Jay. "No, Siree! A One-Night Stand with the Algonquin Round Table"&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lorenz Hart]] expressed the feeling of many in the theater world in these lines for [[Manhattan (song)|"Manhattan"]]: "Our future babies we'll take to ''Abie's Irish Rose'' -- I hope they'll live to see it close." Writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' of its 1937 revival, [[Wolcott Gibbs]] said that "it had, in fact, the rather eerie quality of a repeated nightmare; the one, perhaps, in which I always find myself in an old well, thick with bats, and can't get out."

The play was popular enough for its title to be referenced in a pun in the Marx Brothers film ''[[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|Animal Crackers]]'', in the lyrics of the [[Cole Porter]] song [[Ace in the Hole (Cole Porter song)|"Ace in the Hole"]], the [[Stephen Sondheim]] song [[I'm Still Here (Follies song)|"I'm Still Here"]], and the song "The Legacy" from the musical ''[[On the Twentieth Century]]''.

==Thematic legacy==

''Abie's Irish Rose'' prefigured the comedy of [[Stiller_and_Meara|Stiller and Meara]], a husband-and-wife team ([[Jerry Stiller]] and [[Anne Meara]]), who often spiked their routines with references to their differing backgrounds (Stiller is Jewish; Meara was of an Irish Catholic background but converted to Judaism later during their marriage).

The play also provided the central premise for the 1972–73 television series ''[[Bridget Loves Bernie]]'' ([[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]]), which starred [[Meredith Baxter Birney|Meredith Baxter]] and [[David Birney]] (who later became husband and wife in real life) in a kind-of reversal of ''Abie's Irish Rose'' in that Birney played struggling young Jewish cab driver/aspiring playwright Bernie Steinberg, whose parents ran a modest family delicatessen, and Baxter played Irish Catholic daughter of wealthy parents, Bridget Fitzgerald, who falls in love with and elopes with Steinberg to the disappointment of both sets of parents. (Although both actors were Protestant, the casting partially inverted real life, Birney being of Irish descent.) The show was attacked by a broad range of Jewish groups for allegedly promoting inter-faith marriage,&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/07/archives/bridget-loves-bernie-attacked-by-jewish-groups.html | title=‘Bridget Loves Bernie’ Attacked by Jewish Groups | first=Albin | last=Krebs | date=February 7, 1973 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was cancelled at the end of its first season, despite being the fifth-highest-rated serial of the 1972–1973 year on USA broadcast television.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.interfaithfamily.com/blog/iff/bridget-loves-bernie-during-interfaith-family-month-we-celebrate-their-love/ ''Bridget Loves Bernie: During Interfaith Family Month We Celebrate Their Love'']&lt;/ref&gt;

But two decades later, with social attitudes changing in the USA, CBS would run another television series, ''[[Brooklyn Bridge (TV series)|Brooklyn Bridge]]'' (1991–1993), the quasi-autobiographical childhood memoir of its Jewish series creator, [[Gary_David_Goldberg|Gary David Goldberg]], which featured a continuing romance between two main (teenage) characters, a Jewish boy and an Irish Catholic girl. It ran two seasons, with the sixth (two-part) episode of the first season, titled ''War of the Worlds'', exploring the tensions of this inter-faith relationship in its mid-1950s Brooklyn fictional setting. (Goldberg had previously created another quasi-autobiographical television series, ''[[Family_Ties|Family Ties]]'', inspired by his adult life, in which the female lead, the alter-ego of his real-life Irish Catholic partner, had been portrayed by Meredith Baxter, the same actress who had starred in the ill-fated ''Bridget Loves Bernie''.)

'''Axial Age''' (also '''Axis Age''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =Introducing Philosophy of Religion | last =Meister | first = Chad | year= 2009 | publisher= Routledge | location = Abingdon | pages=10 | isbn=0-203-88002-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang-de|Achsenzeit}}) is a term coined by [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]] [[Karl Jaspers]] in the sense of a  "pivotal age" characterizing the period of [[ancient history]] from about the 8th to the 3rd century BCE.

Then, according to Jaspers' concept, new ways of thinking appeared in [[History of Iran|Persia]], [[History of India|India]], [[Zhou dynasty|China]] and the [[Classical antiquity|Greco-Roman world]] in [[religion]] and [[philosophy]], in a striking parallel development, without any obvious direct cultural contact between all of the participating [[Eurasia]]n cultures. Jaspers identified key thinkers from this age who had a profound influence on future philosophies and religions, and identified characteristics common to each area from which those thinkers emerged. 

Jaspers' approach to the culture of the middle of the [[first millennium BC]] has been adopted by other scholars and academics, and has become a point of discussion in the [[history of religion]].

==Definition==
Jaspers introduced the concept of an Axial Age in his book ''Vom Ursprung und Ziel der Geschichte'' (''The Origin and Goal of History''&lt;ref name="Jaspers"&gt;Karl Jaspers, '' Origin and Goal of History'', Routledge Revivals, 2011, {{ISBN|978-0415578806}}&lt;/ref&gt;), published in 1949. The simultaneous appearance of thinkers and philosophers in different areas of the world had been remarked by numerous authors since the 18th century, notably by the French Indologist [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron]].&lt;ref name="Metzler2009" /&gt; Jaspers explicitly cited some of these authors, including [[Victor von Strauß]] (1859) and [[Peter Ernst von Lasaulx ]](1870).&lt;ref name="Metzler2009"&gt;{{cite journal
|last1=Metzler|first1=Dieter
|title=Achsenzeit als Ereignis und Geschichte
|trans-title=Axial age as happening and history |language=German
|journal=Internet-Beiträge zur Ägyptologie und Sudanarchäologie (IBAES)|date=2009|volume=10|url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/nilus/net-publications/ibaes10/publikation/metzler_ibaes10.pdf|accessdate=17 January 2018|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Jasper's contribution was to claim that the Axial Age should be viewed as an objective empirical fact of history, independently of religious considerations.&lt;ref&gt;Jaspers K.,''The Origin and Goal of History'', p.1&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that during the Axial Age, "the spiritual foundations of humanity were laid simultaneously and independently in China, India, Persia, Judea, and Greece. And these are the foundations upon which humanity still subsists today".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jaspers | first = Karl | title = The Way to Wisdom : An Introduction to Philosophy | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 2003 | location = New Haven, CT |page=98 | isbn = 0-300-09735-2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IfAgyKFpWaEC&amp;pg=PA98}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He identified a number of key thinkers as having had a profound influence on future philosophies and religions, and identified characteristics common to each area from which those thinkers emerged. Jaspers held up this age as unique, and one to which the rest of the [[history of ideas|history of human thought]] might be compared.

==Characteristics==
Jaspers presented his first outline of the Axial age by a series of examples:

{{quote|[[Confucius]] and [[Lao-Tse]] were living in China, all the schools of Chinese philosophy came into being, including those of [[Mo Ti]], [[Zhuang Zhou|Chuang Tse]], [[Lieh Tzu]] and a host of others; India produced the [[Upanishads]] and [[Buddha]] and, like China, ran the whole gamut of philosophical possibilities down to [[materialism]], [[scepticism]] and [[nihilism]]; in Iran [[Zarathustra]] taught a challenging view of the world as a struggle between good and evil; in Palestine the prophets made their appearance from [[Elijah]] by way of [[Isaiah]] and [[Jeremiah]] to [[Deutero-Isaiah]]; Greece witnessed the appearance of [[Homer]], of the philosophers – [[Parmenides]], [[Heraclitus]] and [[Plato]], – of the tragedians, of [[Thucydides]] and [[Archimedes]]. Everything implied by these names developed during these few centuries almost simultaneously in China, India and the West.|Karl Jaspers, ''Origin and Goal of History'', p. 2}}
[[File:Karl Jaspers 1946.jpg|thumb|258x258px|Jaspers argued that the Axial Age gave birth to philosophy as a discipline]]
Jaspers described the Axial Age as "an interregnum between two ages of great [[empire]], a pause for [[liberty]], a deep breath bringing the most lucid consciousness".&lt;ref name="Jaspers51"&gt;{{Harvnb | Jaspers | 1953 | p = 51}} quoted in {{Harvnb | Armstrong | 2006 | p = 367}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that the Axial Age was a historically [[Liminality|liminal]] period, when old certainties had lost their validity and new ones were still not ready.&lt;ref name = "Thomassen"&gt;{{citation | last = Thomassen | first= Bjorn | authorlink= Bjorn Thomassen | journal = Anthropological Theory |volume = 10 | number = 4 | year=2010 | pages = 321–42 | title = Anthropology, multiple modernities and the axial age debate | url= http://ant.sagepub.com/content/10/4/321.full.pdf+html | doi= 10.1177/1463499610386659}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Jaspers had a particular interest in the similarities in circumstance and thought of its figures. Similarities included an engagement in the quest for human meaning&lt;ref name = "Neville"&gt;{{cite book | last = Neville | first = Robert Cummings | title=Religion in Late Modernity | url= https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN079145424X&amp;id=OWkrdZ2yh3EC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;vq=%22Axial+Age | year = 2002 | publisher = SUNY Press | isbn =0-7914-5424-X | page = 104}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rise of a new [[elite]] class of religious leaders and thinkers in China, India and the Occident.&lt;ref name="Eisenstadt"&gt;{{cite book | last= Eisenstadt | first= SN | authorlink = Shmuel Eisenstadt | title = The Origins and Diversity of Axial Age Civilizations | year=1986 | publisher= SUNY Press | isbn = 0-88706-094-3 | pages=1–2 | chapter = Introduction | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0887060943&amp;id=OFGIYBK2hu8C&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

These spiritual foundations were laid by individual thinkers within a framework of a changing social environment. Jaspers argues that the characteristics appeared under similar political circumstances: China, India, the Middle East and the Occident each comprised multiple small states engaged in internal and external struggles.
The three regions all gave birth to, and then institutionalized, a tradition of travelling scholars, who roamed from city to city to exchange ideas. After the [[Spring and Autumn period]] and the [[Warring States period]], [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]] emerged in China. In other regions, the scholars were largely from extant religious traditions; in India, from [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]]; in Persia, from [[Zoroastrianism]]; in [[The Levant]], from [[Judaism]]; and in Greece, from [[Sophist|Sophism]] and other classical philosophies.

Many of the cultures of the axial age were considered second-generation societies because they were built on the societies that preceded them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Worlds Together Worlds Apart |last=Pollard |last2=Rosenberg |last3=Tignor |first= Elizabeth |first2=Clifford |first3=Robert|publisher = Norton|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-393-91847-2|location = NewYork|pages = 162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buddhism]], also of the sramana tradition of India, was another of the world's most influential philosophies, founded by [[Siddhartha Gautama]], or the Buddha, who lived during this period; its spread was aided by [[Ashoka]], who lived late in the period.

In China, the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] were in contention and [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]] arose during this era, and in this area it remains a profound influence on social and religious life.

[[Zoroastrianism]], another of Jaspers' examples, is one of the first monotheistic religions and some believe it greatly influenced modern Abrahamic religions with such conceptions as the devil and Heaven/Hell.&lt;ref name = "Boyce1979"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyce|first= Mary | authorlink = Mary Boyce | title = Zoroastrians: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices| publisher= Routledge| location= London| year= 1979 | isbn = 0-415-23903-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact date of [[Zoroaster]]'s life is debated by scholars, with some, such as Mary Boyce, arguing that Zoroastrianism itself is significantly older.&lt;ref name= "Boyce1979" /&gt; Others, such as William W Malandra and RC Zaehner, suggest that he may indeed have been an early contemporary of Cyrus living around 600 BC.&lt;ref name = "Malandra1983"&gt;{{cite book|last=Malandra|first=William|authorlink=William W.

Jaspers' axial shifts included the rise of [[Platonism]], which would later become a major influence on the Western world through both [[Christianity]] and secular thought throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and into the [[Renaissance]].

==Reception==
In addition to Jaspers, the philosopher [[Eric Voegelin]] referred to this age as ''The Great Leap of Being'', constituting a new spiritual awakening and a shift of perception from societal to individual values.&lt;ref name = "Voegelin1985"&gt;{{cite book| last= Voegelin|first= Eric|authorlink= Eric Voegelin| series= Collected Works | volume = 18 | title=Order and History (Volume V): In Search of Order|location=Columbia, [[Missouri|MO]] | publisher = The University of Missouri Press| year= 2000| origyear= 1985| isbn= 978-0-8262-1261-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thinkers and teachers like the Buddha, [[Pythagoras]], [[Heraclitus]], [[Parmenides]], and [[Anaxagoras]] contributed to such awakenings which Plato would later call ''[[anamnesis (philosophy)|anamnesis]]'', or a remembering of things forgotten.

[[David Christian (historian)|David Christian]] notes that the first "universal religions" appeared in the age of the first universal [[empire]]s and of the first all-encompassing [[trading network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Christian | first1 = David | author-link1 = David Christian (historian) | title = Maps of Time: An Introduction to Big History | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VUqZl7RdNtwC | series = California World History Library | volume = 2 | publisher = University of California Press | publication-date = 2004 | page = 319 | isbn = 978-0-520-23500-7 | accessdate = 2013-12-29 | quote = Not until the first millennium BCE do the first universal religions appear. Though associated in practice with particular dynasties or empires, they proclaimed universal truths and worshiped all-powerful gods. It is no accident that universal religions appeared when both empires and exchange networks reached to the edge of the known universe. Nor is it an accident that one of the earliest religions of this type, Zoroastrianism, appeared in the largest empire of the mid-first millennium BCE, that of the Achaemenids, and at the hub of trade routes that were weaving Afro-Eurasia into a single world system. Indeed, most of the universal religions appeared in the hub region between Mesopotamia and northern India. They included Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism in Persia, Buddhism in India, Confucianism in China, and Judaism, Christianity and Islam in the Mediterranean world.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anthropology|Anthropologist]] [[David Graeber]] has pointed out that "the core period of Jasper's Axial age [...] corresponds almost exactly to the period in which coinage was invented.  What's more, the three parts of the world where coins were first invented were also the very parts of the world where those sages lived; in fact, they became the epicenters of Axial Age religious and philosophical creativity."&lt;ref name = "Graeber"&gt;{{Harvnb | Graeber | 2011 | p = 224}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on the work of classicist [[Richard Seaford]] and literary theorist [[Marc Shell]] on the relation between coinage and early Greek thought, Graeber argues that an understanding of the rise of markets is necessary to grasp the context in which the religious and philosophical insights of the Axial age arose. The ultimate effect of the introduction of coinage was, he argues, an "ideal division of spheres of human activity that endures to this day: on the one hand the market, on the other, religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Graeber | 2011 | p = 249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German sociologist [[Max Weber]] played an important role in Jaspers' thinking.&lt;ref name= "Stanford"&gt;{{cite web | year=2006 | title = Karl Jaspers | work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/jaspers/ | accessdate= 2006-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Szakolczai"&gt;{{cite book | first=Arpad | last=Szakolczai | year=2003 | title=The Genesis of Modernity | edition= First hardcover | publisher =Routledge | location=UK | isbn=0-415-25305-5 | pages=80–81 | url = https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415253055&amp;id=hGduSwFHFSEC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=Jaspers+%22Axial+Age%22+characteristics&amp;sig=O9S_5-pSxgMIPz8Ocn8RrgofkPU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "EoST"&gt;{{cite book | first=Arpad | last=Szakolczai | year=2006 | title=Encyclopedia of Social Theory | chapter = Historical sociology | publisher = Routledge | location=UK | isbn=0-415-29046-5|chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415290465&amp;id=LrBrWXtez8YC&amp;pg=PA251&amp;lpg=PA251&amp;vq=Axial+Age&amp;dq=%22The+Axial+Age:+The+Emergence+of+Transcendental+Visions+and+the+Rise+of+Clerics%22&amp;sig=g0mBSYAPnOEiXYGHR-j8hpuQPVM | page = 251}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shmuel Eisenstadt]] argues in the introduction to ''The Origins and Diversity of Axial Age Civilizations'' that Weber's work in his ''[[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism]]'', ''[[The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism]]'' and ''[[Ancient Judaism (book)|Ancient Judaism]]'' provided a background for the importance of the period, and notes parallels with [[Eric Voegelin]]'s ''Order and History''.&lt;ref name="Eisenstadt" /&gt; Wider acknowledgement of Jaspers' work came after it was presented at a conference and published in ''[[Daedalus (journal)|Dædalus]]'' in 1975, and Jaspers' suggestion that the period was uniquely transformative generated important discussion amongst other scholars, such as Johann Arnason.&lt;ref name = "EoST" /&gt; In literature, [[Gore Vidal]] in his novel [[Creation (novel)|''Creation'']] covers much of this Axial Age through the fictional perspective of a Persian adventurer.

[[Shmuel Eisenstadt]] analyses economic circumstances relating to the coming of the Axial Age in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WsUKbgh_A1YC|title=The Origins and Diversity of Axial Age Civilizations|publisher=SUNY Press|year=|isbn=9781438401942|series=SUNY series in Near Eastern Studies|location=|publication-date=2012|page=31|pages=|chapter=Introduction: The Axial Age Breakthrough in Ancient Greece|quote=The emergence of this specific type of Axial Age breakthrough was connected with the special mode of disintegration of the tribal communities and of construction of new collectivities and institutional complexes.

Religious historian [[Karen Armstrong]] explored the period in her ''The Great Transformation'',&lt;ref name= "Armstrong"&gt;{{cite book | first = Karen | last=Armstrong | authorlink=Karen Armstrong | year= 2006 | title= The Great Transformation: The Beginning of our Religious Traditions | edition=First | publisher=Knopf | location=New York | isbn= 0-676-97465-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the theory has been the focus of academic conferences.&lt;ref name="Conference"&gt;{{cite web|author=Strath, Bo |year=2005 |title=Axial Transformations |url=http://www.iue.it/Personal/Strath/Welcome.html?/Personal/Strath/archive/past_conferences/axialtrans.htm |accessdate=2006-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927233849/http://www.iue.it/Personal/Strath/Welcome.html?%2FPersonal%2FStrath%2Farchive%2Fpast_conferences%2Faxialtrans.htm |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Usage of the term has expanded beyond Jaspers' original formulation. Armstrong argues that the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] was a "Second Axial Age", including thinkers such as [[Isaac Newton]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[Albert Einstein]]. It has also been suggested that the [[modern era]] is a new axial age, wherein relationships between religion, secularity, and traditional thought are changing.&lt;ref name="modern"&gt;{{cite journal | first =Yves | last = Lambert | title= Religion in Modernity as a New Axial Age: Secularization or New Religious Forms? | journal=Sociology of Religion | year=1999 | volume=60 | issue= | pages= 303|url = https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=98493653 | doi= 10.2307/3711939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, '''celebrants''' are people who conduct formal ceremonies in the community, particularly weddings, which are the main ceremony of legal import conducted by celebrants. They may also conduct extra-legal ceremonies such as [[Naming ceremony|naming]] of babies, [[Wedding vow renewal ceremony|renewal of wedding vows]] and funerals. Officiating at a marriage requires that the celebrant be an authorised marriage celebrant under Australian law, but officiating at extra-legal ceremonies does not.

==Marriage celebrants==
{{See also|Marriage officiant}}
Many Western nations permit celebrants who are not clergy to carry out basic, legal, marriage ceremonies. However Australia was the first nation whose government appointed non-clergy celebrants with the specific intention that they would create ceremonies that might be as culturally enriching and, if required, as formal as church weddings, i.e. that these ceremonies would not be inferior in status to religious weddings.

An "authorised celebrant" is a person who is authorised (registered) by the [[Australian Government]] to perform legal marriages according to the [[Marriage Act 1961 (Australia)|Marriage Act 1961]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma196185/index.html MARRIAGE ACT 1961&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/bd/2001-02/02bd112.htm Marriage Amendment Bill 2002 Bills Digest 112 2001–02&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327122219/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/bd/2001-02/02bd112.htm |date=27 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The celebrant may be a representative of a [[religion|religious organisation]] (known as a religious marriage celebrant) or someone providing secular or non-religious weddings (known as a '''civil marriage celebrant'''). Only authorised (registered) marriage celebrants have the authority to perform marriages in Australia.

In 2017, 78 per cent of Australian marriages were performed by civil celebrants. However, the rate of civil marriages varied between states and territories, with a civil marriage rate of 86.6% in the Northern Territory, 83.6% in Tasmania, 81.7% in Western Australia, 81.2% in Queensland, 77.8% in South Australia, 77.3% in Victoria, 76.6% in the Australian Capital Territory and 75% in New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/3310.0Main+Features12017?OpenDocument|title=3310.0 - Marriages and Divorces, Australia, 2017 - Marriages |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=27 November 2018 |website= abs.gov.au |publisher= Australian Bureau of Statistics |access-date= 27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marriage by independent civil celebrant has spread in other English-speaking countries. Its early establishment in Australia was largely due to the support of the reforming Attorney-General [[Lionel Murphy]] in the 1970s.

==Descriptive definition==
A civil marriage celebrant is a private person authorised by the relevant government to perform legal civil marriages in a dignified and culturally acceptable manner, for those who do not choose a religious ceremony.

Civil celebrants also serve people who have religious beliefs but do not wish to be married in a church, temple or mosque. In contrast to the established ceremonies of religious or registry office authorities, in celebrant ceremonies many decisions about the content are chosen by the couple. Therefore, the civil celebrant has come to be defined as a professionally trained ceremony-provider who works in accordance with the wishes of the client couple. The task may be like an architect who is charged with designing a dream home for a couple who need expert help.&lt;ref name="Dally Messenger 2009"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.collegeofcelebrancy.com.au/Articles/keynote_afcc09.html|title=The Power of an Idea: the History of Celebrancy|accessdate=2012-12-30|publisher=International College of Celebrancy|year=2009|author=[[Dally Messenger]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense the celebrant is not just the one who performs the ceremony according to law, but its facilitator, the couple's adviser, the resource person, the co-creator of the ceremony, and the rehearsal-director.

Therefore, the celebrant does not come from the standpoint of belief or unbelief. Trained celebrants usually operate professionally on the principle that their own beliefs and values are irrelevant.&lt;ref name="Messenger, Dally. (2002)."&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.collegeofcelebrancy.com.au/Pages3/CelebrantAnyway.html|title=What is a Celebrant Anyway?|accessdate=2012-11-23|publisher=International College of Celebrancy|year=2002|author=[[Dally Messenger]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The 1960s in Australia was a decade of questioning established institutions and of profound social change.
*There was extreme dissatisfaction with the marriage "registry offices" of the time. Couples, who could not or would not use clerical celebrants, were humiliated by perfunctory and undignified ceremonies. The Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches, the major denominations of the time, discouraged or forbad remarriage of divorced people; and the offensively dismissive marriages offered by the state in registry offices often seemed designed to add to the distress of couples who were defying their own church's rules.&lt;ref name="Dally Messenger 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quote "The Catholic partner of a mixed marriage promises to do everything possible to preserve the faith and have all children of the marriage baptised and brought up in the Catholic Church." in the "Penny Catechism" (Catechism of Christian Doctrine)(1850–1970) – a summary doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church.{{Cite web|url=http://www.proecclesia.com/penny%20catechism/index.htm|title=A Catechism of Christian Doctrine|accessdate=2013-01-22|publisher=Incorporated Catholic Truth Society – London|year=|author=[[The Catholic Church]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*There was dissatisfaction with the main Catholic denominations of the time, especially the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches, predominantly with regard to the treatment of divorced persons and of those choosing partners of other denominations ("mixed marriages").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1042&amp;context=creartspapers|title=Not in front of the altar – Mixed marriages and sectarian tensions between Catholics and Protestants in pre-multicultural Australia|accessdate=2013-01-22|publisher=University of Wollongong-Faculty of Law, Humanities and the Arts|date=2009|author=S.A.McHugh}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*There were strong [and sometimes militant] objections to marriage and the marriage ceremony wording by feminists.&lt;ref&gt;A number of the feminist writers depicted marriage as a state oppressive to women e.g.Greer, Germaine, quoting Forum Vol 2, no.3, in The Female Eunuch, Paladin, London, 1971 p.199 :see also Segal, Iza, "The Immorality of Marriage", The Australian Humanist, December 1969, p.7: see also Norma Grieve and Ailsa Burns (eds), Australian Women-Contemporary Feminist Thought, Oxford University Press, Melbourne, 1994 p.282&lt;/ref&gt;

*Divorces, though common, were expensive, traumatic, and involved legal apportioning of blame. This indirectly tainted the institution of marriage.&lt;ref name="Messenger III 2012"&gt;Messenger III, Dally (2012), Murphy's Law and the Pursuit of Happiness: a History of the Civil Celebrant Movement, Spectrum Publications, Melbourne (Australia), {{ISBN|978-0-86786-169-3}} p.24ff&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of civil celebrancy in Australia==
[[File:Lois D'Arcy 1.png|thumb|by Lois D'Arcy|Mrs Lois D'Arcy was the first independent civil marriage celebrant ever appointed — by Attorney-General Lionel Murphy. Her appointment is dated 19 July 1973. This photo illustrates Murphy's radical move in appointing women into a hitherto male dominated profession, and his confidence in young people.

Civil celebrancy was established by the Australian Commonwealth Attorney General Lionel Murphy on 19 July 1973, when his first appointee, Mrs Lois D'Arcy, was categorised as a Civil Marriage Celebrant. Later, as civil marriage celebrants branched out into the performance of other ceremonies such as Funerals and Namings the term was shortened to Civil Celebrant.
According to civil celebrant [[Dally Messenger III]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The civil celebrant program is almost entirely the result of one man's vision. Murphy himself told me the story of how he was opposed by his own staff, the public service, his fellow members of parliament and officials of the Labour Party. He defied all, and, on July 19, 1973, in the dead of night, typed the first appointment himself, found the envelope and stamp, walked to a post box and posted it himself.&lt;ref name="Messenger, Dally. (2009)."&gt;{{cite speech |url= http://www.collegeofcelebrancy.com.au/Articles/keynote_afcc09.html |title= The Power of an Idea: The History of Celebrancy |event= Australian Federation of Civil Celebrants Conference |date= July 13, 2009 |accessdate= 2012-11-22 |publisher= International College of Celebrancy |author= [[Dally Messenger]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In fact the enabling legislation, the Marriage Act, had been passed in 1961 but Murphy's personal involvement in using the Act's powers and bypassing the bureaucracy made him a hero to the first civil celebrants. Lois D’Arcy, in a 1992 address to celebrants, recollected Murphy's own account of his authorising the first appointment:&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:First celebrant.jpg|thumb|alt=text|right|Mrs Lois D'Arcy, first independent civil marriage celebrant ever appointed by Attorney-General Lionel Murphy.

&lt;blockquote&gt;(Lionel had) returned to his office one evening. There he had taken a piece of paper with his letterhead, typed my authorisation, and then placed it in an envelope, which he then posted to me. What other person in such a high position would have done such a thing. No one other than Lionel Murphy!&lt;ref name="D’Arcy, Lois. (1992)."&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.collegeofcelebrancy.com.au/Articles/loisd'arcy1992.html |title= The Beginnings of Celebrancy |accessdate= 2012-11-22 |publisher= International College of Celebrancy |year=2009 |author= Lois D'Arcy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Murphy's stance on marriage reform (and on divorce reform) was part of wider desire to free Australians from restrictive laws. High Court Justice Michael Kirby remarked in 2000:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lionel Murphy was a big figure on the stage of Australian public life. He pursued with energy, imagination and determination a vision of Australian society which was not warped and gnarled and inward-looking. It was one which reached out to everyone, particularly the disadvantaged.&lt;ref&gt;as quoted in Hocking, Jenny, 1997, Lionel Murphy – a Political Biography, Cambridge, Cambridge UK (and the Bibliography found in Hocking J., 1997) {{ISBN|0521 79485 4}}, p.vi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;!-- WHAT TEXT ARE THE FOLLOWING REFS SUPPORTING? --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blackshield, A.R., Brown, D., Coper, M., and Krever, R.

==Lionel Murphy: radical achievements==
With regard to the marriage celebrant program – Dally Messenger III summarised Murphy’s achievement as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Lionel Murphy was a real radical. I am still amazed at his vision. He shocked the system.

*His first shock to the social system was the appointment of women—at a moment in history when, for hundreds of years, the only ceremony providers were men. (Paradoxically this Murphy decision is commonly acknowledged as having substantially supported the women in the churches who wished to become priests and bishops.)
*His second shock to the social system was the appointment of aborigines as civil celebrants. Faith Bandler, I recall, was one. (They had only been counted as humans in the census some six years before.)
*His third shock was the appointment of young people to do ceremonies. Lois D’Arcy was a 26 year old mother of two babies. Carol Ditchburn, now Astbury. was 24.
*His next shock was that citizens could choose their own celebrant—unheard of until then, both with church and with state.
*His next shock, a now obvious truth but still not fully absorbed, was his assertion that celebrating the milestones of life was just as important for secular people as it was for religious people.
*His overwhelming conviction was his belief that culture matters—really matters.&lt;ref name="Messenger, Dally. (2009)."/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Messenger and D'Arcy (opera.cit), the pioneer civil celebrants believed they were part of an innovative cultural challenge. They developed a deeper understanding of the purposes of ceremony, and believed celebrants should pursue excellence in every ceremony and in a variety of ceremonies.

To raise the general standard of civil ceremonies, given what they saw as the excessively legal cultural context they had inherited, they encouraged each couple to see more creative possibilities in the ceremony than the two of them might originally have envisaged. In this context the celebrant, as a resource person, needed to educate himself/herself in the artistic treasures of western culture appropriate for ceremony creation i.e. in poetry, prose, music, choreography, storytelling and symbolism i.e. the components of ceremony.

Since the Federal Government introduced celebrants in 1973, the appointment has been valid at any time, in any place anywhere in Australia. Up to 2013, the Marriage Celebrant Program has enabled over a million couples to be married in civil ceremonies. Celebrants were originally appointed based on geographic location and the perceived need for a celebrant in the area, but after 2003 their appointment was dependent on being a bureaucratically approved "fit and proper person".

==Celebrant civil ceremonies distinct from civil ceremonies of the past==
The Code of Practice, a section of the Regulations under the Marriage Act 1961, and to which celebrants are legally bound, requires that celebrants help provide a client-centred ceremony. It further recommends the following high standards of ceremonial preparation and delivery:

&lt;blockquote&gt;a marriage celebrant must recognise the social, cultural and legal significance of marriage and the marriage ceremony...

a marriage celebrant must maintain a high standard of service in his or her professional conduct and practice...

a marriage celebrant must respect the importance of the marriage ceremony to the parties and the other persons organising the ceremony...

give the parties information and guidance to enable them to choose or compose a marriage ceremony that will meet their needs and expectations...

If requested by the parties conduct a marriage ceremony rehearsal...

Ensure that his or her personal presentation is of an appropriate standard for the marriage ceremony, and respect the expectations of the parties in relation to the ceremony...

make efforts to ensure that the marriage ceremony is audible to all those present (using audio equipment, if required)...

arrive at the venue for the marriage ceremony no later than the time agreed with the parties...

ensure that the parties to each marriage receive a level of service that meets their separate and special requirements...

accept evaluative comment from the parties, and use any comments to improve performance...&lt;ref&gt;Attorney General's Department, Marriage Regulations 1963,  ''Code of Practice for Marriage Celebrants'', Canberra, Reprint 3 October 27, 2003, pp.122–123 {{ISBN|1920838155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This distinguishes the Australian Civil Marriage Celebrant and the countries which follow the Australian model, from previous experiences of civil marriage, or from pre-conceived notions, often held especially in the UK and the USA that a civil marriage must be short, dry legal and soul-less.

As is clear from the Australian Code of Practice quoted above, a couple can, and often do, require that their marriage ceremony have all the traditional structure, content, dress, choreography and flow of a formal church ceremony. And originally, civil celebrants were instructed that the readings, ideals, values, vows, music (lyrics) which are expressed, must be secular and non-religious. In April 1976 the Attorney's General's Department instructed civil celebrants as follows:-
&lt;blockquote&gt;All celebrants are urged to ensure that the ceremony they use is appropriate for a civil marriage. They are reminded that the service they provide is a secular alternative to religious services which are reserved for church marriages. It would be therefore be out of character for any religious significance to be given to the ceremony. For the same reasons, the conduct of a civil marriage in a church is not encouraged and, understandably, could be the subject of criticism by church authorities and the public generally.&lt;ref&gt;Attorney-Generals Department, Circular to all Private Persons authorised as Civil Marriage Celebrants, Canberra ACT, April 1976, p2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This admonition was repeated over ten years later (September 1986) in virtually the same words.&lt;ref&gt;Attorney-Generals Department, Information for Civil Marriage Celebrants, Canberra ACT, September 1986, p2&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Nine years later this instruction was partially modified, and after the changes of 2003, when the same authorisation applied to clergy from small churches and civil celebrants the lines became completely blurred.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dally Messenger III also claims that as the ceremony is either chosen or created by the couple, it can be affirmed as honest and authentic.&lt;ref&gt;Messenger III, Dally (1999), Ceremonies and Celebrations, Hachette -Livre Australia (Sydney), {{ISBN|978-0-7336-2317-2}} pp. 16ff&lt;/ref&gt;
Or to give an American perspective on marriage which illustrates a reformed view of civil marriage we need only quote the New Jersey civil marriage celebrant Gerald Fierst:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A wedding ceremony is a crossroad where two life stories intersect.

A wedding ceremony takes the two lives that the individuals have travelled and transforms them into a single path upon which each life embarks, starting over.

A wedding ceremony acknowledges the turning point, the choice to go on.

It's the setting off on life's journey together, with the experiences of the past as a guide into the future.

A wedding ceremony is a story which tells the past, proclaims the present, and blesses the future.&lt;ref&gt;Fierst, Gerald, The Heart of the Wedding, Parkhurst Brothers, Chicago, 2011, {{ISBN|978-1-935166-22-1}} p.76ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cant, Sally, The Heart and Soul of Celebrancy – A Guide to Creating Memorable Ceremonies, Pennon Publishing, Melbourne 2009 {{ISBN|978-1-920997-13-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Gramberg, Ruth, The Practical Handbook for Celebrants to Welcome Celebrate and Farewell, Longueville Books, Woollahra (Australian Marriage Celebrants Inc), 2011, {{ISBN|978-0987066-0-84}} p.66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Or in the words of Author and Celebrant Wendy Haynes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When it comes down to it, the jewel in the crown is the wedding ceremony... The purpose of the book is to inspire you, to give you ideas so you can shape the ceremony to fit your life and your commitment to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Haynes Wendy, Create Your Own Inspiring Wedding Ceremony, Wendy Haynes, Coffs Harbour, 2005, {{ISBN|0-9757338-0-X}} pp.1ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Celebrant organisations==
Lionel Murphy himself founded the first celebrant organisation on 3 May 1974. He called all the celebrants he had appointed to that date to his office in Sydney. He explained to the celebrants who were present that the Labor Party was sure to lose the coming election. Celebrants would need an organisation so that they could speak with one voice, especially if their very existence was threatened by a Conservative (Liberal) Government. He appointed a well-known model Jill-Ellen Fuller as the inaugural President of the Australian Civil Marriage Celebrants Association (ACMCA). He placed his own personal secretary Maureen Barron as temporary secretary but soon officially appointed Dally Messenger III.&lt;ref&gt;Messenger III, Dally (2012), Murphy’s Law and the Pursuit of Happiness: a History of the Civil Celebrant Movement, Spectrum Publications, Melbourne (Australia), {{ISBN|978-0-86786-169-3}}, p57&lt;/ref&gt;

(A separate organisation for Funeral Celebrants, the Association of Civil Funeral Celebrants, was formed on 3 May 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Messenger III, Dally (2012), Murphy's Law and the Pursuit of Happiness: a History of the Civil Celebrant Movement, Spectrum Publications, Melbourne (Australia), {{ISBN|978-0-86786-169-3}}, p159&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[File:Dally messenger iii.jpg|thumb|Dally Messenger III is an acknowledged leader in the Civil Celebrant Program in Australia, New Zealand and the USA. He has written two influential books, one on secular ceremonies and another on the history of celebrancy. cf. reference 11 &amp; 25.]]
Apart from survival, the main activities of the ACMCA became to deal with the media, and to distribute and share (by mail) resources among the celebrants i.e. poems and quotations, for use in ceremonies.

Murphy exempted every civil celebrant from Section 45 of the Australian federal Marriage Act 1961. This is a legal "warning" or ''[[monitum]]'' to the couple. Murphy believed the words to be sexist and inauthentic – i.e. wrong for not admitting the high rate of divorce.

After several years the ACMCA broke up into state organisations. Other organisations such as the Australian Federation of Civil Celebrants formed (28 January 1994) which admitted marriage, funeral and naming celebrants.&lt;ref&gt;Messenger III, Dally (2012), Murphy’s Law and the Pursuit of Happiness: a History of the Civil Celebrant Movement, Spectrum Publications, Melbourne (Australia), {{ISBN|978-0-86786-169-3}}, p207&lt;/ref&gt;

==The fixed-fee period: 1974–1995==
Despite a number of difficulties and problems, the civil celebrant program turned out to be hugely popular with the general public.
From 1973 to 1995, civil marriages by independent celebrants went from 2.92% of total marriages to 38.5% in 1996.(If one includes Total Civil Marriages i.e. includes civil marriages performed by government "Registry Office" officials, total civil marriages went from 17.92% in 1974 to 46.7% in 1996&lt;ref&gt;Australian Bureau of Statistics, Year Book of Australia 1996, AGPS, Canberra. 1997 p.151 and Australian Bureau of Statistics, 1996 Marriages and Divorces Australia, Cat.No.3310.0, 1997, ABS, Canberra&lt;/ref&gt;
The main problem was the fixed fee which, strictly interpreted by Attorney-General’s Department ultimately led to a serious decline in standards from which the program has never fully recovered.&lt;ref&gt;An example of these declining standards there were many news reports e.g. The Sunday Observer (Melbourne),, 13 January 1980, ''Bride and Groom "Jilted" by celebrant''&lt;/ref&gt; Once the pioneer celebrants became diluted with new appointments idealism was only sustained by the minority. Attitudes developed with many celebrants which turned out to be very destructive. Realising they received the same remuneration if they spent time and care in the preparation of a marriage, or if they did not, many provided the absolute minimum for the marrying couple. To make matters worse, the fixed fee, in a period of high inflation, declined in value, which further exacerbated the problem.

Many good celebrants were forced out of the field due to the low remuneration. In the context of the fixed fee, those who stayed practising marriage celebrants did far too many marriages to earn enough remuneration for their personal needs.
Despite Lionel Murphy’s clear declarations to the contrary, some powerful public servants began to classify the office of marriage celebrant as a "community service" which led to a further deterioration of professional standards.

Says Messenger: &lt;blockquote&gt;''… the public service and the government had all but destroyed the Civil Marriage Celebrant Program by freezing the fee, forcing down standards and frustrating the good celebrants out of the business.''&lt;ref&gt;Messenger III, Dally (2012), Murphy’s Law and the Pursuit of Happiness: a History of the Civil Celebrant Movement, Spectrum Publications, Melbourne (Australia), {{ISBN|978-0-86786-169-3}} Chapter 42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite these debilitating policy initiatives, a minority core of celebrants sustained high standards. The program continued to progress and, at the end of 1995, was very close to becoming the mainstream procedure of contracting marriage.

==Deregulation period: 1995–2003==
According to Messenger&lt;ref&gt;Messenger, Dally (2012), ''Murphy's Law and the Pursuit of Happiness: a History of the Civil Celebrant Movement'', Spectrum Publications, Melbourne (Australia), {{ISBN|978-0-86786-169-3}}, Chapters 43–48&lt;/ref&gt; the period from 1995 to 2003 is recorded as being the most happily productive of the Civil Celebrant Movement in Australia.

Funeral and Naming ceremonies, originally opposed by the majority of celebrants and the Attorney-General's Department, had gradually and imperceptibly become accepted. A group of celebrants under the leadership of Rick Barclay, a successful Funeral and Marriage Celebrant, had morphed the original Funeral Celebrants Association of Australia into an organisation which accepted all ceremonies and celebrants into an inclusive association titled The Institute of Australian Celebrants.

Kathleen Hurley, an active member of the Institute, persuaded Dally Messenger III to become more deeply involved. Other activists at this time included Ken Woodburn, Lyn Knorr, Beverley Silvius, Gavan Grosser, Cavell Ferrier and Brian and Tina McInerney. As a group, they decided to escalate the profile of the Institute and take a lead in bringing all celebrants together.  They also devised a plan for regular meetings and conferences to encourage co-operation, professional development, and to focus on a deeper understanding of the role of the celebrant in society.&lt;ref&gt;Newsletter of the Australian Federation of Civil Celebrants, No. 01 to No 14. 29 March 1994, to 1 January 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Their most important decision was to mount a political and media campaign to abolish the fixed fee, perceived as the cause of the lowest standards since the program was established. With these ends, on 28 January. 1994, the institute became a national organisation, the Australian Federation of Civil Celebrants Inc.

Before challenging government, they campaigned for more members and organised a series meetings and seminars. Shortly after, on 28 March 1994 Dally Messenger, the president of the Australian Federation of Civil Celebrants joined with Robert Ross, secretary of the Association of Civil Marriage Celebrants of Victoria in a meeting with the Honorable Peter Duncan, the assistant minister in charge of celebrants, and asked him for the deregulation of the fee for marriages, and a number of other reforms.

Duncan, after several months of correspondence,  responded negatively by appointing 1000 extra celebrants.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, Catherine, ''Sunday Herald Sun'', 5 Feb 1995, ''Warning Bells in 'glut' of Celebrants'', and ''Newsletter of the Australian Federation of Civil Celebrants'', No. 01 to No 14. 29 March 1994, to 1 January 1996&lt;/ref&gt; This provocative action galvanised all eleven celebrant organisations to challenge the government via the media.
With the assistance of leading constitutional lawyer, Professor Michael Pryles, and the abovementioned media publicity, the government responded.
The fixed fee was de-regulated on 1 July 1995. On 29 &amp; 30 August 1995 the federal government invited representatives of all eleven celebrant organisations to a meeting in Canberra — the National Council of Celebrants. More importantly, a search conference, initiated by public servant, Helen Eastburn,  was set up to establish Competency Standards under Jan Wallbridge and Jennifer Rivers of the Canberra Institute of Technology. This occurred on 29 and 30 August 1995 and was followed through and refined in intense correspondence and phone calls to everyone concerned in the weeks following.

A watershed of development and possibly symbolically expressing the most profound maturing within the celebrant movement were the series of conferences held at Pallotti College, Millgrove, northeast of Melbourne from 1994 to 1999. The committee of the Australian Federation of Civil Celebrants decided that the Conferences should explore the nature of celebrancy itself and focus primarily on ceremony and ritual in society.&lt;ref&gt;Celebrations, Australian Federation of Civil Celebrants, No. 15 to No.40, January 1996 to June 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Review of 2003: 2003–2013==
[[File:Four streams of weddings in Australia.png|600px|thumb|alt=text|left|Graph tracing the success of the civil marriage celebrant program in Australia from 1969 to 2004.Sometime in 1998 Civil weddings became more than 50% of all weddings performed in Australia.]]Thirty years later, following an extensive review and the introduction of reforms by the federal [[Attorney-General of Australia|Attorney-General]] Daryl Williams, the marriage celebrant system changed. 
Williams promised a new structure and summarised his intentions as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* quality training for celebrants
* a careful selection process for the appointment of marriage celebrants
* a balancing of the number of celebrants appointed
* a Code of Practice which required careful attention to couples and their ceremonial needs
* precise attention to the requirements of laws and procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Messenger III, Dally (2012), Murphy’s Law and the Pursuit of Happiness: a History of the Civil Celebrant Movement, Spectrum Publications, Melbourne (Australia), {{ISBN|978-0-86786-169-3}} p.272&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since September 2003, prospective marriage celebrants have had to undergo Government-approved, accredited training in marriage celebrancy, and meet specific criteria set by the Attorney-General's Department to be declared a "fit and proper person" to hold the office of "marriage celebrant".

In this same month a series of legal and administrative changes to the civil celebrant program were put into effect by the Australian Government. Attorney-General Daryl Williams, who left the Australian Parliament in mid-term had, just before he resigned, approved a number of radical changes to the Marriage Act and the Regulations under the Act (Section 39 as it was, and after 2003). The most important of these was the legal transfer of powers over the program from the Attorney-General to an appointed public servant titled "The Registrar".&lt;ref&gt;from 1961 to 2003, Section 39 (2) of the Marriage Act read simply as follows : "''The Minister may, by instrument in writing, authorise … other fit and proper persons to solemnize marriages''." cf. Marriage Act 1961 as found in Handbook for Marriage Celebrants, Attorney General’s Department, Australian Government Publishing Services, Canberra, 1992. When the powers were transferred to the Registrar (public servant), several pages were added to the Act specifying those powers in detail; i.e., "Section 39 A to M" as found in ''The Marriage Act 1961'', Reprint 5, Attorney General’s Department, Canberra, 2003, {{ISBN|1-920838-16-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;).

The program, from its beginnings in 1973 had always been referred to as the "Civil Celebrant Program". Under the 2003 changes, all civil celebrant appointments were cancelled, and all civil celebrants to this point were re-appointed by the Registrar, in the same category as clergy of small churches, as "Commonwealth Authorised Celebrants".&lt;ref&gt;Section 39 of ''The Marriage Act 1961'', Reprint 5, Attorney General’s Department, Canberra, 2003, {{ISBN|1-920838-16-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

New appointments were usually authorised by the Registrar after passing one Unit of Competency, of a since substantially discredited educational system of Nationally Authorised Training.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Sophie Cuttriss, ''The Age'', Melbourne, 12 August 2011; Australian Broadcasting Commission, 7:30 Report (TV), of 7 August 2012, 8 August 2012, 9 August 2012 and 5 September 2012; and Peter Crocker, Mary Colrain, Jeff Larson, and Sue McKerracher in ''The Age'' (Melbourne) Letters, 17 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

With a pass in this Unit&lt;ref&gt;Unit of Competency, CHCMCEL401A, ''Plan, Conduct, and Review a Marriage Ceremony''&lt;/ref&gt; certified by any Registered Training Organisation, on application to the Registrar, providing the applicant paid attention to the details of the written application, appointment as a Commonwealth Authorised Celebrant was more or less automatic, with the occasional exception.

This system led to a proliferation of celebrants and excessive competition.  It also led to a lowering of standards. In 2010, Melbourne journalist Mark Russell noted:
&lt;blockquote&gt; There are thousands of (rookie marriage celebrants) trying to undercut each other in the race down the aisle. Since federal laws were introduced seven years ago dispensing with the policy of appointing celebrants on a needs-only basis ... the number of Celebrants has tripled to more than 10,000 ...

many have inadequate training... The number of nuptial nightmares is soaring ... horror stories abound ... inexperienced celebrants have been accused of ruining wedding days because they don't know what they are doing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Russell |first=Mark |url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/disaster-weddings-you-cant-blame-it-all-on-the-inlaws-20100619-yo2m.html |title=Disaster Weddings: You can't blame it all on the in-laws |newspaper=The Age |location= Melbourne |date=20 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The article goes on to list the disastrous experience of many wedding days, the inadequacy of celebrant training, unpredictable cancellations by celebrants, the lowering of planning and rehearsing standards, the indignity of some celebrant advertising material and the "savage" over-competition.

On 15 January 2012, in an open letter to Attorney-General Nicola Roxon, nine senior celebrants protested their grievances at the deterioration of the program in which they had formerly felt pride and achievement. They listed:-
* The downgrading of status by the legal transfer of ministerial authority to a public servant.
* The setback to the high cultural standards they had worked for years to attain.
* The loss of identity in legally excluding the title "civil celebrant".
* The confusion of the general public as to who was a "religious" celebrant and who was not.
* The disrespect shown by the Registrar – especially to those who pioneered the program.
* The excessive number of celebrants and the consequent lowering of standards.

They recommended a policy based on the following principles.
*quality training for celebrants,
*a careful selection process for the appointment of marriage celebrants,
*a balancing of the number of celebrants appointed, and a
*Code of Practice which requires careful attention to couples (and other clients) and their ceremonial needs, and
*precise and correct attention to the requirements of laws and procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.collegeofcelebrancy.com.au/pages4/roxonopenltr4.html |title= General Template |publisher= Collegeofcelebrancy.com.au |accessdate= 13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistics===
Until 2004 the Commonwealth Statistician (ABS-ref) customarily gave statistics for the
* Number of civil marriages by government registry offices
* Number of marriages performed by Independent civil marriage celebrants.
* Number of marriages by each of the major churches and religions.
* Number of marriages by smaller denominations (total).
After 2004 many of these statistics were discontinued. Statistics for the total number and proportion of religious and civil marriages are still published each year, but they do not distinguish between marriages conducted by registry office officials and those conducted by independent marriage celebrants. Similarly, statistics of religious marriages only give separate figures for the two largest denominations, Roman Catholics and Anglicans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=3310.0 - Marriages and Divorces, Australia, 2014 |url= http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/3310.0Main+Features12014?OpenDocument |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= www.abs.gov.au |publisher= Australian Bureau of Statistics |access-date=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebrant training and education==
Until 1994, Celebrant Training was mainly achieved by informal but effective mentoring of new celebrants by the more experienced. This was augmented by seminars and conferences organised by the main celebrant organisations. Significant progress in understanding of the celebrant role was achieved at the annual "Pallotti" live-in conferences which took place at Warburton in Victoria from 1994 to 1999. International lecturers included Mary Hancock from New Zealand and David Oldfield from [[Washington DC]] in the US.
[[File:Mary Hancock.jpeg|thumb|Mary Hancock, Pioneer New Zealand Civil Celebrant (New Zealand adopted the Australian Model). Mary Hancock established the first training course for civil celebrants in the world in Auckland New Zealand (ca.1994).]] In 1994, the first formal training course for civil celebrants ever established, was created by pioneer civil celebrant Mary Hancock in Auckland, New Zealand. Shortly after, in Australia,  the International College of Celebrancy courses were established by Dally Messenger III.&lt;ref&gt;Messenger, Dally, Murphy's Law, ''op cit.'' pp. 231-259.&lt;/ref&gt;
After the changes of 2003, the Australian Government encouraged Registered Training Organisations to teach celebrancy, a system which was open to exploitation by unethical operators and which for civil celebrants, and for many other vocational training courses, proved disastrous.&lt;ref&gt;Tomazin, Farrah, "Skills Training Hits Bottom". ''The Age'' (front page story), Melbourne, 5 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Registration==
Registration provides the legal authority to practice as a marriage celebrant and a four-digit or five-digit alpha-numeric registration number. Once registered (or authorised as it is also known), the marriage celebrant can marry couples in virtually any location (e.g. reception centre "chapels", other de-consecrated chapels and churches, historic buildings, galleries, private homes, parks and gardens, beaches, headlands, boats etc.) and at any time of the day or night. The celebrant is responsible for processing and lodging all legal paperwork to register the marriage in accordance with defined procedures. This gives the Australian Civil Marriage Celebrant more status than they enjoy in other western countries, but also additional legal responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Messenger, Dally (1999), Ceremonies and Celebrations, Hachette -Livre Australia (Sydney),  {{ISBN|978-0-7336-2317-2}}. p.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Messenger, Dally (2012). ''Murphy’s Law and the Pursuit of Happiness: a History of the Civil Celebrant Movement''. Spectrum Publications, Melbourne (Australia), {{ISBN|978-0-86786-169-3}}. pp.199–205&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funeral and general celebrants==
From 1975 a defined group of marriage and non-marriage celebrants declared themselves as [[Funeral Celebrants (Civil)|Funeral Celebrants]].  Many celebrants who are currently awaiting appointment as marriage celebrants and who cannot yet perform marriage ceremonies are practising as general celebrants in the community. Authorised marriage celebrants also frequently offer general celebrant services; but since these services are extra-legal, they may also be conducted on an ad hoc basis by untrained people.

General celebrants perform a range of different extra-legal ceremonies including naming (namegiving) ceremonies;&lt;ref&gt;Haynes, Wendy, How to Create an Inspiring Naming Ceremony, Boolarong Press, Salisbury-Brisbane-Australia, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0975733-83-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; funerals; renewal of wedding vows; [[anniversaries]]; significant birthday celebrations; commitment ceremonies for [[homosexual|same-sex]] couples who are currently forbidden to marry under Australian law, or for heterosexual couples who cannot marry for personal, financial, religious or legal reasons; memorials and or scattering of ashes ceremonies; boat-naming ceremonies; dedication of new home or office ceremonies; graduation ceremonies; [[naturalisation]] (citizenship) ceremonies; becoming a teenager ([[coming of age]]) and other ceremonies.

{{Criticism of religion sidebar}}
[[Sikhism]] has been criticized in one way or another by proponents of other theories. These critics include both Sikhs and non-Sikhs under different motives. These criticisms extend across a large portion of the beliefs and practices of Sikhism and even question the authenticity of the origin of the faith. As a result, Sikhs continue to face discrimination due to their presence and past activities.

==Theology==
Scholar [[W H McLeod|William Hewat McLeod]] cited the tension between the doctrine of God's [[Transcendence (religion)#Sikhism|transcendence]] in Sikhism and a supposed ability of God to communicate with people. McLeod says Sikh thinkers have been unable to give a convincing account of how God can communicate with people at all if this being is indeed transcendent.&lt;ref&gt;Mandair, A.-P. S., ''Religion and the Specter of the West'' ([[Columbia University Press]], 2009), p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; Although, this is what makes Sikh teachings different from other schools of thought i.e., that God is transcendental, formless and infinite but still can communicate to people as if a physical being.

Hindu leader [[Dayanand Saraswati]], in his book ''[[Satyarth Prakash]]'', criticized [[Sikhism]], describing [[Guru Nanak]] as a "rogue",&lt;ref&gt;"Reduced to Ashes: The Insurgency and Human Rights in Punjab ..., Volume 1", p.16&lt;/ref&gt; the hymns of the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] as falsehood, and Sikhism as a snare to rob and cheat simple folk of their wealth and property. A Sikh wrote a response, to which Dayanand Saraswati answered that his opinion had undergone a change when he visited [[Punjab]], and the remarks about Sikhism would be deleted in the subsequent edition of his work. However, these remarks were never removed after the untimely death of Dayanand Saraswati, and later editions of ''Satyarth Prakash'' were even more critical of Sikhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sikhinstitute.org/jan_2007/3-gansi.htm|title=Institute of Sikh Studies, Chandigarh|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious text===
[[File:Guru Granth Sahib Sikh scripture with Chauri on the left.jpg|thumb|Guru Granth Sahib being read.]]
[[Ernest Trumpp]] had concluded that [[Guru Granth Sahib|Adi Granth]] was not worth translating in full--"the same few ideas, he thought, being endlessly repeated," and referring to the heterogeneous language (mostly Sadhukkadi or Saint's tongue, a mixture of Indian dialects, used by saints to preach in North India)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guru Granth Sahib|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=esp. Kabir, Ravidas and most of Nanak's Shlokas}}&lt;/ref&gt; that consisted of various dialects, he described the text as "incoherent and shallow in the extreme, and couched at the same time in dark and perplexing language, in order to cover these defects. It is for us Occidentals a most painful and almost stupefying task, to read only a single Rag."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tony Ballantyne|title=Between Colonialism and Diaspora: Sikh Cultural Formations in an Imperial World|date=26 Jul 2006|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822388111|pages=52–3}}&lt;!--|accessdate=1 September 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Even for Sikhs the language of the Guru Granth Sahib is considered archaic and hard to understand without an interpreter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=S.

Regarding the [[Dasam Granth]], the second scripture of Sikhs written by the 10th [[Guru Gobind Singh]], there is much controversy among Sikh scholars regarding its authorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robin Rinehart|title=Debating the Dasam Granth|date=5 Jan 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199842476|page=8}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 September 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh|author2=Louis E.

===Monotheism===
Sikhism defines the concept of one God as [[Ik Onkar|Ek Onkar]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/god/sikhismrev2.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sikhs in Europe: Migration, Identities and Representations|page=101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y3v3t9bjPAcC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;dq=sikhism+gurus+onkar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=D3NXUu3LOMXUrQe6pICQBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=sikhism%20gurus%20onkar&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the concept of [[monotheism]] was already taught in the [[Vedas]],&lt;ref&gt;"Divine Message Of God To Mankind Vedas" by J.M. Mehta, Chapter '12. Worship of God'.&lt;/ref&gt; other later scriptures such as [[Bhagavad Gita]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zaehner|first=Robert Charles|title=The Bhagavad-Gita|page=141|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nY6PRhqdlJsC&amp;pg=PA141}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Torah]],&lt;ref&gt;"Modern Scholarship in the Study of Torah", p.165, by Shalom Carmy&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quran]],&lt;ref&gt;"One God in One Man" By C. T. Benedict, page.179&lt;/ref&gt; that came about long before the religion of Sikhism. However, it has been suggested that Sikhism's monotheism differs from other religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelemen|first=Lawrence Charles|title=Permission to Receive: Four Rational Approaches to the Torah's Divine Origin|page=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YOHpUbHCY_cC&amp;pg=PA27}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ernest Trumpp]], the Sikh [[God in Sikhism|theology of God]] is "far closer in conception to the [[pantheistic]] traditions of Hinduism than the monotheistic perspective of Christianity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh|author2=Louis E.

Guru Nanak opposed [[polytheistic]] practices. According to a legend, Nanak during his trip to [[Mecca]] had debate with [[mullahs]] of Mecca, in his debate, Nanak had asserted that the [[Kaaba]] was only a black stone, which is [[Lingam]], of Lord [[Shiva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Needham Cust|first=Robert|title=Linguistic and Oriental Essays|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t_AIAAAAQAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However it has been alleged that later gurus of Sikhism added the practices that can be linked with polytheism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pruthi|first=Raj|title=Sikhism and Indian Civilization|page=16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KxndvJs3wUkC&amp;pg=PA16}}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably waving fans over Guru Granth Sahib during worship.&lt;ref&gt;"The Guru Granth Sahib and Sikhism", p. 28, by Anita Ganeri&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Hindu Religion: Customs and Manners; Describing the Customs and Manners, Religious, Social and Domestic Life, Arts and Sciences of the Hindus", p. 78, by Paul Thomas&lt;/ref&gt; Sikhism also permits the veneration and [[Intercession of saints]] (such as to the Sikh martyr [http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Bhai_Maharaj_Singh%20Bhai Bhai Maharaj Singh]) and views its Gurus as the "embodiment of Divine Light" and "Divine in Spirit",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concept of Guru|url=http://searchsikhism.com/concept-of-guru|website=Search Sikhism|accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are seen by some religious groups as forms of polytheism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rajesh Rai|author2=Peter Reeves|title=The South Asian Diaspora: Transnational Networks and Changing Identities|date=25 Jul 2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134105953|page=188}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 September 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kelly Pemberton|author2=Michael Nijhawan|title=Shared Idioms, Sacred Symbols, and the Articulation of Identities in South Asia|date=25 Oct 2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135904777|pages=143, 161}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 September 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syncretism===
{{see also|Islam and Sikhism|Hinduism and Sikhism}}

One view of Sikhism is that it is a [[syncretism]] of Hinduism (particularly the [[Bhakti]] movement) and Islam (particularly [[Sufism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Propositional Religions 5 - Sikhism|url=http://www.biblestudying.net/mysticism5.html|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Flawed Definitions of Sikhism|url=http://www.sikhcoalition.org/flawed-definitions-of-sikhism|website=THE SIKH COALITION|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of the Sikhs|last=Singh|first=Khushwant|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), having evolved from Hinduism in the context of a multiplicity of syncretic movements in [[Medieval India]], while taking the idea of monotheism from Islam,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roger Griffin|authorlink1=Roger Griffin|title=Terrorist's Creed: Fanatical Violence and the Human Need for Meaning|date=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137284723|edition=illustrated|quote=By hybridizing Hinduism - particularly elements of Vaishnavism with its stress on active devotion ('bhakti') - with Islam - especially its monotheism and Sufi mystic tradition - a new monotheistic religion was born...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Shashi Tharoor|title=[[India: From Midnight to the Millennium]]|date=2006|publisher=Arcade Publishing|isbn=9781559708036|page=368|edition=reprint, revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John McCannon|title=AP World History, 6th ed.|date=2014|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|isbn=9781438092669|quote=While many consider Sikhism to have emerged as an independent tradition, it is categorized by others as a syncretic faith, joining certain aspects of Hindu theology with the monotheism associated with Islam.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Holm|editor1-first=Jean|editor2-last=Bowker|editor2-first=John|title=Picturing God|date=1994|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781441120311|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the incorporation of selected hymns from Hindu and Muslim saints (such as [[Kabir]], [[Fariduddin Ganjshakar]] and other [[Bhagat]]) into the [[Guru Granth Sahib]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; This view was commonly believed, but is outdated within scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Dhanjal, B., "Sikhism" in Holm &amp; Bowker (eds.), ''Picturing God'' ([[Continuum International Publishing Group|Continuum]], 1994), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to [[Harjot Oberoi]], until the 19th century the Sikhs had shown "little collective interest in distinguishing themselves from the Hindus" and "Sikh notions of time, space, corporality, holiness, kinship, social distinctions, purity and pollution and commensality were hardly different from those of the Hindus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Girja Kumar|title=The Book on Trial: Fundamentalism and Censorship in India|date=1 Jan 1997|publisher=Har-Anand Publications|isbn=9788124105252|page=385}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 September 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Sikh belief in [[Reincarnation]] is also often used as proof of the syncretic influence of Hinduism on Sikhism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Q: What happens after death?|url=http://www.realsikhism.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1248308791&amp;ucat=7|website=RealSikhism|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Douglas A.

===Ban on hair removal===
The cutting or removal of hair from any body part (including nose hair, ear hair, facial hair and pubic hair)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Scott Lowe|title=Hair|date=2016|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|isbn=9781628922219|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; is strictly [[Prohibitions in Sikhism|forbidden for Sikhs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Khushwant Singh|authorlink1=Khushwant Singh|title=[[Truth, Love &amp; a Little Malice|Truth, Love and a Little Malice: An Autobiography]]|date=2003|publisher=Penguin Books India|isbn=9780143029571|page=369|edition=reprint, revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; This growing of ones hair is known as [[Kesh (Sikhism)|Kesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Lalita Clozel|title=U.S. Sikhs say military's ban on long hair and beards keeps them out|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2014/apr/13/nation/la-na-military-sikhs-20140414|accessdate=1 September 2014|work=Los Angeles Times|date=April 13, 2014|quote=The turban, hair and beard date from the 17th century, when the last living Sikh Guru, Gobind Singh, decided that followers should allow their hair to grow as a sign of respect for God, known as Kesh.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the practice is a common source of criticism and questioning of Sikhism, including the belief that not cutting ones hair will cause it to grow to unacceptably long lengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Q: Why do Sikhs keep hair?|url=http://www.realsikhism.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1248364871&amp;ucat=7|website=RealSikhism|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Non-[[Amrit Sanchar|amritdhari]] young women, especially, often express criticism of the forbiddance to cut hair as being too demanding and restrictive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Gallo|editor1-first=Ester|title=Migration and Religion in Europe: Comparative Perspectives on South Asian Experiences|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317096375|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnoreligious group===
Sikhism has been criticised for the perception that it is an [[ethnoreligious group]], which has seemingly very limited appeal and following beyond those claiming ancestry from the [[Indian subcontinent]] — especially the [[Punjab region]] and its surrounds, such as among the [[Jat Sikh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=J.

There is a history of tension between Sikhism and Islam. This goes back to the persecution of Sikhs by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperors in India, but has manifested in more recent distrust between the communities in the UK, including hostility to inter-community romantic relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hundal|first=Sunny|title=Sikhs v Muslims: why the debate on grooming isn’t about the women themselves|url=http://liberalconspiracy.org/2013/09/12/sikhs-v-muslims-why-the-debate-on-grooming-isnt-about-the-women-themselves/|work=Liberal Conspiracy|accessdate=9 October 2013|date=September 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 1947 [[Partition of India]] promises of a Sikh majority state were outlined, however following the divide of India and the creation of Pakistan, renegation on such promises was the approach taken by the Indian government of the time. Following this, the actions occurring in [[Operation Blue Star]] which were seen as atrocities by Sikhs, led to worldwide protests and renewed demands for a separate nation as was previously promised, they called it "[[Khalistan movement]]", during this movement, some Sikhs had been involved in retaliatory-terrorism, the most well-known incident being [[Air India Flight 182]], in which 268 Canadian citizens died. Many of the Sikh groups were [[Khalistan movement#Khalistan militant outfits|banned]] from the numerous countries, who had been convicted with terrorist activities. Due to such negative impact, the support for [[Khalistan Movement]] has been commonly regarded as act of terrorism, many have been arrested for affirming support for the movement.&lt;ref&gt;"Congressional Record, V. 152, PT. 17, November 9, 2006 to December 6, 2006", p. 606&lt;/ref&gt;

The present situation in Punjab is usually regarded as a cautionary tension with elements of peace; and the militant movement (Khalistan) has been weakened.

In 2004, [[France]] had passed the [[French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools|law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools]], which banned many religious signs in schools. This ban most notably included [[Dastar|turbans]], a religious garment and central characteristic of Sikh religious code and practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16547479|title=UN human rights body backs French Sikhs on turbans|work=BBC News|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the number of Sikhs in France is a small minority, the French education minister claimed ignorance of the consequences such an act would have for the Sikh population residing in France. This law led to Sikhs protesting against the law across [[Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3448239.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - Sikhs protest against French ban|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[India]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-02-16/india/37132455_1_french-turban-ban-sikh-children-ban-on-religious-symbols|title=India News, Latest Sports, Bollywood, World, Business &amp; Politics News - Times of India|work=The Times of India|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other regions. This issue is heatedly debated as exploitation of secularism appears to infringe on the universal right and principal - freedom of expression.

{{Zoroastrianism}}
{{Lead too short|date=September 2016}}
'''Criticism of [[Zoroastrianism]]''' has taken place over many centuries not only from the adherents of other religions but also among Zoroastrians themselves seeking to reform the faith.

==Zoroaster==
In the early 19th century, a Christian missionary based in [[British India]], [[John Wilson (missionary)|John Wilson]], claimed that [[Zoroaster]] never had a genuine divine commission (or ever claimed such a role),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Sharma|editor1-first=Suresh K.|editor2-last=Sharma|editor2-first=Usha|title=Cultural and Religious Heritage of India: Zoroastrianism|date=2004|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=9788170999621|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; never performed miracles, or uttered prophecies and that the story of his life is "a mere tissue of comparatively modern fables and fiction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jenny Rose|title=Zoroastrianism: An Introduction|date=2 Apr 2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857719713|pages=206–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Stausberg|editor1-first=Michael|editor2-last=Vevaina|editor2-first=Yuhan Sohrab-Dinshaw|title=The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Zoroastrianism|date=23 Mar 2015|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118785508|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others assert that all the available Zoroastrian sources regarding Zoroaster only provide conflicting images about him,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=S. Nigosian|title=Zoroastrian Faith: Tradition and Modern Research|date=24 Sep 1993|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|isbn=9780773564381|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially between earlier and later sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Sharma|editor1-first=Suresh K.|editor2-last=Sharma|editor2-first=Usha|title=Cultural and Religious Heritage of India: Zoroastrianism|date=2004|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=9788170999621|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
The [[Dasatir-i-Asmani]], while being accepted by Zoroastrian communities in Iran and India as genuine, especially by the [[Kadmi]], it is generally believed to be a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jenny Rose|title=Zoroastrianism: An Introduction|date=2 Apr 2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857719713|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson argued that the [[Avesta]] could not be divinely inspired because much of its text was irrevocably lost or unintelligible&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jenny Rose|title=Zoroastrianism: An Introduction|date=2 Apr 2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857719713|pages=205–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kenneth Boa|title=Cults, World Religions and the Occult|date=1990|publisher=David C Cook|isbn=9780896938236|page=48|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Martin Haug]], who greatly helped the Parsis of India to defend their religion against the attacks of such Christian missionaries as Wilson, considered the [[Gathas]] to be the only texts and only authoritative scriptures that could be attributed to Zoroaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jenny Rose|title=Zoroastrianism: An Introduction|date=2 Apr 2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857719713|pages=207–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polytheism==
John Wilson attacked the Zoroastrian reverence of the [[Amesha Spenta]] and [[Yazata]]s as a form of [[polytheism]], although the Parsis at the time immediately refuted this allegation and insisted that he had in fact addressed the ''Bundahishn'', a text whose relevance to their practice was remote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jenny Rose|title=Zoroastrianism: An Introduction|date=2 Apr 2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857719713|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Stausberg|editor1-first=Michael|title=Zoroastrian Rituals in Context|date=2004|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004131316|pages=479–80|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics also commonly claim that Zoroastrians are worshipers of other deities and elements of nature, such as [[Fire worship|of fire]]—with one prayer, the Litany to the fire (Atesh Niyaesh),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John R. Hinnells|title=The Zoroastrian Diaspora: Religion and Migration|date=28 Apr 2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198267591|page=706|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating: "I invite, I perform (the worship) of you, the Fire, O son of Ahura Mazdā together with all fires"—and [[Mithra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Stausberg|editor1-first=Michael|title=Zoroastrian Rituals in Context|date=2004|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004131316|pages=50, 298–99|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics have charged Zoroastrians with being followers of [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]], who only claimed to be followers of [[monotheism]] in modern times to confront the powerful influence of Christian and Western thought which "hailed monotheism as the highest category of theology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Maneckji Nusservanji Dhalla|authorlink1=Maneckji Nusserwanji Dhalla|title=Zoroastrian Theology: From the Earliest Times to the Present Day|date=1914|page=337|url=http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/Zoroastrian_Theology_from_the_Earliest_Times_to_the_Present_Day_1000035071/369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics insist that the monotheistic reformist view is seen to contradict the conservative (or traditional) view of a dualistic worldview most evident in the relationship between [[Ahura Mazda]] and [[Angra Mainyu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=S. Nigosian|title=Zoroastrian Faith: Tradition and Modern Research|date=24 Sep 1993|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|isbn=9780773564381|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; and arguing that Zoroastrians follow a belief system influenced by [[Henotheism#Zoroastrianism|henotheism]]. Other Western scholars such as [[Martin Haug]], however, have dismissed the concept of theological dualism as a corruption of Zoroaster's original teachings, gradually added by later adherents of the faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jenny Rose|title=Zoroastrianism: An Introduction|date=2 Apr 2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857719713|pages=207–208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics add that the fact that such differing views have proliferated are a sign of the enigmatic nature of the Zoroastrian beliefs regarding the divinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=S. Nigosian|title=Zoroastrian Faith: Tradition and Modern Research|date=24 Sep 1993|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|isbn=9780773564381|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inter-Zoroastrian divisions==
Zoroastrian reformers, such as [[Maneckji Nusserwanji Dhalla]], have argued that literary precedence should be given to the Gathas, as a source of authority and textual authenticity. They have also deplored and criticized many Zoroastrian rituals (e.g. excessive ceremonialism and focus on purity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kenneth Boa|title=Cults, World Religions and the Occult|date=1990|publisher=David C Cook|isbn=9780896938236|page=48|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Stausberg|editor1-first=Michael|title=Zoroastrian Rituals in Context|date=2004|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004131316|page=43|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; using "[[bull]]'s urine for ritual cleansing, the attendance of a dog to gaze at the corpse during funerary rites, the exposure of corpses [[Tower of Silence|on towers]] [for consumption by vultures and ravens]")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=S. Nigosian|title=Zoroastrian Faith: Tradition and Modern Research|date=24 Sep 1993|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|isbn=9780773564381|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Stausberg|editor1-first=Michael|title=Zoroastrian Rituals in Context|date=2004|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004131316|page=471|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; and theological and cosmological doctrines as not befitting of the faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jenny Rose|title=Zoroastrianism: An Introduction|date=2 Apr 2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857719713|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ''orthodox'' versus ''reformist'' controversy rages even on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Stausberg|editor1-first=Michael|title=Zoroastrian Rituals in Context|date=2004|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004131316|page=51|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Divisions and tensions also exist between [[Zoroastrians in Iran|Iranian]] and [[Zoroastrianism in India|Indian Zoroastrians]] and over such issues as the authority of a [[Priestly caste|hereditary priesthood]] in the transmission and interpretation of the faith, ethnicity and the nature of [[Ahura Mazda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jenny Rose|title=Zoroastrianism: An Introduction|date=2 Apr 2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857719713|pages=221–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, differences also existed between the Zoroastrian branches of [[Zurvanism]], [[Mazdakism]] and [[Mazdaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Leaman|editor1-first=Oliver|title=Encyclopedia of Asian Philosophy|date=19 Oct 2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134691159|page=608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Who is a Zoroastrian (Zarathushti)?==
Much like the question of [[who is a Jew?]], Zoroastrian identity, especially whether it is adopted through birth or belief (or both), "remains a cause for tension" within the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jenny Rose|title=Zoroastrianism: An Introduction|date=2 Apr 2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9780857719713|pages=210–11, 220}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Ariane Sherine|title=Zoroastrianism needs to adapt its archaic laws – or die|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2013/dec/08/zorastrianism-adapt-archaic-laws-die-parsi|accessdate=22 June 2015|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|date=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reformers have criticised the orthodox refusal to accept religious converts as one reason for the communities' declining population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=LAURIE GOODSTEIN|title=Zoroastrians Keep the Faith, and Keep Dwindling|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/06/us/06faith.html?ref=us&amp;_r=0|accessdate=26 July 2015|work=The New York Times|date=6 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Predestination==
Zoroastrians have been criticized by Muslim authors for their rejection of [[predestination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Ibn Taymiyyah]]|editor1-last=Memon|editor1-first=Muhammad Umar|editor1-link=Muhammad Umar Memon|title=Ibn Taimiya's Struggle Against Popular Religion: With an Annotated Translation of His Kitab iqtida as-sirat al-mustaqim mukhalafat ashab al-jahim|date=1976|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9783111662381|page=117|edition=reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tamim Ansary|title=Destiny Disrupted: A History of the World Through Islamic Eyes|date=2010|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=9781586488130|page=9|edition=illustrated, reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; This follows a famous [[hadith]] of [[Muhammad]] in which he negatively associates the [[Qadariyah]] Islamic sect with the [[Magi]]ans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard C.

==Patriarchy==

'''Criticism of monotheism''' has occurred throughout history. [[Mark S. Smith]], an American [[biblical scholar]] and ancient historian, currently teaching at the  [[Princeton Theological Seminary]], wrote that  [[Monotheism]] has been a "totalizing discourse", often co-opting all aspects of a social belief system, resulting in the exclusion of "others".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Mark S.[https://books.google.com/books?id=S1tQ5Larst0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "The Origins of Biblical Monotheism: Israel's Polytheistic Background and the Ugaritic Texts]", (August 2001). p. 11. Oxford University Press. (Google Books).&lt;/ref&gt;
Accusers have painted [[monotheism]] as a cause of ignorance, oppression, and violence.

==Contradictions==
Through the means of defining, it is traditionally agreed among the major monotheistic religions that the one God is, ''[[inter alia]]'', [[omnipotent]], [[omniscient]], and [[omnibenevolent]]. However, one scholar argues that "this definition of God [is] contradictory to what has been perceived by us in the empirical world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.mckendree.edu/scholars/2003/kelley.htm Worship as a Hindrance to Self&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723221509/http://faculty.mckendree.edu/scholars/2003/kelley.htm |date=2008-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some feminist thinkers have criticized the monotheistic concept as the model of the highest form of [[patriarchal]] power. They argue that the one god is regarded to be male and opposed to everything related to change, sensuality, nature, feeling, and femininity.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of religion - Volume 9 - Page 6161, by Lindsay Jones&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forcing one belief==
[[File:Painting of David Hume.jpg|thumb|right|[[David Hume]].]]
[[David Hume]] (1711-1776) argues that monotheism is less pluralistic and thus less [[toleration | tolerant]] than [[polytheism]], because monotheism stipulates that people pigeonhole their beliefs into one tenet. &lt;ref&gt;"David Hume argued that unlike monotheism, polytheism is pluralistic in nature,
unbound by doctrine, and therefore far more tolerant than monotheism, which tends to force
people to believe in one faith." [http://elib.doshisha.ac.jp/cgi-bin/retrieve/sr_bookview.cgi/U_CHARSET.utf-8/BD00011896/Body/r002000020001.pdf]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same vein, [[Auguste Comte]] argues, "Monotheism is irreconcilable with the existence in 
our nature of the instincts of benevolence" because it compels followers to devote themselves to a single Creator.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FaMNAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA251&amp;dq ''The Catechism of Positive Religion'', page 251]&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob Neusner suggests that "the logic of monotheism ... yields little basis for tolerating other religions".

[[James Lovelock]] criticized monotheism due to its idea of a transcendent almighty father; he says about monotheism that it "seems to anesthetize the sense of wonder as if one were committed to a single line of thought by a cosmic legal contract".&lt;ref&gt;"A Reenchanted World: The Quest for a New Kinship with Nature", by James William Gibson, p. 98, Publisher = Macmillan, Year = 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violence in monotheism===
In modern times, ancient monotheism is blamed{{by whom?|date=July 2016}} [[Casus belli|as the instigator]] of [[violence]] in its early days as it inspired the Israelites to wage war upon the [[Canaanites]] who believed in multiple gods.&lt;ref&gt;''The Curse of Cain: The Violent Legacy of Monotheism'' {{ISBN|978-0-226-74199-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]] regarded monotheism to be one reason for violence; he said:
{{quote|The intolerance of narrow monotheism is written in letters of blood across the history of man from the time when first the tribes of Israel burst into the land of Canaan. The worshippers of the one jealous God are egged on to aggressive wars against people of alien [beliefs and cultures]. They invoke divine sanction for the cruelties inflicted on the conquered. The spirit of old Israel is inherited by Christianity and Islam, and it might not be unreasonable to suggest that it would have been better for Western civilization if Greece had moulded it on this question rather than Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;

==Success of monotheistic religions==
[[Bertrand Russell]] has stated that in recent history, [[William James]] popularized the idea that the belief in one god causes people to refrain from improper behavior. Furthermore, Russell expostulates through examples that whether "politicians and educators ought to try to make people think there is one [god]" and that it is "a political one"  since one cannot prove the moralistic argument of William James.&lt;ref&gt;''Is There a God?'',(Commissioned by Bertrand Russell, but never published in, Illustrated Magazine, in 1952) {{cite web|url=http://www.cfpf.org.uk/articles/religion/br/br_god.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 20, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720074420/http://www.cfpf.org.uk/articles/religion/br/br_god.html |archivedate=July 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:伏見稲荷５.JPG|thumb|250px|Altar to [[Inari Ōkami]] at the [[Fushimi Inari-taisha|Fushimi Inari Shrine]] in [[Kyoto]]. [[Shinto]] is the ethnic religion of the [[Japanese people]].]]

In [[religious studies]], an '''ethnic religion''' (or '''indigenous religion''') is a [[religion]] associated with a particular [[ethnic group]]. Ethnic religions are often distinguished from [[universalizing religion|universal religions]] which claim to not be limited in ethnic or national scope, such as [[Christianity]] or [[Islam]] or [[Buddhism]] or [[Jainism]].&lt;ref name="Hinnells"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Routledge companion to the study of religion |last=Hinnells |first=John R. |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-33311-3 |pages=439–440 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGspjXKxIf8C |accessdate=2009-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic religions are not only independent religions. Some localised denominations of global religions are practised solely by certain ethnic groups. For example, the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] have a unique denominational structure of Christianity known as the [[Assyrian Church of the East]].

== Terminology ==
A number of alternative terms have been used instead of "ethnic" or "indigenous" religions.

The term "primal religion" was coined by [[Andrew Walls]] in the University of Aberdeen in the 1970s to provide a focus on non-Western forms of religion as found in Africa, Asia, and Oceania.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=James L.|last2=Sutcliffe|first2=Steven J.|date=1 March 2006|title=Religious studies in Scotland: A persistent tension with divinity|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.religion.2005.12.001|journal=Religion|volume=36|issue=1|pages=1–28|doi=10.1016/j.religion.2005.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terms such as "primal religion," "primitive religion," and "tribal religion" have been contested by Walls' student, Jim Cox, who argues that such terms suggest an undeveloped religion which can be seen as a preparation for conversion to Christianity. Cox prefers to use the term "indigenous religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Primitive to Indigenous: The Academic Study of Indigenous Religions|last=Cox|first=James L.|publisher=Ashgate|year=2007|isbn=978-0-754-65569-5|location=Aldershot|pages=9–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another term that is often used is "[[folk religion]]." While "ethnic religion" and "folk religion" have overlapping uses, the latter term implies "the appropriation of religious beliefs and practices at a popular level."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions|last=Bowker|first=John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-191-72722-1|location=New York|pages=|chapter=Folk Religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "folk religion" can therefore be used to speak of [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese]] and [[Traditional African religion|African]] indigenous religions, but can also refer to popular expressions of more multi-national and institutionalized religions such as [[Folk Christianity]] or [[Folk Islam]].

== Usage ==
Ethnic religions are distinctive in their relationship with a particular [[ethnic group]] and often in the shaping of one's solidarity with an ethnic identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ethnicity and Religion: Intersections and Comparisons|last=|first=|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=978-1-138-88037-5|editor-last=Ruane|editor-first=Joseph B.|location=London|pages=|editor-last2=Todd|editor-first2=Jennifer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ethnic religions include [[Hinduism]] of the [[Indian people|Indians]], [[Judaism]] of the [[Jews]], [[Chinese folk religion]] of the [[Han Chinese]], [[Shinto]] of the [[Japanese people|Japanese]], and [[Serer religion|A ƭat Roog]] of the [[Serer people|Serer]] of [[Senegal]], [[The Gambia]], and [[Mauritania]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Diedrich Hermann Westermann|Westermann, Diedrich]]; Smith, Edwin William; Forde, Cyril Daryll; [[International African Institute]]; [[International Institute of African Languages and Cultures]]; [[Project Muse]]; [[JSTOR]] (Organization), ''Africa: journal of the International African Institute, Volume 63'', pp 86-96, 270-1, [[Edinburgh University Press]] for the International African Institute (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diaspora|Diasporic]] groups often maintain ethnic religions as a means of maintaining a distinct ethnic identity, such as [[Hinduism]] among [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|diasporic Indians]] in the [[Caribbean]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Netherlands]], [[Southern Africa|southern]] and [[East Africa|eastern Africa]], [[Mauritius]], [[Fiji]], and the [[Malay Peninsula]],&lt;ref name="van der Veer"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3773407 |last=van der Veer |first=Peter |author2=Steven Vertovec |date=April 1991 |title=Brahmanism Abroad: On Caribbean Hinduism as an Ethnic Religion |journal=Ethnology |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=149–166|jstor=3773407 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the role of [[Traditional African religion|African traditional religion]] and [[Afro-American religions]] among the [[African diaspora in the Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thegrio.com/2011/10/19/african-religions-gain-following-among-black-christians/|title=Are blacks abandoning Christianity for African faiths?|last=Oduah|first=Chika|date=19 October 2011|website=theGrio|access-date=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ancient ethnic religions, such as those historically found in pre-modern Europe, have found new vitality in [[Modern Paganism|neopaganism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements|last=Lewis|first=James R.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-195-36964-9|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, non-ethnic religions such as Christianity have been known to assume ethnic traits to an extent that they serve a role as an important ethnic identity marker,&lt;ref name="Chong"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3711911 |last=Chong |first=Kelly H. |year=1997 |title=What It Means to Be Christian: The Role of Religion in the Construction of Ethnic Identity and Boundary Among Second- Generation Korean Americans |journal=Sociology of Religion |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=259–286|jstor=3711911 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a notable example of this is the Serbian "Saint-Savianism" of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=UxDRgBAOKLAC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;dq=serbian+nationalism+st+sava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrjovEvM7TAhUJ2mMKHeixDgIQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=serbian%20nationalism%20st%20sava&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Lead rewrite|reason=no definition|date=October 2018}}
The book "New Bottles for New Wine" by [[Julian Huxley]], 1957, contains a collection of his essays beginning with  "[[Transhumanism]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huxley|first=Julian|authorlink=Julian Huxley|title=New Bottles for New Wine|url=http://www.transhumanism.org/index.php/WTA/more/huxley|year=1957|publisher=[[Chatto &amp; Windus]]/ [[World Transhumanist Association]]|location=London|pages=13–17|chapter=Transhumanism|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522082157/http://www.transhumanism.org/index.php/WTA/more/huxley|archivedate=2011-05-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ending with "'''Evolutionary Humanism'''".  In the latter essay, Huxley called for a new religion compatible with science.

'Evolutionary Humanism' is the English language name of a book by Dr [[Michael Schmidt-Salomon]] which suggests that [[evolutionary theory]] has implications for morality. Schmidt argues that the theory of evolution does not prescribe a particular set of moral values but it does require people to consider their moral principles free from religious beliefs. Belief in evolution should be combined with a modern humanist philosophy.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Another theory of 'Evolutionary Humanism' is being developed by self-styled philosopher, Roland Herrmann, which holds that human behaviors, emotions, morals, feelings, and thought processes can be traced backward along the human evolutionary tree, rising in earlier animals. The theory holds that these emotions and behaviors are present on a variety of levels in various other species of animals, not only in primates and cetaceans in which these behaviors are most obvious. By recognizing that other animals can be sentient and can have complex thought processes and relationships, a closer bond and stewardship of the planet is necessary. Mr. Herrmann’s earlier website on this subject, www.evolutionaryhumanism.org, was transferred and is no longer associated with his school of thought.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

The '''expulsion of the Jews from Spain''' was ordered in 1492 by the [[Catholic Monarchs]] ruling Castile and Aragon through the [[Alhambra Decree|Edict of Granada]] with the purpose, according to the decree, of preventing them from influencing "[[New Christian]]s", Jews and their descendants who had under duress converted to Christianity. The decision to expel the Jews—or to prohibit the practice of [[Judaism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Suárez Fernández|2012|p=11|ps=«Normalmente los historiadores nos referimos al decreto de 31 de marzo de 1492, firmado por los Reyes Católicos, como si se tratara de la expulsión de los judíos. Fue oficialmente derogado por el gobierno español en 1970, cuando ya hacía más de un siglo que había israelitas residiendo en España, donde las sinagogas venían funcionando al amparo de leyes de libertad religiosa que eran objeto de críticas. Por eso resulta más correcto referirse a dicho documento como una ''prohibición'' de la práctica de la religión hebrea. […] En 1492 se había puesto a los hebreos en una disyuntiva: o se bautizaban integrándose en la comunidad del reino o debían abandonar el territorio».}}&lt;/ref&gt;—followed the establishment of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in the [[Crown of Castile|Crowns of Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] to weed out the [[converso]]s who continued practising their old faith. Historian [[Julio Valdeón Baruque|Julio Valdeón]] wrote, "undoubtedly the expulsion of the Jews from the Iberian site is one of the most controversial issues of all that have happened throughout the [[history of Spain]]". French hispanist [[Joseph Pérez]] highlighted the similarities that exist between this expulsion and the persecution of the [[Jews]] in Hispania visigoda almost a thousand years earlier.

In 2015 the [[Spanish Parliament]] passed a [[Sephardi Jews#Spanish citizenship by Spanish Sephardic descent|law recognizing as Spanish]] those presumed to be descendants of the Jews expelled in 1492, thereby annulling the consequences of that expulsion.

== Background ==

=== Jews in the peninsular medieval Christian states ===
{{main|Anti-Judaism}}
[[File:Toledo_-_Sinagoga_El_Transito_int_02.jpg|thumb|left|Interior of the [[Synagogue of El Transito]] of Toledo]]

Until the fourteenth century the Jews who lived under the Muslim caliphates of [[Al-Ándalus|Al-Andalus]] were tolerated.

On January 2, 1492, the [[Catholic Monarchs]] conquered the [[Emirate of Granada|Nasrid Kingdom of Granada]]. The last Muslim king, [[Muhammad XII of Granada|Boabdil]], withdrew to the [[Alpujarras]] after almost 800 years of Muslim rule were ended by the [[Reconquista]].

A letter sent by the Catholic Monarchs to the Council of Bilbao in 1490 stated that under canon law and according to the laws of the kingdoms, the Jews are tolerated and allowed to live in the kingdoms as subjects and vassals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Valdeón Baruque|2007|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Pérez]] said "one must discard the commonly accepted idea of a Spain where members of the three religions of the Book—[[Christian]]s, [[Islam|Muslims]] and [[Jews]]—would have lived together peacefully during the first two centuries of Al-Andalus, and later in the Christian Reconquest of Spain in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. [[Toleration|Tolerance]] implies not discriminating against minorities and respecting their difference, and between the eighth and fifteenth centuries we find nothing on the peninsula like tolerance." He states that communities of Christians, Jews and Muslims had never lived In the Christian kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2012|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Henry Kamen]], Jews and Muslims were treated "with contempt".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kamen|2011|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; And the Jews were treated with disdain. Three communities "lived separate stocks."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kamen|2011|pp=11; 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, Christian anti-Judaism in the medieval West was intensified, which is reflected in the harsh anti-Jewish measures agreed in the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran|Lateran Council]] celebrated in 1215 at the behest of the [[Pope Innocent III]]. The peninsular Christian kingdoms were by no means foreign to the growth of increasingly belligerent anti-Judaism—in the Castilian code of [[Siete Partidas]] it was said that the Jews lived among Christians "so that their presence would remind that they descended from those who crucified Our Lord Jesus Christ"—but the kings continued to "protect" the Jews for the important role they played in their kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2012|pp=10-11|ps=«Los judíos, perseguidos, hallaron refugio en los reinos cristianos del norte, donde fueron bien acogidos por los príncipes porque procedían de un país –[[Al-Ándalus]]- cuya civilización era por aquel entonces muy superior a la de la España cristiana, porque hablaban árabe, porque conocían la organización política, económica y social de los territorios musulmanes y porque dominaban las técnicas comerciales más avanzadas».}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fourteenth century the period of "tolerance" towards the Jews was over, passing into a phase of increasing conflicts. According to Joseph Perez, "the changing times are not the mentalities, the circumstances. The good times of Spain of the three religions had coincided with a phase of territorial, demographic and economic expansion, Jews and Christians did not compete in the labor market: both one and the other contributed to the general prosperity and shared their benefits. The militant of the Church and the [[Mendicant orders|friars]] hardly found an echo. Of the fourteenth century, the wars and natural catastrophes that precede and follow the [[Black Plague]] create a new situation. ... [People] believe themselves to be the victim of a curse, punished for sins they would have committed. It invites the faithful to repent, to change their behavior and to return to God. This is when the presence of the "deicidal people" among Christians is considered scandalous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2012|pp=12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Jewish massacres of 1391 and its consequences ===
The first wave of violence against the Jews in the Iberian Peninsula occurred in the [[Kingdom of Navarre]] as a consequence of the arrival in 1321 of the [[Shepherds' Crusade (1320)|crusade of the shepherds]] from the other side of the Pyrenees. The [[Jews|Jewry]] of [[Pamplona]] and [[Estella-Lizarra|Estella]] are massacred. Two decades later the impact of the [[Black Death]] of 1348 provokes assaults on the [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|juderías]] of several places, especially those of Barcelona and other places in the Principality of Catalonia. In the Crown of Castile anti-Jewish violence is closely related to the Civil War of the reign of Pedro I in which the side that supported Enrique de Trastámara used anti-Judaism as a propaganda weapon, and the pretender accused his stepbrother, King Peter, of favoring the Jews. Thus the first slaughter of Jews, in Toledo in 1355, was carried out by the supporters of Enrique de Trastámara when they entered the city. The same happened eleven years later when they occupied [[Briviesca]]. In Burgos, Jews who could not pay the large tribute imposed on them in 1366 were reduced to slavery and sold. In Valladolid the Jewry was assaulted in 1367 to the shout of "Long live King Henry!". There were no deaths, but the synagogues were burned down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2012|pp = 13-15|quote=The civil war has changed the situation of the Jews in the crown of Castile. For the first time, [[anti-Semitism]] has been exploited politically; for the first time, has taken violent forms and has led to massacres and looting.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Matanza de judíos en Barcelona - año 1391.jpg|thumb|270px|''Slaughter of Jews in Barcelona in 1391'' ([[Josep Segrelles]], c. 1910).]]
But the great catastrophe for the Jews of the Iberian Peninsula took place in 1391 when massacres took place in the juderías of the Crowns of Castile and of Aragon. The assaults, the fires, the looting and the massacres begin in June in Seville, where [[Ferrand Martinez]], archdeacon of Écija, taking advantage of the power vacuum created by the death of the archbishop of Seville, hardened his preaching against the Jews that had begun in 1378, and ordered the overthrow of the synagogues and requisitioning of prayer books. In January of 1391, a first attempt of assault on the Jewish quarter was avoided by the municipal authorities, but in June hundreds of Jews were murdered, their houses ransacked, and the synagogues converted into churches. Some Jews managed to escape; others, terrified, asked to be baptized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2012|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kamen|2011|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Seville anti-Jewish violence extended throughout Andalusia, and then extended to Castile. In August it reached the Crown of Aragon. Murders, looting and fires took place everywhere. Many of the Jews who survived fled, many to the kingdoms of Navarre and of Portugal, France, and North Africa. Others accepted baptism to avoid death. The number of victims is difficult to know. About 400 Jews were murdered in Barcelona; in Valencia 250; In Lérida 68 ... &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Perez |2012|pp=16-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kamen|2011|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the massacres of 1391, anti-Jewish measures were intensified: in 1411 Castile ordered that Jews wear a red badge sewn to their clothing. In the Crown of Aragon the possession of the [[Talmud]] was declared unlawful, and the number of synagogues per aljama is limited to one. In addition, the mendicant orders, with the support of the monarchs, intensified their campaign of proselytism, in which Valencian [[Vincent Ferrer]] played a prominent part, to convert Jews to Christianity. It was also decreed that Jews were obliged to attend three sermons every year. As a result of the massacres of 1391 and the measures that followed, by 1415 more than half of the Jews of Castile and Aragon had renounced the Mosaic law and had been baptized, including many [[rabbi]]s and important members of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Perez|2012|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jews in the fifteenth century ===
[[File:Spanishhaggadah.jpg|thumb|Miniature of a Spanish [[haggadah]] of the fourteenth century]]

After the massacres of 1391 and the preaching that followed them, by 1415 scarcely a hundred thousand Jews continued to practice their religion in the crowns of Castile and Aragon. Joseph Perez said, "Spanish Judaism will never recover from this catastrophe." The Jewish community "came out of the crisis not only physically diminished but morally and intellectually shattered".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Perez|2009|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Crown of Aragon, Judaism in important places such as Barcelona, Valencia and Palma virtually disappeared—in 1424 the Barcelona Jewry was abolished because it was considered unnecessary—&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kamen|2011|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and only the Zaragoza one remained. In Castile aljamas once flourishing such as those of Seville, Toledo or Burgos lost much of their members; in 1492, the year of the expulsion, in the Crown of Aragon only a quarter of the former number of Jews remained. The famous Jewish community of [[Gerona, Spain|Gerona]], for example, was left with only 24 families. In the Crown of Castile not 80,000 were left. In Seville before the revolts of 1391 there were about 500 Jewish families. According to Joseph Perez, at the time of the expulsion there were fewer than 150,000 Jews, distributed in 35 aljamas of the Crown of Aragon and 216 in the Crown of Castile. In both Crowns it was observed that the Jews had left the great cities and lived in the small and the rural areas, less exposed "to the excesses of the Christians."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Perez|2009|pp. 138; 164-165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the critical period of 1391-1415, the pressure on Jews recovering their synagogues and books confiscated decreased, and they became able to avoid certain obligations such as carrying the red ribbon or attending friars' sermons. They could also reconstruct the internal organization of the aljamas and their religious activities, thanks to the agreements reached by the procurators of the aljamas gathered in Valladolid in 1432 and sanctioned by the king, which means that "the Crown of Castile accepts again officially that a minority of its subjects has another religion than the Christian one and recognizes the right of this minority to exist legally, with a legal status." "In this way the Jewish community is rebuilt with the approval of the crown." Abraham Beneviste, who presided over the meeting of Valladolid, was appointed court rabbi with authority over all the Jews of the kingdom, and at the same time as delegate of the king over them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2009|pp=139-140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reign of the Catholic Monarchs, in the last quarter of the 15th century, many Jews lived in rural villages and engaged in agricultural activities. Crafts and trade were not monopolized—international trade had passed into the hands of converts. While Jews continued to trade as [[money-lender]]s, the number of Christian lenders had increased a lot. Jews also continued to collect royal, ecclesiastical and seigniorial rents, but their importance had also diminished—in Castile they were only in charge of a quarter of the revenues. However, in the court of Castile—but not Aragon—Jews held important administrative and financial positions. [[Abraham Senior]] was from 1488 treasurer-major of the Holy Brotherhood, a key organism in the financing of the [[Granada War|war of Grenada]], and also chief rabbi of Castile. Yucé Abravanel was "A greater collector of the service and mountaineering of the herds, one of the more healthy income and greater yield of the Crown of Castile."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2009|pp=165-167}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Joseph Perez, the role of the Jews in the court must not be exaggerated. "The truth was that the state could do without the Jews, both in the bureaucratic apparatus and in the management of the estate."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2009|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Isabel la reina catolica.jpg|thumb|[[Isabella I of Castile|Isabel I of Castile]]]]

We must therefore reject the claim that the Hebrew community at the end of the fifteenth century was immensely rich and influential. "In fact, the Spanish Jews at the time of their expulsion did not form a homogeneous social group. There were among them classes as in Christian society, a small minority of very rich and well-placed men, together with a mass of small people: Farmers, artisans, shopkeepers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2009|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; What united them was that they practiced the same faith, different from the one recognized, which made them a separate community within the monarchy and which was "property" of the crown which thereby protected them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2009|pp=168-169}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter dated 7 July, 1477, addressed to the authorities of [[Trujillo, Cáceres|Trujillo]], where incidents had occurred against the Jews, Queen Isabella I of Castile, after putting the aljama under her protection and prohibiting all type of oppression or humiliation against its members, states:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2009|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|All the Jews of my kingdoms are mine and are under my protection, and it is for me to defend and protect them and to keep them in justice.}}

Thus, the Jews "formed not a State in the State, but rather a micro-society next to the majority Christian society, with an authority [the rabbi greater] that the crown delegated to him over its members." The aljamas were organized internally with a wide margin of autonomy. They designated by lottery the council of elders that governed the life of the community; collecting their own taxes for the maintenance of worship, synagogues, and rabbinical teaching; lived under the norms of Jewish law, and had their own courts that understood all cases in civil matters - from the Cortes de Madrigal of 1476 criminal cases had passed to the royal courts. But Jews did not enjoy the fullness of civil rights: they had a specific tax system far more burdensome than that of Christians and were excluded from positions that could confer authority on Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2009|pp=169-170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation in which the Jews lived, according to Joseph Perez, posed two problems: "as subjects and vassals of the king, the Jews had no guarantee for the future - the monarch could at any time close the autonomy of the aljamas or require new Most important taxes-"; and, above all, "in these late years of the Middle Ages, when a state of modern character is being developed, there could be no question of a problem of immense importance: was the existence of separate and autonomous communities compatible with the demands of A modern state? This was the real question."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Perez|2009|pp=170-171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The "converso problem" and the creation of the Inquisition ===
{{main|Origins of the Spanish Inquisition}}
[[File:Tajador judeo-español s.XIV.jpg|thumb|Judeo-Spanish dish of century XIV]]

In the fifteenth century, the main problem stopped being the Jews to become the conversos, whose number according to Joseph Perez would probably be close to two hundred thousand people. Christian convert was applied to the Jews who had been [[Baptism|baptized]] and their descendants. As many of them had done it by force they were always looked upon with distrust by those who will call themselves [[Old Christian|Old Christians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kamen|2011|pp = 17-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the fifteenth century the positions abandoned by the Jews were mostly occupied by the converts, who concentrated there where the Jewish communities had flourished before 1391. They dealt with the activities formerly performed by the Jews - trade, the handicraft - and now with the added advantage that as Christians they can access trades and professions that were previously forbidden to the Jews. Some even enter the clergy becoming [[Biblical canon|canon]] so [[prior]] is&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2012|pp = 19-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even bishops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kamen|2011|p = 35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social rise of the converts was viewed with suspicion by the "old" Christians, a resentment that was accentuated by the conscience on the part of those who had a differentiated identity, proud of being Christians and having Jewish ancestry, which was the lineage of Christ. Thus popular revolts broke out against the converts between 1449 and 1474, when in Castile lived a period of economic difficulties and political crisis (especially during the civil war of the reign of Henry IV). The first and most important of these revolts was the one that took place in 1449 in Toledo, during which a "Judgment-Statute" was approved that prohibited the access to the municipal positions of "no confesso of the lineage of the Jews" - an antecedent of the following blood-cleaning statutes of the following century. The origin of the revolts was economic in Andalusia especially there was a situation of hunger, aggravated by an epidemic of plague - and in principle "not directed especially against the converts." It is the parties and the demagogues that take advantage of the exasperation of the people and direct it against the converts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2012|pp = 20-21| ps = "The rich are hated because they are safe from hunger and disease; traders are accused of storing wheat to cause prices to rise; the houses of one and the other are looted."}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:La Virgen de los Reyes Católicos.jpg|thumb|250px|left| Cuadro ''[[La Virgen de los Reyes Católicos|Virgen de los Reyes Católicos]]'' in which appears kneeling behind the king Ferdinand the Catholic, the inquisitor general [[Tomás de Torquemada]] and kneeling behind the queen the inquisitor of Aragon [[Pedro de Arbués|Pedro of Arbués]]]]

In order to justify the attacks on the converts, it is affirmed that they are false Christians and that they are still practicing the Jewish religion in secret. According to Joseph Perez, it is a proven fact that, among those who converted to escape the blind furor of the masses in 1391, or by the pressure of the proselytizing campaigns of the early fifteenth century, some clandestinely returned to their old faith when It seemed that the danger had passed, of which it is said that ''Judaízan.'' The accusation of [[Crypto-Judaism]] becomes more plausible when some cases of prominent converts who continued to observe the Jewish rites after their conversion. But Joseph Judaizers, according to Joseph Perez, were a minority, although relatively important. The same affirms [[Henry Kamen]] when he says that "it can be affirmed that in the end of the 1470’s there was no Judaizing movement highlighted or proven among the converts." He also points out that when a convert was accused of judaizing, in many cases the "proofs" that were brought were in fact cultural elements of his Jewish ancestry - such as the Sabbath, not Sunday, as the day of rest - or the lack of knowledge of the new faith - such as not knowing the creed or eating meat in Lent - &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kamen|2011|pp = 44-46|ps = "Anyone who does not adapt to the rest of the community will be I saw as "Jew." Manuel Rodríguez, alchemist of Soria in the 1470’s, disdained the official religion, but the parish priest described him as "the wisest men in the world in all things." Precisely for this reason he was reputed, according to the testimony of an official, to be "Jewish"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is how the "convergent problem" is born. The baptized can not renounce their faith according to the canonical doctrine of the Church by which [[Crypto-Judaism]] is assimilated to [[heresy]], and as such must be punished. This is how they begin to claim various voices including those of some converts who do not want to question the sincerity of their baptism because of those "false" Christians who are beginning to be called [[Marrano]]. And it also extends the idea that the presence of the Jews among the Christians is what invites the converts to continue practicing the [[Law of Moses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Perez|2012|pp = 24-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When in 1474 she acceded to the throne, married to the heir of the Crown of Aragon, the future [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], crypto-Judaism was not punished, "not, of course, by tolerance Or indifference, but because they lacked appropriate legal instruments to characterize this type of crime. "Thus, when they decide to confront the "converso problem", especially after the prior of the Dominicans of Seville, Fray [[Alonso de Ojeda]], in 1475 sent them an alarming report on the number of converts who in that city judaízan, even in an open way,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2012|p = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; are addressed to [[Pope Sixtus IV]] to authorize them to appoint inquisitors in their kingdoms, which the pontiff grants them by the Bull "Exigit sincerae devotionis" of November 1, 1478. "With the creation of the tribunal of the Inquisition, the authorities will have the instrument and the means of in "According to Joseph Perez, Ferdinand and Isabella" were convinced that the Inquisition would compel the converts to integrate definitively: the day when all new Christians renounced Judaism nothing would distinguish them from the other members of the social body."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Perez|2012|pp = 26-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The expulsion ==

=== The segregation of the Jews (1480) ===
[[File:IsabellaofCastile05.jpg|thumb|[[Isabella I of Castile|Isabel I of Castile]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Fernando II of Aragon]].]]

From the beginning of his reign, Isabel and Ferdinand were concerned to protect the Jews - since they were "property" of the crown. For example, on September 6, 1477, in a letter addressed to the Jewish community of Seville, Queen Elizabeth I gave assurances about her safety:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2012|pp = 21-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote| I take under my protection the Jews of the aljamas in general and to each one in particular, as well as to his people and their goods; I protect them against any attack, be it of the nature that is ...; I forbid that they attack, mate or hiera; I also prohibit a passive attitude if attacked, killed or injured.
Hence even the Catholic Kings until 1492 were reputed to be favorable to the Jews. This is what the German traveler, Nicolas de Popielovo says, for example, after his visit in 1484-1485:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Perez|2009|p = 175}}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His subjects of Catalonia and Aragon speak publicly and the same things I have heard say to many in Spain that the Queen is protector of the Jews and daughter of a Jewish woman}}
But the Catholic Monarchs could not do away with all the vexations and discrimination suffered by the Jews, encouraged on many occasions by the preaching of the friars of the mendicant orders. They then made the decision to segregate the Jews to end the conflict. Already in the Cortes of Madrigal of 1476 the kings had protested by the breach of the provisions in the Order of 1412 on the Jews - prohibition to wear luxury dresses; Obligation to wear a red slice on the right shoulder; prohibition to hold positions with authority over Christians, to have Christian servants, to lend money at usurious interest, etc. - but in the Cortes de Toledo of 1480 they decided to go much further to fulfill these norms: to force the Jews to live In separate quarters, from where they could not leave except during the day to carry out their professional occupations. Until then the Jewish quarters-where the Jews used to live and where they had their synagogues, butchers, etc.-had not formed a separate world in the cities and there were also Christians living in them and Jews living outside them. From 1480 onwards, the Jewish quarters were converted into ghettos surrounded by walls and the Jews were confined in them to avoid confusion and damage of our holy faith. A process for which a term of two years was established, but which lasted for more than ten years, and which was not exempt from problems and abuses by Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2009|pp = 176-178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SegoviaPSAndres 21-4-03.JPG|thumb|left|Lowered to the Gate of San Andrés, in the Judería of Segovia]]
The text approved by the Cortes, which also included the [[Mudéjar|Mudejar]], read as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Valdeón Baruque|2007|p = 92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We send to the aljamas of the said Jews and Moors that each of them who put in said apartment such diligence and give such order as within the said term of the said two years have said houses of their apart, and live and die in them, and henceforth do not have their dwellings among the Christians or elsewhere outside the circuits and places that would be deputies to the said Jewry and die.}}
The decision of the kings approved by the Courts of Toledo, had antecedents since the Jews already had been confined in some Castilian localities like Cáceres or Soria. In this last locality had been realized with the approval of the kings "to avoid dapnos [sic] that because of bevir and to dwell and to be the Jews among the christianos they followed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Valdeón Baruque|2007|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fray Hernando de Talavera, confessor of the queen and who had opposed the use of force to solve the "convergent problem", also justified the segregation "by avoiding many sins, which are followed of the mixture and a great deal of familiarity [between Christians and Jews] and of not keeping everything close to their conversation with Christians by [[Canon law|holy canons]] and civil laws is ordered and commanded."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Valdeón Baruque|2007|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Joseph Perez, with the decision to detain Jews in ghettos, it was not only a question of separating them from Christians and of protecting them, but also of imposing a series of obstacles on them in the development of their activities, so that they would not have more remedy "than to give up their status as Jews if they want to lead a normal existence. Their conversion is not demanded - not yet - nor is their autonomous statute touched, but they proceed with them in such a way that they end up convincing themselves that the only solution is conversion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2009|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The expulsion of the Jews from Andalusia (1483) ===
[[File:Cordoba sinagoga de cordoba.jpg|thumb|250px|Interior of the [[Córdoba Synagogue]].]]

The first inquisitors appointed by the kings arrived in Seville in November 1480, "immediately sowing terror". In the first years and only for this city they dictate 700 death sentences and more than five thousand "reconciliations" - that is, prison sentences, exile or simple penances - that are accompanied by the confiscation of their property and the disqualification For public office and ecclesiastical benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2009|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their inquiries the inquisitors discovered that for a long time many converts had met with their Jewish relatives to celebrate Jewish holidays and even attend synagogues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2009|pp=171-172}}&lt;/ref&gt; This convinces them that they will not be able to put an end to crypto-Judaism if converts continue to maintain contact with the Jews, for example: what they ask the kings to be expelled from Andalusia. These approve and in 1483 give a period of six months for the Jews of the dioceses of Seville, Cordoba and Cadiz to go to Extremadura. There are doubts as to whether the order was strictly enforced since at the time of the final expulsion in 1492 some chroniclers speak of the fact that eight thousand families of Andalusia embarked in Cadiz and others in Cartagena and in the ports of the Crown of Aragon. On the other hand, the expulsion of the Jews of Saragossa and Teruel was also proposed, but in the end it was not carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2009|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Julio Valdeón, the decision to expel the Jews from Andalusia also obeyed "the desire to move them away from the border between the crown of Castile and the [[Emirate of Granada|Nasrid Kingdom of Granada]], scenario, during the eighties of the fifteenth century And the first years of the 1990s, of the war that ended with the disappearance of the last stronghold of peninsular Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Valdeón Baruque|2007|p = 93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The genesis of the expulsion decree ===
{{main|Alhambra Decree}}
[[File:Alhambra Decree.jpg|thumb|200px|Sealed copy of the [[Alhambra Decree|Edict of Granada]].]]

On March 31, 1492, shortly after the end of the Granada war, the Catholic Kings signed the decree of expulsion of the Jews in Granada, which was sent to all the cities, towns and lordships of their kingdoms with orders strict to not read it or make it public until May 1.&lt;ref name = "Rumeu"&gt;{{cite book| last= Rumeu de Armas | first = Antonio | title = New light on the Santa Fe capitulations of 1492 between the Catholic Monarchs and Christopher Columbus: institutional and diplomatic study | page = 138-141 | editor = Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas | isbn = 9788400059613}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that some prominent Jews tried to nullify or soften it but did not have any success. Among these Jews stands out [[Isaac Abarbanel|Isaac Abravanel]] who offered King Ferdinand a considerable sum of money. According to a well-known legend when the Inquisitor General [[Tomás de Torquemada|Tomas de Torquemada]] found out, he presented himself before the king and threw a crucifix at his feet, saying: "Judas sold our Lord for thirty pieces of silver; His Majesty is about to sell it again for thirty thousand." According to the Israeli historian Benzion Netanyahu, quoted by Julio Valdeón, when Abravanel met with the Queen Isabella, she said to him: "'Do you think this comes from me? The Lord has put that thought into the heart of the King?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Valdeón Baruque|2007|p= 101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months before a car of faith held in Avila in which three converts and two Jews condemned by the Inquisition were burnt alive for an alleged crime of ritual crime against a Christian child (who will be known as the [Child of the Guard] contributed to create the propitious environment for the expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2009| pp = 185-186}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Torquemada.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tomás de Torquemada|Tomas de Torquemada]], first [[Grand Inquisitor|inquisitor general]].]]
The [[Catholic Monarchs|Catholic Kings]] had precisely entrusted to the [inquisitor general] [[Tomás de Torquemada|Tomás de Torquemada]] and its collaborators the writing of the decree fixing to them, according to the historian [[Luis Suárez Fernández|Luis Suarez]], three previous conditions Which would be reflected in the document: to justify the expulsion by charging Jews with two sufficiently serious offenses - usury and "heretical practice"; That there should be sufficient time for Jews to choose between baptism or exile; And that those who remained faithful to the Mosaic law could dispose of their movable and immovable property, although with the provisos established by the laws-they could not draw either gold, silver, or horses. Torquemada presented the draft decree to the kings on March 20, 1492, and the monarchs signed and published it in Granada on March 31. According to Joseph Perez, that the kings commissioned the drafting of the decree to Torquemada "demonstrates the leading role of [the Inquisition] in that matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez | 2009 | p = 187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the decree promulgated in Granada on March 31, which was based on the draft decree of Torquemada - drawn up "with the will and consent of their altezas" and which is dated in Santa Fe On March 20 - there are two versions. One signed by the two kings and valid for the Crown of Castile and another signed only by King Ferdinand and valid for the Crown of Aragon. Between the draft decree of Torquemada and the two final versions and between these, they exist, according to Joseph Perez, "significant variants." In contrast to the Torquemada project and the Castilian decree, in the version addressed to the Crown of Aragon the protagonism of the Inquisition is recognized - " Persuading us the venerable father prior of Santa Cruz [Torquemada], inquisitor general of the heretical staidness usury is mentioned as one of the two crimes of which the Jews are accused: "We find the Jewish sayings, by means of great and unbearable usages, to devour and absorb the properties and substances of Christians"; We reaffirm the official position that only the Crown can decide the fate of the Jews since they are the possession of the kings - "they are ours," it is said; And contains more insulting expressions against the Jews: they are accused of making fun of the laws of Christians and of considering them [[idolatry|idolaters]]; Mention is made of the abominable circumstances and of Jewish perfidy. The Judaism of "leprosy" is qualified; It is recalled that the Jews "by their own fault are subject to perpetual servitude, to be slaves and captives."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Perez | 2009 | pp. 187-188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the essentials the two versions have the same structure and expose the same ideas. The first part describes the reasons why the kings - or the king in the case of the "Aragonese" version - decide to expel the Jews and in the second part it is detailed how the expulsion is going to take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Perez|2009|p = 188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The conditions of expulsion ===
The second part of the decree detailed the conditions for expulsion:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Perez|2009|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The expulsion of the Jews was final: "we agreed to send all Jews and Jews out of our kingdoms and never return or return to them or any of them."
# There was no exception, neither by reason of age, residence or place of birth - include both those born in Castile and Aragon and those from outside.
# There was a period of four months, which would be extended ten more days, until August 10, so that they would leave the kings' domains. Those who did not do so within that period or who returned later would be punished with the death penalty and the confiscation of their property. Likewise, those who aided or concealed the Jews were liable to lose "all their goods, vassals, and fortresses, and other inheritances."
# Within the set period of four months the Jews could sell their real estate and take the proceeds of the sale in the form of bills of exchange, not in coinage or gold and silver because their exit was prohibited by law - or merchandise - as long as they were not arms or horses, whose export was also prohibited.

Although the edict did not refer to a possible conversion, this alternative was implicit. As the historian [[Luis Suárez Fernández|Luis Suárez]] pointed out, the Jews had "four months to take the most terrible decision of their lives: to abandon their faith to be integrated in it [in the kingdom, in the political and civil community], or leave the territory in order to preserve it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Suárez Fernández|2012|p=415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drama that lived the Jews is collected by a contemporary source:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Some Jews, when the term ended, went by night and day as in despair. Many turned from the road ... and received the faith of Christ. Many others, not depriving themselves of the country where they were born and for not selling their goods at that time at fewer prices, were baptized.}}
[[File:Brockhaus and Efron Jewish Encyclopedia e1 134-0.jpg|thumb|[[Isaac Abravanel]].]]

The most outstanding Jews, with few exceptions among which the one of Isaac Abravanel stands out, decided to convert to the Christianity. The most relevant case was that of [[Abraham Senior]], the chief rabbi of Castile and one of the closest collaborators of the kings. He and all his relatives were baptized on June 15, 1492 in the Guadalupe monastery, being his godfathers the kings Isabel and Fernando. It took the name of Fernán Núñez Coronel and its son-in-law Mayr Melamed of Fernán Pérez Coronel - the same name of pile that the one of the king. In this case, like that of Abraham de Córdoba, he was given much publicity to serve as an example for the rest of his community. In fact during the four-month tacit term that was given for the conversion many Jews were baptized, especially the rich and the most educated, and among them the vast majority of the [[rabino|rabbis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A chronicler of the time relates the intense propaganda campaign that unfolded:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|In all the synagogues and in the squares and in the churches and in the fields, by the wise men of Spain, and was preached to them by the holy gospel and the doctrine of the holy Mother Church, and was preached and tested by their own Scriptures, how the Messiah who waited were Our Redeemer and Savior Jesus Christ, who came in the time to be agreed, which his ancestors with malice they ignored, and all the others who came after them never wanted to give ear to the truth; before being deceived by the false book of the [[Talmud]], having the truth before their eyes and reading it in their law every day, they ignored it and ignored it.}}

The Jews who decided not to become "had to prepare themselves for the march in tremendous conditions". They had to sell their goods because they had very little time and had to accept the sometimes ridiculous amounts they offered them in the form of goods that could be carried away because the gold and silver output of the kingdom was prohibited - the possibility of taking [[Bills of exchange|bills of exchange]] were not much help because the bankers, Italians for the most part, demanded them enormous interests. A chronicler of the time attests this:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|pp=112-113}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|They sold and squandered everything they could of their estates ... and in everything there were sinister ventures, and the Christians had their estates, very many and very rich houses and inheritances for few monies; and they prayed with them, and found not one to buy them, and gave a house for an ass and a vine for a little cloth or a linen cloth, because they could not bring forth gold or silver.}}
They also had serious difficulties in recovering the money lent to Christians because either the repayment term was after August 10, deadline for their departure, or many of the debtors denounced "usury fraud", knowing that the Jews, they would not have time for the courts to prove them right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|pp=113-114}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to the kings, the [[Ampudia]] Jews complained that "The mayors of the said village made them and have closed many unreason and grievances says that they do not consent to them, nor do they want them to pay and pay their personal property and that they have no less, but they want to make and pay the debts owed to them and that which they deem urge them to do and then pay them even if the deadlines are not reached."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Valdeón Baruque|2007|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File: Luis de Santangel.jpg |thumb|[[Luis de Santángel]], a Valencian convert who collaborated with [[Isaac Abarbanel]] in the organization of the journey of the expelled Jews.]]
In addition they had to take care of all the expenses of the trip - transport, maintenance, freight of the ships, tolls, etc. -. This was organized by Isaac Abravanel, who contracted the ships, having to pay very high prices and whose owners in some cases did not fulfill the contract or killed the travelers to steal what little they had. Avranel counted on the collaboration of the real official convert [[Luis de Santángel]] and of the banker genovés, [[Francisco Pinelo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kings had to give orders to be protected during the trip, because during the same suffered vexations and abuse. This is how [[Andrés Bernaldez]], pastor of [[Los Palacios]], the time when the Jews had to "abandon their land of their births":&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|All the young men and daughters who were twelve years old were married to each other, for all the females of this age above were in the shadow and company of husbands... They came out of the lands of their births, children, and children, old and young, on foot and knights on asses and other beasts, and on wagons, and continued their journeys each to the ports that were to go; and went by the roads and fields where they went with many works and fortunes; some falling, others rising, others dying, others being born, others becoming sick, that there was no Christian that there was no pain of them and always because they were invited to baptism and some, with their care, they became and remained but very few, and the rabbis worked them up and made the women and young men sing and play tambourines.}}

{{quote|In the Castilian version reference is made exclusively to religious motives - in the Aragonese version it is also alluded to usury - because the Jews are accused of "heretical", i.e.: serve as an example and incite the [[Judeoconverse|convert]] to return to the practices of his ancient religion.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2009|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Suárez Fernández|2012|p=414}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the beginning of the decree It is said that:
It is well known that in our domains there are some bad Christians who have Judaized and have committed apostasy against the holy Catholic faith, being the cause most by the relations between Jews and Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2009|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The following are the measures taken hitherto by kings to end the communication between the Jewish community and the converts, a fundamental cause according to the kings and the Inquisition, that the new Christians, first of all the agreement of the Cortes de Toledo of 1480 by which the Jews were forced to live in neighborhoods separated from the Christians, in order to prevent the Jews from "subverting and subtracting the Christian faithful from our holy Catholic faith." Secondly, the decision to expel the Jews from Andalusia, "believing that this would suffice for those of the other cities and towns and places of our kingdoms and lordships to cease to do and commit the aforesaid." But this measure failed" "because every day it is found and it seems that the said Jews grow in continuing their bad and damaged purpose where they live and talk.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Suárez Fernández|2012|p=414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the reason for deciding to expel the entire Jewish community, and not just those of its members who allegedly wanted to "pervert" the Christians, is explained:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Suárez Fernández|2012|p=415}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2009|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Because when a serious and detestable crime is committed by a college or university [i.e.: a corporation and a community], it is a reason for such a college or university to be dissolved, and annihilated, and the minors for the elders and the ones for the others punished and that those who pervert the good and honest living of cities and towns and by contagion can harm others to be expelled.}}

As highlighted [[Julio Valdeón]], "undoubtedly the expulsion of the Jews from the Iberian site is one of the most controversial issues of all that have happened throughout the [[history of Spain]]." It is not surprising, therefore, that historians have debated whether, in addition to the motives laid out by the Catholic Monarchs in the decree, there were others. Nowadays, some of those who argued at the time, such as the expulsion of the Jews to stay with their wealth, seem to have been discarded, since the majority of the Jews who left were the most modest, while the richest converted and they stayed, and on the other hand, the crown did not benefit at all from the operation - rather it was damaged because it stopped receiving the taxes paid by the Jews. Nor does the argument seem to hold that the expulsion was an episode of classes - the nobility wanted to get rid of an incipient bourgeoisie that represented the Jews and that supposedly threatened their interests - because many Jews were defended by some of the most important nobiliary families of Castile, and because he was also among the ranks of the "bourgeoisie" of "old Christians" where anti-Judaism grew the most.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Valdeón Baruque|2007|pp=99-100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|pp=117-118; 120-}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The personal motives of the kings also seem to be ruled out, because everything indicates that they did not feel any repugnance towards Jews and converts. Among the trusted men of the kings were several who belonged to this group, such as the confessor of the queen [[Hernando de Talavera|fray Hernando de Talavera]], the steward [[Andrés Cabrera]], the treasurer of the [[Santa Hermandad]] [[Abraham Senior]], or as Mayr Melamed or [[Isaac Abarbanel]], without counting the Jewish doctors that attended them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|pp=124-125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Expulsión judíos.svg|thumb|right|300px|Expulsion of European Jewish communities between 1100 and 1600. The main routes that followed the Spanish Jews are marked in light brown.]]
Current historians prefer to place expulsion in the European context and stand out, such as [[Luis Suárez Fernández]] or Julio Valdeón, that the Catholic Kings were in fact the last of the sovereigns of the great western European states to decree The expulsion-the Kingdom of England did it in 1290, the [[France in the Middle Ages|Kingdom of France]] in 1394; in 1421 the Jews are expelled from [[Vienna]]; in 1424 of [[Linz]] and of [[Cologne|Colonia]]; in 1439 of [[Augsburg]]; in 1442 of [[Bavaria]]; in 1485 of [[Perugia]]; in 1486 of [[Vicenza]]; in 1488 of [[Parma]]; in 1489 of [[Milan]] and [[San Luca|Luca]]; in 1493 of [[Sicily]]; in 1494 of [[Florence]]; in 1498 of Provenza...-.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of all of them was to achieve unity of faith in their states, a principle that will be defined in the sixteenth century with the formula "[[cuius regio, eius religio]]", that the subjects should profess the same religion as their prince.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Valdeón Baruque|2007|pp=89; 99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Joseph Perez pointed out, the expulsion "puts an end to an original situation in Christian Europe: that of a nation that consents to the presence of different religious communities" with which it "becomes a nation like the rest in Christendom European". "The [[University of Paris]] congratulated Spain for having carried out an act of good government, an opinion shared by the best spirits of the time ([[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]], [[Guicciardini]], [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola|Pico della Mirandola]])... [...] it was the so-called medieval coexistence that missed Christian Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|pp=136-137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Julio Valdeón affirms that the decision of the Catholic Monarchs, who "showed themselves, in their first years of rule, clearly protective of the Hebrews," was due to "pressure from the rest of Christianity" and to "the constant pressure of Church, who often preached against those he called "deicides", as well as the "tremendous animosity that existed in the Christian people against the Jewish community." In this sense he quotes the thesis of the Israeli historian [[Benzion Netanyahu]] that the expulsion was the consequence of the climate of racism that was lived in the Christian society of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Valdeón Baruque|2007|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; A thesis the latter - that the kings decided the expulsion to ingratiate themselves with the masses in which the anti-Jewish sentiments predominated - that Joseph Perez considers without foundation. "Why should kings have to worry about what the masses felt about Jews and converts when they did not serve the more concrete interests of those masses?" Of the three surviving versions of the expulsion edict, only the third term "usury", which was signed only by Don Fernando, refers to the subject of usury, in very harsh terms, and in the other two versions we do not read a single mention or even the slightest mention of this matter. Accusations that had been repeated for centuries against the Jews: people deicide, desecration of hosts, ritual crimes ... do not appear in any of the three versions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|pp=125-126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Joseph Perez, the decision of the Catholic Monarchs, as evidenced by the content of the [[Alhambra Decree|Granada Edict]], is directly related to the "converso problem". The first step was the creation of the Inquisition, the second the expulsion of the Jews to eliminate those who allegedly incited the converts to Judaize. "What concerned them [the kings] was the total and definitive assimilation of the converts, for which the previous measures failed; they resort to a drastic solution: the expulsion of the Jews to start evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The idea of expelling the Jews is part of the Inquisition, of which there is no doubt ... The Inquisition found the expulsion of the Jews the best way to put an end to the Judaizing converts: removed the Catholic Monarchs take the idea to their own account, but this does not mean that the pressure of the inquisitors is low. Heresy is not to their liking, they want to "clean" their kingdom, as the queen wrote, but these concerns are also political: they hope that the elimination of Judaism will facilitate the definitive assimilation and integration of converts into Spanish society".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|pp=128-129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Joseph Perez, following Luis Suárez, places the expulsion within the context of the construction of the "modern state," which requires greater social cohesion based on unity of faith to impose its authority on all groups and individuals of the kingdom. Unlike the medieval period in this type of state, it does not fit the groups that are governed by particular norms, as was the case of the Jewish community. It is therefore not a coincidence, Pérez warns, that only three months after having eliminated the last Muslim stronghold of the peninsula with the conquest of the Nazari kingdom of Granada, they decree the expulsion of the Jews. "What was intended then was to completely assimilate Judaizers and Jews so that there would be no more than Christians. Kings must have thought that the prospect of expulsion would encourage Jews to become massively and that a gradual assimilation would do away with the remnants of Judaism". The vast majority chose to leave, with all that entailed of tears, sacrifices and vexations, and to remain faithful to their faith. "They totally refused to assimilate as an alternative."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|pp=129-132}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, "assimilation" is in this quotation a euphemism: what was offered to the Sephardic was in fact the conversion to a faith that was not his own, hence his Emigration in mass (towards the different directions indicated in the attached map).

== Consequences ==

=== The end of religious diversity in Spain ===
[[File:Monumentoalatolerancia.jpg|thumb|[[Monument to Tolerance]] in [[Seville]], located in the place where five Jews were burned alive.]]
[[File:Sephardic family in Bosnia, 19th century.jpg|thumb|Sephardic family of Bosnia [[Ottoman Bosnia and Herzegovina|ottoman Bosnia]] (19th century).]]

As Joseph Perez pointed out, "In 1492 the story of Spanish Judaism ends, which will only lead to an underground existence, always threatened by the Spanish Inquisition and the suspicion of a public opinion that saw In Jews, Judaizers and even sincere converts to natural enemies of Catholicism and Spanish idiosyncrasy, as understood and imposed by some ecclesiastical and intellectual leaders, in an attitude that bordered on racism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of expelled Jews remains controversial. The figures ranged from 45,000 to 350,000, although the most recent investigations, according to Joseph Perez, place it at around 50,000, taking into account the thousands of Jews who left after returning because of the mistreatment they suffered in some places in Fez, Marruecos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Valdeón Baruque|2007|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julio Valdeón, citing also the latest investigations, places the figure between 70,000 and 100,000, of which between 50,000 and 80,000 would come from the [[Crown of Castile]], although in these numbers the returnees are not counted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Valdeón Baruque|2007|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation of those who returned was regularized with an order of November 10, 1492, in which it was established that civil and ecclesiastical authorities had to be witnesses to baptism, and in the event that they had been baptized before returning, evidence and testimonials that confirm it. They were also able to recover all their goods for the same price at which they had sold them. Returns are documented at least until 1499. On the other hand, a provision of the Royal Council of October 24, 1493, determined harsh sanctions for those who reviled these new Christians - calling them "transgressors," for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the economic impact of the expulsion, it seems to be ruled out that it was a hard setback and stopped the birth of capitalism, which would be one of the causes of the decline of Spain. As Joseph Perez has pointed out, "in view of the published literature on taxation and economic activities, there is no doubt that the Jews were no longer a source of relevant wealth, neither as bankers nor as renters nor as merchants who developed the expulsion of the Jews produced problems at the local level but not a national catastrophe. It is clearly unreasonable to attribute to that event the decadence of Spain and its supposed inability to adapt to the transformations of the modern world. What we now know shows that sixteenth-century Spain was not precisely an economically backward nation. [....] In strictly demographic and economic terms, and apart from human aspects, the expulsion did not imply for Spain any substantial deterioration, but only a temporary crisis Quickly overtaken."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|pp=118-120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A copy of the Amsterdam Gazette published in the Netherlands on September 12, 1672. The Hebrews of Amsterdam printed a newspaper showing the interest of the Jewish community in what was happening at that time in Madrid and , It also read the news in Spanish - after 180 years of being expelled from its ancestral soil (1492).&lt;ref&gt;La historia de los judíos en ''Sefarad'' (hebreo: España) se remonta a los tiempos de la [[Edad Antigua|Antigüedad]] e involucra a los súbditos del rey [[Salomón]] y a otros tantos exiliados del [[Reino de Judá]] (Toledo, Sinagoga del Tránsito, ''La vida judía en Sefarad'', noviembre 1991—enero 1992; publicación del Ministerio de Cultura de España, pp. 19-20).&lt;/ref&gt;
Document preserved and exhibited in [[The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot|Beth Hatefutsoth]], Nahum Goldmann Museum and House of the Diasporas, [[Tel Aviv University|University of Tel Aviv]], [[Israel|State of Israel]].

=== The Sephardic diaspora and the Jewish identity continuity ===
Most of the expelled Jews settled in [[North Africa]], sometimes via [[Portugal]], or in nearby states, such as the [[Kingdom of Portugal]], the [[Kingdom of Navarre]], or in the Italian states. As of the first two kingdoms also they were expelled to them in 1497 and in 1498 respectively, they had to emigrate again. Those of Navarre settled in [[Baiona, Pontevedra|Bayona]] for the most part. And those of Portugal ended up in northern Europe (England or Flanders).

In North Africa, those who went to the [[Wattasid dynasty|Fez kingdom]] suffered all kinds of ill-treatment and were plundered, even by the Jews who had lived there for a long time. Those who fought the best were those who settled in the territories of the Ottoman Empire, both in North Africa and in the [[Middle East]], as in the [[Balkans]] and the [[Republic of Ragusa]], after having passed by [[Italy]]. The sultan gave orders to be welcomed and his successor [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Soliman the Magnificent]] exclaimed on one occasion referring to King Ferdinand: "You call him king who impoverishes his states to enrich the mine?" This same sultan commented to the ambassador sent by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Carlos V]] who marveled that "they had cast the Jews of Castile, because it was to throw the wealth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Perez|2013|P=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As some Jews identified Spain and the Iberian Peninsula with Biblical [[Sepharad]], the Jews expelled by the Catholic Monarchs took or received the name of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]]. These, in addition to their religion, They also kept many of their ancestral customs, and in particular they have preserved the use of the Spanish language, a language which, of course, is not exactly what was spoken in fifteenth-century Spain: like any living language, it evolved and suffered the passage of time, notable alterations, although the structures and essential characteristics remained those of the Castilian late medieval. [...] The Sephardi never forgot the land of their parents, sheltering for her mixed feelings: on the one hand, the resentment for the tragic ones events of 1492, on the other hand, walking the time, the nostalgia of the lost homeland ...".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pérez|2013|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About judeoespañol as a socio-cultural and identity phenomenon, Garcia-Pelayo and Gross wrote in the twentieth century:

{{quote|It is said of the Jews expelled from Spain in the s. XV and that preserve in the East the language and the Spanish traditions. The expulsion of the Jews [...] sent a large number of families out of the Iberian Peninsula, mainly from Andalusia and Castile, to settle in the eastern Mediterranean countries dominated by the Turks, where they formed colonies which have survived to this day, especially in [[Egypt]], [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], [[Turkey]], [[Greece]], [[Bulgaria]] [...]. These families, generally composed of Sephardic elements of good social standing, have maintained their religion, traditions, language and even their own literature for four and a half centuries. The Spanish that they transported, the one of Castile and Andalusia of ends of century XV, removed from all contact with the one of the Peninsula, has not participated of the evolution undergone by the one of Spain and Spanish colonial America. His phonetics presents some archaic but not degenerate forms; Its vocabulary offers countless Hebrew, Greek, Italian, Arabic, Turkish, according to the countries of residence.&lt;ref&gt;Ramón García-Pelayo y Gross, ''Pequeño Larousse Ilustrado'', Buenos Aires y México: Larousse, 1977, pp. 603-604.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Abm2.jpg|thumb|300px|A photo showing a boy jumping into a body of water. It is widely believed that humans make decisions (e.g. jumping in the water) based on free will.]]

'''Free will''' is the ability to [[Choice|choose]] between different possible courses of [[Action (philosophy)|action]] unimpeded.&lt;ref&gt;Omoregie, J. (2015).
 Freewill: The degree of freedom within. UK: Author House | {{ISBN|9781504987516}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hegeler, Edward C. (1910). ''The Monist'', Vol. 20. Open Court. p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

Free will is closely linked to the concepts of [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]], [[praise]], [[Culpability|guilt]], [[sin]], and other judgements which apply only to actions that are freely chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/area.12339|title = Demonic geographies| journal=Area| volume=49| issue=4| pages=503–509|year = 2017|last1 = Simandan|first1 = Dragos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumeister, R.F 2014. pp. 1-52"&gt;Baumeister, R.F. and Monroe, A.E., 2014. Recent research on free will: Conceptualizations, beliefs, and processes. In Advances in Experimental Social Psychology (Vol. 50, pp. 1-52). Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also connected with the concepts of [[Advice (opinion)|advice]], [[persuasion]], [[deliberation]], and [[Prohibitionism|prohibition]]. Traditionally, only actions that are freely [[Will (philosophy)|will]]ed are seen as deserving credit or blame. There are numerous different concerns about threats to the possibility of free will, varying by how exactly it is conceived, which is a matter of some debate.

Some conceive free will to be the capacity to make choices in which the outcome has not been determined by past events. [[Determinism]] suggests that only one course of events is possible, which is inconsistent with the existence of free will thus conceived.&lt;ref name="Baumeister, R.F 2014. pp. 1-52"/&gt; This problem has been identified in [[ancient Greek philosophy]]&lt;ref name=bobzien1998determinism /&gt; and remains a major focus of philosophical debate. This view that conceives free will to be incompatible with determinism is called ''[[incompatibilism]]'' and encompasses both [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|metaphysical libertarianism]], the claim that determinism is false and thus free will is at least possible, and [[hard determinism]], the claim that determinism is true and thus free will is not possible. It also encompasses [[hard incompatibilism]], which holds not only determinism but also its negation to be incompatible with free will and thus free will to be impossible whatever the case may be regarding determinism.

In contrast, ''[[compatibilism|compatibilists]]'' hold that free will ''is'' compatible with determinism. Some compatibilists even hold that determinism is ''necessary'' for free will, arguing that choice involves preference for one course of action over another, requiring a sense of ''how'' choices will turn out.&lt;ref name=Carnap&gt;An argument by [[Rudolph Carnap]] described by: {{cite book |title=Research In Psychology: Methods and Design |author=C.

Contemporary compatibilists instead identify free will as a psychological capacity, such as to direct one's behavior in a way responsive to reason, and there are still further different conceptions of free will, each with their own concerns, sharing only the common feature of not finding the possibility of determinism a threat to the possibility of free will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/compatibilism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first1=Michael|last1=McKenna|first2=D.

A different approach to the dilemma is that of [[incompatibilism|incompatibilists]], namely, that if the world is deterministic, then our feeling that we are free to choose an action is simply an [[hard determinism|illusion]]. [[Metaphysical libertarianism]] is the form of incompatibilism which posits that [[determinism]] is false and free will is possible (at least some people have free will).&lt;ref name="stanfordcompatibilism" /&gt; This view is associated with [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|non-materialist]] constructions,&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt; including both traditional [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Substance or Cartesian dualism|dualism]], as well as models supporting more minimal criteria; such as the ability to consciously veto an action or competing desire.&lt;ref name="Libet 2003"&gt;Libet, (2003).

Below are the classic arguments bearing upon the dilemma and its underpinnings.

===Incompatibilism===
{{Main|Incompatibilism}}
Incompatibilism is the position that free will and determinism are logically incompatible, and that the major question regarding whether or not people have free will is thus whether or not their actions are determined. "Hard determinists", such as [[Baron d'Holbach|d'Holbach]], are those incompatibilists who accept determinism and reject free will. In contrast, "[[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|metaphysical libertarians]]", such as [[Thomas Reid]], [[Peter van Inwagen]], and [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]], are those incompatibilists who accept free will and deny determinism, holding the view that some form of indeterminism is true.&lt;ref name="Wagen"&gt;van Invagen, P. (1983) ''An Essay on Free Will''. Oxford: [[Clarendon Press]]. {{ISBN|0-19-824924-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another view is that of hard incompatibilists, which state that free will is incompatible with both [[determinism]] and [[indeterminism]].&lt;ref name="Derk1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pereboom, D. |year=2003 |title=Living without Free Will |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9sKZ1rAO2BwC&amp;printsec=frontcover |isbn=0521791987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional arguments for incompatibilism are based on an "[[intuition pump]]": if a person is like other mechanical things that are determined in their behavior such as a wind-up toy, a billiard ball, a puppet, or a robot, then people must not have free will.&lt;ref name="Wagen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fischer | first1 = J.M. | year = 1983 | title = Incompatibilism | url = | journal = Philosophical Studies | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 121–37 | doi = 10.1007/BF01112527 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has been rejected by compatibilists such as Daniel Dennett on the grounds that, even if humans have something in common with these things, it remains possible and plausible that we are different from such objects in important ways.&lt;ref name="DD1"/&gt;

Another argument for incompatibilism is that of the "causal chain". Incompatibilism is key to the idealist theory of free will. Most incompatibilists reject the idea that freedom of action consists simply in "voluntary" behavior. They insist, rather, that free will means that man must be the "ultimate" or "originating" cause of his actions. He must be ''[[causa sui]]'', in the traditional phrase. Being responsible for one's choices is the first cause of those choices, where first cause means that there is no antecedent cause of that cause. The argument, then, is that if man has free will, then man is the ultimate cause of his actions. If determinism is true, then all of man's choices are caused by events and facts outside his control. So, if everything man does is caused by events and facts outside his control, then he cannot be the ultimate cause of his actions. Therefore, he cannot have free will.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, R. (1996) ''The Significance of Free Will'', Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-512656-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, C. A. (1957) ''On Selfhood and Godhood'', London: George Allen and Unwin. {{ISBN|0-415-29624-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, J. P. (1943) ''Being and Nothingness'', reprint 1993. New York: Washington Square Press. Sartre also provides a psychological version of the argument by claiming that if man's actions are not his own, he would be in ''bad faith''.&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has also been challenged by various compatibilist philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, R.M. (1994) ''The Metaphysics of Free Will'', Oxford:Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bok, H. (1998) ''Freedom and Responsibility'', Princeton:Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-01566-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third argument for incompatibilism was formulated by [[Carl Ginet]] in the 1960s and has received much attention in the modern literature. The simplified argument runs along these lines: if determinism is true, then we have no control over the events of the past that determined our present state and no control over the laws of nature. Since we can have no control over these matters, we also can have no control over the ''consequences'' of them. Since our present choices and acts, under determinism, are the necessary consequences of the past and the laws of nature, then we have no control over them and, hence, no free will. This is called the ''consequence argument''.&lt;ref&gt;Ginet, C. (1966) "Might We Have No Choice?" In Lehrer, 1966: 87–104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ving"&gt;Van Inwagen, P. and Zimmerman, D. (1998) ''Metaphysics: The Big Questions''. Oxford: Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; Peter van Inwagen remarks that C.D. Broad had a version of the consequence argument as early as the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Inwagen, P. (n.d.) [http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/HowThinkFW.doc "How to think about free will"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911064556/http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/HowThinkFW.doc |date=2008-09-11 }}, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The difficulty of this argument for some compatibilists lies in the fact that it entails the impossibility that one could have chosen other than one has. For example, if Jane is a compatibilist and she has just sat down on the sofa, then she is committed to the claim that she could have remained standing, if she had so desired. But it [[Logical consequence|follows from]] the consequence argument that, if Jane had remained standing, she would have either generated a contradiction, violated the laws of nature or changed the past. Hence, compatibilists are committed to the existence of "incredible abilities", according to Ginet and van Inwagen. One response to this argument is that it equivocates on the notions of abilities and necessities, or that the free will evoked to make any given choice is really an illusion and the choice had been made all along, oblivious to its "decider".&lt;ref name="Ving"/&gt; [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] suggests that compatibilists are only committed to the ability to do something otherwise if ''different circumstances'' had actually obtained in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1755-2567.1981.tb00473.x | last1 = Lewis | first1 = D. | year = 2008| title = Are We Free to Break the Laws? | url = | journal = Theoria | volume = 47 | issue = 3| pages = 113–21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using ''T'', ''F'' for "true" and "false" and ''?'' for undecided, there are exactly nine positions regarding determinism/free will that consist of any two of these three possibilities:&lt;ref name=Strawson&gt;

''Incompatibilism'' may occupy any of the nine positions except (5), (8) or (3), which last corresponds to ''soft determinism''. Position (1) is ''hard determinism'', and position (2) is ''libertarianism''. The position (1) of hard determinism adds to the table the contention that ''D'' implies ''FW'' is untrue, and the position (2) of libertarianism adds the contention that ''FW'' implies ''D'' is untrue. Position (9) may be called ''hard incompatibilism'' if one interprets ''?'' as meaning both concepts are of dubious value. ''Compatibilism'' itself may occupy any of the nine positions, that is, there is no logical contradiction between determinism and free will, and either or both may be true or false in principle. However, the most common meaning attached to ''compatibilism'' is that some form of determinism is true and yet we have some form of free will, position (3).&lt;ref name=FischerFour2009&gt;{{cite book |pages=44 ''ff'' |author= Fischer, John Martin |title=Four Views on Free Will (Great Debates in Philosophy) |isbn=1405134860 |year=2009 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |chapter=Chapter 2: Compatibilism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Rosenberg|Alex Rosenberg]] makes an extrapolation of physical determinism as inferred on the macroscopic scale by the behaviour of a set of dominoes to neural activity in the brain where; "If the brain is nothing but a complex physical object whose states are as much governed by physical laws as any other physical object, then what goes on in our heads is as fixed and determined by prior events as what goes on when one domino topples another in a long row of them."&lt;ref name=Rosenberg&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Determinism#Quantum mechanics and classical physics|Physical determinism]] is currently disputed by prominent [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretations]] of [[quantum mechanics]], and while not necessarily representative of intrinsic [[indeterminism]] in nature, fundamental limits of precision in measurement are inherent in the [[uncertainty principle]].&lt;ref name="Bohr1"/&gt; The relevance of such prospective indeterminate activity to free will is, however, contested,&lt;ref name="Bohr"/&gt; even when chaos theory is introduced to magnify the effects of such microscopic events.&lt;ref name="RKane1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1142/S0219635206001112 | last=Lewis | first=E.R. |author2=MacGregor, R.J. | year=2006 | title=On Indeterminism, Chaos, and Small Number Particle Systems in the Brain | journal=[[Journal of Integrative Neuroscience]] | volume=5 | issue=2 | pages=223–47 |url=http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~lewis/LewisMacGregor.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although hard determinism generally refers to [[nomological determinism]] (see causal determinism below), it can include all forms of determinism that necessitate the future in its entirety.&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010 /&gt; Relevant forms of determinism include:

If the laws of nature were determinate, then such an entity would be able to use this knowledge to foresee the future, down to the smallest detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-4975.1993.tb00266.x | last1 = Suppes | first1 = P. | year = 1993 | title = The Transcendental Character of Determinism | url = | journal = Midwest Studies in Philosophy | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 242–57 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=determinism&gt;

;[[Logical determinism]]: The notion that all [[proposition]]s, whether about the past, present or future, are either true or false. The problem of free will, in this context, is the problem of how choices can be free, given that what one does in the future is already determined as true or false in the present.&lt;ref name="Viv"/&gt;
;[[Theological determinism]]: The idea that the future is already determined, either by a [[creator deity]] decreeing or [[omniscience|knowing]] its outcome in advance.&lt;ref name = "FischerGod1989"&gt;Fischer, John Martin (1989) ''God, Foreknowledge and Freedom''.

Other forms of determinism are more relevant to compatibilism, such as [[biological determinism]], the idea that all behaviors, beliefs, and desires are fixed by our genetic endowment and our biochemical makeup, the latter of which is affected by both genes and environment, [[cultural determinism]] and [[psychological determinism]].&lt;ref name="Viv"/&gt; Combinations and syntheses of determinist theses, such as bio-environmental determinism, are even more common.

Red circles represent mental states; blue circles represent physical states; arrows describe causal interaction.]]

[[libertarianism (metaphysics)|Metaphysical libertarianism]] is one philosophical view point under that of incompatibilism. Libertarianism holds onto a concept of free will that requires that the [[agency (philosophy)|agent]] be able to take more than one possible course of action under a given set of circumstances.

Accounts of libertarianism subdivide into non-physical theories and physical or naturalistic theories. Non-physical theories hold that the events in the brain that lead to the performance of actions do not have an entirely physical explanation, which requires that the world is not closed under physics. This includes [[interactionist dualism]], which claims that some non-physical [[mind]], will, or [[soul]] overrides physical [[causality]]. Physical determinism implies there is only one possible future and is therefore not compatible with libertarian free will. As consequent of incompatibilism, metaphysical libertarian explanations that do not involve dispensing with [[physicalism]] require physical indeterminism, such as probabilistic subatomic particle behavior&amp;nbsp;– theory unknown to many of the early writers on free will. Incompatibilist theories can be categorised based on the type of indeterminism they require; uncaused events, non-deterministically caused events, and agent/substance-caused events.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Randolph |first=Clarke |editor=Edward N. Zalta | title=Incompatibilist (Nondeterministic) Theories of Free Will | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| edition=Fall 2008 | year=2008 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/incompatibilism-theories}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-causal theories====
Non-causal accounts of incompatibilist free will do not require a free action to be caused by either an agent or a physical event. They either rely upon a world that is not causally closed, or physical indeterminism. Non-causal accounts often claim that each intentional action requires a choice or volition&amp;nbsp;– a willing, trying, or endeavoring on behalf of the agent (such as the cognitive component of lifting one's arm).&lt;ref name=LumerNannini2007&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christoph Lumer|author2=Sandro Nannini|title=Intentionality, Deliberation and Autonomy: The Action-Theoretic Basis of Practical Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4LzldxvSk4kC|accessdate=27 December 2012|date=30 November 2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-6058-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McCann1998&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh McCann|title=The Works of Agency: On Human Action, Will, and Freedom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a7HZT-MrFvwC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1998|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8583-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such intentional actions are interpreted as free actions. It has been suggested, however, that such acting cannot be said to exercise control over anything in particular. According to non-causal accounts, the causation by the agent cannot be analysed in terms of causation by mental states or events, including desire, belief, intention of something in particular, but rather is considered a matter of spontaneity and creativity. The exercise of intent in such intentional actions is not that which determines their freedom&amp;nbsp;– intentional actions are rather self-generating. The "actish feel" of some intentional actions do not "constitute that event's activeness, or the agent's exercise of active control", rather they "might be brought about by direct stimulation of someone's brain, in the absence of any relevant desire or intention on the part of that person".&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories /&gt; Another question raised by such non-causal theory, is how an agent acts upon reason, if the said intentional actions are spontaneous.

Some non-causal explanations involve invoking [[panpsychism]], the theory that a quality of [[mind]] is associated with all particles, and pervades the entire universe, in both animate and inanimate entities.

====Event-causal theories====

Event-causal accounts of incompatibilist free will typically rely upon physicalist models of mind (like those of the compatibilist), yet they presuppose physical indeterminism, in which certain indeterministic events are said to be caused by the agent. A number of event-causal accounts of free will have been created, referenced here as ''deliberative indeterminism'', ''centred accounts'', and ''efforts of will theory''.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories /&gt; The first two accounts do not require free will to be a fundamental constituent of the universe. Ordinary randomness is appealed to as supplying the "elbow room" that libertarians believe necessary. A first common objection to event-causal accounts is that the indeterminism could be destructive and could therefore diminish control by the agent rather than provide it (related to the problem of origination). A second common objection to these models is that it is questionable whether such indeterminism could add any value to deliberation over that which is already present in a deterministic world.

''Deliberative indeterminism'' asserts that the indeterminism is confined to an earlier stage in the decision process.&lt;ref name=Ekstrom2000&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Waddell Ekstrom|title=Free Will: A Philosophical Study|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oaOpa7qlz3kC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=2000|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-8133-9093-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mele2006&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfred R.

The selection process is deterministic, although it may be based on earlier preferences established by the same process. Deliberative indeterminism has been referenced by [[Daniel Dennett]]&lt;ref name="Dennett1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Clement Dennett|title=Brainstorms: Philosophical Essays on Mind and Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xwObaAZEwoC|accessdate=27 December 2012|date=13 July 1981|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-54037-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Martin Fischer]].&lt;ref name="L.

''Centred accounts'' propose that for any given decision between two possibilities, the strength of reason will be considered for each option, yet there is still a probability the weaker candidate will be chosen.&lt;ref name=Kane2005&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Kane|title=Free Will|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9BRiQgAACAAJ|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-514970-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Balaguer1999&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mark Balaguer |title=Libertarianism as a Scientifically Reputable View |journal= Philosophical Studies |volume=93 |issue=2 |pages=189–211 |year=1999 |doi=10.1023/a:1004218827363}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nozick1981&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Nozick|title=Philosophical Explanations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N4zH86WogYwC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1981|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-66479-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sorabji1980&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Sorabji|title=Necessity, Cause, and Blame: Perspectives on Aristotle's Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-8tmAAAACAAJ|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1980|publisher=Duckworth|isbn=978-0-7156-1549-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Inwagen1983&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Van Inwagen|title=An Essay on Free Will|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=of1sJaUSdcYC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1983|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-824924-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wiggins1973&gt;{{cite book|author=Ted Honderich|title=Essays on Freedom of Action:Towards a Reasonable Libertarianism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qY9AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1973|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|isbn=978-0-7100-7392-1|pages=33–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Searle2001&gt;{{cite book|author=John R.

''Efforts of will theory'' is related to the role of will power in decision making. It suggests that the indeterminacy of agent volition processes could map to the indeterminacy of certain physical events&amp;nbsp;– and the outcomes of these events could therefore be considered caused by the agent. Models of [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] have been constructed in which it is seen as a particular kind of complex, high-level process with an element of physical indeterminism. An example of this approach is that of [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]], where he hypothesizes that "in each case, the indeterminism is functioning as a hindrance or obstacle to her realizing one of her purposes&amp;nbsp;– a hindrance or obstacle in the form of resistance within her will which must be overcome by effort."&lt;ref name="RKane1"&gt;{{Cite book| title=Four Views on Free Will (Libertarianism)| last=Kane| first=Robert|author2=John Martin Fischer |author3=Derk Pereboom |author4=Manuel Vargas | year=2007| publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Oxford UK| page=39| isbn=1-4051-3486-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Robert Kane such "ultimate responsibility" is a required condition for free will.&lt;ref name="Kane1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Kane|title=The Significance of Free Will|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hhuyeYKsWAkC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510550-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important factor in such a theory is that the agent cannot be reduced to physical neuronal events, but rather mental processes are said to provide an equally valid account of the determination of outcome as their physical processes (see [[non-reductive physicalism]]).

Although at the time [[quantum mechanics]] (and physical [[Quantum indeterminacy|indeterminism]]) was only in the initial stages of acceptance, in his book [[Miracles (book)|''Miracles: A preliminary study'']] C.S. Lewis stated the logical possibility that if the physical world were proved indeterministic this would provide an entry point to describe an action of a non-physical entity on physical reality.&lt;ref name="CSLewis1"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Lewis, C.S. | title=Miracles | year=1947| page=24| isbn=0-688-17369-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indeterminism|Indeterministic]] physical models (particularly those involving [[quantum indeterminacy]]) introduce random occurrences at an atomic or subatomic level. These events might affect brain activity, and could seemingly allow [[Incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] free will if the apparent indeterminacy of some mental processes (for instance, subjective perceptions of control in conscious [[Volition (psychology)|volition]]) map to the underlying indeterminacy of the physical construct. This relationship, however, requires a causative role over probabilities that is questionable,&lt;ref name=quantum&gt;{{cite book |title=Four Views on Free Will (Great Debates in Philosophy) |chapter=Libertarianism |author= Kane, Robert|page=9 |quote=It would seem that undetermined events in the brain or body would occur ''spontaneously'' and would be more likely to ''undermine'' our freedom rather than ''enhance'' it. |isbn=1405134860 |year=2007 |publisher= Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is far from established that brain activity responsible for human action can be affected by such events. Secondarily, these incompatibilist models are dependent upon the relationship between action and conscious volition, as studied in the [[neuroscience of free will]]. It is evident that observation may disturb the outcome of the observation itself, rendering limited our ability to identify causality.&lt;ref name=Bohr1&gt;{{cite web |author=Niels Bohr |title= The Atomic Theory and the Fundamental Principles underlying the Description of Nature; ''Based on a lecture to the Scandinavian Meeting of Natural Scientists and published in Danish in Fysisk Tidsskrift in 1929.

Secondly, it has been questioned whether physical events can be caused by an external substance or mind&amp;nbsp;– a common problem associated with [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|interactionalist dualism]].

====Hard incompatibilism====
Hard incompatibilism is the idea that free will cannot exist, whether the world is deterministic or not. [[Derk Pereboom (philosopher)|Derk Pereboom]] has defended hard incompatibilism, identifying a variety of positions where free will is irrelevant to indeterminism/determinism, among them the following:
:#Determinism (D) is true, D does not imply we lack free will (F), but in fact we do lack F.
:#D is true, D does not imply we lack F, but in fact we don't know if we have F.
:#D is true, and we do have F.
:#D is true, we have F, and F implies D.
:#D is unproven, but we have F.
:#D isn't true, we do have F, and would have F even if D were true.
:#D isn't true, we don't have F, but F is compatible with D.
::::::Derk Pereboom, ''Living without Free Will'',&lt;ref name="Derk1"/&gt; p. xvi.
Pereboom calls positions 3 and 4 ''soft determinism'', position 1 a form of ''hard determinism'', position 6 a form of ''classical libertarianism'', and any position that includes having F as ''compatibilism''.

[[John Locke]] denied that the phrase "free will" made any sense (compare with [[theological noncognitivism]], a similar stance on the [[existence of God]]). He also took the view that the truth of determinism was irrelevant. He believed that the defining feature of voluntary behavior was that individuals have the ability to ''postpone'' a decision long enough to reflect or deliberate upon the consequences of a choice: "... the will in truth, signifies nothing but a power, or ability, to prefer or choose".&lt;ref&gt;Locke, J. (1689). ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding'' (1998, ed). Book II, Chap. XXI, Sec. 17. Penguin Classics, Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary philosopher [[Galen Strawson]] agrees with Locke that the truth or falsity of determinism is irrelevant to the
problem.&lt;ref name="GStraw"&gt;Strawson, G. (1998, 2004). "Free will". In E. Craig (ed.), ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. London: Routledge. Retrieved August 17, 2006, [http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014 ((online))] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825055350/http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014 |date=2007-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the notion of free will leads to an infinite regress and is therefore senseless.
According to Strawson, if one is responsible for what one does in a given situation, then one must be responsible for the way one is in certain mental respects. But it is impossible for one to be responsible for the way one is in any respect. This is because to be responsible in some situation ''S'', one must have been responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''. To be responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;'', one must have been responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;'', and so on. At some point in the chain, there must have been an act of origination of a new causal chain. But this is impossible. Man cannot create himself or his mental states ''[[ex nihilo]]''. This argument entails that free will itself is absurd, but not that it is incompatible with determinism. Strawson calls his own view "pessimism" but it can be classified as [[hard incompatibilism]].&lt;ref name="GStraw"/&gt;

====Related philosophical issues====

=====High-level determinism and free will=====
======Causal determinism======
{{Main|Determinism}}

Causal determinism is the concept that [[Event (philosophy)|events]] within a given [[paradigm]] are bound by [[causality]] in such a way that any state (of an object or event) is completely determined by prior states. Causal determinism proposes that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrences stretching back to the origin of the universe. Causal determinists believe that there is nothing uncaused or [[Causa sui|self-caused]]. The most common form of causal determinism is nomological determinism (or scientific determinism), the notion that the past and the present dictate the future entirely and necessarily by rigid natural laws, that every occurrence results inevitably from prior events. [[Quantum mechanics]] poses a serious challenge to this view.

Fundamental debate continues over whether the physical universe is likely to be [[causal determinism|deterministic]]. Although the scientific method cannot be used to rule out [[indeterminism]] with respect to violations of [[causal closure]], it can be used to identify indeterminism in natural law. [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics]] at present are both [[deterministic system|deterministic]] and [[indeterminism|indeterministic]], and are being constrained by ongoing experimentation.&lt;ref name=GroblacherPaterek2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Groblacher|first1=Simon|last2=Paterek|first2=Tomasz|last3=Kaltenbaek|first3=Rainer|last4=Brukner|first4=Caslav|last5=Zukowski|first5=Marek|last6=Aspelmeyer|first6=Markus|last7=Zeilinger|first7=Anton|title=An experimental test of non-local realism|journal=Nature|volume=446|issue=7138|year=2007|pages=871–75|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/nature05677|pmid=17443179|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.2529|arxiv=0704.2529|bibcode=2007Natur.446..871G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Destiny and fate======
{{Main|Destiny}}

Destiny or fate is a predetermined course of events. It may be conceived as a predetermined future, whether in general or of an individual. It is a concept based on the belief that there is a fixed natural order to the cosmos.

Although often used interchangeably, the words "fate" and "destiny" have distinct connotations.

[[Fate]] generally implies there is a set course that cannot be deviated from, and over which one has no control. Fate is related to [[determinism]], but makes no specific claim of physical determinism. Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be fated externally (see for instance [[theological determinism]]). Destiny likewise is related to determinism, but makes no specific claim of physical determinism. Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be destined to occur.

[[Destiny]] implies there is a set course that cannot be deviated from, but does not of itself make any claim with respect to the setting of that course (i.e., it does not necessarily conflict with [[incompatibilist]] free will). Free will if existent could be the mechanism by which that destined outcome is chosen (determined to represent destiny).&lt;ref name="Blackwell2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben C. Blackwell|title=Christosis: Pauline Soteriology in Light of Deification in Irenaeus and Cyril of Alexandria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDZxSq9nx4IC|accessdate=8 December 2012|date=21 December 2011|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|isbn=978-3-16-151672-6|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Logical determinism======
{{See also|B-theory of time}}
Discussion regarding destiny does not necessitate the existence of supernatural powers. Logical [[determinism]] or determinateness is the notion that all propositions, whether about the past, present, or future, are either true or false. This creates a unique problem for free will given that propositions about the future already have a truth value in the present (that is it is already determined as either true or false), and is referred to as the [[problem of future contingents]].

======Omniscience======
{{Main|Omniscience}}

[[Omniscience]] is the capacity to know everything that there is to know (included in which are all future events), and is a property often attributed to a creator deity. Omniscience implies the existence of destiny. Some authors have claimed that free will cannot coexist with omniscience. One argument asserts that an omniscient creator not only implies destiny but a form of high level [[predeterminism]] such as hard [[theological determinism]] or [[predestination]]&amp;nbsp;– that they have independently fixed all events and outcomes in the universe in advance. In such a case, even if an individual could have influence over their lower level physical system, their choices in regard to this cannot be their own, as is the case with libertarian free will. Omniscience features as an [[incompatible-properties argument]] for the existence of [[God]], known as the [[argument from free will]], and is closely related to other such arguments, for example the incompatibility of [[omnipotence]] with a good creator deity (i.e. if a deity knew what they were going to choose, then they are responsible for letting them choose it).

=====Predeterminism=====
{{Main|Predeterminism}}
{{See also|Predestination}}

[[Predeterminism]] is the idea that all events are determined in advance.&lt;ref name="McKewan"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=McKewan |first=Jaclyn |editor=H. James Birx"|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Time: Science, Philosophy, Theology, &amp; Culture |title=Predeterminism |year=2009 |publisher=SAGE Publications|doi=10.4135/9781412963961.n191 |pages=1035–36|chapter=Evolution, Chemical |isbn=9781412941648 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionaries |title=Predeterminism |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/predeterminism |accessdate=20 December 2012 |date=April 2010 |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries}}.

Predeterminism is frequently taken to mean that human actions cannot interfere with (or have no bearing on) the outcomes of a pre-determined course of events, and that one's destiny was established externally (for example, exclusively by a creator deity). The concept of predeterminism is often argued by invoking [[causal determinism]], implying that there is an unbroken [[chain of prior occurrences]] stretching back to the origin of the universe. In the case of predeterminism, this chain of events has been pre-established, and human actions cannot interfere with the outcomes of this pre-established chain. Predeterminism can be used to mean such pre-established causal determinism, in which case it is categorised as a specific type of [[determinism]].&lt;ref name="McKewan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/notes-determinism.html |title=Some Varieties of Free Will and Determinism |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=10 September 2009 &lt;!-- date found by checking page's source code where format of date given as m.d.y --&gt;|work=Philosophy 302: Ethics |publisher=philosophy.lander.edu |accessdate=19 December 2012| quote=Predeterminism: the philosophical and theological view that combines God with determinism.

The term predeterminism suggests not just a determining of all events, but the prior and deliberately conscious determining of all events (therefore done, presumably, by a conscious being). While determinism usually refers to a naturalistically explainable causality of events, predeterminism seems by definition to suggest a person or a "someone" who is controlling or planning the causality of events before they occur and who then perhaps resides beyond the natural, causal universe. [[Predestination]] asserts that a supremely powerful being has indeed fixed all events and outcomes in the universe in advance, and is a famous doctrine of the [[Calvinists]] in [[Christian]] theology. Predestination is often considered a form of hard [[theological determinism]].

Predeterminism has therefore been compared to [[fatalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sherman, H. |title=Marx and determinism |quote=Many religions of the world have considered that the path of history is predetermined by God or Fate. On this basis, many believe that what will happen will happen, and they accept their destiny with fatalism. |journal=Journal of Economic Issues |pages=61–71 |year=1981 |jstor=4224996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fatalism is the idea that everything is fated to happen, so that humans have no control over their future.

====Theological determinism====

{{Main|Theological determinism}}

[[Theological determinism]] is a form of [[determinism]] stating that all events that happen are pre-ordained, or [[predestination|predestined]] to happen, by a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[deity]], or that they are destined to occur given its [[omniscience]]. Two forms of theological determinism exist, here referenced as strong and weak theological determinism.&lt;ref name=JordanTate2004&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anne Lockyer Jordan|author2=Anne Lockyer Jordan Neil Lockyer Edwin Tate|author3=Neil Lockyer|author4=Edwin Tate|title=Philosophy of Religion for A Level OCR Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uBVuNip8qjkC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=25 June 2004|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=978-0-7487-8078-5|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first one, strong theological determinism, is based on the concept of a [[creator deity]] dictating all events in history: "everything that happens has been predestined to happen by an omniscient, omnipotent divinity."&lt;ref name=Iannone2001&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Pabl Iannone|title=Dictionary of World Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7wBmBO3vpE4C|accessdate=22 December 2012|year=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-17995-9|page=194|chapter=determinism}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The second form, weak theological determinism, is based on the concept of divine foreknowledge&amp;nbsp;– "because [[God]]'s omniscience is perfect, what God knows about the future will inevitably happen, which means, consequently, that the future is already fixed."&lt;ref name=Huyssteen2003&gt;{{cite book|author=Wentzel Van Huyssteen|title=Encyclopedia of science and religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HIcYAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=22 December 2012|volume=1|year=2003|publisher=Macmillan Reference|isbn=978-0-02-865705-9|page=217|chapter=theological determinism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There exist slight variations on the above categorisation. Some claim that theological determinism requires [[predestination]] of all events and outcomes by the divinity (that is, they do not classify the weaker version as 'theological determinism' unless libertarian free will is assumed to be denied as a consequence), or that the weaker version does not constitute 'theological determinism' at all.&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010&gt;{{cite book|author=Raymond J. VanArragon|title=Key Terms in Philosophy of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JyTohO1AMzwC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=21 October 2010|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4411-3867-5|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theological determinism can also be seen as a form of [[causal determinism]], in which the antecedent conditions are the nature and will of God.&lt;ref name=stanfordmoralresponsibility&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Eshleman |first=Andrew |editor=Edward N. Zalta | title=Moral Responsibility | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| edition=Winter 2009 | year=2009 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2010/entries/determinism-causal}}&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to free will and the classification of theological compatibilism/incompatibilism below, "theological determinism is the thesis that God exists and has infallible knowledge of all true propositions including propositions about our future actions," more minimal criteria designed to encapsulate all forms of theological determinism.&lt;ref name="stanfordincompatibilismarguments"/&gt;

[[File:TheologicalDeterminismXFreeWill.svg|thumb|A simplified [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of philosophical positions regarding free will and theological determinism.&lt;ref name="stanfordforeknowledge" /&gt;]]
There are various implications for [[metaphysical libertarianism|metaphysical libertarian]] free will as consequent of theological determinism and its philosophical interpretation.
* Strong theological determinism is not compatible with metaphysical libertarian free will, and is a form of ''hard theological determinism'' (equivalent to theological fatalism below). It claims that free will does not exist, and ''God'' has absolute control over a person's actions. Hard theological determinism is similar in implication to [[hard determinism]], although it does not invalidate [[compatibilism|compatibilist]] free will.&lt;ref name=stanfordforeknowledge /&gt; Hard theological determinism is a form of theological incompatibilism (see figure, top left).
* Weak theological determinism is either compatible or incompatible with metaphysical libertarian free will depending upon one's philosophical interpretation of [[omniscience]]&amp;nbsp;– and as such is interpreted as either a form of hard theological determinism (known as [[theological fatalism]]), or as ''soft theological determinism'' (terminology used for clarity only). Soft theological determinism claims that humans have free will to choose their actions, holding that God, while [[omniscience|knowing their actions before they happen]], does not affect the outcome. God's providence is "compatible" with voluntary choice. Soft theological determinism is known as theological compatibilism (see figure, top right). A rejection of theological determinism (or [[omniscience|divine foreknowledge]]) is classified as theological incompatibilism also (see figure, bottom), and is relevant to a more general discussion of free will.&lt;ref name="stanfordforeknowledge"/&gt;

The basic argument for theological fatalism in the case of weak theological determinism is as follows:
# Assume divine foreknowledge or [[omniscience]]
# [[infallibility|Infallible]] foreknowledge implies destiny (it is known for certain what one will do)
# Destiny eliminates alternate possibility (one cannot do otherwise)
# Assert incompatibility with metaphysical libertarian free will

This argument is very often accepted as a basis for theological incompatibilism: denying either libertarian free will or divine foreknowledge (omniscience) and therefore theological determinism. On the other hand, theological compatibilism must attempt to find problems with it. The formal version of the argument rests on a number of premises, many of which have received some degree of contention. Theological compatibilist responses have included:
* Deny the truth value of [[Problem of future contingents|future contingents]], as proposed for example by [[Aristotle]] (although this denies foreknowledge and therefore theological determinism).
* Assert differences in non-temporal knowledge (space-time independence), an approach taken for example by [[Boethius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Boethius | title=The Consolation of Philosophy | chapter=Book V, Prose vi}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Aquinas, St. Thomas | title=Summa Theologica | chapter=Ia, q. 14, art 13.}} See [[Summa Theologica]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[C.S. Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=C.S. Lewis | title=Mere Christianity | publisher=Touchstone:New York | year=1980 | page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Deny the Principle of [[Alternative Possibilities|Alternate Possibilities]]: "If you cannot do otherwise when you do an act, you do not act freely." For example, a human observer could in principle have a machine that could detect what will happen in the future, but the existence of this machine or their use of it has no influence on the outcomes of events.&lt;ref name=zagzebski1991&gt;{{cite book|author=Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski|title=The Dilemma of Freedom and Foreknowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0v9nLMBtGYcC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=25 April 1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510763-0|chapter=chapter 6, section 2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the definition of [[compatibilism]] and [[incompatibilism]], the literature often fails to distinguish between physical determinism and higher level forms of determinism (predeterminism, theological determinism, etc.) As such, hard determinism with respect to theological determinism (or "Hard Theological Determinism" above) might be classified as hard incompatibilism with respect to physical determinism (if no claim was made regarding the internal causality or determinism of the universe), or even compatibilism (if freedom from the constraint of determinism was not considered necessary for free will), if not hard determinism itself. By the same principle, metaphysical libertarianism (a form of incompatibilism with respect to physical determinism) might be classified as compatibilism with respect to theological determinism (if it was assumed such free will events were pre-ordained and therefore were destined to occur, but of which whose outcomes were not "predestined" or determined by God). If hard theological determinism is accepted (if it was assumed instead that such outcomes were predestined by God), then metaphysical libertarianism is not, however, possible, and would require reclassification (as hard incompatibilism for example, given that the universe is still assumed to be indeterministic&amp;nbsp;– although the classification of hard determinism is technically valid also).&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010 /&gt;

=====Mind-body problem=====
{{Main|Mind–body problem}}
{{See also|Philosophy of mind|Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Monism|Physicalism}}
[[File:Frans Hals - Portret van René Descartes.jpg|thumb|upright|[[René Descartes]]]]

The idea of ''free will'' is one aspect of the [[Mind–body problem|mind-body problem]], that is, consideration of the relation between [[mind]] (for example, consciousness, memory, and judgment) and body (for example, the [[human brain]] and [[nervous system]]). [[Philosophy of Mind|Philosophical models of mind]] are divided into [[Physicalism|physical]] and non-physical expositions.

[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Substance dualism|Cartesian dualism]] holds that the mind is a nonphysical substance, the seat of consciousness and intelligence, and is not identical with physical states of the brain or body. It is suggested that although the two worlds do interact, each retains some measure of autonomy. Under cartesian dualism external mind is responsible for bodily action, although unconscious brain activity is often caused by external events (for example, the instantaneous reaction to being burned).&lt;ref name=Peruzzi&gt;See for example: {{cite book |title=Mind and Causality |chapter=Chapter 5: Mental causation and intentionality in a mind naturalizing theory |author=Sandro Nannini |editor=Alberto Peruzzi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zYEPifPTQK4C&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA77 |pages=69 ''ff'' |isbn=1588114759 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartesian dualism implies that the physical world is not deterministic&amp;nbsp;– and in which external mind controls (at least some) physical events, providing an interpretation of [[incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] free will. Stemming from Cartesian dualism, a formulation sometimes called ''[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Interactionism|interactionalist dualism]]'' suggests a two-way interaction, that some physical events cause some mental acts and some mental acts cause some physical events. One modern vision of the possible separation of mind and body is the [[Popper's three worlds|"three-world" formulation]] of [[Karl Popper|Popper]].&lt;ref name=Popper&gt;{{cite book |title=All Life is Problem Solving |chapter=Notes of a realist on the body-mind problem |author=Karl Raimund Popper |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pa3cZYwdq28C&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23 |pages=23 ''ff'' |isbn=0415174864 |year=1999 |publisher=Psychology Press |quote=The body-mind relationship...includes the problem of man's position in the physical world...'World 1'. The world of conscious human processes I shall call 'World 2', and the world of the objective creations of the human mind I shall call 'World 3'. |edition=A lecture given in Mannheim, 8 May 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartesian dualism and Popper's three worlds are two forms of what is called [[epistemological pluralism]], that is the notion that different epistemological methodologies are necessary to attain a full description of the world. Other forms of epistemological pluralist dualism include [[psychophysical parallelism]] and [[epiphenomenalism]]. Epistemological pluralism is one view in which the mind-body problem is ''not'' reducible to the concepts of the natural sciences.

A contrasting approach is called [[physicalism]]. Physicalism is a [[philosophical theory]] holding that everything that [[existence|exists]] is no more extensive than its [[physical properties]]; that is, that there are no non-physical substances (for example physically independent minds). Physicalism can be reductive or non-reductive. [[Reductive physicalism]] is grounded in the idea that everything in the world can actually be reduced analytically to its fundamental physical, or material, basis. Alternatively, [[non-reductive physicalism]] asserts that mental properties form a separate ontological class to physical properties: that mental states (such as [[qualia]]) are not ontologically reducible to physical states. Although one might suppose that mental states and neurological states are different in kind, that does not rule out the possibility that mental states are correlated with neurological states. In one such construction, [[anomalous monism]], mental events [[Supervenience|''supervene'']] on physical events, describing the [[emergence]] of mental properties correlated with physical properties&amp;nbsp;– implying causal reducibility. Non-reductive physicalism is therefore often categorised as [[property dualism]] rather than [[monism]], yet other types of property dualism do not adhere to the causal reducibility of mental states (see epiphenomenalism).

[[Incompatibilism]] requires a distinction between the mental and the physical, being a commentary on the incompatibility of (determined) physical reality and one's presumably distinct experience of will. Secondarily, [[metaphysical libertarianism|metaphysical libertarian]] free will must assert influence on physical reality, and where mind is responsible for such influence (as opposed to ordinary system randomness), it must be distinct from body to accomplish this. Both substance and property dualism offer such a distinction, and those particular models thereof that are not causally inert with respect to the physical world provide a basis for illustrating incompatibilist free will (i.e. interactionalist dualism and non-reductive physicalism).

It has been noted that the [[Physical law|laws of physics]] have yet to resolve the [[hard problem of consciousness]]:&lt;ref name=Kalat&gt;

===Compatibilism===
{{Main|Compatibilism}}
[[File:Thomas Hobbes (portrait).jpg|upright|thumb|[[Thomas Hobbes]] was a classical compatibilist.]]

Compatibilists maintain that determinism is compatible with free will. They believe freedom can be present or absent in a situation for reasons that have nothing to do with metaphysics. For instance, [[courts of law]] make judgments about whether individuals are acting under their own free will under certain circumstances without bringing in metaphysics. Similarly, [[political liberty]] is a non-metaphysical concept.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Likewise, some compatibilists define free will as freedom to act according to one's determined motives without hindrance from other individuals. So for example Aristotle in his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Susan Sauve Meyer, ''Aristotle on Moral Responsibility.'', Oxford 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and the Stoic Chrysippus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susanne Bobzien|Bobzien, Susanne]], ''Freedom and Determinism in Stoic Philosophy'', Oxford 1998, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast, the [[incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] positions are concerned with a sort of "metaphysically free will", which compatibilists claim has never been coherently defined. Compatibilists argue that determinism does not matter; though they disagree among themselves about what, in turn, ''does'' matter. To be a compatibilist, one need not endorse any particular conception of free will, but only deny that determinism is at odds with free will.&lt;ref name="CompSEP"&gt;McKenna, Michael, "Compatibilism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2004 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.),[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2004/entries/compatibilism/ ((online))]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are various impediments to exercising one's choices, free will does not imply freedom of action. Freedom of choice (freedom to select one's will) is logically separate from freedom to ''implement'' that choice (freedom to enact one's will), although not all writers observe this distinction.&lt;ref name="OConnor"/&gt; Nonetheless, some philosophers have defined free will as the absence of various impediments. Some "modern compatibilists", such as [[Harry Frankfurt]] and [[Daniel Dennett]], argue free will is simply freely choosing to do what constraints allow one to do. In other words, a coerced agent's choices can still be free if such coercion coincides with the agent's personal intentions and desires.&lt;ref name="DD1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett, D. |year=1984 |title= Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting |publisher= Bradford Books |isbn=0-262-54042-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P4NtNzOKxycC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Frankfurt&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.2307/2024717 | last1=Frankfurt |first1= H. | year=1971 | pages=5–20 |title= Freedom of the Will and the Concept of the Person | issue=1 | volume=68 |journal=Journal of Philosophy |jstor= 2024717 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as lack of physical restraint====
Most "classical compatibilists", such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], claim that a person is acting on the person's own will only when it is the desire of that person to do the act, and also possible for the person to be able to do otherwise, ''if the person had decided to''. Hobbes sometimes attributes such compatibilist freedom to each individual and not to some abstract notion of ''will'', asserting, for example, that "no liberty can be inferred to the will, desire, or inclination, but the liberty of the man; which consisteth in this, that he finds no stop, in doing what he has the will, desire, or inclination to doe{{sic}}&lt;!-- sic, that is how Hobbes wrote it; don't change to "do". --&gt;."&lt;ref name="Hobbes"&gt;Hobbes, T. (1651) ''Leviathan'' [http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=585&amp;search=%22finds+no+stop%22&amp;chapter=89860&amp;layout=html#a_2025807 Chapter XXI.: "Of the liberty of subjects"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511122711/http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=585&amp;search=%22finds+no+stop%22&amp;chapter=89860&amp;layout=html |date=2011-05-11 }} (1968 edition). London: Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt; In articulating this crucial proviso, [[David Hume]] writes, "this hypothetical liberty is universally allowed to belong to every one who is not a prisoner and in chains."&lt;ref name="Hume"&gt;Hume, D. (1740). ''A Treatise of Human Nature'' Section VIII.: "[http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=341&amp;search=%22prisoner+chains%22&amp;chapter=61966&amp;layout=html#a_606067 Of liberty and necessity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511122708/http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=341&amp;search=%22prisoner+chains%22&amp;chapter=61966&amp;layout=html |date=2011-05-11 }}" (1967 edition). [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford. {{ISBN|0-87220-230-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Voltaire]], in his ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique]]'', claimed that "Liberty then is only and can be only the power to do what one will." He asked, "would you have everything at the pleasure of a million blind caprices?" For him, free will or liberty is "only the power of acting, what is this power? It is the effect of the constitution and present state of our organs."

====Free will as a psychological state====
Compatibilism often regards the agent free as virtue of their reason. Some explanations of free will focus on the internal causality of the mind with respect to higher-order brain processing&amp;nbsp;– the interaction between conscious and unconscious brain activity.&lt;ref name=Baumeister&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford Handbook of Human Action |chapter=Chapter 23: Free Willpower: A limited resource theory of volition, choice and self-regulation |author1=Roy F Baumeister |author2=Matthew T Galliot |author3=Dianne M Tice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFP1AZYlNmcC&amp;pg=PA487&amp;lpg=PA487 |pages=487 ''ff'' |editor1=Ezequiel Morsella |editor2=John A.

&lt;/ref&gt; Compatibilist free will has also been attributed to our natural [[sense of agency]], where one must believe they are an agent in order to function and develop a [[theory of mind]].&lt;ref name="Smilansky2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Saul Smilansky|title=Free Will and Illusion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPUTQq7CUfwC|accessdate=6 February 2013|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-825018-0|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gallagher | first1 = S. | year = 2000 | title = Philosophical conceptions of the self: implications for cognitive science | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 14–21 | doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(99)01417-5| pmid = 10637618 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of levels of decision is presented in a different manner by Frankfurt.&lt;ref name=Frankfurt/&gt; Frankfurt argues for a version of compatibilism called the "hierarchical mesh". The idea is that an individual can have conflicting desires at a first-order level and also have a desire about the various first-order desires (a second-order desire) to the effect that one of the desires prevails over the others. A person's will is identified with their effective first-order desire, that is, the one they act on, and this will is free if it was the desire the person wanted to act upon, that is, the person's second-order desire was effective. So, for example, there are "wanton addicts", "unwilling addicts" and "willing addicts". All three groups may have the conflicting first-order desires to want to take the drug they are addicted to and to not want to take it.

The first group, ''wanton addicts'', have no second-order desire not to take the drug. The second group, "unwilling addicts", have a second-order desire not to take the drug, while the third group, "willing addicts", have a second-order desire to take it. According to Frankfurt, the members of the first group are devoid of will and therefore are no longer persons. The members of the second group freely desire not to take the drug, but their will is overcome by the addiction. Finally, the members of the third group willingly take the drug they are addicted to. Frankfurt's theory can ramify to any number of levels. Critics of the theory point out that there is no certainty that conflicts will not arise even at the higher-order levels of desire and preference.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, D. (1982). ''Free Will''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that Frankfurt offers no adequate explanation of how the various levels in the hierarchy mesh together.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, John Martin, and Mark Ravizza. (1998). ''Responsibility and Control: An Essay on Moral Responsibility''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as unpredictability====
In ''[[Elbow Room (book)|Elbow Room]]'', Dennett presents an argument for a compatibilist theory of free will, which he further elaborated in the book ''[[Freedom Evolves]]''.&lt;ref name="DD2"&gt;Dennett, D. (2003) ''Freedom Evolves''. Viking Books. {{ISBN|0-670-03186-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic reasoning is that, if one excludes God, an infinitely powerful [[demon]], and other such possibilities, then because of [[chaos theory|chaos]] and epistemic limits on the precision of our knowledge of the current state of the world, the future is ill-defined for all finite beings. The only well-defined things are "expectations". The ability to do "otherwise" only makes sense when dealing with these expectations, and not with some unknown and unknowable future.

According to Dennett, because individuals have the ability to act differently from what anyone expects, free will can exist.&lt;ref name="DD2"/&gt; Incompatibilists claim the problem with this idea is that we may be mere "automata responding in predictable ways to stimuli in our environment". Therefore, all of our actions are controlled by forces outside ourselves, or by random chance.&lt;ref name="Kaney"&gt;Kane, R. ''The Oxford Handbook to Free Will''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-513336-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More sophisticated analyses of compatibilist free will have been offered, as have other critiques.&lt;ref name="CompSEP"/&gt;

In the philosophy of [[decision theory]], a fundamental question is: From the standpoint of statistical outcomes, to what extent do the choices of a conscious being have the ability to influence the future? [[Newcomb's paradox]] and other philosophical problems pose questions about free will and predictable outcomes of choices.

====The physical mind====
{{See also|Neuroscience of free will}}

[[Compatibilist]] models of free will often consider deterministic relationships as discoverable in the physical world (including the brain). Cognitive [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]&lt;ref name=naturalism&gt;A key exponent of this view was [[Willard van Orman Quine]]. See {{cite web |title=Willard van Orman Quine |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/quine/ |author=Hylton, Peter |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2010 Edition) |editor= Edward N. Zalta |date=Apr 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[physicalism|physicalist]] approach to studying human [[cognition]] and [[consciousness]] in which the mind is simply part of nature, perhaps merely a feature of many very complex self-programming feedback systems (for example, [[neural networks]] and [[Cognitive robotics|cognitive robots]]), and so must be studied by the methods of empirical science, such as the [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral]] and [[cognitive science]]s (''i.e.'' [[neuroscience]] and [[cognitive psychology]]).&lt;ref name=Peruzzi/&gt;&lt;ref name=physicalism&gt;

A thoughtful list of careful distinctions regarding the application of empirical science to these issues is found in {{cite web |author=Stoljar, Daniel |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2009/entries/physicalism/#12 |title=Physicalism: §12 – Physicalism and the physicalist world picture |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2009 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |date=Sep 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive naturalism stresses the role of neurological sciences. Overall brain health, [[substance dependence]], [[Long-term depression|depression]], and various [[personality disorders]] clearly influence mental activity, and their impact upon [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] is also important.&lt;ref name=Baumeister /&gt; For example, an [[substance abuse|addict]] may experience a conscious desire to escape addiction, but be unable to do so. The "will" is disconnected from the freedom to act. This situation is related to an abnormal production and distribution of [[dopamine]] in the brain.&lt;ref name=Volkow&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The neuroscience of free will places restrictions on both compatibilist and incompatibilist free will conceptions.

Compatibilist models adhere to models of mind in which mental activity (such as deliberation) can be reduced to physical activity without any change in physical outcome. Although compatibilism is generally aligned to (or is at least compatible with) physicalism, some compatibilist models describe the natural occurrences of deterministic deliberation in the brain in terms of the first person perspective of the conscious agent performing the deliberation.&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt; Such an approach has been considered a form of identity dualism. A description of "how conscious experience might affect brains" has been provided in which "the experience of conscious free will is the first-person perspective of the neural correlates of choosing."&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt;

Recently{{when|date=August 2018}} [[Claudio Costa (philosopher)|Claudio Costa]] developed a neocompatibilist theory based on the causal theory of action that is complementary to classical compatibilism. According to him, physical, psychological and rational restrictions can interfer at different levels of the causal chain that would naturally lead to action. Corrrespondingly, there can be physical restrictions to the body, psychological restrictions to the decision, and rational restrictions to the formation of reasons (desires plus beliefs) that should lead to what we would call a reasonable action. The last two are usually called "restrictions of free will". The restriction at the level of reasons is particularly important, since it can be motivated by external reasons that are insufficiently conscious to the agent. One example was the collective suicide led by [[Jim Jones]]. The suicidal agents were not conscious that their free will have been manipulated by external, even if ungrounded, reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Claudio Costa [http://www.example''Lines of Thought: Rethinking Philosophical Assumptions''] CSP, 2014, Ch. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other views===
Some philosophers' views are difficult to categorize as either compatibilist or incompatibilist, hard determinist or libertarian. For example, [[Ted Honderich]] holds the view that "determinism is true, compatibilism and incompatibilism are both false" and the real problem lies elsewhere. Honderich maintains that determinism is true because quantum phenomena are not events or things that can be located in space and time, but are [[Abstract object|abstract]] entities. Further, even if they were micro-level events, they do not seem to have any relevance to how the world is at the macroscopic level. He maintains that incompatibilism is false because, even if indeterminism is true, incompatibilists have not provided, and cannot provide, an adequate account of origination. He rejects compatibilism because it, like incompatibilism, assumes a single, fundamental notion of freedom. There are really two notions of freedom: voluntary action and origination. Both notions are required to explain freedom of will and responsibility. Both determinism and indeterminism are threats to such freedom. To abandon these notions of freedom would be to abandon moral responsibility. On the one side, we have our intuitions; on the other, the scientific facts. The "new" problem is how to resolve this conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Honderich, T. (2001). "Determinism as True, Compatibilism and Incompatibilism as Both False and the Real Problem" in ''The Free Will Handbook'', edited by Robert Kane of the University of Texas. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as an illusion====
[[File:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|upright|Spinoza thought that there is no free will.]]
:"Experience teaches us no less clearly than reason, that men believe themselves free, simply because they are conscious of their actions, and unconscious of the causes whereby those actions are determined." [[Baruch Spinoza]], ''Ethics''&lt;ref name=Spinoza&gt;{{cite book |author= Benedict de Spinoza |year=2008 |chapter= Part III: On the origin and nature of the emotions; Postulates (Proposition II, Note) |editor= R.H.M.

David Hume discussed the possibility that the entire debate about free will is nothing more than a merely "verbal" issue. He suggested that it might be accounted for by "a false sensation or seeming experience" (a ''velleity''), which is associated with many of our actions when we perform them. On reflection, we realize that they were necessary and determined all along.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D. (1765). ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', Indianapolis: Hacket Publishing Co. Second edition. 1993. {{ISBN|0-87220-230-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schopenhauer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] claimed that phenomena have no free will but the will as [[Noumena|noumenon]], is free.]]
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] put the puzzle of free will and moral responsibility in these terms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone believes himself, ''a priori'', perfectly free&amp;nbsp;– even in his individual actions, and thinks that at every moment he can commence another manner of life. ... But ''a posteriori'', through experience, he finds to his astonishment that he is not free, but subjected to necessity, that in spite of all his resolutions and reflections he does not change his conduct, and that from the beginning of his life to the end of it, he must carry out the very character which he himself condemns...&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur, ''The Wisdom of Life'', p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In his essay ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', Schopenhauer stated, "You can do what you will, but in any given moment of your life you can ''will'' only one definite thing and absolutely nothing other than that one thing."&lt;ref&gt;[[Schopenhauer]], Arthur, ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', Oxford: Basil Blackwell {{ISBN|0-631-14552-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schopenhauer, [[phenomena]] do not have free will. However, [[Will (philosophy)|will]] [urging, craving, striving, wanting, and desiring] as [[Noumena|noumenon]] is free.

====Free will as "moral imagination"====
[[Rudolf Steiner]], who collaborated in a complete edition of Arthur Schopenhauer's work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arthur Schopenhauers sämtliche Werke in zwölf Bänden. Mit Einleitung von Dr. Rudolf Steiner, Stuttgart: Verlag der J.G. Cotta'schen Buchhandlung Nachfolger, o.J. (1894–96)|first=Rudolf|last=Steiner|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~kafka/k_s_bibII.html |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote ''The [[Philosophy of Freedom]]'', which focuses on the problem of free will. Steiner (1861–1925) initially divides this into the two aspects of freedom: ''freedom of thought'' and ''freedom of action''. The controllable and uncontrollable aspects of decision making thereby are made logically separable, as pointed out in the introduction. This separation of ''will'' from ''action'' has a very long history, going back at least as far as [[Stoicism]] and the teachings of [[Chrysippus]] (279–206 BCE), who separated external ''antecedent'' causes from the internal disposition receiving this cause.&lt;ref name=Chrysippus&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9lRD6feR3hEC&amp;pg=PA529 |page=529 |chapter=Chapter VI: The Chyrsippean notion of fate: soft determinism |author=Keimpe Algra |isbn=0521250285 |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner then argues that inner freedom is achieved when we integrate our sensory impressions, which reflect the outer appearance of the world, with our thoughts, which lend coherence to these impressions and thereby disclose to us an understandable world. Acknowledging the many influences on our choices, he nevertheless point out that they do not preclude freedom unless we fail to recognise them. Steiner argues that outer freedom is attained by permeating our deeds with ''moral imagination.” “Moral” in this case refers to action that is willed, while “imagination” refers to the mental capacity to envision conditions that do not already hold. Both of these functions are necessarily conditions for freedom. Steiner aims to show that these two aspects of inner and outer freedom are integral to one another, and that true freedom is only achieved when they are united.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, R. (1964). Rudolf Steiner Press, London, 1964, 1970, 1972, 1979, 230 pp., translated from the 12th German edition of 1962 by Michael Wilson. [http://www.rsarchive.org/Books/GA004/ ((online))]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as a pragmatically useful concept====
[[William James]]' views were ambivalent. While he believed in free will on "ethical grounds", he did not believe that there was evidence for it on scientific grounds, nor did his own introspections support it.&lt;ref&gt;See Bricklin, Jonathan, "A Variety of Religious Experience: William James and the Non-Reality of Free Will", in Libet (1999), ''The Volitional Brain: Toward a Neuroscience of Free Will'' (Thorverton UK: Imprint Academic).&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately he believed that the problem of free will was a metaphysical issue and, therefore, could not be settled by science. Moreover, he did not accept incompatibilism as formulated below; he did not believe that the indeterminism of human actions was a prerequisite of moral responsibility. In his work ''[[Pragmatism]]'', he wrote that "instinct and utility between them can safely be trusted to carry on the social business of punishment and praise" regardless of metaphysical theories.&lt;ref name="JW"&gt;James, W. (1907) ''Pragmatism'' (1979 edition). Cambridge, MA: [[Harvard University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; He did believe that indeterminism is important as a "doctrine of relief"&amp;nbsp;– it allows for the view that, although the world may be in many respects a bad place, it may, through individuals' actions, become a better one. Determinism, he argued, undermines [[meliorism]]&amp;nbsp;– the idea that progress is a real concept leading to improvement in the world.&lt;ref name="JW"/&gt;

====Free will and views of causality====
{{See also|Principle of sufficient reason}}

In 1739, [[David Hume]] in his ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' approached free will via the notion of causality. It was his position that causality was a mental construct used to explain the repeated association of events, and that one must examine more closely the relation between things ''regularly succeeding'' one another (descriptions of regularity in nature) and things that ''result'' in other things (things that cause or necessitate other things).&lt;ref name=Kane&gt;
{{cite book |title=The significance of free will |author=Robert Kane |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dBlXH3FtwJIC&amp;pg=PA226 |page= 226 |chapter=Notes to pages 74–81, note 22 |isbn=0195126564 |year=1998 |edition=Paperback}}
&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hume, 'causation' is on weak grounds: "Once we realise that 'A must bring about B' is tantamount merely to 'Due to their constant conjunction, we are psychologically certain that B will follow A,' then we are left with a very weak notion of necessity."&lt;ref name=Lorkowski&gt;{{cite web |author=CM Lorkowski |date=November 7, 2010 |title=David Hume: Causation |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hume-cau/ |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This empiricist view was often denied by trying to prove the so-called [[apriority]] of causal law (i.e. that it precedes all experience and is rooted in the construction of the perceivable world):
* [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s proof in ''Critique of Pure Reason'' (which referenced time and time ordering of causes and effects)&lt;ref&gt;Kant argued that, in order that human life is not just a "dream" (a random or projected by subjects juxtaposition of moments), the temporality of event A as before or after B must submit to a rule. An established order then implies the existence of some necessary conditions and causes, that is: sufficient bases (a so-called sufficient reason is the coincidence of all the necessary conditions). Without established causality, both [[Transcendental apperception|in subject]] and in the external world, the passing of time would be impossible, because it is essentially directional. See [[s:Critique of Pure Reason/Volume 1/Division 1#B. SECOND ANALOGY. Principle of the Succession of Time According to the Law of Causality. All changes take place according to the law of the connection of Cause and Effect.|online text of his proof]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s proof from ''The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason'' (which referenced the so-called intellectuality of representations, that is, in other words, objects and [[qualia]] perceived with senses)&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, who by the way continued and simplified Kant's system, argued (among others basing on optical illusions and the "initial processing") that it is the intellect or even the brain what generates the image of the world out of something else, by ''concluding from effects, e.g. optical, about appropriate causes'', e.g. concrete physical objects. Intellect in his works is strictly connected with recognizing causes and effects and associating them, it is somewhat close to the contemporary view of [[cerebral cortex]] and formation of associations. The intellectuality of all perception implied then of course that causality is rooted in the world, precedes and enables experience. See [[s:Page:On the Fourfold Root, and On the Will in Nature.djvu/90|online text of his proof]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1780s [[Immanuel Kant]] suggested at a minimum our decision processes with moral implications lie outside the reach of everyday causality, and lie outside the rules governing material objects.&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; "There is a sharp difference between moral judgments and judgments of fact.... Moral judgments ... must be ''a priori'' judgments."&lt;ref name=Paton&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Freeman introduces what he calls "circular causality" to "allow for the contribution of self-organizing dynamics", the "formation of macroscopic population dynamics that shapes the patterns of activity of the contributing individuals", applicable to "interactions between neurons and neural masses ... and between the behaving animal and its environment".&lt;ref name=Freeman&gt;{{cite book |title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |editor1=Susan Pockett |editor2=WP Banks |editor3=Shaun Gallagher |chapter=Consciousness, intentionality and causality |author=Freeman, Walter J. |publisher=MIT Press |year =2009 |isbn=0262512572 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5CaTnNksgkC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88 |page=88| quote=Circular causality departs so strongly from the classical tenets of necessity, invariance, and precise temporal order that the only reason to call it that is to satisfy the human habitual need for causes.... The very strong appeal of agency to explain events may come from the subjective experience of cause and effect that develops early in human life, before the acquisition of language...the question I raise here is whether brains share this property with other material objects in the world.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, mind and neurological functions are tightly coupled in a situation where feedback between collective actions (mind) and individual subsystems (for example, [[neuron]]s and their [[synapse]]s) jointly decide upon the behaviour of both.

====Free will according to Thomas Aquinas====

Thirteenth century philosopher [[Thomas Aquinas]] viewed humans as pre-programmed (by virtue of being human) to seek certain goals, but able to choose between routes to achieve these goals (our Aristotelian [[telos (philosophy)|telos]]).

In facing choices, he argued that humans are governed by ''intellect'', ''will'', and ''passions''. The will is "the primary mover of all the powers of the soul ... and it is also the efficient cause of motion in the body."&lt;ref name=Stump&gt;

A discussion of the roles of will, intellect and passions in Aquinas' teachings is found in {{cite book |title=Aquinas, ''Arguments of the philosophers series'' |author= Stump, Eleonore|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1GvL3eKhoM8C&amp;pg=PA278&amp;lpg=PA278 |pages=278 ''ff'' |isbn=0415029600 |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge (Psychology Press) |chapter= Intellect and will}}

&lt;/ref&gt; Choice falls into five stages: (i) intellectual consideration of whether an objective is desirable, (ii) intellectual consideration of means of attaining the objective, (iii) will arrives at an intent to pursue the objective, (iv) will and intellect jointly decide upon choice of means (v) will elects execution.&lt;ref name=OConnor0&gt;{{cite web |author=Timothy O'Connor |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/freewill/ |title= Free Will |work= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition) |editor= Edward N.

A compatibilist interpretation of Aquinas's view is defended thus: "Free-will is the cause of its own movement, because by his free-will man moves himself to act. But it does not of necessity belong to liberty that what is free should be the first cause of itself, as neither for one thing to be cause of another need it be the first cause. God, therefore, is the first cause, Who moves causes both natural and voluntary. And just as by moving natural causes He does not prevent their acts being natural, so by moving voluntary causes He does not deprive their actions of being voluntary: but rather is He the cause of this very thing in them; for He operates in each thing according to its own nature."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa Theologiae'', Q83 A1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Further discussion of this compatibilistic theory can be found in Thomas' ''Summa contra gentiles'', Book III about Providence, c. 88–91 (260–67), where it is postulated that everything has its cause and it is again and again in detail referred also to all individual choices of man etc., even refuting opposite views. [http://dhspriory.org/thomas/ContraGentiles3b.htm#88 Here the online text of the Summa]. In order to avoid, at least in concept, the absolution of man of any guilt he then notes the contingency of all that takes place, i.e. lack of ''direct'' necessity from God strictly with regard to a concrete ("contingent") act. A typical choice was not separately ordained to be so-and-so by God; St. Thomas says the choice is not necessary, but in fact that apparently means it was ''contingent'' with regard to God and the law of nature (as a specific case that could have not existed in other circumstances), and ''necessary'' with regard to its direct previous cause in will and intellect. (The contingency, or fortuity, is even intuitive under modern [[chaos theory]], where one can try to show that more and more developed products appearing in the evolution of a universe or, simpler, an automaton are [[chaos theory|chaotic]] with regard to its principles.)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as a pseudo-problem====

Historically, most of the philosophical effort invested in resolving the dilemma has taken the form of close examination of definitions and ambiguities in the concepts designated by "free", "freedom", "will", "choice" and so forth. Defining 'free will' often revolves around the meaning of phrases like [https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22ability+to+do+otherwise%22+%22free+will%22&amp;gws_rd=ssl "ability to do otherwise"] or [https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22alternative+possibilities%22+%22free+will%22&amp;gws_rd=ssl "alternative possibilities"]. This emphasis upon words has led some philosophers to claim the problem is merely verbal and thus a pseudo-problem.&lt;ref name=Deery&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In response, others point out the complexity of decision making and the importance of nuances in the terminology.

===History of free will===

The problem of free will has been identified in [[ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosophical]] literature. The notion of compatibilist free will has been attributed to both [[Aristotle]] (fourth century BCE) and [[Epictetus]] (1st century CE); "it was the fact that nothing hindered us from doing or choosing something that made us have control over them".&lt;ref name=bobzien1998determinism&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| last = Bobzien| first = Susanne| title = Determinism and freedom in Stoic philosophy| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 1998| url = https://books.google.com/?id=7kmTeOjHIqkC&amp;pg=PR12|quote="...Aristotle and Epictetus: In the latter authors it was the fact that nothing hindered us from doing or choosing something that made us have control over them. In Alexander's account, the terms are understood differently: what makes us have control over things is the fact that we are causally undetermined in our decision and thus can freely decide between doing/choosing or not doing/choosing them."| isbn = 9780198237945}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Bobzien| first = Susanne| title = Did Epicurus discover the free-will problem?| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 2000| url = http://philpapers.org/rec/BOBDED}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Susanne Bobzien]], the notion of incompatibilist free will is perhaps first identified in the works of [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] (third century CE); "what makes us have control over things is the fact that we are causally undetermined in our decision and thus can freely decide between doing/choosing or not doing/choosing them".

The term "free will" (''liberum arbitrium'') was introduced by Christian philosophy (4th century CE). It has traditionally meant (until the Enlightenment proposed its own meanings) lack of necessity in human will,&lt;ref&gt;A. Schopenhauer, ''On the Freedom of the Will'', c. 1, "What is freedom?"&lt;/ref&gt; so that "the will is free" meant "the will does not have to be such as it is". This requirement was universally embraced by both incompatibilists and compatibilists.&lt;ref&gt;Hence the notion of contingency appeared as the very opposition of necessity, so that wherever a thing is considered dependent or relies upon another thing, it is contingent and thus not necessary.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific approaches==

Science has contributed to the free will problem in at least three ways. First, physics has addressed the question whether nature is deterministic, which is viewed as crucial by incompatibilists (compatibilists, however, view it as irrelevant). Second, although free will can be defined in various ways, all of them involve aspects of the way people make decisions and initiate actions, which have been studied extensively by neuroscientists. Some of the experimental observations are widely viewed as implying that free will does not exist or is an illusion (but many philosophers see this as a misunderstanding). Third, psychologists have studied the beliefs that the majority of ordinary people hold about free will and its role in assigning moral responsibility.

===Quantum physics===
Early scientific thought often portrayed the universe as deterministic&amp;nbsp;– for example in the thought of [[Democritus]] or the [[Cārvāka]]ns&amp;nbsp;– and some thinkers claimed that the simple process of gathering sufficient [[physical information|information]] would allow them to predict future events with perfect accuracy. Modern science, on the other hand, is a mixture of deterministic and [[stochastic]] theories.&lt;ref&gt;Boniolo, G. and Vidali, P. (1999) ''Filosofia della Scienza'', Milan: Mondadori. {{ISBN|88-424-9359-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quantum mechanics]] predicts events only in terms of probabilities, casting doubt on whether the universe is deterministic at all, although evolution of the universal state vector is completely deterministic. Current physical theories cannot resolve the question of whether determinism is true of the world, being very far from a potential [[Theory of Everything]], and open to many different [[Interpretation of quantum mechanics|interpretations]].&lt;ref name="stanfordcausaldeterminism"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Carl |last=Hoefer |title=Causal Determinism |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=2008-04-01 |accessdate=2008-11-01 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Is the Universe Deterministic? |first=Vlatko |last=Vedral |volume=192 |issue=2578 |date=2006-11-18 |journal=New Scientist |quote=Physics is simply unable to resolve the question of free will, although, if anything, it probably leans towards determinism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming that an indeterministic interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct, one may still object that such indeterminism is for all practical purposes confined to microscopic phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytho/dfwVariousHonderichKanebook.htm |author=Honderich, E.|title= Determinism as True, Compatibilism and Incompatibilism as Both False, and the Real Problem |publisher=Ucl.ac.uk |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not always the case: many macroscopic phenomena are based on quantum effects. For instance, some [[hardware random number generator]]s work by amplifying quantum effects into practically usable signals. A more significant question is whether the indeterminism of quantum mechanics allows for the traditional idea of free will (based on a perception of free will). If a person's action is, however, only a result of complete quantum randomness, and mental processes as experienced have no influence on the probabilistic outcomes (such as volition),&lt;ref name="RKane1"/&gt; According to many interpretations, non-determinism enables free will to exist,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/quantum-physics-free-will/&lt;/ref&gt; while others assert the opposite (because the action was not controllable by the physical being who claims to possess the free will).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/features/2000/lujan1.html |title=Infidels. "Metaphysical Freedom" |publisher=Infidels.org |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetics===
Like physicists, [[biology|biologists]] have frequently addressed questions related to free will. One of the most heated debates in biology is that of "[[nature versus nurture]]", concerning the relative importance of genetics and biology as compared to culture and environment in human behavior.&lt;ref name="Pin"&gt;Pinel, P. J. (1990) ''Biopsychology''. Prentice Hall Inc. {{ISBN|88-15-07174-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view of many researchers is that many human behaviors can be explained in terms of humans' brains, genes, and evolutionary histories.&lt;ref&gt;DeFries, J.C., McGuffin, P., McClearn, G.E., Plomin, R. (2000) ''Behavioral Genetics'' 4th ed. W H Freeman &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris, D. (1967) ''The Naked Ape''. New York:McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|0-385-33430-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawk"&gt;Dawkins, R. (1976) ''The Selfish Gene''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|88-04-39318-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This point of view raises the fear that such attribution makes it impossible to hold others responsible for their actions. [[Steven Pinker]]'s view is that fear of determinism in the context of "genetics" and "evolution" is a mistake, that it is "a confusion of ''explanation'' with ''exculpation''". Responsibility does not require that behavior be uncaused, as long as behavior responds to praise and blame.&lt;ref name="Pink"&gt;Pinker, S. (2002) ''The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature''. London: Penguin. p. 179 {{ISBN|0-14-200334-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it is not certain that environmental determination is any less threatening to free will than genetic determination.&lt;ref name="Lew"&gt;Lewontin, R. (2000). ''It Ain't Necessarily So: The Dream of the Human Genome and other Illusions''. New York: NYREV Inc. {{ISBN|88-420-6418-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroscience and Neurophilosophy===
{{Main|Neurophilosophy|Neuroscience of free will}}
{{see also|Neurostimulation}}

It has become possible to study the living [[Human brain|brain]], and researchers can now watch the brain's decision-making process at work. A seminal experiment in this field was conducted by [[Benjamin Libet]] in the 1980s, in which he asked each subject to choose a random moment to flick their wrist while he measured the associated activity in their brain; in particular, the build-up of electrical signal called the [[readiness potential]] (after German [[Bereitschaftspotential]], which was discovered by [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]], 1965. Hirnpotentialänderungen bei Willkürbewegungen und passiven Bewegungen des Menschen: Bereitschaftspotential und reafferente Potentiale. Pflügers Arch 284: 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt;) Although it was well known that the readiness potential reliably preceded the physical action, Libet asked whether it could be recorded before the conscious intention to move. To determine when subjects felt the intention to move, he asked them to watch the second hand of a clock. After making a movement, the volunteer reported the time on the clock when they first felt the conscious intention to move; this became known as Libet's W time.&lt;ref name="LGW" /&gt;

Libet found that the ''unconscious'' brain activity of the readiness potential leading up to subjects' movements began approximately half a second before the subject was aware of a conscious intention to move.&lt;ref name="LGW"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0140525X00044903 | last1 = Libet | first1 = B. | year = 1985 | title = Unconscious cerebral initiative and the role of conscious will in voluntary action | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 529–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These studies of the timing between actions and the conscious decision bear upon the role of the brain in understanding free will. A subject's declaration of intention to move a finger appears ''after'' the brain has begun to implement the action, suggesting to some that unconsciously the brain has made the decision ''before'' the conscious mental act to do so. Some believe the implication is that free will was not involved in the decision and is an illusion. The first of these experiments reported the brain registered activity related to the move about 0.2 s before movement onset.&lt;ref name=Libet&gt;

The bearing of these results upon notions of free will appears complex.&lt;ref name=Strother&gt;{{cite journal|title=The conscious experience of action and intention |author1=Lars Strother |author2=Sukhvinder Singh Obhi |journal=Exp Brain Res |volume=198 |year=2009 |pages=535–39 |doi=10.1007/s00221-009-1946-7 |url=http://publish.uwo.ca/~lstroth/StrotherObhi_EBR_2009.pdf |issue=4 |pmid=19641911 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217013640/http://publish.uwo.ca/~lstroth/StrotherObhi_EBR_2009.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Rosenbaum&gt;A brief discussion of possible interpretation of these results is found in {{cite book |title=Human Motor Control |page=86 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MsFmds_ACBwC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86 |isbn=0123742269 |year=2009 |edition=2nd |publisher=Academic Press |author=David A. Rosenbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that placing the question of free will in the context of motor control is too narrow. The objection is that the time scales involved in motor control are very short, and motor control involves a great deal of unconscious action, with much physical movement entirely unconscious. On that basis "... free will cannot be squeezed into time frames of 150–350 ms; free will is a longer term phenomenon" and free will is a higher level activity that "cannot be captured in a description of neural activity or of muscle activation...."&lt;ref name=Gallagher&gt;{{cite book |title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |author= Gallagher, Shaun|chapter=Chapter 6: Where's the action?

More studies have since been conducted, including some that try to:
* support Libet's original findings
* suggest that the cancelling or "veto" of an action may first arise subconsciously as well
* explain the underlying brain structures involved
* suggest models that explain the relationship between conscious intention and action

[[Benjamin Libet]]'s results are quoted&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Wegner|Wegner D.]], 2002. The Illusion of Conscious Will. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; in favor of epiphenomenalism, but he believes subjects still have a "conscious veto", since the readiness potential does not invariably lead to an action. In ''[[Freedom Evolves]]'', [[Daniel Dennett]] argues that a no-free-will conclusion is based on dubious assumptions about the location of consciousness, as well as questioning the accuracy and interpretation of Libet's results. [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] underlined that absence of conscious will during the early Bereitschaftspotential (termed BP1) is not a proof of the non-existence of free will, as also unconscious agendas may be free and non-deterministic. According to their suggestion, man has relative freedom, i.e. freedom in degrees, that can be in- or decreased through deliberate choices that involve both conscious and unconscious (panencephalic) processes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]], 2012. ''The will and its brain – an appraisal of reasoned free will''. University Press of America, Lanham, MD, {{ISBN|978-0-7618-5862-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have argued that data such as the [[Bereitschaftspotential]] undermine epiphenomenalism for the same reason, that such experiments rely on a subject reporting the point in time at which a conscious experience occurs, thus relying on the subject to be able to consciously perform an action. That ability would seem to be at odds with early epiphenomenalism, which according to Huxley is the broad claim that consciousness is "completely without any power… as the steam-whistle which accompanies the work of a locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery".&lt;ref name="Flanagan1992"&gt;{{cite book |first=O.J. |last=Flanagan |year=1992 |title=Consciousness Reconsidered |series=Bradford Books |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-56077-1 |lccn=lc92010057 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yFOqQgAACAAJ |page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been shown that in several brain-related conditions, individuals cannot entirely control their own actions, though the existence of such conditions does not directly refute the existence of free will. Neuroscientific studies are valuable tools in developing models of how humans experience free will.

For example, people with [[Tourette syndrome]] and related [[tic disorder]]s make involuntary movements and utterances (called [[tic]]s) despite the fact that they would prefer not to do so when it is socially inappropriate. Tics are described as semi-voluntary or ''unvoluntary'',&lt;ref name=TSADef&gt;Tourette Syndrome Association. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050322170245/http://www.tsa-usa.org/research/definitions.html Definitions and Classification of Tic Disorders.]. Retrieved 19 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; because they are not strictly ''involuntary'': they may be experienced as a ''voluntary'' response to an unwanted, premonitory urge. Tics are experienced as irresistible and must eventually be expressed.&lt;ref name=TSADef/&gt; People with Tourette syndrome are sometimes able to suppress their tics for limited periods, but doing so often results in an explosion of tics afterward. The control exerted (from seconds to hours at a time) may merely postpone and exacerbate the ultimate expression of the tic.&lt;ref name=Zinner&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zinner | first1 = S.H. | year = 2000 | title = Tourette disorder | url = | journal = Pediatric Review | volume = 21 | issue = 11| pmid = 11077021 | pages = 372–83 | doi=10.1542/pir.21-11-372| doi-broken-date = 2018-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[alien hand syndrome]], the afflicted individual's [[limb (anatomy)|limb]] will produce unintentional movements without the will of the person. The affected limb effectively demonstrates 'a will of its own.' The [[sense of agency]] does not emerge in conjunction with the overt appearance of the purposeful act even though the sense of ownership in relationship to the body part is maintained. This phenomenon corresponds with an impairment in the premotor mechanism manifested temporally by the appearance of the readiness potential (see section on the Neuroscience of Free Will above) recordable on the scalp several hundred milliseconds before the overt appearance of a spontaneous willed movement. Using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] with specialized multivariate analyses to study the temporal dimension in the activation of the cortical network associated with voluntary movement in human subjects, an anterior-to-posterior sequential activation process beginning in the supplementary motor area on the medial surface of the frontal lobe and progressing to the primary motor cortex and then to parietal cortex has been observed.&lt;ref name=Kayser&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/hbm.20771 | last1 = Kayser | first1 = A.S. | last2 = Sun | first2 = F.T. | last3 = D'Esposito | first3 = M. | year = 2009 | title = A comparison of Granger causality and coherency in fMRI-based analysis of the motor system | url = | journal = Human Brain Mapping | volume = 30 | issue = 11| pages = 3475–94 | pmid = 19387980 | pmc = 2767459 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sense of agency]] thus appears to normally emerge in conjunction with this orderly sequential network activation incorporating premotor association cortices together with primary motor cortex. In particular, the supplementary motor complex on the medial surface of the frontal lobe appears to activate prior to primary motor cortex presumably in associated with a preparatory pre-movement process. In a recent study using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]], alien movements were characterized by a relatively isolated activation of the primary motor cortex contralateral to the alien hand, while voluntary movements of the same body part included the natural activation of motor association cortex associated with the premotor process.&lt;ref name=Assal&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/ana.21173 | last1 = Assal | first1 = F. | last2 = Schwartz | first2 = S. | last3 = Vuilleumier | first3 = P. | year = 2007 | title = Moving with or without will: Functional neural correlates of alien hand syndrome | url = | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 62 | issue = 3| pages = 301–06 | pmid = 17638304 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The clinical definition requires "feeling that one limb is foreign or has a ''will of its own,'' together with observable involuntary motor activity" (emphasis in original).&lt;ref name=Doody&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.55.9.806 | last1 = Doody | first1 = RS | last2 = Jankovic | first2 = J. | year = 1992 | title = The alien hand and related signs | url = | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 55 | issue = 9| pages = 806–10 | pmid = 1402972 | pmc = 1015106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This syndrome is often a result of damage to the [[corpus callosum]], either when it is severed to treat intractable [[epilepsy]] or due to a [[stroke]].

This is sometimes likened to being a robot controlled by someone else. Although the neural mechanisms of schizophrenia are not yet clear, one influential hypothesis is that there is a breakdown in brain systems that compare motor commands with the feedback received from the body (known as [[proprioception]]), leading to attendant [[hallucination]]s and [[delusions of control]].&lt;ref name=frith&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0165-0173(99)00052-1 | last1 = Frith | first1 = CD | last2 = Blakemore | first2 = S | last3 = Wolpert | first3 = DM | title = Explaining the symptoms of schizophrenia: abnormalities in the awareness of action | journal = Brain Research.

===Experimental psychology===
{{See also|Cognitive science|Cognitive psychology|Neuroscience}}
[[Experimental psychology]]'s contributions to the free will debate have come primarily through social psychologist [[Daniel Wegner]]'s work on conscious will. In his book, ''The Illusion of Conscious Will''&lt;ref name = "WegnerBook"&gt;Wegner, D.M. (2002). ''The illusion of conscious will.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Wegner summarizes what he believes is [[empirical evidence]] supporting the view that human perception of conscious control is an illusion. Wegner summarizes some empirical evidence that may suggest that the perception of conscious control is open to modification (or even manipulation). Wegner observes that one event is inferred to have caused a second event when two requirements are met:
# The first event immediately precedes the second event, and
# The first event is consistent with having caused the second event.
For example, if a person hears an explosion and sees a tree fall down that person is likely to infer that the explosion caused the tree to fall over. However, if the explosion occurs after the tree falls down (that is, the first requirement is not met), or rather than an explosion, the person hears the ring of a telephone (that is, the second requirement is not met), then that person is not likely to infer that either noise caused the tree to fall down.

Wegner has applied this principle to the inferences people make about their own conscious will. People typically experience a thought that is consistent with a behavior, and then they observe themselves performing this behavior. As a result, people infer that their thoughts must have caused the observed behavior. However, Wegner has been able to manipulate people's thoughts and behaviors so as to conform to or violate the two requirements for causal inference.&lt;ref name="WegnerBook"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.54.7.480 | last1 = Wegner | first1 = D.M. | last2 = Wheatley | first2 = T. | year = 1999 | title = Apparent mental causation: sources of the experience of will | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 54 | issue = 7| pages = 480–91 | pmid=10424155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through such work, Wegner has been able to show that people often experience conscious will over behaviors that they have not, in fact, caused&amp;nbsp;– and conversely, that people can be led to experience a lack of will over behaviors they did cause. For instance, [[priming (psychology)|priming]] subjects with information about an effect increases the probability that a person falsely believes is the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Emily Pronin]] has argued that the subjective experience of free will is supported by the [[introspection illusion]]. This is the tendency for people to trust the reliability of their own introspections while distrusting the introspections of other people. The theory implies that people will more readily attribute free will to themselves rather than others. This prediction has been confirmed by three of Pronin and Kugler's experiments. When college students were asked about personal decisions in their own and their roommate's lives, they regarded their own choices as less predictable. Staff at a restaurant described their co-workers' lives as more determined (having fewer future possibilities) than their own lives. When weighing up the influence of different factors on behavior, students gave desires and intentions the strongest weight for their own behavior, but rated personality traits as most predictive of other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pronin|first=Emily|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, Vol. 41|editor=Mark P. Zanna|chapter=The Introspection Illusion |volume=41|publisher=Academic Press|pages=42–43|year=2009|isbn=978-0-12-374472-2|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)00401-2|ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists have shown that reducing a person's belief in free will makes them less helpful and more aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = RF | last2 = Masicampo | first2 = EJ | last3 = Dewall | first3 = CN | year = 2009 | title = Prosocial benefits of feeling free: disbelief in free will increases aggression and reduces helpfulness | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 35 | issue = 2| pages = 260–68 | doi = 10.1177/0146167208327217 | pmid = 19141628 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may occur because the subject loses a sense of [[self-efficacy]].

Caveats have, however, been identified in studying a subject's awareness of mental events, in that the process of introspection itself may alter the experience.&lt;ref name=Pockett&gt;{{cite book|title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |chapter=The neuroscience of movement |author=Susan Pockett |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5CaTnNksgkC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19 |page=19 |editor1=Susan Pockett |editor2=WP Banks |editor3=Shaun Gallagher |publisher=MIT Press |year =2009 |isbn=0262512572|quote=...it is important to be clear about exactly what experience one wants one's subjects to introspect. Of course, explaining to subjects exactly what the experimenter wants them to experience can bring its own problems–...instructions to attend to a particular internally generated experience can easily alter both the timing and the content of that experience and even whether or not it is consciously experienced at all.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J.B. Miles]] contradicts the idea that free will has prosocial benefits, recognizing that many distinguished minds have already brought up the negative effects that such a belief would ensure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miles | first1 = J.B. | year = 2011 | title = 'Irresponsible and a Disservice': The integrity of social psychology turns on the free will dilemma | url = | journal = British Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 2| pages = 205–18 | doi = 10.1111/j.2044-8309.2011.02077.x | pmid = 22074173 | pmc = 3757306 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The explanation for the commonality of this mix-up is a lack of knowledge regarding the free will debate in psychological research. Miles analyzed the methods of popular studies and concluded that such research purported to be examining associations between behavior and disbelief in free will are actually examining the associations between behavior and belief in fatalism. While evidence of the negative effects of a belief in fatalism is legitimate, the research fails to study the effects of belief on free will which they claim to discuss. This occurrence is due to an incorrect understanding and implication that fatalism accompanies determinism. Fatalism is distinguished by the idea that decisions lack effect on the future because everything is determined. Conversely, determinism is the belief that everything operates under cause and effect; every action determines a reaction. Determinism, therefore emphasizes the importance and responsibility one has in decision making as every choice will have an accompanying effect. Seeing this flaw throughout commonly cited research, Miles presents countering research which includes “evidence that the myth of free choice encourages immoral, unjust, prejudiced, and anti-intellectual behaviour.” Miles suggests that while both extremes of fatalism and belief in free will result in negative social outcomes, determinism serves to encourage intentional, prosocial decision making. Ultimately, the point of this research is to encourage accurate knowledge of the free will debate when conducting and evaluating such studies in experimental psychology.

Regardless of the validity of, or benefit of, belief in free will, it may be beneficial to understand where the idea comes from. One contribution is randomness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ebert | first1 = J.P. | last2 = Wegner | first2 = D.M. | year = 2011 | title = March 1). Mistaking randomness for free will | url = | journal = Consciousness and Cognition | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 965–71 | doi = 10.1016/j.concog.2010.12.012 | pmid = 21367624 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is established that randomness is not the only factor in the perception of the free will, it has been shown that randomness can be mistaken as free will due to its indeterminacy. This misconception applies both when considering oneself and others. Another contribution is choice.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, G., Baumeister, R.F., &amp; Wong, K.F. (2014, July 30). Free will is about choosing: The link between choice and the belief in free will. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 55, 239–45. {{doi|10.1016/j.jesp.2014.07.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been demonstrated that people's belief in free will increases if presented with a simple level of choice. The specificity of the amount of choice is important, as too little or too great a degree of choice may negatively influence belief. It is also likely that the associative relationship between level of choice and perception of free will is influentially bidirectional. It is also possible that one's desire for control, or other basic motivational patterns, act as a third variable.

===Believing in free will{{anchor|Believing in free will}}===
In recent years, free will belief in individuals has been analysed with respect to traits in social behaviour. In general the concept of free will researched to date in this context has been that of the incompatibilist, or more specifically, the libertarian, that is freedom from determinism.

====What people believe====
Whether people naturally adhere to an incompatibilist model of free will has been questioned in the research. Eddy Nahmias has found that incompatibilism is not intuitive&amp;nbsp;– it was not adhered to, in that determinism does not negate belief in moral responsibility (based on an empirical study of people's responses to moral dilemmas under a deterministic model of reality).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nahmias|first=Eddy|author2=Stephen G Morris|author3=Thomas Nadelhoffer|author4=Jason Turner|date=2006-07-01|title=Is Incompatibilism Intuitive?|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|volume=73|issue=1|pages=28–53|doi=10.1111/j.1933-1592.2006.tb00603.x|issn=1933-1592|citeseerx=10.1.1.364.1083}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2011-04-29--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Cokely has found that incompatibilism is intuitive&amp;nbsp;– it was naturally adhered to, in that determinism does indeed negate belief in moral responsibility in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feltz|first=Adam|author2=Edward T.

Studies indicate that peoples' belief in free will is inconsistent. Emily Pronin and Matthew Kugler found that people believe they have more free will than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1012046108| pmid = 21149703| volume = 107| issue = 52| pages = 22469–74| last = Pronin| first = Emily|author2=Matthew B.

Studies also reveal a correlation between the likelihood of accepting a deterministic model of mind and personality type. For example, Adam Feltz and Edward Cokely found that people of an extrovert personality type are more likely to dissociate belief in determinism from belief in moral responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feltz|first=Adam|author2=Edward T.

[[Roy Baumeister]] and colleagues reviewed literature on the psychological effects of a belief (or disbelief) in free will. The first part of their analysis (which the only relevant part to this section) was not meant to discover the types of free will that actually exist. The researchers instead sought to identify what people believe, how many people believed it, and the effects of those beliefs. Baumeister found that most people tend to believe in a sort of "naive compatibilistic free will".&lt;ref name=BAC&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R. | last2 = Crescioni | first2 = A.W. | last3 = Alquist | first3 = J. | year = 2009 | title = Free will as advanced action control for human social life and culture | url = | journal = Neuroethics | volume =4| issue = | pages =1–11| doi = 10.1007/s12152-010-9058-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paulhus, D.L. and Margesson. A., (1994). ''Free Will and Determinism (FAD) scale''. Unpublished manuscript, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada: University of British Columbia.&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers also found that people consider acts more "free" when they involve a person opposing external forces, planning, or making random actions.&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, T.F., R.F. Baumeister, F.D. Fincham, T.E. Joiner, N.M. Lambert, A.R. Mele, and D.M. Tice. 2008. Guilty, free, and wise. Belief in free will promotes learning from negative emotions.

Randomness is too important to trust to chance. Presented at the 2007 Summer Institute in Informed Patient Choice, Dartmouth Medical School, NH&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wagenaar | first1 = W.

Taking into account all these personal variables existing in the debates over free will, Manuel Vargas has generally assumed that in fact “there is nearly always an unremarked upon elephant that lurks in rooms where philosophers discuss free will”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vargas|first=Manuel|date=2004|title=Libertarianism and Skepticism about Free Will|journal=Philosophical Topics|volume=32|issue=1|pages=403–426|doi=10.5840/philtopics2004321/210|issn=0276-2080}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he particularly pointed to the role of (i)religion in motivating and sustaining various accounts of free will. As he put,&lt;blockquote&gt;My guess is that we would learn that a disproportionate number—perhaps even most—libertarians are religious and, especially, Christian. I suspect we would also learn that the overwhelming majority of compatibilists are atheist or agnostic. (I do not have a guess about the religious predilections of the various stripes of skeptical incompatibilists.) Even so, it may not be obvious why the religious beliefs of particular philosophers should matter. We could think that the arguments of the various partisans in free will debates should be judged on their merits, irrespective of whether or not they have religious motivation. However, systematically ignoring the role of religion can remove important considerations from view, considerations that affect how we think about, argue, and evaluate the various philosophical possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;For example, by a detailed analysis of the writings and work of Arthur Eddington and Arthur Holy Compton in the English speaking world of the late 1920s and 1930s, one analysis clearly revealed not only a strong intrinsic religious motivation and specific conservative worldview concerns behind their own work on free will, but also similar personal, political and ideological factors, only of the opposite sign, in their opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Kožnjak|first=Boris|title=The Earliest Missionaries of 'Quantum Free Will': A Socio-Historical Analysis|volume=6|date=2018|work=Free Will &amp; Action|pages=131–154|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-99295-2_10|isbn=9783319992945|series=Historical-Analytical Studies on Nature, Mind and Action}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Among philosophers====
A recent 2009 survey has shown that compatibilism is quite a popular stance among those who specialize in philosophy (59%). Belief in libertarianism amounted to 14%, while a lack of belief in free will equaled 12%. More than a half of surveyed people were US Americans.&lt;ref&gt;D. Bourget, D.J. Chalmers: ''What do philosophers believe?''. Philosophical Studies (3): 1–36 (2013). [http://philpapers.org/archive/BOUWDP.pdf Online text here]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Among evolutionary biologists====
79 percent of evolutionary biologists said that they believe in free-will according to a survey conducted in 2007, only 14 percent chose no free will, and 7 percent did not answer the question.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory W. Graffin and William B. Provine, “Evolution, Religion, and Free Will,” American Scientist 95 (July–August 2007), 294–97; results of Cornell Evolution Project survey,

====Effects of the belief itself====
{{see also|Self-efficacy}}

{{Quotebox|align=right|width=40%|quoted=1|quote= An alternative explanation builds on the idea that subjects tend to confuse determinism with fatalism... What happens then when agents’ self-efficacy is undermined? It is not that their basic desires and drives are defeated. It is rather, I suggest, that they become skeptical that they can control those desires; and in the face of that skepticism, they fail to apply the effort that is needed even to try. If they were tempted to behave badly, then coming to believe in fatalism makes them less likely to resist that temptation.|source=—Richard Holton&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt;}}
Baumeister and colleagues found that provoking disbelief in free will seems to cause various negative effects. The authors concluded, in their paper, that it is belief in [[determinism]] that causes those negative effects.&lt;ref name=BAC/&gt; This may not be a very justified conclusion, however.&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt; First of all, free will can at least refer to either [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian (indeterministic) free will]] or [[Compatibilism|compatibilistic (deterministic) free will]]. Having participants read articles that simply "disprove free will" is unlikely to increase their understanding of determinism, or the compatibilistic free will that it still permits.&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt;

In other words, "provoking disbelief in free will" probably causes a belief in [[fatalism]]. As discussed earlier in this article, compatibilistic free will is illustrated by statements like ''"my choices have causes, and an effect&amp;nbsp;– so I affect my future"'', whereas fatalism is more like ''"my choices have causes, but no effect&amp;nbsp;– I am powerless"''. Fatalism, then, may be what threatens people's sense of [[self-efficacy]]. Lay people should not confuse fatalism with determinism, and yet even professional philosophers occasionally confuse the two. It is thus likely that the negative consequences below can be accounted for by participants developing a belief in ''fatalism'' when experiments attack belief in "free will".&lt;ref name=Holton&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holton | first1 = Richard | year = 2011 | title = Response to 'Free Will as Advanced Action Control for Human Social Life and Culture' by Roy F.

Some studies have been conducted indicating that people react strongly to the way in which mental determinism is described, when reconciling it with moral responsibility. Eddy Nahmias has noted that when people's actions are framed with respect to their beliefs and desires (rather than their neurological underpinnings), they are more likely to dissociate determinism from moral responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nahmias|first=Eddy|author2=D.

Various social behavioural traits have been correlated with the belief in deterministic models of mind, some of which involved the experimental subjection of individuals to libertarian and deterministic perspectives.

After researchers provoked volunteers to disbelieve in free will, participants lied, cheated, and stole more. Kathleen Vohs has found that those whose belief in free will had been eroded were more likely to cheat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02045.x| volume = 19| issue = 1| pages = 49–54| last = Vohs| first = Kathleen D.|author2=Jonathan W.

Baumeister and colleagues also note that volunteers disbelieving in free will are less capable of [[counterfactual thinking]].&lt;ref name=BAC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alquist, J.L., M. Daly, T.

==Eastern philosophy==

===Hindu philosophy===
{{see also|Free will in theology#Hinduism}}
The six orthodox ([[astik]]a) schools of thought in [[Hindu philosophy]] do not agree with each other entirely on the question of free will. For the [[Samkhya]], for instance, matter is without any freedom, and soul lacks any ability to control the unfolding of matter. The only real freedom (''kaivalya'') consists in realizing the ultimate separateness of matter and self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fapXqp-JSL0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=kaivalya|title=The ascetic self: subjectivity, memory and tradition |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-60401-7|page=73|last=Flood|first=Gavin|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Yoga]] school, only [[Ishvara]] is truly free, and its freedom is also distinct from all feelings, thoughts, actions, or wills, and is thus not at all a freedom of will. The metaphysics of the [[Nyaya]] and [[Vaisheshika]] schools strongly suggest a belief in determinism, but do not seem to make explicit claims about determinism or free will.&lt;ref name="koller"&gt;Koller, J. (2007) ''Asian Philosophies''. 5th ed. Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-092385-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A quotation from [[Swami Vivekananda]], a [[Vedanta|Vedantist]], offers a good example of the worry about free will in the Hindu tradition.
{{quote|text=Therefore we see at once that there cannot be any such thing as free-will; the very words are a contradiction, because will is what we know, and everything that we know is within our universe, and everything within our universe is moulded by conditions of time, space and causality. ... To acquire freedom we have to get beyond the limitations of this universe; it cannot be found here.&lt;ref name = "viveka"/&gt;}}
However, the preceding quote has often been misinterpreted as Vivekananda implying that everything is predetermined. What Vivekananda actually meant by lack of free will was that the will was not "free" because it was heavily influenced by the law of cause and effect&amp;nbsp;– "The will is not free, it is a phenomenon bound by cause and effect, but there is something behind the will which is free."&lt;ref name = "viveka"&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda]] (1907) {{cite web |url=http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_5/sayings_and_utterances.htm |title=Sayings and utterances |publisher=ramakrishnavivekananda.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vivekananda never said things were absolutely determined and placed emphasis on the power of conscious choice to alter one's past [[Karma in Hinduism|karma]]: "It is the coward and the fool who says this is his [[Destiny|fate]]. But it is the strong man who stands up and says I will make my own fate."&lt;ref name = "viveka"/&gt;

===Buddhist philosophy===
[[Buddhism]] accepts both freedom and determinism (or something similar to it), but in spite of its focus towards the human agency, rejects the western concept of a total agent from external sources.&lt;ref name="Gier"&gt;Gier, Nicholas and Kjellberg, Paul. "Buddhism and the Freedom of the Will: Pali and Mahayanist Responses" in Freedom and Determinism. Campbell, Joseph Keim; O'Rourke, Michael; and Shier, David. 2004. MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]], "There is free action, there is retribution, but I see no agent that passes out from one set of momentary elements into another one, except the [connection] of those elements."&lt;ref name="Gier"/&gt; Buddhists believe in neither absolute free will, nor determinism. It preaches a middle doctrine, named ''[[pratitya-samutpada]]'' in [[Sanskrit]], often translated as "inter-dependent arising". This theory is also called "Conditioned Genesis" or "[[Dependent Origination]]". It teaches that every volition is a conditioned action as a result of ignorance. In part, it states that free will is inherently conditioned and not "free" to begin with. It is also part of the theory of [[karma in Buddhism]]. The concept of karma in Buddhism is different from the notion of karma in Hinduism. In Buddhism, the idea of karma is much less deterministic. The Buddhist notion of karma is primarily focused on the cause and effect of moral actions in this life, while in Hinduism the concept of karma is more often connected with determining one's [[destiny]] in future lives.

In Buddhism it is taught that the idea of absolute freedom of choice (that is that any human being could be completely free to make any choice) is unwise, because it denies the reality of one's physical needs and circumstances. Equally incorrect is the idea that humans have no choice in life or that their lives are pre-determined. To deny freedom would be to deny the efforts of Buddhists to make moral progress (through our capacity to freely choose compassionate action). ''Pubbekatahetuvada'', the belief that all happiness and suffering arise from previous actions, is considered a wrong view according to Buddhist doctrines. Because Buddhists also reject [[agency (philosophy)|agenthood]], the traditional compatibilist strategies are closed to them as well. Instead, the Buddhist philosophical strategy is to examine the metaphysics of causality. Ancient India had many heated arguments about the nature of causality with [[Jain]]s, [[Nyaya|Nyayists]], [[Samkhya|Samkhyists]], [[Cārvāka]]ns, and Buddhists all taking slightly different lines. In many ways, the Buddhist position is closer to a theory of "conditionality" than a theory of "causality", especially as it is expounded by [[Nagarjuna]] in the ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]''.&lt;ref name="Gier"/&gt;

==In theology==
{{Main|Free will in theology}}

=== Christianity ===
[[File:Antonio Rodríguez - Saint Augustine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|Augustine's view of free will and predestination would go on to have a profound impact on Christian theology]]

The notions of free will and predestination are heavily debated among Christians. Free will in the Christian sense is the ability to choose between good or evil. Among Catholics, there are those holding to [[Thomism]], adopted from what [[Thomas Aquinas]] put forth in the ''[[Summa Theologica]].'' There are also some holding to [[Molinism]] which was put forth by Jesuit priest [[Luis de Molina]]. Among Protestants there is [[Arminianism]], held primarily by [[Methodist]] and some [[Baptist]], and formulated by Dutch theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]]; and there is also [[Calvinism]] held by most in the [[Reformed]] tradition which was formulated by the French Reformed theologian, [[John Calvin]]. John Calvin was heavily influenced by [[Augustine of Hippo]] views on predestination put forth in his work ''On the Predestination of the Saints.'' [[Martin Luther]] seems to hold views on predestination similar to Calvinism in his ''[[On the Bondage of the Will]],'' thus rejecting free will. In condemnation of Calvin and Luther views, the Council of Trent declared that "the free will of man, moved and excited by God, can by its consent co-operate with God, Who excites and invites its action; and that it can thereby dispose and prepare itself to obtain the grace of justification. The will can resist grace if it chooses. It is not like a lifeless thing, which remains purely passive. Weakened and diminished by Adam's fall, free will is yet not destroyed in the race (Sess. VI, cap. i and v)."

[[Paul the Apostle]] discusses Predestination in some of his Epistles.

"''For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the first-born among many brethren; and whom He predestined, these He also called; and whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.''” —[[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 8:29–30

“''He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will.''” —[[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 1:5

The exact meaning of these verses has been debated by Christian theologians throughout history.

=== Judaism ===
[[File:Flickr - USCapitol - Maimonides (1135-1204).jpg|thumb|right|[[Bas relief]] of Maimonides in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]].]]
[[Maimonides]] reasoned that human beings have free will (at least in the context of choosing to do good or evil).  Without free will, the demands of [[Nevi'im#Latter Prophets|the prophets]] would have been meaningless, there would be no need for the [[Torah]], and justice could not be administered.  In Maimonides's view, human free will is granted by God as part of the universe's design.&lt;ref&gt;Rambam Teshuvah 5:4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islam ===

In [[Islam]] the theological issue is not usually how to reconcile free will with God's foreknowledge, but with God's ''jabr'', or divine commanding power. [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari|al-Ash'ari]] developed an "acquisition" or "dual-agency" form of compatibilism, in which human free will and divine ''jabr'' were both asserted, and which became a cornerstone of the dominant [[Ash'ari]] position.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Montgomery Watt|Watt, Montgomery]]. Free-Will and Predestination in Early Islam. Luzac &amp; Co.: London 1948; [[Harry Austryn Wolfson|Wolfson, Harry]]. The Philosophy of Kalam, Harvard University Press 1976&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Shia]] Islam, Ash'aris understanding of a higher balance toward [[predestination]] is challenged by most theologians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/mananddestiny/3.htm |title=Man and His Destiny |publisher=Al-islam.org |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free will, according to Islamic doctrine is the main factor for man's accountability in his/her actions throughout life. Actions taken by people exercising free will are counted on the [[Day of Judgement]] because they are their own; however, the free will happens with the permission of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tosun|first=Ender|title=Guide to Understanding Islam|year=2012|location=Istanbul|isbn=978-605-631-981-5|url=http://www.islamicinformationcenter.info/understandingislam.pdf|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Others ===

The philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] claimed that divine omnipotence cannot be separated from divine goodness.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Timothy P. (1998) "Arminian edification: Kierkegaard on grace and free will" in ''Cambridge Companion to Kierkegaard'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; As a truly omnipotent and good being, God could create beings with true freedom over God. Furthermore, God would voluntarily do so because "the greatest good ... which can be done for a being, greater than anything else that one can do for it, is to be truly free."&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. (1848) ''Journals and Papers'', vol. III. Reprinted in Indiana University Press, Bloomington, 1967–78.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alvin Plantinga]]'s "[[Plantinga's free will defense|free will defense]]" is a contemporary expansion of this theme, adding how God, free will, and [[problem of evil|evil]] are consistent.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, J.L. (1955) "Evil and Omnipotence", ''Mind'', new series, vol. 64, pp. 200–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some philosophers follow [[William of Ockham]] in holding that necessity and possibility are defined with respect to a given point in time and a given matrix of empirical circumstances, and so something that is merely possible from the perspective of one observer may be necessary from the perspective of an omniscient.&lt;ref name="ockham"&gt;Ockham, William. Predestination, God's Knowledge, and Future Contingents, early 14th century, trans. Marilyn McCord Adams and [[Norman Kretzmann]] 1982, Hackett, esp pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers follow [[Philo of Alexandria]], a philosopher known for his [[homocentrism]], in holding that free will is a feature of a human's [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], and thus that non-human [[animal]]s lack free will.&lt;ref&gt;[[H. A. Wolfson]], ''Philo'', 1947 Harvard University Press; Religious Philosophy, 1961 Harvard University Press; and "St. Augustine and the Pelagian Controversy" in Religious Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
For nearly four decades, [[Eknath Easwaran|Easwaran]] taught a method of meditation, known as [[Passage Meditation|passage meditation]], which involves focusing the mind on inspiring sacred texts, such as the ''[[Psalm 23|23rd Psalm]]'' or the Buddha's ''[[Metta Sutta|Discourse on Good Will]]''. Throughout this time, he received inquiries about whether various texts were suitable passages for meditation. He taught that  passages should meet the criteria he had learned to trust in his own practice: a passage should be "positive, practical, universal, and inspiring".&lt;ref name=gmrf2009&gt;''God Makes the Rivers to Flow'', 2009 edition, {{ISBN|978-1-58638-038-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12}} and drawn from a scripture or a person whose words and life attest to spiritual realization. ''God Makes the Rivers to Flow'' grew as a collection of such passages.

==Topics covered==
All US editions of ''God Makes the Rivers to Flow'' and its derivatives contain an introduction, plus numerous 1- to 3- or more page selections of spiritual texts from many traditions. Examples of spiritual texts are shown in the table at right.

[[File:Guruvayoor Kesavan Statue-sidecrop.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.40|alt=Statue of devout elephant|[[Guruvayur Keshavan|Statue of devout elephant]]&lt;ref&gt;This is a photograph of a statue of [[Guruvayur Keshavan]], an elephant who lived the last 54 years of his life, until 1976, at [[Guruvayur Temple]] in Kerala state, India. The elephant was reported to display many signs of devotion to God. See [http://www.hindu.com/2005/12/11/stories/2005121102861000.htm "'Guruvayur Keshavan' Remembered"] in ''[[The Hindu]]'', Sunday, 11 Dec 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;]] [[Eknath Easwaran|Easwaran's]] Introduction uses a sculptural metaphor&lt;ref&gt;The elephant is used as both a [[metaphor]] (e.g., "once we have become attentive to the presence of this true self, then all we really need do is resolutely chip away whatever is not divine in ourselves," p. 16) and a [[simile]] (e.g., "we wouldn't use a dull chisel or one meant for wood on a piece of stone, and we should use suitable passages for meditation," p. 21), 2009 edition.&lt;/ref&gt; to explain how passages can be used beneficially in meditation. He tells the story of an ancient Indian sculptor who was renowned for vivid representations of elephants. His secret, the sculptor explained, was that after quarrying a giant rock,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;ldquo;for a long time, I do nothing but observe... and study it from every angle. I focus all my concentration on this task... At first, I see nothing but a huge and shapeless rock... Then slowly, very slowly, I... feel a presentiment... an outline, scarcely discernible, shows itself to me... An elephant is stirring in there!... I now know the one thing I must do:... I must chip away every last bit of stone that is ''not'' elephant. What then remains will be, must be, elephant.&amp;rdquo;&lt;ref name=foralongtime&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0c4M73NeoQUC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=isbn:9781586380380+%22for+a+long+time%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2eoRTuTkOYzEsAOWzoj8DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=isbn%3A9781586380380%20%22for%20a%20long%20time%22&amp;f=false Direct link: "For a long time...", page 15, ''God Makes the Rivers to Flow'' (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly, Easwaran says, meditation helps us to reveal "our higher self... [a] spark of divinity [that] is to be found in the heart of each human being.... [by] resolutely chip[ping] away whatever is not divine in ourselves."&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|16}} This process is neither easy or quick, and "can't be done in a week or by the weak."&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|16}} But "whatever our tradition, we are inheritors of straightforward spiritual practices [that] vary a bit from culture to culture... but essentially... are the same."&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|19}} Meditation is the most potent practice, enabling us to "see the lineaments of our true self":&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|19}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In meditation, the inspirational passage is the chisel, our concentration is the hammer.... When we use our will to drive the thin edge of the passage deep into consciousness, we get the purchase to pry loose tenacious habits and negative attitudes. The passage, whether it is from the Bhagavad Gita or ''The Imitation of Christ'' or the Dhammapada of the Buddha, has been tempered in the flames of mystical experience...&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|19}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Easwaran, "the great principle upon which meditation rests is that we become what we meditate on."&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|22}} This, he says, is consistent with our experience that even in everyday life, we are shaped by what occupies our thoughts – for example, if we spend most of our time "studying the market, checking the money rates, evaluating our portfolios, we are going to become money-people."&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|22}} Thus, in selecting meditation passages, Easwaran has "aimed for the highest the human being is capable of, the most noble and elevating truths that have ever been expressed on this planet."&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|23}} Indeed,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The test of suitable meditation passages is simply this: Does the passage bear the imprint of deep, personal spiritual experience? Is it the statement of one who went beyond the narrow confines of past conditioning into the unfathomable recesses of the mind, there to begin the great work of transformation?.... whatever lacks this validation by personal experience, however poetic or imaginative... is not suited for use in meditation.&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|21–2}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He also states that passages should be "life affirming,"&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|22}} and encourages building a varied repertoire of passages that can "guard against overfamiliarity.... [and] match a passage to your particular need at the time."&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|23}}

The 2nd and 3rd  editions contain several supplementary sections:
*A description of 8-point program of [[Passage Meditation|passage meditation]] recommended by Easwaran, involving silently and slowly focusing the mind on memorized or previously known passages (6 pages)
*A post-script on the "Message of the Scriptures," describing the goal of meditation as a "deathless state of Self-realization.... the message of every major scripture [and] the testimony of mystics everywhere, East or West."&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|256–7}}  (3 pages)
*The author's statement of what he believes separates the book from other sacred literature collections: that it functions as an instrument for transforming one's life. He states he can "testify from my own experience [that the passages] have the power to remake personality in the image of one's highest ideals."&lt;ref name=gmrf2009/&gt;{{rp|13}} ("Preface," 1 page)
*Indices by source, title, and first line
*Biographical and bibliographic notes on passage sources

In ''The International Journal of Humanities &amp; Peace'', Carol Burke wrote that ''God Makes the Rivers to Flow'' (2003) contains "rich resources" that offer "much to satisfy even the most restless mind."&lt;ref name=burke04/&gt;{{rp|113}} In addition to the "vast assortment of inspiring passages,"&lt;ref name=burke04/&gt;{{rp|113–4}} the section on using passages for specific purposes is "practical," the biographical notes are "interesting,"&lt;ref name=burke04/&gt;{{rp|114}} and the introduction "entertainingly encourages"&lt;ref name=burke04/&gt;{{rp|114}} readers to begin personal transformation. Burke states that many passage sources will be familiar, but "many other passages perhaps less familiar, from Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, and the [[Sufism|Sufi]] and [[Native American religion|Native American]] traditions... are equally inspiring."&lt;ref name=burke04/&gt;{{rp|114}} She adds that "in this reviewer's opinion, it is regrettable that nothing appears from the eloquent [[Nez Perce tribe|Nez Perce]] leader [[Chief Joseph]]."&lt;ref name=burke04/&gt;{{rp|114}}

In ''[[Resurgence &amp; Ecologist|Resurgence]]'', Marian van Eyk McCain wrote that "it feels refreshingly [[ecumenism|ecumenical]] to see sacred texts from many different [[wisdom tradition]]s gathering peaceably between two covers."&lt;ref name=resurgence04/&gt; ''God Makes the Rivers to Flow'' "contains old favorites like the [[Make Me an Instrument of Your Peace|Prayer of St Francis]]," verses from well-known scriptures, psalms, prayers, poems, two Native American pieces, and selections from "many... individual sages like [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]], [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]], [[Hildegard of Bingen|Hildegard]], [[Thomas à Kempis]] and [[Inayat Khan|Hazrat Inayat Khan]]."&lt;ref name=resurgence04/&gt; McCain also warned those "like me" with an aversion to a "preponderance of male pronouns" that "The divine feminine is seriously under-represented here (less than five percent) and only one fifth of the pieces are gender-neutral."&lt;ref name=resurgence04/&gt; In response, a letter from a reader, Margaret Purrett, also published by ''[[Resurgence &amp; Ecologist|Resurgence]]'', argued that "meditators need to be tolerant of [[metaphor]]s for divinity and gender usage from the past. I would not like to be prevented from enjoying and using the ''Bhagavad Gita'', the ''Vedas'', ''Dhammapada'', or the ''Psalms'' merely because of references to male pronouns. Would anyone?"&lt;ref name=purrett04&gt;{{cite journal |author=Margaret Purrett |year=2004 
 |title=Engendering Change [letter commenting on review of God makes the rivers to flow, by Eknath Easwaran] 
 |journal=[[Resurgence &amp; Ecologist|Resurgence]] |publisher=The Resurgence Trust |volume=14 |issue=226 |pages=60
 |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=Z1vHTdG8NZOksQPRl4i8AQ&amp;ct=result&amp;id=tGMkAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=resurgence+easwaran&amp;q=easwaran#search_anchor |issn= 0034-5970 |OCLC=1763807}} (letter signed by Margaret Purrett of Voorschoten, The Netherlands)&lt;/ref&gt; Purrett stated that "In fact, [[Eknath Easwaran]] made new translations of many passages to make them more neutral for this last edition, and he changed many of the masculine singulars to neutral plurals."&lt;ref name=purrett04/&gt;

''[[The Times of India]]'' described the passages in ''God Makes the Rivers to Flow'' as "positive and practical, inspiring and life-affirming," "alive with the charge of mystical awareness," and having "the power to change your life."&lt;ref name=timesofindia/&gt;

''Prairie Messenger'', a Roman Catholic publication,&lt;ref&gt;The ''Prairie Messenger's'' website states that [http://www.prairiemessenger.ca/About_us.html "True to its Catholic tradition, the Prairie Messenger seeks to mirror for the church on the Prairies the whole reality of the pilgrim People of God as they seek to better understand, make present and judge themselves by the kingdom of God as announced in the liberating and merciful news of Jesus Christ."] (accessed 26 June 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; stated that "these texts should have wide-ranging appeal since they are devoted to catching a glimpse of our inner being. Having taught meditation for over 30 years, Easwaran knows the importance of texts, the discipline of mental training, the use of a mantram, a holy formula, and daily meditation periods.... Easwaran is a faithful guide."&lt;ref name=jwg95/&gt;

{{Eknath Easwaran}}Reviewing the audio edition (1995), ''Fellowship in Prayer'' stated that "There is no end to the beauty that pours forth from the Blue Mountain Meditation Center in California, where Sri Eknath Easwaran continues to weave the golden threads of his ministry."&lt;ref name=mfg95/&gt; The reviewer described the audio as "magnificent," stating that "the depths of Easwaran's great soul brings each text to its most full expression of beauty and holiness... one has a sense of huge ocean waves rolling slowly, quietly, softly, timelessly, onto a distant shore.... My heart overflows with gratitude."&lt;ref name=mfg95/&gt;

In ''[[B.C. Catholic]]'s'' review of the audio edition (1995), Paul Matthew St. Pierre stated that "All of them [the passages] are spiritually thrilling both in their content and as read aloud by Easwaran."&lt;ref name=stpierre95/&gt; St. Pierre stated that "My own position... is that works of literature are to be read aloud, to be assigned a voice,"&lt;ref&gt;A fuller version of St. Pierre's statement is: "My own position as an English professor is that works of literature are to be read aloud, to be assigned a voice, either from within the text (the voice of author, narrator, or character) or from outside the text (the voice of the reader). This oral dimension of inscribed texts is no more evident than in works that have their origin in oral traditions, such as the scriptures of most of the world's religions. The Hebrew and Christian Scriptures are less a recorded than an authored text, recorded by men and women, but first authored (spoken) by God. Before they came to be recorded, these Scriptures circulated within the Jewish and Christian faith communities, passed on by word of mouth, from generation to generation."&lt;/ref&gt; and that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Having now listened (twice!) to all 170 minutes of readings, I feel confident in stating that this tape will stand up to repeated "hearings" from audiences interested in ecumenical Scriptures and holy books by saints and mystics, and in particular audiences looking for inspiration and dedicated to meditation.&lt;ref name=stpierre95/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[New Age Journal]]'' stated that "as an attractive sampler of sacred literature [the book] would be impressive enough. But these passages were chosen... for their [[spiritual transformation|transformative]] power.... The meanings and rhythms of the selections are calming. Their beauty inevitably emanates from their simplicity."&lt;ref name=newage92/&gt;

''India-West'' stated that the book "fills an important void in our lives.... The passages chosen are practical, positive and universal in appeal and of great literary beauty."&lt;ref name=ghosh04/&gt;

''BC Catholic's'' review of the 3rd edition (2003) stated that "This would be a wonderful book to help with one's [[Advent]] preparation and discipline... the book is designed for [[lectio divina]] and meditation.... the book... will fill readers with a sense of wonder, mostly obviously because it collects profoundly inspirational passages... but also because it demands that readers study the passages deferentially, with reverence."&lt;ref name=stpierre03/&gt; It mentioned many passages as comprising "Catholic content,"&lt;ref&gt;"The Catholic content comprises Psalms 23, 24, 100, and 139; [[Anselm of Canterbury|Saint Anselm's]] 'Teach Me'; Saint [[Symeon the New Theologian]]'s 'I know That He Reveals Himself'; Saint [[Francis of Assisi]]'s 'Prayer of Saint Francis' and Saint [[Clare of Assisi]]'s 'The Mirror of Eternity'; Christ's 'Sermon on the Mount' from the [[Gospel of Saint Matthew]]; 'When You Call' from the [[Book of Isaiah]]; [[St. Paul]]'s '[[1 Corinthians 13|Epistle on Love]]'; St. [[Therese of Liseux]]'s 'Living on Love'; and St. [[Teresa of Avila]]'s 'I Gave All My Heart' and 'Her Heart is Full of Joy.' Other contributions are by Sts. [[Ignatius of Loyola]], [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], [[Catherine of Genoa]], [[Brother Lawrence]], [[Francis de Sales]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], and [[Saint Patrick|Patrick]]; and by [[Hildegard of Bingen]], [[Elizabeth of the Trinity]], [[Mechthild of Magdeburg]], [[Thomas a Kempis]], and Cardinal [[John Henry Newman]]." (St. Pierre, 2003, p. 7)&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All the content, from all the faith traditions, in the spirit of ecumenism, is deeply inspirational. For example, the 'Invocations' of Ansari of Herat.... "O Lord, give me that right discrimination / That the lure of the world may cheat me no more. Give me strength / That my faith suffer no eclipse." This prayer evokes not only the penitence of Ramadan (Islam's month of fasting...) but also the preparation and discipline of Advent.&lt;ref name=stpierre03/&gt;

Recommended meditation passages also ''motivate'' by including exemplars’ accounts of positive rewards and benefits of spiritual living" (p. 92, Oman, Flinders &amp; Thoresen, 2008, italics in original)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''History of Tenrikyo''' concerns the social and institutional development of [[Tenrikyo]], from the day the teachings were founded by [[Miki Nakayama]] in October 26, 1838, to the present day.

==Confraternities==
Since the early 1860s, Miki Nakayama had asked her followers to form confraternities (''ko'' 講). One of the earliest examples was the Shinmei confraternity, formed sometime in April 1878.&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of Oyasama'', p.106&lt;/ref&gt;

==Obtaining government authorization==
From the 1870s, Miki Nakayama and her followers were constantly being persecuted by local government authorities and from members of established religions for expressing their beliefs and performing the [[Service (Tenrikyo)|Service]]. To put an end to the persecution, various followers sought for recognition from different religious and state authorities, even though this was against the wishes of Nakayama. Tenrikyo could not apply as a completely independent religion because [[Meiji Constitution|Japanese law during the Meiji period]] did not grant civil authorization to churches outside of the established traditions, which at the time were [[Shinto]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;''Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness'', 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tenrikyo Overseas Mission Department. ''A Historical Sketch of Tenrikyo.'' Translation of ''Oyasama Nensai to Tomoni.'' Tenri, 1990. p.6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880, Nakayama's eldest son, Shuji traveled to the Jifuku Temple at the foot of [[Mount Kongō]], a [[Buddhist]] temple belonging to the [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon sect]]. The Jifuku Temple agreed to Shuji's request to establish a church, and on September 22, 1880, the "Tenrin-O-Kosha" church was formally inaugurated with a Buddhist fire rite and sermons by Buddhist priests.&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of Oyasama'', p.110-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Meisei confraternity spread Nakayama's teachings as moral philosophy and thus escaped persecution. Following this example, a petition was submitted on May 9, 1884 to establish an organization named, "Tenrin-O-Sha: Institute for the Study of Practical Ethics." Thought the office denied the request because of the lack authority to grant the request, an office called "Tenrin-O-Sha" was nevertheless opened in [[Osaka]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of Oyasama'', p.200.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March and April 1885, the followers approached the Shinto Headquarters for the appointment of Shinnosuke Nakayama (Nakayama's grandson) and nine others as religious instructors. On May 22, Shinnosuke was appointed as a religious instructor, and the next day, May 23, the other religious instructors were also appointed, and permission was granted for the establishment of a sixth-degree church to be directly supervised by the Shinto Headquarters. On June 2, a letter accepting these appointments was sent to the Shinto authorities.&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of Oyasama'', p.202.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first attempt to obtain civil authorization happened on April 29, 1885, when the followers filed a petition to the governor of [[Osaka]] for permission to form the Tenrikyo Church. Attached with the petition were four texts – [[Mikagura-uta|The Twelve Songs]], [[Ofudesaki]] Part IV, Ofudesaki Part X, and the Story of Creation. The request was denied. On July 3, the followers filed a second petition to the governor of [[Osaka]], which read, "Request to Establish the Shinto Tenrikyo Church." Again, the request was denied.&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of Oyasama'', p.202-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of Nakayama Miki===
[[File:Nakayama Miki mausoleum.jpg|thumb|Cemetery of Nakayama Miki.]]
On January 26, 1887 by the lunar calendar (February 18 by the Gregorian calendar), the foundress of Tenrikyo, [[Nakayama Miki]], died at around two o'clock in the afternoon, after a performance of the [[Service (Tenrikyo)|Service]].&lt;ref&gt;Tenrikyo Overseas Department. ''An Anthology of Osashizu Translations.'' Tenri, 2007. p.20-1.&lt;/ref&gt; 

On February 25, 1887, a funeral for Nakayama Miki was conducted, with over 10,000 people in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;''A Historical Sketch of Tenrikyo,'' p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, she was buried in the graveyard at Zenpuku-ji (a Buddhist temple in modern-day Tenri City), along with other members of the Nakayama family. However, in 1892, Tenrikyo followers, led by Nakayama Shinnosuke, constructed a new cemetery on Mount Toyoda, and the ceremony for her reburial was held on December 13th. The reburial ceremony was attended by over a hundred thousand people.&lt;ref&gt;''A Historical Sketch of Tenrikyo,'' p.10-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Under Shinto Main Bureau==
A petition for the legal recognition of a church was sent to the government office of [[Tokyo]] prefecture. On April 10, 1888, the governor of Tokyo approved this petition, establishing Tenrikyo Church Headquarters as a "sixth class" church belonging to the [[Shinto Taikyo|Shinto Main Bureau]] (神道本局 ''Shinto Honkyoku'').&lt;ref&gt;''A Historical Sketch of Tenrikyo,'' p.6.&lt;/ref&gt; The legal authorization removed the threat of suppression and allowed followers to seek permission to establish branch churches and to gain official recognition for [[missionary]] work.&lt;ref&gt;''Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness'', 56-58.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1888, Koriyama and Yamana were established as the first two branch churches under Tenrikyo Church Headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;''A Historical Sketch of Tenrikyo,'' p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 6, 1891, the Shinto Main Bureau changed Tenrikyo's designation from a "sixth class" church to a "first class" church.&lt;ref&gt;''A Historical Sketch of Tenrikyo,'' p.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise in membership===
The membership rose sharply in the first decade of the Headquarters' existence. In 1892, the number of Tenrikyo followers had allegedly reached over one million, a thirty-fold increase in membership in five years. By December 1896, Tenrikyo had 3,137,113 members belonging to 1,078 churches, and there were 19,061 ministers. This growth invited negative reactions from Buddhist institutions, which were concerned about losing adherents, and from newspapers such as ''Chuo Shinbun'', ''Yorozu Chouho'', and ''Ni-Roku Shinbun'', who labeled the religion as "anti-social."&lt;ref&gt;''Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness'', 56-58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Historical Sketch of Tenrikyo,'' p.19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home Ministry's directive===
On April 6, 1896, the [[Home Ministry]] (内務省 ''Naimu-shō'') issued "Directive No. 12," which ordered strict and secretive surveillance over Tenrikyo Church Headquarters under the pretense of maintaining and strengthening the [[kokutai|state polity]] of Japan. Issues raised by authorities were the congregation of both men and women together (which could potentially lead to disgrace), the obstruction of medical treatment, and the alleged policy of enforced donations.&lt;ref&gt;''Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness'', 59-60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tenrikyo leaders complied to the state demands in several ways. They changed several aspects of their prayer ritual, known to adherents as the [[Service (Tenrikyo)|Service]].&lt;ref&gt;As for the exact changes made in the prayer ritual: "Only the second and third sections of the Service were allowed to be performed; only male performers could perform the Service; only men's instruments could be played; and the ''[[kagura]]'' masks were to be placed in front of the Service performers instead of being worn by them" (''Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness'', 61).&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the Tenrikyo deity [[Tenri-O-no-Mikoto]] was changed to "Tenri-no-Okami."&lt;ref&gt;''A Historical Sketch of Tenrikyo,'' p.21.&lt;/ref&gt; Tenrikyo Church Headquarters' conformity with the state demands resulted in a dual structure of the Tenrikyo faith, where on the surface, Tenrikyo complied with the state demands, while adherents disregarded those changes and maintained the teachings and rites as initially taught by [[Miki Nakayama]].&lt;ref&gt;''Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness'', 61-63.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drive toward sectarian independence==
In 1899 the Shinto Main Bureau advised the Tenrikyo Church Headquarters officials about the possibility of official recognition as an independent religion (independent meaning to be classified directly under the [[Government of Meiji Japan|Meiji government]], which upheld State Shinto ideology). Tenrikyo leaders worked to systemize the Tenrikyo doctrine and institutionalize the organization so that the petition for independence would pass. Tenrikyo Church Headquarters made a total of five attempts before it finally achieved independence in 1908.

On April 1, 1900, [[Tenri Seminary]], Tenrikyo’s first educational institution, was founded as a training school for ministers. In 1902, Tenrikyo arranged its mission administration system in Japan, which divided the country into ten dioceses and appointed superintendents to supervise regional missionary activities.

In 1903,&lt;ref&gt;''A Glossary of Tenrikyo Terms'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; a edition of Tenrikyo's doctrine was compiled (known today as the ''Meiji kyoten'', or the [[Meiji period|Meiji]] version of Tenrikyo's doctrine). This edition of the doctrine differs significantly from the present edition&lt;ref&gt;For instance, the ''Meiji kyoten'' contained ten chapters: 'Revering God,' 'Respecting the Emperor,' 'Loving the Nation,' 'Morality,' 'Accumulating Virtues,' 'Cleansing of Impurities,' 'Founding of the Teachings,' 'Repayment to God,' 'the Kagura', and 'Peace of Mind.' See ''Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness,'' p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; because the teachings of State Shinto were incorporated in order to gain the Home Ministry's approval. Although Tenrikyo Church Headquarters complied with many of the state's requests, it did not compromise on the request to completely eliminate the ''[[Mikagura-uta]]'' ("The Songs for the Service"), one of Tenrikyo's main scriptures.

Around this time, Tenrikyo began to open its first churches overseas in [[Taiwan]] (1897) and [[Korea]] (1904).

==Sect Shinto==
The fifth petition for independence was submitted to the Home Ministry on March 20, 1908 and accepted later that year in November 27. Tenrikyo Church Headquarters set up its Administrative Headquarters, formally appointed Shinnosuke Nakayama as the first ''shinbashira'', the spiritual and administrative leader of Tenrikyo, and established its constitution. On February 25, 1912, the Home Ministry invited representatives from seventy-three religious groups to the [[:ja:三教会同|Three Religions Conference]] (三教会同 ''Sankyokaido'') including a Tenrikyo representative (the three religions represented were Shinto, Buddhism, and Christianity, and Tenrikyo was categorized under Shinto). This conference initiated a program of national edification, and with the support of the government, Tenrikyo was able to hold lectures at 2,074 places through Japan, drawing nearly a quarter million listeners.&lt;ref&gt;''Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness'', 64-7&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the relative relaxation of state control on Tenrikyo rituals, the performance of [[Mikagura-uta#Section One|section one of the Mikagura-uta]] was restored in 1916, after two decades of prohibition under the Home Ministry’s directive.  

In 1925, a school of foreign languages was established for missionaries, including what would become [[Tenri Central Library]]. The same year saw the establishment of a printing office, a department for researching of doctrinal and biographical materials, and a major expansion of the church's education system, including a new girls’ school, nursery, kindergarten, and elementary school. 

In 1928, the ''[[Ofudesaki]]'' was published. Three years later, in 1931, the publication of the ''[[Osashizu]]'' was completed, making the three main scriptures of Tenrikyo available to all followers for the first time. 

On the occasion of the completion of the South Worship Hall of the Main Sanctuary in 1934, the [[Mikagura-uta#Songs for the Kagura Service|Kagura Service]] was restored for the first time since it had been prohibited in 1896.

During this period, churches were opened in [[Manchuria]] (1911), the [[United States|U.S.]] (San Francisco Church, 1927),&lt;ref&gt;The Headquarters of Tenrikyo Church. ''The Short History of Tenrikyo Church.'' Nara, 1956. p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brazil]], and [[Southeast Asia|Southeast Asian]] countries. In 1910, missionaries were sent to England to propagate the Tenrikyo teachings, but they were not able to establish themselves permanently there.&lt;ref&gt;''The Short History of Tenrikyo Church.'' p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; It was only a number of decades later, in 2000, that a mission center (Tenrikyo UK Centre) was established in England.

==Wartime Japan==
As the war between Japan and China grew from the [[Mukden Incident]] to the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], state control of religious and secular thought intensified. For example, in December 1935, state authorities destroyed the buildings of [[Ōmoto|Omotokyo]] Headquarters and arrested the organization's leaders. One week later, on December 16, 1935, around four hundred policemen were sent to investigate Tenrikyo Church Headquarters on suspicion of tax evasion, even though there were no grounds for that accusation.

After the [[National Mobilization Law]] was passed in 1938, Japan’s wartime polity strengthened. In 1939, Tenrikyo Church Headquarters announced that it would reform its doctrine and ritual, under threat of forced disbanding of the organization by state authorities. Under the reformation, copies of the ''Ofudesaki'' and ''Osashizu'' were recalled, certain chapters were deleted from the ''Mikagura-uta'',&lt;ref&gt;Specifically, Yorozuyo, Song Three, and Song Five. See ''[[Mikagura-uta]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;, and the Kagura Service, an important Tenrikyo ritual, was not allowed to be performed. All preaching, rites, and events were to follow the Meiji version of Tenrikyo's doctrine from 1903. The 1940 [[Religious Organizations Law]] further increased state surveillance and oppression in Japan.

==After World War II==
[[File:Tenrikyo Church Headquarters.jpg|thumb|Tenrikyo Church Headquarters viewed from the south gate.]]
In its own historical account, Tenrikyo refers to the years following the [[Surrender of Japan|surrender of Japan]] and the conclusion of [[World War II]] as ''fukugen'', or "restoration."&lt;ref&gt;''Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness'', 77.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the significant aspects of the "restoration" was the republishing and reissuing of the three scriptures of Tenrikyo in their entirety: the ''[[Mikagura-uta]]'' in 1946, the ''[[Ofudesaki]]'' in 1948, and the ''[[Osashizu]]'' in 1949. In addition, the doctrine, which for decades had been colored by State Shinto ideology, was revised to reflect the teachings conveyed in the main scriptures and authorized in 1949.

Another aspect of the "restoration" was the construction of the [[Oyasato-yakata]], begun in 1954. As of 1998, twenty four wings have been completed and are used for various purposes, such as educational facilities, medicinal facilities, institutes for doctrinal studies and religious training, and followers' dormitories. The construction continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;''Tenrikyo: The Path to Joyousness'', 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Tenrikyo-Christian Dialogue," a symposium cosponsored by [[Tenri University]] and [[Pontifical Gregorian University]], was held in [[Rome]], [[Italy]] from March 9–11, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;The Organizing Committee of Tenrikyo-Christian Dialogue. ''Tenrikyo Christian Dialogue.'' Tenri University Press, 1999, Tenri, Japan.&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, the universities cosponsored another symposium, "Tenrikyo-Christian Dialogue II," held at [[Tenri, Nara|Tenri, Japan]] from September 28–30, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;The Organizing Committee of Tenrikyo-Christian Dialogue II. ''Tenrikyo Christian Dialogue.'' Tenri University Press, 2005, Tenri, Japan.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Holy Land''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{lang|he|אֶרֶץ הַקּוֹדֶשׁ}} {{transl|he|''Eretz HaKodesh''}}, {{lang-la|Terra Sancta}}; [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|الأرض المقدسة}} {{transl|ar|''Al-Arḍ Al-Muqaddasah''}} or {{lang|ar|الديار المقدسة}} {{transl|ar|''Ad-Diyar Al-Muqaddasah''}}) is an area roughly located between the [[Jordan River]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] that also includes the Eastern Bank of the Jordan River. Traditionally, it is synonymous with both the biblical [[Land of Israel]] and historical [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. The term usually refers to a territory roughly corresponding to the modern [[State of Israel]], the [[Palestinian territories]], western [[Jordan]], and parts of southern [[Lebanon]] and southwestern [[Syria]]. It is considered [[holy]] by [[Jews]], [[Christian]]s, and [[Muslim]]s.

Part of the significance of the land stems from the [[religious significance of Jerusalem]], the holiest city to [[Judaism]], the historical region of [[Ministry of Jesus|Jesus' ministry]], and the site of the [[Isra and Mi'raj]] event in [[Islam]].

The holiness of the land to Christianity was part of the motivation for the [[Crusades]], as European Christians sought to win back the Holy Land from the Muslims, who had [[Muslim conquests|conquered it]] from the Christian [[Byzantine Empire]].

Many sites in the Holy Land have long been [[pilgrimage]] destinations for adherents of the [[Abrahamic religions]], including Jews, Christians, Muslims, and [[Bahá'ís]]. [[Pilgrim]]s visit the Holy Land to touch and see physical manifestations of their [[faith]], confirm their beliefs in the holy context with collective excitation, and connect personally to the Holy Land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael Sebastian |last=Metti |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Jerusalem - the most powerful brand in history |url=http://www.metti-bronner.com/Jerusalem.pdf |work=[[Stockholm University School of Business]] |publisher= |date=2011-06-01 |accessdate=1 July 2011 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tanakh]] explicitly refers to it as "holy land" in only one passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Zechariah|2:16|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "holy land" is further used twice in the deuterocanonical books.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Wisdom|12:3|NRSV}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||2 Maccabees|1:7|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The holiness of the Land of Israel is generally implied in the Tanakh by the Land being given to the [[Israelites]] by God, that is, it is the "[[promised land]]", an integral part of [[Covenant (biblical)|God's covenant]]. In the [[Torah]] many [[mitzvot]] commanded to the Israelites can only be performed in the Land of Israel,&lt;ref&gt;Aharon Ziegler, ''Halakhic positions of Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik: Volume 4'', KTAV Publishing House, 2007, p.173&lt;/ref&gt; which serves to differentiate it from other lands. For example, in the Land of Israel, "no land shall be sold permanently" (Lev. 25:23). [[Shmita]] is only observed with respect to the land of Israel, and the observance of many [[Jewish holiday|holy]] days is different, as an extra day is observed in the [[Jewish diaspora]].

According to [[Eliezer Schweid]]:
{{quote|The uniqueness of the Land of Israel is...'geo-theological' and not merely climatic. This is the land which faces the entrance of the spiritual world, that sphere of existence that lies beyond the physical world known to us through our senses. This is the key to the land's unique status with regard to prophecy and prayer, and also with regard to the commandments&lt;ref&gt;''The Land of Israel: National Home Or Land of Destiny'', By Eliezer Schweid, Translated by Deborah Greniman, Published 1985 Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, {{ISBN|0-8386-3234-3}}, p.56.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From the perspective of the 1906 [[Jewish Encyclopedia]], the holiness of Israel had been concentrated since the sixteenth century, especially for burial, in the "[[Four Holy Cities]]": [[Jerusalem]], [[Hebron]], [[Safed]] and [[Tiberias]] - as [[Judaism]]'s holiest cities. Jerusalem, as the site of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]], is considered especially significant.&lt;ref name=1000BCE&gt;
Since the 10th century BCE. "For Jews the city has been the pre-eminent focus of their spiritual, cultural, and national life throughout three millennia." Yossi Feintuch, ''U.S. Policy on Jerusalem'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 1987, p. 1. {{ISBN|0-313-25700-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Sacred burials are still undertaken for diaspora Jews who wish to lie buried in the holy soil of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11867-palestine-holiness-of | title=PALESTINE, HOLINESS OF | publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com | accessdate=December 7, 2011 | author=Joseph Jacobs, Judah David Eisenstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jewish tradition, Jerusalem is Mount [[Moriah]], the location of the [[binding of Isaac]]. The [[Hebrew Bible]] mentions the name "[[Jerusalem]]" 669 times, often because many mitzvot can only be performed within its environs. The name "[[Zion]]", which usually refers to Jerusalem, but sometimes the Land of Israel, appears in the Hebrew Bible 154 times.

The [[Talmud]] mentions the religious duty of colonising Israel.&lt;ref name="Herzog1967"&gt;{{cite book|author=Isaac Herzog|title=The Main Institutions of Jewish Law: The law of obligations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eq3XAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=27 June 2011|year=1967|publisher=Soncino Press|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; So significant in Judaism is the act of purchasing land in Israel, the Talmud allows for the lifting of certain religious restrictions of [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] observance to further its acquisition and settlement.&lt;ref name="Zahavi1962"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yosef Zahavi|title=Eretz Israel in rabbinic lore (Midreshei Eretz Israel): an anthology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yK7hAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=19 June 2011|year=1962|publisher=Tehilla Institute|page=28|quote=If one buys a house from a non-Jew in Israel, the title deed may be written for him even on the Sabbath.

Eleazar b. Shammua' and R. [[Johanan HaSandlar]] left Israel to study from R. [[Judah ben Bathyra]], they only managed to reach [[Sidon]] when "the thought of the sanctity of Palestine overcame their resolution, and they shed tears, rent their garments, and turned back".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to the Jewish population being concentrated in Israel, emigration was generally prevented, which resulted in a limiting of the amount of space available for Jewish learning. However, after suffering persecutions in Israel for centuries after the destruction of the Temple, Rabbis who had found it very difficult to retain their position moved to Babylon, which offered them better protection. Many Jews wanted Israel to be the place where they died, in order to be buried there. The sage Rabbi Anan said "To be buried in Israel is like being buried under the altar."&lt;ref name="first"/&gt;&lt;ref name="(Translator)2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gil1997"/&gt; The saying "His land will absolve His people" implies that burial in Israel will cause one to be absolved of all one's sins.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11867-palestine-holiness-of|title=PALESTINE, HOLINESS OF - JewishEncyclopedia.com|last=|first=|date=|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3364937/jewish/Why-Do-Jews-Fly-Their-Dead-to-Israel-for-Burial.htm|title=Why Do Jews Fly Their Dead to Israel for Burial?|website=www.chabad.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Holy sepulchre mass.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] is one of the most important pilgrimage sites in Christianity, as it is the purported site of Christ's resurrection.]]
[[File:Tebnine11.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Crusader castle of [[Toron]] in the village of [[Tebnine|Tibnin]], [[Lebanon]]]]

For [[Christian]]s, the [[Land of Israel]] is considered holy because of its association with the [[Birth of Jesus|birth]], ministry, [[crucifixion]] and [[Death and Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] of [[Jesus]], whom Christians regard as the Savior or [[Messiah]], and because it is the land of the Jewish people (according to the Bible). Christian books, including editions of the Bible, often had maps of the Holy Land (considered to be Galilee, Samaria, Judea). For instance, the ''Itinerarium Sacrae Scripturae'' (Travel book through Holy Scripture) of Heinrich Bünting (1545-1606), a German Protestant pastor, featured such a map.&lt;ref name="wdl"/&gt; His book was very popular, and it provided "the most complete available summary of biblical geography and described the geography of the Holy Land by tracing the travels of major figures from the Old and New testaments."&lt;ref name="wdl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Description of the Holy Land|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2891/|website=[[World Digital Library]]|date=1585|language=German|author1=Bünting, Heinrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a geographic term, the description "Holy Land" loosely encompasses modern-day [[Israel]], the [[Palestinian territories]], [[Lebanon]], western [[Jordan]] and south-western [[Syria]].

{{See also|Jerusalem in Islam|Syria (region)}}
In the [[Qur'an]], the term {{lang-ar|'''الأرض المقدسة'''}} ({{transl|ar|''Al-Ard Al-Muqaddasah''}}, {{lang-en|"Holy Land"}}) is used in a passage about [[Moses in Islam|Musa]] ([[Moses]]) proclaiming to the [[Children of Israel]]: "O my people! Enter the holy land which [[Allah]] hath assigned unto you, and turn not back ignominiously, for then will ye be overthrown, to your own ruin." ([[wikisource:The Holy Qur'an/Al-Meada|Surah 5:21]]) The Quran also refers to the land as being 'Blessed'.&lt;ref name="Cite quran|17|1|e=16|s=ns"&gt;{{cite quran|17|1|e=16|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cite quran|21|51|e=82|s=ns"&gt;{{cite quran|21|51|e=82|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cite quran|34|10|e=18|s=ns"&gt;{{cite quran|34|10|e=18|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jerusalem]] (referred to as ''Al-Quds'' ({{lang-ar|الـقُـدس}}, "The Holy")) has particular significance in Islam. The Quran refers to [[Muhammad]]'s experiencing the [[Isra and Mi'raj]] as "a Journey by night from ''[[Masjid Al-Haram|Al-Masjidil-Haram]]'' to ''[[Masjid Al-Aqsa|Al-Masjidil-Aqsa]]'', whose precincts We did bless ..." (17:1).&lt;ref name="Cite quran|17|1|e=16|s=ns"/&gt; ''[[Ahadith]]'' infer that the "Farthest Masjid" is in Al-Quds; for example, as narrated by [[Abu Huraira]]h: "On the night journey of the Apostle of Allah, two cups, one containing wine and the other containing milk, were presented to him at Al-Quds (Jerusalem). He looked at them and took the cup of milk. Angel Gabriel said, "Praise be to Allah, who guided you to Al-Fitrah (the right path); if you had taken (the cup of) wine, your ''[[Ummah]]'' would have gone astray". However, some modern scholars argue that the 'Farthest Mosque' was a building or prayer-site just outside [[Medina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3596681,00.html|title=The myth of al-Aqsa:Holiness of Jerusalem to Islam has always been politically motivated|website=Ynetnews|date=15 Sep 2008|author=[[Mordechai Kedar]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/temples.html|title=The Jewish Temples: The Temples of Jerusalem in Islam|author=[[Martin Kramer]]|website=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; The present building of Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa in Jerusalem had not been built in Muhammad's day, and the Quran does not contain any other reference to Jerusalem, apart from the reference to the change of the ''[[Qibla]]h'' from Jerusalem to Mecca. [[Jerusalem]] was Islam's first ''Qiblah'' (direction of prayer) in Muhammad's lifetime, however, this was later changed to the [[Kaaba]] in the [[Hijaz]]i city of [[Mecca]], following a revelation to Muhammad by the Archangel [[Jibril]],&lt;ref name="Cite quran|2|142|e=177|s=ns"&gt;{{cite quran|2|142|e=177|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; by which it is understood by scholars {{who|date=February 2016}} that it was in answer to the rejection by the Jews of Muhammed's Prophetship.

The exact region referred to as being 'blessed' in the Qur'an, in verses like [17:1], [21:71] and [34:18],&lt;ref name="Cite quran|17|1|e=16|s=ns"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cite quran|21|51|e=82|s=ns"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cite quran|34|10|e=18|s=ns"/&gt; has been interpreted differently by various scholars. [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]] likens it to a wide land-range including [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]], especially the cities of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]]; Az-Zujaj describes it as, ''"[[Damascus]], Palestine, and a bit of [[Jordan]]"''; [[Muadh ibn Jabal]] as, ''"the area between [[al-Arish]] and the [[Euphrates]]"''; and [[Ibn Abbas]] as, ''"the land of [[Jericho]]"''.&lt;ref&gt;Ali (1991), p. 934&lt;/ref&gt; This overall region is referred to as "[[Ash-Shām]]" ({{lang-ar|الـشَّـام}}).&lt;ref name="Volume 9 1997 page 261"&gt;Article "AL-SHĀM" by [[C.E. Bosworth]], ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'', Volume 9 (1997), page 261.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Salibi2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kamal S.

From the classical perspective however Syria, including Palestine, formed no more than the western fringes of what was reckoned to be Arabia between the first line of cities and the coast. Since there is no clear dividing line between what are called today the Syrian and Arabian deserts, which actually form one stretch of arid tableland, the classical concept of what actually constituted Syria had more to its credit geographically than the vaguer Arab concept of Syria as Bilad al-Sham. Under the Romans, there was actually a province of Syria. with its capital at Antioch, which carried the name of the territory. Otherwise. down the centuries, Syria like Arabia and Mesopotamia was no more than a geographic expression. In Islamic times, the Arab geographers used the name arabicized as Suriyah, to denote one special region of Bilad al-Sham, which was the middle section of the valley of the Orontes river, in the vicinity of the towns of Homs and Hama. They also noted that it was an old name for the whole of Bilad al-Sham which had gone out of use. As a geographic expression, however, the name Syria survived in its original classical sense in Byzantine and Western European usage, and also in the Syriac literature of some of the Eastern Christian churches, from which it occasionally found its way into Christian Arabic usage. It was only in the nineteenth century that the use of the name was revived in its modern Arabic form, frequently as Suriyya rather than the older Suriyah, to denote the whole of Bilad al-Sham: first of all in the Christian Arabic literature of the period, and under the influence of Western Europe. By the end of that century it had already replaced the name of Bilad al-Sham even in Muslim Arabic usage.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahá'ís consider [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] and [[Haifa]] sacred as [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], was exiled to the prison of Acre from 1868 and spent his life in its surroundings until his death in 1892. In his writings he set the slope of [[Mount Carmel]] to host the [[Shrine of the Báb]] which his appointed successor [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] erected in 1909 as a beginning of the [[Terraces (Bahá'í)|terraced gardens]] there. The Head of the religion after him, [[Shoghi Effendi]], began building other structures and the [[Universal House of Justice]] continued the work until the [[Bahá'í World Centre]] was brought to its current state as the spiritual and administrative centre of the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Jay D.

'''Hyperreligiosity''' is a psychiatric disturbance in which a person experiences intense religious beliefs or experiences that interfere with normal functioning.  Hyperreligiosity generally includes [[delusions|abnormal beliefs]] and a focus on religious content, which interferes with work and social functioning.  Hyperreligiosity may occur in a variety of disorders including [[epilepsy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tucker|first1=D. M.|last2=Novelly|first2=R. A.|last3=Walker|first3=P.

'''''In Search of Noah's Ark''''' is a 1976 [[documentary film]] released by [[Sunn Classic Pictures]] that explores the alleged final resting place of [[Noah's Ark]].

==Production notes==
''In Search of Noah's Ark'' was produced by [[Sunn Classic Pictures]], a [[Utah]]-based [[independent film]] company that specialized in releasing [[Low-budget film|low-budget]] family films and documentaries. Along with such features as ''[[Beyond and Back]]'' (1978) and ''[[In Search of Historic Jesus]]'' (1979), the film was one of a series of releases from the company that attempted to present convincing scientific evidence for [[Christian theology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies.amctv.com/movie/1978/Beyond+and+Back ''Beyond and Back'', AMC Movie Guide.] [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]. Retrieved July 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of the film were shot in [[Park City, Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=D'Arc|first1=James V.|title=When Hollywood came to town: a history of moviemaking in Utah|date=2010|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Layton, Utah|isbn=9781423605874|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was based on the book by David Balsiger. Filmed independently and inexpensively, the documentary makes the assertion that Noah's Ark, from the [[Genesis flood narrative|biblical flood narrative]], has been found on [[Mountains of Ararat|the slopes]] of [[Mount Ararat]] in [[Turkey]], though physical and political difficulties prevent a more extensive study of the alleged vessel. The movie included a dramatic re-enactment of Noah's story as one of its highlights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianfilmdatabase.com/review/in-search-of-noahs-ark/ ''In Search of Noah's Ark'' at Christian Film Database.] [[Christian Film Database|CFDb]]. Retrieved July 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''In Search of Noah's Ark'' grossed $55.7 million at the North American box office&lt;ref name="box office"/&gt;&lt;ref name="numbers"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1977/0ISNA.php|publisher=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]]|title=''In Search of Noah's Ark'', Box Office Information|accessdate=July 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the [[1976 in film|sixth highest grossing film of 1976 in the United States]].

Various terms have been used to refer to the '''religious beliefs of the 175 ethnolinguistic groups of the Philippines''', where each had their own form of indigenous government prior to colonization from Islam and Spain. They are characterized as being [[Animism|animistic]], and have been collectively referred to as '''Anitism''' or '''Bathalism''' or the more modern and less Tagalog-centric '''Dayawism'''.&lt;ref name="Almocera2005"&gt;Almocera, Ruel A., (2005) Popular Filipino Spiritual Beliefs with a proposed Theological Response. in Doing Theology in the Philippines.

The profusion of different terms arises from the fact that these indigenous religions mostly flourished in the pre-colonial period before the Philippines had become a single nation.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Scott  | first = William Henry  | authorlink = William Henry Scott (historian)   | coauthors =  | title = Barangay: Sixteenth Century Philippine Culture and Society  | publisher = Ateneo de Manila University Press  | date = 1994  | location = Quezon City  | isbn = 971-550-135-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The various peoples of the Philippines spoke different languages and thus used different terms to describe their religious beliefs.   While these beliefs can be treated as separate religions, scholars have noted that they follow a "''common structural framework of ideas''" which can be studied together.&lt;ref name="SitoyJr1985"/&gt;

Some writers have noted that these beliefs have similarities with the [[Shinto]] religion of [[Japan]], although they do not draw a historical linkage between the two belief systems.&lt;ref name="Gutierrez2017"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=mYEoDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA160&amp;lpg=PA160&amp;dq=anito+Philippines+shinto&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eXCig7dTQ9&amp;sig=1HJUBcwvyTpVNsBipF2PStnEh-U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-sLWXt9TXAhWBuZQKHam4BhQQ6AEIggEwDg#v=onepage&amp;q=anito%2520Philippines%2520shinto&amp;f=false |title=Mixed Magic: Global-local Dialogues in Fairy Tales for Young Readers |last=Gutierrez |first=Anna Katrina |date=2017-06-15 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |isbn=9789027265456 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; More historically linked are the various indigenous religious beliefs the various religions of Oceania and the maritime Southeast Asia, which draw their roots from Austronesian beliefs as those in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Osborne2004"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Osborne  | first = Milton  | authorlink = Milton Osborne  | coauthors =  | title = Southeast Asia: An Introductory History  | publisher = Allen &amp; Unwin  | date = 2004  | location = Australia  | pages =  | volume =  | edition = Ninth  | url =  | doi =  | id =    | isbn = 1-74114-448-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, an estimated 2% of the Philippine population identified as practicing indigenous beliefs - the majority of whom live in isolated areas where [[Islam]], [[Catholicism]], or [[Protestantism]] have not become dominant. Since the entrance of the 21st century, streams of Christian and Muslim Filipinos are steadily reverting to their indigenous ethnic religions that were once branded as lowly by Spanish, American, and Arabians colonizers, but have been affirmed by the social sciences as comprehensive and highly in nature.&lt;ref name=pew&gt;[http://www.globalreligiousfutures.org/countries/philippines/religious_demography Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project: Philippines]. [[Pew Research Center]]. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, many aspects of these traditions have been integrated into the local practice of Catholicism and Islam, resulting in syncretistic practices called "[[Folk Catholicism]]"&lt;ref name="Almocera2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maggay1999"/&gt; and "[[Folk Islam]]".&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;

The folklore narratives associated with these religious beliefs constitute what is now called [[Philippine mythology]], and is an important aspect of the study of [[Philippine culture]] and [[Filipino psychology]].

== Religious worldview ==
{{Main|Anito}}
[[File:Ifugao sculpture Louvre 70-1999-4-1.jpg|thumb|15th century ''[[bulul]]'', an ''[[anito]]'' representation, with a ''pamahan'' (ceremonial bowl) in the [[Louvre Museum]]]]
Historian T. Valentino Sitoy, in his review of documents concerning pre-Spanish religious beliefs, notes that three core characteristics which shaped the religious worldview of Filipinos throughout the archipelago before the arrival of Spanish colonizers. First, Filipinos believed in the existence of parallel [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|spirit world]], which was invisible but had an influence on the visible world.  Second, Filipinos believed that there were spirits (''[[anito]]'') everywhere - ranging from the high creator gods to minor spirits that lived in the environment such as trees or rocks or creeks. Third, Filipinos believed that events in the human world were influenced by the actions and interventions of these spirit beings.&lt;ref name="SitoyJr1985"/&gt;

''Anito'' were the [[ancestor spirit]]s (''umalagad''), or nature spirits and deities (''[[diwata]]'') in the indigenous [[Animism|animistic]] religions of [[History of the Philippines (900–1521)|precolonial Philippines]]. ''Paganito'' (also ''maganito'' or ''anitohan'') refers to a [[séance]], often accompanied by other rituals or celebrations, in which a shaman ([[Visayan languages|Visayan]]: ''[[babaylan]]'', [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]: ''[[katalonan]]'') acts as a [[mediumship|medium]] to communicate directly with the spirits. When a nature spirit or deity is specifically involved, the ritual is called ''pagdiwata'' (also ''magdiwata'' or ''diwatahan''). ''Anito'' can also refer to the act of worship or a religious sacrifice to a spirit.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rosa"&gt;{{cite book|author=Antonio Sánchez de la Rosa|title =Diccionario Hispano-Bisaya para las provincias de Samar y Leyte, Volumes 1-2|publisher =Tipo-Litografia de Chofre y Comp.|year =1895|page=414|url =https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=7EwHAQAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Spanish missionaries arrived in the Philippines, the word "''anito''" came to be associated with the physical representations of spirits that featured prominently in ''paganito'' rituals. During the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American rule of the Philippines (1898–1946)]], the meaning of the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''idolo'' ("a thing worshiped") has been further conflated with the English word "[[Cult image|idol]]", and thus ''anito'' has come to refer almost exclusively to the carved figures or statues (''taotao'') of ancestral and nature spirits.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sawyer"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederic H. Sawyer|title =The Inhabitants of the Philippines|publisher =Charles Scribner's Sons|year =1900|url =https://archive.org/details/inhabitantsofphi00sawy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The belief in ''anito'' is sometimes referred to as [[anitism]] in scholarly literature (Spanish: ''anitismo'' or ''anitería'').&lt;ref name="hislop"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stephen K. Hislop|year=1971|title=Anitism: a survey of religious beliefs native to the Philippines |journal=Asian Studies|volume=9|issue=2|pages=144&amp;ndash;156|url=http://www.asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-09-02-1971/hislop-anitism-survey-religious%20beliefs-native-philippines.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deities and spirits ==
{{Main|Deities of Philippine mythology}}

=== Creator gods in Filipino religions ===
Many indigenous Filipino cultures assert the existence of a high god, creator god, or sky god.&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991" /&gt;  Among the Tagalogs, the supreme god was known as [[Bathala]], who was additionally described as Maykapal (the all-powerful) or  Lumikha (the creator).  Among the Visayan peoples the creator God is referred to as [[Laon]], meaning "the ancient one."  Among the Manuvu, the highest god was called Manama.  Among most of the Cordilleran peoples (with the Apayao region as an exception), the creator and supreme teacher is known as [[Kabuniyan]].&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991" /&gt;

In most cases, however, these gods were considered such great beings that they were too distant for ordinary people to approach.&lt;ref name="Maggay1999"/&gt;  People thus tended to pay more attention to "lesser gods" or "assistant deities" who could more easily approached, and whose wills could more easily be influenced.&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maggay1999"/&gt;

=== "Lower gods" in Filipino religions===
Lesser deities in Filipino religions generally fit into three broad categories: nature spirits residing in the environment, such as a mountain or a tree; guardian spirits in charge of specific aspects of daily life such as hunting or fishing; and deified ancestors or tribal heroes.  These categories frequently overlap, with individual deities falling into two or more categories, and in some instances, deities evolve from one role to another, as when a tribal hero known for fishing becomes a guardian spirit associated with hunting.&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991"/&gt;

==Filipino folk healers==
{{Unreferenced section|auto=yes|date=December 2009}}
During the pre-Hispanic period, ''[[babaylan]]'', functioned as shamans and spiritual leaders and ''[[mananambal]]'' were for folk healers.  At the onset of the Colonial era, the suppression of the ''babaylans'' and the native Filipino religion gave rise to the ''[[albularyo]]''. By exchanging the native prayers and spells with Catholic ''oraciones'' and Christian prayers, the albularyo was able to synchronize the ancient mode of healing with the new religion.

''Albularyos'' employ herbs, [[alum]], coconut oil, etc., in their healing practices as well as various prayers, chants and "supernatural" cures—especially for cases involving supernatural causes. As time progressed, the ''albularyo'' became more prominent in rural areas in the Philippines. Lacking access to scientific medical practices, rural Filipinos trusted the ''albularyos'' to rid them of common (and sometimes believed to be supernatural) sicknesses and diseases.

However, the role of the ''albularyo'' was slowly overshadowed by the rise of modern medical facilities. Urbanization gave the masses access to more scientific treatments, exchanging the chants and herbs of the ''albularyos'' with the newer technologies offered by the medical field. Still, ''albularyos'' flourish in many rural areas in the Philippines where medical facilities are still expensive and sometimes inaccessible.

===Rituals===

'''Kan-Laon''' is the name of an ancient [[Visayan people|Visayan]] deity. During pre-[[Hispanic]] times, the deity was worshiped by indigenous people as their Supreme Ruler. In the Visayan language, Kan-Laon means "One Who Is the Ruler Of Time."

[[Kanlaon Volcano]], is the largest active stratovolcano in the [[Philippines]] and highest peak in the [[Visayas]] region, specifically [[Negros (Philippines)|Negros]], where it is situated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinoymountaineer.com/2008/02/mt-kanlaon-wasay-guintubdan-trails-2435.html Pinoy Moutaineer: Mount Kanlaon]. Accessed August 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The volcano is said to be where '''Laon''' made his presence felt to the people. In ancient times, native priests and priestesses (''[[babaylan]]'') would climb up the volcano and do rituals every good harvest season or when there was a special ceremony. They would also offer gifts as a sign of respect. 

Kan-Laon has many counterparts all over the [[Philippines|Philippine archipelago]]. Some of the more popular are [[Bathala]] of the [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]]s, [[Gugurang]] of the [[Bicolano people|Bicolanos]], and [[Kabunian]] of the [[Ilocano people|Ilocano]]s and [[Ifugao]]s.

{{Expand Japanese|聞得大君|date=July 2017}}
{{nihongo|'''Kikoe-ōgimi'''|聞得大君|}} was the highest ranking ''[[Noro (priestess)|noro priestess]]'' of the [[Ryukyuan religion]] during the period of the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]].

The position of kikoe-ōgimi was formally established during the reign of King [[Shō Shin]] (r. 1477-1526) in order to centralize the religious order. Only a royal woman could be appointed to the position of kikoe-ōgimi.

After Ryukyu's annexation by Japan in 1879, this position was formally abolished, but the last kikoe-ōgimi continued her role until her death in 1944.

'''''Kélé''''' is an [[Afro-Saint Lucian]] religion, originated from the [[Djiné]] people of the [[Babonneau]] region. Its primary deities are [[Ogoun|Ogun]], [[Shango]] and [[Eshu]]. ''Kélé'' ceremonies include the drumming of the ''tanbou manman'' (''mother drum'') and the ''tanbou ich'' (''child drum'') of the [[Batá drum]] family.
The religion has its origins in African slaves of the [[Babonneau]] region. The religion is strongly connected to the [[Ogun]] festival in Nigeria. Repressed by the Roman Catholic church until the early 1960s, it had been practiced in secrecy underground. The ritual includes the display of smooth stones (one of Shango's worship items) and iron/steel items in honor of Ogun.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=uspTNzJ_NoYC&amp;pg=PA381&amp;lpg=PA381&amp;dq=st+lucia+kele&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tPoEjsH0Nc&amp;sig=-Zu4nPy9eZGO8ohv4Gpcb-7Uu6Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjBpeqa08_JAhWOoYMKHfucDZUQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=st%20lucia%20kele&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; The faith itself is believed to be a Saint Lucian version of [[Yoruba religion]].&lt;ref name="Holloway2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph E.

The '''Leipzig Human Rights Award''' is an honor given by the European-American Citizens Committee for Human Rights and Religious Freedom in the USA, which recognizes "efforts towards [[human rights]] and [[freedom of expression]] in the USA" and actions against what the organization refers to as "human rights violations by the [[totalitarian]] [[Scientology]]."&lt;ref name="cisar"&gt;{{cite news | last =Cisar | first =Joe |  title =Introduction from American Co-Moderator | work =Leipzig Award |    date =June 3, 2000 | url =http://www.leipzig-award.org/englisch/preisverleihung_2000.htm | accessdate =  2007-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to 2001, the honor was known as the '''Alternative Charlemagne Award'''.&lt;ref name="cisar" /&gt;

Former [[Scientology controversy|Scientology critic]] [[Bob Minton]] received the first award in 2000.  Other notable recipients of the award include former German Federal Minister of Labor [[Norbert Blüm]], former [[Secretary of State]] of [[France]], [[Alain Vivien]] and [[Operation Clambake]] founder [[Andreas Heldal-Lund]].  [[Psychologist]] [[Margaret Singer]] was selected at the 2003 ceremony to be the 2004 Award recipient, but she died shortly thereafter and no award was given in that year.

==History==

===Formation===
Originally begun as the "Alternative Charlemagne Award," the honor was formed as a counterpoint to the [[Karlspreis|Charlemagne Award]] given to [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] in 2000.&lt;ref name="winkel2000"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Winkel   | first =Achim  |  title =Alternative Charlemagne Award for Scientology Critic from the USA  | work =Badische Neueste Nachrichten   |    date =May 31, 2000  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Presented in [[Aachen, Germany]], the Charlemagne Award, or Karlspreis, "honors individuals who promote democracy, human rights and the common values of Europe."&lt;ref name="singer2004" /&gt;  The original title of the Leipzig Human Rights Award was so-named as a way of criticizing the relationship between the [[Church of Scientology]] and the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton Administration]], which granted Scientology [[tax exemption]] status during Clinton's term in office.&lt;ref name="evers2000"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Evers    | first =Bernd   |  title =Scientology: Criticism of the Charlemagne Award for U.S. President Clinton  | work =Neue Bildpost  | pages =Nr. 23, Page 1  |   date =June 1, 2000  |  accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The European-American Citizens Committee for Human Rights and Religious Freedom in the USA was formed in 1997, and includes committee members from [[Germany]], the [[United States]], [[England]], [[Austria]], [[Russia]] and [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name="freie2003" /&gt;  The Committee opposes "physical and psychological abuse of humans under the pretext of religion."&lt;ref name="freie2003" /&gt;  The organization notes that their criticism of the United States for "its failure to confront Scientology’s human rights abuses while promoting the cult around the world" has made the Award controversial, and states that all past recipients of the Award have been targeted by the Church of Scientology as [[Suppressive person]]s, and subjected to the Church's [[Fair game (Scientology)|Fair Game policy]].&lt;ref name="singer2004" /&gt;  Award recipients do not receive financial compensation as part of the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =Distinction for Ex-Minister Blüm  | work =[[Bild-Zeitung]]  |    date =May 31, 2001  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =Leipzig Human Rights Award for French Cult Commissioner  | work =EPD Press agency|    date =May 11, 2002  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization's charter cites its concern over the deaths of [[Lisa McPherson]] and [[Patrice Vic]], and states "We wish to express our support for the American people and the American government in ending human rights violations against US citizens and other people, committed by the Scientology Organization."&lt;ref name="charter"&gt;{{cite news  | last =European-American Citizens Committee for Human Rights and Religious Freedom in the USA |   title =Charter | work =Leipzig Award |    date = | url =http://www.leipziger-preis.de/englisch/grundsatztext.htm  | accessdate =  2007-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, the Leipzig Human Rights Award charter calls on the United States to reestablish "true freedom of life, speech, religion, personality and pursuit of happiness," and emphasizes [[freedom of speech]], freedom for members of an organization to leave that organization without fear of retribution, freedom from [[blackmail]] through materials obtained during spiritual counseling, and calls on the United States for full disclosure of "secret agreements" between the [[Internal Revenue Service]] and the Church of Scientology.&lt;ref name="charter" /&gt;

===Award recipients===
Bob Minton, at the time a prominent critic of Scientology, received the first award in 2000 as the Alternative Charlemagne Award.&lt;ref name="berliner2000"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =HONORED: Alternative Charlemagne Award to U.S. American  | work =[[Berliner Zeitung]]  |    date =June 5, 2000  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In her speech at the event, [[Scientology Task Force of the Hamburg Interior Authority]] Commissioner [[Ursula Caberta]] cited Minton's recognition of "what dangers could arise for people and liberal democracy from Scientology."&lt;ref name="berliner2000" /&gt;  Minton had provided former members of Scientology with financial and legal assistance after they had left the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =Robert S. Minton  | work =[[Frankfurter Rundschau]]  |    date =June 3, 2000  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the awards ceremony, Sect Commissioner of the Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg Thomas Gandow stated "By holding this ceremony, we intended to give a sign that, in spite of the Clinton administration, there are people in America who think differently and who do not swim with the Scientology tide."&lt;ref name="wiarda" /&gt;  Gandow cited Minton's actions as chairman of the [[Lisa McPherson Trust]] helping former members of Scientology make claims against the organization in court.&lt;ref name="wiarda" /&gt;  The Church of Scientology was critical of Minton being honored, and formed its own organization opposed to the Leipzig Human Rights Award, and on May 29, 2000 sent letters to bishops of the [[Evangelical Church Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia|Evangelical State Churches in Berlin-Brandenburg]] and [[Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Saxony|Saxony]].&lt;ref name="schade2000"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Schade   | first =Thomas   |  title =Dispute involves millionaire Minton: A citizens committee squares off with Scientology in Leipzig and gives out the first Alternative Charlemagne Award  | work =Sächs.

Former German Federal Minister of Labor Norbert Blüm was honored with the 2001 Leipzig Human Rights Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =Human Rights Award for Blüm  | work =Bremer Nachrichten  |    date =June 10, 2001  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Blüm was recognized because he had "championed human rights and religious freedom in the discussion with the totalitarian Scientology Organization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =Blüm receiving "Alternative Charlemagne Award 2001" Leipzig, Germany  | work =Berliner Zeitung   |    date = February 26, 2001  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Award again contained a picture of Leipzig's St. Nicholas Church, and Blüm was presented with the Award at a ceremony in Leipzig at a site near the [[Leipzig Trade Fair]] on June 10, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =Norbert Blüm receives "Alternative Charlemagne Award" for human rights  | work =[[Deutsche Presse-Agentur]]  |    date =February 25, 2001  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leipziger2001" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =Blüm receives Human Rights Award in Leipzig  | work =freiepresse  |   publisher =Chemnitzer Verlag und Druck GmbH &amp; Co.

For instance they threatened me by saying they would distribute their dossier on me to television. They've called me all kinds of names in their newspaper: the "Rasputin" of politics, for example."&lt;ref name="junge2001"&gt;{{cite news  | last =Lehmann | first = Anna |  title = "Congratulations Mr. Blüm, on your well deserved award of recognition": How should one deal with Imperialists? jW speaks with human rights award winner Norbert Blüm (CDU) | work =[[junge Welt]]  |    date =June 11, 2001  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Blüm also stated in the interview that he did not support a ban on Scientology in Germany, but rather sought to foster the distribution of information about the organization.&lt;ref name="junge2001" /&gt;  He also compared what he saw as [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] similarities between the ideologies of [[L.

{{POV|date=February 2017}}
&lt;!--If you are here to undo an edit revert or to create an edit regarding a legendary figure, please read this paragraph. Legendary persons will be removed from this list, with no exceptions. "Legendary persons" includes figures such as Abraham, the Saptarishi, etc. Note, this is not meant to say your religious figure never existed, it is meant to say that sufficient evidence has not been discovered to certainly ascertain when they lived or what they did beyond a reasonable doubt. If this occurs, please do not simply revert the deletion of your edit or edits. Gain consensus on the talk page before you make your next edit. You have the right to your beliefs, but Wikipedia is dedicated to a neutral standpoint that, while non-exclusive, will not permit edits based on claims stipulated by religions, if they are not historically relevant or established. In other words, we will not present evidence contrary to current historical findings just because your religion says it's true.--&gt;

This article lists [[historical figure]]s credited with founding [[religion]]s or [[religious philosophy|religious philosophies]] or people who first codified older known religious traditions. It also lists those who have founded a specific major [[Religious denomination|denomination]] within a larger religion.

==Ancient (before AD 500)==
:''See [[culture hero]] for legendary founders of doubtful historicity. If you intend to add figures that fall into this category, please add them in [[List of founders of religious traditions#Legendary/semi-historical|the allotted section]].''
&lt;!--only add HISTORICAL INDIVIDUALS
in cases where historicity is disputed (e.g. Solomon, Ezra), cite a reference establishing that the mainstream opinion in scholarship tends to assume historicity, or admit historicity is plausible.
DO NOT ADD individuals if only a minority or fringe view claims historicity (e.g. Odin, Rama, Yellow Emperor).

| [[Abraham]] || [[Judaism]] || [[Yahweh#Iron Age II (930–586 BCE): Yahweh as God of Israel|Yahwists]]&lt;ref group="n"&gt;The religion of the Israelites of Iron Age I was based on a cult of ancestors and worship of family gods, the "gods of the fathers". With the emergence of the monarchy at the beginning of Iron Age II the kings promoted their family god, YHWH (Yahweh), as the god of the kingdom, but beyond the royal court, religion continued to be both polytheistic and family-centered. As such, this founding group is referred to as "Yahwists" as they were neither truly Israelites nor truly Jews.&lt;/ref&gt;|| [[Israelites#Historical Israelites|Levantine]]  || c. 13th&lt;ref name="Albertz1994p61"&gt;[[#Albertz1994|Albertz 1994]], p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grabbe 2008, pp. 225–6"&gt;Grabbe 2008, pp. 225–6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biblical Peoples and Ethnicity: An Archaeological Study of Egyptians, Canaanites, Philistines, and Early Israel, 1300–1100 B.C.E.|year=2005|publisher=Society of Biblical Literature|last=Killebrew|first=Ann E.|isbn=978-1-58983-097-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VtAmmwapfVAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Biblical+peoples+and+ethnicity:+an+archaeological#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 8th century BC&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Israel emerges into the historical record in the last decades of the 13th century BCE, at the very end of the Late Bronze Age, as the Canaanite city-state system was ending. In the words of archaeologist William Dever, "most of those who came to call themselves Israelites … were or had been indigenous Canaanites". The worship of YHWH (Yahweh) alone began at the earliest with Elijah in the 9th century BCE, but more likely with the prophet Hosea in the 8th; even then it remained the concern of a small party before gaining ascendancy in the exilic and early post-exilic period.&lt;/ref&gt;

| style="text-align:center;"| 3150&amp;nbsp;BCE–30&amp;nbsp;BCE
| Egyptian pharaohs were kings of [[Ancient Egypt]], and were considered gods by their culture. Their titles equated them with aspects of the likes of the hawk god [[Horus]], the vulture goddess [[Nekhbet]], and the cobra-goddess [[Wadjet]]. The Egyptians believed that when their Pharaoh died, he would continue to lead them in the next life, which is why his burial was grand and completed to perfection—to please him in the next life and ensure his immortality to protect his people.  See [[List of pharaohs]].&lt;ref&gt;"The rulers of Egypt, first the kings and later the pharaohs, were gods as well as men who ruled by divine right. Each king was 'the son of god', who at the point of death became one with his father, a god in a cosmic [[Heaven]]." Christopher Knight, Robert Lomas (August 1, 2001). The Hiram Key: Pharaohs, Freemasons and the Discovery of the Secret Scrolls of Jesus, 100. {{ISBN|978-1-931412-75-9}}. Available in print from Fair Winds.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The king had a [[superhuman]] role, being a manifestation of a god or of various deities on earth. The king's principle original title, the [[Horus]] name, proclaimed that he was an aspect of one of the chief gods, Horus, a sky god who was depicted as a falcon. Other identifications were added to this one, notably, "Son of [[Ra|Re]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[the sun god]&lt;/nowiki&gt;" and "Perfect God," both introduced during the 4th dynasty (''c.'' 2575–2465&amp;nbsp;BC), when the great [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]] were constructed. The epithet "Son of Re" placed the king in a close but dependent relation with the leading figure of the pantheon."{{cite book | author=Merriam-Webster | title=Encyclopedia of World Religions (Hardcover) | publisher=Merriam Webster, Incorporated | year=1999 | isbn=978-0-87779-044-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| The Natchez were a theocracy ruled by "The Great Sun." This ruler has sometimes been deemed a God-king.&lt;ref&gt;The community leader would be called the Great Sun. Natchez social organization was based on the relationship of community members to the Great Sun. In the 17th century, French explorers and colonists met this leader, who lived in a large house on the top of a platform mound at the site that is now preserved by the State of Mississippi as the Grand Village of the Natchez. The Great Sun enjoyed the status of a living god [https://web.archive.org/web/20051106032654/http://www.uark.edu/depts/contact/natchez.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars, notably [[Andrea Carandini]] believe in the historicity of Romulus, in part because of the 1988 discovery of the ''[[Murus Romuli]]'' on the north slope of the Palatine Hill in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Carandini.

The title was bestowed upon him by Egyptian priests of the god [[Amun|Ammon]] at the [[Oracle]] of the god at the [[Siwa Oasis|Siwah oasis]] in the [[Libyan Desert]].&lt;ref&gt;"Not the least of the many extraordinary facts about Alexander is that both in his lifetime and after his death he was worshipped as a god, by [[Greeks]] and [[Ancient Macedonians]] as well as, for example, Egyptians (to whom he was Pharaoh). The episode that led to [[Callisthenes]]' death in 327 was connected to this fact. Greeks and Ancient Macedonians believed that formal obeisance should be paid only to gods. So the refusal of his Greek and Macedonian courtiers to pay it to Alexander implied that they, at any rate, did not believe he genuinely was a living god, at least not in the same sense as Zeus or Dionysus were. Alexander, regardless, did nothing to discourage the view that he really was divine. His claim to divine birth, not merely divine descent, was part of a total self-promotional package, which included the striking of silver medallions in India depicting him with the attributes of [[Zeus]]. Through sheer force of personality and magnitude of achievement he won over large numbers of ordinary Greeks and Macedonians to share this view of himself, and to act on it by devoting shrines to his [[cult]]."{{cite journal |quotes= |last=Cartledge |first=Paul |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2004 |month= |title=Alexander the Great |journal=History Today |volume=54 |issue= |page=1 |id= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pauline epistles]] from the early second half of the 1st century CE offer the earliest references to Jesus as the [[Son of God]] (See {{Bibleref2|Romans|1}} for example). The [[First Council of Nicaea]] of 325 AD crystallized this notion in the [[Nicene creed]] and declared Jesus [[Incarnation (Christianity)|God Incarnate]]. Early Christian denominations with different christologies such as the [[Ebionites]] fell in popularity, and he is now considered divine in most [[Jesus in Christianity|Christian views of Jesus]] ([[God the Son]] in Trinitarian Christianity).

[[Image:Religion in SF.png|thumb|300px|Science fiction often portrays real religions being exported to alien planets]]
[[Science fiction]] will sometimes address the topic of [[religion]]. Often [[List of religious ideas in fantasy fiction|religious themes]] are used to convey a broader message, but others confront the subject head-on—contemplating, for example, how attitudes towards faith might shift in the wake of ever-advancing technological progress, or offering creative scientific explanations for the apparently mystical events related in religious texts (gods as aliens, prophets as time travelers, etc.).  As an exploratory medium, science fiction rarely takes religion at face value by simply accepting or rejecting it; when religious themes are presented, they tend to be investigated deeply.

Some science fiction works portray invented religions, either placed into a contemporary Earth society (such as the [[Earthseed]] religion in [[Octavia Butler]]'s ''[[Parable of the Sower]]''), or in the far future (as seen in ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' by [[Frank Herbert]], with its [[Orange Catholic Bible]]).  Other works examine the role of existing religions in a futuristic or alternate society.  The classic [[Canticle for Leibowitz]] explores a world in which [[Catholicism]] is one of the few institutions to survive an apocalypse, and chronicles its slow re-achievement of prominence as civilisation returns.

[[Christian science fiction]] also exists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=John| last=Mort| title=Christian Fiction: a Guide to the genre| publisher=Libraries Unlimited| year=2002| isbn=1-56308-871-1| pages=159–184}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes written as [[allegory]] for inspirational purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Sammons| first=Martha C.| title="A Better Country": The Worlds of Religious Fantasy and Science Fiction| publisher=Greenwood Press| year=1988| isbn=0-313-25746-9| page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Orson Scott Card]] has criticized the genre for oversimplifying religion, which he claims is always shown as "ridiculous and false".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.writing-world.com/sf/card.shtml "On Religion in SF and Fantasy: An Interview with Orson Scott Card"]; Writing World online&lt;/ref&gt;

==Angels==
{{See also|Angels|List of fictional angels}}

*In ''[[Out of the Silent Planet]]'' (1938; part of the [[Space Trilogy]]), by [[C. S. Lewis]], the protagonist meets "eldila", mysterious beings of light native to the void of interplanetary space (who are actually what Christianity defines as "angels", and who are also identified as [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and other deities of [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]]), and are completely loyal and obedient to God, and have never wanted to be worshiped as gods themselves (although the ancient Greeks and Romans mistakenly did so)

==Creation myths==
{{See also|Creation myth|Cosmogony}}

* The film ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]'' (2012) explores the myth that human life did not arise spontaneously by chance, but that a humanoid species, the "Engineers", [[Ancient astronauts in popular culture|created life on Earth]]. They also taught humans how to use technology and visited the Earth sporadically.  Some elements are similar to the [[Ancient Aliens]] myths.  The story develops when a scientific expedition travels to confront their creators.{{disputed inline|date=January 2016}}&lt;!-- this template replaced the text &amp;lt;sup&gt;[Not a creation myth?]&lt;/sup&gt; --&gt;
* In the film ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982) based on [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'', Roy Batty is an [[Android (robot)|artificial person]] looking to confront his creator, while Rick Deckard searches for lost humanity despite his job: hunting and "retiring" runaway [[replicants]].{{disputed inline|date=January 2016}}&lt;!-- this template replaced the text &amp;lt;sup&gt;[Not a creation myth?]&lt;/sup&gt; --&gt;

* The short story ''[[The Last Question]]'' (1956) by [[Isaac Asimov]] – Humans of the future ask the [[supercomputer]] [[Multivac]] how the net amount of [[entropy]] of the universe can be massively decreased. Multivac fails, displaying the error message "INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER". The story continues through many iterations of computer technology, each more powerful and ethereal than the last. Each of these computers is asked the question, and each returns the same response until finally [[heat death of the universe|the universe dies]] with the exception of Cosmic AC – Multivac's final successor. At that point it has collected all the data it can, and so poses the question to itself. As the universe died, Multivac drew all of humanity into [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]], to preserve them until it could finally answer the Last Question. Ultimately, Multivac did decipher the answer, announcing "[[Let there be light|Let there be light!]]".
* The early part of [[Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' provides a detailed Creation myth, with the world being created through the singing of [[Angel]]-like beings under the direction of God. Similar to the [[Christian]] account of [[The War in Heaven]], this myth includes the rebellion of Melkor (equivalent of [[Lucifer]]/[[Satan]]) but considerably different in detail from the Christian account.

==Demons==
{{See also|Demons|List of fictional demons}}

* In the [[Doom series|''Doom'' series]] demons from Hell have come into the universe through an inter-dimensional portal which is located on Mars.
* In ''[[Princess of Wands]]'' by [[John Ringo]], a Christian housewife and soccer mom gets involved in an organization which co-operates with the FBI in dealing with demons.
* In ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'' by [[C. S. Lewis]], the villains of the story are guided by beings they call "macrobes" which are clearly meant to be demons.
* In ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' series, some of the villains of the story appear to be demons, beings of immense power and strength. They can be summoned by certain groups of people with arcane knowledge. They are known as daemons, and the people who hunt them, daemon hunters.

==Devil==
{{See also|Devil|Devil in popular culture}}

* The TV series, ''[[Futurama]]'', features a recurring character called the [[Robot Devil]]
* In the 1975 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[Pyramids of Mars]]", the Doctor states that Satan is one of the names the last of the Osirians, Sutekh (who considers all life his enemy), is known by.&lt;ref&gt;Doctor: "Serve you, Sutekh? Your name is abominated in every civilized world, whether that name be Set, Satan, Sodos..."&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 1978 sci-fi TV series ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'', the two part episode "[[War of the Gods (Battlestar Galactica)|War Of The Gods]]" features a character very much like the Devil who is portrayed by Patrick Macnee. His name is [[Count Iblis]] — Iblis being the Islamic name of the Devil.
* The 2006 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episodes "[[The Impossible Planet]]" and "[[The Satan Pit]]" feature an ancient being known as the Beast, which claims to be the basis of the Devil figure in all religions and mythologies; earlier in "[[The Dæmons]]", it is shown a race resembling the typical image of the Devil had visited Earth and become the basis for both Gods and Demons.
* In ''[[Perelandra]]'' by [[C. S. Lewis]], the protagonist must fight against a man possessed by a demon, hinted to be the devil himself.
* ''[[Ubik]]'' (1969) by [[Philip K. Dick]] - In the novel a company uses a form of [[cryonic]] suspension to give deceased limited consciousness and the ability to communicate. Ella is in such a state of "half-life" and instructs the protagonist who also appears to be in such a state on the usage of the spray "Ubik", whose name is derived from the Latin word "[[ubiquitous|ubique]]" (meaning "everywhere") which can preserve people who are in half-life. As the protagonist finds himself in an increasingly regressing world it is discovered that Jory Miller, another half-lifer, is the cause of this as he devours the life force of other people who are in [[suspended animation]] in order to prolong his own existence. While Ubik can be seen as a metaphor for God&lt;ref name="tessa"/&gt;&lt;ref name=fitting/&gt; Jory Miller can be seen as an allegorical representation of the Devil.&lt;ref name=fitting&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fitting|first1=Peter|title=''Ubik'': The Deconstruction of Bourgeois SF|url=http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/5/fitting5art.htm|website=depauw.edu|publisher=Science Fiction Studies|accessdate=27 June 2015|date=March 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the episode [[Rick and Morty (season 1)#ep9|"Something Ricked This Way Comes"]] (2014) of the science fiction comedy television series ''[[Rick and Morty]]'' a character "Summer" reports to her first job in an antique shop run by the Devil that sells items that fulfill a desire for the owner but come at a price making the item essentially worthless (the shop and the Devil's name, Mr. Needful, are both references and parodies of the [[Stephen King]] novel ''[[Needful Things]]''). During the episode a protagonist "Rick" sets up a competitive counter-business across the street that removes the [[curse]]s and runs the Devil out of business. The Devil is so dismayed that he tries to kill himself but Summer finds himself in the middle of his [[suicide]] attempt and revives him. They relaunch with a new dot-com company that becomes wildly successful. As it turns out, the Devil had no plans to include Summer in reaping the profits and has her hauled off by security. Betrayed by the Devil, she and Rick build muscle mass to get physical revenge.

==Eschatology and the ultimate fate of the universe==
{{See also|Eschatology|Ultimate fate of the universe|:Category:End of the universe in fiction}}
&lt;!--todo: descriptions/summaries--&gt;
* In the far future of ''[[Le Dernier Homme]]'' (1805) by [[Jean-Baptiste Cousin de Grainville]] Earth is becoming sterile and the human ability to reproduce is failing. A man travels to the last fertile woman to begin a rebirth of the human race and at return meets [[Adam]], the first man, who has been condemned by God to watch all the damned among his descendants enter Hell, and is now charged with persuading the pair not to prolong the life of humanity, which God has determined must now end. The world then begins to end the dead to rise from their graves while Ormus, the spirit of Earth, who cannot survive without humanity, despairs.
* ''[[Omega: The Last Days of the World]]'' (1894) by [[Camille Flammarion]]
* The poem ''[[Darkness (poem)|Darkness]]'' (1816) by [[Lord Byron]]

* ''[[City at the End of Time]]'' (2008) by [[Greg Bear]]
* ''[[That Extraordinary Day]]'' (2012) by [[Predrag Vukadinović]]
* At the end of ''[[Tau Zero]]'' (1970) by [[Poul Anderson]] the universe collapses in a [[big crunch]] and then explodes in a new [[big bang]]. However, the starship with the book's protagonists on board survives because there is still enough uncondensed hydrogen for maneuvering, outside the monobloc, and eventually they could colonize one of the new universe's planets.
* ''[[Manifold: Time]]'' (1999) by [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]] begins at the end of space and time, when the last descendants of humanity face an infinite but pointless existence. Due to [[proton decay]] the physical universe has collapsed, but some form of intelligence has survived by embedding itself into a lossless computing substrate where it can theoretically survive indefinitely.  However, because there will never be new input, eventually all possible thoughts will be exhausted.  Some portion of this intelligence decides that this should not have been the [[ultimate fate of the universe]], and takes action to change the past, centering around the early 21st century.
* ''[[Left Behind]]'' is a series of 16 best-selling novels by [[Tim LaHaye]] and [[Jerry B. Jenkins]], dealing with [[Christianity|Christian]] [[dispensationalism|dispensationalist]] [[End Times]]: the [[Pretribulationism|pretribulation]], [[Premillennialism|premillennial]], [[Christian eschatology|Christian eschatological]] viewpoint of the [[apocalypse|end of the world]]. The primary conflict of the series is the members of the Tribulation Force against the [[Global Community]] and its leader [[Nicolae Carpathia]]—the [[Antichrist]].  ''Left Behind'' is also the title of the first book in the series. The series was first published 1995–2007 by [[Tyndale House]], a firm with a history of interest in [[dispensationalism]].

==Evangelism==
{{See also|Evangelism}}

* In [[S. M. Stirling]]'s [[Nantucket series|''Nantucket'' series]], the entire island of [[Nantucket]] is suddenly transported into the past, to about 1300 BC and the modern Americans marooned in the past must make the best of the Bronze Age world in which they find themselves; the Christians among them face the dilemma of whether or not to embark on missionary activity and spread their religion - even though Jesus Christ had not yet been born, and the very act of their spreading Christianity might so fundamentally change the world that Jesus might never be born at all
* In ''[[The Sparrow (novel)|The Sparrow]]'', by [[Mary Doria Russell]], most of the Jesuit missionaries sent to investigate a radio transmission from an unknown planet (believing that they have been chosen by God to be the first to set foot on an alien world) are killed by the planet's inhabitants; and the sole survivor is enslaved but eventually escapes and returns to Earth with his faith in tatters

==Fictional religions==
{{See also|List of fictional religions}}
&lt;!--Inclusion criteria: there has to be an article on the fictional religion or at least a considerable coverage of it in the book's/film's article.--&gt;

* A main theme of [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' (1968) is the fictional religion "[[Mercerism]]". It is Earth's main religion, in which Empathy Boxes link simultaneous users into a [[collective consciousness]] based on the suffering of Wilbur Mercer. In the shared experience of the Empathy Box, Wilbur Mercer takes an endless walk up a mountain while stones are thrown at him, the pain of which all users share. Television broadcasts of "Buster Friendly" represent a second religion, designed to undermine Mercerism.
* The [[Earthseed]] religion in [[Octavia Butler]]'s ''[[Parable of the Sower (novel)|Parable of the Sower]]''
* The [[Vedek (Star Trek)|Bajoran religion]] – ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''
* ''Cavism'' in [[Gore Vidal]]'s novel ''[[Messiah (Vidal novel)|Messiah ]]'' - a religion founded by John Cave, an American undertaker. Cave teaches, among other things, not to fear death and to actually desire it under certain circumstances. Later followers come to glorify death, and even enforce it on other members. The founder John Cave is himself ironically killed by his followers when he proves inconvenient for the new religion's development. Cavism eventually completely displaces and destroys Christianity, even to the extent of all [[Gothic Cathedrals]] being blown up and destroyed to erase all trace of it.
* The [[Klingon culture#Religion|Klingon religion]] and various other religions from ''[[Star Trek]]''
* [[Bene Gesserit]], [[Buddislam]], Maometh Saari, [[Mahayana Christianity]], [[Zensunni|Zensunni Catholicism]] in [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' series
* [[Bokononism]] and  in ''[[Cat's Cradle]]'' by [[Kurt Vonnegut]]
* [[Chernobog]], the Satanic, cannibalistic, human-sacrificing god whose worship displaced Christianity in the remnants of [[Russia]] in the post-apocalyptic world of [[The Peshawar Lancers]] by [[S. M. Stirling]].  
* [[Church of All Worlds]] (inspired a non-fictional religious group of the same name) and other religions from ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'' by [[Robert A. Heinlein]]
* Church of the Second Chance in [[Philip José Farmer]]'s [[Riverworld]] series.
* [[Cylon (reimagining)#Religion|Cylon]] monotheistic religion – ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]''
* [[Lexx#Divine Order|Divine Order of His Shadow]] – ''[[Lexx]]'' TV series
* [[Religion in Futurama|Robotology, Robot Judaism, The First Amalgamated Church and other religions]] from the animated television program ''[[Futurama]]''
* [[Foundationism]] – ''[[Babylon 5]]''
* [[After Ford|Fordism]] – ''[[Brave New World]]''
* The [[Philosophy and religion in Star Wars|various religions]] ([[Sith]], [[Jedi]]) of ''[[Star Wars]]''
* Gorgolorism. In L. Sprague de Camp's ''The Goblin Tower'', the city state of Tarxia is a theocracy dominated by the priesthood of the frog god Gorgolor, who is cinsidered the One True God. In other places, Gorgolor is just a minor god in a big Pantheon. However, saying that in Tarxia might result in being burned as a heretic.
* [[Goa'uld]] religion – most Goa'uld pose as gods to control slave armies. "Goa'uld" means "God" in the [[Goa'uld language]] from the television series ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''
* Hemilkism in ''[[The Gate of Time]]'' by [[Philip José Farmer]] - in an [[alternate history]] where there never was a [[Roman Empire]] and European culture has many [[Abrahamic religions|Semitic]] elements, a major religion was founded in the Fourteenth Century by a charismatic Irish religious figure named [[Hamilcar |Hemilka]]. While having some resemblances to Christianity, Hemilkism is not an imperialist faith and therefore does not dominate its world in the way Christianity does in ours.
* Monism (specifically, Evangelical Monism) in [[Robert Heinlein]]'s ''[[Tunnel in the Sky]]''. In the last decades of the 21st Century, great waves of Monist proselyting swept out of [[Persia]] and numerous Westerners were converted. Two generations later, when the plot takes place, Evangelical Monism is one of the main religious denominations in the US, many American families observing the Monist ritual of lighting the Lamp of Peace during dinner. From references in the book, the Monist faith appears to be [[Deist]]ic, with a generalized acceptance of a deity having no particular defining characteristics or abilities, and including significant elements of [[Fire worship]] - suggesting the influence [[Mazdaism]], the pre-Islamic fire-worshiping religion of Persia. For such a religion to be strongly established in modern Persia/Iran implies a major upheaval in the position of Islam there - for which Heinlein provides no information [http://members.iglou.com/jtmajor/TunlSky.htm]. 
* [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]] religion - the main antagonist in ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' after the fall of the [[Goa'uld]]. Ori, ascended beings, relatives and mortal enemies of the [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancients]], thrive on the life force stolen from their worshippers. The clash is finally resolved in the movie ''[[Stargate: The Ark of Truth]]''.
* [[Church of Science]] – the bogus religion established by [[Salvor Hardin]] in [[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)|Foundation]]''
* ''Soterism'' - in the [[alternate history]] of [[L. Sprague de Camp]]'s ''[[Aristotle and the Gun]]'', Christianity never arose. Its place during the Roman Empire was taken by Soterism, an Egypto-Hellenic synthesis founded by a fiery Egyptian prophet, whose followers called him "Soter" - the Greek word for "Savior". Soterism did not become as powerful as  Christianity in the history we know, with [[Mitraism]] and [[Odin]]ism surviving at its side. In later times, followers of these religions hounded the scientist Georg Schwartzhorn (much as [[Galileo]] was persecuted in our history).   
* [[Church of Humanity Unchained]] - the primary religion of the [[Grayson (Honorverse)|Grayson]] and [[List of locations in the Honorverse#M|Masada]] systems in the [[Honorverse]]. (Two churches, with one origin, but now mutually implacably hostile, with massively different theologies.)
* In [[John Varley (author)|John Varley]]'s story "Equinoctial"&lt;ref&gt;Included in "Picnic on Nearside", New York, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;, the [[Rings of Saturn]] are inhabited by the followers of two mutually-antagonistic religions. ''The Church of Cosmic Engineering'' (informally ''The Engineers''), founded by Ringpainter the Great, considers it a Sacred Duty to paint red the Rings of Saturn - a duty holy enough to be worth the devoting of one's entire lifetime to it. The opposing ''Conservationist Church'' (''Consers'' in short) is equally certain that painting the Rings is the Ultimate Sacrilege and that undoing all such painting ''is'' the task to which one should devote one's life. The two are involved in a centuries-long, fierce [[religious war]] - both equally certain that the issue of painting or unpainting the Rings fully justifies killing on sight any member of the opposing Church (see [[Eight Worlds#Symbiotic spacesuits]]).

==God or deities==
{{See also|God|Deity|List of fictional deities}}

* ''[[Absolution Gap]]'' by [[Alastair Reynolds]]

* In the TV series ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', and the 1994 ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' film, the supposed ancient gods are revealed to be powerful, parasitic aliens posing as supernatural beings to exploit mankind. Stargate SG-1 later introduces the Ancients and the Ori, who are basically indistinguishable from actual gods - particularly the Ori who command worship and actually gain power by it.
* In the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode, "[[Who Watches the Watchers]]", a serious accident with a hidden scientific observation post starts a chain of events that leads to a primitive civilization becoming convinced that the [[Starfleet]] personnel are divine beings with Capt. [[Jean-Luc Picard]] being the supreme one; and the crew of the Enterprise struggle to prevent the reestablishment of religion in the civilization.
* In the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' episode "[[Who Mourns for Adonais?]]", the Enterprise crew encounters an alien figure who is the ancient Greek god, Apollo.
* In [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel, ''[[VALIS]]'', the protagonist faces an all-powerful God who subtly manipulates the actions and thoughts of humans in an effort to redeem humanity.
* ''[[Ubik]]'' (1969) by [[Philip K. Dick]] - The protagonist Joe Chip is part of a team that was hired to secure the lunar facilities of a company that uses a form of [[cryonic]] suspension to give deceased limited consciousness and the ability to communicate from telepaths.

* The protagonist of ''[[The Worthing Saga]]'', by [[Orson Scott Card]], keeps himself in hidden stasis over the years, and becomes the target of worship by the descendants of the very settlers that he delivered to a new world
* [[James K. Morrow]]'s [[James K. Morrow#The Godhead Trilogy|''Godhead'' trilogy]] considers the literal death of God, when the two-mile-long corpse of God is found floating at sea. In the first volume, ''[[Towing Jehovah]]'' (Harcourt Brace, 1994) the angel Raphael calls on supertanker captain Anthony Van Horne to tow the body to an icy tomb in the north, while the faithful and unbelieving alike seek to deal with the fallout of the death of God.
* In the short story ''[[The Last Question]]'' (1956) by [[Isaac Asimov]] humans of the future ask the [[supercomputer]] [[Multivac]] how the net amount of [[entropy]] of the universe can be massively decreased. Multivac fails, displaying the error message "INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER". The story continues through many iterations of computer technology, each more powerful and ethereal than the last. Each of these computers is asked the question, and each returns the same response until finally [[heat death of the universe|the universe dies]] with the exception of Cosmic AC – Multivac's final successor. At that point it has collected all the data it can, and so poses the question to itself. As the universe died, Multivac drew all of humanity into [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]], to preserve them until it could finally answer the Last Question. Ultimately, Multivac did decipher the answer, announcing "[[Let there be light|Let there be light!]]" and essentially ascending to the state of God [[Genesis 1:3|in the Old Testament]].
* In [[Sara Paretsky]]'s novel [[Ghost Country (novel)|Ghost Country]] an ancient [[Mesopotamia]]n [[Fertility goddess]] calling herself Starr appears in present-day [[Chicago]]. She exudes an overwhelming sexuality, affecting both men and women, and attracts an enormous crowd of worshipers, especially from among Chicago's poor and homeless. To the chagrin and scandal of Protestant and Catholic clergy alike, she emulates many of the miracles of Jesus Christ - feeding many people with minute amounts of food, healing the sick and also bringing the dead back to life. Finally she is lynched by a mob of bigoted Christians inside one of the city's most prestigious churches - but her body unaccountably disappears from the morgue three days later, though no one actually saw her rise. Thus disappearing, she has had an enormous - and on whole, positive - impact on the lives of all the book's cast of characters.
* In the universal roleplaying setting Nova Praxis, a supercomputer with the ability to process theoretical environments encompassing all laws of physics, was created. It started inventing all kinds of obscure technology and jumped human technology and civilization forwards by over a millennium, before suddenly shutting down after 3 months of work, likely due to system overload. The computer, called Mimir (Pronounced "me-mer"), is considered by some to be a deity, prophesied to return to gift humanity with the ultimate ascension, and the virtual-reality library that contains all the data produced by "her", called "The black library" due to its black-and-white design, is considered a holy place of pilgrimage. &lt;ref&gt;Nova Praxis, Savage Worlds edition, Void Star Studios&lt;/ref&gt;

* "The Reformers" (''[[Weird Science (comic)|Weird Science]]'' #20) — When three space men dressed in scifi versions of religious garb land on a planet to "free it of evil;" they are greeted by a man named Peter who informs them they are not needed (for there is no crime, no immorality, nor any of the evils seen in other societies); so they plan to create evil for which they can blame literature, clothing, and alcohol (as they have done on previous worlds)—including Earth—they are contracted by their leader (the Devil) who informs that their efforts are doomed...because they have landed in Heaven.
* In an [[Alternate ending|alternate scene]] of ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]'' (2012) astronaut Elizabeth Shaw who survived the clash with god-like aliens who turned out to be rather malicious asks the [[Artificial general intelligence|AI]] David to navigate a stranded alien spaceship toward where the alien came from instead of back to Earth, saying "I don't want to go back to where we came from...I want to go where they came from...I want to go to paradise."&lt;ref&gt;[http://alienexplorations.blogspot.de/2012/07/questions-about-god-and-paradise-lost.html Questions about God and Paradise Lost (Source Quotes)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=alternatescene&gt;Quote from the alternate scene:

''David'': The pouch in my utility belt...the other pouch.&lt;br/&gt;
...even after all this...you still believe, don't you?&lt;br/&gt;
''Elizabeth Shaw'': You said you could figure out their navigation....use their maps.&lt;br/&gt;
''David'': Yes, of course. Once we get to one of their other ships...finding a path to Earth should be relatively straightforward&lt;br/&gt;
''Elizabeth Shaw'': I don't want to go back to where we came from...I want to go where they came from...I want to go to paradise. You think you can do that, David?&lt;br/&gt;
''David'': Yes. I believe I can. May I ask what you hope to achieve by going there?&lt;br/&gt;
''Elizabeth Shaw'': They created us. And they tried to kill us. They changed their minds. I deserve to know why.&lt;br/&gt;
''David'': Does it matter why they changed their minds?&lt;br/&gt;
''Elizabeth Shaw'': Heh. Yeah...yes, it does.&lt;br/&gt;
''David'': I don't understand.&lt;br/&gt;
''Elizabeth Shaw'': Well, I guess that's because I'm a human being...and you're a fucking robot. Do you mind?&lt;br/&gt;
''David'': Mind?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Previously Shaw has been portrayed as a deeply religious person&lt;ref name=alternatescene/&gt; whose first encounter with the concept of heaven or paradise stems from when her mother died – a memory David coexperienced during Shaw's [[Sleeper ship|hypersleep]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prometheus Quotes: Striking Concept|url=http://www.moviequotesandmore.com/prometheus-quotes.html#1|accessdate=5 August 2015|quote=[on the ship, Prometheus, David checks on the crew who are in hypersleep, he gazes upon Shaw and sees what she's dreaming of, which is from her childhood when she is with her father in a foreign land looking at a funeral procession]&lt;br/&gt;''Young Shaw'': What happened to that man?&lt;br/&gt;''Shaw's Father'': He died.&lt;br/&gt;''Young Shaw'': Why aren't you helping them?&lt;br/&gt;''Shaw's Father'': They don't want my help.

''Elizabeth Shaw'': Before that thing ripped your head off, what did he say, David?&lt;br/&gt;
''David (AI)'': "Thing;" Dr. Shaw? Not too long ago, you considered them gods.&lt;br/&gt;
''Elizabeth Shaw'': God never tried to kill me. So... what did he say? Where did he come from?&lt;br/&gt;
''David'': There is no direct translation, but... Several of your ancient cultures had a word similar to it... "Paradise"&lt;br/&gt;

* [[H.G. Wells]]' ''[[A Modern Utopia]]'', takes place in an [[alternate timeline]] in which "Jesus Christ had been born into a liberal and progressive Roman Empire that spread from the Arctic Ocean to the Bight of Benin, and was to know no Decline and Fall" &lt;ref&gt;"A Modern Utopia," Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt; - with profound implications for Jesus' religious teachings, and later on those of [[Muhammad]]
* In ''[[Behold the Man (novel)|Behold the Man]]'', by [[Michael Moorcock]], twentieth-century [[Karl Glogauer]] (a Jew obsessed with the figures of Jesus and [[Carl Jung]]), travels in time to the year 28 A.D. where he meets various New Testament figures (such as [[John the Baptist]] and the [[Virgin Mary]]), and discovers that Mary and Joseph's child, Jesus, is a mentally retarded hunchback, who could never become the Jesus as is portrayed in the Scriptures, and after having a mental breakdown, steps into the role of Jesus, eventually dying on the cross (having specifically asked [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] to betray him)
* In ''[[The Didymus Contingency]]'', by [[Jeremy Robinson]], a scientist's time-travel to see Jesus' death and resurrection—only to witness several scenes not recorded in the New Testament (while realizing Jesus was a fraud)—faces the dilemma of whether or not to make a revelation in the present which would shake the foundations of Christianity is complicated further with the appearance of an assassin from a different future...&lt;ref&gt;Note: The Didymus of the title is the [[Thomas the Apostle|Apostle Saint Thomas]], whose initial skepticism of the resurrection earned him the title "[[Doubting Thomas]]".&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Last Starship from Earth]]'', by [[John Boyd (author)|John Boyd]], is set in a ''[[dystopian]]'' society in the very near future (in an alternate timeline) where Jesus Christ became a revolutionary agitator and was never subjected to crucifixion; and who overthrew the Roman Empire by force of arms, and established a theocracy that has lasted until the twentieth century
* In [[Garry Kilworth]]'s story ''[[Let's Go to Golgotha!]]'', tourists from the future can book a time-traveling "Crucifixion Tour", but before setting out, they are strictly told that, when the crowd is asked whether Jesus or [[Barabbas]] should be spared, they must all join the call: "Give us Barabbas!"—however, when the moment comes, the protagonist suddenly realizes that the crowd condemning Jesus to the cross is composed ''entirely'' of tourists from the future, and that no actual Jewish Israelites of 33 A.D. are present at all
* When the protagonists of [[Clifford Simak]]'s ''[[Mastodonia]]'' make trips to the past commercially available, American church groups band together and seek to purchase an exclusive franchise for Jesus' time on Earth—not because they want to go there but because they do not want anyone at all to go there (the clergymen state quite forthrightly their apprehension that time travel would disprove some of the accounts given in the Gospels and thus undermine Christianity)—when refused, the church groups turn aggressive and energetically lobby Congress to ban time travel altogether; opening an enormous theological debate unresolved by the end of the book
* [[Ray Bradbury]]'s 1949 story "The Man," reprinted in ''[[The Illustrated Man]]'', tells of a miracle worker who matches the description of Jesus and who travels from planet to planet, healing and teaching. When a spaceship lands on one such planet and is told that the miracle worker had been there just the day before, the arrogant captain vows to chase him down through space until he catches him. After the captain blasts off again in search of the man, another spaceman, who chose to remain behind because of his faith having been awakened by the faith of the people on that planet, is told that the man is still there.
* In ''[[The Rescuer]]'', by [[Arthur Porges]], future scientists destroy a three-billion dollar time-travel project because a religious fanatic had taken over the machine, heading for [[Golgotha]] with a rifle and five thousand rounds in an attempt to save Jesus and the affair must be kept from the public, since some might identify with "The Rescuer"
* ''[[Resurrection Day (Wyckoff novel)|Resurrection Day]]'' (1999) by [[Thomas Wyckoff]], is about a man sent back into time to steal Jesus' body to disprove Christianity
* In ''[[There Will Be Time]]'', by [[Poul Anderson]], a young twentieth-century American (who has discovered that he has the ability to travel through time without any need of a machine) reasons that there must be others like him and that Jerusalem at the time of the crucifixion is a good place to try locating them, goes there and walks through the street singing the Greek mass (which is meaningless to people of the time), but get himself located by agents of a time-travel policing organization, who take him to their headquarters in the far future—without getting to see Jesus at all
* In the ''[[TimeWars]]'' series by [[Simon Hawke]], set in 2461, Cardinal Lodovico Consorti proposes to use the recently discovered time-travel technology to obtain empirical proof that Christ indeed rose from the dead after being crucified, causing the Catholic Church to excommunicate him (the Church hierarchy preferring to continue relying on faith alone and not seeking factual confirmation)
* ''[[Times Without Number]]'', by [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]], depicts an alternate reality in which the [[Spanish Armada]] had conquered England; and when time travel is discovered—controlled by the Catholic Church—it is decreed that every new pope would be privileged to travel to Palestine in the time of Christ's ministry, while everyone else is strictly forbidden to go there
* In ''[[The Traveller (1954 novel)|The Traveller]]'', by [[Richard Matheson]], a confirmed skeptic is chosen to be the first to travel in time to see the crucifixion (in a kind of traveling cage which makes him invisible to the people of the past) and he witnesses the actual event, causing him to feel empathy for Jesus; and is hauled back to the present after attempting to save him; and, although he had seen no miracles, he is a changed man, having seen "a man giving up his life for the things he believed" and stating, "that should be miracle enough for everybody"
* The plot of ''[[Jesus Video]]'', a German novel by [[Andreas Eschbach]], revolves around the search for a hidden video camera that is believed to hold digital footage of Jesus recorded by a time traveler&lt;ref&gt;Note: The book, written in 1997, was adapted into a television movie called ''Das Jesus Video'' in 2002. The film was released in English under the title ''The Hunt for the Hidden Relic'' (or ''Hidden Relic'').&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Robert Silverberg]]'s ''[[Up the Line]]'', featuring a company organizing tours into the past, a character notes that "the crowd at the [[Sermon on the Mount]] grows bigger and bigger, every time I go there again"
* In one of the episodes of [[Philip José Farmer]]'s Riverworld series, Jesus was resurrected in a manner completely different from that depicted in Christian theology. Along with millions of other people from all times and places in history, he was given a new, completely human, life along the banks of a mysterious long river on another planet. In this depiction, the revived Jesus is a Jew who never intended to found a new religion, and when encountering Christians from later ages he does not recognize himself in the Divine Jesus which they believe in. He is delighted to encounter an Israelite woman who took part in the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] from Egypt and whose eye-witness account of [[Moses]] and [[Aaron|Aharon]] is substantially different from that in the Bible. Eventually Jesus is tortured to death by a rabidly antisemitic Medieval German Baron, who angrily rejects the very idea that this Jew might be Jesus. Before dying again, Jesus cries out: "Father, they ''do'' know what they are doing!". &lt;ref&gt;Published in "Down in the Black Gang" (1971) {{ISBN|0-451-04805-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Another Son of God==

* In the [[alternate history]] timeline of [[Harry Turtledove]]'s ''[[In High Places (Turtledove novel)|In High Places]]'', in which the [[Black Plague]] was much worse than in our history, there appeared in the city of [[Avignon]] at that time of crisis a charismatic religious leader named Henri, claiming to be "The Second Son of God". He was executed as a heretic. However, on the day after his execution, the church where the Pope and the King of France were worshiping collapsed, killing both of them. This was taken as an act of Divine Retribution and a proof of Henri's claim. Therefore, the worship of Henri as the Second Son of God was officially taken up by the Catholic Church. The life of Henri was described in "The Final Testament", added to the [[New Testament]] (with the name implying that the Church would not welcome any Third Son); churches were henceforward built with two towers, standing for Jesus and Henri; since Henri was [[broken on a wheel]], the Wheel became the symbol of Christianity instead of the Cross; and Avignon remained the permanent seat of the Papacy and became a holy city, with pilgrims flocking to the locations associated with Henri's life and martyrdom. In later times, Christians tended in times of crisis to call on Henri rather than on Jesus. This upheaval in Christian theology had the effect of deepening the hostility between Christianity and  [[Islam]]. The Muslims - grown very powerful due to the Black Plague devastating Europe - [[Jesus in Islam| respected Jesus as a Prophet]], but refused to accord any such status to Henri.
* [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]] story ''The Lingering Joy'', a sequel to [[Poul Anderson]]'s ''The Long Remembering'' &lt;ref&gt;Published in ''Multiverse: Exploring Poul Anderson's Worlds, ed. Greg bear and Gardner Dozois, [[Subterranean Press]], Boston, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;, depicts a world on the brink of destruction in [[nuclear war]]. A young woman, the story's protagonist, embarks on a kind of "mental time travel", enabling her to experience the life of a Prehistoric ancestress. Her main motivation is religious: to find out whether the [[Incarnation of Jesus]] was a single and unique event, or if God had before incarnated among the Neanderthals, to bring salvation to them, too. She experiences the life of a remote ancestress, a rebellious young Cro-Magnon woman who seeks to prove that she can be the equal of her tribe's male hunters. But while in courage and skill she is fully their equal, she cannot match the male hunters' ruthless cruelty. When visiting the last remaining enclave of the ''Goblins'' (Neanderthals), on the verge of final extinction, she cannot help feeling empathy and compassion for a male Goblin whose mate was raped and murdered by a male of her own tribe. And then she encounters the miraculous baby who was born to the doomed Goblins, his birth heralded by a strange new star which blazed in the sky, tens of thousands of years before the [[Star of Bethlehem]]...

==Theocracy==
{{See also|List of fictional theocracies}}

* ''[[Run, Come See Jerusalem!]]'' (1976) by [[Richard C. Meredith]] – An [[alternate history (fiction)|alternate]] United States defeats a [[Nazi Germany]] which came much closer to world domination than in our history, but in the aftermath falls under the power of a ruthless home-grown "Prophet".

But since, in practice, no one is infallible, it is frequently necessary to rearrange past events in order to show that this or that mistake was not made, or that this or that imaginary triumph actually happened. Then, again, every major change in policy demands a corresponding change of doctrine and a revaluation of prominent historical figures".&lt;ref&gt;[[George Orwell]], [http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Prevention_of_Literature/0.html "The Prevention of Literature"], ''Polemic'' (January 1946)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lawh-i-Anta'l-Kafi''''' or the '''''Long Healing Prayer''''' is a prayer written in Arabic by [[Bahá'u'lláh]], founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], in the [[Bahá'u'lláh#`Akká|'Akká period]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/rg/rg.leiden.html Writings of Bahá'u'lláh - Part Two: The Leiden List of Bahá'u'lláh's Tablets.]&lt;/ref&gt; The authorized English translation was done in 1980 by Habib Taherzadeh and a Committee at the [[Bahá'í World Centre]].

The main part of the prayer consists of numerous rhythmic invocations of [[God in the Bahá'í Faith|God]], each ending with the phrase ''"Thou the Sufficing, Thou the Healing, Thou the Abiding, O Thou Abiding One."''&lt;ref name="hatcher"&gt;{{cite book  |author = Hatcher, J.S. |year = 1997 |title = The Ocean of His Words: A Reader's Guide to the Art of Bahá'u'lláh |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0-87743-259-7 |pages = 145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prayer ends with a supplication for healing and protection, and includes the phrase ''"protect the bearer of this blessed Tablet, and whoso reciteth it, and whoso cometh upon it, and whoso passeth around the house wherein it is. Heal Thou, then, by it every sick, diseased and poor one"'', which gives this prayer its [[talisman]]ic nature.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter| authorlink= Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= talismans |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 333–334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In music==
Norwegian composer [[Lasse Thoresen]] composed a piece of choral music for the Bergen International Music Festival in May 1996, in which the ''Long Healing Prayer'' was sung, first in the original Arabic and then in English.&lt;ref&gt;Bahai.org. ''[http://info.bahai.org/article-1-6-2-8.html Profiles: Lasse Thoresen, Norway]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Bahá'í healing prayers==
Bahá'u'lláh wrote several other healing prayers, including a prayer for women, one for infants, and  a well-known short prayer starting with the phrase ''"Thy Name is my healing"'', which is part of Bahá'u'lláh's ''[[Lawh-i-Tibb]]'' (''Tablet to a Physician'').&lt;ref name="smith-tibb"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter| authorlink= Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Medicine, Tablet of |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MIVILUDES''' (an acronym for the [[French language|French-language]] phrase ''Mission interministérielle de vigilance et de lutte contre les dérives sectaires'', i.e. "Interministerial Mission for Monitoring and Combatting Cultic Deviances") is a [[France|French]] [[government agency]], with responsibility for monitoring groups perceived &lt;!-- perceived by whom exactly ? --&gt; to constitute a threat to public order or that violate French law, coordinating the government response, informing the public about potential risks, and assisting victims. The agency was created in 2002.

==Functions==
The mission of MIVILUDES involves analysing "the phenomenon of movements with a [[cult]]ic character whose actions affront the [[rights of man]] and  fundamental liberties, or which constitute a threat to public order or which are contrary to the laws and regulations".&lt;ref&gt;From the ''[[Journal Officiel de la République Française|Journal Officiel]]'' of 28 November 2002, quoted in [[:fr:Mission interministérielle de vigilance et de lutte contre les dérives sectaires|Mission interministérielle de vigilance et de lutte contre les dérives sectaires]] : ''Sa mission est définie officiellement (dans le Journal Officiel du 28 novembre 2002) comme étant d'analyser « le phénomène des mouvements à caractère sectaire dont les agissements sont attentatoires aux droits de l'homme et aux libertés fondamentales ou constituent une menace à l'ordre public ou sont contraires aux lois et règlements ».''&lt;/ref&gt;

MIVILUDES provides information related to "cultic deviances" to the media, the French government, and individual members of the public. It recommends contacts and other organizations, and produces and archives documentation and discussion papers on groups considered cults.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/spip.php?page=plan Mission Interministérielle de VIgilance et de LUtte contre les DÉrives Sectaires&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101013811/http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/spip.php?page=plan |date=2007-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
===Background===
The French authorities created MIVILUDES as the successor to MILS (''Mission interministérielle de lutte contre les sectes''; English: "Interministerial Mission in the Fight Against Cults"), which itself functioned from 7 October 1998 as the successor to the ''Observatoire interministériel sur les sectes'' established on 9 May 1996. These organisations were in charge of co-ordinating government monitoring of cults. 

In February 1998, MILS, headed by [[Alain Vivien]], released its annual report on their monitoring of cults in France. The operations of MILS, and Alain Vivien's background as the head of an [[Anti-Cult Movement|anti-cult organization]] (he had served as President of the [[Centre Roger Ikor]] from 1997 to 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.ccmm.asso.fr/index.php3 |title=Centre de documentation, d'éducation et d'action Contre les Manipulations Mentales |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127111947/http://www.ccmm.asso.fr/index.php3 |archivedate=2007-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), had occasionally received criticism from several human-rights organizations, such as the [[International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights]],&lt;ref&gt;

(See also [[About-Picard law#Reactions]]). In January 1999 Vivien requested and received police protection following threats and the burglary of his home.&lt;ref&gt;[[L'Humanité]], January 14, 1999; {{cite web|url=https://www.humanite.fr/journal/1999-01-14/1999-01-14-441385 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050430103350/http://www.humanite.fr/journal/1999-01-14/1999-01-14-441385 |archivedate=2005-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vivien resigned in June 2002 under criticism.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.cesnur.org/2002/fr_vivien.htm Alain Vivien Resigns from President of the French Anti-Cult Mission]&lt;/ref&gt;

===MIVILUDES===
MIVILUDES was created by a [[President of the French Republic|president]]ial decree on 28 November 2002. [[Jean-Louis Langlais]], a senior civil-servant at the [[Ministry of the Interior]], served as its president from 2002 to 2005.&lt;ref name="miviludes.gouv.fr"&gt;[http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/spip.php?article138&amp;iddiv=2 Mission Interministérielle de VIgilance et de LUtte contre les DÉrives Sectaires&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013110316/http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/spip.php?article138&amp;iddiv=2 |date=2007-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Announcing the formation of MIVILUDES, the French government acknowledged the criticism that MILS had received from outside France for certain activities that could be considered in violation of [[religious freedom]]. The decree establishing MIVILUDES&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/spip.php?rubrique162&amp;iddiv=1 Mission Interministérielle de VIgilance et de LUtte contre les DÉrives Sectaires&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026085807/http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/spip.php?rubrique162&amp;iddiv=1 |date=2007-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
referred to MILS only indirectly in announcing the abrogation (in Article 8) of the decree establishing MILS. 

In an interview in March 2003, Langlais categorised the fight as not against "sects", but against "sectarian deviances". He stated that current French law lacks a definition for a "sect" and, therefore "the law cannot define sectarian deviances". Nevertheless, he portrayed the role of MIVILUDES as contributing to "defining what could simply be an administrative jurisprudence".&lt;ref&gt;'France and "cults": a new orientation' - Interview with Jean-Louis Langlais, by Willy Fautré. ''Compass Direct'', 5 April 2003. [http://www.religioscope.info/article_138.shtml Available online; retrieved 2007-01-28 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 report by the [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]] concluded with an assessment that the restructuring of the main French agency concerned with this issue — referring to MILS being replaced by MIVILUDES — had improved religious freedoms in France.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.uscirf.gov/countries/publications/currentreport/2004annualRpt.pdf United States Commission on International Religious Freedom] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051008044821/http://www.uscirf.gov/countries/publications/currentreport/2004annualRpt.pdf |date=2005-10-08 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean-Michel Roulet became president of MIVILUDES in October 2005,&lt;ref name="miviludes.gouv.fr"/&gt; followed by [[Georges Fenech]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/-Historique-?iddiv=2 Historique] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507073958/http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/-Historique-?iddiv=2 |date=2011-05-07 }}//La MIVILUDES&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8606">'''Mesopotamian prayer''' are the [[prayer]]s of the place and era known as [[Mesopotamia#Religion and philosophy|ancient Mesopotamia]]. There are nine classifications of poem used within Mesopotamia.

==Prayers==
A definition of prayers of Mesopotamia is "''praise to god followed by request''" (this definition is according to ''T. Oshima'').&lt;ref name="Review (2012) by [[Journal of Hebrew Scriptures]] (designation DOI:10.5508/jhs.2012.v12.r17)  of"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.jhsonline.org/reviews/reviews_new/review590.htm|author=Review (2012) by [[Journal of Hebrew Scriptures]] (designation DOI:10.5508/jhs.2012.v12.r17)  of|title=Oshima, T (author) - ''Babylonian Prayers to Marduk''|publisher={{ISBN|978-3-16-150831-8}}|accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one source (Bromiley) the form of the word, known and used to signify  prayers during the  Mesopotamian era, is described today as šu-il-lá. With regards to šu-il-lá, the scholars ''Lambert'', ''van der Toorn'' and ''Oshima'' posit an alternative use for the term, which they submit is instead with reference to the way in which a prayer is to be recited, not a general signifier (rubric) for prayer itself (a notion expressed by ''Bromiley'').&lt;ref name="Review (2012) by [[Journal of Hebrew Scriptures]] (designation DOI:10.5508/jhs.2012.v12.r17)  of"/&gt;&lt;ref name="G.W.

Šu-il-lá  is held to refer to an act of praying, by prayer exhibited by either ''lifting of hands'', ''to lift hands'', or ''to lift the hand''.&lt;ref name="Frechett, C.G."&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.jhsonline.org/reviews/reviews_new/review684.htm|author=Frechett, C.G.|title=Mesopotamian Ritual-prayers of "Hand-lifting" (Akkadian šuillas): An Investigation of Function in Light of the Idiomatic Meaning of the Rubric|publisher=Ugarit Verlag, 2012 {{ISBN|978-3-86835-046-3}}|accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incantation===
Tribal specialists in ritual were required to perform incantations to accompany the  use of texts known, for example, from Ugarit which are attested to contain ways to aid in the removal of snake-venom. Ugarit is also known to have contained additional health-related incantation texts.&lt;ref&gt;S I Johnston - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uvtebmqZZDYC&amp;pg=PA460&amp;lpg=PA460&amp;dq=Incantation+prayers+of+Mesopotamia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SUkJ-Bh04K&amp;sig=g-qHVj5Mw19pV3CG3iuorTaMZNc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ywhaVbD3NqGV7Ab4woDwCA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Incantation%20prayers%20of%20Mesopotamia&amp;f=false Religions of the Ancient World: A Guide (p.459-460)] Harvard University Press, 2004 {{ISBN|0674015177}} (697 pages) ''Volume 18 of Harvard University Press reference library'' [Retrieved 2015-05-16]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gottesbriefe===
The term ''Gottesbriefe'' is literally, petition-prayers, or letter prayers.&lt;ref&gt;K Takai - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CO5jpwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Gottesbriefe+prayers+Babylonia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kRBaVYTZCKXN7QbRjIGwDA&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA Old Babylonian Letter of Petition and Later Individual Lament Prayers] BiblioBazaar, 2011 {{ISBN|1243614951}} [Retrieved 2015-05-18]&lt;/ref&gt; They were mostly in the form of pleas for relief from illness and for the deliverance of personal longevity.&lt;ref name="G.W. Bromiley"/&gt;

===Ikribus===
These prayers were performed for the purposes of divining.&lt;ref&gt;F.H. Cryer - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=91GUCL69DpMC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;lpg=PA197&amp;dq=Ikribus+prayers&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aLdwsBOCbz&amp;sig=LRAV5i1OcF4IvuSZZM0jRbeW1-c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SAtaVY-pOavV7QaLp4HgCg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Ikribus%20prayers&amp;f=false Divination in Ancient Israel and its Near Eastern Environment: A Socio-Historical Investigation (footnote 5 - page 197)] A&amp;C Black, 1 May 1994 {{ISBN|0567059634}} (367 pages) ''The Library of Hebrew Bible/Old Testament Studies'' [Retrieved 2015-05-18]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another source shows ''ikribū'' were  benedictions.&lt;ref name="G.W. Bromiley"/&gt;

===Royal===
The rulers' (Kings of Babylonia) prayers were made to a variety of [[deities]], for example [[Marduk]] (the god of Babylonia), [[Nabu|Nabû]], [[Shamash|Ŝamaš]]. The kings had inscribed prayers made onto cylinders made of clay and kept within buildings, in order to fulfill this function. Prayers of this type tended to not be for reason of the seeking of mercy and salvation as is found in ''Šuila'' prayers.&lt;ref&gt;T Oshima - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HQZM5Q3eKAQC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=Royal+prayers+Babylonia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tQxaVeDtOOyU7QbV2YPoDQ&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Royal%20prayers%20Babylonia&amp;f=false Babylonian Prayers to Marduk (p.21-22)] Mohr Siebeck, 2011 {{ISBN|3161508319}} (483 pages) ''Volume 7 of Orientalische Religionen in der Antike'', ISSN 1869-0513 [Retrieved 2015-05-18]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hymns===
By study of the prayers, it seems apparent to scholars, that these types of prayers seem to be reformations of earlier [[Literary topos|topos]] made, for example, in a similar vein to prayers such as the ''Prayer to the Gods of the Night''.&lt;ref name="G.W. Bromiley"/&gt;

===Šigû===
Šigû are lamentations. Lamentations are either [[wikt:complaint|complaints]], or expressions of [[grief]] or [[Sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]]. Both meanings are related (combined) within šigû.&lt;ref&gt;Google - [https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;rlz=1C1AVNA_enGB589GB590&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=lament search return] published by [[Google]] 22:40 hrs 12-12-2015  [Retrieved 2015-12-12]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Namburbi===
Prayers of this classification were performed during [[Namburbi|namburbi rituals]]. These rituals were undertaken firstly if an [[omen]] announced a [[fate]] that was [[evil]], and a person wished to counter-act the fate, and secondly to counter [[witchcraft]].&lt;ref name="Review (2012) by [[Journal of Hebrew Scriptures]] (designation DOI:10.5508/jhs.2012.v12.r17)  of"/&gt;&lt;ref name="C.O.

'''Natural religion''' most frequently means the "religion of nature", in which God, the soul, spirits, and all objects of the supernatural are considered as part of [[nature]] and not separate from it. Conversely, it is also used in [[philosophy]], specifically Roman Catholic philosophy, to describe some aspects of religion that are said to be knowable apart from divine revelation through logic and reason alone (see [[natural theology]] and [[Deism]]), for example, the existence of the [[God|unmoved Mover]], the [[first cause]] of the universe.

Most authors{{who|date=September 2018}} consider natural religion as not only the foundation of monotheistic religions such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam but also distinct from them. According to some authors{{who|date=September 2018}}, aspects of natural religion are found universally among all peoples, often in such forms of [[shamanism]] and [[animism]]. They are still practiced in many parts of the world. The religions of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] societies for example are considered as possessing some aspects of natural religion.

==Definition==

Natural religion might have the following meanings:

* In the modern [[Religious studies|study of religion]] it is used to refer to the notion that there is a spontaneous religious apprehension of the world common to all human beings, see:
**[[urreligion]]
**[[origin of religion]]
**[[anthropology of religion]]
* As a reverent form of [[nature worship]], embodied in a statement by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]: "I put a capital N on Nature, and call it my Church."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/multimedia/video/2008/wallace/wright_frank_lloyd_t.html |title=Frank Lloyd Wright |publisher=[[The Mike Wallace Interview]] |year=1957 |website=[[Harry Ransom Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Referring to the religions of people prior to their [[Christianization]].

==History==

The basic tenets of natural religion were outlined by [[Aristotle]], whose ''hylomorphism'' considered all things as made of matter and form. The form of all living things is the [[soul]], which guides and directs their development. Many natural religions{{which|date=September 2018}} consider God as the "soul of the universe".

Early [[monotheism]] had many naturalistic elements. Heaven and hell were considered physical places above and below the earth. "Salvation" was considered resurrection of the body.

In the fourth century, Christians were concerned that Jesus had not returned and wondered what happened to those who died before the Second Coming of Christ. Christians, led by [[Augustine of Hippo]] and under the influence of both [[gnosticism]] and [[neoplatonism]], developed a new belief in the soul as capable of a separate existence abstract from the material world. The human souls, unlike those of animals, would survive death and, depending on God's judgment, be transferred to the non-material realms of heaven or hell and the new realm of [[limbo]] for unbaptized persons and [[purgatory]] for those who do not deserve hell but are not purified for heaven..

Another distinction from monotheism is found in the Christian belief in miracles, in which God intervenes in history from outside nature. Ancient Roman philosophers and others since objected to this Christian doctrine as God violating his own natural laws. Christians had to separate God more completely from the natural universe in order to show how this could be possible. There were similar neoplatonist tendencies in Judaism and Islam, which also saw God as acting in history.

Natural religions, on the contrary, consider the supernatural as part of the natural universe.

==Modern views==
One of the first attempts to develop a science of religion was ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'' by the American philosopher [[William James]].  James saw the basic experience which unified all religions as a sometimes life-changing personal event in which one perceives the connectedness of all things as one unified whole.

James defined the basics of all religion, including natural religion, when he wrote: "Were one to characterize the life of religion in the broadest and most general terms possible, one might say that it exists of the belief that there is an unseen order, and that our supreme good lies in harmoniously adjusting ourselves hereto."

Certain aspects of natural religion (that is, religious truths that are knowable by human reason alone) are found among different cultures, though not always entirely intact, and to varying degrees, according to philosophers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]].

A few modern scientists such as UK biologist [[Rupert Sheldrake]] believe new discoveries coincide with Aristotle's belief in the soul. Forces such as [[magnetism]], [[gravity]], and [[quantum mechanics]] also point to non-material forces acting in nature.&lt;ref&gt;2012. Sheldrake, R. '''Set Science Free: 10 Paths to New Discoveries.''' Depak Chopra.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pralaya''' ([[Sanskrit]]), in [[Hindu cosmology]], is an aeonic{{what|date=November 2018}} term for ''dissolution'', which specifies different periods of time during which a non-activity situation persists, as per different formats or contexts. The word Mahapralaya stands for ''Great Dissolution''. During each pralaya, the lower ten realms ([[loka]]) are destroyed,&lt;ref name=shivp&gt;{{cite book |title=Shiv Purana|author=B. K. Chaturvedi|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books|year=2004|isbn=8171827217 |page=124 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bchgql0em9YC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=Swargaloka&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LuXJT7TDN4OyrAeBoajSDg&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Swargaloka&amp;f=false |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the higher four realms, including [[Satya-loka]], Tapa-loka, Jana-loka, and Mahar-loka are preserved.  During each Mahapralaya, all 14 realms are destroyed.

In the [[Samkhya]] philosophy, one of the six schools of classical [[Indian philosophy]], Pralaya means "non-existence", a state of matter achieved when the three gunas (principles of matter) are in perfect balance. The word pra-laya comes from Sanskrit meaning 'dissolution' or by extension 'reabsorption, destruction, annihilation or death'.

==Pralaya in popular culture==
The word pralaya appears in the Cyclops chapter of [[James Joyce]]'s epic novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.

"Pralaya" appears in the [[Shin Megami Tensei: Persona|Persona]] series of games (specifically ''[[Persona 3]]'' and ''[[Persona 4]]'') as an attack. While it can be inherited to other Personae, its original user is "Shiva", a Persona based on the [[Shiva|Hindu deity of the same name]].

Pralaya is also the name of an antagonist in the [[DC Comics]] series ''[[Justice League Dark]]'' who appears in the series' final arc, threatening to destroy the fictional multiverse.

Pralaya is an otter-like alien wizard who is sometimes [[Demonic_possession|overshadowed]] by the [[Young_Wizards#The_Lone_Power|Lone Power]] in Diane Duane's [[Young Wizards]] novel, ''[[The Wizard's Dilemma]]''.

The Swedish metal band, [[Dissection (band)|Dissection]], references "Mahapralaya" in their song, "Maha Kali".

==Concept and etymology==
{{See also|Religio}}
''Religion'' (from O.Fr. ''religion'' religious community, from L. ''religionem'' (nom. ''religio'') "respect for what is sacred, reverence for the gods, sense of right, moral obligation, sanctity",&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; "obligation, the bond between man and the gods"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;) is derived from the Latin ''[[Religio|religiō]]'', the ultimate origins of which are obscure. One possible interpretation traced to [[Cicero]], connects ''{{lang|la|lego}}'' read, i.e. ''re'' (again) with ''lego'' in the sense of choose, go over again or consider carefully.

In the ancient Greece, the Greek term ''threskeia'' was loosely translated into Latin as ''religio'' in late antiquity. The term was sparsely used in classical Greece but became more frequently used in the writings of Josephus in the first century CE. It was used in mundane contexts and could mean multiple things from respectful fear to excessive or harmfully distracting practices of others; to cultic practices. It was often contrasted with the Greek word ''deisidaimonia'' which meant too much fear.&lt;ref name="threskeia greece"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barton |first1=Carlin |last2=Boyarin |first2=Daniel |title=Imagine No Religion : How Modern Abstractions Hide Ancient Realities |date=2016 |publisher=Fordham University Press |isbn=9780823271207 |chapter=8.

The modern concept of religion, as an abstraction that entails distinct sets of beliefs or doctrines, is a recent invention in the English language since such usage began with texts from the 17th century due to the splitting of Christendom during the Protestant Reformation and globalization in the age of exploration which involved contact with numerous foreign cultures with non-European languages.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harrison |first1=Peter |title=The Territories of Science and Religion |date=2015 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0226184487}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Religion enlightenment"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=Peter|title='Religion' and the Religions in the English Enlightenment|date=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521892933}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts Jon" /&gt;

Jewish ideologies of Peace and Peacemaking|pages=86-87|quote=Yet despite its ingrained theological tradition, one must acknowledge that the Jewish people did not begin to think of Judaism as a religion until fairly recently. To be clear, the contemporary religious category popularly known as Judaism can be traced back to an ancient Jewish culture traditionally entailing certain fixed ideas about God. That culture also involved unique rites and behaviors related to the worship of God later to be construed as key elements of the Jewish faith. But these cultural effects did not constitute a religion in the formal sense of the word (Nongbri 2013, 46-50). They entailed no compulsory system of belief or regulatory ritual program by which to measure one's Jewish identity. To be a Jew was primarily a matter of national or ethnic identification, a function of being born into a family of Jewish descent or choosing to disavow one's own ancestral culture to become a Jew. By and large, it was not a matter of confession or creed (Satlow 2006, 1-19). It was not until the nineteenth century that Jewish thinkers began to conceive of their ancestral culture in systematized religious terms. Seeking entry into a European civil society dominated by Christian values, many Jews touched by the liberal values of the European Enlightenment undertook to interpret their Judaism in terms analogous to Christianity.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the 1st century CE, Josephus had used the Greek term ''ioudaismos'', which some translate as Judaism today, even though he used it as an ethnic term, not one linked to modern abstract concepts of religion as a set of beliefs.&lt;ref name=Nongbri /&gt; It was in the 19th century that Jews began to see their ancestral culture as a religion analogous to Christianity.&lt;ref name="Burns Jewish" /&gt; The Greek word ''threskeia'', which was used by Greek writers such as Herodotus and Josephus, is found in the New Testament. ''Threskeia'' is sometimes translated as religion in today's translations, however, the term was understood as worship well into the medieval period.&lt;ref name=Nongbri&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nongbri |first1=Brent |title=Before Religion: A History of a Modern Concept |date=2013 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0300154160}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Quran, the Arabic word ''[[Din (Arabic)|din]]'' is often translated as religion in modern translations, but up to the mid-1600s translators expressed ''din'' as law.&lt;ref name=Nongbri /&gt; 

The [[Sanskrit]] word [[dharma]], sometimes translated as religion, also means law. Throughout classical [[South Asia]], the [[Dharmaśāstra|study of law]] consisted of concepts such as [[Prāyaścitta|penance through piety]] and [[Ācāra|ceremonial as well as practical traditions]].

Though traditions, sacred texts, and practices have existed throughout time, most cultures did not align with western conceptions of religion since they did not separate everyday life from the sacred. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the terms Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, Confucianism, and [[world religions]] first entered the English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harrison |first1=Peter |title=The Territories of Science and Religion |date=2015|page=101 |quote=The first recorded use of "Boudhism" was 1801, followed by "Hindooism" (1829), "Taouism" (1838), and "Confucianism" (1862) (see figure 6).

This construction of "religions" was not merely the production of European translation terms, but the reification of systems of thought in a way strikingly divorced from their original cultural milieu. The original discovery of religions in different cultures was rooted in the assumption that each people had its own divine "revelation," or at least its own parallel to Christianity. In the same period, however, European and American explorers often suggested that specific African or Native American tribes lacked religion altogether.

(...) The name ''Hindu'' was first a geographical name, not a religious one, and it originated in the languages of Iran, not of India. (...)

According to the [[philologist]] [[Max Müller]] in the 19th century, the root of the English word religion, the [[Latin]] ''[[:wikt:religio|religio]]'', was originally used to mean only reverence for God or the gods, careful pondering of divine things, [[pietas|piety]] (which [[Cicero]] further derived to mean diligence).&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]], ''Natural Religion'', p. 33, 1889&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2340976 Lewis &amp; Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Müller]] characterized many other cultures around the world, including Egypt, Persia, and India, as having a similar power structure at this point in history.

It is also the product of the dominant Western religious mode, what is called the Judeo-Christian climate or, more accurately, the theistic inheritance from Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The theistic form of belief in this tradition, even when downgraded culturally, is formative of the dichotomous Western view of religion. That is, the basic structure of theism is essentially a distinction between a transcendent deity and all else, between the creator and his creation, between God and man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=King |first=W.L. |date=2005 |article=Religion (First Edition) |editor-link=Mircea Eliade |editor-first=Mircea |editor-last=Eliade |title=The Encyclopedia of Religion |publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|MacMillan Reference US]] |edition=2nd |p=7692}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The anthropologist [[Clifford Geertz]] defined religion as a
{{quote|[…] system of symbols which acts to establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic."{{sfn|Geertz|1993|pp=87–125}}}}

Alluding perhaps to Tylor's "deeper motive", Geertz remarked that
{{quote|[…] we have very little idea of how, in empirical terms, this particular miracle is accomplished. We just know that it is done, annually, weekly, daily, for some people almost hourly; and we have an enormous ethnographic literature to demonstrate it.{{sfn|Geertz|1993|p=90}}}}

The theologian [[Antoine Vergote]] took the term supernatural simply to mean whatever transcends the powers of nature or human agency. He also emphasized the cultural reality of religion, which he defined as
{{quote|[…] the entirety of the linguistic expressions, emotions and, actions and signs that refer to a supernatural being or supernatural beings.&lt;ref name="vergote"&gt;Vergote, A. (1996) ''Religion, Belief and Unbelief. A Psychological Study'', Leuven University Press. (p. 16)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Peter Mandaville]] and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] intended to get away from the modernist dualisms or dichotomous understandings of immanence/transcendence, spirituality/materialism, and sacredness/secularity. They define religion as
{{quote|[…] a relatively-bounded system of beliefs, symbols and practices that addresses the nature of existence, and in which communion with others and Otherness is ''lived'' as if it both takes in and spiritually transcends socially-grounded ontologies of time, space, embodiment and knowing.&lt;ref name="Paul James and Peter Mandaville 2010" /&gt;

According to the MacMillan Encyclopedia of Religions, there is an experiential aspect to religion which can be found in almost every culture:
{{quote|[…] almost every known culture [has] a depth dimension in cultural experiences […] toward some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life. When more or less distinct patterns of behavior are built around this depth dimension in a culture, this structure constitutes religion in its historically recognizable form. Religion is the organization of life around the depth dimensions of experience—varied in form, completeness, and clarity in accordance with the environing culture.&lt;ref&gt;MacMillan Encyclopedia of religions, ''Religion'', p. 7695&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Classical===
[[File:Будажап Цыреторов.JPG|thumb|Budazhap Shiretorov (Будажап Цыреторов), the head shaman of the religious community Altan Serge (Алтан Сэргэ) in [[Buryatia]].]]
[[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] in the late 18th century defined religion as ''das schlechthinnige Abhängigkeitsgefühl'', commonly translated as "the feeling of absolute dependence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0034412504007462|title='Feeling of absolute dependence' or 'absolute feeling of dependence'? A question revisited|journal=Religious Studies|volume=41|pages=81–94|year=2005|last1=Finlay|first1=Hueston E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His contemporary [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] disagreed thoroughly, defining religion as "the Divine Spirit becoming conscious of Himself through the finite spirit."&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]]. "Lectures on the origin and growth of religion."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Burnett Tylor]] defined religion in 1871 as "the belief in spiritual beings".&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;Tylor, E.B. (1871) ''[https://archive.org/stream/primitiveculture1tylouoft#page/424/mode/2up Primitive Culture: Researches Into the Development of Mythology, Philosophy, Religion, Art, and Custom. Vol. 1]''. London: John Murray; (p. 424).&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that narrowing the definition to mean the belief in a supreme deity or judgment after death or [[idolatry]] and so on, would exclude many peoples from the category of religious, and thus "has the fault of identifying religion rather with particular developments than with the deeper motive which underlies them". He also argued that the belief in spiritual beings exists in all known societies.

In his book ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'', the psychologist [[William James]] defined religion as "the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine".{{sfn|James|1902|p=31}} By the term divine James meant "any object that is god''like'', whether it be a concrete deity or not"{{sfn|James|1902|p=34}} to which the individual feels impelled to respond with solemnity and gravity.{{sfn|James|1902|p=38}}

The sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]], in his seminal book ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]'', defined religion as a "unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things".{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|p=}} By sacred things he meant things "set apart and forbidden—beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to them". Sacred things are not, however, limited to gods or spirits.&lt;ref group=note&gt;That is how, according to Durkheim, Buddhism is a religion. "In default of gods, Buddhism admits the existence of sacred things, namely, the [[Four Noble Truths|four noble truths]] and the practices derived from them"{{harvnb|Durkheim|1915|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, a sacred thing can be "a rock, a tree, a spring, a pebble, a piece of wood, a house, in a word, anything can be sacred".{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|p=37}} Religious beliefs, myths, dogmas and legends are the representations that express the nature of these sacred things, and the virtues and powers which are attributed to them.{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|pp=40–41}}

Echoes of James' and Durkheim's definitions are to be found in the writings of, for example, [[Frederick Ferré]] who defined religion as "one's way of valuing most comprehensively and intensively".&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Ferré, F. (1967) ''Basic modern philosophy of religion''. Scribner, (p. 82).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, for the theologian [[Paul Tillich]], faith is "the state of being ultimately concerned",&lt;ref name="Tillich, P. 1957 p.1"/&gt; which "is itself religion. Religion is the substance, the ground, and the depth of man's spiritual life."&lt;ref&gt;Tillich, P. (1959) ''Theology of Culture''. Oxford University Press; (p. 8).&lt;/ref&gt;

When religion is seen in terms of sacred, divine, intensive valuing, or ultimate concern, then it is possible to understand why scientific findings and philosophical criticisms (e.g., those made by [[Richard Dawkins]]) do not necessarily disturb its adherents.&lt;ref&gt;Pecorino, P.A. (2001) [http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/pecorip/scccweb/etexts/phil_of_religion_text/CHAPTER_10_DEFINITION/The-Definition-of-Religion.htm ''Philosophy of Religion.

==Aspects==

===Beliefs===
{{Main|Religious beliefs}}
Traditionally, [[faith]], in addition to reason, has been considered a source of religious beliefs. The interplay between faith and reason, and their use as perceived support for religious beliefs, have been a subject of interest to philosophers and theologians.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"/&gt;

====Mythology====
{{Main|Mythology}}
The word ''myth'' has several meanings.
# A traditional story of ostensibly historical events that serves to unfold part of the world view of a people or explain a practice, belief, or natural phenomenon;
# A person or thing having only an imaginary or unverifiable existence; or
# A metaphor for the spiritual potentiality in the human being.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Campbell, ''The Power of Myth'', p. 22 {{ISBN|0-385-24774-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient [[polytheism|polytheistic]] religions, such as those of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], and [[Scandinavia]], are usually categorized under the heading of [[mythology]]. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or [[culture]]s in development, are similarly called myths in the [[anthropology of religion]]. The term myth can be used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. By defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real or true than one's own religious stories and beliefs. [[Joseph Campbell]] remarked, "Mythology is often thought of as ''other people's'' religions, and religion can be defined as mis-interpreted mythology."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Campbell, ''Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor''. Ed. Eugene Kennedy. New World Library {{ISBN|1-57731-202-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In sociology, however, the term myth has a non-pejorative meaning. There, myth is defined as a story that is important for the group whether or not it is objectively or provably true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/myth|title=myth|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[resurrection]] of their real-life founder [[Jesus]], which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, is symbolic of the power of life over death, and is also said to be a historical event. But from a mythological outlook, whether or not the event actually occurred is unimportant. Instead, the [[symbol]]ism of the death of an old life and the start of a new life is what is most significant. Religious believers may or may not accept such symbolic interpretations.

====Worldview====
Religions have [[sacred history|sacred histories]], [[narrative]]s, and  [[mythology|mythologies]] which may be preserved in sacred [[Religious text|scriptures]], and [[Religious symbol|symbols]] and [[holy places]], that aim to explain the [[meaning of life]], the [[creation myth|origin of life]], or the [[religious cosmology|Universe]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Practices===
{{Main|Religious behaviour|Cult (religious practice)}}
The practices of a religion may include [[ritual]]s, [[sermon]]s, commemoration or veneration (of a [[deity]], [[God (male deity)|gods]], or [[goddess]]es), [[sacrifice]]s, [[festival]]s, [[Banquet|feasts]], [[trance]]s, [[initiation]]s, [[funeral|funerary services]], [[matrimony|matrimonial services]], [[meditation]], [[prayer]], [[religious music]], [[religious art]], [[sacred dance]], [[Community service|public service]], or other aspects of human culture.&lt;ref name="OD"&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/mythology Oxford Dictionaries] mythology, retrieved 9 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social organisation===
Religions have a societal basis, either as a living tradition which is carried by lay participants, or with an organized [[clergy]], and a definition of what constitutes adherence or membership.

==Academic study==
{{Main|Religious studies|Classifications of religious movements}}
A number of disciplines study the phenomenon of religion: [[theology]], [[comparative religion]], [[history of religion]], [[evolutionary origin of religions]], [[anthropology of religion]], [[psychology of religion]] (including [[neurotheology|neuroscience of religion]] and [[evolutionary psychology of religion]]), [[law and religion]], and [[sociology of religion]].

Daniel L. Pals mentions eight classical theories of religion, focusing on various aspects of religion: [[animism]] and [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], by [[Edward Burnett Tylor|E.B. Tylor]] and [[J.G. Frazer]]; the [[Psychoanalysis|psycho-analytic]] approach of [[Sigmund Freud]]; and further [[Emile Durkheim]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Max Weber]], [[Mircea Eliade]], [[E.E. Evans-Pritchard]], and [[Clifford Geertz]].{{sfn|Pals|2006}}

[[Michael Stausberg]] gives an overview of contemporary theories of religion, including [[Cognitive science of religion|cognitive]] and biological approaches.{{sfn|Stausberg|2009}}

===Theories===
{{Main|Theories of religion}}
[[Sociology of religion|Sociological]] and [[Anthropology of religion|anthropological]] theories of religion generally attempt to explain the [[origin of religion|origin]] and [[social function|function of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Segal|2005|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theories define what they present as universal characteristics of [[religious belief]] and [[Religious behaviour|practice]].

====Origins and development====
[[File:Yazilikaya B 12erGruppe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Yazılıkaya]] sanctuary in [[Turkey]], with the twelve gods of the underworld]]
The origin of religion is uncertain. There are a number of theories regarding the subsequent origins of religious practices.

According to [[anthropologists]] John Monaghan and Peter Just, "Many of the great world religions appear to have begun as revitalization movements of some sort, as the vision of a charismatic prophet fires the imaginations of people seeking a more comprehensive answer to their problems than they feel is provided by everyday beliefs. Charismatic individuals have emerged at many times and places in the world. It seems that the key to long-term success – and many movements come and go with little long-term effect – has relatively little to do with the prophets, who appear with surprising regularity, but more to do with the development of a group of supporters who are able to institutionalize the movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Social &amp; Cultural Anthropology |edition= |last1=Monaghan |first1=John |last2=Just |first2=Peter |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-285346-2 |page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[development of religion]] has taken different forms in different cultures. Some religions place an emphasis on belief, while others emphasize practice. Some religions focus on the subjective experience of the religious individual, while others consider the activities of the religious community to be most important. Some religions claim to be universal, believing their [[law]]s and [[cosmology]] to be binding for everyone, while others are intended to be practiced only by a closely defined or localized group. In many places religion has been associated with public institutions such as [[education]], [[hospital]]s, the [[family]], [[government]], and [[politics|political]] hierarchies.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |title=Social &amp; Cultural Anthropology |edition= |last1=Monaghan |first1=John |last2=Just |first2=Peter |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-285346-2 |page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists John Monoghan and Peter Just state that, "it seems apparent that one thing religion or belief helps us do is deal with problems of human life that are significant, persistent, and intolerable. One important way in which religious beliefs accomplish this is by providing a set of ideas about how and why the world is put together that allows people to accommodate anxieties and deal with misfortune."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

====Cultural system====
While religion is difficult to define, one standard model of religion, used in [[religious studies]] courses, was proposed by [[Clifford Geertz]], who simply called it a "cultural system".&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Geertz, ''Religion as a Cultural System'', 1973&lt;/ref&gt; A critique of Geertz's model by [[Talal Asad]] categorized religion as "an [[anthropology|anthropological]] category".&lt;ref&gt;Talal Asad, ''The Construction of Religion as an Anthropological Category'', 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Niebuhr's (1894–1962) five-fold classification of the relationship between Christ and culture, however, indicates that religion and culture can be seen as two separate systems, though not without some interplay.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Niebuhr, ''Christ and Culture'' (San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1951) as cited by Domenic Marbaniang, "The Gospel and Culture: Areas of Conflict, Consent, and Conversion", ''Journal of Contemporary Christian'' Vol. 6, No. 1 (Bangalore: CFCC, Aug 2014), {{ISSN|2231-5233}} pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social constructionism====
{{Main|Theories about religions#Social constructionism|l1=Social constructionism}}
One modern academic theory of religion, [[social constructionism]], says that religion is a modern concept that suggests all [[spirituality|spiritual]] practice and [[worship]] follows a model similar to the [[Abrahamic religions]] as an orientation system that helps to interpret reality and define human beings.&lt;ref name="vergote 89"&gt;Vergote, Antoine, ''Religion, belief and unbelief: a psychological study'', Leuven University Press, 1997, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the main proponents of this theory of religion are Daniel Dubuisson, Timothy Fitzgerald,  Talal Asad, and Jason Ānanda Josephson. The social constructionists argue that religion is a modern concept that developed from Christianity and was then applied inappropriately to non-Western cultures.

====Cognitive science====
{{Main|Cognitive science of religion}}

Cognitive science of religion is the study of religious thought and behavior from the perspective of the cognitive and evolutionary sciences. The field employs methods and theories from a very broad range of disciplines, including: [[cognitive psychology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[cognitive anthropology]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[neurobiology]], [[zoology]], and [[ethology]].  Scholars in this field seek to explain how human minds acquire, generate, and transmit religious thoughts, practices, and schemas by means of ordinary cognitive capacities.

Hallucinations and delusions related to religious content occurs in about 60% of people with [[schizophrenia]]. While this number varies across cultures, this had led to theories about a number of influential religious phenomenon and possible relation to psychotic disorders. A number of prophetic experiences are consistent with psychotic symptoms, although retrospective diagnoses are practically impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nicholson|first1=PT|title=Psychosis and paroxysmal visions in the lives of the founders of world religions.|journal=The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|volume=26|issue=1|date=2014|pages=E13–14|doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.12120412|pmid=24515692}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murray|first1=ED|last2=Cunningham|first2=MG|last3=Price|first3=BH|title=The role of psychotic disorders in religious history considered.|journal=The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|volume=24|issue=4|date=2012|pages=410–426|doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11090214|pmid=23224447}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weber|first1=SR|last2=Pargament|first2=KI|title=The role of religion and spirituality in mental health.|journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry|date=September 2014|volume=27|issue=5|pages=358–363|doi=10.1097/YCO.0000000000000080|pmid=25046080}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schizophrenic episodes are also experienced by people who do not have belief in gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reina|first1=Aaron|title=Faith Within Atheism|journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin|date=July 2014|volume=40|issue=4|pages=719–720|doi=10.1093/schbul/sbt076|pmid=23760918|pmc=4059423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious content is also common in [[temporal lobe epilepsy]], and [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Favazza|first1=A|editor1-last=Sadock|editor1-first=B|editor2-last=Sadock|editor2-first=V|editor3-last=Ruiz|editor3-first=P|title=Kaplan and Sadocks Comprehensive Texbook of Psychiatry|publisher=Wolters Kluwer|edition=10th|chapter=Psychiatry and Spirituality}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Altschuler|first1=EL|title=Temporal lobe epilepsy in the preistly source of the Pentateuch|journal=South African Medical Journal|date=2004|volume=11|issue=94|page=870}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atheistic content is also found to be common with temporal lobe epilepsy.&lt;ref name="Heilman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heilman|first1=Kenneth M.|last2=Valenstein|first2=Edward |title=Clinical Neuropsychology|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English|isbn=9780195384871|page=488|quote=Studies that claim to show no difference in emotional makeup between temporal lobe and other epileptic patients (Guerrant et. al., 1962; Stevens, 1966) have been reinterpreted (Blumer, 1975) to indicate that there is, in fact, a difference: those with temporal lobe epilepsy are more likely to have more serious forms of emotional disturbance. This typical personality of temporal lobe epileptic patient has been described in roughly similar terms over many years (Blumer &amp; Benson, 1975; Geschwind, 1975, 1977; Blumer, 1999; Devinsky &amp; Schachter, 2009). These patients are said to have a deepening of emotions; they ascribe great significance to commonplace events. This can be manifested as a tendency to take a cosmic view; hyperreligiosity (or intensely professed atheism) is said to be common.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparativism===
{{Main|Comparative religion}}
Comparative religion is the branch of the [[study of religions]] concerned with the systematic comparison of the doctrines and practices of the world's religions. In general the comparative study of religion yields a deeper understanding of the fundamental philosophical concerns of religion such as [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]], and the nature and form of [[salvation]]. Studying such material is meant to give one a richer and more sophisticated understanding of human beliefs and practices regarding the [[sacred]], [[numinous]], [[spirituality|spiritual]] and [[Divinity|divine]].&lt;ref&gt;"Human beings' relation to that which they regard as holy, sacred, spiritual, and divine" [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] (online, 2006), cited after {{cite web |url=http://www.religionfacts.com/religion/quotes.htm |title=Definitions of Religion |website=Religion facts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of comparative religion, a common geographical classification&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt; of the [[Major religious groups|main world religions]] includes [[Middle Eastern religions]] (including [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Iranian religions]]), [[Indian religions]], [[East Asian religions]], African religions, American religions, Oceanic religions, and classical Hellenistic religions.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/497215/classification-of-religions/38029/Normative Charles Joseph Adams, ''Classification of religions: geographical'', Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
{{Main||History of religions}}
[[File:Prevailing world religions map.png|thumb|upright=2.05|A map of [[List of religious populations|major denominations and religions of the world]]]]
In the 19th and 20th centuries, the academic practice of [[comparative religion]] divided religious belief into philosophically defined categories called world religions. Some academics [[Study of religion|studying the subject]] have divided religions into three broad categories:
# [[world religions]], a term which refers to [[Transculturation|transcultural]], [[international]] religions
# [[indigenous religions]], which refers to smaller, culture-specific or nation-specific religious groups; and
# [[new religious movements]], which refers to recently developed religions.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Graham (2000). ''Indigenous Religions: A Companion''. (Ed: Graham Harvey). London and New York: Cassell. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some recent scholarship has argued that not all types of religion are necessarily separated by mutually exclusive philosophies, and furthermore that the utility of ascribing a practice to a certain philosophy, or even calling a given practice religious, rather than cultural, political, or social in nature, is limited.&lt;ref name="pennington"&gt;Brian Kemble Pennington ''Was Hinduism Invented?'' New York: Oxford University Press US, 2005. {{ISBN|0-19-516655-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell T. McCutcheon. ''Critics Not Caretakers: Redescribing the Public Study of Religion''. Albany: SUNY Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Lash. ''The beginning and the end of 'religion'.'' Cambridge University Press, 1996. {{ISBN|0-521-56635-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current state of psychological study about the nature of religiousness suggests that it is better to refer to religion as a largely invariant phenomenon that should be distinguished from cultural norms (i.e. religions).&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Bulbulia. "Are There Any Religions? An Evolutionary Explanation." ''Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion'' 17.2 (2005), pp. 71–100&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morphological classification===
Some scholars classify religions as either ''[[Universalizing religion|universal religions]]'' that seek worldwide acceptance and actively look for new converts, or ''[[ethnic religion]]s'' that are identified with a particular ethnic group and do not seek converts.&lt;ref name="Hinnells"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Routledge companion to the study of religion |last=Hinnells |first=John R. |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-33311-5 |pages=439–440 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=IGspjXKxIf8C |accessdate=17 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others reject the distinction, pointing out that all religious practices, whatever their philosophical origin, are ethnic because they come from a particular culture.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Fitzgerald. ''The Ideology of Religious Studies''. New York: Oxford University Press US, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig R. Prentiss. ''Religion and the Creation of Race and Ethnicity''.

===Demographical classification===
{{Main|Major religious groups|List of religious populations}}
The five largest religious groups by world population, estimated to account for 5.8 billion people and 84% of the population, are Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism (with the relative numbers for Buddhism and Hinduism dependent on the extent of [[syncretism]]) and traditional folk religion.

{{Mainarticle|List of religions and spiritual traditions}}

===Abrahamic===
[[File:Molnár Ábrahám kiköltözése 1850.jpg|upright|thumb|The patriarch [[Abraham]] (by [[József Molnár (painter)|József Molnár]])]]
[[Abrahamic religions]] are [[monotheistic]] religions which believe they descend from [[Abraham]].

====Judaism====
[[File:Open Torah and pointer.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Torah]] is the primary sacred text of Judaism.]]
[[Judaism]] is the oldest Abrahamic religion, originating in the people of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|ancient Israel and Judea]]. The [[Torah]] is its foundational text, and is part of the larger text known as the [[Tanakh]] or [[Hebrew Bible]]. It is supplemented by oral tradition, set down in written form in later texts such as the [[Midrash]] and the [[Talmud]]. Judaism includes a wide corpus of texts, practices, theological positions, and forms of organization. Within Judaism there are a variety of movements, most of which emerged from [[Rabbinic Judaism]], which holds that God revealed his laws and [[613 Mitzvot|commandments]] to [[Moses]] on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] in the form of both the [[Torah|Written]] and [[Oral Torah]]; historically, this assertion was challenged by various groups. The [[Jewish people]] were scattered after the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] in 70 CE. Today there are about 13 million Jews, about 40 per cent living in Israel and 40 per cent in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/shnaton61/st02_27.pdf |title=Info |website=www.cbs.gov.il |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest [[Jewish religious movements]] are [[Orthodox Judaism]] ([[Haredi Judaism]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]]), [[Conservative Judaism]] and [[Reform Judaism]].

====Christianity====
[[File:StJohnsAshfield StainedGlass GoodShepherd Portrait cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jesus]] is the central figure of Christianity.]]
[[Christianity]] is based on the life and teachings of [[Jesus of Nazareth]] (1st century) as presented in the [[New Testament]]. The Christian faith is essentially faith in Jesus as the [[Christ]], the [[Son of God]], and as [[Messiah|Savior]] and Lord. Almost all Christians believe in the [[Trinity]], which teaches the unity of [[God the Father|Father]], [[God the Son|Son]] (Jesus Christ), and [[Holy Spirit]] as three persons in [[monotheism|one Godhead]]. Most Christians can describe their faith with the [[Nicene Creed]]. As the religion of [[Byzantine Empire]] in the first millennium and of [[Western Europe]] during the time of colonization, Christianity has been propagated throughout the world. The main divisions of Christianity are, according to the number of adherents:
* The [[Catholic Church]], led by the [[Bishop of Rome]] and the bishops worldwide in communion with him, is a [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] of 24 Churches ''[[sui iuris]]'', including the [[Latin Church]] and 23 [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic churches]], such as the [[Maronite]] Catholic Church.
* [[Eastern Christianity]], which include [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], and the [[Church of the East]].
* [[Protestantism]], separated from the Catholic Church in the 16th-century [[Protestant Reformation]] and is split into thousands of [[Religious denomination|denominations]].  Major branches of Protestantism include [[Anglicanism]], [[Baptists]], [[Calvinism]], [[Lutheranism]], and [[Methodism]], though each of these contain many different denominations or groups.

There are also smaller groups, including:
* [[Restorationism]], the belief that Christianity should be restored (as opposed to reformed) along the lines of what is known about the [[Apostolic Age|apostolic early church]].
* [[Latter Day Saint movement]], founded by [[Joseph Smith]] in the late 1820s.
* [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], founded in the late 1870s by [[Charles Taze Russell]].

====Islam====
[[File:Kaaba mirror edit jj.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Muslim]]s [[Tawaf|circumambulating]] the [[Kaaba]], the most sacred site in [[Islam]]]]
[[Islam]] is based on the [[Quran]], one of the [[Islamic holy books|holy books]] considered by Muslims to be [[Wahy|revealed]] by [[God in Islam|God]], and on the [[Hadith|teachings (hadith)]] of the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]], a major political and religious figure of the 7th century CE. Islam is based on the unity of all religious philosophies and accepts all of the [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] prophets of Judaism, Christianity and other Abrahamic religions before [[Muhammad]]. It is the most widely practiced religion of [[Southeast Asia]], [[North Africa]], [[Western Asia]], and [[Central Asia]], while Muslim-majority countries also exist in parts of [[South Asia]], [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], and [[Southeast Europe]]. There are also several [[Islamic republic]]s, including [[Iran]], [[Pakistan]], [[Mauritania]], and [[Afghanistan]].
* [[Sunni Islam]] is the largest denomination within Islam and follows the Quran, the hadiths which record the [[sunnah]], whilst placing emphasis on the [[sahabah]].
* [[Shia Islam]] is the second largest denomination of Islam and its adherents believe that [[Ali]] succeeded Muhammad and further places emphasis on Muhammad's family.
* [[Ahmadiyya]] adherents believe that the awaited Imam [[Mahdi]] and the Promised Messiah has arrived, believed to be [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] by Ahmadis.
* There are also Muslim revivalist movements such as [[Muwahhidism]] and [[Salafism]].

Other denominations of Islam include [[Nation of Islam]], [[Ibadi]], [[Sufism]], [[Quranism]], [[Mahdavia]], and [[non-denominational Muslims]]. [[Wahhabism]] is the dominant Muslim [[Maddhab|schools of thought]] in the [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]].

====Other====
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] is an Abrahamic religion founded in 19th-century Iran and since then has spread worldwide. It teaches unity of all religious philosophies and accepts all of the prophets of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as well as additional prophets including its founder [[Bahá'u'lláh]]. One of its divisions is the [[Orthodox Bahá'í Faith]].

Smaller regional Abrahamic groups also exist, including [[Samaritanism]] (primarily in Israel and the West Bank), the [[Rastafari movement]] (primarily in Jamaica), and [[Druze]] (primarily in Syria and Lebanon).

===East Asian===
{{Main|East Asian religions}}
East Asian religions (also known as Far Eastern religions or Taoic religions) consist of several religions of East Asia which make use of the concept of Tao (in Chinese) or Dō (in Japanese or Korean). They include:

====Taoism and Confucianism====
* [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]], as well as Korean, Vietnamese, and Japanese religion influenced by Chinese thought.

====Chinese folk religion====
* [[Chinese folk religion]]: the indigenous religions of the [[Han Chinese]], or, by [[metonymy]], of all the populations of the [[Chinese cultural sphere]]. It includes the syncretism of [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Buddhism]], [[Wuism]], as well as many new religious movements such as [[Chen Tao (True Way Cult)|Chen Tao]], [[Falun Gong]] and [[Yiguandao]].
* Other folk and new religions of [[East Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]] such as [[Korean shamanism]], [[Chondogyo]], and [[Jeung San Do]] in Korea; [[Shinto]], [[Shugendo]], [[Ryukyuan religion]], and [[Japanese new religions]] in Japan; [[Satsana Phi]] in Laos; [[Cao Đài]], [[Hòa Hảo]], and [[Vietnamese folk religion]] in Vietnam.

[[File:Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita Dharmacakra Discourse.jpeg|thumb|upright|The [[Buddha]], in a [[Sanskrit]] manuscript, [[Nalanda|Nālandā]], Bihar, India]]
[[Indian religions]] are practiced or were founded in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. They are sometimes classified as the ''dharmic religions'', as they all feature [[dharma]], the specific law of reality and duties expected according to the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mittal |first=Sushil |title=Surprising Bedfellows: Hindus and Muslims in Medieval and Early Modern India |year=2003 |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=9780739106730 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hinduism====
* [[Hinduism]] is preferentially self-designated by the term ''Vaidika Dharma''.&lt;ref name="Klostermaier2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Klaus K. Klostermaier|title=Survey of Hinduism, A: Third Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8CVviRghVtIC|date=2010|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8011-3| page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[synecdoche]] describing the similar philosophies of [[Vaishnavism]], [[Shaivism]], and [[Hindu denominations|related groups]] practiced or founded in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Concepts most of them share in common include [[karma]], [[caste]], [[reincarnation]], [[mantra]]s, [[yantra]]s, and [[darśana]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;Hinduism is variously defined as a religion, set of religious beliefs and practices, religious tradition etc. For a discussion on the topic, see: "Establishing the boundaries" in Gavin Flood (2003), pp. 1–17. [[René Guénon]] in his'' [[Introduction to the Study of the Hindu doctrines]]'' (1921 ed.), Sophia Perennis, {{ISBN|0-900588-74-8}}, proposes a definition of the term religion and a discussion of its relevance (or lack of) to Hindu doctrines (part II, chapter 4, p. 58).&lt;/ref&gt; Hinduism is one of the most ancient of still-active religions,&lt;ref&gt;p. 434 ''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions'' By Wendy Doniger, M. Webster, Merriam-Webster, Inc&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 219 ''Faith, Religion &amp; Theology'' By Brennan Hill, Paul F. Knitter, William Madges&lt;/ref&gt; with origins perhaps as far back as prehistoric times.&lt;ref&gt;p. 6 ''The World's Great Religions'' By Yoshiaki Gurney Omura, Selwyn Gurney Champion, Dorothy Short&lt;/ref&gt; Hinduism is not a monolithic religion but a religious category containing dozens of separate philosophies amalgamated as [[Sanātana Dharma]], which is the name by which Hinduism has been known throughout history by its followers.

====Jainism====
* [[Jainism]], taught primarily by [[Rishabhanatha]] (the founder of [[ahimsa]]) is an ancient Indian religion that prescribes a path of [[non-violence]], [[truth]] and [[anekantavada]] for all forms of living beings in this universe; which helps them to eliminate all the [[Karma in Jainism|Karmas]], and hence to attain freedom from the cycle of birth and death ([[Saṃsāra (Jainism)|saṃsāra]]), that is, achieving ([[Moksha (Jainism)|nirvana]]). Jains are found mostly in India. According to Dundas, outside of the Jain tradition, historians date the [[Mahavira]] as about contemporaneous with the [[Buddha]] in the 5th-century BCE, and accordingly the historical [[Parshvanatha]], based on the c. 250-year gap, is placed in 8th or 7th century BCE.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=30–31}}
** [[Digambara]] Jainism (or sky-clad) is mainly practiced in South India. Their holy books are [[Pravachanasara]] and [[Samayasara]] written by their Prophets  [[Kundakunda]] and [[Amritchandra]] as their [[Jain Agamas (Digambara)|original cannon]] is lost.
** [[Shwetambara]] Jainism (or white-clad) is mainly practiced in Western India. Their holy books are [[Jain Agamas]], written by their Prophet [[Sthulibhadra]].

====Buddhism====
* [[Buddhism]] was founded by [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha Gautama]] in the 6th century BCE. Buddhists generally agree that Gotama aimed to help [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]] end their [[dukkha|suffering (dukkha)]] by understanding the [[dharma|true nature of phenomena]], thereby escaping the cycle of suffering and rebirth ([[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|saṃsāra]]), that is, achieving [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvana]].
** [[Theravada]] Buddhism, which is practiced mainly in [[Sri Lanka]] and Southeast Asia alongside folk religion, shares some characteristics of Indian religions. It is based in a large collection of texts called the [[Pali Canon]].
** [[Mahayana]] Buddhism (or the Great Vehicle) under which are a multitude of doctrines that became prominent [[Buddhism in China|in China]] and are still relevant [[Buddhism in Vietnam|in Vietnam]], [[Buddhism in Korea|Korea]], [[Buddhism in Japan|Japan]] and to a lesser extent [[Buddhism in the West|in Europe and the United States]]. Mahayana Buddhism includes such disparate teachings as [[Zen]], [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]], and [[Soka Gakkai]].
** [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism first appeared in India in the 3rd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul; Tribe, Anthony (2000), Buddhist Thought: A complete introduction to the Indian tradition, Routledge, {{ISBN|0-203-18593-5}} p=194&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently most prominent in the Himalaya regions&lt;ref&gt;Smith, E. Gene (2001). Among Tibetan Texts: History and Literature of the Himalayan Plateau. Boston: Wisdom Publications. {{ISBN|0-86171-179-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and extends across all of Asia&lt;ref&gt;''Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary'', {{ISBN|4-7674-2015-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; (cf. [[Mikkyō]]).
** Two notable new Buddhist sects are [[Hòa Hảo]] and the [[Navayana]] ([[Dalit Buddhist movement]]), which were developed separately in the 20th century.

The principal beliefs of Sikhi are faith in ''[[Waheguru]]''—represented by the phrase ''[[ik Onkar|ik ōaṅkār]]'', meaning one God, who prevails in everything, along with a [[praxis (process)|praxis]] in which the Sikh is enjoined to engage in social reform through the pursuit of justice for all human beings.

===Law===
{{main|Law and religion}}
The study of law and religion is a relatively new field, with several thousand scholars involved in law schools, and academic departments including political science, religion, and history since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Witte |first1=John |year=2012 |title=The Study of Law and Religion in the United States: An Interim Report |url= |journal=Ecclesiastical Law Journal |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=327–354 |doi=10.1017/s0956618x12000348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars in the field are not only focused on strictly legal issues about religious freedom or non-establishment, but also study religions as they are qualified through judicial discourses or legal understanding of religious phenomena. Exponents look at canon law, natural law, and state law, often in a comparative perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Doe, ''Law and Religion in Europe: A Comparative Introduction'' (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.

===Science===
{{Main|Faith and rationality|Relationship between religion and science|Epistemology}}
[[Science]] acknowledges [[reason]], [[empiricism]], and [[evidence]]; and religions include [[revelation]], [[faith]] and [[sacredness]] whilst also acknowledging [[Philosophy of religion|philosophical]] and [[metaphysical]] explanations with regard to the study of the universe. Both science and religion are not monolithic, timeless, or static because both are complex social and cultural endeavors that have changed through time across languages and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stenmark |first1=Mikael |title=How to Relate Science and Religion: A Multidimensional Model |date=2004 |publisher=W.B.

In general the [[scientific method]] gains knowledge by testing hypotheses to develop [[theories]] through elucidation of facts or evaluation by [[experiment]]s and thus only answers [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] questions about the [[universe]] that can be observed and measured. It develops [[theory|theories]] of the world which best fit physically observed evidence. All scientific knowledge is subject to later refinement, or even rejection, in the face of additional evidence. Scientific theories that have an overwhelming preponderance of favorable evidence are often treated as ''[[de facto]]'' verities in general parlance, such as the theories of [[general relativity]] and [[natural selection]] to explain respectively the mechanisms of [[gravity]] and [[evolution]].

Religion does not have a method per se partly because religions emerge through time from diverse cultures and it is an attempt to find meaning in the world, and to explain humanity's place in it and relationship to it and to any posited entities. In terms of Christian theology and ultimate truths, people rely on reason, experience, scripture, and tradition to test and gauge what they experience and what they should believe. Furthermore, religious models, understanding, and metaphors are also revisable, as are scientific models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tolman |first1=Cynthia |title=Methods in Religion |url=http://akbar.marlboro.edu/~mahoney/vhs/SciRelCourse/Religion_methods.html |website=Malboro College |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904013431/http://akbar.marlboro.edu/~mahoney/vhs/SciRelCourse/Religion_methods.html |archivedate=4 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding religion and science, [[Albert Einstein]] states (1940): "For science can only ascertain what is, but not what should be, and outside of its domain value judgments of all kinds remain necessary. Religion, on the other hand, deals only with evaluations of human thought and action; it cannot justifiably speak of facts and relationships between facts…Now, even though the realms of religion and science in themselves are clearly marked off from each other, nevertheless there exist between the two strong reciprocal relationships and dependencies. Though religion may be that which determine the goals, it has, nevertheless, learned from science, in the broadest sense, what means will contribute to the attainment of the goals it has set up." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Personal God Concept Causes Science-Religion Conflict |journal=The Science News-Letter |date=21 September 1940 |first=Albert |last=Einstein |volume=38 |issue=12 |pages=181–182 |jstor=3916567 |doi=10.2307/3916567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Morality ===
{{Main|Morality and religion}}
Many religions have value frameworks regarding personal behavior meant to guide adherents in determining between right and wrong. These include the [[Jainism#Core beliefs|Triple Jems of Jainism]], [[Judaism|Judaism's]] [[Halacha]], [[Islam|Islam's]] [[Sharia]], [[Catholicism|Catholicism's]] [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]], [[Buddhism|Buddhism's]] [[Eightfold Path]], and [[Theological Aspects of the Avesta|Zoroastrianism's]] good thoughts, good words, and good deeds concept, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Good Without God: What a Billion Nonreligious People Do Believe|last=Esptein|first=Greg M.|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2010|isbn=978-0-06-167011-4|edition=|location=New York|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religion and morality are not synonymous. While it is "an almost automatic assumption."&lt;ref name="The Elements of Moral Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Elements of Moral Philosophy|last2=Rachels|first2=(ed) Stuart|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2011|isbn=978-0-078-03824-2|edition=7|location=New York|page=|last1=Rachels|first1=(ed) James}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Christianity, morality can have a [[Secular morality|secular basis]].

The study of religion and morality can be contentious due to ethnocentric views on morality, failure to distinguish between in group and out group altruism, and inconsistent definitions of religiosity.

=== Politics ===
====Impact====
Religion has had a significant impact on the political system in many countries. Notably, most Muslim-majority countries adopt various aspects of [[sharia]], the Islamic law. Some countries even define themselves in religious terms, such as [[Iran|The Islamic Republic of Iran]]. The sharia thus affects up to 23% of the global population, or 1.57&amp;nbsp;billion people who are [[Muslim world|Muslims]]. However, religion also affects political decisions in many western countries. For instance, in the [[United States]], 51% of voters would be less likely to vote for a presidential candidate who did not believe in God, and only 6% more likely.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2016/02/economist-explains-18?cid1=cust/noenew/n/n/n/20160229n/owned/n/n/nwl/n/n/NA/email The Economist explains: The role of religion in America’s presidential race], ''The Economist'', 25 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Christians make up 92% of members of the US Congress, compared with 71% of the general public (as of 2014). At the same time, while 23% of U.S. adults are religiously unaffiliated, only one member of Congress ([[Kyrsten Sinema]], D-Arizona), or 0.2% of that body, claims no religious affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/08/27/10-facts-about-religion-in-america/|title=10 facts about religion in America|last=Lipka|first=Michael|date=27 Aug 2015|website=|publisher=Pew Research Center|access-date=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most European countries, however, religion has a much smaller influence on politics&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/erasmus/2014/04/europe-religion-and-politics Europe, religion and politics:Old world wars], The Economist, 22 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; although it used to be much more important. For instance, [[same-sex marriage]] and [[abortion]] were illegal in many European countries until recently, following Christian (usually [[Catholicism|Catholic]]) doctrine. Several [[List of atheists in politics and law|European leaders are atheists]] (e.g. [[France]]’s former president [[François Hollande|Francois Hollande]] or Greece's prime minister [[Alexis Tsipras]]). In Asia, the role of religion differs widely between countries. For instance, [[India]] is still one of the most religious countries and religion still has a strong impact on politics, given that Hindu nationalists have been targeting minorities like the Muslims and the Christians, who historically belonged to the lower castes.&lt;ref&gt;Lobo, L. 2000 [http://americamagazine.org/issue/276/article/religion-and-politics-india Religion and Politics in India], ''America Magazine'', 19 February 2000&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, countries such as [[Religion in China|China]] or [[Religion in Japan|Japan]] are largely secular and thus religion has a much smaller impact on politics.

====Secularism====
[[File:Ranjitsingh.gif|thumb|upright|[[Ranjit Singh]] established [[Ranjit Singh#Secular Sikh rule|secular rule]] over [[Punjab region|Punjab]] in the early 19th century.]]

{{Main|Secularism| Secularization}}
Secularization is the transformation of the politics of a society from close identification with a particular religion's values and institutions toward nonreligious values and [[secular]] institutions. The purpose of this is frequently modernization or protection of the populations religious diversity.

===Economics===
[[File:Religion economy.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Average income correlates negatively with (self-defined) religiosity.&lt;ref name="gia" /&gt;]]
{{Main|Economics of religion}}
{{Further|Religion and business|Wealth and religion}}
One study has found there is a negative correlation between self-defined religiosity and the wealth of nations.&lt;ref name=WIN-Gallup&gt;{{cite web |last=WIN-Gallup |title=Global Index of religion and atheism. |url=http://www.wingia.com/web/files/news/14/file/14.pdf |accessdate=12 July 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021065544/http://www.wingia.com/web/files/news/14/file/14.pdf |archivedate=21 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the richer a nation is, the less likely its inhabitants to call themselves religious, whatever this word means to them (Many people identify themselves as part of a religion (not irreligion) but do not self-identify as religious).&lt;ref name="WIN-Gallup" /&gt;

Sociologist and political economist [[Max Weber]] has argued that Protestant Christian countries are wealthier because of their [[Protestant work ethic]].&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber, [1904] 1920. ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study from 2015, [[Christians]] hold the largest amount of wealth (55% of the total world wealth), followed by [[Muslims]] (5.8%), [[Hindus]] (3.3%) and [[Jewish]] (1.1%). According to the same study it was found that adherents under the classification [[Irreligion]] or other religions hold about 34.8% of the total global wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/453467/christians-hold-largest-percentage-global.html6 |title=Christians hold largest percentage of global wealth: Report|publisher=deccanherald.com|date=2015-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
{{Main|Impacts of religion on health}}
[[Mayo Clinic]] researchers examined the association between religious involvement and spirituality, and physical health, mental health, health-related quality of life, and other health outcomes. The authors reported that: "Most studies have shown that religious involvement and spirituality are associated with better health outcomes, including greater longevity, coping skills, and health-related quality of life (even during terminal illness) and less anxiety, depression, and suicide."&lt;ref name="Religion and Medicine"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Paul S. |last1=Mueller, MD |first2=David J. |last2=Plevak, MD |first3=Teresa A. |last3=Rummans, MD |title=Religious Involvement, Spirituality, and Medicine: Implications for Clinical Practice |url=http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/0025-6196/PIIS0025619611627997.pdf |quote=We reviewed published studies, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and subject reviews that examined the association between religious involvement and spirituality and physical health, mental health, health-related quality of life, and other health outcomes.

Most studies have shown that religious involvement and spirituality are associated with better health outcomes, including greater longevity, coping skills, and health-related quality of life (even during terminal illness) and less anxiety, depression, and suicide |accessdate=13 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of a subsequent study concluded that the influence of religion on health is largely beneficial, based on a review of related literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Hill |first2=Peter C. |title=The Role of Religion and Spirituality in Mental and Physical Health |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |date=February 2001 |first=Kevin S. |last=Seybold |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=21–24 |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00106}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to academic James W. Jones, several studies have discovered "positive correlations between religious belief and practice and mental and physical health and longevity." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Religion, Health, and the Psychology of Religion: How the Research on Religion and Health Helps Us Understand Religion |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |year=2004 |first=James W. |last=Jones |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=317–328 |doi=10.1007/s10943-004-4299-3|url=http://dergipark.gov.tr/bilimname/issue/3501/47580 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of data from the 1998 US General Social Survey, whilst broadly confirming that religious activity was associated with better health and well-being, also suggested that the role of different dimensions of spirituality/religiosity in health is rather more complicated. The results suggested "that it may not be appropriate to generalize findings about the relationship between spirituality/religiosity and health from one form of spirituality/religiosity to another, across denominations, or to assume effects are uniform for men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2005.11.008|pmid=16359765|title=Gender differences in religious practices, spiritual experiences and health: Results from the US General Social Survey|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=62|issue=11|pages=2848–2860|year=2006|last1=Maselko|first1=Joanna|last2=Kubzansky|first2=Laura D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violence===
{{main|Religious violence}}
{{See also|Islam and violence|Christianity and violence|Judaism and violence}}
[[File:UA Flight 175 hits WTC south tower 9-11 edit.jpeg|thumb|[[United Airlines Flight 175]] hits the South Tower during the [[September 11 attacks]] of 2001 in [[New York City]]. The September 11 attacks (also referred to as 9/11) were a series of four coordinated [[Terrorism|terrorist attacks]] by the [[Islamic terrorism|Islamic terrorist]] group [[al-Qaeda]] on the [[United States]] on the morning of Tuesday, September 11, 2001.]]

Critics like [[Hector Avalos]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fighting Words: The Origins of Religious Violence |first=Hector |last=Avalos |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Amherst, New York |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Regina Schwartz]],&lt;ref name=ReginaSchwartz&gt;{{cite book |title=The Curse of Cain: The Violent Legacy of Monotheism By Regina M. Schwartz |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Hitchens]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] have argued that religions are inherently violent and harmful to society by using violence to promote their goals, in ways that are endorsed and exploited by their leaders.&lt;ref name="Hitchens 2007"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |title=God is not Great |publisher=Twelve |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;ref name="Dawkins 2006"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |title=The God Delusion |publisher=Bantam Books |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

Anthropologist Jack David Eller asserts that religion is not inherently violent, arguing "religion and violence are clearly compatible, but they are not identical." He asserts that "violence is neither essential to nor exclusive to religion" and that "virtually every form of religious violence has its nonreligious corollary."&lt;ref name="CruelCreeds1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Eller |first=Jack David |title=Cruel Creeds, Virtuous Violence: Religious Violence Across Culture and History |year=2010 |publisher=Prometheus Books |isbn=978-1-61614-218-6 |quote=As we have insisted previously, religion is not inherently and irredeemably violent; it certainly is not the essence and source of all violence.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CruelCreeds2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Eller |first=Jack David |title=Cruel Creeds, Virtuous Violence: Religious Violence Across Culture and History |year=2010 |publisher=Prometheus Books |isbn=978-1-61614-218-6 |quote=Religion and violence are clearly compatible, but they are not identical. Violence is one phenomenon in human (and natural existence), religion is another, and it is inevitable that the two would become intertwined. Religion is complex and modular, and violence is one of the modules—not universal, but recurring. As a conceptual and behavioral module, violence is by no means exclusive to religion. There are plenty of other groups, institutions, interests, and ideologies to promote violence. Violence is, therefore, neither essential to nor exclusive to religion. Nor is religious violence all alike... And virtually every form of religious violence has its nonreligious corollary.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Animal sacrifice ====
Done by some (but not all) religions, [[animal sacrifice]] is the [[ritual]] killing and offering of an animal to appease or maintain favour with a [[deity]]. It has been banned in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/02/india-court-bans-animal-sacrifice-hindu-temples |title=Indian court bans animal sacrifice |last=France-Presse |first=Agence|newspaper=The Guardian |date=2014-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Superstition ===
{{Further|Superstition|Magical thinking|Magic and religion}}
Greek and Roman pagans, who saw their relations with the gods in political and social terms, scorned the man who constantly trembled with fear at the thought of the gods (''deisidaimonia''), as a slave might fear a cruel and capricious master. The Romans called such fear of the gods ''superstitio''.&lt;ref&gt;Veyne 1987, p. 211 {{Citation not found}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Ancient Greek]] historian [[Polybius]] described superstition in [[Ancient Rome]] as an ''[[instrumentum regni]]'', an instrument of maintaining the cohesion of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, [[The Histories (Polybius)|The Histories]], VI 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Superstition has been described as the non rational establishment of cause and effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~kfoster/FosterKokko2008%20Proc%20B%20superstition.pdf Kevin R. Foster and Hanna Kokko, "The evolution of superstitious and superstition-like behaviour", ''Proc. R. Soc. B'' (2009) 276, 31–37] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728042608/http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~kfoster/FosterKokko2008%20Proc%20B%20superstition.pdf |date=28 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Religion is more complex and is often composed of social institutions and has a moral aspect. Some religions may include superstitions or make use of magical thinking. Adherents of one religion sometimes think of other religions as superstition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Religion Explained |last=Boyer | first = Pascal |year=2001 |chapter=Why Belief |authorlink=Pascal Boyer |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=wreF80OHTicC&amp;pg=PA297&amp;lpg=PA297&amp;dq=%22fang+too+were+quite+amazed%22|title-link=Religion Explained }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nailed : ten Christian myths that show Jesus never existed at all|last=David|first=Fitzgerald|isbn=9780557709915|location=[Place of publication not identified]|oclc=701249439|date = October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some [[atheists]], [[deists]], and [[skeptics]] regard religious belief as superstition.

The Roman Catholic Church considers superstition to be sinful in the sense that it denotes a lack of trust in the divine providence of God and, as such, is a violation of the first of the Ten Commandments. The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] states that superstition "in some sense represents a perverse excess of religion" (para. #2110).  "Superstition," it says, "is a deviation of religious feeling and of the practices this feeling imposes. It can even affect the worship we offer the true God, e.g., when one attributes an importance in some way magical to certain practices otherwise lawful or necessary. To attribute the efficacy of prayers or of sacramental signs to their mere external performance, apart from the interior dispositions that they demand is to fall into superstition. Cf. Matthew 23:16–22" (para. #2111)

===Agnosticism and atheism===
{{Main|Atheism|Agnosticism|Irreligion|Antireligion|Humanism}}
{{See also|Criticism of atheism}}
The terms [[atheist]] (lack of belief in any gods) and agnostic (belief in the unknowability of the existence of gods), though specifically contrary to theistic (e.g. Christian, Jewish, and Muslim) religious teachings, do not by definition mean the opposite of religious. There are religions (including Buddhism, Taoism, and Hinduism), in fact, that classify some of their followers as agnostic, atheistic, or [[nontheism|nontheistic]]. The true opposite of religious is the word irreligious. [[Irreligion]] describes an absence of any religion; [[antireligion]] describes an active opposition or aversion toward religions in general.

===Interfaith cooperation===
{{Main|Interfaith dialogue}}
Because religion continues to be recognized in Western thought as a universal impulse{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}, many religious practitioners{{who|date=July 2016}} have aimed to band together in [[interfaith]] dialogue, cooperation, and [[Religion and peacebuilding|religious peacebuilding]]. The first major dialogue was the [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World's Fair]], which affirmed universal values and recognition of the diversity of practices among different cultures. The 20th century has been especially fruitful in use of interfaith dialogue as a means of solving ethnic, political, or even religious conflict, with [[Christian–Jewish reconciliation]] representing a complete reverse in the attitudes of many Christian communities towards Jews.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Recent interfaith initiatives include A Common Word, launched in 2007 and focused on bringing Muslim and Christian leaders together,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acommonword.com/|title=A Common Word Between Us and You|work=acommonword.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "C1 World Dialogue",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c1worlddialogue.com/|title=konsoleH :: Login|work=c1worlddialogue.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128195027/http://www.c1worlddialogue.com/|archivedate=28 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Common Ground initiative between Islam and Buddhism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islambuddhism.com/|title=Islam and Buddhism|work=islambuddhism.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[United Nations]] sponsored "World Interfaith Harmony Week".&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldinterfaithharmonyweek.com/ World Interfaith Harmony Week]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldinterfaithharmonyweek.com/world-interfaith-harmony-week-resolution/|title=» World Interfaith Harmony Week UNGA Resolution A/65/PV.34|work=worldinterfaithharmonyweek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture===
Culture and religion have usually been seen as closely related. [[Paul Tillich]] looked at religion as the soul of culture and culture as the form or framework of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Edward L. Queen, ''
Encyclopedia of American Religious History, Volume 1'' Facts on File, 1996. p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt; In his own words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Religion as ultimate concern is the meaning-giving substance of culture, and culture is the totality of forms in which the basic concern of religion expresses itself. In abbreviation: religion is the substance of culture, culture is the form of religion. Such a consideration definitely prevents the establishment of a dualism of religion and culture. Every religious act, not only in organized religion, but also in the most intimate movement of the soul, is culturally formed.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Tillich, ''Theology of Culture'', Robert C. Kimball (ed), (Oxford University Press, 1959). p.42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Ernst Troeltsch]], similarly, looked at culture as the soil of religion and thought that, therefore, transplanting a religion from its original culture to a foreign culture would actually kill it in the same manner that transplanting a plant from its natural soil to an alien soil would kill it. &lt;ref&gt;Eric J. Sharpe, "Religion and Cultures", An inaugural lecture delivered on 6 July, 1977 by Eric J. Sharpe, Professor of Religious Studies in the University of Sydney. Accessed at [https://openjournals.library.sydney.edu.au/index.php/ART/article/download/5496/6167 Openjournals] on June 22, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been many attempts in the modern pluralistic situation to distinguish culture from religion.&lt;ref&gt;See Taslima Nasreen, [https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/i-say-three-cheers-for-ayaan/232289 "I Say, Three Cheers For Ayaan",] ''Outlook, The Magazine'' 28 August 2006. Also, Nemani Delaibatiki, [http://fijisun.com.fj/2017/07/08/religion-and-the-vanua/ "Religion and the Vanua"] ''Fiji Sun'' July 08, 2017 in which the distinctive elements of culture against religion are taken from Domenic Marbaniang, [https://philpapers.org/bbs/thread.pl?tId=959 "Difference Between Culture and Religion: A Proposal Requesting Response"], 12 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Domenic Marbaniang has argued that elements grounded on beliefs of a metaphysical nature (religious) are distinct from elements grounded on nature and the natural (cultural). For instance, language (with its grammar) is a cultural element while sacralization of language in which a particular religious scripture is written is more often a religious practice. The same applies to music and the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Domenic Marbaniang, "The Gospel and Culture: Areas of Conflict, Consent, and Conversion", ''Journal of Contemporary Christian'' Vol. 6, No. 1 (Bangalore: CFCC, Aug 2014), {{ISSN|2231-5233}} pp. 7–17&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Religion Explained: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought''''' is a 2001 book by [[Cognitive anthropology|cognitive anthropologist]] [[Pascal Boyer]], in which the author discusses the [[evolutionary psychology of religion]] and [[evolutionary origin of religions]].

==Synopsis==
Boyer describes the genesis of religious concepts as a phenomenon of the mind's [[cognitive]] [[inference]] systems, comparable to [[pareidolia]] and [[perceptions of religious imagery in natural phenomena]] resulting from [[face perception]] processes within the [[human brain]]. Boyer supports this naturalistic origin of religion with evidence from many specialized disciplines including [[biological anthropology]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[cognitive science]], [[linguistics]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[neuroscience]], and [[information processing]].

''Religion Explained'' frames religious practices and beliefs in terms of recent [[cognitive neuroscience]] research in the [[modularity of mind]]. This theory involves cognitive "modules" ("devices" or "subroutines") underlying inference systems and intuitions. For instance, Boyer suggests culturally-widespread beliefs in "supernatural agents" (e.g., gods, ancestors, spirits, and witches) result from [[agent detection]]: the intuitive modular process of assuming intervention by conscious agents, regardless of whether they are present. "When we see branches moving in a tree or when we hear an unexpected sound behind us, we immediately infer that some agent is the cause of this salient event. We can do that without any specific description of what the agent actually is."&lt;ref&gt;Boyer 2001:144,&lt;/ref&gt; Boyer cites [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]]'s classic [[Zande people|Zande]] story about a termite-infested roof collapsing.
&lt;blockquote&gt;For the anthropologist, the house caved in because of the termites. For the Zande, it was quite clear that witchcraft was involved. However, the Zande were also aware that the termites were the proximate cause of the incident. But what they wanted to know was why it happened at that particular time, when particular people were gathered in the house.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, 2001:196, cf. 2001:12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Within Boyer's hypothesis, religion is a "parasite" (or "[[spandrel (biology)|spandrel]]") offshoot from cognitive modules, comparable to the way the [[Reading (process)|reading]] process is parasitic upon [[language module]]s.
&lt;blockquote&gt;As I have pointed out repeatedly the building of religious concepts requires mental systems and capacities that are there anyway, religious concepts or not. Religious morality uses moral intuitions, religious notions of supernatural agents recruit our intuitions about agency in general, and so on. This is why I said that religious concepts are parasitic upon other mental capacities. Our capacities to play music, paint pictures or even make sense of printed ink-patterns on a page are also parasitic in this sense. This means that we can explain how people play music, paint pictures and learn to read by examining how mental capacities are recruited by these activities. The same goes for religion. Because the concepts require all sorts of specific human capacities (an intuitive psychology, a tendency to attend to some counterintuitive concepts, as well as various social mind adaptations), we can explain religion by describing how these various capacities get recruited, how they contribute to the features of religion that we find in so many different cultures. We do not need to assume that there is a special way of functioning that occurs only when processing religious thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, 2001:311.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Boyer admits his explanation of religion 
&lt;blockquote&gt;is ''not'' a quick, shoot-from-the-hip solution of the kind that many people, either religious or not, seem to favor. There cannot be a magic bullet to explain the existence and common features of religion, as the phenomenon is the result of ''aggregate relevance'' – that is, of successful activation of a whole variety of mental systems.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer 2001:298, italics in original.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reviews and criticisms==
{{summarize section|date=January 2011}}
Critical reception of ''Religion Explained'' has been mixed.

[[Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi]], a professor of developmental psychology at the [[University of Haifa]], called the book "a milestone on the road to a new behavioral understanding of religion, basing itself on what has come to be known as cognitive anthropology, and pointedly ignoring much work done over the past one hundred years in the behavioral study of religion and in the psychological anthropology of religion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.human-nature.com/nibbs/02/boyer.html Book Review: Religion Explained] ''Human Nature Review'' 2002 Volume 2: 308–309 (22 July)&lt;/ref&gt; 
He continues: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The clearest virtue of this book is that of dealing with the real thing. Even today, most scholarly work on religion consists of apologetics in one form or another, and we are deluged by offers of grants to study "spirituality" or teach "religion and science". This all serves to make us forget that religion is a collection of fantasies about spirits, and Boyer indeed aims to teach us about the world of the spirits in the grand tradition of the Enlightenment. Any general introduction to the world of the spirits must be ambitious because it hasn't been done and also because it has been done intuitively by all of us.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[David Klinghoffer]], a journalist and [[intelligent design]] proponent, wrote in the ''[[National Review]]'' that "Boyer's talk of 'religion is suspiciously generic" and describes his work as "professorial noodlings" that attempt to raise the question whether "all religions are somehow the same". He further claims that "debunkers like Boyer ... have their own unconscious motivations (to undermine religious faith, after all, is to set oneself free of its many inconvenient strictures)."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080421220616/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_19_53/ai_78692094/pg_2 Faith no more—Religion Explained: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought—Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Shermer]], founder of [[The Skeptics Society]], described Boyer's book as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;a penetratingly insightful scientific analysis of religion because as an anthropologist he understands that any explanation must take into account the rich diversity of religious practices and beliefs around the world, and as a scientist he knows that any explanatory model must account for this diversity. Boyer is at his ethnographic best in describing the countless peculiar religious rituals he and his anthropological brethren have recorded, and especially in identifying the shortcomings of virtually every explanation for religion ever offered. … As a consequence, however, Boyer himself fails to provide a satisfactory explanation because he knows that religion is not a single entity resulting from a single cause.&lt;ref&gt;Shermer, Michael. 2001. ''How We Believe: Science, Skepticism, and the Search for God'', 2nd ed., Macmillan, p 256.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Brigitte Schön, a theology professor at the [[University of Bonn]], wrote,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Apart from being fascinating to read and containing many more highly original ideas than could be mentioned here, ''Religion explained'' is an important book for a number of reasons. First of all, Boyer is able to present a very dense network of theories which not only explains many religious phenomena but also sets them in relation to each other. The integration of cognitive science research leads to a very realistic model of how religious concepts are processed and communicated, something which has been conspicuously absent from most theories of religion so far. Boyer's account of the natural basis of religion explains very well the persistence and re-emergence of religion even in a secularized environment, as well as the tensions between official and folk religion.&lt;ref&gt;Brigitte Schön. [http://www.uni-marburg.de/fb03/ivk/mjr/pdfs/2002/reviews/rev_schoen_2002.pdf "''Religion Explained: The evolutionary origins of religious thought''"], ''Marburg Journal of Religion'' 2002 7.1:1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Garry Runciman, 3rd Viscount Runciman of Doxford|Garry Runciman]], sociologist at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], asked "Are we hardwired for God?"
&lt;blockquote&gt;The diverse beliefs which Boyer cites extend from Apollo and Athena, to shamanism among the Panamanian Cuna, to aliens from remote galaxies allegedly landing in New Mexico. But his central agenda is the particular set of unobservable causal agencies cited in his subtitle, and his primary concern is with the question of how we are to account for beliefs that involve the attribution of conscious agency to beings other than humans and animals of the normal and familiar kind. Such beliefs are, as Boyer says, remarkably widespread, and for all their variant forms the variation is neither limitless nor random. His answer falls into two parts: first, these beliefs have in common a counterintuitive attribution of a certain range of properties to certain kinds of quasihuman being; second, the explanation of their diffusion and persistence is to be sought not in the extensive anthropological literature about the origins and functions of religion, but in recent advances in developmental, cognitive and evolutionary psychology.&lt;ref&gt;W.G. Runciman. [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/feb/07/londonreviewofbooks/print Are we hardwired for God?], ''London Review of Books'', July 2, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Author and economist [[Zachary Karabell]] found stylistic faults. "Boyer's use of cognitive psychology, anthropology and other disciplines does generate a new template for examining old questions. But his method, however compelling, does not save the book from its considerable flaws. To begin with, the writing is frequently impenetrable." He concludes, "Of course, Boyer may be right. Human existence may simply be a story of living, breathing, eating and dying. But by not grappling with the possibility that a nonmaterial realm exists, Boyer has written a book about religion that is occasionally illuminating and utterly unconvincing."&lt;ref&gt;Zachary Karabell. [http://www.rivertwice.com/articles/pdfs/A_True_Believer_%20in_Science_Offers_a_Lopsided_Look_LAT.pdf A True Believer in Science Offers a Lopsided Look at Faith; ''RELIGION EXPLAINED: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought'', By Pascal Boyer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715191026/http://www.rivertwice.com/articles/pdfs/A_True_Believer_%20in_Science_Offers_a_Lopsided_Look_LAT.pdf |date=2011-07-15 }}, ''Los Angeles Times'' June 16, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[comparative religion]] author [[Karen Armstrong]] reviewed Boyer's thesis.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Religion, he argues, is nothing more or less than a by-product of the human mind. It is a side effect of having a particular kind of brain. By far the most fascinating part of this highly accessible and informative book is Boyer's description of the way our minds work. We have an inbuilt set of ontological expectations and a tendency to dwell on intuitions which violate these, such as mountains that float or companions whom we do not see. From the dawn of modern consciousness, men and women have focused on certain imaginary personalities that transcend the norm, convinced that they can help them in strategic ways. These supernatural agents link with other mental systems, such as our moral intuitions and social categories, for which we can find no conceptual justification.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Armstrong, [http://www.asa3.org/archive/asa/200109/0070.html ''Religion Explained'' by Pascal Boyer], ''The Times'', August 29, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[John Habgood, Baron Habgood|John Habgood]], formerly [[Archbishop of York]], wrote.
&lt;blockquote&gt;This is a bold and far-reaching book. What its author lacks in modesty, he makes up for in cogency of argument and elegance of style. His "explanation" of religion is lucid, entertaining, full of valuable insights and almost, but not quite, convincing. The usual explanations of religion—as an attempt to explain what is otherwise puzzling, as a provider of comfort, as a good thing for society or as an escape from reason—are quickly dismissed. Pascal Boyer seeks to demonstrate that its origins and motivations are more deep seated in our mental structures than any of these, which is why religion is so universal, so powerful and so unlikely to disappear even though, as he also claims, it is in the end only a mental phenomenon. Recent experience of the dreadful consequences of religious fanaticism gives his analysis a frightening contemporary relevance, not least because of the minor role within religion that he assigns to rationality.&lt;ref&gt;John Habgood, [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=166258&amp;sectioncode=40 "Parasite of airy nothings?"], ''Times Higher Education'', 14 December 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[sociology of religion]], '''religious capital''' is the investment an individual makes into their [[Faith|religious faith]]. The investment is the time and physical work involved with the religious faith, as well as the personal investment in ideology, doctrine, and practice.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, R. (2007). The Victory of Reason: how Christianity led to freedom, capitalism, and Western success. Random House.[https://books.google.com/books?id=EPkWXgokYLgC&amp;pg=PR56&amp;dq=%22religious+capital%22+stark&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=p3w1UdL5NsbJyAGnooHQAg&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22religious%20capital%22%20stark&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rodney Stark]] has defined it as "(the) degree of mastery of and attachment to a particular religious culture", and has used this theory to explain conversion experiences in a number of his books, notably ''The Victory of Reason: How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism, and Western Success '' and ''The Rise of Christianity: How the Obscure, Marginal Jesus Movement Became the Dominant Religious Force''.&lt;ref&gt;Park, J. Z., &amp; Baker, J. (2007). What would Jesus buy: American consumption of religious and spiritual material goods. Journal for the scientific study of religion, 46(4), 501-517.[https://www.academia.edu/366064/What_Would_Jesus_Buy_American_Consumption_of_Religious_and_Spiritual_Material_Goods]&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the realm of conversion, religious capital theory predicts that individuals will attempt to conserve their religious capital.  Large doctrinal or behavioral changes lose more religious capital than small ones, thus an [[Anglicanism|Episcopalian]] is more likely to become [[Catholic]] than [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] or [[Lutheran]].&lt;ref&gt;Lechner, F.

[[Jesus in Christianity|Christianity teaches]] that Jesus is the [[Messiah]] (Christ) foretold in the [[Old Testament]] and the [[Son of God]] [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnate]]. Christians believe that through [[Resurrection of Jesus|his death and resurrection]], humans can be reconciled to God and thereby are offered salvation and the promise of [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]].&lt;ref name="Bible' p.649"&gt;''Oxford Companion to the Bible'' p.649&lt;/ref&gt; These teachings emphasize that as the willing [[Lamb of God]], Jesus ''chose to'' suffer in [[Calvary]] as a sign of his full obedience to the will of his Father, as an "agent and servant of God".&lt;ref name=anselm &gt;''The Christology of Anselm of Canterbury'' by Dániel Deme 2004 {{ISBN|0-7546-3779-4}} pages 199-200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cullmann &gt;''The Christology of the New Testament'' by Oscar Cullmann 1959 {{ISBN|0-664-24351-7}} page 79&lt;/ref&gt; Christians view Jesus as a role model, whose God-focused life believers are encouraged to imitate.

In [[Islam]], Jesus (commonly transliterated as ''[[Islamic view of Jesus|Isa]]'') is one of God's highest-ranked and most-beloved [[prophets of Islam|prophets]]. Islam considers Jesus to be neither the incarnation nor the Son of God. Islamic texts emphasize a strict notion of monotheism (''[[tawhid]]'') and forbid the association of partners with God, which would be idolatry (''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]'').

The [[Bahá'í Faith]] considers Jesus to be a [[manifestation of God]], who are a series of personages who reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world. Bahá'ís reject the idea that divinity was contained with a single human body.

Apart from his own [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciple]]s and followers, the [[Jews]] of Jesus' day generally rejected him as the Messiah, as do the great majority of Jews today. Mainstream [[Judaism|Jewish]] scholars argue that Jesus neither fulfilled the Messianic prophecies in the [[Tanakh]] nor embodied the personal qualifications of the Messiah.
[[Sikhism]] views Jesus as a high-ranked Holy man or saint. 

Other world religions such as [[Buddhism]] have no particular view on Jesus, and have but a minor intersection with Christianity. For non-religious perspectives on Jesus, see [[historical Jesus]].

==Christianity==
{{main article|Jesus in Christianity}}
{{See also|Ministry of Jesus|Parables of Jesus|Miracles of Jesus|Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament}}
[[Jesus in Christianity|Christian views of Jesus]] are based on the teachings and beliefs as outlined in the [[Canonical gospels]], [[New Testament|New Testament letters]], the [[List of Christian creeds|Christian creeds]], as well as specific denominational teachings. These documents outline the key beliefs held by Christians about Jesus, including his divinity, humanity, and earthly life, and that he is the Christ and the Son of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schreiner|first=Thomas R.|title=New Testament Theology: Magnifying God in Christ|year=2008|publisher=Baker Academic|isbn=978-0-8010-2680-5|pages=23–37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=elw8xkVeTTUC&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Christian views of Jesus vary, it is possible to summarize the key beliefs shared among major denominations, as stated in their [[catechism|catechetical]] or [[Confessionalism (religion)|confessional]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first= Gregory L. |title= Catholic, Lutheran, Protestant: a doctrinal comparison|year= 1993 |isbn= 978-0-615-16635-3| pages= 11–17 |publisher=Christian News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, adhering to the Christian faith requires a belief that Jesus is the [[Son of God]] and the ''[[Messiah]]'' or ''[[Christ]]''. Jesus refers to himself as the Son of God in the New Testament.&lt;ref name=OneTeacher &gt;''One teacher: Jesus' teaching role in Matthew's gospel'' by John Yueh-Han Yieh 2004 {{ISBN|3-11-018151-7}} pages 240-241&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians consider Jesus to be the Messiah ([[Christ]]) and believe that through [[Resurrection of Jesus|his death and resurrection]], humans can be reconciled to God and thereby are offered salvation and the promise of [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]].&lt;ref name="Bible' p.649"/&gt; These teachings emphasize that as the willing [[Lamb of God]], Jesus ''chose to'' suffer in [[Calvary]] as a sign of his full obedience to the will of his Father, as an "agent and servant of God".&lt;ref name="anselm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cullmann"/&gt; The choice Jesus made thus counter-positions him as a new man of morality and obedience, in contrast to [[Adam and Eve|Adam]]'s disobedience.&lt;ref name=Pannenberg &gt;''Systematic Theology, Volume 2'' by Wolfhart Pannenberg 2004 0567084663 ISBN pages 297-303&lt;/ref&gt;

The five major milestones in the gospel narrative of the life of Jesus are his [[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism]], [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]], Crucifixion, Resurrection and [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]].&lt;ref name=digby &gt;''Essays in New Testament interpretation'' by Charles Francis Digby Moule 1982 {{ISBN|0-521-23783-1}} page 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Melody of Faith: Theology in an Orthodox Key'' by Vigen Guroian 2010 {{ISBN|0-8028-6496-1}} page 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JBreck12 /&gt; These are usually bracketed by two other episodes: his [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] at the beginning and the sending of the [[Paraclete]] at the end.&lt;ref name=digby /&gt;&lt;ref name=JBreck12 &gt;''Scripture in tradition'' by John Breck 2001 {{ISBN|0-88141-226-0}} page 12&lt;/ref&gt; The gospel accounts of the teachings of Jesus are often presented in terms of specific categories involving his "works and words", e.g. his [[Ministry of Jesus|ministry]], [[Parables of Jesus|parables]] and [[Miracles of Jesus|miracles]].&lt;ref name=Zuck100 &gt;''The Bible Knowledge Commentary'' by John F. Walvoord, Roy B. Zuck 1983 {{ISBN|0-88207-812-7}} page 100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WPent212 &gt;''The words and works of Jesus Christ'' by J. Dwight Pentecost 2000 {{ISBN|978-0-310-30940-6}} page 212&lt;/ref&gt;  The words of Jesus include several sermons, in addition to parables that appear throughout the narrative of the [[Synoptic Gospels]] (the gospel of John includes no parables).

Christians not only attach theological significance to the works of Jesus, but also to his name. Devotions to the [[Holy Name of Jesus]] go back to the [[Early Christianity|earliest days of Christianity]].&lt;ref name=Sylvester &gt;''Outlines of dogmatic theology, Volume 2 by Sylvester Hunter 2010 {{ISBN|1-146-98633-5}} page 443&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Houlden &gt;''Jesus: the complete guide'' by Leslie Houlden 2006 {{ISBN|0-8264-8011-X}} page 426&lt;/ref&gt; These devotions and feasts exist both in [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern]] and [[Western Church|Western Christianity]].&lt;ref name="Houlden"/&gt;

===Incarnation===
{{Further information|Incarnation (Christianity)|Christology}}
Most Christians believe that Jesus was both human and the Son of God. While there have been theological debate over the nature of Jesus, [[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Christians generally believe that Jesus is [[Incarnation (Christianity)|God incarnate]], [[God the Son]], and "[[Hypostatic union|true God and true man]]" (or both fully divine and fully human). Jesus, [[Incarnation (Christianity)|having become fully human]] in all respects, suffered the pains and temptations of a mortal man, yet he did not sin. As fully God, he defeated death and rose to life again. According to the [[Bible]], God raised him from the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Acts|2:24|NIV}}, {{bibleref2|Romans|10:9|NIV}}, {{bibleref2|1Cor|15:15|NIV}}, {{bibleref2|Acts|2:31-32}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|3:15}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|3:26}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|4:10}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|5:30}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|10:40-41}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|13:30}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|13:34}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|13:37}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|17:30-31}}, {{bibleref2|1Cor|6:14}}, {{bibleref2|2Cor|4:14}}, {{bibleref2|Gal|1:1}}, {{bibleref2|Eph|1:20}}, {{bibleref2|Col|2:12}}, {{bibleref2|1Thess|1:10}}, {{bibleref2|Heb|13:20}}, {{bibleref2|1Pet|1:3}}, {{bibleref2-nb|1Pet|1:21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He [[Ascension of Jesus|ascended to heaven]], to the "right hand of God,"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Mark|16:19}}, {{bibleref2|Luke|22:69}}, {{bibleref2|Acts|2:33}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|5:31}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|7:55-56}}, {{bibleref2|Romans|8:34}}, {{bibleref2|Eph|1:20}}, {{bibleref2|Col|3:1}}, {{bibleref2|Hebrews|1:3}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Hebrews|1:13}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Hebrews|10:12}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Hebrews|12:2}}, {{bibleref2|1Peter|3:22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he will [[Second Coming|return again]] for the [[Last Judgment]] and the establishment of the [[Kingdom of God]].&lt;ref&gt;cf. {{Bibleref2|John|14:1-3}}, {{Bibleref2|Acts|1:10-11}}, {{Bibleref2|Luke|21:27}}, {{Bibleref2|Revelation|1:7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
{{main article|Jesus in Islam}}
{{See also|Jesus in Ahmadiyya Islam}}
In Islam, Jesus (''Isa'') is considered to be a [[Apostle (Islam)|messenger]] of God (''[[Allah]]'') and the Messiah (''[[Messiah#Islam|al-Masih]]'') who was sent to guide the [[Israelites|Children of Israel]] (''Bani Isra'il'') with a new scripture, the Gospel.&lt;ref name="CEI"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D7tu12gt4JYC&amp;pg=PA270#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Concise Encyclopedia of Islam | publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield | last=Glassé | first=Cyril | year=2008 | pages=270–271 | isbn=978-0-7425-6296-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Islam|year=2003|first=John L. |last=Esposito |page= 158|publisher=Oxford University Press| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E324pQEEQQcC&amp;pg=PA159#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-19-975726-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Quran]] mentions Jesus by name 25 times—more often than [[Muhammad]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aboul-Enein|first=Youssef H.|title=Militant Islamist Ideology: Understanding the Global Threat|year=2010|publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=978-1-61251-015-6|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tX3suVDTJz0C&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and emphasises that Jesus was a mortal human who, like all other prophets, had been divinely chosen to spread God's message.&lt;ref name="comparative"&gt;{{cite book|title=Comparative Religious Ethics: A Narrative Approach|first1=Darrell J.|last1= Fasching |first2= Dell |last2=deChant|year=2001| pages= 241, 274–275 |isbn=978-0-631-20125-0 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Christian writings, the Quran  does not describe Jesus as the [[son of God]], but as one of four major human [[Rasul|messengers]] (out of many [[Prophets of Islam|prophets]]) sent by God throughout history to guide mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mystical Dimensions of Islam|publisher=Chapel Hill:University of North Carolina Press|author=Annemarie Schimmel|date=1975|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus is said to have lived a life of piety and generosity, and abstained from eating flesh of swine (or of any animals, according to some Muslim authors, even some who were not vegetarians themselves).

Muslims also believe that Jesus received a Gospel from God, called the ''[[Gospel in Islam|Injil]]''. However, Muslims hold that Jesus' original message was [[tahrif|lost or altered]] and that the Christian New Testament does not accurately represent God's original message to mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor-last=Bockmuehl |editor-first= Markus N. A. |title=Quests for the historical Jesus |first=James C. |last=Paget |year=2001|encyclopedia= Cambridge companion to Jesus|publisher= Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vSehrtQpcYcC&amp;pg=PA183#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-521-79678-1|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite some major differences, the Quran and New Testament overlap in other aspects of Jesus' life; both Muslims and orthodox Christians believe that Jesus was miraculously born without a human biological father by the will of God, and that his mother, Mary (''[[Mary in Islam|Maryam]]'' in Arabic), is among the most saintly, pious, chaste and virtuous women ever.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito, John. ''What Everyone Needs to Know About Islam''. New York: University Press, 2002. P31.&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran also specifies that Jesus was able to perform [[miracle]]s&amp;mdash;though only by the will of God&amp;mdash;including being able to raise the dead, restore sight to the blind and cure lepers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Diane|title=Essential Islam: A Comprehensive Guide to Belief and Practice|year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-36025-1|pages=45–46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U94S6N2zECAC&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; One miracle attributed to Jesus in the Quran, but not in the New Testament, is his being able to speak at only a few days old, to defend his mother from accusations of [[adultery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|19|27|e=33|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also says that Jesus was a 'word' from God, since he was predicted to come in the [[Old Testament]].

Most Muslims believe that he was neither killed nor crucified, but that God made it appear so to his enemies. With the noteworthy exception of [[Ahmadi]] Muslims who believe that Jesus was indeed put on the cross, survived the crucifixion and was not lifted bodily to the heaven, majority of Muslims believe that Jesus ascended bodily to heaven and is alive. Majority of the Muslim population does not consider Ahmadi Muslims to be Muslims and consider them as Infidels due to their unorthodox perspectives. Some Muslim scholars maintain that Jesus was indeed put up on the cross, but did not die on it; rather, he revived and then ascended bodily to heaven. Others say that it was actually [[Judas Iscariot]] who was mistakenly crucified by the Romans. Regardless, Muslims believe that Jesus is alive in [[heaven]] and will return to the world in the flesh to defeat the [[Antichrist]], once the world has become filled with sin, deception and injustice, and then live out the rest of his natural life.&lt;ref name="CEI"/&gt;

Islam rejects the [[Trinity|Trinitarian Christian]] view that Jesus was [[Incarnation (Christianity)|God incarnate]] or the [[son of God]], that he was ever crucified or resurrected or that he ever [[Atonement in Christianity|atoned]] for the sins of mankind. The Quran says that Jesus himself never claimed any of these things, and it furthermore indicates that Jesus will deny having ever claimed divinity at the Last Judgment, and God will vindicate him.{{Cite quran|5|116}}

==Judaism==
{{Main article|Judaism's view of Jesus}}
[[Judaism]] rejects the idea of Jesus being God, or a person of a Trinity, or a mediator to God. Judaism also holds that Jesus is not the [[Jewish Messianism|Messiah]], arguing that he had not fulfilled the [[Messianic prophecies]] in the [[Tanakh]] nor embodied the personal qualifications of the Messiah. According to Jewish tradition, there were no more prophets after [[Malachi]], who lived centuries before Jesus and delivered his prophesies about 420 BC/BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shraga Simmons|Simmons, Shraga]], "[http://www.aish.com/jewishissues/jewishsociety/Why_Jews_Dont_Believe_In_Jesus.asp Why Jews Do not Believe in Jesus]", Retrieved April 15, 2007; "[http://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/2637/Q1/ Why Jews Do not Believe in Jesus]", [[Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem|Ohr Samayach]]&amp;nbsp;— ''Ask the Rabbi'', Retrieved April 15, 2007; "[http://www.askmoses.com/qa_detail.html?h=120&amp;o=350 Why do not Jews believe that Jesus was the Messiah?]", [[AskMoses.com]], Retrieved April 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Conservative Judaism]], Jews who believe Jesus is the Messiah have "crossed the line out of the Jewish community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscj.org/Messianic_Jews_Not_J5480.html|title=Messianic Jews Are Not Jews|accessdate=January 15, 2008|last=Waxman|first=Jonathan|year=2006|publisher=[[United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism]]|quote=Judaism has held that the Mashiach will come and usher in a new era; not that he will proclaim his arrival, die and wait centuries to finish his task.

===Jesus in Jewish writings===
{{See also|Jesus in the Talmud}}
The [[Babylonian Talmud]] include stories of ''[[Yeshu]]'' {{lang|he|יֵשׁוּ}}; the vast majority of contemporary historians disregard these as sources on the [[historical Jesus]].&lt;ref name="TM1998"&gt;Theissen, Gerd and Annette Merz. The historical Jesus: a comprehensive guide. Fortress Press. 1998. translated from German (1996 edition)&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Talmud scholars view these as comments on the relationship between Judaism and Christians or other sectarians, rather than comments on the historical Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Boyarin, ''Dying for God: Martyrdom and the Making of Christianity and Judaism'' Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Rubenstein ''Rabbinic Stories'' (The Classics of Western Spirituality) New York: The Paulist Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', an authoritative work of [[halakha|Jewish law]], states in ''Hilkhot Melakhim'' 11:10–12 that Jesus is a "stumbling block" who makes "the majority of the world err to serve a divinity besides God".

==Bahá'í Faith==
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] consider Jesus to be a [[manifestation of God]], who are a series of personages who reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world for the progress and advancement of human morals and civilization.&lt;ref name="manifestation"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Juan | last = Cole | title = The Concept of Manifestation in the Bahá'í Writings| year = 1982 | journal = Bahá'í Studies | volume = monograph 9 | pages = 1–38 | url = http://bahai-library.com/cole_concept_manifestation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Bahá'í belief, the Manifestations have always been sent by God, and always will, as part of the single [[progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|progressive religion]] from God bringing more teachings through time to help humanity progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Progressive revelation |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 276–277}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Manifestations of God are taught to be "one and the same", and in their relationship to one another have both the station of unity and the station of distinction.&lt;ref name="manifestation" /&gt; In this way each Manifestation of God manifested the Word of God and taught the same religion, with modifications for the particular audience's needs and culture. [[Bahá'u'lláh]] wrote that since each Manifestation of God has the same divine attributes, they can be seen as the spiritual "return" of all the previous Manifestations of God.&lt;ref name="manifestation" /&gt; In this way, Bahá'ís believe that Bahá'u'lláh is, in both respects, the return of Jesus.

==Other==
Traditionally, Buddhists as a group take no particular view on Jesus, and [[Buddhism and Christianity]] have but a minor intersection. However, some scholars have noted similarities between the life and teachings of [[Gautama Buddha]] and [[Jesus]]. These similarities might be attributed to Buddhist missionaries sent as early as Emperor [[Ashoka]] around 250 BCE in many of the Greek [[Seleucid]] kingdoms that existed then and then later became the same regions that Christianity began.&lt;ref&gt;Old World Encounters. Cross-cultural contacts and exchanges in pre-modern times" by Jerry H.Bentley (Oxford University Press, 1993) {{ISBN|0-19-507639-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus was seen as the savior and bringer of [[gnosis]] by various [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] sects, such as the extinct [[Manichaeism]]. In the [[Jesus in Ahmadiyya Islam|Ahmadiyya Islamic view]], Jesus survived the crucifixion and later travelled to [[India]], where he lived as a prophet (and died) under the name of [[Yuz Asaf]].

The '''Rimé movement''' is a movement involving the [[Sakya]], [[Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]] schools of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], along with some [[Bon]] scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, Donald S. (1998). ''Prisoners of Shangri-La: Tibetan Buddhism and the West''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

Having seen how the [[Gelug]] institutions pushed the other traditions into the corners of Tibet's cultural life, [[Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo]] (1820-1892) and [[Jamgon Kongtrul|Jamgön Kongtrül]] (1813-1899) compiled together the teachings of the [[Sakya]], [[Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]], including many near-extinct teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Schaik, Sam van. ''Tibet: A History''. Yale University Press 2011, page 165-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Without Khyentse and Kongtrul's collecting and printing of rare works, the suppression of Buddhism by the Communists would have been much more final.&lt;ref&gt;Schaik, Sam van. ''Tibet: A History''. Yale University Press 2011, page 169.&lt;/ref&gt; The Rimé movement is responsible for a number of scriptural compilations, such as the ''[[Nyingma#Rinchen Terdzod|Rinchen Terdzod]]'' and the ''[[Sheja Dzö]]''.

==The Rimé approach==

Most scholars of Buddhism explain Rimé as an "[[Eclecticism|eclectic]] movement",&lt;ref&gt;Damien Keown: Oxford ''Dictionary of Buddhism'', p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Dreyfus, Georges B.J. &amp; Sara L. McClintock (eds). ''The Svatantrika-Prasangika Distinction: What Difference Does a Difference Make?'' Wisdom Publications, 2003, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel, Geoffrey. (1993). ''Civilized shamans: Buddhism in Tibetan societies''. Washington DC: Smithsonian Institution Press, pp. 538, 546&lt;/ref&gt; however one scholar has suggested that this is an inadequate rendering, saying "In fact this Rimé movement was not exactly eclectic but [[universalistic]] (and encyclopaedic), ''rimed (pa)'' (the antonym of ''risu ch'edpa'') meaning unbounded, all-embracing, unlimited, and also impartial."&lt;ref&gt;Seyfort Ruegg quoted in Samuel, Goeffrey (1993). ''Civilized Shamans. Buddhism in Tibetan Societies'', p. 538&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most prominent contemporary Rimé masters, Ringu Tulku, emphasizes the message of the original Rimé founders, that it is not a new school.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kxd_VOH1aI Ri-Mé_Approach]. YouTube (26 January 2008). Retrieved 20 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is simply an approach allowing freedom of choice which was always the majority practice within the history of Tibetan Buddhism. The [[Karmapa]]s, [[Je Tsongkhapa]], the [[Dalai Lama]]s, [[Sakya]] lineage heads and major [[Nyingma]] and [[Kagyu]] figures took teachings and empowerments from various schools and lineages.

The movement's name is derived from two [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] words: ''Ris'' (bias, side) and ''Med'' (lack), which combined expresses the idea of openness to other Tibetan Buddhist traditions, as opposed to [[sectarianism]]. The Rimé movement therefore is often misunderstood as trying to unite the various [[sect]]s through their similarities. Rather Rimé was intended to recognize the differences between traditions and appreciate them, while also establishing a dialogue which would create common ground. It is considered important that variety be preserved, and therefore Rimé teachers are generally careful to emphasize differences in thought, giving students many options as to how to proceed in their spiritual training.

Ringu Tulku describes these points which are often misrepresented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Ris'' or ''Phyog-ris'' in Tibetan means "one-sided", "partisan" or "sectarian". ''Med'' means "No". ''Ris-med'' (Wylie), or ''Rimé'', therefore means "no sides", "non-partisan" or "non-sectarian". It does not mean "non-conformist" or "non-committal"; nor does it mean forming a new School or system that is different from the existing ones. A person who believes the Rimé way almost certainly follows one lineage as his or her main practice. He or she would not dissociate from the School in which he or she was raised. Kongtrul was raised in the Nyingma and Kagyu traditions; Khyentse was reared in a strong Sakyapa tradition. They never failed to acknowledge their affiliation to their own Schools.&lt;ref&gt;The Ri-me Philosophy of Jamgön Kongtrul the Great: A Study of the Buddhist Lineages of Tibet, [http://info-buddhism.com/Rime_Movement-Ringu_Tulku.html Chapter I], Shambhala Publications, 2006. Retrieved 15 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rimé is not a way of uniting different Schools and lineages by emphasizing their similarities. It is basically an appreciation of their differences and an acknowledgement of the importance of having this variety for the benefit of practitioners with different needs. Therefore the Rimé teachers always take great care that the teachings and practices of the different Schools and lineages and their unique styles do not become confused with one another. To retain the original style and methods of each teaching lineage preserves the power of that lineage experience. Kongtrul and Khyentse made great efforts to retain the original flavor of each teaching, while making them available to many. Kongtrul writes about Khyentse in his biography of the latter.... When he (Khyentse Rinpoche) taught, he would give the teachings of each lineage clearly and intelligibly without confusing the terms and concepts of other teachings.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.abuddhistlibrary.com/Buddhism/A%20-%20Tibetan%20Buddhism/Authors/Ringu%20Tulku/The%20Rime%20Movement/THE%20RIME%20%28%20Ris-med%20%29%20MOVEMENT.htm The Rime ( Ris-Med ) Movement]. Abuddhistlibrary.com (24 July 2000). Retrieved 2 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rimé was initially intended to counteract the novel growing suspicion and tension building between the different traditions, which at the time had, in many places, gone so far as to forbid studying one another's scriptures. Tibetan Buddhism has a long history of vigorous debate and argumentation between schools and within one's training. This can lead a practitioner to believe that one's school has the best approach or highest philosophic view and that other lineages have a lower or flawed understanding. The Rimé approach cautions against developing that viewpoint, while at the same time appreciating that the debate and discussion is important and that arguing which views are higher and lower is still valid discourse.

Jamgon Kongtrul pointed out the necessity of each practitioner to have a strong foundation in one school:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The scholars and siddhas of the various schools make their own individual presentations of the dharma. Each one is full of strong points and supported by valid reasoning. If you are well grounded in the presentations of your own tradition, then it is unnecessary to be sectarian. But if you get mixed up about the various tenets and the terminology, then you lack even a foothold in your own tradition. You try to use someone else's system to support your understanding, and then get all tangled up, like a bad weaver, concerning the view, meditation, conduct, and result. Unless you have certainty in your own system, you cannot use reasoning to support your scriptures, and you cannot challenge the assertions of others. You become a laughing stock in the eyes of the learned ones. It would be much better to possess a clear understanding of your own tradition.

In summary, one must see all the teachings as without contradiction, and consider all the scriptures as instructions. This will cause the root of [[sectarianism]] and prejudice to dry up, and give you a firm foundation in the Buddhas teachings. At that point, hundreds of doors to the eighty-four thousand teachings of the dharma will simultaneously be open to you.&lt;ref&gt;The Ri-Me Philosophy of Jamgon Kongtrul the Great: A Study of the Buddhist Lineages of Tibet by Ringu Tulku, [http://info-buddhism.com/Rime_Movement-Ringu_Tulku.html Chapter I], {{ISBN|1-59030-286-9}}, Shambhala Publications, Publications, 2006. Retrieved 15 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A rimé practitioner may take empowerments from numerous lineages and living masters, though it is not a requirement to do so.

==Rimé's founders==
Two of the founding voices of Rimé were [[Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo]] and [[Jamgon Kongtrul]], both from different schools; the epithets ''Jamyang'' ({{bo|w='jam dbyangs}}, {{lang-sa|Mañjughoṣa|script=Latn}}) and ''Jamgön'' ({{bo|w='jam mgon}}, {{lang-sa|Mañjunātha|links=no|script=Latn}}) in their name indicating that they are considered to be emanations of [[Manjushri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Samuel|first=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Samuel|title=CIVILIZED SHAMANS PB|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JsVcPwAACAAJ|date=17 September 1995|publisher=Smithsonian|isbn=978-1-56098-620-1|page=538}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jamgön Kongtrul was from the [[Nyingma]] and [[Kagyu]] traditions, while Wangpo had been raised within the [[Sakya]] order. At the time, Tibetan schools of thought had become very isolated, and both Wangpo and Jamgon Kongtrul were instrumental in re-initiating dialogue between the sects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ringu Tulku|authorlink=Ringu Tulku|title=The Ri-Me Philosophy of Jamgon Kongtrul the Great: A Study of the Buddhist Lineages of Tibet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p8l0Qwl9gdcC|year=2007|publisher=Shambhala Publications|isbn=978-1-59030-464-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rachel H. Pang has noted that non-sectarian ideals are also strongly present in the works of [[Shabkar Tsokdruk Rangdrol]] even though he predates the movement by about three decades and never met with any of the Rimé masters from [[Kham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pang|first1=Rachel H.|title=The Rimé Activities of Shabkar Tsokdruk Rangdrol (1781-1851)|journal=Revue d’Etudes Tibétaines|date=October 2014|volume=30|url=http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/ret/pdf/ret_30_01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rimé movement came to prominence at a point in Tibetan history when the religious climate had become partisan.&lt;ref name=GKLT-I&gt;{{cite book|author=Jamgon Kongtrul|authorlink=Jamgon Kongtrul|title=The Treasury of Knowledge: Book Six, Part Three: Frameworks Of Buddhist Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ffp8_KZMYUEC|year=2007|publisher=Shambhala|isbn=978-1-55939-883-1|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the movement was "a push towards a middle ground where the various views and styles of the different traditions were appreciated for their individual contributions rather than being refuted, marginalized, or banned."&lt;ref name=GKLT-I/&gt; Many of the teachings of various schools were close to being lost and  the movement set out to preserve them.&lt;ref name=GKLT-I/&gt; However, though the Rimé movement gathered together teachings from each of the various traditions, it did not mix these, but recognised the individual integrity of each.&lt;ref name=GKLT-I/&gt;

The movement began within a large context of increasing domination by the [[Gelug]] school. Beginning in the 17th century, the Gelug view and politics increasingly dominated in Tibet and the minority lineages were at risk for losing their traditions.&lt;ref name="dreyfus320" &gt;Dreyfus (2003) p.320&lt;/ref&gt; At its founding, the Rimé movement was primarily non-Gelugpa teachers and at times the movement has appeared critical of Gelug views. [[Georges Dreyfus]] suggests this argumentation was less to create further division but was to bolster minority views that had been marginalized by Gelug supremacy. Nonetheless, philosophic commentaries by early Rimé writers tend to criticize Gelugpa tenets.&lt;ref name="dreyfus320" /&gt;

However, Rimé was in its idealized presentation the reestablishment of a rule or principle that had always been present in Tibetan Buddhism, but that had been de-emphasized or forgotten: To ignorantly criticize other traditions was wrong, and that misunderstandings due to ignorance should be immediately alleviated. Ringu Tulku says:
{{quote|The Rimé concept was not original to Kongtrul and Khyentse – neither were they new to Buddhism! The Lord Buddha forbade his students even to criticise the teachings and teachers of other religions and cultures. The message was so strong and unambiguous that [[Candrakīrti|Chandra Kirti]] had to defend [[Nagarjuna]]'s treatises on [[Madhyamaka|Madhyamika]] by saying, "If, by trying to understand the truth, you dispel the misunderstandings of some people and thereby some philosophies are damaged – that cannot be taken as criticising the views of others" ([[Madhyamakāvatāra|''Madhyamika-avatara'']]). A true Buddhist cannot be but non-sectarian and Rimé in their approach.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;}}

The movement became particularly well-established in the [[Kingdom of Derge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Huber | first = Toni | title =  The Holy Land Reborn: Pilgrimage &amp; the Tibetan Reinvention of Buddhist India | publisher = University of Chicago Press | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-226-35648-5 | page = 116 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=SjzSpGf1eM0C&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=Derge+kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rimé has become an integral part of the Tibetan tradition, and continues to be an important philosophy in Tibetan Buddhism.

Other notable Tibetan Lamas noted for their non-sectarian approach were [[Patrul Rinpoche]] and [[Orgyen Chokgyur Lingpa]]. Shabkar Tsodruk Rangdrol, [[Dudjom Lingpa]] and the [[Khakyab Dorje, 15th Karmapa Lama]], who was a student of Jamgön Kongtrul. Other lineage leaders gave their blessing to the movement and its founders who were considered extremely realized.

==Persecution by Phabongkha and his disciples==
David Kay notes that [[Dorje Shugden]] was a key element in [[Pabongkhapa Déchen Nyingpo]]'s persecution of the Rimé movement:
{{quote|As the Gelug agent of the Tibetan government in Kham (Khams) (Eastern Tibet), and in response to the Rimed movement that had originated and was flowering in that region, Phabongkha Rinpoche and his disciples employed repressive measures against non-Gelug sects. Religious artefacts associated with Padmasambhava – who is revered as a ‘second Buddha’ by Nyingma practitioners – were destroyed, and non-Gelug, and particularly Nyingma, monasteries were forcibly converted to the Gelug position. A key element of Phabongkha Rinpoche’s outlook was the cult of the protective deity Dorje Shugden, which he married to the idea of Gelug exclusivism and employed against other traditions as well as against those within the Gelug who had eclectic tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;Kay, D. N. (2004). ''Tibetan and Zen Buddhism in Britain: Transplantation, development and adaptation''. RoutledgeCurzon critical studies in Buddhism. London: RoutledgeCurzon. p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|His teaching tour of Kham in 1938 was a seminal phase, leading to a hardening of his exclusivism and the adoption of a militantly sectarian stance. In reaction to the flourishing Rimed movement and the perceived decline of Gelug monasteries in that region, Phabongkha and his disciples spearheaded a revival movement, promoting the supremacy of the Gelug as the only pure tradition. He now regarded the inclusivism of Gelug monks who practised according to the teachings of other schools as a threat to the integrity of the Gelug tradition, and he aggressively opposed the influence of other traditions, particularly the Nyingma, whose teachings were deemed mistaken and deceptive. A key element of Phabongkha’s revival movement was the practice of relying upon Dorje Shugden, the main function of the deity now being presented as "the protection of the Ge-luk tradition through violent means, even including the killing of its enemies."&lt;ref&gt;Kay, D. N. (2004). ''Tibetan and Zen Buddhism in Britain: Transplantation, development and adaptation''. RoutledgeCurzon critical studies in Buddhism. London: RoutledgeCurzon. p.47.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Rimé movement, primarily composed of the [[Sakya]], [[Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]] schools, arose in the first place as a result of Gelug persecution.&lt;ref&gt;Schaik, Sam van. ''Tibet: A History''. Yale University Press 2011, page 165-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present-day Rimé movement==
The movement's achievements have been successful in the 20th century where taking teachings and transmissions from different schools and lineages has become the norm amongst many monastic students, lamas, yogis as well as lay practitioners. This has mainly been due to the proactive support of many lineage holders and various leaders such as the [[13th Dalai Lama|13th]] and [[14th Dalai Lama]]s, the [[Khakyab Dorje, 15th Karmapa Lama|15th]] and [[Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, 16th Karmapa|16th Karmapas]], [[Sakya Trizin]] and [[Dudjom Jigdral Yeshe Dorje]], following the "eclectic" approach of the 5th Dalai Lama "who blurred the lines between traditions":&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;{{quote|In the West, where so many different Buddhist traditions exist side by side, one needs to be constantly on one's guard against the danger of sectarianism. Such a divisive attitude is often the result of failing to understand or appreciate anything outside one's own tradition. Teachers from all schools would therefore benefit greatly from studying and gaining some practical experience of the teachings of other traditions.&lt;ref&gt;An Open Letter by The Network for Western Buddhist Teachers, ''Tricycle'', Fall 1993&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The 14th Dalai Lama composed a prayer for the movement praising various historic figures and lineages of [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhism]] from India and Tibet, part of which says:

:In short, may all the teachings of the Buddha in the Land of Snows
:Flourish long into the future— the ten great pillars of the study lineage,
:And the chariots of the practice lineage, such as Shijé (‘Pacifying’) and the rest,
:All of them rich with their essential instructions combining sutra and mantra.

:May the lives of the masters who uphold these teachings be secure and harmonious!
:May the sangha preserve these teachings through their study, meditation and activity!
:May the world be filled with faithful individuals intent on following these teachings!
:And long may the non-sectarian teachings of the Buddha continue to flourish!&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lotsawahouse.org/tibetan-masters/living-masters/dalai-lama/harmonious-song-truth Dalai Lama | Sage's Harmonious Song of Truth].

Other modern adherents include the late [[Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, 16th Karmapa|16th Karmapa]] and 2nd Dudjom Rinpoche, both of whom gave extensive teachings from the works of Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro, as well as [[Akong Rinpoche]] who, with the late [[Chögyam Trungpa]], helped establish Tibetan Buddhism in the [[United Kingdom]]. The lineage of the late [[Nyoshul Khenpo Rinpoche]] is represented today in the teachings of [[Surya Das]].

The 14th Dalai Lama supports and encourages a non-sectarian spirit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tibet.com/dholgyal/hhdl.html His Holiness the Dalai Lama's response to media a question on Shugden at the press conference in Indianapolis on 16 August 1999] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514154615/http://www.tibet.com/dholgyal/hhdl.html |date=14 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dalai Lama and Sogyal Rinpoche (2007) ''Mind in Comfort and Ease: The Vision of Enlightenment in the Great Perfection'' {{ISBN|0-86171-493-8}} page xiii&lt;/ref&gt; Major Gelug figures like Shabkar in the 19th century, and the Panchen Lamas and Reting Rinpoche in the 20th century studied Nyingma teachings along with their Gelug training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simhas.org/chatral.html Simhanada-The Lord of Refuge Chatral Rinpoche] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603175322/http://www.simhas.org/chatral.html |date=3 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shabkar.org/teachers/tibetanbuddhism/chatral_rinpoche.htm Kyabje Chatral Sangye Dorje Rinpoche | Vegetarianism &amp; Saving Lives (Tsethar)].

[[Bön]] teacher [[Tenzin Wangyal]] cautions, however, that even this so-called non-sectarian attitude may be taken to an extreme:
{{quote|A problem that seems very difficult to avoid involves the tendency of spiritual schools either to want to preserve their traditions in a very closed way or to want to be very open and nonsectarian; but there is often the danger that this very nonsectarianism can become a source of [[self-justification]] and lead to as closed an attitude as that of the sectarians.&lt;ref&gt;Wangyal, Tenzin (1993).

==Early life==

Almost everything known about Sai Baba's early life stems from the [[hagiography]] that grew around him, narratives that hold special meaning to his devotees and are considered by them to be evidence of his divine nature.&lt;ref name="BabbLawrence"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UrbanHugh74" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Palmer99&gt;Palmer, Norris W.

Sai Baba's siblings included elder brother Ratnakaram Seshama Raju (1911–1985), sisters Venkamma (1918–1993) and Parvathamma (1920–1998), and younger brother Janakiramaiah (1931–2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Times of India |title=&amp;#145;Vaastu dosham&amp;#146; at hospital he built, say Sai kin |date=25 April 2011 |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-04-22/india/29463028_1_sathya-sai-baba-satyajit-trust-affairsnephew }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, he was described as "unusually intelligent" and charitable, though not necessarily academically inclined, as his interests were of a more spiritual nature.&lt;ref name="BabbLawrence"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Palmer99 /&gt; He was uncommonly talented in devotional music, dance and drama.&lt;ref name=Palmer99 /&gt;&lt;ref name="kent"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kent | first = Alexandra | authorlink = |title =Divinity and Diversity: A Hindu Revitalization Movement in Malaysia |publisher = Nordic Institute of Asian Studies | year = 2005  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=26sVhUo_aM4C&amp;pg=PA37 |pages = 37–39| isbn = 87-91114-40-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a young age, he was alleged to have been capable of materialising objects such as food and sweets out of thin air.&lt;ref name="AlexandraKent"&gt;Alexandra Kent – Creating Divine Unity: Chinese Recruitment in the Sathya Sai Baba Movement of Malaysia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Larson"&gt;Larson's Book of World Religions and Alternative Spirituality&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proclamation==

[[File:Baba-1940's.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Sai Baba at the age of 14, soon after proclaiming he was the reincarnation of Shirdi Sai Baba]]
On 8 March 1940, while living with his elder brother Seshama Raju in [[Uravakonda]], a small town near Puttaparthi, 14 year old Sathya was apparently stung by a scorpion.&lt;ref name="AlexandraKent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Larson"/&gt; He lost consciousness for several hours&lt;ref name="kent"/&gt; and in the next few days underwent a noticeable change in behaviour.&lt;ref name="Larson"/&gt; There were "symptoms of laughing and weeping, eloquence and silence."&lt;ref name="Larson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="serpent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vahini.org/sss/i/serpent.html |title=Sathyam Sivam Sundaram Part I: 5. The Serpent Hill |publisher=Vahini.org |date=8 March 1940 |accessdate=6 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed that then "he began to sing [[Sanskrit]] verses, a language of which it is alleged he had no prior knowledge."&lt;ref name="RichardWeiss"/&gt; Doctors concluded his behaviour to be [[hysteria]].&lt;ref name="RichardWeiss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Larson"/&gt; Concerned, his parents brought Sathya back home to Puttaparthi&lt;ref name="sss3620"&gt;{{cite web| last = Staff| first =| title = Sathya Sai Speaks Volume 36 (2003): 20.

One of the exorcists at [[Kadiri]], a town near Puttaparthi, went to the extent of torturing him with the aim of curing him;{{elucidate|date=March 2013}} Sathya seemingly kept calm throughout the torture.&lt;ref name="Larson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="serpent"/&gt;

On 23 May 1940, Sathya called household members and reportedly materialised sugar candy (''[[prasad]])'' and flowers for them.&lt;ref name="Kheirabadi2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Masoud Kheirabadi|title=Sri Satya Sai Baba|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n06499wG5VcC&amp;pg=PA28|accessdate=24 April 2011|date=March 2005|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-7910-8104-4|pages=28–}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father became furious at seeing this, thinking his son was [[Spirit possession|bewitched]]. He took a stick and threatened to beat him if Sathya did not reveal who he really was, the young Sathya responded calmly and firmly "I am Sai Baba", a reference to [[Sai Baba of Shirdi]].&lt;ref name="RichardWeiss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kent"/&gt; This was the first time he proclaimed himself to be the reincarnation of Sai Baba of Shirdi—a saint who became famous in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in [[Maharashtra]] and had died eight years before Sathya was born.&lt;ref name="RichardWeiss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sss3620"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schulman, Arnold 1971 pp. 122"&gt;Schulman, Arnold (1971).

==First mandir and development of Puttaparthi==

In 1944, a [[mandir]] for Sai Baba's devotees was built near the village of [[Puttaparthi]]. It is now referred to as the "old mandir".&lt;ref name="murphetman"&gt;Murphet, Howard (1977), ''Man of Miracles'', Weiser, {{ISBN|0-87728-335-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bowen"&gt;Bowen, David (1988).

==Stroke, paralysis and prediction of reincarnation==

In 1963, it was asserted that Sai Baba suffered a stroke and four severe heart attacks, which left him paralysed on one side.&lt;ref name="murphetmiracle"&gt;Murphet, Howard (1977). ''Man of Miracles''. Weiser. {{ISBN|0-87728-335-4}} portions available online https://books.google.com/books?id=BPsVFqhclS0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; These events culminated in an event where he apparently healed himself in front of the thousands of people gathered in Prashanthi Nilayam who were then praying for his recovery.&lt;ref name="BabbLawrence"/&gt;

On recovering, Sai Baba announced that he would one day next be reborn as an incarnation named ''Prema Sai Baba'' in the neighbouring state of [[Karnataka]].&lt;ref name="BabbLawrence"/&gt; He stated, "I am Shiva-Sakthi, born in the [[gotra]] (lineage) of [[Bharadwaja]], according to a boon won by that sage from [[Shiva|Siva]] and [[Shakti|Sakthi]]. Siva was born in the gotra of that sage as Sai Baba of Shirdi; Shiva and Sakthi have incarnated as Myself in his gotra now; Sakthi alone will incarnate as the third Sai (Prema Sai Baba) in the same gotra in [[Mandya]] district of Karnataka State."&lt;ref name="BabbLawrence"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SSDiscourse1963"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sathyasai.org/discour/1963/d630706.htm |title=Shiva Shakthi |publisher=Sathyasai.org |date=6 July 1963 |accessdate=6 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated he would be born again eight years after his death at the age of 96,&lt;ref name="saiprema"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sathyasai.org/intro/premasai.htm|title=About Prema Sai Baba|work=sathyasai.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; but died at the age of 84.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13180011 | work=BBC News | title=Satya Sai Baba, Indian guru, dies at 84 | date=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africa==

On 29 June 1968, Sai Baba made his only overseas trip, to [[Kenya]] and [[Uganda]].&lt;ref name="murphetmiracle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kasturi3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vahini.org/sss/iii/awakening.html |title=Sathyam Sivam Sundaram Part III: 3.

I have not come on behalf of any exclusive religion. I have not come on a mission of publicity for a sect or creed or cause, nor have I come to collect followers for a doctrine. I have no plan to attract disciples or devotees into my fold or any fold.

==Later years==

In 1968, he established Dharmakshetra or the Sathyam Mandir in [[Mumbai]].&lt;ref name="Official"/&gt; In 1973, he established the Shivam Mandir in [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]].&lt;ref name="Official"/&gt; On 19 January 1981, in [[Chennai]], he inaugurated the Sundaram Mandir.&lt;ref name="Official"/&gt;

In a [[1993 Murders in Prashanthi Nilayam|1993 incident]], four intruders armed with knives entered his bedroom, either as an assassination attempt or as part of a power struggle between his followers. Sai Baba was unharmed. During the scuffle and the police response, the intruders and two of Sai Baba's attendants were killed.

In March 1995, Sai Baba started a project to provide drinking water to 1.2 million people in the drought-prone Rayalaseema region in the [[Anantapur district]] of [[Andhra Pradesh]].&lt;ref name = "cmpraise"/&gt; In April 1999 he inaugurated the Ananda Nilayam Mandir in [[Madurai]], Tamil Nadu.

In 2001 he established another free super-speciality hospital in [[Bangalore]] to benefit the poor.&lt;ref name="TheHinduNewspaper"/&gt; The ''[[Vancouver Sun]]'' in 2001 reported that Sai Baba told his adherents not to browse the Internet&lt;ref name= VS&gt;The Vancouver Sun, 27 February 2001, ''Holy man? Sex abuser? Both?''&lt;/ref&gt; after Sai Baba said, "These teachings (the Vedas) are highly sacred. Today people are ready to believe all that they see on television and internet but do not repose their faith in the Vedic declarations. Internet is like a waste paper basket. Follow the 'innernet,' not the internet."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sssbpt.info/ssspeaks/volume33/sss33-17.pdf 17. The Source And Centre Of Values]. sssbpt.info&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old age and illness==

In 2003, Sai Baba suffered a fractured hip when a student standing on an iron stool slipped and the boy and stool both fell on him. After that he gave [[darshana]] from a car or his porte chair.&lt;ref name="RadioSai20060407"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiosai.org/Pages/PB_20060407.htm |title=Sai Global Harmony – Prasanthi Bulletin |publisher=Radiosai.org |date=7 April 2006 |accessdate=6 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ibnlive.in.com82-2"&gt;{{cite web

==Death==

On 28 March 2011, Sai Baba was admitted to the [[Sri Sathya Sai Super Speciality Hospital]] at Prashantigram at Puttaparthi, following respiration-related problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Sai Baba in stable condition: Hospital| newspaper = [[Hindustan Times]]| date = 5 April 2011| url = http://www.hindustantimes.com/Sai-Baba-in-stable-condition-Hospital/Article1-681433.aspx| accessdate = 24 April 2011| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110509014742/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Sai-Baba-in-stable-condition-Hospital/Article1-681433.aspx| archivedate = 9 May 2011| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Baba's health condition 'stable' | newspaper = [[The Times of India]] | date = 6 April 2011 | url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-04-06/hyderabad/29388337_1_vital-parameters-condition-crrt | accessdate = 24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After nearly a month of hospitalisation, during which his condition progressively deteriorated, Sai Baba died on Sunday, 24 April at 7:40 IST, aged 84.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Spiritual leader Sathya Sai Baba passes away | newspaper = [[The Times of India]] | date = 24 April 2011 | url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-04-24/india/29468573_1_sai-baba-sathya-sai-central-trust-puttaparthi   | accessdate = 24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sai Baba had predicted that he would die at age 96 and would remain healthy until then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Redemptive Encounters: Three Modern Styles in the Hindu Tradition|last=Babb|first=Lawrence A.|publisher=University of California Press|year=1991|isbn=0-520-07636-2|location=|page=166|quote=His present incarnation, he says, ... He will die at the age of ninety-six, but his body will stay young until then.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After he died, some devotees suggested that he was referring to that many [[lunar calendar|lunar years]], as counted by Telugu-speaking Hindus, rather than [[tropical year|solar years]],&lt;ref&gt;Mohammed Shafeeq. However it was soon  clearly shown that the lunar reckoning does not work.  Post.

Prasad, Malayalam Daily. Kerala, India: 25 April 2011. "What Baba has foretold was indeed correct. According to the Roman calendar he has completed 85 years. But one can note that generally in all of Baba's discourses Baba had been referring to the star (lunar) basis in calculations. In Indian astrology there are 27 stars in a month starting with Aswathy and ending with Revathy. Accordingly a year of 12 months is composed of 324 days. Sai Baba was born on 23 November 1925. From that day till his death day 24 April 2011 there were a total of 33,899 days. If this is divided with 324, we get 95 years and 54 days. Accordingly, under the star basis of calculation he was in his 96th year having completed 54 days when he left his physical body."&lt;/ref&gt; Other devotees have spoken of his anticipated [[resurrection]], [[reincarnation]] or [[wakefulness|awakening]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Hindustan Times'', New Delhi: 25 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Narayan |first1=Sreejith |title=Sai, Thy Kingdom Come | year = 2012| isbn = 978-1-62314-842-3 | url =http://www.saikingdom.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 June 2011, officials from the Sri Sathya Sai Central Trust (founded as a charitable Trust in India, and legally separate from religious activities),&lt;ref&gt;Radio Sai's E-Journal.

The cash was deposited into the Sai Trust's account at the State Bank of India with payment of government taxes (thus transferring them from religious gifts to Trust assets.) The gold and other items were inventoried, assessed, and placed in secure storage. In July, district authorities inventoried an additional Rs 7.7&amp;nbsp;million (US$0.17m) in valuables in another 4 rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-07-03/india/29733031_1_satya-sai-baba-precious-metals-diamond-ring |title=Assets worth Rs 77L seized at Sai ashram | newspaper=Times of India | date=3 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total value of these items is believed to exceed 7.8 million US dollars.&lt;ref name="hindustan times"&gt;{{cite news|title=Treasure island: Sai Baba's gold trove|publisher=[[Press Trust of India]]|date=17 June 2011|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Treasure-island-Sai-Baba-s-gold-trove/Article1-710596.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release of will==

On 2 September 2012, Satyajit Salian, a close aide of Sri Sathya Sai Baba, released to the media a declaration made by Sai Baba, and registered on 23 March 1967, in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] saying his relatives had no authority over the Sathya Sai Trust assets. The exact text of the declaration was:

{{quote|I, Sri Sathya Sai of Parshanthi Nilayam P.O. Indian Inhabitant hereby declare as follows:-

The Sathya Sai Organisation (or Sri Sathya Sai [[Selfless service|Seva]] Organization) was founded in the 1960s by Sai Baba.&lt;ref name="srisaiorg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srisathyasai.org.in/Pages/Sai_Organisations/Sai_Organisations.htm|title=SSSCT- Sri Sathya Sai Seva Organisation|work=srisathyasai.org.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Sai Centres were started in India under the name of the "Sri Sathya Sai Seva Samithi".&lt;ref name="saiindia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saibabaofindia.com/sai_baba_centers.htm|title=Sai Baba Of India-Sri Sathya Sai Baba Centers- Sai Baba organisation worldwide|work=saibabaofindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Sathya Sai Organisation originated "to enable its members to undertake service activities as a means to spiritual advancement."&lt;ref name="srisaiorg"/&gt; The official mission of the Sathya Sai Organization is "to help its members realize the innate divinity within".

The Sathya Sai Organisation publishes an official monthly magazine named ''[[Sanathana Sarathi (magazine)|Sanathana Sarathi]]'', published by the Sri Sathya Sai Books and Publications Trust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sanathana-Sarathi-(magazine) Sanathana Sarathi magazine: Latest News, Videos and Photos of Sanathana Sarathi magazine]. Times of India.&lt;/ref&gt; The English translation of the word Sanathana Sarathi means 'Eternal Charioteer'.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Sai Baba stated that the main objective of the Sathya Sai Organisation "is to help man recognize the divinity that is inherent in him. So, your duty is to emphasize the One, to experience the One in all you do or speak. Do not give any importance to differences of religion or sect or status or colour. Have the feeling of one-ness permeate every act of yours. Only those who do so have a place in this Organization; the rest can withdraw."&lt;ref&gt;Sathya Sai Baba Sathya Sai Speaks IX, 35, 187–188 (old edition)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sathyasai-se.org/|title=Sathya Sai Baba Avatar Sweden Sverige|work=sathyasai-se.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Telugu-Ganga Project'''

The Telugu-Ganga project is a water supply scheme implemented by [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[India]] to provide drinking water to [[Chennai]] city in [[Tamil Nadu]]. The source of water is the river Krishna in Andhra Pradesh and the Poondi reservoir near Chennai is the destination with water planned to be routed through a series of interlinked canals.

The water initially supplied by the canal was disappointing, delivering less than 500 million cubic feet (14×10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). In 2002, Sri Sathya Sai Baba announced a scheme of restoration and lining of the canal; as his own undertaking. With an extensive rebuilding of the canal and several reservoirs, the project was completed in 2004, when Poondi reservoir received Krishna water for the first time.&lt;sup&gt;[[Telugu Ganga project#cite note-2|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt; The supply of water to Chennai city in 2006 was 3.7 billion cubic feet (100×10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;sup&gt;[[Telugu Ganga project#cite note-3|[3]]]&lt;/sup&gt; After the re-lining and reconstruction, the Kandaleru-Poondi part of the canal was renamed Sai Ganga.&lt;sup&gt;[[Telugu Ganga project#cite note-4|[4]]][[Telugu Ganga project#cite note-5|[5]]][[Telugu Ganga project#cite note-6|[6]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Sai Baba resided much of the time in his main [[ashram]], ''Prashanthi Nilayam'' (Abode of Highest Peace), at Puttaparthi. In the summer he often left for his other ashram, ''Brindavan'', in Kadugodi, [[Whitefield, India|Whitefield]], a town on the outskirts of [[Bangalore]]. Occasionally he visited his Sai Shruti ashram in [[Kodaikanal]].&lt;ref&gt;The ashrams of Sathya Sai Baba. Referenced from the official Sathya Sai Organization website, [http://www.sathyasai.org/ashrams/content.html Available online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sathyam, Shivam, Sundaram===
Sai Baba established three primary [[Hindu temple|mandirs]] (spiritual centres) in India. The first mandir, founded in [[Mumbai]] in 1968, is referred to as either the "Dharmakshetra" or "Sathyam". The second centre, established in [[Hyderabad (India)|Hyderabad]] in 1973, is referred to as "Shivam". The third, inaugurated on 19 January 1981 in [[Chennai]], is called "Sundaram".&lt;ref name="Official"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.radiosai.org/Journals/Vol_04/01MAR06/coverstory_sundaram.htm |title=Sathyam, Shivam and Sundaram Mandirs |work=media.radiosai.org |date=1 March 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413132444/http://media.radiosai.org/journals/Vol_04/01MAR06/coverstory_sundaram.htm |archivedate=13 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed |date=October 2013}}
The Dharmakshetra was established on the occasion of the first world conference (of SSSO).&lt;ref name="dharmakshetra.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dharmakshetra Website, Sri Sathya Sai Organization Mumbai — About Dharmakshetra|url=http://www.dharmakshetra.org/about-dharmakshetra|website=www.dharmakshetra.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many people from various of parts of the world attended the conference which was held at Bharatiya vidya Bhavan campus at versova, Bombay. It consists of various service centers for devotees like a hospital and eye care center. The educational center consists of various training centers. As a part of Bal Vikas the technical training is provided freely to the children from poor backgrounds by the youth wing of the organization.&lt;ref name="dharmakshetra.org"/&gt;

Followers believed in seeking the spiritual benefit of Sai Baba's ''[[darsana|darshan]]'', scheduled for morning and afternoon each day. Sai Baba would interact with people, accept letters, materialise and distribute [[vibhuti]] (sacred ash) or call groups or individuals for interviews. Devotees considered it a great privilege to have an interview and sometimes a single person, group or family was invited for a private interview for answers to spiritual questions and general guidance.&lt;ref name="kent"/&gt;

Accusations&lt;!-- Please do not change this wording, this has been agreed on the talk page.

In 1972 [[Abraham Kovoor]] made the first public criticism of Sai Baba&lt;ref name="srisathyasaibabaandthepress"&gt;Ruhela S.P., ''Sri Sathya Sai Baba and the Press'', pp. 1–5, 1997 {{ISBN|81-7533-041-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he looked into a claim publicly narrated by one devotee&lt;ref name="srisathyasaibabaandthepress" /&gt; that Sai Baba had created a new model of a [[Seiko]] watch, and found the claim to be untrue.&lt;ref name="sathyasaibabasgrace"&gt;Ruhela S.P., ''How to Receive Sri Sathya Sai Baba's Grace'', pp. 277, 2006 {{ISBN|81-7182-089-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OutlookSingh&gt;{{cite web|title=The Spell Breaker|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?262445|publisher=Outlook|accessdate=16 October 2013|author=Rahul Singh|date=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1976, [[Hosur Narasimhaiah|Hossur Narasimhaiah]], a physicist, rationalist and then vice-chancellor of [[Bangalore University]], founded and chaired a committee "to rationally and scientifically investigate miracles and other verifiable superstitions". Narasimhaiah wrote Sai Baba three widely publicised letters challenging him to perform his miracles under controlled conditions. The letters were ignored.&lt;ref name="haraldsson204"&gt;Haraldson, ''op. cit'', pp&amp;nbsp;204–205&lt;/ref&gt; Sai Baba said that he ignored Narasimhaiah's challenge because he felt his approach was improper, adding that "Science must confine its inquiry only to things belonging to the human senses, while spiritualism transcends the senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Satya Sai Baba and His Miracles|publisher=The Chakra|url=http://www.chakranews.com/satya-sai-baba-and-his-miracles/3543}}&lt;/ref&gt; If you want to understand the nature of spiritual power you can do so only through the path of spirituality and not science.

According to [[Erlendur Haraldsson]], the committee's formal challenge came to a dead end because of its negative attitude and perhaps because of the fanfare surrounding it. Narasimhaiah held the fact that  Sai Baba ignored his letters to be one of several indications that his miracles were fraudulent.&lt;ref&gt;Haraldsson, pp 209&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this episode, a public debate raged for several months in Indian newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Haraldsson, ''op. cit.'', pp. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian rationalist [[Basava Premanand]], who began campaigning against Sai Baba in 1976, unsuccessfully attempted to sue him in 1986 for violations of the [[Gold Control Act]], citing Sai Baba's purported materialisations of gold objects. When the case was dismissed, Premanand unsuccessfully appealed on the grounds that claimed spiritual power is not a defence recognised in law.&lt;ref name=bbca1&gt;{{cite news|author=Tanya Datta|title=Sai Baba: Goan or con man?|date=17 June 2004|work=[[BBC News]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/3813469.stm | accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1995 TV documentary ''Guru Busters'', produced by filmmaker [[Robert Eagle (writer and director)|Robert Eagle]] for the UK's [[Channel 4]], accused Sai Baba of faking his materialisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eagletv.co.uk/home/guru.htm |title=Eagle &amp; Eagle |publisher=Eagletv.co.uk |date= |accessdate=7 January 2010}} [http://www.eagletv.co.uk/home/videos/Saimagic.mov Clip]&lt;/ref&gt; The clip from the film was mentioned in the ''[[Deccan Chronicle]]'', on 23 November 1992, in a front-page headline "DD Tape Unveils Baba Magic".&lt;ref&gt;Haraldsson, ''op. cit.'', pp.&amp;nbsp;295–301&lt;/ref&gt; But Haraldsson stated that, on investigating the DD video, researchers did not find evidence of fake materialisation. According to Haraldsson, the video was taken to a company that investigates corporate fraud, which found that it did not provide firm evidence of sleight of hand.&lt;ref&gt;Haraldsson, ''op. cit.'', pp 300, 295–301&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, British journalist Mick Brown stated in his book ''The Spiritual Tourist'' that in his opinion claims of Sai Baba resurrecting American devotee Walter Cowan in 1971 were probably untrue.&lt;ref name="spiritualtourist"&gt;Mick Brown, ''The Spiritual Tourist'', 1998, Bloomsbury Publishing, {{ISBN|1-58234-034-X}} "In the House of God", pp.&amp;nbsp;73–74&lt;/ref&gt; His opinion was based on letters from the attending doctors presented in the magazine ''[[Indian Skeptic]]'', published by Basava Premanand.&lt;ref name="spiritualtourist"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hislop, John S. ''My Baba and I'' 1985 published by Birth Day Publishing Company, San Diego, California {{ISBN|0-9600958-8-8}}, "The Resurrection of Walter Cowan", pages&amp;nbsp;28–31&lt;/ref&gt; Brown also related, in the same book, his experiences with manifestations of ''vibuthi'' from Sai Baba's pictures in houses in London, which he felt were not fraudulent or the result of trickery.&lt;ref name="touristmiracle"&gt;Brown Mick, ''The Spiritual Tourist'', "The Miracle in North London", pp.&amp;nbsp;29–30, 1998 {{ISBN|158234034X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown wrote with regards to Sai Baba's claims of omniscience, that "sceptics have produced documentation clearly showing discrepancies between Baba's reading of historical events and biblical prophecies, and the established accounts."&lt;ref name="spiritualtourist"/&gt;

===Claims of sexual abuse===
In January 2002, a documentary produced by Denmark's national television and radio broadcast company, [[Danish radio|Danmarks Radio]] (DR), named ''Seduced By Sai Baba'', analysed videos of public manifestations of Sai Baba, and suggested that they could be explained as [[sleight of hand]].&lt;ref name="seduced"&gt;{{cite video|people=Øyvind Kyrø, Steen Jensen |title=Seduced by Sai Baba |medium=Documentary |publisher=[[DR (broadcaster)|DR]] |date=2002 |time= |url=http://dr.dk/Salg/DRsales/Programmes/Documentary/Society_and_Social/20070629133445_3_1_3_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204010039/http://www.dr.dk/Salg/DRsales/Programmes/Documentary/Society_and_Social/20070629133445_3_1_3_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1.htm |archivedate=4 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary also presented interviews with Alaya Rahm, former devotee of the cult, where he alleged sexual abuse by Sai Baba.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt; As a result, in 2002 the Parliament of the United Kingdom discussed the possible danger to male children of British families intending to visit the ashram of Sathya Sai Baba in case of individual audiences with the guru.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2001-02/886] UK Parliament official web site&lt;/ref&gt;

Premanand stated in the documentary that, in his opinion, Sai Baba faked his materialisations. Here, he claimed that Sai Baba was "not just a fraud, but a dangerous sexual abuser". According to his interview, he had stories which spanned 30 years, and he stated that his stories were similar, a common practice being the rubbing of genitals with oil by the spiritual leader. Among his claims were that one ex-devotee claimed Sai Baba "put the oil on his hands, told me to drop my pants and rubbed my genitals with the oil". Premanand theorised that many Indian boys were abused but were never heard from because they were too afraid to speak out, alleging Sai Baba was well-connected with the elite and powerful of India.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

===Responses===
Sai Baba and his followers reject any allegations of misconduct.&lt;ref name=funeral/&gt; Devotee [[Bill Aitken (traveller)|Bill Aitken]] was quoted by ''[[The Week]]'' as saying that Sai Baba's reputation had not been harmed by the negative stories published about him.

In the article ''Divine Downfall'', published in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', Anil Kumar, the ex-principal of the Sathya Sai Educational Institute, said that he believed that the controversy was part of Baba's divine plan and that all great religious teachers had to face criticism during their lives. Anil Kumar also said that allegations had been levelled at Sai Baba since childhood, but with every criticism he had become more and more triumphant.&lt;ref name="divine"&gt;Brown, Mick (28 October 2000). "Divine Downfall". Daily Telegraph.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Redemptive Encounters: Three Modern Styles in the Hindu Tradition'', Lawrence A. Babb wrote of Sai Baba, "Whoever he is, he is certainly more than the mere parlour magician many of his critics claim that he is."&lt;ref name="BabbLawrence"/&gt;

Sai Baba publicly responded to the allegations on 25 December 2000:
{{quote|Some people out of their mean-mindedness are trying to tarnish the image of Sai Baba. I am not after name and fame. So, I do not lose anything by their false allegations. My glory will go on increasing day by day. It will never diminish even a bit if they were to publicise their false allegations in the whole world in bold letters. Some devotees seem to be perturbed over these false statements. They are not true devotees at all. Having known the mighty power of Sai, why should they be afraid of the 'cawing of crows'? One should not get carried away by all that is written on walls, said in political meetings or the vulgar tales carried by the print media.&lt;ref&gt;Sathya Sai Speaks Vol.33, pg.389&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''[[The Times of India]]'' on 26 December 2000 quoted Sai Baba as saying: {{quote|[[Jesus Christ]] underwent many hardships, and was put to the cross because of jealousy. Many around him could not bear the good work he did and the large number of followers he gathered. One of his disciples, [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]], betrayed him. In those days there was one Judas, but today there are thousands. Just as that Judas was tempted to betray Jesus, the Judases of today, too, are bought out to lie. Jealousy was the motive behind the allegations levelled at him.&lt;ref&gt;Rao, Manu (26 December 2000), Sai Baba lashes out at detractors http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bangalore/sai-baba-lashes-out-at-detractors/articleshow/534425761.cms&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In an official letter made public in December 2001, [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] (then [[Prime Minister of India]] and a devotee of Sai Baba),&lt;ref name=Palmer97-98 /&gt; [[P. N. Bhagwati|P.N. Bhagwati]] (Former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India), [[Ranganath Misra]] (Chair Person, National Human Rights Commissioner of India and Former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India), [[Najma Heptulla]] (President of the Inter-Parliamentary Union; UNDP Distinguished Human Development Ambassador) and [[Shivraj V. Patil|Shivraj Patil]] (Member of Parliament, India; Formerly of the Lok Sabha &amp; Union Minister) all signed the following statement:

{{quote|We are deeply pained and anguished by the wild, reckless and concocted allegations made by certain vested interests and people against Bhagwan Sri Sathya Sai Baba.

The group '''Science, Reason and Faith''' ('''CRYF''', standing for '''Ciencia, Razón y Fe''' in Spanish) is formed by teachers at the [[University of Navarra]]. Its purpose is to promote the interdisciplinary study of issues related to science, philosophy and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Udías Vallina, Agustín (2010). Ciencia y religión: dos visiones del mundo. Sal Terrae. p. 16. (In Spanish.)&lt;/ref&gt; The activities of the group cover three closely related areas: research, teaching and public engagement.

==History of the group==
The beginning of the CRYF group dates back to the informal conversations that, at the end of the 20th century, professors [[Mariano Artigas]] († 2006) and [[Carlos Pérez (academic)|Carlos Pérez]] († 2005) maintained about interdisciplinary questions and public debates concerning the relationship between science and faith.

In 2002, circumstances were favorable for the creation of the group. Its founding members were professors Mariano Artigas, Juan Luis Lorda, Antonio Pardo, Carlos Perez, Francisco Gallardo and Santiago Collado. Since its inception, in addition to other teachers from the University of Navarra, the group has incorporated prestigious intellectuals and experts on the topics of interest as collaborating members: Evandro Agazzi, William Shea, Juan Arana and Tito Arecchi are some of the present collaborators.

Professor Artigas was appointed the first director of the group, a position he held until his death. The contribution of his intellectual output, which the group has inherited as his legacy, could be summarized as having contributed to unify and highlight the relationship between science and religion. In this endeavor, it is important not to reduce thought to mere scientific rationality, where science is understood as empirical or experimental science. The name of the group expresses this conviction: science, reason and faith. The CRYF is currently considered one of the centers that has contributed most to explore the common ground shared by science, philosophy and theology in southern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oviedo|first1=Lluis|last2=Garre|first2=Álvaro|title=The Interaction between Religion and Science in Catholic Southern Europe (Italy, Spain and Portugal)|journal=Zygon L|date=2015|volume=1|pages=172-193|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/zygo.12159/full|archivedate=11 February 2017|deadurl=yes|df=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211075232/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/zygo.12159/full}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The CRYF has received funding from the [[Templeton Foundation]] twice. In 2006, for the project entitled "The Human Singularity: The Origin, Nature, and Destiny of the Human Being" and in 2011, in order to set up the "Mariano Artigas Memorial Lectures".&lt;ref&gt;José M. Gimenez-Amaya - Santiago Collado (2011-2014). «Mariano Artigas Memorial Lecture (MAML)». &lt;/ref&gt;  The Mariano Artigas Lectures are held every two years in October and have a two-fold purpose: to honor the figure of Professor Artigas and to recognize the work done by the invited lecturer in the field of the relations between science and religion. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Science, Reason and Faith Group|first1=|last2=John Templeton Foundation|first2=|title=Mariano Artigas Memorial Lecture|date=2011-2017|publisher=[[John Templeton Foundation]] |isbn=|url=http://www.unav.edu/web/ciencia-razon-y-fe/mariano-artigas-memorial-lecture|language=English|ref=harv}}{{dead link|date=April 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous speakers have been William Shea in 2011, Karl Giberson in 2013 and Giuseppe Tanzella-Nitti in 2015. In 2017, the Lecture was entrusted to Spanish philosopher Juan Arana.

At the beginning of 2007, after the death of Mariano Artigas, the professor of Physics, [[Héctor Mancini]] replaced him as head of the group until the beginning of 2010. During the period 2010-2016 the director was the [[neuroscientist]], philosopher and priest [[José Manuel Giménez Amaya]]. Since the beginning of 2016, this position is held by the physicist, theologian and priest [[Javier Sánchez Cañizares]].

==Interests and objectives==
Broadly speaking, the CRYF group is interested in discussing the big issues from the perspective of the dialogue between science, reason and faith. Specifically, the main topics of interest are the following:
* [[Origin of man]], [[origin of life]] and [[origin of the universe]]
* Nature and causes of [[evolution]]
* [[Mind#Relation to the brain|Mind-brain relationship]]
* Relations between science and truth
* Relations between science and religion
* Order, [[complexity]] and [[purpose]]
* Classic [[science-faith debates]] ([[Galileo case]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Artigas|first1=Mariano|last2=Shea|first2=William R.|title=Galileo Observed. Science and the Politics of Belief|date=2006|publisher=Science History Publications|isbn=9780881353563|url=|language=English|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and current ones ([[creationism]] and [[evolutionism]])
More specific goals of the group are: to promote among its members research and publications on the topics of interest; to develop lessons and teaching materials for intra- and extra-mural education; to make available, through the Internet, an archive of documents on the areas of interest that could be useful as teaching material and for outreach activities; and to promote the organization of activities, collaborations and scientific meetings that can help achieve the goals of the group.

==Activities and some outcomes==
The CRYF group organizes monthly open seminars with invited speakers, followed by a discussion in which academics from various areas of expertise (such as theology, physics, medicine, philosophy and biology) exchange ideas and opinions. These seminars may also have the format of a round table or a workshop, and they are uploaded to the YouTube channel of the University of Navarra. One activity that deserves special mention was the workshop organized by the CRYF in collaboration with the "Thomas More Institute"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.netherhall.org.uk/node/53|title=Thomas More Institute|publisher=Netherhall Educational Association|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of London in 2009, to study the contributions of Mariano Artigas. The presentations of that meeting were later collected and published in the book "Science and Faith Within Reason". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Navarro|first1=Jaume|title=Science and Faith within Reason: Reality, Creation, Life and Design|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781138268630|url=https://www.routledge.com/Science-and-Faith-within-Reason-Reality-Creation-Life-and-Design/Navarro/p/book/9781409426080|language=English|ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In collaboration with the [[Nicolaus Copernicus University]] of Torun (Poland), the CRYF group publishes the interdisciplinary scientific journal "Scientia et Fides" twice a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apcz.umk.pl/czasopisma/index.php/SetF/index|title=Scientia et Fides|publisher=Wydział Teologiczny UMK|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This peer-reviewed open-access magazine publishes original articles addressing in a rigorous way the relationships between science and religion from different perspectives. The second issue of 2016 was a special number commemorating the tenth anniversary of the death of Mariano Artigas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=|first1=|title=10th anniversary of Mariano Artigas' death|journal=Scientia et Fides|date=2016|volume=IV (2)|pages=538|url=http://apcz.umk.pl/czasopisma/index.php/SetF/issue/view/981|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to teaching, the CRYF group teaches three courses on issues related to science and religion at the University of Navarra. It also collaborates regularly with the Higher Institute of Religious Sciences of the same University. The members of the CRYF are available to give seminars or conferences on the topics of interest to any institution requesting it. Several schools, cultural foundations and universities across Spain, Europe and Latin America have already benefited from this collaboration.

'''Scrupulosity''' is characterized by pathological guilt about moral or religious issues. It is personally distressing, objectively dysfunctional, and often accompanied by significant impairment in social functioning.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt;&lt;ref name="linkinghub.elsevier.com"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Scrupulosity: A cognitive–behavioral analysis and implications for treatment|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211364914000116?via=sd|accessdate = 2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically conceptualized as a moral or religious form of [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD),&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Deacon B, Nelson EA |title=On the nature and treatment of scrupulosity |journal=Pragmatic Case Stud Psychother |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=39–53 |year=2008 |url=http://jrul.libraries.rutgers.edu/index.php/pcsp/article/view/932/2329 |format=PDF |doi=10.14713/pcsp.v4i2.932}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this categorization is empirically disputable.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt;

The term is derived from the Latin ''scrupulum'', a sharp stone, implying a stabbing pain on the [[conscience]].&lt;ref name="Miller-Hedges"&gt;{{vcite journal |author = Miller CH, Hedges DW|title = Scrupulosity disorder: an overview and introductory analysis|journal = J Anxiety Disord|volume = 22|issue = 6|pages = 1042–58|year = 2008|pmid = 18226490|doi = 10.1016/j.janxdis.2007.11.004}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Scrupulosity was formerly called ''scruples'' in religious contexts, but the word ''[[Scruples (disambiguation)|scruples]]'' now commonly refers to a troubling of the [[conscience]] rather than to the disorder.

As a personality trait, scrupulosity is a recognized diagnostic criterion for [[obsessive–compulsive personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition=4th, text revision ([[DSM-IV-TR]]) |author=American Psychiatric Association |year=2000 |isbn=0-89042-025-4 |chapter=Diagnostic criteria for 301.4 Obsessive–compulsive personality disorder |chapterurl=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/o-cpd.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes called "scrupulousness", but that word properly applies to the positive trait of having scruples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scrupulous |url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/scrupulous |website=Dictionary.com |accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scrupulosity is a modern-day psychological problem that echoes a traditional use of the term ''scruples'' in a religious context, e.g. by [[Roman Catholic]]s, to mean obsessive concern with one's own sins and compulsive performance of religious devotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author=Ciarrocchi JW |date=1995 |title=The Doubting Disease: Help for Scrupulosity and Religious Compulsions |location=Mahwah, NJ |publisher=Paulist Press |isbn=0-8091-3553-1 |ref=Doubting }} Scruples: common and uncommon. p. 32–47.&lt;/ref&gt; This use of the term dates to the 12th century.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Taylor CZ |title=Religious addiction: obsession with spirituality |journal=Pastoral Psych |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=291–315 |doi=10.1023/A:1014074130084 |date=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several historical and religious figures suffered from doubts of sin, and expressed their pains. [[Ignatius of Loyola]], founder of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], wrote "After I have trodden upon a cross formed by two straws&amp;nbsp;... there comes to me from without a thought that I have sinned&amp;nbsp;... this is probably a scruple and temptation suggested by the enemy."&lt;ref name=van-Megen&gt;{{vcite book |chapter=Obsessive compulsive disorder and religion: a reconnaissance |author=van Megen HJGM, den Boer-Wolters D, Verhagen PJ |pages=271–82 |title=Religion and Psychiatry: Beyond Boundaries |editor=Verhagen P, Van Praag HM, López-Ibor JJ Jr, Cox J, Moussaoui D, editors |isbn=978-0-470-69471-8 |publisher=Wiley |date=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alphonsus Liguori]], the [[Redemptorists]]' founder, wrote of it as "groundless fear of sinning that arises from 'erroneous ideas'".&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; Although the condition was lifelong for Loyola and Liguori,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author=Rose S |date=2007 |title=St. Ignatius Loyola And The Early Jesuits |isbn=1-4086-2255-6 |chapter=Manresa—the spiritual exercises—1523 |pages=45–71 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author=Alphonsus de Liguori |editor=Jones FM, editor and translator |date=1999 |title=Selected Writings |location=Mahwah, NJ |publisher=Paulist Press |chapter=Peace for scrupulous souls |pages=209–18 |isbn=0-8091-3771-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thérèse of Lisieux]] stated that she recovered from her condition after 18 months, writing "One would have to pass through this martyrdom to understand it well, and for me to express what I experienced for a year and a half would be impossible."&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author=Monahan J |date=2003 |title=Thérèse of Lisieux |page=45 |isbn=0-8091-6710-7 |publisher=Paulist Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther]] also suffered from obsessive doubts; in his mind, his omitting the word ''enim'' ("for") during the [[Eucharist]] was as horrible as laziness, divorce, or murdering one's parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author=Aho JA |date=2005 |title=Confession and Bookkeeping: the Religious, Moral, and Rhetorical Roots of Modern Accounting |location=Albany |publisher=State University of New York Press |chapter=Martin Luther and scrupulosity |pages=95–8 |isbn=0-7914-6545-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although historical religious figures such as Loyola, Luther and [[John Bunyan]] are commonly cited as examples of scrupulosity in modern self-help books, some of these retrospective diagnoses may be deeply ahistorical: these figures' obsession with salvation may have been excessive by modern standards, but that does not mean that it was pathological.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Cefalu P |title=The doubting disease: religious scrupulosity and obsessive–compulsive disorder in historical context |journal=J Med Humanit  |year=2010 |pmid=20127153 |doi=10.1007/s10912-010-9107-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scrupulosity's first known public description as a disorder was in 1691, by [[John Moore (Bishop of Ely)|John Moore]], who called it "religious melancholy" and said it made people "fear, that what they do, is so defective and unfit to be presented unto God, that he will not accept it".&lt;ref name=Lopez-Ibor&gt;{{vcite book |chapterurl=http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/18/04706947/0470694718-2.pdf |chapterformat=PDF |chapter=Religious experience and psychopathology |author=López-Ibor JJ Jr, López-Ibor Alcocer MI |pages=211–33 |title=Religion and Psychiatry: Beyond Boundaries |editor=Verhagen P, Van Praag HM, López-Ibor JJ Jr, Cox J, Moussaoui D, editors |isbn=978-0-470-69471-8 |publisher=Wiley |date=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Loyola, Liguori, the French confessor [[R.P. Duguet]], and other religious authorities and figures attempted to develop solutions and coping mechanisms;&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt; the monthly newsletter ''[[Scrupulous Anonymous]]'', published by the followers of Liguori, has been used as an adjunct to therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author=Ciarrocchi |title=[[#Doubting|The Doubting Disease]] |chapter=Getting help for scruples and OCD |pages=103–12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, Christian spiritual advisors in the U.S. and Britain became worried that scrupulosity was not only a sin in itself, but also led to sin, by attacking the virtues of faith, hope, and charity. Studies in the mid-20th century reported that scrupulosity was a major problem among American Catholics, with up to 25&amp;nbsp;per cent of high school students affected; commentators at the time asserted that this was an increase over previous levels.&lt;ref name=Bourke/&gt;

Starting in the 20th century, individuals with scrupulosity in the U.S. and Britain increasingly began looking to psychiatrists, rather than to religious advisors, for help with the condition.&lt;ref name=Bourke&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Bourke J |title=Divine madness: the dilemma of religious scruples in twentieth-century America and Britain |journal=J Soc Hist |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=581–603 |date=2009 |doi=10.1353/jsh.0.0152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This part needs more work.--&gt;

== Characteristics ==

In scrupulosity, a person's obsessions focus on moral or religious fears, such as the fear of being an evil person or the fear of divine retribution for sin. Although it can affect nonreligious people, it is usually related to religious beliefs. In the strict sense, not all obsessive–compulsive behaviors related to religion are instances of scrupulosity: strictly speaking, for example, scrupulosity is not present in people who repeat religious requirements merely to be sure that they were done properly.&lt;ref name=Huppert&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Huppert JD, Siev J, Kushner ES |title=When religion and obsessive–compulsive disorder collide: treating scrupulosity in Ultra-Orthodox Jews |journal=J Clin Psychol |volume=63 |issue=10 |pages=925–41 |date=2007 |pmid=17828763 |doi=10.1002/jclp.20404 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==

Treatment is similar to that for other forms of obsessive–compulsive disorder.&lt;ref name=Abramowitz/&gt; [[Exposure and response prevention]] (ERP), a form of behavior therapy, is widely used for OCD in general and may be promising for scrupulosity in particular.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt;&lt;ref name="linkinghub.elsevier.com"/&gt; ERP is based on the idea that deliberate repeated exposure to obsessional stimuli lessens anxiety, and that avoiding rituals lowers the urge to behave compulsively. For example, with ERP a person [[Intrusive thought#Blasphemous religious thoughts|obsessed by blasphemous thoughts]] while reading the Bible would practice reading the Bible.&lt;ref name=Abramowitz&gt;{{vcite book |editor=Abramowitz JS, McKay D, Taylor S |title=Clinical Handbook of Obsessive–Compulsive Disorder and Related Problems |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |date=2008 |isbn=0-8018-8697-X |chapter=Scrupulosity |author=Abramowitz JS |pages=156–72 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Exposure Therapy for Anxiety: Principles and Practice|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pnoznH2c7esC|publisher = Guilford Press|date = 2011-03-14|isbn = 9781609180171|language = en|first = Jonathan S.|last = Abramowitz|first2 = Brett J.|last2 = Deacon|first3 = Stephen P. H.|last3 = Whiteside}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ERP is considerably harder to implement than with other disorders, because scrupulosity often involves spiritual issues that are not specific situations and objects. For example, ERP is not appropriate for a man obsessed by feelings that God has rejected and is punishing him. [[Cognitive therapy]] may be appropriate when ERP is not feasible.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt; Other therapy strategies include noting contradictions between the compulsive behaviors and moral or religious teachings, and informing individuals that for centuries religious figures have suggested strategies similar to ERP.&lt;ref name=Abramowitz/&gt; Religious counseling may be an additional way to readjust beliefs associated with the disorder, though it may also stimulate greater anxiety.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt;

Little evidence is available on the use of medications to treat scrupulosity.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt; Although [[serotonergic]] medications are often used to treat OCD,&lt;ref name=Abramowitz/&gt; studies of pharmacologic treatment of scrupulosity in particular have produced so few results that even tentative recommendations cannot be made.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt;

Treatment of scrupulosity in children has not been investigated to the extent it has been studied in adults, and one of the factors that makes the treatment difficult is the fine line the therapist must walk between engaging and offending the client.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |editor=McKay D, Storch EA, editors |date=2009 |title=Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Children: Treating Complex and Refractory Cases |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-8261-1686-8 |author=McKay D, Storch EA, Nelson B, Morales M, Moretz MW |chapter=Obsessive–compulsive disorder in children and adolescents: treating difficult cases |pages=81–114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epidemiology ==

The [[prevalence]] of scrupulosity is speculative. Available data do not permit reliable estimates, and available analyses mostly disregard associations with age or with gender, and have not reliably addressed associations with geography or ethnicity.&lt;ref name=Miller-Hedges/&gt; Available data suggest that the [[prevalence]] of obsessive–compulsive disorder does not differ by culture, except where prevalence rates differ for all psychiatric disorders. No association between OCD and depth of religious beliefs has been demonstrated, although data are scarce.&lt;ref name=Huppert/&gt; There are large regional differences in the percentage of OCD patients who have religious obsessions or compulsions, ranging from 0–7% in countries like the U.K. and Singapore, to 40–60% in traditional Muslim and orthodox Jewish populations.&lt;ref name=van-Megen/&gt;

[[File:Physical examination.jpg|thumb|A medical examination]]
Some religions claim that praying for somebody who is sick can have positive effects on the health of the person being prayed for.

[[meta-study|Meta-studies]] of the literature in the field have been performed showing evidence only for no effect or a potentially small effect. For instance, a 2006 meta analysis on 14 studies concluded that there is "no discernible effect" while a 2007 systemic review of intercessory prayer reported inconclusive results, noting that 7 of 17 studies had "small, but significant, effect sizes" but the review noted that the most methodologically rigorous studies failed to produce significant findings.&lt;ref name=Masters /&gt;&lt;ref name=DRHodge /&gt;

==Introduction==
In comparison to other fields that have been scientifically studied, carefully monitored studies of prayer are relatively few. The field remains tiny, with about $5 million spent worldwide on such research. If and when more studies of prayer are done, the issue of prayer's efficacy may be further clarified.&lt;ref name="WashPostOne"&gt;Boorstein, Michelle. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/05/AR2008120502813.html Researchers Stepping Up Study of Health And Religiosity], ''[[Washington Post]]'', 6 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third party studies discussed here have all been performed using Christian prayers. Some have reported [[null results]], some have reported correlations between prayer and health, and some have reported contradictory results in which beneficiaries of prayer had worsened health outcomes. The parameters used within the study designs have varied, for instance, daily or weekly prayers, whether to provide patient photographs, with full or partial names, measuring levels of belief in prayer, and whether patients underwent surgery.

==Studies==

===Galton===
In 1872, the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] scientist [[Francis Galton]] made the first [[statistics|statistical analysis]] of third-party prayer. He hypothesized, partly as satire, that if prayer were effective, members of the [[British Royal Family]] would live longer than average, given that thousands prayed for their well-being every Sunday, and he prayed over randomized plots of land to see whether the plants would grow any faster, and found no correlation in either case.&lt;ref name="galton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dawkins"/&gt;

===Byrd and Harris===
A 1988 study by Randolph C. Byrd used 393 patients at the [[San Francisco General Hospital]] [[Coronary care unit|coronary care unit (CCU)]]. Measuring 29 health outcomes using three-level (good, intermediate, or bad) scoring, the prayer group suffered fewer newly diagnosed ailments on only six of them. Byrd concluded that "Based on these data there seemed to be an effect, and that effect was presumed to be beneficial", and that "intercessory prayer to the Judeo-Christian God has a beneficial therapeutic effect in patients admitted to a CCU."&lt;ref name="Byrd"/&gt; The reaction from the scientific community concerning this study was mixed. Several reviewers considered Byrd’s study to be well-designed and well-executed,&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain and Hall 2001, 34&lt;/ref&gt; while others  remained skeptical.  A criticism of Byrd's study, which also applies to most other studies, is the fact that he did not limit prayers by the friends and family of patients, hence it is unclear which prayers, if any, may have been measured.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt;

The Byrd study had an inconsistent pattern of only six positive outcomes amongst 26 specific problem conditions. A systematic review suggested this indicates possible [[Type I and type II errors|Type I]] errors.&lt;ref name=DRHodge /&gt;

A 1999 follow-up by William S. Harris et al. attempted to replicate Byrd's findings under stricter experimental conditions, noting that the original research was not completely blinded and was limited to only "prayer-receptive" individuals (57 of the 450 patients invited to participate in the study refused to give consent "for personal reasons or religious convictions").&lt;ref name="HarrisGowdaKolb"/&gt;  Using a different, continuous weighted scoring system – which admittedly was, like Byrd's scoring, "an unvalidated measure of CCU outcomes" – Harris et al. concluded that "supplementary, remote, blinded, intercessory prayer produced a measurable improvement in the medical outcomes of critically ill patients", and suggested that "prayer be an
effective adjunct to standard medical care."&lt;ref&gt;Harris et al. 1999, 2273&lt;/ref&gt;  However, when they applied Byrd’s scores to their data, they could not document an effect of prayer using his scoring method. Critics have suggested that both Byrd's and Harris's results can be explained by chance.&lt;ref name="Tessman"/&gt; Richard P. Sloan compared the Byrd and Harris studies with the [[Texas sharpshooter fallacy|sharpshooter fallacy]], "searching through the data until a significant effect is found, then drawing the bull's-eye."&lt;ref name="Sloan"/&gt;

===O'Laoire===
A 1997 study by O'Laoire measured the effects on the agents performing daily prayers and reported benefits not only for the beneficiaries, but also for the agents, and the benefit levels correlated with the belief levels of agents and beneficiaries in some cases. The study measured [[anxiety]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. This study used beneficiary names as well as photographs.&lt;ref name="OLaoire"/&gt;

===Sicher===
In 1998 Fred Sicher et al. performed a small scale double-blind randomized study of 40 patients with advanced [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sicher|first=F|author2=Targ, E|author3= Moore D, 2nd |author4=Smith, HS|title=A randomized double-blind study of the effect of distant healing in a population with advanced AIDS. Report of a small scale study.|journal=The Western Journal of Medicine|date=December 1998|volume=169|issue=6|pages=356–63|pmid=9866433|pmc=1305403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lake112 &gt;''Textbook of Integrative Mental Health Care'' by James Lake 2006 {{ISBN|1-58890-299-4}} page 112&lt;/ref&gt; The patients were in category C-3 with [[CD4]] cell counts below 200 and each had at least one case of AIDS-defining illness.&lt;ref name=Scott259 &gt;''Handbook of Complementary and Alternative Therapies in Mental Health'' edited by Scott Shannon 2001 Academic Press {{ISBN|0-12-638281-6}} page 259&lt;/ref&gt; The patients were randomly assigned to receive distant intercessory healing or none at all. The intercession took place by people in different parts of the United States who never had any contact with the patients. Both patients and physicians were blind to who received or did not receive intercession.&lt;ref name=Scott259 /&gt; Six months later the prayer group had significantly fewer AIDS illnesses, less frequent doctor visits, and fewer days in the hospital.&lt;ref name=Lake112 /&gt; However, CD4 counts and scores on other [[physiology|physiological]] tests had no significant variation between the two groups of patients.&lt;ref name=Scott259 /&gt;

===Mayo clinic===
A 2001 double-blind study at the [[Mayo Clinic]] randomized 799 discharged coronary surgery patients into a [[Scientific control|control]] group and an intercessory prayer group, which received prayers at least once a week from 5 intercessors per patient. Analyzing "primary end points" (death, cardiac arrest, rehospitalization, etc.) after 26 weeks, the researchers concluded "intercessory prayer had no significant effect on medical outcomes after hospitalization in a coronary care unit."&lt;ref name="AvilesWhelanHernke"/&gt;

===The IVF-ET prayer scandal===
In 2001 the ''Journal of Reproductive Medicine'' published an experimental study by three [[Columbia University]] researchers indicating that prayer for women undergoing [[in vitro fertilization|''in vitro'' fertilization]]-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) resulted in a success rate (50%) of [[pregnancy]] double that of women who did not receive prayer.&lt;ref name="ChaWirthLobo"/&gt; [[Columbia University]] issued a news release saying that the study had been carefully designed to eliminate [[bias]].&lt;ref name="Eisner"/&gt;  The most vocal [[skeptic]] was [[Bruce Flamm]], a clinical professor of gynecology and obstetrics at the [[University of california|University of California at Irvine]], who found that the experimental procedures were flawed.&lt;ref name="FlammOne"/&gt;  One of the study's authors, Cha, responded to criticism of the study in the November 2004 issue of JRM.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reproductivemedicine.com/toc/auto_abstract.php?id=21868&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2001, the [[DHHS|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (DHHS)]] office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) confirmed a report by the Columbia University Health Sciences Division that one of the study’s authors, Rogerio Lobo, only learned of the study six to twelve months after the study was completed, and that he had only provided editorial assistance.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/detrm_letrs/dec01f.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The name of [[Columbia University]] and Lobo were retracted from the study.&lt;ref name="FlammThree"/&gt;

===Retroactive intercessory prayer===
A 2001 study by Leonard Leibovici used records of 3,393 patients who had developed blood infections at the [[Rabin Medical Center]] between 1990 and 1996 to study ''retroactive'' intercessory prayer.&lt;ref name="Leibovici"/&gt;  To compound the alleged miraculous power of prayer itself, the prayers were performed ''after'' the patients had already left the [[Rabin Medical Center|hospital]]. All 3,393 patients were those in the [[Rabin Medical Center|hospital]] between 1990 and 1996, and the prayers were conducted in 2000. Two of the outcomes, length of stay in the hospital and duration of fever, were found to be significantly improved in the intervention group, implying that prayer can even change events ''in the past.'' However, the "[[mortality rate]] was lower in the intervention group, but the difference between the groups was not significant."  Leibovici concluded that "Remote, retroactive intercessory prayer was associated with a shorter stay in hospital and a shorter duration of fever in patients with a bloodstream infection." Leibovici goes on to note that in the past, people knew the way to prevent diseases (he cites scurvy) without understanding why it worked.  In saying so, he suggests that if prayer truly does have a positive effect on patients in hospital, then there may be a naturalist explanation for it that we do not yet understand.  After many scientists and scholars criticized this retroactive study,&lt;ref name="Thornett"/&gt; Leibovici stated in 2002 that the "article has nothing to do with religion. I believe that prayer is a real comfort and help to a believer. I do not believe it should be tested in controlled trials."&lt;ref name = Lighthearted /&gt;  The study has been summarised as being "intended lightheartedly to illustrate the importance of asking research questions that fit with scientific models."&lt;ref name = Stenger /&gt;

In 2003, [[Larry Dossey]], the [[executive editor]] of the journal ''[[Explore: The Journal of Science &amp; Healing]]'' and an advocate of [[faith healing]]&lt;ref name = Gorski /&gt; co-authored a paper responding to Leibovici which discussed possible mechanisms to explain the results reported.&lt;ref name = BMJ_Dossey /&gt;  Olshansky and Dossey invoked quantum mechanics to explain not only the benefits of intercessory prayer, but also how it might operate retroactively,&lt;ref name = BMJ_Dossey /&gt; drawing strong criticisms from physicist [[Victor J. Stenger|Victor Stenger]] and physician [[Jeffrey Bishop]].&lt;ref name = Stenger /&gt; The [[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]] is regularly used to suggest that conscious control of physical reality is predicted by quantum mechanics, but this misconception "can be traced to a misinterpretation of [[particle-wave duality|wave-particle duality]]."&lt;ref name = Stenger /&gt;  In relation to [[backwards causation|backwards causality]], Stenger noted that "the results of some quantum experiments may be interpreted as evidence for events in the future affecting events in the past at the quantum level, [but] no theoretical basis exists for applying this notion on the macroscopic scale of human experience."&lt;ref name = Stenger /&gt;  He concluded that while "the atoms in biological systems are quantum in nature ... their collective behaviour does not exhibit any quantum effects. ... What is more, even if the brain were a quantum system, that would not imply that it can break the laws of physics any more than electrons or photons, which are inarguably quanta."&lt;ref name = Stenger /&gt;  One further point which illustrates that Dossey and Olshansky do not understand the physics they are using is seen in their invocation of [[quantum nonlocality]] in explaining backward causation, stating that "[r]etroactive prayer may be less absurd than [Leibovici] supposes, in the light of the discovery of non-local phenomena."&lt;ref name = BMJ_Dossey /&gt;  Unfortunately, the two are mutually incompatible: in allowing reverse causality in a model, the phenomenon of nonlocality ceases.&lt;ref name = Stenger /&gt;  Dossey has written in ''Explore'' about coining the term "nonlocal mind" in 1987,&lt;ref name = Nonlocal /&gt; though quantum nonlocality goes back to a 1935 paper by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], [[Boris Podolsky|Podolsky]], and [[Nathan Rosen|Rosen]].&lt;ref name = EPR /&gt;  Olshansky and Dossey defended their work from various critics in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'s rapid response section&lt;ref name = ODrespond /&gt;

Olensky and Dossey are not alone amongst alternative medicine proponents in having missed the point which Leibovici was making.  In 2004, Stephen Wright described the Olshansky and Dossey contribution as a "thoughtful essay,"&lt;ref name = Wright /&gt; and it was praised by an editorial in the ''[[Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine]]'' the same year.&lt;ref name = Jobst /&gt;  In 2005, Olshansky and Dossey's work was included in a critical review published in ''Explore'' which concluded that "Religious activity may improve health outcomes."&lt;ref name = ExploreCritReview /&gt;  Their work was also defended in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' itself in 2004.&lt;ref name = BMJdefender /&gt;  Dossey authored an ''Explore'' paper defending experiments on the medical effects of prayer in 2005.&lt;ref name = Twenty /&gt;

===The MANTRA study===
A 2005 MANTRA (Monitoring and Actualisation of [[Noetic theory|Noetic]] Trainings) II study conducted a three-year clinical trial led by [[Duke University]] comparing intercessory prayer and MIT (Music, Imagery, and Touch) therapies for 748 cardiology patients. The study is regarded as the first time rigorous scientific protocols were applied on a large scale to assess the feasibility of intercessory prayer and other healing practices. The study produced null results and the authors concluded, "Neither masked prayer nor MIT therapy significantly improved clinical outcome after elective catheterization or percutaneous coronary intervention."&lt;ref name="KrucoffCraterGallup"/&gt;  Neither study specified whether photographs were used or whether belief levels were measured in the agents or those performing the prayers.

===The STEP project===
Harvard professor [[Herbert Benson]] performed a "Study of the Therapeutic Effects of Intercessory Prayer (STEP)" in 2006.&lt;ref name="STEP"/&gt;  The STEP, commonly called the "[[Templeton Foundation]] prayer study" or "Great Prayer Experiment", used 1,802 [[coronary artery bypass surgery]] patients at six hospitals. Using [[double-blind]] protocols, patients were [[randomize]]d into three groups, individual prayer receptiveness was not measured. The members of the experimental and control Groups 1 and 2 were informed they might or might not receive prayers, and only Group 1 received prayers. Group 3, which served as a test for possible [[psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic effects]], was informed they would receive prayers and subsequently did. Unlike some other studies, STEP attempted to standardize the prayer method. Only first names and last initial for patients were provided and no photographs were supplied. The congregations of three [[local church|Christian churches]] who prayed for the patients "were allowed to pray in their own manner, but they were instructed to include the following phrase in their prayers: "for a successful surgery with a quick, healthy recovery and no complications".&lt;ref name="Shermer"/&gt;  Some participants complained that this mechanical way they were told to pray as part of the experiment was unusual for them. [[Complication (medicine)|Complications]] of surgery occurred in 52 percent of those who received prayer (Group 1), 51 percent of those who did not receive it (Group 2), and 59 percent of patients who knew they would receive prayers (Group 3). There were no statistically significant differences in major complications or thirty-day mortality. In ''[[The God Delusion]],'' [[evolutionary biologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]] wrote, "It seems more probable that those patients who knew they were being prayed for suffered additional stress in consequence: [[performance anxiety]]', as the experimenters put it. Dr Charles Bethea, one of the researchers, said, "It may have made them uncertain, wondering am I so sick they had to call in their prayer team?'"&lt;ref name=DelusionQuote&gt;{{cite book | chapter=The Great Prayer Experiment | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yq1xDpicghkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=god%20delusion&amp;pg=PA87#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | author=Richard Dawkins | title=[[The God Delusion]] | year=2006 | pages=87–88 | publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Study co-author Jeffery Dusek stated that: "Each study builds on others, and STEP advanced the design beyond what had been previously done.  The findings, however, could well be due to the study limitations."&lt;ref name="HarvardNewsRel"/&gt;  Team leader Benson stated that STEP was not the last word on the effects of intercessory prayer and that questions raised by the study will require additional answers.&lt;ref name="HarvardGazette"/&gt;

==Literature reviews==
A [[meta-analysis]] of several studies related to distant intercessory healing was published in the ''[[Annals of Internal Medicine]]'' in 2000.&lt;ref name=astin &gt;John A. Astin, et al. ''The Efficacy of "Distant Healing" A Systematic Review of Randomized Trials'' [[Annals of Internal Medicine]] June 6, 2000 vol. 132 no. 11 903-910 [http://www.annals.org/content/132/11/903.abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; The authors analyzed 23 trials of 2,774 patients. Five of the trials were for prayer as the distant healing method, 11 were with noncontact touch, and 7 were other forms. Of these trials, 13 showed statistically significant beneficial treatment results, 9 showed no effect, and 1 showed a negative result. The authors concluded that it is difficult to draw conclusions regarding distant healing and suggested further studies.&lt;ref name=astin /&gt;

A 2003 [[levels of evidence]] review found "some" evidence for the hypothesis that "Being prayed for improves physical recovery from acute illness".&lt;ref name="PowellShahabiThoresen"/&gt;  It concluded that although "a number of studies" have tested this hypothesis, "only three have sufficient rigor for review here" (Byrd 1988, Harris et al. 1999, and Sicher et al. 1998). In all three, "the strongest findings were for the variables that were evaluated most subjectively. This raises concerns about the possible inadvertent unmasking of the outcomes assessors. Moreover, the absence of a clearly plausible biological mechanism by which such a treatment could influence hard medical outcome results in the inclination to be skeptical of results." This 2003 review was performed before the 2005 MANTRA study and the 2006 STEP project, neither of which were conclusive in establishing the efficacy of prayer.

Various broader meta-studies of the literature in the field have been performed showing evidence only for no effect or a potentially small effect. For instance, a 2006 meta analysis on 14 studies concluded that "There is no scientifically discernable effect for intercessory prayer as assessed in controlled studies".&lt;ref name=Masters &gt;K. Masters, G. Spielmans, J. Goodson "Are there demonstrable effects of distant intercessory prayer? A meta-analytic review." ''[[Annals of Behavioral Medicine]]'' 2006 Aug;32(1):21-6. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16827626]&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2007 systemic review of 17 intercessory prayer studies found "small, but significant, effect sizes for the use of intercessory prayer" in 7 studies, but "prayer was unassociated with positive improvement in the condition of client" in the other 10, concluding that based upon the [[American Psychology Association]]'s Division 12 ([[clinical psychology]]) criteria for evidence-based practice, intercessory prayer "must be classified as an experimental intervention." The review noted that the most methodologically rigorous studies had failed to produce significant findings.&lt;ref name=DRHodge&gt;David R. Hodge, "A Systematic Review of the Empirical Literature on Intercessory Prayer" in ''Research on Social Work Practice'' March 2007 vol. 17 no. 2 174-187 {{doi|10.1177/1049731506296170}} [http://rsw.sagepub.com/content/17/2/174.abstract Article abstract] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202025826/http://rsw.sagepub.com/content/17/2/174.abstract |date=2011-12-02 }} [http://www.sagepub.com/vaughnstudy/articles/intervention/Hodge.pdf Full length article]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''suangi''' is a common name  of a male who is suspected, and therefore accused, of being a  [[witch]] in the [[belief system]] of West Papuans. Suangis are said to eat the blood and/or internal organs of their victims and then stuff the bodies with leaves and grass. They are also believed to devour the person's soul. After being attacked, the [[zombified]] victim is then said to return home where they seem to have fallen mysteriously ill. If a victim is able to name the suangi that has attacked him, they are often killed and eaten by the victim's family in the belief that it will free the person's spirit.

{{Taoism}}
A '''Taoist priest''', '''Taoist monk''', '''Taoist master''' or '''Professional Taoist''' (道士 "master of the [[Tao]]") is a [[priest]] in [[Taoism]]. Some orders are [[monasticism|monastic]] (Quanzhen orders), while the majority are not (Zhengyi orders).

Some of the monastic orders are hermitic, and their members practice seclusion and [[asceticism|ascetic]] lifestyles in the mountains, with the aim of becoming ''[[xian (Taoism)|xian]]'', or immortal beings. Non-monastic priests live among the populace and manage and serve their own temples or popular temples.

The activities of the Taoists tend to be informed by materials which may be found in the ''[[Daozang]]'', or Daoist Canon; however, Taoists generally choose, or inherit, specific texts which have been passed down for generations from teacher to student, rather than consulting published versions of these works.

==Orders==
Taoist orders are conventionally categorised into two main branches: Quanzhen and Zhengyi.

===Quanzhen Taoism===
[[Quanzhen Taoism]], which is present almost exclusively in the north of [[China]], includes all Taoist orders which have a monastic institution. Their lifestyle is comparable to that of the [[bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]]s in that they are celibate, vegetarian, and live in monasteries. The [[White Cloud Temple]] in [[Beijing]] is the main monastery of the Longmen school of Quanzhen, and is also the main headquarters of mainland China's [[Chinese Taoist Association|official Taoist Church]].

===Zhengyi Taoism===
The other main priesthood is [[Zhengyi Taoism]], in which the priests can marry, eat meat, live in their own homes, and found and manage their own temples or serve in folk religious temples. They are mostly priests part-time and can hold other jobs. Their lineages are transmitted through training and ordination by another priest, although historically they received a formal confirmation in their role by the [[Celestial Master]], the highest priest. Fragmentation of the lineage of the Celestial Masters has made Zhengyi priests more independent. In mainland China the Taoist Church has in theory taken over the power to regulate them (although only a minority of them are registered with the Church). Zhengyi orders are present all over China, although with different names according to the local lineages. For example, in northern China there are the ''yinyang'' masters of the [[Lingbao Taoism|Lingbao]] sub-tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, 2007. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16067">The '''theology of religions''' is the branch of [[theology]] (mostly represented by [[Christian theology|Christian]], [[Hinduism|Hindu]], [[Islam]]ic and [[Judaism|Jewish]] theology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bronk |first=Andrzej |title=Podstawy nauk o religii |others=Antoni Fetkowski (ed.) |publisher=Wydawnictwo Towarzystwa Naukowego KUL |location=Lublin |year=1996 |pages=129 |chapter=11. Teologia religii |isbn=83-86668-44-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[religious studies]] that attempts to theologically evaluate the phenomena of religions. Three important schools within Christian part of this field are pluralism, inclusivism, and exclusivism, which describe the relation of other religious traditions to Christianity and attempt to answer questions about the nature of God and salvation.

==Purpose==
The American theologian [[Langdon Brown Gilkey]] argued that the political situation of the West following [[World War II]] set up a need for Christian thinkers to reconsider the place of other religions specifically because of the changing political world:

:Colonies vanished, Europe disappeared as a major power, other non-western power centers appeared representing other ways of life and other religions. The West no longer ruled the world... Western religion became one among the other world religions.&lt;ref&gt;Gilkey, "Plurality and Its Theological Implications", in ''The Myth of Christian Uniqueness: Toward a Pluralistic Theology of Religions'' (edited by [[John Hick]]), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic Three-Point Model==
The most common model of the view that one takes of other religions has been viewed in a simple, three point model, first articulated by Alan Race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Race |first=Alan |date=1982 |title= Christians and Religious Pluralism: Patterns in the Christian Theology of Religions |location= Maryknoll, NY|publisher=Orbis Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pluralism===
Pluralism is basically the belief that the world religions are true and equally valid in their communication of the truth about God, the world, and salvation. The chief expounder of this view is [[John Hick]] of [[Claremont Graduate School]] in California, who first propounded it in his book ''God and the Universe of Faiths (1973)''. It has been notably criticized in the declaration [[Dominus Iesus]] by Cardinal [[Joseph Ratzinger]].

This is the popular view that all religions lead to the same God and all ways lead to heaven. According to Hick, Christianity is not the one and only way of salvation, but one among several. To a pluralist such as Hick, Christianity is not the absolute, unique, and final way to God. While pluralists assert the validity of all religions, they also deny the finality of all religions. According to Hick, in the evolutionary scheme of things in which at isolated ages and places the early religions are succeeded by higher religions, it is the same message of God that comes distinctly to a particular group but in a different form from the others. Hick challenges the older view that Christ or Christianity must be seen at the center of religions. Rather, he says, God must be seen at the center of religions. This view is also called theo-centrism. The pluralistic contention is that although religions have different outward forms, all have the same source.

To an evangelical Christian, such pluralism only means the abolition of ''kerygmatic'' mission (i.e., the mission of evangelizing the world with the salvific gospel of Jesus Christ).  Pluralism has been criticized for masquerading as Christianity when in fact it is an invasive force that comes from outside of Christianity and imperialistically demands the surrender of Christian distinctiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Alister E. McGrath, "Conclusion," in ''Four Views on Salvation in a Pluralistic World'', ed. Stanley N. Gundry, Dennis L. Okholm, and Timothy R. Phillips (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 1996), 205-7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pluralists respond that Christian pluralism is not an invasive force at all, but actually arises from tensions within the Christian tradition, through a process of auto-deconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Carroll Smith, "In Defense of a Christian Pluralism," Journal for the Renewal of Religion and Theology 5 (2009), available from http://renewtheology.org/paperCSmith0709.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have pointed out similarities between Hick's theo-centrism and Hindu pluralism as propounded in the &lt;em&gt;Bhagavad Gita&lt;/em&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;By whatsoever way men worship Me, even so do I accept them; for, in all ways, O Partha, men walk in My path" (IV.11)&lt;ref&gt;Domenic Marbaniang, &lt;em&gt;Theology of Religion: Pluralism, Inclusivism, and Exclusivism&lt;/em&gt;, as cited by Imtitoshi Longkumer in "Issues in Mission and Evangelism in a Pluralistic Context: A New Paradigm Inquiry," &lt;em&gt;NCC Review,&lt;/em&gt; Vol. CXXXVII, No.01, Jan-Feb 2017 (Nagpur: National Council of Churches in India, 2017), p.10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Another common evangelical criticism of pluralism is that the religions of the world are fundamentally and irreconcilably different.  To value them equally requires a devaluation of propositional truth claims.  It is for this reason that pluralism is often treated as a form of self-defeating relativism, though pluralists generally do not accept this label.  According to John Hick, "Religious pluralism is emphatically not a form of relativism."  Hick considers himself a [[Theological critical realism|critical realist]].&lt;ref&gt;John Hick, "Religious Pluralism and Islam," available from http://www.johnhick.org.uk/article11.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inclusivism===
[[Inclusivism]] is the belief that God is present in non-Christian religions to save adherents through Christ. The inclusivist view has given rise to the concept of the anonymous Christian by which is understood an adherent of a particular religion whom God saves through Christ, but who personally neither knows the Christ of the Bible nor has converted to Biblical Christianity. This position was popularized by the Roman Catholic theologian, [[Karl Rahner]] (b. 1904-d.1984).{{Nonspecific|date=March 2012}}

One important issue that Rahner raises is about the salvation of those who have never had the opportunity to listen to the gospel Jesus Christ. To Rahner, then, people can be saved apart from allegiance to the Christian church. It is God in Christ who reaches out to the individual in his own personal religious history to save him. Rahner used the term ‘anonymous’ to denote people who experience the grace of God in Christ regardless of what religion they belong to. Inclusivism is based on two axioms: the first is that salvation is through Christ alone, the second is that God wills the whole world to be saved.&lt;ref&gt;Based on Acts 4:12 and 1 Timothy 2: 4&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, God saves people through Christ alone; however, he makes this possible through ways that extend to all humanity.

To Rahner, a non-Christian religion is a lawful religion for until its followers have a Christian witness it is a means by which non-Christians gain a right relationship with God. Also, the religion is included in God’s plan of salvation which God has ordained for the communication of His grace.

Inclusivism has a great appeal to people because of its sympathetic approach to religion.

===Exclusivism===
Exclusivism is the theological position that holds to the finality of the Christian faith in Christ. The finality of Christ means that there is no salvation in non-Christian religions. Notable among the exclusivists of the twentieth century are [[Samuel Zwemer]], [[Hendrik Kraemer]], and [[Lesslie Newbigin]].

Based on the Aristotelian concept of truth as one and not many, exclusivists regard all other religious claims as false and invalid since the Christian revelation is accepted as true.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Gnanakan, The Pluralistic Predicament (Bangalore: TBT, 1992), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Exclusivists hold that salvation is through Christ alone. It is through a personal experience of commitment to Christ that one receives assurance of salvation. The non-believers cannot receive such assurance since they are neither aware of the uniqueness of Christ neither do they acknowledge His lordship. The exclusivist begins with the Bible as the source of all knowledge about spirituality and salvation. The Bible is the criterion of all religious truth. The Bible relates the history of redemption, gives a foundation to personal faith, is a guidebook of the Christian community, and speaks about the future of the world that links up all history, life, and service with meaning and purpose. Exclusivism, thus, establishes the uniqueness and identity of Christianity among world religions. Such exclusivism can take either an extremist or a moderate viewpoint. The extremist view regards all non-Christian religions as demonic and enemies of Christian truth.&lt;ref&gt;Emil Brunner &amp; Karl Barth, Natural Theology (London: Geoffrey Bles: The Centenary Press, 1946), pp. 74, 128&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the moderate view sees some non-Christian religions as containing elements whereby a dialogue with them can be initiated. However, all exclusivists in general agree that salvation is exclusively only through Christ and received by a personal commitment to the Lord.

An exclusivist view is inevitable in any dialogue of truth. In fact, neither the pluralist nor the inclusivist could avoid being exclusivist at some point. Truth by nature is exclusive and any claim to truth is exclusive. The only way to deny exclusiveness of Christ is to deny the veracity of the Bible. The exclusivist view sees the exclusiveness of the Bible in its proclamation of Christ as the only way of salvation, though the Bible also speaks of God involved in the history of the nations. Thus, though being very vociferous in his attacks on Hinduism, [[Nehemiah Goreh]] could say that ‘Most erroneous as is the teaching of such books as the ''Bhagvadgita,''  the ''Bhagvata'', etc., yet they teach something of ''ananyabhakti'' (undivided devotedness to God), of ''vairagya'' (giving up the world), of ''namrata'' (humility), of ''ksama'' (forbearance), etc., which enables one to appreciate the precepts of Christianity.’&lt;ref&gt;Quote from Proofs of the Divinity of Our Lord, as cited by R.H.S. Boyd in Indian Christian Theology (Delhi: ISPCK, 1969), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Hendrik Kraemer's exclusivism is based on a skepticism towards claims of similarity between religions: "Every religion is an individisble, and not to be divided". Religion "is not a series of tenets, institutions, practices that can be taken one by one as independent items of religious life".&lt;ref&gt;Hendrik Kraemer, ''The Christian Message in a Non-Christian World'' (1938), p. 40. Cited in {{cite book|author=Tim S. Perry|title=Radical Difference: A Defence of Hendrik Kraemer's Theology of Religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5FBFtVH_mOwC&amp;pg=PA115|year=2001|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press|isbn=978-0-88920-377-8|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Knitter's Four-Point Model==
A significant expansion of the three point model was proposed by [[Paul F. Knitter]] in his 2002 book ''Introducing Theologies of Religions''. He outlined four possible views or models that one could adopt.&lt;ref&gt; Introducing Theologies of Religions. Maryknoll, NY: Orbis Books, 2002. 256 pp. {{ISBN|1-57075-419-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Replacement Model===

This tracks to the third of the three point models, i.e. Exclusivism, but is split into two subsections: Total Replacement and Partial Replacement. The Total Replacement model is most frequently found in [[Fundamentalist Christians|Fundamentalist]]/[[Evangelical]] churches, and largely represents the work of [[Karl Barth]]. It suggests that the reason the Christian religion is considered true is that it realizes that all religion is false (including itself), and recognizes that the only true belief can be found in Jesus. It does not necessarily say that there is nothing of value in other religions, but simply that there is no use in studying other religions, as everything of value can be found in Christ. The Partial Replacement model has similar things to say about other religions, but does not go so far as to say that there is nothing of value in other religions. It suggests that other religions might have access to God's revelation, but not to God's salvation. This is an important distinction, as it implies that some truth can be found in other religions, but not whole of the truth, and not enough to receive salvation. This view is largely based on the views expressed by the [[World Council of Churches]] in their discussion on religious dialogue and theology.

===The Fulfillment Model===

Knitter's main contribution, informed by his Christian faith and the idea that Christianity is a fulfillment of Judaism, implies that, while the previous religion was not wrong, it was incomplete and awaiting later fulfillment. This view is also held by some forms of Islam with respect to Christianity and Judaism before them, as well as by Mormonism and all other faiths who feel they have a later clarification from God.

However, one's religion does not have to be founded after others in order to see one's religion as a fulfillment. For instance, some Christian theologians argue that if their faith *arrives* later than the indigenous religion, even if in history Christianity came first, such indigenous systems were "God's placeholder," often with common truths learned from nature mixed with erroneous revelatory truths, that can be fulfilled and corrected with the revealed truth of the Christian Scriptures.

Proponents of this view include [[Karl Rahner]], whose appreciation of the phrase "all grace is Christ's grace" led him to the controversial theory of "anonymous Christians" - those who are already saved by the light they have, yet have not yet heard the gospel.&lt;ref&gt;Knitter, 72, 73. See also, Karl Rahner, “Christianity and the non-Christian Religions,” in Theological Investigations (Baltimore: Helicon Press, 1966) 5:115-134&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Mutuality Model===

This model admits that an admixture of truth, error, and incompleteness of revelation exists in all religions, and we need one another to understand and find the truth. While this is a type of pluralism, it does not go so far as to admit that everyone is right, or that there is no objective truth - it only admits that we must learn from one another to find it. It may be that one or another faith is wrong on even major doctrines - but it is also right and has some value in contributing to the whole. 

===The Acceptance Model===
This is Knitter's analog of pure pluralism. All paths may lead to God, and no one can affirm surely that their way is correct. We must all learn from one another, and pull back from making any absolute claims about spiritual matters. As a type of utilitarianism, it takes a subjective approach that admits that various viewpoints may work or not work for the individual, and that is the measure of truth, and any claims beyond that are speculation.

{{Jewish feminism}}
'''Women of the Wall''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: נשות הכותל, ''Neshot HaKotel'') is a multi-denominational feminist&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2010|p=644}}: "The Women of the Wall believed themselves to be liberal feminists."&lt;/ref&gt; organization based in [[Israel]] whose goal is to secure the rights of women to pray at the [[Western Wall]], also called the Kotel, in a fashion that includes singing, reading aloud from the [[Torah]] and wearing religious garments (''[[tallit]]'', ''[[tefillin]]'' and ''[[kippah]]''). Pew Research Center has identified Israel as one of the countries that place "high" restrictions on religion,&lt;ref name="prc-2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Restrictions on Religion (Full report)|publisher=The Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life|date=December 2009|url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2009/12/restrictions-fullreport.pdf|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there have been limits placed on non-Orthodox streams of Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;"U.S. Department of State: 2012 Report on International Religious Freedom: Israel and The Occupied Territories (May 20, 2013)"http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2012/nea/208392.htm&lt;/ref&gt; One of those restrictions is that the Rabbi of the Western Wall has enforced gender segregation and limitations on religious garb worn by women.  When the "Women of the Wall" hold monthly prayer services for women on [[Rosh Hodesh]], they observe gender segregation so that Orthodox members may fully participate.  But their use of religious garb, singing and reading from a Torah have upset some members of the Orthodox Jewish community, sparking protests and arrests. In May 2013 a judge ruled that a 2003 Israeli Supreme Court ruling prohibiting women from carrying a Torah or wearing prayer shawls had been misinterpreted and that Women of the Wall prayer gatherings at the wall should not be deemed illegal.&lt;ref name="civildisobedience2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/26/world/middleeast/israeli-law-curbing-womens-prayer-up-for-review.html|title=Israel to Review Curbs on Women's Prayer at Western Wall|last=Rudoren|first=Jodi|date=December 25, 2012|work=The New York Times|accessdate=December 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, the Israeli Cabinet approved a plan to designate a new space at the Kotel that would be available for egalitarian prayer and which would not be controlled by the Rabbinate. Women of the Wall welcomed the decision,&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/01/world/middleeast/israel-western-wall-prayer.html|title=Israel Approves Prayer Space at Western Wall for Non-Orthodox Jews|date=1 February 2016|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the plan faced opposition from other factions, including some ultra-Orthodox members of Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]'s governing coalition, who threatened to withdraw over the government's plan to create non-Orthodox prayer space at the [[Western Wall]] in deference to the Women of the Wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Netanyahu-facing-crisis-as-Haredim-vow-to-quit-over-Western-Wall-pluralism-447102 Netanyahu facing crisis as haredim vow to quit over Western Wall pluralism]. The Jerusalem Post, March 7, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, the Israeli High Court ruled that if the government of Israel could not find "good cause" to prohibit women reading from the Torah in prayer services at the Kotel within 30 days, women could do so; they also ruled that the Israeli government could no longer argue that the Robinson's Arch area of the plaza is access to the Kotel.&lt;ref name="timesofisrael1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shimoni |first=Rebecca |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-sweeping-decision-high-court-rules-for-womens-western-wall-prayer/ |title=In landmark decision, High Court rules for women's Western Wall prayer |publisher=The Times of Israel |date= |accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition for women to read from the Torah at the Kotel had been brought by a group that split off from the Women of the Wall, calling itself the "Original Women of the Wall".&lt;ref name="timesofisrael1"/&gt;

In June 2017, it was announced that the plan approved in January 2016 had been suspended.&lt;ref name="jweekly1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sales |first=Ben |url=http://www.jweekly.com/2017/06/26/suspension-of-western-wall-deal-leaves-jewish-leaders-feeling-betrayed/ |title=Suspension of Western Wall deal leaves Jewish leaders feeling betrayed – J |publisher=Jweekly.com |date=2017-06-26 |accessdate=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2017/06/25/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/netanyahu-rescinds-pluralistic-western-wall-agreement |title=Israel freezes Western Wall compromise that was to create egalitarian prayer section &amp;#124; Jewish Telegraphic Agency |publisher=Jta.org |date=2017-06-25 |accessdate=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ronit Kampf, the group's struggle has been "the most covered women's issue in the history of the Israeli media."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haberman|2012|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
[[File:Western Wall before sunset.jpg|thumb|250px|The Western Wall (August 2012)]]
From the start, Women of the Wall included Orthodox members and opted to run their service according to "Orthodox standards." Nevertheless, some Orthodox individuals were offended, including some who call themselves Orthodox feminists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesler|Haut|2003|p=184}}: "A third reason for choosing Orthodox services was out awareness that if we did not adopt Orthodox standards, Orthodox women would not attend our services or, in all likelihood, support our struggle. Non-Orthodox women who have been involved in the Kotel struggle have been most generous in allowing Orthodox practice to prevail, and our services at the Kotel as well as the solidarity services we sponsored elsewhere therefore have been conducted in accordance with Orthodox standards. Despite this many Orthodox women, even those who were active in women's ''tefillah'' groups and leaders of Orthodox feminism, remained reticent and ambivalent about our struggle to pray at the Kotel, and Orthodox rabbis, even those who permitted women's ''tefillah'' their synagogues, did not support our right to pray in an identical fashion at the Kotel.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Feldman|2011|p=115}}: "The movement, which is controversial, even among Orthodox feminists, myself included..."&lt;/ref&gt; Women of the Wall is a multi-denominational group, including Reform, Conservative and Orthodox members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/news/1.679974 Amid Violence, Women of the Wall Vote Not to Engage Police This Month] Haaretz, Oct 12, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1988, the group has faced a legal battle for recognition of their right to pray at the Western Wall. Their presence is deemed offensive by Orthodox worshippers at the site and there have been numerous court proceedings to settle the issue. On the [[Fast of Esther]] 1989, ultra-Orthodox men, outraged by the women's singing, hurled chairs and verbal insults at the women, which resulted in the deployment of tear gas to quell the violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rubel|2010|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, police arrested two [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] men at the Western Wall plaza on suspicion that they threw chairs at a Women of the Wall group that was praying aloud at the site.&lt;ref&gt;2010 Human Rights Report: Israel and the occupied territories. U.S. Department of state. This article incorporates public domain material from this source.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, the first woman was arrested for praying with a ''tallit''. The struggle by the Women of the Wall is seen by the Israeli Orthodox religious establishment as an attempt to undermine their influence in an effort to introduce religious pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Price|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition from the Orthodox also stems from Halachic concerns and from a general disdain for non-traditional ritual in an area they claim serves as an Orthodox synagogue. Orthodoxy does not permit women to constitute a ''[[minyan]]'' (prayer quorum) and while the women have not considered themselves as doing so, this has not calmed ultra-Orthodox sensibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharma|Young|1999|p=207}}: "Known as "the Women of the Wall," these women, out of deference to the group's Orthodox members, have used traditional liturgical texts and have not considered themselves to be a ''minyan''. Halakhically, at least as understood by Orthodoxy, women cannot constitute or count as members of a prayer quorum. Nonetheless, they have become the target of great opposition and occasional violence from ultra Orthodox Jews. [...] Women of the Wall continue to face opposition from ultra Orthodox Jews who are against women's prayer groups in general.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baines|Rubio-Marin|2005|p=214}}: "The Women of the Wall organization represents a group of observant Jewish women who pray together in a ''minyan'' -  a religious quorum traditionally reserved for men. This form of collective worship is not acceptable to ultra-Orthodox Jews when practiced by women."&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, the group did not receive support from Israel's primarily Orthodox religious authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chambré|2002|p=12}}: "But, at the kotel, where tradition trumps individual choice, the guidelines have not changed because they are not only a matter of acknowledging the desires of this group, which itself would radically alter Jewish tradition, but because the group lacks the support of any major religious authority. At the same time, acceding to their requests might also mean giving parity to non-Orthodox denominations."&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters highlighted the fact that only in Israel are Jewish women prohibited from praying according to their custom in a public location&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Feldman|2011|p=115}}: "Supporters of the Women of the Wall note the irony that "only in Israel, and at the site most holy to Jews...are Jewish women prohibited from praying aloud in a group with a Torah."&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2003 High Court ruling which prevented them from conducting prayer services at the wall&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Senate (US) Committee on Foreign Relations|2005|p=552}}: "In 2003, the Women of the Wall, a group of more than 100 Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform women, lost their 14-year legal battle to hold formal women's prayer services at the Western Wall. The High Court ruled that the group could not hold prayer services at the Western Wall and instead would be permitted to hold them at nearby Robinson's Arch."&lt;/ref&gt; was overturned in 2013.

==History==
[[File:WOW Torah Reading.jpg|thumb|WOW Torah Reading]]
Twenty-five years after the founding of WoW, a poll by the Israel Democracy Institute in May 2013 found that about half of the Israel public supports the Women of the Wall, and that men (51.5%) are more inclined to support the women's prayer group than women (46%) The poll was conducted by Professor Tamar Hermann, who noted that Women of the Wall received highest levels of support from educated, secular, Ashkenazi Israelis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/poll-half-of-israelis-support-women-of-the-wall.premium-1.523651|title=Poll: Half of Israelis support Women of the Wall|date=13 May 2013|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the group was not always met with support from the majority of Israelis, as it is today.

Women of the Wall was founded in December 1988 at the first International Jewish Feminist Conference in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Skinner Keller|Radford Ruether|Cantlon|2006|p=584}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 1, 1988, during the conference, Rivka Haut organized a group of multi-denominational women to pray at the Western Wall. 70 women carried a Torah scroll to the [[Western Wall]], and Rabbi [[Deborah Brin]] led a prayer service for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nahalatshalom.org/who-we-are/our-rabbi/78-about/163-women-of-the-wall-founding-rabbi-deborah-brin.html|title=Women of the Wall founding Rabbi Deborah Brin - Nahalat Shalom|author=Judy B|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francine Klagsbrun]] was the one chosen to carry the Torah at the head of the group, making her the first woman to carry a Torah to the Western Wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/klagsbrun-francine |title=Francine Klagsbrun &amp;#124; Jewish Women's Archive |publisher=Jwa.org |date=2009-03-01 |accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the conference ended, a group of Jerusalem women led by Bonna Devora Haberman continued to meet at the [[Western Wall|Kotel]] and formed Women of the Wall to assert their right to pray there without hindrance.&lt;ref name="JVL"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/WOW.html |first=Sarah |last=Szymkowicz |title=Women Of The Wall |work=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women of the Wall has fought a legal battle asserting a right to conduct organized prayer at the Kotel and challenging government and private intervention in its efforts. After demanding police protection, the government was given nine months to make arrangements that would allow them to pray unhindered. At the end of this period, the Ministry of Religion ruled that only prayer according to the "custom of the place" was to be permitted and that "the sensitivities of other worshippers" must not be offended.&lt;ref name="Starr Sered 2010 636"&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2010|p=636}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Women of the Wall then petitioned the Supreme Court to recognize their right to pray at the Wall. A temporary ruling was given which stated that the ''status quo'' should be enforced until they reached a final verdict.&lt;ref name="Starr Sered 2010 636"/&gt;

The legal battles between the High Court of Justice and the Women of the Wall continued between 1995 and 2000. The Israeli government did not uphold the position that they would find a way for the Women of the Wall to pray, which resulted in an appeal from the Women of the Wall to the High Court of Justice in 1995. This concluded in April 1996, determining the solution was to move the Women of the Wall's prayer from the Western Wall to the Robinson's Arch. Robinson's Arch was not in the area of main prayer. The Women of the Wall appealed this decision to the Ne'eman Committee in 1998, who reaffirmed the previous decision of the High Court Justice. The Women of the Wall accepted the decision on the condition that the area they were being moved to be set up to be a proper prayer area. The government did not do such preparations of the prayer area in Robinson's Arch, resulting in the appeal to the Supreme Court in 2000 by the Women of the Wall. In this appeal, the supreme court ruled that the Israeli government was required to allow the Women of the Wall to exercise their religious freedom and practices at the Western Wall.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reiter|first=Yitzhak|date=2016-04-02|title=Feminists in the Temple of Orthodoxy: The Struggle of the Women of the Wall to Change the Status Quo|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/613732|journal=Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies|volume=34|issue=2|pages=79–107|doi=10.1353/sho.2016.0001|issn=1534-5165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The struggle has led to two Israeli Supreme Court decisions and a series of debates in the [[Knesset]]. In its first decision, on May 22, 2002, the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]] ruled that it is legal for Women of the Wall to hold prayer groups and read Torah in the women's section of the main Kotel plaza undisturbed. Four days later, [[Haredi]] political parties including [[Shas]] introduced several bills to overturn the decision, including a bill that would have made it a criminal offense for women to pray in non-traditional ways at the Western Wall, punishable by up to seven years in prison.&lt;ref name="JVL"/&gt; In response MK Naomi Chazan said "What have we become? Afghanistan? Iran?"&lt;ref name=LAT2000/&gt; Although the bill did not pass, the Israeli Supreme Court reconsidered its earlier decision. On April 6, 2003, the Court reversed itself and upheld, 5-4, the Israeli government's ban prohibiting the organization from reading Torah or wearing tallit or tefillin at the main public area at the Wall, on the grounds that such continued meetings represented a threat to public safety and order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writ.news.findlaw.com/colb/20030423.html|title="The Israeli Supreme Court Denies Women The Right to Pray at the Western Wall", Findlaw.

In December 2012, following pressure from non-Orthodox US Jews,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/women-of-the-wall-urge-jerusalem-police-to-refrain-from-arrests-at-upcoming-service.premium-1.514734 Women of the Wall urge Jerusalem police to refrain from arrests at upcoming service], ''Haaretz'', (April 10, 2013) "Under pressure from the non-Orthodox Jewish world, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu instructed Sharansky several months ago to draft .."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natan Sharansky]], the chairman of the [[Jewish Agency for Israel]], was asked by the Prime Minister to find a solution to the dispute.&lt;ref name="civildisobedience2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guard2"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/10/western-wall-resolve-prayer-rights Western Wall plan unveiled to resolve 24-year-old prayer rights dispute], (10 April 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the detentions at the wall in February 2013, Sharansky said "When I listen to the very partial presentation, I am fully with them — when I listen to the other side, I have to accept that they also have logic.

This attempt was endorsed by the government to solve the controversy of the wall, but in actuality, this arrangement would have led to the emergence of a new conflict. Instead of ending the quarreling by granting women full rights to worship at the existing wall, the women would have had to fight for recognition among the public at their new area. The area for the women would have been located in what is known as the Robinson's Arch site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reiter|first=Yitzhak|date=Winter 2016|title=Feminists in the Temple of Orthodoxy: The Struggle of the Women of the Wall to Change the Status Quo|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/613732|journal=Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies|volume=34|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, three women MKs used their [[parliamentary immunity]] to don prayer shawls and join the Women of the Wall in a show of support after 10 women had been arrested the previous month. MK [[Stav Shaffir]] ([[Israeli Labor Party|Labour]]) said "I usually do not wear a ''tallit'', but it is my honor and duty to stand here and protect the rights of all Jews from around the world to pray as they desire and believe." [[Tamar Zandberg]] ([[Meretz]]) said: "I demand to enter. The extremist stream's interpretation of the Holy Places Law is unacceptable to me, and I refuse to leave the prayer shawl outside. I am a secular woman but I identify with these women's struggle for freedom of expression and religion." Subsequently, a number of MKs condemned their actions. MK [[Aliza Lavie]] ([[Yesh Atid]]), who herself supports the right of the women to assemble, said she was "shocked" that fellow MKs decided to blatantly disobey the law and ignore Supreme Court rulings. MK [[Miri Regev]] ([[Likud]]) called the MKs attendance a "provocation" and referred to the groups "anarchistic actions" which had "turned into a national sport among the extreme Left in Israel." MK [[Uri Ariel]] ([[Bayit Yehudi]]) called the women radicals and suggested that their "gross violations" at the site may lead to civil war.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Sharon.

The arrests have been criticized by groups promoting religious pluralism in Israel.

In October 2014, Women of the Wall launched a campaign to encourage girls to have their bat mitzvah services at the Kotel. Unlike most diaspora Jewish girls, Israeli Jewish girls typically do not celebrate a bat mitvah by reading from their Torah portion. The ad campaign features girls wearing prayer shawls and holding a Torah scroll in front of the wall. The ad, placed on Israeli buses, has the caption, "Mom, I also want a bat mitzvah at the Kotel!" The Western Wall Heritage Foundation, which is controlled by the Orthodox and oversees events at the wall, not only runs a business of bar mitzvahs for boys that has excluded girls from their offerings, but has refused to permit women to carry Torah scrolls at the wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.620543|title=Women of the Wall bus ad campaign encourages bat mitzvahs at the Kotel|date=13 October 2014|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the campaign ads were soon vandalized in Orthodox neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/207262/women-of-wall-push-for-bat-mitzvahs-at-western-wal/|title=Women of Wall Push for Bat Mitzvahs at Western Wall|date=13 October 2014|work=The Jewish Daily Forward}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ad campaign received international publicity when religious extremists carried out violent attacks in Jerusalem.

Although the women have won the legal right to pray in their fashion at the wall, Rabbi [[Shmuel Rabinowitz]], the Supervisor of the Western Wall, has refused to allow the women to use the Torah scrolls distributed in the men's section or to bring their own.

On December 18, 2014 Women of the Wall held a women's candle lighting at the Kotel. For [[Hanukkah]] every year a giant [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]] is erected in the men's section of the Western Wall and each night of the eight nights of the festival, male rabbis and male politicians are honored, while women are kept at a distance, where they are barely able to see the ceremony. At the Women of the Wall ceremony, women brought their personal [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]]s. They invited Jews around the world to light a candle for WoW on the third night of Hanukkah.&lt;ref&gt;"'Light One Candle with Women of the Wall' (Dec 11) Women of the Wall" http://womenofthewall.org.il/2014/12/light-one-candle/&lt;/ref&gt; Wow sent a letter to Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] requesting a large menorah also be erected in the women's section just as there is one in the men's section, but Netanyahu simply forwarded the letter to Western Wall rabbi Shmuel Rabinowitz, who accused WoW of ulterior motives of trying to change the customs at the Wall. Responding to Rabinowitz' accusation, Anat Hoffman noted: "In his letter, Rabbi Rabinowitz speaks of bringing together and uniting the nation, and yet his actions exclude and discriminate against women as if women are not part of the same nation. Since he was chosen for this public position, Rabinowitz has never invited Women of the Wall or any other women to participate in the ceremonies or to be honored with the lighting of a candle at the Kotel on Hanukkah, despite the fact that women are obligated equally to men in this religious act." Initially, the personal menorahs the women brought to the Kotel were confiscated, but they were returned when police were called.&lt;ref&gt;"Maltz, Judy 'Rabbi bans Women of the Wall's Hanukkah candle-lighting ceremony' (Dec 14, 2014) Haaretz"http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/.premium-1.631730&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Judy Maltz 'Sarah Silverman joins Women activists at Western Wall Hanukkah ceremony: Kotel security confiscates prayer group's menorahs, returned only after complaint lodged with police.'

In April 2015 Women of the Wall participated in reading from a full-size Torah scroll at the organization's service at the Western Wall. One hundred Torah scrolls are kept for the use of the men's side of the Western Wall and male supporters of Women of the Wall passed a Torah scroll across the barrier into the women's section for Women of the Wall's service.

"Nothing you could say could tear me away from my Torah."

|In response to the ruling allowing the Women of the Wall to hold their services at the site, between 5,000-10,000 [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] girls converged to prevent the women from approaching. Police in turn offered protection to around 400 women who formed the largest gathering in the group's history. The women prayed together with a group of male supporters, the first time a mixed service had been held by the organisation. They had planned to bring a Torah scroll into the women's prayer section, but reneged upon the request of Minister of Religious Affairs [[Naftali Bennett]]. Three Haredi men were arrested for disturbing the peace. Chair of Women of the Wall, [[Anat Hoffman]], said "We are continuing in the footsteps of the paratroopers who liberated the Western Wall."&lt;br /&gt;
[[Women for the Wall]] is founded to campaign against the Women of the Wall.

|Threatening graffiti was sprayed on the front door of an executive board member of the Women of the Wall organisation. It read: "Peggy, you're the first. We know where you live. Jerusalem is holy. The Western Wall will not be forfeited. The Women of the Wall are villains." MK [[Michal Rozin]] ([[Meretz]]) blamed the attack on provocative statements by ultra-Orthodox MKs, and Jerusalem mayor [[Nir Barkat]] and his ultra-Orthodox deputy, Yitzhak Pindrus, denounced the act. Rabbi [[Shmuel Rabinovitch]] of the Western Wall called it "a despicable incident," which "did not represent Judaism."

|It was reported that Chief Rabbis [[Yona Metzger]] and [[Shlomo Amar]] had received death threats. The letters stated that if the Women of the Wall are not allowed to pray according to their ways and custom, "we will fight you with all measures, and you will return home with 100 bodies of haredim... We will no longer practice restraint. We will re-liberate the Western Wall." Rabbi Shmuel Rabinovitch had also received a similar letter. Women of the Wall said that the organization "had nothing to do with the act and that the style of these letters does not match the love of Israel spirit led by the group."

| [[United Torah Judaism]] arranged for between 5,000-7,000 Haredi girls to assemble at the wall and for the first time in 25 years, police prevented the Women of the Wall from approaching the site. Male protesters numbered around 1,000. The women, numbering around 300, held their service at the entrance to the Western Wall plaza and were occasionally disturbed by shouting and targeted at least twice by water bombs and eggs. An Orthodox man and women were arrested for public order offenses. [[Gilad Kariv]] of the [[Israel Movement for Reform and Progressive Judaism|Reform Movement in Israel]] said the police had "given a reward to a small group of Haredi provocateurs and rabbis who deal in spreading baseless hatred." Orthodox Jerusalem deputy mayor Yitzhak Pindrus said "baseless hatred caused the greatest destruction to befall our people and we will not let a small group of agitators to continue to polarise with provocations and baseless hatred."

|Some of the Women of the Wall became the first women to light menorahs at the Western Wall. Specifically, they lit 28 menorahs in the women's section of the Wall. Comedian [[Sarah Silverman]] was among those who attended the lighting of the menorahs. However, this event came after the rabbi in charge of the Western Wall had refused a request from Women of the Wall to place a menorah in the women's section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/18/sarah-silverman-western-wall-hanukkah_n_6351040.html|title=Comedian Sarah Silverman Supports Women Of The Wall At Hanukkah Menorah Lighting|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|For the first time, some of the Women of the Wall read from a full-size Torah scroll during the group's monthly prayer service at the Western Wall. Torah scrolls at the Western Wall are  normally stored in the men's section, which women are forbidden from entering. But on April 20 a group of male Jewish sympathizers handed a full-size Torah scroll over to Women of the Wall leaders. Some Haredi Orthodox men who had been praying at the Wall attacked the male sympathizers and tried to take the Torah scroll away from the women, but the attacking men were reportedly removed by the police, and the women were able to complete their prayer service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jenkins |first=Jack |url=http://thinkprogress.org/world/2015/04/21/3649582/jewish-feminists-israel-defy-ban-read-full-size-torah-western-wall/ |title=Jewish Feminists In Israel Defy Ban, Read From A Full-Size Torah At The Western Wall |publisher=ThinkProgress |date=2015-04-21 |accessdate=2015-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/74537/emanu-el-contingent-takes-part-in-historic-women-of-the-wall-torah-service/ |title=Emanu-El contingent takes part in historic Women of the Wall Torah service &amp;#124; j. the Jewish news weekly of Northern California |publisher=Jweekly.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|The Israeli High Court ruled that if the government of Israel could not find "good cause" to prohibit women reading from the Torah in prayer services at the Kotel within 30 days, women could do so; they also ruled that the Israeli government could no longer argue that the Robinson's Arch area of the plaza is access to the Kotel.&lt;ref name="timesofisrael1"/&gt; The petition for women to read from the Torah at the Kotel had been brought by a group that split off from the Women of the Wall, calling itself the "Original Women of the Wall".&lt;ref name="timesofisrael1"/&gt;

==Arrests and detainment ==
[[File:Lesley and Rachel Detained.jpg|thumb|Women detained for wearing prayer shawls; photo from Women of the Wall]]

In their struggle for civil rights and religious freedom, members of the group have been willing to engage in civil disobedience and become "prisoners of conscience.".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chesler|Haut|2003|pp=56–57}}: "But we might also have to go outside both the legal and political system. Would women be willing to do civil disobedience, get arrested? A[nat]: Absolutely! We are hoping that Shas actually passes the bill that would put us in jail for seven years. P[hyllis]: You would sit in jail for seven years? A: We have quite a few women who are willing to become prisoners of conscience. P: Prisoners of conscience . . . A: If the police weren't ready to arrest us for six months, do you think they'd arrest us for seven years? If they did, it would be very good for us, both legally and in terms of media support. Imagine what Amnesty International will do with this!"&lt;/ref&gt;

Several members of the group have been arrested for acts that Women of the Wall members say are legal under the Supreme Court ruling. Nofrat Frenkel was arrested for wearing a tallit under her coat and holding a Torah in November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3807090,00.html|title=Police Arrest Woman Praying at the Western Wall|work=ynet}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was not charged, but she was barred from visiting the Wall for two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/119509/,|title=The 'Crime' of Praying with a Tallit, and a Plea for Tolerance: First Person|date=24 November 2009|work=The Jewish Daily Forward}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group's leader, [[Anat Hoffman]], was interrogated by the police in January 2010, fingerprinted, and told that she could be charged with a felony over her involvement with Women of the Wall. The questioning concerned WOW's December service, during which Hoffman said she did not do anything out of the ordinary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/122754/|title=Women of the Wall Leader Interrogated by Police|date=6 January 2010|work=The Jewish Daily Forward}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 12, 2010, Hoffman was arrested for holding a [[Torah scroll]]. She was fined 5,000 [[New Israeli Shekel|NIS]] and given a restraining order according to which she was not allowed to approach the Kotel for thirty days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/police-arrest-women-of-the-wall-leader-for-praying-with-torah-scroll-1.301457|title=Police arrest Women of the Wall leader for praying with Torah scroll|date=12 July 2010|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 16, 2012, Hoffman was arrested again.

This time they checked me naked, completely, without my underwear. They dragged me on the floor 15 meters; my arms are bruised. They put me in a cell without a bed, with three other prisoners, including a prostitute and a car thief.  They threw the food through a little window in the door. I laid on the floor covered with my [[tallit]].  I'm a tough cookie, but I was just so miserable. And for what? I was with the [[Hadassah]] women saying Sh'ma Yisrael."&lt;ref&gt;Sharon, Jeremy.

On February 11, 2013, ten women who were part of WOW, including two American rabbis, were detained for praying at the wall and "as a result of them wearing the garments that they're not allowed to wear specifically at that site."&lt;ref name=nytfeb&gt;{{cite news|last=Rudoren|first=Jodi|title=Women Praying at Western Wall in Jerusalem Are Detained|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/world/middleeast/Women-Praying-at-Western-Wall-Detained.html|accessdate=11 February 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The women were barred from returning for 15 days.

On April 11, 2013, five women were detained for allegedly goading and offending other worshippers.

==Women of the Wall's position==
The Women of the Wall have consistently claimed that there is no single "custom of the place" and that their right to pray is a religious freedom enshrined in Israeli law. They believe the Western Wall is a religious site as well as a national site and therefore belongs to the entire Jewish population. Their efforts to challenge the current customs at the Wall and break the ritual status quo continues as they believe that the Wall is a holy place for all Jews. They repeatedly stress that the group is not Reform Jews, but come from all affiliations and that their conduct strictly adheres to Orthodox Jewish Law and that their prayer is genuine and not a political stunt. Their central mission is to "achieve the social and legal recognition of our right, as women, to wear prayer shawls, pray and read from the Torah collectively and out loud at the Western Wall."  The women have made progress and as of 1988, the women have held occasional, uninterrupted prayer services wearing tallitot and tefillin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reiter|first=Yitzhak|date=Winter 2016|title=Feminists in the Temple of Orthodoxy: The Struggle of the Women of the Wall to Change the Status Quo|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/613732|journal=Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies|volume=34|pages=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Israeli Orthodox establishment's position==
The Israeli Orthodox Jewish religious establishment is opposed to the services conducted by the Women of the Wall. Orthodox rabbis claim that even if such a manner of prayer is theoretically permitted by Jewish Law, it is against Jewish custom. Even if support can be found in Jewish legal sources for various activities, the force of custom is equal to absolute law and it is the custom which determines proper conduct. Various legal opinions recorded in Halacha cannot be manipulated to introduce new forms of prayer.&lt;ref name="Starr Sered 2010 638–9"&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2010|pp=638–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opinion of Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]], which is cited by Women of the Wall in support of their cause, is rejected by the establishment, as they view the Women of the Wall as being motivated by feminism rather than a sincere spiritual desire.&lt;ref&gt;Frimer, Arye and Dov, [http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/english/tfila/frimmer1.htm Women's Prayer Services Theory and Practice] ''Tradition'', 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Their struggle is also seen as an attempt to undermine their influence and as a strategy for non-Orthodox groups to gradually gain official recognition at state level, paving the way for the introduction of religious pluralism in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Price|2012|p=}}: "The Israeli Orthodox establishment view the Women of the Wall as being a Trojan horse to introduce Jewish pluralism and establish the Reform, Conservative, and Reconstructionist strains of Judaism in Israel."&lt;/ref&gt;  In a letter to the group, [[Yehuda Getz]], the government appointed rabbi of the Western Wall, urged them to stop "straying from the hallowed traditions of generations of Jews before you"&lt;ref name="Starr Sered 2010 638–9"/&gt; and in 1989, the Israeli Chief Rabbi [[Avraham Shapiro]] and the Religious Affairs Minister suggested that the women "pray individually, silently, and preferably at home-not at the wall."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2010|p=642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public response==
From the outset, the Women of the Wall have been subjected to heckling and abuse from male and female Orthodox worshipers. More recently, the extremists who oppose the Women of the Wall have been criticized by Israel's predominantly secular society, which objects not only to the religious extremists' harassment of Women of the Wall but attempts to ban mixing of genders in public places such buses and sidewalks.&lt;ref name="Washington Post"/&gt;

In 1996, UTJ MK [[Israel Eichler]] wrote: "No one prevents anyone else from praying at the wall in his own fashion, but the wall is the last place to carry out a battle for the right of a woman to wear a ''tallit'', read from the Torah, wear a ''kippa'' and grow a beard."&lt;ref name="Starr Sered 2000 138–9"&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2000|pp=138–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; MK [[Yaakov Litzman]] stated that "there is no desecration greater than that of women who come to desecrate the holiness of the Western Wall with all kinds of provocations such as carrying a Torah scroll and other things reserved by Jewish law only to men"&lt;ref name= LAT2000&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jun/05/news/mn-37770 Israeli Women Defy Custom, Say a Prayer for Equality], June 5, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Ovadia Yosef said: "There are stupid women who come to the Western Wall, put on a tallit (prayer shawl), and pray... These are deviants who serve equality, not Heaven. They must be condemned and warned of."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3801872,00.html|title=Rabbi Yosef condemns Women of the Wall|work=ynet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi [[Yosef Reinman]] suggested that it is "not religious need," but rather "religious politics" which motivates the woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hirsch|Reinman|2002|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent Orthodox women have also disapproved of the group. [[Nehama Leibowitz]] likened their worship to a form of "sport,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Unterman|2009|p=296}}: "Nehama rejected the argument that women's spiritual needs must be met more fully than convention currently allows. Shira Leibowitz Schmidt recalls that Nehama "unsympathetically labeled as "sport" the untraditional, demonstrative prayer by Women of the Wall..."&lt;/ref&gt; and the widow of  Sephardi Chief Rabbi [[Mordechai Eliyahu]] said the group had "gone completely mad" and their actions amount to "desecration."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/168688 Rabbanit Tzviya Eliyahu: Women of the Wall are 'Crazy'], ''Arutz Sheva'', (June 06, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Ultra-Orthodox former Jerusalem city councilwoman Mina Fenton said the women are "a fringe group that attracts people who read the prayer book upside down."&lt;ref name=USA10-05/&gt; The Religious Zionist leadership also voiced its concern in May 2013 when a group of influential rabbis issued a letter calling on public figures "not to let a small group offend the thousands of worshippers arriving to pray at this sacred place on a regular basis." They went on to state that "there are those who have been trying in recent years to change the present situation, offending many and tainting the special atmosphere of holiness of this sacred place."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4378184,00.html Zionist rabbis vs. Women of Wall], Kobi Nachshoni, ''ynet.com'' 9 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disapproval included a wide range of name-calling, with Women of the Wall being called "witches," "prostitutes," "weird," "childish," and "provocateurs," for wanting to pray in their fashion. The Israeli state and Ministry of Religion referred to Women of the Wall as "witches," who were doing "Satan's work"; "more like prostitutes than women"; "misled, tainted, by modern secular feminism."&lt;ref name="Chesler 1996"&gt;{{harvnb|Chesler|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet indifference and condemnation for the women's plight came from all sectors of Israeli society, not just from the religious right. Even liberals saw their actions as a "provocation,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raday|2009|p=231}}: "However, even academics, intellectuals, and journalists generally committed to a liberal point of view were overtly hostile to the WOW. In newspaper articles and public discussion, they claimed that their actions were a "provocation."&lt;/ref&gt; and women's organisations in Israel viewed their behaviour as "weird and objectionable."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Naveh|2003|p=130}}: "The WoW group has also failed to rally support from Israeli women's organizations: their struggle was and is still considered weird and objectionable."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hillel Halkin]] called them "childish provocateurs"&lt;ref&gt;Halkin, Hillel. (June 24, 2013). [http://forward.com/articles/179034/womens-prayer-protests-at-western-wall-are-just-ch/ Women's Prayer Protests at Western Wall Are Just Childish Provocation], ''Forward''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Itamar Ben Canaan|Ithamar Handelman-Smith]] wondered what the Women of the Wall wanted to achieve.&lt;ref&gt;Handelman-Smith, Ithamar. [http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/women-of-the-wall-what-do-you-want.premium-1.524057 Women of the Wall, what do you want?], ''Haaretz'', (May 14, 2013).: "I really don't get this Women of the Wall thing. Is it a tasteless joke, meaningless silliness or an effort to cause aggravation and anger? What's the point of Women of the Wall's praying? What do they hope to achieve beyond provocation, media exposure, ratings and the intoxication of power..."&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli society in general and the secular media were also initially unsympathetic to their cause,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|1999|p=217}}: "The secular newspapers have been antagonistic to the Women of the Wall, thus depriving them of a major social resource."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2001|p=203}}: "Still, secular newspaper reports, editors, and other public figures have also had their say. Interestingly, their stance has not been overly sympathetic to the Women of the Wall,..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robinson|Klotz|1989}}: "The Israeli secular public cannot see why this issue is important to us."&lt;/ref&gt; possibly reflecting a general hostility to feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Halperin-Kaddari|2004|p=170}}: "Significantly, there has been little sympathy or understanding in the media for the women's cause, perhaps expressing Israeli society's general hostility to feminist causes."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lahav|2000}}: "I fear that the general indifference at best, and hostility at worst, of the Jewish secular majority towards the Women of the Wall stems from the hostility to feminism in general. It has long been observed that feminism has not been kindly accepted in Israel."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Starr Sered|Susan Sered]] suggests the public saw the group as "symbolically desecrating Judaism's holiest site"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|1999|p=211}}: "The Women of the Wall are themselves seen as a symbol, symbolically desecrating Judaism's holiest site."&lt;/ref&gt; and claims that many in Israel saw the group as "American Reform interlopers trying to appropriate a state symbol of national identity."&lt;ref name="Starr Sered 2000 138–9"/&gt; Their demands were seen as radical and foreign to Israeli society&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Swirski|Safir|1991|p=16}}: "In the context of Israeli society, the demands of Women of the Wall represent unprecedented, radical demands. Jews in Israel, including the secular majority, generally accept the domination of Orthodoxy in religious matters, perhaps because they do not perceive it as meaningful to their daily lives."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lahav|2006|p=133}}: "In Israel of the early 1990s, which experienced the surge of religion and the rise of religious political power, WOW's action was perceived as radical and unacceptable."&lt;/ref&gt; and their actions "alienated Israelis of almost all political persuasions."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Starr Sered|2001|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, the women at first received minimal [[grass-roots]] support.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greenberg|1999|p=157}}: "There has not been as much grass-roots support in Israel for the Women of the Wall."&lt;/ref&gt;  Lahav explains that secular indifference results from an acceptance of the view espoused by the Orthodox establishment when it comes to religious issues&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lahav|2000}}: "A deeper reason has to do with the historical attitude of secular Zionism towards religion. From the perspective of the secular majority, Jewish religion is what the orthodox say it is. They fail to see in the women's fight a struggle to open up orthodoxy and make it more egalitarian; if they do, they do not consider it to be of any significance because they do not have an interest in religion anyway."&lt;/ref&gt; and that those on the [[Left-wing politics|Left]] of the political spectrum ignore the women in an attempt to gain Orthodox support for their dovish positions on the Arab-Israeli conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lahav|2000}}: "Politically, the secular majority is interested in the orthodox sector only in as much as it can support their views concerning the peace process. The Left is impatient with the Women of the Wall because they pose yet another obstacle on the road to some Orthodox support of the dovish resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The Right supports the orthodox (against the women) because it wishes to strengthen its bond with the religious sector, thereby guaranteeing more support for it hawkish opposition to the formula of land for peace."&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular support for the women initially came mainly from Reform and Liberal communities in North America. In 1990, the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]] encouraged its members to support Women of the Wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stevens|1990|p=160}}: "Therefore be, it resolved that the CCAR encourage its members and their constituencies to support the Women of the Wall by writing to the Ministers of Religion and Justice, the Prime Minister, the Chief rabbis, public figures, and President of Israel about... b) Women having the option of joining prayer groups at the Wall."&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the [[Union for Reform Judaism]] declared it "warmly commends the Women of the Wall for its courageous and principled struggle to be allowed to pray at the Western Wall" and urged Reform congregations to "express solidarity with the Women of the Wall in appropriate ways."&lt;ref&gt;[http://urj.org//about/union/governance/reso//?syspage=article&amp;item_id=1945 In Support of Women of the Wall], URJ, (June 4, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, a number of non-Orthodox gatherings and services have been held publicly in America in solidarity with the Women of the Wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/132071/nyc-prayer-service-supports-women-of-the-wall NYC Prayer Service Supports Women of the Wall], ''Tablet, (May 10, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the Reform movement, WOW has faced both support and criticism. Rabbi [[Gilad Kariv]], who is considered the leader of the Reform movement in Israel, argued that WOW's request of 11 hours a year{{clarify|date=December 2017}} did not indicate an urgency that required a change in policy, but he came to support WOW's goals because they align with the Reform movement's opposition to the exclusion of women from religious society in Israel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

By 2013, however, about half of Israeli Jews approved of Women of the Wall and their mission, with the greatest support coming from educated Ashkenazi Jews. Pollsters for the Israeli Democracy Institute (IDI) and Tel Aviv University surveyed Jews in Israel and found that a clear majority, 64%, of those who defined themselves as secular, and 53% of those who described themselves as traditional but not religious supported the right of Women of the Wall to worship in their fashion. A minority of those who described themselves as traditional religious or Ultra-Orthodox approved. The results showed that overall,  51.8% of men and 46% of women supported Women of the Wall and their right to pray in their fashion at the Wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/almost-half-of-israeli-jews-back-women-of-the-wall/ Almost half of Israeli Jews back Women of the Wall] Times of Israel, May 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly opinions==
Some Jewish feminist activists in Israel have seen the Women of the Wall's activities as being inconsistent with their political activities. Leah Shakdiel of the anti-war group [[Women in Black]] describes the Wall as "all maleness and war."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raday|2007|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shakdiel maintains that Israeli society's general opposition to the Women of the Wall is a result of a religious and secular alliance against what they perceive as a feminist challenge. Ran Hirschl believes the conflict is "a contest for cultural hegemony between a secularist-libertarian elite and traditionally peripheral group," namely the ultra-Orthodox community. [[Frances Raday]] posits that the violent opposition by Orthodox Jews stems from the "desire of the Orthodox establishment to preserve religious patriarchal hegemony against the challenge of religious feminism," rather than an attempt to preserve Jewish Law itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raday|2007|p=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phyllis Chesler]] of Women of the Wall wrote: "We asked for our rights under civil and religious law. When we prayed, other worshipers, both men and women, verbally and physically assaulted us. We asked the Israeli state to protect us so that we could exercise our rights. The state claimed it could not contain the violence against us, and that we ourselves had provoked the violence by "disturbing/offending" the "sensibilities of Jews at worship." Women are not seen as "Jews" or as "worshipers" with "sensibilities."&lt;ref name="Chesler 1996"/&gt;

{{Chinese folk religion}}
'''''Wu''''' ({{zh|c=巫|p=''wū''|w=''wu''|l=[[shaman]]}}) are spirit mediums who have practiced divination, prayer, sacrifice, rainmaking, and healing in Chinese traditions dating back over 3,000 years.

==The word ''wu''==
The [[Chinese language|Chinese]] word ''wu'' {{linktext|巫}} "spirit medium; shaman; shamaness; sorcerer; doctor; proper names" was first recorded during the [[Shang Dynasty]] (ca. 1600–1046 BCE), when a ''wu'' could be of either sex. During the late [[Zhou Dynasty]] (1045-256 BCE) ''wu'' was used to specify "female shaman; sorceress" as opposed to ''xi'' 覡 "male shaman; sorcerer" (which first appears in the 4th century BCE [[Guoyu (book)|''Guoyu'']]). Other sex-differentiated shaman names include ''nanwu'' 男巫 for "male shaman; sorcerer; wizard"; and ''nüwu'' 女巫, ''wunü'' 巫女, ''wupo'' 巫婆, and ''wuyu'' 巫嫗 for "female shaman; sorceress; witch".

''Wu'' is used in compounds like ''[[Gu (poison)|wugu]]'' 巫蠱 "sorcery; cast harmful spells", ''wushen'' 巫神 or ''shenwu'' 神巫 (with [[Shen (Chinese religion)|''shen'']] "spirit; god") "wizard; sorcerer", and ''wuxian'' 巫仙 (with [[Xian (Taoism)|''xian'']] "immortal; alchemist") "immortal shaman".

The word ''[[Tongji (spirit medium)|tongji]]'' 童乩 (lit. "youth diviner") "shaman; spirit-medium" is a near-synonym of ''wu''. Chinese uses phonetic [[transliteration into Chinese characters|transliteration]] to distinguish native ''wu'' from "[[Shamanism in Siberia|Siberian shaman]]": ''saman'' 薩滿 or ''saman'' 薩蠻. "Shaman" is occasionally written with Chinese Buddhist transcriptions of [[Shramana]] "wandering monk; ascetic": ''shamen'' 沙門, ''sangmen'' 桑門, or ''sangmen'' 喪門.

[[Joseph Needham]] (1954:134) suggests "shaman" was transliterated ''xianmen'' 羨門 in the name of [[Zou Yan]]'s disciple Xianmen Gao 羨門高 (or Zigao 子高). He quotes the ''[[Shiji]]'' that Emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]] (r. 221–210 BCE), "wandered about on the shore of the eastern sea, and offered sacrifices to the famous mountains and the great rivers and the eight Spirits; and searched for ''[[Xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' "immortals", [''xianmen''], and the like." Needham (1954:134) compares two later Chinese terms for "shaman": ''shanman'' 珊蛮, which described the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] leader [[Wanyan Xiyin]], and ''sizhu'' 司祝, which was used for imperial [[Manchu]] shamans during the [[Qing Dynasty]].

===Translations===
''Shaman'' is the common English translation of Chinese ''wu'', but some scholars (de Groot 1910, Mair 1990:35) maintain that the Siberian ''shaman'' and Chinese ''wu'' were historically and culturally different shamanic traditions. [[Arthur Waley]] (1955:9) defines ''wu'' as "spirit-intermediary" and says, "Indeed the functions of the Chinese ''wu'' were so like those of Siberian and Tunguz shamans that it is convenient (as has indeed been done by Far Eastern and European writers) to use shaman as a translation of ''wu''. In contrast, Schiffeler (1976:20) describes the "untranslatableness" of ''wu'', and prefers using the romanization "''wu'' instead of its contemporary English counterparts, "witches," "warlocks," or "shamans"," which have misleading connotations. Taking ''wu'' to mean "female shaman", [[Edward H. Schafer]] translates it as (1951:153) "shamaness" and (1980:11) "shamanka". The transliteration-translation "''wu'' shaman" or "''wu''-shaman" (Unschuld 1985:344) implies "Chinese" specifically and "shamanism" generally. ''Wu'', concludes Falkenhausen (1995:280), "may be rendered as "shaman" or, perhaps, less controversially as "spirit medium"." Paper (1995:85) criticizes "the majority of scholars" who use one word ''shaman'' to translate many Chinese terms (''wu'' 巫, ''xi'' 覡, ''yi'' 毉, ''xian'' 仙, and ''zhu'' 祝), and writes, "The general tendency to refer to all ecstatic religious functionaries as shamans blurs functional differences."

===Pronunciations===
The [[Modern Standard Chinese]] pronunciation of 巫 is ''wu'', which [[historical Chinese phonology|phonologically]] descends from (ca. 6th century CE) [[Middle Chinese]] and (ca. 6th century BCE) [[Old Chinese]]. Compare these Middle and Old Chinese reconstructions of ''wu'' 巫: ''m&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;u'' &lt; *''m&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;wo'' ([[Bernhard Karlgren]]), ''mjuo'' &lt; *''{{IPA|mjwaɣ}}'' (Zhou Fagao), *''mjag'' ([[Li Fanggui]]), ''mju'' &lt; *''ma'' (Axel Schuessler), and *''m&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;ag'' ([[Victor H. Mair]]) . Linguists disagree whether ''wu'' had an Old Chinese [[velar]] final ''-g'' or ''-ɣ''. This 巫 is pronounced ''mouh'' in [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]], ''vu'' in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], ''mu'' in [[Korean language|Korean]], and ''fu'' or ''[[miko]]'' in [[Japanese language|Japanese]].

===Characters===

The contemporary [[Chinese character]] [[Wikt:巫|巫]] for ''wu'' combines the graphic [[Radical (Chinese character)|radicals]] ''gong'' [[Wikt:工|工]] "work" and ''ren'' [[Wikt:人|人]] "person" doubled (cf. ''cong'' [[Wikt:从|从]]). This 巫 character developed from [[Seal script]] characters that depicted dancing shamans, which descend from [[Bronzeware script]] and [[Oracle bone script]] characters that resembled a [[cross potent]].

The first [[Chinese dictionary]] of characters, the (121 CE) ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' defines ''wu'' as ''zhu'' [[Wikt:祝|祝]] "sacrifice; prayer master; invoker; priest" (祝也 女能以舞降神者也 象从工 两人舞形, tr. Hopkins 1920:432) and analyzes the Seal graph, "An Invoker. A woman who can serve the Invisible, and by posturing bring down the spirits. Depicts a person with two sleeves posturing."  This Seal graph for ''wu'' is interpreted as showing "the 工 work of two dancing figures set to each other – a shamanistic dance" (Karlgren 1923:363) or "two human figures facing some central object (possibly a pole, or in a tent-like enclosure?)" (Schafer 1951:153).

This dictionary also includes a variant [[Great Seal script]] (called a ''guwen'' "ancient script") that elaborates ''wu'' 巫.  Hopkins (1920:433) analyzes this ''guwen'' graph as ''gong'' 廾 "two hands held upward" at the bottom (like ''shi'' 筮's Seal graph) and two "mouths" with the "sleeves" on the sides; or (1920:424) "jade" because the ''Shuowen'' defines ''ling'' 靈 "spiritual; divine" as synonymous with ''wu'' and depicting (巫以玉事神, tr. Hopkins 1920:424), "an inspired shaman serving the Spirits with jade."

Schafer (1951:154) compares the Shang Dynasty oracle graphs for ''wu'' and ''nong'' [[Wikt:弄|弄]] "play with; cause" (written with 玉 "jade" over 廾 "two hands") that shows "hands (of a shaman?) elevating a piece of jade (the rain-compelling mineral) inside an enclosure, possibly a tent. The Seal and modern form 巫 may well derive from this original, the hands becoming two figures, a convergence towards the dancer-type graph."

Tu Baikui 塗白奎 (quoted by Boileau 2002:354) believes the ''wu'' oracle character "was composed of two pieces of jade and originally designated a tool of divination." Citing Li Xiaoding 李孝定 that ''gong'' 工 originally pictured a "carpenter's square", Allan (1991:77) argues that oracle inscriptions used ''wu'' 巫 interchangeably with ''fang'' [[Wikt:方|方]] "square; side; place" for sacrifices to the ''sifang'' 四方 "four directions".

This 巫 component is semantically significant in several characters:
*''wu'' [[Wikt:誣|誣]] (with the "speech radical" 言) "deceive; slander; falsely accuse"
*''shi'' [[Wikt:筮|筮]] (with the "bamboo radical" 竹) "[[Achillea millefolium]] (used for divination)"
*''xi'' [[Wikt:覡|覡]] (with the "vision radical" 見) "male shaman; male sorcerer"
*''ling'' [[Wikt:靈|靈]] (with the "cloud radical" 雨 and three 口 "mouths" or "raindrops") "spirit; divine; clever"
*''yi'' [[Wikt:毉|毉]] "doctor", which is an old "shaman" [[Variant Chinese character|variant character]] for ''yi'' [[Wikt:醫|醫]] (with the "wine radical" 酉)

===Meanings===
The comprehensive ''[[Hanyu Da Zidian]]'' dictionary (1989 1:412) lists five meanings of ''wu'' 巫, translatable as:
#"[[Mediumship|spirit medium]]; [[shaman]]; [[Witchcraft|witch]]; [[Magician (paranormal)|wizard]]"
#"[[witch doctor]]; [[medicine man]]"
#"mountain name"
#"[[Toponym|place name]]"
#"[[Wu (surname)|surname]]"
The former two "shaman" and "doctor" ''wu'' meanings are discussed below in detail. The latter three "[[proper name]]" meanings of apply to mountains, places, and people. ''[[Wushan County, Chongqing|Wushan]]'' [[Wikt:|巫山]] "Wu Mountain" is located near [[Chongqing]] in [[Sichuan]] Province. In Chinese, it is known through the [[Chengyu|four-character idiom]] ''Wushanyunyu'' 巫山雲雨 (with "clouds and rain") "lovers' rendezvous; coitus" (for example, see ''[[Rain Clouds over Wushan]]''). In English, Wu Mountain is known as the archeological site where [[Wushan Man]] "taxon of ''[[Homo erectus]]''" was discovered. Two nearby place names are ''[[Wuxi County|Wuxi]]'' 巫溪 (Wu Stream) and ''[[Wu Gorge]]'' (Wuxia 巫峽), which is in the [[Yangtze River]]'s [[Three Gorges]] region. The [[Chinese surname]] ''Wu'' goes back to the Shang Dynasty (for example, legendary [[Wu Xian (astronomer)|Wu Xian]] 巫咸), but is comparatively uncommon today (but does appear, for example, in the name of recording artist Wu Qixian 巫啟賢 "[[Eric Moo]]"). Wuma 巫馬 (lit. "shaman horse") is both a [[Chinese compound surname]] (for example, the Confucian disciple [[Disciples of Confucius#Wuma Shi|Wuma Shi/Qi]] 巫馬施/期) and a name for "horse shaman; equine veterinarian" (for example, the ''Zhouli'' official).

===Etymologies===
[[Historical linguistics|Historical linguists]] hypothetically connect the [[etymology]] of Chinese ''wu'' "spirit medium; shaman" not only with [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] languages, but also with [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]], [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]], [[Mon–Khmer languages|Mon–Khmer]], [[Turkic languages|Turkic]], and [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] language groups.

[[Berthold Laufer]] (1917:370) proposed a relation between [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] ''bügä'' "shaman", [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''bögü'' "shaman", "Chinese ''bu'', ''wu'' (shaman), ''buk'', ''puk'' (to divine), and [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] ''aba'' (pronounced ''ba'', sorcerer)".

Coblin (1986:107) puts forward a Sino-Tibetan root **''{{IPA|mjaɣ}}'' "magician; sorcerer" for Chinese ''wu'' &lt; ''mju'' &lt; *''mjag'' 巫 "magician; shaman" and [[Tibetan script|Written Tibetan]]'' 'ba'-po'' "sorcerer" and'' 'ba'-mo'' "sorcereress" (of the [[Bön]] religion).

Schuessler (2007:516) notes Chinese ''xian'' &lt; ''sjän'' &lt; *''sen'' [[仙]] "transcendent; immortal; alchemist" was probably borrowed as Written Tibetan ''gšen'' "shaman" and [[Thai language|Thai]] {{IPA-th|mɔɔ|}} &lt; Proto-Tai *''{{IPA|hmɔ}}'' "doctor; sorcerer". In addition, the [[Mon–Khmer languages|Mon–Khmer]] and Proto-Western-Austronesian  *''{{IPA|səmaŋ}}'' "shaman" may also be connected with ''wu''. Schuessler lists four proposed etymologies.

First, ''wu'' could be the same word as ''wu'' 誣 "to deceive" (Karlgren 1923:363). Schuessler notes a Written Tibetan semantic parallel between "magical power" and "deceive": ''sprul-ba'' "to juggle, make phantoms; miraculous power" cognate with {{IPA-bo|pʰrul|}} "magical deception".

[[File:Tomb brick g.JPG|thumb|Han Dynasty tomb-tile showing "long-sleeved dancers" and attendants.]]
Second, ''wu'' could be cognate with ''wu'' [[Wikt:舞|舞]] "to dance". Based on analysis of ancient characters, Hopkins (1920, 1945) proposed that ''wu'' 巫 "shaman", ''wu'' [[Wikt:無|無]] "not have; without", and ''wu'' 舞 "dance", "can all be traced back to one primitive figure of a man displaying by the gestures of his arms and legs the [[thaumaturgic]] powers of his inspired personality" (1945:5). Many Western Han Dynasty tombs contained jade plaques or pottery images showing "long-sleeved dancers" performing at funerals, who Erickson (1994:52-54) identifies as shamans, citing the ''Shuowen jiezi'' that early ''wu'' characters depicted a dancer's sleeves.

Third, ''wu'' could also be cognate with ''mu'' 母 "mother" since ''wu'', as opposed to ''xi'' 覡, were typically female. [[Edward H. Schafer|Edward Schafer]] associates ''wu'' shamanism with fertility rituals.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Linguistic facts reveal the intimate relationships between the word ''wu'' (*''myu'') "shamanka" and such words as "mother", "dance", "fertility", "egg", and "receptacle". The ancient shamanka, then, was closely related to the fecund mother, to the fertile soil, to the receptive earth. The textual evidence supports these philological associations. In Shang and Chou times, shamankas were regularly employed in the interests of human and natural fertility, above all in bringing rain to parched farmlands – a responsibility they shared with ancient kings. They were musicians and dancers and oracles. (1973:10) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Jensen (1995:421) cites the Japanese sinologist Shirakawa Shizuka 白川静's hypothesis that the mother of [[Confucius]] was a ''wu''.

[[Image:Cross-Potent-Heraldry.svg|thumb|Cross potent]]
Fourth, ''wu'' could be a loanword from [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] *''maguš'' "magi; magician" (cf. [[Old Persian]] ''maguš'', [[Avestan language|Avestan]] ''mogu''), meaning an "able one; specialist in ritual". Mair (1990) provides archaeological and linguistic evidence that Chinese ''wu'' &lt; *''m&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;ag'' 巫 "shaman; witch, wizard; magician" was a [[loanword]] from [[Old Persian]] *''maguš'' "magician; [[magi]]".

Mair connects the nearly identical Chinese Bronze script for ''wu'' 巫 (above) and Western [[heraldic]] [[cross potent]] '''☩''', an ancient symbol of a ''magi'' or ''magician'', for which both words were ultimately borrowed from the same Iranian word.&lt;ref&gt;Victor H. Mair, “The Earliest Identifiable Written Chinese Character”, ''Archaeology and Language: Indo-European Studies Presented to James P. Mallory'', eds. Martin E. Huld, Karlene Jones-Bley &amp; Dean Miller (Washington, D.C.: Institute for the Study of Man, 2012), 265–279.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early records of ''wu''==
The oldest written records of ''wu'' are Shang Dynasty oracle inscriptions and Zhou Dynasty classical texts. Boileau notes the disparity of these sources.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Concerning the historical origin of the ''wu'', we may ask: were they a remnant of an earlier stage of the development of archaic Chinese civilization? The present state of the documentation does not allow such a conclusion for two reasons: first, the most abundant data about the ''wu'' are to be found in Eastern Zhou texts; and, second, these texts have little in common with the data originating directly from the Shang civilization; possible ancestors of the Eastern Zhou ''wu'' are the cripples and the females burned in sacrifice to bring about rain. They are mentioned in the oracular inscriptions but there is no mention of the Shang character ''wu''. Moreover, because of the scarcity of information, many of the activities of the Zhou ''wu'' cannot be traced back to the Shang period. Consequently, trying to correlate Zhou data with Neolithic cultures appears very difficult. (2002:376) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Wu'' in Shang oracular inscriptions===
Shima's (1971:418) concordance of oracle inscriptions lists 58 occurrences of the character ''wu'': 32 in repeated compounds (most commonly 巫帝 "''wu'' spirit/sacrifice" and 氐巫 "bring the ''wu'') and 26 in miscellaneous contexts. Boileau (2002:354-5) differentiates four meanings of these oracular ''wu'':
#"a spirit, ''wu'' of the north or east, to which sacrifices are offered"
#"a sacrifice, possibly linked to controlling the wind or meteorology"
#"an equivalent for ''shi'' 筮, a form of divination using achilea"
#"a living human being, possibly the name of a person, tribe, place, or territory"
The inscriptions about this living ''wu'', which is later identified as "shaman", reveal six characteristics:&lt;blockquote&gt;
#whether the ''wu'' is a man or a woman is not known;
#it could be either the name for a function or the name of a people (or an individual) coming from a definite territory or nation;
#the wu seems to have been in charge of some divinations, (in one instance, divination is linked to a sacrifice of appeasement);
#the wu is seen as offering a sacrifice of appeasement but the inscription and the fact that this kind of sacrifice was offered by other persons (the king included) suggests that the ''wu'' was not the person of choice to conduct all the sacrifices of appeasement;
#there is only one inscription where a direct link between the king and the ''wu'' appears. Nevertheless, the nature of the link is not known, because the status of the ''wu'' does not appear clearly;
#he follows (being brought, presumably, to Shang territory or court) the orders of other people; he is perhaps offered to the Shang as a tribute. (Boileau 2002:355) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Based on this ancient but limited Shang-era oracular record, it is unclear how or whether the ''Wu'' spirit, sacrifice, person, and place were related.

===''Wu'' in Zhou received texts===
Chinese ''wu'' 巫 "shaman" occurs over 300 times in the [[Chinese classics]], which generally date from the late Zhou and early Han periods (6th-1st centuries BCE). The following examples are categorized by the common specializations of ''wu''-shamans:
&lt;blockquote&gt;men and women possessed by spirits or gods, and consequently acting as seers and soothsayers, exorcists and physicians; invokers or conjurers bringing down gods at sacrifices, and performing other sacerdotal functions, occasionally indulging also in imprecation, and in sorcery with the help of spirits. (De Groot 1910 6:1212) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

A single text can describe many roles for ''wu''-shamans. For instance, the ''[[Guoyu (book)|Guoyu]]'' idealizes their origins in a [[Golden Age]]. It contains a story about [[King Zhao of Chu|King Zhao]] of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] (r. 515-489 BCE) reading in the ''Shujing'' that the sage ruler [[Shun (Chinese leader)|Shun]] "commissioned Chong and Li to cut the communication between heaven and earth". He asks his minister to explain and is told.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Anciently, men and spirits did not intermingle. At that time there were certain persons who were so perspicacious, single-minded, and reverential that their understanding enabled them to make meaningful collation of what lies above and below, and their insight to illumine what is distant and profound. Therefore the spirits would descend upon them. The possessors of such powers were, if men, called ''xi'' (shamans), and, if women, ''wu'' (shamanesses). It is they who supervised the positions of the spirits at the ceremonies, sacrificed to them, and otherwise handled religious matters. As a consequence, the spheres of the divine and the profane were kept distinct. The spirits sent down blessings on the people, and accepted from them their offerings. There were no natural calamities.
:In the degenerate time of &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Shaohao]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (traditionally put at the twenty-sixth century B.C.), however, the Nine Li threw virtue into disorder. Men and spirits became intermingled, with each household indiscriminately performing for itself the religious observances which had hitherto been conducted by the shamans. As a consequence, men lost their reverence for the spirits, the spirits violated the rules of men, and natural calamities arose. Hence the successor of [Shaohao], &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Zhuanxu]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;..., charged &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Chong&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, Governor of the South, to handle the affairs of heaven in order to determine the proper place of the spirits, and Li, Governor of Fire, to handle the affairs of Earth, in order to determine the proper place of men. And such is what is meant by cutting the communication between Heaven and Earth. (tr. Bodde 1961:390-391) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Wu-shamans as healers====
The belief that [[demonic possession]] caused disease and sickness is well documented in many cultures, including ancient China. The early practitioners of [[Traditional Chinese Medicine|Chinese medicine]] historically changed from ''wu'' 巫 "spirit-mediums; shamans" who used divination, exorcism, and prayer to ''yi'' 毉 or 醫 "doctors; physicians" who used herbal medicine, [[moxibustion]], and [[acupuncture]].

As mentioned above, ''wu'' 巫 "shaman" was depicted in the ancient 毉 variant character for ''yi'' 醫 "healer; doctor". This archaic ''yi'' 毉, writes Carr (1992:117), "ideographically depicted a shaman-doctor in the act of exorcistical healing with (矢 'arrows' in) a 医 'quiver', a 殳 'hand holding a lance', and a ''wu'' 巫 'shaman'." Unschuld believes this 毉 character depicts the type of ''wu'' practitioner described in the ''Liji''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Several times a year, and also during certain special occasions, such as the funeral of a prince, hordes of exorcists would race shrieking through the city streets, enter the courtyards and homes, thrusting their spears into the air, in an attempt to expel the evil creatures. Prisoners were dismembered outside all gates to the city, to serve both as a deterrent to the demons and as an indication of their fate should they be captured. (1985:37) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Replacing the exorcistical 巫 "shaman" in 毉 with medicinal 酒 "wine" in ''yi'' 醫 "healer; doctor" signified, writes Schiffeler (1976:27), "the practice of medicine was not any longer confined to the incantations of the ''wu'', but that it had been taken over (from an official standpoint) by the "priest-physicians," who administered elixirs or wines as treatments for their patients."
[[File:iching-hexagram-32.svg|thumb|Hexagram 32, ''Heng'' 恆]]
''Wu'' and ''yi'' are compounded in the word ''wuyi'' 巫醫 "shaman-doctor; shamans and doctors", translated "exorcising physician" (De Groot 1910), "sorcerer-physician" (Schiffeler 1976), or "physician-shaman" (Mainfort 2004). Confucius quotes a "Southern Saying" that a good ''wuyi'' must have ''heng'' [[Wikt:恆|恆]] "constancy; ancient tradition; continuation; perseverance; regularity; proper name (e.g., ''Yijing'' [[I Ching hexagram 32#Hexagram 32|Hexagram 32]])". The (ca. 5th century BCE) ''[[Lunyu]]'' "Confucian Analects" and the (ca. 1st century BCE) ''[[Liji]]'' "Record of Rites" give different versions of the Southern Saying.

First, the ''Lunyu'' quotes Confucius to mention the saying and refer to the Heng Hexagram:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Master said, The men of the south have a saying, Without stability a man will not even make a good shaman or witch-doctor. Well said! Of the maxim; if you do not stabilize an act of ''te'' 德, you will get evil by it (instead of good), the Master said, They (i.e. soothsayers) do not simply read the omens. (13/22, tr. Waley 1938:77) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Confucius refers to a ''Yijing'' line interpretation of the Heng "Duration" Hexagram (tr. Wilhelm 1967:127-9): "Nine in the third place means: He who does not give duration to his character meets with disgrace." In Waley's earlier article about the ''Yijing'', he translated "If you do not stabilize your "virtue," Disgrace will overtake you", and quoted the ''Lunyu''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The people of the south have a saying, 'It takes ''heng'' to make even a soothsayer or medicine-man.' It's quite true. 'If you do not stabilize your virtue, disgrace will overtake you'." Confucius adds 不占而已矣, which has completely baffled his interpreters. Surely the meaning is 'It is not enough merely to get an omen,' one must also ''heng'' 'stabilize it'. And if such a rule applies even to inferior arts like those of the diviner and medicine-man, Confucius asks, how much the more does it apply to the seeker after [''de''] in the moral sense? Surely he too must 'make constant' his initial striving! (1933:136-137)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Second, the ''Liji'' quotes Confucius to elaborate upon the Southern Saying.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Master said, 'The people of the south have a saying that "A man without constancy cannot be a diviner either with the tortoise-shell or the stalks." This was probably a saying handed down from antiquity. If such a man cannot know the tortoise-shell and stalks, how much less can he know other men? It is said in the ''Book of Poetry'' (II, v, ode 1, 3) "Our tortoise-shells are wearied out, And will not tell us anything about the plans." The Charge to [Yue] says ([''Shujing''], IV, VIII, sect. 2, 5, 11), "Dignities should not be conferred on men of evil practices. (If they be), how can the people set themselves to correct their ways? If this be sought merely by sacrifices, it will be disrespectful (to the spirits). When affairs come to be troublesome, there ensues disorder; when the spirits are served so, difficulties ensue." 'It is said in the [''Yijing''], "When one does not continuously maintain his virtue, some will impute it to him as a disgrace; (in the position indicated in the Hexagram.) 'When one does maintain his virtue continuously (in the other position indicated), this will be fortunate in a wife, but in a husband evil'." (55, tr. Legge 1885 2:363-364) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This ''Liji'' version makes five changes from the ''Lunyu'' (Carr 1992:121-122). (1) It writes ''bushi'' 卜筮 "diviner" instead of ''wuyi'' 巫醫 "shaman-doctor", compounding ''bu'' "divine by bone or shell, [[scapulimancy]] or [[plastromancy]]" and ''shi'' (also with "shaman") "divine by milfoil stalks, [[cleromancy]] or sortilege". (2) Instead of quoting Confucius to remark "well said!"; he describes the southern proverb as "probably a saying handed down from antiquity" and rhetorically questions the efficacy of divination. (3) The ''Liji'' correctly quotes the ''Shijing'' (195, tr. Karlgren 1950:142) criticizing royal diviners: "Our tortoises are (satiated =) weary, they do not tell us the (proper) plans." (4) It quotes the "Charge to Yue" 說命 (traditionally attributed to Shang king [[Wu Ding]]) differently from the fabricated ''Guwen'' "[[Old Texts]]" ''[[Shujing]]'' "Classic of History" chapter with this name.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Dignities may not be conferred on man of evil practices, but only on men of worth. Anxious thought about what will be good should precede your movements. Your movements also should have respect to the time for them. … Officiousness in sacrifices is called irreverence; ceremonies when burdensome lead to disorder. To serve the spirits in this way is difficult. (17, tr. Legge 1865:256-8)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
(5) It cites an additional ''Yijing'' Hexagram 32 line (tr. Wilhelm 1967:129) that gender determines the auspiciousness of ''heng''. "Six in the fifth place means: Giving duration to one's character through perseverance. This is good fortune for a woman, misfortune for a man."

The mytho-geography ''[[Shanhaijing]]'' "Classic of Mountains and Seas" associates ''wu''-shamans with medicinal herbs.
&lt;blockquote&gt;East of the Openbright there are Shaman Robust, Shaman Pushaway, Shaman Sunny, Shaman Shoe, Shaman Every, and Shaman Aide. They are all on each side of the corpse of Notch Flaw and they hold the neverdie drug to ward off decay. (tr. Birrell 2000:141) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is Mount Divinepower. This is where Shaman Whole, Shaman Reach, Shaman Share, Shaman Robust, Shaman Motherinlaw, Shaman Real, Shaman Rite, Shaman Pushaway, ShamanTakeleave, and Shaman Birdnet ascend to the sky and come down from Mount Divinepower. This is where the hundred drugs are to be found. (tr. Birrell 2000:174) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
"Shaman Whole" translates [[Wu Xian (astronomer)|Wu Xian]] 巫咸 below.

Boileau contrasts Siberian and Chinese shamanic medicines.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Concerning healing, a comparison of the ''wu'' and the Siberian shaman shows a big difference: in Siberia, the shaman is also in charge of cures and healing, but he does this by identifying the spirit responsible for the disease and negotiates the proper way to appease him (or her), for example by offering a sacrifice or food on a regular basis. In archaic China, this role is performed through sacrifice: exorcism by the ''wu'' does not seem to result in a sacrifice but is aimed purely and simply at expelling the evil spirit. (2002:361) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Wu-shamans as rainmakers====
''Wu'' anciently served as intermediaries with [[nature spirit]]s believed to control rainfall and flooding. During a [[drought]], ''wu''-shamans would perform the ''yu'' [[Wikt:雩|雩]] "sacrificial [[rain dance]] ceremony". If that failed, both ''wu'' and ''wang'' [[Wikt:尪|尪]] "cripple; lame person; emaciated person" engaged in "ritual exposure" (Schafer 1951) [[rainmaking]] techniques based upon [[homeopathic]] or [[sympathetic magic]]. As Unschuld (1985:33-34) explains, "Shamans had to carry out an exhausting dance within a ring of fire until, sweating profusely, the falling drops of perspirations produced the desired rain." These ''wu'' and ''wang'' procedures were called ''pu'' [[Wikt:曝|曝]]/[[Wikt:暴|暴]] "expose to open air/sun", ''fen'' [[Wikt:焚|焚]] "burn; set on fire", and ''pulu'' [[Wikt:暴露|暴露]] "reveal; lay bare; expose to open air/sun".

For the year 639 BCE, the ''Chunqiu'' records, "In summer, there was a great drought" in [[State of Lu|Lu]], and the ''Zuozhuan'' notes a discussion about ''fen wu wang'' 焚巫尪:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The duke (Xi) wanted to burn a ''wu'' and a cripple at the stake. [[Zang Wenzhong]] 臧文仲 said: this is no preparation for the drought. Repair the city walls, limit your food, be economic in your consumption, be parsimonious and advise (people) to share (the food), this is what must be done. What use would be ''wu'' and cripple? If Heaven wanted to have them killed, why were they born at all? If they (the cripple and the ''wu'') could produce drought, burning them would augment very much (the disaster). (tr. Boileau 2002:363, cf. Legge 1872:180) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The duke followed this advice, and subsequently "scarcity was not very great".

The ''Liji'' uses the words ''puwang'' 暴尪 and ''puwu'' 暴巫 to describe a similar rainmaking ritual during the reign (407-375 BCE) of Duke Mu 穆公 of Lu.
&lt;blockquote&gt;There was a drought during the year. Duke Mu called on Xianzi and asked him about the reason for this. He said: 'Heaven has not (given us) rain in a long time. I want to expose to the sun a cripple and what about that?' (Xianzi) said: 'Heaven has not (given us) rain in a long time but to expose to the sun the crippled son of somebody, that would be cruel. No, this cannot be allowed.' (the duke said): 'Well, then I want to expose to the sun a ''wu'' and what about that?' (Xianzi) answered: 'Heaven has not (given us) rain in a long time but to put one's hope on an ignorant woman and offer her to pray (for rain), no, this is too far (from reason).' (tr. Boileau 2002:364, cf. Legge 1885 1:201) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Commentators interpret the ''wu'' as a female shaman and the ''wang'' as a male cripple.

De Groot connects the ''Zuozhuan'' and ''Liji'' stories about ritually burning ''wu''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;These two narratives evidently are different readings of one, and may both be inventions; nevertheless they have their value as sketches of ancient idea and custom. Those 'infirm or unsound' ''wang'' were non-descript individuals, evidently placed somewhat on a line with the ''wu''; perhaps they were queer hags or beldams, deformed beings, idiotic or crazy, or nervously affected to a very high degree, whose strange demeanour was ascribed to possession. (1910 6:1194) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Wu-shamans as oneiromancers====
[[Oneiromancy]] or [[dream interpretation]] was one type of divination performed by ''wu'' 巫. The ''Zuozhuan'' records two stories about ''wu'' interpreting the guilty dreams of murderers.

First, in 581 BCE the lord of [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]], who had slain two officers from the [[Zhao (surname)|Zhao]] (趙) family, had a nightmare about their ancestral spirit, and called upon an unnamed ''wu'' "shaman" from Sangtian 桑田 and a ''yi'' "doctor" named Huan 緩 from [[Qin (state)|Qin]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;The marquis of [Jin] saw in a dream a great demon with disheveled hair reaching to the ground, which beat its breast, and leaped up, saying: "You have slain my descendants unrighteously, and I have presented my request to the High God in consequence." It then broke the great gate (of the palace), advanced to the gate of the State chamber, and entered. The duke was afraid and went into a side-chamber, the door of which it also broke. The duke then awoke, and called the witch of [Sangtian], who told him everything which he had dreamt. "What will be the issue?" asked the duke. "You will not taste the new wheat," she replied. &lt;br&gt;
After this, the duke became very ill, and asked the services of a physician from [Qin], the earl of which sent the physician [Huan] to do what he could for him. Before he came, the duke dreamt that his disease turned into two boys, who said, "That is a skilful physician; it is to be feared he will hurt us; how shall we get out of his way?" Then one of them said: "If we take our place above the heart and below the throat, what can he do to us?" When the physician arrived, he said, "Nothing can be done for this disease. Its seat is above the heart and below the throat. If I assail it (with medicine), it will be of no use; if I attempt to puncture it, it cannot be reached. Nothing can be done for it." The duke said, "He is a skilful physician", gave him large gifts, and send him back to [Qin].&lt;br&gt;
In the sixth month, on the day [bingwu], the marquis wished to taste the new wheat, and made the superintendent of his fields present some. While the baker was getting it ready, [the marquis] called the witch of [Sangtian], showed her the wheat and put her to death. As the marquis was about to taste the wheat, he felt it necessary to go to the privy, into which he fell, and so died. One of the servants that waited on him had dreamt in the morning that he carried the marquis on his back up to heaven. The same at mid-day carried him on his back out from the privy, and was afterwards buried alive with him. (tr. Legge 1872:374, note "witch" translates ''wu'') &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Commentators have attempted to explain why the ''wu'' merely interpreted the duke's dream but did not perform a healing ritual or exorcism, and why the duke waited until the prediction had failed before ordering the execution. Boileau (2002:368) suggests the ''wu'' was executed in presumed responsibility for the Zhao ancestral spirit's attack.

Second, in 552 BCE a ''wu'' named Gao 皋 both appears in and divines about a dream of Zhongxing Xianzi. After conspiring in the murder of Duke Li of Jin, Zhongxing dreams that the duke's spirit gets revenge.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In autumn, the marquis of [Jin] invaded our northern border. [Zhongxing Xianzi] prepared to invade [Qi]. (Just then), he dreamt that he was maintaining a suit with duke [Li], in which the case was going against him, when the duke struck him with a [''[[Dagger-axe|ge]]''] on his head, which fell down before him. He took his head up, put it on his shoulders, and ran off, when he saw the wizard [Gao] of [Gengyang]. A day or two after, it happened that he did see this [Gao] on the road, and told him his dream, and the wizard, who had had the same dream, said to him: "Your death is to happen about this time; but if you have business in the east, you will there be successful [first]". Xianzi accepted this interpretation. (tr. Legge 1872:478, note "wizard" translates ''wu'') &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Boileau questions:
&lt;blockquote&gt;why wasn't the ''wu'' asked by Zhongxin to expel the spirit of the duke? Perhaps because the spirit went through him to curse the officer. Could it be that the ''wu'' was involved (his involvement is extremely strong in this affair) in a kind of deal, or is it simply that the ''wu'' was aware of two different matters concerning the officer, only one connected to the dream? (2002:369) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to these two stories, ''wu'' were feared and considered dangerous. This attitude is also evident in a ''Zhuangzi'' story about the ''shenwu'' 神巫 "[[Shen (Chinese religion)|spirit/god]] shaman" Jixian 季咸 from [[Zheng (state)|Zheng]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;In [Zheng], there was a shaman of the gods named [Jixian]. He could tell whether men would live or die, survive or perish, be fortunate or unfortunate, live a long time or die young, and he would predict the year, month, week, and day as though he were a god himself. When the people of [Zheng] saw him, they all ran out of his way. (tr. Watson 1968:95) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
"As soothsayers." writes de Groot (1910 6:1195), "the ''wu'' in ancient China no doubt held a place of great importance."

====Wu-shamans as officials====
Sinological controversies have arisen over the political importance of ''wu'' 巫 in ancient China. Some scholars (e.g., Eliade 1964 and Chang 1983) believe Chinese ''wu'' used "techniques of ecstasy" like shamans elsewhere; others (e.g., Keightley 1983) believe ''wu'' were "ritual bureaucrats" or "moral metaphysicians" who did not engage in shamanistic practices.

[[Chen Mengjia]] wrote a seminal article (1936) that proposed Shang kings were ''wu''-shamans.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the oracle bone inscriptions are often encountered inscriptions stating that the king divined or that the king inquired in connections with wind- or rain-storms, rituals, conquests, or hunts. There are also statements that "the king made the prognostication that …," pertaining to weather, the border regions, or misfortunes and diseases; the only prognosticator ever recorded in the oracle bone inscriptions was the king ... There are, in addition, inscriptions describing the king dancing to pray for rain and the king prognosticating about a dream. All of these were activities of both king and shaman, which means in effect that the king was a shaman. (1936:535, tr. Chang 1983:46-47) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Chen's shaman-king hypothesis was supported by [[Kwang-chih Chang]] who cited the ''Guoyu'' story about Shao Hao severing heaven-earth communication (above).
&lt;blockquote&gt;This myth is the most important textual reference to shamanism in ancient China, and it provides the crucial clue to understanding the central role of shamanism in ancient Chinese politics. Heaven is where all the wisdom of human affairs lies. … Access to that wisdom was, of course, requisite for political authority. In the past, ''everybody'' had had that access through the shamans. Since heaven had been severed from earth, only those who controlled that access had the wisdom – hence the authority – to rule. Shamans, therefore, were a crucial part of every state court; in fact, scholars of ancient China agree that the king himself was actually head shaman. (1983:45) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Some modern scholars disagree. For instance, Boileau (2002:350) calls Chen's hypothesis "somewhat antiquated being based more on an a priori approach than on history" and says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the case of the relationship between ''wu'' and ''wang'' [king], Chen Mengjia did not pay sufficient attention to what the king was able to do as a king, that is to say, to the parts of the king's activities in which the ''wu'' was not involved, for example, political leadership as such, or warfare. The process of recognition must also be taken into account: it is probable that the ''wu'' was chosen or acknowledged as such according to different criteria to those adopted for the king. Chen's concept of the king as the head ''wu'' was influenced by [[James George Frazer|Frazer]]'s theories about the origin of political power: for Frazer the king was originally a powerful sorcerer. (2002:351) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Shujing'' "Classic of History" lists [[Wu Xian (astronomer)|Wu Xian]] 巫咸 and Wu Xian 巫賢 as capable administrators of the Shang royal household. The [[Duke of Zhou]] tells Prince [[Shao]] 召 that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I have heard that of ancient time, when [[Tang of Shang|King Tang]] had received the favoring decree, he had with him [[Yi Yin]], making his virtue like that of great Heaven. [[Tai Jia]], again, had Bao Heng. [[Tai Wu]] had Yi Zhi and Chen Hu, through whom his virtue was made to affect God; he had also [巫咸] Wu Xian, who regulated the royal house; [[Zu Yi]] had [巫賢] Wu Xian. [[Wu Ding]] had Gan Pan. These ministers carried out their principles and effected their arrangements, preserving and regulating the empire of [Shang], so that, while its ceremonies lasted, those sovereigns, though deceased, were assessors to Heaven, while it extended over many years. (tr. Legge 1865:206, n.b., names standardized to pinyin) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to Boileau,
&lt;blockquote&gt;In some texts, Wu Xian senior is described as being in charge of the divination using  [''shi'' 筮] achilea. He was apparently made a high god in the kingdom of [[Qin (state)|Qin]] 秦 during the Warring States period. The Tang subcommentary interprets the character ''wu'' of Wu Xian father and son as being a [[cognomen]], the name of the clan from which the two Xian came. It is possible that in fact the text referred to two Shang ministers, father and son, coming from the same eponymous territory ''wu''. Perhaps, later, the name (''wu'' 巫) of these two ministers has been confused with the character ''wu'' (巫) as employed in other received texts. (2002:358) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Wu''-shamans participated in court scandals and dynastic rivalries under [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (r. 141-87 BCE), particularly regarding the crime of ''wugu'' 巫蠱 (with [[Gu (poison)|''gu'']] "venom-based poison") "sorcery; casting harmful spells". In 130 BCE, [[Empress Chen Jiao]] was convicted of using shamans from [[State of Yue|Yue]] to conduct ''wugu'' magic. She "was dismissed from her position and a total of 300 persons who were involved in the case were executed" (tr. Loewe 1970:169), their heads were cut off and exposed on stakes. In 91 BCE, an attempted coup against crown prince [[Liu Ju]] involved accusations of practicing ''wugu'', and subsequently "no less than nine long months of bloody terrorism, ending in a tremendous slaughter, cost some tens of thousands their lives!" (tr. Groot 1910 5:836).

Ever since Emperor Wu of Han established Confucianism as the state religion, the ruling classes have shown increasing prejudice against shamanism (de Groot 1910:1233-42, Waley 1955:11-12). Some modern writers view the traditional Confucianist disdain for female shamans as [[sexism]]. Schafer wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the opinion of the writer, the Chou ruling class was particularly hostile to [[Women in ancient and imperial China#Han dynasty|women in government]], and regarded the ancient fertility rites as impure. This anti-female tendency was even more marked in the state of Lu, where Confucius approved of the official rain-ceremony in which men alone participated. There was, within ancient China, a heterogeneity of culture areas, with female shamans favored in some, males in others. The "licentiousness" of the ceremonies of such a state as Cheng (doubtless preserving the ancient Shang traditions and customs) was a byword among Confucian moralists. Confucius' state seems on the other hand to have taken the "respectable" attitude that the sexes should not mingle in the dance, and that men were the legitimate performers of the fertility rites. The general practice of the later Chou period, or at least the semi-idealized picture given of the rites of that time in such books as the ''Chou li'', apparently prescribed a division of magical functions between men and women. The former generally play the role of exorcists, the latter of petitioners. This is probably related to the metaphysical belief that women, embodying the principle ''yin'', were akin to the spirits, whereas men, exemplifying the element ''yang'', were naturally hostile to them. (1951:158) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Accepting the tradition that Chinese shamans were women (i.e., ''wu'' 巫 "shamaness" as opposed to ''xi'' 覡 "shaman"), Kagan believes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the main themes in Chinese history is the unsuccessful attempt by the male Confucian orthodoxy to [[Women in ancient and imperial China|strip women of their public and sacred powers]] and to limit them to a role of service ... Confucianists reasserted daily their claim to power and authority through the promotion of the phallic ancestor cult which denied women religious representation and excluded them from the governmental examination system which was the path to office, prestige, and status. (1980:3-4) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
In addition, Unschuld (1980:125-128) refers to a "Confucian medicine" based upon systematic correspondences and the idea that illnesses are caused by excesses (rather than demons).

The ''Zhouli'' provides detailed information about the roles of ''wu''-shamans. It lists (Falkenhausen 1995:282), "Spirit Mediums as officials on the payroll of the Zhou Ministry of Rites (''Liguan'' 禮官, or Ministry of Spring, ''Chun guan'' 春官)." This text differentiates three offices: the Siwu 司巫 "Manager/Director of Shamans", Nanwu 男巫 "Male Shamans", and ''Nüwu'' 女巫 "Female Shamans".

The managerial Siwu, who was of [[Chinese nobility#Fengjian and Zongfa of the Zhou Dynasty|''Shi'']] 士 "Gentleman; Yeoman" feudal rank, yet was not a ''wu'', supervised "the many ''wu''".
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Managers of the Spirit Mediums are in charge of the policies and orders issued to the many Spirit Mediums. When the country suffers a great drought, they lead the Spirit Mediums in dancing the rain-making ritual (''yu'' 雩). When the country suffers a great calamity, they lead the Spirit Mediums in enacting the long-standing practices of Spirit Mediums (''wuheng'' 巫恆). At official sacrifices, they [handle] the ancestral tablets in their receptacles, the cloth on which the spirits walk, and the box containing the reeds [for presenting the sacrificial foodstuffs]. In all official sacrificial services, they guard the place where the offerings are buried. In all funerary services, they are in charge of the rituals by which the Spirit Mediums make [the spirits] descend (''jiang'' 降). (tr. von Falkenhausen 1995:285, cf. de Groot 1910 6:1189-1190) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Nanwu and Nüwu have different shamanic specializations, especially regarding inauspicious events like sickness, death, and natural disaster.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Male Spirit Mediums are in charge of the ''si'' 祀 and ''yan'' 衍 Sacrifices to the Deities of the Mountains and Rivers. They receive the honorific titles [of the deities], which they proclaim into the [four] directions, holding reeds. In the winter, in the great temple hall, they offer [or: shoot arrows] without a fixed direction and without counting the number. In the spring, they make proclamations and issue bans so as to remove sickness and disease. When the king offers condolence, they together with the invocators precede him. &lt;br&gt;
The Female Mediums are in charge of anointing and ablutions at the exorcisms that are held at regular times throughout the year. When there is a drought or scorching heat, they dance in the rain-making ritual (''yu''). When the queen offers condolence, they together with the invocators precede her. In all great calamities of the state, they pray, singing and wailing. (26, tr. von Falkenhausen 1995:290, cf. de Groot 1910 6:1189) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Von Falkenhausen concludes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If we are to generalize from the above enumeration, we find that the Spirit Mediums' principal functions are tied up with averting evil and pollution. They are especially active under circumstances of inauspiciousness and distress. In case of droughts and calamities, they directly address the supernatural powers of Heaven and Earth. Moreover, they are experts in dealing with frightful, dangerous ghosts (the ghosts of the defunct at the time of the funeral, the evil spirits at the exorcism, and the spirits of disease) and harmful substances (unburied dead bodies during visits of condolence and all manner of impure things at the lustration festival). (1995:293)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Chu Ci''===
{{Main|Chu Ci}}
The poetry anthology ''Chu Ci'', especially its older pieces, is largely characterized by its shamanic content and style, as explicated to some extent by sinologist [[David Hawkes (Sinologist)|David Hawkes]].(1985[2011]:''passim'') Among other points of interest are the intersection of Shamanic traditions and mythology/folk religion in the earlier textual material, such as ''[[Heavenly Questions|Tianwen]]'' (possibly based on even more ancient shamanic temple murals), the whole question of the interpretation of the 11 verses of the ''[[Jiu Ge]]'' (''Nine Songs'') as the libretto of a shamanic dramatic performance, the motif of shamanic spirit flight from ''[[Li Sao]]'' through subsequent pieces, the evidence of possible regional variations in wu shamanism between [[Chu (state)|Chu]], [[Wei (state)|Wei]], [[Qi (state)|Qi]], and other states (or shamanic colleges associated with those regions), and the suggestion that some of the newer textual material was modified to please Han Wudi, by [[Liu An]], the Prince of Huainan, or his circle. The [[List of Chu Ci contents|''Chu Ci'' contents]] have traditionally been chronologically divided into an older, pre-[[Han dynasty]] group, and those written during the Han Dynasty. Of the traditionally-considered to be the older works (omitting the mostly prose narratives, "[[Bu Ju]]" and "[[Yu Fu]]") David Hawkes considers the following sections to be "functional, explicitly shamanistic": ''[[Jiu Ge]]'', ''Tian Wen'', and the two shamanic summons for the soul, "[[The Great Summons]]" and "[[Summons of the Soul]]".(1985[2011]:38) Regarding the other, older pieces he considers that "shamanism, if there is any" to be an incidental poetic device, particularly in the form of descriptions of the shamanic spirit journey.

====Background====
The mainstream of Chinese literacy and literature is associated with the [[oracle bone|shell and bone]] oracular inscriptions from recovered archeological artifacts from the [[Shang dynasty]] and with the literary works of the Western [[Zhou dynasty]], which include the classic Confucian works. Both are associated with the northern Chinese areas. South of the traditional Shang and Zhou areas was the land (and water) of [[Chu (state)|Chu]]. Politically and to some extent culturally distinct from the Zhou dynasty and its later 6 devolved hegemonic states, Chu was the original source and inspiration for the poems anthologized during the [[Han dynasty]] under the title ''[[Chu Ci]]'', literally meaning something like "the literary material of Chu".(Hawkes:16-17 and 28-29) Despite the tendency of Confucian-oriented  government officials to suppress wu shamanic beliefs and practice, in the general area of Chinese culture, the force of colonial conservatism and the poetic voice of [[Qu Yuan]] and other poets combined to contribute an established literary tradition heavily influenced by wu shamanism to posterity.(Hawkes:19-20) Shamanic practices as described anthropologically are generally paralleled by descriptions of wu practices as found in the ''Chu Ci'', and in Chinese mythology more generally.(Hawkes:42-47)

====''Li Sao'', ''Yuan You'', and ''Jiu Bian''====
{{Main|Li Sao|Yuan You|Jiu Bian}}
The signature poem of the ''Chu Ci'' is the poem ''[[Li Sao]]''. By China's "first poet", [[Qu Yuan]], a major literary device of the poem is the shamanic spirit journey. "[[Yuan You]]", literally "The Far-off Journey" features shamanic spirit flight as a literary device, as does ''[[Jiu Bian]]'', as part of its climactic ending. In the ''Li Sao'', two individual shaman are specified, Ling Fen (靈氛) and Wu Xian (巫咸).(Hawkes:45, note 9) This Wu Xian may or may not be the same as the (one or more) historical person(s) named [[Wu Xian (astronomer)|Wu Xian]]. Hawkes suggests an equation of the word ''ling'' in the Chu dialect with the word ''wu''.(46 and 84)

====Questioning Heaven====
{{Main|Heavenly Questions}}
The ''[[Heavenly Questions]]'' (literally "Questioning Heaven") is one of the ancient repositories of Chinese myth and a major cultural legacy. Propounded as a series of questions, the poem provides incite and provokes questions about the role of wu shaman practitioners in society and history.

====''Jiu Ge''====
{{Main|Jiu Ge}}
The ''Jiu Ge'' may be read as the lyrical preservation of a shamanic dramatic performance. Apparently typical of at least one variety of shamanism of the Chu area of the [[Yangzi River]] basin, the text exhibits a marked degree of eroticism in connection with shamanic invocations.

====Summoning the soul====
{{Further|Hun and po}}
Summoning the soul (''hun'') of the possibly dead was a feature of ancient culture. The 2 ''Chu Ci'' pieces of this type may be authentic transcriptions of such a process.

====Individual wu shaman====
{{Main|List of wu shaman}} 
Various individual wu shaman are alluded to in the ''Chu Ci''. In some cases the binomial nomenclature is unclear, referring perhaps to one or two persons; for example, in the case of Peng Xian, who appears likely to represent Wu Peng and Wu Xian,(Hawkes:70 and 84-86) which is a common type of morphological construction in Classical Chinese poetry. David Hawkes refers to some wu shaman as "Shaman Ancestors". Additionally, the distinction between humans and transcendent divinities tends not to be explicit in the received ''Chu Ci'' text. In some cases, the individual wu shaman are known from other sources, such as the ''[[Shanhaijing]]'' (''Classic of Mountains and Seas''). The name of some individual shaman includes "Wu" (巫) in the normal position of the family surname, for example, in the case of Wu Yang (巫陽, "Shaman Bright"). Wu Yang is the major speaker in ''Zhao Hun''/''Summons for the Soul''. He also appears in ''[[Shanhaijing]]'' together with Wu Peng (巫彭): 6 wu shaman are depicted together reviving a corpse, with Wu Peng holding the Herb of Immortality.(Hawkes:45 and 230-231)

==Modern wu==
[[File:Chuonnasuan, the last shaman of the Oroqen, in July 1994 (Photo by Richard Noll).jpg|thumb|The [[Oroqen people|Oroqen]] shaman Chuonnasuan in July 1994.]]
The ancient Chinese traditions of ''wu''-shamans continue in the contemporary cultures of China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. Popular practices include clairvoyance, fortune telling, exorcism, invocation, and prayer.

Scholars have studied many aspects of modern ''wu''. De Groot (1910 6:1243-1268) provided descriptions and pictures of hereditary shamans in [[Fujian]], called ''saigong'' (pinyin ''shigong'') 師公. Paper (1999) analyzed ''tongji'' mediumistic activities in the Taiwanese village of Bao'an 保安. Noll (2004) documented Chuonnasuan (1927–2000), the last shaman of the [[Oroqen people|Oroqen]] in northeast China.

Jordan Paper summarizes the present-day shaman's religious significance.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Mediums, frequently associated with local temples … are ubiquitous aspects of popular Chinese religion. They are (or at least were into the mid-twentieth century) common from far north in Manchuria to the extreme south of Hainan and Guangtung, and from the eastern island of Taiwan to Tibet in China's far west. (1995:117-8) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
