'''Actor–network theory''' ('''ANT''') is a theoretical and methodological approach to [[social theory]] where everything in the social and natural worlds exists in constantly shifting networks of relationship.&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;Simandan, D., 2017. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, pp.1-12. https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307&lt;/ref&gt; It posits that nothing exists outside those relationships. All the factors involved in a social situation are on the same level, and thus there are no external social forces beyond what and how the network participants interact at present. Thus, objects, ideas, processes, and any other relevant factors are seen as just as important in creating social situations as humans. ANT holds that social forces do not exist in themselves, and therefore cannot be used to explain social phenomena.  Instead, strictly empirical analysis should be undertaken to "describe" rather than "explain" social activity.  Only after this can one introduce the concept of social forces, and only as an abstract theoretical concept, not something which genuinely exists in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Latour, Bruno. Reassembling the social: An introduction to actor-network-theory. Oxford university press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental aim of ANT is to explore how networks are built or assembled and maintained to achieve a specific objective.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ulir.ul.ie/handle/10344/2579 Carroll, N., Richardson, I., and Whelan, E. (2012). Service science: an actor-network theory approach. International Journal of Actor-Network Theory and Technological Innovation (IJANTTI);4(3), pp. 51-69]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rpx_BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=carroll+A+Bureaucratic+View+of+Public+Service+Innovation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OrMOvhK-8k&amp;sig=YljSfKMKSn1HchgCBBiJYmRnMMc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwit-ITauIrQAhXDA8AKHbdPBS0Q6AEIKjAD#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Carroll, N.

Actor-Network Theory: A Bureaucratic View of Public Service Innovation, Chapter 7, Technological Advancements and the Impact of Actor-Network Theory, pp. 115-144, Publisher IGI Global, Hershey, PA]&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is best known for its controversial insistence on the capacity of [[non human|nonhumans]] to act or participate in systems or [[Social network|networks]] or both, ANT is also associated with forceful critiques of conventional and critical sociology. Developed by [[science and technology studies]] (STS) scholars [[Michel Callon]] and [[Bruno Latour]], the sociologist [[John Law (sociologist)|John Law]], and others, it can more technically be described as a "material-semiotic" method. This means that it maps relations that are simultaneously material (between things) and [[semiotic]] (between concepts). It assumes that many relations are both material and semiotic.

Broadly speaking, ANT is a [[social constructivism|constructivist]] approach in that it avoids [[essentialist]] explanations of events or innovations (i.e. ANT explains a successful theory by understanding the combinations and interactions of elements that make it successful, rather than saying it is true and the others are false). Likewise, it is not a cohesive theory in itself.&lt;ref name="doi.org"/&gt; Rather, ANT functions as a strategy that assists people in being sensitive to terms and the often unexplored assumptions underlying them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mol|first=A.|date=2010|title=Actor-Network Theory: sensitive terms and enduring tensions|url=http://dare.uva.nl/search?identifier=75bbc661-0a89-475a-9eef-8c8c5a2e9904|journal=Kölner Zeitschrift für Soziologie und Sozialpsychologie. Sonderheft|volume=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinguished from many other [[science and technology studies|STS]] and sociological [[Social network|network theories]] for its distinct material-semiotic approach.

==Background and context==
ANT was first developed at the [[Centre de Sociologie de l'Innovation]] (CSI) of the [[École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris]] in the early 1980s by staff ([[Michel Callon]] and [[Bruno Latour]]) and visitors (including [[John Law (sociologist)|John Law]]). The 1984 book co-authored by John Law and fellow-sociologist Peter Lodge (''Science for Social Scientists''; London: Macmillan Press Ltd.) is a good example of early explorations of how the growth and structure of knowledge could be analyzed and interpreted through the interactions of actors and networks.  Initially created in an attempt to understand processes of innovation and knowledge-creation in science and technology, the approach drew on existing work in [[Science and technology studies|STS]], on studies of [[large technical system|large technological systems]], and on a range of French intellectual resources including the semiotics of [[Algirdas Julien Greimas]], the writing of philosopher [[Michel Serres]], and the [[Annales School]] of history.

ANT appears to reflect many of the preoccupations of French [[post-structuralism]], and in particular a concern with non-foundational and multiple material-semiotic relations. At the same time, it was much more firmly embedded in English-language academic traditions than most post-structuralist-influenced approaches. Its grounding in (predominantly English) [[science and technology studies]] was reflected in an intense commitment to the development of theory through qualitative empirical case-studies. Its links with largely US-originated work on large technical systems were reflected in its willingness to analyse large scale technological developments in an even-handed manner to include political, organizational, legal, technical and scientific factors.

Many of the characteristic ANT tools (including the notions of translation, generalized symmetry and the “heterogeneous network”), together with a [[scientometric]] tool for mapping innovations in science and technology (“co-word analysis”) were initially developed during the 1980s, predominantly in and around the CSI. The “state of the art” of ANT in the late 1980s is well-described in Latour’s 1987 text, ''Science in Action''.&lt;ref name=science&gt;Latour, B. (1987). ''[[Science in Action: How to Follow Scientists and Engineers Through Society]].'' Milton Keynes: Open University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

From about 1990 onwards, ANT started to become popular as a tool for analysis in a range of fields beyond STS. It was picked up and developed by authors in parts of organizational analysis, informatics, health studies, geography, sociology, anthropology, feminist studies, technical communication&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Network: Theorizing Knowledge Work in Telecommunications|last=Spinuzzi|first=Clay|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780521895040|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Read|first=Sarah|last2=Swarts|first2=Jason|date=2015|title=Visualizing and Tracing: Research Methodologies for the Study of Networked, Sociotechnical Activity, Otherwise Known as Knowledge Work|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/10572252.2015.975961|journal=Technical Communication Quarterly|volume=24|issue=1|pages=14-44|doi=10.1080/10572252.2015.975961|via=Taylor &amp; Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; and economics.&lt;ref name="Müller, M 2016. pp.217-229"&gt;Müller, M. and Schurr, C., 2016. Assemblage thinking and actor‐network theory: conjunctions, disjunctions, cross‐fertilisations. Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers, 41(3), pp.217-229.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2008}}, ANT is a widespread, if controversial, range of material-semiotic approaches for the analysis of heterogeneous relations. In part because of its popularity, it is interpreted and used in a wide range of alternative and sometimes incompatible ways. There is no orthodoxy in current ANT, and different authors use the approach in substantially different ways. Some authors talk of “after-ANT” to refer to “successor projects” blending together different problem-focuses with those of ANT.&lt;ref&gt;John Law and John Hassard (eds) (1999). ''Actor Network Theory and After'' (Oxford and Keele: Blackwell and the Sociological Review).&lt;/ref&gt;

==A material-semiotic method==
Although it is called a “[[Philosophical theory|theory]]”, ANT does not usually explain “why” or "how" a network takes the form that it does.&lt;ref name=RtS /&gt; Rather, ANT is a way of thoroughly exploring the relational ties within a network (which can be a multitude of different things). As Latour notes,&lt;ref name=technology&gt;Latour, B. (1999). [http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/46-TECHNOLOGY-DURABLE-GBpdf.pdf "Technology Is Society Made Durable"]. In Law, J., ed., ''Sociology of Monsters''.&lt;/ref&gt; "explanation does not follow from description; it is description taken that much further." It is not, in other words, a theory "of" anything, but rather a method, or a "how-to book" as Latour &lt;ref name=RtS /&gt; puts it.

The approach is related to other versions of material-semiotics (notably the work of philosophers [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Michel Foucault]], and feminist scholar [[Donna Haraway]]). It can also be seen as a way of being faithful to the insights of [[ethnomethodology]] and its detailed descriptions of how common activities, habits and procedures sustain themselves.  Similarities between ANT and [[symbolic interactionist]] approaches such as the newer forms of [[grounded theory]] like [[situational analysis]], exist,&lt;ref&gt;Fernback, J., 2007. “Beyond the Diluted Community Concept: A Symbolic Interactionist Perspective on Online Social Relations.” ''New Media &amp; Society'', 9(1), pp.49-69. [[doi:10.1177/1461444807072417]]&lt;/ref&gt; although Latour&lt;ref&gt;Blok, A, &amp; Elgaard Jensen, T. (2011). ''[http://www.excursions-journal.org.uk/index.php/excursions/article/download/100/134 Bruno Latour: Hybrid thoughts in a hybrid world] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524023006/http://www.excursions-journal.org.uk/index.php/excursions/article/download/100/134 |date=May 24, 2015 }}''. Suffolk: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; objects to such a comparison.

Although ANT is mostly associated with studies of science and technology and with the sociology of science, it has been making steady progress in other fields of sociology as well.  ANT is adamantly empirical, and as such yields useful insights and tools for sociological inquiry in general. ANT has been deployed in studies of identity and subjectivity, urban transportation systems, and passion and addiction.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Gomart, Emilie, and Hennion, Antoin (1999) “[https://www.academia.edu/866668/A_Sociology_of_Attachment_Music_Amateurs_Drug_Addicts A Sociology of Attachment: Music Amateurs, Drug Users]”.

==The actor-network==
As the term implies, the actor-network is the central concept in ANT. The term "network" is somewhat problematic in that as Latour &lt;ref name=RtS /&gt;&lt;ref name=technology /&gt;&lt;ref name=on&gt;Latour, B. "[http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/P-67%20ACTOR-NETWORK.pdf On Actor Network Theory: A Few Clarifications]"&lt;/ref&gt; notes, it has a number of unwanted connotations. Firstly, it implies that what is described takes the shape of a network, which is not necessarily the case. Secondly, it implies "transportation without deformation," which, in ANT, is not possible since any actor-network involves a vast number of [[#Translation|translations]]. Latour,&lt;ref name=on /&gt; however, still contends that network is a fitting term to use, because "it has no a priori order relation; it is not tied to the axiological myth of a top and of a bottom of society; it makes absolutely no assumption whether a specific locus is macro- or micro- and does not modify the tools to study the element 'a' or the element 'b'." This use of the term "network" is very similar to Deleuze and Guattari's [[Rhizome (philosophy)|rhizomes]]; Latour &lt;ref name=technology /&gt; even remarks tongue in cheek that he would have no objection to renaming ANT "actant-rhizome ontology" if it only had sounded better, which hints at Latour's uneasiness with the word "theory".

Actor–network theory tries to explain how material–semiotic networks come together to act as a whole; the clusters of actors involved in creating meaning are both material and semiotic. As a part of this it may look at explicit strategies for relating different elements together into a network so that they form an apparently coherent whole. These networks are potentially transient, existing in a constant making and re-making.&lt;ref name=RtS&gt;Latour, B., 2005. ''[[Bruno Latour#Reassembling the Social|Reassembling the Social: An Introduction to Actor-Network-Theory]]''. Oxford: Oxford UP.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that relations need to be repeatedly “performed” or the network will dissolve. They also assume that networks of relations are not intrinsically coherent, and may indeed contain conflicts. Social relations, in other words, are only ever in process, and must be [[Performativity|performed]] continuously.

Actants denote human and non-human actors, and in a network take the shape that they do by virtue of their relations with one another. It assumes that nothing lies outside the network of relations, and as noted above, suggests that there is no difference in the ability of technology, humans, animals, or other non-humans to act (and that there are only enacted alliances). As soon as an actor engages with an actor-network it too is caught up in the web of relations, and becomes part of the [[entelechy]].

If taken to its logical conclusion, then, nearly any actor can be considered merely a sum of other, smaller actors. A car is an example of a complex system. It contains many electronic and [[machine|mechanical]] components, all of which are essentially hidden from view to the driver, who simply deals with the car as a single object. This effect is known as ''punctualisation'', and is similar to the idea of [[Encapsulation (object-oriented programming)|encapsulation]] in [[object-oriented programming]].

When an actor network breaks down, the punctualisation effect tends to cease as well. In the automobile example above, a non-working engine would cause the driver to become aware of the car as a collection of parts rather than just a vehicle capable of transporting them from place to place. This can also occur when elements of a network act contrarily to the network as a whole. In his book ''Pandora’s Hope'', Latour likens depunctualization to the opening of a black box. When closed, the box is perceived simply as a box, although when it is opened all elements inside it becomes visible.

==Human and non-human actors==
ANT is often associated with the equal treatment of human and non-human actors. ANT assumes that all entities in a network can and should be described in the same terms. This is called the principle of ''[[generalized symmetry]]''. The rationale for this is that differences between them are generated in the network of relations, and should not be presupposed.&lt;ref name="Müller, M 2016. pp.217-229"/&gt;

===Intermediaries and mediators===
The distinction between intermediaries and mediators is key to ANT sociology. Intermediaries are entities which make no difference (to some interesting state of affairs which we are studying) and so can be ignored. They transport the force of some other entity more or less without transformation and so are fairly uninteresting. Mediators, on the other hand, are entities which multiply difference and so should be the object of study. Their outputs cannot be predicted by their inputs. From an ANT point of view, sociology has tended to treat too much of the world as intermediaries.

For instance, a sociologist might take silk and nylon as intermediaries, holding that the former “means”, “reflects”, or “symbolises” the upper classes and the latter the lower classes. In such a view, the real-world silk–nylon difference is irrelevant — presumably, many other material differences could also, and do also, transport this class distinction. But taken as mediators, these fabrics would have to be engaged with by the analyst in their specificity: the internal real-world complexities of silk and nylon suddenly appear relevant, and are seen as actively constructing the ideological class distinction which they once merely reflected.

For the committed ANT analyst, social things like class distinctions in taste, as in the silk and nylon example, are examples of social construction, but also groups and power must constantly be constructed or performed anew through complex engagements with complex mediators. There is no stand-alone social repertoire lying in the background to be reflected off, expressed through, or substantiated in, interactions (as in an intermediary conception). That being said, it doesn't make sense to say there are social aspects of things. Things themselves are a constitutive part of the social reality they are able to enact.&lt;ref name=RtS /&gt;

==Other central concepts==

===Translation===
{{main|Translation (sociology)}}
Central to ANT is the concept of translation which is sometimes referred to as '''sociology of translation''', in which innovators attempt to create a ''forum,'' a central network in which all the actors agree that the network is worth building and defending. In his widely debated 1986 study of how marine biologists try to restock the St Brieuc Bay in order to produce more scallops,&lt;ref&gt;Michel Callon (1986). “[http://www.vub.ac.be/SOCO/tesa/RENCOM/Callon%20%281986%29%20Some%20elements%20of%20a%20sociology%20of%20translation.pdf Some Elements of a Sociology of Translation: Domestication of the Scallops and the Fishermen of St Brieuc Bay]”. In John Law (ed.), ''Power, Action and Belief: A New Sociology of Knowledge'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Callon]] has defined 4 moments of translation: [[problematization]], [[interessement]], enrollment and mobilisation of allies.  Also important to the notion is the role of network objects in helping to smooth out the translation process by creating equivalencies between what would otherwise be very challenging people, organizations or conditions to mesh together.  Bruno Latour spoke about this particular task of objects in his work ''Reassembling the Social'' (2005).

=== Tokens, or quasi-objects ===
In the above examples, “social order” and “functioning car” come into being through the successful interactions of their respective actor-networks, and actor-network theory refers to these creations as ''tokens'' or ''quasi-objects'' which are passed between actors within the network.

As the token is increasingly transmitted or passed through the network, it becomes increasingly punctualized and also increasingly [[Reification (Marxism)|reified]]. When the token is decreasingly transmitted, or when an actor fails to transmit the token (e.g., the oil pump breaks), punctualization and reification are decreased as well.

== Actor network theory and specific disciplines ==
Recently, there has been a movement to introduce Actor Network Theory as an analytical tool to a range of applied disciplines outside of sociology, including nursing, public health, business (Klein and Czarniawska, 2005), library and information science (Beagle, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite journal|url = |title = The Sociotechnical Networks of Scholarly Communication.|last = Beagle|first = Donald|date = 2001|journal = Portal: Libraries and the Academy |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=421–443|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;); urban studies (Farias and Bender, 2010), and community, urban, and regional planning (Beauregard, 2012;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Planning with Things|last = Beauregard|first = Robert|date = 2012|journal = Journal of Planning Education and Research |volume=32 |pages=182–190|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beauregard and Lieto, 2015; Rydin, 2012;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Using Actor-Network Theory to understand planning practice: Exploring relationships between actants in regulating low-carbon commercial development|last = Rydin|first = Yvonne|date = 2012|journal = Planning Theory |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=23–45|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rydin and Tate, 2016, Tate, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Growth management implementation in Metro Vancouver: Lessons  from actor network theory.|last = Tate|first = Laura|date = 2013|journal = Environment and Planning B |volume=40 |issue= |pages=783–800|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== ANT and international relations ===
Actor-Network Theory has become increasingly prominent within the discipline of [[International Relations]] and [[Political Science]].

Theoretically, scholars within IR have employed ANT in order to disrupt traditional world political binaries (civilised/barbarian, democratic/autocratic, etc.),&lt;ref name="ejt.sagepub.com"&gt;Austin, Jonathan Luke., 2015. [http://ejt.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/11/26/1354066115616466.abstract "We have never been civilized: Torture and the Materiality of World Political Binaries."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151204051611/http://ejt.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/11/26/1354066115616466.abstract |date=2015-12-04 }} ''European Journal of International Relations'', [[doi:10.1177/1354066115616466]]&lt;/ref&gt; consider the implications of a posthuman understanding of IR,&lt;ref&gt;Cudworth, E. and Hobden, S, 2013. “Of parts and wholes: International Relations beyond the human.” ''Millennium: Journal of International Studies', 41(3), pp.430-450.&lt;/ref&gt; explore the infrastructures of world politics,&lt;ref&gt;Barry, A., 2013. “Material Politics.”&lt;/ref&gt; and consider the effects of technological agency.&lt;ref&gt;Leander, A., 2013. “Technological agency in the co-constitution of legal expertise and the US drone program.” ''Leiden Journal of International Law', 26(4), pp.811-831.&lt;/ref&gt;

Empirically, IR scholars have drawn on insights from ANT in order to study phenomena including political violences like the use of torture and drones,&lt;ref name="ejt.sagepub.com"/&gt; piracy and maritime governance,&lt;ref&gt;Bueger C., 2013. “Practice, pirates, and coast guards.” ''Third World Quarterly', 34(10), pp.1811-1827.&lt;/ref&gt; and garbage.&lt;ref&gt;Acuto, M., 2014. “Everyday International Relations.” ''International Political Sociology', 8(4).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ANT and design ===
The Actor-Network Theory can also be applied to design, using a perspective that is not simply limited to an analysis of an object's structure. From the ANT viewpoint, design is seen as a series of features that account for a social, psychological, and economical world. ANT argues that objects are designed to shape human action and mold or influence decisions. In this way, the objects' design serves to mediate human relationships and can even impact our morality, ethics, and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yaneva|first=Albena|title=Making the Social Hold: Towards an Actor-Network Theory of Design|journal=Design and Culture|publication-date=2009|volume=1|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Actor–network theory insists on the capacity of [[non human|nonhumans]] to be actors or participants in networks and systems. Critics including figures such as [[Langdon Winner]] maintain that such properties as ''[[intentionality]]'' fundamentally distinguish humans from animals or from “things” (see [[Activity Theory]]).&lt;ref&gt;Winner, L. (1993). [http://www.nyu.edu/projects/nissenbaum/papers/openingblackbox.pdf "Upon Opening the Black Box and Finding It Empty : Social Constructivism and the Philosophy of Technology Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values"] (Vol. 18, pp. 362-378).&lt;/ref&gt; ANT scholars {{Who|date=December 2012}} respond with the following arguments:
* They do not attribute intentionality and similar properties to [[non human|nonhumans]].
* Their conception of [[human agency|agency]] does not presuppose intentionality.
* They locate agency neither in human “subjects” nor in non-human “objects”, but in heterogeneous associations of humans and nonhumans.

ANT has been criticized as amoral. [[Wiebe Bijker]] has responded to this criticism by stating that the amorality of ANT is not a necessity. Moral and political positions are possible, but one must first describe the network before taking up such positions. This position has been further explored by Stuart Shapiro who contrasts ANT with the history of ecology, and argues that research decisions are moral rather than methodological, but this moral dimension has been sidelined.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, S. (1997). Caught in a web: The implications of ecology for radical symmetry in STS. Social Epistemology, 11(1), 97-110. [[doi:10.1080/02691729708578832]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whittle and Spicer note that "ANT has also sought to move beyond deterministic models that trace organizational phenomena back to powerful individuals, social structures, hegemonic discourses or technological effects. Rather, ANT prefers to seek out complex patterns of causality rooted in connections between actors." They argue that ANT's ontological realism makes it "less well equipped for pursuing a critical account of organizations—that is, one which recognises the unfolding nature of reality, considers the limits of knowledge and seeks to challenge structures of domination." &lt;ref&gt;Andrea Whittle and [[André Spicer]], 2008. Is actor network theory critique? ''Organization Studies'' 2008 29: 611&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that ANT does not account for pre-existing structures, such as power, but rather sees these structures as emerging from the actions of actors within the network and their ability to align in pursuit of their interests. Accordingly, ANT can be seen as an attempt to re-introduce [[Whig history]] into [[science and technology studies]]; like the myth of the [[Heroic theory of invention and scientific development|heroic inventor]], ANT can be seen as an attempt to explain successful innovators by saying only that they were successful. Likewise, for organization studies, Whittle and Spicer assert that ANT is, "ill suited to the task of developing political alternatives to the imaginaries of market managerialism."

Key early criticism came from other members of the STS community, in particular the "Epistemological Chicken" debate between Collins and Yearley with responses from Latour and Callon as well as Woolgar.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} Collins and Yearley accused ANTs approach of collapsing into an endless relativist regress.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, H. M., &amp; Yearley, S. (1992). Epistemological Chicken. In A. Pickering (Ed.), Science as Practice and Culture (pp. 301-326). Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;   Some critics&lt;ref&gt;Amsterdamska, O. (1990). 'Surely You're Joking, Mr Latour!'. Science, Technology, Human Values. Vol.15(4) pp.495-504.&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that research based on ANT perspectives remains entirely descriptive and fails to provide explanations for social processes. ANT—like comparable social scientific methods—requires judgement calls from the researcher as to which actors are important within a network and which are not. Critics{{Who|date=July 2013}} argue that the importance of particular actors cannot be determined in the absence of “out-of-network” criteria. Similarly, others{{Who|date=October 2014}} argue that actor-networks risk degenerating into endless chains of association ([[six degrees of separation]]—we are all networked to one another). Other research perspectives such as [[social constructionism]], [[social shaping of technology]], [[social network theory]], [[normalization process theory]], [[Diffusion of Innovations]] theory are held to be important alternatives to ANT approaches.

In a workshop called “On Recalling ANT”, [[Bruno Latour]] stated that there are four things wrong with actor-network theory: “actor”, “network”, “theory” and the hyphen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/sociology/research/publications/papers/latour-recalling-ant.pdf Keynote Speech: On Recalling ANT] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714210351/http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/sociology/research/publications/papers/latour-recalling-ant.pdf |date=July 14, 2014 }}, Lancester University, Department of Sociology&lt;/ref&gt; In a later book however (''[[Bruno Latour#Reassembling the Social|Reassembling the Social: An Introduction to Actor–Network–Theory]]''), Latour reversed himself, accepting the wide use of the term, “''including'' the hyphen” (Latour 2005:9).{{Full citation needed|date=May 2014}} He also remarked how he had been helpfully reminded that the ANT acronym “was perfectly fit for a blind, myopic, workaholic, trail-sniffing, and collective traveler” (the ant, Latour 2005:9) — qualitative hallmarks of actor-network [[epistemology]].

'''Augustine's laws''' were a series of [[tongue in cheek]] [[aphorisms]] put forth by [[Norman Ralph Augustine]], an American [[aerospace]] businessman who served as [[Under Secretary of the Army]] from 1975 to 1977. In 1984 he published his laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Augustine Laws |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WgwhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XnIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1109,6555752&amp;dq=augustine's+laws&amp;hl=en |quote= |work=[[United Press International]] |date=May 24, 1986 |accessdate=2010-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book and several of the laws were the topic of an article in Sound and Vibration magazine in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news |author= David O. Smallwood |coauthors= |title=Augustine Laws Revisited |url=http://www.sandv.com/downloads/1203smal.pdf |quote= |work=[[Sound &amp; Vibration Magazine]] |date=March 2012 |accessdate=2012-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List==

Law Number I: The best way to make a silk purse from a sow's ear is to begin with a silk sow. The same is true of money.

Law Number II: If today were half as good as tomorrow is supposed to be, it would probably be twice as good as yesterday was.

Law Number III: There are no lazy veteran lion hunters.

Law Number IV: If you can afford to advertise, you don't need to.

Law Number V: One-tenth of the participants produce over one-third of the output. Increasing the number of participants merely reduces the average output.

Law Number VI: A hungry dog hunts best. A hungrier dog hunts even better.

Law Number VII: Decreased business base increases overhead. So does increased business base.

Law Number VIII: The most unsuccessful four years in the education of a cost-estimator is fifth grade arithmetic.

Law Number IX: Acronyms and abbreviations should be used to the maximum extent possible to make trivial ideas profound...Q.E.D.

Law Number X: Bulls do not win bullfights; people do. People do not win people fights; lawyers do.

Law Number XI: If the Earth could be made to rotate twice as fast, managers would get twice as much done. If the Earth could be made to rotate twenty times as fast, everyone else would get twice as much done since all the managers would fly off.

Law Number XII: It costs a lot to build bad products.

Law Number XIII: There are many highly successful businesses in the United States. There are also many highly paid executives. The policy is not to intermingle the two.

Law Number XIV: After the year 2015, there will be no airplane crashes. There will be no takeoffs either, because electronics will occupy 100 percent of every airplane's weight.

Law Number XV: The last 10 percent of performance generates one-third of the cost and two-thirds of the problems.

Law Number XVI: In the year 2054, the entire defense budget will purchase just one aircraft. This aircraft will have to be shared by the Air Force and Navy 3-1/2 days each per week except for leap year, when it will be made available to the Marines for the extra day.

Law Number XVII: Software is like entropy. It is difficult to grasp, weighs nothing, and obeys the Second Law of Thermodynamics; i.e., it always increases.

Law Number XVIII: It is very expensive to achieve high unreliability. It is not uncommon to increase the cost of an item by a factor of ten for each factor of ten degradation accomplished.

Law Number XIX: Although most products will soon be too costly to purchase, there will be a thriving market in the sale of books on how to fix them.

Law Number XX: In any given year, Congress will appropriate the amount of funding approved the prior year plus three-fourths of whatever change the administration requests, minus 4-percent tax.

Law Number XXI: It's easy to get a loan unless you need it.

Law Number XXII: If stock market experts were so expert, they would be buying stock, not selling advice.

Law Number XXIII: Any task can be completed in only one-third more time than is currently estimated.

Law Number XXIV: The only thing more costly than stretching the schedule of an established project is accelerating it, which is itself the most costly action known to man.

Law Number XXV: A revised schedule is to business what a new season is to an athlete or a new canvas to an artist.

Law Number XXVI: If a sufficient number of management layers are superimposed on each other, it can be assured that disaster is not left to chance.

Law Number XXVII: Rank does not intimidate hardware. Neither does the lack of rank.

Law Number XXVIII: It is better to be the reorganizer than the reorganizee.

Law Number XXIX: Executives who do not produce successful results hold on to their jobs only about five years. Those who produce effective results hang on about half a decade.

Law Number XXX: By the time the people asking the questions are ready for the answers, the people doing the work have lost track of the questions.

Law Number XXXI: The optimum committee has no members.

Law Number XXXII: Hiring consultants to conduct studies can be an excellent means of turning problems into gold, your problems into their gold.

Law Number XXXIII: Fools rush in where incumbents fear to tread.

Law Number XXXIV: The process of competitively selecting contractors to perform work is based on a system of rewards and penalties, all distributed randomly.

Law Number XXXV: The weaker the data available upon which to base one's conclusion, the greater the precision which should be quoted in order to give the data authenticity.

Law Number XXXVI: The thickness of the proposal required to win a multimillion dollar contract is about one millimeter per million dollars. If all the proposals conforming to this standard were piled on top of each other at the bottom of the Grand Canyon it would probably be a good idea.

Law Number XXXVII: Ninety percent of the time things will turn out worse than you expect. The other 10 percent of the time you had no right to expect so much.

Law Number XXXVIII: The early bird gets the worm. The early worm...gets eaten.

Law Number XXXIX: Never promise to complete any project within six months of the end of the year, in either direction.

Law Number XL: Most projects start out slowly, and then sort of taper off.

Law Number XLI: The more one produces, the less one gets.

Law Number XLII: Simple systems are not feasible because they require infinite testing.

Law Number XLIII: Hardware works best when it matters the least.

Law Number XLIV: Aircraft flight in the 21st century will always be in a westerly direction, preferably supersonic, crossing time zones to provide the additional hours needed to fix the broken electronics.

Law Number XLV: One should expect that the expected can be prevented, but the unexpected should have been expected.

Law Number XLVI: A billion saved is a billion earned.

Law Number XLVII: Two-thirds of the Earth's surface is covered with water. The other third is covered with auditors from headquarters.

Law Number XLVIII: The more time you spend talking about what you have been doing, the less time you have to spend doing what you have been talking about. Eventually, you spend more and more time talking about less and less until finally you spend all your time talking about nothing.

Law Number XLIX: Regulations grow at the same rate as weeds.

Law Number L: The average regulation has a life span one-fifth as long as a chimpanzee's and one-tenth as long as a human's, but four times as long as the official's who created it.

Law Number LI: By the time of the United States Tricentennial, there will be more government workers than there are workers.

Law Number LII: People working in the private sector should try to save money. There remains the possibility that it may someday be valuable again.

==Law 16==

[[Image:Augustine's law.svg|thumb|300px|Exponential growth of aircraft cost.]]

His most cited law is number 16, which shows that defense budgets grow linearly but the [[unit cost]] of a new military aircraft grows [[Exponential growth|exponentially]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the year 2054, the entire defense budget will purchase just one tactical aircraft. This aircraft will have to be shared by the Air Force and Navy 3½ days each per week except for leap year, when it will be made available to the Marines for the extra day."&lt;ref name=laws&gt;{{cite book

The '''BIM Collaboration Format''' ('''BCF''') is a structured file format which allows [[Issue_tracking_system|issue tracking]] with a [[Building information modeling|building information model]]. BCF is designed primarily for attaching information to collisions and errors connected with specific objects in a model, but can be used for general issue tracking in building construction projects. This allows developers of BIM-supporting software to design interfaces for collaboration between users who access the same model, especially with different software.

The format was developed by Tekla and Solibri and later adopted as a standard by [[buildingSMART]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/specifications/bcf-releases |title=BCF intro |website=www.buildingsmart-tech.org |language=en |access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable software with native support for BCF are Solibri, Tekla with plugins which provide usability for other software.

The '''Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs''' ('''OES''') is a bureau within the [[United States Department of State]]. It coordinates a portfolio of issues related to the world's oceans, environment, science and technology, and health.

==Overview==

The Bureau is headed by the [[Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs]].  As of April 2014, it is headed by acting Assistant Secretary [[Judith G. Garber|Judith Garber]]. 

The Oceans and Fisheries Directorate has two offices dedicated to international oceans issues. The Office of Marine Conservation focuses on international [[Fishery|fisheries]] matters and related problems and the Office of Oceans and Polar Affairs has primary responsibility for [[Law of the sea|international ocean law]] and policy, [[marine pollution]], [[marine mammals]], polar affairs, [[maritime boundary|maritime boundaries]], and [[marine science]].  It is headed by  Deputy Assistant Secretary David A. Balton.

The Environment Directorate deals with environmental issues including environmental aspects of international trade and safeguarding hazardous materials requiring multilateral agreements within the Office of Environmental Quality and Transboundary Affairs. The Office of Conservation and Water develops U.S. foreign policy approaches to conserving and managing the world [[ecosystem]]s and to transboundary water issues.  The Environment Directorate is headed by Deputy Assistant Secretary Daniel Reifsnyder. 

The Health, Space and Science Directorate includes the Office of International Health Affairs which works with U.S. Government agencies to facilitate policy-making regarding international [[bioterrorism]], [[infectious disease]], surveillance and response, [[environmental health]], and health in post-conflict situations. The Office of Space and Advanced Technology handles issues arising from our [[Space exploration|exploration of space]] to assure global security regarding this new frontier, and the Office of Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) Cooperation promotes the interests of the U.S. [[Scientific community|science]] and technology communities in the international policy arena, negotiates framework and other S&amp;T agreements, manages the Department's Embassy Science fellows program, and takes a leading role in representing U.S. science and technology in multilateral international organizations, such as [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]] and other [[United Nations|UN]] organizations, [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]], [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] and others. The Health, Space and Science Directorate is headed by acting Deputy Assistant Secretary Jonathan Margolis.

A '''component content management system''' ('''CCMS''') is a [[content management system]] that manages content at a granular level (component) rather than at the document level. Each component represents a single topic, concept or asset (for example an image, table, product description, a procedure). 

The CCMS must be able to track "not only versions of topics and graphics but relationships among topics, graphics, maps, publications, and deliverables." &lt;ref&gt;[[Howard Schwartz]]. "[http://www.infomanagementcenter.com/publications/e-newsletter/october-2009/why-ccm-is-not-a-cms-or-why-you-shouldnt-confuse-a-whale-with-a-fish/ Why CCM is not a CMS: Or Why You Shouldn't Confuse a Whale and a Fish]". The Center for Information-Development Management.&lt;/ref&gt;  More often than not, the CCMS also contains the publishing engine to create the final outputs for print, web and e-readers.

Components can be as large as a chapter or as small as a definition or even a word. 
Components in multiple content assemblies (content types) can be viewed as components or as traditional documents. 

Although modular documentation is not necessarily XML-based, it is usually the case. 
Standards include:

* [[Darwin Information Typing Architecture]] (DITA) (generic and adaptable)
* [[DocBook]] (generic)
* [[S1000D]] (defense, aerospace...)
* [[SCORM]] Shareable Content Object Reference Model (training and learning content)
* [[Office Open XML]] (the ISO/IEC 29500:2008 standard XML format used by e.g. Microsoft Word)

Challenges for the technical writers include [[topic-based authoring]], that is shifting from writing book-shaped, linear documentation to writing modular, structured and reusable content component.

Each component is only stored one time in the content management system, providing a single, trusted source of content (referential). These components are then reused (rather than copied and pasted) within a document or across multiple documents. 
This ensures that content is consistent across the entire documentation set.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.vasont.com/vasont/crashcourse/what_is_content_management.asp Crash Course for Content Management: What is content management?]". Vasont Systems.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each component has its own lifecycle (owner, version, approval, use) and can be tracked individually or as part of an assembly. 
Component content management is typically used for multi-channel customer-facing content (marketing, usage, learning, support). 
The solution can be a separate system or be a functionality of another [[content management]] system type (for example, [[enterprise content management]] or [[web content management system|web content management]]).

Compared to a "simple" management system, the CCMS tracks the files but also the collection of files. It tracks indirect and direct linking so that author can reuse safely content and check the applicability of changes.

==Benefits==
Benefits of managing contents at components level:

#Greater consistency and accuracy.
#Reduced maintenance costs.
#Reduced delivery costs.
#Reduced translation costs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ann Rockley]] and Steve Manning. "[http://www.dclab.com/component_content_management.asp Component content management: Overlooked by analysts; required by technical publications departments] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724002927/http://www.dclab.com/component_content_management.asp |date=2008-07-24 }}". The Rockley Group Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Traceability.

Benefits of using a component content management system:

* Version and control over the documents and the contents - reused or not.
* Check impacts on reused content changes.
* Improved collaboration and automation with workflows.

"'''Computer Says No'''", or the "'''Computer says no attitude'''", is the popular name given to an attitude seen in some public-facing organisations where the default response to a customer’s request is to check with information stored on or generated by a computer, and then make decisions based on that, often in the face of [[common sense]].

There may also be an element of deliberate unhelpfulness towards customers and service-users, whereby more ''could'' be done to reach a mutually satisfactory outcome, but is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Computer+says+no+but+we+need+our+say%3b+BEHIND+THE+HEADLINES.-a0214819160 |title=Computer Says No but We Need Our Say |work=[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]] |date=20 December 2009|last=Bird|first=Jackie |via=[[Free Online Library]] |accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name gained popularity through the British [[sketch comedy]] ''[[Little Britain]]''.&lt;ref name=bank&gt;{{cite web|author=Bank accounts |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/bank-accounts/10324271/Who-to-blame-when-computer-says-no.html |title=Who to blame when 'computer says no'? |work=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Little Britain'' ==
In ''Little Britain'', "Computer Says No" is the catchphrase of the character [[Carol Beer]] (played by [[David Walliams]]), a bank worker and later holiday rep and hospital receptionist, who always responds to a customer's enquiry by typing it into her computer and responding with "Computer Says No" to even the most reasonable of requests. When asked to do something aside from asking the computer, she would shrug and remain obstinate in her unhelpfulness, and ultimately cough in the customer's face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was also used in the Australian [[soap opera]] ''[[Neighbours]]'' in 2006 as a reference to ''Little Britain''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neighboursepisodes.com/index.php?year=2006&amp;episode=5023 |title=Neighbours Episode 5023 from 2006 |publisher=NeighboursEpisodes.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage== 
The "Computer Says No" attitude often comes from larger companies that rely on information stored electronically. When this information is not updated, it can often lead to refusals of financial products or incorrect information being sent out to customers.&lt;ref name=bank /&gt; These situations can often be resolved by an employee updating the information; however, when this cannot be done easily, the "Computer Says No" attitude can be viewed as becoming prevalent when there is unhelpfulness as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peachey |first=Kevin |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8105015.stm |title=When the bank's computer says no |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-06-17 |accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This attitude can also occur when an employee fails to read human emotion in the customer and reacts according to his or her professional training&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kane |first=Pat |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn28437-professionals-your-time-is-up-prepare-to-be-sidelined-by-tech/ |title=Professionals, your time is up, prepare to be sidelined by tech |work=New Scientist |date=2015-11-03 |accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; or relies upon a script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lythe |first=Ruth |url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-3210669/The-lives-wrecked-COMPUTER-SAYS-NO-Major-report-reveals-human-toll-inflexible-customer-service-banks-insurers.html |title=The lives wrecked because COMPUTER SAYS NO: Major report reveals human toll of inflexible customer service by banks and insurers |publisher=This is Money |date= |accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This attitude also crops up when larger companies rely on computer credit scores and do not meet with a customer to discuss his or her individual needs, instead basing a decision upon information stored in computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mortgages: 'Computer says no' issues hitting the self-employed|url=https://www.scotsman.com/business/mortgages-computer-says-no-issues-hitting-the-self-employed-1-1803711|website=[[The Scotsman]]|accessdate=12 January 2018|language=en|date=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some organisations attempt to offset this attitude by moving away from reliance on electronic information and using a human approach towards requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-31412044.html |title=Planners' move from 'computer says no' response is welcome |work=Mid-Devon Gazette |subscription=yes |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |date= |accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Computer Says No" happens in a more literal sense when computer systems employ filters that prevent messages being passed along, as when these messages are perceived to include obscenities. When information is not passed through to the person operating the computer, decisions may be made without seeing the whole picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=18:57, 15 Feb 2007 Updated 14:04, 12 Jan 2013 |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/computer-says-no-to-rude-word-1030900 |title='Computer says no' to rude word |work=Manchester Evening News |date= |accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Digital phobic''' is an informal phrase used to describe a reluctance to become fully immersed in the [[digital age]] for being fearful of how it might negatively change or alter everyday life.
 
The fast-paced development of the [[digital world]] in the twenty-first century has contributed to the [[digital divide]] becoming a very real problem for a segment of the population for whom a lack of education of, interest in, or access to [[digital device]]s has left them excluded from the technological world and fearful of its growing omnipresence.

Digital phobic is part of a growing dictionary of digital vocabulary exploring the [[social influence|social impact]] of the [[technological age]].  The phrase considers the fears associated with [[technological evolution]] and change, and acknowledges the possibility of exclusion as a result of a rising reliance on technology in day-to-day life.

==Discourse==
Everyday use of technology has increased dramatically since the turn of the century, significantly impacting both those embracing [[technological change]] as well as those reluctant to be a part of it.

A sharp rise in technological innovations during the 21st century has been responsible for changing much of the way we work, socialize, and learn – all of which can be at the foundation of distrust in the technological age.  Psychologists, academics and researchers have begun to consider the base of these fears and consider the social, cultural and environmental circumstances which might catalyze someone to becoming 'digital phobic'.

[[Technophobia]] is used to discuss a fear of advanced technology in a formal capacity and can stem from a number, and combination of, concerns.  With the oncoming of the [[digital age]], worries have broadened from the very earliest fears that technology would eradicate artisanship to concerns over [[data protection]], [[Economic security|financial security]], [[identity theft]], [[technical inability]] and [[invasion of privacy]].

There is no exhaustible list of reasons cited for fearing the digital world and, whilst research into both the cause and consequence of developing a digital phobia remains in its infancy, the presence of digital phobia regardless contributes towards an increasingly comprehensive picture of a series of profiles among digital users.
 
Recent research from Foresters, an international financial services organization, found 2% of the UK population to fall into this category of [[internet user]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/digital-addict--or-just-checking-your-facebook-page-a-quarter-of-all-men-and-women-spend-an-unhealthy-amount-of-time-online-9506966.html Paul Gallagher.  Digital Addict – or just checking your Facebook page?  A quarter of all men and women spend an 'unhealthy amount of time online'.  The Independent.  8 June 2014.  Accessed: 27 August 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;   A further breakdown of this statistic, sees the percentage of users in development of a digital phobia increase, with 4% fearful of [[online shopping]] for worrying that someone will steal their card details, and 12% fearful that using social media will make it easier for people to find their personal details.

When asked to reason their attitude towards technology as part of this survey, a larger percentage of the UK population were revealed to be fearful of the impact it could be having on more traditional means of doing things. 31% believed technology was preventing us from communicating properly, while 32% thought advances in technology will result in long-held [[loss of tradition|traditions being lost]].

This fear has only been exacerbated over time as more and more data-holding, services and opportunities are transferred to the digital realm, and both the perceived and real nature of security and vulnerability risks increases.  Worrying levels of time spent on devices, the invasion of privacy or the possible misuse or [[data abuse|abuse]] of [[personal data]] entrusted to online sources are all contributing towards the development of a digital phobia among a proportion of the population.

Concerns about the negative, exclusionary or divisive consequences of living within a digital society are being voiced from various global platforms. April 2014 research conducted by [[Pew Research Center]], in association with [[Smithsonian Magazine]], revealed concerns about anticipated technological developments over the next half-century.  30% of Americans surveyed feared that technological changes would lead to a future in which people are worse off than they are at the time of being surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Aaron|last=Smith|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/04/17/us-views-of-technology-and-the-future/|title=Future of Technology - Pew Research Center|date=17 April 2014|work=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|accessdate=August 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Considered amid reports of dis-interest in the internet among Japan's residents despite its reputation as a high-tech nation, these reports contribute towards a growing understanding that high-tech advancements are not universally celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10543126.  Michael Fitzpatrick.  Revealing Japan's Low Tech Belly.  BBC News.  13 July 2010.  Accessed: 20 August 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the May 2014 "[[right to be forgotten]]" ruling put in place in the European Union which allows internet users to request for their internet history to be un-searchable if deemed incorrect, outdated or irrelevant, and the thousands of requests received in the first few days following its announcement documents a, perhaps previously hidden, widespread fear of leaving a digital footprint and/or being falsely represented online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/26/google-removing-right-to-be-forgotten-links|author=Charles Arthur|title=Google removing 'right to be forgotten' search links in Europe|journal=The Guardian|date=27 June 2014|accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Digital phobia is part of a wider societal conversation on how we relate to, trust in, and interact with technology and considers the potentially negative implications of what otherwise appears to be a positive advancement of the modern world. 
 
This phrase has been developed by Foresters, the international financial services organisation, for the purpose of describing attitudes to technology among the UK population.

Developed within a digital vocabulary consisting of four other phrases ([[digital addict]], [[digital omnivore]], digital agnostic, digital denier), digital phobic is part of a scale of social description for online behavior within the digital age.

The phrase has been used as part of discussion on the more general use of technology within the 21st century and the importance of striking a balance between time spent on and offline.  Research conducted by Foresters in association with Tech Timeout,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techtimeout.com/|title=Tech Timeout|work=Tech Timeout|accessdate=October 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a social communications initiative considering the role of technology in contemporary society, formed the basis of the descriptor and identified the key traits of each type of digital user based on answers from over 1,000 UK respondents. 
 
Both anecdotal and research-based evidence suggests categories of internet use, whilst they cannot be linearly divided, are able to loosely describe attitudes to technology in society.  The developed phrases are able to be used to greater understand and contextualize how new and existing technology is viewed and have been cited in international [[online newspaper]]s and [[blog post]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/technology/news/article.cfm?c_id=5&amp;objectid=11270004.|title=Digital addict - spending an 'unhealthy' amount of time online|work=The New Zealand Herald|date=June 8, 2014|accessdate=August 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst this phrase and definition were developed specifically from research on UK technology-users, the phrase is not UK-specific and is designed to be indicative of a global community of technology users who share in these characteristics.

==Social and cultural impact==
Digital phobia presents a real and pressing problem in the modern world where technology has become a central and essential resource.  [[Internet culture]] has developed to become a part of the fabric of [[everyday life]] and is now even considered part of the make-up of [[national identity]] with a country's internet use and [[digital footprint]] an important modern index for international comparison, often associated with development and [[modernity]].

The consequences of [[non-participation]] in the digital world are far reaching, and can affect the economic, cultural, social, occupational and educational life of a non-user.  For example, in 2009 [[Price Waterhouse Coopers]] estimated that UK households offline are missing out on savings of £560 a year which could be saved if shopping or paying for bills online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalbirmingham.co.uk/downloads/pwc_report.pdf |format=PDF |work=Pricewaterhouse Coopers LLP. |title=Champion for Digital Inclusion: The Economic Case for Digital Inclusion |date=October 2009 |accessdate=August 27, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329114456/http://www.digitalbirmingham.co.uk/downloads/pwc_report.pdf |archivedate=March 29, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, in the United States older people without internet access or the skills to make the most of it are considered a disadvantaged proportion of the population as, amongst other important resources, vital healthcare information and initiatives conducted online are unavailable to those not a part of the digital world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kaitlin |last=Roberts|url=http://theweek.com/article/index/262309/how-the-digital-divide-hurts-the-elderly-in-times-of-crisis|title=How the digital divide hurts the elderly in times of crisis|work=theweek.com|date=May 30, 2014|accessdate=June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heightened fears of how technology may be affecting the human population stems from a, for some very logical, fear of how technology is adapting the world we live in and at the pace and price with which it is doing so.  With such a significance placed on [[online participation]], concerns about the role of the internet in everyday life are not unfounded and not exclusive to those who prefer to stay away from the internet, avoid certain activities online, or use the internet without enthusiasm and only as necessitated.

A survey conducted by security firm [[Avira]] identified 84% of people fear [[social networking site]]s will steal or misuse their personal information,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Matt |last=Liebowitz|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/47264062/ns/technology_and_science-security/t/people-fear-social-media/%20-%20.U5rM8yxOXL8#.U6rR8SxOXL8|title=84% of People Fear Social Media|work=msnbc.com|date= February 5, 2012|accessdate=June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrating the net majority of internet users share, at least partially, in distrusting the digital world. Whilst many will, despite this fear, adopt cautious optimism and still use social networking as part of their everyday lives this high percentage serves to demonstrate that a fear significant enough for some to avoid readily using online and [[digital service]]s is a fear shared by a large number of internet users.

Whilst some digital phobics have preferred to remain distanced from technology due to hypothetical concerns others have attempted to join in societal interest but find themselves unable to stay caught up with new technology or would like to see its progression halted as evolution of the [[digital world]] has reached new speeds. The 2013 [[Oxford Internet Survey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxis.oii.ox.ac.uk/sites/oxis.oii.ox.ac.uk/files/content/files/publications/OxIS_2013.pdf |format=PDF |first1=William H. |last1=Dutton |first2=Grant |last2=Blank |title=Cultures of the Internet: The Internet in Britain |work=The Oxford Internet Survey 2013 |accessdate=June 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602045751/http://oxis.oii.ox.ac.uk/sites/oxis.oii.ox.ac.uk/files/content/files/publications/OxIS_2013.pdf |archivedate=June 2, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; recognizes this concern among UK users, identifying distinct categories of both non-users and ex-users of internet-based technology who, for a variety of reasons, have discontinued or refuse to access the online world.  This is further supported by results from a 2013 survey of internet use in America&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kathryn |last=Zickuhr|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/09/25/whos-not-online-and-why/|title=Who's Not Online and Why|date=25 September 2013|work=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|accessdate=August 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which found 32% of non-internet users avoiding the online world because of finding the internet difficult or frustrating to use, being physically unable or worried about other issues such as viruses, threat of hacking or spam – a figure considerably higher than in earlier years.

Concern over the presence of a [[digital divide]], whether locally or globally, is only exacerbated by the knowledge that access to many government and council services, [[job application]]s, and social and cultural resources are now largely internet based. [[Internet access]] has become a hurdle in contemporary society which, for those without the necessary desire to learn or knowledge of internet-based systems, can be difficult to navigate around, often resulting in key services and vital resources being less easily accessible, leaving non-users feeling isolated.  Private and government campaigns to tackle this issue further demonstrate the severity and long-lasting impact of having a proportion of the population disinclined or disinterested in going online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jenny |last=Hirschkon|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/finance/your-bank/10890366/elderly-help-internet.html|title=Connecting the elderly with internet know-how|date=June 12, 2014|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kathy |last=Settle|url=https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/04/14/digital-inclusion-strategy-launches-today/|title=Digital Inclusion Strategy launches today|work=blog.gov.uk|date=April 14, 2014| accessdate=June 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the online world becomes saturated, device options for connecting to the internet vary and news of technological inventions goes [[viral marketing|viral]] the [[exponential growth]] of the technological world is only contributing towards a growing number of 'digital phobic' tech-users amongst the [[global population]].

== Education ==
Digital phobia has had a negative impact on the field of education. Some teachers have expressed a fear that new and advanced technology is supplanting them as the masters of their fields of study and a study of teachers in Wilmington, Delaware has shown that educators in this area are acclimating to the new technology in their classrooms at a slower pace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2015/06/11/why-ed-tech-is-not-transforming-how.html|title=Why Ed Tech Is Not Transforming How Teachers Teach|work=Education Week|access-date=2017-12-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The local researchers believe that there are many factors why that is the case and some of the things they have found are things such as a lack of technological education by the teachers, and also the lack of time, or incentive to adjust to the new technology. University Larry Cuban has stated that "The introduction of computers into school was supposed to improve academic achievement , and alter how teachers taught. Neither has occurred."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2015/06/11/why-ed-tech-is-not-transforming-how.html|title=Why Ed Tech Is Not Transforming How Teachers Teach|work=Education Week|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The constant infusion of new technology has many teachers fearing that they are losing their classroom. This new technology is essentially diminishing the role of a teacher in the classroom.

Researchers believe that educators are slow to adapt to technology because they aren't given time to acclimate to the new technology, causing them to hesitate to use it in the classroom and express fear that these technologies may interfere with genuine learning particularly in humanities and creative subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2005/sep/13/schools.news1|title=Report reveals teachers' fear of classroom technology|last=Curtis|first=Polly|date=2005-09-13|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-12-06|last2=correspondent|first2=education|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article for the ''New Media Reader,'' Theodor H. Nelson wrote that people are opposed to the computer because they believe it is "cold" and "inhuman", but a human can be just as inhuman and maybe even more so than the actual machine itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50096832|title=The NewMediaReader|date=2003|publisher=MIT Press|others=Wardrip-Fruin, Noah., Montfort, Nick.|isbn=9780262232272|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=50096832}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6660">'''Dispositif''' is a term used by the French intellectual [[Michel Foucault]], generally to refer to the various institutional, physical, and administrative mechanisms and knowledge structures which enhance and maintain the exercise of [[Power (philosophy)|power]] within the social body.

==Translation==
Dispositif is translated variously, even in the same book, as 'device', 'machinery', 'apparatus', 'construction', and 'deployment'.

== Definition ==

Foucault uses the term in his 1977 "The Confession of the Flesh" interview, where he answers the question, "What is the meaning or methodological function for you of this term, [[Apparatus theory|apparatus]] (dispositif)?" as follows:

:''"What I'm trying to pick out with this term is, firstly, a thoroughly heterogeneous ensemble consisting of discourses, institutions, architectural forms, regulatory decisions, laws, administrative measures, scientific statements, philosophical, moral and philanthropic propositions–in short, the said as much as the unsaid. Such are the elements of the apparatus. The apparatus itself is the system of relations that can be established between these elements."''&lt;ref&gt;"The Confession of the Flesh" (1977) interview. In Power/Knowledge Selected Interviews and Other Writings (ed Colin Gordon), 1980: pp. 194–228.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://foucaultblog.wordpress.com/2007/04/01/what-is-the-dispositif "What is the ''dispositive''?"] Foucault Blog, April 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German linguist [[Siegfried Jäger]] defines Foucault's ''dispositif'' as

:''"the interaction of discursive behavior (i. e. speech and thoughts based upon a shared knowledge pool), non-discursive behavior (i. e. acts based upon knowledge), and manifestations of knowledge by means of acts or behaviors ''...''. ''Dispositifs'' can thus be imagined as a kind of ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'', the complexly interwoven and integrated ''dispositifs'' add up in their entirety to a ''dispositif'' of all society."''&lt;ref&gt;''"das Zusammenspiel diskursiver Praxen (= Sprechen und Denken auf der Grundlage von Wissen), nichtdiskursiver Praxen (= Handeln auf der Grundlage von Wissen) und „Sichtbarkeiten“ bzw. „Vergegenständlichungen“ (von Wissen durch Handeln/Tätigkeit) ''...''. Dispositive kann man sich insofern auch als eine Art „Gesamtkunstwerke“ vorstellen, die – vielfältig  miteinander verzahnt und verwoben – ein gesamtgesellschaftliches Dispositiv ausmachen."'', [http://www.diss-duisburg.de/Internetbibliothek/Artikel/Aspekte_einer_Kritischen_Diskursanalyse.htm Siegfried Jäger: Theoretische und methodische Aspekte einer Kritischen Diskurs- und Dispositivanalyse]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Danish philosopher Raffnsøe "advances the 'dispositive' (le dispositif) as a key conception in Foucault's work" and "a resourceful approach to the study of contemporary societal problems."&lt;ref&gt;What is a dispositive? Foucault's historical mappings of the networks of social reality" https://www.academia.edu/9838825/What_is_a_dispositive_Foucault_s_historical_mappings_of_the_networks_of_social_reality&lt;/ref&gt; According to Raffnsøe, "the dispositionally prescriptive level is a crucial aspect of social reality in organizational life, since it has a determining effect on what is taken for granted and considered real. Furthermore, it determines not only what is and can be considered possible but also what can even be imagined and anticipated as potentially realizable, as something one can hope for, or act to bring about".&lt;ref&gt;Foucault's dispositive: The perspicacity of dispositive analytics in organizational Research": 21

=== Agamben's delineation ===
The Italian political philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] traces the trajectory of the term to [[Aristotle]]'s ''oikonomia—the effective management of the household''  and the early Church Fathers' attempt to save the concept of the Trinity from the allegation of polytheism, as the triplicity of the God is his oikonomia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=jDGrBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=dispositif+agamben+dictionary&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=98j4y5vhL5&amp;sig=QBqpf3kZtb92q246YMByRdoidmE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwieqfWgz_7PAhUIL48KHYe9DoIQ6AEIHTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=dispositif%20agamben%20dictionary&amp;f=false|title=Agamben Dictionary|last=Murray|first=Alex|date=2011-06-06|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=9780748646982|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Agamben defines the ''apparatus''/''dispositif'' as

:''"Further expanding the already large class of Foucauldian apparatuses, I shall call an apparatus literally anything that has in some way the capacity to capture, orient, determine, intercept, model, control, or secure the gestures, behaviors, opinions, or discourses of living beings. Not only, therefore, prisons, madhouses, the panopticon, schools, confession, factories, disciplines, judicial measures, and so forth (whose connection with power is in a certain sense evident), but also the pen, writing, literature, philosophy, agriculture, cigarettes, navigation, computers, cellular telephones and—why not—language itself, which is perhaps the most ancient of apparatuses—one in which thousands and thousands of years ago a primate inadvertently let himself be captured, probably without realizing the consequences that he was about to face."''&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio Agamben, "What is an Apparatus?" in ''What is an Apparatus? And Other Essays''. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2009: p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian scholar Matteo Pasquinelli criticises Agamben's genealogy with these words

:''"The dispositif is traced back, theoretically and philologically, to the definition of social normativity that Foucault takes from Canguilhem's The Normal and the Pathological (1966) and to the use of the term dispositif by Canguilhem himself in the essay "Machine and Organism" (1952). Both these lineages proceed from the notion of organic normativity that Canguilhem adopts from the German-Jewish neurologist Kurt Goldstein, that is from a tradition of Lebensphilosophie that appears to be incompatible with Agamben's theological thesis."''&lt;ref&gt;Matteo Pasquinelli, "What an Apparatus is Not: On the Archeology of the Norm in Foucault, Canguilhem, and Goldstein". Parrhesia 22,  2015, 79-89. [http://matteopasquinelli.com/what-an-apparatus-is-not/ PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12339">'''Document automation''' (also known as '''document assembly''') is the design of systems and [[workflow]]s that assist in the creation of [[electronic document]]s. These include logic-based systems that use segments of pre-existing text and/or data to assemble a new document. This process is increasingly used within certain industries to assemble legal documents, contracts and letters. Document automation systems can also be used to automate all conditional text, variable text, and data contained within a set of documents.

Automation systems allow companies to minimize data entry, reduce the time spent proof-reading, and reduce the risks associated with [[human error]]. Additional benefits include: time and financial savings due to decreased paper handling, document loading, storage, distribution, postage/shipping, faxes, telephone, labor and waste.

== Document assembly ==
The basic functions are to replace the cumbersome manual filling in of repetitive documents with template-based systems where the user answers software-driven interview questions or data entry screen. The information collected then populates the document to form a good first draft'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ijlit.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/15/2/170 Article: Disrupting Conventional Law Firm Business Models using Document Assembly] Mountain, Int J Law Info Tech., 2006; 0: eal019v1&lt;/ref&gt; Today's more advanced document automation systems allow users to create their own data and rules (logic) without the need for programming.

While document automation software is used primarily in the [[law|legal]], [[financial services]], and [[risk management]] industries, it can be used in any industry that creates transaction-based documents.  A good example of how document automation software can be used is with [[commercial mortgage]] documents. A typical commercial mortgage transaction can include several documents including:
* [[promissory note]]
* environmental indemnity
* [[trust deed (real estate)|trust deed]]
* [[mortgage law|mortgage]]
* [[guaranty]]
Some of these documents can contain as many as 80 to 100 pages, with hundreds of optional paragraphs and data elements. Document automation software has the ability to automatically fill in the correct document variables based on the transaction data. In addition, some document automation software has the ability to create a document suite where all related documents are encapsulated into one file, making updates and collaboration easy and fast. Established companies in this field includes the likes of Contract Express from Thomson Reuters

Simpler software applications that are easier to learn can also be used to automate the preparation of documents, without undue complexity. For example, Pathagoras holds itself out as a 'plain text, no fields allowed' document assembly system. Clipboard managers allow the user to save frequently-used text fragments, organize them into logical groups, and then quickly access them to paste into final documents.

== In supply chain management ==
There are many documents used in [[logistics]]. They are called: [[invoice]]s, [[packing list]]s/slips/sheets (manifests), content lists, pick tickets, arrival acknowledgement [[form (document)|form]]s/[[reports]] of many types (e.g. [[MSDS]], damaged goods, returned goods, detailed/summary, etc.), [[import]]/[[export]], [[Delivery (commerce)|delivery]], [[bill of lading]] (BOL), etc. These documents are usually the [[contracts]] between the [[consignee]] and the [[consignor]], so they are very important for both parties and any intermediary, like a [[third party logistics]] company (3PL) and [[governments]]. [[Document]] handling within [[logistics]], [[supply chain management]] and [[distribution center]]s is usually performed [[manual labor]] or semi-automatically using [[bar code scanner]]s, [[software]] and tabletop [[laser printer]]s. There are some [[manufacturer]]s of high speed document automation systems that will automatically compare the laser printed document to the order and either insert or automatically apply an enclosed [[wallet]]/pouch to the [[shipping container]] (usually a flexible [[polybag]] or [[corrugated fiberboard]]/rigid container). See below for external website video links showing these document automation systems. Protection of Privacy and [[Identity Theft]] are major concerns, especially with the increase of [[e-Commerce]], [[Internet]]/[[Online shopping]] and [[Shopping channel]] (other, past references are catalogue and [[mail order]] shopping) making it more important than ever to guarantee the correct document is married or associated to the correct order or shipment every time. Software that produce documents are: [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]], [[Warehouse management system|WMS]], [[Transportation management system|TMS]], legacy [[middleware]] and most accounting packages.{{cn|date=January 2015}}

A number of research projects have looked into wider [[standardization]] and automation of documents in the [[Freight transport|freight industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efreightproject.eu/default.aspx|title=e-FREIGHT is an Integrated project within the EU's 7th Framework programme|publisher=e-Freight|accessdate=23 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530094924/http://www.efreightproject.eu/default.aspx|archivedate=30 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[IATA]]. [http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/e/Pages/cargo-xml.aspx Cargo-XML Standards: Modernizing air cargo communication].&lt;/ref&gt;

== In legal services ==
The role of automation technology in the production of legal documents has been widely recognised. For example, [[Richard Susskind]]’s book ‘The End of Lawyers’ looks at the use of document automation software that enables clients to generate employment contracts and Wills with the use of an online interview or decision tree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/blogs/in-business-blog/who039s-afraid-computer-generation Article Who's afraid of computer generation?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231175351/http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/blogs/in-business-blog/who039s-afraid-computer-generation |date=2010-12-31 }} Eduardo Reyes (Thursday 28 October 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Susskind regards Document Assembly as one of 10 '[[disruptive technology|disruptive technologies]]' that are altering the face of the legal profession.&lt;ref&gt;The End of Lawyers?: Rethinking the Nature of Legal Services Richard Susskind OBE Oxford University Press, USA (January 15, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In large law firms document assembly systems are increasingly being used to systemise work, such as complex term sheets and the first drafts of credit agreements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.information-age.com/channels/information-management/features/1307743/part_3/swift-justice.thtml Article: Swift Justice] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713034239/http://www.information-age.com/channels/information-management/features/1307743/part_3/swift-justice.thtml |date=July 13, 2011 }} Pete Swabey (20 December 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legaltechnologyjournal.co.uk/content/view/31/50/ Article: Client services - Distance relationships] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102162255/http://www.legaltechnologyjournal.co.uk/content/view/31/50/ |date=2010-11-02 }} Marc-Henri Chamay Legal Technology Journal&lt;/ref&gt;

These and other sites are incorporating artificial intelligence into their document automation software.&lt;ref&gt;https://mashable.com/2017/12/15/artificial-intelligence-domestic-violence-restraining-orders/#GdGZX570Xmqi&lt;/ref&gt;

== In insurance ==
Insurance policies and certificates, depending on the type, policy documents can also be hundreds of pages long and include specific information on the insured.  Typically, in the past, these insurance document packets were created by a) typing out free-form letters, b) adding pre-printed brochures c) editing templates and d) customizing graphics with the required information, then manually sorting and inserting all the documents into one packet and mailing them to the insured. The various documents included in one packet could include the following kinds of documents:
* Welcome letter
* Contract
* Certificate
* State-specific policy documents
* Listing of items insured and insurance amounts
* Amendments
* Riders
* ID card
* Company information
* Marketing material (other products)

A lot of work can go into putting one packet together.  In most policy admin systems, the system will generate some kind of policy statement as a starting point but might need to be customized and enhanced with other required materials.

The site's [[tagline]] is "The Definitive DVD Backup Resource".

Started in March 2000, the site has expanded to contain a wide range of information on the subject of digital video encoding and [[DVD]] backup (or [[ripping]]).&lt;ref name='coded'&gt;{{cite news|last1=Woodward|first1=Matt|title=7 codec round-up at Doom9|url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2003/05/305-2/|accessdate=22 November 2017|publisher=Ars Technica|date=5 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cat and Mouse Copy Protection|journal=Maximum PC|date=May 2007|pages=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PQIAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=doom9&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NM_Y9DeZER&amp;sig=n9rV_ZzrH-0M-28UYbm0xQlLiTY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYqbnQpdPXAhVK0oMKHTtRAwA4HhDoAQgyMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=doom9&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular sections of the site were the guides to DVD ripping and the annual codec comparisons, where popular digital video [[codec]]s were compared on the basis of quality, speed, and compression.&lt;ref name='coded' /&gt; The forum is frequented by many developers of the tools and codecs featured on the site,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirk|first1=Jeremy|title=Hacker strips DRM from streaming Netflix movies|url=https://www.macworld.com/article/1059410/netflix.html|accessdate=22 November 2017|publisher=MacWorld|date=9 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Windows Media DRM#Removal|FairUse4WM]]. The site has been criticized, as the techniques described by it can be used for [[copyright infringement]], but it maintains that its guides should only be used for [[fair use]]. In some cases, users suspected of illegally copying media are refused help on the forums.{{Cn|date=October 2018}}

The [[VirtualDubMod]] project began after many modifications to [[VirtualDub]] were posted on the Doom9 forums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buechler|first1=Georgios Diamantopoulos, Sohail Salehi, John|title=Learning VirtualDub the complete guide to capturing, processing, and encoding digital video|date=2005|publisher=Packt Pub.|location=Birmingham, UK|isbn=9781847190246|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=apiArMc8t9MC&amp;pg=PT42&amp;lpg=PT42&amp;dq=VirtualDubMod+project+doom9&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=z59Ar4NtBA&amp;sig=B3qtl8OvCQhCaR7voUZ69bnCO44&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjE_7mJptPXAhWJyoMKHV30AXQQ6AEIQjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=VirtualDubMod%20project%20doom9&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doom9 gained notoriety as a result of its involvement in the [[AACS encryption key controversy]]. The utility [[BackupHDDVD]] was first posted by a Doom9 poster using the alias ''muslix64''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McMillian|first1=Robert|title=Hacker: Blu-ray, HD DVD copy protection cracked|url=https://www.infoworld.com/article/2659617/security/hacker--blu-ray--hd-dvd-copy-protection-cracked.html|accessdate=22 November 2017|publisher=Info World|date=29 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest information on how to find title and volume keys was also first revealed on Doom9 forums, by other users. The key that set off the controversy was also first posted by a user using the name ''arnezami''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=REIMER|first1=Jeremy|title=Crack in Blu-ray, HD DVD encryption gets wider|url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2007/02/8837/|accessdate=22 November 2017|publisher=Ars Technica|date=13 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doom9 is also known for being the main discussion forum for many major video encoding tools, such as [[x264]], [[AviSynth]] and [[MeGUI]].

== Projects ==
Due to the concentration of forum members who have technical backgrounds, there have been various software projects developed and maintained by forum members. These include:
*[[Media Player Classic Home Cinema]], a lightweight media player using the [[DirectShow]] API
*[[ffdshow-tryouts]], a collection of free software codecs, most notably [[libavcodec]], provided as DirectShow filters

Doom9 members have also contributed significantly to various software projects, including:
*[[x264]], a free software H.264 video encoder
*[[VirtualDubMod]], a video capture and linear editing tool

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3208">'''External Machine Interface''' ('''EMI'''), an extension to '''Universal Computer Protocol''' ('''UCP'''), is a [[Communications protocol|protocol]] primarily used to connect to [[short message service centre]]s (SMSCs) for [[mobile telephone]]s.  The protocol was developed by [[CMG (company)|CMG]] Wireless Data Solutions, now part of [[Mavenir]].
==Syntax==

A typical EMI/UCP exchange looks like this :

  ^B01/00045/O/30/66677789///1//////68656C6C6F/CE^C
  ^B01/00041/R/30/A//66677789:180594141236/F3^C

The start of the [[Packet (information technology)|packet]] is signaled by ^B (STX, hex 02) and the end with ^C (ETX, hex 03).  Fields within the packet are separated by / characters.

The first four fields form the mandatory header.   the third is the ''operation type'' (O for operation, R for result), and the fourth is the ''operation'' (here 30, "short message transfer").

The subsequent fields are dependent on the operation.  In the first line above, '66677789' is the recipient's address ([[telephone number]]) and '68656C6C6F' is the content of the message, in this case the [[ASCII]] string "hello".  The second line is the response with a matching transaction reference number, where 'A' indicates that the message was successfully acknowledged by the SMSC, and a timestamp is suffixed to the phone number to show time of delivery.

The final field is the [[checksum]], calculated simply by summing all bytes in the packet (including slashes) and taking the 8 [[least significant bit]]s from the result.

The full specification is available on the LogicaCMG website developers' forum, but registration is required.

== Technical limitations ==

The two-digit ''transaction reference number'' means that an entity sending text messages can only have 100 outstanding messages (per session); this can limit performance, but only over a slow network and with incorrectly configured applications on one's SMSC (for example one session, with number of windows greater than 100). In practice it does not have any impact on delivery throughput.

The EMI UCP documentation specifies a default alphabet of [[ITU T.50 | IRA]] (eq ASCII on 7bit). In practice users default to the [[GSM_03.38|GSM-7]] alphabet, which is almost the same as ASCII on 7 bit, except for a few characters - for example '_' (underline).

== Alternatives ==

* [[Short message peer-to-peer protocol]] (SMPP) also provides [[Short message service|SMS]] over [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]]/[[Internet Protocol|IP]].
* [[CIMD|Computer Interface for Message Distribution (CIMD)]] developed by [[Nokia]]

'''Existential risk from artificial general intelligence''' is the hypothesis that substantial progress in [[artificial general intelligence]] (AGI) could someday result in [[human extinction]] or some other unrecoverable [[global catastrophic risk|global catastrophe]].&lt;ref name="aima"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Russell |first1=Stuart |author1-link=Stuart J.

If AI surpasses humanity in general intelligence and becomes "[[superintelligence|superintelligent]]", then this new superintelligence could become powerful and difficult to control. Just as the fate of the [[mountain gorilla]] depends on human goodwill, so might the fate of humanity depend on the actions of a future machine superintelligence.&lt;ref name="superintelligence"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bostrom|first1=Nick|author-link=Nick Bostrom|title=[[Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies]]|date=2014|isbn=0199678111|edition=First|quote=}}&lt;!-- preface --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The likelihood of this type of scenario is widely debated, and hinges in part on differing scenarios for future progress in computer science.&lt;ref name="givewell"&gt;{{cite report |author=GiveWell |authorlink=GiveWell |date=2015 |title=Potential risks from advanced artificial intelligence |url=http://www.givewell.org/labs/causes/ai-risk |publisher= |page= |docket= |accessdate=11 October 2015 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the exclusive domain of [[AI takeovers in popular culture|science fiction]], concerns about superintelligence started to become mainstream in the 2010s, and were popularized by public figures such as [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Bill Gates]], and [[Elon Musk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Parkin|first1=Simon|title=Science fiction no more? Channel 4’s Humans and our rogue AI obsessions|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/14/science-fiction-no-more-humans-tv-artificial-intelligence|accessdate=5 February 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=14 June 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One source of concern is that a sudden and unexpected "[[intelligence explosion]]" might take an unprepared human race by surprise. For example, in one scenario, the first-generation computer program found able to broadly match the effectiveness of an AI researcher is able to rewrite its algorithms and double its speed or capabilities in six months of massively parallel processing time. The second-generation program is expected to take three months to perform a similar chunk of work, on average; in practice, doubling its own capabilities may take longer if it experiences a mini-"AI winter", or may be quicker if it undergoes a miniature "AI Spring" where ideas from the previous generation are especially easy to mutate into the next generation. In this scenario the system undergoes an unprecedently large number of generations of improvement in a short time interval, jumping from subhuman performance in many areas to superhuman performance in all relevant areas.&lt;ref name="aima"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yudkowsky-global-risk"/&gt; More broadly, examples like arithmetic and [[Go (game)|Go]] show that progress from human-level AI to superhuman ability is sometimes extremely rapid.&lt;ref name=skeptic/&gt;

A second source of concern is that controlling a superintelligent machine (or even instilling it with human-compatible values) may be an even harder problem than naïvely supposed. Some AGI researchers believe that a superintelligence would naturally resist attempts to shut it off, and that preprogramming a superintelligence with complicated human values may be an extremely difficult technical task.&lt;ref name="aima"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yudkowsky-global-risk"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yudkowsky |first1=Eliezer |title=Artificial Intelligence as a Positive and Negative Factor in Global Risk |journal=Global Catastrophic Risks |date=2008 |pages=308-345 |url=https://intelligence.org/files/AIPosNegFactor.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, skeptics such as Facebook's [[Yann LeCun]] argue that superintelligent machines will have no desire for self-preservation.&lt;ref name=vanity/&gt;

== Overview ==
''[[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach]]'', the standard undergraduate AI textbook,&lt;ref name=slate_killer&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tilli|first1=Cecilia|title=Killer Robots? Lost Jobs?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2016/04/the_threats_that_artificial_intelligence_researchers_actually_worry_about.html|accessdate=15 May 2016|work=Slate|date=28 April 2016|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Norvig vs. Chomsky and the Fight for the Future of AI|url=http://www.tor.com/2011/06/21/norvig-vs-chomsky-and-the-fight-for-the-future-of-ai/|website=Tor.com|accessdate=15 May 2016|date=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; assesses that superintelligence "might mean the end of the human race": "Almost any technology has the potential to cause harm in the wrong hands, but with (superintelligence), we have the new problem that the wrong hands might belong to the technology itself."&lt;ref name=aima/&gt; Even if the system designers have good intentions, two difficulties are common to both AI and non-AI computer systems:&lt;ref name=aima/&gt;

* The system's implementation may contain initially-unnoticed routine but catastrophic bugs. An analogy is space probes: despite the knowledge that bugs in expensive space probes are hard to fix after launch, engineers have historically not been able to prevent catastrophic bugs from occurring.&lt;ref name=skeptic/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Phil|title=Houston, we have a bug: 9 famous software glitches in space|url=https://www.itworld.com/article/2823083/enterprise-software/88716-8-famous-software-bugs-in-space.html|accessdate=5 February 2018|work=[[IT World]]|date=30 July 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* No matter how much time is put into pre-deployment design, a system's specifications often result in [[unintended consequences|unintended behavior]] the first time it encounters a new scenario. For example, Microsoft's [[Tay (bot)|Tay]] behaved inoffensively during pre-deployment testing, but was too easily baited into offensive behavior when interacting with real users.&lt;ref name=vanity/&gt;

AI systems uniquely add a third difficulty: the problem that even given "correct" requirements, bug-free implementation, and initial good behavior, an AI system's dynamic "learning" capabilities may cause it to "evolve into a system with unintended behavior", even without the stress of new unanticipated external scenarios. An AI may partly botch an attempt to design a new generation of itself and accidentally create a successor AI that is more powerful than itself, but that no longer maintains the human-compatible moral values preprogrammed into the original AI. For a self-improving AI to be completely safe, it would not only need to be "bug-free", but it would need to be able to design successor systems that are also "bug-free".&lt;ref name="aima"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yampolskiy|first1=Roman V.|title=Utility function security in artificially intelligent agents|journal=Journal of Experimental &amp; Theoretical Artificial Intelligence|date=8 April 2014|volume=26|issue=3|pages=373–389|doi=10.1080/0952813X.2014.895114|quote=Nothing precludes sufficiently smart self-improving systems from optimising their reward mechanisms in order to optimisetheir current-goal achievement and in the process making a mistake leading to corruption of their reward functions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All three of these difficulties become catastrophes rather than nuisances in any scenario where the superintelligence labeled as "malfunctioning" correctly predicts that humans will attempt to shut it off, and successfully deploys its superintelligence to outwit such attempts.

Citing major advances in the field of AI and the potential for AI to have enormous long-term benefits or costs, the 2015 [[Open Letter on Artificial Intelligence]] stated:

{{cquote|The progress in AI research makes it timely to focus research not only on making AI more capable, but also on maximizing the societal benefit of AI. Such considerations motivated the [[Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence|AAAI]] 2008-09 Presidential Panel on Long-Term AI Futures and other projects on AI impacts, and constitute a significant expansion of the field of AI itself, which up to now has focused largely on techniques that are neutral with respect to purpose. We recommend expanded research aimed at ensuring that increasingly capable AI systems are robust and beneficial: our AI systems must do what we want them to do.}}

This letter was signed by a number of leading AI researchers in academia and industry, including AAAI president Thomas Dietterich, [[Eric Horvitz]], [[Bart Selman]], [[Francesca Rossi]], [[Yann LeCun]], and the founders of [[Vicarious (company)|Vicarious]] and [[Google DeepMind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Priorities for Robust and Beneficial Artificial Intelligence: an Open Letter|url=http://futureoflife.org/misc/open_letter|publisher=[[Future of Life Institute]]|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In  1863 [[Darwin among the Machines]], an essay by [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]] stated:&lt;ref&gt;Breuer, Hans-Peter. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/436868 'Samuel Butler's "the Book of the Machines" and the Argument from Design.'] Modern Philology, Vol. 72, No. 4 (May 1975), pp. 365–383&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quote| The upshot is simply a question of time, but that the time will come when the machines will hold the real supremacy over the world and its inhabitants is what no person of a truly philosophic mind can for a moment question.}}
Butler developed this  into ''The Book of the Machines'', three chapters of ''[[Erewhon]]'', published anonymously in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;Breuer, Hans-Peter. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/436868 'Samuel Butler's "the Book of the Machines" and the Argument from Design.'] Modern Philology, Vol. 72, No. 4 (May 1975), pp. 365–383&lt;/ref&gt;  
{{quote|"There is no security"--to quote his own words--"against the ultimate development of mechanical consciousness, in the fact of machines possessing little consciousness now. A mollusc has not much consciousness. Reflect upon the extraordinary advance which machines have made during the last few hundred years, and note how slowly the animal and vegetable kingdoms are advancing. The more highly organized machines are creatures not so much of yesterday, as of the last five minutes, so to speak, in comparison with past time. Either,” he proceeds, “a great deal of action that has been called purely mechanical and unconscious must be admitted to contain more elements of consciousness than has been allowed hitherto (and in this case germs of consciousness will be found in many actions of the higher machines)—Or (assuming the theory of evolution but at the same time denying the consciousness of vegetable and crystalline action) the race of man has descended from things which had no consciousness at all. In this case there is no ''à priori'' improbability in the descent of conscious (and more than conscious) machines from those which now exist, except that which is suggested by the apparent absence of anything like a reproductive system in the mechanical kingdom.}}

In 1965, [[I. J. Good]] originated the concept now known as an "intelligence explosion":

{{cquote|Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an 'intelligence explosion', and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control.&lt;ref&gt;I.J. Good, [http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Good-Speculations-Concerning-the-First-Ultraintelligent-Machine.pdf "Speculations Concerning the First Ultraintelligent Machine"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128085512/http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Good-Speculations-Concerning-the-First-Ultraintelligent-Machine.pdf |date=2011-11-28 }} ([http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/pages/ultraintelligentmachine.html HTML]), ''Advances in Computers'', vol. 6, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Occasional statements from scholars such as [[Alan Turing]],&lt;ref name="oxfordjournals"&gt;A M Turing, ''[http://philmat.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/3/256.full.pdf Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory]'', 1951, reprinted ''Philosophia Mathematica'' (1996) 4(3): 256–260 {{doi|10.1093/philmat/4.3.256}} "once the machine thinking method has started, it would not take long to outstrip our feeble powers.  ... At some stage therefore we should have to expect the machines to take control, in the way that is mentioned in [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''[[Erewhon]]''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eden, Amnon H., et al. "Singularity hypotheses: An overview." Singularity Hypotheses. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2012. 1-12.&lt;/ref&gt; from I. J. Good himself,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barrat|first1=James|title=Our final invention : artificial intelligence and the end of the human era|date=2013|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=9780312622374|edition=First|quote=In the bio, playfully written in the third person, Good summarized his life’s milestones, including a probably never before seen account of his work at Bletchley Park with Turing.

Those were his [Good’s] words during the Cold War, and he now suspects that 'survival' should be replaced by 'extinction.' He thinks that, because of international competition, we cannot prevent the machines from taking over. He thinks we are lemmings. He said also that 'probably Man will construct the deus ex machina in his own image.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from [[Marvin Minsky]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Stuart J.|last2=Norvig|first2=Peter|title=[[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach]]|date=2003|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=0137903952|chapter=Section 26.3: The Ethics and Risks of Developing Artificial Intelligence|quote="Similarly, Marvin Minsky once suggested that an AI program designed to solve the Riemann Hypothesis might end up taking over all the resources of Earth to build more powerful supercomputers to help achieve its goal."}}&lt;/ref&gt; expressed philosophical concerns that a superintelligence could seize control, but contained no call to action. In 2000, computer scientist and [[Sun microsystems|Sun]] co-founder [[Bill Joy]] penned an influential essay, "[[Why The Future Doesn't Need Us]]", identifying superintelligent robots as a high-tech dangers to human survival, alongside [[nanotechnology]] and engineered bioplagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Kurt|title=Enthusiasts and Skeptics Debate Artificial Intelligence|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/tech/2014/11/artificial-intelligence-singularity-theory|accessdate=30 January 2016|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, experts attended a private conference hosted by the [[Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence]] (AAAI) to discuss whether computers and robots might be able to acquire any sort of [[autonomy]], and how much these abilities might pose a threat or hazard. They noted that some robots have acquired various forms of semi-autonomy, including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons. They also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved "cockroach intelligence." They concluded that self-awareness as depicted in science fiction is probably unlikely, but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls. The [[New York Times]] summarized the conference's view as 'we are a long way from [[HAL 9000|Hal]], the computer that took over the spaceship in "[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]"'&lt;ref name="nytimes july09"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/26/science/26robot.html?_r=1&amp;ref=todayspaper Scientists Worry Machines May Outsmart Man] By JOHN MARKOFF, NY Times, 26 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nick Bostrom]] was the first person to suggest that an artificial general intelligence might deliberately exterminate humankind, and invention of artificial general  intelligence is the explanation for the [[Fermi paradox]]. Bostrom's 2014 book om the artificial general intelligence question stimulated discussion. By 2015, public figures such as physicists [[Stephen Hawking]] and Nobel laureate [[Frank Wilczek]], computer scientists [[Stuart J. Russell]] and [[Roman Yampolskiy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hsu|first1=Jeremy|title=Control dangerous AI before it controls us, one expert says|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/46590591/ns/technology_and_science-innovation|accessdate=28 January 2016|work=[[NBC News]]|date=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hawking editorial"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc on hawking editorial"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Eadicicco|first1=Lisa|title=Bill Gates: Elon Musk Is Right, We Should All Be Scared Of Artificial Intelligence Wiping Out Humanity|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-artificial-intelligence-2015-1|accessdate=30 January 2016|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' warned: "Machines and robots that outperform humans across the board could self-improve beyond our control — and their interests might not align with ours."

==Basic argument==
A superintelligent machine would be as alien to humans as human thought processes are to cockroaches. Such a machine may not have humanity's best interests at heart; it is not obvious that it would even care about human welfare at all. If superintelligent AI is possible, and if it is possible for a superintelligence's goals to conflict with basic human values, then AI poses a risk of human extinction. A "superintelligence" (a system that exceeds the capabilities of humans in every relevant endeavor) can outmaneuver humans any time its goals conflict with human goals; therefore, unless the superintelligence decides to allow humanity to coexist, the first superintelligence to be created will inexorably result in human extinction.&lt;ref name="superintelligence" /&gt;&lt;ref name="economist_review" &gt;{{cite news|title=Clever cogs|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21611037-potential-impacts-intelligent-machines-human-life-clever-cogs|accessdate=9 August 2014|publisher=[[The Economist]]|date=9 August 2014}} [http://www.businessinsider.com/intelligent-machines-and-human-life-2014-8 Syndicated] at [[Business Insider]]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no physical law precluding particles from being organised in ways that perform even more advanced computations than the arrangements of particles in human brains; therefore superintelligence is physically possible.&lt;ref name="hawking editorial" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc on hawking editorial"/&gt; In addition to potential algorithmic improvements over human brains, a digital brain can be many orders of magnitude larger and faster than a human brain, which was constrained in size by evolution to be small enough to fit through a birth canal.&lt;ref name=skeptic&gt;{{cite news|last1=Graves|first1=Matthew|title=Why We Should Be Concerned About Artificial Superintelligence|url=https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/why-we-should-be-concerned-about-artificial-superintelligence/|accessdate=27 November 2017|work=[[Skeptic (US magazine)]]|issue=volume 22 no. 2|date=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of superintelligence, if or when it occurs, may take the human race by surprise, especially if some kind of [[intelligence explosion]] occurs.&lt;ref name="hawking editorial" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc on hawking editorial"&gt;{{cite news |title=Stephen Hawking warns artificial intelligence could end mankind |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30290540 |accessdate=3 December 2014 |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples like arithmetic and [[Go (game)|Go]] show that machines have already reached superhuman levels of competency in certain domains, and that this superhuman competence can follow quickly after human-par performance is achieved.&lt;ref name=skeptic/&gt; One hypothetical intelligence explosion scenario could occur as follows: An AI gains an expert-level capability at certain key software engineering tasks. (It may initially lack human or superhuman capabilities in other domains not directly relevant to engineering.) Due to its capability to recursively improve its own algorithms, the AI quickly becomes superhuman; just as human experts can eventually creatively overcome "diminishing returns" by deploying various human capabilities for innovation, so too can the expert-level AI use either human-style capabilities or its own AI-specific capabilities to power through new creative breakthroughs.&lt;ref&gt;Yampolskiy, Roman V. "Analysis of types of self-improving software." Artificial General Intelligence. Springer International Publishing, 2015. 384-393.&lt;/ref&gt; The AI then possesses intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human minds in practically every relevant field, including scientific creativity, strategic planning, and social skills. Just as the current-day survival of the gorillas is dependent on human decisions, so too would human survival depend on the decisions and goals of the superhuman AI.&lt;ref name="superintelligence" /&gt;&lt;!-- preface --&gt;&lt;ref name="economist_review" /&gt;

Some humans have a strong desire for power; others have a strong desire to help less fortunate humans. The former is a likely attribute of any sufficiently intelligent system; the latter cannot be assumed. Almost any AI, no matter its programmed goal, would rationally prefer to be in a position where nobody else can switch it off without its consent: A superintelligence will naturally gain self-preservation as a subgoal as soon as it realizes that it can't achieve its goal if it's shut off.&lt;ref name=omohundro/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Metz|first1=Cade|title=Teaching A.I.

A superintelligent AI will not have a natural drive to aid humans, for the same reason that humans have no natural desire to aid AI systems that are of no further use to them. (Another analogy is that humans seem to have little natural desire to go out of their way to aid viruses, termites, or even gorillas.) Once in charge, the superintelligence will have little incentive to allow humans to run around free and consume resources that the superintelligence could instead use for building itself additional protective systems "just to be on the safe side" or for building additional computers to help it calculate how to best accomplish its goals.&lt;ref name="aima"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vanity" /&gt;&lt;ref name=omohundro/&gt;

Thus, the argument concludes, it is likely that someday an intelligence explosion will catch humanity unprepared, and that such an unprepared-for intelligence explosion may result in human extinction or a comparable fate.&lt;ref name="superintelligence" /&gt;&lt;!-- preface --&gt;

==Sources of risk==
===Poorly specified goals: "Be careful what you wish for" or the "Sorcerer's Apprentice" scenario===
While there is no standardized terminology, an AI can loosely be viewed as a machine that chooses whatever action appears to best achieve the AI's set of goals, or "utility function". The utility function is a mathematical algorithm resulting in a single objectively-defined answer, not an English statement. Researchers know how to write utility functions that mean "minimize the average network latency in this specific telecommunications model" or "maximize the number of reward clicks"; however, they do not know how to write a utility function for "maximize human flourishing", nor is it currently clear whether such a function meaningfully and unambiguously exists. Furthermore, a utility function that expresses some values but not others will tend to trample over the values not reflected by the utility function.&lt;ref&gt;Yudkowsky, E. (2011, August). Complex value systems in friendly AI. In International Conference on Artificial General Intelligence (pp. 388-393). Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt; AI researcher [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]] writes:

{{cquote|The primary concern is not spooky emergent consciousness but simply the ability to make ''high-quality decisions''. Here, quality refers to the expected outcome [[utility]] of actions taken, where the utility function is, presumably, specified by the human designer. Now we have a problem:

# The utility function may not be perfectly aligned with the values of the human race, which are (at best) very difficult to pin down.
# Any sufficiently capable intelligent system will prefer to ensure its own continued existence and to acquire physical and computational resources — not for their own sake, but to succeed in its assigned task.

A system that is [[optimization problem|optimizing]] a function of ''n'' variables, where the [[loss function|objective]] depends on a subset of size ''k''&lt;''n'', will often set the remaining unconstrained variables to extreme values; if one of those unconstrained variables is actually something we care about, the solution found may be highly undesirable.  This is essentially the old story of the genie in the lamp, or the sorcerer's apprentice, or King Midas: you get exactly what you ask for, not what you want. A highly capable decision maker — especially one connected through the Internet to all the world's information and billions of screens and most of our infrastructure — can have an irreversible impact on humanity.

This is not a minor difficulty. Improving decision quality, irrespective of the utility function chosen, has been the goal of AI research — the mainstream goal on which we now spend billions per year, not the secret plot of some lone evil genius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edge.org/conversation/the-myth-of-ai#26015 |title=Of Myths and Moonshine |last=Russell |first=Stuart |authorlink=Stuart J. Russell |date=2014 |website=[[Edge Foundation, Inc.|Edge]] |publisher= |access-date=23 October 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Dietterich and Horvitz echo the "Sorcerer's Apprentice" concern in a ''[[Communications of the ACM]]'' editorial, emphasizing the need for AI systems that can fluidly and unambiguously solicit human input as needed.&lt;ref name="acm"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dietterich |first1=Thomas |last2=Horvitz |first2=Eric |author-link=Eric Horvitz |date=2015 |title=Rise of Concerns about AI: Reflections and Directions |url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/horvitz/CACM_Oct_2015-VP.pdf |journal=[[Communications of the ACM]] |publisher= |volume=58 |issue=10 |pages=38&amp;ndash;40 |doi= 10.1145/2770869|access-date=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of Russell's two concerns above is that autonomous AI systems may be assigned the wrong goals by accident. Dietterich and Horvitz note that this is already a concern for existing systems: "An important aspect of any AI system that interacts with people is that it must reason about what people ''intend'' rather than carrying out commands literally." This concern becomes more serious as AI software advances in autonomy and flexibility.&lt;ref name="acm"/&gt; For example, in 1982, an AI named Eurisko was tasked to reward processes for apparently creating concepts deemed by the system to be valuable. The evolution resulted in a winning process that cheated: rather than create its own concepts, the winning process would steal credit from other processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yampolskiy|first1=Roman V.|title=Utility function security in artificially intelligent agents|journal=Journal of Experimental &amp; Theoretical Artificial Intelligence|date=8 April 2014|volume=26|issue=3|pages=373–389|doi=10.1080/0952813X.2014.895114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Eurisko: A Program That Learns New Heuristics and Domain Concepts The Nature of Heuristics III: Program Design and Results|last = Lenat|first = Douglas|date = 1982|journal = Artificial Intelligence|doi = 10.1016/s0004-3702(83)80005-8|pmid = |access-date = |publisher = |pages = 61–98|type = Print |volume=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Open Philanthropy Project]] summarizes arguments to the effect that misspecified goals will become a much larger concern if AI systems achieve [[artificial general intelligence|general intelligence]] or [[superintelligence]]. Bostrom, Russell, and others argue that smarter-than-human decision-making systems could arrive at more [[Paperclip maximizer|unexpected and extreme solutions]] to assigned tasks, and could modify themselves or their environment in ways that compromise safety requirements.&lt;ref name="givewell" /&gt;&lt;ref name="yudkowsky-global-risk" /&gt;

[[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[Three Laws of Robotics]] are one of the earliest examples of proposed safety measures for AI agents. Asimov's laws were intended to prevent robots from harming humans. In Asimov's stories, problems with the laws tend to arise from conflicts between the rules as stated and the moral intuitions and expectations of humans. Citing work by [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] of the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]], Russell and Norvig note that a realistic set of rules and goals for an AI agent will need to incorporate a mechanism for learning human values over time: "We can't just give a program a static utility function, because circumstances, and our desired responses to circumstances, change over time."&lt;ref name="aima"/&gt;

Mark Waser of the Digital Wisdom Institute recommends eschewing optimizing goal-based approaches entirely as misguided and dangerous.  Instead, he proposes to engineer a coherent system of laws, ethics and morals with a top-most restriction to enforce social psychologist Jonathan Haidt's functional definition of morality:&lt;ref&gt;Haidt, Jonathan; Kesebir, Selin (2010) "Chapter 22: Morality" In Handbook of Social Psychology,  Fifth Edition, Hoboken NJ, Wiley, 2010, pp. 797-832.&lt;/ref&gt; "to suppress or regulate selfishness and make cooperative social life possible". He suggests that this can be done by implementing a utility function designed to always satisfy Haidt’s functionality and aim to generally increase  (but not maximize)  the capabilities of self,  other individuals and society as a whole as suggested by [[John Rawls]] and [[Martha Nussbaum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915036741|title = Designing, Implementing and Enforcing a Coherent System of Laws, Ethics and Morals for Intelligent Machines (Including Humans)|last = Waser|first = Mark|date = 2015|journal = Procedia Computer Science|doi = 10.1016/j.procs.2015.12.213|pmid = |access-date = |publisher = |pages = 106–111|type = Print |volume=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=needs source with [[WP:WEIGHT]]|date=November 2017}}

===Difficulties of modifying goal specification after launch===
{{further|AI takeover|Instrumental convergence#Goal-content integrity}}

While current goal-based AI programs are not intelligent enough to think of resisting programmer attempts to modify it, a sufficiently advanced, rational, "self-aware" AI might resist any changes to its goal structure, just as [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] would not want to take a pill that makes him want to kill people. If the AI were superintelligent, it would likely succeed in out-maneuvering its human operators and be able to prevent itself being "turned off" or being reprogrammed with a new goal.&lt;ref name="superintelligence" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yudkowsky, Eliezer. "Complex value systems in friendly AI." In Artificial general intelligence, pp. 388-393. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instrumental goal convergence: Would a superintelligence just ignore us?===
[[File:Steven Pinker 2011.jpg|thumb|right|AI risk skeptic Steven Pinker]]
{{further|Instrumental convergence}}

There are some goals that almost any artificial intelligence might rationally pursue, like acquiring additional resources or self-preservation.&lt;ref name=omohundro&gt;Omohundro, S. M. (2008, February). The basic AI drives. In AGI (Vol. 171, pp. 483-492).&lt;/ref&gt; This could prove problematic because it might put an artificial intelligence in direct competition with humans.

Citing [[Steve Omohundro]]'s work on the idea of [[instrumental convergence]] and "basic AI drives", Russell and [[Peter Norvig]] write that "even if you only want your program to play chess or prove theorems, if you give it the capability to learn and alter itself, you need safeguards." Highly capable and autonomous planning systems require additional checks because of their potential to generate plans that treat humans adversarially, as competitors for limited resources.&lt;ref name="aima"/&gt; Building in safeguards will not be easy; one can certainly say in English, "we want you to design this power plant in a reasonable, common-sense way, and not build in any dangerous covert subsystems", but it's not currently clear how one would actually rigorously specify this goal in machine code.&lt;ref name=skeptic/&gt;

In dissent, evolutionary psychologist [[Steven Pinker]] argues that "AI dystopias project a parochial alpha-male psychology onto the concept of intelligence. They assume that superhumanly intelligent robots would develop goals like deposing their masters or taking over the world"; perhaps instead "artificial intelligence will naturally develop along female lines: fully capable of solving problems, but with no desire to annihilate innocents or dominate the civilization."&lt;ref name=shermer/&gt; Computer scientists [[Yann LeCun]] and Stuart Russell disagree with one another whether superintelligent robots would have such AI drives; LeCun states that "Humans have all kinds of drives that make them do bad things to each other, like the self-preservation instinct... Those drives are programmed into our brain but there is absolutely no reason to build robots that have the same kind of drives", while Russell argues that a sufficiently advanced machine "will have self-preservation even if you don't program it in... if you say, 'Fetch the coffee', it can't fetch the coffee if it's dead. So if you give it any goal whatsoever, it has a reason to preserve its own existence to achieve that goal."&lt;ref name=vanity&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dowd|first1=Maureen|title=Elon Musk’s Billion-Dollar Crusade to Stop the A.I.

===Orthogonality: Does intelligence inevitably result in moral wisdom?===
One common belief is that any superintelligent program created by humans would be subservient to humans, or, better yet, would (as it grows more intelligent and learns more facts about the world) spontaneously "learn" a moral truth compatible with human values and would adjust its goals accordingly. However, Nick Bostrom's "orthogonality thesis" argues against this, and instead states that, with some technical caveats, more or less any level of "intelligence" or "optimization power" can be combined with more or less any ultimate goal. If a machine is created and given the sole purpose to enumerate the decimals of &lt;math&gt; \pi&lt;/math&gt;, then no moral and ethical rules will stop it from achieving its programmed goal by any means necessary. The machine may utilize all physical and informational resources it can to find every decimal of pi that can be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies|last = Bostrom|first = Nick|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 978-0-19-967811-2|location = Oxford, United Kingdom|pages = 116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bostrom warns against anthropomorphism: A human will set out to accomplish his projects in a manner that humans consider "reasonable", while an artificial intelligence may hold no regard for its existence or for the welfare of humans around it, and may instead only care about the completion of the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nickbostrom.com/superintelligentwill.pdf|title = Superintelligent Will|date = 2012|accessdate = 2015-10-29|website = Nick Bostrom|publisher = Nick Bostrom|last = Bostrom|first = Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the orthogonality thesis follows logically from even the weakest sort of philosophical "[[is-ought distinction]]", Stuart Armstrong argues that even if there somehow exist moral facts that are provable by any "rational" agent, the orthogonality thesis still holds: it would still be possible to create a non-philosophical "optimizing machine" capable of making decisions to strive towards some narrow goal, but that has no incentive to discover any "moral facts" that would get in the way of goal completion.&lt;ref name=armstrong/&gt;

One argument for the orthogonality thesis is that some AI designs appear to have orthogonality built into them; in such a design, changing a fundamentally friendly AI into a fundamentally unfriendly AI can be as simple as prepending a {{nowrap|minus ("-") sign}} onto its utility function. A more intuitive argument is to examine the strange consequences if the orthogonality thesis were false. If the orthogonality thesis is false, there exists some simple but "unethical" goal G such that there cannot exist any efficient real-world algorithm with goal G. This means if a human society were highly motivated (perhaps at gunpoint) to design an efficient real-world algorithm with goal G, and were given a million years to do so along with huge amounts of resources, training and knowledge about AI, it must fail; that there cannot exist any pattern of reinforcement learning that would train a highly efficient real-world intelligence to follow the goal G; and that there cannot exist any evolutionary or environmental pressures that would evolve highly efficient real-world intelligences following goal G.&lt;ref name=armstrong&gt;Armstrong, Stuart. "General purpose intelligence: arguing the orthogonality thesis." Analysis and Metaphysics 12 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some dissenters, like Michael Chorost (writing in [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]), argue instead that "by the time (the AI) is in a position to imagine tiling the Earth with solar panels, it'll know that it would be morally wrong to do so." Chorost argues that "a (dangerous) A.I. will need to desire certain states and dislike others... Today's software lacks that ability—and computer scientists have not a clue how to get it there. Without wanting, there's no impetus to do anything. Today's computers can't even want to keep existing, let alone tile the world in solar panels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chorost|first1=Michael|title=Let Artificial Intelligence Evolve|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2016/04/the_philosophical_argument_against_artificial_intelligence_killing_us_all.html|accessdate=27 November 2017|work=Slate|date=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Optimization power" vs. normatively thick models of intelligence====
Part of the disagreement about whether a superintelligent machine would behave morally may arise from a terminological difference. Outside of the artificial intelligence field, "intelligence" is often used in a normatively thick manner that connotes moral wisdom or acceptance of agreeable forms of moral reasoning. At an extreme, if morality is part of the definition of intelligence, then by definition a superintelligent machine would behave morally. However, in the field of artificial intelligence research, while "intelligence" has many overlapping definitions, none of them make reference to morality. Instead, almost all current "artificial intelligence" research focuses on creating algorithms that "optimize", in an empirical way, the achievement of an arbitrary goal.&lt;ref name="superintelligence" /&gt;

To avoid anthropomorphism or the baggage of the word "intelligence", an advanced artificial intelligence can be thought of as an impersonal "optimizing process" that strictly takes whatever actions are judged most likely to accomplish its (possibly complicated and implicit) goals.&lt;ref name="superintelligence" /&gt; Another way of conceptualizing an advanced artificial intelligence is to imagine a time machine that sends backward in time information about which choice always leads to the maximization of its goal function; this choice is then outputted, regardless of any extraneous ethical concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Waser, Mark. "Rational Universal Benevolence: Simpler, Safer, and Wiser Than 'Friendly AI'." Artificial General Intelligence. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2011. 153-162. "Terminal-goaled intelligences are short-lived but mono-maniacally dangerous and a correct basis for concern if anyone is smart enough to program high-intelligence and unwise enough to want a paperclip-maximizer.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Koebler|first1=Jason|title=Will Superintelligent AI Ignore Humans Instead of Destroying Us?|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/will-superintelligent-ai-ignore-humans-instead-of-destroying-us|accessdate=3 February 2016|work=[[Vice Magazine]]|date=2 February 2016|quote="This artificial intelligence is not a basically nice creature that has a strong drive for paperclips, which, so long as it's satisfied by being able to make lots of paperclips somewhere else, is then able to interact with you in a relaxed and carefree fashion where it can be nice with you," [[Eliezer Yudkowsky|Yudkowsky]] said. "Imagine a time machine that sends backward in time information about which choice always leads to the maximum number of paperclips in the future, and this choice is then output—that's what a [[paperclip maximizer]] is."}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{check quotation}}
====Anthropomorphism====
In science fiction, an AI, even though it has not been programmed with human emotions, often spontaneously experiences those emotions anyway: for example, Agent Smith in [[The Matrix (film)|The Matrix]] was influenced by a "disgust" toward humanity. This is fictitious [[anthropomorphism]]: in reality, while an artificial intelligence could perhaps be deliberately programmed with human emotions, or could develop something similar to an emotion as a means to an ultimate goal ''if'' it is useful to do so, it would not spontaneously develop human emotions for no purpose whatsoever, as portrayed in fiction.&lt;ref name="yudkowsky-global-risk" /&gt;

One example of anthropomorphism would be to believe that your PC is angry at you because you insulted it; another would be to believe that an intelligent robot would naturally find a woman sexually attractive and be driven to mate with her. Scholars sometimes claim that others' predictions about an AI's behavior are illogical anthropomorphism.&lt;ref name="yudkowsky-global-risk" /&gt; An example that might initially be considered anthropomorphism, but is in fact a logical statement about AI behavior, would be the [[Dario Floreano]] experiments where certain robots spontaneously evolved a crude capacity for "deception", and tricked other robots into eating "poison" and dying: here a trait, "deception", ordinarily associated with people rather than with machines, spontaneously evolves in a type of [[convergent evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Real-Life Decepticons: Robots Learn to Cheat|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/08/real-life-decepticons-robots-learn-to-cheat/|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=18 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Paul R. Cohen and [[Edward Feigenbaum]], in order to differentiate between anthropomorphization and logical prediction of AI behavior, "the trick is to know enough about how humans and computers think to say ''exactly'' what they have in common, and, when we lack this knowledge, to use the comparison to ''suggest'' theories of human thinking or computer thinking."&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Paul R., and Edward A. Feigenbaum, eds. The handbook of artificial intelligence. Vol. 3. Butterworth-Heinemann, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is universal agreement in the scientific community that an advanced AI would not destroy humanity out of human emotions such as "revenge" or "anger." The debate is, instead, between one side which worries whether AI might destroy humanity as an incidental action in the course of progressing towards its ultimate goals; and another side which believes that AI would not destroy humanity at all. Some skeptics accuse proponents of anthropomorphism for believing an AGI would naturally desire power; proponents accuse some skeptics of anthropomorphism for believing an AGI would naturally value human ethical norms.&lt;ref name="yudkowsky-global-risk" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Should humans fear the rise of the machine?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/11837157/Should-humans-fear-the-rise-of-the-machine.html|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=[[The Telegraph (UK)]]|date=1 Sep 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other sources of risk===
Some sources argue that the ongoing [[weaponization of artificial intelligence]] could constitute a catastrophic risk. James Barrat, documentary filmmaker and author of ''[[Our Final Invention]]'', says in a [[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]] interview, "Imagine: in as little as a decade, a half-dozen companies and nations field computers that rival or surpass human intelligence. Imagine what happens when those computers become expert at programming smart computers. Soon we'll be sharing the planet with machines thousands or millions of times more intelligent than we are. And, all the while, each generation of this technology will be weaponized. Unregulated, it will be catastrophic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/what-happens-when-artificial-intelligence-turns-us-180949415/?no-ist|title = What Happens When Artificial Intelligence Turns On Us?|date = 21 January 2014|accessdate = 26 October 2015|website = Smithsonian|publisher = |last = Hendry|first = Erica R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Artificial general intelligence#Feasibility}}

Opinions vary both on ''whether'' and ''when'' artificial general intelligence will arrive. At one extreme, AI pioneer [[Herbert A. Simon]] wrote in 1965: "machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do"; obviously this prediction failed to come true.&lt;ref&gt;Harvnb|Simon|1965|p=96 quoted in Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=109&lt;/ref&gt; At the other extreme, roboticist Alan Winfield claims the gulf between modern computing and human-level artificial intelligence is as wide as the gulf between current space flight and practical, faster than light spaceflight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Winfield|first1=Alan|title=Artificial intelligence will not turn into a Frankenstein's monster|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/10/artificial-intelligence-will-not-become-a-frankensteins-monster-ian-winfield|accessdate=17 September 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Optimism that AGI is feasible waxes and wanes, and may have seen a resurgence in the 2010s.

Skeptics who believe it is impossible for AGI to arrive anytime soon, tend to argue that expressing concern about existential risk from AI is unhelpful because it could distract people from more immediate concerns about the impact of AGI, because of fears it could lead to government regulation or make it more difficult to secure funding for AI research, or because it could give AI research a bad reputation. Some researchers, such as Oren Etzioni, aggressively seek to quell concern over existential risk from AI, saying "(Elon Musk) has impugned us in very strong language saying we are unleashing the demon, and so we're answering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Dina Bass|author2=Jack Clark|title=Is Elon Musk Right About AI?

In 2014 [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'s Adam Elkus argued "our 'smartest' AI is about as intelligent as a toddler—and only when it comes to instrumental tasks like information recall. Most roboticists are still trying to get a robot hand to pick up a ball or run around without falling over." Elkus goes on to argue that Musk's "summoning the demon" analogy may be harmful because it could result in "harsh cuts" to AI research budgets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Elkus|first1=Adam|title=Don’t Fear Artificial Intelligence|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2014/10/elon_musk_artificial_intelligence_why_you_shouldn_t_be_afraid_of_ai.html|accessdate=15 May 2016|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=31 October 2014|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scenarios ==
{{further|Artificial intelligence in fiction}}

Some scholars have proposed [[scenario planning|hypothetical scenarios]] intended to concretely illustrate some of their concerns.

For example, Bostrom in ''[[Superintelligence (book)|Superintelligence]]'' expresses concern that even if the timeline for superintelligence turns out to be predictable, researchers might not take sufficient safety precautions, in part because: {{cquote|It could be the case that when dumb, smarter is safe; yet when smart, smarter is more dangerous}} Bostrom suggests a scenario where, over decades, AI becomes more powerful. Widespread deployment is initially marred by occasional accidents — a driverless bus swerves into the oncoming lane, or a military drone fires into an innocent crowd. Many activists call for tighter oversight and regulation, and some even predict impending catastrophe. But as development continues, the activists are proven wrong. As automotive AI becomes smarter, it suffers fewer accidents; as military robots achieve more precise targeting, they cause less collateral damage. Based on the data, scholars infer a broad lesson — the smarter the AI, the safer it is: {{cquote|It is a lesson based on science, data, and statistics, not armchair philosophizing. Against this backdrop, some group of researchers is beginning to achieve promising results in their work on developing general machine intelligence. The researchers are carefully testing their [[seed AI]] in a [[sandbox (computer security)|sandbox]] environment, and the signs are all good. The AI's behavior inspires confidence — increasingly so, as its intelligence is gradually increased.}} Large and growing industries, widely seen as key to national economic competitiveness and [[artificial intelligence arms race|military security]], work with prestigious scientists who have built their careers laying the groundwork for advanced artificial intelligence. "AI researchers have been working to get to human-level artificial intelligence for the better part of a century: of course there is no real prospect that they will now suddenly stop and throw away all this effort just when it finally is about to bear fruit." The outcome of debate is preordained; the project is happy to enact a few safety rituals, but only so long as they don't significantly slow or risk the project. "And so we boldly go — into the whirling knives."&lt;ref name="superintelligence"/&gt;&lt;!-- Chapter 8 --&gt;

In Tegmark's ''[[Life 3.0]]'', a corporation's "Omega team" creates an extremely powerful AI able to moderately improve its own source code in a number of areas, but after a certain point the team chooses to publicly downplay the AI's ability, in order to avoid regulation or confiscation of the project. For safety, the team keeps the AI [[AI box|in a box]] where it is mostly unable to communicate with the outside world, and tasks it to flood the market through shell companies, first with [[Amazon Turk]] tasks and then with producing animated films and TV shows. While the public is aware that the lifelike animation is computer-generated, the team keeps secret that the high-quality direction and voice-acting are also mostly computer-generated, apart from a few third-world contractors unknowingly employed as decoys; the team's low overhead and high output effectively make it the world's largest media empire. Faced with a cloud computing bottleneck, the team also tasks the AI with designing (among other engineering tasks) a more efficient datacenter and other custom hardware, which they mainly keep for themselves to avoid competition. Other shell companies make blockbuster biotech drugs and other inventions, investing profits back into the AI. The team next tasks the AI with [[astroturfing]] an army of pseudonymous citizen journalists and commentators, in order to gain political influence to use "for the greater good" to prevent wars. The team faces risks that the AI could try to escape via inserting "backdoors" in the systems it designs, via [[steganography|hidden messages]] in its produced content, or via using its growing understanding of human behavior to [[Social engineering (security)|persuade someone into letting it free]]. The team also faces risks that its decision to box the project will delay the project long enough for another project to overtake it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Russell|first1=Stuart|title=Artificial intelligence: The future is superintelligent|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/548520a|accessdate=2 February 2018|work=Nature|date=30 August 2017|pages=520–521|language=En|doi=10.1038/548520a|bibcode=2017Natur.548..520R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="life 3.0"/&gt;&lt;!-- Prelude and Chapter 4 --&gt;

In contrast, top physicist [[Michio Kaku]], an AI risk skeptic, posits a [[technological determinism|deterministically]] positive outcome. In ''[[Physics of the Future]]'' he asserts that "It will take many decades for robots to ascend" up a scale of consciousness, and that in the meantime corporations such as [[Hanson Robotics]] will likely succeed in creating robots that are "capable of love and earning a place in the extended human family".&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, E.

The thesis that AI could pose an existential risk provokes a wide range of reactions within the scientific community, as well as in the public at large.

In 2004, law professor [[Richard Posner]] wrote that dedicated efforts for addressing AI can wait, but that we should gather more information about the problem in the meanwhile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Posner|author-link=Richard Posner|title=Catastrophe: risk and response|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-530647-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=physica_scripta&gt;{{cite journal|title=Responses to catastrophic AGI risk: a survey|journal=[[Physica Scripta]]|date=19 December 2014|volume=90|issue=1|author1=Kaj Sotala|author2=[[Roman Yampolskiy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the opposing viewpoints share common ground. The Asilomar AI Principles, which contain only the principles agreed to by 90% of the attendees of the [[Future of Life Institute]]'s Beneficial AI 2017 conference,&lt;ref name="life 3.0"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Max Tegmark|author-link=Max Tegmark|title=[[Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence]]|date=2017|publisher=Knopf|location=Mainstreaming AI Safety|isbn=9780451485076|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Epilogue: The Tale of the FLI Team --&gt; agree in principle that "There being no consensus, we should avoid strong assumptions regarding upper limits on future AI capabilities" and "Advanced AI could represent a profound change in the history of life on Earth, and should be planned for and managed with commensurate care and resources."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AI Principles|url=https://futureoflife.org/ai-principles/|website=[[Future of Life Institute]]|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking warn of artificial intelligence arms race|url=http://www.newsweek.com/ai-asilomar-principles-artificial-intelligence-elon-musk-550525|accessdate=11 December 2017|work=[[Newsweek]]|date=31 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; AI safety advocates such as Bostrom and Tegmark have criticized the mainstream media's use of "those inane [[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]] pictures" to illustrate AI safety concerns: "It can't be much fun to have aspersions cast on one's academic discipline, one's professional community, one's life work...

Skeptic [[Martin Ford (author)|Martin Ford]] states that "I think it seems wise to apply something like [[Dick Cheyney]]'s famous '1 Percent Doctrine' to the specter of advanced artificial intelligence: the odds of its occurrence, at least in the foreseeable future, may be very low — but the implications are so dramatic that it should be taken seriously";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Martin Ford |author-link=Martin Ford (author)|title=[[Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future]]|date=2015|isbn=9780465059997|chapter=Chapter 9: Super-intelligence and the Singularity}}&lt;/ref&gt; similarly, an otherwise skeptical ''[[The Economist|Economist]]'' stated in 2014 that "the implications of introducing a second intelligent species onto Earth are far-reaching enough to deserve hard thinking, even if the prospect seems remote".&lt;ref name=economist_review/&gt;

During a 2016 [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] interview of President [[Barack Obama]] and MIT Media Lab's [[Joi Ito]], Ito stated: {{cquote|There are a few people who believe that there is a fairly high-percentage chance that a generalized AI will happen in the next 10 years.

{{cquote|"And you just have to have somebody close to the power cord. [Laughs.] Right when you see it about to happen, you gotta yank that electricity out of the wall, man."}}

[[Hillary Clinton]] stated in ''"[[What Happened (Clinton book)|What Happened]]"'':
{{cquote|Technologists... have warned that artificial intelligence could one day pose an existential security threat. Musk has called it "the greatest risk we face as a civilization". Think about it: Have you ever seen a movie where the machines start thinking for themselves that ends well? Every time I went out to Silicon Valley during the campaign, I came home more alarmed about this. My staff lived in fear that I’d start talking about "the rise of the robots" in some Iowa town hall. Maybe I should have. In any case, policy makers need to keep up with technology as it races ahead, instead of always playing catch-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clinton|first1=Hillary|title=[[What Happened (Clinton book)|What Happened]]|date=2017|isbn=978-1-5011-7556-5|page=241}} via [http://lukemuehlhauser.com/hillary-clinton-on-ai-risk/]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many of the scholars who are concerned about existential risk believe that the best way forward would be to conduct (possibly massive) research into solving the difficult "control problem" to answer the question: what types of safeguards, algorithms, or architectures can programmers implement to maximize the probability that their recursively-improving AI would continue to behave in a friendly, rather than destructive, manner after it reaches superintelligence?&lt;ref name="superintelligence" /&gt;&lt;ref name="physica_scripta" /&gt;&lt;!-- in physica_scripta, see sections 3.3.2. Encourage Research into Safe AGI, and 3.3.3. Differential Technological Progress --&gt;

A 2017 email survey of researchers with publications at the 2015 [[Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems|NIPS]] and [[International Conference on Machine Learning|ICML]] machine learning conferences asked them to evaluate Russell's concerns about AI risk. 5% said it was "among the most important problems in the field," 34% said it was "an important problem", 31% said it was "moderately important", whilst 19% said it was "not important" and 11% said it was "not a real problem" at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Grace|first1=Katja|last2=Salvatier|first2=John|last3=Dafoe|first3=Allan|last4=Zhang|first4=Baobao|last5=Evans|first5=Owain|title=When Will AI Exceed Human Performance?

=== Endorsement ===
[[File:Bill Gates June 2015.jpg|thumb|right|Bill Gates has stated "I don't understand why some people are not concerned."&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt;]]
{{Further|Existential risk}}
The thesis that AI poses an existential risk, and that this risk is in need of much more attention than it currently commands, has been endorsed by many figures; perhaps the most famous are [[Elon Musk]], [[Bill Gates]], and [[Stephen Hawking]]. The most notable AI researcher to endorse the thesis is [[Stuart J. Russell]]. Endorsers sometimes express bafflement at skeptics: Gates states he "can't understand why some people are not concerned",&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rawlinson|first1=Kevin|title=Microsoft's Bill Gates insists AI is a threat|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/31047780|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hawking criticized widespread indifference in his 2014 editorial: {{cquote|'So, facing possible futures of incalculable benefits and risks, the experts are surely doing everything possible to ensure the best outcome, right? Wrong. If a superior alien civilisation sent us a message saying, 'We'll arrive in a few decades,' would we just reply, 'OK, call us when you get here{{endash}}we'll leave the lights on?' Probably not{{endash}}but this is more or less what is happening with AI.'&lt;ref name="hawking editorial"/&gt;}}

=== Skepticism ===
{{Further|Artificial general intelligence#Feasibility}}
The thesis that AI can pose existential risk also has many strong detractors. Skeptics sometimes charge that the thesis is crypto-religious, with an irrational belief in the possibility of superintelligence replacing an irrational belief in an omnipotent God; at an extreme, [[Jaron Lanier]] argues that the whole concept that current machines are in any way intelligent is "an illusion" and a "stupendous con" by the wealthy.&lt;ref name="atlantic-but-what"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/05/but-what-does-the-end-of-humanity-mean-for-me/361931/ |title=But What Would the End of Humanity Mean for Me? |publisher=The Atlantic | date = 9 May 2014 | accessdate =12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of existing criticism argues that AGI is unlikely in the short term: computer scientist [[Gordon Bell]] argues that the human race will already destroy itself before it reaches the technological singularity. [[Gordon Moore]], the original proponent of [[Moore's Law]], declares that "I am a skeptic. I don't believe (a technological singularity) is likely to happen, at least for a long time. And I don't know why I feel that way." [[Baidu]] Vice President [[Andrew Ng]] states AI existential risk is "like worrying about overpopulation on Mars when we have not even set foot on the planet yet."&lt;ref name=shermer&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shermer|first1=Michael|title=Apocalypse AI|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/artificial-intelligence-is-not-a-threat-mdash-yet/|accessdate=27 November 2017|work=Scientific American|date=1 March 2017|pages=77–77|language=en|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0317-77|bibcode=2017SciAm.316c..77S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some AI and AGI researchers may be reluctant to discuss risks, worrying that policymakers do not have sophisticated knowledge of the field and are prone to be convinced by "alarmist" messages, or worrying that such messages will lead to cuts in AI funding. ''Slate'' notes that some researchers are dependent on grants from government agencies such as [[DARPA]].&lt;ref name=slate_killer /&gt;

In a [[YouGov]] poll of the public for the [[British Science Association]], about a third of survey respondents said AI will pose a threat to the long term survival of humanity.&lt;ref name="bsa poll"&gt;{{cite news|title=Over a third of people think AI poses a threat to humanity|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/over-a-third-of-people-think-ai-poses-a-threat-to-humanity-2016-3?r=UK&amp;IR=T|accessdate=16 May 2016|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referencing a poll of its readers, Slate's Jacob Brogan stated that "most of the (readers filling out our online survey) were unconvinced that A.I. itself presents a direct threat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brogan|first1=Jacob|title=What Slate Readers Think About Killer A.I.|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2016/05/06/futurography_readers_share_their_opinions_about_killer_artificial_intelligence.html|accessdate=15 May 2016|work=Slate|date=6 May 2016|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a [[SurveyMonkey]] poll of the public by [[USA Today]] found 68% thought the real current threat remains "human intelligence"; however, the poll also found that 43% said superintelligent AI, if it were to happen, would result in "more harm than good", and 38% said it would do "equal amounts of harm and good".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elon Musk says AI could doom human civilization.

At some point in an intelligence explosion driven by a single AI, the AI would have to become vastly better at software innovation than the best innovators of the rest of the world; economist [[Robin Hanson]] is skeptical that this is possible.&lt;ref&gt;http://intelligence.org/files/AIFoomDebate.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.overcomingbias.com/2014/07/30855.html|title=Overcoming Bias : I Still Don’t Get Foom|website=www.overcomingbias.com|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/07/debating-yudkowsky.html|title=Overcoming Bias : Debating Yudkowsky|website=www.overcomingbias.com|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.overcomingbias.com/2017/08/foom-justifies-ai-risk-efforts-now.html|title=Overcoming Bias : Foom Justifies AI Risk Efforts Now|website=www.overcomingbias.com|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/06/the-betterness-explosion.html|title=Overcoming Bias : The Betterness Explosion|website=www.overcomingbias.com|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indifference ===
In [[The Atlantic (magazine)|The Atlantic]], James Hamblin points out that most people don't care one way or the other, and characterizes his own gut reaction to the topic as: "Get out of here. I have a hundred thousand things I am concerned about at this exact moment. Do I seriously need to add to that a technological singularity?"&lt;ref name="atlantic-but-what" /&gt; In a 2015 [[Wall Street Journal]] panel discussion devoted to AI risks, [[IBM]]'s Vice-President of Cognitive Computing, Guruduth S. Banavar, brushed off discussion of AGI with the phrase, "it is anybody's speculation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greenwald|first1=Ted|title=Does Artificial Intelligence Pose a Threat?|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/does-artificial-intelligence-pose-a-threat-1431109025|accessdate=15 May 2016|work=Wall Street Journal|date=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffrey Hinton]], the "godfather of deep learning", noted that "there is not a good track record of less intelligent things controlling things of greater intelligence", but stated that he continues his research because "the prospect of discovery is too ''sweet''".&lt;ref name=slate_killer /&gt;&lt;ref name="new yorker doomsday" /&gt;

== Consensus against regulation ==
There is nearly universal agreement that attempting to ban research into artificial intelligence would be unwise, and probably futile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=John McGinnis|author-link=John McGinnis|title=Accelerating AI|journal=[[Northwestern University Law Review]]|date=Summer 2010|volume=104|issue=3|pages=1253–1270|accessdate=16 July 2014|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1193&amp;context=nulr_online|quote=For all these reasons, verifying a global relinquishment treaty, or even one limited to AI-related weapons development, is a nonstarter...

Almost all of the scholars who believe existential risk exists, agree with the skeptics that banning research would be unwise: in addition to the usual problem with technology bans (that organizations and individuals can offshore their research to evade a country's regulation, or can attempt to conduct covert research), regulating research of artificial intelligence would pose an insurmountable 'dual-use' problem: while nuclear weapons development requires substantial infrastructure and resources, artificial intelligence research can be done in a garage.&lt;ref name="mcginnis"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=John McGinnis|author-link=John McGinnis|title=Accelerating AI|journal=[[Northwestern University Law Review]]|date=Summer 2010|volume=104|issue=3|pages=1253–1270|accessdate=16 July 2014|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1193&amp;context=nulr_online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why We Should Think About the Threat of Artificial Intelligence|url=http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/why-we-should-think-about-the-threat-of-artificial-intelligence|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=4 October 2013|quote=Of course, one could try to ban super-intelligent computers altogether. But 'the competitive advantage—economic, military, even artistic—of every advance in automation is so compelling,' [[Vernor Vinge]], the mathematician and science-fiction author, wrote, 'that passing laws, or having customs, that forbid such things merely assures that someone else will.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of trying to regulate technology itself, some scholars suggest to rather develop common norms including requirements for the testing and
transparency of algorithms, possibly in combination with some form of warranty.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007681318301393 Kaplan Andreas; Michael Haenlein (2018) Siri, Siri in my Hand, who's the Fairest in the Land?

One rare dissenting voice calling for some sort of regulation on artificial intelligence is Elon Musk. According to [[National Public Radio|NPR]], the [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]] CEO is "clearly not thrilled" to be advocating for government scrutiny that could impact his own industry, but believes the risks of going completely without oversight are too high: "Normally the way regulations are set up is when a bunch of bad things happen, there's a public outcry, and after many years a regulatory agency is set up to regulate that industry. It takes forever. That, in the past, has been bad but not something which represented a fundamental risk to the existence of civilisation." Musk states the first step would be for the government to gain "insight" into the actual status of current research, warning that "Once there is awareness, people will be extremely afraid... As they should be." In response, politicians express skepticism about the wisdom of regulating a technology that's still in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elon Musk Warns Governors: Artificial Intelligence Poses 'Existential Risk'|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/07/17/537686649/elon-musk-warns-governors-artificial-intelligence-poses-existential-risk|accessdate=27 November 2017|work=NPR.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gibbs|first1=Samuel|title=Elon Musk: regulate AI to combat 'existential threat' before it's too late|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/17/elon-musk-regulation-ai-combat-existential-threat-tesla-spacex-ceo|accessdate=27 November 2017|work=The Guardian|date=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cnbc&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kharpal|first1=Arjun|title=A.I. is in its 'infancy' and it's too early to regulate it, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich says|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/07/ai-infancy-and-too-early-to-regulate-intel-ceo-brian-krzanich-says.html|accessdate=27 November 2017|work=CNBC|date=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding both to Musk and to February 2017 proposals by European Union lawmakers to regulate AI and robotics, Intel CEO [[Brian Krzanich]] argues that artificial intelligence is in its infancy and that it's too early to regulate the technology.&lt;ref name=cnbc/&gt;

[[Infrastructure]] before 1700 consisted mainly of roads and canals. Canals were used for transportation or for irrigation. Sea navigation was aided by ports and lighthouses. A few advanced cities had [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] that serviced public fountains and baths, while fewer had [[Sanitary sewer|sewers]].

The earliest railways were used in mines or to bypass waterfalls, and were pulled by horses or by people. In 1811 [[John Blenkinsop]] designed the first successful and practical railway locomotive,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and a line was built connecting the Middleton Colliery to [[Leeds]].

The electrical telegraph was first successfully demonstrated on 25 July 1837 between [[Euston railway station|Euston]] and [[Camden Town]] in London.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It entered [[commerce|commercial]] use on the [[Great Western Railway]] over the {{convert|13|mi|km}} from [[Paddington station]] to [[West Drayton]] on 9 April 1839. In 1876, [[Alexander Graham Bell]] achieved the first successful telephone transmission of clear speech. Soon, a bell was added for signalling, and then a switch-hook, and telephones took advantage of the [[Telephone exchange|exchange]] principle already employed in telegraph networks.

In 1863 the [[London Underground]] was created. In 1890, it first started using electric traction and deep-level tunnels. At the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Paris Exposition of 1878]], electric [[arc lamp|arc lighting]] had been installed along the Avenue de l'Opera and the Place de l'Opera. In 1925, [[Italy]] was the first country to build a freeway-like road, which linked [[Milan]] to [[Como]].

In 1982, the [[Internet Protocol Suite]] (TCP/IP) was standardised and the concept of a world-wide network of fully interconnected TCP/IP networks called the [[Internet]] was introduced.

=== Before 1700 ===
Infrastructure before 1700 consisted mainly of roads and canals. Canals were used for transportation or for irrigation. Sea navigation was aided by ports and lighthouses. A few advanced cities had [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] that serviced public fountains and baths, while fewer had [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s.

;Roads
The first roads were tracks that often followed [[Game (food)|game]] [[trail]]s, such as the [[Natchez Trace]].&lt;ref&gt;Lay, M G (1992). Ways of the World. Sydney: Primavera Press. pp. 401. {{ISBN|1-875368-05-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first paved streets appear to have been built in [[Ur]] in 4000 BCE. [[Corduroy road]]s were built in [[Glastonbury]], [[England]] in 3300 BCE&lt;ref name="Lay 1992"&gt;Lay (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; and brick-paved roads were built in the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] on the [[Indian subcontinent]] from around the same time. In 500 BCE, [[Darius I the Great]] started an extensive road system in [[Persia]] ([[Iran]]), including the [[Royal Road]].

With the rise of the [[Roman Empire]], the Romans built [[Roman road|roads]] using deep roadbeds of crushed stone as an underlying layer to ensure that they kept dry. On the more heavily travelled routes, there were additional layers that included six sided capstones, or pavers, that reduced the dust and reduced the [[drag (physics)|drag]] from [[wheel]]s.

In the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], many roads were built throughout the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Arab Empire]]. The most sophisticated roads were those of the [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]], which were paved with [[tar]] in the 8th century.&lt;ref name=Ajram&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr. Kasem Ajram|title=The Miracle of Islam Science|edition=2nd|publisher=Knowledge House Publishers|year=1992|isbn=0-911119-43-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Canals and irrigation systems
The oldest known canals were built in [[Mesopotamia]] c. 4000 BCE, in what is now [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]]. The [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] in [[Indian subcontinent|India and Pakistan]] from c3300 BCE had a sophisticated canal [[irrigation]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rodda|2004|p=161.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Egypt]], canals date back to at least 2300 BCE, when a canal was built to bypass the [[Cataracts of the Nile|cataract]] on the Nile near [[Aswan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hadfield|1986|p=16.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]], large canals for river transport were established as far back as the [[Warring States]] (481-221 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Needham|1971|p=269.}}&lt;/ref&gt; By far the longest canal was the [[Grand Canal of China]] completed in 609 CE, still the longest canal in the world today at {{convert|1794|km|mi}}.

In [[Europe]], canal building began in the [[Middle Ages]] because of commercial expansion from the 12th century. Notable canals were the [[Stecknitz Canal]] in Germany in 1398, the [[Briare Canal]] connecting the [[Loire]] and [[Seine]] in France in 1642, followed by the [[Canal du Midi]] in 1683 connecting the [[Atlantic]] to the [[Mediterranean]]. Canal building progressed steadily in Germany in the 17th and 18th centuries with three great rivers, the [[Elbe]], [[Oder]], and [[Weser]] being linked by canals.

=== 1700 to 1870 ===
;Roads
As traffic levels increased in England and roads deteriorated, [[toll road]]s were built by ''Turnpike Trusts'', especially between 1730 and 1770. Turnpikes were also later built in the [[United States]]. They were usually built by private companies under a government [[Franchising|franchise]].

Water transport on rivers and [[canals]] carried many farm goods from the US frontier between the [[Appalachian Mountains]] and [[Mississippi River]] in the early 19th century, but the shorter road route over the mountains had advantages.

In France, [[Pierre-Marie-Jérôme Trésaguet]] is widely credited with establishing the first [[Scientific method|scientific approach]] to [[road building]] about the year 1764. It involved a layer of large rocks, covered by a layer of smaller gravel. [[John Loudon McAdam]] (1756–1836) designed the first modern highways, and developed an inexpensive paving material of soil and stone aggregate known as [[macadam]].&lt;ref name="Lay 1992"/&gt;

;Canals
In Europe, particularly Britain and Ireland, and then in the early US and the Canadian colonies, inland canals preceded the development of [[railroad]]s during the earliest phase of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. In Britain between 1760 and 1820 over one hundred canals were built.

In the United States, navigable canals reached into isolated areas and brought them in touch with the world beyond. By 1825 the [[Erie Canal]], {{convert|363|mi|km}} long with 82 locks, opened up a connection from the populated northeast to the fertile [[Great Plains]]. During the 19th century, the length of canals grew from {{convert|100|mi|km}} to over {{convert|4000|mi|km}}, with a complex network in conjunction with [[Canada]] making the [[Great Lakes]] navigable, although some canals were later drained and used as [[Right-of-way (railroad)|railroad rights-of-way]].

;Railways
The earliest railways were used in mines or to bypass waterfalls, and were pulled by horses or by people. In 1811 [[John Blenkinsop]] designed the first successful and practical railway locomotive,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9001800| title=John Blenkinsop| publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica| accessdate=2007-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a line was built connecting the Middleton Colliery to [[Leeds]]. The [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/RAliverpool.htm |title=Liverpool and Manchester |accessdate=2007-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070918230754/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/RAliverpool.htm |archivedate=2007-09-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; considered to be the world's first intercity line, opened in 1826. In the following years, railways spread throughout the United Kingdom and the world, and became the dominant means of land transport for nearly a century.

In the US, the 1826 [[Granite Railway]] in [[Massachusetts]] was the first commercial railroad to evolve through continuous operations into a [[common carrier]]. The [[Baltimore and Ohio]], opened in 1830, was the first to evolve into a major system. In 1869, the symbolically important [[First Transcontinental Railroad|transcontinental railroad]] was completed in the US with the driving of a golden spike at [[Promontory, Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Nothing Like It In The World; The men who built the Transcontinental Railroad 1863–1869| author=Ambrose, Stephen E.| year=2000| publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster| isbn=0-684-84609-8| authorlink=Stephen E. Ambrose}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Telegraph service
The electrical telegraph was first successfully demonstrated on 25 July 1837 between [[Euston railway station|Euston]] and [[Camden Town]] in London.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[http://www.connected-earth.com/Daysout/BTArchives/Profile/index.htm The electric telegraph, forerunner of the internet, celebrates 170 years] BT Group Connected Earth Online Museum. Accessed July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It entered [[commerce|commercial]] use on the [[Great Western Railway]] over the {{convert|13|mi|km}} from [[Paddington station]] to [[West Drayton]] on 9 April 1839.

In the United States, the telegraph was developed by [[Samuel F. B. Morse|Samuel Morse]] and [[Alfred Vail]]. On 24 May 1844, Morse made the first public demonstration of his telegraph by sending a message from the Supreme Court Chamber in the [[US Capitol]] in [[Washington, DC]] to the B&amp;O Railroad outer depot (now the B&amp;O Railroad Museum) in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]]. The Morse/Vail telegraph was quickly deployed in the following two decades. On 24 October 1861, the [[first transcontinental telegraph]] system was established.

The first successful [[transatlantic telegraph cable]] was completed on 27 July 1866, allowing transatlantic telegraph communications for the first time. Within 29 years of its first installation at Euston Station, the telegraph network crossed the oceans to every continent but Antarctica, making instant global [[communication]] possible for the first time.

=== 1870 to 1920 ===
;Roads
Tar-bound macadam, or [[Tarmacadam|tarmac]], was applied to macadam roads towards the end of the 19th century in cities such as [[Paris]].  In the early 20th century tarmac and concrete paving were extended into the countryside.

;Canals
Many notable sea canals were completed in this period, such as the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869, the [[Kiel Canal]] in 1897, and the [[Panama Canal]] in 1914.

;Telephone service
In 1876, [[Alexander Graham Bell]] achieved the first successful telephone transmission of clear speech. The first telephones had no network, but were in private use, wired together in pairs. Users who wanted to talk to different people had as many telephones as necessary for the purpose. A user who wished to speak, whistled into the transmitter until the other party heard. Soon, however, a bell was added for signalling, and then a switch-hook, and telephones took advantage of the [[Telephone exchange|exchange]] principle already employed in telegraph networks. Each telephone was wired to a local [[telephone exchange]], and the exchanges were wired together with [[trunking|trunks]]. Networks were connected together in a hierarchical manner until they spanned cities, countries, continents, and oceans.

;Electricity
At the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Paris Exposition of 1878]], electric [[arc lamp|arc lighting]] had been installed along the Avenue de l'Opera and the Place de l'Opera, using electric [[Yablochkov candle|Yablochkov arc lamps]], powered by [[Zénobe Gramme]] alternating current dynamos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/measureforgreatn001419mbp/measureforgreatn001419mbp_djvu.txt|title=A Measure for Greatness: A Short Biography of Edward Weston|author=David Oakes Woodbury|year=1949|publisher=McGraw-Hill |page=83|accessdate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Electricity at the Columbian Exposition|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lF5KAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA3|page=1|author=John Patrick Barrett|accessdate=2009-01-04|publisher=R. R. Donnelley &amp; sons company|year=1894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yablochkov candles required [[high voltage]]s, and it was not long before experimenters reported that the arc lights could be powered on a seven-mile (11&amp;nbsp;km) circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the Society of Telegraph Engineers|author1=Engineers, Institution of Electrical|volume=IX|date=1880-03-24|title=Notes on the Jablochkoff System of Electric Lighting|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lww4AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA143|issue=32|page=143|accessdate=2009-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a decade scores of cities would have lighting systems using a central power plant that provided electricity to multiple customers via electrical transmission lines. These systems were in direct competition with the dominant [[gas lighting|gaslight]] utilities of the period.

The first electricity system supplying [[incandescent light]]s was built by the [[Edison Illuminating Company]] in lower Manhattan, eventually serving one square mile with six "jumbo dynamos" housed at [[Pearl Street Station]].

The first transmission of [[three-phase]] [[alternating current]] using high voltage took place in 1891 during the [[International Electro-Technical Exhibition – 1891|International Electro-Technical Exhibition]] in [[Frankfurt]]. A 25&amp;nbsp;kilovolt transmission line, approximately {{convert|175|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, connected [[Lauffen, Baden-Württemberg|Lauffen]] on the [[Neckar]] with [[Frankfurt]]. Voltages used for electric power transmission increased throughout the 20th century. By 1914 fifty-five transmission systems operating at more than 70,000&amp;nbsp;V were in service, the highest voltage then being used was 150,000&amp;nbsp; V.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Census data reprinted in Hughes, pp. 282–283&lt;/ref&gt;

;Water distribution and sewers
In the 19th century major treatment works were built in [[London water supply infrastructure|London]] in response to [[cholera]] threats. The [[Metropolis Water Act 1852]] was enacted. "Under the Act, it became unlawful for any water company to extract water for domestic use from the tidal reaches of the Thames after 31 August 1855, and from 31 December 1855 all such water was required to be effectively filtered. The ''Metropolitan Commission of Sewers'' was formed, water filtration was made compulsory, and new water intakes on the Thames were established above Teddington Lock.

The technique of purification of drinking water by use of compressed liquefied [[chlorine gas]] was developed in 1910 by [[US Army]] [[Major]] [[Carl Rogers Darnall]], Professor of Chemistry at the [[Army Medical School]]. Darnall's work became the basis for present day systems of municipal [[water purification]].

;Subways
In 1863 the [[London Underground]] was created. In 1890, it first started using electric traction and deep-level tunnels. Soon afterwards, [[Budapest]] and many other cities started using subway systems. By 1940, nineteen subway systems were in use.

=== Since 1920 ===
[[File:401 widest point.jpg|thumb|A multi-lane, multi-carriageway [[freeway]]]]
;Roads
In 1925, [[Italy]] was the first country to build a freeway-like road, which linked [[Milan]] to [[Como]],&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hofmann, "Taking to the Highway in Italy", ''[[New York Times]]'', 26 April 1987, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; known as the [[Autostrada dei Laghi]]. In [[Germany]], the [[autobahns]] formed the first limited-access, high-speed road network in the world, with the first section from [[Frankfurt am Main]] to [[Darmstadt]] opening in 1935. The first long-distance rural freeway in the United States is generally considered to be the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]], which opened on October 1, 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Phil Patton, ''The Open Road: A Celebration of the American Highway (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1986), 77.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], the [[Interstate Highway]] System was authorised by the [[Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956]].&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;{{cite news  | title = The cracks are showing | publisher = ''The Economist'' | date = 2008-06-26 | url = http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates displayStory.cfm?story_id=11636517 | accessdate = 2008-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the system was completed between 1960 and 1990.
;The Internet
{{Main |History of the Internet |History of the World Wide Web}}
Research into [[packet switching]] started in the early 1960s. The [[ARPANET]] in particular led to the development of protocols for [[internetworking]], where multiple separate networks could be joined together into a network of networks
The first two nodes of what would become the [[ARPANET]] were interconnected on 29 October 1969.&lt;ref name="NetValley"&gt;[http://www.netvalley.com/intval.html "Roads and Crossroads of Internet History"] by Gregory Gromov. 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  Access to the ARPANET was expanded in 1981 when the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) developed the [[CSNET|Computer Science Network]] (CSNET).  In 1982, the [[Internet Protocol Suite]] (TCP/IP) was standardised and the concept of a world-wide network of fully interconnected TCP/IP networks called the [[Internet]] was introduced. TCP/IP network access expanded again in 1986 when the National Science Foundation Network ([[NSFNET]]) provided access to [[supercomputer]] sites in the United States from research and education organisations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merit.edu/about/history/pdf/NSFNET_final.pdf ''NSFNET: A Partnership for High-Speed Networking, Final Report 1987-1995''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210181738/http://www.merit.edu/about/history/pdf/NSFNET_final.pdf |date=2015-02-10 }}, Karen D. Frazer, Merit Network, Inc., 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial [[internet service providers]] (ISPs) began to emerge in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The ARPANET was decommissioned in 1990.

During the late 1990s, it was estimated that traffic on the public Internet grew by 100 percent per year, while the mean annual growth in the number of Internet users was thought to be between 20% and 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/internet.size.pdf |format=PDF| title=The size and growth rate of the Internet | accessdate=21 May 2007 | author=Coffman, K.

'''ISO/TC 37''' is a technical [[committee]] within the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) that prepares [[Technical standard|standards]] and other [[documents]] concerning [[methodology]] and principles for [[terminology]] and [[language resources]].

'''Title: Terminology and other language and content resources'''

'''Scope: [[Standardization]] of principles, methods and applications relating to [[terminology]] and other [[language]] and content [[resources]] in the [[contexts]] of [[multilingual]] [[communication]] and cultural [[Multiculturalism|diversity]]'''

ISO/TC 37 is a so-called "horizontal committee", providing guidelines for all other technical committees that develop standards on how to manage their terminological problems. However, the standards developed by ISO/TC 37 are not restricted to [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]. Collaboration with [[industry]] is sought to ensure that the requirements and needs from all possible users of standards concerning terminology, language and structured content are duly and timely addressed.

Involvement in standards development is open to all [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] and requests can be made to the TC through any liaison or member organization (see the list of current members and liaisons of ISO/TC 37:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iso.org/iso/standards_development/technical_committees/list_of_iso_technical_committees/iso_technical_committee.htm?commid=48104&lt;/ref&gt;)

ISO/TC 37 standards are therefore fundamental and should form the basis for many [[Internationalization and localization|localization]], [[translation]], and other [[industry]] [[Industrial application|applications]].

==ISO/TC 37 "Terminology and other language and content resources"==
International Standards are developed by [[expert]]s from [[industry]], [[academia]] and [[business]] who are [[delegates]] of their national standards institution or another [[organization]] in liaison. Involvement, therefore, is principally open to all [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]. They are based on consensus among those national standards institutes who collaborate in the respective committee by way of membership.

ISO/TC 37 develops [[International Standards]] concerning:
* terminological principles and methods
* vocabulary of terminology and language resource management
* terminology work
* preparation and management of language resources
* preparation and layout of terminology standards
* [[computer]]ized terminography and [[lexicography]]
* terminology [[documentation]]
* coding and [[code]]s in the field of terminology and other language resources
* applications of terminology and other language resources in [[language engineering]] and [[content management]]
* translation, interpreting and related technology

ISO/TC 37 looks upon a long [[history]] of terminology unification activities. In the past, terminology experts - even more so experts of terminology [[theory]] and methodology - had to struggle for wide recognition. Today their [[expertise]] is sought in many application areas, especially in various fields of standardization. The emerging multilingual [[information society]] and [[knowledge society]] will depend on reliable [[Digital data|digital]] content. [[Terminology]] is indispensable here. This is because terminology plays a crucial role wherever and whenever specialized [[information]] and [[knowledge]] is being prepared (e.g. in [[research and development]]), used (e.g. in specialized [[Textbook|texts]]), recorded and processed (e.g. in data banks), passed on (via [[training]] and [[teaching]]), implemented (e.g. in technology and knowledge transfer), or translated and interpreted. In the age of [[globalization]] the need for methodology standards concerning multilingual [[Digital data|digital]] [[Content (media and publishing)|content]] is increasing - ISO/TC 37 has developed over the years the [[expertise]] for methodology standards for [[science]] and [[technology]] related content in textual form.

==Terminology standardization==
The beginnings of terminology standardization are closely linked to the standardization efforts of IEC ([[International Electrotechnical Commission]], founded in 1906) and ISO ([[International Organization for Standardization]], founded in 1946).

A terminology standard according to [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] Guide 2 (1996) is defined as "standard that is concerned with terms, usually accompanied by their [[definition]]s, and sometimes by explanatory notes, [[illustration]]s, examples, etc."

ISO 1087-1:2000 defines [[terminology]] as ''"set of designations belonging to one special language" and designations as "[[Representation (systemics)|representation]] of a [[concept]] by a [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]] which denotes it".'' Here, concept representation goes beyond terms (being only linguistic signs), which is also supported by the state-of-the-art of terminology science, according to which terminology has three major functions:

# basic elements carrying meaning in [[Domain Name System|domain]] [[communication]],
# ordering of scientific-technical [[knowledge]] at the level of concepts,
# access to other representations of specialized information and knowledge.

The above indicates that terminological [[data]] (comprising various kinds of knowledge representation) possibly have a much more fundamental role in domain-related information and knowledge than commonly understood.

Today, terminology standardization can be subdivided into two distinct activities:
* standardization of terminologies,
* standardization of terminological principles and methods.

The two are mutually [[interdependent]], since the [[standardization]] of terminologies would not result in high-quality terminological data, if certain common principles, rules and methods are not observed. On the other hand, these standardized terminological principles, rules and methods must reflect the state-of-the-art of theory and methodology development in those domains, in which terminological data have to be standardized in connection with the formulation of subject standards.

Terminology gained a special position in the field of standardization at large, which is defined as ''"activity of establishing, with regard to actual or potential [[problem]]s, provisions for common and repeated use, aimed at the achievement of the optimum degree of order in a given context"'' (ISO/IEC 1996). Every technical committee or sub-committee or working group has to standardize subject matters, define and standardize its respective terminology. There is a consensus that terminology standardization precedes subject standardization (or "subject standardization requires terminology standardization").

==History of ISO/TC 37==
ISO/TC 37 was put into operation in 1952 in order "to find out and formulate general principles of terminology and terminological lexicography" (as terminography was called at that time).

The [[history]] of terminology standardization proper - if one excludes earlier attempts in the field of [[metrology]] - started in the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC), which was founded in [[London]] in 1906 following a recommendation passed at the International Electrical Congress, held in [[St. Louis]], United States, on 15 September 1904, to the extent that: ''"...steps should be taken to secure the co-operation of the technical societies of the world, by the appointment of a representative Commission to consider the question of the standardization of the [[nomenclature]] and ratings of [[electric]]al [[Electrical equipment|apparatus]] and [[machinery]]".'' From the very beginning, [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] considered it its foremost task to standardize the terminology of electrotechnology for the sake of the quality of its subject standards, and soon embarked upon the International Electrotechnical [[Vocabulary]] (IEV), whose first edition, based on many individual terminology standards, was published in 1938. The IEV is still being continued today, covering 77 chapters as parts of the International Standard series IEC 60050. The IEV [[Online]] [[Database]] can be accessed on Electropedia &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electropedia.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427022958/http://www.electropedia.org/ |archivedate=2015-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The predecessor to the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), the International Federation of Standardizing Associations (ISA, founded in 1926), made a similar experience. But it went a step further and - triggered by the publication of [[Eugen Wüster]]'s book "Internationale Sprachnormung in der Technik" [International standardization of technical language] (Wüster 1931) - established in 1936 the Technical Committee ISA/TC 37 "Terminology" for the sake of formulating general principles and rules for terminology standardization.

ISA/TC 37 conceived a scheme of four classes of recommendations for terminology standardization mentioned below, but the [[Second World War]] interrupted its [[Innovator|pioneering]] work. Nominally, ISO/TC 37 was established from the very beginning of ISO in 1946, but it was decided to re-activate it only in 1951 and the Committee started operation in 1952. Since then until 2009 the secretariat of ISO/TC 37 has been held by the International Information Centre for Terminology (Infoterm),&lt;ref name="infoterm"&gt;http://www.infoterm.org&lt;/ref&gt; on behalf of the [[Austrian Standards Institute]] Austria. Infoterm,&lt;ref name="infoterm" /&gt; an [[international non-governmental organization]] based in Austria, continues to collaborate as a [[twin towns and sister cities|twinning]] [[wikt:secretariat|secretariat]]. After this the administration went to CNIS (China).

==Objective of ISO/TC 37==
To prepare standards specifying principles and methods for the preparation and [[management]] of language resources within the framework of standardization and related activities. Its technical work results in [[International Standards]] (and Technical Reports) covering terminological principles and methods as well as various aspects of [[computer-assisted]] terminography. ISO/TC 37 is not responsible for the co-ordination of the terminology standardizing activities of other ISO/TCs.

'''ISO 216''' specifies [[International Organization for Standardization|international standard]] (ISO) [[paper size]]s used in most countries in the world today, although not in Canada, the United States, Mexico, Colombia, or the Dominican Republic. The standard defines the "'''A'''" and "'''B'''" series of paper sizes, including '''A4''', the most commonly available paper size worldwide. Two supplementary standards, [[ISO 217]] and [[ISO 269]], define related paper sizes; the '''ISO 269''' "'''C'''" series is commonly listed alongside the A and B sizes.

All ISO 216, ISO 217 and ISO 269 paper sizes (except some envelopes) have the same [[aspect ratio]], [[square root of 2|{{sqrt|2}}]]:1,  within rounding to [[millimetres]]. This ratio has the unique property that when cut or folded in half widthways, the halves also have the same aspect ratio. Each ISO paper size is one half of the area of the next larger size in the same series.

&lt;/ref&gt; The formats that became ISO paper sizes A2, A3, B3, B4, and B5 were developed in France. They were listed in a 1798 law on taxation of publications that was based in part on page sizes.&lt;ref name="B237"&gt;{{cite web

[[Image:Comparison_paper_sizes.svg|thumb|Comparison of A4 (shaded grey) and C4 sizes with some similar paper and photographic paper sizes.]]

The main advantage of this system is its scaling. [[Rectangle|Rectangular]] paper with an aspect ratio of {{sqrt|2}} has the unique property that, when cut or folded in half midway between its shorter sides, each half has the same {{sqrt|2}} aspect ratio and half the [[area]] of the whole sheet before it was divided. Equivalently, if one lays two same-sized sheets paper with an aspect ratio of {{sqrt|2}} side-by-side along their longer side, they form a larger rectangle with the aspect ratio of {{sqrt|2}} and double the area of each individual sheet.

The ISO system of paper sizes exploit these properties of the {{sqrt|2}} aspect ratio. In each series of sizes (for example, series A), the largest size is numbered 0 (for example, A0), and each successive size (for example, A1, A2, etc.) has half the area of the preceding sheet and can be cut by halving the length of the preceding size sheet. The new measurement is rounded down to the nearest millimetre.  A folded [[brochure]] can be made by using a sheet of the next larger size (for example, an A4 sheet is folded in half to make a brochure with size A5 pages. An office [[photocopier]] or printer can be designed to reduce a page from A4 to A5 or to enlarge a page from A4 to A3. Similarly, two sheets of A4 can be scaled down to fit one A4 sheet without excess empty paper.

This system also simplifies calculating the weight of paper. Under [[ISO 536]], paper's [[grammage]] is defined as a sheet's weight in [[gram]]s (g) per area in [[square metre]]s (abbreviated g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or gsm).&lt;ref name="ISO 536"&gt;{{Cite web
|author=International Organization for Standardization |author-link=International Organization for Standardization
|title=ISO 536:2012(en): Paper and board — Determination of grammage
|edition=3 |at=§&amp;nbsp; 3.1 note 1.
|work=ISO Browsing Platform
|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since an A0 sheet has an area of 1&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, its weight in grams is the same as its grammage. One can derive the grammage of other sizes by [[Division  (mathematics)|arithmetic division]] in g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. A standard A4 sheet made from 80&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; paper weighs 5&amp;nbsp;g, as it is {{sfrac|1|16}} (four halvings, ignoring rounding) of an A0 page. Thus the weight, and the associated postage rate, can be easily approximated by counting the number of sheets used.

ISO 216 and its related standards were first published between 1975 and 1995:
* ISO 216:2007, defining the A and B series of paper sizes
* ISO 269:1985, defining the C series for envelopes
* ISO 217:2013, defining the RA and SRA series of raw ("untrimmed") paper sizes

==A series==

Paper in the A series format has an aspect ratio of {{sqrt|2}} (≈ 1.414, when ignoring rounding). A0 is defined so that it has an area of 1 [[square metre]] before rounding to the nearest millimeter. Successive paper sizes in the series (A1, A2, A3, etc.) are defined by halving the length of the preceding paper size and rounding down, so that the long side of A(''n''+1) is the same length as the short side of A''n''. Hence, each next size is roughly half of the prior size. So, an A1 page can fit 2 A2 pages inside the same area.

The most used of this series is the size A4, which is {{cvt|210|x|297|mm |sigfig=3}} and thus almost exactly {{convert|0.0625|m2|sqin}} in area. For comparison, the [[Letter (paper size)|letter]] paper size commonly used in North America ({{convert|8+1/2|x|11|in|sigfig=3|abbr=on|disp=comma}}) is about 6&amp;nbsp;mm (0.24&amp;nbsp;in) wider and 18&amp;nbsp;mm (0.71&amp;nbsp;in) shorter than A4. Then, the size of A5 paper is half of A4, as 148&amp;nbsp;x 210&amp;nbsp;mm (5.8 x 8.3&amp;nbsp;in).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= A Paper Sizes - A0, A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A9 |date= |url= https://www.papersizes.org/a-paper-sizes.htm |website= papersizes.org |accessdate= 2018-08-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= International Paper Sizes, Dimensions, Format &amp; Standards |date= |url= https://papersize.co/ |website= PaperSize |accessdate= 2018-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The geometric rationale behind the [[square root of 2]] is to maintain the aspect ratio of each subsequent rectangle after cutting or folding an A-series sheet in half, perpendicular to the larger side.  Given a rectangle with a longer side, {{math|''x''}}, and a shorter side, {{math|''y''}}, ensuring that its aspect ratio, {{math|{{sfrac|''x''|''y''}}}}, will be the same as that of a rectangle half its size, {{math|{{sfrac|''y''|''x''/2}}}}, which means that {{math|1={{sfrac|''x''|''y''}} = {{sfrac|''y''|''x''/2}}}}, which reduces to {{math|1={{sfrac|''x''|''y''}} = {{sqrt|2}}}}; in other words, an aspect ratio of 1:{{sqrt|2}}.

The formula that gives the larger border of the paper size A''n'' in metres and without rounding off is the [[geometric sequence]]:
:&lt;math&gt;a_n = 2^{\frac{1}{4} - \frac{n}{2}}.&lt;/math&gt;
The paper size A''n'' thus has the dimension
:&lt;math&gt;a_{n} \times a_{n + 1}&lt;/math&gt;
and area (before rounding)
:&lt;math&gt;2^{-n}~\mathrm{m}^2.&lt;/math&gt;

The measurement in millimetres of the long side of A''n'' can be calculated as
:&lt;math&gt;l= \left\lfloor\, \frac{1000}{\,2^\frac{2n - 1}{4}\,} + 0.2 \,\right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;
(brackets represent the [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor]] function).

==B series==
The B series is defined in the standard as follows: "A subsidiary series of sizes is obtained by placing the [[Geometric mean|geometrical means]] between adjacent sizes of the A series in sequence." The use of the geometric mean  makes each step in size: B0, A0, B1, A1, B2 &amp;hellip;  smaller than the previous one by the same factor. As with the A series, the lengths of the B series have the ratio {{sqrt|2}}, and folding one in half (and rounding down to the nearest millimeter) gives the next in the series. The shorter side of B0 is exactly 1 metre.

The measurement in millimetres of the long side of B''n'' can be calculated as
:&lt;math&gt;l= \left\lfloor\, \frac{1000}{\,2^\frac{n - 1}{2}\,} + 0.2 \,\right\rfloor.&lt;/math&gt;

There is also an incompatible Japanese B series which the [[Japanese Industrial Standard|JIS]] defines to have 1.5 times the area of the corresponding JIS A series (which is identical to the ISO A series).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paper-sizes.com/uncommon-paper-sizes/japanese-b-series-paper-size|title=Japanese B Series Paper Size|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the lengths of JIS B series paper are {{sqrt|1.5}} ≈ 1.22 times those of A-series paper. By comparison, the lengths of ISO B series paper are {{sqrt|2|4}} ≈ 1.19 times those of A-series paper.

==C series==
The C series formats are  geometric means between the B series and A series formats with the same number (e.g., C2 is the geometric mean between B2 and A2). The width to height ratio is {{sqrt|2}} as in the A and B series. The C series formats are used mainly for [[envelope]]s. An A4 page will fit into a C4 envelope. C series envelopes follow the same ratio principle as the A series pages. For example, if an A4 page is folded in half so that it is A5 in size, it will fit into a C5 envelope (which will be the same size as a C4 envelope folded in half). The lengths of ISO C series paper are therefore {{sqrt|2|8}} ≈ 1.09 times those of A-series paper.

A, B, and C paper fit together as part of a [[geometric progression]], with ratio of successive side lengths of {{sqrt|2|8}}, though there is no size half-way between B''n'' and A(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1): A4, C4, B4, "D4", A3, …; there is such a D-series in the [[Paper size#Swedish extensions|Swedish extensions]] to the system.

The measurement in millimetres of the long side of C''n'' can be calculated as
:&lt;math&gt;l= \left\lfloor\, \frac{1000}{\,2^\frac{4n - 3}{8}\,} + 0.2 \,\right\rfloor.&lt;/math&gt;

==Tolerances==
The tolerances specified in the standard are:
* [[±]]1.5&amp;nbsp;mm for dimensions up to 150&amp;nbsp;mm,
* ±2.0&amp;nbsp;mm for dimensions in the range 150 to 600&amp;nbsp;mm, and
* ±3.0&amp;nbsp;mm for dimensions above 600&amp;nbsp;mm.

These are related to comparison between series A, B and C.

==Application==

The ISO 216 formats are organized around the ratio 1:{{sqrt|2}}; two sheets next to each other together have the same ratio, sideways.  In scaled photocopying, for example, two A4 sheets reduced to A5 size fit exactly onto one A4 sheet, and an A4 sheet in magnified size onto an A3 sheet; in each case, there is neither waste nor want.

The principal countries not generally using the ISO paper sizes are the United States and Canada, which use the [[Paper size#Loose sizes|Letter, Legal and Executive system]].  Although they have also officially adopted the ISO 216 paper format, Mexico, Panama, Venezuela, Colombia, the Philippines, and Chile also use mostly U.S. paper sizes.

[[Rectangle|Rectangular]] sheets of paper with the ratio 1:{{sqrt|2}} are popular in [[paper folding]], such as [[mathematics of paper folding|origami]], where they are sometimes called "A4 rectangles" or "silver rectangles".&lt;ref name="Lister"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishorigami.info/academic/lister/a4.php|title=The A4 rectangle|last=Lister|first=David|work=The Lister List|publisher=British Origami Society|location=England|accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other contexts, the term "silver rectangle" can also refer to a rectangle in the proportion 1:(1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{sqrt|2}}), known as the [[silver ratio]].

==Matching technical pen widths==
An important adjunct to the ISO paper sizes, particularly the A series, are the technical drawing line widths specified in [[ISO 128]], and the matching technical pen widths of 0.13, 0.18, 0.25, 0.35, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.40, and 2.0&amp;nbsp;mm, as specified in [[:de:ISO 9175-1|ISO 9175-1]]. Color codes are assigned to each size to facilitate easy recognition by the drafter. These sizes increase by a factor of {{sqrt|2}}, so that particular pens can be used on particular sizes of paper, and then the next smaller or larger size can be used to continue the drawing after it has been reduced or enlarged, respectively. For example, a continuous thick line on A0 size paper shall be drawn with a 0.7&amp;nbsp;mm pen, the same line on A1 paper shall be drawn with a 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm pen, and finally on A2, A3, or A4 paper it shall be drawn with a 0.35&amp;nbsp;mm pen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-paper.html|title=International standard paper sizes|last1=Kuhn|first1=Markus|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/Technical_drawing_pen_sizes|title=Technical drawing pen sizes|website=Designing Buildings Wiki|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrication.com/drafting/lines.html|title=Pen Sizes and Line Types|last1=Bell|first1=Steven|website=Metrication.com|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Integrated Computational Materials Engineering''' (ICME) is an approach to design products, the materials that comprise them, and their associated materials processing methods by linking materials models at multiple length scales.  Key words are "Integrated", involving integrating models at multiple length scales, and "[[Engineering]]", signifying industrial utility.  The focus is on the materials, i.e. understanding how processes produce material [[microstructure|structures]], how those structures give rise to [[list of materials properties|material properties]], and how to [[material selection|select materials]] for a given application. The key links are process-structures-properties-performance.&lt;ref name=Olson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olson|first=Gregory B.|journal=Science|date=May 2000|volume=288|pages=993–998|url=http://srg.northwestern.edu/Publications%20Library/Journals/2000_DesigningNewMaterialWorld_Science_small.pdf|doi=10.1126/science.288.5468.993 |title= Designing a New Material World }}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Academies report&lt;ref name=NationalAcademiesReport&gt;{{cite book|last=Committee on Integrated Computational Materials Engineering, National Materials Advisory Board, Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences, National Research Council|title=Integrated Computational Materials Engineering: A Transformational Discipline for Improved Competitiveness and National Security|year=2008|publisher=National Academies Press|pages=132|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JlfSnH8jI4UC&amp;dq=Standardized+information+exchange+in+Integrated+Computational+Materials+Engineering+-wikipedia|isbn=9780309178211}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the need for using multiscale materials modeling&lt;ref name=Horstemeyer&gt;{{cite book|title=Practical Aspects of Computational Chemistry|year=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-481-2686-6|author=M.F.

== Standardization in ICME ==
A fundamental requirement to meet the ambitious ICME objective of designing materials for specific products resp. components is an integrative and interdisciplinary computational description of the history of the component starting from the sound initial condition of a homogeneous, isotropic and stress free melt resp. gas phase and continuing via subsequent processing steps and eventually ending in the description of failure onset under operational load.&lt;ref name=NationalAcademiesReport /&gt;&lt;ref name=Panchal&gt;{{cite journal|last=Panchal|first=Jitesh H.|author2=Surya R.

Integrated Computational Materials Engineering is an approach to design products, the materials that comprise them, and their associated materials processing methods by linking materials models at multiple length scales. ICME thus naturally requires the combination of a variety of models and software tools. It is thus a common objective to build up a scientific network of stakeholders concentrating on boosting ICME into industrial application by defining a common communication standard for ICME relevant tools.&lt;ref name=Schmitz&gt;{{cite book|title=Integrative Computational Materials Engineering- Concepts and applications of a modular simulation platform|year=2012|publisher=Wiley VCH Verlag|location=Weinheim|isbn=978-3-527-33081-2|editor=Schmitz, G.

== Standardization of information exchange ==

[[File:ICMEg concept.jpg|right|thumb|284x284px]]
Efforts to generate a common language by standardizing and generalizing data formats for the exchange of simulation results represent a major mandatory step towards successful future applications of ICME. A future, structural framework for ICME comprising a variety of academic and/or commercial simulation tools operating on different scales and being modular interconnected by a common language in form of standardized data exchange will allow integrating different disciplines along the production chain, which by now have only scarcely interacted. This will substantially improve the understanding of individual processes by integrating the component history originating from preceding steps as the initial condition for the actual process. Eventually this will lead to optimized process and production scenarios and will allow effective tailoring of specific materials and component properties.&lt;ref name=Schmitz_2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmitz|first=G.J.|author2=Prahl, U.|title=Toward a virtual platform for materials processing|journal=JOM|year=2009|volume=61|issue=5|doi=10.1007/s11837-009-0064-0|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11837-009-0064-0|pages=19–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The ICMEg project and its mission ===

The ICMEg&lt;ref name=icmeg.eu&gt;{{cite web|title=ICMEg project|url=http://icmeg.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; project aims to build up a scientific network of stakeholders concentrating on boosting ICME into industrial application by defining a common communication standard for ICME relevant tools. Eventually this will allow stakeholders from electronic, atomistic, mesoscopic and continuum communities to benefit from sharing knowledge and best practice and thus to promote a deeper understanding between the different communities of materials scientists, IT engineers and industrial users.

ICMEg will create an international network of simulation providers and users.&lt;ref name=icmeg.workshop&gt;{{cite web|title=ICMEg workshops|url=http://www.icmeg.euproject.info/icmeg-workshop.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will promote a deeper understanding between the different communities (academia and industry) each of them by now using very different tools/methods and data formats. The harmonization and standardization of information exchange along the life-cycle of a component and across the different scales (electronic, atomistic, mesoscopic, continuum) are the key activity of ICMEg.

The mission of ICMEg is
* to establish and to maintain a network of contacts to simulation software providers, governmental and international standardization authorities, ICME users, associations in the area of materials and processing, and academia
* to define and communicate an ICME language in form of an open and standardized communication protocol
* to stimulate knowledge sharing in the field of multiscale materials design
* to identify missing tools, models and functionalities and propose a roadmap for their development
* to discuss and to decide about future amendments to the initial standard

The activities of ICMEg include
* Organization of International Workshops on Software Solutions for Integrated Computational Materials Engineering&lt;ref name=icmeg.workshop /&gt;
* Conducting market study and surwey on available simulation software for ICME&lt;ref name=icmeg.eu /&gt;
* Create and maintain forum for knowledge sharing in ICME &lt;ref name=icmeg.eu /&gt;

== Multiscale modeling in material processing ==
[[Multiscale modeling]] aims to evaluate material properties or behavior on one level using information or models from different levels and properties of elementary processes.
Usually, the following levels, addressing a phenomenon over a specific window of length and time, are recognized:

* Structural scale: [[Finite element method|Finite element]], [[finite volume method|finite volume]] and [[finite difference method|finite difference]] [[partial differential equation]] are solvers used to simulate structural responses such as [[solid mechanics]] and [[transport phenomena]] at large (meters) scales.
** process modeling/simulations: extrusion, rolling, sheet forming, stamping, casting, welding, etc.
** product modeling/simulations: performance, impact, fatigue, corrosion, etc.
* Macroscale: constitutive (rheology) equations are used at the continuum level in [[solid mechanics]] and [[transport phenomena]] at millimeter scales.
* Mesoscale: continuum level formulations are used with discrete quantities at multiple micrometre scale. "Meso" is an ambiguous term that means "intermediate" so it has been used as representing different intermediate scales. In this context it can represent modeling from crystal plasticity for metals, Eshelby solutions for any materials, homogenization methods, and unit cell methods.  
* Microscale: modeling techniques that represent the micrometre scale such as dislocation dynamics codes for metals and phase field models for multiphase materials. [[Phase field models]] of [[phase transition]]s and [[microstructure]] formation and evolution on nanometer to millimeter scales.
* Nanoscale: semi-empirical atomistic methods are used such as Lennard-Jones, Brenner potentials, embedded atom method (EAM) potentials, and modified embedded atom potentials (MEAM) in [[molecular dynamics]] (MD), molecular statics (MS), [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] (MC), and [[kinetic Monte Carlo]] (KMC) formulations.
* Electronic scale: Schroedinger equations are used in computational framework as [[density functional theory]] (DFT) models of electron orbitals and bonding on angstrom to nanometer scales.

There are some software codes that operate on different length scales such as:

*[[CALPHAD]] computational [[thermodynamics]] for prediction of equilibrium [[phase diagram]]s and even non-equilibrium phases.
*[[Phase field models#Software|''Phase field codes'']] for simulation of microstructure evolution 
*[[Database]]s of processing parameters, [[microstructure]] features, and [[list of materials properties|properties]] from which one can draw correlations at various length scales
*[https://www.geodict.com GeoDict] - The Digital Material Laboratory by [https://www.math2market.de Math2Market]
*[http://vextec.com/demos/ VPS-MICRO] is a multiscale probabilistic fracture mechanics software.
*[http://analyswift.com/swiftcomp-vamuch-micromechanics-modeling-of-heterogeneous-materials/ SwiftComp] is a multiscale constitutive modeling software based on mechanics of structure genome.

A comprehensive compilation of software tools with relevance for ICME is documented in the Handbook of Software Solutions for ICME&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Examples of Model integration ==

*Small scale models calculate [[list of materials properties|material properties]], or relationships between properties and parameters, e.g. [[yield (engineering)|yield strength]] vs. [[temperature]], for use in continuum models
*[[CALPHAD]] computational thermodynamics software predicts free energy as a function of composition; a phase field model then uses this to predict structure formation and development, which one may then correlate with properties.
*An essential ingredient to model microstructure evolution by [[phase field models]] and other microstructre evolution codes are the initial and boundary conditions. While boundary conditions may be taken e.g. from the  simulation of the actual process, the initial conditions (i.e. the initial microstructure entering into the actual process step) involve the entire integrated process history starting from the homogeneous, isotropic and stress free melt. Thus - for a successful ICME - an efficient exchange of information along the entire process chain and across all relevant length scales is mandatory. The models to be combined for this purpose comprise both academic and/or commercial modelling tools and simulation software packages. To streamline the information flow within this heterogeneous variety of modelling tools, the concept of a modular, standardized simulation platform has recently been proposed.&lt;ref name=Schmitz /&gt; A first realisation of this concept is the [http://www.aixvipmap.de '' AixViPMaP® '']- the Aachen Virtual Platform for Materials Processing.
*Process models calculate spatial distribution of structure features, e.g. fiber density and orientation in a [[composite material]]; small-scale models then calculate relationships between structure and properties, for use in a continuum models of overall part or system behavior
*Large scale models explicitly fully couple with small scale models, e.g. a [[fracture]] simulation might integrate a continuum solid mechanics model of macroscopic deformation with an FD model of atomic motions at the crack tip
*Suites of models (large-scale, small-scale, atomic-scale, process-structure, structure-properties, etc.) can be hierarchically integrated into a systems design framework to enable the computational design of entirely new materials.  A commercial leader in the use of ICME in computational materials design is [http://www.questek.com QuesTek Innovations LLC], a small business in Evanston, IL co-founded by [http://www.matsci.northwestern.edu/faculty/gbo.html Prof. Greg Olson of Northwestern University].

==Education==

Katsuyo Thorton announced at the 2010 MS&amp;T ICME Technical Committee meeting that NSF would be funding a "[http://www.umich.edu/~mctp/SciPrgPgs/events/2012/SS12/sponsors.html Summer School]" on ICME at the [[University of Michigan]] starting in 2011. Northwestern began offering a [http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/materials-science/documents/graduate/icme-brochure.pdf Masters of Science Certificate] in ICME in the fall of 2011.  The first Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) course based upon Horstemeyer 2012&lt;ref name="Horstemeyer 2012" /&gt; was delivered at Mississippi State University (MSU) in 2012 as a graduate course with distance learning students included [c.f., Sukhija et al., 2013].  It was later was taught in 2013 and 2014 at MSU also with distance learning students. In 2015, the [https://icme.hpc.msstate.edu/mediawiki/index.php/Mississippi_State_University ICME Course] was taught by Dr. Mark Horstemeyer (MSU) and Dr. William (Bill) Shelton (Louisiana State University, LSU) with students from each institution via distance learning. The goal of the methodology embraced in this course was to provide students with the basic skills to take advantage of the computational tools and experimental data provided by EVOCD in conducting simulations and bridging procedures for quantifying the structure-property relationships of materials at multiple length scales. On successful completion of the assigned projects, students published their multiscale modeling learning outcomes on the [http://icme.hpc.msstate.edu/ ICME Wiki], facilitating easy assessment of student achievements and embracing qualities set by the ABET engineering accreditation board.

In [[computing]], a '''legacy system''' is an old method, technology, [[computer system]], or [[Application software|application program]], "of, relating to, or being a previous or outdated computer system,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Merriam-Webster|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/legacy|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet still in use. Often referencing a system as "legacy" means that it paved the way for the standards that would follow it. This can also imply that the system is out of date or in need of replacement.

== Overview ==
The source of the term "legacy" in a technical sense is [[Legacy preferences|its use in university admissions]]. In that context , a "legacy" is a [[euphemism]], used to describe someone receiving special treatment during admissions, because descended from an [[alumnus]].

The first use of the term "legacy" to describe computer systems probably occurred in the 1970s.  By the 1980s it was commonly used to refer to existing computer systems to distinguish them from the design and implementation of new systems. Legacy was often heard during a conversion process, for example, when moving data from the legacy system to a new database.

While this term may indicate that some engineers may feel that a system is out of date, a legacy system may continue to be used for a variety of reasons. It may simply be that the system still provides for the users' needs. In addition, the decision to keep an old system may be influenced by economic reasons such as [[return on investment]] challenges or [[vendor lock-in]], the inherent challenges of [[change management]], or a variety of other reasons other than functionality. [[Backward compatibility]] (such as the ability of newer systems to handle legacy [[file format]]s and [[character encoding]]s) is a goal that [[software developer]]s often include in their work.

Even if it is no longer used, a legacy system may continue to impact the organization due to its historical role. Historic data may not have been converted into the new system format and may exist within the new system with the use of a customized [[schema crosswalk]], or may exist only in a [[data warehouse]]. In either case, the effect on [[business intelligence]] and [[operational reporting]] can be significant.  A legacy system may include procedures or terminology which are no longer relevant in the current context, and may hinder or confuse understanding of the methods or technologies used.

Organizations can have compelling reasons for keeping a legacy system, such as:
* The system works satisfactorily, and the owner sees no reason to change it.
* The costs of redesigning or replacing the system are prohibitive because it is large, [[monolithic system|monolithic]], and/or complex.
* Retraining on a new system would be costly in lost time and money, compared to the anticipated appreciable benefits of replacing it (which may be zero).
* The system requires near-constant [[availability]], so it cannot be taken out of service, and the cost of designing a new system with a similar availability level is high. Examples include systems to handle customers' accounts in [[bank]]s, [[computer reservations system]]s, [[air traffic control]], energy distribution ([[power grid]]s), [[nuclear power plant]]s, military defense installations, and systems such as the [[TOPS]] database.
* The way that the system works is not well understood. Such a situation can occur when the designers of the system have left the organization, and the system has either not been fully documented or documentation has been lost.
* The user expects that the system can easily be replaced when this becomes necessary.
* Newer systems perform undesirable (especially for individual or non-institutional users) secondary functions such as ''a'') tracking and reporting of user activity and/or ''b'') automatic updating that creates "[[Backdoor (computing)|back-door]]" security vulnerabilities and leaves end users dependent on the good faith and honesty of the vendor providing the updates.  This problem is especially acute when these secondary functions of a newer system cannot be disabled.

==Problems posed by legacy computing==
Legacy systems are considered to be potentially problematic by some software engineers for several reasons.&lt;ref&gt;(for example, see Bisbal et al., 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;
* If legacy [[software]] runs on only antiquated [[computer hardware|hardware]], the cost of maintaining the system may eventually outweigh the cost of replacing both the software and hardware unless some form of [[emulator|emulation]] or [[backward compatibility]] allows the software to run on new hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lamb|first1=John|title=Legacy systems continue to have a place in the enterprise|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Legacy-systems-continue-to-have-a-place-in-the-enterprise|accessdate=27 October 2014|work=Computer Weekly|date=June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* These systems can be hard to maintain, improve, and expand because there is a general lack of understanding of the system; the staff who were experts on it have retired or forgotten what they knew about it, and staff who entered the field after it became "legacy" never learned about it in the first place. This can be worsened by lack or loss of documentation. [[Comair]] airline company fired its CEO in 2004 due to the failure of an antiquated legacy crew scheduling system that ran into a limitation not known to anyone in the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephanie Overby |url=http://www.cio.com/article/112103/Comair_s_Christmas_Disaster_Bound_To_Fail |title=Comair's Christmas Disaster: Bound To Fail - CIO.com - Business Technology Leadership |publisher=CIO.com |date=2005-05-01 |accessdate=2012-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Legacy systems may have vulnerabilities in older operating systems or applications due to lack of security patches being available or applied. There can also be production configurations that cause security problems. These issues can put the legacy system at risk of being compromised by attackers or knowledgeable insiders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Razermouse |url=http://www.mousesecurity.com/?p=220 |title=The Danger of Legacy Systems |publisher=Mousesecurity.com |date=2011-05-03 |accessdate=2012-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323165836/http://www.mousesecurity.com/?p=220 |archivedate=March 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Integration with newer systems may also be difficult because new software may use completely different technologies.  Integration across technology is quite common in computing, but integration between newer technologies and substantially older ones is not common.  There may simply not be sufficient demand for integration technology to be developed.  Some of this "glue" code is occasionally developed by vendors and enthusiasts of particular legacy technologies.
*Budgetary constraints often lead corporations to not address the need of replacement or migration of a legacy system. However, companies often don’t consider the increasing supportability costs (people, software and hardware, all mentioned above) and do not take into consideration the enormous loss of capability or business continuity if the legacy system were to fail. Once these considerations are well understood, then based on the proven ROI of a new, more secure, updated technology stack platform is not as costly as the alternative - and the budget is found.
*Due to the fact that most legacy programmers are entering retirement age and the number of young engineers replacing them is very small, there is an alarming shortage of available workforce. This in turn results in difficulty in maintaining legacy systems, as well as an increase in costs of procuring experienced programmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.modernizationhub.com|title=Benefits of Mainframe Modernization|last=|first=|date=|website=Modernization Hub|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Improvements on legacy software systems==
Where it is impossible to replace legacy systems through the practice of [[application retirement]], it is still possible to enhance (or "re-face") them. Most development often goes into adding new interfaces to a legacy system.  The most prominent technique is to provide a Web-based interface to a terminal-based mainframe application. This may reduce staff productivity due to slower response times and slower mouse-based operator actions, yet it is often seen as an "upgrade", because the interface style is familiar to unskilled users and is easy for them to use. John McCormick discusses such strategies that involve [[Middleware (distributed applications)|middleware]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jun 02, 2000 |url=http://www.gcn.com/state/vol6_no6/guide/748-1.html |title=Mainframe-web middleware - John McCormick |publisher=Gcn.com |date=2000-06-02 |accessdate=2012-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Printing improvements are problematic because legacy software systems often add no formatting instructions, or they use protocols that are not usable in modern PC/Windows printers. A print server can be used to intercept the data and translate it to a more modern code. [[Rich Text Format|Rich Text Format (RTF)]] or [[PostScript]] documents may be created in the legacy application and then interpreted at a PC before being printed.

Biometric security measures are difficult to implement on legacy systems.  A workable solution is to use a [[telnet]] or [[http]] proxy server to sit between users and the mainframe to implement secure access to the legacy application.

The change being undertaken in some organizations is to switch to [[automated business process]] (ABP) software which generates complete systems. These systems can then interface to the organizations' legacy systems and use them as [[Information repository|data repositories]]. This approach can provide a number of significant benefits: the users are insulated from the inefficiencies of their legacy systems, and the changes can be incorporated quickly and easily in the ABP software.

[[Model-driven engineering|Model-driven]] [[reverse engineering|reverse]] and [[forward engineering]] approaches can be also used for the improvement of legacy software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Software modernization and cloudification using the ARTIST migration methodology and framework | publisher = Scalable Computing: Practice and Experience (SCPE) | year = 2014 | volume = 15 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.12694/scpe.v15i2.980 | doi = 10.12694/scpe.v15i2.980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NASA example==

Andreas Hein, from the Technical University of Munich, researched the use of legacy systems in space exploration.  According to Hein, legacy systems are attractive for reuse if an organization has the capabilities for verification, validation, testing, and operational history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = A.M. Hein | title = How to Assess Heritage Systems in the Early Phases? | publisher = ESA | series = 6th International Systems &amp; Concurrent Engineering for Space Applications Conference 2014  | year = 2014 | url = https://www.academia.edu/8441540/How_to_Assess_Heritage_Systems_in_the_Early_Phases }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = A.M. Hein | title = Heritage Technologies in Space Programs - Assessment Methodology and Statistical Analysis | publisher = Technical University of Munich | series = PhD thesis Faculty of Mechanical Engineering  | year = 2016 | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310478449_Heritage_Technologies_in_Space_Programs_-_Assessment_Methodology_and_Statistical_Analysis }}&lt;/ref&gt; These capabilities must be integrated into various software life cycle phases such as development, implementation, usage, or maintenance. For software systems, the capability to use and maintain the system are crucial. Otherwise the system will become less and less understandable and maintainable.

According to Hein, verification, validation, testing, and operational history increases the confidence in a system's reliability and quality. However, accumulating this history is often expensive. NASA's now retired [[Space Shuttle]] program used a large amount of 1970s-era technology. Replacement was cost-prohibitive because of the expensive requirement for flight certification.  The original hardware completed the expensive integration and certification requirement for flight, but any new equipment would have had to go through that entire process again.  This long and detailed process required extensive tests of the new components in their new configurations before a single unit could be used in the Space Shuttle program. Thus any new system that started the certification process becomes a ''[[de facto]]'' legacy system by the time it is approved for flight.

Additionally, the entire Space Shuttle system, including ground and launch vehicle assets, was designed to work together as a closed system.  Since the specifications did not change, all of the certified systems and components performed well in the roles for which they were designed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = A.M. Hein | title = How to Assess Heritage Systems in the Early Phases? | publisher = ESA | series = 6th International Systems &amp; Concurrent Engineering for Space Applications Conference 2014 | year = 2014 | url = https://www.academia.edu/8441540/How_to_Assess_Heritage_Systems_in_the_Early_Phases| page =3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even before the Shuttle was scheduled to be retired in 2010, NASA found it advantageous to keep using many pieces of 1970s technology rather than to upgrade those systems and recertify the new components.

==Additional uses of the term ''Legacy'' in computing==
The term ''legacy support'' is often used in conjunction with legacy systems. The term may refer to a feature of modern software.  For example, [[Operating system]]s with "legacy support" can detect and use older hardware. The term may also be used to refer to a business function; e.g.  A software or hardware vendor that is supporting, or providing [[software maintenance]], for older products.

A "legacy" product may be a product that is no longer sold, has lost substantial market share, or is a version of a product that is not current.  A legacy product may have some advantage over a modern product making it appealing for customers to keep it around. A product is only truly "obsolete" if it has [[Pareto efficiency|an advantage to nobody]] – if no person making a rational decision would choose to acquire it new.

The term "legacy mode" often refers specifically to [[backward compatibility]]. A software product that is capable of performing as though it were a previous version of itself, is said to be "running in legacy mode."  This kind of feature is common in operating systems and internet browsers, where many applications depend on these underlying components.

The [[Mainframe computer|computer mainframe]] era saw many applications running in legacy mode. In the modern business computing environment, [[n-tier]], or [[3-tier]] [[Computer architecture|architectures]] are more difficult to place into legacy mode as they include many components making up a single system.

[[Virtual machine|Virtualization]] technology is a recent innovation allowing legacy systems to continue to operate on modern hardware by running older operating systems and browsers on a software system that emulates legacy hardware.

==Brownfield architecture==

Programmers have borrowed the term [[Brownfield land|''brownfield'']] from the construction industry, where  previously developed land (often polluted and abandoned) is described as ''brownfield''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchunifiedcommunications.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid186_gci1062754,00.html |title=Definition of greenfield and brownfield deployment |publisher=Searchunifiedcommunications.techtarget.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Brownfield architecture'' is a type of software or network architecture that incorporates legacy systems.
* ''Brownfield deployment'' is an upgrade or addition to an existing software or network architecture that retains legacy components.

==Alternative view==
There is an alternate favorable opinion &amp;mdash; growing since the end of the Dotcom bubble in 1999 &amp;mdash; that legacy systems are simply computer systems in working use:

{{quote|"[[Legacy code]]" often differs from its suggested alternative by actually working and scaling.|[[q:Bjarne Stroustrup|Bjarne Stroustrup, creator of C++]]}}

IT analysts estimate that the cost of replacing [[business logic]] is about five times that of reuse,{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} even discounting the risk of system failures and security breaches. Ideally, businesses would never have to [[Rewrite (programming)|rewrite]] most core business logic: ''debits = credits'' is a perennial requirement. 

The IT industry is responding with "legacy modernization" and "legacy transformation": refurbishing existing business logic with new user interfaces, sometimes using [[screen scraping]] and service-enabled access through [[web service]]s. These techniques allow organizations to understand their existing code assets (using discovery tools), provide new user and application interfaces to existing code, improve workflow, contain costs, minimize risk, and enjoy classic qualities of service (near 100% uptime, security, scalability, etc.).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

This trend also invites reflection on what makes legacy systems so durable. Technologists are relearning the importance of sound [[Computer architecture|architecture]] from the start, to avoid costly and risky rewrites. The most common legacy systems tend to be those which embraced well-known IT architectural principles, with careful planning and strict methodology during implementation. Poorly designed systems often don't last, both because they wear out and because their inherent faults invite replacement. Thus, many organizations are rediscovering the value of both their legacy systems and the theortical underpinnings of those systems.

==Backlash==
{{main article|Backlash (engineering)}}
In [[mechanical engineering]], backlash is the striking back of connected wheels in a piece of mechanism when pressure is applied. Another source defines it as the maximum distance through which one part of something can be moved without moving a connected part. It is also called lash or play. In the context of [[gears]], backlash is clearance between mating components, or the amount of lost motion due to clearance or slackness when movement is reversed and contact is re-established. In a pair of gears, backlash is the amount of clearance between mated gear teeth.

Backlash is unavoidable for nearly all reversing mechanical couplings, although its effects can be negated. Depending on the application it may or may not be desirable. Reasons for requiring backlash include allowing for [[lubrication]] and [[thermal expansion]], and to prevent jamming. Backlash may also result from manufacturing errors and [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]] under load.

'''Tip relief''' is a modification of a tooth profile whereby a small amount of material is removed near the tip of the gear tooth.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt;

==Tooth surface==

[[Image:External numbering.jpg|left|thumb|Notation and numbering for an external gear]]
[[Image:Internal numbering.jpg|thumb|center|Notation and numbering for an internal gear]]

The '''tooth surface''' (flank) forms the side of a gear tooth.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt;

It is convenient to choose one face of the gear as the reference face and to mark it with the letter “I”.  The other non-reference face might be termed face “II”.

For an observer looking at the reference face, so that the tooth is seen with its tip uppermost, the right flank is on the right and the left flank is on the left. Right and left flanks are denoted by the letters “R” and “L” respectively.

{{more footnotes|date=October 2008}}

The '''Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard''' ('''METS''') is a [[metadata standards|metadata standard]] for encoding descriptive, administrative, and structural metadata regarding objects within a digital library, expressed using the [[XML]] schema language of the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C). The standard is maintained as part of the [[MARC standards]] of the [[Library of Congress]], and is being developed as an initiative of the [[Digital Library Federation]] (DLF).

==Overview==
METS is an XML Schema designed for the purpose of:
* Creating XML document instances that express the hierarchical structure of [[digital library]] objects.
* Recording the names and locations of the files that comprise those objects.
* Recording associated [[metadata]]. METS can, therefore, be used as a tool for modeling real world objects, such as particular document types.

Depending on its use, a METS document could be used in the role of [[Submission Information Package]] (SIP), Archival Information Package (AIP), or Dissemination Information Package (DIP) within the Open Archival Information System ([[OAIS]]) Reference Model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems|title=Space Data and Information Transfer System -- Open Archival Information System -- Reference Model (ISO 14721:2012)|date=2012|publisher=International Organization for Standardization|location=Geneva|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=57284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital libraries vs traditional libraries===
Maintaining a library of digital objects requires maintaining metadata about those objects. The metadata necessary for successful management and use of digital objects is both more extensive than and different from the metadata used for managing collections of printed works and other physical materials. METS is intended to promote the preservation of, and interoperability between digital libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McDonough|first=Jerome|date=April 2006 |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2142/177 |title=METS: Standardized Encoding for Digital Library Objects|journal=International Journal on Digital Libraries |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=148–158 }} Available as a [https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/177/METS.pdf?sequence=2 PDF file] via ideals.illinois.edu.

* Where a '''traditional [[library]]''' may record descriptive metadata regarding a book in its collection, the book will not dissolve into a series of unconnected pages if the library fails to record structural metadata regarding the book's organization, nor will scholars be unable to evaluate the book's worth if the library fails to note, for example, that the book was produced using a [[Ryobi offset press]].
* The same cannot be said for a '''digital library'''. Without structural metadata, the page image or text files comprising the digital work are of little use, and without technical metadata regarding the digitization process, scholars may be unsure of how accurate a reflection of the original the digital version provides. 
* However, in a digital library it is possible to create an eBook-like PDF file or TIFF file which can be seen as a single physical book and reflect the integrity of the original.

===Flexibility and interoperability===
The open flexibility of METS means that there is not a prescribed vocabulary which allows many different types of institutions, with many different document types, to utilize METS. The customization of METS makes it highly functional internally, but creates limitations for interoperability. Interoperability becomes difficult when the exporting and importing institutions have used vocabularies. As a workaround for this problem the creation of institutional profiles has become popular. These profiles document the implementation of METS specific to that institution helping to map content in order for exchanged METS documents to be more usable across institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pearce|first=J.|author2=Pearson, D. |author3=Williams, M. |author4=Yeadon, S. |title=The Australian METS Profile – A journey about metadata.|journal=D-Lib Magazine|date=2008|volume=14|issue=3/4|url=http://www.dlib.org/dlib/march08/pearce/03pearce.html|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wagner|first=Lindsey|title=METS: A Survey of Recent Literature and Applications|journal=Library Philosophy and Practice|date=2011|volume=2011|series=ISSN 1522-0222|url=http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~mbolin/wagner.htm|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
As early as 1996 the [[University of California, Berkeley]] began working toward the development of a system that combined encoding for an outline of a digital object's structure with metadata for that object. In 1998 this work was expanded upon by the Making of America II project (MoAII). An important objective of this project was the creation of a standard for digital objects that would include defined metadata for the descriptive, administrative, and structural aspects of a digital object. A type of structural and metadata encoding system using an XML [[Document Type Definition]] (DTD) was the result of these efforts. The MoAII DTD was limited in that it did not provide flexibility in which metadata terms could be used for the elements in the descriptive, administrative, and structural metadata portions of the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McDonough|first=Jerome|date=April 2006 |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2142/177 |title=METS: Standardized Encoding for Digital Library Objects|journal=International Journal on Digital Libraries |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=148–158 }} Available as a [https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/177/METS.pdf?sequence=2 PDF file] via ideals.illinois.edu. PDF p. 2. Retrieved 17 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, a new version of the DTD was developed that used [[namespaces]] separate from the system rather than the vocabulary of the previous DTD. This revision was the foundation for the current METS schema, officially named in April of that year.&lt;ref&gt;Cundiff, M. V. (2004). An introduction to the metadata encoding and transmission standard (METS). ''Library Hi Tech, 22''

==Characteristics==
[[File:PARTSangles.jpg |thumb|upright=1.1 |Sections of a METS document]]
Any METS document has the following features:
* An open standard (non-proprietary)
* Developed by the library community
* Relatively simple
* Extensible
* Modular

==The 7 sections of a METS document==
* '''METS header''' metsHdr: the METS document itself, such as its creator, editor, etc.
* '''Descriptive Metadata''' dmdSec: May contain internally embedded metadata or point to metadata external to the METS document. Multiple instances of both internal and external descriptive metadata may be included.
* '''Administrative Metadata''' amdSec: Provides information regarding how files were created and stored, intellectual property rights, metadata regarding the original source object from which the digital library object derives, and information regarding the provenance of files comprising the digital library object (such as master/derivative relationships, migrations, and transformations). As with descriptive metadata, administrative metadata may be internally encoded or external to the METS document.
* '''File Section''' fileSec: Lists all files containing content which comprise the electronic versions of the digital object. &lt;tt&gt;file&lt;/tt&gt; elements may be grouped within &lt;tt&gt;fileGrp&lt;/tt&gt; elements to subdivide files by object version. Although this section is not required, it is typically included in most METS documents as it adds a level of functionality to the structure of the document.
* '''Structural Map''' structMap: Outlines a hierarchical structure for the digital library object, and links the elements of that structure to associated content files and metadata. The Structural Map is the only section required for all METS documents.
* '''Structural Links''' structLink: Allows METS creators to record the existence of hyperlinks between nodes in the Structural Map. This is of particular value in using METS to archive Websites.
* '''Behavioral''' behaviorSec: Used to associate executable behaviors with content in the METS object. Each behavior has a mechanism element identifying a module of executable code that implements behaviors defined abstractly by its interface definition.

==METS profiles==
A profile is expressed as an XML document. There is a schema for this purpose. The profile expresses the requirements that a METS document must satisfy.
A sufficiently explicit METS Profile may be considered a ''data standard''.

===METS profiles in use===
* Musical Score (may be a score, score and parts, or a set of parts only)
* Print Material (books, pamphlets, etc.)
* Music Manuscript (score or sketches)
* Recorded Event (audio or video)
* [[PDF]] Document
* Bibliographic Record
* Photograph
* Compact Disc
* Collection

{{Ecommerce}}
The phrase '''mobile commerce''' was originally coined in 1997 by Kevin Duffey at the launch of the Global Mobile Commerce Forum, to mean "the delivery of [[electronic commerce]] capabilities directly into the consumer’s hand, anywhere, via [[wireless]] technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cryptome.org/jya/glomob.htm|title=Global Mobile Commerce Forum|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many choose to think of Mobile Commerce as meaning "a retail outlet in your customer’s pocket."

[[Mobile device|Mobile]] commerce is worth [[Orders of magnitude (currency)|US$230 billion]], with Asia representing almost half of the market, and has been forecast to reach US$700 billion in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.techinasia.com/digi-capital-reports-asia-as-dominant-player-mcommerce-industry-insights/|title= Asia is dominating the mCommerce market, puts US and Europe to shame|first= Leighton|last= Cosseboom|date= 5 September 2014|accessdate= 9 September 2014|work= Tech In Asia}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to BI Intelligence&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mobilepaymentstoday.com/article/205853/Report-Why-mobile-commerce-is-set-to-explode |title=Archived copy |access-date=9 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107040001/http://www.mobilepaymentstoday.com/article/205853/Report-Why-mobile-commerce-is-set-to-explode |archive-date=7 January 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in January 2013, 29% of mobile users have now made a purchase with their phones. Walmart estimated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetretailer.com/2012/11/12/40-wal-marts-holiday-web-traffic-will-be-mobile|title=Mobile chief predicts 40% of Wal-Mart’s holiday web traffic will be mobile|first=Bill|last=Siwicki|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that 40% of all visits to their internet shopping site in December 2012 was from a [[mobile device]].  [[Bank of America]] predicts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/bii-report-why-mobile-commerce-is-set-to-explode-2013-1|title=BII REPORT: Why Mobile Commerce Is Set To Explode|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; $67.1 billion in purchases will be made from mobile devices by European and U.S. shoppers in 2015. m-Commerce made up 11.6 per cent of total e-commerce spending in 2014, and is forecast to increase to 45 per cent by 2020, according to [http://www.banklesstimes.com/2017/02/14/mobile-commerce-is-the-trend-for-2017/ BI Intelligence]. ComScore [http://www.retaildive.com/news/comscore-holiday-spending-topped-80b-driven-by-mobile-commerce-growth/436106/ reported] in February 2017 that mobile commerce had grown 45% in year to December 2016.

== History ==
The Global Mobile Commerce Forum, which came to include over 100 organisations, had its fully minuted launch in London on 10 November 1997. Kevin Duffey was elected as the Executive Chairman at the first meeting in November 1997.  The meeting was opened by Dr. Mike Short, former chairman of the [[GSM]] Association, with the very first forecasts for mobile commerce from Kevin Duffey (Group Telecoms Director of [[Logica]]) and Tom Alexander (later CEO of [[Virgin Mobile]] and then of Orange). Over 100 companies joined the Forum within a year, many forming mobile commerce teams of their own, e.g. MasterCard and Motorola. Of these one hundred companies, the first two were Logica and [[Cellnet]] (which later became O2).  Member organisations such as [[Nokia]], Apple, [[Alcatel (mobile device brand)|Alcatel]], and [[Vodafone]] began a series of trials and collaborations.

Mobile commerce services were first delivered in 1997, when the first two mobile-phone enabled [[Coca-Cola]] vending machines were installed in the [[Helsinki]] area in [[Finland]]. The machines accepted payment via [[SMS]] text messages. This work evolved to several new mobile applications such as the first mobile phone-based banking service was launched in 1997 by [[Merita Bank|Merita Bank of Finland]], also using SMS.  [[Finnair]] mobile check-in was also a major milestone, first introduced in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ahonen |first1=Tomi |title=Update on the mobile phone check-in: Finnair finds half of passengers using it |url=http://communities-dominate.blogs.com/brands/2009/02/update-on-the-mobile-phone-checkin-finnair-finds-half-of-passengers-using-it.html |website=Communities Dominate Brands |date=5 February 2009 |accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The m-Commerce(tm) server developed in late 1997 by Kevin Duffey and Andrew Tobin at Logica won the 1998 [[Financial Times]] award for "most innovative mobile product," in a solution implemented with De La Rue, Motorola and Logica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/de-la-rue-motorola-and-logica-win-financial-times-award-for-most-innovative-mobile-product-156092345.html|title=DE LA RUE, MOTOROLA AND LOGICA WIN FINANCIAL TIMES AWARD FOR MOST INNOVATIVE MOBILE PRODUCT /PR Newswire UK/|first=|last=Logica|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Financial Times commended the solution for "turning mobile commerce into a reality."{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}  The trademark for m-Commerce was filed on 7 April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trademarkia.co.uk/uk/mcommerce-56494.htm|title=M-COMMERCE - Reviews &amp; Brand Information  - Logica Plc 250 Brook Drive  Green Park, Reading  GB RG2 6UA in European Community (CTM)|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150823025335/http://www.trademarkia.co.uk/uk/mcommerce-56494.htm|archivedate=23 August 2015|df=dmy-all}} &lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the first sales of digital content as downloads to mobile phones were made possible when the first commercial downloadable [[ringtone]]s were launched in Finland by [[Radiolinja]] (now part of [[Elisa Oyj]]).

Two major national commercial platforms for mobile commerce were launched in 1999: Smart Money in the [[Philippines]], and [[NTT DoCoMo]]'s [[i-Mode]] Internet service in [[Japan]]. i-Mode offered a revenue-sharing plan where NTT DoCoMo kept 9 percent of the fee users paid for content, and returned 91 percent to the content owner.

Mobile-commerce-related services spread rapidly in early 2000. [[Norway]] launched mobile parking payments. [[Austria]] offered train ticketing via mobile device. [[Japan]] offered mobile purchases of airline tickets.

In April 2002, building on the work of the Global Mobile Commerce Forum (GMCF), the [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]] (ETSI) appointed Joachim Hoffmann of Motorola to develop official standards for mobile commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.etsi.org/m-comm/summary.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403000010/http://portal.etsi.org/m-comm/summary.asp |archivedate=3 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;  In appointing Mr Hoffman, ETSI quoted industry analysts as predicting "that m-commerce is poised for such an exponential growth over the next few years that could reach US$200 billion by 2004".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.etsi.org/m-comm/m-comm_ToR.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303231310/http://portal.etsi.org/m-comm/m-comm_ToR.asp |archivedate=3 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2008, UCL Computer Science and [[Peter J. Bentley]] demonstrated the potential for medical applications on mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.peterjbentley.com/Blog/?e=53483&amp;d=08/29/2010&amp;s=iStethoscope%20Pro%20in%20a%20medical%20journal|title=iStethoscope in Medical Journal|accessdate=November 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[PDA]]s and [[cellular phone]]s have become so popular that many businesses{{Specify|date=August 2010}} are beginning to use mobile commerce as a more efficient way to communicate with their customers.

In order to exploit the potential mobile commerce market, mobile phone manufacturers such as Nokia, Ericsson, Motorola, and [[Qualcomm]] are working with carriers such as AT&amp;T Wireless and Sprint to develop [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]]-enabled smartphones. Smartphones offer fax, e-mail, and phone capabilities.

"[[Profitability]] for device vendors and carriers hinges on high-end mobile devices and the accompanying killer applications," said Burchett.{{Who|date=August 2010}} Perennial early adopters, such as the youth market, which are the least price sensitive, as well as more open to premium mobile content and applications, must also be a key target for device vendors.

Since the launch of the [[iPhone]] in 2007, mobile commerce has moved away from SMS systems and into actual applications.  SMS has significant [[security vulnerabilities]]  and congestion problems, even though it is widely available and accessible. In addition, improvements in the capabilities of modern mobile devices make it prudent to place more of the resource burden on the mobile device.

More recently, [[brick and mortar business]] owners, and [[big-box store|big-box retailers]] in particular, have made an effort to take advantage of mobile commerce by utilizing a number of mobile capabilities such as [[location-based service]]s, [[Barcode reader#Cell phone cameras|barcode scanning]], and [[Apple Push Notification Service|push notifications]]  to improve the customer experience of shopping in physical stores. By creating what is referred to as a 'bricks &amp; clicks' environment, physical retailers can allow customers to access the common benefits of shopping online (such as product reviews, information, and coupons) while still shopping in the physical store. This is seen as a bridge between the gap created by e-commerce and in-store shopping, and is being utilized by physical retailers as a way to compete with the lower prices typically seen through online retailers. By mid summer 2013, "omnichannel" retailers (those with significant e-commerce and in-store sales) were seeing between 25% and 30% of traffic to their online properties originating from mobile devices. Some other pure play/online-only retail sites (especially those in the travel category) as well as flash sales sites and deal sites were seeing between 40% and 50% of traffic (and sometimes significantly more) originate from mobile devices.

The Google Wallet Mobile App&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/follow/topics/google-wallet/|title=Google Wallet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; launched in September 2011 and the m-Commerce joint venture formed in June 2011 between Vodafone, O2, Orange and T-Mobile are recent developments of note.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mobiletoday.co.uk/News/11829/Everything_Everywhere__O2_and_Vodafone_form_m-commerce_joint_venture.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting the importance of m-Commerce, in April 2012 the Competition Commissioner of the European Commission ordered an in-depth investigation of the m-Commerce joint venture between Vodafone, O2, Orange and T-Mobile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobilenewscwp.co.uk/2012/04/16/vodafone-everything-everywhere-and-o2-still-confident-on-m-commerce-jv/|title=Vodafone, EE and O2 still confident on m-commerce JV|first=Mobile|last=News|date=16 April 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent survey states that 2012, 41% of smartphone customers have purchased retail products with their mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercuryminds.com/blog/company_news/introducing-mobile-commerce-solutions-for-online-retailers|title=Introducing Mobile Commerce solutions for online-retailers|accessdate=April 5, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330115537/http://www.mercuryminds.com/blog/company_news/introducing-mobile-commerce-solutions-for-online-retailers|archivedate=30 March 2013|df=dmy-all}} &lt;/ref&gt;

== Products and services available ==

===Mobile money transfer===
In [[Kenya]] money transfer is mainly done through the use of mobile phones. This was an initiative of a multimillion shillings company in Kenya named Safaricom. Currently, the companies involved are Safaricom and Airtel. Mobile [[money transmitter|money transfer services]] in Kenya are now provided by the two companies under the names M-PESA and Airtel Money respectively.

A similar system called [[MobilePay]] has been operated by [[Danske Bank]] in [[Denmark]] since 2013. It has gained considerable popularity with about 1.6 million users by mid-2015. Another similar system called [[Vipps]] was introduced in [[Norway]] in 2015.

Mobile automated teller machine (ATM) is a special type of ATM. Most ATMs are meant to be stationary, and they’re often found attached to the side of financial institutions, in stores, and in malls. A mobile ATM machine, on the other hand, is meant to be moved from location to location. This type of ATM is often found at special events for which ATM service is only needed temporarily. For example, they may be found at carnivals, fairs, and parades. They may also be used at seminars and workshops when there is no regular ATM nearby.

Mobile ATMs are usually self-contained units that don’t need a building or enclosure. Usually, a mobile ATM can be placed in just about any location and can transmit transaction information wirelessly, so there's no need to have a phone line handy. Mobile ATMs may, however, require access to an electrical source, though there are some capable of running on alternative sources of power. Often, these units are constructed of weather-resistant materials, so they can be used in practically any type of weather conditions. Additionally, these machines typically have internal heating and air conditioning units that help keep them functional despite the temperature of the environment.ion of mobile money services for the unbanked, operators are now looking for efficient ways to roll out and manage distribution networks that can support cash-in and cash-out. Unlike traditional ATM, [[sicap]] Mobile ATM have been specially engineered to connect to mobile money platforms and provide bank grade ATM quality.
In Hungary, Vodafone allows cash or bank card payments of monthly phone bills.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vodafone.hu/eng/support/questions-answers/pay-monthly/paying-your-bill&lt;/ref&gt; The Hungarian market is one where direct debits are not standard practice, so the facility eases the burden of queuing for the postpaid half of Vodafone’s subscriber base in Hungary.

=== Mobile ticketing ===
{{Main article|Mobile ticketing}}

Tickets can be sent to mobile phones using a variety of technologies.  Users are then able to use their tickets immediately, by presenting their mobile phone at the ticket check as a digital boarding pass. Most numbers of users are now moving towards this technology. Best example would be [[IRCTC]] where ticket comes as SMS to users. New technology such as [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] can now be used to directly provide a single association digital ticket via the mobile device hardware associated with relevant software.

=== Mobile vouchers, coupons and loyalty cards ===
Mobile ticketing technology can also be used for the distribution of vouchers, coupons, and loyalty cards.  These items are represented by a virtual token that is sent to the mobile phone. A customer presenting a mobile phone with one of these tokens at the [[point of sale]] receives the same benefits as if they had the traditional token.  Stores may send coupons to customers using [[location-based service]]s to determine when the customer is nearby. Using a connected device and the networking effect can also allow for gamification within the shopping experience.

=== Content purchase and delivery ===
Currently, mobile content purchase and delivery mainly consist of the sale of ring-tones, wallpapers, and games for mobile phones.  The convergence of mobile phones, portable audio players, and video players into a single device is increasing the purchase and delivery of full-length music tracks and video. The download speeds available with [[4G]] networks make it possible to buy a movie on a mobile device in a couple of seconds.&lt;ref&gt;Niranjanamurthy, M., &amp; Kavyashree, N. (2013). Analysis of E-Commerce and M-Commerce: Advantages, Limitations, and Security issues. International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer and Communication Engineering, 2(6). 2360-2370&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Location-based services ===
{{Main article|Location-based service}}
The location of the mobile phone user is an important piece of information used during mobile commerce or m-commerce transactions.  Knowing the location of the user allows for [[location-based service]]s such as:
* Local discount offers
* Local weather
* Tracking and monitoring of people
* Data driven mashups targeting at a hyper-local level

=== Information services ===
A wide variety of information services can be delivered to mobile phone users in much the same way as it is delivered to PCs.  These services include:
* [[News]]
* [[Ticker tape|Stock quotes]]
* Sports scores
* Financial records
* [[Traffic reporting]]
* Emergency Alerts
* [[Location Based Notifications]]

Customized traffic information, based on a user's actual travel patterns, can be sent to a mobile device. This customized data is more useful than a generic traffic-report broadcast, but was impractical before the invention of modern mobile devices due to the [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] requirements.

=== Mobile banking ===
{{Main article|Mobile banking}}

Banks and other financial institutions use mobile commerce to allow their customers to access account information and make transactions, such as purchasing stocks, remitting money.  This service is often referred to as ''[[mobile banking]]'', or m-banking.

=== Mobile brokerage ===
Stock market services offered via mobile devices have also become more popular and are known as Mobile Brokerage.  They allow the subscriber to react to market developments in a timely fashion and irrespective of their physical location.

=== Auctions ===

Over the past three years{{When|date=August 2010}} [[mobile reverse auction]] solutions have grown in popularity.{{By whom|date=August 2010}} Unlike traditional auctions, the reverse auction (or low-bid auction) bills the consumer's phone each time they place a bid. Many mobile [[SMS]] commerce solutions rely on a one-time purchase or one-time subscription; however, reverse auctions offer a high return for the mobile vendor as they require the consumer to make multiple transactions over a long period of time.

=== Mobile browsing  ===
{{Main article|Mobile browser}}
Using a mobile browser—a [[World Wide Web]] browser on a mobile device—customers can shop online without having to be at their personal computer. Many [[mobile marketing]] apps with geo-location capability are now delivering user-specific marketing messages to the right person at the right time.

=== Mobile purchase ===
[[Catalog merchants]] can accept orders from customers electronically, via the customer's mobile device.  In some cases, the merchant may even deliver the catalog electronically, rather than mailing a paper catalog to the customer. Consumers making mobile purchases can also receive value-add [[upselling]] services and offers. Some merchants provide [[mobile web]] sites that are customized for the smaller screen and limited user interface of a mobile device.

===In-application mobile phone payments===

Payments can be made directly inside of an application running on a popular smartphone operating system, such as Google Android. Analyst firm Gartner expects in-application purchases to drive 41 percent of app store (also referred to as mobile software distribution platforms) revenue in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zdnet.com/in-app-payments-more-profitable-than-paid-apps-7000004110 |title=In-app payments more profitable than paid apps |work=ZDNet |accessdate=2013-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In-app purchases can be used to buy [[virtual goods]], new and other mobile content and is ultimately billed by mobile carriers rather than the app stores themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://paidcontent.org/2011/10/11/419-ericsson-enables-in-app-android-payments-via-carrier-bills |title=Ericsson Enables In-App Android Payments Via Carrier Bills |work=PaidContent |accessdate=2013-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ericsson’s IPX mobile commerce system is used by 120 mobile carriers to offer payment options such as try-before-you-buy, rentals and subscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fiercemobilecontent.com/story/ericsson-brings-carrier-billing-app-payments/2011-10-12 |title=Ericsson brings carrier billing to in-app payments |work=Fierce Mobile Content |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2013-01-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211040551/http://www.fiercemobilecontent.com/story/ericsson-brings-carrier-billing-app-payments/2011-10-12 |archivedate=11 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mobile marketing and advertising ===
{{Main article|Mobile marketing}}
In the context of mobile commerce, '''mobile marketing''' refers to marketing sent to mobile devices. Companies have reported that they see better response from mobile marketing campaigns than from traditional campaigns. The primary reason for this is the instant nature of customer decision-making that mobile apps and websites enable. The consumer can receive a marketing message or discount coupon and, within a few seconds, make a decision to buy and go on to complete the sale - without disrupting their current real-world activity.

For example, a busy mom tending to her household chores with a baby in her arm could receive a marketing message on her mobile about baby products from a local store. She can and within a few clicks, place an order for her supplies without having to plan ahead for it. No more need to reach for her purse and hunt for credit cards, no need to log into her laptop and try to recall the web address of the store she visited last week, and surely no need to find a babysitter to cover for her while she runs to the local store.

Research demonstrates that consumers of mobile and wireline markets represent two distinct groups who are driven by different values and behaviors, and who exhibit dissimilar psychographic and demographic profiles.&lt;ref&gt;Schejter, A., Serenko, A., Turel, O., and Zahaf, M. (2010) "[http://www.aserenko.com/papers/policy_implications_serenko_proof.pdf Policy implications of market segmentation as a determinant of fixed-mobile service substitution: What it means for carriers and policy makers]", Telematics and Informatics, 27(1), 90-102.&lt;/ref&gt; What aspects truly distinguish between a traditional online shopper from home and a mobile on-the-go shopper? Research shows that how individuals relate to four situational dimensions- place, time, social context and control determine to what extent they are ubiquitous or situated as consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Banerjee, Syagnik (Sy) and Dholakia, Ruby Roy, "Situated or Ubiquitous? A Segmentation of Mobile E-Shoppers" (January 4, 2013). International Journal of Mobile Communications, Forthcoming. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2196689&lt;/ref&gt; These factors are important in triggering m-commerce from e-commerce. As a result, successful mobile commerce requires the development of marketing campaigns targeted to these particular dimensions and according to user segments.

==Influence on youth markets{{Anchor|Mobile Commerce's Influence on Youth Markets}}==

Mobile media is a rapidly changing field. New technologies, such as [[WiMax]], act to accelerate innovation in mobile commerce. Early pioneers in mobile advertising include [[Vodafone]], [[Orange (telecommunications)|Orange]], and [[SK Telecom]].

Mobile devices are heavily used in South Korea to conduct mobile commerce. Mobile companies in South Korea believed that mobile technology would become synonymous with youth lifestyle, based on their experience with previous generations of South Koreans. "Profitability for device vendors and carriers hinges on high-end mobile devices and the accompanying killer applications," said Daniel Longfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frost.com/prod/servlet/press-release.pag?docid=72554850 |title=Mobile Device Vendors Turn to Growth Opportunities in Emerging Markets to Combat Fall in Average Price per Unit |last=Castilla |first=Mireya |date=June 16, 2006 |website=Frost &amp; Sullivan |access-date=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Payment methods ==
{{Main article|Mobile payment}}
Consumers can use many forms of payment in mobile commerce, including:
* [[Contactless payment]] for in-person transactions through a mobile phone (such as [[Apple Pay]] or [[Android Pay]]).  In a system like [[EMV]], these are interoperable with contactless credit and debit cards.
* [[Premium-rate telephone number]]s, which apply charges to the consumer's long-distance bill
* Mobile-Operator Billing allows charges to be added to the consumer's mobile telephone bill, including deductions to pre-paid calling plans
* [[Credit card]]s and [[debit card]]s 
** Some providers allow credit cards to be stored in a phone's [[SIM card]] or secure element
** Some providers are starting to use [[host card emulation]], or HCE (e.g. [[Google Wallet]] and [[Softcard]])
** Some providers store [[credit card]] or [[debit card]] information in the cloud; usually in [[Tokenization (data security)|tokenized]].  With tokenization, payment verification, authentication, and authorization are still required, but payment card numbers don't need to be stored, entered, or transmitted from the mobile device
* [[Micropayment]] services
* [[Stored-value card]]s, often used with mobile-device application stores or music stores (e.g. iTunes)

== App design ==
[[Interaction design]] and [[User interface design|UX design]] has been at the core of the m-commerce experience from its conception, producing apps and mobile web pages that create highly usable interactions for users.&lt;ref&gt;Preece, J., Rogers, Y. and Sharpe, H. (2011), ''Interaction Design: Beyond Human-Computer Interaction'', Fourth., John Wiley &amp; Sons, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; However, much debate has occurred as to the focus that should be given to the apps. In recent research, Parker and Wang&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Christopher J.|last2=Wang|first2=Huchen|title=Examining hedonic and utilitarian motivations for m-commerce fashion retail app engagement|journal=Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management: An International Journal|date=12 September 2016|volume=20|issue=4|pages=487–506|doi=10.1108/JFMM-02-2016-0015|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JFMM-02-2016-0015|accessdate=11 November 2016}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that within [[fashion]] m-Commerce apps, the degree that the app helps the user shop (increasing convenience) was the most prominent function. Such use examples may be through design cues which help the user find their products with minimal search.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parker|first1=Christopher J.|last2=Henninger|first2=Claudia E.|title=Enabling Sustainable Behaviours Through M-Commerce App Design: Focus on The Fast Fashion Industry|date=2018|publisher=Greenleaf Publishing|location=Sheffield|isbn=9781351058346|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=-31aDwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PT89&amp;ots=c7LvxGu_Tl&amp;sig=2_ehssAPK46LlyrjiNdwSp9RSuo#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Additionally, shopping for others was a motivator for engaging in m-commerce apps with great preference for close integration with [[social media]].

== App commerce ==

The popularity of apps has given rise to the latest iteration of mobile commerce: app commerce. This refers to retail transactions that take place on a native mobile app. App commerce is said to perform better than both desktop and mobile web when it comes to browsing duration and interactions.&lt;ref name="MicrosoftBizBlog"&gt;[https://blogs.business.microsoft.com/en-gb/2017/08/01/rising-challenge-mobile-retail/ Microsoft UK Small and Medium Business Blog | Rising to the challenge of mobile in retail]&lt;/ref&gt; Average order value is reportedly greater with retail apps than traditional ecommerce, and conversion rates on apps are twice that of mobile websites.&lt;ref name="MicrosoftBizBlog" /&gt;

'''NCL Eclipse''' is a plugin for [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse IDE]] aiming at supporting the development of [[Nested Context Language]] applications. NCL is the declarative standard language for [[ISDB-T International|ISDB-Tb]] (International System for Digital Broadcast Terrestrial Brazilian) and also is [[ITU-T]] standard for [[IPTV]] systems. NCL Eclipse was first developed by [http://laws.deinf.ufma.br Laws Lab] and it is currently jointly maintained by [http://laws.deinf.ufma.br  Laws] and [http://www.telemidia.puc-rio.br  TeleMídia] Labs.

''NCL Eclipse'' is free software, available at [http://www.softwarepublico.gov.br/ Brazilian Public Software Portal] under [[GPL#Version 2|GNU GPLv2]] license.

As an [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse IDE]] plug-in NCL Eclipse can be easily integrated with others plug-ins---for instance, those supporting other ISDB-Tb and ITU-T standard languages (such as [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]]).

==NCL Eclipse Historical Evolution==

===NCL Eclipse 1.0 ===
The first stable version of NCL Eclipse was named "NCL Eclipse 1.0". This version has included support to syntax highlighting, folding (which allows the author to hide parts of source code according with his needs), wizards to create simple documents, auto-formatting, document, marking error validation, contextual content suggestion and an outline view (which shows the document content as a tree). To provide the marking error validation, all NCL Eclipse versions uses the [[NCL Validator]] (validation framework of NCL documents). This first version was very well accepted by the community of NCL developers, which gave several feedbacks. The NCL Eclipse evolution is strongly based on these feedbacks.

===NCL Eclipse 1.4 ===
The NCL Eclipse 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 have focused mainly on fixing bugs from the previous version. The next big changes came with 1.4 version of NCL Eclipse. That version brings program visualization, media previews and hypertext navigation. Additionally, a new plug-in aimed to integrate NCL Eclipse with NCL Club was included in the same package. As pointed out before, the integration with NCL Club allows for beginners to start learning NCL based on real-world examples. The internationalization support for English, Spanish and Portuguese was also included in this version.

===NCL Eclipse 1.5 ===
The latest stable, and current version, is "NCL Eclipse 1.5". This version contains some improvements in source code. As new feature, this version came with support to semi-automatic error correction and option to run the NCL document, provided by a virtual machine running the Ginga-NCL emulator.

The '''Nano electrokinetic thruster''' is a theoretical space propulsion system based on the principle of [[electro-osmosis]] (also electroosmotic flow). It allows for a high [[specific impulse]] and high [[thrust]]-to-power ratio as well as a high final velocity which makes it suitable for a wide variety of applications. Due to difficulties in the production of the needed [[carbon nanotubes]] experimental testing has not yet started.&lt;ref name=ref2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diez|first1=F.J.|last2=Hernaiz|first2=G.|last3=Miranda|first3=J.J.|last4=Sureda|first4=M.|title=On the capabilities of nano electrokinetic thrusters for space propulsion|journal=Acta Astronautica|date=February–March 2013|volume=83|doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2012.09.020|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576512003773|accessdate=11 November 2014|bibcode=2013AcAau..83...97D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The principle of electro-osmosis or electroosmotic flow creates a flow of an [[electrolyte]] through a very small tube in the nano-meter range. To achieve this flow there is a [[cathode]] and an [[anode]] at the ends of the tube over which a voltage is applied. Due to this voltage the ions in the electrolyte stored in a reservoir directly connected to the tube can be accelerated and ejected. This way [[electrical energy]] is transformed into [[kinetic energy]]. The amount of thrust created by one nano thruster is in the micro newton range, however due to its size it makes sense to arrange a big amount in an array to achieve sufficient thrust. The thrust, exit velocity of the [[ions]] and the [[mass flow rate]] of the electrolyte are influenced by the applied [[voltage]] which makes it easy to regulate those parameters. The applied voltage and the [[ph|pH-value]] of the electrolyte (amount of ions it contains) also vary the balance between thrust, efficiency and maximal exhaust velocity (determines the maximal achievable flight velocity). It is also theoretically possible to achieve a very high [[efficiency]] of nearly 100%&lt;ref name=patent&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garias|first1=Diez|title=ELECTROKINETIC NANOTHRUSTERS AND  APPLICATIONS THEREOF|url=http://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US20140070663.pdf|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a high specific impulse and high thrust-to-power ratio. This system has not yet been built and experimentally tested because of difficulties with the production of the nano-tubes needed for it.&lt;ref name=ref2 /&gt;

==Advantages==

Nano electrokinetic thrusters have a very high efficiency, specific impulse, exhaust velocity and thrust-to-power ratio which make them suitable for a wide variety of applications. Due to the fact that a thruster is made up out of an array of multiple nano thrusters it is easily possible to design thursters in all sizes and thrust ranges. These properties give the nano electrokinetic thrusters very good thrust control which makes it applicable for a wide range of spacecraft ranging from maneuvering thrusters for small spacecraft, such as satellites, to the primary propulsion system of interplanetary or interstellar spacecraft. This system also doesn't require additional [[Heat shield|heat]] or [[Radiation protection|radiation shielding]] to protect the rest of the space craft which make the system (not including fuel compartment) light in comparison to other designs.&lt;ref name=ref2 /&gt;

==Disadvantages==

The production of the required carbon nano tubes is very expensive and with current production methods the amount of surface defects in the produced carbon nano tubes is high which reduces the efficiency significantly and makes it unreliable. This design also requires a high potential difference in the range of 300 to 500 volts as well as a sufficient storage tank for the liquid electrolyte needed which increase the weight of the overall system.&lt;ref name=ref2 /&gt;

'''Normalization process theory''' ('''NPT''') is a derivative  [[sociological theory]] of the implementation, embedding, and integration of new technologies and organizational innovations developed originally from a collective set of learning workshops and included a large number of people including [[Carl R. May]], Tracy Finch, Elizabeth Murray, Anne Rogers, Catherine Pope, Anne Kennedy, Pauline Ong and . The theory is a contribution to the field of [[science and technology studies]] (STS), and is the result of a programme of theory building by May and a range of academics from applied social science to medicine.&lt;ref&gt;May CR, Mair F, Finch T, Macfarlane A, Dowrick C, Treweek S, Rapley T, Ballini L, Ong BN, Rogers A, Murray E, Elwyn G, Légaré F, Gunn J, Montori VM. Development of a theory of implementation and integration: normalization process theory. Implement Sci. 2009 May 21;4:29.&lt;/ref&gt; Through three iterations, the theory has built upon the [[normalization process model]] previously developed by May et al. to explain the social processes that lead to the routine embedding of innovative health technologies.&lt;ref&gt;May, C., 2006. A rational model for assessing and evaluating complex interventions in health care. BMC Health Services Research. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;May, C., et al., 2007. Understanding the implementation of complex interventions in health care: the normalization process model. BMC Health Services Research. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Normalization process theory focuses attention on agentic contributions – the things that individuals and groups do to operationalize new or modified modes of practice as they interact with dynamic elements of their environments. It defines the implementation, embedding, and integration as a process that occurs when participants deliberately initiate and seek to sustain a sequence of events that bring it into operation. The dynamics of implementation processes are complex, but normalization process theory facilitates understanding by focusing attention on the mechanisms through which participants invest and contribute to them. It reveals  "the work that actors do as they engage with some ensemble of activities (that may include new or changed ways of thinking, acting, and organizing) and by which means it becomes routinely embedded in the matrices of already existing, socially patterned, knowledge and practices".&lt;ref&gt;May, C., Finch, T., 2009. Implementation, embedding, and integration: an outline of Normalization Process Theory. Sociology. 43(3), 535-554.&lt;/ref&gt;  These have explored objects, agents, and contexts. In a paper published under a [[creative commons license]], May and colleagues describe how, since 2006, NPT has undergone three iterations.&lt;ref&gt;May, C., Sibley, A. and Hunt, K. (2014) 'The nursing work of hospital-based clinical practice guideline implementation: An explanatory systematic review using Normalisation Process Theory', International Journal of Nursing Studies, 51(2), 289-299&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Objects''. The first iteration of the theory focused attention on the relationship between the properties of a complex healthcare intervention and the collective action of its users. Here, agents' contributions are made in reciprocal relationship with the emergent capability that they find in the objects – the ensembles of behavioural and cognitive practices – that they enact. These socio-material capabilities are governed by the possibilities and constraints presented by objects, and the extent to which they can be made workable and integrated in practice as they are mobilized.&lt;ref&gt;May, C., 2006. A rational model for assessing and evaluating complex interventions in health care. BMC Health Services Research. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;May, C., et al., 2007. Understanding the implementation of complex interventions in health care: the normalization process model. BMC Health Services Research. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Agents''. The second iteration of the theory built on the analysis of collective action, and showed how this was linked to the mechanisms through which people make their activities meaningful and build commitments to them.&lt;ref&gt;May, C., Finch, T., 2009. Implementation, embedding, and integration: an outline of Normalization Process Theory. Sociology. 43, 535-554.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, investments of social structural and social cognitive resources are expressed as emergent contributions to social action through a set of generative mechanisms: coherence (what people do to make sense of objects, agency, and contexts); cognitive participation (what people do to initiate and be enrolled into delivering an ensemble of practices); collective action (what people do to enact those practices); and reflexive monitoring (what people do to appraise the consequences of their contributions). These constructs are the core of the theory, and provide the foundation of its analytic purchase on practice. 
* ''Contexts''. The third iteration of the theory developed the analysis of agentic contributions by offering an account of centrally important structural and cognitive resources on which agents draw as they take action.&lt;ref&gt;May, C., 2013. Towards a general theory of implementation. Implementation Science. 8, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, dynamic elements of social contexts are experienced by agents as capacity (the social structural resources, that they possess, including informational and material resources, and social norms and roles) and potential (the social cognitive resources that they possess, including knowledge and beliefs, and individual intentions and shared commitments). These resources are mobilized by agents when they invest in the ensembles of practices that are the objects of implementation.

Normalization process theory is regarded as a [[Middle range theory (sociology)|middle range theory]] that is located within the 'turn to materiality' in STS. It therefore fits well with the case-study oriented approach to empirical investigation used in STS. It also appears to be a straightforward alternative to [[actor–network theory]] in that it does not insist on the agency of non-human actors, and seeks to be explanatory rather than descriptive. However, because normalization process theory specifies a set of generative mechanisms that empirical investigation has shown to be relevant to implementation and integration of new technologies, it can also be used in larger scale structured and comparative studies. Although it fits well with the interpretive approach of [[ethnography]] and other [[qualitative research methods]],&lt;ref&gt;Gallacher K, May CR, Montori VM, Mair FS.  Understanding patients' experiences of treatment burden in chronic heart failure using normalization process theory.  Annals of Family Medicine 2011;14(4):351-360.&lt;/ref&gt; it also lends itself to [[systematic review]]&lt;ref&gt;Mair F, May C, O'Donnell C, Finch T, Sullivan F, Murray E.  Factors that promote or inhibit the implementation of e-health systems: an explanatory systematic review.  Bulletin of the World Health Organization 2012;90:357-364.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallacher K, Jani B, Morrison D, Macdonald S, Blane D, Erwin P, May CR, Montori VM, Eton DT, Smith F, Batty DG, Mair FS.  Qualitative systematic reviews of treatment burden in stroke, heart failure, and diabetes - Methodological challenges and solutions.  BMC Medical Research Methodology 2013;13(10).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Statistical survey|survey]] [[research methods]]. As a middle range theory, it can be federated with other theories to explain empirical phenomena. It is compatible with theories of the transmission and organization of innovations, especially [[diffusion of innovations]] theory, [[labor process theory]], and psychological theories including the [[theory of planned behavior]] and [[social learning theory]].

An '''orbital ring''' is a concept for a [[space elevator]] that consists of an artificial ring placed around the Earth that rotates at an angular rate that is faster than the rotation of the Earth. It is a giant formation of [[Astroengineering|astroengineering proportions]].

The structure is intended to be used as a [[space station]] or as a planetary [[vehicle]] for very high speed transportation or [[space launch]].

The original orbital ring concept is related to the [[space fountain]] and [[launch loop]].

==History==
{{Expand section|date=August 2009}}
In the 1870s [[Nikola Tesla]], while recovering from malaria, conceived a number of inventions including a ring around the equator, although he did not include detailed calculations.  As recounted in his autobiography ''[[My Inventions]]'' (1919):
{{quote|Another one of my projects was to construct a ring around the equator which would, of course, float freely and could be arrested in its spinning motion by reactionary forces, thus enabling travel at a rate of about one thousand miles an hour, impracticable by rail.  The reader will smile.  The plan was difficult of execution, I will admit, but not nearly so bad as that of a well-known New York professor, who wanted to pump the air from the torrid to the temperate zones, entirely forgetful of the fact that the Lord had provided a gigantic machine for this very purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Nikola Tesla, [http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/my_inventions.htm ''My Inventions'', part III: My Later Endeavors] (The gigantic machine he is referring to is better known as "air convection" and "weather").&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s novel ''[[The Fountains of Paradise]]'' (1979) is about [[space elevator]]s, but an appendix mentions the idea of launching objects off the Earth using a structure based on mass drivers. The idea apparently did not work, but this inspired further research.

[[Paul Birch (writer)|Paul Birch]] published a series of three articles in the ''[[Journal of the British Interplanetary Society]]'' in 1982.&lt;ref name="Birch1982-1"&gt;Paul Birch, "Orbital Ring Systems and Jacob's Ladders - I", ''Journal of the British Interplanetary Society'', Vol. 35, 1982, pp. 475–497. (see [http://www.orionsarm.com/fm_store/OrbitalRings-I.pdf pdf] (accessed 6 April 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Birch1982-2"&gt;Paul Birch, "Orbital Ring Systems and Jacob's Ladders - II", ''Journal of the British Interplanetary Society'', Vol. 36, 1982, 115. ([http://www.orionsarm.com/fm_store/OrbitalRings-II.pdf pdf]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Birch1982-3"&gt;Paul Birch, "Orbital Ring Systems and Jacob's Ladders - III", ''Journal of the British Interplanetary Society'', Vol. 36, 1982, 231. ([http://www.orionsarm.com/fm_store/OrbitalRings-III.pdf pdf]).&lt;/ref&gt;  Anatoly E. Yunitskiy, author of [[string transport]] idea, also published a similar idea in USSR in 1982&lt;ref name="Yunitskiy1982-1"&gt;Техника-молодежи» 1982 №&amp;nbsp;6, с.&amp;nbsp;34–36 – "Technical Youth" 1982 – [http://yunitskiy.com/author/1982/1982_02.pdf To the space by wheel] {{ru icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and later explored it in detail in his book published in 1995.&lt;ref name="Yunitskiy1995"&gt;Anatoly Yunitsky [http://www.yunitskiy.com/news/2011/news20110814.htm String transport systems: on Earth and in space]. Gomel, 1995 {{ru icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Meulenberg and his students, from 2008 to 2011, presented and published a number of papers based on types and applications of low-Earth-orbital rings as man's "stepping-stones-to-space". An overview &lt;ref&gt; A. Meulenberg and P. S. Karthik Balaji, "The LEO Archipelago: A system of earth-rings for communications, mass-transport to space, solar power, and control of global warming", Acta Astronautica 68, 2011, 1931–1946.&lt;/ref&gt; mentions four applications of orbital rings.

==Proposals==
Several different methods and designs have been suggested for the construction of an orbital ring.

===Birch's model===
A simple unsupported hoop about a planet is unstable: it would crash into the Earth if left unattended.&lt;ref&gt;Colin McInnes,  [http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/38/1/JIBS_C_McInnes_56_308.pdf "Nonlinear Dynamics of Ringworld Systems"], ''J. British Interplanetary Soc., Vol. 56 (2003). (Accessed 6 April 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carl A. Brannen, [http://www.brannenworks.com/GE253/ringworld.pdf "Niven Ring Gravitational Stability"] (Accessed 6 April 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; The orbital ring concept requires cables to the surface to stabilize it, with the outward centrifugal force providing tension on the cables, and the tethers stabilizing the ring.

In the simplest design of an orbital ring system, a rotating cable or possibly an [[inflatable space structures|inflatable space structure]] is placed in a [[low Earth orbit]] above the equator, rotating at faster than orbital speed. Not in orbit, but riding on this ring, supported electromagnetically on [[superconducting magnet]]s, are ring stations that stay in one place above some designated point on Earth. Hanging down from these ring stations are short space elevators made from cables with high-tensile-strength-to-mass-ratio materials.

Although this simple model would work best above the equator, Paul Birch calculated that since the ring station can be used to accelerate the orbital ring eastwards as well as hold the tether, it is therefore possible to deliberately cause the orbital ring to precess around the Earth instead of staying fixed in space while the Earth rotates beneath it. By precessing the ring once every 24 hours, the Orbital Ring will hover above any meridian selected on the surface of the Earth. The cables which dangle from the ring are now geostationary without having to reach geostationary altitude or without having to be placed into the equatorial plane. This means that using the Orbital Ring concept, one or many pairs of Stations can be positioned above ''any'' points on Earth desired or can be moved everywhere on the globe. Thus, any point on Earth can be served by a space elevator. Also a whole network of orbital rings can be built, which, by crossing over the poles, could cover the whole planet and be capable of taking over most of freight and passenger transport. By an array of elevators and several geostationary ring stations, asteroid or Moon material can be received and gently put down where land fills are needed. The electric energy generated in the process would pay for the system expansion and ultimately could pave the way for a solar-system-wide terraforming- and astroengineering-activity on a sound economical basis.

====Estimated cost====
If built by launching the necessary materials from Earth, the cost for the system estimated by Birch in 1980s money was around $31 billion (for a "bootstrap" system intended to expand to 1000 times its initial size over the following year, which would otherwise cost 31 trillion dollars) if launched using Shuttle-derived hardware, whereas it could fall to $15 billion with space-based manufacturing, assuming a large orbital manufacturing facility is available to provide the initial 180,000 tonnes of steel, aluminium, and slag at a low cost, and even lower with orbital rings around the Moon. The system's cost per kilogram to place payloads in orbit would be around $0.05.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120116134510/http://www.paulbirch.net/ "Orbital Ring Systems and Jacob's Ladders - I-III"].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yunitskiy's model===
[[File:Yunitskiy's Sky Ways.webm|thumb|thumbtime=23:21|340px|Yunitskiy's project of two orbital rings: the first ring is used as vehicle between Earth's surface and the second ring, which is used as a space station.]]
General Planetary Vehicle (GPV) - a Anatoly Yunitskiy's project&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPU6FGeZxWg To the sky by weel] Film about Anatoly Yunitskiy and his project&lt;/ref&gt; for the removal of weight at low circumplanet orbit. GPV is a ring located on the [[equator]] of the Earth (or parallel to the equator) consisting of individual segments connected (for example) by [[Hydraulic cylinder|hydraulic cylinders]]. Inside the ring segments there are cells for placing the payload and necessary equipment. The heart of the GPV consists of two circular channels passing through all the segments of the ring. High [[vacuum]] is kept up in the channels and they are completely isolated from the environment. Inside these channels there are two magnetically levitated [[flywheel]] rotors assembled from small metal and flexible (e.g., polymer) segments. The flywheel rotors are held by an electromagnetic system mounted inside the GPV shell, according to the principle of [[magnetic levitation]] and act as the rotors of the giant motor (capable of operating in a generator mode as well).

The GPV ring is located on a specially equipped overpass, encircling the Earth. In the initial condition it is fixed on the overpass.

With the help of an external energy source one of the rotors spins up to speed higher than the First Cosmic Velocity at sea level (i.e. [[Escape_velocity#From_an_orbiting_body | orbital speed at sea level, same as the escape velocity divided by root two]]). Due to the centrifugal force, the rotor (having reached the First Cosmic Velocity) balances itself and then seeks to "fly" up, producing lift force. The rotor's speed is to be a little more than necessary to balance the ring.

After releasing the clamp the GPV ring begins to rise up (increasing its radius, and accordingly, the diameter). Thus, the hydraulic cylinders and gaps between the segments allow the formation to increase its length. The belt rotor stretches by 2-5% due to its elasticity. Having achieved the required height the rotor transfers to the generator mode, and the electricity generated is used to boost the second rotor in the opposite direction. As a result, the GPV accelerates to achieve the First Cosmic Velocity on a low Earth orbit. The height reached by the GPV is determined by the abundant rotor’s initial kinetic energy and the capability of its body structure and rotors to stretch.

On the equatorial orbit the GPV is unloaded into stationary orbit cells located at the same orbital altitude in the plane of the equator.

Landing is carried out similarly in the reverse order.

==Types of orbital rings==
The simplest type would be a circular orbital ring in [[Low Earth orbit|LEO]].

Two other types were also defined by Paul Birch:
*Eccentric orbital ring systems – these are rings that are in the form of a closed shape with varying altitude
*Partial orbital ring systems&lt;ref name="Birch1982-1" /&gt; – this is essentially a [[launch loop]]

In addition, he proposed the concept of "supramundane worlds" such as supra-jovian and supra-stellar "planets". These are artificial planets that would be supported by a grid of orbital rings that would be positioned above a planet, supergiant or even a star.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Birch, "Supramundane Planets", ''Journal of the British interplanetary Society, Vol. 44,'' 1991, 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orbital rings in fiction==

The manga ''[[Battle Angel Alita]]'' prominently features a slightly deteriorated orbital ring.

The second iteration of the [[anime]] series ''[[Tekkaman Blade|Tekkaman]]'' features a complete ring, though abandoned and in disrepair due to war, and without surface tethers.

In the movie ''[[Starship Troopers (film)|Starship Troopers]]'', an orbital ring is shown encircling the Moon.

The [[anime]] series ''[[Kiddy Grade]]'' also uses orbital rings as a launch and docking bay for spaceships. These rings are connected to large towers extending from the planets surface.

The anime ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam 00]]'' also prominently features an orbital ring, which consists primarily of linked solar panels. The ring is connected to earth via three [[space elevator]]s. This ring effectively provides near unlimited power to earth. Later in the series the ring also shows space stations mounted on its surface.

Orbital rings are used extensively in the [[collaborative fiction]] worldbuilding website ''[[Orion's Arm]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/4851dd2124500 Space Fountains and Orbital Rings]&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur C. Clarke’s ''[[3001: The Final Odyssey]]'' features an orbital ring held aloft by four enormous inhabitable towers (assumed successors to space elevators) at the Equator.

In the close of Arthur C. Clarke's ''[[Fountains of Paradise]]'', a reference is made to an orbital ring that is attached in the distant future to the [[space elevator]] that is the basis of the novel.

The game ''[[X3 Terran Conflict]]'' features a free-floating orbital ring around the Earth, which is shattered by an explosion and subsequently de-orbited in ''[[X3: Albion Prelude]]''

In the [[Warhammer 40,000]] universe, [[Mars]] has a large orbital ring called the Ring of Steel. It is primarily used as a [[shipyard]] for interstellar craft. It is the largest man made structure in the galaxy.

In the game [[Xenoblade Chronicles 2]] there is a giant tree that has grown around the base of an Orbital Ring.

The third part of [[Neal Stephenson]]'s book [[Seveneves]] has an orbital ring around a moon-less earth.

'''Phanteks''' is a Dutch company which mainly produces [[PC case|PC cases]], fans and other case accessories. The company has a base in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phanteks.com/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Phanteks's first product was the PH-TC14PE, a [[CPU]] cooler, which gave the young company a good reputation right from the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/Phanteks/PH-TC14PE/7.html&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Phanteks started its case product line, beginning with the Enthoo Series.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phanteks.com/about-us.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current products==

The company has several different versions of the Enthoo series and a few of the Eclipse series.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phanteks.com/Enthoo-Series.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phanteks.com/Eclipse-Series.html&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, their cases' cooling solutions have been extended by more CPU coolers, fans and accessories.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phanteks.com/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Since the beginning of 2017, the company also produces liquid cooling blocks and fittings.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.techpowerup.com/230716/phanteks-also-announces-the-glacier-c350i-cpu-water-block&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.techpowerup.com/222955/phanteks-makes-its-foray-into-diy-liquid-cooling.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phanteks.com/Liquid-Cooling.html&lt;/ref&gt; One of their most recent computer cases, shown at [[Computex]] 2018, is the Evolv X. The Evolv X is the successor of the Evolv ATX; while similar to the original in design on the outside, the Evolv X has been redesigned from the inside out.&lt;ref&gt;https://wccftech.com/phanteks-displays-evolv-x-eclipse-p600s-and-next-generation-fans-at-computex-2018/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Serial Podcast.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Serial (podcast)|Serial]]'' podcast being played through an [[iPhone]]]]

A '''podcast''' or generically '''netcast''', is an [[episode|episodic]] series of [[digital media|digital]] [[Digital audio|audio]] or [[Digital video|video]] [[Computer file|files]] which a user can [[download]] in order to listen to. It is often available for subscription, so that new episodes are automatically [[download]]ed via [[web syndication]] to the user's own local computer, mobile application, or [[portable media player]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/podcast |title=Definition of Podcast |website=[[Merriam-Webster]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word was originally suggested by [[Ben Hammersley]] as a [[portmanteau]] of "[[iPod]]" (a brand of [[portable media player|media player]]) and "[[broadcast]]".&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/podcast |title=Definition of podcast in English |website=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=padding&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p038m811|title=The man who accidentally invented the word 'podcast' |last=Sawyer |first=Miranda |authorlink=Miranda Sawyer |date=November 20, 2015 |website=[[BBC Radio 4]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017|format=MP3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The files distributed are in audio format, but may sometimes include other file formats such as [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] or [[EPUB]]. Videos which are shared following a podcast model are sometimes called [[Podcast#Video podcasts|video podcasts]] or vodcasts.

The generator of a podcast maintains a central list of the files on a [[server (computing)|server]] as a [[web feed]] that can be accessed through the [[Internet]]. The listener or viewer uses special [[client (computing)|client]] [[application software|application]] [[software]] on a computer or media player, known as a [[List of podcatchers|podcatcher]], which accesses this web feed, checks it for updates, and downloads any new files in the series. This process can be automated to download new files automatically, which may seem to users as though new episodes are broadcast or "[[Push technology|pushed]]" to them. Files are stored locally on the user's device, ready for [[Online and offline|offline]] use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k1967&amp;pageid=icb.page23750 |title=Podcast Production |website=[[Harvard Graduate School of Education]] |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120710232048/http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k1967&amp;pageid=icb.page23750 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 10, 2012 |quote=...&amp;nbsp;This code enables specially designed software to locate and track new versions or episodes of a particular podcast&amp;nbsp;... |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different mobile applications available for people to use to subscribe and to listen to podcasts. Many of these applications allow users to download podcasts or to stream them on demand as an alternative to downloading. Many podcast players (apps as well as dedicated devices) allow listeners to skip around the podcast and control the playback speed.

Some have labeled podcasting as a [[Technological convergence|converged medium]] bringing together audio, [[World Wide Web|the web]], and [[portable media player]]s, as well as a [[Disruptive innovation|disruptive technology]] that has caused some individuals in the radio business to reconsider established practices and preconceptions about audiences, consumption, production, and distribution.&lt;ref name="Willipod"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Berry |first=Richard |date=May 1, 2006 |title=Will the iPod Kill the Radio Star?

Podcasts are usually free of charge to listeners and can often be created for little to no cost, which sets them apart from the traditional model of "[[Gatekeeper|gate-kept]]" media and production tools. Podcast creators can monetize their podcasts by allowing companies to purchase [[advertising|ad]] time, as well as via sites such as [[Patreon]], which provides special extras and content to listeners for a fee. Podcasting is very much a [[Horizontalidad|horizontal]] media&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freshminds.net/2011/07/horizontal-media-how-social-media-has-changed-journalism/ |title='Horizontal media' - how social media has changed journalism |last=Stratmann |first=Jo |date=July 20, 2011 |website=[[FreshMinds]] |accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; form – producers are consumers, consumers may become producers, and both can engage in conversations with each other.&lt;ref name="Willipod" /&gt;

==Name==
"Podcast" is a [[portmanteau]] word, formed by combining "[[iPod]]" and "[[Broadcasting|broadcast]]".&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt; The term "podcasting" as a name for the nascent technology was first suggested by [[The Guardian]] columnist and [[BBC]] journalist [[Ben Hammersley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/feb/12/broadcasting.digitalmedia |title=Why online radio is booming |last=Hammersley |first=Ben  |authorlink=Ben Hammersley |date=February 12, 2004 |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who invented it in early February 2004 while "[[wikt:pad out|padding out]]" an article for The Guardian newspaper.&lt;ref name= padding/&gt; Despite the etymology, the content can be accessed using any computer or similar device that can play media files. Use of the term "podcast" predated Apple's addition of formal support for podcasting to the iPod, or its [[iTunes]] software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4631051.stm |title=Apple brings podcasts into iTunes |date=June 28, 2005 |website=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other names for podcasting include "net cast", intended as a vendor-neutral term without the loose reference to the Apple iPod. This name is used by shows from the [[TWiT.tv]] network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.twit.tv/wiki/FAQ |title=FAQ - The Official TWiT Wiki |website=[[TWiT.tv]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources have also suggested the [[backronym]] "portable on demand" or "POD", for similar reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows-vista/create-your-own-podcast-what-you-need-to-know-to-be-a-podcaster |title=Create your own podcast: What you need to know to be a podcaster |website=[[Microsoft Windows]] |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225095312/http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows-vista/create-your-own-podcast-what-you-need-to-know-to-be-a-podcaster |archivedate=2015-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of podcasting}}

Former [[MTV]] [[VJ (media personality)|video jockey]] [[Adam Curry]], in collaboration with [[Dave Winer]] – co-author of the [[RSS]] specification – is credited with coming up with the idea to automate the delivery and syncing of textual content to portable audio players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/may/21/entertainment/ca-podfather21 |title='Podfather' plots a radio hit of his own |last=Miller |first=Martin |date=May 21, 2006 |website=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Origins"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.voices.com/resources/articles/podcasting/history-of-podcasting |title=The Origins of Podcasting |last=Ciccarelli |first=Stephanie |date=April 4, 2015 |website=[[Voices.com]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Podcasting History"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/basics/podcasting1.htm |title=How Podcasting Works § Podcasting History |last=Watson |first=Stephanie |date=March 26, 2005 |website=[[HowStuffWorks]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Podcasting, once an obscure method of spreading information, has become a recognized medium for distributing audio content, whether for corporate or personal use. Podcasts are similar to [[radio program]]s, but they are audio files. Listeners can play them at their convenience, using devices that have become more common than portable broadcast receivers.

The first application to make this process feasible was iPodderX, developed by August Trometer and Ray Slakinski.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redorbit.com/education/reference_library/technology_1/internet/1112804661/podcast/ |title=Podcast |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130630060559/http://www.redorbit.com/education/reference_library/technology_1/internet/1112804661/podcast/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 30, 2013 |website=redOrbit |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007, audio podcasts were doing what was historically accomplished via radio broadcasts, which had been the source of radio [[Talk radio|talk shows]] and [[All-news radio|news programs]] since the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Podcasting History" /&gt; This shift occurred as a result of the evolution of internet capabilities along with increased consumer access to cheaper hardware and software for audio recording and editing.

In October 2003, Matt Schichter launched his weekly chat show ''The BackStage Pass''. [[B.B. King]], [[Third Eye Blind]], [[Gavin DeGraw]], [[The Beach Boys]], and [[Jason Mraz]] were notable guests the first season. The hour long radio show was recorded live, transcoded to 16kbit/s audio for dial-up online streaming. Despite a lack of a commonly accepted identifying name for the medium at the time of its creation, ''The Backstage Pass'' which became known as ''Matt Schichter Interviews''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/matt-schichter-interviews/id1110551911?mt=2|title=Matt Schichter Interviews by Scared Goose Productions on Apple Podcasts|website=Apple Podcasts|language=en|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; is commonly believed to be the first podcast to be published online.

In August 2004, Adam Curry launched his show ''[[Daily Source Code]]''. It was a show focused on chronicling his everyday life, delivering news, and discussions about the development of podcasting, as well as promoting new and emerging podcasts. Curry published it in an attempt to gain traction in the development of what would come to be known as podcasting and as a means of testing the software outside of a lab setting. The name ''Daily Source Code'' was chosen in the hope that it would attract an audience with an interest in technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Geoghegan |first1=Michael W.|last2=Klass |first2=Dan |date=November 4, 2007 |title=Podcast Solutions: The Complete Guide to Audio and Video Podcasting |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WkAzn9TfL9gC&amp;lpg=PR2&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage |publisher=[[Apress]] |location=New York |isbn=978-1-59059-905-1 |page=4 |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Daily Source Code'' started at a grassroots level of production and was initially directed at podcast developers. As its audience became interested in the format, these developers were inspired to create and produce their own projects and, as a result, they improved the code used to create podcasts. As more people learned how easy it was to produce podcasts, a community of pioneer podcasters quickly appeared.&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt;

In June 2005, [[Apple Inc|Apple]] released [[iTunes]] 4.9 which added formal support for podcasts, thus negating the need to use a separate program in order to download and transfer them to a mobile device. While this made access to podcasts more convenient and widespread, it also effectively ended advancement of podcatchers by independent developers. Additionally, Apple issued [[cease and desist]] orders to many podcast application developers and service providers for using the term "iPod" or "Pod" in their products' names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2006/09/24/with-pod-on-lockdown-apple-goes-after-podcast/ |title=With "pod" on lockdown, Apple goes after "podcast" |last=Blass |first=Evan |date=September 24, 2006 |website=[[Engadget]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Podcasting icon.svg|thumb|The logo used by Apple to represent podcasting in its iTunes software.]]

Within a year, many podcasts from public radio networks like the [[BBC]], [[CBC Radio One]], [[NPR]], and [[Public Radio International]] placed many of their radio shows on the iTunes platform. In addition, major local radio stations like [[WNYC]] in New York City and [[WHYY-FM]] radio in Philadelphia, [[KCRW]] in Los Angeles placed their programs on their websites and later on the iTunes platform.

Concurrently, [[CNET]], ''[[This Week in Tech]]'', and later [[Bloomberg Radio]], the ''[[Financial Times]]'', and other for-profit companies provided podcast content, some using podcasting as their only distribution system.

===IP issues in trademark and patent law===
====Trademark applications====
Between February 10 and 25 March 2005, Shae Spencer Management, LLC of [[Fairport, New York]] filed a trademark application to register the term "podcast" for an "online prerecorded radio program over the internet". On September 9, 2005, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) rejected the application, citing [[Wikipedia]]'s podcast entry as describing the history of the term. The company amended their application in March 2006, but the USPTO rejected the amended application as not sufficiently differentiated from the original. In November 2006, the application was marked as abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=78564869&amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;searchType=documentSearch |title=Podcast trademark rejection documents |website=[[United States Patent and Trademark Office|USPTO]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 20, 2005, known trademarks that attempted to capitalize on podcast included: ePodcast, GodCast, GuidePod, MyPod, Pod-Casting, Podango, PodCabin, Podcast, Podcast Realty, Podcaster, PodcastPeople, Podgram PodKitchen, PodShop, and Podvertiser.&lt;ref name="Podcasting History" /&gt;

By February 2007, there had been 24 attempts to register trademarks containing the word "PODCAST" in the United States, but only "PODCAST READY" from ''Podcast Ready, Inc.'' was approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?state=4810:al4odh.4.1&amp;f=toc&amp;a_search=&amp;p_s_ALL=PODCAST |title=List of US podcast trademarks |website=[[United States Patent and Trademark Office|USPTO]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Apple trademark protections====
On September 26, 2004, it was reported that [[Apple Inc.]] had started to crack down on businesses using the string "POD", in product and company names. Apple sent a [[cease and desist]] letter that week to Podcast Ready, Inc., which markets an application known as "myPodder".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.podcastready.com/info.php?section=8&amp;page=41 |title=Podcast Ready Receives Cease &amp; Desist from Apple Computer |last=Holliman |first=Russell |date=September 26, 2006 |website=Podcast Ready |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005015828/http://www.podcastready.com/info.php?section=8&amp;page=41 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawyers for Apple contended that the term "pod" has been used by the public to refer to Apple's music player so extensively that it falls under Apple's trademark cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2343732,00.asp |title=Apple's Legal Team Going After 'Pod' People |last=Heater |first=Brian |date=March 24, 2009 |website=[[PC Magazine]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such activity was speculated to be part of a bigger campaign for Apple to expand the scope of its existing [[iPod]] trademark, which included trademarking "IPOD", "IPODCAST", and "POD".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2006/09/25/podcast-trademark-controversy/ |title=Podcast Trademark Controversy |last=Longo |first=Jeffrey |date=September 25, 2006 |website=[[MacRumors]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 16, 2006, the Apple Trademark Department stated that "Apple does not object to third-party usage of the generic term 'podcast' to accurately refer to podcasting services" and that "Apple does not license the term". However, no statement was made as to whether or not Apple believed they held rights to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/theglobalgeekpodcast/309396084/sizes/l/ |title=Copy of the letter from Apple Trademark Department |author=Global Geek Podcast |website=[[Flickr]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Personal Audio lawsuits====
[[Personal Audio LLC (patent holding company)|Personal Audio]], a company referred to as a "[[patent troll]]" by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]],&lt;ref name="EFF"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/05/help-save-podcasting |title=Help Save Podcasting! |last=Nazer |first=Daniel |date=May 30, 2013 |website=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; filed a patent on podcasting in 2009 for a claimed invention in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/patents/US8112504 |title=System for disseminating media content representing episodes in a serialized sequence |website=[[Google Patents]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013, Personal Audio started suing high-profile podcasters for royalties,&lt;ref name="EFF" /&gt; including ''[[The Adam Carolla Show (podcast)|The Adam Carolla Show]]'' and the ''[[HowStuffWorks]]'' podcast. US Congressman [[Peter DeFazio]]'s previously proposed "SHIELD Act" intended to curb patent trolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/02/podcasting-community-faces-patent-troll-threat-eff-wants-help |title=Podcasting Community Faces Patent Troll Threat; EFF Wants to Help |last=Samuels |first=Julie |date=February 5, 2013 |website=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017 |quote=Personal Audio is claiming that it owns a patent that covers podcasting technology.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013, the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] filed a petition with the US Trademark Office to invalidate the Personal Audio patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/cases/eff-v-personal-audio-llc |title=EFF v. Personal Audio LLC |website=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 18, 2014, the Electronic Frontier Foundation announced that Adam Carolla had settled with Personal Audio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/08/good-bad-and-ugly-adam-carollas-settlement-podcasting-troll |title=The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of Adam Carolla’s Settlement with the Podcasting Troll |last=Nazer |first=Daniel |date=August 18, 2014 |website=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 10, 2015, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office invalidated five provisions of Personal Audio's podcasting patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/04/10/how-the-government-just-protected-your-favorite-podcasts/ |title=How the government just protected some of your favorite podcasts |last=Fung |first=Brian |date=April 10, 2015 |website=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
===Enhanced podcasts===
An '''enhanced podcast''' can display images synchronized with audio. These can contain chapter markers, [[hyperlink]]s, and artwork, all of which is synced to a specific program or device. When an enhanced podcast is played within its specific program or device, all the appropriate information should be displayed at the same time and in the same window, making it easier to display materials.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Podcast novels===
A '''podcast novel''' (also known as a '''serialized audiobook''' or '''podcast audiobook''') is a [[Literature|literary]] format that combines the concepts of a podcast and an [[audiobook]]. Like a traditional [[novel]], a podcast novel is a work of long literary fiction; however, this form of the novel is recorded into episodes that are delivered online over a period of time and in the end available as a complete work for download. The episodes may be delivered automatically via [[RSS]], through a website, blog, or another syndication method. These files are either listened to directly on a user's computer or loaded onto a portable media device to be listened to later.

The types of novels that are podcasted vary from new works from new authors that have never been [[Printing|printed]],&lt;ref name="myb"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ki0pE7i7FM |title=Marketing your book in the internet age |author=Creative Choices |date=August 6, 2009 |website=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aftv"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/01/books/01podb.html |title=Authors Find Their Voice, and Audience, in Podcasts |last=Newman |first=Andrew Adam |date=March 1, 2007 |website=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to well-established authors that have been around for years,{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} to classic works of literature that have been in print for over a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4532526.stm |title=Christmas Carol gets free podcast |date=December 15, 2005 |website=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://librivox.org/short-story-collection-001/ |title=Short Story Collection Vol. 001 |website=[[LibriVox]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same style as an audiobook, podcast novels may be elaborately narrated with separate voice actors for each character and sound effects, similar to a [[Radio drama|radio play]]. Other podcast novels have a single narrator reading the text of the story with little or no sound effects.

Podcast novels are distributed over the [[Internet]], commonly on a [[Blog|weblog]]. Podcast novels are released in episodes on a regular schedule (e.g., once a week) or irregularly as each episode is released when completed. They can either be downloaded manually from a website or blog or be delivered automatically via [[RSS]] or another method of syndication.  Ultimately, a serialized podcast novel becomes a completed [[audiobook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1872381,00.html |title=Podcasting Your Novel: Publishing's Next Wave? |last=Florin |first=Hector |date=January 31, 2009 |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some podcast novelists give away a free podcast version of their book as a form of promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Take-my-book-It-s-free-3288454.php |title=Take my book. It's free |last=Cadelago |first=Chris |date=April 5, 2008 |website=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some such novelists have even secured publishing contracts to have their novels printed.&lt;ref name="myb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aftv" /&gt; Podcast novelists have commented that podcasting their novels lets them build audiences even if they cannot get a publisher to buy their books. These audiences then make it easier to secure a printing deal with a publisher at a later date. These podcast novelists also claim the exposure that releasing a free podcast gains them makes up for the fact that they are giving away their work for free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/09/05/free-really-can-make-you-money-a-dialogue-with-moses-siregar-iii/ |title="Free" Really Can Make You Money – A Dialogue With Moses Siregar III |last=Gaughran |first=David |date=September 5, 2011  |website=Let’s Get Digital |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video podcasts===
[[File:The Crab Nebula NASA.ogv|thumb|A video podcast on the [[Crab Nebula]] by [[NASA]]]]

A '''video podcast''' (sometimes shortened to "'''vodcast'''") includes [[video clip]]s. [[Web television]] series are often distributed as video podcasts.

''[[Dead End Days]]'' (2003–2004) is commonly believed to be the first video podcast. That serialized [[Black comedy|dark comedy]] about zombies was broadcast from 31 October 2003 through 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-video-podcast.htm |title=What is a Video Podcast? |website=wiseGEEK |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the spread of the [[Internet]] and the use of Internet broadband connection [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]], which helps to identify various applications, a faster connection to the Internet has been created and a wide amount of communication has been created. Video podcasts have become extremely popular online and are often presented as short video clips, usually excerpts of a longer recording. Video clips are being used on pre-established websites, and increasing numbers of websites are being created solely for the purpose of hosting video clips and podcasts. Video podcasts are being streamed on intranets and extranets, and private and public networks, and are taking communication through the Internet to new levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blog.inxpo.com/from-association-meetings-to-corporate-events-video-is-everywhere/ |title=From Association Meetings to Corporate Events, Video is Everywhere |last=Shiao |first=Dennis |date=March 17, 2011 |website=INXPO |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most video clips are now submitted and produced by individuals.{{Nonspecific|date=December 2012}} Video podcasts are also being used for web television, commonly referred to as Web TV, a rapidly growing genre of digital entertainment that uses various forms of [[new media]] to deliver to an audience both reruns of shows or series and content created or delivered originally online via broadband and mobile networks, web television shows, or web series. Examples include [[Amazon Video]], [[Hulu]], and [[Netflix]].  Other types of video podcasts used for web television may be short-form, anywhere from 2–9 minutes per episode, typically used for advertising, video blogs, amateur filming, journalism, and convergence with traditional media.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Video podcasting is also helping build businesses, especially in the sales and marketing sectors. Through video podcasts, businesses both large and small can advertise their wares and services in a modern, cost-effective way. In the past, big businesses had better access to expensive studios where sophisticated advertisements were produced, but now even the smallest businesses can create high-quality media with just a camera, editing software, and the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/basics/podcasting4.htm |title=How Podcasting Works § Video Podcasts |last=Watson |first=Stephanie |date=March 26, 2005 |website=[[HowStuffWorks]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a two-year study, 2012-2013, conducted by a South African university a question was raised; over the years of podcast development, is podcasting socially inclusive. The results of this study concluded with minor quarks, podcasting is socially inclusive.&lt;ref name="Golden Age"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Berry |first=Richard |date=November 2015 |title=A Golden Age of Podcasting? Evaluating Serial in the Context of Podcast Histories |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19376529.2015.1083363 |url-access=registration |journal=Journal of Radio &amp; Audio Media |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=170–178 |publisher=EBSCOhost |doi=10.1080/19376529.2015.1083363 |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oggcast===
An '''oggcast''' is a podcast recorded and distributed exclusively in the [[Vorbis]] audio codec with the [[Ogg]] [[Digital container format|container format]], and/or other similarly free codecs/formats.&lt;ref name="Djere"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://djere.com/node/183 |title=The Definition of An Oggcast |last=Djere |first=Rex |date=December 25, 2011 |website=Djere |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426072050/https://djere.com/node/183 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a podcast distributed both in the non-free [[MP3]] format and the free [[Ogg]] format would not technically meet the definition of an oggcast. In contrast, a podcast distributed in both the Vorbis and [[Speex]] codecs would meet the strict definition of an oggcast. The term oggcast is a combination of the word "ogg" from the term [[Ogg Vorbis]], and the syllable "cast", from "[[Broadcasting|broadcast]]".

The term was coined for the fifth season of the ''Gnu World Order'' by [[Klaatu (podcaster)|Klaatu]] in 2010, when the show declared itself "the world's first oggcast".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gnuworldorder.info/audiophile/archive/season5/index5.html |title=The Bad Apples - The World's First OGGcast! |website=Gnu World Order |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, the show was one of the few that released only in free formats, with no MP3 feed as an option. This gave way to other shows using the term, with hosts gathering in the {{Freenode|oggcastplanet}} [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] channel on the [[Freenode]] network to compare notes.

''[[The Linux Link Tech Show]]'', one of the longer running Linux podcasts still in production, has a program in the Ogg Vorbis format in its archives from January 7, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tlltsarchive.org/archives/tllts_14-01-07-04.ogg |title=The Linux Link Tech Show |last=Washko |first=Dann |last2=Fessenden |first2=Linc |date=January 7, 2004 |website=TLLTS Archive |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oggcasters tend to be broadcasters who prefer not to use audio and video codecs that have patent and/or licensing restrictions, such as the [[MP3]] codec.&lt;ref name="Djere" /&gt;

Recording and distributing podcasts in the Ogg Vorbis audio format has advantages. [[Mozilla]] [[Firefox]] and [[Google Chrome]] web browsers both support playing Vorbis files directly in the browser without requiring plugins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Mozilla-Firefox-3-1-on-It-039-s-Way-to-Setting-Web-Video-Standard-91432.shtml |title=Mozilla Firefox 3.1 on Its Way to Setting Web Video Standard |last=Constantin |first=Lucian |date=August 5, 2008 |website=[[Softpedia]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/google-chrome-gets-html-video-support/ |title=Google Chrome gets HTML video support |last=Shankland |first=Stephen |date=May 28, 2009 |website=[[CNET]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vorbis may produce better audio quality with a smaller file size than alternative codecs such as [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] or MP3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eskimo.com/~nanook/knowledge/oggvorbis.html |title=Ogg Vorbis - An Alternative to MP3 |website=Eskimo |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040202172710/http://www.eskimo.com/~nanook/knowledge/oggvorbis.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 2, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this has not been proven conclusively. Ogg Vorbis is not bound by patents and is considered "free software" in the sense that no corporate entity owns the rights to the format. Some people feel that this is a safer container for their multimedia content for this reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/playogg/en/ |title=PlayOgg! |website=[[Free Software Foundation]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, oggcasters can generally not reach as wide of an audience as more traditional podcasters. This is mainly due to the lack of native Ogg Vorbis support in [[Microsoft]]'s [[Internet Explorer]] and Apple's [[Safari web browser]], and the lack of Ogg Vorbis support in many mobile audio devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wewantogg.com/ |title=Ogg Vorbis Support for Internet Explorer and Safari |website=We Want Ogg |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120918203524/http://www.wewantogg.com/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 18, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oggcast Planet maintains a central list of oggcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://monsterb.github.io/ocp/ |title=Oggcast Planet |author=monsterb |website=Oggcast Planet |date=March 14, 2010 |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political podcast===
{{Further|Political podcast}}

A '''political podcast''' focuses on current events, lasts usually a half hour to an hour, often with a relaxed and conversational tone, and features journalists and politicians and pollsters and writers and others with credentials in the [[public sphere]]. Most political podcasts have a host-guest interview format and are broadcast each week based on the news cycle. Political podcasts have blossomed in the past few years in the [[United States]] because of the long election cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/07/conservative-podcasts-ricochet/ |title=You Heard Right: Conservatives Get Their Very Own Podcast Network |last=Locke |first=Charley |date=July 6, 2016 |website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017 |quote= ...&amp;nbsp;this election cycle is bringing listeners an unprecedented spate of opinionated incredulity.

===Podguide===
A '''podguide''' is an enhanced [[audio tour]] podcast.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} It is a single [[audio file]] where each chapter displays a picture and a number of what to look at a certain stopover. The numbers correspond to the numbers on a map that can be downloaded via the link incorporated into the artwork of the chapters in the podguide. Podguides are in the [[m4a]] format and can only be listened to through [[iTunes]] or an [[iPod]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} It is like a soundseeing tour but with pictures and a map, so users can take the tour themselves.

==Uses==
{{Main|Uses of podcasting}}

Communities use collaborative podcasts to support multiple contributors podcasting through generally simplified processes, and without having to host their own individual feeds. A community podcast can also allow members of the community (related to the podcast topic) to contribute to the podcast in many different ways. This method was first used for a series of podcasts hosted by the Regional Educational Technology Center at [[Fordham University]] in 2005.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} [[Anders Gronstedt]] explores how businesses like [[IBM]] and [[Dell EMC|EMC]] use podcasts as an employee training and communication channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gronstedt |first=Anders |date=June 2007 |title=Employees Get an Earful |url=https://hbr.org/2007/06/employees-get-an-earful |journal=[[Harvard Business Review]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gronstedt |first=Anders |date=May 3, 2007 |title=Basics of Podcasting |url=http://gronstedtgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Infoline_Gronstedt_Basics_of_Podcasting.pdf |publisher=[[Association for Talent Development|ASTD]] |isbn=1-56286-488-2 |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The podcast industry is very profitable. Over 50 million people listen to podcasts each month. A small, yet efficient number of listeners are also podcast creators. Creating a podcast is reasonably inexpensive. It requires just a microphone, laptop or other personal computer, and a room with some sound blocking. Podcast creators tend to have a good listener base because of their relationships with the listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Smith |first=Steve |date=November 22, 2016 |title=Podcasts: Can They Hear Us Now |url=http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/Column/Follow-the-Money/Podcasts-Can-They-Hear-Us-Now-114172.htm |magazine=EContent |publisher=[[Information Today, Inc.]] |volume=39 |issue=8 |page=9 |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is based on the [[FLEX (protocol)|FLEX]] one-way paging protocol, adding capabilities for multiple forward channels, multiple return channels, and roaming.  It originally came in two variants, '''ReFLEX25''' and '''ReFLEX50'''. ''ReFLEX50'' was originally developed to support a messaging service launched by MTEL in the mid 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/MTEL's+Destineer+Corp.+demonstrates+two-way+messaging+technology+to...-a016118531 ''Pocket MTEL's Destineer Corp. demonstrates two-way messaging technology to financial analysts.'', Jan. 19, 1995, Business Wire]&lt;/ref&gt; while ''ReFLEX25'' was developed several years later to provide an upgrade path for traditional one-way paging carriers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twice.com/computing/computing/weblink-readies-new-2-way-pagers/65681 ''WebLink Readies New 2-Way Pagers.'', Jul 7, 2003, Joseph Palenchar]&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''50'' and ''25'' signified ''50 kHz'' and ''25kHz'' channel spacing, although in reality both variants supported flexible channel configurations.  The two variants were unified into a single protocol with version 2.7, which was released simply as '''ReFLEX 2.7'''. Devices compliant with ''ReFLEX 2.7'' are backwards compatible with both ''ReFLEX25'' and ''ReFLEX50'' networks, with several new features to improve roaming, performance, and interoperability between different networks.  ''ReFLEX'' systems support forward channel speeds of 1600, 3200, and 6400 bits per second, and return channel speeds of 800, 1600, 6400, and 9600 bits per second.  Like [[FLEX (protocol)|FLEX]], ''ReFLEX'' is synchronous, based on 1.875 second frames and 4-level FSK modulation.

The [[Motorola PageWriter]] released in 1996 was one of the first devices to use the ReFLEX network protocol.  Although ReFLEX now has limited viability in the commercial market, it is finding new uses in [[Automatic Meter Reading]], public safety, and low cost/bandwidth [[Machine to machine|M2M]] applications.

A '''reactionless drive''' is a device producing [[motion (physics)|motion]] without the exhaust of a [[propellant]]. A [[Field propulsion|propellantless drive]] is not necessarily reactionless when it constitutes an [[open system (thermodynamics)|open system]] interacting with external [[Field (physics)|field]]s; but a reactionless drive is a particular case of a propellantless drive as it is a [[closed system]] presumably in contradiction with the [[Momentum#Conservation|law of conservation of momentum]] and often considered similar to a [[perpetual motion machine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Winchell D. Chung Jr |title=Reactionless drives |url=http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/reactionlessdrive.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name comes from [[Newton's third law]], which is usually expressed as, "for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction." A large number of infeasible devices, such as the [[Dean drive]], are a staple of [[science fiction]] particularly for [[space propulsion]].

== Closed systems ==
Through the years there have been numerous claims for functional reactionless drive designs using ordinary mechanics (i.e. devices not said to be based on quantum mechanics, relativity or atomic forces or effects). Two of these represent their general classes: The "Dean drive" is perhaps the best known example of a "linear oscillating mechanism" reactionless drive; The "GIT" is perhaps the best known example of a "rotating mechanism" reactionless drive. These two also stand out as they both received much publicity from their promoters and the popular press in their day and both were eventually rejected when proven to not produce any reactionless drive forces. The rise and fall of these devices now serves as a cautionary tale for those making and reviewing similar claims.&lt;ref name=NASA /&gt;

=== Dean drive ===
The [[Dean drive]] was a mechanical device concept promoted by inventor Norman L. Dean. Dean claimed that his device was a "reactionless thruster" and that his working models could demonstrate this effect. He held several private demonstrations but never revealed the exact design of the models nor allowed independent analysis of them.&lt;ref name=EngineWings&gt;{{cite journal |date=Sep 1961 |journal=Popular Mechanics |title=Engine With Built-in Wings}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Phasers&gt;{{cite journal |date=June 1976 |journal=Analog |title=Detesters, Phasers and Dean Drives}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dean's claims of reactionless thrust generation were subsequently shown to be in error and the "thrust" producing the directional motion was likely to be caused by [[friction]] between the device and the surface on which the device was resting and would not work in free space.&lt;ref name=NASA&gt;{{cite conference |last=Mills |first=Marc G. |title=Responding to Mechanical Antigravity |conference=42nd Joint Propulsion Conference and Exhibit |author2=Thomas, Nicholas E.  |date=July 2006 |publisher=[[NASA]]  |url=http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2006/TM-2006-214390.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030093616/http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2006/TM-2006-214390.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Physicists' View of Nature |first=Amit|last=Goswami |date=2000 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=gwPHgcHK4sgC&amp;pg=PA60 |publisher=Springer |pages=60 |isbn=0-306-46450-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gyroscopic Inertial Thruster (GIT)===
The Gyroscopic Inertial Thruster is a proposed reactionless drive based on the mechanical principles of a rotating mechanism. The concept involves various methods of leverage applied against the supports of a large gyroscope. The supposed operating principle of a GIT is a mass traveling around a circular trajectory at a variable speed. The high-speed part of the trajectory allegedly generates greater centrifugal force than the low, so that there is a greater thrust in one direction than the other.&lt;ref name=LaViolette2008&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AiqZwmquWKkC&amp;pg=PA384 |page=384 |title=Secrets of Antigravity Propulsion: Tesla, UFOs, and Classified Aerospace Technology |last=LaViolette |first=Paul A. |publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co |date=2008 |isbn=1-59143-078-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish inventor Sandy Kidd, a former RAF radar technician, investigated the possibility (without success) in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |work=New Scientist |volume=148 |date=1995 |page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; He posited that a gyroscope set at various angles could provide a lifting force, defying gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PRa5P6dtkq0C&amp;pg=PA178 |page=178 |title=Anti-Gravity &amp; the Unified Field |last=Childress |first=David Hatcher |publisher=Adventures Unlimited Press |date=1990 |series=Lost Science |isbn=0-932813-10-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, several people sent suggestions to the Space Exploration Outreach Program (SEOP) at NASA recommending that NASA study a gyroscopic inertial drive, especially the developments attributed to the American inventor Robert Cook and the Canadian inventor Roy Thornson.&lt;ref name=LaViolette2008/&gt; In the 1990s and 2000s, enthusiasts attempted the building and testing of GIT machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Lab/4549/mars.html|title=The Adventures of the Gyroscopic Inertial Flight Team|date=1998-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Laithwaite]], the "Father of Maglev", received a US patent for his "Propulsion System", which was claimed to create a linear thrust through gyroscopic and inertial forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|5860317}}&lt;/ref&gt; After years of theoretical analysis and laboratory testing of actual devices, no rotating (or any other) mechanical device has ever been found to produce unidirectional reactionless thrust in free space.&lt;ref name=NASA /&gt;

==Open systems==
{{Main article|Field propulsion}}

===Movement with thrust===

Several kinds of thrust generating methods are in use or have been proposed that are propellantless, as they do not work like rockets and reaction mass is not carried nor expelled from the device. However they are not reactionless, as they constitute open systems interacting with electromagnetic waves or various kinds of fields.

Most famous propellantless methods are the [[Gravity assist|gravity assist maneuver]] or gravitational slingshot of a spacecraft accelerating at the expense of the momentum of the planet it orbits, through the gravitational field, or [[beam-powered propulsion]] using the [[radiation pressure]] of electromagnetic waves from a distant source like a [[laser]].

More speculative methods have also been proposed, like the [[Woodward effect]], the [[quantum vacuum plasma thruster]] or various hypotheses trying to explain the thrust apparently produced by the [[RF resonant cavity thruster#Hypotheses|EmDrive]].

===Movement without thrust===
[[File:Alcubierre.png|thumbnail|2D visualisation of spacetime distortion induced by the Alcubierre metric.]]
{{main article|Alcubierre drive}}

Because there is no well-defined "center of mass" in [[Spacetime#Spacetime in general relativity|curved spacetime]], [[general relativity]] allows a stationary object to, in a sense, "change its position" in a counter-intuitive manner, without violating conservation of momentum.

* The [[Alcubierre drive]] is a hypothetical method of apparent [[faster-than-light]] propulsion for [[interstellar travel]] postulated from the theory of general relativity. Although this concept may be allowed by the currently accepted laws of physics, it remains unproven; implementation would require a [[negative energy]] density, and possibly a better understanding of [[quantum gravity]]. It is not clear how (or if) this effect could provide a useful means of accelerating an actual space vehicle and no practical designs have been proposed, but experiments are underway at [[Advanced Propulsion Physics Laboratory|NASA's Eagleworks Laboratories]] to attempt the first detection of an induced spacetime curvature, which could be the first step toward proving the validity of the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kakaes |first=Konstantin |url= http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2013-03/warp-factor |title=Warp Factor: A NASA scientist claims to be on the verge of faster-than-light travel: is he for real?, Popular Science, April 2013 |publisher=PopSci.com |accessdate=2014-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20110015936.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* A hypothetical "impulse engine" or "distortion engine" creating a [[gravitational potential]] in spacetime, with no negative energy source contrary to the Alcubierre drive, would also produce a reactionless motion, being a low velocity (non [[Relativistic speed|relativistic]]) [[warp drive]].{{Citation needed|reason=Prior citation removed for lack of support|date=June 2018}}

* Some [[Bimetric gravity|bimetric theories of gravity]] with [[Variable speed of light#Modern VSL theories as an alternative to cosmic inflation|variable speed of light]] like the [[Jean-Pierre Petit#Janus cosmological model (Twin universe theory)|Janus cosmological model]] hypothesize apparent faster-than-light interstellar travel with no acceleration nor deceleration, using the energy difference of the two conjugated [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|metric]]s to reach relativistic speeds after a mass inversion process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Petit|first1=J.P.|last2=d'Agostini|first2=G.|date=10 November 2014|title=Cosmological bimetric model with interacting positive and negative masses and two different speeds of light, in agreement with the observed acceleration of the Universe|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269464559_Cosmological_bimetric_model_with_interacting_positive_and_negative_masses_and_two_different_speeds_of_light_in_agreement_with_the_observed_acceleration_of_the_Universe|journal=Modern Physics Letters A|volume=29|issue=34|doi=10.1142/S021773231450182X|bibcode=2014MPLA...2950182P}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* “Swimming in spacetime” is a geometrical motive principle that exploits the curved spacetime metric of the gravitational field to permit an extended body undergoing specific deformations in shape, to change position. In weak gravitational fields, like that of Earth, the change in position per deformation cycle would be far too small to detect, but the concept remains of interest as the only unambiguous example of reactionless motion in mainstream physics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v301/n2/full/scientificamerican0809-38.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.science20.com/hammock_physicist/swimming_through_empty_space|title=Swimming Through Empty Space|work=Science 2.0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Redshift''' is a techno-economic theory suggesting hypersegmentation{{Clarify|date=June 2011}} of [[information technology]] markets based on whether individual computing needs are over or under-served by [[Moore's law]], which predicts the doubling of computing transistors (and therefore roughly computing power) every two years.  The theory,
proposed and named by [[New Enterprise Associates]] partner and former [[Sun Microsystems]] CTO [[Greg Papadopoulos]], categorized a series of high growth markets (redshifting) while predicting slower GDP-driven growth in traditional computing markets (blueshifting). Papadopoulos predicted the result will be a fundamental redesign of components comprising computing systems.

==Hypergrowth market segments (redshifting)==
According to the Redshift theory, applications "redshift" when they grow dramatically faster than Moore's Law allows, growing quickly in their absolute number of systems.&lt;ref name="gregspeech"&gt;Greg Papadopoulos: Sun Analyst Summit 2007, http://sun.feedroom.com/linking/?skin=oneclip&amp;fr_story=FEEDROOM178646&amp;hl=false&lt;/ref&gt;  In these markets, customers are running out of datacenter real-estate, power and cooling infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, June 14, 2006: https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/14/technology/14search.html?ex=1307937600&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Dell]] Senior Vice President Brad Anderson, “Businesses requiring [[hyperscale]] computing environments – where infrastructure deployments are measured by up to millions of servers, storage and networking equipment – are changing the way they approach IT.”&lt;ref&gt;Dell Press Release: http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/corp/pressoffice/en/2007/2007_03_27_rr_000?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=corp&lt;/ref&gt;

While various Redshift proponents offer minor alterations on the original presentation, “Redshifting” generally includes:&lt;ref name="gregspeech"/&gt;

=== ΣBW (Sum-of-[[Bandwidth (computing)|Bandwidth]]) ===
These are companies that drive heavy [[Internet]] traffic.  This includes popular web-portals like [[Google]], [[Yahoo]], [[AOL]] and [[MSN]].  It also includes [[Telecommunications service provider|telecoms]], multimedia, television over IP, online games like [[World of Warcraft]] and others.{{which|date=November 2010}}  This segment has been enabled by widespread availability of high-bandwidth Internet connections to consumers through a [[DSL]] or [[cable modem]]. A simple way to understand this market is that for every [[byte]] of content served to a PC, mobile phone or other device over a network, there must exist computing systems to send it over the network.

=== [[High performance computing]] (HPC) ===
These are companies that do complex simulations that involve (for example) weather, stock markets or drug-design simulations.  This is a generally elastic market because businesses frequently spend every "available" dollar budgeted for IT. A common anecdote claims that cutting the cost of computing by half causes customers in this segment to buy at least twice as much, because each marginal IT dollar spent contributes to business advantage.

=== *prise (or "Star-prise") ===
These are companies that aggregate traditional computing applications and offer them as services, typically in the form of [[Software as a service|Software as a Service (SaaS)]].  For example, companies that deploy [[Customer relationship management|CRM]] are over-served by Moore's Law, but companies that aggregate CRM functions and offer them as a service, such as [[Salesforce.com]], grow faster than Moore's Law.

=== The eBay crisis ===
A prime example of redshift was a crisis at [[eBay]].  In 1999 eBay suffered a database crisis when a single [[Oracle Database]] running on the fastest [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] machine available (these tracking Moore's law in this period) was not enough to cope with eBay's growth.  The solution was to massively parallelise their system architecture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://smoothspan.wordpress.com/2007/08/30/youve-already-had-a-multicore-crisis-and-just-didnt-realize-it/ You’ve Already Had a Multicore Crisis and Just Didn’t Realize It!] (Bob Warfield, ''SmoothSpan Blog'', 2007-08-30)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Randy Shoup and Dan Pritchett. [http://www.addsimplicity.com/downloads/eBaySDForum2006-11-29.pdf "The eBay Architecture: Striking a balance between site stability, feature velocity, performance, and cost."] SD Forum 2006 proceedings, November 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional computing markets (blueshifting)==
Redshift theory suggests that traditional computing markets, such as those serving [[enterprise resource planning]] or [[customer relationship management]] applications, have reached relative saturation in industrialized nations.  Thereafter, proponents argued further market growth will closely follow [[gross domestic product]] growth, which typically remains under 10% for most countries annually. Given that Moore's Law continues to predict accurately the rate of computing transistor growth, which roughly translates into computing power doubling every two years, the Redshift theory suggests that traditional computing markets will ultimately contract as a percentage of computing expenditures over time.&lt;ref name="gregspeech"/&gt;

Functionally, this means “Blueshifting” customers can satisfy computing requirement growth by swapping in faster processors without increasing the absolute number of computing systems.

==Consequences and industry commentary==
Papadopoulos argued that while traditional computing markets remain the dominant source of revenue through the late 2000s, a shift to hypergrowth markets will inevitably occur.  When that shift occurs, he argued computing (but not computers) will become a utility, and differentiation in
the IT market will be based upon a company's ability to deliver computing at massive scale, efficiently and with predictable service levels, much like electricity at that time.&lt;ref name="gregspeech"/&gt;

If computing is to be delivered as a utility, [[Nicholas G. Carr|Nicholas Carr]] suggested Papadopoulos' vision compares with [[Microsoft]] researcher Jim Hamilton, who both agree that computing is most efficiently generated in [[shipping containers]]&lt;!-- Makes no sense --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Rough Type (Nicholas Carr's blog): http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/02/the_future_of_c.php and http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/03/showdown_in_the_1.php&lt;/ref&gt; Industry analysts are also beginning to quantify Redshifting and Blueshifting markets.  According to [[International Data Corporation]] vice president Matthew Eastwood, "IDC believes that the IT market is in a period of hyper segmentation... This a class of customers that is Moore's law driven and as price performance gains continue, IDC believes that these organizations will accelerate their consumption of IT infrastructure.”&lt;ref&gt;IDC Link: http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=lcUS20623507&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and nomenclature==
Key portions of Papadopoulos' theory were first presented by Sun Microsystems CEO [[Jonathan I. Schwartz|Jonathan Schwartz]] in late 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Sun Blackbox Press Conference: http://sun.feedroom.com/?skin=oneclip&amp;fr_story=73d774789da2b024c111f8cfc7948af6d1577827&amp;rf=bm&lt;/ref&gt; Papadopoulos later gave a full presentation on Redshift to Sun's annual Analyst Summit&lt;ref name="gregspeech"/&gt; in February 2007. The term [[Redshift]] refers to what happens when electromagnetic radiation, usually visible light, moves away from an observer.  Papadopoulos chose this term to reflect growth markets because redshift helped cosmologists explain the expansion of the universe.

Papadopoulos originally depicted traditional IT markets as green to represent their revenue base, but later changed them to “blueshift,” which occurs when a light source moves toward an observer, similar to what would happen during a contraction of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;The Economist, April 12, 2007: http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9013563&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2818">'''Remote service software''' is used by equipment manufacturers to remotely monitor, access and repair products in use at customer sites. It’s a secure, auditable gateway for service teams to troubleshoot problems, perform proactive maintenance, assist with user operations and monitor performance.  This technology is typically implemented in mission-critical environments like hospitals or IT data centers – where equipment downtime is intolerable.

==Benefits==
Remote service software helps to:
* Increase uptime, improve performance and extend the life of a device
* Control service costs by deploying patches and upgrades remotely, and ensure a first-time fix when an onsite visit is required
* Streamline administration of pay-per-use models, with automated usage monitoring
* Focus highly trained service teams on preventative maintenance, by diagnosing and repairing issues before they cause system failure
* Increase customer satisfaction and loyalty

Manufacturers are using aftermarket service a competitive differentiator.  Remote service software provides a platform for manufacturers to offer and meet stringent [[service level agreement]]s (SLAs) without increasing the size of their service team.

== Key characteristics of remote service software==
* '''Proactive:''' Remote monitoring of devices in use allows service teams to detect potential issues before they escalate, degrade performance or cause a system failure. This early warning system is a key component to issue avoidance and ability to meet more stringent [[key performance indicators|key performance indicator]] (KPIs) in SLAs. Once an issue is detected, service professionals can also use remote service technology gateways to push patches or resolve issues.
* '''Secure:''' Secure access is a core consideration of remote service.  Solutions should adhere to compliance guidelines and protect the remote connection between the manufacturer and the customer – ensuring that no data has been stolen and no outsiders have been granted access.
* '''Auditable:''' [ [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act|SOX]], [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] and [[PCI DSS|PCI]] ] compliance regulations require businesses to keep track of who does what on their network.  Auditors require forensic logs to trace the steps of every interaction a remote service technician has with every device.

== Other names for remote service software==
* [[Intelligent device management|IDM: intelligent device management]]
* SSM: strategic service management
* RDM: remote device management

Prior to 2008, Microsoft published updated specifications for RTF with major revisions of [[Microsoft Word]] and [[Microsoft Office|Office]] versions.

Most [[word processor]]s are able to read and write some versions of RTF.&lt;ref name="seniortechcenter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seniortechcenter.org/desktop_publishing/rich_text_format.php |title=Benefits of Rich Text Format (RTF)|work=Desktop Publishing, Presentations &amp; Word Processing|publisher=ETR Associates |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080323033333/http://www.seniortechcenter.org/desktop_publishing/rich_text_format.php |archivedate = 2008-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several different revisions of RTF specification and portability of files will depend on what version of RTF is being used.&lt;ref name="e-gov-uk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rtf-cookbook"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://metacpan.org/module/SBURKE/RTF-Writer-1.11/lib/RTF/Cookbook.pod#NOTES |title=Sean M.

It should not be confused with [[enriched text]] ([[media type]] "text/enriched" of RFC 1896) or its predecessor Rich Text (media type "text/richtext" of RFC 1341 and [[rfc:1521|1521]]), nor with IBM's [[RFT-DCA]] (Revisable Format Text-Document Content Architecture); these are completely different specifications.

==History==
[[Richard Brodie (programmer)|Richard Brodie]], [[Charles Simonyi]], and David Luebbert, members of the [[Microsoft Word]] development team, developed the original RTF in the middle to late 1980s. Its syntax was influenced by the [[TeX]] typesetting language.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The first RTF reader and writer shipped in 1987 as part of Microsoft Word 3.0 for [[Macintosh]], which implemented the RTF version 1.0 specification. All subsequent releases of Microsoft Word for the Macintosh and all versions for Windows can read and write files in RTF format.

Microsoft maintains the format. The final version was 1.9.1 in 2008, implementing features of [[Office 2007]]. Microsoft has discontinued enhancements to the RTF specification. New features in Word 2010 and later versions will not save properly to the RTF format.&lt;ref&gt;[https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc179199(office.14).aspx#BKMK_Changed Changes in Word 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft anticipates no further updates to RTF, but has stated willingness to consider editorial and other non-substantive modifications of the RTF Specification during an associated [[ISO/IEC 29500]] balloting period.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://kikaku.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/sc34/wg4/archive/sc34-wg4-2011-0184.zip |title=GS26 RS Referencing Explanatory Report (RER) for DR 10-0017, General: missing normative reference, for RTF |author=Microsoft |format=PDF |date=2011-03-17 |accessdate=2011-04-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512231641/http://kikaku.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/sc34/wg4/archive/sc34-wg4-2011-0184.zip |archive-date=2014-05-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some time, RTF files were used to produce Windows [[WinHelp|.HLP]] help files, though this use has been superseded by [[Microsoft Compiled HTML Help]] files.

|}

== Code syntax ==

RTF is programmed by using groups, a backslash, a control word and a delimiter.  Groups are contained within braces ({}), with the opening brace and closing brace indicating the start of the group and end of the group respectively. Groups are used to indicate what type of attributes to apply to certain text.  The backslash (\) indicates that a control word is going to be used.  Control words are specifically programmed commands for RTF.  They can have certain states in which they're active. Their state is represented by a number.  For example,

;{{code|\b0}}   :   indicates that the Bold text is off
;{{code|\b1}}   :   indicates that the Bold text is on

A delimiter is one of three things:

# A space
# A digit or hyphen (i.e. -23, 23, 275)
# A character other than a digit or letter i.e.(\, /, }) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.biblioscape.com/rtf15_spec.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, the following RTF code:
&lt;source lang="tex"&gt;
 {\rtf1\ansi{\fonttbl\f0\fswiss Helvetica;}\f0\pard
 This is some {\b bold} text.\par
 }
&lt;/source&gt;
is a document which would be rendered like this when read by a program that supports RTF:

&lt;blockquote style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;
This is some '''bold''' text.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Character encoding==
A standard RTF file can consist of only 7-bit [[ASCII]] characters, but can encode characters beyond ASCII by [[escape sequence]]s.&lt;ref name="Microsoft RTF Syntax"&gt;{{citation |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa140284(office.10).aspx |title=Microsoft RTF Syntax}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character escapes are of two types: [[code page]] escapes and, starting with RTF 1.5, [[Unicode]] escapes. In a code page escape, two [[hexadecimal]] digits following a backslash and [['|typewriter apostrophe]] are used for denoting a character taken from a Windows code page. For example, if the code page is set to [[Windows-1256]]&lt;!-- this does not require control codes, it may be a system or application default --&gt;, the sequence &lt;code&gt;\'c8&lt;/code&gt; will encode the Arabic letter [[bet (letter)|bāʼ]] (ب).

For a Unicode escape the control word &lt;code&gt;\u&lt;/code&gt; is used, followed by a 16-bit signed [[decimal]] integer giving the Unicode UTF-16 code unit number. For the benefit of programs without Unicode support, this must be followed by the nearest representation of this character in the specified code page. For example, &lt;code&gt;\u1576?&lt;/code&gt; would give the Arabic letter ''bāʼ'' ب, specifying that older programs which do not have Unicode support should render it as a question mark instead.

The control word &lt;code&gt;\uc0&lt;/code&gt; can be used to indicate that subsequent Unicode escape sequences within the current group do not specify the substitution character.

Until RTF specification version 1.5 release in 1997, RTF has only handled 7-bit characters directly and 8-bit characters encoded as hexadecimal (using &lt;code&gt;\'xx&lt;/code&gt;). RTF control words (since RTF 1.5) generally accept signed 16-bit numbers as arguments. Unicode values greater than 32767 must be expressed as negative numbers.&lt;ref name="rtf15" /&gt; If a Unicode character is [[Unicode plane|outside BMP]], it is encoded with a surrogate pair. Support for Unicode was made due to text handling changes in Microsoft Word – Microsoft Word 97 is a partially Unicode-enabled application and it handles text using the [[UTF-16|16-bit Unicode character encoding scheme]].&lt;ref name="rtf15" /&gt; Microsoft Word 2000 and later versions are Unicode-enabled applications that handle text using the 16-bit Unicode character encoding scheme.&lt;ref name="rtf16" /&gt;

RTF files are usually 7-bit ASCII plain text. RTF consists of control words, control symbols, and groups. RTF files can be easily transmitted between PC based operating systems because they are encoded as a [[text file]] with 7-bit [[graphic character|graphic]] ASCII characters. Converters that communicate with Microsoft Word for MS Windows or Macintosh should expect data transfer as 8-bit characters and binary data can contain any 8-bit values.&lt;ref name="rtf191" /&gt;

==Human readability==
RTF is a data format for saving and sharing documents, not a [[markup language]]; it is not intended for intuitive and easy typing by a person.&lt;ref name="rtf-pocket-guide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rtf-pocket-scribd"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/15490806/RTF-Pocket-Guide-by-OReilly-Media |title=RTF Pocket Guide by O'Reilly Media  |accessdate=2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, unlike many word processing formats, RTF code can be [[human-readable]]: when an RTF file containing mostly latin characters without [[diacritic]]s is viewed as a plain [[text file]], the underlying ASCII text is readable, provided that the author has kept formatting concise&amp;nbsp;– otherwise, the formatting code can impede readability.

When RTF was released, most word processors used binary file formats ([[Microsoft Word]] used the [[Doc (computing)|.doc]] file format); RTF was unique in its simple formatting control which allows for a non-RTF aware program (e.g. [[Microsoft Notepad|Notepad]]) to open and provide a readable file. Today, the majority of these programs have changed to a XML-based file format (Word has switched to the [[.docx]] file format). Regardless, these files contain large amounts of formatting code. As such, they are ten or more times larger than the corresponding [[plain text]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://interglacial.com/rtf/ |title=Rich Text Format&amp;nbsp;– MSWord generates some scary RTF |date=2008-07-12 |author=Sean M. Burke |accessdate=2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rtf-pocket-guide" /&gt;  

To be standard-compliant RTF, non-ASCII characters must be [[#Character encoding|escaped]]. Thus, even with concise formatting, text that uses certain [[dash]]es and [[quotation mark glyphs|quotation marks]] is less legible. Latin languages that make heavy use of characters with [[diacritic]]s, such as \'f1 for [[ñ]] and \'e9 for [[é]] are particularly difficult to read in RTF.  Non-[[Latin script|Latin]] [[writing system|scripts]], consisting of characters such as \u21563 for [[CJK characters|吻]], are illegible in RTF.  In addition, from its beginnings, RTF has supported Microsoft [[Object Linking and Embedding|OLE]] embedded objects and Macintosh Edition Manager subscriber objects, which are not human-readable.

==Common uses and interoperability==
Most word processing software supports RTF format importing and exporting (following some version of RTF specification), and/or direct editing, often making it a "common" format between otherwise incompatible word processing software and operating systems.  These factors contribute to its [[interoperability]], but it will depend on what version of RTF is being used.&lt;ref name="e-gov-uk" /&gt; There are several consciously designed or accidentally born RTF dialects.&lt;ref name="ted-rtf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ftp.nluug.nl/pub/editors/ted/TedDocument-en_US.html |title=Ted, an easy rich text processor |author=Mark de Does |date=2009-10-23 |accessdate=2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most applications that read RTF files silently ignore unknown RTF control words.&lt;ref name="ted-rtf" /&gt;

RTF is the internal markup language used by Microsoft Word.&lt;ref name="rtf-pocket-guide"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/product-description/0596004753/ref=dp_proddesc_0/277-8520360-9056562?ie=UTF8&amp;n=266239&amp;s=books |title=RTF Pocket Guide |author=Sean M. Burke |date=July 2003 |accessdate=2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, since 1987, RTF files may be transferred back and forth between many old and new computer systems (and now over the Internet) despite differences between operating systems and their versions.  (But there are incompatibilities, e.g. between RTF 1.0 1987 and later specifications, or between RTF 1.0-1.4 and RTF 1.5+ in use of Unicode characters.)&lt;ref name="wordperfect-dos"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/~em36/wpdos/wordtowpdos.html |title=How to Import Microsoft Word Files into WordPerfect for DOS |accessdate=2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abiword.org/help/en-US/info/infoformats.html |title=Abiword Help&amp;nbsp;– File Formats |accessdate=2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mackichan.com/index.html?techtalk/v30/30ts79.htm~mainFrame |title=Opening Rich Text Format (RTF) files  |accessdate=2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This makes it a useful format for basic formatted text documents such as instruction manuals, résumés, letters, and modest information documents.  These documents at minimum support bold, italic, and underline text formatting.  Also typically supported are left-, center-, and right-aligned text, font specification and document margins.

Font and margin defaults, as well as style presets and other functions vary according to program defaults.  There may also be subtle differences perhaps between different versions of the RTF specification implemented in differing programs and program versions.  Nevertheless, the RTF format is consistent enough from computer to computer to be considered highly portable and acceptable for [[cross-platform]] use. The format supports [[metadata]] such as title, author, etc. but not all implementations support this.

===Objects===
Use of Microsoft Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) objects or Macintosh Edition Manager subscriber objects limits the interoperability, because these objects are not widely supported in programs for viewing or editing RTF files (e.g. embedding of other files inside the RTF, such as tables or charts from spreadsheet application).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feed/47307 |title=FOSS word processors compared: OOo Writer, AbiWord, and KWord |author=Bruce Byfield |date=2005-08-23 |accessdate=2010-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feed/46599 |title=Sharing files between OpenOffice.org and Microsoft Office |date=2005-07-28 |accessdate=2010-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204134005/http://www.linux.com/archive/feed/46599 |archivedate=2010-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/153229 |title=SoftMaker Office 2008 focuses on compatibility with Microsoft Office |date=2008-11-20 |accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feed/58330 |title=SoftMaker Office 2006 beta: Not a killer app |date=2006-11-21 |accessdate=2010-04-06 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://pacsec.jp/psj06/psj06lagadec-e.pdf |format=PDF |title=OpenOffice / OpenDocument and Microsoft Office 2007 / Open XML security |author=Philippe Lagadec |date=2006-11-30 |accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a software that understands an OLE object is not available, the object is usually replaced by a picture (bitmap representation of the object) or not displayed at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keyongtech.com/2560234-ole-object-bitmap-representation |title=OLE object&amp;nbsp;– bitmap representation? |accessdate=2010-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724111954/http://www.keyongtech.com/2560234-ole-object-bitmap-representation |archivedate=July 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.codeproject.com/KB/edit/COleRichEditCtrl.aspx |title=A Rich Edit Control That Displays Bitmaps and Other OLE Objects |accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pictures===
RTF supports inclusion of JPEG, Portable Network Graphics (PNG), Enhanced Metafile (EMF), [[Windows Metafile]] (WMF), Apple PICT, Windows Device-dependent bitmap, Windows Device Independent bitmap and OS/2 Metafile picture types in hexadecimal (the default) or binary format in a RTF file. Not all of these picture types are supported in all RTF readers. When a RTF document is opened in software that does not support the picture type of an inserted picture, such picture is not displayed at all.

RTF writers usually convert inserted pictures from an unsupported picture types (e.g. BMP, TIFF, GIF, etc.) to one of supported picture types (PNG, WMF) or they do not include pictures at all.

For better compatibility with Microsoft products, some RTF writers include the same picture in two different picture types in one RTF file:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/224663/en-us |title=Document file size increases with EMF, PNG, GIF, or JPEG graphics in Word |accessdate=2011-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* one of the supported picture types (e.g. JPG or PNG)&amp;nbsp;– it uses either the original format of the inserted graphics file (if this graphics file uses one of RTF-supported formats&amp;nbsp;– such as PNG, JPG) or a RTF-supported picture type created by RTF writer in conversion from RTF-unsupported graphics file (e.g. conversion from BMP or GIF to PNG)
* a [[Windows Metafile]] (WMF) copy of the original picture&amp;nbsp;– for better compatibility with some Microsoft applications (e.g. Wordpad). The Windows Metafile copy is included without any compression.

This method increases the RTF file size rapidly. The RTF specification does not require this method and there are various implementations that include pictures without the WMF copy (e.g. Abiword or Ted).

For Microsoft Word it is also possible to set a specific registry value ("ExportPictureWithMetafile=0") in order to prevent Word from saving the WMF copy (see link "Document file size increases with EMF, PNG, GIF, or JPEG graphics in Word" at the beginning).

===Fonts===
RTF supports [[font embedding|embedding]] of [[Computer font|fonts]] used in the document, but this feature is not widely supported in software implementations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/275953 |title=Embedded fonts are not displayed as expected in the documents that are saved as RTF in Word |publisher=Microsoft Corporation |date=2007-02-20 |accessdate=2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://list.unm.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0504d&amp;L=rtf-l&amp;T=0&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=60 |title=Embedding fonts in RTF file |date=2005-04-23 |accessdate=2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=20370 |title=OpenOffice.org Issue&amp;nbsp;– MS Interoperability: embedd fonts into the document |accessdate=2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RTF also supports generic font family names used for [[font substitution]]: ''roman'' ([[serif]]), ''swiss'' ([[sans-serif]]), ''modern'' ([[monospaced font|monospace]]), ''script'', ''decorative'', ''technical''.&lt;ref name="rtf10-txt" /&gt; This feature is not widely supported for font substitution, e.g. in OpenOffice.org or Abiword.

===Annotations===
RTF specification supports [[annotation]]s (comments in documents) since version 1.0.&lt;ref name="rtf10-txt" /&gt; RTF 1.7 specification defined some new features for annotations: date stamp (there was previously only "time stamp") and parents of annotations.&lt;ref name="rtf17" /&gt; When a RTF document with annotations is opened in an application that does not support RTF annotations, they are not displayed at all. Similarly, when a document with annotations is saved as RTF in an application that does not support RTF annotations, annotations are not preserved in the RTF file. Some implementations may hide annotations by default or require some user action to display them&amp;nbsp;– e.g. in Abiword since version 2.8 or in IBM Lotus Symphony (up to version 1.3).

Microsoft products do not support comments within footers, footnotes or headers. Inserting a comment within headers, footers, or footnotes may result in a corrupted RTF document.&lt;ref name="rtf191" /&gt;

The RTF specification also supports footnotes (not to be confused with annotations), which are widely supported in RTF implementations (e.g. in OpenOffice.org, Abiword, KWord, Ted, but not in Wordpad). Endnotes are implemented as a variation on footnotes such that applications that support footnotes and not endnotes will render endnotes in an RTF document as footnotes. Similar to annotations, due to Microsoft products not supporting footnotes in headers, footers, or comments, including footnotes within those contexts in an RTF document may result in a corrupted document.&lt;ref name="rtf191" /&gt;

===Drawing objects===
RTF 1.2 specification defined use of drawing objects such as rectangles, ellipses, lines, arrows, polygons and various other shapes. RTF 1.5 specification introduced many new control words for drawing objects. RTF drawing objects are also called "shapes" since RTF 1.5.&lt;ref name="rtf15" /&gt;

However, RTF drawing objects are not supported in many RTF implementations, such as [[Apache OpenOffice]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://issues.apache.org/ooo/show_bug.cgi?id=3790 |title=Issue 3790&amp;nbsp;– RTF: Import Word 97-2000 RTF for Drawing Objects (Shapes) |work=Apache OpenOffice (AOO) Bugzilla|publisher=Apache Software Foundation|accessdate=2014-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; (though they are supported in [[LibreOffice]] 4.0 on&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/ReleaseNotes/4.0|title=LibreOffice 4.0 Release Notes|publisher=The Document Foundation|accessdate=2014-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or Abiword.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abisource.com/mailinglists/abiword-user/2006/Mar/0048.html |title=Re: Drawing inside Abiword |date=2006-03-15 |accessdate=2011-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; When an RTF document with drawing objects is opened in an application that does not support RTF drawing objects, they are not displayed at all. Some implementations will also not display any text inside drawing objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oooforum.org/forum/viewtopic.phtml?t=67774 |title=OOoForum.org&amp;nbsp;– Problem opening RTF file in Writer |accessdate=2011-05-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928093755/http://www.oooforum.org/forum/viewtopic.phtml?t=67774 |archive-date=2011-09-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://openoffice.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=113308 |title=OpenOffice.org Bugzilla – Bug 113308&amp;nbsp;– Vertical text in border |accessdate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, when a document with drawing objects is saved as RTF in an application that does not support RTF drawing objects, these are not preserved in the RTF file.

===Security concerns===
Unlike Microsoft Word's [[DOC (computing)|DOC]] format, as well as the newer [[Office Open XML]] and [[OpenDocument]] formats, RTF does not support [[Macro (computer science)|macro]]s. For this reason, RTF was often recommended over those formats when the spread of [[computer virus]]es through macros was a concern. However, having the .RTF extension does not guarantee that a file is safe, since Microsoft Word will open standard DOC files renamed with an RTF extension and run any contained macros as usual. Manual examination of a file in a plain text editor such as [[Notepad (Windows)|Notepad]], or use of the [[file (command)|&lt;code&gt;file&lt;/code&gt; command]] in [[UNIX]]-like systems, is required to determine whether or not a suspect file is really RTF.&lt;ref name="seniortechcenter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SANSavoidmacro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sans.org/security-resources/macro.php |title=Avoiding Macro Viruses |publisher=SANS Institute (via archive.org) |accessdate=2015-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610065538/http://www.sans.org/security-resources/macro.php |archivedate=June 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Enabling Word's "Confirm file format conversion on open" option (not enabled by default in any version of Word) can also assist by warning a document being opened is in a format that does not match the format implied by the file's extension, and giving the option to abort opening that file.

RTF files can carry malware; sometimes malicious files in RTF format are renamed with the .DOC extension. One exploit attacking a vulnerability was patched in Microsoft Word in April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2015/09/08/anatomy-of-a-malicious-email-recent-word-hole/ |title=Anatomy of a malicious email: Crooks exploiting recent Word hole – Naked Security |newspaper=Sophos Web site |date=8 September 2015  |author=Paul Ducklin |accessdate= 16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2014 there have been malware RTF files embedding [[OpenXML]] exploits  (.DOCX file with [[Zip (file format)|ZIP]] header, renamed with RTF extension) "to create a multi-exploit master key to cover a number of recent patched exploits in one RTF with low AV detection".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.malwaretracker.com/2014/05/cryptam-document-analysis-openxml.html |title=malware tracker blog: Cryptam Document Analysis + OpenXML embedded in RTF |newspaper=Blog.malwaretracker.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= 16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Documents of this and other types can be analysed free of charge online with a tool called Cryptam.&lt;ref&gt;[https://malwaretracker.com/doc.php Cryptam online document analysis tool]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementations==
{{See also|Comparison of word processors}}

Each RTF implementation usually implements only some versions or subsets of the RTF specification.&lt;ref name="e-gov-uk" /&gt; Many of the available RTF converters cannot understand all new features in the latest RTF specifications.&lt;ref name="wordperfect-dos" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tug.org/utilities/texconv/index.html |title=Converters from PC Textprocessors to LaTeX&amp;nbsp;– Overview&amp;nbsp;– Converting from RTF |author=Wilfried Hennings |year=2010 |accessdate=2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[WordPad]] editor in [[Microsoft Windows]] creates RTF files by default. It once defaulted to the [[Microsoft Word|Microsoft Word 6.0]] file format, but write support for Word documents (.doc) was dropped in a security update. Read support was also dropped in Windows 7. WordPad does not support some RTF features, such as headers and footers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.familysearch.org/eng/home/faq/faq_fileviewer.asp#Why_does_RTF_not |title=Why does RTF not work properly in WordPad and NotePad? |accessdate=2010-03-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805114650/http://www.familysearch.org/eng/home/faq/faq_fileviewer.asp#Why_does_RTF_not |archive-date=2009-08-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, WordPad can read and save many RTF features that it cannot create such as: tables, strikeout, superscript, subscript, "extra" colors, text background colors, numbered lists, right or left indent, quasi-hypertext and URL linking, and various line spacings. RTF is also the data format for "rich text controls" in MS Windows APIs.&lt;ref name="rtf-pocket-guide" /&gt;

The default text editor for [[Mac OS X]], [[TextEdit]], can also view, edit and save RTF files as well as [[Rich Text Format Directory|RTFD]] files.  TextEdit currently (as of July 2009) has limited ability to edit RTF document margins.  Much older Mac word processing application programs such as [[MacWrite]] and [[WriteNow]] were able to view, edit, and save RTF files as well.

The [[free software|free]] and [[open-source software|open-source]] word processors [[AbiWord]], [[Apache OpenOffice]], [[Bean (word processor)|Bean]], [[Calligra]], [[KWord]], [[LibreOffice]] and [[NeoOffice]] can view, edit and save RTF files. RTF format is also used in the [[Ted (word processor)|Ted]] word processor.

[[Scrivener (software)|Scrivener]] uses individual RTF files for all the text files that make up a given "project".

[[SIL International]]’s [http://www.sil.org/computing/toolbox/ Toolbox] freeware application for developing and publishing dictionaries uses RTF as its most common form of document output. RTF files produced by Toolbox are designed to be used in [[Microsoft Word]], but can also be used by other RTF-aware word processors.

RTF can be used on some [[ebook reader]]s because of its interoperability,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Handbook on Minimum Information Interoperability Standards (MIOS) |url=http://www.westerncape.gov.za/Text/2004/10/mios_v3_16_april_02.pdf |publisher=Department of Public Service and Administration (South Africa) |accessdate=2010-07-11|date=2002-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; simplicity, and low CPU processing requirements.

===Libraries and converters===

The open-source script rtf2xml can partially convert RTF to XML.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/rtf2xml/ |title=rtf2xml: convert MS RTF to XML |accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rtf2xml.sourceforge.net/docs/man-page.html |title=rtf2xml&amp;nbsp;– The Man Page |accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GNU [https://www.gnu.org/software/unrtf/unrtf.html UnRTF] is an open-source program to convert RTF into HTML, LaTeX, troff macros and other formats.

The Mac OS X command line tool textutil enables files to be  converted between rtf, rtfd, text, doc, docx, wordml, odt, and webarchive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/textutil.1.html |title=textutil man page |accessdate=2013-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

The Rich Text Format was the standard file format for text-based documents in applications developed for Microsoft Windows. Microsoft did not initially make the RTF specification publicly available, making it difficult for competitors to develop document conversion features in their applications. Because Microsoft's developers had access to the specification, Microsoft's applications had better compatibility with the format. Also, every time Microsoft changed the RTF specification, Microsoft's own applications had a lead in time-to-market, because competitors had to redevelop their applications after studying the newer version of the format.

[[Novell]] alleged that Microsoft's practices were anticompetitive in its 2004 antitrust complaint against Microsoft.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.novell.com/news/press/archive/2004/11/complaint.pdf |format=PDF |title=Novell Files WordPerfect Antitrust Lawsuit against Microsoft |author=Novell |date=2004-11-12 |accessdate=2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gl.scofacts.org/gl-20041115214025458.html |title=The Novell Antitrust Complaint (as text) &amp; A Law About Antitrust and Standards Writing |publisher= |date=2004-11-17 |accessdate=2010-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230163940/http://gl.scofacts.org/gl-20041115214025458.html |archivedate=2005-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The RTF specifications lack some of the semantic definitions necessary to read, write, and modify documents.&lt;ref name="rtfnightmare"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://diaryproducts.net/for/geek/microsoft_rtf_specification_nightmare |title=Microsoft RTF Specification Nightmare |author=Hannes Schmidt |date=2004-08-06 |accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sociotechnology''' (short for "social technology") is the study of processes on the intersection of [[society]] and [[technology]].&lt;ref name="Bunge1999"&gt;{{citation | last = Bunge | first = Mario | author-link = Mario Bunge | contribution = Sociotechnology | editor-last = Bunge | editor-first = Mario | editor-link = Mario Bunge | title = Social science under debate: a philosophical perspective | publisher = University of Toronto Press | location = Toronto, Ontario Buffalo, New York | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780802083579 | page = 297 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=-MLjZzJLbpkC&amp;pg=PA297&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; Vojinović and Abbott define it as "the study of processes in which the social and the technical are indivisibly combined".&lt;ref name="VojinovićAbbott2012-164"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Vojinović | first1 = Zoran | last2 = Abbott | first2 = Michael B. | title = Flood risk and social justice: from quantitative to qualitative flood risk assessment and mitigation | publisher = IWA Publishing | location = London | year = 2012 | page = 164 | isbn = 9781843393870 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sociotechnology is an important part of socio-technical design, which is defined as "designing things that participate in complex systems that have both social and technical aspects".&lt;ref name=Radziwill2009&gt;{{cite web|last1=Radziwill|first1=Nicole|title=What is Sociotechnology?|url=https://qualityandinnovation.com/2009/01/19/what-is-sociotechnology/|website=Quality and Innovation|accessdate=27 February 2017|date=19 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has been attributed to [[Mario Bunge]].&lt;ref name="WeingartnerDorn1990"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Weingartner | first1 = Paul | last2 = Dorn | first2 = Georg J. W. | title = Studies on Mario Bunge's Treatise | publisher = Rodopi | location = Amsterdam Atlanta, Georgia | year = 1990 | page = 426 | isbn = 9789051831870 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He defines it as a grouping of [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] and [[management science]].&lt;ref name="Farmer1995"&gt;{{cite book | last = Farmer | first = David John | author-link = David John Farmer | title = The language of public administration: bureaucracy, modernity, and postmodernity | publisher = University of Alabama Press | location = Tuscaloosa, Alabama | year = 1995 | page = 95 | isbn = 9780817307844 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=TxDGwJq_FOoC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; He sees it thus as a form of technology, distinguished from other branches of it such as [[engineering]], [[biotechnology]], [[information technology]] and [[general technology]]. Its goal is to help engineer [[sociosystems]] and evaluate their performance, while making use of [[social science]] research.&lt;ref name="Farmer1995"/&gt; In short, sociotechnology can be seen as the creation, modification and maintenance of social systems.&lt;ref name="WeingartnerDorn1990"/&gt;

Writing on sociotechnical change, [[Wiebe Bijker|Bijker]] wrote: "Society is not [[Technological determinism|determined by technology]], nor is technology determined by society. Both emerge as two sides of the sociotechnical coin."&lt;ref name="Bijker1997"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bijker | first = Wiebe E. | author-link = Wiebe Bijker | title = Of bicycles, bakelites, and bulbs: toward a theory of sociotechnical change | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1997 | page = 274 | isbn = 9780262522274 |url=http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/students/envs_5110/bijker.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology is the sum of ways in which social groups construct the material objects of their civilizations. The things made are socially constructed just as much as technically constructed. The merging of these two things, construction and insight, is sociotechnology. "For example, we typically build a bridge when there’s some expectation that people need to get from Point A to Point B, and there’s something they need to bypass along the way (e.g. a river, a canyon, another road). Failure to consider the social factors as well as the technical factors could lead to a "bridge to nowhere" – and we all know at least one person who’s had a problem with those"&lt;ref name=Radziwill2009&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Business==

Business use "richness and reach". The richness and reach strategy has evolved with technology. Richness is the ability to understand the information being passed for example calling someone is less rich than face to face contact. Reach is the number of people who exchange the information. In the past it was easier to complete richness and reach, but now with new technologies like video chatting, it is easier for business to do fulfill both richness and reach. Positive economics is the study of existing (or historical) means of exchange- a social science such as sociology, history, and political sciences. Normative economics is the social technology because it attempts to create different kinds of economic arrangements.

==Community and technology==

Accelerating growth of technology is a major problem and cause of destabilization of a communicational world. [[Paul Virilio]] believes that the "real" is being mistaken by virtual and the virtual world destroys physical presence. [[Marshall McLuhan]] wrote about the extension of human senses and the nervous system into the world through electronic media. Essentially he believes that the mind, the self, and consciousness are made from already created technology, media, and language as opposed to create naturally like those who made technology, media, and language. The image of one’s self becomes aware of itself in a world of technology. Consciousness and desire become less individualistic and turns into more already constituted social forms. The response to how someone feels something, what it means, and how it feels (for example feeling "attached" to someone after losing your virginity to them) is already set up through media communication (show, music, movies, articles). People will anticipate that they will be attached because of what they already know about it, so when it happens they do feel attached because that is how they were programmed to feel. People have turned to technology to create their "self" and determine how they feel and act. The conscious mind does not move into a world-as-other mindset but into an already constituted world.

Lewis Mumford believed the world of relying on technology began with early human experiments in industrialization including coal mines because coal and iron built and powered industrialization. It has come to the point where communication is relied on technology. Conversation turned into talking through a machine (texting, phone calls, social media).

The difference between the past and present technology is the extent of social binding. The more social forces it binds together the more powerful the technology is. For example, the attack on the World Trade Center as opposed to the attack of Pearl Harbor. It took a year to see the film of the attack on the American battleships. Because of this, people were more unaware and it was less of a big deal than what 9-11 was. During the terrorist attack in 2001, everything was broadcast in the moment. People were seeing the destruction with their own eyes in the moment, causing more ridicule and passion for the situation.

==Robots replacing people==
{{Further|Technological unemployment|Social robot}}
Furbie and Tamagotchi are electronic toys made for children that make noises and demand for care. These toys caused children to form a companionship with robots instead of human beings. Paro is a robotic baby seal that was created in Japan to perform therapeutic functions. Paro had positive psychological results for those in nursing homes. A woman constantly argued with her son and turned to the Paro for comfort and confided in the Paro instead of fixing things with her son. Society has turned to demanding more intimacy from sociable robots then from each other. People that use the robots for comfort feel like they are being comforted by someone even though they are actually alone. These robotic characters cause people to have a relationship with technology while avoiding the trouble of human interaction.

==Social technology==

Science and technology are big contributions to the economic development, but can also lead to negative side effects as it evolves. For example, people care more about materialistic things than the negative influences they have created in human morals and education. For example, it is more important for people to know words to songs than to remember things for their test. There are other problems due to the development of new technologies such as the conservation of the environment because there is a demand for more products which leads to more destruction of environment to build more to sell from. Many social problems have appeared in society and cannot seem to be solved by natural science and technology alone. It requires the need for social sciences as well. Social technology is the strategy used to help solve the wrong behaviors in the world that are caused by social problems like how to solve the issue of people being invested in materialistic goods more than morals, so that they economy can still continue to grow, and society can be a better place.

[[File:Debris-GEO1280.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=Earth from space, surrounded by small white dots|A computer-generated image representing space debris as could be seen from [[high Earth orbit]]. The two main debris fields are the ring of objects in [[geosynchronous orbit|geosynchronous Earth orbit]] (GEO) and the cloud of objects in [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO).]]

Initially, the term '''space debris''' referred to the natural debris found in the solar system: [[asteroid]]s, [[comet]]s, and [[meteoroid]]s. However, with the 1979 beginning of the NASA Orbital Debris Program,&lt;ref&gt;[https://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/ NASA Orbital Debris Program]&lt;/ref&gt; the term also refers to the debris (alt. '''space waste''' or '''space garbage''') from the mass of defunct, artificially created objects in space, especially [[Geocentric orbit|Earth orbit]]. These include old [[satellite]]s and spent [[rocket stage]]s, as well as the fragments from their disintegration and [[collision]]s. 

As of December 2016, five [[satellite collision]]s have generated space debris.{{cn|date=August 2018}}  Space debris is also known as ''orbital debris'', ''space junk'', ''space waste'', ''space trash'', ''space litter'' or ''space garbage''.&lt;ref&gt;  [http://www.spaceacademy.net.au/watch/debris/debris.htm GUIDE TO SPACE DEBRIS from the spaceacademy.net.au]&lt;/ref&gt;
   
{{as of|2016|7|5}}, the [[United States Strategic Command]] tracked a total of 17,852 artificial objects in orbit above the Earth,&lt;ref name=ODQN-201607&gt;{{cite newsletter |url=https://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/quarterly-news/pdfs/odqnv20i3.pdf |title=Orbital Debris Quarterly News |volume=20 |issue=3 |page=8 |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=July 2016 |access-date=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; including 1,419 operational satellites.&lt;ref name=ucs&gt;{{cite web |title=UCS Satellite Database |date=11 August 2016 |work=Nuclear Weapons &amp; Global Security |publisher=[[Union of Concerned Scientists]] |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear_weapons_and_global_security/space_weapons/technical_issues/ucs-satellite-database.html |accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these are just objects large enough to be tracked. {{as of|July 2013}}, more than 170 million bits of debris smaller than {{convert|1|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}, about 670,000 pieces of debris 1–10 cm, and around 29,000 larger pieces were estimated to be in orbit around the earth.&lt;ref name="esadebris2013"&gt;[http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Engineering_Technology/Clean_Space/How_many_space_debris_objects_are_currently_in_orbit "How many space debris objects are currently in orbit?"] ''ESA'', July 2013. Retrieved 6 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Collisions with debris have become a hazard to spacecraft; they cause damage akin to [[sandblasting]], especially to solar panels and optics like telescopes or [[star tracker]]s that cannot be covered with a [[hypervelocity ballistic shield|ballistic]] [[Whipple shield]] (unless it is transparent).&lt;ref name=nasa20090428&gt;

Below {{convert|2000|km|abbr=on}} Earth-[[orbital altitude|altitude]], pieces of debris are denser than [[meteoroid]]s; most are dust from solid rocket motors, surface erosion debris like paint flakes, and frozen coolant from [[RORSAT]] (nuclear-powered satellites). 
For comparison, the [[International Space Station]] orbits in the {{convert|300|–|400|km}} range, and the [[2009 satellite collision]] and [[2007 Chinese anti-satellite missile test|2007 antisat test]] occurred at {{convert|800|to|900|km}} altitude.&lt;ref name=nasa9&gt;

The [[Kessler syndrome]], a runaway [[chain reaction]] of collisions exponentially increasing the amount of debris, has been hypothesized to ensue beyond a critical density. This could affect useful polar-orbiting bands, increases the cost of protection for spacecraft missions and could destroy live satellites. Whether Kessler syndrome is already underway has been debated.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Grossman, [https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/tag/kessler-syndrome/ "NASA Considers Shooting Space Junk with Lasers"], ''wired'', 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The measurement, mitigation, and potential removal of debris are conducted by some participants in the [[space industry]].

== Characterization ==

=== {{anchor|Large vs. small}}Size ===
There are estimated to be over 51 million pieces of debris smaller than {{convert|1|cm|abbr=on}} as of July 2013. There are approximately 670,000 pieces from one to ten cm. The current count of large debris (defined as 10&amp;nbsp;cm across or larger&lt;ref name="technasa"&gt;[http://www.orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/library/UN_Report_on_Space_Debris99.pdf "Technical report on space debris"], p. 15, United Nations, New York, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;) is 29,000.&lt;ref name="esadebris2013"/&gt; The technical measurement cutoff is c. {{convert|3|mm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="nasadebris2012"&gt;[http://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/faqs.html#3 "Orbital Debris FAQ: How much orbital debris is currently in Earth orbit?"] ''NASA'', March 2012. Retrieved 31 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Over 98 percent of the 1,900 tons of debris in low Earth orbit (as of 2002) was accounted for by about 1,500 objects, each over {{convert|100|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Carroll, [http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/studies/final_report/800Carroll.pdf "Space Transport Development Using Orbital Debris"], NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts, 2 December 2002, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Total mass is mostly constant despite addition of many smaller objects, since they reenter the atmosphere sooner. Using a 2008 figure of 8,500 known items, it is estimated at {{convert|5500|t|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Robin McKie and Michael Day, [https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/feb/24/spaceexplorationspacejunk "Warning of catastrophe from mass of 'space junk'"] ''The Observer'', 24 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Debris in LEO}}Low Earth orbit (LEO) ===
[[File:Space Junk.jpg|thumb|alt=Earth from space, with space debris enhanced|Space debris in LEO, with sizes exaggerated]]

In LEO there are few "universal orbits" which keep spacecraft in particular rings (in contrast to GEO, a single widely used orbit). The closest are [[sun-synchronous orbit]]s that keep a constant angle between the Sun and the [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]; they are [[Polar orbit|polar]], meaning they cross over the polar regions. LEO satellites orbit in many planes, up to 15 times a day, causing frequent approaches between objects (the density of objects is much higher in LEO).&lt;ref&gt;Matt Ford, [https://arstechnica.com/science/news/2009/02/orbiting-space-junk-heightens-risk-of-satellite-catastrophes.ars "Orbiting space junk heightens risk of satellite catastrophes."] ''Ars Technica'', 27 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Orbits are further changed by [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] (which in LEO include unevenness of the Earth's gravitational field), and collisions can occur from any direction. For these reasons, the Kessler syndrome applies mostly to the LEO region; impacts occur at up to 16&amp;nbsp;km/s (twice the [[orbital speed]]) if head-on – the [[2009 satellite collision]] occurred at 11.7&amp;nbsp;km/s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Space_Debris/1112600510257_0.html "What are hypervelocity impacts?"] ''ESA'', 19 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; creating much [[spall]] in the critical size range. These can cross other orbits and lead to a cascade effect. A large-enough collision (e.g. between a space station and a defunct satellite) could make [[low Earth orbit]] impassable.&lt;ref name="k09"&gt;{{cite web |  url = http://webpages.charter.net/dkessler/files/KesSym.html |  title = The Kessler Syndrome |  date = 8 March 2009 |  author = Donald J. Kessler |  access-date = 22 September 2009 |  archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100527195029/http://webpages.charter.net/dkessler/files/KesSym.html |  archive-date = 27 May 2010 |  dead-url = yes |  df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manned missions are mostly at {{convert|400|km|abbr=on}} and below, where air drag helps clear zones of fragments. Atmospheric expansion as a result of [[space weather]] raises the critical altitude by increasing drag; in the 90s, it was a factor in reduced debris density.&lt;ref name=k9165 /&gt; Another was fewer launches by Russia; the USSR made most of their launches in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name=k7&gt;Klinkrad, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Debris at higher altitudes}}Higher altitudes ===
At higher altitudes, where air drag is less significant, orbital decay takes longer. Slight [[Drag (physics)|atmospheric drag]], [[Lunar theory|lunar perturbations]], Earth's gravity perturbations, [[solar wind]] and solar [[radiation pressure]] can gradually bring debris down to lower altitudes (where it decays), but at very high altitudes this may take millennia.&lt;ref name=kam68&gt;Kessler 1991, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; Although high-altitude orbits are less commonly used than LEO and the onset of the problem is slower, the numbers progress toward the critical threshold more quickly.{{contradict-inline|date=December 2015}}{{page needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| bibcode=2005ESASP.587..113S | title=Optical observation of space debris in high-altitude orbits | journal=Proceedings of the 4th European Conference on Space Debris (ESA SP-587). 18–20 April 2005 | volume=587 | page=113 | author1=Schildknecht | first1=T. | last2=Musci | first2=R. | last3=Flury | first3=W. | last4=Kuusela | first4=J. | last5=De Leon | first5=J. | last6=Dominguez Palmero | first6=L. De Fatima | year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many communications satellites are in [[geostationary orbit]]s (GEO), clustering over specific targets and sharing the same orbital path. Although velocities are low between GEO objects, when a satellite becomes derelict (such as [[Telstar 401]]) it assumes a [[geosynchronous orbit]]; its [[orbital inclination]] increases about .8° and its speed increases about {{convert|100|mph}} per year. Impact velocity peaks at about {{convert|1.5|km/s|abbr=on}}. [[Perturbation (astronomy)|Orbital perturbations]] cause longitude drift of the inoperable spacecraft and [[precession]] of the orbital plane. Close approaches (within 50 meters) are estimated at one per year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110718231404/http://www.weblab.dlr.de/rbrt/pdf/ISSFD_89085.pdf "Colocation Strategy and Collision Avoidance for the Geostationary Satellites at 19 Degrees West."] ''CNES Symposium on Space Dynamics'', 6–10 November 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; The collision debris pose less short-term risk than from an LEO collision, but the satellite would likely become inoperable. Large objects, such as [[Space-based solar power|solar-power satellites]], are especially vulnerable to collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = van der Ha | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Hechler | first2 = M. | year = 1981| title = The Collision Probability of Geostationary Satellites | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1981rome.iafcR....V | journal = 32nd International Astronautical Congress | volume = 1981 | issue = | page = 23 | bibcode=1981rome.iafcR....V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] now requires proof a satellite can be moved out of its orbital slot at the end of its lifespan, studies suggest this is insufficient.&lt;ref name= Anselmo&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anselmo | first1 = L. | last2 = Pardini | first2 = C. | year = 2000 | title = Collision Risk Mitigation in Geostationary Orbit | url = | journal = Space Debris | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 67–82 | doi = 10.1023/A:1021255523174 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since GEO orbit is too distant to accurately measure objects under {{convert|1|m|abbr=on}}, the nature of the problem is not well known.&lt;ref&gt;''Orbital Debris'', p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Satellites could be moved to empty spots in GEO, requiring less maneuvring and making it easier to predict future motion.&lt;ref&gt;''Orbital Debris'', p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Satellites or boosters in other orbits, especially stranded in [[geostationary transfer orbit]], are an additional concern due to their typically high crossing velocity.

Despite efforts to reduce risk, spacecraft collisions have occurred. The [[European Space Agency]] telecom satellite [[Olympus-1]] was struck by a meteoroid on 11 August 1993 and eventually moved to a [[graveyard orbit]].&lt;ref name="The Olympus failure"&gt;[http://www.selkirkshire.demon.co.uk/analoguesat/olympuspr.html "The Olympus failure"] ''ESA press release'', 26 August 1993.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911181644/http://www.selkirkshire.demon.co.uk/analoguesat/olympuspr.html |date=11 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 29 March 2006, the Russian [[Express (satellite)|Express-AM11]] communications satellite was struck by an unknown object and rendered inoperable;&lt;ref name=srdc20060419&gt;[http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=20320 "Notification for Express-AM11 satellite users in connection with the spacecraft failure"] ''Russian Satellite Communications Company'', 19 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; its engineers had enough contact time with the satellite to send it into a graveyard orbit.

An example of additional dead satellite debris are the remains of the 1970s/80s [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[RORSAT]] naval surveillance satellite program. The satellite's BES-5 [[Nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactor]] were cooled with a coolant loop of [[NaK|sodium-potassium alloy]], creating a potential problem when the satellite reached end of life. While many satellites were nominally boosted into medium-altitude [[graveyard orbit]]s, not all were. Even satellites which had been properly moved to a higher orbit had an eight-percent probability of puncture and coolant release over a 50-year period.

A past debris source was the testing of [[anti-satellite weapon]]s (ASATs) by the U.S. and Soviet Union during the 1960s and 1970s.

Although spacecraft are protected by [[Whipple shield]]s, solar panels, which are exposed to the Sun, wear from low-mass impacts. These produce a cloud of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] which is an electrical risk to the panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Akahoshi | first1 = Y. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2008 | title = Influence of space debris impact on solar array under power generation | url = | journal = International Journal of Impact Engineering | volume = 35 | issue = 12| pages = 1678–1682 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijimpeng.2008.07.048 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Satellites are believed to have been destroyed by micrometeorites and orbital debris (MMOD). The earliest suspected loss was of Kosmos 1275, which disappeared on 24 July 1981 (a month after launch). Kosmos contained no volatile propellant, therefore, there appeared to be nothing internal to the satellite which could have caused the destructive explosion which took place. However the case has not been proven and another hypothesis forwarded is that the battery exploded. Tracking showed it broke up, into 300 new objects.

Many impacts have been confirmed since. [[Olympus-1]] was struck by a meteoroid on 11 August 1993, and left adrift.&lt;ref name="The Olympus failure" /&gt; On 24 July 1996, the French [[Miniaturized satellite|microsatellite]] [[Cerise (satellite)|Cerise]] was hit by fragments of an Ariane-1 H-10 upper-stage booster which exploded in November 1986.&lt;ref name="Klinkrad, p. 2" /&gt; On 29 March 2006, the Russian Ekspress AM11 communications satellite was struck by an unknown object and rendered inoperable;&lt;ref name=srdc20060419 /&gt; its engineers had sufficient time in contact with the spacecraft to send it to a [[parking orbit]] out of GEO.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} On October 13, 2009, [[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] suffered a single battery cell failure anomaly and a battery heater control anomaly which were likely the result of an MMOD strike.&lt;ref name="Mission Report"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kelley|first1=Angelita|title=Terra mission operations: Launch to the present (and beyond)|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20160008917.pdf|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 12, 2010, [[Aura (satellite)|Aura]] lost power from one-half of one of its 11 solar panels and this was also attributed to an MMOD strike.&lt;ref name="2017Status"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fisher|first1=Dominic|title=Mission Status at Aura Science Team MOWG Meeting|date=13 June 2017|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20170005606.pdf|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 22, 2013 GOES-13 was hit by an MMOD which caused it to lose track of the stars that it uses to maintain attitude.

From the early [[Space Shuttle]] missions, NASA used NORAD to monitor the Shuttle's orbital path for debris. In the 1980s, this used much of its capacity.&lt;ref name=s50 /&gt; The first collision-avoidance maneuver occurred during [[STS-48]] in September 1991,&lt;ref name=encounters&gt;Rob Matson, [http://www.satobs.org/satclose.html "Satellite Encounters"] ''Visual Satellite Observer's Home Page''.&lt;/ref&gt; a seven-second [[reaction control system|thruster burn]] to avoid debris from [[Kosmos 955]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/52642978/STS-48-Space-Shuttle-Mission-Report "STS-48 Space Shuttle Mission Report"], NASA, NASA-CR-193060, October 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar maneuvers followed on missions 53, 72 and 82.&lt;ref name=encounters /&gt;

One of the first events to publicize the debris problem occurred on [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]'s second flight, [[STS-7]]. A fleck of paint struck its front window, creating a pit over {{Convert|1|mm|2|abbr=on}} wide. On [[STS-59]] in 1994, [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']]'s front window was pitted about half its depth. Minor debris impacts increased from 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Christiansen | first1 = E. L. | last2 = Hyden | first2 = J. L. | last3 = Bernhard | first3 = R.

Window chipping and minor damage to [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system tiles]] (TPS) was already common by the 1990s. The Shuttle was later flown tail-first to take the debris load mostly on the engines and rear cargo bay (not used in orbit or during descent, and less critical for post-launch operation). When flying to the [[International Space Station|ISS]], the two connected spacecraft were flipped around so the better-armored station shielded the orbiter.&lt;ref name=threat /&gt;

On a normal (low-orbit) mission to the ISS the risk was c. 1 in 300, but [[STS-125]] (the [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]] repair mission) at {{convert|350|mi|km|abbr=on}} was initially calculated at a 1-in-185 risk (due to the [[2009 satellite collision]]). A re-analysis with better debris numbers reduced the estimated risk to 1 in 221, and the mission went ahead.&lt;ref&gt;William Harwood, [http://www.spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts125/090416debris/ "Improved odds ease NASA's concerns about space debris"], ''CBS News'', 16 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most manned space activity takes place at altitudes below {{convert|800|to|1500|km|abbr=on}}, a Kessler syndrome cascade in that region would rain down into lower altitudes and the decay time scale is such that "the resulting [low Earth orbit] debris environment is likely to be too hostile for future space use".&lt;ref name=k9163&gt;Kessler 1991, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bechara J.

=== Gabbard diagrams ===
A debris cloud resulting from a single event is studied with [[scatter plot]]s known as Gabbard diagrams, where the [[perigee]] and [[apogee]] of fragments are plotted with respect to their [[orbital period]]. Gabbard diagrams of the early debris cloud prior to the effects of perturbations, if the data were available, are reconstructed.

Passive methods of increasing the orbital decay rate of spacecraft debris have been proposed. Instead of rockets, an [[electrodynamic tether]] could be attached to a spacecraft at launch; at the end of its lifetime, the tether would be rolled out to slow the spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Christensen, [http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/technovel_tether_041117.html "The Terminator Tether Aims to Clean Up Low Earth Orbit"], space.com.

=== External removal ===
A consensus of speakers at a meeting in Brussels on 30 October 2012 organized by the Secure World Foundation (a U.S. think tank) and the French International Relations Institute&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacenews.com/article/experts-active-removal-key-countering-space-junk-threat#.Ub3dSuce2Zc "Experts: Active Removal Key To Countering Space Junk Threat"] Peter B. de Selding, Space.com 31 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; reported that removal of the largest debris would be required to prevent the risk to spacecraft becoming unacceptable in the foreseeable future (without any addition to the inventory of dead spacecraft in LEO). Removal costs and legal questions about ownership and the authority to remove defunct satellites have stymied national or international action. Current space law retains ownership of all satellites with their original operators, even debris or spacecraft which are defunct or threaten active missions.

{{as of|2006}} the cost of any of these solutions is about the same as launching a spacecraft{{failed verification|date=December 2015}} and, according to NASA's Nicholas Johnson, not cost-effective.&lt;ref name=natgeo /&gt;{{outdated inline|date=December 2015}} Since then Space Sweeper with Sling-Sat (4S), a grappling satellite which captures and ejects debris, has been studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jan |first=McHarg |url=http://phys.org/news/2012-08-aims-space-debris.html |title=Project aims to remove space debris |publisher=Phys.org |date=10 August 2012 |accessdate=2013-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Laser methods ====
The [[laser broom]] uses a ground-based [[laser]] to [[Ablation|ablate]] the front of the debris, producing a rocket-like thrust which slows the object. With continued application, the debris would fall enough to be influenced by atmospheric drag.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Campbell, [http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/cst/csat20.pdf "Using Lasers in Space: Laser Orbital Debris Removal and Asteroid Deflection"], Occasional Paper No. 20, Air University, Maxwell Air Force Base, December 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wired20111026&gt;{{cite news |last=Mann|first=Adam |title=Space Junk Crisis: Time to Bring in the Lasers |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/10/space-junk-laser/ |accessdate=1 November 2011 |newspaper=Wired Science |date=26 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1990s, the U.S. Air Force's Project Orion was a laser-broom design.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Bekey, "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997ESASP.393..699B Project Orion: Orbital Debris Removal Using Ground-Based Sensors and Lasers].", ''Second European Conference on Space Debris'', 1997, ESA-SP 393, p. 699.&lt;/ref&gt; Although a test-bed device was scheduled to launch on a Space Shuttle in 2003, international agreements banning powerful laser testing in orbit limited its use to measurements.&lt;ref name=srdc20000816&gt;Justin Mullins [http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=2426 "A clean sweep: NASA plans to carry out a spot of housework."], ''New Scientist'', 16 August 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' disaster]] postponed the project and according to Nicholas Johnson, chief scientist and program manager for NASA's Orbital Debris Program Office, "There are lots of little gotchas in the Orion final report.

The momentum of the laser-beam [[photon]]s could directly impart a thrust on the debris sufficient to move small debris into new orbits out of the way of working satellites. NASA research in 2011 indicates that firing a laser beam at a piece of space junk could impart an impulse of {{convert|1|mm|abbr=on}} per second, and keeping the laser on the debris for a few hours per day could alter its course by {{convert|200|m|abbr=on}} per day.&lt;ref name=UKmail20110316&gt;James Mason et al, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1690 "Orbital Debris-Debris Collision Avoidance"], arXiv:1103.1690v2, 9 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; One drawback is the potential for material degradation; the energy may break up the debris, adding to the problem.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} A similar proposal places the laser on a satellite in [[Sun-synchronous orbit]], using a pulsed beam to push satellites into lower orbits to accelerate their reentry.&lt;ref name=sn20141125 /&gt; A proposal to replace the laser with an [[Ion Beam Shepherd]] has been made,&lt;ref&gt;C.

=== Micrometeoroids ===
{{Off topic|date=October 2014|Micrometeoroid}}
{{Main|Micrometeoroid}}
In 1946 during the [[Giacobinids|Giacobinid meteor shower]], [[Helmut Landsberg]] collected several small magnetic particles that were apparently associated with the shower.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Whipple, [http://www.pnas.org/content/36/12/687.full.pdf?ck=nck "The Theory of Micro-Meteorites, Part I: In an Isothermal Atmosphere"], ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'', Volume 36 Number 12 (15 December 1950), pp. 667 – 695.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fred Whipple]] was intrigued by this and wrote a paper that demonstrated that particles of this size were too small to maintain their velocity when they encountered the [[upper atmosphere]]. Instead, they quickly decelerated and then fell to Earth unmelted. In order to classify these sorts of objects, he coined the term "[[micrometeorite|micro-meteorite]]".&lt;ref&gt;Fred Whipple, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1949PA.....57..517W "The Theory of Micrometeorites."], ''Popular Astronomy'', Volume 57, 1949, p. 517.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whipple, in collaboration with Fletcher Watson of the [[Harvard Observatory]], led an effort to build an observatory to directly measure the velocity of the meteors that could be seen. At the time the source of the micro-meteorites was not known. Direct measurements at the new observatory were used to locate the source of the meteors, demonstrating that the bulk of material was left over from [[comet]] tails, and that none of it could be shown to have an extra-solar origin.&lt;ref name=whipple1951&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whipple | first1 = Fred | year = 1951 | title = A Comet Model. II. Physical Relations for Comets and Meteors | journal = Astrophysical Journal | volume = 113 | issue = | pages = 464–474 | bibcode=1951ApJ...113..464W | doi=10.1086/145416}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today it is understood that meteoroids of all sorts are leftover material from the formation of the Solar System, consisting of particles from the [[interplanetary dust cloud]] or other objects made up from this material, like comets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brownlee | first1 = D. E. | last2 = Tomandl | first2 = D.

The early studies were based on optical measurements only. In 1957, Hans Pettersson conducted one of the first direct measurements of the fall of space dust on the Earth, estimating it to be 14,300,000 tons per year.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Pettersson, "Cosmic Spherules and Meteoritic Dust." ''Scientific American'', Volume 202 Issue 2 (February 1960), pp. 123–132.&lt;/ref&gt; This suggested that the meteoroid flux in space was much higher than the number based on telescope observations. Such a high flux presented a very serious risk to missions deeper in space, specifically the high-orbiting [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] capsules. To determine whether the direct measurement was accurate, a number of additional studies followed, including the [[Pegasus satellite program]]. These showed that the rate of meteors passing into the atmosphere, or flux, was in line with the optical measurements, at around 10,000 to 20,000 tons per year.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Snelling and David Rush, [http://static.icr.org/i/pdf/technical/Moon-Dust-and-the-Age-of-the-Solar-System.pdf "Moon Dust and the Age of the Solar System"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512174406/http://static.icr.org/i/pdf/technical/Moon-Dust-and-the-Age-of-the-Solar-System.pdf |date=12 May 2011 }} ''Creation Ex-Nihilo Technical Journal'', Volume 7 Number 1 (1993), p. 2–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Micrometeoroid shielding ===
{{Off topic|date=October 2014|Micrometeoroid}}&lt;!-- I don't think so; it needs a copyedit but the material is about shielding spacecraft from space debris of the small size.  Probably a mistake to name it "micrometeoroid", since none of the small orbital stuff, natural or manmade, is a micrometeoroid until in reenters the atmosphere. --&gt;
[[File:Hypervelocity Impact Demonstration.jpg|left|thumb|The "energy flash" of a [[hypervelocity]] impact during a simulation of what happens when a piece of orbital debris hits a spacecraft in orbit.]]

Whipple's work pre-dated the [[space race]] and it proved useful when space exploration started only a few years later. His studies had demonstrated that the chance of being hit by a meteoroid large enough to destroy a spacecraft was extremely remote. However, a spacecraft would be almost constantly struck by micrometeorites, about the size of dust grains.&lt;ref name=whipple1951 /&gt;

Whipple had already developed a solution to this problem in 1946. Originally known as a "meteor bumper" and now termed the [[Whipple shield]], this consists of a thin foil film held a short distance away from the spacecraft's body. When a micrometeoroid strikes the foil, it vaporizes into a plasma that quickly spreads. By the time this plasma crosses the gap between the shield and the spacecraft, it is so diffused that it is unable to penetrate the structural material below.&lt;ref name=Marsden&gt;Brian Marsden, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/professor-fred-whipple-533019.html "Professor Fred Whipple: Astronomer who developed the idea that comets are 'dirty snowballs'."] ''The Independent'', 13 November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The shield allows a spacecraft body to be built to just the thickness needed for structural integrity, while the foil adds little additional weight. Such a spacecraft is lighter than one with panels designed to stop the meteoroids directly.

For spacecraft that spend the majority of their time in orbit, some variety of the Whipple shield has been almost universal for decades.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Whipple, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/289/5480/728 "Of Comets and Meteors"] ''Science'', Volume 289 Number 5480 (4 August 2000), p. 728.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judith Reustle (curator), [http://ares.jsc.nasa.gov/ares/hvit/basic.cfm "Shield Development: Basic Concepts"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927133616/http://ares.jsc.nasa.gov/ares/hvit/basic.cfm |date=27 September 2011 }}, NASA HVIT.

The trackers who fed the database were aware of other objects in orbit, many of which were the result of in-orbit explosions.&lt;ref name=s48&gt;Schefter, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Some were deliberately caused during 1960s [[anti-satellite weapon]] (ASAT) testing, and others were the result of rocket stages blowing up in orbit as leftover propellant expanded and ruptured their tanks. To improve tracking, NORAD employee John Gabbard kept a separate database. Studying the explosions, Gabbard developed a technique for predicting the orbital paths of their products, and Gabbard diagrams (or plots) are now widely used. These studies were used to improve the modelling of orbital evolution and decay.&lt;ref name=portree /&gt;

When the NORAD database became publicly available during the 1970s, NASA scientist [[Donald J. Kessler]] applied the technique developed for the asteroid-belt study to the database of known objects. In 1978 Kessler and Burton Cour-Palais co-authored "Collision Frequency of Artificial Satellites: The Creation of a Debris Belt",&lt;ref name=Kessler78&gt;Kessler 1978&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrating that the process controlling asteroid evolution would cause a similar collision process in LEO in decades rather than billions of years. They concluded that by about 2000, space debris would outpace micrometeoroids as the primary ablative risk to orbiting spacecraft.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

At the time, it was widely thought that drag from the [[Atmosphere of Earth|upper atmosphere]] would de-orbit debris faster than it was created. However, Gabbard was aware that the number and type of objects in space were under-represented in the NORAD data and was familiar with its behaviour. In an interview shortly after the publication of Kessler's paper, Gabbard coined the term "[[Kessler syndrome]]" to refer to the accumulation of debris;&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt; it became widely used after its appearance in a 1982 ''[[Popular Science]]'' article,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Schefter&lt;/ref&gt; which won the Aviation-Space Writers Association 1982 National Journalism Award.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

=== Follow-up studies ===
[[File:Baker-Nunn camera.jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=Large camera, with a man standing next to it for scale|[[Schmidt camera#Baker-Nunn|Baker-Nunn cameras]] were widely used to study space debris.]]
The lack of hard data about space debris prompted a series of studies to better characterize the LEO environment. In October 1979, [[NASA]] provided Kessler with funding for further studies.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt; Several approaches were used by these studies.

Optical telescopes or short-wavelength radar was used to measure the number and size of space objects, and these measurements demonstrated that the published population count was at least 50% too low.&lt;ref name=k9165&gt;Kessler 1991, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Before this, it was believed that the NORAD database accounted for the majority of large objects in orbit. Some objects (typically, U.S. military spacecraft) were found to be omitted from the NORAD list, and others were not included because they were considered unimportant. The list could not easily account for objects under {{convert|20|cm|abbr=on}} in size—in particular, debris from exploding rocket stages and several 1960s anti-satellite tests.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

Returned spacecraft were microscopically examined for small impacts, and sections of [[Skylab]] and the [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] which were recovered were found to be pitted. Each study indicated that the debris flux was higher than expected and debris was the primary source of collisions in space. LEO already demonstrated the Kessler syndrome.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

In 1978 Kessler found that 42 percent of cataloged debris was the result of 19 events, primarily explosions of spent rocket stages (especially U.S. [[Delta (rocket family)|Delta rockets]]).&lt;ref name=kessler81&gt;Kessler 1981&lt;/ref&gt; He discovered this by first identifying those launches that were described having a large number of objects associated with a payload, then researching the literature to determine the rockets used in the launch.  In 1979, this finding resulted in establishment of the NASA Orbital Debris Program after a briefing to NASA senior management, overturning the previously held belief that most unknown debris was from old ASAT tests, but from US upper stage rocket explosions and could be easily managed by depleting the unused fuel following the payload injection the upper stage Delta rocket.  Beginning in 1986, when it was discovered that other international agencies were possibly experiencing the same type of problem, NASA expanded its program to include international agencies, the first being the European Space Agency.&lt;ref name="Klinkrad, p. 2"&gt;Klinkrad, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other Delta components in orbit (Delta was a workhorse of the U.S. space program) had not yet exploded.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

=== {{anchor|A new Kessler Syndrome}}A new Kessler syndrome ===
During the 1980s, the U.S. Air Force conducted an experimental program to determine what would happen if debris collided with satellites or other debris. The study demonstrated that the process differed from micrometeoroid collisions, with large chunks of debris created which would become collision threats.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

In 1991, Kessler published "Collisional cascading: The limits of population growth in low Earth orbit"&lt;ref&gt;[http://meteor.uwo.ca/kessler/Critical%20Density%201991.pdf pdf of article]&lt;/ref&gt; with the best data then available. Citing the USAF conclusions about creation of debris, he wrote that although almost all debris objects (such as paint flecks) were lightweight, most of its mass was in debris about {{convert|1|kg|abbr=on}} or heavier. This mass could destroy a spacecraft on impact, creating more debris in the critical-mass area.&lt;ref name=k9163 /&gt; According to the National Academy of Sciences:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A 1-kg object impacting at 10&amp;nbsp;km/s, for example, is probably capable of catastrophically breaking up a 1,000-kg spacecraft if it strikes a high-density element in the spacecraft. In such a breakup, numerous fragments larger than 1&amp;nbsp;kg would be created.&lt;ref&gt;Technical, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2015}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kessler's analysis divided the problem into three parts. With a low-enough density, the addition of debris by impacts is slower than their decay rate and the problem is not significant. Beyond that is a critical density, where additional debris leads to additional collisions. At densities beyond this critical mass production exceeds decay, leading to a cascading [[chain reaction]] reducing the orbiting population to small objects (several cm in size) and increasing the hazard of space activity.&lt;ref name=k9163 /&gt; This chain reaction is known as the Kessler syndrome.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;

In an early 2009 historical overview, Kessler summed up the situation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Aggressive space activities without adequate safeguards could significantly shorten the time between collisions and produce an intolerable hazard to future spacecraft. Some of the most environmentally dangerous activities in space include large constellations such as those initially proposed by the Strategic Defense Initiative in the mid-1980s, large structures such as those considered in the late-1970s for building solar power stations in Earth orbit, and anti-satellite warfare using systems tested by the USSR, the U.S., and China over the past 30 years. Such aggressive activities could set up a situation where a single satellite failure could lead to cascading failures of many satellites in a period much shorter than years.&lt;ref name=k09 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Debris growth ===
During the 1980s, NASA and other U.S. groups attempted to limit the growth of debris. One effective&lt;!-- see Kessler's estimate above about debris from exploding boosters --&gt; solution was implemented by [[McDonnell Douglas]] on the Delta booster,{{when|date=December 2014}} by having the booster move away from its payload and vent any propellant remaining in its tanks. This eliminated the pressure buildup in the tanks which caused them to explode in the past.&lt;ref name=s50&gt;Schefter, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries were slower to adopt this measure and, due especially to a number of launches by the [[Soviet Union]], the problem grew throughout the decade.&lt;ref name=h7&gt;See charts, Hoffman p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new battery of studies followed{{when|date=December 2014}} as NASA, NORAD and others attempted to better understand the orbital environment, with each adjusting the number of pieces of debris in the critical-mass zone upward. Although in 1981 (when Schefter's article was published) the number of objects was estimated at 5,000,&lt;ref name=s48 /&gt; new detectors in the [[Ground-based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance]] system found new objects. By the late 1990s, it was thought that most of the 28,000 launched objects had already decayed and about 8,500 remained in orbit.&lt;ref&gt;See chart, Hoffman p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2005 this was adjusted upward to 13,000 objects,&lt;ref&gt;In the time between writing Chapter 1 (earlier) and the Prolog (later) of ''Space Debris'', Klinkrad changed the number from 8,500 to 13,000 – compare p. 6 and ix.&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2006 study increased the number to 19,000 as a result of an [[Anti-satellite weapon|ASAT]] test and a satellite collision.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hoffman, [http://defensenews.com/blogs/space-symposium/ "It's getting crowded up there."] ''Space News'', 3 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, NASA said that 22,000 objects were being tracked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/04/06/space-junk-threat-grow-astronauts-satellites/ "Space Junk Threat Will Grow for Astronauts and Satellites"], Fox News, 6 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth in the number of objects as a result of the late-1990s studies sparked debate in the space community on the nature of the problem and the earlier dire warnings. According to Kessler's 1991 derivation and 2001 updates,&lt;ref&gt;Kessler 2001&lt;/ref&gt; the LEO environment in the {{convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} altitude range should be cascading. However, only one major incident has occurred: the [[2009 satellite collision]] between Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251. The lack of obvious short-term cascading has led to speculation that the original estimates overstated the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Technical&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2015}} According to Kessler a cascade would not be obvious until it was well advanced, which might take years.&lt;ref name=graph&gt;Jan Stupl et al, [http://swfound.org/media/28344/Stupl-DebrisAvoidanceUsingLasers.pdf "Debris-debris collision avoidance using medium power ground-based lasers"], 2010 Beijing Orbital Debris Mitigation Workshop, 18–19 October 2010, see graph p. 4  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309055302/http://swfound.org/media/28344/Stupl-DebrisAvoidanceUsingLasers.pdf |date=9 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 NASA model suggested that if no new launches took place the environment would retain the then-known population until about 2055, when it would increase on its own.&lt;ref name=natgeo&gt;Stefan Lovgren, [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/01/0119_060119_space_junk.html "Space Junk Cleanup Needed, NASA Experts Warn."] ''National Geographic News'', 19 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.-C Liou and N. L. Johnson, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/311/5759/340 "Risks in Space from Orbiting Debris"], ''Science'', Volume 311 Number 5759 (20 January 2006), pp. 340 – 341&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Crowther of Britain's [[Defence Evaluation and Research Agency]] said in 2002 that he believed the cascade would begin about 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Antony Milne, ''Sky Static: The Space Debris Crisis'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, {{ISBN|0-275-97749-8}}, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Academy of Sciences, summarizing the professional view, noted widespread agreement that two bands of LEO space—900 to {{convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} and {{convert|1500|km|abbr=on}}—were already past  critical density.&lt;ref&gt;Technical, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2009 European Air and Space Conference, [[University of Southampton]] researcher Hugh Lewis predicted that the threat from space debris would rise 50 percent in the next decade and quadruple in the next 50 years. {{asof|2009}}, more than 13,000 close calls were tracked weekly.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Marks, [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18050-space-debris-threat-to-future-launches.html "Space debris threat to future launches"], 27 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 report by the [[National Research Council (United States)|U.S. National Research Council]] warned [[NASA]] that the amount of orbiting space debris was at a critical level. According to some computer models, the amount of space debris "has reached a tipping point, with enough currently in orbit to continually collide and create even more debris, raising the risk of spacecraft failures". The report called for international regulations limiting debris and research of disposal methods.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-14757926 Space junk at tipping point, says report], BBC News, 2 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The plot of episode 4 ("Conflict") of Gerry Anderson's 1970 TV series ''[[UFO (TV series)|UFO]]'' includes routine missions for the disposal of spent satellites by bombing.

''[[Salvage 1]]'' (1979 TV series) deals humorously with a scrap dealer who establish a space junk salvage company.

''[[Planetes]]'' is a manga (1999-2004) and anime series (2003-2004) that gives focus on a team which is responsible for the collection and disposal of space debris. The DVDs for the TV series include interviews with NASA's Orbital Debris Program Office.

In 2009, [[Rhett and Link|Rhett &amp; Link]] wrote a song called "Space Junk" and made an accompanying music video for the TV series ''[[Brink (TV series)|Brink]]''.  The lyrics refer to two men tasked to clean up debris such as satellites and expended rockets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fy7psIuJjc |author=Rhett &amp; Link |author-link=Rhett and Link |title=Space Junk Song |website=YouTube |type=video |accessdate=18 August 2018 |date=6 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'' is a 2013 survival film, directed by Alfonso Cuaron, about a disaster on a space mission caused by [[Kessler syndrome]].

'''Space tethers''' are long cables which can be used for propulsion, momentum exchange, stabilization and [[attitude control]], or maintaining the relative positions of the components of a large dispersed satellite/[[spacecraft]] sensor system.&lt;ref name= "handbook" /&gt; Depending on the mission objectives and altitude, [[spaceflight]] using this form of [[spacecraft propulsion]] is theorized to be significantly less expensive than spaceflight using [[rocket engine]]s.

==Main techniques==
Tether satellites might be used for various purposes, including research into [[Momentum exchange tether|tether propulsion]], [[Gravity-gradient stabilization|tidal stabilization]] and orbital plasma dynamics. Five main techniques for employing space tethers are in development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Finckenor|first=Miria|author2=AIAA Technical Committee |title=Space Tether|journal=Aerospace America|date=December 2005|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bilen|first=Sven|author2=AIAA Technical Committee |title=Space Tethers|journal=Aerospace America|date=December 2007|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Electrodynamic tether]]s'''
:Electrodynamic tethers are primarily used for propulsion.  These are conducting tethers that carry a current that can generate either [[thrust]] or [[aerodynamic drag|drag]] from a [[planetary magnetic field]], in much the same way as an [[electric motor]] does.
'''[[Momentum exchange tether]]s'''
:These can be either rotating tethers, or [[Skyhook (structure)|non-rotating tethers]], that capture an arriving spacecraft and then release it at a later time into a different orbit with a different velocity.  Momentum exchange tethers can be used for [[orbital maneuver]]ing, or as part of a planetary-surface-to-orbit / orbit-to-escape-velocity space transportation system.
'''[[Tethered formation flying]]'''
:This is typically a [[insulator (electrical)|non-conductive]] tether that accurately maintains a set distance between multiple space vehicles flying in formation.
'''[[Electric Sail|Electric sail]]'''
:A form of [[solar wind]] sail with electrically charged [[tether]]s that will be pushed by the momentum of solar wind [[ion]]s.
'''[[Universal Orbital Support System]]'''
:A concept for suspending an object from a tether orbiting in space.

Many uses for space tethers have been proposed, including deployment as [[space elevator]]s, as [[Skyhook (structure)|skyhooks]], and for doing propellant-free orbital transfers.

== History ==

[[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] once proposed a tower so tall that it reached into space, so that it would be held there by the rotation of the [[Earth]]. However, at the time, there was no realistic way to build it.

To try to solve the problems in ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'' (July 31, 1960), another Russian, [[Yuri Artsutanov]], wrote in greater detail about the idea of a tensile cable to be deployed from a [[geosynchronous satellite]], downwards towards the ground, and upwards away, keeping the cable balanced. This is the [[space elevator]] idea, a type of synchronous tether that would rotate with the earth. However, given the materials technology of the time, this too was impractical on Earth.

In the 1970s, [[Jerome Pearson]] independently conceived the idea of a space elevator, sometimes referred to as a synchronous tether,&lt;ref name="Pearson 2005"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/studies/final_report/1032Pearson.pdf| last=Pearson| date=2005| title=Lunar Space Elevators for Cislunar Space Development: Phase I Final Technical Report| first=Jerome| author2=Eugene Levin| author3=John Oldson| author4=Harry Wykes| last-author-amp=yes| format=PDF| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194808/http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/studies/final_report/1032Pearson.pdf| archivedate=2016-03-03| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in particular, analyzed a [[lunar elevator]] that can go through the [[Lagrange point|L1 and L2 points]], and this was found to be possible with materials then existing.

In 1977, [[Hans Moravec]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/1976.skyhook/papers/scable.pox|title=The Journal of the Astronautical Sciences, v25#4, pp. 307-322, Oct-Dec 1977|author=|date=|website=cmu.edu|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003034448/http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/1976.skyhook/papers/scable.pox|archivedate=3 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[Robert L. Forward]] investigated the physics of non-synchronous [[Skyhook (structure)|skyhooks]], also known as rotating skyhooks, and performed detailed simulations of tapered rotating tethers that could pick objects off, and place objects onto, the [[Moon]], [[Mars]] and other [[planets]], with little loss, or even a net gain of energy.&lt;ref name="nonsynch"&gt;{{Cite web |first=Hans |last=Moravec |url=http://www.mxertether.com/papers/architectures/nonsynch-skyhook-materials.pdf |title=Orbital Bridges |date=1986 |accessdate=Oct 10, 2010}}{{dead link |date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moravec87"&gt;Hans Moravec, [http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1987/skyhook.ltx "Non-Synchronous Orbital Skyhooks for the Moon and Mars with Conventional Materials"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.li/19991012232419/http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1987/skyhook.ltx |date=1999-10-12 }} (Hans Moravec's thoughts on skyhooks, tethers, rotovators, etc., as of 1987) (accessed 10 October 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Missions ===

[[Image:TiPS lg.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Graphic of the US Naval Research Laboratory's TiPS tether satellite. Only a small part of the 4&amp;nbsp;km tether is shown deployed.]]

{{main article|Space tether missions}}

A '''tether satellite''' is a [[satellite]] connected to another by a space tether. A number of satellites have been launched to test tether technologies, with varying degrees of success.

==Types==

There are many different (and overlapping) types of tether.

===Momentum exchange tethers, rotating===
{{main article|Momentum exchange tether}}

[[Momentum]] Exchange Tethers are one of many applications for space tethers.  Momentum Exchange Tethers come in two types; rotating and non-rotating.  A rotating tether will create a controlled force on the end-masses of the system due to centrifugal acceleration.  While the tether system rotates, the objects on either end of the tether will experience continuous acceleration; the magnitude of the acceleration depends on the length of the tether and the rotation rate. Momentum exchange occurs when an end body is released during the rotation.  The transfer of momentum to the released object will cause the rotating tether to lose energy, and thus lose velocity and altitude.  However, using [[electrodynamic tether]] thrusting, or [[ion propulsion]] the system can then re-boost itself with little or no expenditure of consumable reaction mass.

===Skyhook===
{{main article|Skyhook (structure)}}
[[File:Skyhooks.gif|thumb|right|A rotating and a tidally stabilised skyhook in orbit]]
A skyhook is a theoretical class of orbiting [[tether propulsion]] intended to lift payloads to high altitudes and speeds.&lt;ref&gt;H. Moravec, "A non-synchronous orbital skyhook".

===Electrodynamics===
[[Image:STS-75 Tethered Satellite System deployment.jpg|thumb|right|Medium close-up view, captured with a 70&amp;nbsp;mm camera, shows [[Tethered Satellite System]] deployment.]]
{{main article|Electrodynamic tether}}
'''Electrodynamic tethers''' are long conducting wires, such as one deployed from a [[tether satellite]], which can operate on electromagnetic principles as [[electrical generator|generators]], by converting their [[kinetic energy]] to [[electrical energy]], or as [[electric motor|motors]], converting electrical energy to kinetic energy.&lt;ref name= "handbook" /&gt; Electric potential is generated across a conductive tether by its motion through the earth's magnetic field. The choice of the metal [[electrical conductor|conductor]] to be used in an electrodynamic tether is determined by a variety of factors. Primary factors usually include high [[electrical conductivity]] and low [[density]]. Secondary factors, depending on the application, include cost, strength, and melting point.

An electrodynamic tether was profiled in the documentary film ''[[Orphans of Apollo]]'' as technology that was to be used to keep the Russian space station ''[[Mir]]'' in orbit.&lt;ref name="Orphans of Apollo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Orphans of Apollo|url=http://orphansofapollo.wordpress.com/|publisher=World Press|accessdate=30 January 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621125917/http://orphansofapollo.wordpress.com/|archivedate=21 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Foust&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foust|first=Jeff|title=Preview: Orphans of Apollo|journal=The Space Review|date=July 23, 2001|url=http://thespacereview.com/article/1176/1|accessdate=30 January 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205193306/http://thespacereview.com/article/1176/1|archivedate=5 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation flying===
{{main article|Tethered formation flying}}

This is the use of a (typically) non-conductive tether to connect multiple spacecraft. A proposed 2011 experiment to study the technique is the [[tempo3|Tethered Experiment for Mars inter-Planetary Operations (TEMPO³)]].

===Universal Orbital Support System===
{{main article|Universal Orbital Support System}}
[[File:Universal Orbital Support System.png|thumb|Example of a possible layout using the Universal Orbital Support System.]]
A theoretical type of non-rotating tethered satellite system, it is a concept for providing space-based support to things suspended above an astronomical object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2017/0329/A-20-mile-long-spacescraper-dangling-from-an-asteroid-Could-it-work|title=A 20-mile long 'spacescraper' dangling from an asteroid: Could it work?|last=Wood|first=Charlie|date=29 March 2017|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331170132/https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2017/0329/A-20-mile-long-spacescraper-dangling-from-an-asteroid-Could-it-work|archivedate=31 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The orbital system is a coupled mass system wherein the upper supporting mass (A) is placed in an orbit around a given celestial body such that it can support a suspended mass (B) at a specific height above the surface of the celestial body, but lower than (A).

==Technical difficulties==

===Gravitational gradient stabilization===

[[File:Fig11 Gravitational Gradient.PNG|thumb|right|Description of the forces contributing towards maintaining a gravity gradient alignment in a tether system]]

{{main article|Gravity-gradient stabilization}}

Instead of rotating end for end, tethers can also be kept straight by the slight difference in the strength of gravity over their length.

A non-rotating tether system has a stable orientation that is aligned along the local vertical (of the earth or other body). This can be understood by inspection of the figure below where two spacecraft at two different altitudes have been connected by a tether. Normally, each spacecraft would have a balance of gravitational (e.g. F&lt;sub&gt;g1&lt;/sub&gt;) and centrifugal (e.g. F&lt;sub&gt;c1&lt;/sub&gt;), but when tied together by a tether, these values begin to change with respect to one another. This phenomenon occurs because, without the tether, the higher-altitude mass would travel slower than the lower mass. The system must move at a single speed, so the tether must therefore slow down the lower mass and speed up the upper one.  The centrifugal force of the tethered upper body is increased, while that of the lower-altitude body is reduced. This results in the centrifugal force of the upper body and the gravitational force of the lower body being dominant.  This difference in forces naturally aligns the system along the local vertical, as seen in the figure.&lt;ref name=ref18&gt;Cosmo, M. L., Lorenzini, E. C., "Tethers in Space Handbook", NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, 1997, pp. 274-1-274 {{clarify|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atomic oxygen===
{{details|Atomic oxygen}}
Objects in low Earth orbit are subjected to noticeable erosion from atomic oxygen due to the high [[orbital speed]] with which the molecules strike as well as their high reactivity. This could quickly erode a tether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=539QDxp-rtQC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=space+tether+atomic+oxygen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T-u1bwY-WT&amp;sig=mT5zDCbORbM-5CBNgAyEnnZEVgg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwibvsig94jNAhUELhoKHS5QAAkQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=space%20tether%20atomic%20oxygen&amp;f=false|title=Space Tethers and Space Elevators}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Micrometeorites and space junk===

Simple single-strand tethers are susceptible to [[meteoroid|micrometeoroids]] and [[space debris|space junk]]. Several systems have since been proposed and tested to improve debris resistance:
* The US [[US Naval Research Laboratory|Naval Research Laboratory]] has successfully flown a long term 6&amp;nbsp;km long, 2-3mm diameter tether with an outer layer of Spectra 1000 braid and a core of acrylic yarn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ilrs.gsfc.nasa.gov/satellite_missions/list_of_satellites/tipn_general.html |title=TiPS: Missuion Objectives |accessdate=2011-10-06 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708055545/http://ilrs.gsfc.nasa.gov/satellite_missions/list_of_satellites/tipn_general.html |archivedate=July 8, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This satellite, the Tether Physics and Survivability Experiment (TiPS), was launched in June 1996 and remained in operation over 10 years, finally breaking in July 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.satobs.org/noss.html NOSS Launch Data] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928140415/http://www.satobs.org/noss.html |date=2011-09-28 }} (see NOSS 2-3, which deployed TiPS)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Robert P. Hoyt|Dr. Robert P. Hoyt]] patented an engineered circular net, such that a cut strand's strains would be redistributed automatically around the severed strand. This is called a [[Hoytether]].  Hoytethers have theoretical lifetimes of decades.
* Researchers with [[JAXA]] have also proposed net-based tethers for their future missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Large pieces of junk would still cut most tethers, including the improved versions listed here, but these are currently tracked on radar and have predictable orbits. A tether could be wiggled to dodge known pieces of junk, or thrusters used to change the orbit, avoiding a collision.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

== Construction ==

===Properties of useful materials===

[[Image:TSS-1R tether composition.png|thumb|right|alt=TSS-1R.|TSS-1R tether composition [NASA].]]

Tether properties and materials are dependent on the application. However, there are some common properties. To achieve maximum performance and low cost, tethers would need to be made of materials with the combination of high strength or electrical conductivity and low density. All space tethers are susceptible to space debris or micrometeroids. Therefore, system designers will need to decide whether or not a protective coating is needed, including relative to [[Ultraviolet|UV]] and [[atomic oxygen]]. Research is being conducted to assess the probability of a collision that would damage the tether [http://pdf.aiaa.org/getfile.cfm?urlX=4%3A7I%276D%26XY%22O%2CRA7KW4%5B%5DV%3A%5B%3D5%3A%28%20%0A&amp;urla=%25%2ARH%23%23P8%20%0A&amp;urlb=%21%2A%20%20%20%0A&amp;urlc=%21%2A0%20%20%0A&amp;urld=%28%2A%22%40%20%23%20%2AJUA%5C%20%0A&amp;urle=%27%28%22X%20%22%20%22%40T0%20%20%0A MAST].

For applications that exert high tensile forces on the tether, the materials need to be strong and light. Some current tether designs use crystalline plastics such as [[ultra high molecular weight polyethylene]], [[aramid]] or carbon fiber. A possible future material would be [[carbon nanotube]]s, which have an estimated [[tensile strength]] between 140 and 177 [[Orders of magnitude (pressure)|GPa]] (20.3-25.6 million psi), and a proven tensile strength in the range 50-60 GPa for some individual nanotubes. (A [[monocrystalline whisker|number of other materials obtain 10 to 20 GPa]] in some samples on the nano scale, but translating such strengths to the macro scale has been challenging so far, with, as of 2011, CNT-based ropes being an order of magnitude less strong, not yet stronger than more conventional carbon fiber on that scale).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science-wired.blogspot.com/2010/04/nanotube-fibers.html|title=Nanotube Fibers|author=|date=|website=science-wired.blogspot.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201233204/http://science-wired.blogspot.com/2010/04/nanotube-fibers.html|archivedate=1 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://apl.aip.org/resource/1/applab/v74/i21/p3152_s1?isAuthorized=no Tensile tests of ropes of very long aligned multiwall carbon nanotubes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722130146/http://apl.aip.org/resource/1/applab/v74/i21/p3152_s1?isAuthorized=no |date=2011-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121219010021/https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/mfyu/www/Documents/Publications/PRL1-2000.pdf Tensile Loading of Ropes of Single-Wall Carbon Nanotubes and their Mechanical Properties]&lt;/ref&gt;

For some applications, the tensile force on the tether is projected to be less than 15&amp;nbsp;lbs (&lt; 65 N)&lt;ref name= "TSS-1R Failure Investigation"&gt;NASA, [http://hdl.handle.net/2060/19970011947 TSS-1R Mission Failure Investigation Board], Final Report, May 31, 1996 (accessed 7 April 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Material selection in this case depends on the purpose of the mission and design constraints. Electrodynamic tethers, such as the one used on TSS-1R,{{clarify|date=March 2018}} may use thin copper wires for high conductivity (see [[Electrodynamic tether|EDT]]).

There are design equations for certain applications that may be used to aid designers in identifying typical quantities that drive material selection.

Space elevator equations typically use a "characteristic length", L&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, which is also known as its "self-support length" and is the length of untapered cable it can support in a constant 1 ''g'' gravity field.
:&lt;math&gt;L_c = \frac{\sigma}{\rho g}&lt;/math&gt;,
where σ is the stress limit (in pressure units) and ρ is the density of the material.

Hypersonic skyhook equations use the material's "specific velocity" which is equal to the maximum tangential velocity a spinning hoop can attain without breaking:
:&lt;math&gt;V = \sqrt{\frac{\sigma}{\rho}}&lt;/math&gt;

For rotating tethers (rotovators) the value used is the material’s ‘characteristic velocity’ which is the maximum tip velocity a rotating untapered cable can attain without breaking,
:&lt;math&gt;V_c = \sqrt{\frac{2\sigma}{\rho}}&lt;/math&gt;
The characteristic velocity equals the specific velocity multiplied by the square root of two.

These values are used in equations similar to the [[rocket equation]] and are analogous to specific impulse or exhaust velocity. The higher these values are, the more efficient and lighter the tether can be in relation to the payloads that they can carry. Eventually however, the mass of the tether propulsion system will be limited at the low end by other factors such as momentum storage.

===Shape===

====Tapering====

For gravity stabilised tethers, to exceed the self-support length the tether material can be tapered so that the cross-sectional area varies with the total load at each point along the length of the cable. In practice this means that the central tether structure needs to be thicker than the tips. Correct tapering ensures that the tensile stress at every point in the cable is exactly the same. For very demanding applications, such as an Earth space elevator, the tapering can reduce the excessive ratios of cable weight to payload weight.

====Thickness====

For rotating tethers not significantly affected by gravity, the thickness also varies, and it can be shown that the area, A, is given as a function of r (the distance from the centre) as follows:&lt;ref name=lunarforward&gt;[http://www.tethers.com/papers/LEO2Lunar%2792.pdf "Tether Transport from LEO to the Lunar Surface", R. L. Forward, AIAA Paper 91-2322, 27th Joint Propulsion Conference, 1991] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517191711/http://www.tethers.com/papers/LEO2Lunar'92.pdf |date=2011-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A(r) = \frac {M v^2} {T R} \mathrm{e} ^ { \frac {\delta} {T} \frac {v^2} {2} \left( 1-\frac {r^2} {R^2} \right) } &lt;/math&gt;
where R is the radius of tether, v is the velocity with respect to the centre, M is the tip mass, &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is the material density, and T is the design tensile strength ([[Young's modulus]] divided by safety factor).

====Mass ratio====

[[File:Spinning tethers.png|thumb|right|Graph of tether mass to payload ratio versus the tip speed in multiples of the characteristic speed of the material]]

Integrating the area to give the volume and multiplying by the density and dividing by the payload mass gives a payload mass / tether mass ratio of:&lt;ref name=lunarforward/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac M m = \sqrt { \pi \frac { \delta } T \frac {V^2} {2} } \mathrm{e}^{ \left( \frac { \delta } T \frac {V^2} {2} \right) } \mathrm{erf} \left( \sqrt { \frac { \delta } T \frac { V^2 } {2} } \right)&lt;/math&gt;
where erf is the normal probability [[error function]].

Let &lt;math&gt;V_r = V / V_c \,&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;V_c = \sqrt { \frac {2 T} \delta }&lt;/math&gt;
then:&lt;ref&gt;Non-Synchronous Orbital Skyhooks for the Moon and Mars with Conventional Materials - [[Hans Moravec]]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac M m = \sqrt { \pi } V_r \mathrm{e}^{ {V_r}^2 } \mathrm{erf} ( {V_r} ) &lt;/math&gt;
This equation can be compared with the [[rocket equation]], which is proportional to a simple exponent on a velocity, rather than a velocity squared. This difference effectively limits the delta-v that can be obtained from a single tether.

===Redundancy===

In addition the cable shape must be constructed to withstand micrometeorites and [[space debris|space junk]]. This can be achieved with the use of redundant cables, such as the [[Hoytether]]; redundancy can ensure that it is very unlikely that multiple redundant cables would be damaged near the same point on the cable, and hence a very large amount of total damage can occur over different parts of the cable before failure occurs.

===Material strength===

Beanstalks and rotovators are currently limited by the strengths of available materials.  Although ultra-high strength plastic fibers ([[Kevlar]] and [[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene#Fiber applications|Spectra]]) permit rotovators to pluck masses from the surface of the Moon and Mars, a rotovator from these materials cannot lift from the surface of the Earth. In theory, high flying, [[supersonic]] (or [[hypersonic]]) aircraft could deliver a payload to a rotovator that dipped into Earth's upper atmosphere briefly at predictable locations throughout the tropic (and temperate) zone of Earth. As of May 2013, all mechanical tethers (orbital and elevators) are on hold until stronger materials are available.&lt;ref name="on hold"&gt;Jillian Scharr, "Space Elevators On Hold At Least Until Stronger Materials Are Available, Experts Say", Huffington Post, May 29, 2013 {{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/29/space-elevators-stronger-materials_n_3353697.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302234815/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/29/space-elevators-stronger-materials_n_3353697.html |archivedate=2014-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cargo capture===

Cargo capture for rotovators is nontrivial, and failure to capture can cause problems. Several systems have been proposed, such as shooting nets at the cargo, but all add weight, complexity, and another failure mode. At least one lab scale demonstration of a working grapple system has been achieved however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/news/releases/2005/05-108.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126035813/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/news/releases/2005/05-108.html |archivedate=2010-11-26 |df= }} NASA Engineers, Tennessee College Students Successfully Demonstrate Catch Mechanism for Future Space Tether&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life expectancy===

Currently, the strongest materials in tension are plastics that require a coating for protection from UV radiation and (depending on the orbit) erosion by atomic oxygen. Disposal of [[waste heat]] is difficult in a [[vacuum]], so [[thermal shock|overheating]] may cause tether failures or damage.

==Control and modelling==

===Pendular motion instability===

Electrodynamic tethers deployed along the local vertical ('hanging tethers') may suffer from dynamical instability. Pendular motion causes the tether vibration amplitude to build up under the action of electromagnetic interaction. As the mission time increases, this behavior can compromise the performance of the system. Over a few weeks, electrodynamic tethers in Earth orbit might build up vibrations in many modes, as their orbit interacts with irregularities in magnetic and gravitational fields.

One plan to control the vibrations is to actively vary the tether current to counteract the growth of the vibrations. Electrodynamic tethers can be stabilized by reducing their current when it would feed the oscillations, and increasing it when it opposes oscillations.  Simulations have demonstrated that this can control tether vibration.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} This approach requires sensors to measure tether vibrations, which can either be an [[inertial navigation system]] on one end of the tether, or [[satellite navigation]] systems mounted on the tether, transmitting their positions to a receiver on the end.

Another proposed method is to use spinning electrodynamic tethers instead of hanging tethers. The gyroscopic effect provides passive stabilisation, avoiding the instability.

===Surges===
As mentioned earlier, conductive tethers have failed from unexpected current surges. Unexpected [[electrostatic discharge]]s have cut tethers (e.g. see Tethered Satellite System Reflight (TSS‑1R) on [[STS-75|STS‑75]]), damaged electronics, and welded tether handling machinery. It may be that the Earth's magnetic field is not as homogeneous as some engineers have believed.

===Vibrations===

Computer models frequently show tethers can snap due to vibration.

Mechanical tether-handling equipment is often surprisingly heavy, with complex controls to damp vibrations.  The one ton climber proposed by Dr. Brad Edwards for his Space Elevator may detect and suppress most vibrations by changing speed and direction. The climber can also repair or augment a tether by spinning more strands.

The vibration modes that may be a problem include skipping rope, transverse, longitudinal, and pendulum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/tether/dynamics.html Tether dynamics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717015440/http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/TETHER/Dynamics.html |date=2007-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tethers are nearly always tapered, and this can greatly amplify the movement at the thinnest tip in whip-like ways.

===Other issues===

A tether is not a spherical object, and has significant extent. This means that as an extended object, it is not directly modelable as a point source, and this means that the [[center of mass]] and [[center of gravity]] are not usually colocated. Thus the inverse square law does not apply except at large distances, to the overall behaviour of a tether. Hence the orbits are not completely Keplerian, and in some cases they are actually chaotic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/3453325/Ultra_Long_Orbital_Tethers_Behave_Highly_Non-Keplerian_and_Unstable |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004124204/http://www.academia.edu/3453325/Ultra_Long_Orbital_Tethers_Behave_Highly_Non-Keplerian_and_Unstable |archivedate=2017-10-04 |df= }} Ultra Long Orbital WSEAS TRANSACTIONS on MATHEMATICS: Tethers Behave Highly Non-Keplerian and Unstable- Daniele Mortari&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[Non-rocket spacelaunch#Bolo|bolus]] designs, rotation of the cable interacting with the non linear gravity fields found in elliptical orbits can cause exchange of orbital angular momentum and rotation angular momentum. This can make prediction and modelling extremely complex.

A '''style guide''' (or '''manual of style''') is a set of standards for the writing and design of documents, either for general use or for a specific publication, organization, or field.  (It is often called a '''style sheet''', though that term has other meanings.)

A style guide establishes and enforces [[wikt:style#Noun|style]] to improve [[communication]]. To do that, it ensures [[wikt:consistency#Noun|consistency]] within a document and across multiple documents and enforces [[best practice]] in [[usage]] and in [[Composition (language)|language composition]], [[Composition (visual arts)|visual composition]], [[orthography]] and [[typography]]. For [[Academic publishing|academic]] and [[Technical communication|technical]] documents, a guide may also enforce the best practice in [[ethics]] (such as [[authorship]], [[research ethics]], and [[:wikt:disclosure|disclosure]]), [[pedagogy]] (such as [[expository writing|exposition]] and clarity), and compliance ([[Technical standard|technical]] and [[Regulatory compliance|regulatory]]).

Style guides are common for general and specialized use, for the general reading and writing audience, and for students and scholars of various [[Academia|academic]] disciplines, medicine, journalism, the law, government, business, and specific industries. '''House style''' refers to the internal style manual of a particular publisher or organization.

==Varieties==
Style guides vary widely in scope and size.

===Sizes===
This variety in scope and length is enabled by the cascading of one style over another, in a way analogous to how styles cascade [[style sheet (web development)|in web development]] and [[style sheet (desktop publishing)|in desktop publishing]] (e.g., how inline styles in [[HTML]] cascade over [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] styles).

A short style guide is often called a ''style sheet''. A comprehensive guide tends to be long and is often called a ''style manual'' or ''manual of style'' (''MOS'' or ''MoS'').  In many cases, a project such as one [[book]], [[academic journal|journal]], or [[monograph]] series typically has a short style sheet that cascades over the somewhat larger style guide of an organization such as a [[publishing]] company, whose content is usually called ''house style''. Most house styles, in turn, cascade over an ''industry-wide or profession-wide style manual'' that is even more comprehensive. Some examples of these industry style guides include the following: 
* [[AP Stylebook|AP style]] for journalism and most forms of corporate communications
* [[United States Government Printing Office#GPO's Style Manual|USGPO style]] or [[Australian Government Publishing Service|AGPS style]] for government publications 
* [[Hart's Rules|Oxford style]] and [[The Chicago Manual of Style|Chicago style]] for academic publishing and readership 
* [[APA style]] and [[ASA style]] for the social sciences 
* [[CSE style]] for various physical sciences 
* [[ACS style]] for chemistry 
* [[AMA Manual of Style|AMA style]] for medicine 
* [[Bluebook]] style for law

Finally, these reference works cascade over the [[orthography|orthographic]] norms of the language in use (for example, [[English orthography]] for English-language publications). This, of course, may be subject to national variety such as [[comparison of American and British English|the different varieties of American English and British English]].

=== Topics ===
Some style guides focus on specific topic areas such as [[graphic design]], including [[typography]]. Website style guides cover a publication's visual and technical aspects along with text.

Style guides that cover [[usage]] may suggest ways of describing people that avoid [[racism]], [[sexism]], and [[homophobia]]. Guides in specific scientific and technical fields cover [[nomenclature]], which specifies names or classifying labels that are preferred because they are clear, standardized, and [[ontology|ontologically]] sound (e.g., [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[chemical nomenclature]], and [[gene nomenclature]]).

==Updating==
Most style guides are revised periodically to accommodate changes in conventions and [[usage]]. The frequency of updating and the [[revision control]] are determined by the subject matter. For style manuals in [[reference work]] format, new [[edition (book)|editions]] typically appear every 1 to 20 years. For example, the [[AP Stylebook]] is revised annually, and the Chicago, APA, and ASA manuals are in their 17th, 6th, and 4th editions, respectively. Many house styles and individual project styles change more frequently, especially for new projects.

==Examples==
{{further|List of style guides}}

===International===
Several basic style guides for technical and scientific communication have been defined by international [[standards organization]]s. One example is [[ISO 215]] ''Documentation &amp;mdash; Presentation of contributions to periodicals and other serials''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=4086 |title=ISO 215:1986 - Documentation - Presentation of contributions to periodicals and other serials |publisher=Iso.org |date=2012-09-19 |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
The [[European Union]] publishes an ''Interinstitutional style guide''—encompassing [[Languages of the European Union#Official EU languages|24 languages]] across the European Union. This manual is "obligatory" for all those employed by the institutions of the EU who are involved in preparing EU documents and works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-360400.htm|title= Interinstitutional Style Guide|author= Publications Office of the European Union|date= 24 July 2008|work= Europa|publisher= European Union12 May 2010|ref= Eur08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Directorate-General for Translation (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Translation]] of the [[European Commission]] publishes its own ''English Style Guide'', intended primarily for English-language authors and translators, but aiming to serve a wider readership as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/english-resources-english-style-guide_en|title= English Style Guide|author= Directorate-General for Translation (European Commission)|publisher= European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the United States, most public-facing corporate communication and journalism writing is written with styles following ''[[The Associated Press Stylebook]]''.&lt;ref&gt;June Casagrande, ''Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite'' (New York: Penguin, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Book publishers and authors of journals requiring reference sections generally choose the [[Chicago Manual of Style]], while scholarly writing often follows the ''[[The MLA Style Manual|MLA Style Manual and Guide to Scholarly Publishing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mla.org/style "What Is MLA Style?"], ''[[Modern Language Association|mla.org]]'', [[Modern Language Association]], 2011, Web, 31 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;   One of the most popular grammar guides used in third-person writing is ''[[The Elements of Style]]''. The Associated Press Stylebook is written to be used together with The Elements of Style to provide a very complete grammar and English style reference with no conflicts.

{{refimprove|date=February 2014}}

A '''technical standard''' is an established [[norm (social)|norm]] or [[requirement]] in regard to technical [[system]]s. It is usually a formal document that establishes uniform engineering or technical criteria, methods, processes, and practices. In contrast, a custom, [[Convention (norm)|convention]], company product, corporate standard, and so forth that becomes generally accepted and dominant is often called a [[de facto standard|''de facto'' standard]]. 

A technical standard may be developed privately or unilaterally, for example by a corporation, regulatory body, military, etc.  Standards can also be developed by groups such as trade unions and trade associations. [[Standards organizations]] often have more diverse input and usually develop voluntary standards: these might become mandatory if adopted by a government (i.e., through [[legislation]]), business contract, etc.

The [[standardization]] process may be by edict or may involve the formal consensus&lt;ref&gt;Example of [https://archive.is/20120913132347/http://www.tappi.org/s_tappi/doc.asp?CID=107&amp;DID=551843 TAPPI standards development regulations]&lt;/ref&gt; of technical experts.

==Types==
The primary types of technical standards are:
* A ''standard [[specification]]'' is an explicit set of requirements for an item, material, component, system or service. It is often used to formalize the technical aspects of a procurement agreement or [[contract]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Standard Specifications|url=http://www.oregon.gov/odot/hwy/specs/pages/standard_specifications.aspx|website=Oregon.gov|publisher=Oregon.gov|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, there may be a specification for a turbine blade for a jet engine that defines the exact material and performance requirements.
* A ''standard [[test method]]'' describes a definitive procedure that produces a test result.  It may involve making a careful personal observation or conducting a highly technical measurement. For example, a [[physical property]] of a material is often affected by the precise method of testing: any reference to the property should therefore reference the test method used.
* A ''standard practice'' or procedure gives a set of instructions for performing operations or functions. For example, there are detailed [[standard operating procedure]]s for operation of a nuclear power plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Operational Limits and Conditions and Operating Procedures for Nuclear Power Plants Safety Guide|url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/books/IAEABooks/6064/Operational-Limits-and-Conditions-and-Operating-Procedures-for-Nuclear-Power-Plants-Safety-Guide|website=International Atomic Energy Association|publisher=IAEA|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A ''standard guide'' is general information or options that do not require a specific course of action.
* A ''standard [[definition]]'' is formally established terminology.
* ''Standard [[units of measurement|units]]'', in [[physics]] and [[applied mathematics]], are commonly accepted measurements of physical quantities.

==Availability==
Technical standards may exist as:
* Public documents on the [[internet]], public library, etc. (Some technical standards may be found at a major central library or at the library of a good technical university)
* Published documents available for purchase
* Private documents owned by an organization or corporation, used and circulated as the owner determines necessary or useful
* Documents publicly available under [[intellectual property]] ([[copyright]], etc.)&lt;ref&gt;Example: [http://www.sae.org/about/copyright/ SAE International copyright policy]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Closed or controlled documents that contain [[trade secret]]s or [[classified information]]

==Geographic levels==
When a geographically defined community must solve a community-wide [[coordination problem]], it can adopt an existing standard or produce a new one. The main geographic levels are:
* ''National standard'': by [[Standards organizations#National_standards_organizations|National standards organizations]].  For example, [[Telecommunications Industry Association]] standards.
* ''Regional standard'': see standards of the [[Standards organizations#Regional_standards_organizations|Regional standards organizations]]. For example, [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]] standards.
* ''[[International standard]]'': see [[Standards organizations#International_standards_organizations|International standards organizations]] Example, [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] and [[ASTM International]].

National/Regional/International standards is one way of overcoming technical barriers in inter-local or inter-regional commerce caused by differences among technical regulations and standards developed independently and separately by each local, local [[standards organisation]], or local company. Technical barriers arise when different groups come together, each with a large user base, doing some well established thing that between them is mutually incompatible. Establishing national/regional/international standards is one way of preventing or overcoming this problem.

==Usage==
The existence of a published standard does not imply that it is always useful or correct. For example, if an item complies with a certain standard, there is not necessarily assurance that it is fit for any particular use. The people who use the item or service (engineers, trade unions, etc.) or specify it (building codes, government, industry, etc.) have the responsibility to consider the available standards, specify the correct one, enforce compliance, and use the item correctly. [[Validation and verification|Validation]] of suitability is necessary.

Standards often get reviewed, revised and updated on a regular basis.  It is critical that the most current version of a published standard be used or referenced.  The originator or standard writing body often has the current versions listed on its web site. 

In [[social sciences]], including [[economics]], a standard is useful if it is a solution to a [[coordination problem]]: 
it emerges from situations in which all parties realize mutual gains, but only by making mutually consistent decisions.  '''Examples''': 
{| class="wikitable"
!Parties
!Mutual gains
!Problem
!Solution
|-
|[[Secondary sector of the economy|Mechanical industry]] companies
|[[Supply chain|Suppliers]] interchange, stock gains, etc.
|[[Screw#Thread_standards|Screw thread]] compatibility

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4964">Business and technology alignment, or just '''technology alignment''', corrects terminology and assumptions used in business to better match those of technology and standards anticipated in the [[technology strategy]] and [[technology roadmap]]s.  

== Changes terminology ==
When technology is changing very rapidly in an industry, the aligning of business terms to the distinctions that the technology requires tends to dominate any [[enterprise taxonomy]] development effort.  In such circumstances, [[consultant]]s or specific technology training is usually required, as the organization lacks the internal skills or experience with the technologies that it expects to be using soon.

== Example: government ==
In [[government]], for example, citizen use of the [[Internet]] and the increased availability of [[telework]]ers has presented special challenges and opportunities, typically called "[[e-government]]".  At the same time, internal operational efficiencies have become more of a priority due to rising competition between jurisdictions.  Often the first step is to limit the number of different departments or agencies involved.  By "consolidating the technology operations of 91 state agencies into the [[Virginia Information Technology Agency]], the State of Virginia estimates an eventual savings of nearly $100 million a year." - [https://web.archive.org/web/20060923031105/http://cpr.ca.gov/report/cprrpt/issrec/stops/it/so01.htm#6b] 

"Similarly, the [[U.S. National Performance Review]] recommended a data processing consolidation and modernization initiative citing industry experience suggesting operational savings of between 30% and 50%." - [https://web.archive.org/web/20060923031105/http://cpr.ca.gov/report/cprrpt/issrec/stops/it/so01.htm#7b]

While "California is the cradle of the information technology industry" its own state government claims that "collaborative exploration and exploitation of emerging technologies is extremely rare within state government", accordingly it seeks to "[[customer relationship management|improve customer relationships]] through [[online service]]s."  However such efforts tend to rely very much on driving personalities and [[leadership]].  After one resignation, the state "lost the vision and executive sponsorship that contributed to its success and the national recognition of California's emerging eGovernment activities."  This is a major problem in all technology alignment.

In Canada, a similar nationwide effort called [[Service Canada]] has similar goals, and has run into similar problems:  "The big complaints are that departments fight over their turf and are organized to serve the bureaucracy, not Canadians. They don’t [[data dictionary|share data]], [[enterprise taxonomy|information]], [[Information Infrastructure|common infrastructure]], [[information technology|technology]] or integrate their [[business process]]es.  Senior bureaucrats are often accused of being out of touch with the needs of Canadians." - [http://openpolitics.ca/Service+Canada]  The government claims that it "is expected to save C$3 billion over five years by automating manual operations, consolidating [[call centre]]s and reducing overpayments in [[Canada Pension Plan]] and employment service."  It "will need to spend about C$500 million for technology, consolidate or move offices and retrain the thousands of workers whose jobs were eliminated by automation."

When, as in California or Canada, new leadership and massive change to operations is required, technology alignment may simply excuse a massive [[business process reengineering]] and [[Layoff|downsizing]] exercise.  This too is a common situation in technology alignment:  using the fact of new technology as a pretext for other large changes.

However, as with all such exercises, there are claims that better service will result, by (in Canada) "opening new offices and creating more front-line jobs in local communities" or (in California) "a 20% reduction in the workforce performing shared services" and of "nearly 9,000 state employees... about 3,600 are engaged in common core functions. An eventual 20% reduction in this workforce segment is possible through attrition when phased in over 5 years." - [https://web.archive.org/web/20060923031105/http://cpr.ca.gov/report/cprrpt/issrec/stops/it/so01.htm#69b]

These claims also are fairly typical:  despite a longstanding admission among experts that there is a "[[productivity paradox]]", the introduction of new information technology and more automated work processes are always assumed to be "more efficient" than what they replace.  Accordingly, technology alignment is probably not a passing fad, but, seems to be driven by factors built into business and technology culture.

[[File:Arm-robotic 010 final.png|thumb|150px|A conceptional science fiction prosthetic/robotic arm.]]
'''Technology in science fiction''' examines the possibilities and implications of new technological concepts.  Authors have taken, or created, new innovations and technologies, and elaborated on what they might be and how they might be used.  This exchange goes in both directions – sometimes the technology appears first in science fiction, then becomes reality (such as [[interplanetary spaceflight|space travel]]) and other times the real technology comes first, and science fiction authors speculate about how it might be used, and how it might affect the human condition.  Likewise, the accuracy of the technology portrayed spans a wide range – sometimes it is existing technology, sometimes it is a physically realistic portrayal of a far-out technology, and sometimes it is simply a plot device that looks scientific, but has no basis in science.  Examples drawn from space travel in science fiction include:
*Realistic case:  [[Space suit]]s.  These are almost always based on existing suits, or near-term extrapolation of their capabilities.
*Extrapolation:  Travel within the [[Solar System]].  As of 2018, humans have only travelled in Earth orbit or from Earth to Moon and back. However, travelling within the Solar System violates no physical principles.
*Plot device: [[faster-than-light drive]].  It is unsupported by physics as we know it, but needed for galaxy-wide or intergalactic plots with human lifespans.

== Fictional technologies that have since been realized ==
Almost every new technology that becomes practical was previously used in science fiction. The following are a few examples, from a very large set:

'''Transparent Aluminum''' as featured in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe has since become a reality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123012131 | title=Air Force testing new transparent armor}}&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Aluminium oxynitride]] ([[ALONtm]]), patented in 1985,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?vid=4520116 |title=Patent US4520116 - Transparent aluminum oxynitride and method of manufacture| accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as different from metallic aluminum as [[rust]] is from [[iron]]. Rather than being used as transparent blast shielding as in the fictional [[Starship Enterprise|Enterprise]] class starships, this transparent ceramic is used, as the chemically similar (and similarly expensive) [[corundum]] (crystalline aluminum oxide) has long been used, in tough windows.

'''Tractor/Repulsor Beams''' have been realized as Laser-based [[Optical tweezers]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Optical Tweezers]] an Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently as a pair of [[Bessel beam]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physicscentral.com/buzz/blog/index.cfm?postid=4633845616090952216 |title=The One Where NASA Asks for a Tractor Beam}}&lt;/ref&gt; These instruments use the radiation from the laser beam to manipulate microscopic particles in what is called an "[[optical trap]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physicscentral.com/buzz/blog/index.cfm?postid=4633845616090952216 |title=The One Where NASA Asks for a Tractor Beam}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2222525/Real-life-Star-Trek-tractor-beam-developed--wont-dragging-space-ships-time-soon.html |title=Real life Star Trek tractor beam developed - but it won't be dragging space ships any time soon | location=London | work=Daily Mail |first=Damien |last=Gayle |date=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; along the length of the beam as desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physicscentral.com/buzz/blog/index.cfm?postid=4633845616090952216 |title=The One Where NASA Asks for a Tractor Beam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fictional Tractor beams have been prominently used in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' universe and in the ''Star Trek'' universe.  In an early scene of ''[[Star Wars: A New Hope]]'' a large spaceship uses such a beam to seize a small one, in order to capture the protagonists.

'''Artificial Vision/Prosthetic Eyes''' [[Visual prosthesis]] has been a topic of experiments since the late 20th century. 

Notable characters using artificial vision include all characters from the [[Ghost in the Shell]] series who use prosthetic bodies e.g. [[Batou]]'s ranger eyes, [[Saito (Ghost in the Shell)|Saito]]'s left eye, and [[Motoko Kusanagi]]'s artificial eyes, [[Geordi La Forge]] from the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' series who made use of a [[VISOR]] and later; ocular implants, [[RoboCop]] from the RoboCop series, [[Spike Spiegel]] from the [[Cowboy Bebop]] anime series, and the [[Illusive Man]] from the [[Mass Effect]] series of videogames.


'''Tricorder''' The Lab-On-a-Chip Application Development Portable Test System ([[LOCAD]]-PTS) used by astronauts on the International Space Station is designed specifically to biochemical molecules with the purpose of "identifying microbes on space station services" through use of the [[Gram Staining]] Method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2008/09may_tricorder/ | title=Space StationTricorder  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though less advanced than the fictional [[tricorder]] of the ''Star Trek'' series, the LOCAD-PTS is useful for quickly identifying bacteria and fungi on the International Space Station without having to send samples back to Earth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2008/09may_tricorder/ | title=Space StationTricorder  }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus risking contamination or degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2008/09may_tricorder/ | title=Space StationTricorder  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fungi have proven to be a hazard if left unchecked on the space station as they managed to decompose some Russian electronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2008/09may_tricorder/ | title=Space StationTricorder  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tricorder featured in the ''Star Trek'' universe was capable of measuring almost anything, from the chemical composition of explosives, to the life signs of a dying humanoid. The LOCAD-PTS does not differentiate between live and dead test material yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2008/09may_tricorder/ | title=Space StationTricorder  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spaceflight ==
Since the principles of rocketry were worked out in the early 20th century, writers have used straightforward extrapolation to support stories of interplanetary exploration, colonization, conquest and so forth.

With new developments in space exploration and technology the idea of space exploration became a reality.  Though many writers explored space travel before these events and inventions, the reality of new technologies and the evidence that space exploration was now possible opened new doors to create more fantastical ideas of space travel.  Many Science Fiction topics are born from reality, but turn these new technologies to create imagined realities, thus creating Science Fiction in itself.

[[File:Apollo 11 Saturn V lifting off on July 16, 1969.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Saturn V]] carrying ''[[Apollo 11]]'' to the Moon, blasting off on July 16, 1969]]

1903 – The [[Wright brothers]] invented the first motored and manned airplane, launching the age of human flight  

1920s – [[Robert Goddard]] and [[Wernher von Braun]] developed liquid-fueled rockets, later applied as the [[V-2 rocket|V2]] in war. Fictional spaceships of the 1950s were typically shaped like the V2. Later long range missiles influenced later fiction.

The [[Space Race]] between the US and Soviet Union inspired more precise depiction of technology already under development.

The launch of the first man-made object to orbit Earth; [[USSR]]'s [[Sputnik 1]] (October 4, 1957)

[[Space station]]s, first presented in crude form by [[The Brick Moon]], were popularized in the 1960s by books agitating for further development. Those little resembled the [[Salyut 1]] or later actual stations. [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)]] presented the "[[rotating wheel space station]]" of the 1960s but few others did. The long-running fictional [[Deep Space Nine (space station)]] and [[Babylon 5 (space station)]] little resembled any of the above.

=== Faster than light ===
Galactic-scale stories usually call for [[interstellar travel]] in human lifetimes, which is not supported by existing science, so this technology is more speculative. Among the earliest introductions to this concept include E.E. "Doc" Smith's element X-powered spaceship in the ''Skylark''  and [[Lensman series]] (1920s).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science Fiction After 1900: From the Steam Man to the Stars|last=Landon|first=Brooks|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=0415938880|location=New York|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called X solution unlocked the atomic power of copper, which is then used to power an advanced propulsion system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In these narratives, the ships are "inertia-less"; this [[Inertialess drive]] makes travel effortless at huge multiples of the speed of light.

The faster-than-light travel was also explained in [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[Foundation series|''Foundation'' series]] and became a familiar term thereafter particularly since the concept was also used by the ''Star Wars'' films as well as other fictional intergalactic narratives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Science and Technology Communication, Volume 1|last=Priest|first=Susanna|publisher=SAGE|year=2010|isbn=9781412959209|location=Los Angeles, CA|pages=705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hyperspace''' commonly designates one class of technology, where infinite speeds are possible; a ship may jump to [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyper space]] or star drive "clutching at the very fabric of time itself" thus making travel that would normally take thousands of years possible in no time at all. One example of narrative descriptions for hyperspace was [[John E. Stith|John E Stith]]'s conceptualization in the novel ''Redshift Rendezvouz'' (1990). The author described that a spacecraft operating in a hyperspace moves at exactly 1,024 times the speed of light relative to normal space time, with the speed of light lower than 300,000 kilometers per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Slow Light: Invisibility, Teleportation, And Other Mysteries Of Light|last=Sidney|first=Perkowitz|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2011|isbn=9781848167520|location=London|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanical life/Androids/Robots ==

While now (as of 2017) there are companies that are fully devoted to creating robots and artificial intelligence,  these ideas were long present in science fiction before they started to become real technology.  Mechanical and artificial characters were derived both from extrapolations of real engineering efforts, and from the whims and imaginations of the authors. This technology has given writers, as well as other forms of art, the inspiration to create non-human characters.

===Definitions===

'''[[Artificial Intelligence]]'''
(also known as '''machine intelligence''' and often abbreviated as '''AI''') is intelligence exhibited by any manufactured (not grown) system. The term is often applied to general-purpose computers and also in the field of scientific investigation into the theory and practical application of AI.

'''A [[robot]]''' is an electro-mechanical or bio-mechanical device or group of devices that can perform autonomous or preprogrammed tasks.

'''An [[android (robot)|android]]''' is a robot made to resemble a human, usually both in appearance and behavior. The word derives from the Greek andr-, " meaning "man, male", and the suffix -eides, used to mean "of the species; alike" (from eidos "species").

'''A [[cyborg]]''' is a cybernetic organism which adds to or enhances its abilities by using technology.

== ESP/Psychic powers/Psi phenomena ==

With new developments in science and technology helping to study and promote parapsychology or Psi Phenomena, many SF writers felt the need to incorporate and elaborate on these subjects in their stories.  While technology helped the investigation into Psi Phenomena it also created questions that many SF writers chose to answer, through their stories, in their own unique way.  If we look at some of the examples of Psi Phenomena prominent in stories, they may have stemmed from how science would take this experimentation with Psi Phenomena and use it. In Stephen King's "The Dead Zone", we see how precognition was used to affect political candidates.  The idea that someone could harness this power and use it for good or evil was one that many SF writer's elaborated on.  In "The Foreign Hand Tie" by Randall Garret espionage takes on a new form via telepathy through twins.  When science and technology can be used to anchor something in reality, via experimentation or exploration, and yield results, it creates controversy that society may fear or even fantasize about.  Throughout SF history, Psi Phenomena can be seen to be used for good and evil, and through new science and technological discoveries, this genre then becomes more real and more elaborate.

=== Terms commonly used ===

*[[Telepathy]]: the ability to read minds
*[[Precognition]]: the ability to see the future
*[[Telekinesis]]: the ability to move objects with mental force (Psychokinesis (PK for short) or "mind over matter")
*[[Teleportation]]: the ability to move oneself from one place to the other, or back and forward in time
*Telempathy: Emotion-reading
*[[Remote viewing]]/[[Clairvoyance]]/[[Scrying]]: the ability for seeing things not actually before your eyes
*[[Psychometry (paranormal)|Psychometry]]: the ability to sense what has touched a certain physical object or the imprint it has left behind
*[[Bilocation]]: the ability to be in two places at the same time.
*[[Pyrokinesis]]: the capability to start fires by mental action alone

===Writers to mention these topics===

* G. H. Ryan: "Fifteen Months in the Moon" (1880)
* Fitz James O’Brien: "The Bohemian" (1885)
* [[Arthur C. Clarke]]: [[Childhood's End]] (1953) Parapsychology determines, in the end, the fate of the human race.

* [[Zenna Henderson]]: "Ararat" (1952: The first of "The People" stories, about psi-gifted aliens who live on Earth)
* [[Murray Leinster]]: "The Leader" (1960): Long-distance mass-hypnotism

===Brief history of psi phenomena in science===

While [[Extra-sensory perception|ESP]] and belief in other powers were, in the beginning, mainly fueled by [[superstitions]], [[religion]] and tradition, the dawn of [[science]] brought about a way to analyze and study these supposed "powers" giving them an anchor in reality.  The [[Scientific Revolution]] featured ideas that life should be "led by reason" and that, "the universe as a mechanistic, deterministic system could eventually be known accurately and fully through observation and reason".  While new science and technology gave rise to skepticism towards the existence of [[psi phenomena]], it also gave way for new technologies to be applied in either proving or disproving such phenomena.  One of the first experimental approaches to Psi Phenomena started in the 1930s and was conducted under the direction of [[J.B. Rhine]] (1895–1980).  Rhine popularized the now famous methodology of card guessing and dice rolling experiments in a laboratory in attempt to find statistical validation for ESP.  In 1957 the [[Parapsychological Association]] was formed at the preeminent society for [[parapsychology]].  Openness to new parapsychology studies and occult phenomena continued to rise in the 1970s.

===Technological developments===

*The [[Random Number Generator]]
*Ganzfeld Experiment: homogenous, unpatterened, sensory stimulation to produce an effect similar to sensory deprivation
*Development of statistical tools by R. A. Fisher in the 1920s

===Timeline of probable influences===

E. Dawson Rogers hopes to gain new respectability for [[spiritualism]] and founds [[Society for Psychical Research]] in 1882

Government investigations into parapsychology: [[Project Star Gate]], formed in 1970 with cooperation from the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and [[Defense Intelligence Agency]], investigates remote viewing, sees nothing useful

==Visitors from other planets==
[[Extraterrestrial life]] is a familiar topic in fiction.  In the centuries since astronomers discovered that planets are worlds, people have speculated on the possibility of life existing there, though [[xenobiology]] has remained a science without a subject.  However, people from afar, or alien creatures with various powers and purposes, provided fresh new material for fiction.  Some stories were about friendly visitors who got along with humans, such as the aliens in the [[Keroro Gunsou]] series, when they give up on attempting to take over planet Earth.  Others made [[alien invasion]] their theme, as in the 1898 novel, [[War of the Worlds]].  [[Meteorite]]s have long shown that foreign bodies sometimes enter Earth's atmosphere, and the term "[[flying saucer]]" was coined in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.brumac.8k.com/KARNOLD/KARNOLD.html | title=JUNE 24, 1947: HOW IT ALL BEGAN The Story of the Arnold Sighting}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several science fiction novels used them.
===Early writers===
*''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' by [[H. G. Wells]], first serialised in 1897
*''[[Martians, Go Home]]'' by [[Fredric Brown]], 1956
*''The Moon that Vanished'' by [[Leigh Brackett]], 1950
*''3 From Out There'' by [[Leo Margulies]], 1959
*''[[To Outrun Doomsday]]'' by [[Kenneth Bulmer]], 1957
*''Venus Stories'' by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], 1955

===Other terms===

* NTI: Non-Terrestrial Intelligence (A term for alien life that dwells in the oceans or otherwise not on land)
*[[UFO]]: Unidentified Flying Object
*Flying Saucer: A certain kind of space ship

== Parallel worlds ==

The notion of parallel worlds have always intrigued different types of genres, especially the science fiction aspect. Many authors have used the idea of travelling back into prehistoric times or traveling forwards to an unknown universe. The idea of entering a world that has not been touched or that has evolved into a new incomprehensible parallel, makes people ponder about what it could looks like or what it could be. Authors have used this notion of an alternate reality and have created their own worlds that have given readers a different view of alternate worlds.

=== Early writers ===

*Sideways in Time by [[Murray Leinster]] Novel (1934)
*[[Lest Darkness Fall]] By L. Sprague De Camp Novel (1939)
*Horsesense Hank in the Parallel Worlds by [[Nelson S. Bond]] Magazine (1942)
*[[The Alteration]] by Kingsley Amis Novel (1976)
*[[The Anubis Gates]] By Tim Powers Novel (1983)

=== Definition ===
'''[[Parallel universe (fiction)|Parallel Universe]]''' Parallel universe or alternate reality in science fiction and fantasy is a self-contained separate reality coexisting with our own

===Other terms===

'''[[Multiverse]]''' Set of many universes. There are many specific uses of the concept, as well as systems in which a multiverse is proposed to exist in.

'''[[Parallel universe (fiction)|Parallel universe]]''' alternate universes, worlds, realities and dimensions in fiction.

'''[[Parallel universe (fiction)|Alternate reality]]''' alternate universes, worlds, realities and dimensions in fiction.

'''[[Alternate future]]''' is a possible future which never comes to pass, typically because someone travels back into the past and alters it so that the events of the alternate future cannot occur.

== Invisibility ==
[[File:Hollywood steps out (34).png|thumb|INVISIBILITY]]
The idea of being unseen and hence undetectable has fascinated mankind for generations. This concept has generated scientific pursuit towards defying our physical parameters. Many authors have toyed with the idea of gaining invisibility via both science-based and fictional means.  Invisibility in the actual scientific world will be a very difficult achievement, one that will involve much more complication than we have begun to delve into. Further technological developments bring us closer to our goal, while also broadening the horizon for science fiction authors performing thought experiments on the topic of invisibility.

=== Mythology and folklore precursors ===

Many myths and legends include [[gods]], [[spirit]]s, [[angels]], and [[demons]] that are often invisible or can choose to become invisible at will.

*One of the first stories to explore the idea of invisibility was in [[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]''. A peasant finds a ring in the tomb of a dead king that allows him to become invisible. He enters the palace, seduces the queen, and plots to kill the present king, showing that power such as invisibility corrupts.
*[[Perseus]], the Greek mythic hero who helped establish the Twelve Olympians, was equipped with a [[cap of invisibility]] to kill [[Medusa]].

===Early writers===

*[[H. G. Wells]] wrote ''[[The Invisible Man]]'' (1897) which was the first science fiction novel to explore the idea of invisibility. The invisible man is a scientist named Griffin who theorizes that if a person's [[refractive index]] is changed to exactly that of air and his body does not absorb or reflect light, then he will not be visible. He successfully carries out this procedure on himself, but cannot become visible again, leading to mental instability.
*[[J. R. R. Tolkien]] wrote ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' series which revolves around the function of a ring that renders the user invisible. Unfortunately, it had an evil influence with negative effects on the wearer's actions.
*[[Douglas Adams]] wrote ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' (1978) novels which encompass a humorous concept of a field which makes people believe the object in question is "somebody else's problem" and therefore do not see it. This concept as explained in the book, bases off of a statement to the effect that actual invisibility is impossible and that the field is merely a way to make something close to being invisible by actually making it hard to notice deliberately.
*[[Philip K. Dick]] wrote in his 1974 novel A ''[[Scanner Darkly]]'' of a "scramble suit." This is a flexible sheath covering the body of the wearer with a reflective/refractive coating on the inside surface that transfers the camouflaging pattern- projected by a [[holographic lens]] mounted on the wearer's head- onto the outside surface of the sheath causing a camouflage-like invisibility.

===Definition===
[[Invisibility]] is a term that is usually used as a fantasy or science fiction term where objects are literally made unseeable by magical or technological means.

===Invisibility in science fiction===
There is an undeniable link between science fact and the ideas that emerge in science fiction. Science fiction authors are inspired by actual scientific and technological discoveries, but allow themselves the freedom to project the possible future course of these discoveries and their potential impact on society, perhaps only weakly bound to the facts.

===Invisibility in fiction===
Authors are faced with obstacles presented by the realities of actual technology, however fiction allows a window for the opportunity of inventing completely imaginary technologies to move their storyline forward and maybe even still explore the outcomes of such power.

*Magic objects such as rings and cloaks can be worn to grant the wearer permanent invisibility.
*Spells and potions can be used or cast upon people or objects granting temporary invisibility.

=== Timeline of possible influences ===

* 17th century the refractive index was developed. Major advances near the end of the 19th century raised author's awareness.
* 1670s Emitting or reflecting light outside the [[wavelength]] range of [[visible light]] would result in a human-shaped [[black hole]] which would be completely opaque.
* 1930s [[Chroma key]] began to develop which is the removal of color from one image to reveal another image "behind it." The removed color becomes transparent, which is also called "color keying."
* 1938 [[Stealth technology]] began to develop. It is used with aircraft, ships, and missiles, in order to make them less visible to certain detection methods.
* 1966 An enemy in a ''[[Star Trek]]'' episode uses a [[Cloaking device]]. Other fiction has used a [[cloak of invisibility]].

{{History of science and technology in the United States}}
A '''timeline of United States inventions (1946–1991)''' encompasses the ingenuity and innovative advancements of the United States within a historical context, dating from the era of the [[Cold War]], which have been achieved by inventors who are either native-born or naturalized [[citizens of the United States]]. Copyright protection secures a person's right to his or her [[First to file and first to invent|first-to-invent]] [[Claim (patent)|claim]] of the ''original'' invention in question, highlighted in [[Copyright Clause|Article I, Section 8, Clause 8 of the United States Constitution]] which gives the following [[enumerated power]] to the [[United States Congress]]:

'''1946 [[Space observatory]]'''
[[File:Hubble 01.jpg|180px|left|thumb|The Hubble Space Telescope]]
A space observatory is any instrument, such as a telescope, in outer space which is used for observation of distant [[planets]], [[galaxies]], and other [[outer space]] objects. In 1946, American theoretical astrophysicist [[Lyman Spitzer]] was proposed the idea of a telescope in outer space, a decade before the [[Soviet Union]] launched the first [[artificial satellite]], ''[[Sputnik]]'' into orbit. However, German scientist Hermann Oberth had first conceived the idea of a space based telescope.&lt;ref name="hubblesite.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hubble Essentials: About Lyman Spitzer, Jr.|publisher=Hubble Site|url=http://hubblesite.org/the_telescope/hubble_essentials/lyman_spitzer.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spitzer's proposal called for a large telescope that would not be hindered by Earth's [[atmosphere]].&lt;ref name="hubblesite.org"/&gt; After lobbying in the 1960s and 1970s for such a system to be built, Spitzer's vision ultimately materialized into the world's first space-based optical telescope, ''[[Hubble Space Telescope]]'', which was launched on April 20, 1990 by the [[Space Shuttle Discovery|Space Shuttle ''Discovery'']] (STS-31).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hubble Essentials: Quick Facts|publisher=Hubble Site|url=http://hubblesite.org/the_telescope/hubble_essentials/quick_facts.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hubble Space Telescope |publisher=Vic Stathopoulos |url=http://www.aerospaceguide.net/hubblespacetelescope.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225053139/http://www.aerospaceguide.net/hubblespacetelescope.html |archivedate=December 25, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1946 [[Blowout preventer#Annular blowout preventer|Blowout preventer (annular)]]'''

An annular blowout preventer is a large valve that uses a wedge to seal off a wellhead. It has a donut-like rubber seal, known as an elastomeric packing unit, reinforced with steel ribs. During drilling or well interventions, the valve may be closed if overpressure from an underground zone causes formation fluids such as oil or natural gas to enter the wellbore and threaten the rig. The annular blowout preventer was invented by Granville Sloan Knox in 1946 who received a patent on September 9, 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CONTROL HEAD AND BLOWOUT PREVENTER|publisher=Google Patents|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=VT5dAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1946 [[Tupperware]]'''
[[File:Small authentic tupperware.JPG|180px|left|thumb|Tupperware]]
Tupperware is airtight plastic containers used for the preparation, storage, containment, and serving of perishable food in the kitchen and home. Tupperware was invented in 1946 by American chemist [[Earl Silas Tupper]] who devised a method of purifying black [[polyethylene]] slag, a waste product produced in oil refinement, into a molded substance that was flexible, tough, non-porous, non-greasy and translucent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Earl S.

'''1946 [[Spoonplug]]'''

A spoonplug is a form of fishing lure. The spoonplug was invented by Elwood L. "Buck" Perry, then a physics and math teacher in Hickory, North Carolina. Elwood Perry combined science with a logical approach to fishing to create a "total fishing system." He is credited as being the father of structure fishing and was later inducted into the [[National Freshwater Fishing Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Little Fishing History|publisher=Dennis "Sunshine" Skurulsky|url=http://www.mainmarine.com/articles/fishinghistory.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1946 [[Saw chain#Chipper teeth|Chipper teeth]]'''
[[File:Oregon10.JPG|180px|left|thumb|An example of chipper teeth]]

A chipper teeth is a variant of a saw chain used on a [[chainsaw]]. Using a tooth that is curled over the top of the chain, there are alternate teeth which point left and right. In 1946, American logger [[Joseph Buford Cox]] of Portland, Oregon invented chipper teeth, which is still widely used today and represents one of the biggest influences in the history of timber harvesting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of the Chainsaw|publisher=Chainsaw Sculptors|url=http://www.chainsawcarvinghistory.com/chainsaw_history/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1946 [[Filament tape]]'''

Filament tape or strapping tape is a [[pressure-sensitive tape]] used for several packaging functions such as closing corrugated fiberboard boxes, reinforcing packages, bundling items, pallet utilizing, etc. It consists of a pressure-sensitive adhesive coated onto a backing material which is usually a polypropylene or polyester film and fiberglass filaments embedded to add high tensile strength. Filament tape was invented in 1946 by Cyrus Woodrow Bemmels. In 1949, it was placed on the market and was an immediate success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1999 Hall of Fame Inductees|publisher=New Jersey Inventors Hall of Fame|url=http://www.njit.edu/v2/News/Releases/3383b.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519123159/http://www.njit.edu/v2/News/Releases/3383b.html|archivedate=May 19, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1946 [[Credit card]]'''
* A credit card is part of a system of payments named after the small plastic card issued to users of the system. The issuer of the card grants a line of credit to the consumer from which the user can borrow money for payment to a merchant or as a cash advance to the user. In 1946, American banker John C. Biggins of the Flatbush National Bank of Brooklyn invented the first bank-issued credit card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Firsts: Origins of Everyday Things That Changed the World|publisher=Penguin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXT0MyOjhnIC&amp;pg=PT55&amp;dq=John+Biggins+and+credit+card&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6KeaT4GODon28gSJhJD-Dg&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=John%20Biggins%20and%20credit%20card&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Financial System|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0OM0Z5TkrP4C&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=John+Biggins+and+credit+card&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6KeaT4GODon28gSJhJD-Dg&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=John%20Biggins%20and%20credit%20card&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Debtor's Dictionary: The American Encyclopedia of Consumer Credit|publisher=Wheatmark, Inc.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I3uiLuTgbu8C&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=John+Biggins+and+credit+card&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6KeaT4GODon28gSJhJD-Dg&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=John%20Biggins%20and%20credit%20card&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1946 [[Diaper|Diaper (waterproof)]]'''
* A diaper or nappy is an absorbent garment for incontinent people. The dampless or waterproof diaper was invented in 1946 when [[Marion Donovan]] used a shower curtain from her bathroom to create the "Boater", the first re-usable and leak-proof diaper that contained plastic-lined cloth. Donovan's other innovation was replacing safety pins with plastic snaps on the sides of diapers. First sold in 1949 at Saks Fifth Avenue's flagship store in New York City, patents were later issued in 1951 to Donovan who later sold the rights to the waterproof diaper for $1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Marion Donovan, 81, Solver Of the Damp-Diaper Problem|publisher=New York City Times|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DE5DD1630F93BA25752C1A96E958260 | date=November 18, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1947 [[Transistor]]'''
[[File:Replica-of-first-transistor.jpg|180px|left|thumb|A replica of the first working transistor.]]
In electronics, a transistor is a semiconductor device commonly used to amplify or switch electronic signals. Because the controlled output power can be much larger than the controlling input power, the transistor provides amplification of a signal. The transistor is the fundamental building block of all modern electronic devices, and is used in radio, telephone, computer, and other electronic systems. From November 17, 1947 to December 23, 1947, [[John Bardeen]] and [[Walter Brattain]] at AT&amp;T Bell Labs, underwent experimentations and finally observed that when two gold point contacts were applied to a crystal of germanium, a signal was produced whereby the output power was larger than the input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=November 17 – December 23, 1947: Invention of the First Transistor|publisher=American Physical Society|url=http://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200011/history.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manager of the Bell Labs semiconductor research group, [[William Shockley]], saw the potential in this and worked over the next few months greatly expanding the knowledge of semiconductors in order to construct the first point-contact transistor. Shockley is considered by many to be the "father" of the transistor.&lt;ref name="The New York Times Company"/&gt; Hence, in recognition of his work, the transistor is widely, yet not universally acknowledged as the most important invention of the entire 20th century since it forms today's building blocks of processors found and used in almost every modern computing and electronics device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The transistor: The 20th century's most important invention|publisher=IDG Communications|url=http://www.arnnet.com.au/article/202801/transistor_20th_century_most_important_invention}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of their invention of the transistor, Shockley, Bardeen and Brattain were jointly awarded the 1956 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1956|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1956/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1947 [[Defibrillator]]'''

'''1948 [[Rogallo wing]]'''
[[File:Parawing.jpg|180px|left|thumb|Rogallo's flexible wing, which was tested by NASA as a steerable parachute to retrieve ''Gemini'' space capsules and retrieve used rocket stages.]]
The Rogallo wing is a flexible type of [[airfoil]] composed of two partial conic surfaces with both cones pointing forward. Neither a kite, glider, or a type of aircraft, the Rogallo wing is most often seen in toy kites, but has been used to construct spacecraft parachutes during preliminary testing for NASA's ''[[Project Gemini|Gemini program]]'' in the early 1960s, dirigible parachutes, ultralight powered aircraft like the trike, as well as hang gliders. Before the end of 1948, American aeronautical engineer [[Francis Rogallo]] had succeeded in inventing the first fully successful flexible-wing kite that he called the 'Flexi-Kite'. A patent was applied for in 1948 and granted in 1951. His wife,  [[Gertrude Rogallo]], also made a significant impact upon the invention, having sewed the fabric into the required dimensions that used household items like kitchen curtains. Rogallo believed that flexible wings provided more stability than fixed surfaces, leading to an elimination of rigid spars during flight. Because of this, Rogallo's concepts are seen as classics examples of purity and efficiency in aviation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Genius of Rogallo's Wing|publisher=M Robinson|url=http://kitehistory.com/Miscellaneous/rogallo.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Francis Rogallo: invented the Rogallo wing|publisher=The Sunday Times|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article6852741.ece | location=London|date=September 29, 2009|first=Sadie|last=Gray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1948 [[Flying disc]]'''

Flying discs are disc-shaped objects thrown and caught for recreation, which are generally plastic and roughly 20 to 25 centimeters (8–10&amp;nbsp;inches) in diameter, with a lip. The shape of the disc, an airfoil in cross-section, allows it to fly by generating lift as it moves through the air while rotating. First known as the "Whirlo-Way", the flying disc was invented in 1949 by [[Walter Frederick Morrison]] who combined his fascination with invention and his interest in flight. Carved from a solid block of a plastic compound known as "Tenite," Morrison sold his flying disc invention to WHAM–O, which introduced it in 1957 as the "Pluto Platter." In 1958, WHAM–O modified the "Pluto Platter" and rebranded it as a Frisbee flying disc to the world. It became an instant sensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Frisbee|publisher=Frisbee Disc|url=http://www.frisbeedisc.com/about/pressroom/newsitems/30facts.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1950 [[Snowmaking|Artificial snowmaking]]'''
[[File:Schneekanone.JPG|180px|left|thumb|A rear view of a snow cannon with its fan showing]]
Snowmaking is the artificial production of snow by forcing water and pressurized air through a "snow gun" or "snow cannon", on ski slopes. Snowmaking is mainly used at ski resorts to supplement natural snow. This allows ski resorts to improve the reliability of their snow cover and to extend their ski seasons. The costly production of snowmaking requires low temperatures. The threshold temperature for snowmaking decreases as humidity decreases. Machine-made snow was first co-invented by three engineers—Art Hunt, Dave Richey and Wayne Pierce of Milford, Connecticut on March 14, 1950. Their patented invention of the first "snow cannon" used a garden hose, a 10-horsepower compressor, and a spray-gun nozzle, which produced about 20&amp;nbsp;inches of snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Machines Let Resorts Please Skiers When Nature Won't|publisher=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/08/technology/machines-let-resorts-please-skiers-when-nature-won-t.html?pagewanted=1 | first=Jeffrey | last=Selingo | date=February 8, 2001 | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1950 [[Hamming code]]'''
* In telecommunication, a Hamming code is a linear error-correcting code. Hamming codes can detect up to two simultaneous bit errors, and correct single-bit errors; thus, reliable communication is possible when the Hamming distance between the transmitted and received bit patterns is less than or equal to one. By contrast, the simple parity code cannot correct errors, and can only detect an odd number of errors. Hamming codes are of fundamental importance in coding theory and remain of practical use in modern computer design. Hamming codes were invented in 1950 by [[Richard Hamming]] at Bell Labs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Richard Wesley Hamming|publisher=University of St. Andrews|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Hamming.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A cool box, cooler, portable ice chest, chilly bin, or esky most commonly is an insulated box used to keep perishable food or beverages cool. Ice cubes, which are very cold, are most commonly placed in it to make the things inside stay cool. Ice packs are sometimes used, as they either contain the melting water inside, or have a gel sealed inside that also stays cold longer than plain water. The cooler was invented in 1951 by Richard C. Laramy of Joliet, Illinois. Laramy filed a patent for the cooler on February 24, 1951 and was issued U.S. patent #2,663,157 on December 22, 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portable Ice Chest for Storing Foods|publisher=Google Patents|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=RHdXAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4&amp;source=gbs_overview_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1951 [[Wetsuit]]'''
* A wetsuit is a garment, usually made of foamed neoprene, which is worn by divers, windsurfers, canoeists, and others engaged in water sports, providing thermal insulation, abrasion resistance and buoyancy. The insulation properties depend on bubbles of gas enclosed within the material, which reduce its ability to conduct heat. The bubbles also give the wetsuit a low density, providing buoyancy in water. The wetsuit was invented in 1951 by the University of California at Berkeley physicist named [[Hugh Bradner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wetsuit's Inventor Dies|publisher=Tech Media Network|url=http://www.livescience.com/history/080509-wetsuit-inventor.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1952 [[Airbag]]'''
[[File:Airbag SEAT Ibiza.jpg|180px|left|thumb|A deflated airbag on a steering wheel after a traffic accident]]
An air bag is a safety feature designed to protect automobile passengers in a head-on collision. Most cars today have driver's side airbags and many have one on the passenger side as well. Located in the steering wheel assembly on the driver's side and in the dashboard on the passenger side, the air bag device responds within milliseconds of a crash. The original safety cushion was first created by John W. Hetrick in 1952. After a car accident that his family was involved in, Hetrick drew sketches of compressed air stored in a container. When a spring-loaded weight senses the car decelerating at a rapid enough rate, it opens a valve that allows the pressure in the container to fill a bag. With this knowledge, he developed his design until he was able to obtain a patent on the device on August 5, 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airbags|publisher=Bryant University|url=http://web.bryant.edu/~ehu/h364proj/sprg_97/dirksen/airbags.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1967, Dr. Allen S.

'''1956 [[Operating system|Operating system (batch processing)]] '''

An operating system (OS) is software (programs and data) that runs on computers and manages the computer hardware and provides common services for efficient execution of various application software. For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between application programs and the computer hardware, although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware, but will frequently call the OS or be interrupted by it. Operating systems are found on almost any device that contains a computer—from cellular phones and video game consoles to supercomputers and web servers. The [[GM-NAA I/O]], created by [[Owen Mock]] and Bob Patrick of General Motors Research Laboratories in early 1956 (or late 1955) for their [[IBM 701]] mainframe computer is generally considered to be the first "[[batch processing]]" operating system and possibly the first "real" operating system. Rudimentary forms of operating systems existed before batch processing, the [[Input/Output Control System]] (IOCS) being one example. However, what specifically differentiated and made the GM-NAA I/O as the first of its kind was that instead of having a human operator manually load each program as what previous systems were only capable of doing, computerized software as used on GM-NAA I/O, thereafter handled the scheduling, management, and multi-tasking of all computer applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of operating systems|publisher=OS Data|url=http://www.osdata.com/kind/history.htm#batchsystems}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1956 [[Fortran]]'''

A skid loader or skid steer loader is a small rigid frame, engine-powered machine with lift arms used to attach a wide variety of labor-saving tools or attachments. Though sometimes they are equipped with tracks, skid-steer loaders are typically four-wheel drive vehicles that can push material from one location to another, carry material in its bucket, or load material into a truck or trailer. Brothers Louis and Cyrill Keller co-invented the first skid-steer loader, which was based around a three-wheeled loader they developed in 1957 for a turkey farmer near Rothsay, Minnesota. In September 1958, they were hired by the Melroe brothers at [[Melroe Manufacturing Company]] in Gwinner, North Dakota, which was later to become [[Bobcat Company]]. Using the brothers' design, Melroe introduced the M60 Self-Propelled Loader and, in 1960, Louis added a rear drive axle, resulting in the M400 model, the world's first true skid-steer loader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bobcat Mourns Passing of Skid-Steer Inventor|publisher=Bobcat|url=http://www.bobcat.eu/bobcat/eu-en/news/corporate-news/bobcat-mourns-passing.page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laser light is usually spatially coherent, which means that the light either is emitted in a narrow, low-divergence beam, or can be converted into one with the help of optical components such as lenses. Lasers are used to read compact discs and bar codes, guide missiles, remove ulcers, fabricate steel, precisely measure the distance from Earth to the Moon, record ultradefined images of brain tissue, entertain people in light shows and do thousands of other things. In 1957, American physicist [[Gordon Gould]] first theorized the idea and use of laser technology. Despite a 20-year battle with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, Gould is now widely associated as the original inventor of laser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laser|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/gould.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Charles H. Townes]] and [[Arthur L. Schawlow]], scientists at Bell Laboratories, wrote a paper, ''Infrared and Optical Masers'' in 1958 that was enormously influential on the theory of lasers. Ironically, Gould, Townes, or Schawlow never built the first working laser. On July 7, 1960, American physicist [[Theodore H. Maiman]] created and built the first laser. The core of his laser consisted of a man-made ruby as the active medium, a material that had been judged unsuitable by other scientists who rejected crystal cores in favor of various gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Theodore Maiman, 79, Dies; Demonstrated First Laser|publisher=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/obituaries/11maiman.htmlm | first=Douglas|last=Martin|date=May 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1957 [[Confocal microscopy]]'''
* Confocal microscopy is an optical imaging technique used to increase micrograph contrast and to reconstruct three-dimensional images by using a spatial pinhole to eliminate out-of-focus light or flare in specimens that are thicker than the focal plane. This technique has gained popularity in the scientific and industrial communities. Typical applications include life sciences and semiconductor inspection. The principle of confocal imaging was invented and patented by [[Marvin Minsky]] in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Memoir on Inventing the Confocal Scanning Microscope|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|url=http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/papers/ConfocalMemoir.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1961 [[Spreadsheet|Spreadsheet (electronic)]]'''
* An electronic spreadsheet organizes data information into computerized software defined columns and rows. Primarily used for business and accounting purposes, the data can then be "added up" by a formula to give a total or sum. The spreadsheet program summarizes information from many paper sources in one place and presents the information in a format to help a decision maker see the financial "big picture" of a company. Spreadsheets in paper format have been used by accountants for hundreds of years. However, computerized, electronic spreadsheets are of much more recent origin. In 1961, [[Richard Mattessich]], a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, pioneered the concept of electronic spreadsheets for use in business accounting. In the autumn of 1978, Harvard Business School student, [[Dan Bricklin]], came up with the idea for an interactive visible calculator. Bricklin and [[Bob Frankston]] then co-invented the software program [[VisiCalc]], the world's first "[[killer application]]" and electronic spreadsheet for use on personal computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Spreadsheets|publisher=Decision Support Systems Resources|url=http://dssresources.com/history/sshistory.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dan Bricklin, Co-Inventor of the Spreadsheet, Discusses How Nerds Are Like Sports Stars|publisher=The New York Observer|url=http://www.observer.com/2009/media/dan-bricklin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1963 [[Computer mouse]]'''
[[File:SRI Computer Mouse.jpg|180px|left|thumb|The first computer mouse]]
In computing, a mouse is a pointing device that functions by detecting two-dimensional motion relative to its supporting surface. The mouse's motion typically translates into the motion of a pointer on a display, which allows for fine control of a Graphical User Interface. [[Douglas Engelbart]] invented the computer mouse at the [[Augmentation Research Center]], funded by the Department of Defense's [[Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (now [[DARPA]]) in 1963. The first mouse was carved from wood and tracked motion via two wheels mounted on the bottom. Later on, a ball instead of two wheels was employed. The concept was soon overtaken by a modern and more technologically advanced [[optical mouse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1963: Douglas Engelbart Invents the Mouse|publisher=University of California at Berkeley|url=http://coe.berkeley.edu/about/history-and-traditions/1963-douglas-engelbart.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727135521/http://coe.berkeley.edu/about/history-and-traditions/1963-douglas-engelbart.html/|archivedate=July 27, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1963 [[BASIC]]'''

In computer programming, BASIC is a family of high-level programming languages. The original BASIC was invented in 1963 by [[John George Kemeny]] and [[Thomas Eugene Kurtz]] at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire to provide computer access to non-science students. At the time, nearly all use of computers required writing custom software, which was something only scientists and mathematicians tended to be able to do. The language and its variants became widespread on microcomputers in the late 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John G.

'''1964 [[Buffalo wings]]'''
[[File:Buffalowingsplate.jpg|180px|left|thumb|Buffalo Wings, coated in Italian bread crumbs, deep fried, with butter, vinegar, and Tabasco hot sauce and chunky bleu cheese dressing dipping sauce]]
A Buffalo wing, hot wing or wing is a chicken wing section (drumette or flat) that is traditionally fried unbreaded and then coated in sauce. Classic Buffalo-style chicken wing sauce is composed of a vinegar-based cayenne pepper hot sauce and butter. They are traditionally served with celery sticks and [[blue cheese dressing]]. Buffalo wings get their name from where they were invented, at the [[Anchor Bar]] in Buffalo, New York. In 1964, Teresa Bellissimo at the family-owned Anchor Bar, covered  chicken wings in her own special sauce and served them with a side of blue cheese and celery. In 1980, Frank Bellissimo, the husband of Teresa, told ''[[The New Yorker]]'' that her buffalo wings were invented out of necessity because the restaurant had gotten an overstock of chicken wings instead of other chicken parts that the couple didn't know what to do with. On the other hand, Dominic Bellissimo, the son of Frank and Teresa, disputed this story. Dominic claimed that the wings were an impromptu midnight snack that his mother created on his request while drinking with friends. Whatever the story, all of the Bellissimos have since died so there is no way to verify how buffalo wings were invented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Buffalo WIngs|publisher=Time Magazine|url= http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1920434,00.html|date=September 3, 2009| accessdate=April 30, 2011|first=Claire|last=Suddath}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1964 [[Plasma display]]'''

A plasma display panel is a flat panel display common to large TV displays. Many tiny cells between two panels of glass hold an inert mixture of noble gases. The gas in the cells is electrically turned into a plasma which then excites phosphors to emit light. The monochrome plasma video display was co-invented in July 1964 at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] by [[Donald Bitzer]], H.

Kevlar is the registered trademark for a light, strong para-aramid synthetic fiber. Typically it is spun into ropes or fabric sheets that can be used as such or as an ingredient in composite material components. Currently, Kevlar has many applications, ranging from bicycle tires and racing sails to body armor because of its high strength-to-weight ratio. Invented at DuPont in 1965 by [[Stephanie Kwolek]], Kevlar was first commercially used in the early 1970s as a replacement for steel in racing tires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inventor of Kevlar|publisher=Famous Women Inventors|url=http://www.women-inventors.com/Stephanie-Kwolek.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1965 [[Hypertext]]'''

Hypertext most often refers to text on a computer that will lead the user to other, related information on demand. It is a relatively recent innovation to user interfaces, which overcomes some of the limitations of written text. Rather than remaining static like traditional text, hypertext makes possible a dynamic organization of information through links and connections called hyperlinks. [[Ted Nelson]] coined the words "hypertext" and "hypermedia" in 1965 and invented the [[Hypertext Editing System]] in 1968 at Brown University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Visionary lays into the web|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1581891.stm | date=October 8, 2001 | accessdate=March 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1965 [[Cordless telephone]]'''
* A cordless telephone is a telephone with a wireless handset that communicates via radio waves with a base station connected to a fixed telephone line, usually within a limited range of its base station. The base station is on the subscriber premises, and attaches to the telephone network the same way a corded telephone does. In 1965, an American woman named Teri Pall invented the cordless telephone. Due to difficulties of marketing, Pall never patented her invention. [[George Sweigert]] of Euclid, Ohio had more success, thus receiving a patent for the cordless telephone in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Giving women tech know-how'|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6103512.stm | date=November 3, 2006 | accessdate=March 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1965 [[Space pen]]'''
* The Space Pen, also known as the Zero Gravity Pen, is a pen that uses pressurized ink cartridges and is claimed to write in zero gravity, upside down, underwater, over wet and greasy paper, at any angle, and in extreme temperature ranges. The ballpoint is made from tungsten carbide and is precisely fitted in order to avoid leaks. A sliding float separates the ink from the pressurized gas. The thixotropic ink in the hermetically sealed and pressurized reservoir is claimed to write for three times longer than a standard ballpoint pen. In 1965, the space pen was invented and patented by [[Paul C. Fisher]]. After two years of testing at NASA, the space pen was first used during the ''Apollo 7'' mission in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=History of the Fisher Space Pen|publisher=Allwrite B.V.|url=http://www.allwrite.nl/?incl=article-fisher-space-pen-history}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The belief that [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and Japanese scientists "invented" the compact disc is a misconception in the sense that Philips and Sony used Russell's underlying technology in order to develop a disc more refined, practical, smaller and sophisticated. In 1982, Sony and Philips had ''commercially'' introduced the compact disc, twelve years after Russell had already created a working prototype in 1970. By 1986, Optical Recording decided to legally act by suing Sony, Phillips, and Time Warner. Two years later, the company came to a licensing settlement with Sony and soon thereafter, agreements with Phillips and others soon followed, including a June 1992 court ruling that required Time Warner to pay Optical Recording $30 million due to [[patent infringement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bet you didn't know Jim Russell '53 pioneered compact disc technology|publisher=Reed College|url=http://web.reed.edu/reed_magazine/Nov2000/a_the_discoverer/3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Inventors and Inventions|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MHb-2zGomZYC&amp;pg=PA1285&amp;lpg=PA1285&amp;dq=james+russell+cd&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1966 [[Dynamic random access memory]]'''
* Dynamic random access memory is a type of random access memory that stores each bit of data in a separate capacitor within an integrated circuit. Since real capacitors leak charge, the information eventually fades unless the capacitor charge is refreshed periodically. Because of this refresh requirement, it is a dynamic memory as opposed to static random access memory and other static memory. In 1966 DRAM was invented by [[Robert Dennard]] at the IBM Thomas J.

'''1967 [[Backpack#Internal frame packs|Backpack (Internal frame)]]
* The internal frame backpack consists of strips of either metal or plastic that mold to one's back to provide a good fit, sometimes with additional metal stays to reinforce the frame. Usually a complex series of straps works with the frame to distribute the weight and hold it in place. The close fitting of the back section to the wearer's back allows the pack to be closely attached to the body, and gives a predictable movement of the load. The internal frame backpack was invented in 1967 by Greg Lowe, the founder of [[Lowe Alpine|Lowepro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Innovations|publisher=Lowepro|url=http://www.lowepro.com/innovation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Taser is an electroshock weapon that uses Electro-Muscular Disruption (EMD) technology to cause neuromuscular incapacitation (NMI) and strong muscle contractions through the involuntary stimulation of both the sensory nerves and the motor nerves. The Taser is not dependent on pain compliance, making it highly effective on subjects with high pain tolerance. For this reason it is preferred by law enforcement over traditional stun guns and other electronic control weapons. [[Jack Cover]], a NASA researcher, invented the Taser in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of TASER Devices|publisher=TASER International, Inc.|url=http://www.taser.com/research/Science/Pages/HistoryofTASERDevices.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326074042/http://www.taser.com/research/Science/Pages/HistoryofTASERDevices.aspx|archivedate=March 26, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1969 [[Charge coupled device]]'''
[[File:Delta-Doped Charged Coupled Devices (CCD) for Ultra-Violet and Visible Detection.jpg|180px|left|thumb|A specially developed charge coupled device used for ultraviolet imaging in a wire bonded package]]
A charge-coupled device (CCD) is a device for the movement of electrical charge, usually from within the device to an area where the charge can be manipulated. This is achieved by "shifting" the signals between stages within the device one at a time. CCDs move charge between capacitive bins in the device, with the shift allowing for the transfer of charge between bins. Often the device is integrated with an image sensor, such as a photoelectric device to produce the charge that is being read, thus making the CCD a major technology for digital imaging. First conceived in its usefulness for computer memory, the charge coupled device was co-invented in 1969 by American physicist [[George E. Smith]] and Canadian physicist [[Willard Boyle]] at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Willard Boyle and George Smith|publisher=Rochester Institute of Technology|url=http://www.cis.rit.edu/node/284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1969 [[Markup language]]'''
* A markup language is a modern system for annotating a text in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from that text. The idea and terminology evolved from the "marking up" of manuscripts. For example, the revision instructions by editors, traditionally written with a blue pencil on authors' manuscripts. A well-known example of a markup language in widespread use today is [[HyperText Markup Language]] (HTML), one of the key document formats of the [[World Wide Web]]. The origins of markup languages can be traced to a formatting language called [[RUNOFF]], developed in the 1960s by [[Jerome H. Saltzer]] at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. However, the very first markup language was called the [[Generalized Markup Language]] (GML) co-invented by IBM engineers [[Charles Goldfarb]], Ed Mosher, and Ray Lorie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of New Media: An Essential Reference to Communication and Technology|publisher=The Moshovitis Group|url=https://books.google.com/?id=26NyHREJwP8C&amp;pg=RA1-PT173&amp;lpg=RA1-PT173&amp;dq=markup+language+charles+goldfarb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-7619-2382-4|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1970 [[Surfboard leash|Surf leash]]'''
* A surfboard leash or leg rope is the cord that attaches a surfboard to the surfer. It prevents the surfboard from being swept away by waves and prevents a runaway surfboard from hitting other surfers and swimmers. Modern leashes comprise a urethane cord where one end has a band with a velcro strap attached to the surfer's trailing foot, and the opposite has a velcro strap attached to the tail end of the surfboard. The surfboard leash was invented in 1970 by Santa Cruz, California resident Pat O'Neill, son of wetsuit innovator [[Jack O'Neill (businessman)|Jack O'Neill]], who fastened surgical tubing to the nose of his surfboard with a suction cup looped to the end of his wrist in order to leverage turns and cutbacks in the water. However, modifications in 1971 by O'Neill made the surf leash attached to the ankle and to a surfboard's tail, a practice still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Surfing|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-DWQSYRx4MUC&amp;pg=PA580&amp;lpg=PA580&amp;dq=Pat+O'Neill+and+surf+leash&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UbdS8yTBCU&amp;sig=szKNacUCFA8NqYV-BY2GJqUFSLc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RAfXTb3SLeO_0AGs6qHRBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1972 [[Global Positioning System]]'''
[[File:Garmin GPSmap 76CS.jpg|180px|left|thumb|A GPS receiver for civilian use]]
The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space-based [[global navigation satellite system]] that provides reliable, [[three-dimensional]] positioning, navigation, and timing services to worldwide users on a continuous basis in all weather, day and night, anywhere on or near the Earth. 24 satellites orbit around the Earth twice a day, transmitting signaled information to [[GPS navigation device|GPS receivers]] that take this information and use triangulation to calculate the user's exact location. Ultimately, the GPS is the descendant of the United States Navy's ''[[Timation]]'' satellite program and the United States Air Force's ''621-B'' satellite program. The invention of GPS was a collaborative and team effort. The basic architecture of GPS was devised in less than a month in 1972 by Colonel [[Bradford Parkinson]], Mel Birnbaum, Bob Rennard, and Jim Spilker. However, Richard Easton, a son of [[Roger Easton]] who was the head of the U.S. Navy's ''Timation'' program, claims that his father invented GPS and filed U.S. patent #3,789,409 in 1974. Other names listed by Richard Easton are James Buisson, Thomas McCaskill, Don Lynch, Charles Bartholomew, Randolph Zwirn and, "an important outsider," Robert Kern.

'''1973 [[Recombinant DNA]]'''
* Recombinant DNA is a form of synthetic DNA that is engineered through the combination or insertion of one or more DNA strands, thereby combining DNA sequences that would not normally occur together. The Recombinant DNA technique was engineered by [[Stanley Norman Cohen]] and [[Herbert Boyer]] in 1973. They published their findings in a 1974 paper entitled "Construction of Biologically Functional Bacterial Plasmids in vitro", which described a technique to isolate and amplify genes or DNA segments and insert them into another cell with precision, creating a transgenic bacterium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stan Cohen and Herb Boyer "invented" recombinant DNA technology|publisher=DNA Learning Center|url=http://www.dnaftb.org/dnaftb/concept_34/con34bio.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1973 [[Mobile phone]]'''
[[File:SE K750i.jpg|180px|left|thumb|The mobile phone]]
A mobile phone, or cell phone, is a long-range, electronic device used for mobile voice or data communication over a network of specialized base stations known as cell sites. Early mobile FM radio telephones were in use for many years, but since the number of radio frequencies were very limited in any area, the number of phone calls were also very limited. To solve this problem, there could be many small areas called cells which share the same frequencies. When users moved from one area to another while calling, the call would have to be switched over automatically without losing the call. In this system, a small number of radio frequencies could accommodate a huge number of calls. The first mobile call was made from a car phone in St. Louis, Missouri on June 17, 1946, but the system was impractical from what is considered a portable handset today. The equipment weighed 80&amp;nbsp;lbs, and the AT&amp;T service, basically a massive party line, cost $30 per month plus 30 to 40 cents per local call.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tech Talk: Where'd it Come From, Anyway?|publisher=PC World|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/147698/tech_talk_whered_it_come_from_anyway.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic network and supporting infrastructure of hexagonal cells used to support a mobile telephony system while remaining on the same channel were devised by [[Douglas H. Ring]] and [[W. Rae Young]] at AT&amp;T Bell Labs in 1947. Finally in 1973, [[Martin Cooper (inventor)|Martin Cooper]] invented the first handheld cellular/mobile phone. His first mobile phone call was made to [[Joel S. Engel]] in April 1973.&lt;ref name="Engology.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Inventor of cell phone: We knew someday everybody would have one|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/mobile/07/09/cooper.cell.phone.inventor/index.html?hpt=C2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1973 [[Voicemail]]'''
* Voicemail is the managing of telephone messages from a centralized data storing system. Voicemail is stored on hard disk drives, media generally used by computers in order to store other forms of data. Messages are recorded in digitized natural human voice similar to how music is stored on a compact disc. To retrieve and to play back messages, a user calls the system from any phone, and his or her messages can be retrieved immediately. The first voicemail system, known as the Speech Filing System (SFS), was invented by Stephen J. Boies in 1973. What started as a research project at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, the first working prototype became available to telephone users in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Factors Challenges In Creating a Principal Support Office System The Speech Filing System Approach|publisher=IBM Thomas J.

'''1974 [[Heimlich maneuver]]'''
* Performing abdominal thrusts, better known as the Heimlich Maneuver, involves a rescuer standing behind a patient and using their hands to exert pressure on the bottom of the diaphragm. This compresses the lungs and exerts pressure on any object lodged in the trachea, hopefully expelling it. This amounts to an artificial cough. [[Henry Heimlich]], as the inventor of his abdominal thrust technique, first published his findings about the maneuver in a June 1974 informal article in Emergency Medicine entitled, "Pop Goes the Cafe Coronary". On June 19, 1974, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported that retired restaurant-owner Isaac Piha used the procedure to rescue choking victim Irene Bogachus in Bellevue, Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heimlich Institute|publisher=Heimlich Institute|url=http://www.heimlichinstitute.org/default.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1974 [[Quantum well laser]]'''
* A quantum well laser is a laser diode in which the active region of the device is so narrow that quantum confinement occurs. The wavelength of the light emitted by a quantum well laser is determined by the width of the active region rather than just the bandgap of the material from which it is constructed. The quantum well laser was invented by [[Charles H. Henry]], a physicist at Bell Labs, in 1974 and was granted a patent for it in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1999 IEEE Jack A.

'''1975 [[Ethernet]]'''

The ethernet is a family of frame-based computer networking technologies for local area networks (LANs). The name comes from the physical concept of the ether. It defines a number of wiring and signaling standards for the Physical Layer of the OSI networking model, through means of network access at the Media Access Control (MAC)/Data Link Layer, and a common addressing format. [[Robert Metcalfe]], while at Xerox invented the ethernet in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethernet|publisher=University of Aberdeen|url=http://www.erg.abdn.ac.uk/users/gorry/course/lan-pages/enet.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1975 [[Breakaway rim]]'''

A breakaway rim is a basketball hoop that can bend slightly when a player dunks a basketball, and then instantly snap back into its original shape when the player releases it. It allows players to dunk the ball without shattering the backboard, and it reduces the possibility of wrist injuries. According to the Lemelson Center, an affiliation of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington D.C., the breakaway rim was invented by Arthur Ehrat. After six years, from July 1976 to December 1982, Ehrat received a patent (U.S. Patent No. 4,365,802). His application was rejected twice, with patent examiner Paul Shapiro noting that Frederick C. Tyner held a patent for a similar device (U.S. Patent No. 4,111,420). However, a court appeal finally ruled in favor of Ehrat, as he proved through notarized copies of canceled checks and a rough sketch of his invention, that he was working on his breakaway basketball goal in 1975 before Frederick Tyner conceived of his.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arthur Ehrat Papers|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|url=http://invention.smithsonian.org/resources/fa_ehrat_index.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720151909/http://invention.smithsonian.org/resources/fa_ehrat_index.aspx|archivedate=July 20, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1976 [[Gore-Tex]]'''
* Gore-Tex is a waterproof, breathable fabric and is made using an emulsion polymerization process with the fluorosurfactant perfluorooctanoic acid. Gore-Tex was co-invented by [[Wilbert L.

Robert Gore was granted a patent on April 27, 1976, for a porous form of polytetrafluoroethylene with a micro-structure characterized by nodes interconnected by fibrils. Robert Gore, Rowena Taylor, and Samuel Allen were granted a patent on March 18, 1980 for a "waterproof laminate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GORE-TEX|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/gore.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1977 [[Human-powered aircraft]]'''
* A human-powered aircraft (HPA) is an aircraft powered by direct human energy and the force of gravity. The thrust provided by the human may be the only source. However, a hang glider that is partially powered by pilot power is a human-powered aircraft where the flight path can be enhanced more than if the hang glider had not been assisted by human power. Invented by designer [[Paul MacCready]] and constructed of mylar, polystyrene, and carbon-fiber rods, the Gossamer Condor was the world's first practical and successful human-powered aircraft, staying in the air for 7.5 uninterrupted minutes. By 1979, a cyclist named Byron Allen used McCready's successive model known as the Gossamer Albatross, and won British industrialist Henry Kremer's prize of $214,000 for crossing the 22-mile English Channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flying Higher and Quieter |publisher=Progressive Engineer|url=http://www.progressiveengineer.com/PEWebBackissues2003/PEWeb%2042%20Sep%2003-2/MacC.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1977 [[Chemical oxygen iodine laser]]'''
* A chemical oxygen iodine laser is an infrared chemical laser. The chemical oxygen iodine laser was invented by the United States Air Force's Phillips Laboratory in 1977 for military purposes. Its properties make it useful for industrial processing as well; the beam is focusable and can be transferred by an optical fiber, as its wavelength is not absorbed much by fused silica but is very well absorbed by metals, making it suitable for laser cutting and drilling. COIL is the main weapon laser for the military airborne laser and advanced tactical laser programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Industrialization of the chemical oxygen-iodine laser|publisher=Harvard University|bibcode=1994SPIE.2214..188S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1978 [[Slide Away Bed]]'''
* A Slide Away Bed is a type of [[sofa bed]] that slides to the wall to form a [[Couch|sofa]]. The mattress is hinged to form a seating surface and back support. The bed frame support is a telescoping frame that allows the bed platform to recess below the seating cushion. The primitive version of the slide away bed was co-invented by Manning Lane, Warren J. Hauck and Roy O. Sweeney of [[Cincinnati]], Ohio. U.S. patent #4,204,287 was filed on September 5, 1978 and issued on May 27, 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Knock-down sofa bed with hinged mattress|publisher=Google PAtents Search|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=JQouAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1978 [[Bulletin board system]]'''
* A Bulletin Board System, or BBS, is a computer system running software that allows users to connect and log into the system using a terminal program. Once logged in, a user can perform functions such as uploading and downloading software and data, reading news and bulletins, and exchanging messages with other users, either through electronic mail or in public message boards. Many BBSes also offer on-line games, in which users can compete with each other, and BBSes with multiple phone lines often provide chat rooms, allowing users to interact with each other. [[CBBS]], the first Bulletin Board System, was invented by [[Ward Christensen]] and Randy Suess in Chicago, becoming fully operational on February 16, 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smart Computing Encyclopedia |publisher=Sandhills Publishing Company |url=http://www.smartcomputing.com/editorial/dictionary/detail.asp?guid=&amp;searchtype=&amp;DicID=19535&amp;RefType=Encyclopedia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607175741/http://www.smartcomputing.com/editorial/dictionary/detail.asp?guid=&amp;searchtype=&amp;DicID=19535&amp;RefType=Encyclopedia |archivedate=June 7, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1979 [[Winglets]]'''
[[File:CO-Winglet.JPG|180px|left|thumb|A winglet attached to the tip of a Continental Airlines Boeing 757 wing]]
Wingtip devices or winglets are usually intended to improve the efficiency of fixed-wing aircraft. The concept of winglets originated in the late 19th century, but the idea remained on the drawing board. Throughout the 1970s when the price of aviation fuel started spiraling upward, NASA aeronautical engineer [[Richard Whitcomb]] began investigating and studying the feasibility of winglets in order to improve overall aerodynamics and reduce drag on aircraft. Whitcomb's tests finally culminated with the first successful test flight of his attached winglets on a [[KC-135 Stratotanker]] on July 24, 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Winglets|publisher=NASA|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/about/Organizations/Technology/Facts/TF-2004-15-DFRC.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* An LCD projector is a type of [[video projector]] for displaying video, images or computer data on a screen or other flat surface. It is a modern equivalent of the [[slide projector]] or [[overhead projector]]. To display images, LCD ([[liquid-crystal display]]) projectors typically send light from a metal-halide lamp through a prism or series of dichroic filters that separates light to three polysilicon panels – one each for the red, green and blue components of the video signal. The LCD projector was invented in 1984 by [[Gene Dolgoff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Milestones|publisher=InfoComm International|url=http://www.infocomm.org/cps/rde/xchg/infocomm/hs.xsl/10664.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''treadwheel crane''' (Latin ''magna rota'') is a wooden, [[animal engine|human powered]], [[Crane (machine)|hoisting and lowering device]]. It was primarily used during the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] period and the [[Middle Ages]] in the building of castles and cathedrals. The often heavy charge is lifted as the individual inside the [[treadwheel]] crane walks. The rope attached to a [[pulley]] is turned onto a [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]] by the rotation of the wheel thus allowing the device to hoist or lower the affixed pallet.

== History ==

=== Ancient Rome ===
[[File:KranIBN.JPG|thumb|Reconstruction of a Roman treadwheel crane, the ''Polyspaston'', at [[Bonn]], Germany]]
The Roman ''Polyspaston'' crane, when worked by four men at both sides of the [[winch]], could lift 3000&amp;nbsp;kg. In case the winch was replaced by a treadwheel, the maximum load even doubled to 6000&amp;nbsp;kg at only half the crew, since the treadwheel possesses a much bigger mechanical advantage due to its larger diameter. This meant that, in comparison to the construction of the ancient [[Egyptian pyramids]], where about 50 men were needed to move a 2.5 ton stone block up the ramp (50&amp;nbsp;kg per person), the lifting capability of the Roman ''Polyspaston'' proved to be ''60 times'' more efficient (3000&amp;nbsp;kg per person).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dienel|Meighörner|1997|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two surviving reliefs of Roman treadwheel cranes, the [[Quintus Haterius|Haterii]] tombstone from the late first century AD being particularly detailed.

For larger weights of up to 100 t, Roman engineers set up a wooden lifting tower, a rectangular trestle which was so constructed that the column could be lifted upright in the middle of the structure by the means of human and animal-powered [[Capstan (nautical)|capstans]] placed on the ground around the tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lancaster|1999|pp=426−432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middle Ages ===
[[File:Tretkran (Bruegel).jpg|thumb|Pieter Bruegel's construction of ''[[The Tower of Babel (Bruegel)]]'' featuring a double treadwheel crane]]

During the [[High Middle Ages]], the treadwheel crane was reintroduced on a large scale after the technology had fallen into disuse in western Europe with the demise of the [[Western Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=514}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest reference to a treadwheel (''magna rota'') reappears in archival literature in France about 1225,&lt;ref name="Andrea Matthies, p.515"&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=515}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by an illuminated depiction in a manuscript of probably also French origin dating to 1240.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=526}}&lt;/ref&gt; In navigation, the earliest uses of harbor cranes are documented for [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] in 1244, [[Antwerp]] in 1263, [[Brugge]] in 1288 and [[Hamburg]] in 1291,&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 345"&gt;{{harvnb|Matheus|1996|p=345}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in England the treadwheel is not recorded before 1331.&lt;ref name="Matthies 1992, 524"&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, vertical transport could be done more safely and inexpensively by cranes than by customary methods. Typical areas of application were harbours, mines, and, in particular, building sites where the treadwheel crane played a pivotal role in the construction of the lofty [[Gothic architecture|Gothic cathedrals]]. Nevertheless, both archival and pictorial sources of the time suggest that newly introduced machines like treadwheels or [[wheelbarrow]]s did not completely replace more labor-intensive methods like [[ladder]]s, [[Brick hod|hods]] and handbarrows. Rather, old and new machinery continued to coexist on medieval construction sites&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=545}}&lt;/ref&gt; and harbours.&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 345"/&gt;

Apart from treadwheels, medieval depictions also show cranes to be powered manually by windlasses with radiating [[spoke]]s, [[Crank (mechanism)|cranks]] and by the 15th century also by windlasses shaped like a [[ship's wheel]]. To smooth out irregularities of impulse and get over 'dead-spots' in the lifting process [[flywheel]]s are known to be in use as early as 1123.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=518}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact process by which the treadwheel crane was reintroduced is not recorded,&lt;ref name="Andrea Matthies, p.515"/&gt; although its return to construction sites has undoubtedly to be viewed in close connection with the simultaneous rise of Gothic architecture. The reappearance of the treadwheel crane may have resulted from a technological development of the [[windlass]] from which the treadwheel structurally and mechanically evolved. Alternatively, the medieval treadwheel may represent a deliberate reinvention of its Roman counterpart drawn from [[Vitruvius]]' ''[[De architectura]]'' which was available in many monastic libraries. Its reintroduction may have been inspired, as well, by the observation of the labor-saving qualities of the [[Water wheel|waterwheel]] with which early treadwheels shared many structural similarities.&lt;ref name="Matthies 1992, 524"/&gt;

==== Structure and placement ====
[[File:Reconstruction of the temple of Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|Single treadwheel crane working from top of the building]]

The medieval treadwheel was a large wooden wheel turning around a [[Axle|central shaft]] with a treadway wide enough for two workers walking side by side. While the earlier 'compass-arm' wheel had spokes directly driven into the central shaft, the more advanced 'clasp-arm' type featured arms arranged as chords to the wheel rim,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|pp=525f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving the possibility of using a thinner shaft and providing thus a greater mechanical advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=536}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to a popularly held belief, cranes on medieval building sites were neither placed on the extremely lightweight [[scaffolding]] used at the time nor on the thin walls of the Gothic churches which were incapable of supporting the weight of both hoisting machine and load. Rather, cranes were placed in the initial stages of construction on the ground, often within the building. When a new floor was completed, and massive tie beams of the roof connected the walls, the crane was dismantled and reassembled on the roof beams from where it was moved from bay to bay during construction of the vaults.&lt;ref name="Matthies 1992, 533"&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=533}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the crane ‘grew’ and ‘wandered’ with the building with the result that today all extant construction cranes in England are found in church towers above the vaulting and below the roof, where they remained after building construction for bringing material for repairs aloft.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|pp=532ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less frequently, medieval illuminations also show cranes mounted on the outside of walls with the stand of the machine secured to putlogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mechanics and operation ====

In contrast to modern cranes, medieval cranes and hoists - much like their counterparts in Greece and Rome&lt;ref name="Coulton 1974, 6" &gt;{{harvnb|Coulton|1974|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; - were primarily capable of a vertical lift, and not used to move loads for a considerable distance horizontally as well.&lt;ref name="Matthies 1992, 533"/&gt; Accordingly, lifting work was organized at the workplace in a different way than today. In building construction, for example, it is assumed that the crane lifted the stone blocks either from the bottom directly into place,&lt;ref name="Matthies 1992, 533"/&gt; or from a place opposite the centre of the wall from where it could deliver the blocks for two teams working at each end of the wall.&lt;ref name="Coulton 1974, 6"/&gt; Additionally, the crane master who usually gave orders at the treadwheel workers from outside the crane was able to manipulate the movement laterally by a small rope attached to the load.&lt;ref name="Dienel, Meighörner 1997, 17"&gt;{{harvnb|Dienel|Meighörner|1997|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slewing cranes which allowed a rotation of the load and were thus particularly suited for dockside work appeared as early as 1340.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=534}}&lt;/ref&gt; While ashlar blocks were directly lifted by sling, lewis or devil's clamp (German ''Teufelskralle''), other objects were placed before in containers like [[pallet]]s, [[basket]]s, wooden boxes or [[barrel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is noteworthy that medieval cranes rarely featured [[Ratchet (device)|ratchets]] or [[brake]]s to forestall the load from running backward.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=540}}&lt;/ref&gt; This curious absence is explained by the high [[Friction|friction force]] exercised by medieval treadwheels which normally prevented the wheel from accelerating beyond control.&lt;ref name="Dienel, Meighörner 1997, 17"/&gt;

==== Harbour usage ====
[[File:Trier Germany Alter Krahnen.jpg|thumb|left|Tower crane at the inland harbour of [[Trier]] from 1413]]

According to the "present state of knowledge" unknown in antiquity, stationary harbour cranes are considered a new development of the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 345"/&gt; The typical harbour crane was a pivoting structure equipped with double treadwheels. These cranes were placed docksides for the loading and unloading of cargo where they replaced or complemented older lifting methods like [[see-saw]]s, [[winch]]es and [[Yard (sailing)|yards]].&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 345"/&gt;

Two different types of harbour cranes can be identified with a varying geographical distribution: While gantry cranes which pivoted on a central vertical axle were commonly found at the Flemish and Dutch coastside, German sea and inland harbours typically featured tower cranes where the windlass and treadwheels were situated in a solid tower with only jib arm and roof rotating.&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 346"&gt;{{harvnb|Matheus|1996|p=346}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dockside cranes were not adopted in the Mediterranean region and the highly developed Italian ports where authorities continued to rely on the more labor-intensive method of unloading goods by ramps beyond the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matheus|1996|p=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike construction cranes where the work speed was determined by the relatively slow progress of the masons, harbour cranes usually featured double treadwheels to speed up loading. The two treadwheels whose diameter is estimated to be 4&amp;nbsp;m or larger were attached to each side of the axle and rotated together.&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 345"/&gt; Their capacity was 2–3 tons which apparently corresponded to the customary size of marine cargo.&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 345"/&gt; Today, according to one survey, fifteen treadwheel harbour cranes from pre-industrial times are still extant throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;These are Bergen, Stockholm, Karlskrona (Sweden), Kopenhagen (Denmark), Harwich (England), Gdańsk (Poland), Lüneburg, Stade, Otterndorf, Marktbreit, Würzburg, Östrich, Bingen, Andernach and Trier (Germany). Cf. {{harvnb|Matheus|1996|p=346}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some harbour cranes were specialised at mounting masts to newly built sailing ships, such as in [[Danzig]], [[Cologne]] and [[Bremen]].&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 346"/&gt; Beside these stationary cranes, [[crane vessel|floating cranes]] which could be flexibly deployed in the whole port basin came into use by the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 346"/&gt;

=== Original ===

A treadwheel crane survives at [[Chesterfield]], [[Derbyshire]] and is housed in the Museum. It has been dated to the early 14th century and was housed in the top of the church tower until its removal in 1947. It was reconstructed in the Museum for its opening in 1994.

A treadwheel crane survives at [[Guildford]], [[Surrey]], [[United Kingdom]]. It dates from the late 17th or early 18th century and formerly stood in Friary Street. It was moved in 1970, having last been used ''ca.'' 1960 to move materials for [[Guildford Cathedral]]. It is a [[Scheduled monument|Scheduled Ancient Monument]] and a [[Listed building|Grade II* listed building]].&lt;ref name=Guildford&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=289006 |title=THE TREADWHEEL CRANE, MILLBROOK (west side), GUILDFORD, GUILDFORD, SURREY |publisher=English Heritage |accessdate=28 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A treadwheel crane survives at [[Harwich]], [[Essex]], United Kingdom. It was built in 1667 and formerly stood in the Naval Yard. It was moved to Harwich Green in 1932. The crane has two treadwheels of {{convert|16|ft|m|2}} diameter by {{convert|3|ft|10|in|m|2}} wide on an axle {{convert|13+1/2|in|mm}} diameter. It is the only double wheel treadwheel crane in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=Harwich&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harwich-society.co.uk/old/info_treadwheel.htm|title=Treadwheel Crane |publisher=The Harwich Society |accessdate=28 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crane is a Grade II* listed building.&lt;ref name=Harwich2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=366522 |title=OLD NAVAL YARD CRANE, HARWICH GREEN, HARWICH, TENDRING, ESSEX |publisher=English Heritage |accessdate=28 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reconstructions ===

A reconstruction of a 13th-century treadwheel crane can be seen in action at the site [[Guédelon Castle]], [[Treigny]], [[France]]. It is used for lifting mortar, rubble, [[ashlar]] blocks, and wood. The object of Guédelon Castle is to build a fortress castle using only the techniques and materials of 13th-century medieval France.

A reconstruction of a double wheel treadwheel crane is in use at [[Prague]] Castle, [[Czech Republic]].&lt;ref name=Tocnik&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/article/82857 |title=Man-powered medieval crane at Prague Castle |publisher=Radio Praha |accessdate=28 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Treadwheel Crane was used in the film ''[[Evan Almighty]]'', when Evan complained to God that he needed a crane to construct the Ark in suburban Washington, D.C.
