'''''Abie's Irish Rose''''' is a popular comedy by [[Anne Nichols]] familiar from stage productions, films and radio programs. The basic premise involves an [[Irish Catholic]] girl and a young [[Jew]]ish man who marry despite the objections of their families.

==Theater and films==
Although initially receiving poor reviews, the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Play (theatre)|play]] was a commercial hit, running for 2,327 performances between May 23, 1922, and October 1, 1927, at the time the [[List of Broadway shows that have held title of longest-running show|longest run in Broadway theater history]], surpassing the record 1,291 performances set by the [[Winchell Smith]] and [[Frank Bacon (actor)|Frank Bacon]] 1918 play, ''[[Lightnin' (play)|Lightnin']]''.&lt;ref&gt;W. R. Benet, ''The Reader's Encyclopedia'', 1948, ''s.v.'' "''Abie's Irish Rose''"; [http://www.world-theatres.com/longruns.html#longruns.london.html Long Runs in the Theater website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402061014/http://world-theatres.com/longruns.html |date=2010-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Abroad", ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]] June 2, 1927, ProQuest Historical Newspapers, ''The Guardian'' and ''The Observer'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  The show's touring company had a similarly long run and held the record for longest running touring company for nearly 40 years until the record was broken by ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' in the 1960s. The touring company's male lead was played by a young [[George Brent]], the future Hollywood actor's first major role, and the female lead was played by [https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/153781 Peggy Parry].

The play was twice the inspiration for films: in 1928 with [[Charles "Buddy" Rogers]] and [[Nancy Carroll]], directed by [[Victor Fleming]], and in 1946 with Richard Norris and [[Joanne Dru]], directed by A. Edward Sutherland. The 1946 version, produced by [[Bing Crosby]], met with considerable published controversy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/24671 AFI|Catalog Abie's Irish Rose (1946)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio==
It inspired the weekly [[NBC]] radio series, '''''Abie's Irish Rose''''',  which replaced ''Knickerbocker Playhouse'' and ran from January 24, 1942, through September 2, 1944. Faced with listener protests about its stereotyped ethnic portrayals, the radio series was cancelled in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/24671 AFI|Catalog Abie's Irish Rose (1946)]&lt;/ref&gt; Nichols wrote the scripts. Axel Gruenbert&lt;ref name="bb020742"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ackerman|first1=Paul|title=Program Reviews: 'Abie's Irish Rose'|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/40s/1942/Billboard%201942-02-07.o.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2015|agency=Billboard|date=February 7, 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Joe Rines directed the cast that starred Richard Bond, Sydney Smith, [[Richard Coogan]] and [[Bud Collyer|Clayton "Bud" Collyer]] as Abie Levy. Betty Winkler, [[Mercedes McCambridge]], [[Julie Stevens (American radio actress)|Julie Stevens]], [[Bernard Gorcey]], and Marion Shockley portrayed Rosemary Levy. Solomon Levy was played by Alfred White, [[Charlie Cantor]] and [[Alan Reed]].

Others in the radio cast: [[Walter Kinsella (actor)|Walter Kinsella]] (as Patrick Murphy), [[Menasha Skulnik]] (Isaac Cohen), Anna Appel (Mrs. Cohen), Ann Thomas (Casey), Bill Adams (Father Whelan), Amanda Randolph (maid) and Dolores Gillenas (the Levys' twins). The announcer was Howard Petrie, and Joe Stopak provided the music. The opening theme music was "[[My Wild Irish Rose]]" by [[Chauncey Olcott]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunning, John. ''On The Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio''. Oxford University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-19-507678-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic premise was extensively copied, and Anne Nichols sued one imitator, Universal Pictures, which produced ''[[The Cohens and Kellys]]'', a motion picture play about an Irish boy who marries a Jewish girl from feuding families. However, in ''[[Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp.]]'', 45 F.2d 119 ([[2d Cir.]] 1930).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] found for the defendant, holding that [[Copyright in the United States|copyright protection]] cannot be extended to the characteristics of [[stock character]]s in a story, whether it be a book, play or film.

==Plot==
The plot was ably summarized by Judge [[Learned Hand]], in his opinion in the lawsuit:
:''Abie's Irish Rose'' presents a Jewish family living in prosperous circumstances in New York. The father, a widower, is in business as a merchant, in which his son and only child helps him. The boy has philandered with young women, who to his father's great disgust have always been Gentiles, for he is obsessed with a passion that his daughter-in-law shall be an orthodox Jew. When the play opens the son, who has been courting a young Irish Catholic girl, has already married her secretly before a Protestant minister, and concerned about how to soften the blow for his father securing a favorable reception for his bride, while concealing her faith and race. To accomplish this he introduces her to his father as a Jewish girl in whom he is interested and conceals the fact they are married. The girl somewhat reluctantly agrees to the plan; the father takes the bait, becomes infatuated with the girl, insists that they must marry. He assumes they will because it's the father's idea. He calls in a rabbi, and prepares for the wedding according to the Jewish rite.

:Meanwhile the girl's father, also a widower who lives in California and is as intense in his own religious antagonism as the Jew, has been called to New York, supposing that his daughter is to marry an Irishman and a Catholic. Accompanied by a priest, he arrives at the house at the moment when the marriage is being celebrated, so too late to prevent it, and the two fathers, each infuriated by the proposed union of his child to a heretic, fall into unseemly and grotesque antics. The priest and the rabbi become friendly, exchange trite sentiments about religion, and agree that the match is good. Apparently out of abundant caution, the priest celebrates the marriage for a third time, while the girl's father is inveigled away. The second act closes with each father, still outraged, seeking to find some way by which the union, thus trebly insured, may be dissolved.

:The last act takes place about a year later, the young couple having meanwhile been abjured by each father, and left to their own resources.  They have had twins, a boy and a girl, but their fathers know no more than that a child has been born. At Christmas each, led by his craving to see his grandchild, goes separately to the young folks' home, where they encounter each other, each laden with gifts, one for a boy, the other for a girl. After some slapstick comedy, depending upon the insistence of each that he is right about the sex of the grandchild, they become reconciled when they learn the truth, and that each child is to bear the given name of a grandparent. The curtain falls as the fathers are exchanging amenities, and the Jew giving evidence of an abatement in the strictness of his orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coolcopyright.com/cases/fulltext/nicholsuniversaltext.htm Cool Copyright: Nichols vs. Universal, Circuit Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, November 10, 1930] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717083655/http://www.coolcopyright.com/cases/fulltext/nicholsuniversaltext.htm |date=July 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been some variations of the plot in different versions of the play/film. Nichols' original Broadway play had the couple meeting in France during [[World War I]], with the young man having been a soldier and the girl a nurse who had tended to him. In this version, the priest and the rabbi from the wedding are also veterans of the same war, and recognize one another from their time in the service.

==Critical response==
Although the play was a tremendous popular success, it was universally loathed by the critics. [[Robert Benchley]], then the theatre critic for ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, nursed a particular hatred for it. Part of Benchley's job was to write capsule reviews each week. ''Abie's Irish Rose'' he described variously as "Something Awful", "Just about as low as good clean fun can get", "Showing that the Jews and the Irish crack equally old jokes", "The comic spirit of 1876", "People laugh at this every night, which explains why democracy can never be a success", "Will the Marines never come?" and finally "Hebrews 13:8," a Biblical passage that reads, “Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and today, and forever.”&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Herrmann, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;  He also held a contest for an outsider to contribute the capsule review, which [[Harpo Marx]] won with "No worse than a bad cold."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Malarcher, Jay. "No, Siree! A One-Night Stand with the Algonquin Round Table"&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lorenz Hart]] expressed the feeling of many in the theater world in these lines for [[Manhattan (song)|"Manhattan"]]: "Our future babies we'll take to ''Abie's Irish Rose'' -- I hope they'll live to see it close." Writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' of its 1937 revival, [[Wolcott Gibbs]] said that "it had, in fact, the rather eerie quality of a repeated nightmare; the one, perhaps, in which I always find myself in an old well, thick with bats, and can't get out."

The play was popular enough for its title to be referenced in a pun in the Marx Brothers film ''[[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|Animal Crackers]]'', in the lyrics of the [[Cole Porter]] song [[Ace in the Hole (Cole Porter song)|"Ace in the Hole"]], the [[Stephen Sondheim]] song [[I'm Still Here (Follies song)|"I'm Still Here"]], and the song "The Legacy" from the musical ''[[On the Twentieth Century]]''.

==Thematic legacy==

''Abie's Irish Rose'' prefigured the comedy of [[Stiller_and_Meara|Stiller and Meara]], a husband-and-wife team ([[Jerry Stiller]] and [[Anne Meara]]), who often spiked their routines with references to their differing backgrounds (Stiller is Jewish; Meara was of an Irish Catholic background but converted to Judaism later during their marriage).

The play also provided the central premise for the 1972–73 television series ''[[Bridget Loves Bernie]]'' ([[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]]), which starred [[Meredith Baxter Birney|Meredith Baxter]] and [[David Birney]] (who later became husband and wife in real life) in a kind-of reversal of ''Abie's Irish Rose'' in that Birney played struggling young Jewish cab driver/aspiring playwright Bernie Steinberg, whose parents ran a modest family delicatessen, and Baxter played Irish Catholic daughter of wealthy parents, Bridget Fitzgerald, who falls in love with and elopes with Steinberg to the disappointment of both sets of parents. (Although both actors were Protestant, the casting partially inverted real life, Birney being of Irish descent.) The show was attacked by a broad range of Jewish groups for allegedly promoting inter-faith marriage,&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/07/archives/bridget-loves-bernie-attacked-by-jewish-groups.html | title=‘Bridget Loves Bernie’ Attacked by Jewish Groups | first=Albin | last=Krebs | date=February 7, 1973 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was cancelled at the end of its first season, despite being the fifth-highest-rated serial of the 1972–1973 year on USA broadcast television.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.interfaithfamily.com/blog/iff/bridget-loves-bernie-during-interfaith-family-month-we-celebrate-their-love/ ''Bridget Loves Bernie: During Interfaith Family Month We Celebrate Their Love'']&lt;/ref&gt;

But two decades later, with social attitudes changing in the USA, CBS would run another television series, ''[[Brooklyn Bridge (TV series)|Brooklyn Bridge]]'' (1991–1993), the quasi-autobiographical childhood memoir of its Jewish series creator, [[Gary_David_Goldberg|Gary David Goldberg]], which featured a continuing romance between two main (teenage) characters, a Jewish boy and an Irish Catholic girl. It ran two seasons, with the sixth (two-part) episode of the first season, titled ''War of the Worlds'', exploring the tensions of this inter-faith relationship in its mid-1950s Brooklyn fictional setting. (Goldberg had previously created another quasi-autobiographical television series, ''[[Family_Ties|Family Ties]]'', inspired by his adult life, in which the female lead, the alter-ego of his real-life Irish Catholic partner, had been portrayed by Meredith Baxter, the same actress who had starred in the ill-fated ''Bridget Loves Bernie''.)

In [[philosophy]], the concept of '''The Absolute''', also known as '''The (Unconditioned) Ultimate''', '''The Wholly Other''', '''The [[Supreme Being]]''',  '''The Absolute/Ultimate Reality''', and other names, is the thing, being, entity, power, force, reality, presence, law, principle, etc. that possesses maximal [[Ontology|ontological]] status, existential ranking, existential greatness, or existentiality. In layman's terms, this is the one that is, in one way or another, the greatest, truest, or most [[Reality|real]] [[being]].

There are many conceptions of The Absolute in various fields and subjects, such as [[philosophy]], [[religion]], [[Spirituality|spiritual traditions]], [[mathematics]], and even [[natural science]]. The nature of these conceptions can range from "merely" encompassing all [[Physics|physical]] existence, [[nature]], or [[reality]], to being completely unconditioned existentially, [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcending]] all concepts, notions, and types, kinds, and categories of being.

The Absolute is often thought of as causing to come into being manifestations that interact with lower or lesser forms of being. This is either done passively, through [[Emanationism|emanations]], or actively, through [[avatar]]s and [[incarnation]]s. These existential manifestations, which themselves can possess [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] attributes, only contain minuscule or infinitesimal portions of the true essence of The Absolute.

The term itself was not in use in ancient or medieval philosophy, but closely related to the description of God as ''[[Actus purus]]'' (Pure Actuality) in [[scholasticism]]. It was introduced in modern philosophy, notably by [[Hegel]], for "the sum of all being, actual and potential".&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=The Absolute}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term has since also been adopted in  [[perennial philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Perennial Philosophy|last=Huxley|first=Aldous|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics|isbn=9780061724947|location=New York|language=English}}

Vol. I.|last=Tillich|first=Paul|date=1951-01-01|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major conceptions of The Absolute==
{{synthesis|date=November 2017}}
There are three general ways of conceiving the Absolute. The Absolute might be (1) the first and greatest being, (2) not a being at all but the "ground" of being, or (3) both the ground of being and a being.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In conception one the Absolute is the most true and intelligible reality. It can be spoken of and known. For example, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s Absolute Spirit is the most true reality. It is thinkable, speakable, and exists in the objective world by comprehending everything, including people, states, and world history.

In conception two the Absolute might be conceived of as utterly outside of all other reality and hence unintelligible. It cannot be known or spoken about. Plato's Socrates says that "[[Form of the Good|The Form of the Good]]" is "beyond being",&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Republic'', Book VI, 508.&lt;/ref&gt; implying that it is even beyond thought, language, and normal categories of existence.

St. [[John of the Cross]] says:
{{poemquote
|text=He who truly arrives there
cuts free from himself;
all that he knew before
now seems worthless,
and his knowledge so soars
that he is left in unknowing
transcending all knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Works-Saint-John-Cross-ebook/dp/B00V21HZ8G/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1461745961&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=st+john+of+the+cross|title=The Complete Works of Saint John of the Cross, Volume 1 of 2|last=Cross|first=St John of the|date=2015-01-16|publisher=Waxkeep Publishing|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In conception three the Absolute is seen as transcending duality and distinction. This concept of a fundamental reality that transcends or includes all other reality is usually (but not always) associated with [[divinity]]. While this conception initially seems contradictory, it has been highly influential. One way to understand this third conception is to consider the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]''.

{{poemquote
|text=The Tao that can be spoken is not the eternal Tao.
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
|source=Tao Te Ching, 1
}}

These opening lines distinguish between two [[Tao]]s. One is the "eternal Tao" (which cannot be named or explained) and the other "Tao" seems to exist in space and time (and can be named and explained). The eternal Tao is beyond existence and cannot be named or fully understood, while the other Tao exists and can be known. The eternal Tao is infinite; the other is finite. The eternal Tao is formless; the other is formed. The eternal Tao is transcendent; the other is immanent. The other "Tao" is an attempt to describe the "eternal Tao" in human terms; but such effort can never express the eternal Tao fully. He continues:
{{poemquote
|text=The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth
The named is the mother of myriad things
Thus, constantly without desire, one observes its essence
Constantly with desire, one observes its manifestations
These two emerge together but differ in name
The unity is said to be the mystery.
}}

In these lines, he further discusses the difference between the two Taos. The eternal Tao is "nameless" and is the origin of Heaven and Earth; this origin can be understood as an underlying [[metaphysics]] that cannot be described fully. The "named" Tao, on the other hand, is able to describe specific phenomenons that exist in space and time, hence it is the mother of myriad of things; it also can be treated as the humanly conceived concepts in the effort to describe our physical world. Later, he points out that both the "named" and the "nameless" emerge together from the same eternal Tao. This seemingly self-contradictory unity, of course, is said to be the mystery to be understood.

===Interpretations===
{{synthesis|date=November 2017}}
While these conceptions are superficially similar, they admit of multiple interpretations. Some philosophers, especially perennialists and [[pantheism|pantheist]] philosophers, find great significance in the similarities between these different words and argue that various/all cultures past and present have an identical concept of the 'Absolute'.

Other philosophers, however, argue that these concepts are not the same,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c6aHAgAAQBAJ|title=Philosophy of Religion: A Contemporary Introduction|last=Yandell|first=Keith E.|date=2002-01-22|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134827237|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moser|first=Paul|date=2009-01-01|title=Exclusivism, Inclusivism, and Kardiatheology|url=http://philpapers.org/rec/MOSEIA|journal=Philosophia Christi|volume=11|issue=2|pages=293–308}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the Logos is rational and formal whereas Brahman is formless and irrational; and since Plato's Form of the Good is impersonal where the Christian God is personal; since Bradley's Absolute is a conscious experience whereas [[Brand Blanshard]]'s Absolute is an unconscious, intelligible system.

Perennialist philosophers such as John Hick argue that even if the concepts vary slightly, the reality of the Absolute reality behind the varying concepts is the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hick/|title=Hick, John {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Within religious traditions ====
{{synthesis|date=November 2017}}
Philosophers such as [[Adi Shankara]] denied the Absolute any personal sense, whereas philosophers such as [[Ramanuja]] and [[Madhvacharya|Madhva]], tended to identify the Absolute with a [[Ishvara|personal God]]. The [[Traditionalist School]], via [[Frithjof Schuon]], admits:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is true that God as creator, revealer, and savior is not to be identified with the Absolute as such; it is likewise true that God in Himself, in the full depth of His reality, is not to be reduced to the creative Function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.studiesincomparativereligion.com/Public/articles/browse_g.aspx?ID=261|title=Form and Substance in the Religions|last=Schuon|first=Frithjof|date=1974|website=Studies in Comparative Religion|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Early Hinduism identified [[Brahman]] with [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Shiva]]. The same immortal spirit was conceived of as functional in the world in three ways: creation, preservation, and destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03270.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 3: Vana Parva: Draupadi-harana Parva: Section CCLXX|last=Ganguli|first=Kisari Mohan|date=|website=Sacred Texts|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|quote=The Supreme Spirit hath three conditions. In the form of Brahma, he is the Creator, and in the form of Vishnu he is the Preserver, and in his form as Rudra, he is the Destroyer of the Universe!}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was therefore no real contradiction between [[Bhakti|love of a personal God]] and [[Brahman|an impersonal Absolute]], although the latter was sometimes conceived of as "purer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mahavidya.ca/2015/03/04/nirguna-and-saguna-brahman/|title=Nirguna and Saguna Brahman|last=Rodrigues|first=Hillary|date=2015|website=Mahavidya|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|quote=Until this occurs, “the world…even including Isvara (the Lord), is not ultimately true or real, but that ultimate reality belongs only to the infinite, eternal, unchanging, pure bliss consciousness that is Brahman…all that we see with our senses, even our private thoughts, Advaita claims, are not ultimately real” (Betty 216).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shaivism]], and most [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] Indian religions, gave God five functions: creation, preservation, destruction, concealment, and revelation. [[Shiva]], as [[Brahman]], would therefore act in the world as a personal God. Yet this distinction between the Absolute and Infinite, or Transcendent and Immanent is not entirely, in itself, absolute. Philosophers like Shankara believe that upon doing away with [[Maya (illusion)|maya]] the entire universe disappears, including the notion of a personal God. Philosophers such as [[Madhvacharya|Madhva]] and [[Ramanuja]], tend to propound an identification of the Absolute with God, whereas later philosophers such as [[Nimbarka]] and [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Caitanya]], tended to identify the Absolute with a personal form of God ([[Krishna]]). Either way, all these claims, taken in context, tend to prove non-contradictory.

The quote above, via Schuon, is actually fully represented within the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] tradition. [[Brahma]], the creator god, is not worshiped within Hinduism. The only deities that are worshiped, are [[Shiva]], and [[Vishnu]]. Both Shiva and Vishnu, by their respective devotees, are represented as having power over the following five functions: creation, preservation, destruction, concealment, and revelation. However, a further distinction is made by Shankara: God is not [[Brahman]] (the Absolute). Rather the appearance of God is still via the power of [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]. So there are in effect, three levels, which Schuon himself observes: Brahman (the Absolute), God as creator, revealer, and savior (AKA, Shiva or Vishnu), and finally God as creator (AKA, Brahma). Incidental reasons are given for Brahma's lack of worship, a Hindu myth attributes this situation to a curse by [[Bhrigu]]. [[Devdutt Pattanaik]], an Indian author, gives some philosophical reasons. Ultimately the reason is actually inherent ("inherent" in the Absolute) and theological.

== Relation of humanity to the Absolute==
{{synthesis|date=November 2017}}

[[Laozi]] taught that the Tao was not only the ultimate reality but the ideal of human life. Another conceptual similarity between various conceptions is that the ultimate reality also somehow reveals to humans the way to live. For example, Plato taught that the Good was both the source of reality, the highest object of knowledge, and the ultimate end of desire.

[[C. S. Lewis]] explains the connection between the highest reality and human action in this way:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TLRLoWGgWqYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=abolition+of+man&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiz_sDY3P_ZAhXJrFQKHcIlCPgQ6AEIKTAA&amp;q=rta|title=The Abolition of Man|last=Lewis|first=C.S.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1943|isbn=978-0-06-065294-4|location=United Kingdom|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|text=In early Hinduism that conduct in men which can be called good consists in conformity to, or almost participation in, the Rta—that great ritual or pattern of nature and supernature which is revealed alike in the cosmic order, the moral virtues, and the ceremonial of the temple. Righteousness, correctness, order, the Rta, is constantly identified with satya or truth, correspondence to reality. As Plato said that the Good was 'beyond existence' and Wordsworth that through virtue the stars were strong, so the Indian masters say that the gods themselves are born of the Rta and obey it. The Chinese also speak of a great thing (the greatest thing) called the Tao. It is the reality beyond all predicates, the abyss that was before the Creator Himself. It is Nature, it is the Way, the Road. It is the Way in which the universe goes on, the Way in which things everlastingly emerge, stilly and tranquilly, into space and time. It is also the Way which every man should tread in imitation of that cosmic and supercosmic progression, conforming all activities to that great exemplar. 'In ritual', say the Analects, 'it is harmony with Nature that is prized.' The ancient Jews likewise praise the Law as being 'true'. This conception in all its forms, Platonic, Aristotelian, Stoic, Christian, and Oriental alike, I shall henceforth refer to for brevity simply as 'the Tao'.|sign=C.S. Lewis|source=The Abolition of Man}}

[[I. K. Taimni]] says:
{{Quotation|Because the Ultimate Reality which is denoted by the word 'Absolute' or 'Parabrahman' (卍) is the very core of our being as well as the cause and basis of the universe of which we are part, we can no more get away from it than our solar system can get away from the sun round which it resolves and from which it receives everything which keeps it alive and moving. Although the Absolute is sometimes referred to by such epithets as the Void, Ever-Darkness etc. and is beyond intellectual comprehension, still, from the intellectual point of view it is the most profound concept in the whole realm of philosophy. The fact that it is called 'Unknowable' does not mean that it is beyond the range of philosophical or religious thought and something on which thinking is impossible or undesirable. The very fact that it is the heart and the basis of the universe should make it the most intriguing object of enquiry within the realms of the intellect. |I. K. Taimni|''Man, God and the Universe''|Chapter 1&lt;ref&gt;The phrase "core of our being" is [[Freudian]]; see {{Cite journal | author = Bettina Bock von Wülfingen | year = 2013 | title = Freud's 'Core of our Being' Between Cytology and Psychoanalysis | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bewi.201301604/pdf | journal = Berichte zur Wissenschaftsgeschichte | volume = 36 | issue = 3 | pages = 226–244 | doi = 10.1002/bewi.201301604 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Aldous Huxley says:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Perennial Philosophy|last=Huxley|first=Aldous|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|year=1945|isbn=978-0-06-172494-7|location=United States|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|text=Only the transcendent, the completely other, can be immanent without being modified by the becoming of that in which it dwells. The Perennial Philosophy teaches that it is desirable and indeed necessary to know the spiritual Ground of things, not only within the soul, but also outside in the world and, beyond world and soul, in its transcendent otherness 'in heaven.' ... God within and God without; these are two abstract notions, which can be entertained by the understanding and expressed in words.|sign=Aldous Huxley|source=The Perennial Philosophy}}

Similarly, the Hindu Taimni describes the [[Parabrahman]] as unknowable by the human mind and unthinkable but the highest object of realization and the most profound object of philosophical enquiry.&lt;ref&gt;I. K. Taimni ''Man, God and the Universe'' Quest Books, 1974, p. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plotinus]] likewise taught that the goal of philosophy was to "contemplate the One".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/plotinus/|title=Plotinus - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author=|date=|website=www.iep.utm.edu|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Experiencing the Absolute ===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
Philosophers and religious adherents who aim to pattern their life after the Absolute reality sometimes claim to have experienced the Absolute. They report [[mystical experience]]s, feelings of oneness, transcendence of their everyday personality or of personhood altogether.

=== Representing the Absolute===
[[File:Yggdrasil.jpg|thumb|200px|The Absolute represented as ''[[Yggdrasill]]'' in [[Germanic paganism|Germanic religion]].]]
The Absolute is conceptually defined as something inexpressible and perhaps unthinkable. This concept creates special problems for expression in words, poetry, mythology, and art. Writers, [[Alex Grey|painters]], storytellers, filmmakers&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Terrence Malick]]'s ''Tree of Life'' and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' are two good examples (one religious, one atheistic) of the use of contradiction to convey the Absolute in the final sequences.&lt;/ref&gt; often use paradox or contradiction because of the "contradictory aspect of the ultimate reality".&lt;ref name="Dadosky, 2004. p. 86"&gt;Dadosky, 2004. p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Mircea Eliade]], the Absolute can be mediated or [[revelation|revealed]] through [[symbol]]s.&lt;ref name="Dadosky, 2004. p. 85"&gt;Dadosky, 2004. p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; For Eliade the "[[Arche|archaic]]" mind is constantly aware of the presence of the Sacred, and for this mind all symbols are [[religion|religious]] (relinking to the Origin). Through symbols human beings can get an immediate "intuition" of certain features of the inexhaustible Sacred. The mind makes use of images to grasp the ultimate reality of things because reality manifests itself in contradictory ways and therefore can't be described in concepts. It is therefore the image as such, as a whole bundle of meaning, that is "true" (faithful, trustworthy).&lt;ref name="Dadosky, 2004. p. 85"/&gt; Eliade says :&lt;ref&gt;Dadosky, 2004. p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...the ''sacred'' is equivalent to a ''power'', and, in the last analysis, to ''reality''. The sacred is saturated with ''being''. Sacred power means reality and at the same time enduringness and efficacy. The polarity sacred-profane is often expressed as opposition between real and ''unreal'' or pseudoreal. ''[...]'' Thus it is easy to understand that religious man deeply desires ''to be'', to participate in ''reality'', to be saturated with power.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Common symbols of the Absolute include [[world tree]]s, the [[tree of life]], [[macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]], [[fire]], children,&lt;ref&gt;See [[George MacDonald]]'s ''The Golden Key''&lt;/ref&gt; [[circles]], [[mandalas]], and the human body.

Bromley]]{{sfn|Bromley|2012|p=14}} }}

The '''academic study of new religious movements''' is known as '''new religions studies'''' ('''NRS''').{{sfnm|1a1=Bromley|1y=2004|1p=83|2a1=Bromley|2y=2012|2p=13}}
The study draws from the disciplines of [[anthropology]], [[psychiatry]], [[history]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[religious studies]], and [[theology]].&lt;ref name="Teaching bromley"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Disciplinary Perspectives on New Religious Movements: Views of from the Humanities and Social Sciences|encyclopedia=Teaching New Religious Movements|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195177299.001.0001/acprof-9780195177299-chapter-3|accessdate=2014-03-17|date=|author=Sablia, John A.|edition=|pages=41–63|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195177299.001.0001|editor=David G. Brohmley}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eileen Barker]] noted that there five sources of information on [[new religious movements]] (NRMs): the information provided by such groups themselves, that provided by ex-members as well as the friends and relatives of members, organisations that collect information on NRMs, the mainstream media, and academics studying such phenomena.{{sfn|Barker|1989|pp=vii-ix}}

The study of new religions is unified by its topic of interest, rather than by its [[methodology]], and is therefore [[interdisciplinary]] in nature.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2004|1p=8|2a1=Melton|2y=2004b|2p=16}} A sizeable body of scholarly literature on new religions has been published, most of it produced by [[social science|social scientists]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bromley|1y=2012|1p=13|2a1=Hammer|2a2=Rothstein|2y=2012|2p=2}} Among the disciplines that NRS uses are anthropology, history, psychology, religious studies, and sociology.{{sfn|Bromley|2012|p=13}} Of these approaches, sociology played a particularly prominent role in the development of the field,{{sfn|Bromley|2012|p=13}} resulting in it being initially confined largely to a narrow array of sociological questions.{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2012|p=5}} This came to change in later scholarship, which began to apply theories and methods initially developed for examining more mainstream religions to the study of new ones.{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2012|p=5}}

The majority of research has been directed toward those new religions which have attracted a greater deal of public controversy; less controversial NRMs have tended to be the subject of less scholarly research.{{sfn|Melton|2004b|p=20}} It has also been noted that scholars of new religions have often avoided researching certain movements which tend instead to be studied by scholars from other backgrounds; the [[feminist spirituality]] movement is usually examined by scholars of [[women's studies]], African-American new religions by scholars of [[Africana studies]], and Native American new religions by scholars of [[Native American studies]].{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=8}}

==Historical development==
{{double image|right|Massimo Introvigne.jpg|208|Eileen Barker.jpg|140|Scholarly organisations devoted to the study of NRMs have been formed by academics like Massimo Introvigne (left) and Eileen Barker (right)}}

In Japan, the academic study of new religions appeared in the years following the Second World War.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=3}}&lt;ref name="Gallagher, Eugene V 2007"&gt;Gallagher, Eugene V. 2007. "Compared to What? 'Cults' and 'New Religious Movements.'" History of Religions 47(2/3): 212.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s American sociologist [[John Lofland (sociologist)|John Lofland]] lived with Unification Church [[missionary]] [[Young Oon Kim]] and a small group of American church members in California and studied their activities in trying to promote their beliefs and win new members. Lofland noted that most of their efforts were ineffective and that most of the people who joined did so because of personal relationships with other members, often family relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/conversion.htm Conversion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121122133/http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/conversion.htm |date=2012-01-21 }}, [http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Unification.htm Unification Church] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113080905/http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Unification.htm |date=2012-01-13 }}, ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Society'', Hartford Institute for Religion Research, [[Hartford Seminary]]&lt;/ref&gt; Lofland published his findings in 1964 as a doctoral thesis entitled: 'The World Savers: A Field Study of Cult Processes', and in 1966 in book form by [[Prentice-Hall]] as ''[[Doomsday Cult: A Study of Conversion, Proselytization, and Maintenance of Faith]]''. It is considered to be one of the most important and widely cited studies of the process of [[religious conversion]], as well as one of the first sociological studies of a new religious movement.&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America: African diaspora traditions and other American innovations'', Volume 5 of Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America, W.

In Western nations the study of new religions became a distinct field in the 1970s;{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=4}} prior to this, new religions had been examined from varying perspectives, with [[Pentecostalism]] for instance being studied by [[church history|church historians]] and [[cargo cults]] by anthropologists.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=4}} This Western  academic study of new religions emerged in response to growing public concerns regarding the emergence of various NRMs during the 1970s.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2004|1p=3|2a1=Melton|2y=2004b|2p=17}} By the latter part of that decade, increasing numbers of papers on new religions were being presented at the annual conferences of the [[American Academy of Religion]], [[Society for the Scientific Study of Religion]], and the [[Association for the Sociology of Religion]].{{sfn|Melton|2004b|p=20}} The manner in which the scholarly study of new religions rose to prominence due to the public perception that these movements were social threats bore similarities with the manner in which [[Islamic studies]] grew in Western nations following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=8}} The study of new religions would only be fully embraced by the Western [[religious studies]] establishment in the 1990s.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=4}}

In 1988, the charity [[INFORM]] (Information Network Focus on Religious Movements) was established by Barker, who was then a professor of sociology at the [[London School of Economics]]. The organisation was supported by the UK Home Office and the British established churches and was designed to conduct research and disseminate accurate information about new religions.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|pp=105–106}}
Barker established INFORM due to her "conviction that a great deal of unnecessary suffering has resulted from ignorance of the nature and characteristics of the current wave of [NRMs] in the West."{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=vii}}
Also in 1988, the Italian scholar [[Massimo Introvigne]] established [[CESNUR]] (Centre for Studies on New Religions) in [[Turin]]; it brought together academics studying NRMs in both Europe and North America.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|pp=106–107}} In the United States, CESNUR gained representation through the [[Institute for the Study of American Religion]] in [[Santa Barbara, California]], which was directed by [[J.

Scholars of new religion often operate in a politicised environment given that their research can be cited in legal briefs and judicial decisions regarding NRMs.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=6}} In Barker's view, academic research into NRMs had practical applications in dealing with the problems that people experience with regard to NRMs.{{sfn|Barker|1989|pp=x–xi}} It can, for example, provide accurate information about a particular religious movement that can help guide an individual's reactions to the group; "an awareness of the complexity of a situation might help people to avoid precipitous actions that would later have been regretted."{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=xi}} However, given that scholars of new religions often reject the stereotypes about "cults" promoted by the anti-cultist movements, they have often been criticised by proponents of the latter.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=6}} Anti-cult groups have sometimes criticised scholarly groups such as these, claiming that they uncritically believe what NRMs tell them, that they are pro-NRM, or that they ignore the issues raised by ex-members.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=109}} They sometimes have accused academic researchers of being "[[cult apologists]]".{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2004|1p=7|2a1=Melton|2y=2004b|2p=21}}

[[File:American Academy of Religion (logo).png|thumb]]
The '''American Academy of Religion''' ('''AAR''') is the world's largest association of [[scholar]]s in the [[List of academic disciplines|field]] of [[religious studies]] and related topics.  It is a nonprofit member association, 
serving as a professional and learned society for scholars involved in the academic study of religion. It has some 10,000 members worldwide, with the largest concentration being in the United States and Canada. AAR members are university and college professors, independent scholars, secondary teachers, clergy, seminarians, students, and interested lay-people.

== History ==

AAR was founded in 1909 as the Association of Biblical Instructors in American Colleges and Secondary Schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gearon|first1=Liam|title=MasterClass in Religious Education: Transforming Teaching and Learning|date=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|location=London / New York|isbn=9781441160065|page=40|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/825398792|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was changed to National Association of Biblical Instructors (NABI) in 1933. The American Academy of Religion was adopted as the organization name in 1963&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=Elizabeth|title=Founding the Fathers|date=2011|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-4319-2|page=8|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/794700594|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to reflect its broader, inclusive mission to foster the academic study of all religions.&lt;ref&gt;

Presidents of the AAR have included well-known scholars such as [[Judith Plaskow]], [[Mark Juergensmeyer]], [[Wendy Doniger]], [[Emilie Townes]], [[Peter J. Paris]], [[Rebecca Chopp]], and [[Elizabeth A. Clark]].

== Publications ==

[[Oxford University Press]] publishes ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]]'' on behalf of the AAR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://jaar.oxfordjournals.org
 |title=Journal of the American Academy of Religion
 |work=Oxford University Press Journals website
 |accessdate=2011-04-09
}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Religious Studies News'' is the quarterly newspaper of record for the organization; it transitioned from a print to online-only publication in 2010. AAR published the online book review Reading Religion. AAR publishes five book series through Oxford University Press: Academy; Reflection and Theory in the Study of Religion; Religion, Culture, and Theory; Religion in Translation; and Teaching Religious Studies. AAR presents awards each year to notable books in the study of religion. It offers three categories of Awards for Excellence: Analytical-Descriptive Studies, Historical Studies, and Constructive-Reflective Studies.

== Annual meeting ==

AAR hosts an Annual Meeting each year in November. The AAR Annual Meeting is the world's largest meeting for religious studies scholars. Over 400 events, including meetings, receptions, and academic sessions, occur on the AAR program alone; hundreds more, hosted by affiliated societies and institutions, occur over the course of the meeting. Some 10,000 people attend the AAR Annual Meeting; the location of the meeting changes each year. The AAR Annual Meeting program is developed entirely by volunteers involved in program units representing disciplines and sub-disciplines within the field.

== Other activities ==

AAR offers activities on a regional level for its members. Professional development resources such as research grants, career services, and scholarships are some of the member benefits. AAR also advocates the importance of the critical study of religion on institutional and national levels.

'''Animatism''' is a term coined by British [[anthropologist]] Robert Marett to refer to "a belief in a generalized, impersonal power over which people have some measure of control".&lt;ref name="Ferraro, Gary 2008. p. 340"&gt;Ferraro, Gary. 2008. ''Cultural Anthropology: An Applied Perspective, 7th ed.'' Belmont, CA: Thompson Wadsworth. p. 340&lt;/ref&gt; Marett argues that certain cultures believe "people, animals, plants, and inanimate objects were endowed with certain powers, which were both impersonal and supernatural."&lt;ref name="Ferraro, Gary 2008. p. 340" /&gt; ''[[Mana]]'', Marett states, is a concentrated form of animatistic force found within any of these objects that confer power, strength, and success.&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro, Gary. 2008.

{{Philosophy of religion sidebar &lt;!--|God--&gt;}}

The '''argument from miracles''' is an argument for the [[Existence of God|existence of]] [[God]] &lt;!--and/or gods?--&gt; that relies on the belief that events [[Eyewitness testimony|witnessed and described]] as [[miracle]]s –&amp;nbsp;i.e. as events not explicable by natural or scientific laws&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/miracle?q=miracle Miracle] at oxforddictionaries.com.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– indicate the intervention of the [[supernatural]].

One example of this argument is the [[Christological argument]]: the claim that historical evidence proves that [[Resurrection of Jesus|Jesus Christ rose from the dead]] and that this can only be explained if God exists. Another is the claim that many of the [[Qur'an]]'s [[Prophecy|prophecies]] have been fulfilled and that this too can only be explained if God ([[Allah]]) exists.

Defenders of the argument include [[C. S. Lewis]], [[G. K. Chesterton]] and [[William of Ockham]].

== Criticisms ==

One counter-argument to the argument from miracles is the [[argument from inconsistent revelations]], which states that multiple incompatible miracles are alleged to have occurred which provide evidence for different religions. Not all these can be correct.

Another counter-argument is [[Occam's razor]], which can be used to argue that God is unnecessary to explain miracles for which natural explanations can be found. In his documentary ''[[The Root of All Evil?]]'', British evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] utilises this argument when examining the supposed miracles in [[Lourdes]], France. According to [[Catholic theology]], supernatural cures occur in the area, but Dawkins expresses doubts as to their divine nature, noting that all the recorded cures comprise diseases which may have healed by themselves without the need for divine intervention.

Modern theologians rely on the arguments by [[David Hume]], an eighteenth-century Scottish philosopher, who is  known today for his skepticism and naturalism. Before making any claims, Hume explains the principle of evidence: the only way that we can assess the credibility of two claims is by weighing evidence. According to him, because evidence for miracles is always limited, we do not have a reason to believe in them.

The '''Chester Ronning Centre for the Study of Religion and Public Life''' is a [[research centre]] on the [[University of Alberta]]'s [[Augustana University College|Augustana Campus]] in [[Camrose, Alberta]]. It is the first such centre in a public university in Canada to focus on the intersection of religion and public life.

==Background==
The Ronning Centre is named in for [[Chester Alvin Ronning]], Canadian diplomat and principal of Camrose Lutheran College from 1927 to 1942. The Chester Ronning Centre for the Study of Religion and Public Life grew from the merger of [[Augustana University College]] with the [[University of Alberta]] in 2004. The Centre's activities involve a diversity of communities. It seeks to enhance debate on contested issues through lively discussion.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.augustana.ualberta.ca/research/centres/ronningcentre/aboutus/ University of Alberta, Augustana Campus,

'''Christian culture''' is the [[cultural practice]]s common to [[Christianity]].  With the rapid expansion of Christianity to Europe, Syria, [[Mesopotamia]], [[Asia Minor]], Egypt, Ethiopia, and India and by the end of the 4th&amp;nbsp;century it had also become the official [[state church of the Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Religion in the Roman Empire, Wiley-Blackwell, by James B.

[[Western culture]], throughout most of its history, has been nearly equivalent to Christian culture, and many of the population of the Western hemisphere could broadly be described as [[Cultural Christian|cultural Christians]]. The notion of "Europe" and the "Western World" has been intimately connected with the concept of "[[Christendom|Christianity and Christendom]]" many even attribute Christianity for being the link that created a unified [[European identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawson|first=Christopher|title=Crisis in Western Education|year=1961|isbn=9780813216836|edition=reprint|author2=Glenn Olsen|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Paul Legutko of Stanford University said the Catholic Church is "at the center of the development of the values, ideas, science, laws, and institutions which constitute what we call Western civilization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Review of ''How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization'' by Thomas Woods, Jr. |url=http://www.nrbookservice.com/products/bookpage.asp?prod_cd=c6664 |work=National Review Book Service |accessdate=16 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Western culture contained several polytheistic religions during its early years under the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Roman Empire]]s, as the centralized Roman power waned, the dominance of the Catholic Church was the only consistent force in Western Europe.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Koch|first=Carl|title=The Catholic Church: Journey, Wisdom, and Mission|year=1994|publisher=St. Mary's Press|location=Early Middle Ages|isbn=978-0-88489-298-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the [[Age of Enlightenment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koch|first=Carl|title=The Catholic Church: Journey, Wisdom, and Mission|year=1994|publisher=St. Mary's Press|location=The Age of Enlightenment|isbn=978-0-88489-298-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian culture guided the course of philosophy, literature, art, music and science.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1994"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawson|first=Christopher|title=Crisis in Western Education|year=1961|isbn=978-0-8132-1683-6|edition=reprint|first2=Glenn |last2=Olsen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian disciplines of the respective arts have subsequently developed into [[Christian philosophy]], [[Christian art]], [[Christian music]], [[Christian literature]] etc. Art and literature, law, education, and politics were preserved in the teachings of the Church, in an environment that, otherwise, would have probably seen their loss.

{{Main|Church architecture}}
[[File:Tomb of Jesus3.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|Tomb of [[Jesus]] in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|Holy Sepulchre church]] in [[Jerusalem]].]]
The architecture of cathedrals, basilicas and abbey churches is characterised by the buildings' large scale and follows one of several branching traditions of form, function and style that all ultimately derive from the [[Early Christian architecture|Early Christian architectural]] traditions established in the [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Constantinian]] period.

Cathedrals in particular, as well as many [[abbey]] churches and [[basilica]]s, have certain complex structural forms that are found less often in [[parish church]]es. They also tend to display a higher level of contemporary architectural style and the work of accomplished craftsmen, and occupy a status both ecclesiastical and social that an ordinary parish church does not have.  Such a cathedral or great church is generally one of the finest buildings within its region and is a focus of local pride. Many cathedrals and basilicas, and a number of abbey churches are among the world's most renowned works of architecture. These include [[St. Peter's Basilica]], [[Notre Dame de Paris]], [[Cologne Cathedral]], [[Salisbury Cathedral]], [[Prague Cathedral]], [[Lincoln Cathedral]], the [[Basilica of St Denis]], the Basilica of [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], the [[Basilica of San Vitale]], [[St Mark's Basilica]], [[Westminster Abbey]], [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]], [[Washington National Cathedral]], [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception]], [[Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis]], Gaudí's incomplete [[Sagrada Familia]] and the ancient church of [[Hagia Sophia]], now a museum.

The earliest large churches date from [[Late Antiquity]]. As Christianity and the construction of churches and cathedrals spread throughout the world, their manner of building was dependent upon local materials and local techniques. Different [[Architectural style|styles of architecture]] developed and their fashion spread, carried by the establishment of monastic orders, by the posting of bishops from one region to another and by the travelling of master [[stonemason]]s who served as architects.&lt;ref&gt;John Harvey, ''The Gothic World''.&lt;/ref&gt; The styles of the great church buildings are successively known as [[Early Christian architecture|Early Christian]], [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]], [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]], [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]], various [[Victorian architecture|Revival]] styles of the late 18th to early 20th centuries and [[Modern architecture|Modern]].&lt;ref name="BF"/&gt; Overlaid on each of the academic styles are the regional characteristics. Some of these characteristics are so typical of a particular country or region that they appear, regardless of style, in the architecture of churches designed many centuries apart.&lt;ref name="BF"/&gt;

[[Christian art]] is [[sacred art]] which uses themes and imagery from Christianity. Most Christian groups use or have used art to some extent, although some have had strong objections to some forms of religious image, and there have been major periods of [[iconoclasm]] within Christianity.

Images of [[Jesus]] and narrative scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' are the most common subjects, and scenes from the [[Old Testament]] play a part in the art of most denominations.  Images of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and saints are much rarer in Protestant art than that of [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]].

Christianity makes far wider use of images than related religions, in which figurative representations are forbidden, such as [[Aniconism in Islam|Islam]] and [[Aniconism in Judaism|Judaism]].  However, there is also a considerable history of [[aniconism in Christianity]] from various periods.

===Illumination===
{{Main|Illuminated manuscript}}

[[File:Armenian-manuscript-CIMG1727.JPG|thumb|upright|Armenian manuscript of 1053. Work of Johannes]]
An [[illuminated manuscript]] is a [[manuscript]] in which the [[Writing|text]] is supplemented by the addition of decoration. The earliest surviving substantive illuminated manuscripts are from the period AD 400 to 600, primarily produced in Ireland, [[Constantinople]] and Italy. The majority of surviving manuscripts are from the [[Middle Ages]], although many illuminated manuscripts survive from the 15th century [[Renaissance]], along with a very limited number from [[Late Antiquity]].

Most illuminated manuscripts were created as [[codex|codices]], which had superseded scrolls; some isolated single sheets survive. A very few illuminated manuscript fragments survive on [[papyrus]]. Most medieval manuscripts, illuminated or not, were written on [[parchment]] (most commonly of [[calfskin|calf]], sheep, or goat skin), but most manuscripts important enough to illuminate were written on the best quality of parchment, called [[vellum]], traditionally made of unsplit [[calfskin]], though high quality parchment from other skins was also called ''parchment''.

===Iconography===
{{Main|Iconoclasm|Religious image|Christian icons|Christian symbolism}}

[[File:St. Theodor.jpg|thumb|upright|There are few old ceramic icons, such as this [[Theodore Stratelates|St. Theodor]] icon which dates to ca. 900 (from [[Preslav]], Bulgaria)]]
Christian art began, about two centuries after Christ, by borrowing motifs from Roman Imperial imagery, classical Greek and Roman religion and popular art. [[Religious images]] are used to some extent by the [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic]] Christian faith, and often contain highly complex iconography, which reflects centuries of accumulated tradition. In the [[Late Antique]] period iconography began to be standardised, and to relate more closely to [[Biblical]] texts, although many gaps in the [[canonical Gospel]] narratives were plugged with matter from the [[apocrypha|apocryphal gospels]]. Eventually the Church would succeed in weeding most of these out, but some remain, like the ox and ass in the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Christ]].

An [[icon]] is a religious work of art, most commonly a painting, from [[Orthodox Christianity]]. Christianity has used [[Christian symbolism|symbolism]] from its very beginnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Symbolism}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both East and West, numerous iconic types of Christ, [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and saints and other subjects were developed; the number of named types of icons of Mary, with or without the infant Christ, was especially large in the East, whereas [[Christ Pantocrator]] was much the commonest image of Christ.

[[Christian symbolism]] invests objects or actions with an inner meaning expressing Christian ideas. Christianity has borrowed from the common stock of significant symbols known to most periods and to all regions of the world. [[Religious symbolism]] is effective when it appeals to both the intellect and the emotions. Especially important depictions of Mary include the [[Hodegetria]] and [[Panagia]] types. Traditional models evolved for narrative paintings, including large cycles covering the events of the Life of Christ, the [[Life of the Virgin]], parts of the Old Testament, and, increasingly, the lives of popular [[saint]]s. Especially in the West, a system of [[emblem|attributes]] developed for [[Saint symbology|identifying individual]] figures of saints by a standard appearance and symbolic objects held by them; in the East they were more likely to identified by text labels.

Each [[saint]] has a story and a reason why he or she led an exemplary life. Symbols have been used to tell these stories throughout the history of the Church. A number of Christian [[saint]]s are traditionally represented by a symbol or [[Icon|iconic motif]] associated with their life, termed an attribute or [[emblem]], in order to identify them. The study of these forms part of [[iconography]] in [[Art history]].

=== Eastern Christian art ===
{{main|Byzantine art}}
[[File:Spas vsederzhitel sinay.jpg|thumb|upright|6th? century [[icon]] of [[Christ Pantocrator]], a very rare pre-[[Byzantine Iconoclasm|Iconoclasm]] icon.]]
The dedication of [[Constantinople]] as capital in 330 AD created a great new Christian artistic centre for the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], which soon became a separate political unit. Major Constantinopolitan churches built under Constantine and his son, [[Constantius II]], included the original foundations of [[Hagia Sophia]] and the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]].&lt;ref&gt;T. Mathews, ''The early churches of Constantinople: architecture and liturgy'' (University Park, 1971); N. Henck, "Constantius ho Philoktistes?", ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'' 55 (2001), 279–304 ([http://www.doaks.org/DOP55/DP55ch14.pdf available online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327035204/http://www.doaks.org/DOP55/DP55ch14.pdf |date=27 March 2009 }}).&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Western Roman Empire]] disintegrated and was taken over by "barbarian" peoples, the art of the Byzantine Empire reached levels of sophistication, power and artistry not previously seen in Christian art, and set the standards for those parts of the West still in touch with Constantinople.
[[File:Rhodes Siana2 tango7174.jpg|thumb|upright|Church of Agios Panteleimonos, Greece.]]
This achievement was checked by the controversy over the use of ''graven images'', and the proper interpretation of the Second Commandment, which led to the crisis of [[Byzantine iconoclasm|Iconoclasm]] or destruction of religious images, which racked the Empire between 726 and 843. The restoration of Orthodoxy resulted in a strict standardization of religious imagery within the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Church]]. Byzantine art became increasingly conservative, as the form of images themselves, many accorded [[Acheiropoieta|divine origin]] or thought to have been be painted by [[Saint Luke]] or other figures, was held to have a status not far off that of a scriptural text. They could be copied, but not improved upon. As a concession to Iconoclast sentiment, monumental religious sculpture was effectively banned. Neither of these attitudes were held in Western Europe, but Byzantine art nonetheless had great influence there until the [[High Middle Ages]], and remained very popular long after that, with vast numbers of icons of the [[Cretan School]] exported to Europe as late as the [[Renaissance]]. Where possible, Byzantine artists were borrowed for projects such as mosaics in [[Venice]] and [[Palermo]]. The enigmatic frescoes at [[Castelseprio]] may be an example of work by a Greek artist working in Italy.

The art of [[Eastern Catholicism]] has always been rather closer to the Orthodox art of Greece and Russia, and in countries near the Orthodox world, notably Poland, Catholic art has many Orthodox influences. The [[Black Madonna of Częstochowa]] may well have been of Byzantine origin – it has been repainted and this is hard to tell. Other images that are certainly of Greek origin, like the [[Salus Populi Romani]] and [[Our Lady of Perpetual Help]], both icons in Rome, have been subjects of specific veneration for centuries.

Although the influence has often been resisted, especially in Russia, Catholic art has also affected Orthodox depictions in many respects, especially in countries like Romania, and in the post-Byzantine [[Cretan School]], which led [[Greek Orthodox]] art under Venetian rule in the 15th and 16th centuries. [[El Greco]] left Crete when relatively young, but [[Michael Damaskinos]] returned after a brief period in Venice, and was able to switch between Italian and Greek styles. Even the traditionalist [[Theophanes the Cretan]], working mainly on [[Mount Athos]], nevertheless shows unmistakable Western influence.

Many [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] states in Eastern Europe, as well as to some degree the [[Muslim world|Muslim]] states of the eastern [[Mediterranean]], preserved many aspects of the empire's culture and art for centuries afterward. A number of states contemporary with the [[Byzantine Empire]] were culturally influenced by it, without actually being part of it (the "[[Byzantine commonwealth]]"). These included [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], [[History of Medieval Serbia|Serbia]], and the [[Kievan Rus'|Rus]], as well as some non-Orthodox states like the [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], which had close ties to the Byzantine Empire despite being in other respects part of western European culture. Art produced by Eastern Orthodox Christians living in the [[Ottoman Empire]] is often called "post-Byzantine." Certain artistic traditions that originated in the Byzantine Empire, particularly in regard to icon painting and church architecture, are maintained in Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Russia and other Eastern Orthodox countries to the present day.

=== Roman Catholic art ===
{{main|Roman Catholic art}}
[[File:Estasi di Santa Teresa.jpg|thumb|upright|Bernini's ''Ecstasy of Saint Theresa'']]
[[Roman Catholic art]] consists of all visual works produced in an attempt to illustrate, supplement and portray in tangible form the teachings of the [[Catholic Church]]. This includes sculpture, painting, mosaics, metalwork, embroidery and even architecture. Catholic art has played a leading role in the history and development of Western Art since at least the fourth century. The principal subject matter of Catholic Art has been the life and times of [[Jesus Christ]], along with those of his disciples, the saints, and the events of the Jewish [[Old Testament]].

The earliest surviving art works are the painted frescoes on the walls of the [[catacomb]]s and meeting houses of the persecuted Christians of the Roman Empire. The Christian Church in Rome was influenced by the Roman style of art and the religious Christian artists of the time. The stone [[Sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] of Roman Christians exhibit the earliest surviving carved statuary of Jesus, Mary and other biblical figures. The legalisation of Christianity transformed Catholic art, which adopted richer forms such as [[mosaics]] and illuminated manuscripts. The [[iconoclasm]] controversy briefly divided the eastern and western churches, after which artistic development progressed in separate directions. [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art]] flowered in the Western Church as the style of painting and statuary moved in an increasingly naturalistic direction. The Protestant Reformation produced new waves of image-destruction, to which the Church responded with the dramatic and emotive [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] styles. In the 19th century the leadership in western art moved away from the Catholic Church which, after embracing historical revivalism was increasingly affected by the modernist movement, a movement that in its "rebellion" against nature, counters the Church's emphasis on nature as a good creation of God.

Renaissance artists such as [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]], [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Caravaggio]], and [[Titian]], were among a multitude of innovative virtuosos sponsored by the Church.&lt;ref name="Duffy133"&gt;Duffy, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

British art historian [[Kenneth Clark]] wrote that Western Europe's first "great age of civilisation" was ready to begin around the year 1000. From 1100, he wrote, monumental abbeys and cathedrals were constructed and decorated with sculptures, hangings, mosaics and works belonging one of the greatest epochs of art and providing stark contrast to the monotonous and cramped conditions of ordinary living during the period. [[Abbot Suger]] of the [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbey of St. Denis]] is considered an influential early patron of Gothic architecture and believed that love of beauty brought people closer to God: "The dull mind rises to truth through that which is material". Clarke calls this "the intellectual background of all the sublime works of art of the next century and in fact has remained the basis of our belief of the value of art until today".&lt;ref name="Civilisation, BBC 1969"&gt;[[Kenneth Clarke]]; ''Civilisation'', BBC, SBN 563 10279 9; first published 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, during [[The Renaissance]] and [[Counter-Reformation]], Catholic artists produced many of the unsurpassed masterpieces of [[Western art]] – often inspired by Biblical themes: from Michelangelo's ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' and ''[[Pietà]]'' sculptures, to Da Vinci's ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|Last Supper]]'' and Raphael's various ''Madonna'' paintings. Referring to a "great outburst of creative energy such as took place in Rome between 1620 and 1660", Kenneth Clarke wrote:&lt;ref name="Civilisation, BBC 1969"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]ith a single exception, the great artists of the time were all sincere, conforming Christians. [[Guercino]] spent much of his mornings in prayer; [[Bernini]] frequently went into retreats and practised the [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Spiritual Exercises]] of [[Ignatius of Loyola|Saint Ignatius]]; [[Rubens]] attended Mass every morning before beginning work. The exception was [[Caravaggio]], who was like the hero of a modern play, except that he happened to paint very well.

This conformism was not based on fear of the Inquisition, but on the perfectly simple belief that the faith which had inspired the great saints of the preceding generation was something by which a man should regulate his life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Protestant art ===
[[File:Hans Holbein d. J. 017.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hans Holbein the Younger]]'s ''Noli me tangere'' a relatively rare Protestant oil painting of Christ from the Reformation period. It is small, and generally naturalistic in style, avoiding iconic elements like the [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], which is barely discernible.]]
The [[Protestant Reformation]] during the 16th century in Europe almost entirely rejected the existing tradition of Catholic art, and very often destroyed as much of it as it could reach.  A new artistic tradition developed, producing far smaller quantities of art that followed [[Protestant]] agendas and diverged drastically from the southern European tradition and the [[Renaissance humanist|humanist]] art produced during the [[High Renaissance]].  In turn, the Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]] both reacted against and responded to Protestant criticisms of [[art in Roman Catholicism]] to produce a more stringent style of Catholic art.  Protestant religious art both embraced Protestant values and assisted in the proliferation of Protestantism, but the amount of religious art produced in Protestant countries was hugely reduced.  Artists in Protestant countries diversified into secular forms of art like [[history painting]], [[landscape painting]], [[portrait painting]] and [[still life]].

Prominent painters with Protestant background were, for example, [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]], [[Rembrandt]], and [[Vincent van Gogh]]. World literature was enriched by the works of [[Edmund Spenser]], [[John Milton]], [[John Bunyan]], [[John Donne]], [[John Dryden]], [[Daniel Defoe]], [[William Wordsworth]], [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Matthew Arnold]], [[Conrad Ferdinand Meyer]], [[Theodor Fontane]], [[Washington Irving]], [[Robert Browning]], [[Emily Dickinson]], [[Emily Brontë]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Thomas Stearns Eliot]], [[John Galsworthy]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[William Faulkner]], [[John Updike]], and many others.

== Music ==
{{Main|Christian music}}
[[Christian music]] is music that has been written to express either personal or a communal belief regarding Christian life and faith. Common themes of Christian music include [[praise]], [[worship]], [[penitence]], and [[lament]], and its forms vary widely across the world.

Like other forms of music the creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of Christian music varies according to culture and social context. Christian music is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, or as an entertainment product for the marketplace.

In music, Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern Western musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church,&lt;ref name="Hall100"&gt;Hall, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; and an enormous body of religious music has been composed for it through the ages. This led directly to the emergence and development of European classical music, and its many derivatives. The [[Baroque]] style, which encompassed music, art, and architecture, was particularly encouraged by the post-Reformation Catholic Church as such forms offered a means of religious expression that was stirring and emotional, intended to stimulate religious fervor.&lt;ref name="Murray45"&gt;Murray, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The list of Catholic composers and Catholic sacred music which have a prominent place in Western culture is extensive, but includes [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s ''[[Ode to Joy]]''; [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s ''[[Ave verum corpus]]''; [[Franz Schubert]]'s ''[[Ave Maria]]'', [[César Franck]]'s ''[[Panis angelicus]]'', and [[Antonio Vivaldi]]'s ''[[Gloria (Vivaldi)|Gloria]]''.

[[Martin Luther]], [[Paul Gerhardt]], [[George Wither]], [[Isaac Watts]], [[Charles Wesley]], [[William Cowper]], and many other authors and composers created well-known church hymns. Musicians like [[Heinrich Schütz]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[George Frederick Handel]], [[Henry Purcell]], [[Johannes Brahms]], and [[Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy]] composed great works of music.

==Literature and poetry ==
{{Main|Christian literature|Christian poetry}}
[[File:Bible.malmesbury.arp.jpg|200px|thumbnail|[[Gutenberg Bible]]. The [[Bible]] was [[Authorship of the Bible|authored]] by Jews during the [[Iron Age]]s and the [[Classical era]]. It comprise cultural values, basic human values, mythology and religious beliefs of both Judaism and Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/64496/biblical-literature|title=biblical literature|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Christian literature]] is writing that deals with Christian themes and incorporates the Christian world view. This constitutes a huge body of extremely varied writing. [[Christian poetry]] is any poetry that contains Christian teachings, themes, or references. The influence of Christianity on poetry has been great in any area that Christianity has taken hold. Christian poems often directly reference the Bible, while others provide [[allegory]].

While falling within the strict definition of literature, the Bible is not generally considered literature. However, the Bible has been treated and appreciated as literature; the [[Bible]] is a corner stone of Western civilization.&lt;ref name="Perry2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marvin Perry|title=Western Civilization: A Brief History, Volume I: To 1789|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U2pnv0Aoh2EC&amp;pg=PA33|date=1 January 2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1-111-83720-1|pages=33–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[King James Version]] in particular has long been considered a masterpiece of English prose, whatever may be thought of its religious significance. The Authorized Version has been called "the most influential version of the most influential book in the world, in what is now its most influential language", "the most important book in English religion and culture", and "the most celebrated book in the [[English-speaking world]]". [[David Crystal]] has estimated that it is responsible for 257 idioms in English, examples include [[feet of clay]] and [[wikt:sow the wind, reap the whirlwind|reap the whirlwind]]. Furthermore, prominent [[atheist]] figures such as the late [[Christopher Hitchens]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] have praised the King James Version as being "a giant step in the maturing of English literature" and "a great work of literature", respectively, with Dawkins then adding, "A native speaker of English who has never read a word of the King James Bible is verging on the barbarian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2011/05/hitchens-201105?currentPage=all|title=When the King Saved God|year=2011|publisher=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|accessdate=10 August 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/may/19/richard-dawkins-king-james-bible|title=Why I want all our children to read the King James Bible|date=20 May 2012|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate= 10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several retellings of the Bible, or parts of the Bible, have also been made with the aim of emphasising its literary qualities.

[[File:Saints of the Golden Legend collage.jpg|200px|thumbnail|The stories of the saints which are preserved in the ''[[Golden Legend]]'']]
In [[Byzantine literature]], four different cultural elements are recognised: the [[Greek literature|Greek]], the Christian, the [[Latin literature|Roman]], and the Oriental. Byzantine literature is often classified in five groups: historians and annalists, encyclopaedists (Patriarch Photios, [[Michael Psellus]], and [[Michael Choniates]] are regarded as the greatest encyclopaedists of Byzantium) and essayists, and writers of secular poetry. The only genuine heroic epic of the Byzantines is the ''[[Digenis Acritas]]''. The remaining two groups include the new literary species: ecclesiastical and theological literature, and popular poetry.&lt;ref name="Mango275–276"&gt;{{harvnb|Mango|2007|pp=275–276}}.&lt;/ref&gt; And it was in [[Alexandria]] that Graeco-Oriental Christianity had its birth. There the [[Septuagint]] translation had been made; there that that fusion of Greek philosophy and Jewish religion took place which culminated in [[Philo]]; there flourished the mystic speculative [[Neoplatonism]] associated with [[Plotinus]] and [[Porphyry of Tyros|Porphyry]]. At Alexandria the great Greek ecclesiastical writers worked alongside pagan rhetoricians and philosophers; several were born here, e.g. [[Origen]], [[Athanasius]], and his opponent [[Arius]], also [[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril]] and [[Synesius]]. On Egyptian soil [[monasticism]] began and thrived. After Alexandria, [[Antioch]] held great prestige, where a school of Christian commentators flourished under [[St. John Chrysostom]] and where later arose the Christian universal chronicles. In surrounding Syria, we find the germs of Greek ecclesiastical poetry, while from neighboring [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] came [[St. John of Damascus]], one of the [[Church Fathers|Greek Fathers]].

The list of Catholic authors and literary works is vast. With a literary tradition spanning two millennia, the Bible and [[Papal Encyclicals]] have been constants of the Catholic canon but countless other historical works may be listed as noteworthy in terms of their influence on Western society. From late Antiquity, [[St Augustine]]'s book [[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]], which outlines his sinful youth and conversion to Christianity, is widely considered to be the first autobiography of ever written in the canon of [[Western Literature]]. Augustine profoundly influenced the coming medieval worldview. The ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', written 1265–1274, is the best-known work of [[Thomas Aquinas]] (c.1225–1274), and although unfinished, "one of the classics of the history of philosophy and one of the most influential works of Western literature."&lt;ref&gt;Ross, James F., "Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa theologiae'' (ca. 1273), Christian Wisdom Explained Philosophically", in ''The Classics of Western Philosophy: A Reader's Guide'', (eds.) Jorge J. E. Gracia, Gregory M. Reichberg, Bernard N. Schumacher (Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 2003), p. 165. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6jAcwGItzssC&amp;lpg=PA165&amp;ots=MXldxkl9sr&amp;dq=james%20f%20ross%20philosopher&amp;pg=PA165#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended as a manual for beginners in theology and a compendium of all of the main [[theology|theological]] teachings of the Church. It presents the reasoning for almost all points of Christian theology in the West. The epic poetry of the Italian [[Dante]] and his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' of the late [[Middle Ages]] is also considered immensely influential. The English statesman and philosopher, [[Thomas More]], wrote the seminal work [[Utopia (book)|Utopia]] in 1516. [[St Ignatius Loyola]], a key figure in the Catholic counter-reformation, is the author of an influential book of meditations known as the ''[[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Spiritual Exercises]]''.

== Philosophy==
{{Main|Christian philosophy|Scholasticism}}
[[File:Augustine Confessiones.jpg|thumb|upright|''Confessions'' by St. [[Augustine of Hippo]]]]
[[Christian philosophy]] is a term to describe the fusion of various fields of philosophy with the [[Theology|theological]] doctrines of Christianity. [[Scholasticism]], which means "that [which] belongs to the school", and was a method of learning taught by the [[academics]] (or ''school people'') of medieval universities c. 1100–1500. Scholasticism originally started to reconcile the philosophy of the ancient classical philosophers with medieval Christian theology. Scholasticism is not a philosophy or theology in itself but a tool and method for learning which places emphasis on [[dialectical reasoning]].

Medieval philosophy is the philosophy of Western Europe and the Middle East during the [[Middle Ages]], roughly extending from the Christianization of the [[Roman Empire]] until the Renaissance.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;Frederick Copleston, ''A History of Philosophy, Volume II: From Augustine to Scotus'' (Burns &amp; Oates, 1950), p. 1, dates medieval philosophy proper from the Carolingian Renaissance in the eighth century to the end of the fourteenth century, though he includes [[Augustine]] and the Patristic fathers as precursors. Desmond Henry, in Paul Edwards (ed.), ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Macmillan, 1967), vol. 5, pp. 252–257, starts with Augustine and ends with [[Nicole Oresme|Nicholas of Oresme]] in the late fourteenth century. David Luscombe, ''Medieval Thought'' (Oxford University Press, 1997), dates medieval philosophy from the conversion of [[Constantine I|Constantine]] in 312 to the [[Protestant Reformation]] in the 1520s. Christopher Hughes, in A.C. Grayling (ed.), ''Philosophy 2: Further through the Subject'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), covers philosophers from Augustine to Ockham. Jorge J.E. Gracia, in Nicholas Bunnin and E.P. Tsui-James (eds.), ''The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy'', 2nd ed. (Blackwell, 2003), p. 620, identifies medieval philosophy as running from Augustine to [[John of St. Thomas]] in the seventeenth century. Anthony Kenny, ''A New History of Western Philosophy, Volume II: Medieval Philosophy'' (Oxford University Press, 2005), begins with Augustine and ends with the Lateran Council of 1512.&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval philosophy is defined partly by the rediscovery and further development of classical [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] and [[Hellenistic philosophy]], and partly by the need to address theological problems and to integrate the then widespread sacred doctrines of [[Abrahamic religion]] ([[Islam]], [[Judaism]], and Christianity) with [[secularism|secular]] learning.

The history of western European medieval philosophy is traditionally divided into two main periods: the period in the [[Latin West]] following the [[Early Middle Ages]] until the 12th century, when the works of [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]] were preserved and cultivated; and the "golden age" of the 12th, 13th and 14th centuries in the Latin West, which witnessed the culmination of the recovery of ancient philosophy, and significant developments in the field of [[philosophy of religion]], [[logic]] and [[metaphysics]].
[[File:SummaTheologiae.jpg|thumb|upright|''Summa theologica'', Pars secunda, prima pars. (copy by Peter Schöffer, 1471)]]
The medieval era was disparagingly treated by the Renaissance humanists, who saw it as a barbaric "middle" period between the classical age of Greek and Roman culture, and the "rebirth" or ''renaissance'' of classical culture. Yet this period of nearly a thousand years was the longest period of philosophical development in Europe, and possibly the richest. [[Jorge Gracia]] has argued that "in intensity, sophistication, and achievement, the philosophical flowering in the thirteenth century could be rightly said to rival the golden age of Greek philosophy in the fourth century B.C."&lt;ref name="gracia"&gt;Gracia, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Some problems discussed throughout this period are the relation of [[faith]] to [[reason]], the existence and unity of God, the object of theology and [[metaphysics]], the problems of knowledge, of universals, and of individuation.

Philosophers from the Middle Ages include the Christian philosophers [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Boethius]], [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]], [[Gilbert of Poitiers]], [[Peter Abelard]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Bonaventure]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Duns Scotus]], [[William of Ockham]] and [[Jean Buridan]]; the Jewish philosophers [[Maimonides]] and [[Gersonides]]; and the [[Muslim]] philosophers [[Al-Kindi|Alkindus]], [[Al-Farabi|Alfarabi]], [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]], [[Avicenna]], [[Al-Ghazali|Algazel]], [[Ibn Bajjah|Avempace]], [[Ibn Tufail|Abubacer]], [[Ibn Khaldūn]], and [[Averroes]]. The medieval tradition of [[Scholasticism]] continued to flourish as late as the 17th century, in figures such as [[Francisco Suarez]] and [[John of St. Thomas]].

Aquinas, father of [[Thomism]], was immensely influential in Catholic Europe, placed a great emphasis on reason and argumentation, and was one of the first to use the new translation of Aristotle's metaphysical and epistemological writing. His work was a significant departure from the [[Neoplatonic]] and Augustinian thinking that had dominated much of early Scholasticism.

The Renaissance ("rebirth") was a period of transition between the Middle Ages and modern thought,&lt;ref name="contemporaries"&gt;Charles Schmitt and Quentin Skinner (eds.), ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'' (Cambridge University Press, 1988), p. 5, loosely define the period as extending "from the age of Ockham to the revisionary work of Bacon, Descartes and their contemporaries."&lt;/ref&gt; in which the recovery of classical texts helped shift philosophical interests away from technical studies in logic, metaphysics, and theology towards eclectic inquiries into morality, philology, and mysticism.&lt;ref name="renaissance3"&gt;Brian Copenhaver and Charles Schmitt, ''Renaissance Philosophy'' (Oxford University Press, 1992), p. 4: "one may identify the hallmark of Renaissance philosophy as an accelerated and enlarged interest, stimulated by newly available texts, in primary sources of Greek and Roman thought that were previously unknown or partially known or little read."&lt;/ref&gt; The study of the classics and the humane arts generally, such as history and literature, enjoyed a scholarly interest hitherto unknown in Christendom, a tendency referred to as [[humanism]].&lt;ref name="transmission"&gt;Jorge J.E. Gracia in Nicholas Bunnin and E.P. Tsui-James (eds.), ''The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy'', 2nd ed. (Blackwell, 2002), p. 621: "the humanists … restored man to the centre of attention and channeled their efforts to the recovery and transmission of classical learning, particularly in the philosophy of Plato."&lt;/ref&gt; Displacing the medieval interest in metaphysics and logic, the humanists followed [[Petrarch]] in making man and his virtues the focus of philosophy.&lt;ref name="intellectual"&gt;Charles B. Schmitt and Quentin Skinner (eds.), ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'', pp. 61 and 63: "From Petrarch the early humanists learnt their conviction that the revival of ''humanae literae'' was only the first step in a greater intellectual renewal" […] "the very conception of philosophy was changing because its chief object was now man—man was at centre of every inquiry".&lt;/ref&gt;

These new movements in philosophy developed contemporaneously with larger religious and political transformations in Europe: the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and the decline of [[feudalism]].  Though the theologians of the Protestant Reformation showed little direct interest in philosophy, their destruction of the traditional foundations of theological and intellectual authority harmonized with a revival of [[fideism]] and skepticism in thinkers such as [[Erasmus]], [[Montaigne]], and [[Francisco Sanches]].&lt;ref name="scepticism"&gt;Richard Popkin, ''The History of Scepticism from Savonarola to Bayle'' (Oxford University Press, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the gradual centralization of political power in nation-states was echoed by the emergence of secular political philosophies, as in the works of [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] (often described as the first modern political thinker, or a key turning point towards modern political thinking), [[Thomas More]], [[Erasmus]], [[Justus Lipsius]], [[Jean Bodin]], and [[Hugo Grotius]].&lt;ref name="renaissance5"&gt;Copenhaver and Schmitt, ''Renaissance Philosophy'', pp. 274–284.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="renaissance6"&gt;Schmitt and Skinner, ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'', pp. 430–452.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier attempts at reconciliation of Christianity with [[Newtonian mechanics]] appear quite different from later attempts at reconciliation with the newer scientific ideas of [[evolution]] or [[Theory of relativity|relativity]].&lt;ref name=habgood&gt;''Religion and Science'', [[John Habgood]], Mills &amp; Brown, 1964, pp., 11, 14–16, 48–55, 68–69, 90–91, 87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Habgood: pages 48-55 --&gt; Many early interpretations of evolution polarized themselves around a ''[[survival of the fittest|struggle for existence]].'' These ideas were significantly countered by later findings of universal [[sociobiology|patterns of biological cooperation]]. According to [[John Habgood]], all man really knows here is that the [[universe]] seems to be a mix of [[good and evil]], beauty and [[pain]], and that [[suffering]] may somehow be part of the process of creation. Habgood holds that Christians should not be surprised that suffering may be used creatively by God, given their faith in the symbol of the [[Christian cross|Cross]].&lt;ref name=habgood /&gt; &lt;!-- Habgood: page 68-69 --&gt;

Despite some opposition to pagan learning, many of the most distinguished classical scholars held high office in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Church]]. &lt;ref&gt; Some noteworthy exceptions to this tolerance include the closing of the [[Platonic Academy]] in 529; the [[obscurantism]] of [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]]; and the condemnations of [[Ioannis Italos]] and [[George Gemistos Plethon|Georgios Plethon]] for their devotion to ancient philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; The writings of antiquity never ceased to be cultivated in the [[Byzantine empire]] due to the impetus given to [[classical studies]] by the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]] of Athens in the 4th and 5th centuries, the vigor of the philosophical academy of [[Alexandria]], and to the services of the [[University of Constantinople]], which concerned itself entirely with secular subjects, to the exclusion of [[theology]],&lt;ref&gt;The faculty was composed exclusively of philosophers, scientists, rhetoricians, and [[philology|philologists]] ({{cite book | last=Tatakes |first=Vasileios N. |author2=Moutafakis, Nicholas J. | title=Byzantine Philosophy | year=2003 | publisher=Hackett Publishing|isbn=0-87220-563-0|pages=189}})&lt;/ref&gt; which was taught in the [[Halki seminary|Patriarchical Academy]]. Even the latter offered instruction in the ancient classics, and included literary, philosophical, and scientific texts in its curriculum. The monastic schools concentrated upon the [[Bible]], theology, and [[liturgy]]. Therefore, the monastic [[scriptoria]] expended most of their efforts upon the transcription of ecclesiastical manuscripts, while ancient-pagan literature was transcribed, summarized, excerpted, and annotated by laymen or clergy like [[Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople|Photios]], [[Arethas of Caesarea]], [[Eustathius of Thessalonica]], and [[Basilius Bessarion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anastos|first=Milton V.|authorlink=|year=1962|title=The History of Byzantine Science.

In early [[Byzantium]] (5th to 7th century) the architects and mathematicians [[Isidore of Miletus]] and [[Anthemius of Tralles]] used complex mathematical formulas to construct the great [[Hagia Sophia]] church, a technological breakthrough for its time and for centuries afterwards due to its striking geometry, bold design and height. In late Byzantium (9th to 12th century) mathematicians like [[Michael Psellos]] considered mathematics as a way to interpret the world.

[[Middle Eastern Christians]] especially the adherents of the [[Church of the East]] ([[Nestorian]]s), contributed to the Arab Islamic Civilization during the [[Ummayads|Ummayad]] and the [[Abbasids|Abbasid]] periods by translating works of [[Greek philosophers]] to [[Syriac Language|Syriac]] and afterwards to [[Arabic Language|Arabic]].&lt;ref name="Hill, Donald 1993. p.4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Legend of the Middle Ages|author=Brague, Rémi|url=https://books.google.com/?id=c8YjEkLPXNYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:9780226070803#v=onepage&amp;q=House%20of%20Wisdom&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 February 2014|isbn=9780226070803|page=164|date=15 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 4th through the 7th centuries, scholarly work in the Syriac and Greek languages was either newly initiated, or carried on from the Hellenistic period.

{{Main|Catholic Church and science}}
{{See also|List of Catholic scientists|List of Roman Catholic cleric-scientists}}
While refined and clarified over the centuries, the [[Roman Catholic]] position on the relationship between science and religion is one of harmony, and has maintained the teaching of [[natural law]] as set forth by [[Thomas Aquinas]].  For example, regarding scientific study such as that of evolution, the church's unofficial position is an example of [[theistic evolution]], stating that faith and scientific findings regarding human evolution are not in conflict, though humans are regarded as a special creation, and that the existence of God is required to explain both [[monogenism]] and the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] component of human origins. Catholic schools have included all manners of scientific study in their curriculum for many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13554b.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia |publisher=New Advent |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galileo once stated "The intention of the [[Holy Spirit]] is to teach us how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Cambridge Companion to Galileo|last= Machamer|first= Peter|year= 1998|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|location= |isbn= 0-521-58841-3|page= 306}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 [[John Paul II]], then pope of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], spoke of the relationship this way: "The Bible itself speaks to us of the origin of the universe and its make-up, not in order to provide us with a scientific treatise, but in order to state the correct relationships of man with God and with the universe. Sacred Scripture wishes simply to declare that the world was created by God, and in order to teach this truth it expresses itself in the terms of the cosmology in use at the time of the writer".&lt;ref&gt;Pope [[John Paul II]], 3 October 1981 to the Pontifical Academy of Science, [http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/JP2COSM.HTM "Cosmology and Fundamental Physics"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the Church on Western letters and learning has been formidable. The ancient texts of the Bible have deeply influenced Western art, literature and culture. For centuries following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, small monastic communities were practically the only outposts of literacy in Western Europe. In time, the Cathedral schools developed into Europe's earliest universities and the church has established thousands of primary, secondary and tertiary institutions throughout the world in the centuries since. The Church and clergymen have also sought at different times to censor texts and scholars. Thus different schools of opinion exist as to the role and influence of the Church in relation to western letters and learning.

One view, first propounded by [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment philosophers]], asserts that the Church's doctrines are entirely superstitious and have hindered the progress of civilization. [[Communist states]] have made similar arguments in their education in order to inculcate a negative view of Catholicism (and religion in general) in their citizens. The most famous incidents cited by such critics are the Church's condemnations of the teachings of [[Copernicus]], [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Johannes Kepler]].

The Church's priest-scientists, many of whom were [[Jesuit]]s, have been among the leading lights in [[astronomy]], [[genetics]], [[geomagnetism]], [[meteorology]], [[seismology]], and [[solar physics]], becoming some of the "fathers" of these sciences. Examples include important churchmen such as the [[Augustinian]] abbot [[Gregor Mendel]] (pioneer in the study of genetics), [[Roger Bacon]] (a [[Franciscan]] friar who was one of the early advocates of the [[scientific method]]), and Belgian priest [[Georges Lemaître]] (the first to propose the [[Big Bang]] theory). Other notable priest scientists have included [[Albertus Magnus]], [[Robert Grosseteste]], [[Nicholas Steno]], [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi|Francesco Grimaldi]], [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli|Giambattista Riccioli]], [[Roger Boscovich]], and [[Athanasius Kircher]]. Even more numerous are Catholic laity involved in science:[[Henri Becquerel]] who discovered [[radioactivity]]; [[Galvani]], [[Alessandro Volta|Volta]], [[Ampere]], [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]], pioneers in electricity and [[telecommunications]]; [[Lavoisier]], "father of modern [[chemistry]]"; [[Vesalius]], founder of modern [[human anatomy]]; and [[Cauchy]], one of the mathematicians who laid the rigorous foundations of [[calculus]].

Throughout history many of the [[List of Roman Catholic cleric-scientists|Roman Catholic clerics]] have made contributions to science, mostly during periods of Church domination of public life. These cleric-scientists include [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], [[Gregor Mendel]], [[Georges Lemaître]], [[Albertus Magnus]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Pierre Gassendi]], [[Roger Joseph Boscovich]], [[Marin Mersenne]], [[Bernard Bolzano]], [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi]], [[Nicole Oresme]], [[Jean Buridan]], [[Robert Grosseteste]], [[Christopher Clavius]], [[Nicolas Steno]], [[Athanasius Kircher]], [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]], [[William of Ockham]], and others. The Catholic Church has also produced many [[List of Catholic scientists|lay scientists and mathematicians]].

For example, the Jesuits have dedicated significant study to earthquakes, and [[seismology]] has been described as "the Jesuit science".&lt;ref&gt;Susan Elizabeth Hough, ''Richter's Scale: Measure of an Earthquake, Measure of a Man'', Princeton University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-691-12807-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rvmDeAxEiO8C&amp;pg=PA68 p. 68.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Jesuits have been described as "the single most important contributor to experimental physics in the seventeenth century".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=David C.|last1=Lindberg|first2=Ronald Leslie|last2=Numbers|authorlink1=David C.

Protestantism had an important influence on science. According to the [[Merton Thesis]] there was a positive [[correlation]] between the rise of [[Puritanism]] and [[Protestant]] [[Pietism]] on the one hand and early [[experimental science]] on the other.&lt;ref name=sztompka2003&gt;[[Piotr Sztompka|Sztompka, Piotr]] (2003), ''Robert King Merton'', in ''[[George Ritzer|Ritzer, George]], [[The Blackwell Companion to Major Contemporary Social Theorists]], Malden, Massachusetts Oxford: Blackwell, p. 13, {{ISBN|9781405105958}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Merton Thesis has two separate parts: Firstly, it presents a theory that science changes due to an accumulation of observations and improvement in experimental techniques and [[methodology]]; secondly, it puts forward the argument that the popularity of science in 17th-century England and the religious [[demography]] of the [[Royal Society]] (English scientists of that time were predominantly Puritans or other Protestants) can be explained by a [[correlation]] between Protestantism and the scientific values.&lt;ref name=gregory1998&gt;Gregory, Andrew (1998), Handout for course 'The Scientific Revolution' at The Scientific Revolution&lt;/ref&gt; In his theory, [[Robert K. Merton]] focused on English Puritanism and [[Spener|German Pietism]] as having been responsible for the development of the [[scientific revolution]] of the 17th and 18th centuries. Merton explained that the connection between [[religious affiliation]] and interest in science was the result of a significant synergy between the [[ascetic]] Protestant values and those of modern science.&lt;ref name=becker1992&gt;Becker, George (1992), ''The Merton Thesis: Oetinger and German Pietism, a significant negative case,'' [[Sociological Forum]] (Springer) 7 (4), pp. 642–660&lt;/ref&gt; Protestant values encouraged scientific research by allowing science to study God's influence on the world and thus providing a religious justification for scientific research.&lt;ref name=sztompka2003/&gt;

According of ''Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United State'' by [[Harriet Zuckerman]], a review of American Nobel prizes winners awarded between 1901 and 1972, 72% of American [[Nobel Prizes|Nobel Prize]] Laureates, have identified from [[Protestant]] background.&lt;ref name="Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United Statesh"&gt;[[Harriet Zuckerman]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=HAHCzJfmD5IC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Scientific+Elite:+Nobel+Laureates+in+the+United+States&amp;hl=iw&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAGoVChMIxKistOqUxwIVzNUUCh0pGgC-#v=onepage&amp;q=Scientific%20Elite%3A%20Nobel%20Laureates%20in%20the%20United%20States&amp;f=false Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United States]'' New York, The Free Pres, 1977, p.68: Protestants turn up among the American-reared laureates in slightly greater proportion to their numbers in the general population.

The university is generally regarded as an institution that has its origin in the [[History of Christianity|Medieval Christian]] setting.&lt;ref name="Rüegg, Walter 1992, pp. XIX"/&gt;&lt;ref name="verger1999"/&gt; Prior to the establishment of universities, European higher education took place for hundreds of years in Christian [[cathedral school]]s or [[monastic school]]s (''Scholae monasticae''), in which [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s taught classes; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the later university at many places dates back to the 6th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref&gt;Riché, Pierre (1978): "Education and Culture in the Barbarian West: From the Sixth through the Eighth Century", Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, {{ISBN|0-87249-376-8}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;126–7, 282–98&lt;/ref&gt;

Missionary activity for the Catholic Church has always incorporated education of evangelized peoples as part of its social ministry. History shows that in evangelized lands, the first people to operate schools were Roman Catholics. In some countries, the Church is the main provider of education or significantly supplements government forms of education. Presently, the Church operates the world's largest non-governmental school system.&lt;ref name="Gardner148"&gt;Gardner, p.&amp;nbsp;148&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Western Civilization's most influential universities were founded by the Catholic Church.
[[File:Xaviers college.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|The Catholic [[St. Xavier's College, Mumbai|St. Xavier's College in Mumbai]], is one of the most prestigious liberal arts colleges in India]]
The Catholic Church founded the West's first universities, which were preceded by the schools attached to monasteries and cathedrals, and generally staffed by monks and friars.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Penguin Viking; 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Universities began springing up in Italian towns like [[Salerno University|Salerno]], which became a leading medical school, translating the work of Greek and Arabic physicians into Latin. [[Bologna University]] became the most influential of the early universities, which first specialised in [[canon law]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]]. [[Paris University]], specialising in such topics as theology, came to rival Bologna under the supervision of [[Notre Dame Cathedral]]. [[Oxford University]] in England later came rival Paris in Theology and [[Salamanca University]] was founded in Spain in 1243. According to the historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]], the universities benefitted from the use of Latin, the common language of the Church, and its internationalist reach, and their role was to "teach, argue and reason within a Christian framework".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The medieval universities of Western Christendom were well-integrated across all of Western Europe, encouraged freedom of enquiry and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers, including [[Robert Grosseteste]] of the [[University of Oxford]], an early expositor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07037a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Robert Grosseteste |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 June 1910 |accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Saint [[Albertus Magnus|Albert the Great]], a pioneer of biological field research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01264a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: St. Albertus Magnus |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 March 1907 |accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Reformers wanted all members of the church to be able to read the Bible, education on all levels got a strong boost. Compulsory education for both boys and girls was introduced. For example, the [[Puritans]] who established [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in 1628 founded [[Harvard College]] only eight years later. About a dozen other colleges followed in the 18th century, including [[Yale University]] (1701). [[Pennsylvania]] also became a centre of learning.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton E. Olmstead (1960), ''History of Religion in the United States'', Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J., pp. 69–80, 88–89, 114–117, 186–188&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Schmidt, ''Kongregationalismus'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3. Auflage, Band III (1959), Tübingen (Germany), col. 1770&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Princeton University]] was a [[Presbyterian church|Presbyterian]] foundation. Protestantism also initiated translations of the Bible into national languages and hereby supported the development of national literatures.

A large number of [[mainline Protestant]]s have played leadership roles in many aspects of American life, including politics, business, science, the arts, and education. They founded most of the country's leading institutes of higher education.&lt;ref name=mainline2000&gt;McKinney, William. "Mainline Protestantism 2000." ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'', Vol. 558, Americans and Religions in the Twenty-First Century (July 1998), pp. 57–66.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ivy League]] universities have strong [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]] historical ties, and their influence continues today. Until about World War II, Ivy League universities were composed largely of WASP students.

According to [[Pew Center]] study there is correlation between education and income, about (59%) of American [[Anglican]] have a [[Academic degree|graduate]] and post-graduate degree, and about (56%) of [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]] and (47%) of [[Presbyterian Church (USA)|Presbyterians]] and (46%) [[United Church of Christ]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/04/the-most-and-least-educated-u-s-religious-groups/|title=The most and least educated U.S. religious group|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; have a [[Academic degree|graduate]] and post-graduate degree.

A [[Pew Center]] study about [[Religiosity and education|religion and education]] around the world in 2016, found that Christians ranked as the second most educated religious group around in the world after [[Jews]] with an average of 9.3 years of schooling,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"&gt;{{cite web |date=19 December 2011 |title=Religion and Education Around the World |url=http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2016/12/21094148/Religion-Education-ONLINE-FINAL.pdf |publisher=Pew Research Center |accessdate=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the highest of years of schooling among Christians found in Germany (13.6),&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; New Zealand (13.5)&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; and Estonia (13.1).&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; Christians were also found to have the second highest number of [[Academic degree|graduate]] and post-graduate degrees per capita while in absolute numbers ranked in the first place (220&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; Between the various [[World Christianity|Christian communities]], Singapore outranks other nations in terms of Christians who obtain a university degree in institutions of higher education (67%),&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; followed by the [[Christianity in Israel|Christians of Israel]] (63%),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bokra.net/Article-1155836 |title=  المسيحيون العرب يتفوقون على يهود إسرائيل في التعليم |website=Bokra |accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Christianity in Georgia (country)|Christians of Georgia]] (57%).&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;
According to the study, Christians in North America, Europe, Middle East, North Africa and Asia-Pacific regions are highly educated since many of the world universities were built by the historic [[Christian denominations|Christian Churches]],&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; in addition to the historical evidence that "Christian monks built libraries and, in the days before printing presses, preserved important earlier writings produced in Latin, Greek and Arabic".&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; According to the same study, Christians have a significant amount of [[gender equality]] in educational attainment,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; and the study suggests that one of the reasons is the encouragement of the [[Protestant Reformers]] in promoting the [[education of women]], which led to the eradication of illiteracy among females in Protestant communities.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;
According to the same study "there is a large and pervasive gap in educational attainment between Muslims and Christians in sub-Saharan Africa" as [[Muslim]] adults in this region are far less educated than their Christian counterparts,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; with scholars suggesting that this gap is due to the educational facilities that were created by [[Christian missionaries]] during the colonial era for fellow believers.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;

== Medicine and health care ==
[[File:SantaMariaDellaScalaSienaBack.JPG|thumb|upright|Panorama of Siena's [[Santa Maria della Scala (Siena)|Santa Maria della Scala Hospital]], one of Europe's oldest hospitals]]
The administration of the Eastern and Western Roman Empires split and the [[Fall of Rome|demise of the Western Empire]] by the sixth century was accompanied by a series of violent invasions and precipitated the collapse of cities and civic institutions of learning, along with their links to the learning of classical Greece and Rome. For the next thousand years, medical knowledge would change very little.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter; The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present; Harper Collins; 1997; pp82-83&lt;/ref&gt; A scholarly medical tradition maintained itself in the more stable East, but in the West, scholarship virtually disappeared outside of the Church, where monks were aware of a dwindling range of medical texts.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter; The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present; Harper Collins; 1997; p.90.&lt;/ref&gt; Hospitality was considered an obligation of Christian charity and bishops' houses and the valetudinaria of wealthier Christians were used to tend the sick. And the legacy of this early period was, in the words of Porter, that "Christianity planted the hospital: the well-endowed establishments of the Levant and the scattered houses of the West shared a common religious ethos of charity." 

The [[Byzantine Empire]] was one of the first empires to have flourishing medical establishments. Prior to the Byzantine Empire the Roman Empire had [[hospitals]] specifically for soldiers and slaves. However, none of these establishments were for the public. The hospitals in Byzantium were originally started by the church to act as a place for the poor to have access to basic amenities. Hospitals were usually separated between men and women. Although the remains of these hospitals have not been discovered by archaeologists, recordings of hospitals from the Byzantine Empire describe large buildings that had the core feature of an open hearth.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Birth of the Hospital in the Byzantine Empire|last=Miller|first=Timothy|publisher=Johns Hopkins|year=1985|isbn=|location=Baltimore, Maryland|pages=142–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The establishments of the Byzantine Empire resembled the beginning of what we now know as modern hospitals. The first hospital was erected by Leontius of Antioch between the years 344 to 358 and was a place for strangers and migrants to find refuge. Around the same time, a deacon named Marathonius was in charge of hospitals and monasteries in Constantinople. His main objective was to improve urban aesthetics, illustrating hospitals as a main part of Byzantine cities. These early hospitals were designed for the poor. In fact, most hospitals throughout the Byzantine Empire were almost exclusively utilized by the poor. This may be due to descriptions of hospitals similar to "[[Gregory of Nazianzus|Gregory Nazianzen]] who called the hospital a stairway to heaven, implying that it aimed only to ease death for the chronically or terminally ill rather than promote recovery".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Birth of the Hospital in the Byzantine Empire|last=Miller|first=Timothy|publisher=Johns Hopkins|year=1985|isbn=|location=Baltimore, Maryland|pages=142–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is debate between scholars as to why these institutions were started by the church. Many scholars believe that the church founded hospitals in order to receive additional donations. Whatever the case for these hospitals, they began to diffuse across the empire. Soon after, [[Basil of Caesarea|St. Basil of Caesarea]] developed a place for the sick in which provided refuge for the sick and homeless.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horden|first=Peregrine|date=2005|title=The Earliest Hospitals in Byzantium, Western Europe, and Islam|url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1404975.files/Final%20Exam%20Readings/Horden-Earliest%20Hospitals-2005.pdf|journal=MIT Press|doi=|pmid=|access-date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geoffrey Blainey likened the Catholic Church in its activities during the Middle Ages to an early version of a welfare state: "It conducted hospitals for the old and orphanages for the young; hospices for the sick of all ages; places for the lepers; and hostels or inns where pilgrims could buy a cheap bed and meal". It supplied food to the population during famine and distributed food to the poor. This welfare system the church funded through collecting taxes on a large scale and possessing large farmlands and estates.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Penguin Viking; 2011; pp 214-215.&lt;/ref&gt; It was common for monks and clerics to practice medicine and medical students in northern European universities often took minor Holy orders. Mediaeval hospitals had a strongly Christian ethos, and were, in the words of historian of medicine [[Roy Porter]], "religious foundations through and through", and Ecclesiastical regulations were passed to govern medicine, partly to prevent clergymen profiting from medicine.&lt;ref name="Present pp. 110-112"&gt;[[Roy Porter]]; ''The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present''; Harper Collins; 1997; pp. 110-112&lt;/ref&gt;  During Europe's [[Age of Discovery]], Catholic missionaries, notably the Jesuits, introduced the modern sciences to India, China and Japan. While persecutions continue to limit the spread of Catholic institutions to some Middle Eastern Muslim nations, and such places as the People's Republic of China and North Korea, elsewhere in Asia the church is a major provider of health care services - especially in Catholic Nations like the [[Philippines]].

Today he [[Roman Catholic Church]] is the largest non-government provider of [[health care]] services in the world.&lt;ref name=Geopolitics&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agnew|first=John|title=Deus Vult: The Geopolitics of Catholic Church|journal=Geopolitics|date=12 February 2010|volume=15|issue=1|pages=39–61|doi=10.1080/14650040903420388}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has around 18,000 clinics, 16,000 homes for the elderly and those with special needs, and 5,500 hospitals, with 65 percent of them located in developing countries.&lt;ref name="World Development p.40"&gt;[[Robert Calderisi]]; ''Earthly Mission - The Catholic Church and World Development''; TJ International Ltd; 2013; p.40&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Church's [[Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Health Care Workers]] said that the Church manages 26% of the world's health care facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/catholic_hospitals_represent_26_percent_of_worlds_health_facilities_reports_pontifical_council/ |title=Catholic hospitals comprise one quarter of world's healthcare, council reports :: Catholic News Agency (CNA) |publisher=Catholic News Agency |date=10 February 2010 |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church's involvement in health care has ancient origins.

[[Francisco de Vitoria]], a disciple of [[Thomas Aquinas]] and a Catholic thinker who studied the issue regarding the human rights of colonized natives, is recognized by the United Nations as a father of international law, and now also by historians of economics and democracy as a leading light for the West's democracy and rapid economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Philosophical and Historical Analysis of Modern Democracy, Equality, and Freedom Under the Influence of Christianity |url=http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/politics/pg0010.html |last=de Torre |first=Fr. Joseph M. |year=1997 |publisher=Catholic Education Resource Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Schumpeter]], an economist of the twentieth century, referring to the [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]], wrote, "it is they who come nearer than does any other group to having been the 'founders' of scientific economics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=History of Economic Analysis |last=Schumpeter |first=Joseph |year=1954 |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other economists and historians, such as Raymond de Roover, Marjorie Grice-Hutchinson, and Alejandro Chafuen, have also made similar statements. 

The Protestant concept of God and man allows believers to use all their God-given faculties, including the power of reason. That means that they are allowed to explore God's creation and, according to Genesis 2:15, make use of it in a responsible and sustainable way. Thus a cultural climate was created that greatly enhanced the development of the [[humanities]] and the [[sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerhard Lenski]] (1963), ''The Religious Factor: A Sociological Study of Religion's Impact on Politics, Economics, and Family Life'', Revised Edition,  A Doubleday Anchor Book, Garden City, N.Y., pp.348–351&lt;/ref&gt; Another consequence of the Protestant understanding of man is that the believers, in gratitude for their election and redemption in Christ, are to follow God's commandments. Industry, frugality, calling, discipline, and a strong sense of responsibility are at the heart of their moral code.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Robert Middlekauff]] (2005), ''The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763–1789'', Revised and Expanded Edition, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-516247-9}}, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan Weerda, ''Soziallehre des Calvinismus'', in ''Evangelisches Soziallexikon'', 3. Auflage (1958), Stuttgart (Germany), col. 934&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, [[John Calvin]] rejected luxury. Therefore, craftsmen, industrialists, and other businessmen were able to reinvest the greater part of their profits in the most efficient machinery and the most modern production methods that were based on progress in the sciences and technology. As a result, productivity grew, which led to increased profits and enabled employers to pay higher wages. In this way, the economy, the sciences, and technology reinforced each other. The chance to participate in the economic success of technological inventions was a strong incentive to both inventors and investors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eduard Heimann]], ''Kapitalismus'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3.

[[File:Nativity tree2011.jpg|thumb|right|A [[nativity scene|depiction of the Nativity]] with a [[Christmas tree]] backdrop.]]
Roman Catholics, Anglicans, Eastern Christians, and traditional Protestant communities frame worship around the [[liturgical year]]. The liturgical cycle divides the year into a series of seasons, each with their theological emphases, and modes of prayer, which can be signified by different ways of decorating churches, colours of [[parament]]s and [[vestment]]s for clergy,&lt;ref name="calendar"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fortescue|first1=Adrian|title=Christian Calendar|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03158a.htm|website=The Catholic Encyclopedia.|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|accessdate=18 July 2014|year=1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; scriptural readings, themes for preaching and even different traditions and practices often observed personally or in the home.

Western Christian liturgical calendars are based on the cycle of the [[Roman Rite]] of the Catholic Church,&lt;ref name="calendar" /&gt; and Eastern Christians use analogous calendars based on the cycle of their respective [[Rite#Christian|rites]]. Calendars set aside holy days, such as [[Solemnity|solemnities]] which commemorate an event in the life of Jesus or Mary, the [[saint]]s, periods of [[fasting]] such as [[Lent]], and other pious events such as [[memoria]] or lesser festivals commemorating saints. Christian groups that do not follow a liturgical tradition often retain certain celebrations, such as Christmas, Easter and [[Pentecost]]: these are the celebrations of Christ's birth, resurrection and the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Church, respectively. A few denominations make no use of a liturgical calendar.&lt;ref&gt;Hickman. ''Handbook of the Christian Year''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The seven Sacrament.jpg|thumb|The seven sacraments of the Catholic church: [[Baptism]], [[Confirmation (Catholic Church)|Confirmation]], [[Marriage (Catholic Church)|Matrimony]], [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Eucharist]], [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Penance]], [[Holy orders (Catholic Church)|Holy Orders]] and the [[Anointing of the Sick (Catholic Church)|Anointing of the Sick]].]]
Roman Catholic theology enumerates seven sacraments:&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3E.HTM ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 1210] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609042152/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3E.HTM |date=9 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baptism]] ([[infant baptism|Christening]]), [[Confirmation (Catholic Church)|Confirmation]] (Chrismation), [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Eucharist]] (Communion), [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Penance]] (Reconciliation), [[Anointing of the Sick (Catholic Church)|Anointing of the Sick]] (before the [[Second Vatican Council]] generally called Extreme Unction), [[Marriage (Catholic Church)|Matrimony]]

In Christian belief and practice, a ''sacrament'' is a [[rite]], instituted by Christ, that mediates [[divine grace|grace]], constituting a [[Sacred Mysteries|sacred mystery]]. The term is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''sacramentum'', which was used to translate the Greek word for ''mystery''. Views concerning both what rites are sacramental, and what it means for an act to be a sacrament vary among Christian denominations and traditions.&lt;ref name="ODCC1435"&gt;Cross/Livingstone. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. p. 1435f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most conventional functional definition of a sacrament is that it is an outward sign, instituted by Christ, that conveys an inward, spiritual grace through Christ. The two most widely accepted sacraments are [[Baptism]] and the [[Eucharist]] (or Holy Communion), however, the majority of Christians also recognize five additional sacraments: [[Confirmation (Christian sacrament)|Confirmation]] ([[Chrismation]] in the Orthodox tradition), [[Holy orders]] ([[ordination]]), [[Penance]] (or [[Confession (religion)|Confession]]), [[Anointing of the Sick]], and [[Matrimony]] (see [[Christian views on marriage]]).&lt;ref name="ODCC1435" /&gt;

Taken together, these are the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Seven Sacraments]] as recognized by churches in the [[High Church]] tradition—notably [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]], [[Independent Catholic Churches|Independent Catholic]], [[Old Catholic]], many [[Anglican sacraments|Anglicans]], and some [[Lutherans]]. Most other denominations and traditions typically affirm only Baptism and Eucharist as sacraments, while some Protestant groups, such as the Quakers, reject sacramental theology.&lt;ref name="ODCC1435" /&gt; [[Christian denominations]], such as [[Baptists]], which believe these rites do not communicate grace, prefer to call Baptism and Holy Communion ''[[Ordinance (Christian)|ordinances]]'' rather than sacraments.

Today, most [[Christian denominations]] are neutral about [[religious male circumcision]], neither requiring it nor forbidding it. The practice is customary among the [[Coptic Christian|Coptic]], [[Ethiopian Orthodox|Ethiopian]], and [[Eritrean Orthodox]] Churches, and also some other African churches.&lt;ref name=Christian&gt;Customary in some Coptic and other churches:
*"The Coptic Christians in Egypt and the Ethiopian Orthodox Christians— two of the oldest surviving forms of Christianity— retain many of the features of early Christianity, including male circumcision. Circumcision is not prescribed in other forms of Christianity... Some Christian churches in South Africa oppose the practice, viewing it as a pagan ritual, while others, including the Nomiya church in Kenya, require circumcision for membership and participants in focus group discussions in Zambia and Malawi mentioned similar beliefs that Christians should practice circumcision since Jesus was circumcised and the Bible teaches the practice."
*"The decision that Christians need not practice circumcision is recorded in {{Bibleverse|Acts|15}}; there was never, however, a prohibition of circumcision, and it is practiced by Coptic Christians." [https://web.archive.org/web/20080720054046/http://bartleby.com/65/ci/circumci.html "circumcision"], The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, 2001–05.&lt;/ref&gt;

Worship can be varied for special events like [[baptism]]s or weddings in the service or significant [[Calendar of saints|feast days]]. In the [[Early Christianity|early church]], Christians and those yet to complete initiation would separate for the Eucharistic part of the worship. In many churches today, adults and children will separate for all or some of the service to receive age-appropriate teaching. Such children's worship is often called [[Sunday school]] or [[Sabbath school]] (Sunday schools are often held before rather than during services).

The same sequence of events happens three times.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the [[New Testament]] does give a few guidelines about the consumption of meat, practiced by the [[Christian Church]] today; one of these is not consuming food knowingly offered to pagan [[Idolatry|idols]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=December 2002 |title=The Weaker Brother |journal=Third Way Magazine |volume=25 |issue=10 |page=25 |quote=Christ came for the Gentiles as well as the Jews (the real meaning of that vision in Acts 10:9;16) but he also calls us to look out for each other and not do things that will cause our brothers and sisters to stumble.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28668">'''Civil religion''', also referred to as a '''civic religion''',&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt; is the implicit religious values of a nation, as expressed through public [[ritual]]s, symbols (such as the national flag), and ceremonies on sacred days and at sacred places (such as monuments, battlefields, or national cemeteries). It is distinct from churches, although church officials and ceremonies are sometimes incorporated into the practice of civil religion.{{sfn|Wimberley|Swatos|1998}} Countries described as having a civil religion include France,&lt;ref name=BaylacFrance/&gt; South Korea,&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt; and the former Soviet Union.{{sfn|Tumarkin|1983}} As a concept, it originated in French [[political thought]] and became a major topic for U.S. [[sociologist]]s since its use by [[Robert Bellah]] in 1960.

==Origin of term==
[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] coined the term in chapter 8, book 4 of ''[[The Social Contract]]'' (1762), to describe what he regarded as the moral and spiritual foundation essential for any modern society. For Rousseau, civil religion was intended simply as a form of social cement, helping to unify the [[State (polity)|state]] by providing it with sacred authority. In his book, [[Rousseau]] outlines the simple [[dogma]]s of the civil religion:
# [[deity]]
# [[afterlife]]
# the reward of [[virtue]] and the punishment of [[vice]]
# the exclusion of [[religious intolerance]]{{sfnm |1a1=Bellah |1y=1967 |2a1=Juergensmeyer |2y=2003 |2p=245 |3a1=Meyer-Dinkgrafe |3y=2004 |3p=30 |4a1=Shanks |4y=2000 |4p=29}}
The Italian historian [[Emilio Gentile]] has studied the roots and development of the concept and proposed a division of two types of religions of politics: a civil religion and a [[political religion]].{{sfn|Gentile|2006}}

==Sociology of religion==
[[File:National Cathedral.jpg|thumb|The [[Washington National Cathedral]] in [[Washington, DC]], is often used for state [[funeral]]s for political leaders.]]
In the [[sociology of religion]], '''civil religion''' is the [[folk religion]] of a [[nation]] or a [[politics|political]] [[culture]].{{dubious|date=October 2012}}{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Civil religion stands somewhat above folk religion in its social and political status, since by definition it suffuses an entire society, or at least a segment of a society; and is often practiced by [[leadership|leader]]s within that society.  On the other hand, it is somewhat less than an [[establishment of religion]], since established churches have official [[clergy]] and a relatively fixed and formal relationship with the government that establishes them. Civil religion is usually practiced by political leaders who are laypeople and whose leadership is not specifically spiritual.

===Examples===

Such civil religion encompasses such things as:{{sfn|Bellah|1992}}
*the invocation of God in political speeches and public monuments;
*the quotation of [[religious text]]s on public occasions by political leaders;
*the veneration of past political leaders;
*the use of the lives of these leaders to teach moral ideals;
*the veneration of veterans and casualties of a nation's wars;
*religious gatherings called by political leaders;
*the use of religious symbols on public buildings;
*the use of public buildings for worship;
*[[founding myth]]s and other [[national myth]]s
and similar religious or quasi-religious practices.

==Practical political philosophy==
[[File:Arc De Triomphe 2004.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Arc de Triomphe]]'' in [[Paris]] commemorates those who died in France's wars.]]

Professional commentators on political and social matters writing in newspapers and magazines sometimes use the term '''''civil religion''''' or '''''civic religion''''' to refer to [[ritual]] expressions of [[patriotism]] of a sort practiced in all countries, not always including religion in the conventional sense of the word.

Among such practices are the following:{{sfn|Bellah|1992}}
*crowds singing the national anthem at certain public gatherings;
*parades or display of the national flag on certain [[National Day|patriotic holidays]];
*reciting [[oath of allegiance|oaths of allegiance]] (like the pledges of allegiance found in countries such as the [[Pledge of Allegiance (Bahamas)|Bahamas]], [[Pledge of Allegiance to the Philippine Flag|the Philippines]], and [[Pledge of Allegiance (South Korea)|South Korea]]);
*ceremonies concomitant to the inauguration of a president or the coronation of a monarch;
*retelling exaggerated, one-sided, and simplified [[mythology|mythologized]] tales of [[List of national founders|national founders]] and other great leaders or great events (e.g., battles, mass migrations) in the past (in this connection, see also [[romantic nationalism]]);
*[[monument]]s commemorating great leaders of the past or historic events;
*monuments to dead soldiers or annual ceremonies to remember them;
*expressions of [[reverence (attitude)|reverence]] for the state, the predominant national racial/ethnic group,&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt; the national constitution, or the monarch;
*expressions of solidarity with people perceived as being national kindred but residing in a foreign country or a foreign country perceived as being similar enough to the nation to warrant admiration and/or loyalty;&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt;
*expressions of hatred towards another country or foreign ethnic group perceived as either currently being an enemy of the state and/or as having wronged and slighted the nation in the past;&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt;
*public display of the coffin of a recently deceased political leader.

==Relation between the two conceptions==

These two conceptions (sociological and political) of '''civil religion''' substantially overlap. In Britain, where church and state are constitutionally joined, the monarch's coronation is an elaborate religious rite celebrated by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. In France, secular ceremonies are separated from religious observances to a greater degree than in most countries. In the United States, a president being inaugurated is told by the Constitution to choose between saying [[oath of office|"I do solemnly swear..."]] (customarily followed by "so help me God", although those words are not Constitutionally required) and saying "I do solemnly affirm..." (in which latter case no mention of God would be expected).

==History==

===Prehistory and classical antiquity===
{{Disputed section|date=September 2011}}
[[File:Bas relief from Arch of Marcus Aurelius showing sacrifice.jpg|thumb|The emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]], his [[capite velato|head ritually covered]], conducts a public sacrifice at the Temple of Jupiter]]
Practically all the ancient and prehistoric reigns suffused politics with religion. Often the leaders, such as the [[Pharaoh]] or the [[Chinese Emperor]] were considered manifestations of a [[Divinity]]. Tribal world-view was often [[Pantheism|Pantheistic]], the tribe being an extension of its surrounding nature and the leaders having roles and symbols derived from the animal hierarchy and significant natural phenomena (such as storm).

The religion of the Athenian [[polis]] was a secular [[polytheism]] focused on the [[Olympian Gods]] and was celebrated in the civic festivals. Religion was a matter of state and the Athenian [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Ecclesia]] deliberated on matters of religion. Atheism and the introduction of foreign gods were forbidden in Athens and punishable by death. For example, the Athenian ecclesia charged that [[Socrates]] worshiped gods other than those sanctioned by the polis and condemned him to death.

Rome also had a civil religion, whose first Emperor [[Augustus]] officially attempted to revive the dutiful practice of classical [[paganism]]. [[Religion in Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]] were essentially local in character; the [[Roman Empire]] attempted to unite its disparate territories by inculcating an ideal of Roman piety, and by a [[syncretism|syncretistic]] identifying of the gods of conquered territories with the Greek and Roman [[Greek mythology|pantheon]].  In this campaign, Augustus erected monuments such as the ''[[Ara Pacis]]'', the Altar of Peace, showing the [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] and his family worshiping the gods.  He also encouraged the publication of works such as [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid|Æneid]]'', which depicted "pious [[Aeneas|Æneas]]", the [[legend]]ary ancestor of [[Rome]], as a role model for Roman religiosity. Roman historians such as [[Livy]] told tales of early Romans as morally improving stories of military prowess and civic virtue. The Roman civil religion later became centered on the person of the Emperor through the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]], the worship of the ''[[genius (mythology)|genius]]'' of the Emperor.{{sfn|O'Donovan|1996}}

===Rousseau and Durkheim===
The phrase ''civil religion'' was first discussed extensively by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in his 1762 treatise ''The Social Contract''. Rousseau defined ''civil religion'' as a group of religious beliefs he believed to be universal, and which he believed governments had a right to uphold and maintain: belief in a deity; belief in an afterlife in which [[virtue]] is rewarded and vice punished; and belief in [[freedom of religion|religious tolerance]].  He said the dogmas of civil religion should be simple, few in number, and stated in precise words without interpretations or commentaries.{{sfn|Beiner|1993}} Beyond that, Rousseau affirmed that individuals' religious opinions should be beyond the reach of governments.  For Rousseau civil religion was to be constructed and imposed from the top down as an artificial source of civic virtue.{{sfn|Demerath|Williams|1985}}

Wallace studies [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917), the French sociologist who analysed civil religion, especially in comparative terms, and stressed that the public schools are critical in implementing civil religion. Although he never used the term he laid great stress on the concept.{{sfn|Wallace|1977}}

==Examples==
===France===
Secular states in Europe by the late 19th century were building civil religion based on their recent histories. In France's case, Baylac argues, the French government:
{{quote|encouraged a veritable state religion, worshiping the flag and multiplying the national holidays and commemorative monuments.&amp;nbsp;... July 14 became a national holiday in 1882; the centennial of the French Revolution was celebrated in 1889. In Italy, the secular state multiplied the celebrations: State holidays, King and Queen's birthdays, pilgrimage of 1884 to the tomb of Victor-Emmanuel II. A patriotic ideology was created.&lt;ref name=BaylacFrance&gt;{{cite book |last=Baylac |first=M.-H. |year=1997 |title=Histoire 1ère |language=fr |location=Paris |publisher=Bordas |page=134}} Quoted in {{harvnb|Lindaman|Ward|2013|p=148}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===South Korea===
In contemporary South Korea, the predominating civil religion has been described as consisting of [[Anti-Japanese sentiment in Korea|anti-Japanese sentiment]] coupled with a pan-[[Korean racial nationalism]].&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt; This has been criticized by some scholars as being detrimental to South Korean national security as it encourages North Korean provocations against the country in the guise that South Koreans will not adequately defend their country's security as they feel a certain racial and ethnic solidarity with North Korea.&lt;ref name=BRMyers&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/war_college/what-north-korea-wants|title=What North Korea Wants|date=2017|first=Brian Reynolds|authorlink=Brian Reynolds Myers|last=Myers|publisher=Soundcloud|work=Reuters War College|quote=The South needs to retire the conventional civic religion here, which is anti-Japanese pan-Korean nationalism in favor of a collective identification of civic principles.|access-date=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar argued that South Korea should retire this sort of racialized civil religion for one more rooted in civic principles, like was found in [[West Germany]] during the 20th century.&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt;

===Soviet Union===
[[File:Dubna Lenin.JPG|thumb|Statue of Lenin at [[Dubna]], Russia, built in 1937; it is 25 metres tall]]
The Soviet Union made [[Marxism–Leninism]] into a civil religion, with sacred texts and [[List of statues of Vladimir Lenin|many statues of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin.]]{{sfn|Tumarkin|1983}} Stalin personally supervised the cult of Lenin and his own cult, which took advantage of the historic semi-religious adulation Russian peasants had shown toward the tsars.{{sfn|Plamper|2012}} The Lenin icons were put into storage when [[fall of communism|communism fell in 1991]]. The [[List of statues of Stalin|Stalin statues]] had been [[de-Stalinization|removed]] in the 1950s and mention of him was erased from encyclopedias and history books. However under [[Vladimir Putin]] in the 21st century the memory of Stalin has been partly rehabilitated in search of a strong leader who made the nation powerful.  For example, school textbooks were rewritten to portray "the mass terror of the Stalin years as essential to the country's rapid modernization in the face of growing German and Japanese military threats, and amid the inaction or duplicity of the Western democracies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Sherlock |first=Thomas |year=2011 |title=Confronting the Stalinist Past: The Politics of Memory in Russia |url=https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/legacy_files/files/publication/twq11springsherlock.pdf |magazine=The Washington Quarterly |volume=34 |issue=2 |page=97 |issn=1530-9177 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180225034518/https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/legacy_files/files/publication/twq11springsherlock.pdf |archive-date=25 February 2018 |access-date=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main|American civil religion}}
Civil religion is an important component of public life in America, especially at the national level for its celebration of [[nationalism]]. Sociologists report that its "feast days" are [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]], [[Veterans Day]], and [[Memorial Day]]. Its rituals include salutes to the flag and singing "[[God Bless America]]".{{sfn|Bruce|Yearley|2006|p=34}} Soldiers and veterans play a central role of standing ready to sacrifice their lives to preserve the nation. Bellah noted the veneration of veterans.{{sfn|Bellah|1992}} The historian Conrad Cherry called the Memorial Day ceremonies "a modern cult of the dead" and says that it "affirms the civil religious tenets."{{sfn|Wilsey|2015|p=24}}

====American Revolution====
{{Further|Commemoration of the American Revolution}}
The American Revolution was the main source of the civil religion that has shaped patriotism ever since. According to the sociologist Robert Bellah:
{{quote|Behind the civil religion at every point lie biblical archetypes: Exodus, Chosen People, Promised Land, New Jerusalem, and Sacrificial Death and Rebirth. But it is also genuinely American and genuinely new. It has its own prophets and its own martyrs, its own sacred events and sacred places, its own solemn rituals and symbols. It is concerned that America be a society as perfectly in accord with the will of God as men can make it, and a light to all nations.{{sfn|Bellah|1967}}}}

Albanese argues that the American Revolution was the main source of the non-denominational [[American civil religion]] that has shaped patriotism and the memory and meaning of the nation's birth ever since. Battles are not central (as they are for the Civil War) but rather certain events and people have been celebrated as icons of certain virtues (or vices). As historians have noted, the Revolution produced a Moses-like leader ([[George Washington]]), prophets ([[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Tom Paine]]) and martyrs ([[Boston Massacre]], [[Nathan Hale]]), as well as devils ([[Benedict Arnold]]), sacred places ([[Valley Forge]], [[Battle of Bunker Hill|Bunker Hill]]), rituals ([[Boston Tea Party]]), emblems ([[American flag|the new flag]]), sacred holidays ([[July 4]]) and a holy scripture whose every sentence is carefully studied and applied in current law cases (the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], and the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]).{{sfn|Albanese|1977}}

Although "God" is not mentioned in the [[Constitution of the United States of America]], mention is specifically made of "[[Deism#Deism in the United States|Nature's God]]" in the opening sentence of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].{{sfn|O'Donovan|1996}}

====Historiography====
[[File:Christian Flag etc Covenant Presbyterian Long Beach 20050213.jpg|thumb|The [[Christian flag]] displayed alongside the flag of the United States next to the pulpit in a church in California.  Note the eagle and cross finials on the flag poles.]]
In the 1960s and 1970s, scholars such as [[Robert N. Bellah]] and [[Martin E. Marty]] studied civil religion as a cultural phenomenon, attempting to identify the actual tenets of civil religion in the United States, or to study civil religion as a phenomenon of [[cultural anthropology]].  Within this American context, Marty wrote that Americans approved of "religion in general" without being particularly concerned about the content of that faith, and attempted to distinguish "priestly" and "prophetic" roles within the practice of American civil religion, which he preferred to call the ''public theology''.{{sfn|Marty|1989|p=295}} In the 1967 essay "Civil Religion in America", Bellah wrote that civil religion in its priestly sense is "an institutionalized collection of sacred beliefs about the American nation."  Bellah describes the prophetic role of civil religion as challenging "national self-worship" and calling for "the subordination of the nation to ethical principles that transcend it in terms of which it should be judged."{{sfn|Bellah|1967}} Bellah identified the [[American Revolution]], the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], and the [[Civil Rights Movement]] as three decisive historical events that impacted the content and imagery of civil religion in the United States.

The application of the concept of civil religion to the United States was in large part the work of sociologist [[Robert Bellah]]. He identified an elaborate system of practices and beliefs arising from America's unique historic experience and religiosity. Civil religion in the US was originally Protestant but brought in Catholics and Jews after World War II. Having no association with any religious sect, Civil religion was used in the 1960s to justify civil rights legislation. Americans ever since the colonial era talk of their obligation both collective and individual to carry out God's will on earth. [[George Washington]] was a sort of high priest, and the documents of the [[Founding Fathers]] have been treated as almost sacred texts. With the Civil War, says Bellah, came a new theme of death, sacrifice and rebirth, as expressed through [[Memorial Day]] rituals. Unlike France, the American civil religion was never anticlerical or militantly secular.{{sfn|Bellah|1967}}

==Current issues==
This assertive civil religion of the United States is an occasional cause of political friction between the US and Europe, where the literally religious form of civil religion has largely faded away in recent decades. In the United States, civil religion is often invoked under the name of "[[Judeo-Christian ethics]]", a phrase originally intended to be maximally inclusive of the several religions practiced in the United States, assuming that these faiths all share the same values. Alvin J. Schmidt argues that since the 1700s, expressions of civil religion in the United States have shifted from a deistic to a polytheistic stance.{{sfn|Schmidt|2004}}

Some scholars have argued that the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] can be seen as a main [[totem]] of a national cult,&lt;ref&gt;Marvin and Ingle (1996). [http://www.asc.upenn.edu/USR/fcm/jaar.htm "Blood Sacrifice and the Nation: Revisiting Civil Religion"].&lt;/ref&gt; while others have argued that modern punishment is a form of civil religion.{{sfn|SpearIt|2013}} Arguing against mob violence and lynching, Abraham Lincoln declared in his 1838 Lyceum speech that the Constitution and the laws of the United States ought to become the "political religion" of each American.&lt;ref&gt;Address Before the Young Men's Lyceum of Springfield, Illinois January 27, 1838 [http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/lyceum.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12985">The '''Edict of Toleration''' took place during the process referred to as the [[Eastern Question]] in relations between European powers, Britain in particular, and the [[Ottoman Empire]] in its development at a time referred to as [[Tanzimat]] internally which included other initiatives like ending the [[Slavery in the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman slave trade]] a few years later but overall as part of the [[Dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]] – a process that continued into the 1920s. It was largely a result of pressure from the British government on the [[Sublime Porte]], [[Abdülmecid I]] of the Ottomans, urging to stop the persecutions of the Christians, and eventually had an effect on the persecutions of Jews,{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} continuing effects such as the earlier [[Damascus affair]]. It is one of the [[Edict of toleration|edicts of toleration]] of history.

Tanzimat was an Ottoman reform process that sought equal protections under the law in Ottoman lands for all people; however, it did not address matters of religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference| first =Selim | last = Deringil | editor-last =Michael| editor-first =Michalis N. | editor2-last =Anastassiades | editor2-first =Tassos | editor-last3 = Verdeil| editor-first3 =Chantal | title =Re-configuring Ottoman citizenship in the Tanzimat state: conversion, religion and identity politics in the late Ottoman Empire(abstract | booktitle =Religious community and modern statehood: The passage from the Ottoman Empire to modern state | page =  5 | publisher = University of Cyprus, Department of Turkish and Middle Eastern Studies | date =October 2010 | location = Nicosia, Cyrpus | url =http://www.ucy.ac.cy/tms/documents/tms/sinedria/Conf.29.10.10_Programme.pdf | accessdate = December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A particular incident in 1843 with an Armenian Ottoman subject sparked an incident in August which gained international entanglements and then a Greek national in November, both of whom were put to death - the process of which became the Edict in March 1844.&lt;ref name="Subsi"&gt;{{cite journal| last =Subsi | first = Turgut | title =The apostasy question in the context of Anglo-Ottoman relations, 1843-44. | journal =Middle Eastern Studies | volume = | issue = | pages = | publisher = Frank Cass &amp; Company Ltd.  | date =April 1, 2002 | url =http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-112247877.html | accessdate = December 11, 2013}}{{Subscription required|via=HighBeam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reverend [[Edward Bickersteth (priest)|Edward Bickersteth]] referred to these developments in 1844 when he summarized diplomatic notes&lt;ref name="Bickersteth"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Bickersteth|authorlink=Edward Bickersteth (priest)|title=A practical guide to the Prophecies, with reference to their interpretation and fulfilment, and to personal edification|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4wFOAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA223|year=1844|publisher=Seeley, Burnside, and Seeley|pages=221–23, 387–394}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The original notes of the diplomatic letter noting this edict can be obtained from the Public Record Office in London. A translation of the edict, an acknowledgment from [[Stratford Canning, 1st Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe]] to the Sublime Porte, and an accompanying letter from Canning, dated 23 March 1844, is in Foreign Office, Turkey, FO78/555/No.49. There are several other letters from Canning in the same volume on the question of the religious intolerance of the Turks. The draft of a letter from the Foreign Office, dated 16 January 1844, which made plain the attitude of the British government and which provided the direct impetus for the negotiations leading eventually to the issue of the edict, is in FO78/552/No. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; presented to the British Parliament noting "The correspondence occupied a considerable part of the year—from Aug. 27, 1843, to April 19, 1844."&lt;ref name="Sours"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Michael | last = Sours | title = The 1844 Ottoman 'Edict of Toleration' in Baha'i Secondary Literature |volume = 8 | issue = 3 | year = 1998 | journal = Journal of Baha'i Studies | pages = 53–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Edict==
In February 1844 there is a question on the status of Jew apostates from Islam (who, it was claimed, must pass through being Christian on the way to Islam in the first place)&lt;ref name="quote"&gt;{{cite book|author=August Jochmus (freiherr von Cotignola.)|title=The Syrian war and the decline of the Ottoman Empire, 1840-1848: in reports, documents, and correspondences, etc|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dXfDamiuHEkC&amp;pg=RA1-PA106|year=1883|publisher=A. Cohn|pages=102, 106}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 21, 1844 appears (in translation):

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the special and constant intention of His Highness the Sultan that his cordial relations with the High Powers be preserved, and that a perfect reciprocal friendship be maintained and increased.&lt;br&gt;
 The Sublime Porte engage to take effectual measures to prevent henceforward the execution and putting to death of the Christian who is an apostate.&lt;ref name="quote"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Muslim Islamic scholar [[Cyril Glassé]], death for [[Apostasy in Islam]] was "not in practice enforced" in later times in the Muslim world, and was "completely abolished" by "a decree of the Ottoman government in 1260AH/1844AD."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Cyril |last=Glassé |year=2001 |title=The New Encyclopedia of Islam |publisher=AltaMira |page=54|location=[[Walnut Creek, California]] |isbn=978-0-7591-0189-0|oclc=48553252}}&lt;/ref&gt; This short edict was advanced in the wider [[Ottoman Reform Edict of 1856]].

==Prophetic interpretations==
The Edict was seen by some especially among the religious as a specific sign leading towards the fulfillment of prophecy.

Research conducted by Michael Sours&lt;ref name="Sours"/&gt; into this subject and the records of the development of the Edict did not refer directly to the Jews but rather infers religious tolerance through ending executions for apostasy for Jews that seemed to convert making their social situation easier while actually keeping their personal and group identity in their Judaic religion. Jerusalem has had the largest Jewish population in Palestine in recent centuries since about 1844&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Lapidoth | first = Ruth |author2=Moshe Hirsch | title = The Jerusalem question and its resolution: selected documents|publisher = Martinus Nijhoff Publishers| year = 1994| pages = 258, 384 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=e93JIwTBjHgC&amp;lpg=PA384&amp;pg=PA384#v=onepage&amp;q | isbn = 978-0-7923-2893-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and been majority Jewish since about 1852.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Morgenstern | first = Arie |others=Joel A.

The Edict was first publicly commented upon by Reverend [[Edward Bickersteth (priest)|Edward Bickersteth]] in his publication, ''Practical Guide to the Prophecies'' in the 1844 edition.&lt;ref name="Bickersteth"/&gt; Adventist [[William Miller (preacher)|William Miller]], and those that disagreed with him, though unaware of the Edict and the diplomacy around it, still looked to the fortunes of the Ottoman Empire even in the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper| last = Nichol | first =Francis D. | authorlink =Francis D.

The 2300 days are understood to represent 2300 years stretching from 457 BC, the calculated starting date of the [[70 weeks prophecy#Seventh-day Adventists|70 weeks prophecy]] based on the 3rd decree found in Ezra, thus leading to 1843/4. Bickersteth acknowledged the same interpretation and added a second - {{bible verse||Ezekiel|4:5|KJV}} - as a parallel to start the clock for understanding {{bible verse||Revelation|9:15|KJV}}; taking 390 years as a period for persecution of Christians in the [[End time]]. Bickersteth takes this persecution from the [[Fall of Constantinople|triumph of Ottoman]] rule of Constantinople in 1453, thus 1453+390 is 1843/4, directly before these events. Thus, independently of Miller, a number of Christian authors followed the significance of this declaration from Bickersteth including [[Alfred Edersheim]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfred Edersheim|authorlink = Alfred Edersheim |title=Israel's watchman (and prophetic expositor) &amp;#91;afterw.&amp;#93; The prophetic news and Israel's watchman, ed. by A.

[[Thornton Chase]], commonly recognized as the first convert to the [[Bahá'í Faith]] of Occidental background, noted the Edict in his publication ''The Bahai Revelation'' published in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Chase | first = Thornton | authorlink =Thornton Chase | title =The Bahai Revelation | publisher =Bahai Publishing Society, Chicago Ill. | year = 1909 | page = 32 | url =http://bahai-library.com/pdf/c/chase_bahai_revelation.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Irish convert to the religion, [[George Townshend (Bahá'í)|George Townshend]] was the first broadly published to mention the Edict in Bahá'í literature in 1944&lt;ref name="Sours"/&gt; when he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The proclamation of His Faith was made in 1844, the year when the strict exclusion of the Jews from their own land enforced by the Muslims for some twelve centuries was at last relaxed by the Edict of Toleration and "the times of the Gentiles" were "fulfilled."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10458">An '''edict of toleration''' is a declaration, made by a government or ruler and states, that members of a given [[religion]] will not be persecuted for engaging in their religious practices and traditions. The edict implies tacit acceptance of the religion rather than its endorsement by the ruling power.

== Edicts of toleration in history ==

===Ancient times===
*539 B.C. – The [[Cyrus Cylinder]], a clay document issued by Achaemenid [[Persia]]n monarch [[Cyrus the Great]] declaring the restoration of the cult of [[Marduk]] in [[Babylon]] and the restorations of the temples of many peoples, including the [[Jews]].
*311 A.D. – The [[Edict of Toleration by Galerius]] was issued in 311 by the Roman Tetrarchy of Galerius, Constantine and Licinius, officially ending the [[Diocletian]] persecution of Christianity.
*313 – Roman Emperors [[Constantine I]] and [[Licinius]] issued the [[Edict of Milan]] that legalized Christianity across the whole [[Imperium Romanum|Empire]].
*361 or 362 - Julian the Apostate, Roman emperor, issued a new edict[[Julian (emperor)#Restoration of Paganism as state religion]] that legalized/ recognized all forms of Christianity, as well as Judaism and Paganism, across his empire.

===Middle Ages===
*1436 – The [[Compacts of Basel]] (valid for the [[Crown of Bohemia]], previously declared in 1420 and approved by the [[Council of Basle]] in 1433) were formally accepted by Catholics and Utraquists (moderate [[Hussites]]) at an assembly in Jihlava and agreed by King and Emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], introducing a limited toleration and stating that "the word of God is to be freely and truthfully preached by the priests of the Lord, and by worthy deacons"

===Early modern period===
*1562 – The [[Edict of Saint-Germain]] was an edict of limited toleration issued by [[Catherine de' Medici]] (the [[regent]] for the young [[Charles IX of France]]) that ended insistent persecution of non-Catholics (mostly [[Huguenots]]).  The persecution was a result of the [[Concordat of Bologna]] (1516). A massacre of Huguenots a few weeks later began open hostilities in the French [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]] (1562-1598).
*1568 – The [[Edict of Torda]] (or Turda), also known as the Patent of Toleration (Act of Religious Tolerance and Freedom of Conscience), was an attempt by King [[John II Sigismund Zápolya|John II Sigismund]] of [[Eastern Hungarian Kingdom|Hungary]] to guarantee religious freedom in his realm. Specifically, it broadened previous grants (to Roman Catholics, Lutherans, and Calvinists) to include the [[Unitarian Church of Transylvania|Unitarian Church]], and allowed toleration (not legal guarantees) for other faiths.
* 1573 – The [[Warsaw Confederation]] made all Christian confessions equal in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]
* 1579 – The [[Union of Utrecht]] included a decree of toleration allowing personal freedom of religion. An additional declaration allowed provinces and cities that wished to remain Catholic to join the Union.
* 1598 – The [[Edict of Nantes]], issued by the [[King of France]], [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], was the formal religious settlement which ended the first era of the French Wars of Religion. The Edict granted to French [[Huguenots]] legal recognition as well as limited religious freedoms, including: freedom of public worship, the right of assembly, rights of admission to public offices and universities, and permission to maintain fortified towns. The Edict of Nantes, however, would be revoked in 1685 by Henry IV's grandson, [[Louis XIV]], who once again proclaimed Protestantism to be illegal in France through the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]].
* 1609 – The [[Letter of Majesty]] by King of Bohemia and Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolph II]], valid for the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] and [[Duchies of Silesia]], introducing freedom of religion and religious toleration for all (including non-privileged classes, i.e. peasants etc.)
* 21 April 1649 – [[Maryland Toleration Act]] in the early American colony [[Province of Maryland]], also known as the Act Concerning Religion, was passed by Maryland's colonial assembly mandating religious tolerance for Catholicism. It was the second law requiring religious tolerance in the [[British North American colonies]] and created the first legal limitations on [[hate speech]] in the world. The Calvert family, who founded Maryland partly as a refuge for [[English Catholics]], sought enactment of the law to protect Catholic settlers and those of other religions that did not conform to the dominant [[Anglicanism]] of Britain and her colonies. The Act was revoked in 1654, before being reinstated again, and finally, repealed permanently in 1692 following the [[Glorious Revolution]]. The Maryland Toleration Act influenced related laws in other colonies and was an important predecessor to the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which enshrined religious freedom in American law over a century later.
*16 September 1664 – Edict of Toleration in the [[Electorate of Brandenburg]] (now in [[Germany]]), tolerance of the Protestant denominations with each other
*29 October 1685 – [[Edict of Potsdam]], for reform of Huguenots in Lutheran [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian Kingdom]]
*1689 – [[Parliament]] in [[England]] passes the [[Act of Toleration 1689|Act of Toleration]] protecting [[Protestants]] with [[Roman Catholics]] intentionally excluded

The '''Four Freedoms Award''' is an annual award presented to those men and women whose achievements have demonstrated a commitment to those principles which [[United States|US]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] proclaimed in his [[Four Freedoms|historic speech]] to [[United States Congress]] on January 6, 1941, as essential to democracy: freedom of speech and expression, freedom of worship, freedom from want, freedom from fear. The annual award is handed out in alternate years in [[New York City]] by the [[Roosevelt Institute]] to [[Americans]] and in [[Middelburg]], [[Netherlands]], by the [[Roosevelt Stichting]] to non-Americans.

|filename=FDR's 1941 State of the Union (Four Freedoms speech) Edit 1.ogg
|description =[[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s January 6, 1941 [[State of the Union Address]] introducing the theme of the [[Four Freedoms]] (starting at 32:02)
|image=[[File:FDR in 1933.jpg|alt=Franklin Delano Roosevelt headshot|100px|thumb|[[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]]]
}}
The awards were first presented in 1982 on the centennial of President Roosevelt's birth as well as the bicentennial of diplomatic relations between the United States and the [[Netherlands]]. The awards were founded to celebrate the Four Freedoms espoused by President Roosevelt in his speech:
#[[Freedom of speech]]
#[[Freedom of worship]]
#[[Freedom from want]]
#[[Freedom from fear]]

For each of the four freedoms an award was instituted, as well as a special Freedom medal. In 1990, 1995, 2003 and 2004 there were also special awards.

In odd years the awards are presented to American citizens or institutions by the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute in New York City, though in the past the American awards were given in Hyde Park, New York. In even years the award ceremony is held in Middelburg and honours non-Americans. The choice of Middelburg was motivated by the suspected descendance of the family Roosevelt from [[Oud-Vossemeer]] in the municipality [[Tholen (municipality)|Tholen]].

* St Mark's Church in [[Famagusta]] visit:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stmarksfamagusta.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== Orthodox Christianity ==
In 2010, the US Department of State reported that "Greek Cypriot Orthodox and Maronite Catholics were allowed to perform religious services on a regular basis, without prior permission."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2010/148926.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2010 - Cyprus], US Department of State, Retrieved 2011-04-27&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 September 2010, Resolution 1631, was approved by the U.S. House of Representatives:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"... calling for the protection of religious sites and artifacts from and in Turkish-occupied areas of northern Cyprus as well as for general respect for religious freedom."&lt;ref name=aw&gt;[http://www.armenianweekly.com/2010/10/07/turkey%E2%80%99s-foreign-ministry-decries-%E2%80%98biased-resolution%E2%80%99-on-n-cyprus/ Turkey’s Foreign Ministry Decries ‘Biased Resolution’ on N. Cyprus by Nanore Barsoumian] Armenian Weekly, 7 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Turkish Foreign Ministry responded with a press released statement, saying that the resolution had "many factual errors which may harm the credibility of the House of Representatives".&lt;ref name=aw/&gt;

On 27 January 2011, the Parliamentary Assembly of the [[Council of Europe]], in written declaration no. 467, condemned the alleged interruption of the Christmas mass in Northern Cyprus by Turkish troops and restrictions to the right to freedom of religion and worship.&lt;ref name="coe467"&gt;[http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc11/EDOC12505.pdf Interruption of the Christmas mass in the northern occupied part of Cyprus by Turkish troops and restrictions to the right to freedom of religion and worship] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225181325/http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc11/EDOC12505.pdf |date=2011-02-25 }} Written Declaration No. 467, Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Doc. 12505, 27 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The declaration claimed that Turkish troops forced the priest conducting the service to remove his vestments and ordered everybody to leave the church, thus violating the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="coe467" /&gt;

On 18 March 2011, 204 Greek school books, including religious books, that were being taken to the schools at Rizokarpaso were confiscated by Turkish Cypriot customs officers at the Pergamos village barricade. The Turkish Cypriot daily newspaper ''Afrika'', in a front page article, criticised those who claim that there is freedom of religion in Northern Cyprus when the religious books were confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afrikagazetesi.net/arsivafrika/Mart2011/18mart2011.pdf Islam fanatizmi Isa'ya yasak, Turkish translation: "Islam fanaticism, ban Jesus"], Afrika newspaper, 18 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Church service restriction controversy===
On 20 May 2016, Northern Cypriot Foreign Minister [[Tahsin Ertuğruloğlu]] restricted Greek Orthodox communities to only hold a single religious service per year, with the exceptions of the [[Apostolos Andreas Monastery]] in Rizokarpaso, the [[Monastery of St. Barnabas]] in Famagusta and [[Morphou#Church|St. Mamas' Church]] in Morphou. The remaining churches could be used for one of the following three feasts: the church's [[Name days in Greece|Name Day]], [[Easter]] or [[Christmas]].&lt;ref name=CyMail&gt;{{cite news |author=Andria Kades |title=Turkish Cypriot side restricts Orthodox church services in north |newspaper=[[Cyprus Mail]] |url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2016/05/24/turkish-cypriot-side-restricts-orthodox-church-services-north/ |date=24 May 2016 |accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undersecretary Mustafa Lakadamyalı claimed that the move was to prevent the "abuse" of the permission to hold masses, also citing difficulties with the policing of more than one mass a day or frequent masses. Lakadamyalı also said that "whilst some TRNC citizens can pass to the south even for worship, some absolutely cannot". No restriction was placed on Maronites.&lt;ref name=Kibris&gt;{{cite web |title=KKTC'deki kilse ayinlerine sınırlama |publisher=[[Kıbrıs (newspaper)|Kıbrıs]] |url=http://www.kibrisgazetesi.com/?p=797018 |date=20 May 2016 |accessdate=23 May 2016 |language=tr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision was harshly criticized by Turkish Cypriot group [[Famagusta Initiative]] as "chauvinist and intolerant" and it was pointed out that no problem was encountered in the masses which took place in, for example, the [[Nestorian Church (Famagusta)|Nestorian Church]] in Famagusta.&lt;ref name=Kibris /&gt; Ertuğruloğlu's decision was also criticized by Burak Mavis of the [[Turkish Cypriot Teachers’ Trade Union]] (KTOS) who called out the whole debate as being driven by "a backwards and racist political mentality," but it was defended by [[Yilmaz Bora]], the leader of the Association of the Ex-Servicemen of the [[Turkish Resistance Organisation]], who was cited as saying "it was not possible to live with the Greek Cypriots in a United Cyprus, because the mentality of the Greek Cypriots has not changed in 53 years."&lt;ref name=CyMail /&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=December 2006}}

'''Gaia philosophy''' (named after [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[goddess]] of the [[Earth]]) is a broadly inclusive term for related concepts that living organisms on a [[planet]] will affect the nature of their environment in order to make the environment more suitable for [[life]]. This set of [[Gaia hypothesis|theories]] holds that all organisms on a life-giving planet regulate the [[biosphere]] in such a way as to promote its habitability. Gaia concept draws a connection between the survivability of a species (hence its [[evolutionary]] course) and its usefulness to the survival of other species.

While there were a number of precursors to Gaia theory, the first scientific form of this idea was proposed as the [[Gaia hypothesis]] by [[James Lovelock]], a UK chemist, in 1970. The Gaia hypothesis deals with the concept of biological [[homeostasis]], and claims the resident life forms of a host planet coupled with their environment have acted and act like a single, self-regulating system. This system includes the near-surface rocks, the soil, and the atmosphere. Today many scientists consider such ideas to be unsupported by, or at odds with, the available evidence (see [[Gaia hypothesis#Recent criticism|recent criticism]]). These theories are however significant in [[green politics]].

== Predecessors to the Gaia theory ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Gaia hypothesis]] --&gt;
There are some mystical, scientific and religious predecessors to the Gaia philosophy, which had a Gaia-like conceptual basis.  Many religious mythologies had a view of Earth as being a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts (e.g. some Native American religions and various forms of [[shamanism]]).

[[Lewis Thomas]] believed that Earth should be viewed as a single cell; he derived this view from [[Johannes Kepler]]'s view of Earth as a single round organism.

[[Isaac Newton]] wrote of the earth, "Thus this Earth resembles a great animall or rather inanimate vegetable, draws in [[Aether (classical element)|æthereall]] breath for its dayly refreshment &amp; vitall ferment &amp; transpires again with gross exhalations, And according to the condition of all other things living ought to have its times of beginning youth old age &amp; perishing."&lt;ref&gt;Of Natures obvious laws &amp; processes in vegetation, [http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/newton/mss/norm/ALCH00081 Dibner MS 1031]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], a [[paleontologist]] and [[geologist]], believed that evolution unfolded from cell to organism to planet to solar system and ultimately the whole universe, as we humans see it from our limited perspective.  Teilhard later influenced [[Thomas Berry]] and many Catholic humanist thinkers of the 20th century.

[[Buckminster Fuller]] is generally credited with making the idea respectable in Western scientific circles in the 20th century.  Building to some degree on his observations and artifacts, e.g. the [[Dymaxion map]] of the Earth he created, others began to ask if there was a way to make the Gaia theory scientifically sound.

[[Oberon Zell-Ravenheart]] in 1970 in an article in ''[[Green Egg]]'' Magazine, independently articulated the Gaia Thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://original.caw.org/articles/theagenesis.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617000211/http://original.caw.org/articles/theagenesis.html |archivedate=2010-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

None of these ideas are considered scientific hypotheses; by definition a scientific hypothesis must make testable predictions.  As the above claims are not testable, they are outside the bounds of current science.

These are conjectures and perhaps can only be considered as social and maybe political philosophy; they may have implications for [[theology]], or ''[[thealogy]]'' as Zell-Ravenheart and [[Isaac Bonewits]] put it.

== Range of views ==

According to [[James Kirchner]] there is a spectrum of Gaia hypotheses, ranging from the undeniable to radical. At one end is the undeniable statement that the organisms on the Earth have radically altered its composition. A stronger position is that the Earth's biosphere effectively acts as if it is a self-organizing system which works in such a way as to keep its systems in some kind of equilibrium that is conducive to life.  Today many scientists consider that such a view (and any stronger views) are unlikely to be correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Waltham |first=David |authorlink=David Waltham |date=2014|title=Lucky Planet: Why Earth is Exceptional – and What that Means for Life in the Universe |url=http://www.iconbooks.com/blog/title/lucky-planet/ |location= |publisher=Icon Books |page= |isbn=9781848316560 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beerling |first=David |authorlink=David Beerling|date=2007 |title=The Emerald Planet: How plants changed Earth's history |url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780192806024.do |location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page= |isbn= 978-0-19-280602-4 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cockell |first1=Charles |authorlink1=Charles Cockell |last2=Corfield |first2=Richard |last3=Dise |first3= Nancy  |last4=Edwards |first4=Neil  |last5=Harris |first5=Nigel  |date=2008 |title= An Introduction to the Earth-Life System |url= http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/earth-and-environmental-science/palaeontology-and-life-history/introduction-earth-life-system |location=Cambridge (UK) |publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]] |page= |isbn= 9780521729536 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Tyrrell |first = Toby |title =Gaia: the verdict is… |journal = New Scientist |volume = 220 |pages = 30–31 |date= 26 October 2013 |doi=10.1016/s0262-4079(13)62532-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tyrrell209"&gt;{{citation |last=Tyrrell |first=Toby |authorlink= |date= 2013|title= On Gaia: A Critical Investigation of the Relationship between Life and Earth |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9959.html |location=Princeton |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |page=209 |isbn=9780691121581 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An even stronger claim is that all lifeforms are part of a single planetary being, called Gaia. In this view, the atmosphere, the seas, the terrestrial crust would be the result of interventions carried out by Gaia, through the [[coevolution|coevolving]] diversity of living organisms.

The most extreme form of Gaia theory is that the entire Earth is a single unified organism with a highly intelligent mind that arose as an [[emergent property]] of the whole biosphere. In this view, the Earth's biosphere is ''consciously'' manipulating the climate in order to make conditions more conducive to life. Scientists contend that there is no evidence at all to support this last point of view, and it has come about because many people do not understand the concept of [[homeostasis]]. Many non-scientists instinctively and incorrectly see homeostasis as a process that requires conscious control {{dubious|date=October 2014}} {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}.

The more speculative versions of Gaia, including versions in which it is believed that the Earth is actually conscious, sentient, and highly intelligent, are usually considered outside the bounds of what is usually considered science.

== Gaia in biology and science ==
{{Main|Gaia hypothesis}}

[[Buckminster Fuller]] has been credited as the first to incorporate scientific ideas into a Gaia theory, which he did with his [[Dymaxion map]] of the Earth.

The first scientifically rigorous theory was the [[Gaia hypothesis]] by [[James Lovelock]], a UK chemist.

A variant of this hypothesis was developed by [[Lynn Margulis]], a microbiologist, in 1979.
Her version is sometimes called the "Gaia Theory" (note uppercase-T). Her model is more limited in scope than the one that Lovelock proposed.

Whether this sort of system is present on Earth is still open to debate. Some relatively simple homeostatic mechanisms are generally accepted. For example, when [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] [[carbon dioxide]] levels rise, plants are able to grow better and thus remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Other biological effects and feedbacks exist,&lt;ref name="tyrrell209"/&gt; but the extent to which these mechanisms have stabilized and modified the Earth's overall climate is largely not known.

The Gaia hypothesis is sometimes viewed from significantly different philosophical perspectives. Some environmentalists view it as an almost conscious process, in which the Earth's [[ecosystem]] is literally viewed as a single unified organism. Some evolutionary biologists, on the other hand, view it as an undirected [[emergent property]] of the ecosystem: as each individual species pursues its own self-interest, their combined actions tend to have counterbalancing effects on environmental change. Proponents of this view sometimes point to examples of life's actions in the past that have resulted in dramatic change rather than stable equilibrium, such as the conversion of the Earth's atmosphere from a reducing environment to an oxygen-rich one.

Depending on how strongly the case is stated, the hypothesis conflicts with mainstream [[neo-Darwinism]]. Most biologists would accept Daisyworld-style homeostasis as possible, but would certainly not accept the idea that this equates to the whole biosphere acting as one organism.

A very small number of scientists, and a much larger number of environmental activists, claim that Earth's biosphere is ''consciously'' manipulating the climate in order to make conditions more conducive to life. Scientists contend that there is no evidence to support this belief.

== Gaia in the social sciences ==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

A [[social science]] view of Gaia theory is the role of humans as a [[keystone species]] who may be able to accomplish global [[homeostasis]]. Whilst a few social scientists who draw inspiration from 'organic' views of society have embraced Gaia philosophy as a way to explain the human-nature interconnections, most professional social scientists are more involved in reflecting upon the way Gaia philosophy is used and engaged with within sub-sections of society. Alan Marshall, in the Department of Social Sciences at Mahidol University, for example, reflects upon the way Gaia philosophy has been used and advocated by environmentalists, spiritualists, managers, economists, and scientists and engineers (see The Unity of Nature, 2002, Imperial College Press: London and Singapore). Social Scientists themselves in the 1960s gave up on systems ideas of society since they were interpreted as supporting conservatism and traditionalism.

== Gaia in politics ==

Some radical political environmentalists who accept some form of the Gaia theory call themselves [[Gaian Greens|Gaians]]. They actively seek to restore the Earth's homeostasis — whenever they see it out of balance, e.g. to prevent manmade [[climate change]], [[primate]] extinction, or [[deforestation|rainforest loss]]. In effect, they seek to cooperate to become the "system consciously manipulating to make conditions more conducive to life". Such activity defines the homeostasis, but for leverage it relies on deep investigation of the homeorhetic balances, if only to find [[places to intervene in a system]] which is changing in undesirable ways.

Tony Bondhus brings up the point in his book, ''Society of Conceivia'', that if Gaia is alive, then societies are living things as well. This suggests that our understanding of Gaia can be used to create a better society and to design a better political system.

Other intellectuals in the environmental movement, like [[Edward Goldsmith]], have used Gaia in the completely opposite way; to stake a claim about how Gaia's focus on natural balance and resistance and resilience, should be emulated to design a conservative political system (as explored in Alan Marshall's 2002 book ''The Unity of Nature'', (Imperial College Press: London).

Gaians do not passively ask "what is going on", but rather, "what to do next", e.g. in [[terraforming]] or [[climate engineering]] or even on a small scale, such as [[gardening]]. Changes can be planned, agreed upon by many people, being very deliberate, as in [[urban ecology]] and especially [[industrial ecology]]. ''See [[arcology]] for more on this 'active' view.''

Gaians argue that it is a human [[duty]] to act as such - committing themselves in particular to the [[Precautionary Principle]]. Such views began to influence the [[Green Parties]], [[Greenpeace]], and a few more radical wings of the [[environmental movement]] such as the Gaia Liberation Front and the Earth Liberation Front. These views dominate some such groups, e.g. the [[Bioneers]]. Some refer to this political activity as a separate and radical branch of the [[ecology movement]], one that takes the axioms of the science of ecology in general, and Gaia theory in particular, and raises them to a kind of theory of [[personal conduct]] or [[moral code]].

== Gaia in religion ==

The ecologist and theologian Anne Primavesi is the author of two books dealing with the Gaia hypothesis and theology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westarinstitute.org/membership/westar-fellows/fellows-directory/anne-primavesi/ Anne Primavesi - Westar Institute Westar Institute&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rosemary Radford Ruether]], the American feminist scholar and theologian, wrote a book called "Gaia and God: An Ecofeminist Theology of Earth Healing".

A book edited by Allan Hunt Badiner called Dharma Gaia explores the ground where Buddhism and ecology meet through writings by the [[Dalai Lama]], [[Gary Snyder]], [[Thich Nhat Hanh]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Joanna Macy]], [[Robert Baker Aitken|Robert Aitken]], and 25 other Buddhists and ecologists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parallax.org/cgi-bin/shopper.cgi?preadd=action&amp;key=BOOKDG] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315015100/http://www.parallax.org/cgi-bin/shopper.cgi?preadd=action&amp;key=BOOKDG |date=March 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many new age authors have written books which mix [[New Age]] teachings with Gaia philosophy. This is known as [[New Age Gaian]]. Often referred to as Gaianism, or the Gaian Religion, this spiritual aspect of the philosophy is very broad and inclusive, making it adaptable to other religions: Taoism, Neo-Paganism, Pantheism, Judeo-Christian Religions, and many others.

== Semantic debate ==

The question of "what is an [[organism]]", and at what scale is it rational to speak about organisms vs. biospheres, gives rise to a semantic debate. We are all ecologies in the sense that our (human) bodies contain [[gut bacteria]], [[parasite]] species, etc., and to them our body is not organism but rather more of a [[microclimate]] or [[biome]]. Applying that thinking to whole planets:

The argument is that these symbiotic organisms, being unable to survive apart from each other and their climate and local conditions, form an organism in their own right, under a wider conception of the term organism than is conventionally used. It is a matter for often heated debate whether this is a valid usage of the term, but ultimately it appears to be a [[semantic dispute]]. In this sense of the word organism, it is argued under the theory that the entire biomass of the Earth is a single organism (as [[Johannes Kepler]] thought).

Unfortunately, many supporters of the various Gaia theories do not state exactly where they sit on this spectrum; this makes discussion and criticism difficult.

Much effort on behalf of those analyzing the theory currently is an attempt to clarify what these different hypotheses are, and whether they are proposals to 'test' or 'manipulate' outcomes. Both Lovelock's and Margulis's understanding of Gaia are considered scientific hypotheses, and like all scientific theories are constantly put to the test.

More speculative versions of Gaia, including all versions in which it is held that the Earth is actually conscious, are currently held to be outside the bounds of science, and are not supported by either Lovelock or Margulis.

=== Gaian reproduction ===

One of the most problematic issues with referring to Gaia as an organism is its apparent failure to meet the [[biological]] criterion of being able to [[reproduce]]. [[Richard Dawkins]] has asserted that the planet is not the offspring of any parents and is unable to reproduce.&lt;ref name="Harding2006"&gt;{{cite book |author=Harding, Stephan |title=Animate Earth |publisher=[[Chelsea Green Publishing]] |date=2006 |pages=65 |isbn=1-933392-29-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of religion}}

The '''history of religion''' refers to the written record of human [[religious]] experiences and ideas. This period of religious history begins with the [[invention of writing]] about 5,200 years ago (3200 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/wrtg/hd_wrtg.htm |title=The Origins of Writing &amp;#124; Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prehistory of [[religion]] involves the study of religious beliefs that existed prior to the advent of written records. One can also study comparative religious chronology through a [[timeline of religion]].  Writing played a major role in standardizing religious texts regardless of time or location, and making easier the memorization of prayers and divine rules. The case of the Bible involves the collation of multiple oral texts handed down over the centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Humayun Ansari|title=The Infidel Within: Muslims in Britain Since 1800|year=2004|publisher=C. Hurst &amp; Co. |isbn=978-1-85065-685-2|pages=399–400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "religion" as used in the 21st century does not have an obvious pre-colonial translation into non-European languages. The anthropologist Daniel Dubuisson writes that "what the West and the history of religions in its wake have objectified under the name 'religion' is ... something quite unique, which could be appropriate only to itself and its own history".&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Dubuisson. ''The Western Construction of Religion''. 1998. William Sayers (trans.) Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2003. p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The history of other [[culture]]s' interaction with the "religious" category is therefore their interaction with an idea that first developed in [[Europe]] under the influence of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Fitzgerald.

==History of study==
The school of religious history called the [[History of religions school|''Religionsgeschichtliche Schule'']], a late 19th-century [[Germany|German]] school of thought, originated the systematic study of [[religion]] as a [[society|socio]]-[[culture|cultural]] phenomenon. It depicted religion as evolving with human culture, from primitive [[polytheism]] to [[ethical monotheism]].

The ''Religionsgeschichtliche Schule'' emerged at a time when scholarly study of the [[Bible]] and of [[church history]] flourished in Germany and elsewhere (see [[higher criticism]], also called the ''historical-critical method''). The study of religion is important: religion and similar concepts have often shaped civilizations' law and moral codes, social structure, art and music.

==Overview==
The 19th century saw a dramatic increase in knowledge about a wide variety of [[cultures]] and religions, and also the establishment of economic and social histories of [[social progress|progress]]. The "history of religions" school sought to account for this religious diversity by connecting it with the social and economic situation of a particular group.

Typically, religions were divided into stages of progression from simple to complex societies, especially from [[polytheistic]] to [[monotheistic]] and from extempore to organized. One can also classify religions as circumcising and non-circumcising, proselytizing (attempting to convert people of other religion) and non-proselytizing. Many religions share common beliefs.

==Origin==
{{See also|Evolutionary origin of religions|Timeline of religion}}
The earliest evidence of religious ideas dates back several hundred thousand years to the [[Middle Paleolithic|Middle]] and [[Lower Paleolithic]] periods. Archaeologists refer to apparent intentional burials of [[Archaic humans|early ''Homo sapiens'']] from as early as 300,000 years ago as evidence of religious ideas. Other evidence of religious ideas include symbolic artifacts from [[Middle Stone Age]] sites in Africa. However, the interpretation of early paleolithic artifacts, with regard to how they relate to religious ideas, remains controversial. Archeological evidence from more recent periods is less controversial. Scientists({{which|date=July 2017}} generally interpret a number of artifacts from the [[Upper Paleolithic]] (50,000-13,000 BCE) as representing religious ideas. Examples of Upper Paleolithic remains associated with religious beliefs include the [[löwenmensch figurine|lion man]], the [[Venus figurines]], cave paintings from [[Chauvet Cave]] and the elaborate ritual burial from [[Sungir]].

In the 19th century researchers proposed various theories regarding the origin of religion, challenging earlier claims of a Christianity-like [[urreligion]]. Early theorists [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] (1832-1917) and [[Herbert Spencer]] (1820-1903) proposed the concept of [[animism]], while archaeologist  [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]] (1834-1913) used the term "[[fetishism]]". Meanwhile, religious scholar [[Max Müller]] (1823-1900) theorized that religion began in [[hedonism]] and folklorist [[Wilhelm Mannhardt]] (1831-1880) suggested that religion began in "naturalism", by which he meant mythological explanation of natural events.&lt;ref&gt;"Religion". ''Encyclopedia Universal Ilustrada Europeo-Americana'', 70 vols. Madrid. 1907-1930.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2017}} All of these theories have since been widely criticized; there is no broad consensus regarding the origin of religion.

[[Pre-pottery Neolithic A]] (PPNA) [[Göbekli Tepe]], the oldest religious site yet discovered anywhere&lt;ref name="ArchMag"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.archaeology.org/0811/abstracts/turkey.html| title=The World's First Temple| work= Archaeology magazine |date=Nov–Dec 2008 | page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes circles of erected massive T-shaped stone pillars, the world's oldest known [[megalith]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qR5TCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47|title=The Archaeology of Malta|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107006690|page=47|language=en|last1=Sagona|first1=Claudia|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; decorated with [[Abstract art|abstract]], enigmatic [[pictogram]]s and [[sculpture|carved]] animal reliefs. The site, near the home place of original wild wheat, was built before the so-called [[Neolithic Revolution]], i.e., the beginning of [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]] around 9000 BCE. But the construction of Göbekli Tepe implies organization of an advanced order not hitherto associated with [[Paleolithic]], [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A|PPNA]], or [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B|PPNB]] societies. The site, abandoned around the time the first agricultural societies started, is still being excavated and analyzed, and thus might shed light to the significance it had had for the region's older, foraging communities, as well as for the general history of religions.  

The [[Pyramid Texts]] from ancient Egypt are the oldest known [[religious texts]] in the world, dating to between 2400-2300 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SieAmOiyGQMC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=the+pyramid+texts+oldest+religious|title=An Introduction to Ancient Egyptian Literature|last=Budge|first=Wallis|isbn=0-486-29502-8|page=9|authorlink=E. A. Wallis Budge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6VBJeCoDdTUC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=2353+-+2323+%22pyramid+texts%22|title=The Ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts|last=Allen|first=James|isbn=1-58983-182-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surviving early copies of complete religious texts include: 

The [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], representing complete texts of the Hebrew [[Tanakh]]; these scrolls were copied approximately 2000 years ago. 

Complete Hebrew texts, also of the [[Tanakh]], but translated into the Greek language ([[Septuagint]] 300-200 BC), were in wide use by the early [[1st century]] CE. 

===Advantages of religion===
Organized religion emerged as a means of providing social and economic stability to large populations through the following ways:
* Organized religion served to justify a central authority, which in turn possessed the right to collect taxes in return for providing social and security services to the state. The empires of [[India]] and [[Mesopotamia]] were [[theocracies]], with chiefs, kings and emperors playing dual roles of political and [[spiritual leader]]s.&lt;ref name="shermer"&gt;{{cite book
|title= [[The Science of Good and Evil]]
|isbn= 0-8050-7520-8
|last= Shermer
|first= Michael
|authorlink= Michael Shermer
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Virtually all state societies and chiefdoms around the world have similar political structures where political authority is justified by divine sanction.
* Organized religion emerged as means of maintaining peace between unrelated individuals. Bands and tribes consist of small number of related individuals. However states and nations include thousands or millions of unrelated individuals. [[Jared Diamond]] argues that organized religion served to provide a bond between unrelated individuals who would otherwise be more prone to enmity. He argues that a leading cause of death among band and tribal societies is murder.&lt;ref name="diamond"&gt;Compare: {{cite book|

==Axial age==
{{See also|Axial Age}}
Historians have labelled the period from 900 to 200 BCE as the "axial age", a term coined by [[Germany|German]]-Swiss [[philosopher]] [[Karl Jaspers]] (1883-1969). According to Jaspers, in this era of history "the [[spirituality|spiritual]] foundations of humanity were laid simultaneously and independently... And these are the foundations upon which humanity still subsists today." Intellectual historian [[Peter Watson (intellectual historian)|Peter Watson]] has summarized this period as the foundation time of many of humanity's most influential philosophical traditions, including [[monotheism]] in [[Persia]] and [[Canaan]], [[Platonism]] in Greece, [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] in India, and [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]] in China. These ideas would become institutionalized in time - note for example [[Ashoka]]'s role in the spread of Buddhism, or the role of [[Neoplatonism and Christianity|platonic philosophy in Christianity]] at its foundation.

The historical roots of Jainism in India date back to the 9th-century BCE with the rise of [[Parshvanatha]] and his non-violent philosophy.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=30}}{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p= 182-183}}{{qn|date=July 2017}}

==Middle Ages==
[[File:Medieval-World-Religions.png|thumb|Medieval world religions]]
[[World religion]]s of the present day established themselves throughout [[Eurasia]] during the [[Middle Ages]] by:

* [[Christianization]] of the [[Western world]]
* [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism|Buddhist missions to East Asia]]
* the [[decline of Buddhism in India|decline of Buddhism]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]]
* the [[spread of Islam]] throughout the [[Middle East]], [[Central Asia]], [[North Africa]] and parts of [[Europe]] and India

During the Middle Ages, [[Muslim]]s came into conflict with [[Zoroastrian]]s during the [[Islamic conquest of Persia]] (633-654); [[Christian]]s fought against Muslims during the [[Byzantine-Arab Wars]] (7th to 11th centuries), the [[Crusades]] (1095 onward), the [[Reconquista]] (718-1492), the [[Ottoman wars in Europe]] (13th century onwards) and the [[Inquisition]]; [[Shamanism]] was in conflict with [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], [[Taoism|Taoists]], Muslims and Christians during the [[Mongol invasions]] (1206-1337); and Muslims clashed with [[Hindu]]s and [[Sikh]]s during the [[Muslim conquests of the Indian subcontinent|Muslim conquest of the Indian subcontinent]] (8th to 16th centuries).

Many medieval religious movements emphasized [[mysticism]], such as the [[Cathars]] and related movements in the West, the Jews in Spain (see [[Zohar]]), the [[Bhakti movement]] in India and [[Sufism]] in Islam. [[Monotheism]] reached definite forms in Christian [[Christology]] and in Islamic [[Tawhid]]. [[Hindu views on monotheism|Hindu monotheist]] notions of [[Brahman]] likewise reached their classical form with the teaching of [[Adi Shankara]] (788-820).

==Modern period==
European [[colonisation]] during the 15th to 19th centuries resulted in the spread of Christianity in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], and to the [[Americas]], [[Australia]] and the [[Philippines]]. The invention of the [[printing press]] in the 15th century played a major role in the rapid spread of the [[Protestant Reformation]] under leaders such as [[Martin Luther]] (1483-1546) and [[John Calvin]] (1509-1564).  Wars of religion broke out, culminating in the [[Thirty Years War]] which ravaged central Europe between 1618 and 1648. The 18th century saw the beginning of [[secularisation]] in Europe, gaining momentum after the [[French Revolution]] of 1789 and following. By the late 20th century religion had declined in most of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sacred and Secular: Religion and Politics Worldwide|last=Norris|first=Pippa|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, the regimes of [[Communist Eastern Europe]] and of [[People's Republic of China|Communist China]] were anti-religious. A great variety of [[new religious movements]] originated in the 20th century, many proposing [[syncretism]] of elements of established religions. Adherence to such new movements is limited, however, remaining below 2% worldwide in the period 2000-2009. Adherents of the classical world religions account for more than 75% of the world's population, while adherence to indigenous [[tribal religion]]s has fallen to 4%. {{As of|2005}}, an estimated 14% of the world's population identifies as [[nonreligious]].{{Fact|date=November 2018}}

By 2001 people began to use the internet to discover or adhere to their religious beliefs. In January 2000 the website [[beliefnet]] was established, and the following year, every month it had over 1.7 million visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zabriskie, Phil|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010608152025/http://www.time.com:80/time/interactive/religion/god_np.html|title=I Once Was Lost, but Now I'm Wired |publisher=''[[Time Asia]]''|date=2001-06-04|volume=157|issue=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="996">An '''Iyi-uwa''' is an object from [[Odinani|Igbo mythology]] that binds the spirit of a dead child (known as [[ogbanje]]) to the world, causing it to return and be born again to the same mother.

Many objects can serve the purpose of iyi-uwa, including stones, dolls, hair or pieces of the dead child's clothes, [[omen]]s, or [[Votive offering|offerings]]. The iyi-uwa must be found and destroyed in order for the ogbanje to rest and stop haunting the mother. To find the object, [[shamans]] known as 'dibia' question the spirit and perform rituals to force it to reveal where the iyi-uwa is located.&lt;ref&gt;http://education.yahoo.com/homework_help/cliffsnotes/things_fall_apart/32.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel ''[[Things Fall Apart]]'' by Nigerian author [[Chinua Achebe]] contains a detailed subplot involving an ogbanje child and her iyi-uwa.&lt;ref&gt;''Things Fall Apart'' by Chinua Achebe&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jainism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|eɪ|n|ɪ|z|əm}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title="Jainism" (ODE)|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Jainism|website=Oxford Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; traditionally known as '''''Jain Dharma''''',{{sfn|Sangave|2006|p=15}} is an ancient [[Indian religions|Indian religion]].{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=185, Quote: "Jainism is an ancient Indian religion and from ancient times to the present day, it has continued to flourish, along with other religions, in different parts of India".}} Followers of Jainism are called "Jains", a word derived from the Sanskrit word ''[[Arihant (Jainism)|jina]]'' (victor) and connoting the path of victory in crossing over life's stream of rebirths through an ethical and spiritual life&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tirthankara Tirthankara: Jainism], Encyclopedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; Jains trace their history through a succession of twenty-four victorious saviours and teachers known as ''[[tirthankara]]s'', with the first being [[Rishabhanatha]], who according to Jain tradition lived millions of years ago, and twenty-fourth being the [[Mahāvīra]] around 500 BCE. Jains believe that Jainism is an eternal ''[[Dharma (Jainism)|dharma]]'' with the ''tirthankaras'' guiding every cycle of the [[Jain cosmology]].

The main religious premises of Jainism are ''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahiṃsā]]'' ("non-violence"), ''[[Anekantavada|anekāntavāda]]'' ("many-sidedness"), ''[[aparigraha]]'' ("non-attachment") and ''[[asceticism]]''. Devout Jains take five main vows: ''[[Ahimsa|ahiṃsā]]'' ("non-violence"), ''[[satya]]'' ("truth"), ''[[asteya]]'' ("not stealing"), ''[[brahmacharya]]'' ("celibacy or chastity"), and ''[[aparigraha]]'' ("non-attachment"). These principles have impacted Jain culture in many ways, such as leading to a predominantly vegetarian lifestyle that avoids harm to animals and their life cycles. ''[[Parasparopagraho Jivanam|Parasparopagraho Jīvānām]]'' ("the function of souls is to help one another") is the motto of Jainism. ''[[Namokar Mantra|Ṇamōkāra mantra]]'' is the most common and basic prayer in Jainism.{{sfn|Voorst|2015|p=107}}

Jainism has two major ancient sub-traditions, [[Digambara]]s and [[Śvētāmbara]]s; and several smaller sub-traditions that emerged in the 2nd millennium CE. The Digambaras and Śvētāmbaras have different views on ascetic practices, gender and which Jain texts can be considered canonical. [[Jain monasticism|Jain mendicants]] are found in all Jain sub-traditions, with [[Laity|laypersons]] (''[[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|śrāvakas]]'') supporting the mendicants' spiritual pursuits with resources.

Jainism has between four and five million followers, with most Jains residing in [[Jainism in India|India]].{{sfn|Melton|Baumann|2010|p=lix, 1395}} Outside India, some of the largest Jain communities are present in [[Jainism in Canada|Canada]], [[Jainism in Europe|Europe]], [[Jainism in Africa|Kenya]], the [[Jainism in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], [[Jainism in Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[Suriname]], [[Fiji]], and the [[Jainism in the United States|United States]]. Major Jain festivals include [[Paryushana]] and Daslakshana, [[Mahavir Jayanti]], and [[Diwali (Jainism)|Diwali]].

==Main principles==
===Non-violence (''ahimsa'')===
{{anchor|ahiṃsā}}{{Main|Ahimsa in Jainism}}
[[File:Ahinsa Parmo Dharm.jpg|thumb|Painting with the message ''Ahiṃsā Paramo [[Dharma (Jainism)|Dharma]]'' ("non-violence is the highest virtue or religion")]]

[[File:Ahimsa.svg|thumb|The hand with a wheel on the palm symbolizes [[Ahimsa in Jainism|''Ahiṃsā'' in Jainism]]. The word in the middle is ''ahiṃsā''. The wheel represents the ''[[dharmachakra]]'', which stands for the resolve to halt the ''saṃsāra'' ('transmigration') through relentless pursuit of truth and non-violence.]]

The principle of ''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]]'' ("non-violence" or "non-injury") is a fundamental tenet of Jainism.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=160}} It believes that one must abandon all violent activity, and without such a commitment to non-violence all religious behavior is worthless.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=160}} In Jain theology, it does not matter how correct or defensible the violence may be, one must not kill any being, and "non-violence is one's highest religious duty".{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=160}}{{sfn|Markham|Lohr|2009|p=71}}

Jain texts such as ''[[Acharanga Sutra|Acaranga Sūtra]]'' and ''[[Tattvartha Sutra|Tattvarthasūtra]]'' state that one must renounce all killing of living beings, whether tiny or large, movable or immovable.{{sfn|Price|2010|p=90}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=160-162}} Its theology teaches that one must neither kill another living being, nor cause another to kill, nor consent to any killing directly or indirectly.{{sfn|Price|2010|p=90}}{{sfn|Markham|Lohr|2009|p=71}} Furthermore, Jainism emphasizes non-violence against all beings not only in action but also in speech and in thought.{{sfn|Price|2010|p=90}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=160-162}} It states that instead of hate or violence against anyone, "all living creatures must help each other".{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=160-162}}{{refn|group=note|This view, however, is not shared by all Jain sub-traditions. For example, the Terapanthi Jain tradition, with about 250,000 followers, considers both good karma such as compassionate charity, and bad karma such as sin, as binding one's soul to worldly morality. It states that any karma leads to a negation of the "absolute non-violence" principle, given man's limited perspective. It recommends that the monk or nun seeking salvation must avoid hurting or helping any being in any form.{{sfn|Flügel|2002|pp=1266-1267}}}} Violence negatively affects and destroys one's soul, particularly when the violence is done with intent, hate or carelessness, or when one indirectly causes or consents to the killing of a human or non-human living being.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=160-162}}

The idea of reverence for non-violence (''ahiṃsā'') is founded in Hindu and Buddhist canonical texts, and it may have origins in more ancient [[Historical Vedic religion|Brahmanical]] Vedic thoughts.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=160}}&lt;ref&gt;John Arapura in K. R. Sundararajan and Bithika Mukerji Ed. (1997), Hindu spirituality: Postclassical and modern, {{ISBN|978-81-208-1937-5}}; Chapter 20, pages 392–417&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Izawa (2008), Empathy for Pain in Vedic Ritual, Journal of the International College for Advanced Buddhist Studies, Kokusai Bukkyōgaku Daigakuin Daigaku, Vol. 12, pages 78-81&lt;/ref&gt; However, no other Indian religion has developed the non-violence doctrine and its implications on everyday life as has Jainism.{{sfn|Sethia|2004|p=2}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=176–177}}{{sfn|Winternitz|1993|pp=408–409}}

The theological basis of non-violence as the highest religious duty has been interpreted by some Jain scholars not to "be driven by merit from giving or compassion to other creatures, nor a duty to rescue all creatures", but resulting from "continual self-discipline", a cleansing of the soul that leads to one's own spiritual development which ultimately affects one's salvation and release from rebirths.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=88–89, 257–258}} Causing injury to any being in any form creates bad [[Karma in Jainism|karma]] which affects one's rebirth, future well being and suffering.{{sfn|Taylor|2008|pp=892–894}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= The violence of non-violence: a study of some Jain responses to non-Jain religious practices |journal=The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies| volume=15| year= 1992| number = 1|author=Phyllis Granoff|url= https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/viewFile/8791/2698}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late medieval Jain scholars re-examined the ''Ahiṃsā'' doctrine when one is faced with external threat or violence. For example, they justified violence by monks to protect nuns.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=162-163}}{{sfn|Lorenzen|1978|pp=61–75}} According to Dundas, the Jain scholar Jinadatta Suri wrote during a time of Muslim destruction of temples and persecution that "anybody engaged in a religious activity who was forced to fight and kill somebody would not lose any spiritual merit but instead attain deliverance".{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=163}} However, such examples in Jain texts that condone fighting and killing under certain circumstances are relatively rare.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=162-163}}{{refn|group=note|Jain literature, like Buddhist and Hindu literature, has also debated the aspects of violence and non-violence in food creation.{{sfn|Olson|2014|pp=1–7}}}}

===Many-sided reality (''anekāntavāda'')===
{{Main|Anekāntavāda}}
The second main principle of Jainism is ''anekāntavāda'' or ''anekantatva'',{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=229–231}} a word derived from ''anekānta'' ("not one ended, sided", "many-sidedness" or "manifoldness") and ''vada'' ("doctrine", "way").{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=229–231}}&lt;ref name="grimes34"&gt;Grimes, John (1996) p. 34; {{cite book|author=Philip C. Almond|title=Mystical Experience and Religious Doctrine: An Investigation of the Study of Mysticism in World Religions|url={{Google books|CBSn4dR087YC|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}} |year=1982|publisher= Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-90-279-3160-3|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''anekāntavāda'' doctrine states that truth and reality is complex and always has multiple aspects. Reality can be experienced, but it is not possible to totally express it with language. Human attempts to communicate is ''Naya'', explained as "partial expression of the truth".{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}} Language is not Truth, but a means and attempt to express Truth. From Truth, according to Mahāvīra, language returns and not the other way round.{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}}&lt;ref name=iepmahav/&gt; One can experience the truth of a taste, but cannot fully express that taste through language. Any attempts to express the experience is ''syāt'', or valid "in some respect" but it remains a "perhaps, just one perspective, incomplete".&lt;ref name=iepmahav&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/jain/ Jain philosophy], IEP, Mark Owen Webb, Texas Tech University&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way, spiritual truths are complex, they have multiple aspects, and language cannot express their plurality, yet through effort and appropriate karma they can be experienced.{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}} Since reality is many-sided the great error, according to Jainism, is ''ekānta'' (one-sidedness) where some relative truth is treated as an absolute truth to the exclusion of others.&lt;ref name="The Metaphysics of Paradox"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schwartz |first1=Wm. Andrew |title=The Metaphysics of Paradox: Jainism, Absolute Relativity, and Religious Pluralism |date=2018 |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=9781498563925 |url=https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781498563925/The-Metaphysics-of-Paradox-Jainism-Absolute-Relativity-and-Religious-Pluralism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''anekāntavāda'' premise of the Jains is ancient, as evidenced by its mention in Buddhist texts such as the ''Samaññaphala Sutta''. The Jain Agamas suggest that Mahāvīra's approach to answering all metaphysical philosophical questions was a "qualified yes" (''syāt'').{{sfn|Matilal|1990|pp=301–305}}{{sfn|Balcerowicz|2015|pp=205–218}} These texts identify ''anekāntavāda'' doctrine to be one of the key differences between the teachings of the Mahāvīra and those of the Buddha. The Buddha taught the Middle Way, rejecting extremes of the answer "it is" or "it is not" to metaphysical questions. The Mahāvīra, in contrast, taught his followers to accept both "it is", and "it is not", with "perhaps" qualification and with reconciliation to understand the Absolute Reality.{{sfn|Matilal|1998|pp=128–135}} ''Syādvāda'' (predication [[logic]]) and ''nayavāda'' (perspective [[epistemology]]) of Jainism expand on the concept of ''anekāntavāda''. ''Syādvāda'' recommends the expression of ''anekānta'' by prefixing the epithet ''syād'' to every phrase or expression describing the "permanent being".{{sfn|Koller|2000|pp=400–407}}{{sfn|Sangave|2006|p=48-51}} There is no creator God in Jainism; existence has neither beginning nor end, and the permanent being is conceptualized as ''jiva'' ("soul") and ''ajiva'' ("matter") within a dualistic ''anekāntavāda'' framework.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=90–99, 104–105, 229–233}}

According to Paul Dundas, in contemporary times the ''anekāntavāda'' doctrine has been interpreted by some Jains as intending to "promote a universal religious tolerance", and a teaching of "plurality" and "benign attitude to other [ethical, religious] positions". Dundas states this is problematic and a misreading of Jain historical texts and Mahāvīra's teachings.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=232–234}} The "many pointedness, multiple perspective" teachings of the Mahāvīra is a doctrine about the nature of [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute reality]] and human existence, and it is sometimes called "non-absolutism" doctrine.{{sfn|Sethia|2004|pp=86-91}} However, it is not a doctrine about tolerating or condoning activities such as sacrificing or killing animals for food, nor violence against disbelievers or any other living being as "perhaps right".{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=232–234}} The five vows for Jain monks and nuns, for example, are strict requirements and there is no "perhaps" or "that is just one perspective" about them.{{sfn|Long|2009|pp=98–106}} Similarly, since ancient times, Jainism co-existed with Buddhism and Hinduism according to Dundas, but Jainism was highly critical of the knowledge systems and ideologies of its rivals, and vice versa.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=233}}

===Non-attachment (''aparigraha'')===
{{anchor|aparigraha}}{{Main|Aparigraha}}

The third main principle in Jainism is ''aparigraha'' which means non-attachment to worldly possessions.{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|p=112}} For ascetics, Jainism requires a vow of complete non-possession of any property. For Jain laypersons, it recommends limited possession of property that has been honestly earned, and giving excess property to charity.{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|p=112}} According to Natubhai Shah, ''aparigraha'' applies to both the material and the psychic. Material possessions refer to various forms of property. Psychic possessions refer to emotions, likes and dislikes, and attachments of any form. Unchecked attachment to possessions is said to result in direct harm to one's personality.{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|pp=112-113}}

Jainism views attachments to material or emotional possessions as what leads to passions, which in turn leads to violence.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=160}} According to the ''aparigraha'' principle, a Jain monk or nun is expected to be homeless and family-less with no emotional longings or attachments.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=117, 152}} The ascetic is a wandering mendicant in the Digambara tradition, or a resident mendicant in the [[Śvētāmbara]] tradition.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=117, 152}}

In addition, Jain texts mention that "attachment to possessions" (''parigraha'') is of two kinds: attachment to internal possessions (''ābhyantara parigraha''), and attachment to external possessions (''bāhya parigraha'').{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=76}} For internal possessions, Jainism identifies four key passions of the mind (''[[Kashaya (Jainism)|kashaya]]''): anger, pride (ego), deceitfulness, and greed. In addition to the four passions of the mind, the remaining ten internal passions are: wrong belief, the three sex-passions (male sex-passion, female sex-passion, neuter sex-passion), and the six defects (laughter, like, dislike, sorrow, fear, disgust).{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=77}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=118–119}}

===Jain ethics and five vows===

[[File:Nishidhi stone with 14th century Old Kannada inscription from Tavanandi forest.JPG|''[[Doddahundi nishidhi inscription|Nishidhi stone]]'', depicting the vow of ''sallekhana'', 14th century, [[Karnataka]]|thumb]]
Jainism teaches five ethical duties, which it calls five vows. These are called ''anuvratas'' ("small vows") for Jain laypersons, and ''mahavratas'' ("great vows") for Jain mendicants.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=228–231}} For both, its moral precepts preface that the Jain has access to a ''[[guru]]'' ("teacher", "counsellor"), ''deva'' ("Jina", "god"), doctrine, and that the individual is free from five offences: doubts about the faith, indecisiveness about the truths of Jainism, sincere desire for Jain teachings, recognition of fellow Jains, and admiration for their spiritual pursuits.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=228}} Such a person undertakes the following Five vows of Jainism:
# ''[[Ahiṃsā]]'', "intentional non-violence" or "noninjury":{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=228}} The first major vow taken by Jains is to cause no harm to other human beings, as well as all living beings (particularly animals).{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=228}} This is the highest ethical duty in Jainism, and it applies not only to one's actions, but demands that one be non-violent in one's speech and thoughts.&lt;ref name=pkshah5v&gt;{{citation |last=Shah |first=Pravin K | title=Five Great Vows (Maha-vratas) of Jainism |url= http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~pluralsm/affiliates/jainism/jainedu/5greatvows.htm |publisher=Harvard University Literature Center |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Vijay K.

# ''[[Brahmacharya]]'', "celibacy": Abstinence from sex and sensual pleasures is prescribed for Jain monks and nuns. For laypersons, the vow means chastity, faithfulness to one's partner.&lt;ref name=pkshah5v/&gt;{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=228–231}}
# ''[[#aparigraha|Aparigraha]]'', "non-possessiveness": This includes non-attachment to material and psychological possessions, avoiding craving and greed.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=228–231}} Jain monks and nuns completely renounce property and social relations, own nothing and are attached to no one.{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|p=112}}{{sfn|Long|2009|p=109}}

Of all the major Indian religions, Jainism has had the strongest austerity-driven ascetic tradition, and it is an essential part of a mendicant's spiritual pursuits.{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=118-122}}{{sfn|Caillat|2003b|p=113}}{{sfn|Flügel|2003|pp=169-174, 178-198 with footnotes}} Ascetic life may include nakedness symbolizing non-possession of even clothes, fasting, body mortification, penance, and other austerities, in order to burn away past karma and stop producing new karma, both of which are believed in Jainism to be essential for reaching ''siddha'' and ''moksha'' ("liberation from rebirths", and "salvation").{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=118-122}}{{sfn|Fujinaga|2003|pp=205-212 with footnotes}}{{sfn|Balcerowicz|2015|pp=144–150}}

Jain texts like ''Tattvartha Sūtra'' and ''Uttaradhyayana Sūtra'' discuss ascetic austerities to great lengths and formulations. Six outer and six inner practices are most common, and oft-repeated in later Jain texts.{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=120-121}} According to John Cort, outer austerities include complete fasting, eating limited amounts, eating restricted items, abstaining from tasty foods, mortifying the flesh, and guarding the flesh (avoiding anything that is a source of temptation).{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=120-122}} Inner austerities include expiation, confession, respecting and assisting mendicants, studying, meditation, and ignoring bodily wants in order to abandon the body.{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=120-122}}

Lists of internal and external austerities in Jainism varies with the text and tradition.{{sfn|Flügel|2003|p=182 with footnote 3}}{{sfn|Johnson|1995|pp=196–197}} Asceticism is viewed as a means to control desires, and a means to purify the ''jiva'' ("soul").{{sfn|Flügel|2003|pp=169-174, 178-198 with footnotes}} The ''tirthankaras'' of Jainism, such as the Mahāvīra (Vardhamana) set an example of leading an ascetic life by performing severe austerities for twelve years.{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=121-122}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Jain|first1=Shanti Lal|title=ABC of Jainism|year=1998|publisher=Jnanodaya Vidyapeeth |isbn=81-7628-0003|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Balcerowicz|2015|pp=15–18, 41–43}}

===Food and fasting===
{{Main|Jain vegetarianism|Fasting in Jainism}}

The practice of non-violence towards all living beings has led to Jain culture being [[Jain vegetarianism|vegetarian]]. Devout Jains practice [[lacto-vegetarianism]], that is eat no eggs, but accept dairy products if there is no violence against animals during their production. [[Veganism]] is encouraged if there are concerns about animal welfare.{{sfn|Voorst|2015|p=105}} Jain monks and nuns do not eat [[List of root vegetables|root vegetables]] such as potatoes, onions and garlic because tiny organisms are injured when the plant is pulled up, and because a bulb or tuber's ability to sprout is seen as characteristic of a higher living being.{{sfn|Sangave|1980|p=260}}{{refn|group=note|In Jainism, the ''ahiṃsā'' precept for a mendicant requires avoidance of touching or disturbing any living being including plants. It also mandates never swimming in water, nor lighting or fire or extinguish one, nor thrashing arms in the air as such actions can torment or hurt other beings that live in those states of matter.{{sfn|Taylor|2008|pp=892–894}}}}

Jains fast on different occasions throughout the year, particularly during festivals.{{sfn|Wiley|2009|p=85}} This practice is called ''upavasa'', ''tapasya'' or ''vrata''.{{sfn|Wiley|2009|pp=85-86}} According to Singh, this takes on various forms and may be practised based on one's ability.{{sfn|Ram Bhushan Prasad Singh|2008|pp=92–94}} Some examples include Digambara fasting for ''Dasa-laksana-parvan'' where a Jain layperson eats only one or two meals per day, drinking only boiled water for ten days, or fasting completely on the first and last day of the festival.{{sfn|Wiley|2009|p=72}} With these practices the layperson mimics the practices of a Jain mendicant during the festival.{{sfn|Wiley|2009|p=72}} A similar practice is found among Śvētāmbara Jains on eight day ''paryusana'' with ''samvatsari-pratikramana''.{{sfn|Wiley|2009|pp=72, 85-86}}

The fasting practice is believed to remove karma from one's soul and allow one to gain merit (''punya'').{{sfn|Wiley|2009|p=85}} A "one day" fast in Jain tradition lasts about 36 hours, starting at sunset before the day of the fast and ending 48 minutes after the sunrise the day after.{{sfn|Wiley|2009|p=85}} Among laypeople, fasting is more commonly observed by women, where it is believed that this shows her piety, religious purity, gains her and her family prestige, leads to merit earning and helps ensure future well-being for her family. Some religious fasts are observed as a group where Jain women bond socially and support each other.{{sfn|Wiley|2009|p=86}} Long fasts are celebrated by friends and families with special ceremonies.{{sfn|Wiley|2009|p=86}}

Jainism considers meditation (''dhyana'') a necessary practice, but its goals are very different from those in Buddhism and Hinduism.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=166-169}} In Jainism, meditation is concerned more with stopping karmic attachments and activity, not as a means to transformational insights or self-realization in other Indian religions.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=166-169}} Meditation in early Jain literature is a form of austerity and ascetic practice in Jainism, while in late medieval era the practice adopted ideas from other Indian traditions. According to Paul Dundas, this lack of meditative practices in early Jain texts may be because substantial portions of ancient Jain texts were lost.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=166-169}}

{{anchor|samayika}}According to [[Padmanabh Jaini]], ''[[Sāmāyika]]'' is a practice of "brief periods in meditation" in Jainism that is a part of ''siksavrata'' ("ritual restraint").{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=180–181}} The goal of ''Sāmāyika'' is to achieve equanimity, and it is the second ''siksavrata''.{{refn|group=note|The first is desavakasika (staying in a restrained surrounding, cutting down worldly activities). The third is ''posadhopavasa'' (fasting on the 8th and 14th days on lunar waxing and waning cycles). The fourth is ''dana'' (giving alms to Jain monks, nuns or spiritual people).{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=180–181}}}} The ''samayika'' ritual is practiced at least three times a day by mendicants, while a layperson includes it with other ritual practices such as ''Puja'' in a Jain temple and doing charity work.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=180–182}}{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=261}}{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|pp=128–131}} According to Johnson, as well as Jaini, ''samayika'' connotes more than meditation, and for a Jain householder is the voluntary ritual practice of "assuming temporary ascetic status".{{sfn|Johnson|1995|pp=189–190}}{{refn|group=note|According to Dundas, ''samayika'' seems to have meant "correct behavior" in early Jainism.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=170}}}}

The Digambara Jain scholar Kundakunda, in his ''Pravacanasara'' states that a Jain mendicant should meditate on "I, the pure self". Anyone who considers his body or possessions as "I am this, this is mine" is on the wrong road, while one who meditates, thinking the antithesis and "I am not others, they are not mine, I am one knowledge" is on the right road to meditating on the "soul, the pure self".{{sfn|Johnson|1995|pp=137–143}}{{refn|group=note|This meditative focus contrasts with the ''[[anatta]]'' focus of Buddhism, and the ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'' focus in various ''[[vedanta]]'' schools of Hinduism such as ''[[advaita]]'' and ''[[vishistadvaita]]'' schools.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993| pp=74, 102, Part I: 1–3, 10–11, 24, Part II: 20–28}}{{sfn|Mahony|1997|pp= 171-177, 222}}}}

===Rituals and worship===
{{Main|Jain rituals}}
[[File:Shravanbelgola Gomateshvara feet prayer1.jpg|thumb|Praying at the feet of a statue of [[Bahubali]]]]

There are many rituals in Jainism's various sects. According to Dundas, the ritualistic lay path among Śvētāmbara Jains is "heavily imbued with ascetic values", where the rituals either revere or celebrate the ascetic life of Tirthankaras, or mendicants, or progressively get closer to psychologically and physically living ever more like an ascetic.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=187-189}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=162-165, 295-296}} The ultimate ritual is ''sallekhana'', a religious death through ascetic abandonment of food and drinks.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=187-189}} The Digambara Jains follow the same theme, but the details differ from Śvētāmbaras, and according to Dundas, the life cycle and religious rituals are closer to the liturgy found among Hindu traditions.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=187-189}} The overlap in Jain and Hindu rituals is largely in the life cycle (rites-of-passage) rituals, according to Padmanabh Jaini, and likely one that developed over time because Jains and Hindus societies overlapped, and rituals were viewed as necessary and secular ceremonies.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=291-299}}{{sfn|Wiley|2009|pp=186-187}}

Jains do not believe in a creator god, but do ritually worship numerous deities.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=162-165, 295-296}} The Jinas are prominent and a large focus of this ritualism, but they are not the only ''deva'' in Jainism. A Jina as ''deva'' is not an [[avatar]] (incarnation) in Jainism, but the highest state of omniscience that an ascetic ''tirthankara'' achieved.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=295-299}} Out of the 24 Tirthankaras, Jain devotional worship is predominantly addressed to four: Mahāvīra, [[Parshvanatha]], [[Neminatha]] and [[Rishabhanatha]].{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=40}} Among the non-''tirthankara'' saints, devotional worship is common for [[Bahubali]] among the Digambaras.{{sfn|Cort|2010|pp=182-184}} Some of Jaina rituals remember the five life events of the ''tirthankaras'', called the ''[[Panch Kalyanaka]]'', are rituals such as the ''[[Panch Kalyanaka Pratishtha Mahotsava]]'', ''Panch Kalyanaka Puja'' and ''Snatrapuja''.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=196, 343, 347}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=196–199}}

[[File:A Jain ritual offerings and puja recital at a temple, worship in Jainism.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Jain worship may include ritual offerings and recitals.{{sfn|Wiley|2009|pp=45-46, 215}}]]
The basic worship ritual practised by Jains is ''darsana'' ("seeing") of ''deva'', which includes Jina,{{sfn|Lindsay Jones|2005|p=4771}} or other [[Yaksha|yaksas]], gods and goddesses such as Brahmadeva, 52 Viras, Padmavati, Ambika and 16 Vidyadevis (Sarasvati, Lakshmi, others).{{sfn|Wiley|2009|pp=33, 59, 92, 138, 191}}{{sfn|Cort|1987|pp=235–255}}{{sfn|Mishra|Ray|2016|pp=141–148}} The Terapanthi sub-tradition of Digambaras do not worship many of the deities popular among mainstream Digambaras, and they limit their ritual worship to Tirthankaras.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|p=365}} The worship ritual is called the ''devapuja'', is found in all Jaina sub traditions, which share common features.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=199–200}} Typically, the Jaina layperson enters the temple inner sanctum in simple clothing and bare feet, with a plate filled with offerings, bows down, says the [[namaskar]]a, completes his or her litany and prayers, sometimes is assisted by the temple priest, leaves the offerings and then departs.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=199–200}}

Jain practices include performing ''[[abhisheka]]'' ("ceremonial bath") of the images.{{sfn|Pal|1986|p=29}} Some Jain sects employ a ''pujari'' (also called ''upadhye'') for rituals, who may be a non-Jain (a Hindu), to perform special rituals and other priestly duties at the temple.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=204-205}}{{sfn|Salvadori|1989|pp=169–170}} More elaborate worship includes ritual offerings such as rice, fresh and dry fruits, flowers, coconut, sweets, and money. Some may light up a lamp with camphor and make auspicious marks with sandalwood paste. Devotees also recite Jain texts, particularly the life stories of the tirthankaras.{{sfn|Babb|1996|pp=32–33}}{{sfn|Wiley|2009|pp=45-46, 215}}

The traditional Jains, like Buddhists and Hindus, believe in the efficacy of [[mantra]]s and that certain sounds and words are inherently auspicious, powerful and spiritual.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=81-82}}&lt;ref name="Nayanar 2005b, p.35 Gāthā 1.29"&gt;Nayanar (2005b), p.{{nbsp}}35 Gāthā 1.29&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous of the mantras, broadly accepted in various sects of Jainism, is the "five homage" (''[[Namokar Mantra|panca namaskara]]'') mantra which is believed to be eternal and existent since the first ford-maker's time.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=81-82}} The medieval era Jain worship practices, according to Ellen Gough, also developed tantric diagrams of the ''Rishi-mandala'' where the ''tirthankaras'' are portrayed.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Gough (2012), Shades of Enlightenment: A Jain Tantric Diagram and the Colours of the Tirthankaras, International Journal of Jaina Studies, Volume 8, Number 1, pages 1-47; [http://gsas.yale.edu/news/studying-jainism-and-its-tantric-ritual-diagrams-india Summary Archive: Studying Jainism and its Tantric Ritual Diagrams in India, Ellen Gough]&lt;/ref&gt; The Tantric traditions within Jainism use mantra and rituals that are believed to accrue merit for rebirth realms.{{sfn|Cort|2001b|pp=417–419}}

===Festivals===
{{Main|Jain festivals}}
[[File:Das Lakshana (Paryusana) celebrations, New York City Jain temple 2.JPG|thumb|Celebrating [[Das Lakshana]] (Paryusana), [[Jain Center of America]], New York City]]
Jains celebrate many annual festivals. Many of the major festivals in Jainism fall in and around the ''comasu'' (Sanskrit: ''chaturmasa'') period of the calendar. {{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=146-147}} It is the four month monsoon period when the Jain ascetics are mandated to remain in residence at one place in the Jain tradition, rather than be traveling or going around Indian villages and towns and never staying in one place for more than a month. The ''comasu'' period allows the four orders of the Jain community to be together and participate in the festive remembrances.

The most important annual Jain festival is called the ''Paryushana'' by Svetambaras and ''Dasa lakshana parva'' by the Digambaras. It is celebrated from the 12th day of waning moon in the traditional luni-solar month of [[Bhadra (Hindu calendar)|Bhadrapada]] in the [[Hindu calendar|Indian calendar]]. This typically falls in August or September of the Gregorian calendar.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|pp=164, 284}}{{sfn|Melton|2011|p=673}} It lasts eight days for Svetambaras, and ten days among the Digambaras.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|pp=164, 284}} It is a time when lay people fast and pray. The five vows are emphasized during this time.{{sfn|Melton|2011|p=673}} Svetambaras recite the ''Kalpasūtras'', while Digambaras read their own texts. The festival is an occasion where Jains make active effort to stop cruelty towards other life forms, freeing animals in captivity and preventing slaughter of animals.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|pp=164, 284}}

{{Quote box

 |bgcolor=#FFDDBB

}}
The last day involves a focused prayer/meditation session known as ''[[Samvatsari]]''. Jains consider this as a day of atonement, granting forgiveness to others, seeking forgiveness from all living beings, physically or mentally asking for forgiveness and resolving to treat everyone in the world as friends.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|pp=164, 284}} Forgiveness is asked by saying "''[[Micchami Dukkadam]]''" or "''Khamat Khamna''" to others. This means, "If I have offended you in any way, knowingly or unknowingly, in thought, word or action, then I seek your forgiveness." The literal meaning of ''Paryushana'' is "abiding" or "coming together".{{sfn|Cort|1995|p=160}}

[[Mahavir Jayanti]] celebrates the birth of Mahāvīra. It is celebrated on the 13th day of the luni-solar month of [[Chaitra]] in the traditional Indian calendar. This typically falls in March or April of the Gregorian calendar.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|p=220}}{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|p=211}} The festivities include visiting Jain temples, pilgrimages to shrines, reading Jain texts and processions of Mahāvīra by the community. At his legendary birthplace of Kundagrama in [[Bihar]], north of Patna, special events are held by Jains.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|p=220}}

[[Diwali (Jainism)|Diwali]] is observed by Jains as the anniversary of Mahāvīra's attainment of ''[[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]]''.{{sfn|Pechilis|Raj|2013|p=86}} The Hindu festival of [[Diwali]] is also celebrated on the same date (''Kartika Amavasya''). Jain temples, homes, offices, and shops are decorated with lights and [[Diya (lamp)|''diyas'']] ("small oil lamps"). The lights are symbolic of knowledge or removal of ignorance. Sweets are often distributed. On Diwali morning, ''Nirvan Ladoo'' is offered after praying to Mahāvīra in all Jain temples across the world. The Jain new year starts right after Diwali.{{sfn|Pechilis|Raj|2013|p=86}} Some other festivals celebrated by Jains are [[Akshaya Tritiya]] and [[Raksha Bandhan]], similar to those in the Hindu communities.{{sfn|Pechilis|Raj|2013|p=85}}{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|p=164}}

Jainism monastic organization is a part of Jain society called ''sangh''.{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=48-49}} A ''sangh'' has a four-fold order, or ''caturvidh, sakal sangh''.{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=48-49}} This consists of ''sadhu'' (male ascetics, ''muni''), ''sadhvi'' (female ascetics, ''aryika''), ''[[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|śrāvaka]]'' ("laymen"), and ''śrāvikā'' ("laywoman").{{sfn|Balcerowicz|2009|p=17}}{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|pp=2–3}} The latter two support the ascetics and their monastic organizations called ''gacch'' or ''samuday'', in autonomous regional Jain congregations.{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=48-49}}

Digambar tradition has two main monastic orders [[Mula Sangh]] and the [[Kashtha Sangh]], both led by [[Bhattaraka]]s. Other notable monastic orders include the [[Digambara Terapanth]] which emerged in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;John E.

Jaipur: Rawat, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Śvētāmbaras have their own ''sanghs'', but unlike Digambaras which have had predominantly ''sadhu sanghs'' (male monastic organizations), they have major ''sadhu'' and ''sadhvi'' ''sanghs'' (monks and nuns).{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=48-59}}

According to Śvētāmbara Jain texts, from ''Kalpasūtras'' onwards, its monastic community has had more ''sadhvis'' than ''sadhus'' (female than male mendicants). In ''Tapa Gacch'' of the modern era, the ratio of ''sadhvis'' to ''sadhus'' (nuns to monks) is about 3.5 to 1.{{sfn|Cort|2001a|p=47}} In contrast to Śvētāmbara, the Digambara sect monastic community has been predominantly male.{{sfn|Flügel|2006|pp=314–331, 353–361}} In the Digambara tradition, a male human being is considered closest to the apex with the potential to achieve his soul's liberation from rebirths through asceticism. Women must gain karmic merit, to be reborn as man, and only then can they achieve spiritual liberation in the Digambara sect of Jainism.{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=36–37}}{{sfn|Harvey|2016|pp=182–183}} The Śvētāmbaras disagree with the Digambaras, believing that women can also achieve liberation from ''[[Saṃsāra]]'' through ascetic practices.{{sfn|Harvey|2016|pp=182–183}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=55–59}}

The Jain monastic organization shares many parallels with those found in Buddhist and Brahmanical-Hindu monasticism.{{sfn|Johnston|2000|pp=681–683}}{{sfn|Caillat|2003a|pp=30-34 with footnote 28}} They all have similar rules, hierarchical structure, practices such as not traveling during the four-month monsoon season and celibacy.{{sfn|Caillat|2003a|pp=30-34 with footnote 28}} According to William Johnston, this is not likely from mutual borrowing of ideas, but because these traditions emerged from the same ancient Indian monastic traditions that preceded the Buddha and the Mahāvīra.{{sfn|Johnston|2000|pp=681–683}} There are some differences. For example, the Jain and Hindu monastic community has been traditionally more mobile and had an itinerant lifestyle, while Buddhist monks have favored belonging to a ''sangha'' (monastery) and staying in its premises.{{sfn|Hirakawa|1993|pp=4–7}} Buddhist monastic rules forbid a monk to go outside without wearing the sangha's distinctive ruddy robe, or to use wooden bowls.{{sfn|Johnston|2000|pp=681–683}} In contrast, Jain monastic rules have either required no clothes (Digambara) or white (Śvētāmbara) and the use of wooden or empty gourd as the begging bowl.{{sfn|Johnston|2000|pp=681–683}} The Jain monastic rules have encouraged the use of mouth cover, as well as a broom to gently remove any insect that comes in their path.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2013|p=197}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=152, 163–164}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=190}}

===Supplementary vows and ''Sallekhana''===
Jainism also prescribes seven supplementary vows which include three ''guņa vratas'' ("merit vows") and four ''śikşā vratas''.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=87–88}}{{sfn|Tukol|1976|p=5}}

The ''[[Sallekhana]]'' (or ''Santhara'') vow is a "religious death" ritual vow observed at the end of life, historically by Jain monks and nuns, but rare in the modern age.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=179-180}} In this vow, there is voluntary and gradual reduction of food and liquid intake to end one's life by choice and with dispassion,{{sfn|Jaini|2000|p=16}}{{sfn|Tukol|1976|p=7}} In Jainism this is believed to reduce negative karma that affects a soul's future rebirths.{{sfn|Williams|1991|pp=166–167}}

==Traditions and sects==
{{Main|Jain schools and branches}}

===Digambaras and Śvētāmbaras===
The Jain community is divided into two major [[Religious denomination|denominations]], [[Digambara]] and [[Śvētāmbara]]. Monks of the Digambara ("sky-clad") tradition do not wear clothes. Female monastics of the Digambara sect wear unstitched plain white [[saree]]s and are referred to as ''[[Aryika]]s''. Śvētāmbara ("white-clad") monastics, on the other hand, wear seamless white clothes.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=45}}

During Chandragupta Maurya's reign, Jain tradition states that ''Acharya'' Bhadrabahu predicted a twelve-year-long famine and moved to Karnataka with his disciples. [[Sthulabhadra]], a pupil of ''Acharya'' Bhadrabahu, stayed in Magadha.{{sfn|Clarke|Beyer|2009|p=326}} Later, when followers of ''Acharya'' Bhadrabahu returned, they found those who had remained at Magadha had started wearing white clothes, which was unacceptable to the others who remained naked.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=47}} This is how Jains believe the Digambara and Śvētāmbara schism began, with the former being naked while the latter wore white clothes.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=46}} Digambara saw this as being opposed to the Jain tenet of ''aparigraha'' which, according to them, required not even possession of clothes, i.e. complete nudity. In the 5th-century CE, the Council of Valabhi was organized by Śvētāmbara, which Digambara did not attend. At the council, the Śvētāmbara adopted the texts they had preserved as canonical scriptures, which Digambara have ever since rejected. This council solidified the historic schism between these two major traditions of Jainism.{{sfn|Price|2010|pp=104–105}}{{sfn|Fohr|2015|pp=21–22}} The earliest record of Digambara beliefs is contained in the Prakrit ''Suttapahuda'' of [[Kundakunda]].{{sfn|Jaini|1991|p=3}}

Other than rejecting or accepting different ancient Jain texts, Digambaras and Śvētāmbara differ in other significant ways such as:
* Śvētāmbaras trace their practices and dress code to the teachings of Parshvanatha, the 23rd ''tirthankara'', which they believe taught only Four restraints (a claim, scholars say are confirmed by the ancient Buddhist texts that discuss Jaina monastic life). Mahāvīra taught Five vows, which Digambara follow.{{sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=211}}{{sfn|Umakant P.

* Digambaras believe that both Parshvanatha and Mahāvīra remained unmarried, whereas Śvētāmbara believe the 23rd and 24th did indeed marry. According to the Śvētāmbara version, Parshva married Prabhavati,{{sfn|Kailash Chand Jain|1991|p=12}} and Mahāvīra married Yashoda who bore him a daughter named Priyadarshana.{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|pp=73–74}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=21}} The two sects also differ on the origin of [[Trishala]], Mahāvīra's mother,{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|pp=73–74}} as well as the details of Tirthankara's biographies such as how many auspicious dreams their mothers had when they were in the wombs.{{sfn|Umakant P. Shah|1987|p=17}}
* Digambara believe Rishabha, [[Vasupujya]] and [[Neminatha]] were the three ''tirthankaras'' who reached omniscience while in sitting posture and other ''tirthankaras'' were in standing ascetic posture. In contrast, Śvētāmbaras believe it was Rishabha, Nemi and Mahāvīra who were the three in sitting posture.{{sfn|Umakant P. Shah|1987|pp=79-80}}
* Digambara monasticism rules are more rigid.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|p=167}}
* Digambara [[iconography]] are plain, Śvētāmbara icons are decorated and colored to be more lifelike.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|p=167}}

Excavations at Mathura revealed Jain statues from the time of the [[Kushan Empire]] (c.{{nbsp}}1st century CE). ''Tirthankara'' represented without clothes, and monks with cloth wrapped around the left arm, are identified as the ''Ardhaphalaka'' ("half-clothed") mentioned in texts. The [[Yapaniya]]s, believed to have originated from the ''Ardhaphalaka'', followed Digambara nudity along with several Śvētāmbara beliefs.{{sfn|Jaini|2000|p=167}}

===Other sub-traditions===
Both of the major Jain traditions evolved into sub-traditions over time. For example, the devotional worship traditions of Śvētāmbara are referred to as ''[[Murtipujaka|Murti-pujakas]]'', those who live in and around Jain temples became ''Deravasi'' or ''Mandira-margi''. Those who avoid temples and pursue their spirituality at a designated monastic meeting place came to be known as ''[[Sthānakavāsī]]''.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|p=341}}&lt;ref name=sthanakavasibrit&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sthanakavasi Sthanakavasi], JAIN SECT, Encyclopaedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; About the 18th century, the Śvētāmbara and Digambara traditions saw an emergence of separate Terapanthi movements.&lt;ref name=sthanakavasibrit/&gt;{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=41, 60}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=155-157, 249-250, 254-259}} Some scholars such as Malvaniya state that these ideas entered Jainism from an influence of Islam, while others such as Dundas state that these ideas, debates and movements can be traced in more ancient texts than the start of Islam.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=249}}

In the modern era, according to Flügel, new Jaina religious movements that are a "primarily devotional form of Jainism" have developed which resemble "Jain Mahayana" style devotionalism.{{sfn|Flügel|2005|pp=194–243}}

===Gender and spiritual liberation===
A male human being is considered closest to the apex with the potential to achieve liberation, particularly through asceticism. In the Digambara traditional belief, women must gain karmic merit, to be reborn as man, and only then can they achieve spiritual liberation.{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=36–37}}{{sfn|Harvey|2016|pp=182–183}} However, this view has been historically debated within Jainism and different Jaina sects have expressed different views, particularly the Śvētāmbara sect that believes that women too can achieve spiritual liberation from rebirths in ''Saṃsāra''.{{sfn|Harvey|2016|pp=182–183}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp= 55–59}} The ''Śvētāmbaras'' state the 19th ''Tirthankara'' [[Māllīnātha]] was female.{{sfn|Vallely|2002|p=15}}  However, Digambara reject this, and worship Mallinatha as a male.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=56}}

===''Dravya'' ("Substance")===
{{Main|Dravya}}
[[File:Dravya.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.15|Chart showing the classification of ''dravya'' and ''astikaya'']]
The ''dravya'' in Jainism are fundamental entities, called ''astikaya'' (literally, "collection that exists").{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=93-94}} They are believed to be eternal, and the [[ontology|ontological]] building blocks that constitute and explain all existence, whether perceived or not.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=93-94}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=81–89}}

According to the Śvētāmbara tradition of Jainism, there are five eternal substances in existence: Soul (''jiva''), Matter (''pudgala''), Space (''akasha''), motion (''Dharma'') and rest (''Adharma'').&lt;ref name=britdravyajain/&gt;{{refn|group=note|The ontological categories and definition of ''dharma'' as motion, and ''adharma'' as rest, is unique to Jainism among Indian religions.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=95}} However, like other Indian religions, ''dharma'' also means "moral virtue" in Jainism, while ''adharma'' also means "immorality, unethical behavior".&lt;ref name=britdravyajain/&gt;}} To this list of five, the Digambara Jain tradition adds "Time" (''kala'') as the sixth eternal substance.&lt;ref name=britdravyajain/&gt;{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=93-94}}{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=551}} In both traditions, the substance of space is conceptualized as "world space" (''lokakasha'') and "non-world space" (''alokiakasha''). Further, both soul and matter are considered as active ontological substances, while the rest are inactive.&lt;ref name=britdravyajain/&gt; Another categorization found in Jain philosophy is ''jiva'' and ''ajiva'', the latter being all ''dravya'' that is not ''jiva''.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=93-94}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=81–89}}

====''Jīva'' ("Soul"), ''Ajīva'' ("Non-Soul")====
{{Main|Jīva (Jainism)| Ajiva}}

''Jiva'' means "soul" in Jainism, and is also called ''jivatman''.{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=83-85}} It is a core concept and the fundamental focus of the Jain theology.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=93-94}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=97–101}} The soul is believed to be eternal, and a substance that undergoes constant modifications, in every life, after every rebirth of a living being.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=93-94}}{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=122-125}} ''Jiva'' consists of pure consciousness in the Jain thought, has innate "free will" that causes it to act but is believed to be intangible and formless.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=93-94}} It is the soul that experiences existence and gains knowledge, not mind nor body both believed to a heap of matter.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=94-95}}{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1929b|pp=15-16}} Jain philosophy further believes that the soul is the mechanism of rebirth, and karma accumulation. It is the same size in all living beings, such as a human being, a tiny insect and a large elephant. ''Jiva'' is everywhere, filling and infused in every minuscule part of the entire ''loka'' (realm of existence), according to Jainism.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=94-95}} The soul has the potential to reach omniscience and eternal bliss, and end the cycles of rebirth and associated suffering, which is the goal of Jain spirituality.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=94-95}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=97–106}}

The ''jiva'' is believed to rely on other ''dravya'' to function.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=93-94}} The Jain philosophy completely separates body (matter) from the soul (consciousness).&lt;ref name=britdravyajain&gt;{{citation |title=Dravya – Jainism |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/dravya |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Souls reside in bodies and journey endlessly through ''[[Saṃsāra (Jainism)|saṃsāra]]'' (that is, realms of existence through cycles of rebirths and redeaths).{{sfn|Wiley|2009|p=91}}

''Jivas'' are believed to be of two types, stationary and mobile. Illustration of the former are plants, while moving ''jivas'' include examples such as human beings, animals, gods, hell beings and insects.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=95-96}} ''Jivas'' are further classified in Jain philosophy by assigned number of senses which range from one sensory organ to five sensory organs.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=95-96}} Inert world such as air, fire or clod of dirt, considered non-sensate in contemporary science, are asserted in historic texts of Jainism to be living and with sensory powers.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Key Chapple (2001), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20027724 The Living Cosmos of Jainism: A Traditional Science Grounded in Environmental Ethics], ''Daedalus'', MIT Press, Vol. 130, No. 4, pages 207-224&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ajiva'' consists of everything other than ''jiva''.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=93-96}} Life processes such as breath, means of knowledge such as language, all emotional and biological experiences such as pleasure and pain are all believed in Jainism to be made of ''pudgala'' ("matter"). These interact with ''tattva'' or reality to create, bind, destroy or unbind karma particles to the soul.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=96-98}}{{sfn|Soni|1991|pp=75–88}}

According to Dundas, ''Dharma'' as a metaphysical substance in Jain philosophy may be understood as "that which carries" instead of the literal sense of ordinary physical motion. Thus, ''dharma'' includes all verbal and mental activity, that contribute to karma and purification of the soul.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=95-96}}

===''Tattva'' ("Reality")===
{{Main|Tattva (Jainism)}}
[[File:Tattva.jpg|thumb|The 7 [[Tattva (Jainism)|Tattvas]] of Jain philosophy]]
''Tattva'' connotes "Reality, Truth" in Jain philosophy, and is the framework for salvation. According to Digambara Jains, there are seven ''tattvas'', while Śvētāmbaras believe in nine ''tattvas'':{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=177-187}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=151}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=96-98}}
* The sentient (''jiva'', soul)
* The insentient (''ajiva'')
* The karmic influx (''[[Asrava|Āsrava]]'') to the soul
* Good karma (''punya'', merits), found in the ''tattva'' theory of Śvētāmbara, but not of Digambaras
* Bad karma (''papa'', negatives), found in the ''tattva'' theory of Śvētāmbara, but not of Digambaras
* The bondage (''[[Bandha (Jainism)|Bandha]]'') of karmic particles to the soul, thereby causing its change, which cumulatively determines the future rebirths{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=188-190}}{{sfn|Jaini|1980|pp=219–228}}
* The stoppage (''[[Saṃvara]]'') of karmic influx
* The dissociation and wiping away of past karmic particles (''[[Nirjara|Nirjarā]]'') from the soul
* The liberation (''[[Moksha (Jainism)|Moksha]]'')

The true insight in Jain philosophy is considered as "faith in the ''tattvas''".{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=151}} The spiritual goal in Jainism is to reach ''[[moksha]]'' for ascetics, but for most Jain laypersons and ascetics it is to accumulate good karma that leads to better rebirth and a step closer to liberation.{{sfn|Bailey|2012|p=108}}{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=18, 98-100}}

===Soul and Karma===
{{Main|Karma in Jainism}}
According to Jainism, the existence of "a bound and ever changing soul" is a self-evident truth, an axiom which does not need to be proven.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=103}} There are numerous souls, but every one of them has three qualities (''[[Guṇa]]''): consciousness (''caitanya'', most important quality of soul), bliss (''sukha'') and vibrational energy (''virya'').{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=104-106}} The vibration draws karmic particles to the soul and creates bondages, but is also what adds merit or demerit to the soul.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=104-106}}

Karma, like in other Indian religions, connotes in Jainism the universal cause and effect law. However, it is envisioned as a material substance (subtle matter) that can bind to the soul, travel with the soul substance in bound form between rebirths, and affect the suffering and happiness experienced by the ''jiva'' in the ''lokas''.{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=92-95}} Karma is also believed to obscure and obstruct the innate nature and striving of the soul, as well as its spiritual potential in the next rebirth.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=99-103}}

The relationship between the soul and karma, states Padmanabh Jaini, can be explained with the analogy of gold. Like gold is always found mixed with impurities in its original state, Jainism holds that the soul is not pure at its origin but is always impure and defiled like natural gold. One can exert effort and purify gold, similarly, Jainism states that the defiled soul can be purified by proper refining methodology.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=107}} Karma either defiles the soul further, or refines it to a cleaner state, and this affects future rebirths.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=107-115}} Karma is thus an [[efficient cause]] (''nimitta'') in Jain philosophy, but not the [[material cause]] (''upadana''). The soul is believed to be the material cause.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=117-118}}

''Tirthankara-nama-karma'' is a special type of karma, bondage of which raises a soul to the supreme status of a ''tirthankara''.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1929b|p=48}}

[[File:Jiva.jpg|thumb|left|Classification of ''Saṃsāri Jīvas'' (transmigrating souls) in Jainism]]
Jain texts state that souls exist as "clothed with material bodies", where it entirely fills up the body.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=194}} There are five types of bodies in the Jaina thought: earthly (e.g. most humans, animals and plants), metamorphic (e.g. gods, hell beings, fine matter, some animals and a few humans who can morph because of their perfections), transference type (e.g. good and pure substances realized by ascetics), fiery (e.g. heat that transforms or digests food), and karmic (the substrate where the karmic particles reside and which make the soul ever changing).{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=195-196}}

Jain philosophy further divides the earthly body by symmetry, number of sensory organs, vitalities (''ayus''), functional capabilities and whether one body hosts one soul or one body hosts many.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=195-198}} Every living being has one to five senses, three ''balas'' (power of body, language and mind), respiration (inhalation and exhalation), and life-duration.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=198-201}}{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=34}} All living beings, in every realm including the gods and hell beings, accrue and destroy eight types of karma according to the elaborate theories in Jain texts.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=185-194}} Elaborate descriptions of the shape and function of the physical and metaphysical universe, and its constituents, are also provided in the [[Jain texts]].&lt;ref&gt;Shah, R. S. "JAINA MATHEMATICS: LORE OF LARGE NUMBERS." Bulletin of the Marathwada Mathematical Society 10.1 (2009): 43–61.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=241}} All of these elaborate theories attempt to illustrate and consistently explain the Jain karma theory in a deeply moral framework, much like Buddhism and Hinduism but with significant differences in the details and assumptions.{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=180-182}}

===Saṃsāra===
{{main|Saṃsāra (Jainism)|Vitalism (Jainism)}}
[[File:Gati or existences.jpg|right|thumb|[[Soul]]s are reborn in various realms of existence depending on their [[karma]]s, according to Jainism.]]
The conceptual framework of the Saṃsāra doctrine differs between the Jainism traditions and other Indian religions. For instance, in Jaina traditions, soul (''jiva'') is accepted as a truth, as is assumed in the Hindu traditions. It is not assumed in the Buddhist traditions. However, Saṃsāra or the cycle of rebirths, has a definite beginning and end in Jainism.{{Sfn|Jaini|1980|p=226}} The Jaina theosophy, unlike Hindu and Buddhist theosophies, asserts that each soul passes through 8,400,000 birth-situations, as they circle through ''Saṃsāra''.{{Sfn|Jaini|1980|p=228}}{{sfn|Jaini|2000|pp=130–131}} As the soul cycles, states Padmanabh Jaini, Jainism traditions believe that it goes through five types of bodies: earth bodies, water bodies, fire bodies, air bodies and vegetable lives.{{Sfn|Jaini|1980|pp=223-224}} With all human and non-human activities, such as rainfall, agriculture, eating and even breathing, minuscule living beings are taking birth or dying, their souls are believed to be constantly changing bodies. Perturbing, harming or killing any life form, including any human being, is considered a sin in Jainism, with negative karmic effects.{{Sfn|Jaini|1980|pp=224-225}}{{sfn|Sethia|2004|pp=30-31}}

Souls begin their journey in a primordial state, and exist in a state of consciousness continuum that is constantly evolving through ''Saṃsāra''.{{Sfn|Jaini|1980|p=227}} Some evolve to a higher state; some regress asserts the Jaina theory, a movement that is driven by the karma.{{Sfn|Jaini|1980|pp=227-228}} Further, Jaina traditions believe that there exist ''Abhavya'' ("incapable"), or a class of souls that can never attain ''[[moksha]]'' ("liberation").{{Sfn|Jaini|1980|p=226}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=104-105}} The ''Abhavya'' state of soul is entered after an intentional and shockingly evil act.{{Sfn|Jaini|1980|p=225}} Jainism considers souls as pluralistic each in a karma-samsara cycle, and does not subscribe to ''[[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita]]''-style ("not two") [[nondualism]] of Hinduism, or ''[[Madhyamaka|Advaya]]''-style nondualism of Buddhism.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=104-105}} A liberated soul in Jainism is one who has gone beyond ''Saṃsāra'', is at the apex, is omniscient, remains there eternally, and is known as a ''Siddha''.{{Sfn|Jaini|1980|pp=222-223}}

===Cosmology===
{{Main|Jain cosmology}}

[[File:Jain universe.JPG|thumb|left|Rebirth ''loka'' (realms of existence) in Jain cosmology.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=90-92}}]]

Jain texts propound that the universe consists of many eternal ''lokas'' ("realms of existence"). As in Buddhism and Hinduism, Jain cosmology believes both time and the universe are eternal without beginning and end, and that the universe is transient (impermanent in attributes) at the same time.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=241}}{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=83-85}} The universe, body, matter and time are considered in Jain philosophy as separate from the soul (''jiva'' or ''jivatman''). Their interaction explains life, living, death and rebirth.{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=83-85}}

[[File:Jain Cosmic Time Cycle.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Division of time in Jain cosmology.]]
According to the Jain texts, the universe is divided into three parts, the upper, middle, and lower worlds, called respectively ''urdhva loka'', ''madhya loka'', and ''adho loka''.{{sfn|Shah|1998b|p=25}} As with the realms of existences, ''Kāla'' ("time") is without beginning and eternal;{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=551}} the cosmic wheel of time, called ''kālachakra'', rotates ceaselessly. According to Jain texts, in this part of the universe, there are six periods of time within two aeons (''ara''), and in the first aeon the universe generates, and in the next it degenerates.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=46}} Thus, the worldly cycle of time is divided into two parts or half-cycles, ''utsarpiṇī'' ("ascending") and ''[[avasarpiṇī]]'' ("descending").{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=551}} ''Utsarpiṇī'' is a period of progressive prosperity, where happiness increases, while ''avasarpiṇī'' is a period of increasing sorrow and immorality.{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2016|p=313}}{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=271–272}} According to Jain cosmology, it is currently the fifth ''ara'' of ''avasarpiṇī'' (half time cycle of degeneration). The present age is one of sorrow and misery, of religious decline, where the height and shape of living beings shrink. Jain thought holds that after the sixth ''ara'', the universe will be reawakened in the new cycle and the start of ''utsarpiṇī'' ''aras''.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=13}}{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1929b|p=124}}{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|p=27}}

According to Jain texts, sixty-three illustrious beings, called ''[[śalākāpuruṣa]]s'', are born on this earth in every ''Dukhama-sukhamā'' ''ara''.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=134–135}} The Jain universal history is a compilation of the deeds of these illustrious persons.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=12}} They comprise twenty-four ''Tīrthaṅkaras'', twelve ''[[chakravartin]]s'', nine ''[[balabhadra]]'', nine ''narayana'', and nine ''pratinarayana''.{{sfn|Joseph|1997|p=178}}{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=134–135, 285}}{{refn|group=note|Balabhadra is also referred to as Baladeva, Narayana as Vasudeva or Vishnu, and Pratinarayana as Prativasudeva in Jain texts.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=134–135, 285}}}}

A ''chakravartī'' is an emperor of the world and lord of the material realm.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=134–135}} Though he possesses worldly power, he often finds his ambitions dwarfed by the vastness of the cosmos. Jain ''[[purana]]s'' give a list of twelve ''chakravartins'' ("universal monarchs"). They are golden in complexion.{{sfn|Umakant P. Shah|1987|p=72}} One of the ''chakravartins'' mentioned in Jain scriptures is [[Bharata Chakravartin]]. Jain texts like ''[[Harivamsa Purana]]'' and Hindu Texts like ''Vishnu Purana'' state that Indian subcontinent came to be known as ''Bharata varsha'' in his memory.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=106}}{{sfn|Kailash Chand Jain|1991|p=5}}

There are nine sets of ''balabhadra'', ''narayana'', and ''pratinarayana''. The ''balabhadra'' and ''narayana'' are brothers.{{sfn|Jaini|2000|p=377}} ''Balabhadra'' are nonviolent heroes, ''narayana'' are violent heroes, and ''pratinarayana'' the villains. According to the legends, the ''narayana'' ultimately kill the ''pratinarayana''. Of the nine ''balabhadra'', eight attain liberation and the last goes to heaven. On death, the ''narayana'' go to hell because of their violent exploits, even if these were intended to uphold righteousness.{{sfn|Umakant P. Shah|1987|pp=73–76}}

[[Jain cosmology]] divides the worldly cycle of time into two parts (''avasarpiṇī'' and ''utsarpiṇī''). According to Jain belief, in every half-cycle of time, twenty-four ''tīrthaṅkaras'' are born in the human realm to discover and teach the Jain doctrine appropriate for that era.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2015|p=175}}{{sfn|Jansma|Jain|2006|p=28}}{{sfn|Lindsay Jones|2005|p=4764}} The word ''tīrthankara'' signifies the founder of a ''[[Tirtha (Jainism)|tirtha]]'', which means a fordable passage across a sea. The ''tīrthaṅkaras'' show the 'fordable path' across the sea of interminable births and deaths.{{sfn|Balcerowicz|2009|p=16}} [[Rishabhanatha]] is said to be the first ''tīrthankara'' of the present half-cycle (''avasarpiṇī''). Mahāvīra (6th century BC) is revered as the twenty fourth ''tīrthankara'' of ''avasarpiṇī''.{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|pp=21–28}}{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|pp=182–183}} Jain texts explain that Jainism has always existed and will always exist.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=12}}

In Jainism, perfect souls ''with'' the body are called ''[[Arihant (Jainism)|arihant]]'' ("victors") and perfect souls ''without'' the body are called ''[[Siddha]]s'' ("liberated souls").{{Sfn|Jaini|1980|pp=222-223}}{{sfn|Rankin|Mardia|2013|p=40}}{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=182}}

{{Main|God in Jainism}}
{{See also|Pañca-Parameṣṭhi}}
According to Jainism, the universe was never created, nor will it ever cease to exist. It is independent and self-sufficient, does not require a creator nor any superior power to govern it, nor a judge nor destroyer.{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=83-85}}{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=241-242}} In this belief, it is distinct from the monotheistic Abrahamic religions; it is similar to Buddhism. It shares premises with the non-theistic part of the spectrum of diverse beliefs found in different traditions within Hindu philosophy and distinct from theistic Hindu traditions.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=241-243}}

Jain texts reject the idea of a creator, ruler or destroyer god and postulate an [[Jainism and non-creationism|eternal universe]]. However, Jainism believes in the world of gods and hell beings who are born, and who die to be reborn like living beings in the earthly realm of existence.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=247-249, 262-263}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=20-21, 34-35, 74, 91, 95-96, 103}} Those souls who live in the body of a god do so because of their positive karma. They have a metamorphic body, that is they are believed in Jain thought to be able to change their body at will. The gods live a life of happiness, fun and frolic, whose wishes are automatically fulfilled.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=262-263}} They also possess a more transcendent knowledge about material things and can anticipate events in the human realms.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=262-263}} However, once their past karmic merit is exhausted, the souls leave the "god body" and are reborn again as humans, animals or other beings.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=262-263}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=91, 95-96}}

===Epistemology===
{{Main|Jain epistemology}}
Jain philosophy accepts three reliable means of knowledge (''[[pramana]]''). It holds that correct knowledge is based on perception (''pratyaksa''), inference (''anumana'') and testimony (''sabda'' or the word of scriptures).&lt;ref&gt;John A. Grimes, A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791430675}}, page 238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jsoni367&gt;Jayandra Soni (2000), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1400179 Basic Jaina Epistemology], Philosophy East and West, University of Hawai'i Press, Vol. 50, No. 3, pages 367-377&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas are elaborated in Jain texts such as ''Tattvarthasūtra'', ''Parvacanasara'', ''Nandi'' and ''Anuyogadvarini''.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=75-76, 131, 229-230}}&lt;ref name=jsoni367/&gt; Some Jain texts add analogy (''upamana'') as the fourth reliable means, in a manner similar to [[pramana|epistemological theories]] found in other Indian religions.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=229-230}}

In Jainism, ''jnāna'' ("knowledge") is said to be of five kinds—''[[Kevala Jnana]]'' ("Omniscience"), ''Śrutu Jñāna'' ("Scriptural Knowledge"), ''Mati Jñāna'' ("Sensory Knowledge"), ''Avadhi Jñāna'' ("Clairvoyance"), and ''Manah prayāya Jñāna'' ("Telepathy").{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=16}} According to the Jain text ''Tattvartha sūtra'', the first two are indirect knowledge and the remaining three are direct knowledge.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=6}}

[[File:MahaveeJi.jpg|thumb|The three [[Shikhara|shikhar]] (top) of a [[Jain temple]] represents ''Ratnatraya'' (three jewels)]]

According to Jainism, purification of soul and liberation can be achieved through the path of three jewels:{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=6}}{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=6-7}}{{sfn|Fohr|2015|pp=9–10, 37}}
# ''Samyak darśana'' ("Correct View") {{nsndns}} Faith in basic tenets of Jainism, acceptance of the self-evident truth of soul (''jīva''){{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=141-147}}
# ''Samyak jnana'' ("Correct Knowledge") {{nsndns}} Knowledge of the ''tattvas'' without any doubt or misapprehension{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=148, 200}}
# ''Samyak charitra'' (Correct Conduct) {{nsndns}} behavior consistent with the Five vows{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=148, 200}}

Jain texts often add ''samyak tap'' (Correct Asceticism) as the fourth jewel, thereby emphasizing their belief in ascetic practices as the means to liberation ([[moksha]]).{{sfn|Cort|2001a|p=7}} The four jewels of orthodox Jain ideology are called ''moksha marg''.{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=6-7}} According to Jain texts, the liberated pure soul (''Siddha'') goes up to the summit of universe (''[[Siddhashila]]'') and dwells there in eternal bliss.{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=282–283}}

==Scriptures and texts==
{{Main|Jain literature|Jain Agamas}}

[[File:Jain Agamas.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.85|Stela depicting ''Śhrut Jnāna'', or complete scriptural knowledge]]

Jain scriptures are called ''Agamas''. They are believed to have been verbally transmitted by the [[oral tradition]] from one generation to the next, much like the ancient Buddhist and Hindu texts.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=60-61}} The Jain tradition believes that their religion is eternal, and the teachings of their first ''Tirthankara Rishabhanatha'' were their scriptures millions of years ago.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp= 109–110}} The mythology states that the ''tirthankara'' taught in a divine preaching hall called ''[[samavasarana]]'', which were heard by the gods, the ascetics and laypersons. The discourse delivered is called ''Śhrut Jnāna'' and comprises eleven ''[[Jain Agamas#Angas|angas]]'' and fourteen ''[[purvas]]''.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1929b|p=135}} The discourse is remembered and transmitted by the ''[[Ganadhara]]s'' ("chief disciples"), and is composed of twelve ''angas'' ("departments"). It is symbolically represented by a tree with twelve branches.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1929b|p=136}}

According to the Jain tradition, an ''araha'' ("worthy one") speaks meaning that is then converted into ''sūtra'' (''sutta'') by his disciples, and from such ''sūtras'' emerge the doctrine.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=61}} The creation and transmission of the ''Agama'' is the work of disciples in Jainism. These texts, historically for Jains, have represented the truths uttered by their ''tirthankaras'', particularly the Mahāvīra.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=61}} In every cycle of Jain cosmology, twenty-four ''tirthankaras'' appear and so do the Jain scriptures for that ''ara''.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=109–110}} The spoken scriptural language is believed to be ''[[Magadhi Prakrit|Ardhamagadhi]]'' by the Śvētāmbara Jains, and a form of sonic resonance by the Digambara Jains. These then become coded into ''duvala samgagani pidaga'' (twelve limbed baskets by disciples), but transmitted orally.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=60-61}} In the 980th year after Mahāvīra's death (~5th century CE), the texts were written down for the first time by the Council of Valabhi.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=110–111}}

The Śvētāmbaras believe that they have the original Jain scriptures. The Śvētāmbara belief is denied by the Digambaras, who instead believe the scriptures were lost.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=61}}{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=121-122}} The Śvētāmbaras state that their collection of 45 works represent a continuous tradition, though they accept that their collection is also incomplete because of a lost Anga text and four lost Purva texts.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=112-113}} The Digambara sect of Jainism believes that Āchārya [[Bhutabali]] was the last ascetic who had partial knowledge of the original canon. According to them, Digambara ''Āchāryas'' recreated the oldest-known Digambara Jain texts, including the four ''anuyoga''.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2016|p=xii}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=78-81}}{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=124}} According to von Glasenapp, the Digambara texts partially agree with the enumerations and works of older Śvētāmbara texts, but in many cases there are also gross differences between the texts of the two major Jain traditions.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=121-122}}

The Śvētāmbara consider their 45 text collection as canonical.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=112-113}} The Digambaras created a secondary canon between 600 and 900 CE, compiling it into four groups: history, cosmography, philosophy and ethics.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=123-124}} This four-set collection is called the "four ''Vedas''" by the Digambaras.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=123-124}}{{refn|group=note|Not to be confused with the four ''[[Veda]]s'' of Hinduism.{{sfn|Dalal|2010a|pp=164-165}}}}

The most popular and influential texts of Jainism have been its non-canonical literature. Of these, the ''[[Kalpa Sūtra]]s'' are particularly popular among Śvētāmbaras, which they attribute to Bhadrabahu (c. 300 BCE). This ancient scholar is revered in the Digambara tradition, and they believe he led their migration into the ancient south Karnataka region, and created their tradition.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=125-126}} Śvētāmbaras disagree, and they believe that Bhadrabahu moved to Nepal, not into peninsular India.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=125-126}} Both traditions, however, consider his ''Niryuktis'' and ''Samhitas'' as important texts. The earliest surviving Sanskrit text by [[Umaswati]] called the ''[[Tattvarthasūtra]]'' is considered authoritative Jain philosophy text by all traditions of Jainism. {{Sfn|Jones|Ryan|2007|pp=439–440}}{{Sfn|Umāsvāti|1994|p=xi–xiii, Quote: "That Which Is, known as the ''Tattvartha Sūtra'' to Jains, is recognized by all four Jain traditions as the earliest, most authoritative and comprehensive summary of their religion."}}{{sfn|Dundas|2006|pp=395–396}} His text has the same importance in Jainism as ''[[Vedanta Sūtras]]'' and ''[[Yogasūtras]]'' have in [[Hinduism]].{{Sfn|Umāsvāti|1994|p=xiii}}{{sfn|Jones|Ryan|2007|pp=439–440}}{{sfn|Johnson|1995|pp=46–51, 91–96}}

In the Digambara tradition, the texts written by Kundakunda are highly revered and have been historically influential.{{sfn|Finegan|1989|p=221}}{{sfn|Balcerowicz|2003|pp=25-34}}{{sfn|Chatterjee|2000|p=282–283}} Other important Jain texts include: ''[[Samayasara]]'', ''[[Ratnakaranda śrāvakācāra]]'', and ''[[Niyamasara]]''.{{sfn|Jaini|1991|p=32–33}}

===Influence on Indian literature===
[[File:Mangulam inscription.jpg|thumb|[[Mangulam]] inscription dated 2nd century BCE]]
Parts of the [[Sangam literature]] in Tamil are attributed to Jaina authors. The authenticity and interpolations are controversial, because the Sangam literature presents Hindu ideas.{{sfn|Cush|Robinson|York|2012|pp=515, 839}} Some scholars state that the Jain portions of the Sangam literature were added about or after the 8th-century CE, and they are not the ancient layer.{{sfn|Zvelebil|1992|pp=13–16}}

Tamil Jain texts such as the ''[[Cīvaka Cintāmaṇi]]'' and ''[[Nālaṭiyār]]'' are credited to Digambara Jain authors.{{sfn|Cort|1998|p=163}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=116–117}} These texts have seen interpolations and revisions. For example, it is generally accepted now that the Jain nun Kanti inserted a 445-verse poem into ''Cīvaka Cintāmaṇi'' in the 12th century.{{sfn|Zvelebil|1992|pp=37–38}}{{sfn|Spuler|1952|pp=24–25, context: 22-27}} The Tamil Jain literature, according to Dundas, has been "lovingly studied and commented upon for centuries by Hindus as well as Jains".{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=116–117}} The themes of two of the Tamil epics, including the ''Silapadikkaram'', have an embedded influence of Jainism.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=116–117}}

Jain scholars also contributed to [[Kannada literature]].{{sfn|Cort|1998|p=164}} The Digambara Jain texts in Karnataka are unusual, in that they were written under the patronage of kings and regional aristocrats. These Jain texts describe warrior violence and martial valor as equivalent to a "fully committed Jain ascetic". They thus set aside the religious premise of absolute non-violence, possibly reflecting an effort to syncretise various doctrines and beliefs found in Hinduism and Jainism.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=118-120}}

Jain manuscript libraries, called ''bhandaras'' inside Jain temples, are the oldest surviving in India.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=83}} Jain libraries, including the Śvētāmbara collections at [[Patan, Gujarat]] and [[Jaisalmer|Jaiselmer, Rajasthan]], as well as the Digambara collections in Karnataka temples, have a large number of well-preserved manuscripts.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=83}}&lt;ref name="metmu"&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/jaim/hd_jaim.htm | title=Jain Manuscript Painting | publisher=Heilburnn Timeline of Art History | work=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |date=January 2012 |last=Guy| first= John }}&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscripts in the Jain libraries include Jaina literature, as well as Hindu and Buddhist texts. Almost all their texts have been dated to about, or after, the 11th century CE.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=83–84}} The largest and most valuable libraries are found in the [[Thar Desert]], hidden in the underground vaults of Jain temples. These collections have witnessed insect damage, and only a small portion of these manuscripts have been published and studied by scholars.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=83–84}}

==Comparison with Buddhism and Hinduism==
{{main|Buddhism and Jainism|Jainism and Hinduism}}
Jainism differs from both Buddhism and Hinduism in its ontological premises. All of them believe in impermanence, but Buddhism incorporates, amongst other things, the premise of ''[[anatta]]'' ("non-self", "no eternal self or soul"). Hinduism incorporates the premise of an eternal unchanging ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'' ("self", "soul"), while Jainism incorporates the premises of a ''jiva'' ("self", "soul") that is both eternal and changing.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=87-88}}{{sfn|Wiley|2004|pp=2-5}}{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=122-125}} In Jaina thought, there are infinite eternal ''jivas'', predominantly all of which are in their cycles of rebirth, and a few who have liberated themselves through an ascetic life and become ''siddhas'' ("a perfect one").{{sfn|Hiriyanna|1993|pp=157–158, 168-169}} In contrast to Jainism, Hindu philosophies express a spectrum of views, ranging from [[advaita|nondualism]] where all souls are identical as Brahman and posited as interconnected one, to [[dvaita|dualism]] where souls are same and have Brahman-nature but are different from Brahman, and to other ideas.{{sfn|Hiriyanna|1993|pp=54–62, 77-82, 132}}{{sfn|Perrett|2013|pp=247–248}}{{sfn|Bartley|2013|pp=1-10, 76-79, 87-98}} Further, in Hindu thought, Jainism-style asceticism is not emphasized, rather liberation is achievable through alternate paths such as [[Jnana yoga]], [[Karma yoga]] and [[Bhakti yoga]].{{sfn|Raju|1985|pp=7–8}}{{sfn|Fowler|2012|pp=89–93}}{{sfn|Klostermaier|2007|pp=119–120}}

While both Hinduism and Jainism believe "soul exists" to be a self-evident truth, most Hindu systems consider it to be eternally present, infinite and the constant (''[[vibhu]]'') but some Hindu scholars proposed soul to be atomic. The Hindu thought generally discusses Atman and [[Brahman]] through a monistic or dualistic framework. In contrast, the Jaina thought denies the Hindu metaphysical concept of Brahman, and Jain philosophy considers the soul to be ever changing and bound to the body or matter for each lifetime, thereby having a finite size that infuses the entire body of a living being.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=58, 102-105}}

Some early colonial scholars stated that Jainism like Buddhism was, in part, a rejection of the caste system in Hinduism.{{sfn|Nesfield|1885|pp=116–117}}{{sfn|Pope|1880|pp=40–41}} Later scholars, such as Gombrich state that this notion is an error for which "mainly Western authors are responsible".{{sfn|Alberts|2007|pp=258–259}} A caste system has been a historic part of Jain society.{{sfn|Juergensmeyer|2011|p=54}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=147-149, 304 footnote 24}}{{sfn|Babb|1996|pp=137–145, 54, 172}} According to Vilas Adinath Sangave, "caste system is a universal feature of the Jaina community", and the focus of Jainism has been the spiritual liberation of the individual rather than social reforms.{{sfn|Sangave|1980|pp=73, 316-317}}{{refn|group=note|According to [[Richard Gombrich]] and other scholars, Buddhism too was not a rejection or rebellion against any ancient caste system and it too was focused on individual's liberation from rebirths and suffering. The caste system in Buddhist societies and monasteries outside India have been documented. Gombrich states, "Some modernists go so far as to say that the Buddha was against caste altogether: this is not the case, but is one of the mistakes picked up from western authors."{{sfn|Gombrich|2012|pp=344–353 with footnotes}}{{sfn|Alberts|2007|pp=258–259}}{{sfn|Florida|2005|pp=134–137}}}} According to Padamnath Jaini, the 8th-century Digambara scholar [[Jinasena]] stated that Jain king Bharata, the son of first ''tirthankara'' named [[Rishabhanatha]], invented the caste system by performing the ''ahiṃsā'' (non-violence) test, with Jain [[Brahmin]]s being those who followed the non-violence precept.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|pp=288-289, 78}}

All three religions share concepts and doctrines such as karma and rebirth, and have similar ritual festival grammar, mythologies and monastic traditions.{{sfn|Solomon|Higgins|1998|pp=11–22}}{{sfn|Appleton|2016|pp=1–21, 25–27, 57–58, 82–84}}{{sfn|McFaul|2006|pp=27–28}} They do not believe in eternal heaven or hell or judgment day. Jainism, like Buddhism and Hinduism, grants the freedom to choose beliefs such as in gods or no-gods, agree or disagree with core teachings, participate or not participate in prayers, rituals and festivals. They all consider ethical values such as non-violence to be important,{{sfn|Shaw|Demy|2017|p=635|quote=Ahiṃsā (to do no harm) is a significant aspect of three major religions: Jainism, Hinduism and Buddhism}} and link suffering to craving, individual's actions, intents and karma, and believe spirituality is a means to enlightened peace, bliss and eternal liberation (''moksha'').{{sfn|Solomon|Higgins|1998|pp=18–22}}{{sfn|McFaul|2006|pp=27–40}}

Jainism is similar to Buddhism in [[epistemology|epistemically]] rejecting the Vedas and the Hindu metaphysical concept for Reality called Brahman. Jainism and Hinduism, however, both believe "soul exists" as a self-evident truth, and in their historic theology and practice have been more similar than with Buddhism.{{sfn|Dalal|2010b|pp=174–175}}{{sfn|Solomon|Higgins|1998|pp=18–22}} Jains and Hindus have frequently intermarried over their history, particularly in northern, central and western regions of India.{{sfn|Juergensmeyer|2011|p=54}}{{sfn|Kelting|2009|pp=206 note 4}}

==Art and architecture==

[[File:Thirakoil-Parsava nathar.JPG|thumb|left|Ancient sculpture depicting Parshvanatha at [[Thirakoil]], [[Tamil Nadu]]]]
Jainism has contributed significantly to Indian art and architecture. Jain arts depict life legends of ''tirthankara'' or other important people, particularly with them in a seated or standing meditative posture. ''[[Yaksha]]s'' and ''[[yakshini]]s'', attendant spirits who guard the ''tirthankara'', are usually shown with them.{{sfn|Shah|1998b|p=184}} The earliest known Jain image is in the [[Patna]] museum.

''Ayagapata'' is a type of [[votive]] tablet used in Jainism for donation and worship in the early centuries. These tablets are decorated with objects and designs central to Jain worship such as the ''[[stupa]]'', ''[[dharmacakra]]'' and ''[[triratna]]''. They present simultaneous trends or image and symbol worship. Numerous such stone tablets were discovered during excavations at ancient Jain sites like [[Kankali Tila]] near [[Mathura]] in Uttar Pradesh, India. The practice of donating these tablets is documented from 1st century BCE to 3rd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kishore|first=Kanika|date=2015-06-16|title=Symbol and Image Worship in Jainism|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0376983615569814|journal=Indian Historical Review|language=en|volume=42|issue=1|pages=17–43|doi=10.1177/0376983615569814}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brit&gt;{{cite web|title=Ayagapata|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/46406/ayagapata|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jain|Fischer|1978|pp=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Samavasarana]]'', a preaching hall of ''tirthankaras'' with various beings concentrically placed, is an important theme of Jain art.{{sfn|Wiley|2009|p=184}}

The [[Kirti Stambh|Jain tower in Chittor]], Rajasthan, is a good example of Jain architecture.{{sfn|Owen|2012|pp=1–2}} Decorated manuscripts are preserved in Jain libraries, containing diagrams from Jain cosmology.{{sfn|Shah|1998b|p=183}} Most of the paintings and illustrations depict historical events, known as ''Panch Kalyanaka'', from the life of the ''tirthankara''. Rishabha, the first ''tirthankara'', is usually depicted in either the [[lotus position]] or ''kayotsarga'', the standing position. He is distinguished from other ''tirthankara'' by the long locks of hair falling to his shoulders. Bull images also appear in his sculptures.{{sfn|Shah|1998b|p=113}} In paintings, incidents from his life, like his marriage and [[Indra]] marking his forehead, are depicted. Other paintings show him presenting a pottery bowl to his followers; he is also seen painting a house, weaving, and being visited by his mother Marudevi.{{sfn|Jain|Fischer|1978|p=16}} Each of the twenty-four ''tirthankara'' is associated with distinctive emblems, which are listed in such texts as ''Tiloyapannati'', ''Kahavaali'' and ''Pravacanasaarodhara''.{{sfn|Shah|1998b|p=187}}

A Jain temple, ''Derasar'' or ''Basadi'' is a [[place of worship]] for [[Jains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.kamat.com/glossary/?whoID=234 |title=Basadi |work=kamat.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jain temples are built with various architectural designs,{{sfn|Singhvi|Chopra|2002|p=}}{{Page needed|date=March 2017}} but there are mainly two type of Jain temples:
# [[Shikhara|Shikar]]-''bandhi'' Jain temple (one with a dome)
# ''Ghar'' Jain temple ([[Jain house temple]] – one without a dome).

There is always a main deity also known as ''moolnayak'' in every Jain temple placed inside a sanctum called ''[[Garbhagriha|"Gambhara"]]'' (Garbha Griha). A ''[[manastambha]]'' ("column of honor") is a pillar that is often constructed in front of Jain temples.

There are 26 caves, 200 stone beds, 60 inscriptions, and over 100 sculptures in and around [[Madurai]]. This is also the site where Jain ascetics wrote great epics and books on grammar in Tamil.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=S. S.

The Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves dating back to the 2nd–1st century BCE are dedicated to Jainism. They are rich with carvings of Jain ''tirthanakars'' and deities with inscriptions including the [[Hathigumpha inscription|''Hathigumpha'' inscription]] ("Elephant Cave" inscription).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.proel.org/index.php?pagina=alfabetos/dravidi |title=Source |work=proel.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2016|p=460}} Jain cave temples at [[Badami cave temples|Badami]], [[Mangi-Tungi]] and the Ellora Caves are considered important.{{sfn|Owen|2012|p=50}}

The [[Sittanavasal Cave]] temple is regarded as one of the finest examples of Jain art. It is the oldest and most famous Jain centre in the region. It possesses both an early Jain cave shelter, and a medieval rock-cut temple with excellent fresco paintings comparable to Ajantha paintings; the steep hill contains an isolated but spacious cavern. Locally, this cavern is known as ''"Eladipattam"'', a name that is derived from the seven holes cut into the rock that serve as steps leading to the shelter. Within the cave there are seventeen stone beds aligned in rows; each of these has a raised portion that could have served as a pillow-loft. The largest stone bed has a distinct [[Tamil-Brahmi]] inscription assignable to the 2nd century BCE, and some inscriptions belonging to the 8th century BCE are also found on the nearby beds. The Sittannavasal cavern continued to be the Holy Sramana Abode until the 7th and 8th centuries. Inscriptions over the remaining stone beds name mendicants such as Tol kunrattu Kadavulan, Tirunilan, Tiruppuranan, Tittaicharanan, Sri Purrnacandran, Thiruchatthan, Ilangowthaman, Sri Ulagathithan, and Nityakaran Pattakali as monks.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=S.

===Pilgrimages===
{{Main|Tirtha (Jainism)}}
Jain ''Tirtha'' ("pilgrim") sites are divided into the following categories:{{sfn|Titze|1998|p=}}
* ''Siddhakshetra''{{snds}}Site of the [[Moksha (Jainism)|''moksha'']] of an ''arihant'' (''kevalin'') or ''tirthankara'', such as: [[Mount Kailash|Ashtapada]], [[Shikharji]], [[Girnar]], [[Pawapuri]], [[Palitana]], [[Mangi-Tungi]], and [[Champapuri]] (capital of [[Anga]]).
* ''Atishayakshetra''{{snds}}Locations where divine events have occurred, such as: [[Mahavirji]], [[Rishabhdeo]], [[Kundalpur]], [[Tijara Jain Temple|Tijara]], and [[Aharji]].
* ''Puranakshetra''{{snds}} Places associated with the lives of great men, such as: [[Ayodhya]], [[Vidisha]], [[Hastinapur]], and [[Rajgir]].
* ''Gyanakshetra''{{snds}} Places associated with famous ''[[acharya]]s'', or centers of learning, such as [[Shravanabelagola]].

Outside contemporary India, Jain communities built temples in locations such as [[Nagarparkar]], [[Sindh]] ([[Pakistan]]). However, according to a UNESCO tentative world heritage site application, Nagarparkar was not a "major religious centre or a place of pilgrimage" for Jainism, but it was once an important cultural landscape before "the last remaining Jain community left the area in 1947 at Partition".&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/6111/ Nagarparkar Cultural Landscape], Tantative List, UNESCO World Heritage Centre&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statues and sculptures===
{{Main|Jain sculpture}}

Jain sculptures are mainly images depicting ''tīrthaṅkaras''. A sculpture could depict any of the twenty-four ''tīrthaṅkaras{{'}}s'' images. Parshvanatha, Rishabhanatha and Mahāvīra are among the more popular. These ''tīrthaṅkaras'' usually depicted in the lotus position or ''kayotsarga''.{{sfn|Arora||p=405}} Sculptures of ''chaumukha'' ("quadruple") images are also popular in Jainism. Sculptures of Arihant, [[Bahubali]], and protector deities like [[Ambika (Jainism)|Ambika]] are also found. ''Tirthanakar'' idols look similar and are differentiated by the symbol belonging to each ''tirthanakar'' except Parshvanatha. Statues of Parshvanath have a snake crown on head. There are a few differences between the Digambara and the Śvētāmbara depictions of idols.{{sfn|Cort|2010}} Digambara images are naked without any beautification, whereas Śvētāmbara depictions are clothed and decorated with temporary ornaments.{{sfn|Cort|2010}}

A monolithic, {{convert|18|m|ft|adj=on|abbr=off}} statue of Bahubali, referred to as ''[[Gommateshvara]]'', built in 981 CE by the Ganga minister and commander [[Chavundaraya]], is situated on a hilltop in Shravanabelagola in the [[Hassan district]] of Karnataka state. This statue was voted first in the SMS poll Seven Wonders of India conducted by ''[[The Times of India]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/2256323.cms |title=And India's 7 wonders are |newspaper=[[The Times of India]] |date= 5 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Statue of Ahiṃsā]] (depicting Rishabhanatha) was erected in the [[Nashik district]] in 2015; it is {{convert|33|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/70-crore-plan-for-idol-installation-at-Mangi-Tungi/articleshow/50037188.cms |title=70-crore plan for idol installation at Mangi-Tungi |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=4 December 2015 |last=Botekar |first=Abhilash |agency=TNN |location=[[Nashik]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Idols made from ''[[Ashtadhatu]]'' (literally "eight metals"), [[Akota Bronzes|Akota Bronze]], [[brass]], [[gold]], [[silver]], stone [[monolith]]s, [[Rock-cut architecture|rock cut]], and precious stones are popular in Jainism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url={{Google books|clUmKaWRFTkC|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|title=Indian Sculpture: Circa 500 B.C.-A.D. 700|publisher=Los Angeles County Museum of Art|first=Pratapaditya|last=Pal|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/jais/hd_jais.htm|title=Met Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of ''ayagapata'', [[votive]] tablets for offerings and the worship of ''tīrthankara'', were excavated from [[Kankali Tila]], [[Mathura]]. These sculptures date from the 2nd century BCE to the 12th century CE.{{sfn|Jain|Fischer|1978|pp=9–10}}

===Symbols===
{{Main|Jain symbols}}
[[File:Jain Prateek Chihna.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|The Jain emblem]]
Jain icons and arts incorporate symbols such as swastika, om, and the ''Ashtamangala''.

====Swastika====
The [[swastika]] is an important Jain symbol. Its four arms symbolise the four realms of existence in which rebirth occurs according to Jainism: humans, heavenly beings, hellish beings and non-humans (plants and animals).{{sfn|Cort|2001a|p=17}}{{sfn|Jansma|Jain|2006|p=123}} This is conceptually similar to the six realms of rebirth represented by ''[[bhavachakra]]'' in Buddhism.{{sfn|Cort|2001a|p=17}} It is usually shown with three dots on the top, which represent the three jewels mentioned in ancient texts such as ''Tattvartha sūtra'' and ''Uttaradhyayana sūtra'': correct faith, correct understanding and correct conduct. These jewels are the means believed in Jainism to lead one to the state of spiritual perfection, a state that is symbolically represented by a crescent and one dot on top representing the liberated soul.{{sfn|Cort|2001a|pp=17-18}}

====Symbol of ''Ahiṃsā''====
The hand with a wheel on the palm symbolizes [[Ahimsa in Jainism|''ahimsā'' in Jainism]] with ''ahiṃsā'' written in the middle. The wheel represents the ''[[dharmachakra]]'' ("Wheel of the Dharma"), which stands for the resolve to halt the ''saṃsāra'' ("wandering") through the relentless pursuit of ''ahimsā'' ("compassion").

====''Om''====
[[File:Om_jaïn_orange.svg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Om#Jainism|Om]] in Jainism]]
In Jainism, [[Om#Jainism|''Om'']] is considered a condensed form of reference to the ''Pañca-Parameṣṭhi'', by their initials ''A+A+A+U+M'' (''{{IAST|o[[pluti|3]]}}{{IAST|m}}''). According to the ''[[Dravyasamgraha]]'' by Acharya [[Nemicandra]], ''AAAUM'' (or just ''Om'') is a one syllable short form of the initials of the five parameshthis: "''Arihant'', ''[[Ashiri]]'', ''[[Acharya]]'', ''[[Upajjhaya]]'', ''Muni''".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~malaiya/om.html |title=Om – significance in Jainism, Languages and Scripts of India, Colorado State University|work=cs.colostate.edu }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=410–411}} The ''Om'' symbol is also used in ancient Jain scriptures to represent the five lines of the [[Namokara Mantra|''Ṇamōkāra'' Mantra]].{{Sfn|Agarwal|2012|p=135}}{{Sfn|Agarwal|2013|p=80}}

====Jain emblem====
In 1974, on the 2500th anniversary of the nirvana of Mahāvīra, the Jain community chose one image as an emblem to be the main identifying symbol for Jainism.{{Sfn|Robinson|2006|p=225}} The overall shape depicts the three ''loka'' ("realms of rebirth") of Jain cosmology i.e., heaven, human world and hell. The semi-circular topmost portion symbolizes ''Siddhashila'', which is a zone beyond the three realms. The Jain swastika is present in the top portion, and the symbol of ''Ahiṃsā'' in the lower portion. At the bottom of the emblem is the Jain mantra, ''[[Parasparopagraho Jivanam|Parasparopagraho Jīvānām]]''. According to Vilas Sangave, the mantra means "all life is bound together by mutual support and interdependence".{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=123}} According to Anne Vallely, this mantra is from sūtra 5.21 of Umaswati's ''Tattvarthasūtra'', and it means "souls render service to one another".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anne Vallely|editor=Stephen Bullivant and Michael Ruse|title=The Oxford Handbook of Atheism|url={{Google books|93VoAgAAQBAJ|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}} |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-166739-8|page=358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Jain flag ====
[[File:Jain flag.jpg|thumb|Jain Flag]]
The five colours of the [[Jain flag]] represent the ''[[Pañca-Parameṣṭhi]]'' and the five vows, small as well as great:{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=iv}}
* White – represents the ''[[Arihant (Jainism)|arihants]]'', souls who have conquered all passions (anger, attachments, aversion) and have attained omniscience and eternal bliss through self-realisation. It also denotes peace or ''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahiṃsā]]'' ("non-violence ").
* Red – represents the ''[[Siddha]]'', souls that have attained salvation and truth. It also denotes ''satya''  ("truthfulness")
* Yellow – represents the [[Acharya (Jainism)|''acharya'']] the Masters of Adepts. The colour also stands for ''achaurva'' ("non-stealing").
* Green – represents the ''[[upadhyaya]]'' ("adepts"), those who teach scriptures to monks. It also signifies ''[[brahmacharya]]'' ("chastity").
* Black – represents the [[Jain ascetics]].  It also signifies ''[[aparigraha]]'' ("non-possession").

====''Ashtamangala''====
The ''[[Ashtamangala]]'' are a set of eight auspicious symbols, which are different in the Digambara and Śvētāmbar traditions.{{sfn|Titze|1998|p=234}}

In the Digambara tradition, the eight auspicious symbols are [[Chatra (umbrella)|Chatra]], ''[[Dhvaja]]'', ''[[Kalasha]]'', [[Chaamara]], [[Mirror]], Chair, [[Hand fan]] and Vessel. In the Śvētāmbar tradition, these are Swastika, ''[[Srivatsa]]'', ''[[Nandavarta]]'', ''Vardhmanaka'' ("food vessel"), ''Bhadrasana'' ("seat"), ''[[Kalasha]]'' ("pot"), ''Darpan'' ("mirror") and pair of fish.{{Sfn|Titze|1998|p=234}}

==History==
{{Main|History of Jainism}}
[[File:Photo of lord adinath bhagwan at kundalpur.JPG|thumb|[[Rishabhanatha|Rishabhdev]], believed to have lived over a million years ago, is considered the traditional founder of Jainism.]]

===Origins===
{{See also|Timeline of Jainism|Śramaṇa}}

The origins of Jainism are obscure.{{sfn|Rankin|Mardia|2013|p=975}}{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=13}} The Jains claim their religion to be eternal, and consider [[Rishabhanatha]] to be the founder in the present time-cycle, the first of 24 Jain ''tirthankaras'' in Jain belief, and someone who lived for 8,400,000 purva years.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=16}} According to one hypothesis, such as one by [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]], the first vice president of India, Jainism was in existence before the Vedas were composed.{{sfn|Jambuvijaya|2002|p=114}}{{sfn|Pande|1957|p=353}} According to historians, the first 22 of the 24 ''tirthankaras'' were mythical figures. These figures were supposed to have lived more than 85,000 years ago. They were five to hundred times taller than average human beings and lived for thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= Rishabhanatha, in ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'' | url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Rishabhanatha |publisher=Editors of the Encyclopaedia Britannica |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Sangave|2001|pp=104, 129}}{{sfn|Saraswati|1908|p=444}} The 23rd ''tirthankara'', [[Parshvanatha]], is generally accepted to be based on an ancient historic human being{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|pp=183}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Paul |last=Dundas |title=Jainism |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |date=2013 |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/299478/Jainism }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=10}} of uncertain dates, possibly 8th–7th century BCE.

Some confessional Jain scholars such as Parikh have argued that some images such as those of the bull in [[Indus Valley Civilization]] seal may be related to Jainism, but such claims are highly speculative and a subjective interpretation. This theory has not been accepted by most scholars because very little is known about the Indus Valley iconography and script.{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=53-54}} Jainism, like Buddhism, is one of the ''[[Sramana]]'' traditions of ancient India, those that rejected the [[Veda]]s and developed their own scriptures.{{sfn|Lochtefeld|2002|p=639}}&lt;ref&gt;P. Billimoria (1988), Śabdapramāṇa: Word and Knowledge, Studies of Classical India Volume 10, Springer, {{ISBN|978-94-010-7810-8}}, pages 1-30&lt;/ref&gt;

There is inscriptional evidence for the presence of Jain monks in south India by the second or first centuries BC, and archaeological evidence of Jain monks in Saurashtra in Gujarat by the second century CE.{{sfn|Cort|2010|p=202}} Statues of Jain ''tirthankara'' have been found dating back to second century BC.{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2016|p=444}}

===Political history===
[[File:Udayagiri Caves - Rani Gumpha 01.jpg|thumb|[[Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves]] built by [[King Kharavela]] of [[Mahameghavahana dynasty]] in 2nd century BCE]]
Information regarding the political history of Jainism is uncertain and fragmentary. Jains consider the king [[Bimbisara]] (c. 558–491 BCE), [[Ajatashatru]] (c. 492–460 BCE), and [[Udayin]] (c. 460-440 BCE) of the [[Haryanka dynasty]] as a patron of Jainism.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=41}}

Jain tradition states that [[Chandragupta Maurya]] (322–298 BCE), the founder of the [[Mauryan Empire]] and grandfather of [[Ashoka]], became a monk and disciple of Jain ascetic [[Bhadrabahu]] during later part of his life. According to historians, Chandragupta's story appears in various versions in Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu texts.{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|pp=4–21, 232–237}} Broadly, Chandragupta was born into a humble family, abandoned, raised as a son by another family, then with the training and counsel of Chanakya of ''[[Arthashastra]]'' fame ultimately built one of the largest empires in ancient India.&lt;ref name=britchandrag&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Chandragupta Chandragupta Maurya, EMPEROR OF INDIA], Encyclopaedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rothermund2004p63"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Roger Boesche|author=Roger Boesche|title=The First Great Political Realist: Kautilya and His Arthashastra|url={{Google books|K85NA7Rg67wC|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}} |year=2003|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-0607-5|pages=7–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jain history, late in his life, Chandragupta renounced the empire he built and handed over his power to his son, became a Jaina monk, and headed to meditate and pursue spirituality in the Deccan region, under the Jaina teacher Bhadrabahu at Shravanabelagola.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=42}} There state Jain texts, he died by fasting, a Jaina ascetic method of ending one's life by choice (''Sallenkana vrata'').&lt;ref name=britchandrag/&gt;{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|pp=39–46, 234-236}}&lt;ref name="Rothermund2004p63"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hermann Kulke|author2=Dietmar Rothermund|title=A History of India|url={{Google books|RoW9GuFJ9GIC|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}} |year=2004|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-32920-0|pages=63–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 3rd century BCE emperor Ashoka, in his pillar edicts, mentions several ancient Indian religious groups including the ''Niganthas'' (Jaina).{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=43}}

According to another Jain legend, King [[Salivahana]] of the late 1st century CE was a patron of Jainism, as were many others in the early centuries of the 1st millennium CE. But von Glasenapp states that the historicity of these stories is difficult to establish.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=51}} Archeological evidence suggests that Mathura was an important Jain centre between the 2nd century BCE and the 5th century CE. Inscriptions from the 1st and 2nd century CE show that the schism between Digambara and Śvētāmbara had already taken place.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=49}}

King Harshavardhana of the 7th century grew up in [[Shaivism]], following his family, but he championed Jainism, Buddhism and all traditions of Hinduism.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=52}} King Ama of the 8th century converted to Jainism, and the Jaina pilgrimage tradition was well established in his era.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=52-54}} Mularaja, the founder of [[Chalukya dynasty]], constructed a Jain temple, even though he was not a Jain.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=56}}

In the second half of the 1st century CE, Hindu kings sponsored and helped build major Jaina cave temples. For example, the Hindu [[Rashtrakuta]] dynasty started the early group of Jain temples,&lt;ref name=pereira21&gt;{{cite book|author=José Pereira|title=Monolithic Jinas|url={{Google books|LMTgiygj4-oC|page=PA24|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|year=1977|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-2397-6|pages=21–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Seuna (Yadava) dynasty|Yadava dynasty]] built many of the middle and later Jain group of temples at the [[Ellora Caves]] between 700 and 1000 CE.&lt;ref name=asiintro&gt;[http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_whs_ellora.asp World Heritage Sites - Ellora Caves], Archeological Survey of India (2011), Government of India&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Madan&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 178|editor=K.S.

Mahāvīra and Buddha are generally accepted as contemporaries (circa 5th century BCE).{{sfn|Dundas|2003a|p=383}}&lt;ref name=keown127&gt;{{cite book|author1=Damien Keown|author2=Charles S.

Buddhist texts refer to Mahāvīra as ''Nigantha Nataputta''.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=105}}

Beyond the times of the Mahāvīra and the Buddha, the two ascetic ''sramana'' ("seeker") religions competed for followers as well as the merchant trade networks that sustained them.{{sfn|Hirakawa|1993|pp=4–7}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jason Neelis|title=Early Buddhist Transmission and Trade Networks: Mobility and Exchange Within and Beyond the Northwestern Borderlands of South Asia|url={{Google books|GB-JV2eOr2UC|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}} |year=2010|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-18159-8|pages=72–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their mutual interaction, along with those of Hindu traditions, have been significant. In some cases the titles of the Buddhist and Jaina texts are the same or similar but present different doctrines.{{sfn|Dundas|2003b|pp=ix–xi, 151–162}}

Royal patronage has been a key factor in the growth as well as the decline of Jainism.{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|pp=69–70}} The Pallava King [[Mahendravarman I]] (600{{nsndns}}630 CE) converted from Jainism to Shaivism under the influence of [[Appar]].{{sfn|Lochtefeld|2002|p=409}} His work ''[[Mattavilasa Prahasana]]'' ridicules certain Shaiva sects and the Buddhists and also expresses contempt towards Jain ascetics.{{sfn|Arunachalam|1981|p=170}} Sambandar converted the contemporary [[Pandyan Dynasty|Pandya]] king to Shaivism. During the 11th century, [[Basava]], a minister to the Jain [[Kalachuris of Kalyani|Kalachuri]] king [[Bijjala II|Bijjala]], succeeded in converting numerous Jains to the [[Lingayatism|Lingayat]] Shaivite sect. The Lingayats destroyed various temples belonging to Jains and adapted them to their use.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=75–77}} The [[Hoysala Dynasty|Hoysala]] King [[Vishnuvardhana]] (c.{{nbsp}}1108{{nsndns}}1152 CE) became a follower of the [[Vaishnava]] sect under the influence of [[Ramanuja]], after which Vaishnavism grew rapidly in what is now Karnataka.{{sfn|Das|2005|p=161}}

[[File:La grotte Jain Indra Sabha Ellora Caves, India.jpg|thumb|left|The Indra Sabha cave at the [[Ellora Caves]], are co-located with Hindu and Buddhist monuments.]]
Jainism and Hinduism influenced each other. Jain texts declare some of the Hindu gods as blood relatives of legendary ''tirthankara''. Neminatha, the 22nd ''tirthankara'' for example is presented as a cousin of Krishna in Jain Puranas and other texts.&lt;ref name=britneminatha&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Arishtanemi Arishtanemi: JAINA SAINT], Encyclopaedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Long|2009|p=42}} However, Jain scholars such as [[Haribhadra]] also wrote satires about Hindu gods, mocking them with novel outrageous stories where the gods misbehave and act unethically.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=236-237}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John R. Hinnells|title=Who's Who of World Religions|url={{Google books|CDSxCwAAQBAJ|page=PA145|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|year=1991|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1-349-09500-1|pages=145–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindu gods are presented by some Jain writers as persecuting, tempting, afraid of, or serving a legendary Jina before he gains omniscience. In other stories, one or more Jinas easily defeat the Hindu deities such as [[Vishnu]], or [[Rama]] and [[Sita]] who come to pay respect to a Jina at a major Jain pilgrimage site such as Mount Satrunjaya.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=113-115, 222-223, 236-237}}

The Jain and Hindu communities have often been very close and mutually accepting. Some Hindu temples have included a Jain ''Tirthankara'' within its premises in a place of honour.{{sfn|Long|2009|pp=5-6}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ramesh Chandra Sharma|author2=Pranati Ghosal|title=Jaina Contribution to Varanasi |url={{Google books|YoLXAAAAMAAJ|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}} |year=2006|publisher=Jnanapravaha|isbn=978-81-246-0341-3|pages=100–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly numerous temple complexes feature both Hindu and Jain monuments, with [[Badami cave temples]] and [[Khajuraho]] among some of the most well known.{{Sfn|Michell|2014|p=38-52, 60-61}}&lt;ref&gt;Trudy King et al., Asia and Oceania: International Dictionary of Historic Places, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1884964046}}, pages 468-470&lt;/ref&gt;

Jainism faced persecution during and after the [[Muslim conquests on the Indian subcontinent]].{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=145-146, 124}} Muslims rulers, such as [[Mahmud Ghazni]] (1001), [[Mohammad Ghori]] (1175) and [[Alauddin Khalji|Ala-ud-din Muhammed Shah Khalji]] (1298) further oppressed the Jain community.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=74–75}} They vandalised idols and destroyed temples or converted them into mosques. They also burned Jain books and killed Jains. There were significant exceptions, such as Emperor [[Akbar]] (1542{{nsndns}}1605) whose legendary religious tolerance, out of respect for Jains, ordered the release of caged birds and banned the killing of animals on the Jain festival of Paryusan.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=146}} After Akbar, Jains faced an intense period of Muslim persecution in the 17th century.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=220-221}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Truschke|first=Audrey|date=2015-09-01|title=Dangerous Debates: Jain responses to theological challenges at the Mughal court*|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/modern-asian-studies/article/dangerous-debates-jain-responses-to-theological-challenges-at-the-mughal-court/8A3F928B34C46E3583FF6577968805A4|journal=Modern Asian Studies|volume=49|issue=5|pages=1311–1344|doi=10.1017/S0026749X14000055|issn=0026-749X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jain community were the traditional bankers and financiers, and this significantly impacted the Muslim rulers. However, they rarely were a part of the political power during the Islamic rule period of the Indian subcontinent.{{sfn|Cort|1998|pp=85-86}}

===Colonial era===
Colonial era reports and Christian missions variously viewed Jainism as either a sect of Hinduism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=British India|title=Various Census of India: 1871-1872|url={{Google books|4AEJAAAAQAAJ|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}} |year=1867|publisher=Government of India|pages=31 note 140}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Buddhism, or as a distinct religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Washburn Hopkins|title=The Religions of India|url={{Google books|O0IvAAAAYAAJ|page=PA283|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|year=1902|publisher=Ginn &amp; Company|page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=A.J. Sunavala|title=Adarsha Sadhu: An Ideal Monk|url={{Google books|oUU4AAAAIAAJ|page=PA91|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|year=1934|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-00-140429-5|pages=91–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Padmanath Jaini, Christian missionaries expressed extreme frustration at Jain people without pagan creator gods refusing to convert to Christianity, while colonial era Jain scholars such as [[Champat Rai Jain]] defended Jainism against criticism and misrepresentation by Christian activists.{{sfn|Jaini|2000|p=33}} Missionaries of Christianity and Islam considered Jain traditions as idolatrous and a false religion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rosalind I. J.

These criticisms, states [[John E. Cort|John Cort]], were flawed and also ignored similar practices within sects of Christianity.{{sfn|Cort|2010|pp=12-16, 200-207, 218-219, 251 with note 10}}

The British colonial government in India, as well as Indian princely states, passed laws that made monks roaming naked in streets a crime, one that led to arrest. This law particularly impacted the Digambara monks.{{sfn|Flügel|2006|pp=348–349}} The Akhil Bharatiya Jaina Samaj opposed this law, and argued that it interfered with the religious rights of Jains. Acharya [[Shantisagar]] entered Bombay (now Mumbai) in 1927, but was forced to cover his body. He then led an India-wide tour as the naked monk with his followers, to various Digambara sacred sites, and was welcomed by kings of the Maharashtra provinces.{{sfn|Flügel|2006|pp=348–349}} Shantisagar fasted to oppose the restrictions imposed on Digambara monks by the [[British Raj]] and prompted their discontinuance.{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|p=56}} The colonial era laws that banned naked monks remained effective through World War II, but they were abolished by independent India after it gained independence.{{sfn|Flügel|2006|pp=359–360}}

{{Main|Jain community}}
[[File:Pakbirra Jain Shrine of Purulia 03.jpg|thumb|Ancient [[Purulia district#Tourism|temple of Pakbirra, Purulia]] ]]
Followers of the path practised by the Jinas are known as Jains.{{sfn|Sangave|2006|p=15}}{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2016|p=313}} The majority of Jains currently reside in India.

Jainism has been praised for some of its practices and beliefs.
[[Mahatma Gandhi]], who was greatly influenced by Jainism, said:{{sfn|Rudolph|Rudolph|1984|p=171}}
{{quote|No religion in the World has explained the principle of ''Ahiṃsā'' so deeply and systematically as is discussed with its applicability in every human life in Jainism. As and when the benevolent principle of ''Ahiṃsā'' or non-violence will be ascribed for practice by the people of the world to achieve their end of life in this world and beyond, Jainism is sure to have the uppermost status and Mahāvīra is sure to be respected as the greatest authority on ''Ahiṃsā''.{{sfn|Janardan Pandey|1998|p=50}}}}

'''''Justitia civilis''''' or "''things external''" is defined by [[Christian theologians]] as the class of acts in which fallen man retains his ability to perform both [[Goodness and evil|good and evil]] moral acts. This means that he can be kind and just, and fulfill his social duties in a manner to secure the approbation of his fellow-men. It is not meant that the state of mind in which these acts are performed, or the motives by which they are determined, are such as to meet the approbation of an infinitely [[God]]; but simply that these acts, as to the matter of them, are prescribed by the moral law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9010">'''Law and religion''' is the interdisciplinary study of relationships between [[law]], especially [[public law]], and [[religion]]. Voge Magazine reports that during the late 1900, a new law and religion approach emerged that progressively built its own contribution to religious studies.  Over a dozen scholarly organizations and committees were formed by 1983, and a scholarly quarterly, the [[Journal of Law and Religion]], was first published that year. The ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' began publication in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge University Press [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ecclesiastical-law-journal/all-issues]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Rutgers Journal of Law and Religion'' was founded in 1999.&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.lawandreligion.com/ its website] accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Oxford Journal of Law and Religion'' was founded in England in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;It also sponsors OJLR Summer Academy in Law and Religion 2014, at St Hugh's College, Oxford. see [http://ojlr.oxfordjournals.org/ its website], accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many departments and centers have been created around the world during the last decades. For example, the Brigham Young University law school in 2000 created  "The International Center for Law and Religion Studies." It has an international mission and its annual symposium (which began in 1993) has brought to campus over 1000 scholars, human rights activists, judges from supreme courts, and government ministers dealing with religious affairs from more than 120 countries.&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.iclrs.org/index.php?contentId=433&amp;linkId=156&amp;pageId=1  its website] accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of 2012, major law and religion organizations in the U.S. included  500 law professors, 450 political scientists, and specialists in numerous other fields such as history and religious studies. Between 1985 and 2010, the field saw the publication of some 750 books and 5000 scholarly articles, according to Emory Law Professor [[John Witte, Jr.]].&lt;ref&gt;John Witte, "The Study of Law and Religion in the United States: An Interim Report," ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' (2012) 14#3 pp: 327-354.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research topics==
Scholars in the field are not only focused on strictly legal issues about religious freedom or non establishment but also on the study of religions as they are qualified through judicial discourses or legal understanding on religious phenomena. For example, ''The Oxford Journal of Law and Religion'' seeks to cover:
:social, legal and political issues involving the relationship between law and religion in society; comparative law perspectives on the relationship between religion and state institutions; developments regarding human and constitutional rights to freedom of religion or belief; considerations of the relationship between religious and secular legal systems; empirical work on the place of religion in society; and other salient areas where law and religion interact (e.g., theology, legal and political theory, legal history, philosophy, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://ojlr.oxfordjournals.org/ its website], accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

Exponents look at canon law, natural law, and state law, often in comparative perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Doe, '' Law and Religion in Europe: A Comparative Introduction'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Cole Durham, and Brett G. Scharffs, eds. ''Law and religion: national, international, and comparative perspectives'' (Aspen Pub, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Specialists have explored themes in western history regarding Christianity and justice and mercy, rule and equity, discipline and love.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte Jr. and Frank S. Alexander, eds., ''Christianity and Law: An Introduction'' (Cambridge U.P. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  Common topics of interest include marriage and the family,&lt;ref&gt;John Witte Jr, ''From Sacrament to Contract: Marriage, Religion, and Law in the Western Tradition'' (1997) &lt;/ref&gt; and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte, Jr., ''The Reformation of Rights: Law, Religion and Human Rights in Early Modern Calvinism'' (2008) &lt;/ref&gt;  Moving beyond Christianity, scholars have looked at law and religion links in the Muslim Middle East,&lt;ref&gt;Ann Elizabeth Mayer, "Law and Religion in the Muslim Middle East," ''American Journal of Comparative Law'' (1987) 35#1 pp. 127-184 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/840165 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Asian ancestral religions, occult altercations, pagan Rome and any realm in which religious beliefs form the basis of or contradict governmental law.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Watson, ''The state, law, and religion: pagan Rome'' (University of Georgia Press, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Christianity, studies range from textual analysis of early Christians' relationship with Jewish Law, the effect of law on the Protestant Reformation, and modern day issues like homosexual unions, the ordination of women to the diaconate and priesthood, and consciences objectors to war.  

Important studies have appeared regarding [[secularization]].&lt;ref&gt;Silvio Ferrari, "Law and Religion in a Secular World: A European Perspective," ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' (2012) 14#3 pp 355-370.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Palomino, "Legal dimensions of secularism: challenges and problems," ''Contemporary Readings in Law and Social Justice'' (2012) vol 2 pp 208-225.&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular the issue of wearing religion symbols in public, such as headscarves that are banned in French schools, have received scholarly attention in the context of human rights and feminism.&lt;ref&gt;Karima Bennoune, "Secularism and human rights: A contextual analysis of headscarves, religious expression, and women's equality under international law," ''Columbia Journal of Transnational Law,'' 45 (2006): 367.&lt;/ref&gt;

==National studies==
===Thailand===
In Thailand, the constitutional monarchy that was established in the 1930s integrated traditional Buddhist concepts of cosmic law and religion with modern methods of public administration and legal authority. The result was the formation of a unique [[civic religion]] based on the three-way formula of nation, religion, and kingship. This new tradition has evolved and provides a framework for both the symbolic discourse as well as practical actions in modern Thai legal culture.&lt;ref&gt;Frank E. Reynolds, "Dhamma in Dispute: The Interactions of Religion and Law in Thailand," ''Law &amp; Society Review'' (1994) 28#3 pp 433-451&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5993">In [[Christianity]], there are a number of other words used to refer to a [[Christian]].

==In the New Testament==
===Christian===
The word "[[Christian]]" is used three times in the New Testament: {{bibleref2|Acts|11:26|9}}, {{bibleref2|Acts|26:28|9}}, and {{bibleref2|1pe|4:16|9|1 Peter 4:16}}. The original usage in all three New Testament verses reflects a derisive element in the term ''Christian'' to refer to followers of Christ who did not acknowledge the emperor of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wuest|first=Kenneth Samuel|title=Wuest's word studies from the Greek New Testament|year=1973|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZHhK3AKkc9EC|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disciple===
"[[Disciple (Christianity)|Disciple]]" (which means "learner") is common in the [[Gospels]] and [[Acts]], and is the "characteristic name for those who gathered around Jesus during his ministry".&lt;ref name=EDT234&gt;{{cite book|last=Rayburn|first=Robert S.|author-link=Robert S. Rayburn|title=[[Evangelical Dictionary of Theology]]|chapter=Christians, Names Of|year=2001|page=234|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yu846j61u0wC&amp;pg=PA234}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also frequently used in the Book of Acts but not in the [[New Testament]] epistles.

===Brother===
The term "brother" occurs in verses like {{bibleref2|Acts|18:27|9}}. The [[King James Version]] renders the plural form used here as "brethren", while modern English versions have "brothers" ([[ESV]]) or "brothers and sisters" ([[NIV]]). The term comes from the theological concept of [[Adoption (theology)|adoption]], which says that believers are made part of God's family, and become his children. The use of "brother" as a designation for Christians has become restricted to members of religious communities (the [[Brother (Catholic)|Catholic sense]]), or as an honorific for [[pastor]]s (often used in [[Baptist]] churches).

===Saint===
The [[Epistle to the Ephesians]] is written to the "[[saint]]s at Ephesus" ({{bibleref2|Ephesians|1:1|9}}). In the New Testament the word is used to refer to Christians generally, but [[Robert S. Rayburn]] notes that "the name survived as a general title for Christians only through the second century." Rayburn suggests that the "juxtaposition of sainthood and martyrdom" in {{bibleref2|Revelation|17:6|9}} may have resulted in the word becoming an "honorific title for [[Confessor of the Faith|confessors]], [[Christian martyrs|martyrs]] and [[ascetics]]."&lt;ref name=EDT236 /&gt; In Orthodox and Catholic teachings, all Christians in heaven are considered to be saints, but some are considered to be worthy of higher honor, emulation, or veneration, with official church recognition given to some saints through canonization or glorification.&lt;ref name=bebis&gt;Bebis G ''[http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith8044 The Saints of the Orthodox Church] at Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, New York&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cat2&gt;[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p123a9p5.htm Catechism of the Catholic Church (Second Edition)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Believer===
[[Belief in Jesus]] is a central aspect of Christianity. Rayburn notes that verses such as {{bibleref2|2 Cor|6:15|9|2 Corinthians 6:15}} "substantiate its technical use as a title for Christians".&lt;ref name=EDT236 /&gt;

===Follower of the Way===
In the [[Book of Acts]], Christianity is referred to as "The Way". The [[NIV]] renders Paul's words in Acts 24:14 as "I admit that I worship the God of our ancestors as a follower of the Way, which they call a sect." Rayburn suggests that this was a Christian self-designation, although it did not survive as a title.&lt;ref name=EDT236 /&gt;

===Friend===
Rayburn notes that the phrase "the friends" (''hoi philoi'') occurs in {{bibleref2|Acts|27:3|9}} and {{bibleref2|3 John|15|9}}, but that it is uncertain whether this means "Christians in general or merely actual acquaintances". Rayburn goes on to note that the designation was used by the [[Friends of God]] and the [[Religious Society of Friends]].&lt;ref name=EDT236&gt;{{cite book|last=Rayburn|first=Robert S.|author-link=Robert S. Rayburn|title=[[Evangelical Dictionary of Theology]]|chapter=Christians, Names Of|year=2001|page=236|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yu846j61u0wC&amp;pg=PA236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nazarene===
The title "[[Nazarene (title)|Nazarene]]" is used once in the New Testament to refer to Christians, in {{bibleref2|Acts|24:5|9}}, where [[Tertullus]] calls Paul "a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes". In rabbinical and contemporary [[Israel]]i [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], "''Notzrim''" is the general official term for "Christians.
===The Elect===
In Colossians 3:12 Paul calls Christians "The Elect"   Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering

==In later Christianity==
===Christ follower===
"Christ follower" (rather than "Christian") has become the preferred self-designation for many people associated with the [[emerging church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Short History of Global Evangelicalism|chapter=Localism and Transnationality: 1970s to 2010|first1=Mark|last1=Hutchinson|first2=John|last2=Wolffe|year=2012|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|page=269|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rz8K0h_d8RQC&amp;pg=PA269}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Messianic Jews===
Adherents of [[Messianic Judaism]] will generally call themselves "Messianic Jews" rather than "Christians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robinson|first1=Rich|title=The Messianic Movement: A Field Guide for Evangelical Christians|date=2005|publisher=[[Jews for Jesus]]|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hw3GPaR-m1IC&amp;pg=PA23|accessdate=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In world cultures, there have traditionally been many different groupings of religious belief. In [[Culture of India|Indian culture]], different religious philosophies were traditionally respected as academic differences in pursuit of the same truth. In [[Islam]], the [[Quran]] mentions three different categories: Muslims, the [[People of the Book]], and [[Idolatry|idol worship]]ers. Initially, Christians had a simple dichotomy of world beliefs: Christian civility versus foreign heresy or barbarity. In the 18th century, "[[heresy]]" was clarified to mean [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]];{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MwuUAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA62|title=Twentieth-Century Marxism: A Global Introduction|last=Glaser|first=Daryl|last2=Walker|first2=David M.|date=2007-09-12|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135979744|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[paganism]], this created a fourfold classification which spawned such works as [[John Toland]]'s ''Nazarenus, or Jewish, Gentile, and Mahometan Christianity'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/nazarenusorjewis00tola|title=Nazarenus, or, Jewish, gentile, and Mahometan Christianity : containing the history of the antient Gospel of Barnabas, and the modern Gospel of the Mahometans ... also the original plan of Christianity explain'd in the history of the Nazarens ... with the relation of an Irish manuscript of the four Gospels, as likewise a summary of the antient Irish Christianity|last=Toland|first=John|last2=La Monnoye|first2=Bernard de|date=1718-01-01|publisher=London : J. Brotherton, J. Roberts and A. Dodd}}&lt;/ref&gt; which represented the three [[Abrahamic religions]] as different "nations" or sects within ''religion'' itself, the "true [[monotheism]]."

[[Daniel Defoe]] described the original definition as follows: "Religion is properly the Worship given to God, but 'tis also applied to the Worship of Idols and false Deities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Quu3VvTFnnAC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=Religion+is+properly+the+Worship+given+to+God,+but+'tis+also+applied+to+the+Worship+of+Idols+and+false+Deities#v=onepage&amp;q=Religion%20is%20properly%20the%20Worship%20given%20to%20God,%20but%20'tis%20also%20applied%20to%20the%20Worship%20of%20Idols%20and%20false%20Deities&amp;f=false|title=The Invention of World Religions: Or, How European Universalism Was Preserved in the Language of Pluralism|last=Masuzawa|first=Tomoko|date=2012-04-26|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226922621|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the 19th century, in between 1780 and 1810, the language dramatically changed: instead of "religion" being synonymous with spirituality, authors began using the plural, "religions," to refer to both Christianity and other forms of worship. Therefore, [[Hannah Adams]]'s early encyclopedia, for example, had its name changed from ''An Alphabetical Compendium of the Various Sects...'' to ''A Dictionary of All Religions and Religious Denominations''.&lt;ref&gt;Masuzawa 2005. pp. 49–61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Quu3VvTFnnAC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=Religion+is+properly+the+Worship+given+to+God,+but+'tis+also+applied+to+the+Worship+of+Idols+and+false+Deities#v=onepage&amp;q=hannah%20adams&amp;f=false|title=The Invention of World Religions: Or, How European Universalism Was Preserved in the Language of Pluralism|last=Masuzawa|first=Tomoko|date=2012-04-26|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226922621|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1838, the four-way division of Christianity, Judaism, [[Mohammedan|Mahommedan]]ism (archaic terminology for [[Islam]]) and Paganism was multiplied considerably by [[Josiah Conder (editor and author)|Josiah Conder]]'s ''Analytical and Comparative View of All Religions Now Extant among Mankind''. Conder's work still adhered to the four-way classification, but in his eye for detail he puts together much historical work to create something resembling our modern Western image: he includes [[Druze]], [[Yazidi|Yezidi]]s, [[Mandaeism|Mandeans]], and [[Elam]]ites{{Clarify|date=April 2012|reason=What does he mean by that?

The modern meaning of the phrase "world religion," putting non-Christians at the same level as Christians, began with the 1893 [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] in [[Chicago]]. The Parliament spurred the creation of a dozen privately funded lectures with the intent of informing people of the diversity of religious experience: these lectures funded researchers such as [[William James]], [[D. T. Suzuki]], and [[Alan Watts]], who greatly influenced the public conception of world religions.&lt;ref&gt;Masuzawa 2005, 270–281&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter half of the 20th century, the category of "world religion" fell into serious question, especially for drawing parallels between vastly different cultures, and thereby creating an arbitrary separation between the religious and the secular.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen R. L. Clark. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20019386 "World Religions and World Orders"]. ''[[Religious Studies (journal)|Religious studies]]'' 26.1 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; Even history professors have now taken note of these complications and advise against teaching "world religions" in schools.&lt;ref&gt;Joel E. Tishken. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/495028 "Ethnic vs. Evangelical Religions: Beyond Teaching the World Religion Approach"]. ''The History Teacher'' 33.3 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Others see the shaping of religions in the context of the nation-state as the "[[invented traditions|invention of traditions]]."

==Religious demographics==
{{Further information|List of religious populations}}
{{Main category|Religious demographics}}

One way to define a major religion is by the number of current adherents. The population numbers by religion are computed by a combination of census reports and population surveys (in countries where religion data is not collected in census, for example the United States or France), but results can vary widely depending on the way questions are phrased, the definitions of religion used and the bias of the agencies or organizations conducting the survey. Informal or unorganized religions are especially difficult to count.

There is no consensus among researchers as to the best methodology for determining the religiosity profile of the world's population. A number of fundamental aspects are unresolved:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4090">'''Material religion''' is a framework used by [[Religious studies|scholars of religion]] examining the interaction between [[religion]] and [[material culture]]. Its specific focus is on the place of objects, images, spaces, and buildings in religious communities.

Some scholars within the study of religion have criticised the material religion approach for often seeking to reintroduce the [[phenomenology of religion]] into the discipline.

==Definition==
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=Religion, being a prime human activity throughout history, is rooted in the body and in its sensual relations with the world. It always has been and always will be. We can make sense out of the senses. This is the first true thing we can say about religion, because it is also the first true thing we can say about being human. We are sentient beings, and religion is sensuous.|source=— Scholar of religion S. Brent Plate, 2014{{sfn|Plate|2014|p=7}} }}

The scholar of religion S. Brent Plate was of the view that "religion must be understood as deriving from rudimentary human experiences, from lived, embodied practices".{{sfn|Plate|2014|p=15}} He stated that "to learn about religion we have to come to our senses. Literally. We have to begin to discover... that we cannot know the worlds of any other culture, let alone our own, unless we get inside the sensational operations of human bodies."{{sfn|Plate|2014|p=8}}

==History==

The material religion framework has been promoted by the scholars such as Birgit Meyer, Sally Promey, S. Brent Plate, David Morgan, etc.

In 2005, the peer-reviewed journal ''Material Religion: The Journal of Objects, Art and Belief'' was launched. In their editorial statement, the editors described it as "a new project in the study of religious images, objects, spaces, and material practices."{{sfn|Editors|2005|p=5}}

==Criticism==
The anthropologist [[Simon Coleman (anthropologist)|Simon Coleman]] suggested that the term "material religion" was [[tautology (grammar)|tautological]], in that "religion is inherently material in its very constitution."{{sfn|Coleman|2009|p=360}}

The scholars of religion Christopher R. Cotter and David G. Robertson suggested that the material religion framework could be an alternative means to explore religion, in contrast to the dominant [[world religions]] paradigm which they regarded as problematic.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016|pp=12–13}} They nevertheless thought that material religion represented "phenomenology by stealth".{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016|p=13}}

&lt;!--Please only include examples of miraculous births in faith-based, legendary, or mythological traditions. Do NOT include births of non-spiritual figures.--&gt;

Stories of '''miraculous births''' often include conceptions by [[miracle|miraculous]] circumstances and features such as intervention by a [[deity]], [[supernatural]] elements, [[Astronomy|astronomical]] signs, hardship or, in the case of some mythologies, complex plots related to creation.

==Near Eastern mythology==
The [[Assyria]]n and [[Babylonia]]n concept of origins expressed procreation first in “relationships between gods and goddesses resulting in other gods and goddesses," such as [[Ea (Babylonian god)|Ea]] and [[Damkina]] assisted by [[Apsu]] giving birth to [[Marduk]]. The [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''[[Enûma Eliš]]'' describes the birth of Marduk as follows: "Ea, having overheard the plan of the primordial deities to destroy the other gods, deceived [[Apsu]] and [[Mummu]] and put them to death. 'Ea, his triumph over his enemies secured, in his sacred chamber in profound peace he rested.' (ANET, p.&amp;nbsp;61, lines 74—75.)  Then he took over the place which Apsu had used for his cult and dwelt there with his spouse, Damkina." It was here that Marduk, the "most potent and wisest of gods" was created in the heart of Apsu and "He who begot him was Ea, his father, she who conceived him was Damkina, his mother".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/mesopotamian/enuma.html |title=Enuma Elish, The Sumerian Epic of Creation |publisher=Ancienttexts.org |date=2001-06-07 |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Norman Lockyer]], Ea, Ia, or [[Oannes (mythology)|Oannes]] was the primal god of Babylon. He was a ‘Great God, Maker of Men, Potter, Artist and Workman.’  He formed a Triad with [[Anu]] and [[Bil]]—the two poles of heaven and the equator.&lt;ref name="Lockyer, Norman, Sir"&gt;Lockyer, Norman, The dawn of astronomy : a study of temple worship and mythology of the ancient Egyptians. With a preface by Giorgio de Santillana, Mineola, NY. : Dover Publications, Inc., 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Oannes first appeared from the sea to teach the Babylonians the art of writing, sciences and crafts, the building of cities, the surveying of land, the observation of the stars, and the sowing and harvesting of all kinds of grains and plants.  He was believed to have been "reincarnated" several times.  [[Berossos]], priest of the Temple of [[Bel (god)|Bel]], in Babylon, knew of as many as six such reincarnations.&lt;ref name="Eisler, Robert"&gt;Orpheus the fisher; comparative studies in Orphic and early Christian cult symbolism, J. M. Watkins, London, 1921&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, “procreative deities, either male or female, played a part in the birth of other deities or great personages, such as the [[Ugaritic]] tradition of Lady [[Asherah]], ‘the Progenitress of the gods’; [[Mami (goddess)|Mami]], 'the Mother-womb, the one who creates mankind'; Father [[Sin (mythology)|Nanna]], the 'begetter of gods and men'; the Assyrian traditions that Tukulti-Urta was created by the gods in the womb of his mother and that [[Sennacherib]]'s birth was assisted by Ea, who provided a 'spacious womb', and [[Assur]], 'the god, my begetter'; and the North Arabian myth of the mother goddess who was responsible for [[Dusares]]."&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"&gt;Boslooper, Thomas, The Virgin Birth, The Westminster Press, Library of Congress Catalog Card No. 62-7941.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hittite mythology]], the god [[Anu]] was overthrown by his son [[Kumarbi]];&lt;ref name=Puhvel1987&gt;{{cite book|last=Puhvel|first=Jaan|authorlink=Jaan Puhvel|title=Comparative Mythology|date=1987|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, Maryland|isbn=0-8018-3938-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleman|first1=J.

{{Further|Myth of Osiris and Isis|Horus}}
[[File:Abydos Tempelrelief Sethos I. 36.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Isis, in the form of a bird, copulates with the deceased Osiris. At either side are Horus, although he is as yet unborn, and Isis in human form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1-last=Meeks|author1-first=Dimitri|author2-last=Favard-Meeks|author2-first=Christine|others=Translated by G. M. Goshgarian|title=Daily Life of the Egyptian Gods|publisher=Cornell University Press| year=1996|origyear=1993|isbn=978-0-8014-8248-9|page=37|ref=harv}}
&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The belief in the conception of [[Horus]] by [[Isis]] is traced to the beginning of Egyptian history.  Horus' conception and birth were understood in terms of the Egyptian doctrine of [[parthenogenesis]], which was connected with the goddess Neith of Sais. (page 220)&lt;ref name="Budge, E. A. Wallis"&gt;[[Budge, E. A. Wallis]], ''The Gods of the Egyptians'', II, Dover Publications, New York, 1904&lt;/ref&gt;  In Upper Egypt, Net was worshipped at Seni and represented with the head of a lioness painted green, with the titles: "Father of fathers and Mother of mothers," and "net-Menhit, the great lady, lady of the south, the great cow who gave birth to the sun, who made the germ of gods and men, the mother of [[Ra]], who raised up [[Atum|Tem]] in primeval time, who existed when nothing else had being, and who created that which exists after she had come into being."(page 150)&lt;ref name="Erman, Adolf"&gt;Erman, Adolf, The Literature of the Ancient Egyptians, B. Blom, New York, 1971, 1927&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Many of the attributes of Isis, the God-mother, the mother of Horus; and of [[Neith]], the goddess of [[Sais]] are identical with those of Mary the Mother of Christ." (page 161)&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt;  Early Christian stories in the [[Apocrypha]]l Gospels, which record the wanderings of the Virgin and Child in Egypt are similar to stories found on the [[Metternich Stela]] texts about the life of Isis. (page 161)&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt; Also, the pictures and sculptures of Isis suckling her child Horus are the foundation for Christian figurines and paintings of the Madonna and Child.  Of course, the legend of the birth of Horus has many elements not found even in the Apocryphal Gospels.  Egyptian texts mention numerous forms of Horus.  In one he is "Heru-sa Ast, sa-Asar, or Horus, son of Isis, son of [[Osiris]]."  Isis is described in the Hymn to Osiris, as finding and restoring the body of her dead husband, and using magical words given her by [[Thoth]] to restore him to life.  Then, by uniting with Osiris she conceives Horus.  Horus represented the rising sun and in this respect was comparable to the Greek [[Apollo]].&lt;ref name="hammerwood.mistral.com.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hammerwood.mistral.co.uk/apollo.htm |title=Apollo. Hammerwood. Parthenon. Borghese Vase Plaques. Dionysus. Python. Egyptian Horus. Isis. Ra. Amon. Set. Helios. Delphi. Prophecy. Know Thyself. Delphic Oracle. National Curriculum: Ancient Greece, Greeks |publisher=Hammerwood.mistral.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There were at least fifteen other Horuses in the Egyptian pantheon,&lt;ref name="egyptianmyths.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptianmyths.net/horus.htm |title=Ancient Egypt: the Mythology - Horus |publisher=Egyptianmyths.net |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; so in the story of Isis and Osiris Horus is "sometimes known as Harsiesis, to distinguish him from the others.  He is depicted as a falcon, or with a falcon's head.  He eventually avenged Osiris' death and reclaimed the throne, ruling peacefully...Herakhty, or 'Horus of the Horizon', was a sun god who rose each morning on the eastern horizon.  He was often identified with the sun god, Ra, and was eventually absorbed by him, forming Ra-Herakhty."&lt;ref name="egyptianmyths.net"/&gt;

Lineal descent from Ra, whether by birth or by marriage, was claimed by all kings of Egypt at least since User-ka-f, first king of the V Dynasty, who was high priest of Ra at [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]].  An important part of this tradition was the legend of the God Re generating with the wife of a priest.  "The newborn child was regarded as a god incarnate, and later with appropriate ceremonies he was presented to [[Ra|Re]] or Amen-Re, in his temple, where the god accepted it and acknowledged it to be his child."  This tradition was later inscribed in a stereotyped form in temple reliefs.&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt;

Many texts mention different attributes of Isis.  These were combined into a single narrative by [[Plutarch]] in the 1st century AD. In her aspect of protector of Egypt and its people, Isis is depicted with huge outspread wings.  She taught women to grind corn, to spin and to weave, and she taught the people how to cure illnesses. She instituted the rite of marriage.  When her consort, Osiris, left Egypt to travel the world, Isis ruled the country in his absence.  "The [[hieroglyph]] for her name is the image of a throne, and her lap came to be seen as the throne of Egypt.  Because of her fame Isis eventually absorbed the qualities of almost all the other goddesses; "she was a great mother goddess, a bird goddess, a goddess of the underworld who brought life to the dead, and a goddess of the primeval waters...Her following spread beyond Egypt to Greece and throughout the Roman Empire...(lasting) from before 3000 BC until well into Christian times.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.roman-empire.net/religion/isis.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unrv.com/culture/isis.php&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pharaohs===
{{Further|Stories of divine birth in the eighteenth dynasty}}
There is a myth on the birth of [[Hatshepsut]]. In this myth, [[Amun]] goes to [[Queen Ahmose]] in the form of the Pharaoh [[Thutmose I]] and awakens her with pleasant odors. At this point Amun places the ''[[ankh]]'', a symbol of life, to Ahmose's nose, and Hatshepsut is conceived by Ahmose.&lt;ref&gt;Gay Robins, ''Women in Ancient Egypt'', Harvard University Press, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Another myth on divine birth concerns [[Amenhotep III]]: he is conceived by [[Amun]] which has gone to queen [[Mutemwiya]] in form of [[Thutmosis IV]].&lt;ref&gt;O' Connor, David and Cline, Eric H.: ''Amenhotep III:Perspectives of his reign'', University of Michigan Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tyldesley, Joyce: ''Chronicle of the Queens of Egypt'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
In the Hebrew Bible, and in later Jewish tradition there are stories of matriarchs giving birth where the God of Israel miraculously intervenes. For example, within the Rabbinic literature expansions were made on the birth of the matriarch [[Sarah]] on the earlier Old Testament traditions.

===Isaac===
{{Main|Isaac|Sarah}}
[[File:Abraham renvoyant Agar.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''Banishment of Hagar'', Etching. À Paris chez Fr. Fanet, Éditeur, Rue des Saints Pères n° 10. 18th century. Sarah is seen on the left side, looking]]
Due to her old age, Sarai was infertile, but a miracle was vouchsafed to her ([[Genesis Rabbah]] xlvii. 3) after her name was changed from "Sarai" to "Sarah" (R. H. 16b). When her youth had been restored and she had given birth to [[Isaac]] the people would not believe in the miracle, saying that the patriarch and his wife had adopted a foundling and pretended that it was their own son. Abraham thereupon invited all the notables to a banquet on the day when Isaac was to be weaned. Sarah invited the women, who brought their infants with them, and on this occasion she gave milk from her breasts to all the children, thus convincing the guests of the miracle (B. M. 87a; comp. Gen. R. liii. 13).

According to [[Isaiah 7:14]], around 735 BC King [[Ahaz]] of Judah received a message from the prophet [[Isaiah]] during the [[Syro-Ephraimite War]] with Aram (Syria) and Israel, "Therefore, the Lord, of His own, shall give you a sign; behold, the young woman is with child, and she shall bear a son, and she shall call his name Immanuel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15938/showrashi/true |title=Yeshayahu - Chapter 7 - Texts &amp; Writings |publisher=Chabad.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is generally taken by Judaic commentators to be a reference to the non-miraculous birth of [[Hezekiah]] or another contemporary child, as indicated in Isaiah's following indication of the timing.

The Greek [[Septuagint]] and some later Christian translations, following the application of Isaiah 7 in Matthew 1, use the word "virgin". The Hebrew word ''alma'' actually translates as a young woman of childbearing age who had not yet given birth and who might or might not be a virgin, whereas the Hebrew ''betulah'', used elsewhere in Isaiah, is the word that means "virgin." If the reference is to Ahaz's betrothed, [[Abijah (queen)|Abi]], daughter of the [[High Priest]], no miraculous birth is implied, merely chastity. The Christian world believes that the verse is a messianic prediction of the miraculous birth of Jesus, as described in various gospels of the New Testament of the Bible.

===Melchizedek===
The [[Second Book of Enoch]] contains a section, called ''Exaltation of Melchizedek'', which says that [[Melchizedek]] was born of a virgin, Sofonim (or Sopanima), the wife of Nir, a brother of [[Noah]]. The child came out from his mother after she had died and sat on the bed beside her corpse, already physically developed, clothed, speaking and blessing the Lord, and marked with the badge of priesthood. Forty days later, Melchizedek was taken by the archangel [[Gabriel]] ([[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] in some manuscripts) to the [[Garden of Eden]] and was thus preserved from the [[Deluge myth|Deluge]] without having to be in [[Noah's Ark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ueberallesdownload.com/enoch7.html |title=THE SECOND BOOK OF ENOCH - Page 7 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2010-01-29 |accessdate=2015-02-24 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129084437/http://www.ueberallesdownload.com/enoch7.html |archivedate=January 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Book of the Secrets of Enoch| author= Morfill, W R (translator)| url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/3678772/The-Book-of-the-Secrets-of-Enoch-WR-Morfill  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zoroaster==
{{Further|Zoroastrianism|Zoroaster}}
Zoroaster’s name has been adopted from the Greek and [[Latin]] Zoroastres.  The ancient form of his name in the Avesta is [[Zarathustra]].  His native country was probably [[Median Empire|Media]] in Western Iran, (possibly in modern [[Azerbaijan]]), but his ministry took place in eastern Iran, especially in the region of [[Bactria]], about 1200 BC. [[Zoroaster]] was originally a Magian priest, and under the reforms he instituted, Mithra became one of the [[Yazata]]s (Worshipful Ones), the angels or lesser divine beings.

"It was said that (Zoroaster's) birth was foretold from the beginning of time, and that the moment he was born, he burst out laughing and the whole universe rejoiced with him."  After his birth evil demons tried to destroy him, but with Ahura Mazda's protection, he survived all attempts on his life.&lt;ref name="Storm, Rachel"/&gt;  The Zoroastrian tradition differs from the Christian one because the divine only assists in the preservation of [[Zoroaster]]’s seed.  "The central scripture, the [[Avesta]] and also the Pahlavi texts include the tradition that the 'kingly glory' is handed onward from ruler to ruler and from saint to saint for the purpose of illuminating ultimately the soul of the Zarathushtra."  Also the scriptures clearly allude to conjugal relations between his parents, during which evil spirits try to prevent his conception.&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt;  But according to later tradition, Zoroaster's mother, Dughdova, was a virgin when she conceived Zoroaster by a shaft of light.&lt;ref name="Storm, Rachel"&gt;Egyptian mythology, Lorenz, London, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greco-Roman and Hellenistic mythology==
===Gods===
[[File:René-Antoine Houasse - Minerva.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''The Birth of [[Minerva]]'' by [[René-Antoine Houasse]] (before 1688)]]

[[Greco-Roman]] and [[Hellenistic]] literature is rich in the tradition of birth among the gods. In his poem ''[[Theogony]]'', the Greek poet [[Hesiod]] tells a story that Zeus had once lain with the goddess [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]], impregnating her, but, fearing that she might bear a child mightier than he himself, he swallowed her.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Theogony'' 886&lt;/ref&gt; Their daughter [[Athena]] was born fully grown from Zeus's forehead, fully armed and clad in armor.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Theogony'' 929a&lt;/ref&gt; Hesiod also relates that the goddess [[Aphrodite]] was born from the foam of the sea after [[Ouranos]]'s castrated testicles were thrown into it.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Theogony'' 176&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Helios]] was a child of Zeus by [[Euryphaessa]].  He was also called "the son of Earth and starry Heaven," and the son of [[Hyperion (mythology)|Hyperion]]. [[Dionysus]] was dithyrambus, "he who entered life by a double door." His first birth took place prematurely. His mother, Semele, died when Zeus appeared to her in a flash of lightning, and so Zeus opened his own flesh and enclosed the infant.  In time, Dionysus was born "perfect" from Zeus' thigh.  Dionysus [[Zagreus]] was important in Orphic theology. In Protrepticus ii. 14 ff. by Clement of Alexandria, this child had the form of a bull.  Zeus intended to make him the ruler of the universe but the jealous Titans lured the child away, tore him to pieces, cooked him and ate him.  Athena preserved his heart, however, which Zeus swallowed.  According to Boslooper, Clement omitted one part of the myth that forms a connection between his account and the Theban legend of Dionysus.  Because Zeus swallowed the heart of Dionysus Zagreus, when Semele bore Dionysus the new god was Zagreus reborn.&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt;

===Mithra and Mithras===
{{Main|Mithras|Mithra|Mitra}}
[[File:MithrasIMG 5339.JPG|thumb|right|325px|Roman statue showing Mithras born from the rock from the Diocletian Baths Museum]]

In Indian mythology, [[Mithra]] is known as Mitra.  He was originally a god of contracts and friendship and was a forerunner of the Graeco-Roman god [[Mithras]].  In [[Iran]], he developed into the protector of truth.  Before the time of Zoroaster, he was associated with [[Ahura Mazda]], the principle of good. As a consequence of Zoroaster's reforms to Iranian religion, Mithra was ousted from power and Ahura Mazda became supreme.&lt;ref name="Storm, Rachel"/&gt;  In the more ancient Indian [[Vedas]] Mithra was the god of light, invoked under the name of [[Varuna]], and was called "the Light of the World." He was the mediator between heaven and Earth.

"The light bursting from the heavens, which were conceived as a solid vault, became, in the mythology of the [[Magi]], Mithra born from the rock."&lt;ref name="Boerie, C. George, Dr."&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/romanempire.html |title=The Roman Empire |publisher=Webspace.ship.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mithraism absorbed [[astrology]] from the [[Babylon|Chaldeans]] after the Chaldean conquest, and continued as an astronomical religion.  In the Hellenistic period it took on its final form.  Mithra was assimilated into [[Graeco-Roman]] beliefs in the 1st century BC as Mithras.  He was an ancient and highly honored god of [[Roman mythology|Roman]] Paganism, where he was worshipped for more than 300 years as "the soldier's god."&lt;ref name="Newadvent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10402a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Mithraism |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1911-10-01 |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mythological heroes===
[[File:Danae gold shower Louvre CA925.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Ancient [[Boeotia]]n [[bell-krater]] showing Zeus impregnating [[Danaë]] in the form of a shower of gold, circa 450-425 BC]]

The love of a god for a mortal, resulting in the birth of a hero, is one notable deviation from the tradition of the origin of gods. The legend of [[Perseus]], whose mother conceived him when [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] came to her in the form of a golden shower, is one example of this type (cf. Ovid, Metamorphoses, Book IV).  The ''[[Greek Anthology]]'' has the following: [[Zeus]], turned to gold, piercing the brazen chamber of Danae, cut the knot of intact virginity.

Heroes created by generation of a god with a mortal include [[Ion (play)|Ion]] by Apollo and [[Creusa]], [[Romulus]] by Mars and Aemila, [[Asclepius]] by Apollo and [[Coronis (Greek mythology)|Coronis]], and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] by Zeus and [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]].   [[Plutarch]] records how Theseus and [[Romulus]] were both born out of wedlock and of uncertain parentage and at the same time had the reputation of being sprung from the gods.  He said that Theseus' grandfather [[Pittheus]] invented the story that Theseus was the child of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] to conceal Theseus' lineage as the son of Pittheus' daughter [[Aethra (Greek mythology)|Aethra]] and [[Aegeus]] ("Lives", Vol. 1, p.&amp;nbsp;2; pp.&amp;nbsp;3 ff.).  But there were other stories about the birth of Romulus and his brother Remus.  The story of Romulus' divine origin says that his mother was the mortal daughter of Aeneas and Lavinia, and his father was Mars.

In his "Hymn to Asclepius", [[Homer]] attributes his origin to the god Apollo and the daughter of a renowned soldier, King Phlegyas.  As the divine patron of the healing art, [[Asclepius]] became the most popular of the hero gods of Greece.  The belief that religion was concerned with sickness and disease was central to his cult.  His sanctuaries in the Greco-Roman world became so famous there was a movement to make him a god of the first rank and identify him with Zeus himself.  Asclepius was "the one who leads and controls all things, the savior of the whole world, and the guardian of mortals."

Helen of Troy was worshiped as a heroine in several parts of the ancient world during the early historical epoch.  [[Euripides]]' play "Helen" depends on a tradition begun in the early 6th century B.C. by the Greek poet Stesichorus that Helen was the daughter of Zeus (who took the form of a swan) and Leda.  But this might simply be a poetic way of saying that she was hatched from an egg.

There are two versions of the birth of [[Oedipus]].  He was given a semidivine status in [[Sophocles]]' "Oedipus the King," where he was said to be the son of either [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], Loxias, "or the Bacchants' god, dweller on the hilltops ..." and one of the nymphs of Helicon.  But in Euripides' "Phoenissae," his mother, Jocasta, says Oedupus is the son of Laius, a mortal, who was warned by the god Phoebus not to have children.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"King of Thebes for horses famed! seek not to beget children against the will of heaven; for if thou beget a son, that child will slay thee, and all thy house shall wade in blood."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Laius ignored the warning, but after the child was born he gave him to shepherds to expose on Mount Cithaeron.  The child was found and raised among the keepers of the horses of Polybus.  As a grown man, Oedipus did indeed kill his father, not realizing who he was, and then married his mother.  When he discovered the truth he blinded himself.  In this story, he is clearly considered to be the son of Laius and Jocasta.  This is also obvious in Sophocles' "Oedipus the King".&lt;ref name="Eds. Oates and O'Neill"&gt;The Complete Greek Drama, Eds. Oates and O'Neill, Vol. 1, p. 409, Random House, New York, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Boslooper, "The two passages indicate that in the Greek mind the thoughts of divine and human paternal participation in conception were not mutually exclusive."&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;178)

[[File:Mignard - The Shepherd Faustulus Bringing Romulus and Remus to His Wife.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''The Shepherd Faustulus Bringing Romulus and Remus to His Wife'' by [[Nicolas Mignard]] (1654)]]

[[Romulus and Remus]], the legendary twin founders of the city of [[Rome]], were said to have been born to a [[Vestal Virgin]], [[Rhea Silvia]].  Rhea Silvia had been forced to become a Vestal Virgin against her will and claimed to have been impregnated through divine intervention.  [[Livy]] attests that she was instead raped by an unknown man.  In any case [[Amulius|King Amulius]] ordered the twins to be drowned as death through the elements would not trigger divine punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Romulus_and_Remus/|title=Romulus and Remus|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical figures===
Alexander, the Ptolemies, and the Caesars were said by some scholars to have been "virgin-born."  [[Alexander the Great]], " journeyed to the Oasis of Amon in order that he might be recognized as the god’s son and thus become a legitimate and recognized king of Egypt.  Inscriptions show that he and the [[Ptolemies]] after him had the incidents of their birth regularly depicted in temple reliefs.”&lt;ref name="Breasted"&gt;Breasted, Ancient Records of Egypt, Vol. 2, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; (As cited by Boslooper)  Norden calls this the Hellenistic virgin motif.  However, evidence shows that Alexander must have had a double tradition of origin.  It is recorded that "Alexander the Great and Augustus are deemed to have been conceived of a serpent god, and they claimed between them [[Phoebus]] and [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] as their progenitors."&lt;ref name="Sidonius Apollinaris"&gt;Sidonius Apollinaris, Carmina II, 121, Testimonies 289 in Asclepius, E. J. and Ludwig Edelstein (1945)&lt;/ref&gt;

“The Emperor [[Augustus]] was praised as the Savior of the world …[but] the idea of Savior was not unique or original with Augustus himself.  Before him the same title was given to [[Seleucid]] and other Hellenistic kings.  Throughout this period there were frequent longings for a savior from the present troubles.”  Augustus was said to have had a miraculous birth and a childhood filled with many portents and signs.  A few months before he was born a portent was observed at Rome which gave warning that nature was pregnant with a king for the Roman People.  "Thereupon the Senate in consternation decreed that no male child born that year should be reared; but those whose wives were with child saw to it that the decree was not filed in the treasury, since each one appropriated the prediction to his own family."  Boslooper relates several additional stories.  In one, Suetonius narrates what he learned from Asclepias of Mendes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"When Atia had come in the middle of the night to the solemn service of Apollo, she had her litter set down in the temple and fell asleep, while the rest of the matrons also slept.  On a sudden a serpent glided up to her and shortly went away.  When she awoke, she purified herself, as if after the embraces of her husband, and at once there appeared on her body a mark in colors like a serpent, and she could never get rid of it; so that presently she ceased ever to go to the public baths.  In the tenth month after that Augustus was born and was therefore regarded as the son of Apollo.  Atia too, before she gave him birth, dreamed that her vitals were borne up to the stars and spread over the whole extent of land and sea, while Octavius dreamed that the sun rose from Atia's womb."&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt; (p. 180)&lt;/blockquote&gt;The hope for a savior was expressed in [[Virgil]]’s “Fourth Eclogue".  The Church fathers later claimed this was a reference to Jesus Christ, however, the poem was dedicated to Pollio, one of the great influential men at the time of the civil wars and Virgil's patron and friend.  The hero of the poem is a child born or to be born in 40 B.C., at the time of Pollio's consulate.  A new era was expected, in fulfillment of an older oracle.&lt;blockquote&gt;"... Now the last age by Cumae's Sibyl sung

Has come and gone, and the majestic roll

Of circling centuries begins anew:

Justice returns, returns old Saturn's reign,

With a new breed of men sent down from heaven.

Only do thou, at the boy's birth in whom

The iron shall cease, the golden race arise,

Befriend him, chaste Lucina; 'tis thine own

Apollo reigns ...

"For thee, O boy,

First shall the earth, untilled, pour freely forth

Her childish gifts, the gadding ivy-spray

With foxglove and Egyptian bean-flower mixed,

And laughing-eyed acanthus. Of themselves,

Untended, will the she-goats then bring home

Their udders swollen with milk, while flocks afield

Shall of the monstrous lion have no fear..."&lt;ref name="classics.mit.edu"&gt;

==Hinduism==
{{Main|Hinduism}}
In the story of [[Krishna]] the deity is the agent of conception and also the offspring.  Because of his sympathy for the earth, the divine [[Vishnu]] himself descended into the womb of [[Devaki]] and was born as her son, Krishna. The Hindu Vishnu Purana relates: "Devaki bore in her womb the lotus-eyed deity...before the birth of Krishna, no one “could bear to gaze upon Devaki, from the light that invested her, and those who contemplated her radiance felt their minds disturbed.” This reference to light is reminiscent of the Vedic hymn "To an Unknown God," which refers to a Golden Child.  According to F. M. Müller this term means "the golden germ of child" and is an attempt at naming the sun.&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt;

This is  occasionally brought up as evidence for the hypothesis that "virgin birth" tales are a fairly common phenomenon in non-Christian religions around the world.&lt;ref name="Hitchens, Christopher"&gt;Christopher Hitchens, God is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything (Paperback), 2007, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen, Chapman"&gt;Chapman Cohen, Essays in Freethinking, 1927, "Monism and Religion"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Joseph, Peter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vimeo.com/13726978 |title=Private Video on Vimeo |publisher=Vimeo.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is nothing in Hindu scriptures to suggest that it was a "virgin" birth. By the time of conception and birth of Krishna, Devaki was married to [[Vasudeva]] and had already borne seven children.&lt;ref name="Vishnu Puran"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Vishnupurana-English-MnDutt#page/n307/mode/2up/search/devaki |title=VishnuPurana - English - MN Dutt |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some Hindus believe that when the emanations of the Supreme Being are [[pratyaksha]], or obvious to the sight, they become sacara, or embodied. Krishna was such an embodiment and usually bore a human form. In that mode of appearance the deities are generally supposed to be born of a woman, but without any carnal intercourse. This belief is not adhered to by those who follow the Purva Mimansa, or the philosophy of Jaimini. They insist that the Devas were mere mortals whom the Supreme Being endowed with qualities similar to his own. In general, the Hindus perform acts of worship to some of their ancient monarchs and sages, who were deified on account of their eminent virtues.&lt;ref name="On Egypt and the Nile"&gt;Wilford, On Egypt and the Nile, Asiatic Researches, Vol. III p. 374&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
{{Main|Buddha#Conception and birth}}
[[File:Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita Queen Maya Birth.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Maya (mother of the Buddha)|Māyā]] miraculously giving birth to Siddhārtha. [[Sanskrit]], [[palm-leaf manuscript]]. [[Nalanda|Nālandā]], [[Bihar]], India. [[Pala Empire|Pāla period]]]]

The stories of Buddha’s unusual birth developed through the centuries. Two accounts cited by Boslooper tell of the descent of the future Bodhisattva from the "Tusita Body" into the mother’s womb, the appearance of the [[Buddha]] in the mother as a shining gem, and the accompanying wonders in the natural world.  These are the Majjhima-Nikāya, 123 Acchariyabbhutadhammasuta III. 119-124; (I. B. Horner, 1959, pp.&amp;nbsp;164–169); and Māhapadānasutta, Dīgha ii. 12.&lt;ref name="Davids, T. W. rhys"&gt;Davids, T. W. Rhys, Dialogues of the Buddha, Part II, Sacred Books of the Buddhists, Vol. III (1910), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Mahapadana-sutra, Digha ii. 12, is the description of the incarnation of the [[Vipassī Buddha]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Now Vipassi, brethren, when, as Bodhisat, he ceased to belong to the hosts of the heaven of Delight, descended into his mother’s womb mindful and self-possessed."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to this text, the [[Vipassī Buddha]] was the first of six incarnations to precede [[Gautama Buddha|Gautama]]. The others listed are [[Sikhī Buddha|Sikhī]], [[Vessabhū Buddha|Vessabhū]], [[Kakusandha Buddha|Kakusandha]], [[Koṇāgamana Buddha|Koṇāgamana]], and [[Kassapa Buddha|Kassapa]]. The most popular legendary account of the birth of Buddha is in the Nidanakatha Jataka (see, [[Jataka tales]]) which accounted for the lives of Buddha in previous incarnations.  In this account, the “Great Being” chose the time and place of his birth, the tribe into which he would be born, and who his mother would be.  In the time chosen by him, Maya, his mother, fell asleep and dreamed that four archangels carried her to the [[Himalayan Mountains]] where their queens bathed and dressed her.  In her dream the Great Being soon entered her womb from her side, in the form of a white elephant. When she woke, she told her dream to the Raja, who summoned sixty-four eminent [[Brahman]]s to interpret it.

"Then is described how at his birth he took seven great steps and at the seventh he shouted, 'I am the chief of the world,' how he at birth held in his hand some medicine that became for him the drug by which he later healed the sick and blind and deaf, how at birth he wished to give a gift but was presented one himself by his mother, and how lastly he sang the song of victory.'

Some [[Taoism|Taoist]] schools held that [[Laozi]] was conceived when his mother gazed upon a falling star. He was born while his mother was leaning against a [[plum tree]].

This may be because his name {{ndash}} "Old Master" ({{lang|zh|老子}}) {{ndash}} can also be read as "Old Child".&lt;ref&gt;Morgan Diane, ''The Best Guide to Eastern Philosophy and Religion'', New York, St. Martin's Griffin, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abaoji===
There are some legends about the birth of [[Abaoji]] (also known as Yi), the Emperor Taizu of Liao. According to the legends, his mother dreamed that the sun fell from the sky and into her bosom, from which pregnancy followed.  When she gave birth, the room is said to have become filled with a mysterious light and extraordinary fragrance.  As a newborn, his body was that of a three-year-old, and the legends go on to say that he was walking at the age of three months.&lt;ref&gt;Mote, F.W.

According to tradition of the Catholic church, the Virgin Mary's parents, [[St. Anne]] and [[St. Joachim]], were childless, when an angel came to them and [[Joachim and Anne Meeting at the Golden Gate|told them]] they would give birth to a daughter. During the [[Immaculate Conception|conception of Mary]], she was preserved from the stain of [[original sin]].

The [[Gospel of Luke]] and the [[Gospel of Matthew]] describe the nativity of [[Jesus]]. In the account in the Gospel of Luke, [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] learns from the [[angel]] [[Gabriel]] that she will conceive and bear a child. When she asks how this can be, since she is a virgin, he tells her that the [[Holy Spirit]] would "come upon her" and that "nothing will be impossible with God". She responds: "Here am I, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|1:31-38|131}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time that Mary is due to give birth, she and her husband [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] travel from their home in [[Nazareth]] to Joseph's ancestral home in [[Bethlehem]] to register in the [[Census of Quirinius]]. Finding no place for themselves in the inn, Mary gives birth to Jesus and she places him in a [[manger]] (feeding trough).&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|2:1-7|131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Annunciation to the shepherds|angel of the Lord visits the shepherds]] guarding their flocks in nearby fields and brings them "good news of great joy": "to you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is the Messiah, the Lord." The angel tells them they will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying in a manger.

In the Gospel of Matthew, the impending birth is announced to Joseph in a dream, in which he is instructed to name the child Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|1:21|131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Star of Bethlehem|star]] reveals the birth of Jesus to a number (traditionally three) of [[Biblical Magi|''magi'']], Greek ''μάγος'', commonly translated as "wise man" but in this context probably meaning "astronomer" or "astrologer",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Brown | first=Raymond Edward | authorlink=Raymond E.

After the 1st century, traditions flourished that represented the thinking of that time, and also preserved source material for many of the ideas in the "theological writings of the church fathers." In their present form the [[pseudepigrapha]]l writings contained in the [[Sibylline Oracles]] include literature written from the 2nd century BC through the 6th century of the Christian era. They contain some material relevant to the birth and infancy of Jesus. But this passage in the Oracles, Book III, probably represents the hopes of pre-Christian Alexandrian Jews.&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Be of good cheer, O maiden, and exult; for the Eternal, who made heaven and earth, has given thee joy, and he will dwell in thee, and for thee shall be an immortal light.
And wolves and lambs promiscuously shall eat grass in the mountains, and among the kids shall leopards graze,
And wandering bears shall lodge among the calves, and the carnivorous lion
shall eat straw in the manger like the ox,
and little children lead them with a band. For tame will be on earth the beasts he made,
And with young babes will dragons fall asleep, and no harm, for God’s hand will be on them."&lt;ref name="Terry, Milton Spenser"&gt;Terry, Milton Spenser, Aloisius Rzach, The Sibylline Oracles, Eaton &amp; Mains, Cincinnati:: Curtis &amp; Jennings, 1899 (page 93, lines 975-984).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later, the church fathers refer to subsequent books in the Oracles that are clear allusions to Christ, and probably dated from the close of the second or beginning of the 3rd century AD.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The first Christian theologians demonstrated in their writings their knowledge of such non-canonical sources.

The [[New Testament apocrypha#Non-canonical gospels|non-canonical gospels]] contain much that is pertinent. The apocryphal literature departs from the Christian canon and its legends have many elements similar to [[pagan]] stories representing popular beliefs of the church from the second Christian century on through the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="Boslooper, Thomas"/&gt;

==Islam==
[[File:Virgin Mary and Jesus (old Persian miniature).jpg|thumb|left|Mary and Jesus in old [[Persian miniature|Persian Shi'a miniature]].]]

===Jesus in Islam===
The [[Qur'an]] and other Islamic literature contain reports of a number of miraculous births of biblical characters. The [[Qur'an]] describes [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virginal conception]] of Jesus by Mary (Arabic: ''Maryam''), which is recounted throughout several passages in the Qur'an. The narrative goes that Mary was visited by the angel Gabriel that she will give birth to a holy son, named Isa' (Jesus), the Messiah and that he will be a great prophet, to whom God will give the Injil (Gospel) and he will speak in infancy and maturity and will be a companion to the most righteous. When this news was given to Mary, she asked the angel how she can have a baby as she was a [[virgin]].&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an, Chapter 3, Verse 43&lt;/ref&gt; To this, the angel replied "Even though when God wants to create a matter, he merely wills (Kun-fa-yakun) it and the things come into being".&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an, Chapter 3, verse 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

After giving birth, while resting near the trunk of a palm tree Jesus spoke to Mary from the cradle instructing her to shake the tree and obtain its fruits. After showing Jesus as a newborn to her family Jesus again spoke "Lo, I am God's servant; God has given me the Book, and made me a Prophet. Blessed he has made me, wherever I may be; and He has enjoined me to pray, and to give alms, so long as I live and likewise to cherish my mother" in order to dispel rumours of conception.&lt;ref name="EoI-Isa"&gt;"Isa", Encyclopedia of Islam&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Quran-usc-range|19|30|e=31|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; This birth narrative draws strong parallels to the apocryphal tradition of Jesus' birth within the ''[[Infancy Gospel of Thomas]]'' and ''[[Arabic Infancy Gospel]]''.

===Muhammad===
After the death of the [[Abdullah ibn Abdul-Muttalib|Abdullah]] his wife [[Aminah]] had a vision where angels visited her and informed that soon she will give birth to a boy and told her to name him [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;https://seekerofthesacredknowledge.wordpress.com/2013/01/16/miracles-that-took-place-at-the-time-of-beloved-prophets-blessed-birth%E2%80%8F/&lt;/ref&gt; When Prophet Muhammad was about to be born, Aminah was visited by [[Eve|Hawa]], [[Asiya, wife of the Pharaoh|Asiya]] and [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] with angels to help her.&lt;ref&gt;http://eng.islam-today.ru/society/aminah-the-mother-of-muhammad-peace-be-upon-him/&lt;/ref&gt; All the pagan idols of [[Kaaba]] fall down and bright light appeared.&lt;ref&gt;https://islamicmisconceptions.wordpress.com/2014/01/12/miracles-on-birth-of-prophet-mohammed-s-a-w/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kabir===
{{Main|Sufism}}
In 1440,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/309270/Kabir |title=Kabir &amp;#124; biography - Indian mystic and poet &amp;#124; Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date=2015-02-18 |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the poet [[Kabir]] was also said to have been born of a virgin widow (a Hindu), through the palm of her hand. Like [[Karna]], Kabir was sent down the river in a basket; he was found and adopted by a family of Muslim weavers, downstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsfinder.org/site/more/kabir/ |title=Kabir presented in Philosophy section |publisher=Newsfinder.org |date=2003-05-24 |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/8319260/Images-of-Kabir |title=Images of Kabir |publisher=Scribd.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This (presumably posthumous) account—which depicts Kabir as secretly descended from Hindus—was intended to legitimise Kabir's religious authority in the eyes of the Hindu population who venerated his works. This story is absent from Muslim and Sikh accounts of Kabir's work.

==Other traditions==
===Aztec mythology===

====Huitzilopochtli====
The myth of [[Huitzilopochtli]] is uniquely [[Aztec]]. Huitzilopochtli is therefore considered to be the cult god or the patron god of the [[Aztec]]. As a solar deity, Huitzilopochtli is closely related to and overlaps with [[Tonatiuh]]. Huitzilopochtli’s mother was [[Coatlicue]], or She of the Serpent Skirt. Coatlicue, known for her devout nature and virtuous qualities, was at Mount Coatepec or Coatepetl ("Serpent Hill"; near [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]], [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]]) one day, sweeping and tending to her penance, when she discovered a bundle of feathers on the ground. She decided to save them and placed them in her bosom. Without her realizing, the feathers impregnated her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Diposkan oleh Blue Roland |url=http://aztecgods.blogspot.com/2008/06/birth-of-huitzilopochtli.html |title=Aztec Gods - Resources for all gods, goddesses and deities of Aztec Mythology |publisher=Aztecgods.blogspot.com |date=2007-02-19 |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=193tKPdM-ykC&amp;pg=PA584&amp;lpg=PA584&amp;dq=Coatlicue+coatepetl&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5uVmbQvFbA&amp;sig=aRdAaNKf_MVzlH19VbFdfLU4irI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjlj7OB57vOAhXIPZoKHdAsDE4Q6AEIODAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Coatlicue%20coatepetl&amp;f=false |title=The History of the Indies of New Spain |first=Fray Diego |last=Durán |authorlink=Diego Durán |page=584 |origyear=1581 |publisher=[[University of Oklahoma Press]] |date=October 1994 |others=Translated by [[Doris Heyden|Heyden, Doris]] |isbn=978-0806126494 |accessdate=August 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pages.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/nahuatl/ReadingCoatlicue.html |title=Readings in Classical Nahuatl: The Murders of Coatlicue and Coyolxauhqui |website=[[UCSD]] |first=David K. |last=Jordan |date=January 23, 2016 |accessdate=August 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Quetzalcoatl====
There are several stories about the birth of [[Quetzalcoatl]]. In the first story, Quetzalcoatl was born by a virgin named [[Chimalman]], to whom the god [[Ometeotl]] appeared in a dream.&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Bierlein, ''Living Myths. How Myth Gives Meaning to Human Experience'', Ballantine Books, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In another story, the virgin Chimalman conceived Quetzalcoatl by swallowing an emerald.&lt;ref&gt;David Carrasco, ''Quetzalcoatl and the Irony of Empire'', The University of Chicago Press, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; A third story narrates that Chimalman was hit in the womb by an arrow bolted by [[Mixcoatl]] and nine months later she gave birth to Quetzalcoatl.&lt;ref&gt;J. F. Bierlein, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2016|talk=Bierlein_cite_about_Quetzalcoatl}} A fourth story narrates that Quetzalcoatl was born from [[Coatlicue]], who already had four hundred children who formed the stars of the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;J. F. Bierlein 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mongolian mythology===
According to a legend narrated by ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]'', a Mongol woman named [[Alan Gua]] had a son, named [[Bodonchar Munkhag|Bodonchar]], some years after her husband has died. She claimed a radiant yellow person visited her at night and impregnated her. She believed the visitor was the god [[Tengri]]. Bodonchar became the founder of the [[Borjigin]] tribe and a direct ancestor of [[Genghis Khan]].&lt;ref&gt;Lococo Paul, ''Genghis Khan: History's Greatest Empire Builder'', Potomac Books, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese mythology===
Miraculous births are common in Japanese folklore, and include [[Momotarō]] the Peach Boy (who was found inside a giant peach floating on a river), [[Kintarō]] (about whom several origin myths are told), and [[The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter|Kaguya-hime]] (who was born inside the stalk of a glowing bamboo plant).

===Native American mythology===
The [[Great Peacemaker]], sometimes referred to as Deganawida or Dekanawida ([[Iroquois]]) was born a Huron, and by some accounts, his mother was a virgin, so the birth was miraculous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Discovery TV |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFIgq8D3oRk|location= Location 14:00min |title=War of the American Indians : Documentary on the History of the Iroquois |date=2013-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12096">The theory of '''divergent modes of religiosity (DMR)''' is intended to explain how religions are created, transmitted, and changed. DMR theory was first developed by anthropologist [[Harvey Whitehouse]] following his ethnographic fieldwork in [[Papua New Guinea]].&lt;ref name="Whitehouse 1995"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whitehouse|first1=Harvey|title=Inside the cult: religious innovation and transmission in Papua New Guinea|date=1995|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198279817}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whitehouse|first1=H.|title=Arguments and icons: divergent modes of religiosity|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198234155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whitehouse|first1=H.|title=Modes of religiosity: A cognitive theory of religious transmission|date=2004|publisher=Alta Mira Press|location=Walnut Creek, CA.|isbn=0759106150}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory proposes that religions tend to coalesce around two divergent modes, termed ''imagistic'' and ''doctrinal'', which are distinguished primarily by their ritual practices. The ''imagistic'' mode is characterized by infrequently performed, high arousal rituals (e.g. [[initiation]] rites) and is associated with small scale,  exclusive religious groups. In contrast the ''doctrinal'' mode is characterized by frequently performed, low arousal rituals (e.g. daily recitations of sacred texts) and is associated with larger inclusive communities, as found in the major world religions.

The theory posits that these differing ritual patterns promote the transmission of religious traditions by exploiting core memory processes. Imagistic rituals arouse strong emotion and generate vivid, [[Flashbulb memory|flashbulb]] like, [[episodic memory|episodic memories]], while doctrinal rituals repetitive nature means that rather than individual events the experiences over time are stored in [[Procedural memory|procedural]] and [[semantic memory|semantic memories]]. Later formulations of the theory also emphasised the different forms of group cohesion that are generated by the two modes, with imagistic rituals promoting intense, relational bonds with the other ritual participants and doctrinal rituals promoting more diffuse, categorical bonds with larger communities who share the same identity markers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

DMR theory was tested empirically against data on 645 rituals from the [[Human Relations Area Files|HRAF]] global ethnographic database and the anticipated clustering of rituals around imagistic and doctrinal modes was confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atkinson|first1=Q.D.|last2=Whitehouse|first2=H.|title=The cultural morphospace of ritual form|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|date=2011|volume=32|issue=1|pages=50–62|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2010.09.002|url=http://www.ehbonline.org/article/S1090-5138(10)00102-9/abstract|language=English|issn=1090-5138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnographic and historical examinations of the theory have been broadly positive and archaeologists have drawn upon DMR to explain the transition from small-scale societies to larger, more complex civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whitehouse|first1=H.|last2=Hodder|first2=I.|editor1-last=Hodder|editor1-first=I.|title=Religion in the Emergence of Civilization: Çatalhöyük as a Case Study.|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=122–145|chapter=Modes of religiosity at Çatalhöyük}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mithen|first1=S.|editor1-last=Whitehouse|editor1-first=H.|editor2-last=Martin|editor2-first=L.H.|title=Theorizing Religions Past: Historical and Archaeological Perspectives.|date=2004|publisher=AltaMira Press|location=Walnut Creek, CA.|pages=17–43|chapter=From Ohalo to Çatalhöyük: The development of religiosity during the early prehistory of Western Asia, 20,000–7000 BC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=K.|editor1-last=Whitehouse|editor1-first=H.|editor2-last=Martin|editor2-first=L.H.|title=Theorizing Religions Past: Historical and Archaeological Perspectives|date=2004|publisher=AltaMira Press|location=Walnut Creek, CA|pages=45–66|chapter=Primary emergence of the doctrinal mode of religiosity in prehistoric southwestern Iran.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, historians and biologists have utilized DMR theory to help explain why some religions separate into sects and how reformations may occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gragg|first1=D.|editor1-last=Whitehouse|editor1-first=H.|editor2-last=Martin|editor2-first=L.H.|title=Theorizing Religions Past: historical and archaeological perspectives.|date=2004|publisher=AltaMira Press|location=Walnut Creek, CA|chapter=Old and New in Roman Religion: A Cognitive Account.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hinde 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hinde|first1=R.|editor1-last=Whitehouse|editor1-first=H.|editor2-last=McCauley|editor2-first=R.N.|title=Mind and Religion: Psychological and Cognitive Foundations of Religiosity|date=2005|publisher=AltaMira Press|location=Walnut Creek, CA|chapter=Modes Theory: Some Theoretical Considerations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pyysiainen|first1=I.|editor1-last=Whitehouse|editor1-first=H.|editor2-last=Martin|editor2-first=L.H.|title=Theorizing Religions Past: historical and archaeological perspectives.|date=2004|publisher=AltaMira Press|location=Walnut Creek, CA|chapter=Corrupt Doctrine and Doctrinal Revival: On the Nature and Limits of the Modes Theory.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the theory has been challenged by some scholars on theoretical grounds &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=XKrjyQTlJWsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=lawson+mccauley+bringing+ritual&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisgurt4NjTAhUCHpQKHagxAh0Q6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=lawson%20mccauley%20bringing%20ritual&amp;f=false|title=Bringing Ritual to Mind: Psychological Foundations of Cultural Forms|last=McCauley|first=Robert N.|last2=Lawson|first2=E.

== Imagistic mode ==
The imagistic mode of religiosity involves collective rituals that are infrequent and highly emotional. Examples of these types of rituals include various initiation rites and [[rite of passage|rites of passage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whitehouse|first1=H.|editor1-last=Corrigan|editor1-first=J.|title=Religion and Emotion: Approaches and Interpretations|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=703–715|chapter=Rites of Terror: emotion, metaphor, and memory in Melanesian initiation cults.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The often dysphoric and highly emotional nature of these types of rituals activate the [[episodic memory]] system, resulting in detailed autobiographical memories. These dysphoric rituals can produce an extreme form of cohesion with the group, known as [[identity fusion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swann|first1=W.B.|last2=Jensen|first2=J.|last3=Gomez|first3=A.|last4=Whitehouse|first4=H.|last5=Bastian|first5=B.|title=When Group Membership Gets Personal: A theory of identity fusion|journal=Psychological Review|date=2012|volume=119|issue=3|pages=441–456|doi=10.1037/a0028589|pmid=22642548}}&lt;/ref&gt; DMR posits that fusion with other group members will also motivate the individual to act out extreme forms of altruism, especially when the group is threatened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whitehouse|first1=H.|last2=McQuinn|first2=B.|last3=Burhmester|first3=M.|last4=Swann|first4=W.B.|title=Brothers in Arms: Libyan revolutionaries bond like Family.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=2014|volume=111|issue=50|pages=17783–17785|doi=10.1073/pnas.1416284111|pmc=4273349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the imagistic mode of religiosity prevails when a group’s survival depends on extremely high levels of cohesion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whitehouse|first1=H.|last2=Jong|first2=J.|last3=Buhrmester|first3=M.D.|last4=Gómez|first4=Á.|last5=Bastian|first5=B.|last6=Kavanagh|first6=C.M.|last7=Newson|first7=M.|last8=Matthews|first8=M.|last9=Lanman|first9=J.A.|last10=McKay|first10=R.|last11=Gavrilets|first11=S.|title=The evolution of extreme cooperation via shared dysphoric experiences|journal=Scientific Reports|date=2017|volume=7|page=44292|doi=10.1038/srep44292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Doctrinal mode ==
The doctrinal mode of religiosity refers to collective rituals that are frequent, usually routinized, and generate relatively little [[Affect (psychology)|affect]]. Examples of this type of collective ritual would include [[Holy Communion]] and [[Call to prayer (disambiguation)|Call to prayer]]. Due to the repetitive nature of these types of rituals, [[semantic memory]] systems are thought to be activated and function similarly to organizing other general [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] and scripts of general knowledge. In contrast to the imagistic mode, these routinized rituals tend to produce less intense group identification, which serves to promote trust and cooperation but not extreme self-sacrifice. DMR posits that the historical transition from small-scale societies to the invention of agriculture brought about the need for large-scale cooperation and collective identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whitehouse|first1=H.|last2=Francois|first2=P.|last3=Turchin|first3=P.|title=The Role of Ritual in the Evolution of Social Complexity: Five predictions and a drum roll.|journal=Cliodynamics|date=2015|volume=6|issue=2|pages=199–210|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/4836f93g|doi=10.21237/C7clio6229624}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To be '''multifaith''' is to feel an affinity with aspects of more than one [[religion]], [[philosophy]] or [[world-view]], and perhaps to [[belief|believe]] that no one is superior to the others. This term should not be confused with [[interfaith]], which concerns the communication between different religions.

This is inherent to [[Relativism]] but exists among followers of other religions such as [[Confucianism]] and the [[Bahá'í Faith]], as well as followers of the more liberal currents within [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Judaism]].

== Relativism ==

Relativism centers on the belief that the best way to honour a divine creator is through the accomplishment of good actions, defined as those motivated by respect and empathy, and that no bad actions can ever be justified in the name of religion. Other religions are considered equally capable of providing a motivation to do good for those who understand them, or to do evil while claiming to do good for those who misinterpret them. 

The term "Relativism" in a religious sense derives from the belief that each individual brings their own wisdom, personality, cultural background and experience to bear on their interpretation of a religion. 

Relativism is open to criticism by the more [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] followers of other religions. In April 2005, in his [[homily]] during [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] prior to the conclave which would elect him as Pope, the then [[Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger]] talked about the world "moving towards a dictatorship of Relativism".

==Design concepts==
[[File:MultifaithAblutionFacility.jpg|thumb|[[Ritual purification|Ablution]] facility in the [[University of Toronto]]'s multifaith building]]
The Manchester University research highlighted two key factors for a multifaith space to work:

* There needs to be a balance achieved for the range of different users most likely to make regular use of the space, thus preventing conflict. All norms and values need to be considered and respected, which often leads to an "unstable equilibrium where divergent worldviews can be brought together." Social cooperation and openness must be possible within the space.
* Most multifaith spaces maintain a very basic design, in order to minimize the visibility of a single faith group, whilst remaining easily adaptable to the many different practices for which the space may be utilized. Each space raises question of ethics and "national style", in which different faith members are able to participate in a mutually respectful, yet cooperative, manner.&lt;ref name=Manchester /&gt;

'''Natty Dreadlocks''' (synonyms "'''Natty Dread'''", "'''Natty'''", "'''Dready'''" or "'''Dread'''") is a [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]] term for a member of the Rastafari community. The image of such a man is often used in [[reggae]] music and elsewhere to represent an idealised [[personification]] of the Rastafari movement as a whole. It combines the term ''natty'' (as in "natural") and a style of [[dreadlocks]] which have formed naturally without cutting, combing or brushing.

* ''[[Natty Dread]]'', a 1974 album by [[Bob Marley &amp; the Wailers]].
* ''[[Natty Dread]]'', a 1997 album by the [[Charlie Hunter]] Quartet, consisting of jazz-funk arrangements of the songs on the [[Bob Marley]] album.

'''Numinous''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|nj|uː|m|ᵻ|n|ə|s}}) is an English adjective, derived from the Latin ''[[numen]]'', meaning "arousing spiritual or religious emotion; mysterious or awe-inspiring".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Collins English Dictionary -7th ed. - 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
''Numinous'' is an English adjective, derived in the 17th century from the Latin ''[[numen]]'', that is (especially in ancient Roman religion) a "deity or spirit presiding over a thing or space".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Meaning "denoting or relating to a numen", it describes the power or presence or realisation of a [[divinity]]. It is [[etymology|etymologically]] unrelated to Immanuel Kant's ''[[noumenon]]'', a Greek term referring to an unknowable reality underlying all things.

==Popularization==
The word was popularized by the German theologian [[Rudolf Otto]] in his influential 1917 book ''Das Heilige'', which appeared in English as ''[[Rudolf Otto#The Idea of the Holy|The Idea of the Holy]]'' in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Otto|first=Rudolf |editor-first=Gregory D. |editor-last=Alles |title=Autobiographical and Social Essays |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D13tugwJcY0C&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=1996 |publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]] |location=Berlin |id={{ISBN|3-11014519-7}} |isbn=978-3-110-14519-9|quote=[https://books.google.com/books?id=D13tugwJcY0C&amp;q=numinous ''numinous''].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otto writes that while the concept of "the holy" is often used to convey moral perfection – and does entail this – it contains another distinct element, beyond the ethical sphere, for which he uses the term numinous.&lt;ref name="idea-holy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Otto|first1=Rudolf|title=The Idea of the Holy|date=1923|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-500210-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/theideaoftheholy00ottouoft |accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5–7}} He explains the numinous as a "non-rational, non-sensory experience or feeling whose primary and immediate object is outside the self". This mental state "presents itself as ''ganz Andere'',&lt;ref&gt;Otto, Rudolf (1996). p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=D13tugwJcY0C&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=%22ganz+andere%22%22ganz+an%22%22ders+%5bwholly+other%5d%22 30].&lt;/ref&gt; wholly other, a condition absolutely ''[[sui generis]]'' and incomparable whereby the human being finds himself utterly abashed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Alice L.|last1=Eckardt|first2=A.

In other words, our ''X'' cannot, strictly speaking, be taught, it can only be evoked, awakened in the mind."&lt;ref name="idea-holy"/&gt;{{rp|7}} Chapters 4 to 6 are devoted to attempting to evoke the numinous and its various aspects. Using Latin, he describes it as a mystery ({{lang-la|[[wikt:mysterium#Latin|mysterium]]}}) that is at once terrifying (''[[wikt:tremendum|tremendum]]'') and fascinating (''[[wikt:fascinans|fascinans]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Otto, Rudolf (1996). [https://books.google.com/books?&amp;id=D13tugwJcY0C&amp;q=%22mysterium+tremendum+et+fascinans%22 ''Mysterium tremendum et fascinans''].&lt;/ref&gt; He writes:

{{Quote|The feeling of it may at times come sweeping like a gentle tide pervading the mind with a tranquil mood of deepest worship. It may pass over into a more set and lasting attitude of the soul, continuing, as it were, thrillingly vibrant and resonant, until at last it dies away and the soul resumes its “profane,” non-religious mood of everyday experience. [...] It has its crude, barbaric antecedents and early manifestations, and again it may be developed into something beautiful and pure and glorious. It may become the hushed, trembling, and speechless humility of the creature in the presence of—whom or what? In the presence of that which is a Mystery inexpressible and above all creatures.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Meland|first1=Bernard E.|title=Rudolf Otto {{!}} German philosopher and theologian|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Rudolf-Otto|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Online]]|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="idea-holy"/&gt;{{rp|12–13}}}}

[[C.S. Lewis]] described the numinous experience as follows in ''[[The Problem of Pain]]'':
{{quote|Suppose you were told there was a tiger in the next room: you would know that you were in danger and would probably feel fear.  But if you were told "There is a ghost in the next room," and believed it, you would feel, indeed, what is often called fear, but of a different kind. It would not be based on the knowledge of danger, for no one is primarily afraid of what a ghost may do to him, but of the mere fact that it is a ghost.  It is "uncanny" rather than dangerous, and the special kind of fear it excites may be called Dread.  With the Uncanny one has reached the fringes of the Numinous. Now suppose that you were told simply "There is a mighty spirit in the room," and believed it. Your feelings would then be even less like the mere fear of danger: but the disturbance would be profound. You would feel wonder and a certain shrinking—a sense of inadequacy to cope with such a visitant and of prostration before it—an emotion which might be expressed in Shakespeare's words "Under it my genius is rebuked." This feeling may be described as awe, and the object which excites it as the ''Numinous.''&lt;ref name="csl"&gt;Lewis, C.S. (2001) [1940]. ''The Problem of Pain,'' pp. 5-6, Grand Rapids, MI, USA: Zondervan, {{ISBN|0060652969}}, see [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0060652969], accessed 19 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==References to the concept==
Otto's use of the term as referring to a characteristic of [[religious experience]] was influential among certain intellectuals of the subsequent generation.&lt;ref name="yourdiction"&gt;{{cite web|title=Louis Karl Rudolf Otto Facts|url=http://biography.yourdictionary.com/louis-karl-rudolf-otto|website=YourDictionary.com|publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="encyc-com"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Alles |first=Gregory D. |title=Otto, Rudolf |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Religion | location=[[Farmington Hills, Michigan]] |publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|Thomson Gale]] |date=2005 |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/environment/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/otto-rudolf |accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "numinous" as understood by Otto was a frequently quoted concept in the writings of [[Carl Jung]],&lt;ref&gt;Jung, "Collected Works" vol. 11 (1969), "A Psychological Approach to the Dogma of the Trinity" (1948), ¶222-225 (p.149).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[C.

{{quote|The literature of religious experience abounds in references to the pains and terrors overwhelming those who have come, too suddenly, face to face with some manifestation of the ''mysterium tremendum''.

In a book length scholarly treatment of the subject in fantasy literature, Chris Brawley devotes chapters to the concept in "[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]" by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], in ''[[Phantastes]]'' by [[George Macdonald]], in the ''[[Chronicles of Narnia]]'' by [[C.S. Lewis]] and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], and in work by [[Algernon Blackwood]] and [[Ursula Le Guin]] (e.g., ''The Centaur'' and ''[[Buffalo Gals, Won't You Come Out Tonight]],'' respectively).&lt;ref name=Brawley14&gt;Brawley, Chris (2014).

In his 2007 book ''[[God Is Not Great]]'' and in subsequent interviews and debates, [[New Atheist]] author [[Christopher Hitchens]] used the term ''numinous'' favorably.&lt;ref name="gazette"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Looseley |first1=James |title=Opinion: Christopher Hitchens taught us to think freely about religion |url=https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-christopher-hitchens-taught-us-to-think-freely-about-religion |accessdate=18 September 2018 |agency=Montreal Gazette |date=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After interviewing him, Marilyn Sewell wrote that he "us[ed] words like numinous and transcendent and soul"—quoting him as saying, "Everybody has had the experience at some point when they feel that there's more to life than just matter"—but said that he emphasized separating this from clerical or otherworldly authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sewell|first1=Marilyn|title=Was Christopher Hitchens Religious?|journal=Huffington Post|date=February 21, 2015|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marilyn-sewell/was-christopher-hitchens-religious_b_1155592.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Open Episcopal Church''' (OEC) is a liberal Christian denomination. It has bishops in England and Wales and clergy throughout the United Kingdom and internationally. It has over 29,000 members.&lt;ref name="Members"&gt;[http://www.openepiscopalchurch.org/organisation/organisation.html Members]&lt;/ref&gt;

The church was the first in Britain to ordain a woman as bishop and to perform religious wedding ceremonies for gay couples.

The OEC is a member of the [[International Council of Community Churches]], which in turn is a member of The [[World Council of Churches]] and [[Churches Uniting in Christ]].

==History==
=== Founding of the Society for Independent Christian Ministry ===
In 1994 Jonathan Blake, who had been a priest in the [[Church of England]] for over 12 years, effected a Deed of Relinquishment,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/33-34/91/section/3&lt;/ref&gt; severing his denominational ties. 

As an independent priest&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/have-dog-collar-will-travel-counselling-dance-workshops-conflict-resolution-arbitration-exorcism----jim-white-meets-the-countrys-first-freelance-vicar-1444165.html The Independent - on 'Country's first freelance vicar'.]&lt;/ref&gt; he offered sacramental ministry to all. In 1997 he wrote about these experiences in his book, ''For God's Sake Don't Go To Church''.&lt;ref name="For God's Sake Don't Go To Church"&gt;For God's Sake Don't Go To Church {{ISBN|0-85305-446-0}} Published by Arthur James.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year he nailed 95 theses&lt;ref name="95 Theses"&gt;[http://www.bishopjonathanblake.com/theses.htm 95 Theses]&lt;/ref&gt; to the door of [[Canterbury Cathedral]], for which he was arrested but not charged.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.christian-alternative.com/authors/archbishop-jonathan-blake]&lt;/ref&gt;

A lesbian from the north of England arranged to meet Blake after reading his book. She felt a call to the ministry but had been rebuffed by the church over her sexuality and was interested in independent ministry. Following the meeting Blake placed an advert in the ''[[Church Times]]'' inviting all those interested in such a ministry to a conference the following March. Over 100 people contacted him, among them Richard Palmer,&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;[http://www.lcc.cc/tlc/lxv1/europe1.htm Richard Palmer]&lt;/ref&gt; who had been consecrated as a bishop of the [[Liberal Catholic Church]] in 1997, but had resigned in April 1999. 

Blake wrote the Founding Principles&lt;ref name="The Founding Principles"&gt;[http://www.sicm.eu/736.html The Founding Principles]&lt;/ref&gt; of the Society for Independent Christian Ministry (SICM), which was inaugurated by a group of Christians reciting the [[Lord’s Prayer]] in the Sanctum of the Holy Circle Trust&lt;ref name="The Holy Circle Trust"&gt;The Holy Circle Trust. Charity Number 1066062&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Ryarsh]] in [[Kent]] at sunrise on 1 January 2000.

In February 2001, Blake conducted the first gay wedding blessing on Richard and Judy's prime time TV programme ''This Morning''.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1170214.stm BBC News - Gay Wedding on Richard and Judy]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Founding of the Open Episcopal Church ===

By the time SICM met for the third time in Bournemouth, Palmer required those who had been ordained simply in Dartford to be ordained ''sub conditione'' at this gathering in a full rite of ordination. Blake realized that a new denomination had to be founded and set about writing the necessary canons.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

At [[Hazlewood Castle]], Michael Wilson&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;[http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/archive/2004/08/07/Lancashire+Archive/5825155.Rent_a_bishop_at_your_service Michael Wilson]&lt;/ref&gt; was consecrated a bishop by Palmer and Blake. The three bishops issued the "Hazlewood Declaration" on 10 November 2001, which facilitated the creation of the Open Episcopal Church. The church viewed itself as being in succession from the [[Old Catholic Church]], which had been established in England in 1908 by [[Arnold Mathew]] from See of Utrecht and continued through the [[Liberal Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.openepiscopalchurch.org/about/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next year, the Society of Independent Christian Ministry and the Open Episcopal Church coexisted, but the differences between them made this untenable, and at Liverpool in October 2002 it was decided finally that thereafter they should separate, following  similar paths, and containing many of  the same people, but with two distinct approaches.

The first significant meeting of the College of Bishops of the Open Episcopal Church took place in London in July 2002, prior to the separation of the Open Episcopal Church and the Society for Independent Christian Ministry at Liverpool in October of that year.

[[Elizabeth Stuart (theologian)|Elizabeth Stuart]] was consecrated as a bishop at the Royal Holloway Chapel, the college chapel of the [[Royal Holloway, University of London|Royal Holloway and Bedford New College, the University of London, Egham]] in Surrey, in April 2003. This was the first consecration of a woman as an independent Catholic bishop in the UK. 

The first congress of the church was held at the [[All Saints Pastoral Centre]] in June 2004. The church's college of bishops met at Weston Manor in Oxfordshire in January 2005 and Wilson, an evangelical, resigned from the Church. The second congress was held at [[Whaley Hall]] at Whaley Bridge in mid 2005. In October, Roger Whatley&lt;ref name="Whatley"&gt;[http://www.churchtimes.co.uk/content.asp?id=75762 Roger Whatley]&lt;/ref&gt; was consecrated a bishop in the Chapel of the [[Ammerdown House, Kilmersdon|Ammerdown Conference Centre]].

===Development===
The church has had three archbishops: Richard Palmer, who left the church along with Roger Whatley after the allotted five-years of Palmer's tenure as archbishop ended; Elizabeth Stuart, who left the church in 2006 and was appointed the Archbishop of the Province of Great Britain and Ireland of the more traditionalist [[Liberal Catholic Church International]]; and Jonathan Blake, OEC's founder, who was the church's sole remaining bishop after Stuart left.

In 2008 the Open Episcopal Church became a member of the [[International Council of Community Churches]] and through them, a member of the [[World Council of Churches]] and [[Churches Uniting in Christ]].&lt;ref name="ICCCC"&gt;[http://www.icccnow.org/Europe/  ICCCC.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The church received national and international attention due to the wedding blessing Blake conducted for [[reality television]] figures [[Jade Goody]] and [[Jack Tweed]],&lt;ref name="Jade Goody's Wedding"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/4779170/Jade-Goodys-wedding-The-final-preparations.html Jade Goody's Wedding]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daily Mail Wedding"&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1150757/Roof-stunt-archbishop-line-conduct-Jades-wedding.html Daily Mail - Goody's wedding]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Damian Thomspon's blog"&gt;[http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/damianthompson/8679611/Jade_Goody_Archbishop_Blake_and_the_strange_phenomenon_of_wandering_bishops Damian Thompson's blog]&lt;/ref&gt; through interviews broadcast after Jade Goody's  death,&lt;ref name="After death"&gt;[http://www.talktalk.co.uk/video/11383/news/Bishop-praises-Jade/#36029 Talk Talk News Interview]&lt;/ref&gt; through the prayer released before Jade Goody's funeral,&lt;ref name="Prayer"&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2009/04/03/jade-goody-s-funeral-what-the-star-planned-for-her-last-journey-115875-21249010 Prayer for Jade]&lt;/ref&gt; through Blake's response to [[Michael Parkinson]]'s criticism of Goody,&lt;ref name="Criticism of Jade"&gt;[http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Jade-Goody-Bishop-Jonathan-Blake-Hits-Back-At-Sir-Michael-Parkinsons-Criticism/Article/200904215258069 Sky News - criticism of Jade]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph - Criticism"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/jade-goody/5123450/Bishop-hits-back-at-Sir-Michael-Parkinson-comments-on-Jade-Goody.html Daily Telegraph - criticism of Jade]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daily Mirror - criticism of Jade"&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2009/04/08/jade-goody-s-wedding-bishop-defends-her-against-sir-michael-parkinson-s-criticism-115875-21263483 Daily Mirror - criticism of Jade]&lt;/ref&gt; through the launch of Post the Host (an outreach provision to distribute the consecrated Hosts by post),&lt;ref&gt;

Following Jade Goody's wedding, Christopher Woods, Chaplain and Director of Studies in Theology at Christ's College, Cambridge, called upon the Church of England to speak out against Blake and the OEC. The Church of England declined to comment.&lt;ref name="Woods"&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article5786676.ece Revd Woods criticism]&lt;/ref&gt;

The church consecrated the first woman as a bishop for Wales in 2007.&lt;ref name="Female Bishops"&gt;[http://pluralistspeaks.blogspot.co.uk/2011/04/then-there-were-four.html  Female Bishops.]&lt;/ref&gt; The bishop of Scotland, David Gillham, ordained Helen Hamilton at St Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall, Orkney in 2010; Gillham later fell into dispute with the church and left.&lt;ref name="Pluralist"&gt;[http://pluralistspeaks.blogspot.co.uk/2011/07/more-on-oec.html  Pluralist.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Press Reader"&gt;[https://www.pressreader.com/uk/the-herald/20120402/282376921549061  Press Reader.]&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton was subsequently consecrated as the first woman bishop for Scotland in June 2012.&lt;ref name="Sunday Herald"&gt;[http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13060905.Nun_made_Scotland_s_first_bishop/  Sunday Herald.]&lt;/ref&gt; She made an episcopal visit to Londonderry.&lt;ref name="Londonderry"&gt;[http://www.londonderrysentinel.co.uk/news/bishop-helen-makes-first-visit-to-the-city-1-4269686  Londonderry.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the church consecrated a female bishop for Northumberland.&lt;ref name="Northumberland"&gt;[http://www.berwick-advertiser.co.uk/news/female-bishop-for-northumberland-1-2740373  Northumberland.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Blake contributed to the book ''A Strange Vocation: Independent Bishops Tell Their Stories'' in 2009,&lt;ref name="A strange Vocation - Independent bishops tell their stories"&gt;A strange Vocation - Independent bishops tell their stories {{ISBN|1-933993-75-8}} Published by Apocryphile Press&lt;/ref&gt; and contributed liturgical material to Geoffrey Duncan's anthology ''Courage to Love''&lt;ref name="Courage to Love"&gt;Courage to Love {{ISBN|0-8298-1468-X}} Published by The Pilgrim Press&lt;/ref&gt; and Leanne Tigert and Maren Tirabassi's compilation ''All Whom God Has Joined''.&lt;ref name="All Whom God has Joined"&gt;All Whom God has Joined {{ISBN|0-8298-1838-3}} Published by The Pilgrim Press&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 Blake's book ''That Old Devil Called God Again: The Scourge of Religion'' was published.&lt;ref name="Publisher"&gt;[http://www.christian-alternative.com/authors/archbishop-jonathan-blake Publisher.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paganism''' is a term first used in the fourth century by [[early Christianity|early Christians]] for populations of the [[Roman Empire]] who practiced [[polytheism]], either because they were increasingly rural and provincial relative to the Christian population or because they were not ''[[Miles Christianus|milites Christi]]'' (soldiers of Christ).&lt;ref name=CF&gt;J. J. O'Donnell (1977), [http://faculty.georgetown.edu/jod/paganus.html ''Paganus'': Evolution and Use], ''Classical Folia'', '''31''': 163–69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, Divers.

Pagan and paganism were [[pejorative]] terms for the same polytheistic group, implying its inferiority.&lt;ref name="Bowersock1999p625"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Brown|editor1=Glen Warren Bowersock|editor2=Peter Brown|editor3=Oleg Grabar|chapter=Pagan|title=Late Antiquity: A Guide to the Postclassical World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c788wWR_bLwC|year=1999|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-51173-6|pages=625–626 p=625}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paganism has broadly connoted the "religion of the peasantry",&lt;ref name="Bowersock1999p625"/&gt; and for much of its history has been a derogatory term.&lt;ref name="Davies2011p1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Owen Davies|title=Paganism: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pjP8Cr28GCIC |year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-162001-0|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both during and after the [[Middle Ages]], ''pagan'' was a pejorative term that was applied to any non-[[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] or unfamiliar [[religion]], and the term presumed a belief in false god(s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kaarina Aitamurto|title=Paganism, Traditionalism, Nationalism: Narratives of Russian Rodnoverie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5c4eDAAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-08443-3|pages=12–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Owen Davies|title=Paganism: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pjP8Cr28GCIC|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-162001-0|pages=1–6, 70–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been much scholarly debate as to the origin of the term ''pagan''.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Owen (2011). ''Paganism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|9780191620010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, paganism was adopted as a self-descriptor by members of various artistic groups inspired by the [[ancient world]]. In the 20th century, it came to be applied as a self-descriptor by practitioners of [[Modern Paganism]], [[List of Neopagan movements|Neopagan movements]] and [[Polytheistic reconstructionism|Polytheistic reconstructionists]]. Modern pagan traditions often incorporate beliefs or practices, such as [[nature worship]], that are different from those in the largest world religions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/paganism Paganism], Oxford Dictionary (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199754670.001.0001/acref-9780199754670-e-659?rskey=Uq4ZiB&amp;result=9 Paganism], ''The Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature'', Bron Taylor (2010), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199754670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary knowledge of old pagan religions comes from several sources, including [[Anthropology|anthropological]] [[field research]] records, the evidence of [[Archaeology|archaeological artifacts]], and the historical accounts of ancient writers regarding cultures known to [[Classical antiquity]]. Forms of these religions, influenced by various historical pagan beliefs of premodern Europe, exist today and are known as contemporary or Modern Paganism, also referred to as Neopaganism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=James R.|title=The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-514986-6|page=13|authorlink=James R.

While most pagan religions express a [[world view]] that is [[pantheism|pantheistic]], polytheistic or [[animism|animistic]], there are some [[monotheism|monotheistic]] pagans.{{sfn|Cameron|2011|pp=28, 30}}

===Pagan===
{{quote|It is crucial to stress right from the start that until the 20th century, people did not call themselves pagans to describe the religion they practised. The notion of paganism, as it is generally understood today, was created by the early Christian Church. It was a label that Christians applied to others, one of the antitheses that were central to the process of Christian self-definition. As such, throughout history it was generally used in a derogatory sense.|[[Owen Davies (historian)|Owen Davies]]|Paganism: A Very Short Introduction, 2011&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Owen (2011).

The term pagan is derived from [[Late Latin]] {{lang|la|[[wikt:paganus|paganus]]}}, revived during the [[Renaissance Latin|Renaissance]]. Itself deriving from [[classical Latin]] {{lang|la|[[wikt:pagus|pagus]]}} which originally meant 'region delimited by markers', {{lang|la|paganus}} had also come to mean 'of or relating to the countryside', 'country dweller', 'villager'; by extension, '[[wikt:rustic|rustic]]', 'unlearned', '[[wikt:yokel|yokel]]', '[[wikt:bumpkin|bumpkin]]'; in [[Roman military]] [[jargon]], 'non-combatant', 'civilian', 'unskilled soldier'. It is related to {{lang|la|[[wikt:pangere|pangere]]}} ('to fasten', 'to fix or affix') and ultimately comes from [[Proto-Indo-European]] ''*pag-'' ('to fix' in the same sense).&lt;ref name="etymonline_pagan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Harper|first=Douglas|title=pagan (n.)|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=pagan&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|work=The Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The adoption of ''paganus'' by the Latin Christians as an all-embracing, pejorative term for polytheists represents an unforeseen and singularly long-lasting victory, within a religious group, of a word of Latin slang originally devoid of religious meaning. The evolution occurred only in the Latin west, and in connection with the Latin church. Elsewhere, Hellene or gentile (''[[Wikt:ethnicon|ethnikos]]'') remained the word for pagan; and paganos continued as a purely secular term, with overtones of the inferior and the commonplace.|[[Peter Brown (historian)|Peter Brown]]|''Late Antiquity'', 1999&lt;ref name="Peter Brown 1999"&gt;Peter Brown, in Glen Warren Bowersock, Peter Robert Lamont Brown, Oleg Grabar, eds., ''Late Antiquity: a guide to the postclassical world'', 1999, ''s.v.'' Pagan.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Medieval]] writers often assumed that ''paganus'' as a religious term was a result of the conversion patterns during the [[Christianization of Europe]], where people in towns and cities were converted more readily than those in remote regions, where old ways lingered. However, this idea has multiple problems. First, the word's usage as a reference to non-Christians pre-dates that period in history. Second, paganism within the Roman Empire centred on cities. The concept of an urban Christianity as opposed to a rural paganism would not have occurred to Romans during [[Early Christianity]]. Third, unlike words such as [[wikt:rusticitas|''rusticitas'']], ''paganus'' had not yet fully acquired the meanings (of uncultured backwardness) used to explain why it would have been applied to pagans.{{sfn|Cameron|2011|pp=14—15}}

''Paganus'' more likely acquired its meaning in Christian nomenclature via Roman military jargon (see above). Early Christians adopted military motifs and saw themselves as ''[[miles Christianus|Milites Christi]]'' (soldiers of Christ).&lt;ref name="etymonline_pagan"/&gt;{{sfn|Cameron|2011|pp=14—15}} A good example of Christians still using ''paganus'' in a military context rather than religious is in [[Tertullian]]'s ''De Corona Militis'' XI.V, where the Christian is referred to as ''paganus'' (''civilian''):{{sfn|Cameron|2011|pp=14—15}}
{|
 |style="padding-left: 6em; padding-right: 1em;"|''Apud hunc [Christum] tam miles est paganus fidelis quam paganus est miles fidelis.''&lt;ref&gt;[[s:la:De corona militis#11|''De Corona Militis'' XI.V]]&lt;/ref&gt;
 |style="padding-left: 1em; padding-right: 6em;"|With Him [Christ] the faithful citizen is a soldier, just as the faithful soldier is a citizen.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume III/Apologetic/The Chaplet, or De Corona/Chapter XI|Ante-Nicene Fathers III, De Corona XI]]&lt;/ref&gt;
 |}

''Paganus'' acquired its religious connotations by the mid-4th century.{{sfn|Cameron|2011|pp=14—15}} As early as the 5th century, ''paganos'' was metaphorically used to denote persons outside the bounds of the Christian community. Following the [[Sack of Rome (410)|sack of Rome]] by the [[Visigoths]] just over fifteen years after the [[Christian persecution of paganism under Theodosius I]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14577d.htm "Theodosius I",'' The Catholic Encyclopedia'', 1912]&lt;/ref&gt; murmurs began to spread that the old gods had taken greater care of the city than the Christian God. In response, [[Augustine of Hippo]] wrote [[City of God (book)|''De Civitate Dei Contra Paganos'']] ('The City of God against the Pagans'). In it, he contrasted the fallen "city of Man" to the "city of God" of which all Christians were ultimately citizens. Hence, the foreign invaders were "not of the city" or "rural".&lt;ref&gt;"The City of God". [[Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orosius &lt;u&gt;Histories 1. Prol.&lt;/u&gt; ''"ui alieni a civitate dei..pagani vocantur."''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Mohrmann, ''Vigiliae Christianae'' 6 (1952) 9ff; [http://dictionary.oed.com ''Oxford English Dictionary'', (online) 2nd Edition (1989)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term pagan is not attested in the English language until the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]]'' instances [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', Vol. II, "Chapter XXI: Persecution of Heresy, State of the Church.—Part VII" (1776): "The divisions of Christianity suspended the ruin of {{sic|hide=y|reason=Gibbon capitalized here, though did not do so consistently throughout the work.|Paganism}}."&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to ''[[wikt:infidel|infidel]]'' and ''[[wikt:heretic|heretic]]'', it was used as one of several [[pejorative]] Christian counterparts to ''[[wikt:gentile|gentile]]'' ({{lang|he|[[goy|גוי]]|rtl=yes}} / {{lang|he|נכרי|rtl=yes}}) as used in Judaism, and to ''[[kafir]]'' ({{lang|ar|كافر|rtl=yes}}, 'unbeliever') and ''[[mushrik]]'' ({{lang|ar|مشرك|rtl=yes}}, 'idolater') as in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstadt, S.N., 1983, Transcendental Visions – Other-Worldliness – and Its Transformations: Some More Comments on L. Dumont. ''Religion''13:1–17, at p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hellene===
{{Details|Hellenes (religion)}}

In the Latin-speaking [[Western Roman Empire]] of the newly [[Christianization of the Roman Empire|Christianizing Roman Empire]], [[Koine Greek]] became associated with the [[Religion in ancient Greece|traditional polytheistic religion]] of [[Ancient Greece]], and regarded as a foreign language (''lingua peregrina'') in the west.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''Confessions'' 1.14.23; Moatii, "Translation, Migration, and Communication," p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; By the latter half of the 4th century in the Greek-speaking [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Empire]], pagans were—paradoxically—most commonly called ''Hellenes'' ({{lang|grc|Ἕλληνες}}, lit. 'Greeks'). The word almost entirely ceased being used in a cultural sense.&lt;ref name="Cameron93"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cameron|first1=Alan G.|last2=Long|first2=Jacqueline|last3=Sherry|first3=Lee|title=Barbarians and Politics at the Court of Arcadius|year=1993|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|isbn=9780520065505|pages=66–67|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=9780520065505|chapter=2: Synesius of Cyrene; VI: The ''Dion''}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Cameron|2011|pp=16—17}} It retained that meaning for roughly the first millennium of Christianity.

This was influenced by Christianity's early members, who were [[Jewish Christian|Jewish]]. The Jews of the time distinguished themselves from foreigners according to religion rather than [[Ethnicity|ethno]]-[[Culture|cultural]] standards, and early Jewish Christians would have done the same. Because Hellenic culture was the dominant pagan culture in the Roman east, they called pagans Hellenes. Christianity inherited Jewish terminology for non-Jews and adapted it in order to refer to non-Christians with whom they were in contact. This usage is recorded in the [[New Testament]]. In the [[Pauline epistles]], ''Hellene'' is almost always juxtaposed with ''Hebrew'' regardless of actual ethnicities.{{sfn|Cameron|2011|pp=16—17}}

The usage of Hellene as a religious term was initially part of an exclusively Christian nomenclature, but some Pagans began to defiantly call themselves Hellenes. Other pagans even preferred the narrow meaning of the word:from a broad cultural sphere to a more specific religious grouping. However, there were many Christians and pagans alike who strongly objected to the evolution of the terminology. The influential [[Archbishop of Constantinople]] [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], for example, took offence at imperial efforts to suppress Hellenic culture (especially concerning spoken and written Greek) and he openly criticized the emperor.&lt;ref name="Cameron93"/&gt;

The growing religious stigmatization of Hellenism had a [[chilling effect]] on Hellenic culture by the late 4th century.&lt;ref name="Cameron93"/&gt;

By late antiquity, however, it was possible to speak Greek as a primary language while not conceiving of oneself as a Hellene.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Swain, "Defending Hellenism: Philostratus, in Honour of Apollonius," in ''Apologetics,'' p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; The long-established use of Greek both in and around the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] as a [[lingua franca]] ironically allowed it to instead become central in enabling the spread of Christianity—as indicated for example by the use of Greek for the [[Pauline epistles|Epistles of Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;Treadgold, ''A History of the Byzantine State,'' p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of the 5th century, Greek was the standard language in which bishops communicated,&lt;ref&gt;Millar, ''A Greek Roman Empire,'' pp. 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Acta Conciliorum'' ("Acts of the Church Councils") were recorded originally in Greek and then translated into other languages.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, ''A Greek Roman Empire,'' p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heathen===
Heathen comes from [[Old English]] ''hæðen'' (not Christian or Jewish); cf. [[Old Norse]] {{lang|non|[[wikt:heiðinn|heiðinn]]}}. This meaning for the term originated from [[Gothic language|Gothic]] {{lang|got|[[wikt:haiþno|haiþno]]}} ([[gentile]] woman) being used to translate Hellene (cf. {{bibleverse||Mark|7:26|KJV}}) in [[Gothic Bible|Wulfila's Bible]], the first translation of the [[Bible]] into a [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]]. This may have been influenced by the Greek and Latin terminology of the time used for pagans. If so, it may be derived from Gothic {{lang|got|[[wikt:haiþi|haiþi]]}} (dwelling on the [[heath]]). However, this is not [[attested language|attested]]. It may even be a borrowing of Greek {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἔθνος|ἔθνος]]}} ({{transl|el|ethnos}}) via [[Armenian language|Armenian]] {{lang|hy|[[wikt:հեթանոս#Armenian|hethanos]]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Harper |first=Douglas |title=heathen (n.) |url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=heathen&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |work=The Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=18 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has recently been revived in the forms [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenry]] and Heathenism (often but not always capitalized), as alternative names for the [[Germanic neopaganism|Germanic neopagan]] movement, adherents of which may self-identify as Heathens.

==Definition==
{{quote|It is perhaps misleading even to say that there was such a religion as paganism at the beginning of [the Common Era] ... It might be less confusing to say that the pagans, before their competition with Christianity, had no religion at all in the sense in which that word is normally used today. They had no tradition of discourse about ritual or religious matters (apart from philosophical debate or antiquarian treatise), no organized system of beliefs to which they were asked to commit themselves, no authority-structure peculiar to the religious area, above all no commitment to a particular group of people or set of ideas other than their family and political context. If this is the right view of pagan life, it follows that we should look on paganism quite simply as a religion invented in the course of the second to third centuries AD, in competition and interaction with Christians, Jews and others.|North 1992, 187—88|{{sfn|Cameron|2011|pp=26—27}}}}

Defining paganism is problematic. Understanding the context of its associated terminology is important.{{sfn|Davies|2011|loc=Defining paganism}} [[Early Christian]]s referred to the diverse array of [[Cult (religious practice)|cults]] around them as a single group for reasons of convenience and [[rhetoric]].{{sfn|Cameron|2011|p=26}} While paganism generally implies [[polytheism]], the primary distinction between classical pagans and Christians was not one of [[monotheism]] versus polytheism. Not all pagans were strictly polytheist. Throughout history, many of them believed in a [[Supreme Being|supreme]] [[deity]]. (However, most such pagans believed in a class of subordinate gods/[[daimon]]s—see [[henotheism]]—or divine [[emanation]]s.){{sfn|Cameron|2011|pp=28, 30}} To Christians, the most important distinction was whether or not someone worshipped the ''[[one true God]]''. Those who did not (polytheist, monotheist, or  [[atheist]]) were outsiders to the [[Christian Church|Church]] and thus pagan.{{sfn|Cameron|2011|pp=27, 31}} Similarly, classical pagans would have found it peculiar to distinguish groups by the number of [[deities]] followers venerate. They would have considered the priestly colleges (such as the [[College of Pontiffs]] or [[Epulones]]) and cult practices more meaningful distinctions.{{sfn|Cameron|2011|p=29}}

Referring to paganism as pre-Christian indigenous religions is equally untenable. Not all historical pagan traditions were pre-Christian or indigenous to their places of worship.{{sfn|Davies|2011|loc=Defining paganism}}

Owing to the history of its nomenclature, paganism traditionally encompasses the collective pre- and non-Christian cultures in and around the [[classical world]]; including those of the Greco-Roman, Celtic, Germanic, Slavic tribes.{{sfn|Cameron|2011|p=28}} However, modern parlance of [[folklorist]]s and [[contemporary pagan]]s in particular has extended the original four millennia scope used by early Christians to include similar religious traditions stretching far into [[prehistory]].{{sfn|Davies|2011|loc=Chapter 1: The ancient world}}

==Perception==
Paganism came to be equated by Christians with a sense of hedonism, representing those who are sensual, materialistic, self-indulgent, unconcerned with the future, and uninterested in more mainstream religions. Pagans were usually described within this worldly [[stereotype]], especially among those drawing attention to what they perceived as the limitations of paganism.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Virgili, Culti misterici ed orientali a Pompei, Roma, Gangemi, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Thus [[G. K. Chesterton]] wrote: "The {{sic|hide=y|reason=Chesterton used "pagan", lower case; verified with source.|pagan}} set out, with admirable sense, to enjoy himself. By the end of his civilization he had discovered that a man cannot enjoy himself and continue to enjoy anything else." In sharp contrast, [[Swinburne]] the poet would comment on this same theme: "Thou hast conquered, O pale Galilean; the world has grown grey from thy breath; We have drunken of things Lethean, and fed on the fullness of death."&lt;ref&gt;'Hymn to Proserpine'&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical antiquity===
{{main article|Religion in ancient Greece|Ancient Roman religion|Hellenistic religion|Roman imperial cult}}
[[Ludwig Feuerbach]] defined the paganism of [[classical antiquity]], which he termed {{lang|de|Heidentum}} ('heathenry') as "the unity of religion and politics, of spirit and nature, of god and man",&lt;ref&gt;cf. the civil, natural and mythical theologies of [[Marcus Terentius Varro]]&lt;/ref&gt; qualified by the observation that man in the pagan view is always defined by [[ethnicity]], i.e. Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Jew, etc., so that each pagan tradition is also a national tradition. Modern historians define paganism instead as the aggregate of cult acts, set within a civic rather than a national context, without a written creed or sense of [[orthodoxy]].&lt;ref&gt;A summary of the modern view is given in Robin Lane Fox, ''Pagans and Christians'' 1989, pp. 31 ''ff.'': "The modern emphasis on {{sic|hide=y|reason=Fox appears to have used "pagan", lower case, per external sources quoting him.|paganism}}'s cult acts was also acknowledged by {{sic|hide=y|pagans}} themselves. It shaped the way they tried and tested Christians."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Late Antiquity and Christianization====
{{further information|Decline of Hellenistic paganism|Hellenic philosophy and Christianity}}
The developments in the religious thought of the far-flung [[Roman Empire]] during [[Late Antiquity]] needs to be addressed separately, because this is the context in which [[Early Christianity]] itself developed as one of several monotheistic cults, and it was in this period that the concept of pagan developed in the first place. As Christianity emerged from [[Second Temple Judaism]] (or [[Hellenistic Judaism]]), it stood in competition with other religions advocating pagan monotheism, including the cult of [[Dionysus]],&lt;ref&gt;E. Kessler, ''Dionysian Monotheism in Nea Paphos, Cyprus''
"two monotheistic religions, Dionysian and Christian, existed contemporaneously in Nea Paphos during the 4th century C.E. [...]  the particular iconography of Hermes and Dionysos in the panel of the Epiphany of Dionysos [...] represents the culmination of a {{sic|hide=y|reason=Kessler capitalized; verified with source.|Pagan}} iconographic tradition in which an infant divinity is seated on the lap of another divine figure; this {{sic|hide=y|Pagan}} motif was appropriated by early Christian artists and developed into the standardized icon of the Virgin and Child. Thus the mosaic helps to substantiate the existence of {{sic|hide=y|Pagan}} monotheism."  [https://books.google.com/books?id=y1-hBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neoplatonism]], [[Mithraism]], [[Gnosticism]], and [[Manichaeanism]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} [[Dionysus]] in particular exhibits significant parallels with Christ, so that numerous scholars have concluded that the recasting of [[historical Jesus|Jesus the wandering rabbi]] into the image of [[Christ the Logos]], the divine saviour, reflects the cult of Dionysus directly. They point to the symbolism of wine and the importance it held in the mythology surrounding both Dionysus and Jesus Christ;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' 6. 26. 1 – 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Athenaeus]], ''Deipnosophistae'' 2. 34a&lt;/ref&gt;  Wick argues that the use of [[wine]] [[religious symbolism|symbolism]] in the [[Gospel of John]], including the story of the [[Marriage at Cana]] at which Jesus turns water into wine, was intended to show Jesus as superior to Dionysus.&lt;ref name="Wick 2004 179–198"/&gt;  The scene in ''The Bacchae'' wherein Dionysus appears before King Pentheus on charges of claiming divinity is compared to the New Testament scene of Jesus being interrogated by [[Pontius Pilate]].&lt;ref name="Wick 2004 179–198"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wick |first=Peter |title=Jesus gegen Dionysos?

===Early Modern period===
Interest in pagan traditions was first revived during the [[Renaissance]], when [[Renaissance magic]] was practiced as a revival of [[Greco-Roman magic]]. In the 17th century, the description of paganism turned from the theological aspect to the [[ethnology|ethnological]] one, and religions began to be understood as a part of the [[ethnic]] identities of peoples, and the study of the religions of so-called primitive peoples triggered questions as to the ultimate historical [[origin of religion]]. Thus, [[Nicolas Fabri de Peiresc]] saw the pagan [[religions of Africa]] of his day as relics that were in principle capable of shedding light on the historical paganism of Classical Antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;"It would be a great pleasure to make the comparison with what survives to us of ancient {{sic|hide=y|reason=Miller used lower case; verified with online copy found in search results.|paganism}} in our old books, in order to have better [grasped] their spirit." Peter N. Miller, ''History of Religion Becomes Ethnology: Some Evidence from Peiresc's Africa'' Journal of the History of Ideas 67.4 (2006) 675–696.[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_the_history_of_ideas/v067/67.4miller.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romanticism===
{{rquote|right|Great God! I'd rather be&lt;br&gt;A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;&lt;br&gt;So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,&lt;br&gt;Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;&lt;br&gt;Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea;&lt;br&gt;Or hear old Triton blow his wreathèd horn.|[[William Wordsworth]], "[[The World Is Too Much with Us]]", lines 9-14}}

Paganism resurfaces as a topic of fascination in 18th to 19th-century [[Romanticism]], in particular in the context of the literary [[Celtic Revival|Celtic]] and [[Viking Revival|Viking]] revivals, which portrayed historical [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic]] and [[Germanic polytheism|Germanic]] polytheists as [[noble savage]]s.

The 19th century also saw much scholarly interest in the reconstruction of pagan mythology from folklore or fairy tales. This was notably attempted by the [[Brothers Grimm]], especially [[Jacob Grimm]] in his ''Teutonic Mythology'', and [[Elias Lönnrot]] with the compilation of the ''[[Kalevala]]''. The work of the Brothers Grimm influenced other collectors, both inspiring them to collect tales and leading them to similarly believe that the fairy tales of a country were particularly representative of it, to the neglect of cross-cultural influence.  Among those influenced were the Russian [[Alexander Afanasyev]], the Norwegians [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen]] and [[Jørgen Moe]], and the Englishman [[Joseph Jacobs]].&lt;ref&gt;Jack Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p 846, {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romanticist interest in non-classical antiquity coincided with the rise of [[Romantic nationalism]] and the rise of the [[nation state]] in the context of the [[1848 revolutions]], leading to the creation of ''[[national epic]]s'' and [[national myth]]s for the various newly formed states. Pagan or folkloric topics were also common in the [[Musical nationalism]] of the period.

[[Modern Paganism]], or Neopaganism, includes [[polytheistic reconstructionism|reconstructed religions]] such as [[Roman Polytheistic Reconstructionism]], [[Hellenism (religion)|Hellenism]], [[Slavic Native Faith]], [[Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism]], or [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenry]], as well as modern eclectic traditions such as [[Wicca]] and its many offshoots, [[Neo-Druidism]], and [[Discordianism]].

However, there often exists a distinction or separation between some polytheistic reconstructionists such as Hellenism and revivalist Neopagans like Wiccans.  The divide is over numerous issues such as the importance of accurate [[orthopraxy]] according to ancient sources available, the use and concept of magic, which calendar to use and which holidays to observe, as well as the use of the term pagan itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecauldron.net/dc-faq.php#4|title=Hellenismos FAQ |work=The Cauldron: A Pagan Forum|publisher=|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sceh"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ysee.gr/index-eng.php?type=english&amp;f=faq#24|title=Pagans|accessdate=September 7, 2007|publisher=Supreme Council of Ethnikoi Hellenes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="heath"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wyrdwords.vispa.com/heathenry/callusheathen.html|title=Call us Heathens!|accessdate=September 7, 2007|publisher=Journal of the Pagan Federation|year=1997|author=Arlea Anschütz, Stormerne Hunt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the revivals, Wicca and Neo-Druidism in particular, have their roots in 19th century [[Romanticism]] and retain noticeable elements of [[occultism]] or [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] that were current then, setting them apart from historical rural ({{lang|la|paganus}}) folk religion. Most modern pagans, however, believe in the divine character of the natural world and paganism is often described as an Earth religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/20693321|title=Pagan beliefs: nature, druids and witches|work=BBC Religion &amp; Ethics|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A copy of the Thor's hammer from Skåne - Nachbildung des Thorshammers von Skåne 02.jpg|right|thumb|The hammer [[Mjölnir]] is one of the primary symbols of [[Germanic neopaganism]].]]

There are a number of neopagan authors who have examined the relation of the 20th-century movements of polytheistic revival with historical polytheism on one hand and contemporary traditions of folk religion on the other. [[Isaac Bonewits]] introduced a terminology to make this distinction.&lt;ref name="Defs"&gt;[http://www.neopagan.net/PaganDefs.html "Defining Paganism: Paleo-, Meso-, and Neo-"](Version 2.5.1) 1979, 2007 c.e., Isaac Bonewits&lt;/ref&gt;

;Paleopaganism: A [[retronym]] coined to contrast with [[Neopaganism]], original polytheistic, nature-centered faiths, such as the pre-Hellenistic [[Ancient Greek religion|Greek]] and pre-imperial [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]], pre-Migration period [[Germanic paganism]] as described by [[Tacitus]], or [[Celtic polytheism]] as described by [[Julius Caesar]].
;Mesopaganism: A group, which is, or has been, significantly influenced by monotheistic, dualistic, or nontheistic worldviews, but has been able to maintain an independence of religious practices. This group includes [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|aboriginal Americans]] as well as [[Australian aborigines]], [[Viking Age]] [[Norse paganism]] and [[New Age]] spirituality.  Influences include: [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism]], and the many Afro-Diasporic faiths like [[Haitian Vodou]], [[Santería]] and Espiritu religion. [[Isaac Bonewits]] includes [[British Traditional Wicca]] in this subdivision.
;[[Neopaganism]]: A movement by modern people to revive nature-revering/living, pre-Christian religions or other nature-based spiritual paths, frequently also incorporating contemporary [[liberalism|liberal]] values{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} at odds with ancient paganism.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} This definition may include groups such as [[Wicca]], Neo-Druidism, Heathenry, and Slavic Native Faith.

Prudence Jones and Nigel Pennick in their ''A History of Pagan Europe'' (1995) classify pagan religions as characterized by the following traits:
*[[Polytheism]]: Pagan religions recognise a plurality of divine beings, which may or may not be considered aspects of an underlying unity (the [[Polytheism#Soft_polytheism_versus_hard_polytheism|soft and hard polytheism]] distinction).
*[[Earth religion|Nature-based]]: Pagan religions have a concept of the divinity of [[nature]],  which they view as a manifestation of the divine, not as the fallen creation found in [[dualistic cosmology]].
*[[Sacred feminine]]: Pagan religions recognize the female divine principle, identified as  [[Goddess movement|the Goddess]] (as opposed to individual [[goddesses]]) beside or in place of the male divine principle as expressed in the Abrahamic [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Prudence; Pennick, Nigel (1995). ''A History of Pagan Europe''. Page 2. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, Heathen and Heathenry are increasingly used to refer to those branches of neopaganism inspired by the pre-Christian religions of the Germanic, Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/paganism/subdivisions/heathenry_1.shtml|title=Paganism: Heathenry|work=BBC – Religions|publisher=|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Iceland]], the members of ''[[Ásatrúarfélagið]]'' account for 0.4% of the total population,&lt;ref&gt;Statistics Iceland – [http://www.statice.is/?PageID=1180&amp;src=/temp_en/Dialog/varval.asp?ma=MAN10001%26ti=Populations+by+religious+organizations+1990-2008+%26path=../Database/mannfjoldi/Trufelog/%26lang=1%26units=Number Statistics &gt;&gt; Population &gt;&gt; Religious organisations]&lt;/ref&gt; which is just over a thousand people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1141">A '''prayer stick''' is a stick-shaped object used for prayer.

For example, the rituals of the Pueblo contain many prayers; thus the [[Zuni people|Zuñi]] have prayers for food, health, and rain. Prayer-sticks, that is sticks with feathers attached as supplicatory offerings to the "spirits", were largely used by the Pueblo. These sticks are usually made of cottonwood about seven inches long, and vary in shape, colour, and the feather attached, according to the nature of the petitions, and the person praying. The stick is intended to represent the "god" to whom the feathers convey the prayers that are breathed into the "spirit" of the plumes.

The [[Hopi]] Indians had a special prayer-stick to which a small bag of sacred meal was attached. Green and blue prayer-sticks are often found in the Pueblo graves and especially in the ceremonial graves of Arizona.

{{Indo-European topics}}
{{PIE notice}}
'''Proto-Indo-European mythology''' is the body of myths and stories associated with the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]]. Although these stories are not directly attested, they have been reconstructed by scholars of [[comparative mythology]] based on the similarities in the belief systems of various Indo-European peoples.

Various schools of thought exist regarding the precise nature of Proto-Indo-European mythology, which do not always agree with each other. [[Vedic mythology]], [[Roman mythology]], and [[Norse mythology]] are the main mythologies normally used for comparative reconstruction, though they are often supplemented with supporting evidence from the [[Baltic mythology|Baltic]], [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]], [[Greek mythology|Greek]], [[Slavic mythology|Slavic]], and [[Hittite mythology|Hittite]] traditions as well.

The Proto-Indo-European pantheon includes well-attested deities such as [[Dyeus|*''Dyḗus Pḥ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;tḗr'']], the god of the daylit skies, his daughter [[Hausos|*''H&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;éusōs'']], the goddess of the dawn, the [[divine twins]], and the storm god [[Perkwunos|*''Perk&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;unos'']]. Other probable deities include ''*Péh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;usōn'', a pastoral god, and ''*Seh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ul'', a female [[solar deity]].

Well-attested myths of the Proto-Indo-Europeans include a myth involving a [[storm god]] who slays a multi-headed serpent that dwells in water and a creation story involving two brothers, one of whom sacrifices the other to create the world. The Proto-Indo-Europeans may have believed that the [[Otherworld]] was guarded by a watchdog and could only be reached by crossing a river. They also may have believed in a world tree, bearing fruit of immortality, either guarded by or gnawed on by a serpent or dragon, and tended by three goddesses who spun the thread of life.

==Methods of reconstruction==
===Schools of thought===


The mythology of the Proto-Indo-Europeans is not directly attested and it is difficult to match their language to archaeological findings related to any specific culture from the [[Chalcolithic]].{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=}} Nonetheless, scholars of comparative mythology have attempted to reconstruct aspects of Proto-Indo-European mythologies based on the existence of similarities among the [[Deity|deities]], religious practices, and myths of various Indo-European peoples. This method is known as the [[Comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method]]. Different schools of thought have approached the subject of Proto-Indo-European mythology from different angles. The Meteorological School holds that Proto-Indo-European mythology was largely centered around deified natural phenomena such as the [[sky]], the [[Sun]], the [[Moon]], and the [[dawn]].{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=428}} This meteorological interpretation was popular among early scholars, but has lost a considerable degree of scholarly support in recent years.{{snf|Puhvel|1987|page=14-15}} The Ritual School, on the other hand, holds that Proto-Indo-European myths are best understood as stories invented to explain various rituals and religious practices.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=428–429}} Bruce Lincoln, a member of the Ritual School, argues that the Proto-Indo-Europeans believed that every sacrifice was a reenactment of the original sacrifice performed by the founder of the human race on his twin brother.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=428–429}} The Functionalist School holds that Proto-Indo-European society and, consequently, their mythology, was largely centered around the [[trifunctional hypothesis|trifunctional system]] proposed by [[Georges Dumézil]],{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=429–430}} which holds that Proto-Indo-European society was divided into three distinct social classes: farmers, warriors, and priests.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=429–430}}&lt;ref&gt;''Mythe et Épopée I, II, III'', by G. Dumézil, Gallimard, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Burkert|1985|page=18}} The Structuralist School, by contrast, argues that Proto-Indo-European mythology was largely centered around the concept of [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] opposition.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=431}} This approach generally tends to focus on cultural universals within the realm of mythology, rather than the genetic origins of those myths,{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=431}} but it also offers refinements of the Dumézilian trifunctional system by highlighting the oppositional elements present within each function, such as the creative and destructive elements both found within the role of the warrior.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=431}}

===Source mythologies===
[[File:IE expansion.png|thumb|right|330px|Scheme of Indo-European migrations from c. 4000 to 1000 BC according to the [[Kurgan hypothesis]]]]

One of the earliest attested and thus most important of all Indo-European mythologies is [[Vedic mythology]],{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=440}} especially the mythology of the [[Rigveda]], the oldest of the [[Vedas]]. Early scholars of comparative mythology such as [[Max Müller]] stressed the importance of Vedic mythology to such an extent that they practically equated it with Proto-Indo-European myth.{{snf|Puhvel|1987|page=14}} Modern researchers have been much more cautious, recognizing that, although Vedic mythology is still central, other mythologies must also be taken into account.{{snf|Puhvel|1987|page=14}}

Another of the most important source mythologies for comparative research is [[Roman mythology]].{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=440}}{{snf|Puhvel|1987|page=191}} Contrary to the frequent erroneous statement made by some authors that "Rome has no myth", the Romans possessed a very complex mythological system, parts of which have been preserved through the characteristic Roman tendency to rationalize their myths into historical accounts.{{snf|Puhvel|1987|pages=146–147}} Despite its relatively late attestation, [[Norse mythology]] is still considered one of the three most important of the Indo-European mythologies for comparative research,{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=440}} simply due to the vast bulk of surviving Icelandic material.{{snf|Puhvel|1987|page=191}}

[[Baltic mythology]] has also received a great deal of scholarly attention, but has so far remained frustrating to researchers because the sources are so comparatively late.{{snf|Puhvel|1987|pages=223–228}} Nonetheless, Latvian folk songs are seen as a major source of information in the process of reconstructing Proto-Indo-European myth.{{snf|Puhvel|1987|pages=228–229}} Despite the popularity of [[Greek mythology]] in western culture,{{snf|Puhvel|1987|page=126-127}} Greek mythology is generally seen as having little importance in comparative mythology due to the heavy influence of [[Pre-Greek]] and Near Eastern cultures, which overwhelms what little Indo-European material can be extracted from it.{{snf|Puhvel|1987|page=138, 143}} Consequently, Greek mythology received minimal scholarly attention until the mid 2000s.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=440}}

Although [[Scythians]] are considered relatively conservative in regards to Proto-Indo-European cultures, retaining a similar lifestyle and culture,&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, David W. (2007). The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World. Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-05887-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scythian religion|their mythology]] has very rarely been examined in an Indo-European context and infrequently discussed in regards to the nature of the ancestral Indo-European mythology. At least three deities, [[Tabiti]], [[Papaios]] and [[Api]], are generally interpreted as having Indo-European origins,&lt;ref&gt;West, M. L. Indo-European Poetry and Myth. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macaulay, G. C. (1904). The History of Herodotus, Vol. I. London: Macmillan &amp; Co. pp. 313–317.&lt;/ref&gt; while the remaining have seen more disparate interpretations. Influence from Siberian, Turkic and even Near Eastern beliefs, on the other hand, are more widely discussed in literature.&lt;ref&gt;Esther Jacobson, The Deer Goddess of Ancient Siberia: A Study in the Ecology of Belief, BRILL, 01/01/1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bessonova, S. S. 1983. Religioznïe predstavleniia skifov. Kiev: Naukova dumka&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/34823985/Argimpasa_Scythian_goddess_patroness_of_shamans_a_comparison_of_historical_archaeological_linguistic_and_ethnographic_data]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pantheon==
Linguists are able to reconstruct the names of some deities in the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] (PIE) from many types of sources. Some of the proposed deity names are more readily accepted among scholars than others.{{efn|In order to present a consistent notation, the reconstructed forms used here are cited from {{Harvnb|Mallory|Adams|2006}}. For further explanation of the laryngeals – &lt;h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;, &lt;h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;, and &lt;h&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&gt; – see the [[Laryngeal theory]] article.}}

The term for "a god" was ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/deywós|*deiwos]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mallory|Adams|2006|p=408}}&lt;/ref&gt; reflected in Hittite, ''sius''; Latin, ''deus'', ''divus''; Sanskrit, ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]''; [[Avestan]], ''[[daeva]]'' (later, Persian, ''div''); Welsh, ''duw''; Irish, ''dia''; Old Norse, ''tívurr''; Lithuanian, ''[[Dievas]]''; Latvian, ''Dievs''.&lt;ref&gt;''Indo-European ''*Deiwos'' and Related Words'' by Grace Sturtevant Hopkins (''Language'' Dissertations published by the Linguistic Society of America, Number XII, December 1932)&lt;/ref&gt;

The head deity of the Proto-Indo-European pantheon was the god [[Dyeus|*''Dyḗus Pḥ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;tḗr'']],{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=409, 431–432}} whose name literally means "Sky Father".{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=409, 431–432}}{{sfn|Winters|2003|pages=134–135}}{{sfn|Burkert|1985|page=17}} He is believed to have been regarded as the god of the daylit skies.{{sfn|West|2007|pages=166–168}} He is, by far, the most well-attested of all the Proto-Indo-European deities.{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=431}}{{sfn|West|2007|page=166}} The Greek god [[Zeus]], the Roman god [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], and the Illyrian god Dei-Pátrous all appear as the head gods of their respective pantheons.{{snf|Puhvel|1987|pages=198–200}}{{sfn|Burkert|1985|page=17}} The Norse god [[Týr]], however, seems to have been demoted to the role of a minor war-deity prior to the composition of the earliest Germanic texts.{{snf|Puhvel|1987|pages=198–200}} *''Dyḗus Pḥ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;tḗr'' is also attested in the [[Rigveda]] as [[Dyaus Pita|Dyáus Pitā]], a minor ancestor figure mentioned in only a few hymns.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=409 and 431}} The names of the Latvian god [[Dievs]] and the Hittite god Attas Isanus do not preserve the exact literal translation of the name *''Dyḗus Pḥ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;tḗr'',{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=431}} but do preserve the general meaning of it.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=431}}

''*Dyḗus Pḥ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;tḗr'' may have had a consort who was an earth goddess.{{snf|West|2007|page=181}} This possibility is attested in the Vedic pairing of Dyáus Pitā and [[Prithvi|Prithvi Mater]],{{snf|West|2007|page=181}} the Roman pairing of Jupiter and [[Tellus Mater]] from [[Macrobius]]'s ''[[Saturnalia (Macrobius)|Saturnalia]]'',{{snf|West|2007|page=181}} and the Norse pairing of [[Odin]] and [[Jörð]]. Odin is not a reflex of *''Dyḗus Pḥ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;tḗr'', but his cult may have subsumed aspects of an earlier chief deity who was.{{snf|West|2007|page=183}} This pairing may also be further attested in an Old English ploughing prayer{{snf|West|2007|page=183}} and in the Greek pairings of [[Ouranos]] and [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] and Zeus and [[Demeter]].{{snf|West|2007|pages=181–183}}

[[Hausos|*''H&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;éusōs'']] has been reconstructed as the Proto-Indo-European goddess of the dawn.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=410, 432}}{{sfn|West|2007|217-227}} Twenty-one hymns in the Rigveda are dedicated to the dawn goddess [[Ushas|Uṣás]]{{sfn|West|2007|page=217}} and a single passage from the Avesta honors the dawn goddess Ušå.{{sfn|West|2007|page=217}} The dawn goddess [[Eos]] appears prominently in early Greek poetry and mythology.{{sfn|West|2007|page=217}} The Roman dawn goddess [[Aurora (mythology)|Aurora]] is a reflection of the Greek Eos,{{sfn|West|2007|page=217}} but the original Roman dawn goddess may have continued to be worshipped under the cultic title [[Mater Matuta]].{{sfn|West|2007|page=217}} The Anglo-Saxons worshipped the goddess [[Ēostre]], who was associated with a festival in spring which later gave its name to a month, which gave its name to the Christian holiday of [[Easter]] in English.{{sfn|West|2007|page=217}} The name ''Ôstarmânôth'' in [[Old High German]] has been taken as an indication that a similar goddess was also worshipped in southern Germany.{{sfn|West|2007|pages=217–218}} The Lithuanian dawn goddess [[Austrine|Aušra]] was still acknowledged in the sixteenth century.{{sfn|West|2007|page=218}} Uṣás in the Sanskrit tradition and Eos in the Greek have very similar attributes, indicating that these attributes were established by at least the Greco-Aryan period.{{sfn|West|2007|pages=218–224}} Both goddesses are also portrayed as taking mortal lovers.{{sfn|West|2007|pages=224–225}}

====Sun and Moon====

[[Sun deity|''*Seh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ul'']] and [[Moon deity|''*Meh&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;not'']] are reconstructed as the Proto-Indo-European goddess of the Sun and god of the Moon respectively. ''*Seh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ul'' is reconstructed based on the Greek god [[Helios]], the Roman god [[Sol (mythology)|Sol]], the Celtic goddess [[Sulis|Sul/Suil]], the North Germanic goddess [[Sól (Sun)|Sól]], the Continental Germanic goddess [[Sowilō|*Sowilō]], the Hittite goddess [[Sun goddess of Arinna|"UTU-liya"]],{{sfn|Gamkrelidze|Ivanov|1995|page=760}} the [[Zoroastrian]] [[Hvare-khshaeta]]{{sfn|Gamkrelidze|Ivanov|1995|page=760}} and the Vedic god [[Surya]].{{snf|Mallory|Adams|1997|page=232}}

''*Meh&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;not-'' is reconstructed based on the Norse god [[Máni]], the Slavic god [[Jarilo|Myesyats]],{{sfn|Gamkrelidze|Ivanov|1995|page=760}} and the Lithuanian god *[[List of Lithuanian gods#Gods and god-like beings|Meno]], or Mėnuo (Mėnulis).{{snf|Mallory|Adams|1997|page=385}} They are often seen as the twin children of various deities,&lt;ref&gt;Snow, Justine T.

OCLC 78771783.&lt;/ref&gt; but in fact the sun and moon were deified several times and are often found in competing forms within the same language.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, Justine T. (June 2002).

The usual scheme is that one of these celestial deities is male and the other female, though the exact gender of the [[Sun]] or [[Moon]] tends to vary among subsequent Indo-European mythologies.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, Justine T. (June 2002). "The Spider's Web. Goddess of Light and Loom: Evidence for the Indo-European Origin of Two Ancient Chinese Deities" (PDF). Sino-Platonic Papers (118). ISSN 2157-9687.

OCLC 78771783.&lt;/ref&gt; a characteristic not only supported by the higher number of sun goddesses in subsequent derivations (feminine Sól, Saule, [[Sulis]], Solntse—not directly attested as a goddess, but feminine in gender — [[Étaín]], Grían, [[Aimend]], [[Áine]], and Catha versus masculine Helios, Surya, [[Savitr]], [[Usil]], and Sol) ([[Hvare-khshaeta]] is of neutral gender),&lt;ref&gt;Snow, Justine T.

OCLC 78771783.&lt;/ref&gt; but also by vestiges in mythologies with male solar deities (Usil in Etruscan art is depicted occasionally as a goddess, while solar characteristics in [[Athena]] and [[Helen of Troy]] still remain in Greek mythology).&lt;ref&gt;Snow, Justine T.

OCLC 78771783.&lt;/ref&gt; with feminine lunar deities like Selene, Minerva, and Luna being a development exclusive to the eastern Mediterranean. Even in these traditions, remnants of male lunar deities, like [[Menelaus]], remain.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, Justine T. (June 2002). "The Spider's Web.

Although the sun was personified as an independent, female deity, the Proto-Indo-Europeans also visualized the sun as the eye of [[Dyeus|*''Dyḗus Pḥ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;tḗr'']], as seen in various reflexes: [[Helios]] as the eye of [[Zeus]],&lt;ref&gt;Sick, David H.

(PDF), Romanian Astronomical Journal, 22 (2): 155–166&lt;/ref&gt; The names of Celtic sun goddesses like [[Sulis]] and [[Grian]] may also allude to this association; the words for "eye" and "sun" are switched in these languages, hence the name of the goddesses.&lt;ref&gt;MacKillop, James.

===Divine Twins===
====Horse Twins====
[[File:Dioskouroi Met L.2008.18.1-2 n03.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Pair of Roman statuettes from the third century AD depicting the Dioscuri as horsemen, with their characteristic skullcaps ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York)]]

The [[Divine Twins|Horse Twins]] are a set of twin brothers found throughout nearly every Indo-European pantheon who usually have a name that means 'horse' ''*ekwa-'',{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=432}} but the names are not always cognate and no Proto-Indo-European name for them can be reconstructed.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=432}} In most Indo-European pantheons, the Horse Twins are brothers of the Sun Maiden or Dawn goddess, and sons of the sky god.{{snf|West|2007|pages=185–191}}

They are reconstructed based on the Vedic [[Ashvins]], the Lithuanian [[Ašvieniai]], the Latvian [[Dieva deli]], the Greek [[Dioskouroi]] (Kastor and Polydeukes), the Roman [[Dioscuri]] (Castor and Pollux), and the Old English [[Hengist]] and [[Horsa]] (whose names mean "stallion" and "horse").{{sfn|West|2007|pages=186–191}} References from the Greek writer [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus]] indicate that the Celts may have had a set of horse twins as well.{{sfn|West|2007|page=190}} The Welsh [[Brân the Blessed|Brân]] and [[Manawydan]] may also be related.{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=432}} The horse twins may have been based on the morning and evening star (the planet [[Venus]]) and they often have stories about them in which they "accompany" the Sun goddess, because of the close orbit of the planet Venus to the sun.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Shapiro. ''Journal of Indo-European Studies'', 10&amp;thinsp;(1&amp;2), pp.&amp;nbsp;137–166; who references D. Ward (1968) "The Divine Twins". ''Folklore Studies'', No.&amp;nbsp;19. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Twin Founders====
The Proto-Indo-European Creation myth seems to have involved two key figures: *''Manu-'' ("Man"; Indic [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]]; Germanic [[Mannus]]) and his twin brother *''Yemo-'' ("Twin"; Indic [[Yama]]; Germanic [[Ymir]]).{{sfn|Mallory|1991|page=140}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pages=134–135}} Reflexes of these two figures usually fulfill the respective roles of founder of the human race and first human to die.{{snf|Mallory|1991|page=140}}{{snf|Lincoln|1991|page=}}

===Storm deities===
[[File:Taranis Jupiter with wheel and thunderbolt Le Chatelet Gourzon Haute Marne.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Ancient [[Gallo-Roman]] statue of the storm-god [[Taranis]], clutching a wheel and thunderbolt, from Le Chatelet, Gourzon, [[Haute-Marne]], France]]

[[Perkwunos|*''Perk&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;unos'']] has been reconstructed as the Proto-Indo-European god of lightning and storms. His name literally means "The Striker." He is reconstructed based on the Norse goddess [[Fjörgyn and Fjörgynn|Fjǫrgyn]] (the mother of [[Thor]]), the Lithuanian god [[Perkūnas]], and the Slavic god [[Perun|Perúnú]]. The Vedic god [[Parjanya|Parjánya]] may also be related, but his possible connection to *''Perk&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;unos'' is still under dispute.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=410 and 433}} The name of *''Perk&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;unos'' may also be attested in Greek as ''[[wikt:κεραυνός|κεραυνός]]'' (''Keraunós''), an epithet of the god [[Zeus]] meaning "thunder-shaker."{{snf|Puhvel|1987|page=235}} A possible alternative name, through the root *(s)tenh₂, is responsible for [[Thor]] as well as Hittite [[Tarhunt]] and Celtic [[Taran]]/[[Taranis]]. The Roman god [[Mars]] is also a speculated descendent, since he originally had thunderer characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;York, Michael. Romulus and Remus, Mars and Quirinus. Journal of Indo-European Studies 16:1 &amp; 2 (Spring/Summer, 1988), 153-172.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water deities===
Some authors have proposed ''*Neptonos'' or *''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;epom Nepōts'' as the Proto-Indo-European god of the waters. The name literally means "Grandson [or ''Nephew''] of the Waters."{{refn|Dumézil, G., [Tr] Krapp, P. (1996). ''Archaic Roman Religion''. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press. Translation from French by P. Krapp of &lt;ref name=Dumezil_1966&gt;Dumézil, G.(1966). ''La Religion romaine archaïque, avec un appendice sur la religion des Étrusques''. Payot.&lt;/ref&gt;|}}{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=410}} Philologists reconstruct his name from that of the Vedic god [[Apam Napat|Apám Nápát]], the Roman god [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptūnus]], and the Old Irish god [[Nechtan (mythology)|Nechtain]]. Although such a god has been solidly reconstructed in [[Proto-Indo-Iranian religion]], Mallory and Adams nonetheless still reject him as a Proto-Indo-European deity on linguistic grounds.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=410}}

A river goddess *''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/déh₂nu|Deh&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;nu-]]'' has been proposed based on the Vedic goddess [[Danu (Asura)|Dānu]], the Irish goddess [[Danu (Irish goddess)|Danu]], the Welsh goddess Don and the names of the rivers [[Danube]], Don, Dnieper, and Dniester. Mallory and Adams, however, dismiss this reconstruction, commenting that it does not have any evidence to support it.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=434}}

Some have also proposed the reconstruction of a sea god named *''Trih&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;tōn'' based on the Greek god [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]] and the Old Irish word ''trïath'', meaning "sea." Mallory and Adams reject this reconstruction as having no basis, asserting that the "lexical correspondence is only just possible and with no evidence of a cognate sea god in Irish."{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=434}}

''*Péh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;usōn'', a pastoral deity, is reconstructed based on the Greek god [[Pan (god)|Pan]] and the Vedic god [[Pushan|Pūshān]]. Both deities are closely affiliated with goats and were worshipped as pastoral deities.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=411 and 434}} The minor discrepancies between the two deities can be easily explained by the possibility that many attributes originally associated with Pan may have been transferred over to his father [[Hermes]].{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=411 and 434}} The association between Pan and Pūshān was first identified in 1924 by the German scholar [[Hermann Collitz]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Collitz, "Wodan, Hermes und Pushan," ''Festskrift tillägnad Hugo Pipping pȧ hans sextioȧrsdag den 5 November 1924'' 1924, pp 574–587.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|Beekes, R. S.

In 1855, [[Adalbert Kuhn]] suggested that the Proto-Indo-Europeans may have believed in a set of helper deities, whom he reconstructed based on the Germanic [[elves]] and the Hindu [[ribhus]].&lt;ref name="Kuhn1855-p110"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuhn|first=Adalbert|authorlink=Adalbert Kuhn|title=Die sprachvergleichung und die urgeschichte der indogermanischen völker|journal=Zeitschrift für vergleichende Sprachforschung|volume=4|year=1855|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wvRTAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA110}}, "Zu diesen ṛbhu, alba.. stellt sich nun aber entschieden das ahd. alp, ags. älf, altn . âlfr"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;in ''[[Zeitschrift für vergleichende Sprachforschung|K.

===Societal deities===
[[File:Paphos Haus des Theseus - Mosaik Achilles 3 Moiren.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Late second-century AD Greek mosaic from the [[Paphos Archaeological Park#House of Theseus|House of Theseus]] at [[Paphos Archaeological Park]] on [[Cyprus]] showing the three Moirai: [[Clotho|Klotho]], [[Lachesis]], and [[Atropos]], standing behind [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]], the parents of [[Achilles]]]]

It is highly probable that the Proto-Indo-Europeans believed in [[Triple goddesses|three fate goddesses]] who [[Spinning (textiles)|spun]] the destinies of mankind.{{snf|West|2007|pages=380–385}} Although such fate goddesses are not directly attested in the Indo-Aryan tradition, the [[Atharvaveda]] does contain an allusion comparing fate to a [[Warp and woof|warp]].{{snf|West|2007|page=380}} Furthermore, the three Fates appear in nearly every other Indo-European mythology.{{snf|West|2007|page=380}} The earliest attested set of fate goddesses are the [[Gulses]] in Hittite mythology, who were said to preside over the individual destinies of human beings.{{snf|West|2007|page=380}} They often appear in mythical narratives alongside the goddesses Papaya and Istustaya,{{snf|West|2007|page=380}} who, in a ritual text for the foundation of a new temple, are described sitting holding mirrors and spindles, spinning the king's thread of life.{{snf|West|2007|page=380}} In the Greek tradition, the [[Moirai]] ("Apportioners") are mentioned dispensing destiny in both the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'', in which they are given the epithet Κλῶθες (''Klothes'', meaning "Spinners").&lt;ref&gt;''[[Iliad]]'' 20.127, 24.209; ''[[Odyssey]]'' 7.197&lt;/ref&gt;{{snf|West|2007|pages=380–381}} In Hesiod's ''Theogony'', the Moirai are said to "give mortal men both good and ill" and their names are listed as [[Clotho|Klotho]] ("Spinner"), [[Lachesis]] ("Apportioner"), and [[Atropos]] ("Inflexible").&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'', lines 904–906&lt;/ref&gt;{{snf|West|2007|page=381}} In his ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', [[Plato]] records that Klotho sings of the past, Lachesis of the present, and Atropos of the future.{{snf|West|2007|page=383}} In Roman legend, the [[Parcae]] were three goddesses who presided over the births of children and whose names were Nona ("Ninth"), Decuma ("Tenth"), and Morta ("Death").{{snf|West|2007|page=381}} They too were said to spin destinies, although this may have been due to influence from Greek literature.{{snf|West|2007|page=381}}

In the Old Norse ''[[Völuspá]]'' and ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', the [[Norns]] are three cosmic goddesses of fate who are described sitting by the well of [[Urðr]] at the foot of the world tree [[Yggdrasil]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Völuspá]]'' 20; ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' 15&lt;/ref&gt;{{snf|West|2007|page=382}}{{efn|The names of the individual Norns are given as [[Urðr]] ("Happened"), [[Verðandi]] ("Happening"), and [[Skuld]] ("Due"),{{snf|West|2007|page=383}} but M. L. West notes that these names may be the result of classical influence from Plato.{{snf|West|2007|page=383}}}} In Old Norse texts, the Norns are frequently conflated with [[Valkyrie]]s, who are sometimes also described as spinning.{{snf|West|2007|page=382}} Old English texts, such as ''[[The Rhyming Poem|Rhyme Poem]]'' 70, and ''[[Guthlac of Crowland|Guthlac]]'' 1350 f., reference [[Wyrd]] as a singular power that "weaves" destinies.{{snf|West|2007|pages=382–383}} Later texts mention the Wyrds as a group, with [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] referring to them as "the Werdys that we clepyn Destiné" in ''[[The Legend of Good Women]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Chaucer]], ''The Legend of Good Women, Hypermnestra'' 19&lt;/ref&gt;{{snf|West|2007|page=383}}{{efn|They also, most famously, appear as the [[Three Witches]] in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'' ({{circa}} 1606).{{snf|West|2007|page=383}}}} A goddess spinning appears in a [[bracteate]] from southwest Germany{{snf|West|2007|page=383}} and a relief from [[Trier]] shows three mother goddesses, with two of them holding distaffs.{{snf|West|2007|page=383}} Tenth-century German ecclesiastical writings denounce the popular belief in three sisters who determined the course of a man's life at his birth.{{snf|West|2007|page=383}} An Old Irish hymn attests to seven goddesses who were believed to weave the thread of destiny, which demonstrates that these spinster fate-goddesses were present in Celtic mythology as well.{{snf|West|2007|page=384}} A Lithuanian folktale recorded in 1839 recounts that a man's fate is spun at his birth by seven goddesses known as the ''[[Deives Valdytojos|deivės valdytojos]]'' and used to hang a star in the sky;{{snf|West|2007|page=384}} when he dies, his thread snaps and his star falls as a meteor.{{snf|West|2007|page=384}} In Latvian folk songs, a goddess called the [[Laima|Láima]] is described as weaving a child's fate at its birth.{{snf|West|2007|page=384}} Although she is usually only one goddess, the Láima sometimes appears as three.{{snf|West|2007|page=384}} The three spinning fate goddesses appear in Slavic traditions in the forms of the Russian Rožanicy, the Czech Sudičky, the Bulgarian Narenčnice or Urisnice, the Polish Rodzanice, the Croatian Rodjenice, the Serbian [[Sudjenice]], and the Slovene Rojenice.{{snf|West|2007|pages=384–385}} Albanian folk tales speak of the [[Fatit]], three old women who appear three days after a child is born and determine its fate, using language reminiscent of spinning.{{snf|West|2007|page=385}}

[[Image:Franks Casket vorne links.jpg|thumb|left|320px|Depiction of [[Wayland the Smith]] from the [[Franks Casket]], dating to the eighth century AD]]

Although the name of a particular Proto-Indo-European smith god cannot be linguistically reconstructed,{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=410}} it is highly probable that the Proto-Indo-Europeans had a smith deity of some kind, since smith gods occur in nearly every Indo-European culture, with examples including the Hittite god Hasammili, the Vedic god [[Tvastr]], the Greek god [[Hephaestus]], the Germanic villain [[Wayland the Smith]], and the Ossetian culture figure [[Kurdalagon]].{{snf|West|2009|154–157}} Many of these smith figures share certain characteristics in common. Hephaestus, the Greek god of blacksmiths, and Wayland the Smith, a nefarious blacksmith from Germanic mythology, are both described as lame.{{snf|West|2009|page=}} Additionally, Wayland the Smith and the Greek mythical inventor [[Daedalus]] both escape imprisonment on an island by fashioning sets of mechanical wings from feathers and wax and using them to fly away.{{snf|West|2009|page=155}}

The Proto-Indo-Europeans may have had a goddess who presided over the [[Trifunctional hypothesis|trifunctional]] organization of society. Various epithets of the Iranian goddess [[Anahita]] and the Roman goddess [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] provide sufficient evidence to solidly attest that she was probably worshipped, but no specific name for her can be lexically reconstructed.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|page=433}} Vague remnants of this goddess may also be preserved in the Greek goddess [[Athena]].{{snf|Puhvel|1987|pages=133–134}}

Some scholars have proposed a war god *''Māwort-'' based on the Roman god [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] and the Vedic [[Maruts|Marutás]], companions of the war-god [[Indra]]. Mallory and Adams, however, reject this reconstruction on linguistic grounds.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=410–411}} Likewise, some researchers have found it more plausible that Mars was originally a storm deity, while this cannot be said for Ares.&lt;ref&gt;York, Michael.

One common myth found in nearly all Indo-European mythologies is a battle ending with a [[hero]] or [[gods|god]] slaying a [[serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] or [[Dragon#Comparative mythology|dragon]] of some sort.{{sfn|Watkins|1995|pages=297–301}}{{sfn|West|2007|pages=255–259}}{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=436–437}} Although the details of story often vary widely,{{sfn|West|2007|page=255}} in all iterations, several features remain remarkably the same.{{sfn|West|2007|page=255}} In iterations of the story, the serpent is usually associated with water in some way.{{sfn|West|2007|pages=255–256}} The hero of the story is usually a [[weather god|thunder-god]] or a hero who is somehow associated with thunder.{{sfn|West|2007|pages=255–259}} The serpent is usually multi-headed, or else "multiple" in some other way.{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=436–437}}{{sfn|West|2007|pp=255–259}}

In [[Hittite mythology]], the storm god [[Tarhunt]] slays the giant serpent [[Illuyanka]].&lt;ref&gt;Philo Hendrik Jan Houwink Ten Cate: ''The Luwian Population Groups of Lycia and Cilicia Aspera During the Hellenistic Period''. E. J. Brill, Leiden 1961, pp. 203–220.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Rigveda]], the god [[Indra]] slays the multi-headed serpent [[Vritra]], which had been causing a drought.{{sfn|West|2007|pp=255–257}} In the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'', [[Krishna]] slays the serpent [[Kāliyā]].

Several variations of the story are also found in [[Greek mythology]] as well.{{sfn|West|2007|page=460}} The story is attested in the legend of [[Zeus]] slaying the hundred-headed [[Typhon]] from [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'',{{sfn|West|2007|pages=255–259}}{{sfn|Watkins|1995|pages=448–460}} but it is also in the myths of the slaying of the nine-headed [[Lernaean Hydra]] by [[Heracles]] and the slaying of [[Python (mythology)|Python]] by [[Apollo]].{{sfn|West|2007|pp=255–259}}{{sfn|Watkins|1995|pages=460–464}} The story of [[Heracles]]'s theft of the cattle of [[Geryon]] is probably also related.{{sfn|West|2007|pp=255–259}} Although Heracles is not usually thought of as a storm deity in the conventional sense, he bears many attributes held by other Indo-European storm deities, including physical strength and a knack for violence and gluttony.{{sfn|West|2007|pp=255–259}}{{sfn|Watkins|1995|pages=374–383}}

The original Proto-Indo-European myth is also reflected in [[Germanic paganism|Germanic mythology]].{{sfn|Watkins|1995|pages=414–441}} In [[Norse mythology]], [[Thor]], the god of thunder, slays the giant serpent [[Jörmungandr]], which lived in the waters surrounding the realm of [[Midgard]].{{sfn|West|2007|p=259}}{{sfn|Watkins|1995|pages=429–441}} Other dragon-slaying myths are also found in the Germanic tradition. In the ''[[Völsunga saga]]'', [[Sigurd]] slays the dragon [[Fafnir]] and, in ''[[Beowulf]]'', the eponymous hero slays [[The Dragon (Beowulf)|a different dragon]].

Reflexes of the Proto-Indo-European dragon-slaying myth are found throughout other branches of the language family as well. In [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Persian mythology]], [[Fereydun]], and later [[Garshasp]], slays [[Zahhak]]. In [[Slavic mythology]], [[Perun]], the god of storms, slays [[Veles (god)|Veles]] and [[Dobrynya Nikitich]] slays the three-headed dragon [[Zmey]]. In [[Armenian mythology]], the god [[Vahagn]] slays the dragon [[Vishap]].{{sfn|Kurkjian|1958|p=}} In [[Folklore of Romania|Romanian folklore]], [[Făt-Frumos]] slays the fire-spitting monster [[Zmeu]]. In [[Celtic mythology]], [[Dian Cecht]] slays Meichi. The myth is believed to have symbolized a clash between forces of order and chaos.{{snf|Watkins|1995|pages=299–300}} In every version of the story, the dragon or serpent always loses, although in some mythologies, such as the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] [[Ragnarök]] myth, the hero or god dies as well.{{sfn|Watkins|1995|pages=324–330}}

===Twin founders===
The analysis of different Indo-European tales indicates that the Proto-Indo-Europeans believed there were two progenitors of mankind: *''{{PIE|Manu-}}'' ("Man") and *''{{PIE|Yemo-}}'' ("Twin"), his twin brother. A reconstructed creation myth involving the two is given by [[David W. Anthony]], attributed in part to [[Bruce Lincoln]]:{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pages=134–135}} Manu and Yemo traverse the cosmos, accompanied by the primordial cow, and finally decide to create the world. To do so, Manu sacrifices either Yemo or the cow, and with help from the sky father, the storm god and the divine twins, forges the earth from the remains. Manu thus becomes the first priest and establishes the practice of sacrifice. The sky gods then present cattle to the third man, *''{{PIE|Trito}}'', who loses it to the three-headed [[#Dragon or Serpent|serpent]] *''{{PIE|Ng&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;hi}}'', but eventually overcomes this monster either alone or aided by the sky father. Trito is now the first warrior and ensures that the cycle of mutual giving between gods and humans may continue.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pages=134–135}} Reflexes of *Manu include Indic [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]], Germanic [[Mannus]]; of Yemo, Indic [[Yama]], Avestan [[Jamshid|Yima]], Norse [[Ymir]], possibly Roman [[Romulus and Remus|Remus]] (&lt; earlier [[Old Latin]] ''*Yemos'').{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pages=134–135}}

[[File:Maria Saal Dom Grabrelief Romulus und Remus 27122013 774.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Ancient Roman relief from the [[Maria Saal#Cathedral|Cathedral of Maria Saal]] showing the infant twins [[Romulus and Remus]] being suckled by a she-wolf]]

The early "history" of Rome is widely recognized as a historicized retelling of various old myths.{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|pages=144–165}} [[Romulus and Remus]] are twin brothers from Roman mythology who both have stories in which they are killed.{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|pages=286–287}} The Roman writer Livy reports that Remus was believed to have been killed by his brother Romulus at the founding of Rome when they entered into a disagreement about which hill to build the city on. Later, Romulus himself is said to have been torn limb-from-limb by a group of senators.{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|pages=286–290}}{{efn|One of the original sources for the stories of Romulus and Remus is Livy's ''History of Rome'', vol. 1, parts iv–vii and xvi. This has been published in an Everyman edition, translated by W. M. Roberts, E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., New York 1912.}} Both of these myths are widely recognized as historicized remnants of the Proto-Indo-European creation story.{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|pages=286–290}}

The Germanic languages have information about both Ymir and Mannus (reflexes of ''*Yemo-'' and ''*Manu-'' respectively),{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=285}} but they never appear together in the same myth.{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=285}} Instead, they only occur in myths widely separated by both time and circumstances.{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=285}} In chapter two of his book ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', which was written in Latin in around 98 A.D., the Roman writer [[Tacitus]] claims that Mannus, the son of Tuisto, was the ancestor of the Germanic peoples.{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=285}} This name never recurs anywhere in later Germanic literature,{{sfn|Drinkwater|2007|pages=63–69}} but one proposed meaning of the continental Germanic tribal name ''[[Alamanni]]'' is "[[Mannus]]' own people" ("all-men" being another scholarly etymology).{{sfn|Drinkwater|2007|pages=63–69}}

===Fire in water===
Another important possible myth is the myth of the fire in the waters, a myth which centers around the possible deity *''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;epom Nepōts'', a fiery deity who dwells in water.{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|p=438}}{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|pages=277–283}} In the Rigveda, the god [[Apam Napat|Apám Nápát]] is envisioned as a form of fire residing in the waters.{{sfn|West|2007|p=270}}{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|pages=277–279}} In [[Celtic mythology]], a well belonging to the god [[Nechtan (mythology)|Nechtain]] is said to blind all those who gaze into it.{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|p=438}}{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=279}} In an old Armenian poem, a small reed in the middle of the sea spontaneously catches fire and the hero [[Vahagn]] springs forth from it with fiery hair and a fiery beard and eyes that blaze as suns.{{sfn|West|2007|p=271}} In a ninth-century Norwegian poem by the poet Thiodolf, the name ''sǣvar niþr'', meaning "grandson of the sea," is used as a [[kenning]] for fire.{{sfn|West|2007|p=272}} Even the Greek tradition contains possible allusions to the myth of a fire-god dwelling deep beneath the sea.{{sfn|West|2007|p=271}} The phrase "''νέποδες καλῆς Ἁλοσύδνης''," meaning "descendants of the beautiful seas," is used in ''[[The Odyssey]]'' 4.404 as an epithet for the seals of [[Proteus]].{{sfn|West|2007|p=271}}

===Binding of evil===
Jaan Puhvel notes similarities between the Norse myth in which the god [[Týr]] inserts his hand into the wolf [[Fenrir]]'s mouth while the other gods bind him with [[Gleipnir]], only for Fenrir to bite off Týr's hand when he discovers he cannot break his bindings,{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=199}} and the Iranian myth in which [[Jamshid]] rescues his brother's corpse from [[Ahriman]]'s bowels by reaching his hand up Ahriman's anus and pulling out his brother's corpse, only for his hand to become infected with [[leprosy]].{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=119}} In both accounts, an authority figure forces the evil entity into submission by inserting his hand into the being's orifice (in Fenrir's case the mouth, in Ahriman's the anus) and losing it.{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=119}} Fenrir and Ahriman fulfill different roles in their own mythological traditions and are unlikely to be remnants of a Proto-Indo-European "evil god";{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|pages=119–120}} nonetheless, it is clear that the "binding myth" is of Proto-Indo-European origin.{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=120}}

==Cosmogony==

In the [[Cosmogony|cosmogonic myths]] of many Indo-European cultures a [[World egg | Cosmic Egg]] symbolizes the primordial state from which the universe arises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leeming |first1=David Adams |title=Creation Myths of the World: An Encyclopedia, Book 1 |date=2010 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=144 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=9I62BcuPxfYC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=world+egg+indo+european#v=onepage&amp;q=world%20egg%20indo%20european&amp;f=false|isbn=9781598841749 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cosmology==
===Underworld===

{{Main|Otherworld}}

Most Indo-European traditions contain some kind of [[Underworld]] or [[Afterlife]]. It is possible that the Proto-Indo-Europeans may have believed that, in order to reach the Underworld, one needed to cross a river, guided by an old man (''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/ǵérh₂onts|*ĝerh&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;ont-]]'').{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=439}} The Greek tradition of the dead being ferried across the river [[Styx]] by [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] is probably a reflex of this belief.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=439}} The idea of crossing a river to reach the Underworld is also present throughout Celtic mythologies.{{snf|West|2007|page=390}} Several Vedic texts contain references to crossing a river in order to reach the land of the dead and the Latin word ''tarentum'' meaning "tomb" originally meant "crossing point."{{snf|West|2007| page=389}} In Norse mythology, Hermóðr must cross a bridge over the river Giöll in order to reach [[Hel (being)|Hel]].{{snf|West|2007|pages=390–391}} In Latvian folk songs, the dead must cross a marsh rather than a river.{{snf|West|2007|page=391}} Traditions of placing coins on the bodies of the deceased in order to pay the ferryman are attested in both ancient Greek and early modern Slavic funerary practices.{{snf|West|2007|page=390}} It is also possible that the Proto-Indo-Europeans may have believed that the Underworld was guarded by some kind of watchdog, similar to the Greek [[Cerberus]], the Hindu Śárvara, or the Norse [[Garmr]].{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=439}}{{snf|West|2007|page=392}}

===World tree and serpent===
The Proto-Indo-Europeans may have believed in some kind of world tree.{{snf|West|2007|page=346}} It is also possible that they may have believed that this tree was either guarded by or under constant attack from some kind of dragon or serpent.{{snf|West|2007|page=346}} In Norse mythology, the cosmic tree [[Yggdrasil]] is tended by the three [[Norns]] while the dragon [[Nidhogg]] gnaws at its roots.{{snf|West|2007|page=346}} In Greek mythology, the tree of the golden apples in the Garden of the Hesperides is tended by the three [[Hesperides]] and guarded by the hundred-headed dragon [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]].{{snf|West|2007|pages=346–347}} In Indo-Iranian texts, there is a mythical tree dripping with [[Soma (drink)|Soma]], the immortal drink of the gods and, in later Pahlavi sources, a malicious lizard is said to lurk at the bottom of it.{{snf|West|2007|page=346}}

There is no historical support for this whatsoever; … there never was a juridical category of ''religio licita''."

O'Keefe, entry on "Religio licita," in ''A Dictionary of Jewish-Christian Relations'' (Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it occurs in only one [[Church Fathers|patristic text]] and in no [[classical antiquity|classical]] Roman sources or inscriptions,&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin H. Isaac, ''The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity'' (Princeton University Press, 2004, 2006), p. 449; Tessa Rajak, "Was There a Roman Charter for the Jews?" ''Journal of Roman Studies'', 74 (1984), pp. 107-123. As Stephen Wilson, ''Related Strangers: Jews and Christians, 70–170 C.E.'' (Augsburg Fortress, 1995, 2005), p. 68, has noted, ''religio licita'' "is not a Roman but a Christian concept."&lt;/ref&gt; the phrase has spawned abundant scholarly conjecture on its possible significance. Some scholars have gone so far as to imagine that all religions under the Empire had a legal status as either ''licita'' or ''illicita'', despite the absence of any ancient texts referring to these categories.&lt;ref&gt;Philip A. Harland, ''Associations, Synagogues, and Congregations: Claiming a Place in Ancient Mediterranean Society'' (Augsburg Fortress, 2003), p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; The most extreme view has held that Tertullian's phrase means all foreign religions required a license from the Roman government.&lt;ref&gt;Esler, ''Community and Gospel in Luke–Acts'', p. 206, taking note of Foakes Jackson and Kirsopp Lake, B.S. Easton, and the early work of H.J. Cadbury as examples of this extreme of interpretation.&lt;/ref&gt; But it was Roman custom to permit or even encourage the subject peoples of the [[Roman province|provinces]] and foreign communities in Rome to maintain their ancestral religion, unless specific practices were regarded as disruptive or subversive:&lt;ref&gt;Isaac, ''The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity'', p. 449; Jörg Rüpke, "Roman Religion – Religions of Rome," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; "A ''religio'' was ''licita'' for a particular group on the basis of tribe or nationality and traditional practices, coupled with the proviso that its rites were not offensive to the Roman people or [[List of Roman deities|its gods]]."&lt;ref&gt;W. H. C. Frend, ''Martyrdom and Persecution in the Early Church: A Study of Conflict from the Maccabees to Donatus'' (Garden City, New York: Doubleday, 1967), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tertullian uses the phrase in a passage arguing that Christians should be granted the same [[freedom of religion|freedom to practice their religion]] as any other inhabitant of the Empire; the passage itself, and not the phrase ''religio licita'', is evidence of the general [[religious tolerance|tolerance]] afforded under [[Religion in ancient Rome|the Roman system of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Cecilia Ames, "Roman Religion in the Vision of Tertullian," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism as ''licita''==
''Religio licita'' has sometimes been taken as a formal recognition or [[charter]] originating with [[Julius Caesar]] and embodied by various pieces of Roman legislation pertaining to the Jews, conceived of as a coherent policy.&lt;ref&gt;E. Mary Smallwood, ''The Jews Under Roman Rule: From Pompey to Diocletian: A Study in Political Relations'' (2nd ed.; Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1981), p. 539 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the various privileges and exemptions granted to the Jews were responses to specific complaints or requests, made in the context of the traditional [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patronage network]],&lt;ref&gt;Harland, ''Associations, Synagogues, and Congregations'', pp. 221–222; Leonard Victor Rutgers, "Roman Policy towards the Jews: Expulsions from the City of Rome during the First Century C.E.," ''Classical Antiquity'', 13 (1994) pp. 58-59.&lt;/ref&gt; and had nothing to do with a supposed ''religio licita'' status.&lt;ref&gt;Esler, ''Community and Gospel in Luke–Acts'', p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; To the extent that the Romans respected Judaism, it was because of the religion's great antiquity, ancestral tradition being regarded as a source of social and political stability.&lt;ref&gt;Esler, ''Community and Gospel in Luke–Acts'', p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been observed that "[[Roman magistrates]] treated the Jews the way they did not because they were consciously tolerant, but simply because they had no reason to hinder the free exercise of Jewish religious practices."&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Victor Rutgers, "Roman Policy towards the Jews: Expulsions from the City of Rome during the First Century C.E.," ''Classical Antiquity'' 13 (1994), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity as ''illicita''==
Some scholars have argued that Christianity was declared a ''religio illicita'' (an impermissible or illegitimate religion) by [[Domitian]] in the [[80s]] AD.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey E.M. de Ste. Croix, "Why Were the Early Christians Persecuted?" ''Past and Present'', 26 (1963), pp. 6-38.&lt;/ref&gt; Though this term appears nowhere, it has been conjectured that a declaration of Christianity as ''illicita'' was the legal basis for official persecutions. There was, however, "no law, either existing section of criminal law, or special legislation directed against the Christians, under which Christians were prosecuted in the first two centuries."&lt;ref&gt;J.E.A. Crake, "Early Christians and Roman Law," ''Phoenix'' 19 (1965), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Rome lacked a uniform policy or legal code pertaining to foreign cults,&lt;ref&gt;T.D. Barnes, "Legislation against the Christians," ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 58 (1968), 50&lt;/ref&gt; and before Christian hegemony in the 4th century, there was no legal language to designate a concept analogous to "[[heresy]]" or crimes against orthodox religion.&lt;ref&gt;Rutgers, "Roman Policy," p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Constantine the Great]], [[Early Christianity|Christianity]] and other religions became tolerated with the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313. Toleration did not extend to religions that practiced [[human sacrifice]], such as [[Druidism]]. This state of affairs lasted until 380, when [[Nicene Creed|Nicene Christianity]] was adopted as the [[State church of the Roman Empire|state religion of the Roman Empire]], after which time [[Historical_persecution_by_Christians#Roman_Empire|persecution]] of non-Christian and non-Nicene cults began. [[Priscillian]] was executed for heresy in 385, and [[Theodosius I]] began outlawing Rome's traditional religious rituals in 391.

The '''religious perspectives on Jesus''' vary among  world religions.&lt;ref name="BWell1"&gt;''The Blackwell Companion to Jesus'' edited by Delbert Burkett 2010 {{ISBN|1-4051-9362-X}} page 1 [https://books.google.com/books?id=5tjiiXkI_CUC&amp;pg=PA526]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jesus]]' teachings and the retelling of his life story have significantly influenced the course of human history, and have directly or indirectly affected the lives of billions of people, even non-Christians.&lt;ref name=BWell1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge companion to Jesus'' edited by Markus N. A. Bockmuehl 2001 {{ISBN|0-521-79678-4}} pages 156-157&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The historical Christ and the Jesus of faith'' by C. Stephen Evans 1996, Oxford University Press {{ISBN|0-19-826397-X}} page v&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered to be the most influential person to have ever lived by many, finding a significant place in numerous cultural contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bauckham|first1=Richard|title=Jesus: A Very Short Introduction|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=United States|isbn=978-0199575275|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Jesus in Christianity|Christianity teaches]] that Jesus is the [[Messiah]] (Christ) foretold in the [[Old Testament]] and the [[Son of God]] [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnate]]. Christians believe that through [[Resurrection of Jesus|his death and resurrection]], humans can be reconciled to God and thereby are offered salvation and the promise of [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]].&lt;ref name="Bible' p.649"&gt;''Oxford Companion to the Bible'' p.649&lt;/ref&gt; These teachings emphasize that as the willing [[Lamb of God]], Jesus ''chose to'' suffer in [[Calvary]] as a sign of his full obedience to the will of his Father, as an "agent and servant of God".&lt;ref name=anselm &gt;''The Christology of Anselm of Canterbury'' by Dániel Deme 2004 {{ISBN|0-7546-3779-4}} pages 199-200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cullmann &gt;''The Christology of the New Testament'' by Oscar Cullmann 1959 {{ISBN|0-664-24351-7}} page 79&lt;/ref&gt; Christians view Jesus as a role model, whose God-focused life believers are encouraged to imitate.

In [[Islam]], Jesus (commonly transliterated as ''[[Islamic view of Jesus|Isa]]'') is one of God's highest-ranked and most-beloved [[prophets of Islam|prophets]]. Islam considers Jesus to be neither the incarnation nor the Son of God. Islamic texts emphasize a strict notion of monotheism (''[[tawhid]]'') and forbid the association of partners with God, which would be idolatry (''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]'').

The [[Bahá'í Faith]] considers Jesus to be a [[manifestation of God]], who are a series of personages who reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world. Bahá'ís reject the idea that divinity was contained with a single human body.

Apart from his own [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciple]]s and followers, the [[Jews]] of Jesus' day generally rejected him as the Messiah, as do the great majority of Jews today. Mainstream [[Judaism|Jewish]] scholars argue that Jesus neither fulfilled the Messianic prophecies in the [[Tanakh]] nor embodied the personal qualifications of the Messiah.
[[Sikhism]] views Jesus as a high-ranked Holy man or saint. 

Other world religions such as [[Buddhism]] have no particular view on Jesus, and have but a minor intersection with Christianity. For non-religious perspectives on Jesus, see [[historical Jesus]].

==Christianity==
{{main article|Jesus in Christianity}}
{{See also|Ministry of Jesus|Parables of Jesus|Miracles of Jesus|Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament}}
[[Jesus in Christianity|Christian views of Jesus]] are based on the teachings and beliefs as outlined in the [[Canonical gospels]], [[New Testament|New Testament letters]], the [[List of Christian creeds|Christian creeds]], as well as specific denominational teachings. These documents outline the key beliefs held by Christians about Jesus, including his divinity, humanity, and earthly life, and that he is the Christ and the Son of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schreiner|first=Thomas R.|title=New Testament Theology: Magnifying God in Christ|year=2008|publisher=Baker Academic|isbn=978-0-8010-2680-5|pages=23–37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=elw8xkVeTTUC&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Christian views of Jesus vary, it is possible to summarize the key beliefs shared among major denominations, as stated in their [[catechism|catechetical]] or [[Confessionalism (religion)|confessional]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first= Gregory L. |title= Catholic, Lutheran, Protestant: a doctrinal comparison|year= 1993 |isbn= 978-0-615-16635-3| pages= 11–17 |publisher=Christian News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, adhering to the Christian faith requires a belief that Jesus is the [[Son of God]] and the ''[[Messiah]]'' or ''[[Christ]]''. Jesus refers to himself as the Son of God in the New Testament.&lt;ref name=OneTeacher &gt;''One teacher: Jesus' teaching role in Matthew's gospel'' by John Yueh-Han Yieh 2004 {{ISBN|3-11-018151-7}} pages 240-241&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians consider Jesus to be the Messiah ([[Christ]]) and believe that through [[Resurrection of Jesus|his death and resurrection]], humans can be reconciled to God and thereby are offered salvation and the promise of [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]].&lt;ref name="Bible' p.649"/&gt; These teachings emphasize that as the willing [[Lamb of God]], Jesus ''chose to'' suffer in [[Calvary]] as a sign of his full obedience to the will of his Father, as an "agent and servant of God".&lt;ref name="anselm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cullmann"/&gt; The choice Jesus made thus counter-positions him as a new man of morality and obedience, in contrast to [[Adam and Eve|Adam]]'s disobedience.&lt;ref name=Pannenberg &gt;''Systematic Theology, Volume 2'' by Wolfhart Pannenberg 2004 0567084663 ISBN pages 297-303&lt;/ref&gt;

The five major milestones in the gospel narrative of the life of Jesus are his [[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism]], [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]], Crucifixion, Resurrection and [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]].&lt;ref name=digby &gt;''Essays in New Testament interpretation'' by Charles Francis Digby Moule 1982 {{ISBN|0-521-23783-1}} page 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Melody of Faith: Theology in an Orthodox Key'' by Vigen Guroian 2010 {{ISBN|0-8028-6496-1}} page 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JBreck12 /&gt; These are usually bracketed by two other episodes: his [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] at the beginning and the sending of the [[Paraclete]] at the end.&lt;ref name=digby /&gt;&lt;ref name=JBreck12 &gt;''Scripture in tradition'' by John Breck 2001 {{ISBN|0-88141-226-0}} page 12&lt;/ref&gt; The gospel accounts of the teachings of Jesus are often presented in terms of specific categories involving his "works and words", e.g. his [[Ministry of Jesus|ministry]], [[Parables of Jesus|parables]] and [[Miracles of Jesus|miracles]].&lt;ref name=Zuck100 &gt;''The Bible Knowledge Commentary'' by John F.

Dwight Pentecost 2000 {{ISBN|978-0-310-30940-6}} page 212&lt;/ref&gt;  The words of Jesus include several sermons, in addition to parables that appear throughout the narrative of the [[Synoptic Gospels]] (the gospel of John includes no parables).

Christians not only attach theological significance to the works of Jesus, but also to his name. Devotions to the [[Holy Name of Jesus]] go back to the [[Early Christianity|earliest days of Christianity]].&lt;ref name=Sylvester &gt;''Outlines of dogmatic theology, Volume 2 by Sylvester Hunter 2010 {{ISBN|1-146-98633-5}} page 443&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Houlden &gt;''Jesus: the complete guide'' by Leslie Houlden 2006 {{ISBN|0-8264-8011-X}} page 426&lt;/ref&gt; These devotions and feasts exist both in [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern]] and [[Western Church|Western Christianity]].&lt;ref name="Houlden"/&gt;

===Incarnation===
{{Further information|Incarnation (Christianity)|Christology}}
Most Christians believe that Jesus was both human and the Son of God. While there have been theological debate over the nature of Jesus, [[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Christians generally believe that Jesus is [[Incarnation (Christianity)|God incarnate]], [[God the Son]], and "[[Hypostatic union|true God and true man]]" (or both fully divine and fully human). Jesus, [[Incarnation (Christianity)|having become fully human]] in all respects, suffered the pains and temptations of a mortal man, yet he did not sin. As fully God, he defeated death and rose to life again. According to the [[Bible]], God raised him from the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Acts|2:24|NIV}}, {{bibleref2|Romans|10:9|NIV}}, {{bibleref2|1Cor|15:15|NIV}}, {{bibleref2|Acts|2:31-32}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|3:15}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|3:26}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|4:10}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|5:30}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|10:40-41}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|13:30}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|13:34}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|13:37}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|17:30-31}}, {{bibleref2|1Cor|6:14}}, {{bibleref2|2Cor|4:14}}, {{bibleref2|Gal|1:1}}, {{bibleref2|Eph|1:20}}, {{bibleref2|Col|2:12}}, {{bibleref2|1Thess|1:10}}, {{bibleref2|Heb|13:20}}, {{bibleref2|1Pet|1:3}}, {{bibleref2-nb|1Pet|1:21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He [[Ascension of Jesus|ascended to heaven]], to the "right hand of God,"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Mark|16:19}}, {{bibleref2|Luke|22:69}}, {{bibleref2|Acts|2:33}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|5:31}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|7:55-56}}, {{bibleref2|Romans|8:34}}, {{bibleref2|Eph|1:20}}, {{bibleref2|Col|3:1}}, {{bibleref2|Hebrews|1:3}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Hebrews|1:13}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Hebrews|10:12}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Hebrews|12:2}}, {{bibleref2|1Peter|3:22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he will [[Second Coming|return again]] for the [[Last Judgment]] and the establishment of the [[Kingdom of God]].&lt;ref&gt;cf. {{Bibleref2|John|14:1-3}}, {{Bibleref2|Acts|1:10-11}}, {{Bibleref2|Luke|21:27}}, {{Bibleref2|Revelation|1:7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
{{main article|Jesus in Islam}}

In Islam, Jesus (''Isa'') is considered to be a [[Apostle (Islam)|messenger]] of God (''[[Allah]]'') and the Messiah (''[[Messiah#Islam|al-Masih]]'') who was sent to guide the [[Israelites|Children of Israel]] (''Bani Isra'il'') with a new scripture, the Gospel.&lt;ref name="CEI"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D7tu12gt4JYC&amp;pg=PA270#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Concise Encyclopedia of Islam | publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield | last=Glassé | first=Cyril | year=2008 | pages=270–271 | isbn=978-0-7425-6296-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Islam|year=2003|first=John L. |last=Esposito |page= 158|publisher=Oxford University Press| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E324pQEEQQcC&amp;pg=PA159#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-19-975726-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Quran]] mentions Jesus by name 25 times—more often than [[Muhammad]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aboul-Enein|first=Youssef H.|title=Militant Islamist Ideology: Understanding the Global Threat|year=2010|publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=978-1-61251-015-6|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tX3suVDTJz0C&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and emphasises that Jesus was a mortal human who, like all other prophets, had been divinely chosen to spread God's message.&lt;ref name="comparative"&gt;{{cite book|title=Comparative Religious Ethics: A Narrative Approach|first1=Darrell J.|last1= Fasching |first2= Dell |last2=deChant|year=2001| pages= 241, 274–275 |isbn=978-0-631-20125-0 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Christian writings, the Quran  does not describe Jesus as the [[son of God]], but as one of four major human [[Rasul|messengers]] (out of many [[Prophets of Islam|prophets]]) sent by God throughout history to guide mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mystical Dimensions of Islam|publisher=Chapel Hill:University of North Carolina Press|author=Annemarie Schimmel|date=1975|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus is said to have lived a life of piety and generosity, and abstained from eating flesh of swine (or of any animals, according to some Muslim authors, even some who were not vegetarians themselves).

Muslims also believe that Jesus received a Gospel from God, called the ''[[Gospel in Islam|Injil]]''. However, Muslims hold that Jesus' original message was [[tahrif|lost or altered]] and that the Christian New Testament does not accurately represent God's original message to mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor-last=Bockmuehl |editor-first= Markus N. A. |title=Quests for the historical Jesus |first=James C. |last=Paget |year=2001|encyclopedia= Cambridge companion to Jesus|publisher= Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vSehrtQpcYcC&amp;pg=PA183#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-521-79678-1|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite some major differences, the Quran and New Testament overlap in other aspects of Jesus' life; both Muslims and orthodox Christians believe that Jesus was miraculously born without a human biological father by the will of God, and that his mother, Mary (''[[Mary in Islam|Maryam]]'' in Arabic), is among the most saintly, pious, chaste and virtuous women ever.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito, John. ''What Everyone Needs to Know About Islam''. New York: University Press, 2002. P31.&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran also specifies that Jesus was able to perform [[miracle]]s&amp;mdash;though only by the will of God&amp;mdash;including being able to raise the dead, restore sight to the blind and cure lepers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Diane|title=Essential Islam: A Comprehensive Guide to Belief and Practice|year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-36025-1|pages=45–46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U94S6N2zECAC&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; One miracle attributed to Jesus in the Quran, but not in the New Testament, is his being able to speak at only a few days old, to defend his mother from accusations of [[adultery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|19|27|e=33|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also says that Jesus was a 'word' from God, since he was predicted to come in the [[Old Testament]].

Most Muslims believe that he was neither killed nor crucified, but that God made it appear so to his enemies. With the noteworthy exception of [[Ahmadi]] Muslims who believe that Jesus was indeed put on the cross, survived the crucifixion and was not lifted bodily to the heaven, majority of Muslims believe that Jesus ascended bodily to heaven and is alive. Majority of the Muslim population does not consider Ahmadi Muslims to be Muslims and consider them as Infidels due to their unorthodox perspectives. Some Muslim scholars maintain that Jesus was indeed put up on the cross, but did not die on it; rather, he revived and then ascended bodily to heaven. Others say that it was actually [[Judas Iscariot]] who was mistakenly crucified by the Romans. Regardless, Muslims believe that Jesus is alive in [[heaven]] and will return to the world in the flesh to defeat the [[Antichrist]], once the world has become filled with sin, deception and injustice, and then live out the rest of his natural life.&lt;ref name="CEI"/&gt;

Islam rejects the [[Trinity|Trinitarian Christian]] view that Jesus was [[Incarnation (Christianity)|God incarnate]] or the [[son of God]], that he was ever crucified or resurrected or that he ever [[Atonement in Christianity|atoned]] for the sins of mankind. The Quran says that Jesus himself never claimed any of these things, and it furthermore indicates that Jesus will deny having ever claimed divinity at the Last Judgment, and God will vindicate him.{{Cite quran|5|116}}

==Judaism==
{{Main article|Judaism's view of Jesus}}
[[Judaism]] rejects the idea of Jesus being God, or a person of a Trinity, or a mediator to God. Judaism also holds that Jesus is not the [[Jewish Messianism|Messiah]], arguing that he had not fulfilled the [[Messianic prophecies]] in the [[Tanakh]] nor embodied the personal qualifications of the Messiah. According to Jewish tradition, there were no more prophets after [[Malachi]], who lived centuries before Jesus and delivered his prophesies about 420 BC/BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shraga Simmons|Simmons, Shraga]], "[http://www.aish.com/jewishissues/jewishsociety/Why_Jews_Dont_Believe_In_Jesus.asp Why Jews Do not Believe in Jesus]", Retrieved April 15, 2007; "[http://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/2637/Q1/ Why Jews Do not Believe in Jesus]", [[Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem|Ohr Samayach]]&amp;nbsp;— ''Ask the Rabbi'', Retrieved April 15, 2007; "[http://www.askmoses.com/qa_detail.html?h=120&amp;o=350 Why do not Jews believe that Jesus was the Messiah?]", [[AskMoses.com]], Retrieved April 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jesus in Jewish writings===
{{See also|Jesus in the Talmud}}
The [[Babylonian Talmud]] include stories of ''[[Yeshu]]'' {{lang|he|יֵשׁוּ}}; the vast majority of contemporary historians disregard these as sources on the [[historical Jesus]].&lt;ref name="TM1998"&gt;Theissen, Gerd and Annette Merz. The historical Jesus: a comprehensive guide.

The ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', an authoritative work of [[halakha|Jewish law]], states in ''Hilkhot Melakhim'' 11:10–12 that Jesus is a "stumbling block" who makes "the majority of the world err to serve a divinity besides God".
{{quote|Even Jesus the Nazarene who imagined that he would be [[Jewish Messiah|Messiah]] and was killed by the court, was already prophesied by [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]].

And they stumbled."{{Bibleref2c|Dan.|11:14}} Because, is there a greater stumbling-block than this one? So that all of the [[prophet]]s spoke that the Messiah redeems Israel, and saves them, and gathers their banished ones, and strengthens their commandments. And this one caused (nations) to destroy Israel by sword, and to scatter their remnant, and to humiliate them, and to exchange the Torah, and to make the majority of the world err to serve a divinity besides God.

And all these things of Jesus the Nazarene, and of ([[Muhammad]]) the [[Ishmael]]ite who stood after him&amp;nbsp;— there is no (purpose) but to straighten out the way for the King Messiah, and to restore all the world to serve God together. So that it is said, "Because then I will turn toward the nations (giving them) a clear lip, to call all of them in the name of God and to serve God (shoulder to shoulder as) one shoulder."{{Bibleref2c|Zeph.|3:9}} Look how all the world already becomes full of the things of the Messiah, and the things of the [[Torah]], and the things of the commandments!

==Bahá'í Faith==
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] consider Jesus to be a [[manifestation of God]], who are a series of personages who reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world for the progress and advancement of human morals and civilization.&lt;ref name="manifestation"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Juan | last = Cole | title = The Concept of Manifestation in the Bahá'í Writings| year = 1982 | journal = Bahá'í Studies | volume = monograph 9 | pages = 1–38 | url = http://bahai-library.com/cole_concept_manifestation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Bahá'í belief, the Manifestations have always been sent by God, and always will, as part of the single [[progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|progressive religion]] from God bringing more teachings through time to help humanity progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Progressive revelation |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 276–277}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Manifestations of God are taught to be "one and the same", and in their relationship to one another have both the station of unity and the station of distinction.&lt;ref name="manifestation" /&gt; In this way each Manifestation of God manifested the Word of God and taught the same religion, with modifications for the particular audience's needs and culture. [[Bahá'u'lláh]] wrote that since each Manifestation of God has the same divine attributes, they can be seen as the spiritual "return" of all the previous Manifestations of God.&lt;ref name="manifestation" /&gt; In this way, Bahá'ís believe that Bahá'u'lláh is, in both respects, the return of Jesus.

==Other==
Traditionally, Buddhists as a group take no particular view on Jesus, and [[Buddhism and Christianity]] have but a minor intersection. However, some scholars have noted similarities between the life and teachings of [[Gautama Buddha]] and [[Jesus]]. These similarities might be attributed to Buddhist missionaries sent as early as Emperor [[Ashoka]] around 250 BCE in many of the Greek [[Seleucid]] kingdoms that existed then and then later became the same regions that Christianity began.&lt;ref&gt;Old World Encounters. Cross-cultural contacts and exchanges in pre-modern times" by Jerry H.Bentley (Oxford University Press, 1993) {{ISBN|0-19-507639-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus was seen as the savior and bringer of [[gnosis]] by various [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] sects, such as the extinct [[Manichaeism]]. In the [[Jesus in Ahmadiyya Islam|Ahmadiyya Islamic view]], Jesus survived the crucifixion and later travelled to [[India]], where he lived as a prophet (and died) under the name of [[Yuz Asaf]].

In [[Jesus in Scientology|Scientology]], the teachings of Jesus are included among belief systems comprising those "earlier forms".&lt;ref name="rhodes"&gt;{{cite book | last =Rhodes | first =Ron | title =The Challenge of the Cults and New Religions: The Essential Guide to Their History, Their Doctrine, and Our Response | publisher =Zondervan | year =2001 | pages =155, 164 | isbn = 0-310-23217-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus is classified as below the level of [[Operating Thetan]], but as a "shade above" the Scientology state of "[[Clear (Scientology)|Clear]]".&lt;ref name="rhodes" /&gt;

A '''religious war''' or '''holy war''' ({{lang-la|bellum sacrum}}) is a [[war]] primarily caused or justified by differences in [[religion]]. In the [[modern period]], debates are common over the extent to which religious, [[War#Economic|economic]], or [[ethnic conflict|ethnic]] aspects of a conflict predominate in a given war. According to the ''Encyclopedia of Wars'', out of all 1,763 known/recorded historical conflicts, 123, or 6.98%, had religion as their primary cause, and of that percentage, 65, or 53.66%, were related to Islam.&lt;ref name="Axelrod, Alan 2004"&gt;Axelrod, Alan &amp; Phillips, Charles ''Encyclopedia of Wars'', Facts on File, November 2004,  {{ISBN|978-0-8160-2851-1}}. Deem, Richard.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matthew White (historian)|Matthew White]]'s ''[[The Great Big Book of Horrible Things]]'' gives religion as the cause of 13 of the world's 100 deadliest atrocities.&lt;ref name = "White"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Matthew White|title=The Great Big Book of Horrible Things|date=2011|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=978-0-393-08192-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In several conflicts including the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], the [[Syrian civil war]], and the wars in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraqi insurgency (post-U.S. withdrawal)|Iraq]], religious elements are overtly present but variously described as [[fundamentalism]] or [[religious extremism]]—depending upon the observer's sympathies. However, studies on these cases often conclude that ethnic animosities drive much of the conflicts.&lt;ref name="Omar"/&gt;

Some historians argue that what is termed "religious wars" is a largely "Western dichotomy" and a modern invention from the past few centuries, arguing that all wars that are classed as "religious" have secular (economic or political) ramifications.&lt;ref name="Cavanaugh"/&gt; Similar opinions were expressed as early as the 1760s, during the [[Seven Years' War]], widely recognized to be "religious" in motivation, noting that the warring factions were not necessarily split along confessional lines as much as along secular interests.&lt;ref name="p. 110"&gt;John Entick, ''The General History of the [[Seven Years' War|Later War]]'', Volume 3, 1763, [https://books.google.com/books?id=21pSAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA110&amp;dq=%22religious+war%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=COoAUrOGNoGJ4ASK14HYAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22religious%20war%22&amp;f=false p. 110].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jeffrey Burton Russell]], numerous cases of supposed acts of religious wars such as the [[Thirty Years War]], the [[French Wars of Religion]], the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]], [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] and other terrorist attacks, the [[Bosnian War]], and the [[Rwandan Civil War]] were all primarily motivated by social, political, and economic issues rather than religion.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey Russell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Jeffrey Burton|title=Exposing Myths about Christianity|date=2012|publisher=IVP Books|location=Downers Grove, Ill.|isbn=9780830834662|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the concept of religion==
The modern word ''religion'' comes from the Latin word ''religio''. In the ancient and medieval world, the etymological Latin root ''religio'' was understood as an individual virtue of worship, never as doctrine, practice, or actual source of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt; The modern concept of "religion" as an abstraction which entails distinct sets of beliefs or doctrines is a recent invention in the English language since such usage began with texts from the 17th century due to the splitting of Christendom during the Protestant Reformation and more prevalent colonization or globalization in the age of exploration which involved contact with numerous foreign and indigenous cultures with non-European languages.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harrison |first1=Peter |title=The Territories of Science and Religion |date=2015 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=022618448X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in the 17th century that the concept of "religion" received its modern shape despite the fact that ancient texts like the Bible, the Quran, and other ancient sacred texts did not have a concept of religion in the original languages and neither did the people or the cultures in which these sacred texts were written.&lt;ref name=Nongbri&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nongbri |first1=Brent |title=Before Religion: A History of a Modern Concept |date=2013 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=030015416X}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Greek word ''threskeia'', which was used by Greek writers such as Herodotus and Josephus and is found in texts like the New Testament, is sometimes translated as "religion" today, however, the term was understood as "worship" well into the medieval period.&lt;ref name=Nongbri /&gt; In the Quran, the Arabic word ''din'' is often translated as "religion" in modern translations, but up to the mid-1600s translators expressed ''din'' as "law".&lt;ref name=Nongbri /&gt; Even in the 1st century AD, Josephus had used the Greek term ''ioudaismos'', which some translate as "Judaism" today, even though he used it as an ethnic term, not one linked to modern abstract concepts of religion as a set of beliefs.&lt;ref name=Nongbri /&gt;  It was in the 19th century that the terms "Buddhism", "Hinduism", "Taoism", and "Confucianism" first emerged.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Invention Japan"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Josephson |first1=Jason Ananda |title=The Invention of Religion in Japan |date=2012 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0226412342}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout its long history, Japan had no concept of "religion" since there was no corresponding Japanese word, nor anything close to its meaning, but when American warships appeared off the coast of Japan in 1853 and forced the Japanese government to sign treaties demanding, among other things, freedom of religion, the country had to contend with this Western idea.&lt;ref name="Invention Japan" /&gt;

According to the [[philologist]] [[Max Müller]] in the 19th century, the root of the English word "religion", the [[Latin]] ''[[:wikt:religio|religio]]'', was originally used to mean only "reverence for God or the gods, careful pondering of divine things, [[pietas|piety]]" (which [[Cicero]] further derived to mean "diligence").&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]], ''Natural Religion'', p. 33 (1889)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2340976 Lewis &amp; Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Müller]] characterized many other cultures around the world, including Egypt, Persia, and India, as having a similar power structure at this point in history. What is called ancient religion today, they would have only called "law".&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]]. ''[https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA28&amp;id=aM0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;as_brr=4 Introduction to the science of religion]''. p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some languages have words that can be translated as "religion", but they may use them in a very different way, and some have no word for religion at all. For example, the [[Sanskrit]] word [[dharma]], sometimes translated as "religion", also means law. Throughout classical [[South Asia]], the [[Dharmaśāstra|study of law]] consisted of concepts such as [[Prāyaścitta|penance through piety]] and [[Ācāra|ceremonial as well as practical traditions]]. Medieval Japan at first had a similar union between "imperial law" and universal or "Buddha law", but these later became independent sources of power.&lt;ref&gt;[[Toshio Kuroda|Kuroda, Toshio]] and Jacqueline I. Stone, translator. {{cite web|url=http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/jjrs/pdf/477.pdf |title="The Imperial Law and the Buddhist Law" |accessdate=2010-05-28 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030323095019/http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/jjrs/pdf/477.pdf |archivedate=23 March 2003 |df= }}.

There is no precise equivalent of "religion" in Hebrew, and [[Judaism]] does not distinguish clearly between religious, national, racial, or ethnic identities.&lt;ref&gt;Hershel Edelheit, Abraham J.

The [[Crusades]] against [[Muslim conquests|Muslim expansion]] in the 11th century was recognized as a "holy war" or ''bellum sacrum'' by later writers in the 17th century. The early modern wars against the [[Ottoman Empire]] were seen as a seamless continuation of this conflict by contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. ''Bellum sacrum Ecclesiae militantis contra Turcum'' by Léonard de Vaux (1685).&lt;/ref&gt;
The term "religious war" was used to describe, controversially at the time, what are now known as the [[European wars of religion]], and especially the then-ongoing [[Seven Years' War]],  from at least the mid 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Mauduit, ''Considerations on the Present German War'', 1760, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lrBJAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA25 p. 25].
John Entick, ''The General History of the Later War'', Volume 3, 1763, [https://books.google.com/books?id=21pSAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA110&amp;dq=%22religious+war%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=COoAUrOGNoGJ4ASK14HYAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22religious%20war%22&amp;f=false p. 110].&lt;!-- both these authors argue *against* the designation --&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

In their ''Encyclopedia of Wars'', authors [[Charles Phillips (historian)|Charles Phillips]] and [[Alan Axelrod]] document 1763 notable wars in world history. They note that before the 17th century, much of the "reasons" for conflicts were explained through the lens of religion and that after that time wars were explained through the lens of wars as a way to further sovereign interests. They note, "Wars have always arisen, and arise today, from territorial disputes, military rivalries, conflicts of ethnicity, and strivings for commercial and economic advantage, and they have always depended on, and depend on today, pride, prejudice, coercion, envy, cupidity, competitiveness, and a sense of injustice. But for much of the world before the 17th century, these “reasons” for war were explained and justified, at least for the participants, by religion. Then, around the middle of the 17th century, Europeans began to conceive of war as a legitimate means of furthering the interests of individual sovereigns."&lt;ref name="Axelrod, Alan 2004"/&gt; Some commentators have concluded that only 123 wars (7%) out of these 1763 wars were fundamentally originated by religious motivations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sheiman|first1=Bruce|title=An Atheist Defends Religion : Why Humanity is Better Off with Religion than Without It|date=2009|publisher=Alpha Books.|isbn=1592578543|pages=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Day|first1=Vox|title=The Irrational Atheist: Dissecting the Unholy Trinity of Dawkins, Harris, and Hitchens|date=2008|publisher=BenBella Books|isbn=1933771364|pages=104–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lurie|first1=Alan|title=Is Religion the Cause of Most Wars?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rabbi-alan-lurie/is-religion-the-cause-of-_b_1400766.html|website=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious wars account for less than 2% of all people killed in warfare. This includes 3 million during the Crusades and 3,000 during the Inquisition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestarpress.com/story/life/faith/2015/11/20/burkes-religion-responsible-most-wars/76039940/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---indirect---&gt;

''The Encyclopedia of War'', edited by Gordon Martel, using the criteria that the armed conflict must involve some overt religious action, concludes that 6% of the wars listed in their encyclopedia can be labelled religious wars.&lt;ref&gt;"The Encyclopedia of War" by Gordon Martel (17 Jan 2012, 2912 pages)&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2015}}

[[William T. Cavanaugh]] in his ''Myth of Religious Violence'' (2009) argues that what is termed "religious wars" is a largely "Western dichotomy" and a modern invention, arguing that all wars that are classed as "religious" have secular (economic or political) ramifications.&lt;ref name="Cavanaugh"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cavanaugh|first1=William T.|title=The Myth of Religious Violence : Secular Ideology and the Roots of Modern Conflict|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-538504-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar opinions were expressed as early as the 1760s, during the [[Seven Years' War]], widely recognized to be "religious" in motivation, noting that the warring factions were not necessarily split along confessional lines as much as along secular interests.&lt;ref name="p. 110"/&gt;

It is evident that [[religion]] as one aspect of a people's [[cultural heritage]] may serve as a cultural marker or ideological rationalisation for a conflict that has deeper ethnic and cultural differences. This has been specifically argued for the case of [[The Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]], often portrayed as a religious conflict of a Catholic vs. a Protestant faction, while the more fundamental cause of the conflict  was in fact ethnic or nationalistic rather than religious in nature.&lt;ref name="McGarry J 1995"&gt;McGarry J, O'Leary B, 1995. ''Explaining Northern Ireland: Broken Images.'' Oxford, Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; Since the native Irish were mostly Catholic and the later British-sponsored immigrants were mainly Protestant, the terms become shorthand for the two cultures, but it is inaccurate to describe the conflict as a religious one.&lt;ref name="McGarry J 1995"/&gt;

According to Irfan Omar and Michael Duffey's review of violence and peacemaking in world religions, they note that studies of supposed cases of religious violence often conclude that violence is strongly driven by ethnic animosities.&lt;ref name="Omar"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Omar|editor1-first=Irfan|editor2-last=Duffey|editor2-first=Michael|title=Peacemaking and the Challenge of Violence in World Religions|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9781118953426|page=1|ref=Omar Peacemaking|chapter=Introduction|quote=This book does not ignore violence committed in the name of religion. Analyses of case studies of seeming religious violence often conclude that violence is strongly driven by ethnic animosities.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The concept of "Holy War" in individual religious traditions==

While early empires could be described as [[henotheistic]], i.e. dominated by a single god of the ruling elite (as [[Marduk]] in the [[Babylonian empire]], [[Assur (god)|Assur]] in the [[Assyrian empire]], etc.), or more directly by deifing the ruler in an [[imperial cult]], the concept of "Holy War" enters a new phase with the development of [[monotheism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Kirsch  ''God Against The Gods: The History of the War Between Monotheism and Polytheism'', Penguin, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient warfare and polytheism===
{{further|Ancient warfare|Polytheism|God of war|}}

[[Classical Antiquity]] had a [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] with particular attributes and interest areas.  [[Ares]] personified war. While he received occasional sacrifice from armies going to war, there was only a very limited "cult of Ares".&lt;ref name="Burkert, p. 170"&gt;Burkert, ''Greek Religion'', p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sparta]], however, each company of youths sacrificed to [[Enyalios]] before engaging in ritual fighting at the Phoebaeum.&lt;ref&gt;"Here each company of youths sacrifices a puppy to Enyalius, holding that the most valiant of tame animals is an acceptable victim to the most valiant of the gods. I know of no other Greeks who are accustomed to sacrifice puppies except the people of [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]]; these too sacrifice a puppy, a black bitch, to the Wayside Goddess." [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], 3.14.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===

In early Christianity, St. Augustine's concept of [[Just war theory|just war]] (''bellum iustum'') was widely accepted, but warfare was not regarded as a virtuous activity&lt;ref name="Peters First" /&gt;&lt;ref name="usna"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abels|first1=Richard|title=Timeline for the Crusades and Christian Holy War|url=http://www.usna.edu/Users/history/abels/hh315/crusades_timeline.htm|website=US Naval Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expressions of concern for the salvation of those who killed enemies in battle, regardless of the cause for which they fought, was common.&lt;ref name="Peters First" /&gt; According to historian Edward Peters, before the 11th century Christians had not developed a concept of "Holy War" (''bellum sacrum''), whereby fighting itself might be considered a penitential and spiritually meritorious act.&lt;ref name="Peters First"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peters|first1=Edward|title=The First Crusade: The Chronicle of Fulcher of Chartres and Other Source Materials|date=1998|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=0812216563|edition=2|chapter=Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PSOSJWG3E2MC&amp;pg=PA8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levine War" /&gt; During the 9th and 10th centuries, multiple invasions occurred which lead some regions to make their own armies to defend themselves and this slowly lead to the emergence of the Crusades, the concept of "holy war", and terminology such as "enemies of God" in the 11th century.&lt;ref name="Peters First" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Levine War"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Levine|first1=David|title=Conflicts of Ideology in Christian and Muslim Holy War|url=https://www.binghamton.edu/history/resources/journal-of-history/david-levine.html|publisher=Binghamton University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time of the Crusades, some of those who fought in the name of God were recognized as the ''[[Miles Christianus|Milites Christi]]'', soldiers or knights of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Tyerman, Christopher. The Crusades: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford University Press, London, 2004. PP. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Crusades]] were a series of military campaigns that took place during the 11th through 13th centuries against the [[Muslim Conquests]]. Originally, the goal was to recapture [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Holy Land]] from the [[Islam|Muslims]], and support the besieged Christian [[Byzantine Empire]] against the [[Muslim]] [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] expansion into Asia Minor and Europe proper. Later, Crusades were launched against other targets, either for religious reasons, such as the [[Albigensian Crusade]], the [[Northern Crusades]], or because of political conflict, such as the [[Aragonese Crusade]]. In 1095, at the [[Council of Clermont]], [[Pope Urban II]] raised the level of war from ''[[bellum iustum]]'' ("just war"), to ''bellum sacrum'' ("holy war").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbn.com/spirituallife/ChurchAndMinistry/ChurchHistory/Crusades_CanerChristianJihad0505.asp |title=Christian Jihad: The Crusades and Killing in the Name of Christ |publisher=Cbn.com |accessdate=20 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709000007/http://www.cbn.com/spirituallife/ChurchAndMinistry/ChurchHistory/Crusades_CanerChristianJihad0505.asp |archivedate=9 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 16th-century France there was a succession of wars between [[Roman Catholics]] and [[Protestants]] ([[Hugenots]] primarily), known as the [[French Wars of Religion]]. In the first half of the 17th century, the [[Germany|German]] states, Scandinavia ([[Sweden]], primarily) and [[Poland]] were beset by religious warfare in the [[Thirty Years War]]. [[Roman Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism]] figured in the opposing sides of this conflict, though Catholic [[France]] did take the side of the Protestants but purely for political reasons.

The [[Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]], known in Arab history as the Battle of Al-Uqab (معركة العقاب), took place on 16 July 1212 and was an important turning point in the ''[[Reconquista]]'' and in the [[Spain in the Middle Ages|medieval history of Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Lynn Hunt]] describes the battle as a "major turning point in the reconquista..."  See Lynn Hunt, R. Po-chia Hsia, Thomas R. Martin, Barbara H. Rosenwein, and Bonnie Smith, ''The Making of the West: Peoples and Cultures: A Concise History: Volume I: To 1740'', Second Edition (New York: Bedford/St. Martin's 2007), 391.&lt;/ref&gt;  The forces of King [[Alfonso VIII of Castile]] were joined by the armies of his [[Christian]] rivals, [[Sancho VII of Navarre]], [[Pedro II of Aragon]] and [[Afonso II of Portugal]] in battle&lt;ref&gt;Guggenberger, Anthony, ''A General History of the Christian Era: The Papacy and the Empire'', Vol.1, (B. Herder, 1913), 372.&lt;/ref&gt; against the [[Berber people|Berber]] [[Muslim]] [[Almohad]] conquerors of the southern half of the [[Iberian Peninsula]].

===Islam===
{{further|Jihad|Early Muslim conquests|Ghazi (warrior)}}

The [[Muslim conquests]] were a military expansion on an unprecedented scale, beginning in the lifetime of [[Muhammad]] and spanning the centuries, down to the [[Ottoman wars in Europe]].  Until the 13th century, the Muslim conquests were those of a more or less coherent [[empire]], the [[Caliphate]], but after the [[Mongol invasions]], expansion continued on all fronts (other than Iberia which was lost in the [[Reconquista]]) for another half millennium until the final collapse of the [[Mughal Empire]] in the east  and the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the west with the onset of the [[modernity|modern period]].

There were also a number of periods of infighting among Muslims; these are known by the term [[Fitna (word)|Fitna]] and mostly concern the early period of Islam, from the 7th to 11th centuries, i.e. before the collapse of the Caliphate and the emergence of the various later [[Islamic empires]].

While technically, the millennium of Muslim conquests could be classified as "religious war", the applicability of the term has been questioned.
The reason is that the very notion of a "religious war" as opposed to a "secular war" is the result of the Western concept of the  [[separation of Church and State]]. No such division has ever existed in the Islamic world, and consequently there cannot be a real division between wars that are "religious" from such that are "non-religious". Islam does not have any normative tradition of [[pacifism]], and warfare has been integral part of Islamic history both for the defense and the spread of the faith since the time of Muhammad. This was formalised in the juristic definition of [[Islam and war|war in Islam]], which continues to hold normative power in contemporary Islam,  inextricably linking political and religious justification of war.&lt;ref&gt;James Turner Johnson, ''The Holy War Idea in Western and Islamic Traditions'',  Pennsylvania State University Press, 1997,  {{ISBN|9780271042145}}, chapter 1, esp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=IoEjpRsvuzUC&amp;pg=PA2%200 pp. 20–25].&lt;/ref&gt; This normative concept is known as ''[[Jihad]]'', an Arabic word with the meaning "to strive; to struggle" (viz. "in the way of God"), which includes the aspect of struggle "by the sword".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Khadduri|first1=Majid|title=
War and Peace in the Law of Islam|publisher=Johns Hopkins Press|year=1955|pages=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first forms of military Jihad occurred after the migration ([[Hijra (Islam)|hijra]]) of Muhammad and his small group of followers to [[Medina]] from [[Mecca]] and the conversion of several inhabitants of the city to Islam. The first revelation concerning the struggle against the Meccans was surah 22, verses 39-40:&lt;ref&gt;William M. Watt: ''Muhammad at Medina'', p.4; q.v. the [[Tafsir]] regarding these verses&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|To those against whom war is made, permission is given (to fight), because they are wronged;- and verily, Allah is most powerful for their aid. (They are) those who have been expelled from their homes in defiance of right,- (for no cause) except that they say, "our Lord is Allah". Did not Allah check one set of people by means of another, there would surely have been pulled down monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques, in which the name of Allah is commemorated in abundant measure. Allah will certainly aid those who aid his (cause);- for verily Allah is full of Strength, Exalted in Might, (able to enforce His Will).|Abdullah Yusuf Ali}}
This happened many times throughout history, beginning with [[Muhammad]]'s battles against the [[polytheist]] Arabs including the [[Battle of Badr]] (624), and battles in [[Uhud]] (625), [[Battle of the Trench|Khandaq]] (627), [[Mecca]] (630) and [[Battle of Hunayn|Hunayn]] (630).

===Judaism===
{{Main|Milkhemet Mitzvah}}

In the [[Jewish]] religion, the expression ''Milkhemet Mitzvah'' ([[Hebrew]]: מלחמת מצווה, "[[Mitzvah|commandment]] [[war]]") refers to a war that is obligatory for all Jews (men and women). Such wars were limited to territory within the borders of [[Eretz Israel|the land of Israel]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} The geographical limits of Israel and conflicts with surrounding nations are detailed in the [[Tanakh]], the [[Hebrew Bible]], especially in Numbers 34:1-15 and Ezekiel 47:13-20. The concept of a religious war was absent in Jewish thought for approximately 2000 years, though it reemerged in some factions of the [[Zionist movement]], particularly [[Revisionist Zionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Holy War in Judaism: The Fall and Rise of a Controversial Idea&lt;/ref&gt; "From the earliest days of Israel's existence as a people, holy war was a sacred institution, undertaken as a cultic act of a religious community.&lt;ref&gt;Marva J. Dawn, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ezaCr3i3JeIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en Holy War in Ancient Israel]'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Reuven Firestone, ""Holy War" is a Western concept referring to war that is fought for religion, against adherents of other religions, often in order to promote religion through conversion, and with no specific geographic limitation. This concept does not occur in the Hebrew Bible, whose wars are not fought for religion or in order to promote it but, rather, in order to preserve religion and a religiously unique people in relation to a specific and limited geography."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Firestone|first1=Reuven|title=Holy War Idea in the Hebrew Bible|url=http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/private/cmje/issues/more_issues/Holy_War_in_the_Hebrew_Bible.pdf|publisher=USC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] can be viewed primarily as an [[ethnic conflict]] between two parties where one party is most often portrayed as a singular ethno-religious group consisting only of the Jewish majority and ignores non-Jewish minority Israeli citizens who at varying levels support a [[State of Israel|Zionist state]], especially the [[Druze]] and [[Circassians]] who for example volunteer in higher numbers for [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] combat service and are represented in the [[Knesset|Israeli parliament]] in greater percentages than Israeli Jews are&lt;ref&gt;http://journals.openedition.org/bcrfj/5911 In search of a lost time, construction of identity in the Circassian diaspora in Israel p.24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jonathan-adelman/the-druze-of-israel-hope-_b_8265050.html The Druze of Israel: Hope for Arab-Jewish Collaboration&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Israeli Arabs]], [[Samaritans]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ft.com/content/365747cc-07c4-11e6-a623-b84d06a39ec2 Financial Times - Samaritans form bridge of peace between Israelis and Palestinians&lt;/ref&gt; various other Christians, and [[Negev Bedouin]];&lt;ref&gt;https://english.alarabiya.net/en/perspective/profiles/2013/04/24/Bedouin-army-trackers-scale-Israel-social-ladder-.html  Al Arabiya - Muslim Arab Bedouins serve as Jewish state’s gatekeepers&lt;/ref&gt; the other party is sometimes presented as an ethnic group which is multi-religious (although most numerously consisting of Muslims, then Christians, then other religious groups up to and including Samaritans and even Jews). Yet despite the multi-religious composition of both of the parties in the conflict, elements on both sides often view it as a religious war between Jews and Muslims. In 1929, religious tensions between Muslim and Jewish Palestinians over Jews praying at the [[Wailing Wall]] led to the [[1929 Palestine riots]]&lt;ref name=segev&gt;{{cite book |last=Segev |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Segev |title=One Palestine, Complete |year=1999 |publisher=Metropolitan Books |isbn=0-8050-4848-0 |pages=295–313 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[1929 Hebron massacre|Hebron]] and [[1929 Safed pogrom|Safed]] ethnic cleansings of Jews.

In 1947, the UN decided on [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|partitioning]] the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate of Palestine]], led to the creation of the state of Israel and [[Jordan]] annexing the West Bank portion of the mandate, since then the region has been plagued with [[Arab–Israeli conflict|conflict]].

The [[All India Muslim League]] (AIML) was formed in [[Dhaka]] in 1906 by Muslims who were suspicious of the Hindu-majority [[Indian National Congress]]. They complained that Muslim members did not have the same rights as Hindu members. A number of different scenarios were proposed at various times.This was fuelled by the British policy of "Divide and Rule", which they tried to bring upon every political situation. Among the first to make the demand for a separate state was the writer/philosopher [[Allama Iqbal]], who, in his presidential address to the 1930 convention of the Muslim League said that a separate nation for Muslims was essential in an otherwise [[Hindu]]-dominated subcontinent.

After the dissolution of the [[British Raj]] in 1947, two new sovereign nations were formed—the [[Union of India]] and the [[Dominion of Pakistan]]. The subsequent [[Partition of India|partition of the former British India]] displaced up to 12.5 million people, with estimates of loss of life varying from several hundred thousand to a million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|pp=221–222}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[India]] emerged as a [[secularism in India|secular nation]] with a [[Hinduism in India|Hindu majority]], while [[Pakistan]] was established as an [[Islamic republic]] with [[Islam in Pakistan|Muslim majority]] population.&lt;ref name="Indian Census"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/India_at_glance/religion.aspx|title=Census of India : Religious Composition|publisher=Censusindia.gov.in|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statpak.gov.pk/depts/pco/statistics/area_pop/area_pop.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222185234/http://www.statpak.gov.pk/depts/pco/statistics/area_pop/area_pop.html |date=22 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:YagbeaSionBattlingAdaSultan.JPG|thumb|left|[[Abyssinian–Adal war]] broke out in the [[Horn of Africa]] after the arrival of the [[Portuguese Empire]] in the region.]]

The [[Abyssinian–Adal war]] was a military conflict between the [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinians]] and the [[Adal Sultanate]] from 1529 until 1559. The [[Imam]] [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] (nicknamed ''Gurey'' in [[Somali language|Somali]] and ''Gragn'' in [[Amharic language|Amharic]] (ግራኝ ''Graññ''), both meaning "the left-handed") came close to extinguishing the ancient realm of Abyssinia, and forcibly converting all of its surviving subjects to [[Islam]]; the intervention of the European [[Cristóvão da Gama]], son of the famous navigator [[Vasco da Gama]], attempted to help to prevent this outcome but was killed by al-Ghazi. However, both polities exhausted their resources and manpower in this conflict, allowing the northward migration of the [[Oromo people|Oromo]] into their present homelands to the north and west of [[Addis Ababa]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Richard Pankhurst, ''The Ethiopians: A History'' (Oxford: Blackwell, 2001), pp. 96f and sources cited therein.&lt;/ref&gt; Many historians trace the origins of hostility between [[Somalia]] and Ethiopia to this war.&lt;ref&gt;For example, David D. Laitin and Said S. Samatar, ''Somalia: Nation in Search of a State'' (Boulder: Westview Press, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians also argue that this conflict proved, through their use on both sides, the value of [[firearms]] such as the [[matchlock]] [[musket]], [[cannons]], and the [[arquebus]] over traditional weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge illustrated atlas, warfare: Renaissance to revolution, 1492–1792 By Jeremy Black p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nigerian conflict===
Inter-ethnic conflict in Nigeria has generally had a religious element. Riots against Igbo in 1953 and in the 1960s in the north were said to have been sparked by religious conflict.

Between June and July there was a mass exodus of Ibo from the north and west. Over 1.3 million Ibo fled the neighboring regions in order to escape persecution as anti-Ibo riots increased. The aftermath of the anti-Ibo riots led many to believe that security could only be gained by separating from the North.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,MARP,,NGA,,469f38c3467,0.html|title=Refworld - Chronology for Ibo in Nigeria|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|work=Refworld|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, serious outbreaks between Christians and Muslims occurred in [[Kafanchan]] in southern [[Kaduna State]] in a border area between the two religions.

The [[2010 Jos riots]] saw clashes between Muslim herders against Christian farmers near the volatile city of [[Jos]], resulting in hundreds of casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/2010/0308/Nigeria-violence-Muslim-Christian-clashes-kill-hundreds |title=Nigeria violence: Muslim-Christian clashes kill hundreds |publisher=CSMonitor.com |date=2010-03-08 |accessdate=16 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officials estimated that 500 people were massacred in night-time raids by rampaging Muslim gangs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article7054630.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=500 butchered in Nigeria killing fields | first1=Jonathan | last1=Clayton | first2=Ruth | last2=Gledhill | date=2010-03-08 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhist uprising===
During the rule of the Catholic [[Ngo Dinh Diem]] in [[South Vietnam]], the discrimination against the majority Buddhist population generated the growth of Buddhist institutions as they sought to participate in national politics and gain better treatment. The [[Buddhist Uprising]] of 1966 was a period of civil and military unrest in [[South Vietnam]], largely focused in the [[I Corps (South Vietnam)|I Corps]] area in the north of the country in central Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.war-stories.com/aspprotect/dn-poss-vc-nva-pow-camp-1965-1966-2.asp]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815093633/http://www.war-stories.com/aspprotect/dn-poss-vc-nva-pow-camp-1965-1966-2.asp |date=15 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a member of the [[Roman Catholicism in Vietnam|Catholic Vietnamese]] minority, he pursued pro-Catholic policies that antagonized many Buddhists.

===Chinese conflict===
The [[Dungan revolt (1862–1877)]] and [[Panthay Rebellion]] (1856–1873) by the [[Hui people|Hui]] were also set off by racial antagonism and class warfare, rather than the mistaken assumption that it was all due to Islam that the rebellions broke out.&lt;ref&gt;John Alexander Selbie, Louis Herbert Gray 1916 893&lt;/ref&gt; During the Dungan revolt fighting broke out between [[Uyghurs]] and Hui.

In 1936, after Sheng Shicai [[Kazakh exodus from Xinjiang|expelled 20,000 Kazakhs from Xinjiang to Qinghai]], the Hui led by General [[Ma Bufang]] massacred their fellow Muslims, the [[Kazakhs]], until there were only 135 of them left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=m98sAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=A+group+of+Kazakhs,+originally+numbering+over+20000+people+when+expelled+from+Sinkiang+by+Sheng+Shih-ts'ai+in+1936,+was+reduced,+after+repeated+massacres+by+their+Chinese+coreligionists+under+Ma+Pu-fang,+to+a+scattered+135+people&amp;dq=A+group+of+Kazakhs,+originally+numbering+over+20000+people+when+expelled+from+Sinkiang+by+Sheng+Shih-ts'ai+in+1936,+was+reduced,+after+repeated+massacres+by+their+Chinese+coreligionists+under+Ma+Pu-fang,+to+a+scattered+135+people|title=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Volume 277|author=American Academy of Political and Social Science|year=1951|publisher=American Academy of Political and Social Science|location=|page=152|isbn=|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NnY5AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=kazakhs+ma+pu-fang&amp;dq=kazakhs+ma+pu-fang|title=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Volumes 276-278|author=American Academy of Political and Social Science|year=1951|publisher=American Academy of Political and Social Science|location=|page=152|isbn=|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tensions with Uyghurs and Hui arose because Qing and Republican Chinese authorities used Hui troops and officials to dominate the Uyghurs and crush Uyghur revolts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tfWq65DlGxkC&amp;pg=PA311&amp;lpg=PA311&amp;dq=uighurs+hui+tension&amp;q=hui%20troops%20to%20dominate%20the%20uyghurs|title=Xinjiang: China's Muslim borderland|author=S.

This dramatic increase in the Hui population led inevitably to significant tensions between the Hui and Uyghur Muslim populations. Some old Uyghurs in [[Kashgar]] remember that the Hui army at the [[Battle of Kashgar (1934)]] massacred 2,000 to 8,000 Uyghurs, which caused tension as more Hui moved into Kashgar from other parts of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GXj4a3gss8wC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=THis+dramatic+increase+in+the+hui+population+led+inevitably+to+significant+tensions+between+the+hui+and&amp;q=This%20dramatic%20increase%20in%20the%20hui%20population%20led%20inevitably%20to%20significant%20tensions%20between%20the%20hui%20and|title=Xinjiang: China's Muslim borderland|author=S.

===Lebanese Civil War===
[[File:Beirut- building from before civil war.jpeg|thumb|War-damaged buildings in Beirut]]
There is no consensus among scholars on what triggered the Lebanese Civil War. However, the militarization of the [[Palestinian refugee]] population, with the arrival of the [[PLO]] guerrilla forces did spark an [[arms race]] amongst the different [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] political factions. However the conflict played out along three religious lines, [[Sunni Muslim]], [[Christian Lebanese]] and [[Shiite Muslim]], [[Druze]] are considered among Shiite Muslims.

It has been argued that the antecedents of the war can be traced back to the conflicts and political compromises reached after the end of Lebanon's administration by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The [[Cold War]] had a powerful disintegrative effect on Lebanon, which was closely linked to the [[Polarization (politics)|polarization]] that preceded the [[1958 Lebanon crisis|1958 political crisis]]. During the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] an exodus of [[Palestinian refugees]] who [[1948 Palestinian exodus|fled the fighting or were expelled from their homes]], arrived in Lebanon. Palestinians came to play a very important role in future Lebanese civil conflicts, whilst the establishment of Israel radically changed the local environment in which Lebanon found itself.

Lebanon was promised independence and on 22 November 1943 it was achieved. [[Free France|Free French troops]], who had invaded Lebanon in 1941 to rid Beirut of the [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] forces, left the country in 1946. The Christians assumed power over the country and economy. A confessional parliament was created, where Muslims and Christians were given quotas of seats in parliament. As well, the President was to be a Christian, the Prime Minister a Sunni Muslim and the Speaker of Parliament a Shia Muslim.

In March 1991, parliament passed an [[amnesty law]] that pardoned all political crimes prior to its enactment. The amnesty was not extended to crimes perpetrated against foreign diplomats or certain crimes referred by the cabinet to the Higher Judicial Council. In May 1991, the militias (with the important exception of [[Hezbollah]]) were dissolved, and the [[Military of Lebanon|Lebanese Armed Forces]] began to slowly rebuild themselves as Lebanon's only major non-sectarian institution.

Some violence still occurred. In late December 1991 a car bomb (estimated to carry 220 pounds of TNT) exploded in the Muslim neighborhood of [[Basta, Lebanon|Basta]]. At least thirty people were killed, and 120 wounded, including former Prime Minister [[Shafik Wazzan]], who was riding in a bulletproof car.

===Yugoslav Wars===
{{main|Yugoslav Wars}} {{see also|Foreign fighters in the Bosnian War}}
The [[Croatian War]] (1991–95) and [[Bosnian War]] (1992–95), have been viewed of as religious wars between the Orthodox, Catholic and Muslim populations of former [[Yugoslavia]], that is, [[Serbs]], [[Croats]] and [[Bosniaks]].&lt;ref name="RadeljićTopić2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Branislav Radeljić|author2=Martina Topić|title=Religion in the Post-Yugoslav Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0VEiCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5|date=1 July 2015|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-1-4985-2248-9|pages=5–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BoyleSheen1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kevin Boyle|author2=Juliet Sheen|title=Freedom of Religion and Belief: A World Report|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PxXIwVPran0C&amp;pg=PA409|year=1997|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-15977-7|pages=409 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional religious symbols were used during the wars.&lt;ref&gt;Velikonja, Mitja.

===Sudanese Civil War===
The [[Second Sudanese Civil War]] from 1983 to 2005 have describe the conflict as an [[ethnoreligious]] one where the Muslim central government's pursuits to impose sharia law on non-Muslim southerners led to violence, and eventually to the civil war. The war resulted in the independence of [[South Sudan]] six years after the war ended.

Opposition to the sharia, especially to the application of hudud (sing., hadd), or Islamic penalties, such as the public amputation of hands for theft, was not confined to the south and had been a principal factor leading to the popular uprising of April 1985 that overthrew the government of Jaafar an Nimeiri | accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sudan/facts.html |title=PBS Frontline: "Civil war was sparked in 1983 when the military regime tried to impose sharia law as part of its overall policy to "Islamicize" all of Sudan." |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://media.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/world/pdf/darfur_040707.pdf |quotation=The war flared again in 1983 after then-President Jaafar Nimeri abrogated the peace accord and announced he would turn Sudan into a Muslim Arab state, where Islamic law, or sharia, would prevail, including in the southern provinces.

{{Salvation}}

'''Resurrection''' is the concept of coming back to life after [[death]]. In a number of ancient religions, a [[dying-and-rising god]] is a deity which dies and resurrects. 

The [[resurrection of the dead]] is a standard [[Eschatology|eschatological]] belief in the [[Abrahamic religions]]. As a religious concept, it is used in two distinct respects: a belief in the resurrection of individual [[soul]]s that is current and ongoing ([[Idealism (Christian eschatology)|Christian idealism]], [[realized eschatology]]), or else a belief in a singular [[resurrection of the dead]] at the [[End of the world (religion)|end of the world]]. Some believe the soul is the actual vehicle by which people are resurrected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gregory of Nyssa: "On the Soul and the Resurrection:" However far from each other their natural propensity and their inherent forces of repulsion urge them, and debar each from mingling with its opposite, none the less will the soul be near each by its power of recognition, and will persistently cling to the familiar atoms, until their concourse after this division again takes place in the same way, for that fresh formation of the dissolved body which will properly be, and be called, resurrection |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf205.x.iii.ii.html |publisher=Ccel.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Crucifixion of Jesus|death]] and [[resurrection of Jesus]], an example of resurrection, is the central focus of [[Christianity]]. Christian theological debate ensues with regard to what kind of resurrection is factual&amp;nbsp;– either a ''spiritual'' resurrection with a [[spirit]] body into [[Heaven]], or a material resurrection with a restored [[human body]].&lt;ref&gt;As in the [[Apostle's Creed]]: "I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting."  [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12792a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: General Resurrection]: "Resurrection is the rising again from the dead, the resumption of life. The [[Fourth Lateran Council]] (1215) teaches that all men, whether [[Chosen people#Christianity|elect]] or [[reprobate]], "will rise again with their own bodies which they now bear about with them" (chapter "''Firmiter''"). In the language of the [[creed]]s and professions of faith this return to life is called resurrection of the body (''resurrectio carnis, resurrectio mortuoram, anastasis ton nekron'') for a double reason: first, since the [[Immortality of the soul|soul cannot die]], it cannot be said to return to life; second the [[heretical]] contention of [[Hymenaeus (Ephesian)|Hymeneus and Philitus]] that the [[Scriptures]] denote by resurrection not the return to life of the body, but the rising of the soul from the death of [[Christian views on sin|sin]] to the life of [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]], must be excluded."&lt;/ref&gt; While most Christians believe [[Resurrection of Jesus|Jesus' resurrection from the dead]] and [[Ascension of Jesus|ascension to Heaven]] was in a material body, a very small minority believe it was spiritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=R. C. |last=Symes |title=According to Paul of Tarsus, the resurrection transformed Jesus into the Christ, the Son of God and Savior of the world. Christ's resurrected body was not a resuscitated physical body, but a new body of a spiritual/celestial nature: the natural body comes first and then the spiritual body (1 Cor. 15:46). Paul never says that the earthly body becomes immortal. |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/symes01.htm |publisher=religioustolerance.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Watchtower Society claims that Jesus was not raised in His actual physical human body, but rather was raised as an invisible spirit being—what He was before, the archangel Michael.  They believe that Christ's post-Resurrection appearances on earth were on-the-spot manifestations and materializations of flesh and bones, with different forms, that the Apostles did not immediately recognize.  Their explanation for the statement "a spirit hath not flesh and bones" is that Christ was saying that he was not a ghostly apparition, but a true materialization in flesh, to be seen and touched, as proof that he was actually raised. But that, in fact, the risen Christ was, in actuality, a divine spirit being, who made himself visible and invisible at will.  The Christian Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses believes that Christ’s perfect manhood was forever sacrificed at Calvary, and that it was not actually taken back. They state: "...in his resurrection he ‘became a life-giving spirit.’ That was why for most of the time he was invisible to his faithful apostles... He needs no human body any longer... The human body of flesh, which Jesus Christ laid down forever as a ransom sacrifice, was disposed of by God’s power."—Things in Which it is Impossible for God to Lie, pages 332, 354.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gospel-mysteries.net/resurrection-theories.html |title=Resurrection Theories |publisher=Gospel-mysteries.net |date= |accessdate=2013-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are documented rare cases of the return to life of the [[Clinical death|clinically dead]] which are classified scientifically as examples of the [[Lazarus syndrome]], a term originating from the biblical story of the [[resurrection of Lazarus]].

==Etymology==
Resurrection, from the Latin noun ''resurrectio -onis'', from the verb ''rego'', "to make straight, rule" + preposition ''sub'', "under", altered to ''subrigo'' and [[Syncope (phonology)|contracted to]] ''surgo, surrexi, surrectum'' ("to rise", "get up", "stand up"&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Ernst Georges]], Ferruccio Badellino, Oreste Calonghi, ''Dizionario Latino-Italiano'' (''Latin to Italian dictionary''), Rosenberg &amp; Sellier, 3rd edition, [[Turin]], 1989, 2.957 pages&lt;/ref&gt;) + preposition ''re-'', "again",&lt;ref&gt;Cassell's Latin Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; thus literally "a straightening from under again".

==Religion==

===Ancient religions in the Near East===
{{See also|Dying-and-rising god}}
The concept of resurrection is found in the writings of some ancient non-Abrahamic religions in the [[Middle East]]. A few extant [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] and [[Canaan]]ite writings allude to [[Life-death-rebirth deity|dying and rising gods]] such as [[Osiris]] and [[Baal]]. Sir [[James Frazer]] in his book ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' relates to these dying and rising gods,&lt;ref&gt;Sir [[James Frazer]] (1922). ''The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion'' Ware: Wordsworth 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; but many of his examples, according to various scholars, distort the sources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Z. Smith]] "Dying and Rising Gods" in Mircea Eliade (ed.) ''The Encyclopedia of Religion: Vol. 3''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster Macmillan 1995: 521-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Taking a more positive position, [[Tryggve Mettinger]] argues in his recent book that the category of rise and return to life is significant for the following deities: Ugaritic [[Baal]], [[Melqart]], [[Adonis]], [[Eshmun]], [[Osiris]] and [[Tammuz (deity)|Dumuzi]].&lt;ref&gt;Mettinger, ''Riddle of Resurrection'', 55-222.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Greek religion===
In [[ancient Greek religion]] a number of men and women were made physically [[Immortality|immortal]] as they were resurrected from the dead. [[Asclepius]] was killed by Zeus, only to be resurrected and transformed into a major deity. [[Achilles]], after being killed, was snatched from his funeral pyre by his divine mother [[Thetis]] and resurrected, brought to an immortal existence in either Leuce, [[Elysium|Elysian plains]] or the [[Fortunate Isles|Islands of the Blessed]]. [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]], who was killed by Achilles, seems to have received a similar fate. [[Alcmene]], [[Castor and Pollux|Castor]], [[Heracles]], and [[Melicertes]], were also among the figures sometimes considered to have been resurrected to physical immortality. According to [[Herodotus]]'s [[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]], the seventh century BC sage [[Aristeas of Proconnesus]] was first found dead, after which his body disappeared from a locked room. Later he found not only to have been resurrected but to have gained immortality.

Many other figures, like a great part of those who fought in the [[Trojan war|Trojan]] and Theban wars, [[Menelaus]], and the historical pugilist [[Cleomedes of Astupalaea]], were also believed to have been made physically immortal, but without having died in the first place. Indeed, in Greek religion, immortality originally always included an eternal union of body and soul. The philosophical idea of an [[immortal soul]] was a later invention, which, although influential, never had a breakthrough in the Greek world. As may be witnessed even into the [[Christian era]], not least by the complaints of various philosophers over popular beliefs, traditional Greek believers maintained the conviction that certain individuals were resurrected from the dead and made physically immortal and that for the rest of us, we could only look forward to an existence as disembodied and dead souls.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erwin Rohde]] ''Psyche: The Cult of Souls and Belief in Immortality among the Greeks''. New York 1925 [1921]&lt;/ref&gt;

This traditional religious belief in physical immortality was generally denied by the [[Greek philosophers]]. Writing his ''Lives of Illustrious Men'' ([[Parallel Lives]]) in the first century CE, the [[Middle Platonism|Middle Platonic]] philosopher [[Plutarch]]'s chapter on [[Romulus]] gave an account of the mysterious disappearance and subsequent deification of this first king of Rome, comparing it to traditional Greek beliefs such as the resurrection and physical immortalization of Alcmene and Aristeas the [[Proconnesian]], "for they say Aristeas died in a fuller's work-shop, and his friends coming to look for him, found his body vanished; and that some presently after, coming from abroad, said they met him traveling towards Croton." Plutarch openly scorned such beliefs held in traditional ancient Greek religion, writing, "many such improbabilities do your fabulous writers relate, deifying creatures naturally mortal."

The parallel between these traditional beliefs and the later resurrection of Jesus was not lost on the early Christians, as [[Justin Martyr]] argued: "when we say ... Jesus Christ, our teacher, was crucified and died, and rose again, and ascended into heaven, we propose nothing different from what you believe regarding those whom you consider sons of Zeus." (''1 Apol.'' 21). There is, however, no belief in a general resurrection in ancient Greek religion, as the Greeks held that not even the gods were able to recreate flesh that had been lost to decay, fire or consumption. The notion of a ''general'' resurrection of the dead was therefore apparently quite preposterous to the Greeks. This is made clear in [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]]'s [[Areopagus]] discourse. After having first told about the resurrection of Jesus, which makes the Athenians interested to hear more, Paul goes on, relating how this event relates to a general resurrection of the dead:
{{quote|
"Therefore having overlooked the times of ignorance, God is now declaring to men that all everywhere should repent, because He has fixed a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness through a Man whom He has appointed, having furnished proof to all men by raising Him from the dead." Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some began to sneer, but others said, `We shall hear you again concerning this.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2017:30-32;&amp;version=49 |title=Acts 17:30-32 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Judaism and Samaritanism===
{{main|Jewish eschatology}}
There are three explicit examples in the Hebrew Bible of people being resurrected from the dead:
* The prophet [[Elijah]] prays and God raises a young boy from death ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kings%2017:17-24;&amp;version=49; 1 Kings 17:17-24])
* [[Elisha]] raises the son of the Shunammite woman ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kings%204:32-37;&amp;version=49; 2 Kings 4:32-37]); this was the very same child whose birth he previously foretold ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kings%204:8-16;&amp;version=49; 2 Kings 4:8-16])
* A dead man's body that was thrown into the dead Elisha's tomb is resurrected when the body touches Elisha's bones ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kings%2013:21;&amp;version=49; 2 Kings 13:21])

During the [[Second Temple period|period of the Second Temple]], there developed a diversity of beliefs concerning the resurrection. The concept of resurrection of the physical body is found in [[2 Maccabees]], according to which it will happen through recreation of the flesh.&lt;ref&gt;2 Maccabees 7.11, 7.28.&lt;/ref&gt; Resurrection of the dead also appears in detail in the extra-canonical books of [[Book of Enoch|Enoch]],&lt;ref&gt;1 Enoch 61.5, 61.2.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch|Apocalypse of Baruch]],&lt;ref&gt;2 Baruch 50.2, 51.5&lt;/ref&gt; and [[2 Esdras]]. According to the British scholar in ancient Judaism [[Philip R. Davies]], there is “little or no clear reference … either to immortality or to resurrection from the dead” in the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;Philip R. Davies. “Death, Resurrection and Life After Death in the Qumran Scrolls” in Alan J. Avery-Peck &amp; Jacob Neusner (eds.) ''Judaism in Late Antiquity: Part Four: Death, Life-After-Death, Resurrection, and the World-To-Come in the Judaisms of Antiquity.'' Leiden 2000:209.&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Josephus]] and the New Testament record that the [[Sadducees]] did not believe in an [[afterlife]],&lt;ref&gt;Josephus Antiquities 18.16; Matthew 22.23; Mark 12.18; Luke 20.27; Acta 23.8.&lt;/ref&gt; but the sources vary on the beliefs of the [[Pharisees]]. The New Testament claims that the Pharisees believed in the resurrection, but does not specify whether this included the flesh or not.&lt;ref&gt;Acta 23.8.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Josephus]], who himself was a Pharisee, the Pharisees held that only the soul was immortal and the souls of good people will “pass into other bodies,” while “the souls of the wicked will suffer eternal punishment.”&lt;ref&gt;Josephus ''Jewish War'' 2.8.14; cf. ''Antiquities'' 8.14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], who also was a Pharisee,&lt;ref&gt;Acts 23.6, 26.5.&lt;/ref&gt; said that at the resurrection what is "sown as a natural body is raised a spiritual body."&lt;ref&gt;1 Corinthians 15.35-53&lt;/ref&gt; [[Book of Jubilees|Jubilees]] seems to refer to the resurrection of the soul only, or to a more general idea of an immortal soul.&lt;ref&gt;Jubilees 23.31&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Herbert C. Brichto, writing in Reform Judaism's ''[[Hebrew Union College Annual]]'', the family tomb is the central concept in understanding biblical views of the [[afterlife]].  Brichto states that it is "not mere sentimental respect for the physical remains that is...the motivation for the practice, but rather an assumed connection between proper [[sepulture]] and the condition of happiness of the deceased in the afterlife".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jewish Views of the Afterlife|last=Raphael|first=Simcha Paull|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2009|isbn=9780742562202|location=Lanham, MD|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Brichto, the early [[Israelites]] apparently believed that the graves of family, or tribe, united into one, and that this unified collectivity is to what the [[Biblical Hebrew]] term [[Sheol]] refers, the common Grave of humans. Although not well defined in the Tanakh, Sheol in this view was a subterranean underworld where the souls of the dead went after the body died.  The [[Babylonians]] had a similar underworld called [[Abzu|Aralu]], and the [[Greeks]] had one known as [[Hades]].  For biblical references to Sheol see Genesis 42:38, Isaiah 14:11, Psalm 141:7, Daniel 12:2, Proverbs 7:27 and Job 10:21,22, and 17:16, among others. According to Brichto,  other Biblical names for Sheol were: Abaddon (ruin), found in Psalm 88:11, Job 28:22 and Proverbs 15:11;  Bor (the pit), found in Isaiah 14:15, 24:22, Ezekiel 26:20; and Shakhat (corruption), found in Isaiah 38:17, Ezekiel 28:8.&lt;ref name="Kin, Cult p.8"&gt;Herbert Chanon Brichto "Kin, Cult, Land and Afterlife&amp;nbsp;– A Biblical Complex", Hebrew Union College Annual 44, p.8 (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
[[File:Pilon-risenchrist2.jpg|thumb|Resurrection of Jesus]]
In [[Christianity]], resurrection most critically concerns the [[resurrection of Jesus]], but also includes the resurrection of [[Judgment Day]] known as the resurrection of the dead by those Christians who subscribe to the [[Nicene Creed]] (which is the majority or [[Mainstream Christianity]]), as well as the resurrection miracles done by Jesus and the prophets of the [[Old Testament]] (see Judaism and Samaritanism below).

====Resurrection of Jesus====
{{main|Life-death-rebirth deity|Resurrection of Jesus|Easter|Resurrection appearances of Jesus}}
Christians regard the resurrection of Jesus as the central doctrine in Christianity. Others take the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation of Jesus]] to be more central; however, it is the [[Miracles of Jesus|miracles]]&amp;nbsp;– and particularly his resurrection&amp;nbsp;– which provide validation of his incarnation. According to Paul, the entire Christian faith hinges upon the centrality of the resurrection of Jesus and the hope for a life after death. The [[Apostle Paul]] wrote in his first letter to the Corinthians:
{{quote|
If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are to be pitied more than all men. But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|1 Corinthians|15:19-20|49}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Resurrection miracles====
[[File:Bonnat01.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''The Resurrection of Lazarus'', painting by [[Leon Bonnat]], France, 1857.]]
{{Main|Miracles of Jesus#Resurrection of the dead}}
During the [[Ministry of Jesus]] on earth, before his death, Jesus commissioned his [[Twelve Apostles]] to, among other things, raise the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Not in the [[Great Commission]] of the resurrected Jesus, but only in the so-called [[Matthew 10|''Lesser Commission'']] of Matthew, specifically {{bibleverse||Matthew|10:8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[New Testament]], Jesus is said to have raised several persons from death. These resurrections included the daughter of [[Jairus]] shortly after death, a young man in the midst of his own [[funeral]] procession, and [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]], who had been buried for four days. According to the [[Gospel of Matthew]], after Jesus's resurrection, many of those previously dead came out of their tombs and entered [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]], where they appeared to many.

Similar resurrections are credited to the [[twelve apostles|apostles]] and Catholic saints. In the [[Acts of the Apostles]], [[Saint Peter]] raised a woman named [[Dorcas]] (also called Tabitha), and [[Paul the Apostle]] revived a man named [[Eutychus]] who had fallen asleep and fell from a window to his death. Following the [[Apostolic Age]], many saints were said to resurrect the dead, as recorded in [[Orthodox Christian]] hagiographies.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} [[St Columba]] supposedly raised a boy from the dead in the land of Picts.&lt;ref&gt;Adomnan of Iona. Life of St Columba. Penguin books, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Christians understand these miraculous resurrections to be of a different nature than the resurrection of Jesus and the future resurrection of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.blueletterbible.org/faq/don_stewart/stewart.cfm?id=136 |title=What's the Difference between Resurrection and Resuscitation? |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130629200514/http://www.blueletterbible.org/faq/don_stewart/stewart.cfm?id=136 |archive-date=June 29, 2013 |dead-url=yes |access-date=June 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The raising of Lazarus and others from the dead could also be called "resuscitations" or "reanimations", since the life given to them is presumably temporary in nature. In contrast, the resurrection of Jesus and the future resurrection of the dead has abolished death once and for all (see {{bibleverse||Isaiah|25:8|31}}, {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|15:26|31}}, {{bibleverse|2|Timothy|1:10|31}}, {{bibleverse||Revelation|21:4|31}}).

====Resurrection of the dead====
{{main|Resurrection of the dead#Views in Christianity|Christian eschatology#Resurrection of the dead}}
Christianity started as a religious movement within 1st-century Judaism (late [[Second Temple Judaism]]), and it retains what the New Testament itself claims was the [[Pharisaic]] belief in the [[Pharisees#The afterlife|afterlife and Resurrection of the Dead]]. Whereas this belief was only one of many beliefs held about the [[World to Come]] in Second Temple Judaism, and was notably rejected by both the [[Sadducees]] and, according to [[Josephus]], the [[Pharisees]], this belief became dominant within [[Early Christianity]] and already in the Gospels of Luke and John included an insistence on the resurrection of the flesh. Most modern [[Christian churches]] continue to uphold the belief that there will be a final [[resurrection of the dead#Christianity|resurrection of the dead]] and [[World to Come#Christian eschatology|World to Come]], perhaps as prophesied by the Apostle Paul when he said: "...he hath appointed a day, in the which he will [[Last judgment|judge the world]]..." ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%2017:30-31;&amp;version=NASB Acts 17:31] KJV) and "...there shall be a resurrection of the dead, [[Universal resurrection|both of the just and unjust]]." ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2024:14-16;&amp;version=NASB Acts 24:15] KJV).

Belief in the resurrection of the dead, and Jesus' role as judge, is codified in the [[Apostles' Creed]], which is the fundamental creed of Christian [[baptismal]] faith. The [[Book of Revelation]] also makes many references about the [[Judgment Day|Day of Judgment]] when the dead will be raised.

====Difference from Platonic philosophy====
In Platonic philosophy and other Greek philosophical thought, at death the soul was said to leave the inferior body behind. The idea that Jesus was resurrected spiritually rather than physically even gained popularity among some Christian teachers, whom the author of [[1 John]] declared to be [[antichrist]]s. Similar beliefs appeared in the early church as [[Gnosticism]]. However, in Luke 24:39, the resurrected Jesus expressly states "behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Handle me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see I have."

=== Hinduism ===
There are folklore, stories, and extractions from certain holy texts that refer to resurrections. One major folklore is that of Savitri saving her husband's life from Yamraj. In the Ramayana, after Ravana was slayed by Rama in a great battle between good and evil, Rama requests the king of Gods, Indra, to restore the lives of all the monkeys who died in the great battle.

===Islam===
{{Main|Qiyama}}
Belief in the "Day of Resurrection", ''[[Qiyamah|Yawm al-Qiyāmah]]'' ({{lang-ar|يوم القيامة}}) is also crucial for Muslims. They believe the time of ''Qiyāmah'' is preordained by God but unknown to man. The trials and [[tribulation]]s preceding and during the ''Qiyāmah'' are described in the Qur'an and the [[hadith]], and also in the commentaries of [[Ulema|scholars]]. The Qur'an emphasizes [[Resurrection of the Dead|bodily resurrection]], a break from the [[pre-Islamic Arabia]]n understanding of death.&lt;ref&gt;See:

===Zen Buddhism===
There are stories in [[Buddhism]] where the power of resurrection was allegedly demonstrated in Chan or [[Zen]] tradition. One is the [[legend]] of [[Bodhidharma]], the Indian master who brought the [[Ekayana]] school of India to China that subsequently became Chan Buddhism.

The other is the passing of Chinese Chan master [[Fuke Zen|Puhua]] (J., Fuke) and is recounted in the Record of [[Linji Yixuan|Linji]] (J., [[Rinzai]]). Puhua was known for his unusual behavior and teaching style so it is no wonder that he is associated with an event that breaks the usual prohibition on displaying such powers. Here is the account from Irmgard Schloegl's "The Zen Teaching of Rinzai".

{{quote|
"One day at the street market Fuke was begging all and sundry to give him a robe. Everybody offered him one, but he did not want any of them. The master [Linji] made the superior buy a coffin, and when Fuke returned, said to him: "There, I had this robe made for you." Fuke shouldered the coffin, and went back to the street market, calling loudly: "Rinzai had this robe made for me! I am off to the East Gate to enter transformation" (to die)." The people of the market crowded after him, eager to look. Fuke said: "No, not today. Tomorrow, I shall go to the South Gate to enter transformation." And so for three days. Nobody believed it any longer. On the fourth day, and now without any spectators, Fuke went alone outside the city walls, and laid himself into the coffin. He asked a traveler who chanced by to nail down the lid.

The news spread at once, and the people of the market rushed there. On opening the coffin, they found that the body had vanished, but from high up in the sky they heard the ring of his hand bell."&lt;ref&gt;Schloegl, Irmgard; tr. "The Zen Teaching of Rinzai". Shambhala Publications, Inc., Berkeley, 1976. Page 76. {{ISBN|0-87773-087-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Technological resurrection ==
[[Cryonics]] is the [[Cryopreservation|low-temperature preservation of humans]] who cannot be sustained by contemporary medicine, with the hope that healing and resuscitation may be possible in the future.&lt;ref&gt;"What is Cryonics?". Alcor Foundation. Retrieved 2 December 2013. "Cryonics is an effort to save lives by using temperatures so cold that a person beyond help by today's medicine might be preserved for decades or centuries until a future medical technology can restore that person to full health."&lt;/ref&gt; Cryonics procedures ideally begin within minutes of cardiac arrest, and use [[cryoprotectants]] to prevent ice formation during cryopreservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1089/rej.2008.0661 |pmid=18321197|pmc=4733321|date=April 2008|last1=Best|first1=B. P.|title=Scientific justification of cryonics practice|journal=Rejuvenation Research|volume=11|issue=2|pages=493–503}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the idea of cryonics also includes preservation of people long after death because of the possibility that brain encoding memory structure and personality may still persist or be inferable in the future. Whether sufficient brain information still exists for cryonics to successfully preserve may be intrinsically unprovable by present knowledge. Therefore, most proponents of cryonics see it as an intervention with prospects for success that vary widely depending on circumstances.

[[Russian cosmism|Russian Cosmist]] [[Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov]] advocated resurrection of the dead using scientific methods. Fedorov tried to plan specific actions for scientific research of the possibility of restoring life and making it infinite. His first project is connected with collecting and synthesizing decayed remains of dead based on "knowledge and control over all atoms and molecules of the world". The second method described by Fedorov is genetic-hereditary. The revival could be done successively in the ancestral line: sons and daughters restore their fathers and mothers, they in turn restore their parents and so on. This means restoring the ancestors using the hereditary information that they passed on to their children. Using this genetic method it is only possible to create a [[identical twin|genetic twin]] of the dead person. It is necessary to give back the revived person his old mind, his personality. Fedorov speculates about the idea of "radial images" that may contain the personalities of the people and survive after death. Nevertheless, Fedorov noted that even if a soul is destroyed after death, Man will learn to restore it whole by mastering the forces of decay and fragmentation.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolai Berdyaev, The Religion of Resusciative Resurrection. "The Philosophy of the Common Task of N. F. Fedorov.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1994 book ''The Physics of Immortality'', American [[physicist]] [[Frank J. Tipler]], an expert on the [[general theory of relativity]],  presented his [[Omega Point (Tipler)|Omega Point Theory]] which outlines how a resurrection of the dead could take place at the end of the [[cosmos]].  He posits that humans will evolve into [[robots]] which will turn the entire [[cosmos]] into a [[supercomputer]] which will, shortly before the [[big crunch]], perform the resurrection within its [[cyberspace]], reconstructing formerly dead humans (from information captured by the [[supercomputer]] from the past [[light cone]] of the cosmos) as [[Avatar (computing)|avatars]] within its [[metaverse]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank J. Tipler, ''The Physics of Immortality: Modern Cosmology, God and the Resurrection of the Dead'' (New York: Doubleday, 1994), {{ISBN|0198519494}}. 56-page excerpt available [http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780385467995 here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Deutsch]], British [[physicist]] and pioneer in the field of [[quantum computing]], agrees with Tipler's Omega Point cosmology and the idea of resurrecting deceased people with the help of quantum computers&lt;ref&gt;David Deutsch (1997).

London: Penguin Press. {{ISBN|0-7139-9061-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but he is critical of Tipler's theological views.

Italian [[physicist]] and [[computer scientist]] [[Giulio Prisco]] presents the idea of "quantum archaeology",  "reconstructing the life, thoughts, memories, and feelings of any person in the past, up to any desired level of detail, and thus resurrecting the original person via 'copying to the future'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]] | title=Technological Resurrection Concepts From Fedorov to Quantum Archeology | url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/prisco20151011 | access-date=December 10, 2015 | date=October 11, 2015 |author= Giulio Prisco}} {{cite web|url=http://giulioprisco.blogspot.fr/2011/12/quantum-archaeology.html|title=Quantum Archaeology |author=Giulio Prisco | accessdate=6 July 2015 | date=December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zombies==
{{Main|Zombie}}
A zombie ([[Haitian French]]: ''{{lang|fr|zombi}}'', {{lang-ht|zonbi}}) is a fictional [[undead]] being created through the reanimation of a human [[corpse]]. Zombies are most commonly found in [[Horror fiction|horror]] and [[fantasy]] genre works. The term comes from [[Culture of Haiti#Folklore and mythology|Haitian folklore]], where a ''zombie'' is a dead body reanimated through various methods, most commonly [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]].

==Disappearances (as distinct from resurrection)==
{{See also|Entering heaven alive}}
As knowledge of different religions has grown, so have claims of bodily disappearance of some religious and mythological figures. In [[ancient Greek religion]], this was a way the gods made some physically immortal, including such figures as [[Cleitus (mythology)|Cleitus]], [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], [[Menelaus]], and [[Tithonus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Erwin Rohde]] ''Psyche: The Cult of Souls and Belief in Immortality among the Greeks''. New York: Harper &amp; Row 1966.[1921]&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, [[Cycnus]] was changed into a [[swan]] and vanished. In his chapter on [[Romulus]] from [[Parallel Lives]], [[Plutarch]] criticises the continuous belief in such disappearances, referring to the allegedly miraculous disappearance of the historical figures Romulus, [[Cleomedes of Astypalaea]], and [[Croesus]]. In ancient times, Greek and Roman pagan similarities were explained by the early Christian writers, such as [[Justin Martyr]], as the work of demons, with the intention of leading Christians astray.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Martyr, ''Dialogue with Trypho'' (ca 147-161 A.D.) Catholic University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Epic of King Gesar]], Geesar, at the end, chants on a mountain top and his clothes fall empty to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexandra David-Neel]],and Lama Yongden, ''The Superhuman Life of Gesar of Ling'', Rider, 1933, While still in oral tradition, it is recorded for the first time by an early European traveler.&lt;/ref&gt; The body of the first Guru of the [[Sikh]]s, [[Guru Nanak Dev]], is said to have disappeared and flowers left in place of his dead body.{{{cn|date=October 2018}}

[[FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]]'s [[The Hero Pattern|Hero Pattern]] lists many religious figures whose bodies disappear, or have more than one [[sepulchre]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Rank]], [[FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]], and [[Alan Dundes]], ''In Quest of the Hero'', Princeton University Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; B. Traven, author of ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'', wrote that the [[Inca]] [[Virococha]] arrived at Cusco (in modern-day Peru) and the Pacific seacoast where he walked across the water and vanished.&lt;ref&gt;B. Traven, ''The Creation of the Sun and Moon'', Lawerence Hill Books, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; It has been thought that teachings regarding the purity and incorruptibility of the hero's human body are linked to this phenomenon. Perhaps, this is also to deter the practice of disturbing and collecting the hero's remains. They are safely protected if they have disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;See: Michael Paterniti, ''Driving Mr. Albert: A Trip Across America with Einstein's Brain'', The Dial Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The first such case mentioned in the Bible is that of [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] (son of [[Jared (ancestor of Noah)|Jared]], great-grandfather of [[Noah]], and father of [[Methuselah]]). Enoch is said to have lived a life where he "walked with God", after which "he was not, for God took him" (Genesis 5:1–18).&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse-lb||Genesis|5:18-24|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Deuteronomy]] (34:6) [[Moses]] is secretly buried. [[Elijah]] vanishes in a whirlwind [[2 Kings]] (2:11). After hundreds of years these two earlier Biblical heroes suddenly reappear, and are seen walking with Jesus, then again vanish. [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] (9:2–8), [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] (17:1–8) and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] (9:28–33). The last time he is seen, [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] (24:51) alone tells of Jesus leaving his disciples by [[Ascension of Jesus|ascending into the sky]].

The '''Royal Navy Chaplaincy Service''' provides [[Military chaplain|chaplains]] to the [[Royal Navy]]. The chaplains are commissioned by the Sovereign but do not hold military rank other than that of "Chaplain Royal Navy". They are usually addressed as Padre, Reverend or more informally Bish. Chaplains are recruited from a number of [[Christian denominations]].

The senior chaplain in the Royal Navy is currently [[Martyn Gough (chaplain)|Martyn Gough]]. An Anglican priest, he is also the Archdeacon for the Royal Navy.

==Training==
Chaplains undergo training at [[Britannia Royal Naval College]] alongside other [[Royal Navy]] officer cadets. After completing the course they may opt to earn their "Dolphins" and serve in the [[Royal Navy Submarine Service|Submarine Service]] or the [[green beret]] (upon completion of the [[All Arms Commando Course]]) and serve with the [[Royal Marines]].

==Chaplains of the Fleet==

[[Halakha]] ([[Jewish]] law) addresses three main topics applicable to [[tobacco]] and [[cigarette]] [[smoking]] from the [[early modern period]] to the present day: the regulation of smoking on days of special Jewish significance, the debate over [[Smoking ban|prohibition of smoking]], per se, with regard to individual Jews, and the general environmental concerns (e.g. [[Passive smoking|second-hand smoking]]).

{{Judaism}}

==Historical background==
Until the late 20th century, the use of tobacco for smoking and in the form of [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]] was common among Jews. It is asserted that a Jew named [[Luis de Torres]], who accompanied [[Christopher Columbus]] on his expedition in 1492, settled in [[Cuba]], learned the use of tobacco, and introduced it into Europe. From this time Jews were connected with the trade in tobacco, one of the most important in early American history (M. J. Kohler, in ''Publ. Am. Jew. Hist. Soc.'' x. 52)&lt;ref name=jesmoking/&gt;

===Ritual and other moral concerns===
Recently, some rabbis considered smoking an improper, lightheaded activity for [[students]] (Stone 302).

Rabbis also debated the use of tobacco under traditional Jewish law, including varying aspects of its permissibility on the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]], [[chagim]] (Jewish [[holy]] days), [[fasting|fast]]-days, and whether a special "smoking" [[berakhah]] ([[blessing]]) might be needed. Among the early sources are the ''Keneset ha-Gedolah'' ("Men of the Great Assembly") of Rabbi Hayyim Benveniste (1603–73) and the ''[[Shulkhan Arukh#Major commentaries|Magen Avraham]]'' ("Shield of Abraham") of [[Avraham Gombiner]] (1635–83). Gombiner referred to the "drinking of ''tabak'' [tobacco] through a [[smoking pipe (tobacco)|pipe]] by drawing the smoke into the mouth and discharging it," and said that a smoker should first make a [[blessing]] over smoking as a type of refreshment. Believing that tobacco was soaked in [[beer]] — a source of ''[[chametz]]'', or [[leaven]] — he [[ban (law)|ban]]ned smoking during [[Passover]]. (ib. 343). Benveniste expressed himself very forcibly against smoking ''tutun'' (tobacco) on the [[Ninth of Av]], and reportedly [[excommunicate]]d a Jew who smoked on that solemn fast-day (''Keneset ha-Gedolah'', to Orach Chayim, 551, 21). Benveniste “points out the inconsistency of those authorities who permit smoking on holy days because it is a 'necessity,' a 'means of sustaining life,' and who allow it on fast-days because smoke has no 'substance' like [[food]].&lt;ref name=jesmoking/&gt; In Benveniste's opinion, smoking was prohibited on holy days; he quoted Rabbi [[Joseph Escapa]] as coinciding in this view, though he thought it unwise to enforce a generally accepted law.”&lt;ref name=jesmoking/&gt;

Writing in [[Turkey]], an [[Islamic]] country, Benveniste further argued that smoking is ''[[Chillul Hashem]]'' (a defamation of [[God]]), because [[Muslim]]s refraining from smoking on fast-days would see Jews smoking on theirs (''Keneset ha-Gedolah'', ib. 567 [ed. Constantinople, 1729, pp.&amp;nbsp;101 ''et seq''.]). Despite such concerns, some Jews did smoke on the Sabbath, and visited Muslim neighbors in order to smoke [[hooka]]s there. [[Rabbinic literature|Rabbinic]] authorities banned this practise on the grounds that [[Gentile]]s would consider [[Judaism]] as ridiculous (Alkalai, "Zekor le-Abraham," i. 142-143, Salonica, 1798).&lt;ref name=jesmoking/&gt;

Rabbi [[Yisrael Meir Kagan]] (1838–1933), known as the ''[[Chofetz Chaim]]'' ("Desirer of Life"), also sought to dissuade practitioners from smoking.  He considered it a waste of time, and saw the practice of people borrowing cigarettes from each other as morally questionable. (Cp. Stone (296f., 299) and [[Eliezer Waldenberg]]).

There is a custom still practiced today by Hasidic and some Haredi grooms who hand out free cigarettes to their friends at their ''[[vort]]'' (engagement). Recent rulings against smoking by great rabbis do not have seem to have stopped the tradition.{{fact|date=March 2013}}  Early on in the Hasidic movement, the [[Baal Shem Tov]] taught that smoking tobacco can be used as a religious devotion, and can even help bring the Messianic Era.  Rabbi [[Levi Yitchak of Berditchev]] is quoted as saying that "a Jew smokes on the weekdays and sniffs tobacco on the Sabbath".  Rabbi [[Dovid of Lelov]] taught that it is a good religious practice to smoke on Saturday nights after the Sabbath, and this practice is followed by the Rebbes of [[Lelov (Hasidic dynasty)|Lelov]] and [[Skulen (Hasidic dynasty)|Skulen]], however the current Rebbe of Skulen discourages people from following his example, in light of current views opposing smoking, and he himself only takes a few brief puffs of a cigarette after [[Havdalah]].  Many Hasidic Jews smoke, and many who do not smoke regularly will smoke on the holiday of [[Purim]], even if they do not do so any other time of the year, and some consider it to be a spiritual practice, similar to the smoke of the altar in the ancient Temple.  However, many Hasidic Rabbis oppose smoking.

===Specific aspects of smoking===
Early modern [[Jewish law]] also addresses the Turkish ''[[hookah|narghile]]'', or [[water pipe]], which filters the smoke through water. Benveniste rules that the ''narghile'' violates even holy-day regulations because it may extinguish fire (which is not permitted to be extinguished on a Jewish holy day). Gombiner forbids the ''naghile's'' use because its tobacco is analogous to the ''mugmar'' (spice incense) banned by [[Talmudic law]]. &lt;ref name=jesmoking&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14416-tobacco Jewish Encyclopedia: Tobacco]. 1906. Retrieved 1 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike smoking, the use of [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]] was allowed on the Sabbath, holy days, fast-days, and [[Yom Kippur]] (''Leket ha-Kemah'', p.&amp;nbsp;51b, Amsterdam, 1707).&lt;ref name=jesmoking/&gt; Jacob Haziz (1620-74) quotes a [[responsum]] of Isaiah Pinto permitting the use of snuff on the Sabbath, even though it cures [[catarrh]]; for everybody, even healthy people, snuff, and it can not therefore be considered a drug ("Halakot Ketannot," No. 101).&lt;ref name=jesmoking/&gt;

Some Jewish women also used tobacco (see Elijah of Lublin, ''Yad Eliyahu'', responsum No. 65, Amsterdam, 1712).&lt;ref name=jesmoking/&gt;

The Jewish Encyclopedia also cites [[Hebrew]] [[poetry]] on tobacco: “Solomon Wilder of Amsterdam composed one in acceptance of a tobacco-pipe as a [[birthday]] [[gift|present]] (''Ha-Karmel'', 1862, vol. ii., No. 20). Another poem characterizes the cigar and cigarette as "the two tails of these smoking firebrands" (Isa. vii. 4; see "Ha-Boker Or," i. 123).”&lt;ref name=jesmoking/&gt;

==''Halachic'' controversy==
There has been extensive controversy regarding the question of smoking. The debate about the acceptability of smoking according to ''halacha'' is centered primarily around the prohibition for a person to damage his body, or bring about his death. Opponents of smoking argue that since there is a clear link between smoking and cancer, smoking should be prohibited. However, Rabbi [[Moses Feinstein]] wrote a responsum stating that while inadvisable, smoking was permitted for one who had already started. Feinstein explained that since the risk of illness or death due to smoking is considered small, and it is a widespread practice, it is therefore permitted under the rabbinical principle:  "[[The Lord protects the simple]]." However, starting to smoke would be prohibited because of the transgression of [[v'lo sasuru]].&lt;ref&gt;Igros Moshe, Choshen Mishpat 2;76&lt;/ref&gt; According to students, when informed of the dangers of smoking, Rabbi [[Aaron Kotler]] ruled that smoking was a biblical transgression.&lt;ref&gt;letter from his close student Rabbi Yechiel Perr, the current Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshiva of Far Rockaway available at {{cite web |url=http://haviv.org/daat/?file=kop2.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614164104/http://www.haviv.org/daat/?file=kop2.php |archivedate=2011-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Haredi]] rabbis have called on people not to smoke and called smoking an 'evil habit'. These rabbis include Rabbi [[Yosef Sholom Eliashiv]], Rabbi [[Aharon Leib Shteinman]], Rabbi [[Moshe Shmuel Shapiro]], Rabbi [[Michel Yehuda Lefkowitz]], Rabbi [[Nissim Karelitz]], and Rabbi [[Shmuel Auerbach]]. Rabbi [[Shmuel Wosner|Shmuel HaLevi Wosner]] forbade people from starting to smoke and said that those who smoke are obligated to do everything they can to stop. All of these rabbis also said that it is forbidden to smoke in a public place, where others might be bothered by it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5760/kisisa/KSSasmoking2.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704132739/http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5760/kisisa/KSSasmoking2.htm |archivedate=2008-07-04 |df= }}; {{cite web |url=http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5760/kisisa/KSSasmoking.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704223348/http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5760/kisisa/KSSasmoking.htm |archivedate=2008-07-04 |df= }}; {{cite web |url=http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5760/vayakhel/VLasmoking.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704131007/http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5760/vayakhel/VLasmoking.htm |archivedate=2008-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among important Sephardi Haredi rabbis, Rabbi [[Ben Tzion Abba Shaul]] and Rabbi [[Moshe Tzedaka]] called on youth not to start smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5762/korach/KR62osmoking.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907195654/http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5762/korach/KR62osmoking.htm |archivedate=2008-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other major Ashkenazi rabbis who explicitly forbade smoking include Rabbi [[Eliezer Waldenberg]], Rabbi [[Moshe Stern]], and Rabbi [[Chaim Pinchas Sheinberg]].

Smoking is specifically prohibited by [[Solomon Freehof]], other [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] rabbis, as well as rabbis in the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] movement in the U.S. and Israel. {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

===Second-hand smoke===
The early modern [[responsa]] literature shows that Jewish students smoked in their ''[[Beth midrash|batei midrash]]'' – or study halls – and [[synagogue]]s. Some rabbis sought to outlaw smoking and the use of snuff in [[place of worship|places of worship]] (''Pahad Yitzkhak'', 9, p.&amp;nbsp;62a) and posted notices for study halls. (''Ha-Maggid'', 1859, vol. iii., No. 16). While smoking had been extremely prevalent in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] ''[[yeshivot]]'', rabbinic opinions have led to a major decrease in cigarette use in Israeli and (especially) [[United States|America]]n ''yeshivot''. {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

In tandem with [[secular]] campaigns to restrict indoor tobacco-smoking as harmful to non-smokers, Orthodox [[posek|rabbinical authorities]] began to make it virtually prohibited [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] to smoke in synagogues and study halls. Rabbi [[Moses Feinstein]] ruled against indoor smoking based on ''halakha'' covering nuisance and [[pollution]], while most other rabbis have based a similar ruling on the halakha concerning health.  In Israel, Jewish doctors and rabbis work collaboratively on anti-smoking efforts. {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

On June 30, 2006, the ''[[Vaad]] Halacha'' (Jewish law committee), sponsored by the [[Rabbinical Council of America]], ruled that the use of tobacco is forbidden to Jews, and the committee specifically cited and reversed precedents that permitted smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rabbis.org/pdfs/Prohibition_Smoking_Full_Translation.pdf |title=The Prohibition of Smoking in Halacha |accessdate= |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''stumbling block''' or '''scandal''' in the [[Bible]], or in politics (including history), is a [[metaphor]] for a behaviour or attitude that leads another to [[sin]] or to destructive behaviour. 

==Bible use==

===Hebrew Bible===
The origin of the metaphor is the prohibition of putting a stumbling block before the blind ({{bibleverse|Leviticus|19:14|}}). [[Geoffrey W. Bromiley]] calls the image "especially appropriate to a rocky land like [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |authorlink=Geoffrey W. Bromiley |encyclopedia=The international standard Bible encyclopedia |page=641 |year=1995 |quote=The concept of a stumbling block was especially appropriate to a rocky land like Palestine, where stones and pebbles are plentiful on all the unpaved roads (in contrast to countries with alluvial soil, like Egypt or Mesopotamia).}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Hebrew Bible]], the term for "stumbling block" is [[Biblical Hebrew]] {{transl|he|miḵšōl}} ({{lang|he|מִכְשׁוֹל|rtl=yes}}). In the [[Septuagint]], {{transl|he|miḵšōl}} is translated into [[Koine Greek]] {{transl|grc|skandalon}} ({{lang|grc|{{linktext|σκανδαλον}}}}), a word which occurs only in [[Hellenistic literature]], in the sense "snare for an enemy; cause of moral stumbling".&lt;ref name="oedetymology"&gt;OED "scandal", etymology.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Septuagint {{bibleverse|Psalms|140:9|}} a stumbling block means anything that leads to sin.&lt;ref name="Khatry"&gt;{{cite  dissertation |origyear=1991 |isbn=158112094X |first=Ramesh |last=Khatry |title=The Authenticity of the Parable of the Wheat and the Tares and Its Interpretation |date=July 15, 2000 |institution=[[Westminster College, Oxford]] in collaboration with [[Wycliffe Hall, Oxford|Wycliffe Hall]] |page=137 |quote=Thematically, the usage in Mt 13:41 resembles that of Jewish tradition where to skandalon merely means anything that leads to sin. For example, Mt 13:41b is very similar to LXX Ps 140:9. LXX Ps 140:9 – apo skandalōn tōn ergazomenōn tēn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Testament===
The New Testament usages of {{lang|el-Latn|skandalon}}, such as {{bibleverse|Matthew|13:41|}}, resemble Septuagint usage.&lt;ref name="Khatry"/&gt; It appears 15 times in the New Testament in 12 unique verses according to [[Strong's Concordance]].  These passages are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G4625|title=G4625 - skandalon - Strong's Greek Lexicon (KJV)|work=blueletterbible.org|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{bibleverse|Matthew|13:41|}}, {{bibleverse|Matthew|16:23|}} , {{bibleverse|Matthew|18:7|}}  (3 times), {{bibleverse|Luke|17:1|}} , {{bibleverse|Romans|9:33|}}, {{bibleverse|Romans|11:9|}}, {{bibleverse|Romans|14:13|}}, {{bibleverse|Romans|16:17|}}, {{bibleverse|1 Corinthians|1:23|}}, {{bibleverse|Galatians|5:11|}}, {{bibleverse|1 Peter|2:8|}}, {{bibleverse|1 John|2:10|}}, and {{bibleverse|Revelation|2:14|}}.

The noun  {{lang|el-Latn|skandalon}} has a derived [[verb]], {{lang|el-Latn|skandalizo}} (formed with the {{lang|el-Latn|-iz}} suffix as English "scandalize"), meaning literally "to trip somebody up" or, idiomatically, "to cause someone to sin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Gospel according to Matthew: an introduction and commentary |page=271 |first=R. T. |last=France |year=1985 |quote=(ii) On stumbling-blocks (18:6–9) These sayings are linked together by the words skandalizo ('cause to sin', w. 6,8,9) and skandalon ('temptation (to sin)' 3 times in v. 7), a 'stumbling-block', something which trips someone up.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This verb appears 29 times in 27 New Testament verses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?t=kjv&amp;strongs=g4624|title=G4624 - skandalizō - Strong's Greek Lexicon (KJV)|accessdate=27 May 2016|work=blueletterbible.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from ''skandalon'' the idiom of "stumbling block" has a second [[synonym]] in the Greek term ''proskomma'' "stumbling."&lt;ref name="Hovey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalstandardbible.com/S/stumbling-block-stumbling-stone.html|title=Stumbling-block; Stumbling-stone|last=Hovey|first=George Rice|year=1939|work=International Standard Bible Encyclopedia|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The rhetorical role of Scripture in 1 Corinthians |page=141 |first=John Paul |last=Heil |year=2005 |quote=... then Paul will never eat any meat whatsoever in order not to "cause to sin" (skandali&amp;sw) a fellow believer (8:13)... become a "stumbling block" (proskomma) to those in the audience who do not possess the knowledge that idols are....}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?t=kjv&amp;strongs=g4348|title=G4348 - proskomma - Strong's Greek Lexicon (KJV)|work=blueletterbible.org|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both words are used together in [[1 Peter]] 2:8; this is a "stone of stumbling" ({{lang|el-Latn|lithos proskommatos}} λίθος προσκόμματος) and a "rock of offense" ({{lang|el-Latn|petra skandalou}} πέτρα σκανδάλου).&lt;ref name="Hovey" /&gt;  The antonymous adjective {{lang|el-Latn|aproskopos}} (ἀπρόσκοπος), "without causing anyone to stumble," also occurs three times in the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G677&amp;t=KJV|title=G677 - aproskopos - Strong's Greek Lexicon (KJV)|work=blueletterbible.org|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later use==
===Judaism===
{{main|lifnei iver}}
The Leviticus warning is developed in [[rabbinical Judaism]] as ''[[lifnei iver]]'' "before the blind."

===Christianity===

====Catholicism====
"Scandal" is discussed by [[Thomas Aquinas]] in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Vander Heeren 1912, "Notion of scandal"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3043.htm#article|title=Scandal|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|year=1920|work=SUMMA THEOLOGICA|pages=Secunda Secundae Partis, Q. 43|language=English|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1992 ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', it is discussed under the fifth commandment ([[Thou shalt not kill]]) section "Respect for the Dignity of Persons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P80.HTM|title=Part three: Life in Christ / Section two: The Ten Commandments / Chapter two: You shall love your neighbor as yourself / Article 5: The fifth commandment / ii. Respect for the dignity of persons |year=1992|work=Catechism of the Catholic Church|publisher=[[Holy See]]|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Active scandal'' is performed by a person; ''passive scandal'' is the reaction of a person to active scandal ("scandal given" or in Latin {{lang|la|scandalum datum}}), or to acts which, because of the viewer's ignorance, weakness, or malice, are regarded as scandalous ("scandal received" or in Latin {{lang|la|scandalum acceptum}}).&lt;ref&gt;Vander Heeren 1912, "Divisions"&lt;/ref&gt; 

In order to qualify as scandalous, the behavior must, in itself, be evil or give the appearance of evil.&lt;ref name="cases1"&gt;Vander Heeren 1912, "Cases in which the sin of scandal occurs (1)"&lt;/ref&gt;   To do a good act or an [[indifferent act]], even knowing that it will inspire others to sin — as when a student studies diligently to do well, knowing it will cause [[envy]] — is not scandalous.&lt;ref name="cases1"/&gt;  Again, to ask someone to commit [[perjury]] is scandalous, but for a judge to require witnesses to give an oath even when he knows the witness is likely to commit perjury is not scandalous.&lt;ref name="cases1"/&gt; It does not require that the other person actually commit sin; to be scandalous, it suffices that the act is of a nature to lead someone to sin.&lt;ref name="cases1"/&gt; Scandal is performed with the intention of inducing someone to sin.&lt;ref name="cases1"/&gt;  Urging someone to commit a sin is therefore active scandal.&lt;ref name="cases1"/&gt;  In the case where the person urging the sin is aware of its nature and the person he is urging is ignorant, the sins committed are the fault of the person who urged them.&lt;ref name="cases1"/&gt; Scandal is also performed when someone performs an evil act, or an act that appears to be evil, knowing that it will lead others into sin.&lt;ref name="cases1"/&gt;  (In case of an apparently evil act, a sufficient reason for the act despite the faults it will cause negates the scandal.&lt;ref name="cases1"/&gt;) Scandal may also be incurred when an innocent act may be an [[occasion of sin]] to the weak, but such acts should not be foregone if the goods at stake are of importance.&lt;ref name="cases3"&gt;Vander Heeren 1912, "Cases in which the sin of scandal occurs (3)"&lt;/ref&gt;

====Protestantism====
The term "stumbling block" is common in Protestant writings. An early use was [[Martin Luther]]'s consideration that the common belief that the Mass was a sacrifice was a "stumbling block."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert C. |last=Croken |title=Luther's first front: the Eucharist as sacrifice |page=26 |year=1990 |quote=A second stumbling block (and it is significant that Luther considers it a "second" stumbling block) to the true doctrine of the Mass is the common belief that the Mass is a sacrifice. According to this belief, Christ is offered to God ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern "scandal"==
{{main|scandal}}
The  Greek word {{lang|el-Latn|skandalon}} was [[loanword|borrowed]] from Greek to Latin to French, and finally to English as "scandal".&lt;ref name="oedetymology"/&gt; The modern English meaning of ''[[scandal]]'' is a [[semantic drift|development]] from the religious meaning, via the intermediate sense of "damage to reputation".&lt;ref&gt;OED "scandal", senses 1–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United States Declaration of Independence''' is the statement adopted by the [[Second Continental Congress]] meeting at the Pennsylvania State House (now known as [[Independence Hall]]) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on July 4, 1776. The Declaration announced that the [[Thirteen Colonies]] at war with the Kingdom of Great Britain would regard themselves as thirteen independent sovereign states, no longer under British rule. With the Declaration, these new states took a collective first step toward forming the United States of America. The declaration was signed by representatives from [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts Bay]], [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]], [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]], [[Province of New York|New York]], [[Province of New Jersey|New Jersey]], [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]], [[Delaware Colony|Delaware]], [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], [[Province of North Carolina|North Carolina]], [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]], and [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]].

The [[Lee Resolution]] for independence was passed on July 2 with no opposing votes. The [[Committee of Five]] had drafted the Declaration to be ready when Congress voted on independence. [[John Adams]], a leader in pushing for independence, had persuaded the committee to select [[Thomas Jefferson]] to compose the original draft of the document,&lt;ref name="digitalhistory"&gt;[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/active_learning/explorations/revolution/revolution_declaringindependence.cfm "Declaring Independence"], ''Revolutionary War'', Digital History, University of Houston. From Adams' notes: "Why will you not? You ought to do it." "I will not." "Why?" "Reasons enough." "What can be your reasons?" "Reason first, you are a Virginian, and a Virginian ought to appear at the head of this business. Reason second, I am obnoxious, suspected, and unpopular. You are very much otherwise. Reason third, you can write ten times better than I can." "Well," said Jefferson, "if you are decided, I will do as well as I can." "Very well. When you have drawn it up, we will have a meeting."&lt;/ref&gt; which Congress edited to produce the final version. The Declaration was a formal explanation of why Congress had voted to declare independence from Great Britain, more than a year after the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]].  Adams wrote to his wife [[Abigail Adams|Abigail]], "The Second Day of July 1776, will be the most memorable Epocha, in the History of America"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masshist.org/digitaladams/archive/doc?id=L17760703jasecond Letter from John Adams to Abigail Adams, 3 July 1776]&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– although Independence Day is actually celebrated on July 4, the date that the wording of the Declaration of Independence was approved.

After ratifying the text on July 4, Congress issued the Declaration of Independence in several forms. It was initially published as the printed [[Physical history of the United States Declaration of Independence#Dunlap broadside|Dunlap broadside]] that was widely distributed and read to the public. The source copy used for this printing has been lost and may have been a copy in Thomas Jefferson's hand.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Boyd (1976), ''The Declaration of Independence: The Mystery of the Lost Original'', p. 438.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson's original draft is preserved at the [[Library of Congress]], complete with changes made by John Adams and [[Benjamin Franklin]], as well as Jefferson's notes of changes made by Congress.  The best-known version of the Declaration is a signed copy that is displayed at the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] in Washington, D.C., and which is popularly regarded as the official document. This engrossed copy was ordered by Congress on July 19 and signed primarily on August 2.&lt;ref&gt;

The sources and interpretation of the Declaration have been the subject of much scholarly inquiry. The Declaration justified the independence of the United States by listing colonial grievances against [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] and by asserting certain natural and legal rights, including a right of revolution. Its original purpose was to announce independence, and references to the text of the Declaration were few in the following years. [[Abraham Lincoln]] made it the centerpiece of his policies and his rhetoric, as in the [[Gettysburg Address]] of 1863. Since then, it has become a well-known statement on human rights, particularly its second sentence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This has been called "one of the best-known sentences in the English language",&lt;ref&gt;Stephen E. Lucas, "Justifying America: The Declaration of Independence as a Rhetorical Document", in Thomas W. Benson, ed., ''American Rhetoric: Context and Criticism'', Carbondale, Illinois: Southern Illinois University Press, 1989, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; containing "the most potent and consequential words in American history".&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, ''American Creation'', 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; The passage came to represent a moral standard to which the United States should strive. This view was notably promoted by Lincoln, who considered the Declaration to be the foundation of his political philosophy and argued that it is a statement of principles through which the [[United States Constitution]] should be interpreted.&lt;ref name="McPherson126"&gt;McPherson, ''Second American Revolution'', 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Declaration of Independence inspired many similar documents in other countries, the first being the 1789 ''Declaration of Flanders'' issued during the [[Brabant Revolution]] in the [[Austrian Netherlands]]. It also served as the primary model for numerous declarations of independence in Europe and Latin America, as well as Africa (Liberia) and Oceania (New Zealand) during the first half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=David| last=Armitage| title=The Declaration of Independence: A Global History| date=2007| publisher=Harvard University Press| location=Cambridge, Massachusetts| isbn=0-674-02282-3| pages=113–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Thomas Jefferson rev.jpg|thumb|upright=.90|Thomas Jefferson, the principal author of the Declaration]]

{{quote|text=Believe me, dear Sir: there is not in the British empire a man who more cordially loves a union with Great Britain than I do. But, by the God that made me, I will cease to exist before I yield to a connection on such terms as the British Parliament propose; and in this, I think I speak the sentiments of America.|sign=[[Thomas Jefferson]], November 29, 1775&lt;ref&gt;Hazelton, ''Declaration History'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By the time that the Declaration of Independence was adopted in July 1776, the [[Thirteen Colonies]] and Great Britain had been at war for more than a year. Relations had been deteriorating between the colonies and the mother country since 1763.  [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] enacted a series of measures to increase revenue from the colonies, such as the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]] and the [[Townshend Acts]] of 1767. Parliament believed that these acts were a legitimate means of having the colonies pay their fair share of the costs to keep them in the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Christie and Labaree, ''Empire or Independence'', 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many colonists, however, had developed a different conception of the empire. The colonies were not directly represented in Parliament, and colonists argued that Parliament had [[No taxation without representation|no right to levy taxes]] upon them. This tax dispute was part of a larger divergence between British and American interpretations of the [[British Constitution]] and the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, ''Ideological Origins'', 162.&lt;/ref&gt; The orthodox British view, dating from the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, was that Parliament was the [[Parliamentary sovereignty|supreme authority]] throughout the empire, and so, by definition, anything that Parliament did was constitutional.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, ''Ideological Origins'', 200–02.&lt;/ref&gt; In the colonies, however, the idea had developed that the British Constitution recognized certain [[natural and legal rights|fundamental rights]] that no government could violate, not even Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, ''Ideological Origins'', 180–82.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Townshend Acts, some essayists even began to question whether Parliament had any [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] jurisdiction in the colonies at all.&lt;ref&gt;Middlekauff, ''Glorious Cause'', 241.&lt;/ref&gt; Anticipating the arrangement of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]],&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, ''Ideological Origins'', 224–25.&lt;/ref&gt; by 1774 American writers such as [[Samuel Adams]], [[James Wilson]], and Thomas Jefferson were arguing that Parliament was the legislature of Great Britain only, and that the colonies, which had their own legislatures, were connected to the rest of the empire only through their allegiance to the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;Middlekauff, ''Glorious Cause'', 241–42. The writings in question include Wilson's ''Considerations on the Authority of Parliament'' and Jefferson's ''[[A Summary View of the Rights of British America]]'' (both 1774), as well as Samuel Adams's 1768 [[Massachusetts Circular Letter|Circular Letter]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congress convenes===
The issue of Parliament's authority in the colonies became a crisis after Parliament passed the [[Coercive Acts]] (known as the Intolerable Acts in the colonies) in 1774 to punish the colonists for the [[Gaspee Affair]] of 1772 and the [[Boston Tea Party]] of 1773. Many colonists saw the Coercive Acts as a violation of the British Constitution and thus a threat to the liberties of all of [[British America]], so the [[First Continental Congress]] convened in Philadelphia in September 1774 to coordinate a response. Congress organized a [[Continental Association|boycott of British goods]] and [[Petition to the King (1774)|petitioned the king]] for repeal of the acts. These measures were unsuccessful because King George and the ministry of Prime Minister [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] were determined to enforce parliamentary supremacy in America. As the king wrote to North in November 1774, "blows must decide whether they are to be subject to this country or independent".&lt;ref&gt;Middlekauff, ''Glorious Cause'', 168; Ferling, ''Leap in the Dark'', 123–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most colonists still hoped for reconciliation with Great Britain, even after fighting began in the [[American Revolutionary War]] at [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Lexington and Concord]] in April 1775.&lt;ref&gt;Hazelton, ''Declaration History'', 13; Middlekauff, ''Glorious Cause'', 318.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Second Continental Congress]] convened at the [[Independence Hall (United States)|Pennsylvania State House]] in Philadelphia in May 1775, and some delegates hoped for eventual independence, but no one yet advocated declaring it.&lt;ref&gt;Middlekauff, ''Glorious Cause'', 318.&lt;/ref&gt; Many colonists no longer believed that Parliament had any sovereignty over them, yet they still professed loyalty to King George, who they hoped would intercede on their behalf. They were disappointed in late 1775 when the king rejected Congress's [[Olive Branch Petition|second petition]], issued a [[Proclamation of Rebellion]], and announced before Parliament on October 26 that he was considering "friendly offers of foreign assistance" to suppress the rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 25. The text of the 1775 [[Speech from the Throne|king's speech]] is [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/rbpe:@field(DOCID+@lit(rbpe1440150a)) online], published by the [[American Memory]] project.&lt;/ref&gt; A pro-American minority in Parliament warned that the government was driving the colonists toward independence.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toward independence==
[[Thomas Paine]]'s pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' was published in January 1776, just as it became clear in the colonies that the king was not inclined to act as a conciliator.&lt;ref&gt;Rakove, ''Beginnings of National Politics'', 88–90.&lt;/ref&gt; Paine had only recently arrived in the colonies from England, and he argued in favor of colonial independence, advocating [[republicanism]] as an alternative to monarchy and hereditary rule.&lt;ref&gt;Christie and Labaree, ''Empire or Independence'', 270; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Common Sense'' made a persuasive and impassioned case for independence, which had not yet been given serious intellectual consideration in the American colonies. Paine connected independence with Protestant beliefs as a means to present a distinctly American political identity, thereby stimulating public debate on a topic that few had previously dared to openly discuss,&lt;ref&gt;Rakove, ''Beginnings of National Politics'', 89; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 33.&lt;/ref&gt; and public support for separation from Great Britain steadily increased after its publication.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Independence Hall Assembly Room.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.90|The Assembly Room in Philadelphia's [[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]], where the Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence]]

Some colonists still held out hope for reconciliation, but developments in early 1776 further strengthened public support for independence. In February 1776, colonists learned of Parliament's passage of the [[Prohibitory Act]], which established a blockade of American ports and declared American ships to be enemy vessels. [[John Adams]], a strong supporter of independence, believed that Parliament had effectively declared American independence before Congress had been able to. Adams labeled the Prohibitory Act the "Act of Independency", calling it "a compleat&lt;!-- sic --&gt; Dismemberment of the British Empire".&lt;ref&gt;Hazelton, ''Declaration History'', 209; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 25–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Support for declaring independence grew even more when it was confirmed that King George had hired German mercenaries to use against his American subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this growing popular support for independence, Congress lacked the clear authority to declare it. Delegates had been elected to Congress by 13 different governments, which included extralegal conventions, ad hoc committees, and elected assemblies, and they were bound by the instructions given to them. Regardless of their personal opinions, delegates could not vote to declare independence unless their instructions permitted such an action.&lt;ref&gt;Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Several colonies, in fact, expressly prohibited their delegates from taking any steps towards separation from Great Britain, while other delegations had instructions that were ambiguous on the issue;&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 30.&lt;/ref&gt; consequently, advocates of independence sought to have the Congressional instructions revised. For Congress to declare independence, a majority of delegations would need authorization to vote for it, and at least one colonial government would need to specifically instruct its delegation to propose a declaration of independence in Congress. Between April and July 1776, a "complex political war"&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 59.&lt;/ref&gt; was waged to bring this about.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 671; Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revising instructions===
In the campaign to revise Congressional instructions, many Americans formally expressed their support for separation from Great Britain in what were effectively state and local declarations of independence. Historian [[Pauline Maier]] identifies more than ninety such declarations that were issued throughout the Thirteen Colonies from April to July 1776.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 48, and Appendix A, which lists the state and local declarations.&lt;/ref&gt; These "declarations" took a variety of forms. Some were formal written instructions for Congressional delegations, such as the [[Halifax Resolves]] of April 12, with which North Carolina became the first colony to explicitly authorize its delegates to vote for independence.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 678–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Others were legislative acts that officially ended British rule in individual colonies, such as the Rhode Island legislature declaring its independence from Great Britain on May 4, the first colony to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 679; Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Many "declarations" were resolutions adopted at town or county meetings that offered support for independence. A few came in the form of jury instructions, such as the statement issued on April 23, 1776, by Chief Justice [[William Henry Drayton]] of South Carolina: "the law of the land authorizes me to declare ... that ''George'' the Third, King of ''Great Britain'' ... has no authority over us, and we owe no obedience to him."&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 69–72, quoted on 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these declarations are now obscure, having been overshadowed by the declaration approved by Congress on July 2, and signed July 4.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 48. The modern scholarly consensus is that the best-known and earliest of the local declarations is most likely inauthentic, the [[Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence]], allegedly adopted in May 1775 (a full year before other local declarations); Maier, ''American Scripture'', 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some colonies held back from endorsing independence. Resistance was centered in the [[middle colonies]] of New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Delaware.&lt;ref name="Jensen, Founding, 682"&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 682.&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of independence saw Pennsylvania as the key; if that colony could be converted to the pro-independence cause, it was believed that the others would follow.&lt;ref name="Jensen, Founding, 682"/&gt; On May 1, however, opponents of independence retained control of the [[Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly|Pennsylvania Assembly]] in a special election that had focused on the question of independence.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 683.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Congress passed a resolution on May 10 which had been promoted by John Adams and [[Richard Henry Lee]], calling on colonies without a "government sufficient to the [[wikt:exigency|exigencies]] of their affairs" to adopt new governments.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 684; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 37. For the full text of the May 10 resolve, see the [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc004109)): ''Journals of the Continental Congress''].&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution passed unanimously, and was even supported by Pennsylvania's [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]], the leader of the anti-independence faction in Congress, who believed that it did not apply to his colony.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 684.&lt;/ref&gt;

===May 15 preamble===
{{quote box|align=right|width=30em|quote=This Day the Congress has passed the most important Resolution, that ever was taken in America.|source=—John Adams, May 15, 1776&lt;ref&gt;Burnett, ''Continental Congress'', 159. The text of Adams's letter is [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(dg003624)):: online].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As was the custom, Congress appointed a committee to draft a [[preamble]] to explain the purpose of the resolution. John Adams wrote the preamble, which stated that because King George had rejected reconciliation and was hiring foreign mercenaries to use against the colonies, "it is necessary that the exercise of every kind of authority under the said crown should be totally suppressed".&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 37; Jensen, ''Founding'', 684. For the full text of the May 15 preamble see the [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc004113)) ''Journals of the Continental Congress''].&lt;/ref&gt; Adams's preamble was meant to encourage the overthrow of the governments of Pennsylvania and Maryland, which were still under [[proprietary colony|proprietary]] governance.&lt;ref&gt;Rakove, ''National Politics'', 96; Jensen, ''Founding'', 684; Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Congress passed the preamble on May 15 after several days of debate, but four of the middle colonies voted against it, and the Maryland delegation walked out in protest.&lt;ref&gt;Rakove, ''National Politics'', 97; Jensen, ''Founding'', 685.&lt;/ref&gt; Adams regarded his May 15 preamble effectively as an American declaration of independence, although a formal declaration would still have to be made.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lee's resolution===
{{main|Lee Resolution}}
On the same day that Congress passed Adams's radical preamble, the [[Fifth Virginia Convention|Virginia Convention]] set the stage for a formal Congressional declaration of independence. On May 15, the Convention instructed Virginia's congressional delegation "to propose to that respectable body to declare the United Colonies free and independent States, absolved from all allegiance to, or dependence upon, the Crown or Parliament of Great Britain".&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, ''Evolution'', 18; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 63. The text of the May 15 Virginia resolution is [http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/const/const02.htm online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620032827/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/const/const02.htm |date=June 20, 2008 }} at Yale Law School's Avalon Project.&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with those instructions, [[Richard Henry Lee]] of Virginia presented a [[Lee Resolution|three-part resolution]] to Congress on June 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{wdl|109}} |author=Jefferson, Thomas |date=July 4, 1776 |title=Declaration of Independence. In Congress, July 4, 1776, a Declaration by the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress Assembled |work=World Digital Library |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |accessdate=July 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The motion was seconded by John Adams, calling on Congress to declare independence, form foreign alliances, and prepare a plan of colonial confederation. The part of the resolution relating to declaring independence read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Resolved, that these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States, that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 41; Boyd, ''Evolution'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lee's resolution met with resistance in the ensuing debate. Opponents of the resolution conceded that reconciliation was unlikely with Great Britain, while arguing that declaring independence was premature, and that securing foreign aid should take priority.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 689–90; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of the resolution countered that foreign governments would not intervene in an internal British struggle, and so a formal declaration of independence was needed before foreign aid was possible. All Congress needed to do, they insisted, was to "declare a fact which already exists".&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 689; Armitage, ''Global History'', 33–34. The quotation is from Jefferson's notes; Boyd, ''Papers of Jefferson'', 1:311.&lt;/ref&gt; Delegates from Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland, and New York were still not yet authorized to vote for independence, however, and some of them threatened to leave Congress if the resolution were adopted. Congress, therefore, voted on June 10 to postpone further discussion of Lee's resolution for three weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 42–43; Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Until then, Congress decided that a committee should prepare a document announcing and explaining independence in the event that Lee's resolution was approved when it was brought up again in July.

=== The final push ===
[[File:Writing the Declaration of Independence 1776 cph.3g09904.jpg|thumb|upright=.90|This idealized depiction of (left to right) Franklin, Adams, and Jefferson working on the Declaration was widely reprinted (by [[Jean Leon Gerome Ferris]], 1900).&lt;ref&gt;Dupont and Onuf, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Support for a Congressional declaration of independence was consolidated in the final weeks of June 1776. On June 14, the Connecticut Assembly instructed its delegates to propose independence and, the following day, the legislatures of New Hampshire and Delaware authorized their delegates to declare independence.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 691–92.&lt;/ref&gt; In Pennsylvania, political struggles ended with the dissolution of the colonial assembly, and a new Conference of Committees under [[Thomas McKean]] authorized Pennsylvania's delegates to declare independence on June 18.&lt;ref&gt;Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 106–07; Jensen, ''Founding'', 691.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Provincial Congress of New Jersey]] had been governing the province since January 1776; they resolved on June 15 that [[Colonial government in the Thirteen Colonies|Royal Governor]] [[William Franklin]] was "an enemy to the liberties of this country" and had him arrested.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 692.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 21, they chose new delegates to Congress and empowered them to join in a declaration of independence.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 693.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only Maryland and New York had yet to authorize independence towards the end of June. Previously, Maryland's delegates had walked out when the Continental Congress adopted Adams's radical May 15 preamble, and had sent to the [[Annapolis Convention (1774–1776)|Annapolis Convention]] for instructions.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 694.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 20, the Annapolis Convention rejected Adams's preamble, instructing its delegates to remain against independence. But [[Samuel Chase]] went to Maryland and, thanks to local resolutions in favor of independence, was able to get the Annapolis Convention to change its mind on June 28.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 694–96; Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 96; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Only the New York delegates were unable to get revised instructions. When Congress had been considering the resolution of independence on June 8, the [[New York Provincial Congress]] told the delegates to wait.&lt;ref&gt;Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 118; Jensen, ''Founding'', 698.&lt;/ref&gt; But on June 30, the Provincial Congress evacuated New York as British forces approached, and would not convene again until July 10. This meant that New York's delegates would not be authorized to declare independence until after Congress had made its decision.&lt;ref&gt;Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 119–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Draft and adoption==
{{main|Physical history of the United States Declaration of Independence}}
Political maneuvering was setting the stage for an official declaration of independence even while a document was being written to explain the decision. On June 11, 1776, Congress appointed a "[[Committee of Five]]" to draft a declaration, consisting of [[John Adams]] of Massachusetts, [[Benjamin Franklin]] of Pennsylvania, [[Thomas Jefferson]] of Virginia, [[Robert Livingston (1746-1813)|Robert R. Livingston]] of New York, and [[Roger Sherman]] of Connecticut. The committee left no minutes, so there is some uncertainty about how the drafting process proceeded; contradictory accounts were written many years later by Jefferson and Adams, too many years to be regarded as entirely reliable—although their accounts are frequently cited.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 97–105; Boyd, ''Evolution'', 21.&lt;/ref&gt; What is certain is that the committee discussed the general outline which the document should follow and decided that Jefferson would write the first draft.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, ''Evolution'', 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The committee in general, and Jefferson in particular, thought that Adams should write the document, but Adams persuaded the committee to choose Jefferson and promised to consult with him personally.&lt;ref name="digitalhistory" /&gt; Considering Congress's busy schedule, Jefferson probably had limited time for writing over the next seventeen days, and likely wrote the draft quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 104.&lt;/ref&gt; He then consulted the others and made some changes, and then produced another copy incorporating these alterations. The committee presented this copy to the Congress on June 28, 1776. The title of the document was "A Declaration by the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress assembled."&lt;ref&gt;Becker, ''Declaration of Independence'', 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jefferson's+deskdetail.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.90|Portable writing desk that Jefferson used to draft and write the Declaration of Independence]]
Congress ordered that the draft "[[Table (parliamentary)|lie on the table]]".&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 701.&lt;/ref&gt;  For two days, Congress methodically edited Jefferson's primary document, shortening it by a fourth, removing unnecessary wording, and improving sentence structure.&lt;ref name="Ferling (2000), pp. 131–137"/&gt; They removed Jefferson's assertion that Great Britain had forced slavery on the colonies in order to moderate the document and appease persons in Great Britain who supported the Revolution.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Jefferson wrote that Congress had "mangled" his draft version, but the Declaration that was finally produced was "the majestic document that inspired both contemporaries and posterity," in the words of his biographer [[John Ferling]].&lt;ref name="Ferling (2000), pp. 131–137"&gt;[[John E. Ferling]], ''Setting the World Ablaze: Washington, Adams, Jefferson, and the American Revolution'', Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-513409-4}}. {{OCLC|468591593}}, pp. 131–37&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress tabled the draft of the declaration on Monday, July 1, and resolved itself into a [[Committee of the Whole|committee of the whole]], with [[Benjamin Harrison V|Benjamin Harrison]] of Virginia presiding, and they resumed debate on Lee's resolution of independence.&lt;ref&gt;Burnett, ''Continental Congress'', 181.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]] made one last effort to delay the decision, arguing that Congress should not declare independence without first securing a foreign alliance and finalizing the [[Articles of Confederation]].&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 699.&lt;/ref&gt; John Adams gave a speech in reply to Dickinson, restating the case for an immediate declaration.

A vote was taken after a long day of speeches, each colony casting a single vote, as always. The delegation for each colony numbered from two to seven members, and each delegation voted amongst themselves to determine the colony's vote. Pennsylvania and South Carolina voted against declaring independence. The New York delegation abstained, lacking permission to vote for independence. Delaware cast no vote because the delegation was split between [[Thomas McKean]] (who voted yes) and [[George Read (signer)|George Read]] (who voted no). The remaining nine delegations voted in favor of independence, which meant that the resolution had been approved by the committee of the whole. The next step was for the resolution to be voted upon by Congress itself. [[Edward Rutledge]] of South Carolina was opposed to Lee's resolution but desirous of unanimity, and he moved that the vote be postponed until the following day.&lt;ref&gt;Burnett, ''Continental Congress'', 182; Jensen, ''Founding'', 700.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Declaration House Graff House.jpg|thumb|upright=0.90|"Declaration House", the boarding house at Market and S. 7th Street where Jefferson wrote the Declaration]]

On July 2, South Carolina reversed its position and voted for independence. In the Pennsylvania delegation, Dickinson and [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] abstained, allowing the delegation to vote three-to-two in favor of independence. The tie in the Delaware delegation was broken by the timely arrival of [[Caesar Rodney]], who voted for independence. The New York delegation abstained once again since they were still not authorized to vote for independence, although they were allowed to do so a week later by the [[New York Provincial Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution of independence had been adopted with twelve affirmative votes and one abstention. With this, the colonies had officially severed political ties with Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, ''Evolution'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Adams predicted in a famous letter, written to his wife on the following day, that July 2 would become a great American holiday.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 703–04.&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that the vote for independence would be commemorated; he did not foresee that Americans—including himself—would instead celebrate [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] on the date when the announcement of that act was finalized.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 160–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am apt to believe that [Independence Day] will be celebrated, by succeeding Generations, as the great anniversary Festival. It ought to be commemorated, as the Day of Deliverance by solemn Acts of Devotion to God Almighty. It ought to be solemnized with Pomp and Parade, with shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other from this Time forward forever more.&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in {{cite book|last=Adams|first=John|title=My Dearest Friend: Letters of Abigail and John Adams|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vTzX2ROPOCwC|year=2007|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02606-3|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vTzX2ROPOCwC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=%22I+am+apt+to+believe%22 125]}}
Adams predicted that the celebration date would be July 2, the date the independence resolution was adopted, rather than July 4, the date the declaration was approved. Though he may have predicted the wrong celebration date, his thoughts were prophetic.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After voting in favor of the resolution of independence, Congress turned its attention to the committee's draft of the declaration. Over several days of debate, they made a few changes in wording and deleted nearly a fourth of the text and, on July 4, 1776, the wording of the Declaration of Independence was approved and sent to the printer for publication.

[[File:US-original-Declaration-1776.jpg|thumb|upright=1.50|center|The opening of the original printing of the Declaration, printed on July 4, 1776, under Jefferson's supervision.

{{Clear}}
There is a distinct change in wording from this original broadside printing of the Declaration and the final official engrossed copy.  The word "unanimous" was inserted as a result of a Congressional resolution passed on July 19, 1776:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Resolved, That the Declaration passed on the 4th, be fairly engrossed on parchment, with the title and stile of "The unanimous declaration of the thirteen United States of America," and that the same, when engrossed, be signed by every member of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field%28DOCID+@lit%28jc00538%29%29: Journals of the Continental Congress – FRIDAY, JULY 19, 1776]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Historian George Billias says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Independence amounted to a new status of interdependence: the United States was now a sovereign nation entitled to the privileges and responsibilities that came with that status.  America thus became a member of the international community, which meant becoming a maker of treaties and alliances, a military ally in diplomacy, and a partner in foreign trade on a more equal basis.&lt;ref&gt;George Billias ''American Constitutionalism Heard Round the World, 1776-1989'' (2011) p 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Annotated text of the engrossed declaration==
The declaration is not divided into formal sections; but it is often discussed as consisting of five parts: ''introduction'', ''preamble'', ''indictment'' of King George III, ''denunciation'' of the British people, and ''conclusion''.&lt;ref name="Lucas"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_style.html|title=The Stylistic Artistry of the Declaration of Independence|last=Lucas|first=Stephen E.|publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]|accessdate=July 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

"He has refused his [[Royal assent|Assent to Laws]], the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

"He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.

"He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.

"He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.

"He has [[Legislative session|dissolved]] Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness of his invasions on the rights of the people.

"He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

"He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the [[Plantation Act 1740|Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners]]; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

"He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.

"He has made [[Judicial independence|Judges dependent]] on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.

"He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.

"He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.

"He has affected to render the Military [[Civilian control of the military|independent of and superior to the Civil Power]].

"He has combined with others to subject us to a [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|jurisdiction foreign to our constitution]], and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:

"For [[Quartering Acts|quartering]] large bodies of armed troops among us:

"For protecting them, by a [[Kangaroo court|mock Trial]] from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:

"For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:

"For [[Townshend Acts|imposing Taxes]] on us [[No taxation without representation|without our Consent]]:

"For depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of [[Jury trial|Trial by Jury]]:

"For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:

"For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a [[Quebec Act|neighbouring Province]], establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:

"For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and [[Massachusetts Government Act|altering fundamentally]] the Forms of our Governments:

"For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

"He has abdicated Government here, by [[Proclamation of Rebellion|declaring]] us out of his Protection and [[Prohibitory Act|waging War]] against us.

"He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

"He is at this time transporting large Armies of [[Hessian (soldier)|foreign Mercenaries]] to compleat the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty &amp; Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.

"He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to [[Impressment|bear Arms against their Country]], to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

"He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

"In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a [[Tyrant]], is unfit to be the ruler of a free people."

==Influences and legal status==
[[File:JohnLocke.png|thumb|upright=.90|English political philosopher [[John Locke]] (1632–1704)]]

Historians have often sought to identify the sources that most influenced the words and [[political philosophy]] of the Declaration of Independence. By Jefferson's own admission, the Declaration contained no original ideas, but was instead a statement of sentiments widely shared by supporters of the American Revolution. As he explained in 1825:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Neither aiming at originality of principle or sentiment, nor yet copied from any particular and previous writing, it was intended to be an expression of the American mind, and to give to that expression the proper tone and spirit called for by the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=808&amp;chapter=88496&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 |title=TO HENRY LEE&amp;nbsp;– Thomas Jefferson The Works, vol. 12 (Correspondence and Papers 1816–1826; 1905) |date=May 8, 1825 |publisher=The Online Library of Liberty |accessdate=March 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jefferson's most immediate sources were two documents written in June 1776: his own draft of the preamble of the [[Constitution of Virginia]], and [[George Mason]]'s draft of the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]]. Ideas and phrases from both of these documents appear in the Declaration of Independence.&lt;ref&gt;Malone, ''Jefferson the Virginian'', 221; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 125–26.&lt;/ref&gt; They were, in turn, directly influenced by the 1689 [[Bill of Rights 1689|English Declaration of Rights]], which formally ended the reign of [[James II of England|King James&amp;nbsp;II]].&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 126–28.&lt;/ref&gt; During the American Revolution, Jefferson and other Americans looked to the English Declaration of Rights as a model of how to end the reign of an unjust king.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 53–57.&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish [[Declaration of Arbroath]] (1320) and the Dutch [[Act of Abjuration]] (1581) have also been offered as models for Jefferson's Declaration, but these models are now accepted by few scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Maier found no evidence that the Dutch Act of Abjuration served as a model for the Declaration, and considers the argument "unpersuasive" (''American Scripture'', p. 264). Armitage discounts the influence of the Scottish and Dutch acts, and writes that neither was called "declarations of independence" until fairly recently (''Global History'', pp. 42–44). For the argument in favor of the influence of the Dutch act, see Stephen E. Lucas, "The 'Plakkaat van Verlatinge': A Neglected Model for the American Declaration of Independence", in Rosemarijn Hofte and Johanna C. Kardux, eds., ''Connecting Cultures: The Netherlands in Five Centuries of Transatlantic Exchange'' (Amsterdam, 1994), 189–207, and Barbara Wolff, "Was the Declaration of Independence Inspired by the Dutch?" University of Wisconsin Madison News, June 29, 1988, http://www.news.wisc.edu/3049 Accessed July 3, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson wrote that a number of authors exerted a general influence on the words of the Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, ''Evolution'', 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; English political theorist [[John Locke]] is usually cited as one of the primary influences, a man whom Jefferson called one of "the three greatest men that have ever lived".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Becker]] wrote, "Most Americans had absorbed Locke's works as a kind of political gospel; and the Declaration, in its form, in its phraseology, follows closely certain sentences in Locke's [[Two Treatises of Government|second treatise on government]]."&lt;ref&gt;Becker, ''Declaration of Independence'', 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent of Locke's influence on the American Revolution has been questioned by some subsequent scholars, however. Historian Ray Forrest Harvey argued in 1937 for the dominant influence of Swiss jurist [[Jean Jacques Burlamaqui]], declaring that Jefferson and Locke were at "two opposite poles" in their political philosophy, as evidenced by Jefferson's use in the Declaration of Independence of the phrase "pursuit of happiness" instead of "property".&lt;ref&gt;Ray Forrest Harvey, ''Jean Jacques Burlamaqui: A Liberal Tradition in American Constitutionalism'' (Chapel Hill, North Carolina, 1937), 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars emphasized the influence of [[republicanism]] rather than Locke's [[classical liberalism]].&lt;ref&gt;A brief, online overview of the classical liberalism vs. republicanism debate is Alec Ewald, [http://www.flowofhistory.org/themes/american_republic/overview.php "The American Republic: 1760–1870" (2004)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517080053/http://www.flowofhistory.org/themes/american_republic/overview.php |date=May 17, 2008 }}.  In a similar vein, historian Robert Middlekauff argues that the political ideas of the independence movement took their origins mainly from the "eighteenth-century [[commonwealthmen]], the radical [[Radical Whigs|Whig]] ideology", which in turn drew on the political thought of [[John Milton]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], and [[John Locke]].  See [[Robert Middlekauff]] (2005), ''The Glorious Cause'', pp. 3–6, 51–52, 136&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Garry Wills]] argued that Jefferson was influenced by the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], particularly [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], rather than Locke,&lt;ref&gt;Wills, ''Inventing America'', especially chs. 11–13. Wills concludes (p. 315) that "the air of enlightened America was full of Hutcheson's politics, not Locke's".&lt;/ref&gt; an interpretation that has been strongly criticized.&lt;ref&gt;Hamowy, "Jefferson and the Scottish Enlightenment", argues that Wills gets much wrong (p. 523), that the Declaration seems to be influenced by Hutcheson because Hutcheson was, like Jefferson, influenced by Locke (pp. 508–09), and that Jefferson often wrote of Locke's influence, but never mentioned Hutcheson in any of his writings (p. 514). See also Kenneth S. Lynn, "Falsifying Jefferson", ''Commentary'' 66 (Oct. 1978), 66–71. [[Ralph Luker]], in [http://www.vqronline.org/articles/1980/spring/luker-garry-wills/ "Garry Wills and the New Debate Over the Declaration of Independence"] (''The Virginia Quarterly Review'', Spring 1980, 244–61) agreed that Wills overstated Hutcheson's influence to provide a [[communitarian]] reading of the Declaration, but he also argued that Wills's critics similarly read their own views into the document.&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal historian John Phillip Reid has written that the emphasis on the political philosophy of the Declaration has been misplaced. The Declaration is not a philosophical tract about natural rights, argues Reid, but is instead a legal document—an [[indictment]] against King George for violating the constitutional rights of the colonists.&lt;ref&gt;John Phillip Reid, "The Irrelevance of the Declaration", in Hendrik Hartog, ed., ''Law in the American Revolution and the Revolution in the Law'' (New York University Press, 1981), 46–89.&lt;/ref&gt;  Historian [[David Armitage (historian)|David Armitage]] has argued that the Declaration was strongly influenced by de Vattel's ''[[The Law of Nations]]'', the dominant [[international law]] treatise of the period, and a book that Benjamin Franklin said was "continually in the hands of the members of our Congress".&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Franklin to Charles F.W. Dumas, December 19, 1775, in ''The Writings of Benjamin Franklin'', ed. Albert Henry Smyth (New York: 1970), 6:432.&lt;/ref&gt; Armitage writes, "Vattel made independence fundamental to his definition of statehood"; therefore, the primary purpose of the Declaration was "to express the international legal sovereignty of the United States". If the United States were to have any hope of being recognized by the European powers, the American revolutionaries first had to make it clear that they were no longer dependent on Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, ''Global History'', 21, 38–40.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Declaration of Independence does not have the force of law domestically, but nevertheless it may help to provide historical and legal clarity about the Constitution and other laws.&lt;ref&gt;Gulf, C. &amp; SFR Co. v. Ellis, [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4471514776465320556 165 US 150] (1897): "While such declaration of principles may not have the force of organic law, or be made the basis of judicial decision as to the limits of right and duty ... it is always safe to read the letter of the Constitution in the spirit of the Declaration of Independence."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wills, Gary.

==Signing==
{{Main|Signing of the United States Declaration of Independence}}
[[File:USA declaration independence.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|The signed copy of the Declaration is now badly faded because of poor preserving practices in the 19th century. It is on display at the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
[[File:Syng inkstand.jpg|thumb|upright=.90|The [[Syng inkstand]] was used at both the signing of the Declaration and the 1787 signing of the U.S. Constitution.]]
The Declaration became official when Congress voted for it on July 4; signatures of the delegates were not needed to make it official. The handwritten copy of the Declaration of Independence that was signed by Congress is dated July 4, 1776. The signatures of fifty-six delegates are affixed; however, the exact date when each person signed it has long been the subject of debate. Jefferson, Franklin, and Adams all wrote that the Declaration had been signed by Congress on July 4.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, "Fourth of July Myths", 242–43.&lt;/ref&gt; But in 1796, signer [[Thomas McKean]] disputed that the Declaration had been signed on July 4, pointing out that some signers were not then present, including several who were not even elected to Congress until after that date.&lt;ref&gt;Hazelton, ''Declaration History'', 299–302; Burnett, ''Continental Congress'', 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Declaration was transposed on paper, adopted by the Continental Congress, and signed by [[John Hancock]], President of the Congress, on July 4, 1776, according to the 1911 record of events by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] under Secretary [[Philander C. Knox]].&lt;ref name="U.S. State Department"&gt;The U.S. State Department (1911), ''The Declaration of Independence, 1776'', pp. 10, 11.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 2, 1776, a parchment paper copy of the Declaration was signed by 56 persons.&lt;ref name="U.S. State Department"/&gt; Many of these signers were not present when the original Declaration was adopted on July 4.&lt;ref name="U.S. State Department"/&gt;  Signer [[Matthew Thornton]] from [[New Hampshire]] was seated in the Continental Congress in November; he asked for and received the privilege of adding his signature at that time, and signed on November 4, 1776.&lt;ref name="U.S. State Department"/&gt;

[[File:JohnHancocksSignature.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|On July 4, 1776, Continental Congress President [[John Hancock]]'s signature authenticated the United States Declaration of Independence.]]

Historians have generally accepted McKean's version of events, arguing that the famous signed version of the Declaration was created after July 19, and was not signed by Congress until August 2, 1776.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, "Fourth of July Myths", 245–46; Hazelton, ''Declaration History'', 208–19; Wills, ''Inventing America'', 341.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, legal historian Wilfred Ritz argued that historians had misunderstood the primary documents and given too much credence to McKean, who had not been present in Congress on July 4.&lt;ref&gt;Ritz, "Authentication", 179–200.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ritz, about thirty-four delegates signed the Declaration on July 4, and the others signed on or after August 2.&lt;ref&gt;Ritz, "Authentication", 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians who reject a July 4 signing maintain that most delegates signed on August 2, and that those eventual signers who were not present added their names later.&lt;ref&gt;Hazelton, ''Declaration History'', 208–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two future U.S. presidents were among the signatories: Thomas Jefferson and John Adams. The most famous signature on the [[engrossed]] copy is that of [[John Hancock]], who presumably signed first as [[President of the Continental Congress|President of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Hazelton, ''Declaration History'', 209.&lt;/ref&gt; Hancock's large, flamboyant signature became iconic, and the term ''John Hancock'' emerged in the United States as an informal synonym for "signature".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/John%20Hancock Merriam-Webster online]; [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/john%20hancock Dictionary.com].&lt;/ref&gt; A commonly circulated but apocryphal account claims that, after Hancock signed, the delegate from Massachusetts commented, "The British ministry can read that name without spectacles." Another apocryphal report indicates that Hancock proudly declared, "There! I guess King George will be able to read that!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teachamericanhistory.org/File/John_Hancock.pdf|title=TeachAmericanHistory.org: John Hancock|publisher=|accessdate=October 6, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510132936/http://www.teachamericanhistory.org/File/John_Hancock.pdf|archive-date=May 10, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various legends emerged years later about the signing of the Declaration, when the document had become an important national symbol. In one famous story, John Hancock supposedly said that Congress, having signed the Declaration, must now "all hang together", and Benjamin Franklin replied: "Yes, we must indeed all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately." The quotation did not appear in print until more than fifty years after Franklin's death.&lt;ref&gt;Malone, ''Story of the Declaration'', 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Syng inkstand]] used at the signing was also used at the signing of the United States Constitution in 1787.

==Publication and reaction==
[[File:Johannes Adam Simon Oertel Pulling Down the Statue of King George III, N.Y.C. ca. 1859.jpg|thumb|upright=.90|[[Johannes Adam Simon Oertel]]'s painting ''Pulling Down the Statue of King George III, N.Y.C.'', ca. 1859, depicts citizens destroying a statue of King George after the Declaration was read in New York City on July 9, 1776.]]

After Congress approved the final wording of the Declaration on July 4, a handwritten copy was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of [[John Dunlap]]. Through the night, Dunlap printed about 200 [[Broadside (printing)|broadsides]] for distribution. Before long, it was being read to audiences and reprinted in newspapers throughout the 13 states. The first formal public readings of the document took place on July 8, in Philadelphia (by [[John Nixon (financier)|John Nixon]] in the yard of Independence Hall), [[Trenton, New Jersey]], and [[Easton, Pennsylvania]]; the first newspaper to publish it was the ''[[Pennsylvania Evening Post]]'' on July 6.&lt;ref name="Maier156"&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 156.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[German language|German]] translation of the Declaration was published in Philadelphia by July 9.&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, ''Global History'', 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

President of Congress John Hancock sent a broadside to General [[George Washington]], instructing him to have it proclaimed "at the Head of the Army in the way you shall think it most proper".&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Washington had the Declaration read to his troops in [[New York City]] on July 9, with thousands of British troops on ships in the harbor. Washington and Congress hoped that the Declaration would inspire the soldiers, and encourage others to join the army.&lt;ref name="Maier156"/&gt; After hearing the Declaration, crowds in many cities tore down and destroyed signs or statues representing royal authority. An equestrian statue of King George in New York City was pulled down and the lead used to make musket balls.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 156–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

British officials in North America sent copies of the Declaration to Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, ''Global History'', 73.&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in British newspapers beginning in mid-August, it had reached Florence and Warsaw by mid-September, and a German translation appeared in Switzerland by October.

The Spanish-American authorities banned the circulation of the Declaration, but it was widely transmitted and translated: by Venezuelan Manuel García de Sena, by Colombian Miguel de Pombo, by Ecuadorian Vicente Rocafuerte, and by New Englanders Richard Cleveland and William Shaler, who distributed the Declaration and the United States Constitution among Creoles in Chile and Indians in Mexico in 1821.&lt;ref name="scholar.harvard.edu"&gt;[http://scholar.harvard.edu/armitage/files/sahj.pdf The Contagion of Sovereignty: Declarations of Independence since 1776]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[North Ministry]] did not give an official answer to the Declaration, but instead secretly commissioned pamphleteer [[John Lind (barrister)|John Lind]] to publish a response entitled ''Answer to the Declaration of the American Congress''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X2QCAa27Zy4C&amp;pg=PA75|title=Armitage, ''Global History'', 75.|publisher=|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; British Tories denounced the signers of the Declaration for not applying the same principles of "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" to African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jessup |first=John J. |title=America and the Future |magazine=Life |url=https://books.google.com/?id=cVAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA105 |page=105 |date=September 20, 1943 |accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]], the former royal governor of Massachusetts, also published a rebuttal.&lt;ref&gt;

[[William Whipple]], a signer of the Declaration of Independence who had fought in the war, freed his slave [[Prince Whipple]] because of revolutionary ideals.

==History of the documents==
{{main|Physical history of the United States Declaration of Independence}}
The official copy of the Declaration of Independence was the one printed on July 4, 1776, under Jefferson's supervision. It was sent to the states and to the Army and was widely reprinted in newspapers. The slightly different "engrossed copy" (shown at the top of this article) was made later for members to sign. The engrossed version is the one widely distributed in the 21st century.  Note that the opening lines differ between the two versions.&lt;ref name="journals.psu.edu"/&gt;

The copy of the Declaration that was signed by Congress is known as the engrossed or [[parchment]] copy. It was probably engrossed (that is, carefully handwritten) by clerk [[Timothy Matlack]].&lt;ref name=archives&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_history.html |title=The Declaration of Independence: A History|work=Charters of Freedom |publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]|accessdate=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A facsimile made in 1823 has become the basis of most modern reproductions rather than the original because of poor conservation of the engrossed copy through the 19th century.&lt;ref name=archives /&gt; In 1921, custody of the engrossed copy of the Declaration was transferred from the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] to the [[Library of Congress]], along with the [[United States Constitution]]. After the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, the documents were moved for safekeeping to the [[United States Bullion Depository]] at [[Fort Knox]] in Kentucky, where they were kept until 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Malone, ''Story of the Declaration'', 263.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, the engrossed Declaration was transferred to the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] and is now on permanent display at the National Archives in the "Rotunda for the [[Charters of Freedom]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/press/press-kits/charters.html#pressrelaese1 |title=Charters of Freedom Re-encasement Project|publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]] |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ArchivesRotunda.jpg|thumb|upright=.90|The Rotunda for the Charters of Freedom in the National Archives building]]

The document signed by Congress and enshrined in the National Archives is usually regarded as ''the'' Declaration of Independence, but historian [[Julian P. Boyd]] argued that the Declaration, like [[Magna Carta]], is not a single document. Boyd considered the printed broadsides ordered by Congress to be official texts, as well. The Declaration was first published as a broadside that was printed the night of July 4 by [[John Dunlap]] of Philadelphia. Dunlap printed about 200 broadsides, of which 26 are known to survive. The 26th copy was discovered in [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] in England in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Rare copy of United States Declaration of Independence found in Kew |first= |last= |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/5727812/Rare-copy-of-United-States-Declaration-of-Independence-found-in-Kew.html |newspaper= The Daily Telegraph |date=July 3, 2009 |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1777, Congress commissioned [[Mary Katherine Goddard]] to print [[:File:File-Goddard_broadside.jpg|a new broadside]] that listed the signers of the Declaration, unlike the Dunlap broadside.&lt;ref name=archives /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dube /&gt; Nine copies of the Goddard broadside are known to still exist.&lt;ref name=Dube&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/dube/inde2.htm |title=The Declaration of Independence |author=Ann Marie Dube |date=May 1996 |work=A Multitude of Amendments, Alterations and Additions: The Writing and Publicizing of the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, and the Constitution of the United States |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of broadsides printed by the states are also extant.&lt;ref name=Dube /&gt;

Several early handwritten copies and drafts of the Declaration have also been preserved. Jefferson kept a four-page draft that late in life he called the "original Rough draught".&lt;ref name="Boyd, Lost Original, 446"&gt;Boyd, "Lost Original", 446.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known how many drafts Jefferson wrote prior to this one, and how much of the text was contributed by other committee members. In 1947, Boyd discovered a fragment of an earlier draft in Jefferson's handwriting.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, ''Papers of Jefferson'', 1:421.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson and Adams sent copies of the rough draft to friends, with slight variations.

During the writing process, Jefferson showed the rough draft to Adams and Franklin, and perhaps to other members of the drafting committee,&lt;ref name="Boyd, Lost Original, 446"/&gt; who made a few more changes. Franklin, for example, may have been responsible for changing Jefferson's original phrase "We hold these truths to be sacred and undeniable" to "We hold these truths to be self-evident".&lt;ref&gt;Becker, ''Declaration of Independence'', 142 note 1. Boyd (''Papers of Jefferson'', 1:427–28) casts doubt on Becker's belief that the change was made by Franklin.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson incorporated these changes into a copy that was submitted to Congress in the name of the committee.&lt;ref name="Boyd, Lost Original, 446"/&gt; The copy that was submitted to Congress on June 28 has been lost and was perhaps destroyed in the printing process,&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, "Lost Original", 448–50. Boyd argued that, if a document was signed on July 4 (which he thought unlikely), it would have been the Fair Copy, and probably would have been signed only by Hancock and Thomson.&lt;/ref&gt; or destroyed during the debates in accordance with [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 3: Record of proceedings|Congress's secrecy rule]].&lt;ref&gt;Ritz, "From the ''Here''", speculates that the Fair Copy was immediately sent to the printer so that copies could be made for each member of Congress to consult during the debate. All of these copies were then destroyed, theorizes Ritz, to preserve secrecy.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 21, 2017, it was announced that a second engrossed copy had been discovered in the archives at [[West Sussex County Council]] in [[Chichester]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-england-sussex-44703928/declaration-of-independence-found-in-chichester-archives |title=Declaration of Independence document found |website=BBC News |author=|date= 4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Named by its finders the "Sussex Declaration", it differs from the National Archives copy (which the finders refer to as the "Matlack Declaration") in that the signatures on it are not grouped by States.  How it came to be in England is not yet known, but the finders believe that the randomness of the signatures points to an origin with signatory [[James Wilson]], who had argued strongly that the Declaration was made not by the States but by the whole people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/21/declaration-of-independence-sussex-england-rare|last=Yuhas|first=Alan|title=Rare parchment copy of US Declaration of Independence found in England|work=The Guardian|date=April 22, 2017|accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://declaration.fas.harvard.edu/resources/sussex-dec|title=The Sussex Declaration|work=Declaration Resources Project|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The Declaration was given little attention in the years immediately following the American Revolution, having served its original purpose in announcing the independence of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, ''Global History'', 87–88; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 162, 168–69.&lt;/ref&gt; Early celebrations of [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] largely ignored the Declaration, as did early histories of the Revolution. The ''act'' of declaring independence was considered important, whereas the ''text'' announcing that act attracted little attention.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, "Jefferson's Reputation", 178–79; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 160.&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration was rarely mentioned during the debates about the [[United States Constitution]], and its language was not incorporated into that document.&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, ''Global History'', 92.&lt;/ref&gt; George Mason's draft of the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]] was more influential, and its language was echoed in state constitutions and state bills of rights more often than Jefferson's words.&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, ''Global History'', 90; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 165–67.&lt;/ref&gt; "In none of these documents", wrote Pauline Maier, "is there any evidence whatsoever that the Declaration of Independence lived in men's minds as a classic statement of American political principles."&lt;ref name="Maier167"&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence in other countries===
Many leaders of the [[French Revolution]] admired the Declaration of Independence&lt;ref name="Maier167"/&gt; but were also interested in the new American state constitutions.&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, ''Global History'', 82.&lt;/ref&gt; The inspiration and content of the French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen]] (1789) emerged largely from the ideals of the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Georges Lefebvre|title=The Coming of the French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P4EYuia7buUC&amp;pg=PA212|year=2005|publisher=Princeton UP|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its key drafts were prepared by [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]], working closely in Paris with his friend Thomas Jefferson.  It also borrowed language from [[George Mason]]'s [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George Athan Billias, ed.|title=American Constitutionalism Heard Round the World, 1776–1989: A Global Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7WV0nP5n_AoC&amp;pg=PA92|year=2009|publisher=NYU Press|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan Dunn, ''Sister Revolutions: French Lightning, American Light'' (1999) pp. 143–45&lt;/ref&gt;  The declaration also influenced [[Russia in the American Revolutionary War#Russia and the Declaration of Independence|the Russian Empire]].  The document had a particular impact on the [[Decembrist revolt]] and other Russian thinkers.

According to historian [[David Armitage (historian)|David Armitage]], the Declaration of Independence did prove to be internationally influential, but not as a statement of human rights. Armitage argued that the Declaration was the first in a new genre of [[Declaration of independence|declarations of independence]] that announced the creation of new states.

Other French leaders were directly influenced by the text of the Declaration of Independence itself. The ''Manifesto of the Province of Flanders'' (1790) was the first foreign derivation of the Declaration;&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, ''Global History'', 113.&lt;/ref&gt; others include the [[Venezuelan Declaration of Independence]] (1811), the [[Liberian Declaration of Independence]] (1847), the declarations of secession by the [[Confederate States of America]] (1860–61), and the [[Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam|Vietnamese Proclamation of Independence]] (1945).&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, ''Global History'', 120–35.&lt;/ref&gt; These declarations echoed the United States Declaration of Independence in announcing the independence of a new state, without necessarily endorsing the political philosophy of the original.&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, ''Global History'', 104, 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other countries have used the Declaration as inspiration or have directly copied sections from it. These include the Haitian declaration of January 1, 1804, during the [[Haitian Revolution]], the [[United Provinces of New Granada]] in 1811, the [[Argentine Declaration of Independence]] in 1816, the [[Chilean Declaration of Independence]] in 1818, [[Costa Rica]] in 1821, [[El Salvador]] in 1821, [[Guatemala]] in 1821, [[Honduras]] in (1821), [[Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire|Mexico in 1821]], [[Nicaragua]] in 1821, [[Peru]] in 1821, [[Bolivian War of Independence]] in 1825, [[Uruguay]] in 1825, [[Ecuador]] in 1830, [[Colombia]] in 1831, [[Paraguay]] in 1842, [[Dominican Republic]] in 1844, [[Texas Declaration of Independence]] in March 1836, [[California Republic]] in November 1836, [[Hungarian Declaration of Independence]] in 1849, [[Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand]] in 1835, and the [[Czechoslovak declaration of independence]] from 1918 drafted in Washington D.C. with [[Gutzon Borglum]] among the drafters. The [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|Rhodesian declaration of independence]], ratified in November 1965, is based on the American one as well; however, it omits the phrases "[[all men are created equal]]" and "[[Consent of the governed|the consent of the governed]]".&lt;ref name="scholar.harvard.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Revival of interest===
Interest in the Declaration was revived in the 1790s with the emergence of the United States's [[First Party System|first political parties]].&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, "Jefferson's Reputation", 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1780s, few Americans knew or cared who wrote the Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, "Jefferson's Reputation", 172, 179.&lt;/ref&gt; But in the next decade, [[Democratic-Republican Party|Jeffersonian Republicans]] sought political advantage over their rival [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] by promoting both the importance of the Declaration and Jefferson as its author.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, "Jefferson's Reputation", 179; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 168–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Federalists responded by casting doubt on Jefferson's authorship or originality, and by emphasizing that independence was declared by the whole Congress, with Jefferson as just one member of the drafting committee. Federalists insisted that Congress's act of declaring independence, in which Federalist John Adams had played a major role, was more important than the document announcing it.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, "Jefferson's Reputation", 180–84; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 171.&lt;/ref&gt; But this view faded away, like the Federalist Party itself, and, before long, the act of declaring independence became synonymous with the document.

A less partisan appreciation for the Declaration emerged in the years following the [[War of 1812]], thanks to a growing American nationalism and a renewed interest in the history of the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Detweiler, "Changing Reputation", 571–72; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 175–78.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1817, Congress commissioned [[John Trumbull]]'s [[Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)|famous painting]] of the signers, which was exhibited to large crowds before being installed in the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]].&lt;ref&gt;Detweiler, "Changing Reputation", 572; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 175.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest commemorative printings of the Declaration also appeared at this time, offering many Americans their first view of the signed document.&lt;ref&gt;Detweiler, "Changing Reputation", 572; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 175–76; Wills, ''Inventing America'', 324. See also John C. Fitzpatrick, ''Spirit of the Revolution'' (Boston 1924).&lt;/ref&gt; Collective biographies of the signers were first published in the 1820s,&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 176.&lt;/ref&gt; giving birth to what Garry Wills called the "cult of the signers".&lt;ref&gt;Wills, ''Inventing America'', 90.&lt;/ref&gt; In the years that followed, many stories about the writing and signing of the document were published for the first time.

When interest in the Declaration was revived, the sections that were most important in 1776 were no longer relevant: the announcement of the independence of the United States and the grievances against King George. But the second paragraph was applicable long after the war had ended, with its talk of self-evident truths and unalienable rights.&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, "Global History", 93.&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution and the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] lacked sweeping statements about rights and equality, and advocates of groups with grievances turned to the Declaration for support.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 196–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the 1820s, variations of the Declaration were issued to proclaim the rights of workers, farmers, women, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 197. See also Philip S. Foner, ed., ''We, the Other People: Alternative Declarations of Independence by Labor Groups, Farmers, Woman's Rights Advocates, Socialists, and Blacks, 1829–1975'' (Urbana 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1848, for example, the [[Seneca Falls Convention]] of women's rights advocates [[Declaration of Sentiments|declared]] that "all men and women are created equal".&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 197; Armitage, ''Global History'', 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== John Trumbull's ''Declaration of Independence'' (1817–1826)===
{{main|Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)}}
[[File:Declaration of Independence (1819), by John Trumbull.jpg|thumb|upright=.90|alt=About 50 men, most of them seated, are in a large meeting room. Most are focused on the five men standing in the center of the room. The tallest of the five is laying a document on a table.|[[John Trumbull]]'s [[Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)|famous painting]] is often identified as a depiction of the signing of the Declaration, but it actually shows the drafting committee presenting its work to the Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Wills, ''Inventing America'', 348.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[John Trumbull]]'s painting ''Declaration of Independence'' has played a significant role in popular conceptions of the Declaration of Independence. The painting is {{convert|12|by|18|ft|adj=on}} in size and was commissioned by the [[United States Congress]] in 1817; it has hung in the [[United States Capitol Rotunda]] since 1826. It is sometimes described as the signing of the Declaration of Independence, but it actually shows the [[Committee of Five]] presenting their draft of the Declaration to the [[Second Continental Congress]] on June 28, 1776, and not the signing of the document, which took place later.&lt;ref&gt;John Hazelton, The Historical Value of Trumbull's – Declaration of Independence, [https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA30&amp;id=tv47AAAAIAAJ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography – Volume 31], (Historical Society of Pennsylvania, 1907), 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trumbull painted the figures from life whenever possible, but some had died and images could not be located; hence, the painting does not include all the signers of the Declaration. One figure had participated in the drafting but did not sign the final document; another refused to sign. In fact, the membership of the Second Continental Congress changed as time passed, and the figures in the painting were never in the same room at the same time. It is, however, an accurate depiction of the room in [[Independence Hall]], the centerpiece of the [[Independence National Historical Park]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].

Trumbull's painting has been depicted multiple times on U.S. currency and postage stamps. Its first use was on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] side of the $100 [[National Bank Note]] issued in 1863. A few years later, the [[steel engraving]] used in printing the bank notes was used to produce a 24-cent stamp, issued as part of the [[1869 Pictorial Issue]]. An engraving of the signing scene has been featured on the reverse side of the [[United States two-dollar bill]] since 1976.

===Slavery and the Declaration===
{{further |Slavery in the colonial United States}}
The apparent contradiction between the claim that "all men are created equal" and the existence of [[Slavery in the United States|American slavery]] attracted comment when the Declaration was first published. As mentioned above, Jefferson had included a paragraph in his initial draft that strongly indicted Great Britain's role in the slave trade, but this was deleted from the final version.&lt;ref name="MaierAmerican"&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 146–50.&lt;/ref&gt;   Jefferson himself was a prominent [[Virginia]] slave holder, having owned hundreds of slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen (1969), ''Thomas Jefferson and the Problem of Slavery''&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to this seeming contradiction, English abolitionist [[Thomas Day]] wrote in a 1776 letter, "If there be an object truly ridiculous in nature, it is an American patriot, signing resolutions of independency with the one hand, and with the other brandishing a whip over his affrighted slaves."&lt;ref&gt;(1) [https://books.google.com/books?id=X2QCAa27Zy4C&amp;pg=PA77 Armitage, ''Global History'', 77.]&lt;br /&gt;(2) {{cite book|last=Day|first=Thomas|url=https://archive.org/stream/fragmentoforigin00dayt#page/10/mode/2up|title=Fragment of an original letter on the Slavery of the Negroes, written in the year 1776|work=London: Printed for John Stockdale (1784).

In the 19th century, the Declaration took on a special significance for the abolitionist movement. Historian [[Bertram Wyatt-Brown]] wrote that "abolitionists tended to interpret the Declaration of Independence as a theological as well as a political document".&lt;ref name=WB287&gt;Wyatt-Brown, ''Lewis Tappan'', 287.&lt;/ref&gt; Abolitionist leaders [[Benjamin Lundy]] and [[William Lloyd Garrison]] adopted the "twin rocks" of "the Bible and the Declaration of Independence" as the basis for their philosophies. "As long as there remains a single copy of the Declaration of Independence, or of the Bible, in our land," wrote Garrison, "we will not despair."&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, ''All on Fire'', 53, 115.&lt;/ref&gt; For radical abolitionists such as Garrison, the most important part of the Declaration was its assertion of the [[right of revolution]]. Garrison called for the destruction of the government under the Constitution, and the creation of a new state dedicated to the principles of the Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 198–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversial question of whether to add additional [[slave state]]s to the United States coincided with the growing stature of the Declaration. The first major public debate about slavery and the Declaration took place during the [[Missouri Compromise|Missouri controversy]] of 1819 to 1821.&lt;ref&gt;Detweiler, "Congressional Debate", 598.&lt;/ref&gt; Antislavery Congressmen argued that the language of the Declaration indicated that the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] had been opposed to slavery in principle, and so new slave states should not be added to the country.&lt;ref&gt;Detweiler, "Congressional Debate", 604.&lt;/ref&gt; Proslavery Congressmen led by Senator [[Nathaniel Macon]] of North Carolina argued that the Declaration was not a part of the Constitution and therefore had no relevance to the question.&lt;ref&gt;Detweiler, "Congressional Debate", 605.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the antislavery movement gaining momentum, defenders of slavery such as [[John Randolph of Roanoke|John Randolph]] and [[John C. Calhoun]] found it necessary to argue that the Declaration's assertion that "all men are created equal" was false, or at least that it did not apply to black people.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 199; Bailyn, ''Ideological Origins'', 246.&lt;/ref&gt; During the debate over the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]] in 1853, for example, Senator [[John Pettit]] of Indiana argued that the statement "all men are created equal" was not a "self-evident truth" but a "self-evident lie".&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 200.&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of the Kansas–Nebraska Act, including [[Salmon P. Chase]] and [[Benjamin Wade]], defended the Declaration and what they saw as its antislavery principles.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 200–01.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lincoln and the Declaration===
[[File:Abelincoln1846.jpeg|thumb |upright=0.90|right|Congressman [[Abraham Lincoln]],&lt;br /&gt; 1845–1846]]
The Declaration's relationship to slavery was taken up in 1854 by [[Abraham Lincoln]], a little-known former Congressman who idolized the Founding Fathers.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 201–02.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln thought that the Declaration of Independence expressed the highest principles of the American Revolution, and that the Founding Fathers had tolerated slavery with the expectation that it would ultimately wither away.&lt;ref name="McPherson126"/&gt; For the United States to legitimize the expansion of slavery in the Kansas-Nebraska Act, thought Lincoln, was to repudiate the principles of the Revolution. In his October 1854 [[Abraham Lincoln Peoria speech|Peoria speech]], Lincoln said:

{{quote|Nearly eighty years ago we began by declaring that all men are created equal; but now from that beginning we have run down to the other declaration, that for some men to enslave others is a "sacred right of self-government".… Our republican robe is soiled and trailed in the dust.…  Let us repurify it. Let us re-adopt the Declaration of Independence, and with it, the practices, and policy, which harmonize with it.… If we do this, we shall not only have saved the Union: but we shall have saved it, as to make, and keep it, forever worthy of the saving.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, ''Second American Revolution'', 126–27.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The meaning of the Declaration was a recurring topic in the [[Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858|famed debates]] between Lincoln and [[Stephen Douglas]] in 1858. Douglas argued that the phrase "all men are created equal" in the Declaration referred to white men only. The purpose of the Declaration, he said, had simply been to justify the independence of the United States, and not to proclaim the equality of any "inferior or degraded race".&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln, however, thought that the language of the Declaration was deliberately universal, setting a high moral standard to which the American republic should aspire. "I had thought the Declaration contemplated the progressive improvement in the condition of all men everywhere," he said.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 204–05.&lt;/ref&gt; During the seventh and last joint debate with Steven Douglas at Alton, Illinois on October 15, 1858, Lincoln said about the declaration:

{{quote|I think the authors of that notable instrument intended to include all men, but they did not mean to declare all men equal in all respects. They did not mean to say all men were equal in color, size, intellect, moral development, or social capacity. They defined with tolerable distinctness in what they did consider all men created equal—equal in "certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." This they said, and this they meant. They did not mean to assert the obvious untruth that all were then actually enjoying that equality, or yet that they were about to confer it immediately upon them. In fact, they had no power to confer such a boon. They meant simply to declare the right, so that the enforcement of it might follow as fast as circumstances should permit. They meant to set up a standard maxim for free society which should be familiar to all, constantly looked to, constantly labored for, and even, though never perfectly attained, constantly approximated, and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its influence, and augmenting the happiness and value of life to all people, of all colors, everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Abraham Lincoln (1809–1865): Political Debates Between Lincoln and Douglas 1897 |page=415 |url=http://www.bartleby.com/251/pages/page415.html |publisher=Bartleby |accessdate=January 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Pauline Maier, Douglas's interpretation was more historically accurate, but Lincoln's view ultimately prevailed. "In Lincoln's hands," wrote Maier, "the Declaration of Independence became first and foremost a living document" with "a set of goals to be realized over time".&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|align=right|width=33%|quote=[T]here is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence, the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I hold that he is as much entitled to these as the white man.|source=—Abraham Lincoln, 1858&lt;ref&gt;Wills, ''Lincoln at Gettysburg'', 100.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Like [[Daniel Webster]], [[James Wilson]], and [[Joseph Story]] before him, Lincoln argued that the Declaration of Independence was a founding document of the United States, and that this had important implications for interpreting the Constitution, which had been ratified more than a decade after the Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;Wills, ''Lincoln at Gettysburg'', 129–31.&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution did not use the word "equality", yet Lincoln believed that the concept that "all men are created equal" remained a part of the nation's founding principles.&lt;ref&gt;Wills, ''Lincoln at Gettysburg'', 145.&lt;/ref&gt; He famously expressed this belief in the opening sentence of his 1863 [[Gettysburg Address]]: "Four score and seven years ago [i.e. in 1776] our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal."

Lincoln's [[Declarationism|view of the Declaration]] became influential, seeing it as a moral guide to interpreting the Constitution. "For most people now," wrote Garry Wills in 1992, "the Declaration means what Lincoln told us it means, as a way of correcting the Constitution itself without overthrowing it."&lt;ref&gt;Wills, ''Lincoln at Gettysburg'', 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Admirers of Lincoln such as [[Harry V. Jaffa]] praised this development. Critics of Lincoln, notably [[Willmoore Kendall]] and [[Mel Bradford]], argued that Lincoln dangerously expanded the scope of the national government and violated [[states' rights]] by reading the Declaration into the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Wills, ''Lincoln at Gettysburg'', 39, 145–46. See also Harry V. Jaffa, ''Crisis of the House Divided'' (1959) and ''A New Birth of Freedom: Abraham Lincoln and the Coming of the Civil War'' (2000); Willmoore Kendall and George W. Carey, ''The Basic Symbols of the American Political Tradition'' (1970); and M.E. Bradford, "The Heresy of Equality: A Reply to Harry Jaffa" (1976), reprinted in ''A Better Guide than Reason'' (1979) and ''Modern Age, the First Twenty-five Years'' (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's suffrage and the Declaration===
[[File:ElizabethCadyStanton-1848-Daniel-Henry.jpg|upright=0.6|thumb |right |Elizabeth Cady Stanton and her two sons (1848).]]

In July 1848, the first woman's rights convention, the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], was held in [[Seneca Falls (hamlet), New York|Seneca Falls]], [[New York (state)|New York]].  The convention was organized by [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], [[Lucretia Mott]], Mary Ann McClintock, and Jane Hunt. In their "[[Declaration of Sentiments]]", patterned on the Declaration of Independence, the convention members demanded social and political equality for women. Their motto was that "All men ''and women'' are created equal" and the convention demanded [[suffrage]] for women.  The suffrage movement was supported by [[William Lloyd Garrison]] and [[Frederick Douglass]].&lt;ref&gt;Norton, et al (2010), p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/senecafalls.html|title=Modern History Sourcebook: Seneca Falls: The Declaration of Sentiments, 1848|publisher=|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twentieth century and later===
The Declaration was chosen to be the first digitized text (1971).&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|first=Alison| last=Flood |work=The Guardian |title=Michael Hart, inventor of the ebook, dies aged 64 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/08/michael-hart-inventor-ebook-dies |date=September 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Memorial to the 56 Signers of the Declaration of Independence]] was dedicated in 1984 in [[Constitution Gardens]] on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], where the signatures of all the original signers are carved in stone with their names, places of residence, and occupations.

The new [[One World Trade Center]] building in [[New York City]] (2014) is 1776 feet high to symbolize the year that the Declaration of Independence was signed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/10/us/new-york-world-trade-center-spire/index.html?hpt=hp_abar_wknd |title=Crews finish installing World Trade Center spire |publisher=CNN |date=May 10, 2013 |accessdate=July 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?cityID=8 |title=Tallest buildings in NY |publisher=Skyscraperpage.com |accessdate=June 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?25002165 |title=Tallest buildings under construction in the world |publisher=Skyscraperpage.com |accessdate=June 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular culture===
The adoption of the Declaration of Independence was dramatized in the 1969 Tony Award–winning musical ''[[1776 (musical)|1776]]'' and the [[1776 (film)|1972 film version]], as well as in the 2008 television miniseries ''[[John Adams (miniseries)|John Adams]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1776themusical.us/about-us/|title=1776: The Musical About Us|publisher=Pratico|accessdate=May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hbo.com/john-adams/episodes/2-independence/synopsis|title=John Adams: Independence|publisher=Home Box Office, Inc.|accessdate=May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, [[The 5th Dimension]] recorded the opening of the Declaration on their album ''[[Portrait (The 5th Dimension album)|Portrait]]'' in the song "Declaration".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4079">'''''Urreligion''''' is a notion of an "original" or "oldest" form of [[religious tradition]] ({{wikt-lang|de|ur-}} being a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [[prefix]] for "original, primitive, elder, primeval, or ''{{wt|en|proto-}}''"). The term contrasts with [[organized religion]], such as the [[theocracy|theocracies]] of the early [[Cities of the Ancient Near East|urban]] cultures of the [[Ancient Near East]] or [[major religions|current world religions]].
The term originates in [[German Romanticism]].

==History==
[[Friedrich Creuzer]] put forward the notion of a monotheistic primeval religion  in 1810 - an idea taken up by other authors of the [[Romantic period]], such as [[J. J. Bachofen]],&lt;ref&gt;
In his ''Mutterrecht und Urreligion '', Bachofen connects primeval religion and [[matriarchy]].
&lt;/ref&gt; but decidedly opposed by [[Johann Heinrich Voss]].&lt;ref&gt;
''Symbolik und Mythologie der alten Völker, besonders der Griechen. In Vorträgen und Entwürfen.'' Leipzig and Darmstadt, Heyer und Leske, 1810-12.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Goethe]] in a conversation with [[Eckermann]] on 11 March 1832 discussed the human ''Urreligion'', which he characterized as "pure nature and [pure] reason, of divine origin".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeno.org/Literatur/M/Goethe,+Johann+Wolfgang/Gespr%C3%A4che/%5BZu+den+Gespr%C3%A4chen%5D/1832 Gespräche]&lt;/ref&gt;
The final scene of his ''[[Faust Part Two]]'' (1832) has been taken as evoking "the 'Urreligion' of mankind".&lt;ref&gt;
Biblical Borrowings in Goethe's "Faust": A Historical Survey of Their Interpretation, by O. Durrani The Modern Language Review 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

Often used in the sense of [[natural religion]] or [[indigenous religion]], the religious behaviour of pre-modern [[tribal societies]] such as [[shamanism]], [[animism]] and [[ancestor worship]] (e.g. [[Australian aboriginal mythology]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15220540.600-flood-gave-birth-to-worlds-oldest-religion.html newscientist.com]
&lt;/ref&gt;), the term ''Urreligion'' has also been used by adherents of various religions to back up the claim that their own religion is somehow "primeval" or "older" than competing traditions. In the context of a given religious faith, literal belief in a [[creation myth|creation]] may be the base of primality. (e.g. [[Biblical literalism]], or literal belief in the [[Hindu]] [[Puranas]]).

In particular, [[Urmonotheismus]] comprises the historical claim that primeval religion was [[monotheistic]]. Some have rejected this hypothesis,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and certain [[Christian apologetics]] circles defend it.&lt;ref&gt;
Pajak, Sylwester, ''Urreligion und Uroffenbarung bei P. W. Schmidt'', St. Augustin 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nineteenth-century [[Germanic mysticism]] sometimes claimed that the [[Germanic runes]] bore testimony of a primeval religion.&lt;ref&gt;

Some more recent [[new religious movements]] that claim to restore primeval religion include [[Godianism]]&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Religijne symbole0.png|thumb|right|The world religions paradigm selects a small number of religious groups which it classes as 'major'.]]
'''World religions''' is a category used in the [[Religious studies|study of religion]] to demarcate the five—and in some cases six—largest and most internationally widespread religious movements. [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]] are always included in the list, being known as the "Big Five". Some scholars also include another religion, such as [[Sikhism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], or the [[Bahá'í Faith]], in the category. 

The world religions paradigm was developed in the United Kingdom in the 1960s, where it was pioneered by [[phenomenology of religion|phenomenological]] scholars like [[Ninian Smart]]. It was designed to broaden the study of religion away from its heavy focus on Christianity by taking into account other large religious traditions around the world.  
The paradigm is often used by lecturers instructing undergraduate students in the study of religion and is also the framework used by school teachers in the UK and other countries. The paradigm's emphasis on viewing these religious movements as distinct and mutually exclusive entities has also had a wider impact on the categorisation of religion—for instance in censuses—in both Western countries and elsewhere.

Since the late twentieth century, the paradigm has faced critique by scholars of religion like [[Jonathan Z. Smith]], some of whom have argued for its abandonment. Critics have argued that the world religions paradigm is inappropriate because it takes the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] variant of Christianity as the model for what constitutes religion; that it is tied up with discourses of modernity, including modern power relations; that it encourages an uncritical understanding of religion; and that it makes a value judgement as to what religions should be considered "major". Others have argued that it remains useful in the classroom, so long as students are made aware that it is a socially constructed category.

==Definition==

The scholars of religion Christopher R. Cotter and David G. Robertson described the "World Religions Paradigm" as "a particular way of thinking about religions which organizes them into a set of discrete traditions with a supposedly 'global' import."{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016a|p=vii}} It typically consists of the "Big Five" religions: [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Owen|1y=2011|1p=254|2a1=Cotter|2a2=Robertson|2y=2016b|2p=2}} 
As noted by Cotter and Robertson, the "Big Five" religions are often listed in an "Abrahamocentric order" which places the largest three [[Abrahamic religions]]—Christianity, Judaism, and Islam—before the non-Abrahamic religions Hinduism and Buddhism.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=2}} The category is sometimes also extended to include other religious groups, namely [[Sikhism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], and the [[Bahá'í Faith]].{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}}

The inclusion of Judaism in the Big Five raises some issues; it is included in the list because of its influence on Christianity and Islam and because of its relevance to traditional Western understandings of Western history.{{sfn|Taira|2016|p=80}} On demographic grounds, it does not fit into the list, for there are far fewer Jews in the world than there are Christians, Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists.{{sfn|Taira|2016|p=80}} Similarly, it does not fit into the list if the groups are defined by a desire to spread internationally, because Judaism is typically non-proselytizing.{{sfn|Taira|2016|p=80}}

Many scholars have utilised the "World Religions" category alongside other "catch-all" categories such as "[[new religious movements]]" and "[[indigenous religions]]".{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=2}} The scholar Steven J. Sutcliffe compared the relationship between the three categories to the [[English football league system]], with the "world" religions forming a [[Premier League]], the "new" religions forming a [[EFL Championship|Championship]], and "indigenous" religions a [[Football League First Division|First Division]].{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2016|p=26}} That groups that get placed in categories like "indigenous religions" get treated less seriously than the "world religions" by many scholars was noted by the scholar of religion Graham Harvey, who maintained that "indigenous religions should receive similarly respectful treatment to that considered appropriate to the larger 'World Religions'."{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=3}}

==History==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=While the World Religions paradigm was brought in to allow the inclusion of non-Christian religions in education, it has instead remodelled them according to liberal Western Protestant Christian values (akin to what the [[Church of England]] promotes), emphasizing theological categories..|source=— Scholar of religion Suzanne Owen, 2011{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=258}} }}

Cotter and Robertson noted that the history of the world religions paradigm is "intimately tied up" with the history of the study of religion as an academic discipline.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=3}} It emerged from within the [[phenomenology of religion]] approach which placed an emphasis on description rather than critical analysis.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=258}} 

The paradigm was integrated throughout the education system through work of scholars like [[Ninian Smart]], who formed the Shap Working Party on World Religions in Education in 1969.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}} It was introduced with the intent of moving Western education away from its focus on Christianity.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}} However, it took liberal Western Protestantism as its baseline and interpreted these different religious traditions through the framework of liberal Protestant norms and values.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}} This included an emphasis on [[theology]] as being central to a given religion.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}} It also reflects the post-Enlightenment Christian approach of treating different religious groups as distinct, mutually exclusive categories.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=260}} It thus reflects the socio-political concerns of 1960s Britain, the environment in which it was devised.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=259}}

The paradigm has since gone beyond this academic discipline, and "informs the perception" of many members of different religious groups.{{sfn|Ramey|2016|p=50}} The paradigm for instance frames the teaching about religion in the British education system; at all three [[Key Stage]]s, British teachers are instructed to teach about Christianity, while by the end of key Stage 3 they are also supposed to teach about the other "five principal religions": Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=263}} Similarly, the censuses of many countries for instance reflect the influence of the world religion paradigm by only permitting respondents to describe themselves as adhering to one particular religious tradition, whereas in reality many individuals identify themselves with various different traditions at the same time.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=260}} This idea of mutually exclusive religious identities is not only a Western phenomenon, but can also be found in other socio-cultural contexts; [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalists]] for instance often endorse the idea that Hinduism and Buddhism are mutually exclusive categories despite the fact that many people in South Asia mix Hindu and Buddhist practices.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=260}}
The scholars of religion Tara Baldrick-Morrone, Michael Graziano, and Brad Stoddard stated that "the WRP is neither neutral nor natural, but its social authority derives from appearing as both."{{sfn|Baldrick-Morrone|Graziano|Stoddard|2016|p=38}}

==Criticism==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=[A 'world religion' is] a tradition that has achieved sufficient power and numbers to enter our history to form it, interact with it, or thwart it. We recognise both the unity within and the diversity among the world religions because they correspond to important geopolitical entities with which we must deal. All 'primitives,' by way of contrast, may be lumped together, as may the 'minor religions,' because they do not confront our history in any direct fashion. From the point of view of power, they are invisible.|source=— Scholar of religion [[J. Z. Smith]], 1998{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=8}} }}

The utility of the  World Religions Paradigm has experienced a sustained and rigorous critique from many scholars of religion.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=7}} In 1978, the scholar of religion [[Jonathan Z. Smith]] for example called it a "dubious category".{{sfn|Smith|1978|p=295}}

One of the major criticisms of the framework is that it is based on a model of 'religion' that is highly reliant on using the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] version of Christianity as its base example.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=7}} A second criticism is that it is rooted in the discourses of modernity, including the [[power relations]] present in modern society.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=7}} Smith observed that it was constructed by Western scholars from a Western perspective. He noted that the only religions that get included in it are those which have "achieved sufficient power and numbers to enter our [i.e. Western] history, either to form it, interact with it, or to thwart it" and represent "important geo-political entities with which we must deal."{{sfn|Smith|1978|p=295}} The framework also includes privileging the literate elites active in particular religious movements by presenting their interpretations of particular traditions as being authoritative, eclipsing alternative interpretations presented by non-literate, marginalised, and localized practitioners.{{sfnm|1a1=Owen|1y=2011|1p=255|2a1=Cotter|2a2=Robertson|2y=2016b|2pp=8–9}} For instance, as noted by the scholar of religion Suzanne Owen, "Hinduism as a World Religion does not include Hinduism as a village religion".{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=255}}

A third criticism of the world religions paradigm is that it encourages an uncritical and ''sui generis'' model of 'religion'.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=7}} It presents each of the 'world religions' in an abstracted and essentialised form, failing to take account of hybridization.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=259}} For instance, in teaching about Christianity it does not refer to [[reincarnation]], because this is not typically regarded as a Christian doctrine, and yet there are Christians who profess a belief in reincarnation.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=259}}
A fourth criticism is that in choosing to focus attention on the "major" religions, it makes a value judgement as to what constitutes "major" and what does not.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=12}} 

===Paradigm in pedagogy===

Many scholars of religion have resisted efforts to challenge the paradigm,{{sfn|Cox|2016|p=xii}} and as of 2016 was reported as still being widespread in university introductory courses to the study of religion.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=10}} Many instructors feel that explaining the critique of the world religions paradigm to undergraduate students would be difficult, as the critique would be too complex for many of them to understand.{{sfn|Ramey|2016|p=49}} Its continued use has also been defended by the claim that it is what undergraduate students expect and that it mirrors what they will have been taught at school.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}}

Some scholars have argued for the rejection of the world religions paradigm altogether; Cotter and Robertson presented the argument that "the continued uncritical use of the WRP fosters a breeding ground for relativistic navel-gazing which has no place in the contemporary research university".{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=10}} Owen was of the view that "as long as it continues to employ the World Religions paradigm as a default approach (even after deconstructing it), religious studies will fail in its humanistic task" because it will simply be engaging in "knowledge transfer" and not "critically engaging" with "culture and knowledge".{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=257}} One alternative framework that some scholars use to teach about religion is the "[[lived religion]]" paradigm, which places emphasis not on distinct religious traditions but on individual experiences and practices.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=12}} Another alternative is the "[[material religion]]" framework which focuses on examining religion through [[material culture]] and physical objects.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|pp=12–13}} Owen noted that, in her experience, many students display an "initial resistance to alternatives" as they are expecting the world religions paradigm. She cited the example of her introductory course at [[Leeds Trinity University College]], which was constructed on thematic lines rather than according to the world religions paradigm, and which induced feelings of panic among many undergraduates.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=258}}

Many scholars who are critical of the world religions paradigm find themselves having to teach it as part of introductory courses for undergraduate students.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=258}} Some spent much of a course teaching the concept and then several sessions after this deconstructing it.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=258}} Some scholars have suggested that even when students are taught using the world religions paradigm, it could be a good means of encouraging them to think critically about category formation.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=13}} The scholar Steven W. Ramey for instance advocated teaching the paradigm in a manner that makes it clear that it is a "constructed discourse".{{sfn|Ramey|2016|p=48}} Similarly, Baldrick-Morrone, Graziano, and Stoddard suggested that teaching undergraduates about the world religious paradigm helps to explain to students how "classification is a social act".{{sfn|Baldrick-Morrone|Graziano|Stoddard|2016|p=39}} They noted that students could leave such a course not only knowing more about the specific religious traditions included in the world religions category, but that they would also leave "knowing how to better interrogate the world around them".{{sfn|Baldrick-Morrone|Graziano|Stoddard|2016|p=39}} To avoid promoting the paradigm's portrayal of different religious traditions as rigid, homogenous categories, the scholar Teemu Taira suggested introducing [[ethnography|ethnographic]] case studies into the class to better explain the realities of people's lives and uses of religious traditions.{{sfn|Taira|2016|p=82}}

The '''world tree''' is a [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] present in several religions and mythologies, particularly [[Indo-European religion]]s, Siberian religions, and [[Native American religion]]s.  The world tree is represented as a colossal tree which supports the [[heaven]]s, thereby connecting the heavens, the terrestrial world, and, through its roots, the [[underworld]]. It may also be strongly connected to the motif of the [[tree of life]], but it is the source of [[Yggdrasil|wisdom of the ages]].

Specific world trees include ''[[égig érő fa]]'' in [[Hungarian mythology]], Ağaç Ana in [[Turkic mythology]], Modun in [[Mongol mythology]], ''[[Yggdrasil]]'' (or ''[[Irminsul]]'') in [[Germanic mythology|Germanic]] (including [[Norse mythology|Norse]]) mythology, the [[oak]] in [[Slavic paganism|Slavic]], [[Finnish mythology|Finnish]] and [[Baltic mythology|Baltic]], [[Iroko]] in [[Yoruba religion]], ''Jianmu'' in [[Chinese mythology]], and in [[Hindu mythology]] the ''[[Ashvattha]]'' (a ''[[Ficus religiosa]]'').

==In specific cultures==
===American pre-Columbian cultures===
{{Main|Mesoamerican world tree}}
* Among [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]]n cultures, the concept of "world trees" is a prevalent motif in Mesoamerican cosmologies and iconography. The [[Temple of the Cross Complex]] at [[Palenque]] contains one of the most studied examples of the world tree in architectural motifs of all Mayan ruins. World trees embodied the four cardinal directions, which represented also the fourfold nature of a central world tree, a symbolic ''[[axis mundi]]'' connecting the planes of the Underworld and the sky with that of the terrestrial world.&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Taube (1993), p.186.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Depictions of world trees, both in their directional and central aspects, are found in the art and traditions of cultures such as the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Aztec]], [[Izapa]]n, [[Mixtec]], [[Olmec]], and others, dating to at least the Mid/Late Formative periods of [[Mesoamerican chronology]]. Among the Maya, the central world tree was conceived as, or represented by, a [[ceiba]] tree, called ''yax imix che'' ('blue-green tree of abundance') by the Book of [[Chilam Balam]] of Chumayel.&lt;ref&gt;Roys 1967: 100&lt;/ref&gt; The trunk of the tree could also be represented by an upright [[caiman]], whose skin evokes the tree's spiny trunk.&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Taube, ''loc. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Directional world trees are also associated with the four Yearbearers in [[Mesoamerican calendars]], and the directional colors and deities. [[Mesoamerican codices]] which have this association outlined include the [[Dresden Codex|Dresden]], [[Codex Borgia|Borgia]] and [[Codex Fejérváry-Mayer|Fejérváry-Mayer]] [[codex|codices]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; It is supposed that Mesoamerican sites and ceremonial centers frequently had actual trees planted at each of the four cardinal directions, representing the quadripartite concept.
* World trees are frequently depicted with birds in their branches, and their roots extending into earth or water (sometimes atop a "water-monster", symbolic of the underworld).
* The central world tree has also been interpreted as a representation of the band of the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;Freidel, ''et al.'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Izapa Stela 5]] contains a possible representation of a world tree.

A common theme in most indigenous cultures of the Americas is a concept of directionality (the horizontal and vertical planes), with the vertical dimension often being represented by a world tree. Some scholars have argued that the religious importance of the horizontal and vertical dimensions in many [[animist]] cultures may derive from the human body and the position it occupies in the world as it perceives the surrounding living world. Many Indigenous cultures of the Americas have similar cosmologies regarding the directionality and the world tree, however the type of tree representing the world tree depends on the surrounding environment. For many Indigenous American peoples located in more temperate regions for example, it is the [[spruce]] rather than the ceiba that is the world tree; however the idea of cosmic directions combined with a concept of a tree uniting the directional planes is similar.

===Baltic mythology===
The world tree is widespread in Lithuanian folk painting, and is frequently found carved into household furniture such as cupboards, towel holders, and laundry beaters.&lt;ref&gt;Straižys and Klimka, chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lithuanian.net/mitai/cosmos/baltai2.htm Cosmology of the Ancient Balts - 3. The concept of the World-Tree] (from the 'lithuanian.net' website. Accessed 2008-12-26.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The world tree ({{lang-lv|Austras koks}} - "Tree of Dawn") also was one of the most important beliefs in [[Latvian mythology]].

===Iranian mythology===
[[File:A rhyton from Marlik, Iran, 1000 BC.jpg|thumb|Two winged bull are guarding a sacred tree, on a rhyton from [[Marlik]], Iran, currently at the [[National Museum of Iran]]]]

In the [[Iranian mythology]], [[Gaokerena]] or white [[Haoma]], is a tree that its vivacity would certify continuance of life in universe. Bas tokhmak is another world tree with remedial attribute, it's retentive of all herbal seeds, and destroyer of sorrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://jfava.ut.ac.ir/article_36319.html |title= Plant of life, in Ancient Iran, Mesopotamia &amp; Egypt |date=2013 |publisher= Tehran: Honarhay-e Ziba Journal, Vol. 18, No. 2, p. 15. |last= Taheri |first= Sadreddin}}&lt;/ref&gt; World tree is a common motif in ancient art of Iran.

===Jewish mythology===
The [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil]] and the [[Tree of life (biblical)|Tree of life]] are both components of the [[Garden of Eden]] story in the [[Book of Genesis]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]].  According to [[Jewish mythology]], in the [[Garden of Eden]] there is a tree of life or the "tree of souls"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9dRi8v-j7OMC&amp;lpg=PA153 |title= Origins of the Kabbalah |publisher= Books.google.com |date= |access-date=2014-05-01 |isbn= 0691020477 |year= 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; that blossoms and produces new [[souls]], which fall into the [[Guf]], the ''Treasury of Souls''. The Angel [[Gabriel]] reaches into the treasury and takes out the first soul that comes into his hand. Then [[Lailah]], the Angel of Conception, watches over the embryo until it is born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.scribd.com/doc/95135842/224/THE-TREASURY-OF-SOULS |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121030044612/http://www.scribd.com/doc/95135842/224/THE-TREASURY-OF-SOULS |archivedate=2012-10-30 |title=200_ THE TREASURY OF SOULS for Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism |work= Scribd |deadurl= yes |access-date= 15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norse mythology===
In [[Norse mythology]], [[Yggdrasil]] is the world tree. Yggdrasil is attested in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]. In both sources, Yggdrasil is an immense [[Fraxinus excelsior|ash tree]] that is central and considered very holy. The [[Æsir]] go to Yggdrasil daily to hold their courts. The branches of Yggdrasil extend far into the heavens, and the tree is supported by three roots that extend far away into other locations; one to the well [[Urðarbrunnr]] in the heavens, one to the spring [[Hvergelmir]], and another to the well [[Mímisbrunnr]]. Creatures live within Yggdrasil, including the [[Deer|hart]]s [[Dáinn, Dvalinn, Duneyrr and Duraþrór]], the giant in eagle-shape [[Hræsvelgr]], the squirrel [[Ratatoskr]] and the [[Norse dragon|wyrm]] [[Níðhöggr]]. Scholarly theories have been proposed about the etymology of the name ''Yggdrasil'', the potential relation to the trees [[Mímameiðr]] and [[Læraðr]], and the [[sacred tree at Uppsala]].

===North-Asian, Siberian, Mongol and Turkic cultures===
The world tree is also represented in the mythologies and [[folklore]] of [[North Asia]] and [[Siberia]]. In the mythology of the [[Samoyedic peoples|Samoyeds]], the world tree connects different realities (underworld, this world, upper world) together. In their mythology the world tree is also the symbol of [[Mother Nature|Mother Earth]] who is said to give the Samoyed [[Shamanism|shaman]] his drum and also help him travel from one world to another.

The symbol of the world tree is also common in [[Tengrism]], an ancient religion of [[Mongols]] and [[Turkic peoples]].

The world tree is visible in the designs of the [[Crown of Silla]], [[Silla]] being one of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]]. This link is used to establish a connection between Siberian peoples and those of [[Korea]].

===South Asian religions===
Remnants are also evident in the [[Kalpavriksha]] ("wish-fulfilling tree") and the [[Ashvattha]] tree of the [[South Asian]] religions.

In [[Brahma Kumaris]] religion, the World Tree is portrayed as the "Kalpa Vriksha Tree", or "Tree of Humanity", in which the founder Brahma Baba ([[Dada Lekhraj]]) and his Brahma Kumaris followers are shown as the roots of the humanity who enjoy 2,500 years of paradise as living deities before trunk of humanity splits and the founders of other religions incarnate. Each creates their own branch and brings with them their own followers, until they too decline and split. Twig like schisms, cults and sects appear at the end of the Iron Age.&lt;ref&gt;Walliss, John (2002). From World-Rejection to Ambivalence. Ashgate Publishing. pp. 33. {{ISBN|978-0-7546-0951-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary origins==
Some scholars suggest that the world tree is programmed into the human mind by evolutionary biology. Theory suggests that human beings are primates, and lived in trees for around 60 million years. The idea of a vast tree as the entirety of the world is thus still implanted in our collective unconscious.&lt;ref name=Burkert&gt;[[#refBurkertW|Burkert, ''Creation of the Sacred'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Haycock&gt;[[#refHaycockDE|Haycock, ''Being and Perceiving'']]&lt;/ref&gt;
