'''Academic art''', or '''academicism''' or '''academism''', is a style of [[painting]], [[sculpture]], and [[architecture]] produced under the influence of European [[academies of art]].  Specifically, academic art is the art and artists influenced by the standards of the French [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]], which was practiced under the movements of [[Neoclassicism]] and [[Romanticism]], and the art that followed these two movements in the attempt to synthesize both of their styles, and which is best reflected by the paintings of [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]], [[Thomas Couture]], and [[Hans Makart]]. In this context it is often called "academism", "academicism", "[[L'art pompier|art pompier]]" (pejoratively), and "eclecticism", and sometimes linked with "[[historicism (art)|historicism]]" and "[[syncretism]]".

== The academies in history ==
The first academy of art was founded in [[Florence]] in Italy by [[Cosimo I de' Medici]], on 13 January 1563, under the influence of the architect [[Giorgio Vasari]] who called it the [[Accademia delle Arti del Disegno|''Accademia e Compagnia delle Arti del Disegno'']] (Academy and Company for the Arts of Drawing) as it was divided in two different operative branches. While the Company was a kind of corporation which every working artist in Tuscany could join, the Academy comprised only the most eminent artistic personalities of Cosimo's court, and had the task of supervising the whole artistic production of the medicean state. In this medicean institution students learned the "arti del disegno" (a term coined by Vasari) and heard lectures on [[anatomy]] and [[geometry]]. Another academy, the [[Accademia di San Luca]] (named after the patron saint of painters, [[St. Luke]]), was founded about a decade later in [[Rome]]. The Accademia di San Luca served an educational function and was more concerned with [[art theory]] than the Florentine one. In 1582 [[Annibale Carracci]] opened his very influential ''Academy of Desiderosi'' in [[Bologna]] without official support; in some ways this was more like a traditional artist's workshop, but that he felt the need to label it as an "academy" demonstrates the attraction of the idea at the time.

Accademia di San Luca later served as the model for the [[Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture]] founded in [[France]] in 1648, and which later became the [[Académie des beaux-arts]]. The Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture was founded in an effort to distinguish artists "who were gentlemen practicing a liberal art" from craftsmen, who were engaged in manual labor. This emphasis on the intellectual component of artmaking had a considerable impact on the subjects and styles of academic art.

After the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture was reorganized in 1661 by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] whose aim was to control all the artistic activity in France, a controversy occurred among the members that dominated artistic attitudes for the rest of the century. This "battle of styles" was a conflict over whether [[Peter Paul Rubens]] or [[Nicolas Poussin]] was a suitable model to follow. Followers of Poussin, called "poussinistes", argued that line (disegno) should dominate art, because of its appeal to the intellect, while followers of Rubens, called "rubenistes", argued that color (colore) should dominate art, because of its appeal to emotion.

The debate was revived in the early 19th century, under the movements of [[Neoclassicism]] typified by the artwork of [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]], and [[Romanticism]] typified by the artwork of [[Eugène Delacroix]]. Debates also occurred over whether it was better to learn art by looking at nature, or to learn by looking at the artistic masters of the past.

Academies using the French model formed throughout Europe, and imitated the teachings and styles of the French Académie. In [[England]], this was the [[Royal Academy]]. The [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]] founded in 1754, may be taken as a successful example in a smaller country, which achieved its aim of producing a national school and reducing the reliance on imported artists. The painters of the [[Danish Golden Age]] of roughly 1800-1850 were nearly all trained there, and many returned to teach and the history of the [[art of Denmark]] is much less marked by tension between academic art and other styles than is the case in other countries.

One effect of the move to academies was to make training more difficult for [[women artists]], who were excluded from most academies until the last half of the 19th century (1861 for the Royal Academy). This was partly because of concerns over the impropriety presented by nudity. Special arrangements were often made for female students until the 20th century.

== Development of the academic style ==
Since the onset of the poussiniste-rubeniste debate, many artists worked between the two styles. In the 19th century, in the revived form of the debate, the attention and the aims of the art world became to synthesize the line of [[Neoclassicism]] with the color of [[Romanticism]]. One artist after another was claimed by critics to have achieved the synthesis, among them [[Théodore Chassériau]], [[Ary Scheffer]], [[Francesco Hayez]], [[Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps]], and [[Thomas Couture]]. [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]], a later academic artist, commented that the trick to being a good painter is seeing "color and line as the same thing".
Thomas Couture promoted the same idea in a book he authored on art method &amp;mdash; arguing that whenever one said a painting had better color or better line it was nonsense, because whenever color appeared brilliant it depended on line to convey it, and vice versa; and that color was really a way to talk about the "value" of form.

Another development during this period included adopting historical styles in order to show the era in history that the painting depicted, called [[historicism (art)|historicism]]. This is best seen in the work of Baron [[Jan August Hendrik Leys]], a later influence on [[James Tissot]]. It's also seen in the development of the [[Neo-Grec]] style. Historicism is also meant to refer to the belief and practice associated with academic art that one should incorporate and conciliate the innovations of different traditions of art from the past.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dusk (Bouguereau).jpg|thumb|left|''Evening''. [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]], 1863.]]  --&gt;
The art world also grew to give increasing focus on [[allegory]] in art. Theories of the importance of both line and color asserted that through these elements an artist exerts control over the medium to create psychological effects, in which themes, emotions, and ideas can be represented. As artists attempted to synthesize these theories in practice, the attention on the artwork as an allegorical or figurative vehicle was emphasized. It was held that the representations in painting and sculpture should evoke [[Platonic form]]s, or ideals, where behind ordinary depictions one would glimpse something abstract, some eternal truth. Hence, [[John Keats|Keats']] famous musing "Beauty is truth, truth beauty". The paintings were desired to be an "idée", a full and complete idea. [[Adolphe William Bouguereau|Bouguereau]] is known to have said that he wouldn't paint "a war", but would paint "War". Many paintings by academic artists are simple nature allegories with titles like ''Dawn'', ''Dusk'', ''Seeing'', and ''Tasting'', where these ideas are personified by a single nude figure, composed in such a way as to bring out the essence of the idea.

The trend in art was also towards greater [[idealism (arts)|idealism]], which is contrary to [[realism (arts)|realism]], in that the figures depicted were made simpler and more abstract—idealized—in order to be able to represent the ideals they stood in for. This would involve both generalizing forms seen in nature, and subordinating them to the unity and theme of the artwork.

Because history and mythology were considered as plays or [[dialectic]]s of ideas, a fertile ground for important allegory, using themes from these subjects was considered the most serious form of painting. A [[hierarchy of genres]], originally created in the 17th century, was valued, where [[history painting]]—classical, religious, mythological, literary, and allegorical subjects—was placed at the top, next [[Genre works|genre painting]], then [[portrait]]ure, [[still-life]], and [[Landscape art|landscape]]. History painting was also known as the "grande genre". Paintings of [[Hans Makart]] are often larger than life historical dramas, and he combined this with a [[historicism (art)|historicism]] in decoration to dominate the style of 19th century [[Vienna]] culture. [[Paul Delaroche]] is a typifying example of French history painting.

All of these trends were influenced by the theories of the philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], who held that history was a dialectic of competing ideas, which eventually resolved in synthesis.

Towards the end of the 19th century, academic art had saturated European society. Exhibitions were held often, and the most popular exhibition was the [[Paris Salon]] and beginning in 1903, the [[Salon d'Automne]]. These [[Salon (gathering)#Public salons|salons]] were sensational events that attracted crowds of visitors, both native and foreign. As much a social affair as an artistic one, 50,000 people might visit on a single Sunday, and as many as 500,000 could see the exhibition during its two-month run. Thousands of pictures were displayed, hung from just below eye level all the way up to the ceiling in a manner now known as "Salon style". A successful showing at the salon was a seal of approval for an artist, making his work saleable to the growing ranks of private collectors. [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau|Bouguereau]], [[Alexandre Cabanel]] and [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] were leading figures of this art world.

During the reign of academic art, the paintings of the [[Rococo]] era, previously held in low favor, were revived to popularity, and themes often used in Rococo art such as [[Eros (god)|Eros]] and [[Psyche (mortal)|Psyche]] were popular again. The academic art world also idolized [[Raffaello Santi|Raphael]], for the [[idealism (art)|ideality]] of his work, in fact preferring him over [[Michelangelo]].

Academic [[Art in Poland]] flourished under [[Jan Matejko]], who established the [[Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts|Kraków Academy of Fine Arts]]. Many of these works can be seen in the
[[Sukiennice Museum|Gallery of 19th-Century Polish Art at Sukiennice]] in [[Kraków]].

Academic art not only held influence in Europe and the United States, but also extended its influence to other Western countries. This was especially true for [[Latin America]]n nations, which, because their revolutions were modeled on the [[French Revolution]], sought to emulate French culture. An example of a Latin American academic artist is [[Ángel Zárraga]] of [[Mexico]].

== Academic training ==
[[File:École des beaux-arts (from the live).jpg|thumb|315px|''Students painting "from life" at the École''. Photographed late 1800s.]]

Young artists spent four years in rigorous training. In France, only students who passed an exam and carried a letter of reference from a noted professor of art were accepted at the academy's school, the [[École des Beaux-Arts]]. Drawings and paintings of the nude, called "académies", were the basic building blocks of academic art and the procedure for learning to make them was clearly defined. First, students copied prints after classical sculptures, becoming familiar with the principles of contour, light, and shade. The copy was believed crucial to the academic education; from copying works of past artists one would assimilate their methods of art making. To advance to the next step, and every successive one, students presented drawings for evaluation.
[[File:Sykes-demos.JPG|thumb|left|150px|''Demosthenes at the Seashore'', a Royal Academy prize winning drawing, 1888.]]
If approved, they would then draw from plaster casts of famous classical sculptures. Only after acquiring these skills were artists permitted entrance to classes in which a live model posed. Painting was not taught at the École des Beaux-Arts until after 1863. To learn to paint with a brush, the student first had to demonstrate proficiency in drawing, which was considered the foundation of academic painting. Only then could the pupil join the studio of an academician and learn how to paint. Throughout the entire process, competitions with a predetermined subject and a specific allotted period of time measured each students' progress.

The most famous art competition for students was the [[Prix de Rome]]. The winner of the Prix de Rome was awarded a fellowship to study at the Académie française's [[French Academy in Rome|school at the Villa Medici]] in [[Rome]] for up to five years. To compete, an artist had to be of French nationality, male, under 30 years of age, and single. He had to have met the entrance requirements of the École and have the support of a well-known art teacher. The competition was grueling, involving several stages before the final one, in which 10 competitors were sequestered in studios for 72 days to paint their final history paintings. The winner was essentially assured a successful professional career.

As noted, a successful showing at the Salon was a seal of approval for an artist. Artists petitioned the hanging committee for optimal placement "on the line," or at eye level. After the exhibition opened, artists complained if their works were "skyed," or hung too high. The ultimate achievement for the professional artist was election to membership in the Académie française and the right to be known as an academician.

== Criticism and legacy ==
[[File:This Year Venuses Again (Daumier).jpg|thumb|241px|[[Caricature]] (French [[bourgeoisie]]): ''This Year Venuses Again… Always Venuses!''. [[Honoré Daumier]], No. 2 from series in ''Le Charivati'', 1864.]]

Academic art was first criticized for its use of [[idealism (art)|idealism]], by [[realism (arts)|Realist]] artists such as [[Gustave Courbet]], as being based on idealistic clichés and representing mythical and legendary motives while contemporary social concerns were being ignored. Another criticism by Realists was the "[[Licked finish|false surface]]" of paintings—the objects depicted looked smooth, slick, and idealized—showing no real texture. The Realist [[Théodule Ribot]] worked against this by experimenting with rough, unfinished textures in his painting.

Stylistically, the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], who advocated quickly [[plein air|painting outdoors]] exactly what the eye sees and the hand puts down, criticized the finished and idealized painting style. Although academic painters began a painting by first making drawings and then painting [[oil paint|oil sketches]] of their subject, the high polish they gave to their drawings seemed to the Impressionists tantamount to a lie. After the oil sketch, the artist would produce the final painting with the academic "fini," changing the painting to meet stylistic standards and attempting to idealize the images and add perfect detail. Similarly, [[perspective (visual)|perspective]] is constructed geometrically on a flat surface and is not really the product of sight, Impressionists disavowed the devotion to mechanical techniques.

Realists and Impressionists also defied the placement of still-life and landscape at the bottom of the hierarchy of genres. It is important to note that most Realists and Impressionists and others among the early avant-garde who rebelled against academism were originally students in academic [[wikt:atelier|ateliers]]. [[Claude Monet]], [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Édouard Manet]], and even [[Henri Matisse]] were students under academic artists.

As [[modern art]] and its avant-garde gained more power, academic art was further denigrated, and seen as sentimental, clichéd, conservative, non-innovative, [[bourgeois]], and "styleless". The French referred derisively to the style of academic art as ''[[L'art Pompier]]'' (''pompier'' means "fireman") alluding to the paintings of [[Jacques-Louis David]] (who was held in esteem by the academy) which often depicted soldiers wearing fireman-like helmets. The paintings were called "grandes machines" which were said to have manufactured false emotion through contrivances and tricks.

This denigration of academic art reached its peak through the writings of art critic [[Clement Greenberg]] who stated that all academic art is "[[kitsch]]". Other artists, such as the [[Symbolist painters]] and some of the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]], were kinder to the tradition{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}. As painters who sought to bring imaginary vistas to life, these artists were more willing to learn from a strongly representational tradition. Once the tradition had come to be looked on as old-fashioned, the [[allegory|allegorical]] nudes and theatrically posed figures struck some viewers as bizarre and dreamlike.

With the goals of [[Postmodernism]] in giving a fuller, more sociological and pluralistic account of history, academic art has been brought back into history books and discussion. Nevertheless, since the early 1990s, academic art has experienced a limited resurgence through the [[Classical Realism|Classical Realist]] [[Atelier Method|atelier]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Panero, James: "The New Old School", ''The New Criterion'', Volume 25, September 2006, page 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the art is gaining a broader appreciation by the public at large, and whereas academic paintings once would only fetch a few hundreds of dollars in auctions, some now fetch millions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2662">'''Akka bakka bonka rakka''' is a [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] [[nursery rhyme]] of mostly nonsense words used to select or point out a participant in children's games, such as who will be "it" in a game like [[hide-and-seek]] ({{lang-no|gjemsel}}) or [[Tag (game)|tag]] ({{lang-no|sisten}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berulfsen |first1=Bjarne |title=Ordet går videre: Nye kåserier om ordenes liv |date=1969 |publisher=Gyldendal |location=Oslo |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Svensen |first1=Åsfrid |title=Tekstens mønstre: innføring i litterær analyse |date=1985 |publisher=Universitetsforlaget |location=Oslo |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Anjou Legendarium''' is a [[Gothic art|Gothic]] [[illuminated manuscript]] of a collection of stories from the life of saints important to the [[Capetian House of Anjou|House of Anjou]] of [[Hungary]]. It was made on the occasion of the journey of [[Charles I of Hungary]] and his son [[Andrew, Duke of Calabria|Prince Andrew]] to [[Naples]] in [[Italy]] in 1330.&lt;ref name="legend" /&gt;

The [[Legendary material in Christian hagiography|legendarium]] was a picture book intended for children with a brief text accompanying pictures. The painters of the work came from [[Bologna]] and painted in the style of the [[trecento]].&lt;ref name="legend" /&gt;

[[File:Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein - Goethe in the Roman Campagna - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein]], ''[[Goethe in the Roman Campagna]]'', 1787, portrait of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], German artist known for his works of poetry, drama, prose, philosophy, visual arts, and science.]]
An '''artist''' is a person engaged in an activity related to creating art, practicing the [[arts]], or demonstrating an art. The common usage in both everyday [[speech]] and academic [[discourse]] is a practitioner in the [[visual art]]s only. The term is often used in the entertainment business, especially in a [[business]] context, for [[musician|musicians]] and other performers (less often for actors). "Artiste" (the French for artist) is a variant used in English only in this context. Use of the term to describe writers, for example, is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like criticism.

==Dictionary definitions==
Wiktionary defines the noun 'artist' (Singular: artist; Plural: artists) as follows:
# A person who creates art.
# A person who makes and creates art as an [[wikt:occupation|occupation]].
# A person who is skilled at some activity.
# A person whose trade or profession requires a knowledge of design, drawing, painting, etc.
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines the older broad meanings of the term "artist":

* A learned person or Master of Arts
* One who pursues a practical science, traditionally medicine, [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], [[chemistry]]
* A follower of a pursuit in which skill comes by study or practice
* A follower of a manual art, such as a mechanic
* One who makes their [[craft]] a fine art
* One who cultivates one of the [[fine arts]] – traditionally the arts presided over by the [[muses]]

==History of the term==
The Greek word "techně", often translated as "art," implies mastery of any sort of craft. The adjectival Latin form of the word, "technicus",&lt;ref&gt;
[[Oxford English Dictionary]] s.v. ''technic''
&lt;/ref&gt;
became the source of the English words [[wikt:technique|technique]], technology, [[wikt:technical|technical]].

In Greek culture each of the nine [[Muse]]s oversaw a different field of human creation:
* [[Calliope]] (the 'beautiful of speech'): chief of the muses and muse of [[epic poetry|epic or heroic poetry]]
* [[Clio]] (the 'glorious one'): muse of history
* [[Erato]] (the 'amorous one'): muse of [[love poetry|love or erotic poetry]], lyrics, and marriage songs
* [[Euterpe]] (the 'well-pleasing'): muse of music and [[lyric poetry]]
* [[Melpomene]] (the 'chanting one'): muse of [[tragedy]]
* [[Polyhymnia]] or Polymnia (the '[singer] of many [[hymn]]s'): muse of [[sacred|sacred song]], [[Public speaking|oratory]], [[Lyrics|lyric]], singing, and [[rhetoric]]
* [[Terpsichore]] (the '[one who] delights in dance'): muse of [[choral]] song and dance
* [[Thalia (Muse)|Thalia]] (the 'blossoming one'): muse of comedy and [[bucolic poetry]]
* [[Urania]] (the 'celestial one'): muse of [[astronomy]]

No muse was identified with the visual arts of painting and sculpture. In ancient Greece sculptors and painters were held in low regard, somewhere between freemen and slaves, their work regarded as mere manual labour.&lt;ref&gt;
''In Our Time: The Artist'' [[BBC Radio 4]], TX 28 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''art'' derives from the Latin "ars" (stem ''art-''), which, although literally defined, means "skill method" or "technique", and conveys a connotation of beauty.

During the Middle Ages the word ''artist'' already existed in some countries such as Italy, but the meaning was something resembling ''craftsman'', while the word ''artesan'' was still unknown. An artist was someone able to do a work better than others, so the skilled excellency was underlined, rather than the activity field. In this period some "artisanal" products (such as textiles) were much more precious and expensive than paintings or sculptures.

The first division into major and minor arts dates back at least to the works of [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404–1472): ''[[De re aedificatoria]], De statua, De pictura'', which focused on the importance of the intellectual skills of the artist rather than the manual skills (even if in other forms of art there was a [[project]] behind).&lt;ref&gt;
P.Galloni, ''Il sacro artefice. Mitologie degli artigiani medievali'', Laterza, [[Bari]], 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Academy|Academies]] in Europe (second half of 16th century) the gap between fine and applied arts was definitely set.

Many contemporary definitions of "artist" and "art" are highly contingent on culture, resisting aesthetic prescription, in much the same way that the features constituting beauty and the beautiful cannot be standardized easily without corruption into [[kitsch]].

==The present day concept of an 'artist'==
''Artist'' is a descriptive term applied to a person who engages in an activity deemed to be an art. An artist also may be defined unofficially as "a person who expresses him- or herself through a medium". The word is also used in a qualitative sense of, a person [[creativity|creative]] in, [[innovation|innovative]] in, or adept at, an artistic practice.

Most often, the term describes those who create within a context of the fine arts or '[[high culture]]', activities such as drawing, painting, [[sculpture]], acting, dancing, writing, filmmaking, [[New media art|new media]], photography, and music—people who use imagination, talent, or skill to create works that may be judged to have an [[aesthetic]] value. [[Art history|Art historians]] and [[Art critic|critics]] define artists as those who produce art within a recognized or recognizable discipline. Contrasting terms for highly skilled workers in media in the [[applied arts]] or [[decorative arts]] include [[artisan]], [[Master craftsman|craftsman]], and specialized terms such as [[pottery|potter]], [[goldsmith]] or [[glassblower]]. Fine arts artists such as painters succeeded in the [[Renaissance]] in raising their status, formerly similar to these workers, to a decisively higher level.

The term may also be used loosely or metaphorically to denote highly skilled people in any non-"art" activities, as well— law, medicine, mechanics, or mathematics, for example.

Often, discussions on the subject focus on the differences among "artist" and "[[technician]]", "entertainer" and "[[artisan]]", "[[fine arts|fine art]]" and "[[applied art]]", or what constitutes art and what does not. The French word ''artiste'' (which in French, simply means "artist") has been imported into the English language where it means a performer (frequently in [[Music Hall]] or [[Vaudeville]]). Use of the word "artiste" can also be a [[pejorative]] term.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth G. Wilson. [https://books.google.com/books?id=L2ChiO2yEZ0C&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=artist++uncomplimentary+%22artiste%22&amp;source=web&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ct=result The Columbia guide to standard American English].&lt;/ref&gt;

The English word 'artiste' has thus a narrower range of meaning than the word 'artiste' in French.

In ''Living with Art'', Mark Getlein proposes six activities, services or functions of contemporary artists:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Getlein |first=Mark |date=2012 |title=Living with Art |location= |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education |isbn=978-0-07-337925-8 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Create places for some human purpose.
#Create extraordinary versions of ordinary objects.
#Record and commemorate.
#Give tangible form to the unknown.
#Give tangible form to feelings.
#Refresh our vision and help see the world in new ways.

After looking at years of data on arts school graduates as well as policies &amp; program outcomes regarding artists, arts, &amp; culture, Elizabeth Lingo and Steven Tepper propose the divide between "arts for art's sake" artists and commercially successful artists is not as wide as may be perceived, and that "this bifurcation between the commercial and the noncommercial, the excellent and the base, the elite and the popular, is increasingly breaking down" (Eikhof &amp; Haunschild, 2007). Lingo and Tepper point out:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Third System of the Arts? An Exploration of Some Ideas from Larry Shiner's The Invention of Art: A Cultural History |url=http://www.contempaesthetics.org/newvolume/pages/article.php?articleID=519 |website=www.contempaesthetics.org |accessdate=2015-07-23 |date=21 December 2008 |publisher= |authorlink= |first=David |last=Clowney}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#arts ''consumers'' don't restrict themselves to either "high" or "common" arts; instead, they demonstrate "omnivorous tastes, liking both reggae and Rachmaninoff" (Peterson &amp; Kern, 1996; Walker &amp; Scott-Melnyk, 2002)
#data indicates "artists are willing to move across sectors and no longer see working outside the commercial sector as a badge of distinction or authenticity" (Bridgstock, 2013; Ellmeier, 2003)
#academic, policy, and government leaders are adapting—widening—programs &amp; opportunities in recognition of "the role of artists as drivers of economic growth and innovation" (Bohm &amp; Land, 2009; DCMS, 2006, 2008; Florida, 2012; Hesmondhalgh &amp; Baker, 2010; Lloyd, 2010; Iyengar, 2013).
#arts graduates name "business and management skills" as the "number one area [they] wish they had been more exposed to in college" (Strategic National Arts Alumni Project [SNAAP], 2011; Tepper &amp; Kuh, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=concept of artist |url=http://www.goines.net/Writing/what_is_artist.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Training and employment ==
The [[US Bureau of Labor Statistics]] classifies many visual artists as either ''craft artists'' or ''fine artists''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/craft-and-fine-artists.htm|title=Craft and Fine Artists|last=|first=|date=17 December 2015|website=|series=Occupational Outlook Handbook|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-21|edition=2016–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A craft artist makes handmade functional works of art, such as pottery or clothing.  A fine artist makes paintings, illustrations (such as [[book illustration]]s or [[medical illustration]]s), sculptures, or similar artistic works primarily for their aesthetic value.

The main source of skill for both craft artists and fine artists is long-term repetition and practice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Many fine artists have studied their art form at university and some have a master's degree in fine arts.  Artists may also study on their own or receive on-the-job training from an experienced artist.

The number of available jobs as an artist is increasing more slowly than other fields.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  About half of US artists are self-employed.  Others work in a variety of industries.  For example, a pottery manufacturer will employ craft artists, and book publishers will hire illustrators.

In the US, fine artists have a median income of approximately US $50,000 per year, and craft artists have a median income of approximately US $33,000 per year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This compares to US $61,000 for all art-related fields, including related jobs such as [[graphic designer]]s, [[multimedia artist]]s, [[animator]]s, and [[fashion designers]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Many artists work part-time as artists and hold a second job.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Examples of art and artists ==

Please resist the temptation to add your favorite artist or artform to this list. It is intended to illustrate the breadth of the concept, not to list every possible artform and movement. It should contain only the most significant directions and mention one artist who may be considered iconic in this domain. For all practical purposes it appears to be complete.

An '''Artists Open House''' is a special example of an [[Open Studio]] whereby the studio is a residential venue, usually a house or a garden. The format of an Open House is very similar to an Open Studio, but the significantly lower cost of exhibiting in a residential venue than a studio or gallery provides more artists an opportunity to exhibit their work.

== History ==
Artists Open Houses are perhaps best known in [[Brighton and Hove]] in the [[UK]] as taking place alongside the [[Brighton Festival]] and [[Brighton Festival Fringe]]. 

In 1982 Ned Hoskins filled his home with his and other artists work in protest at the lack of visual arts in the Brighton Festival. 
Hoskins had started a new phenomenon. This became the Fiveways Artists Group, named after the area of the city known as [[Fiveways, Brighton|Fiveways]]. They were soon followed by other groupings of Artists' Open Houses in other areas around Brighton and Hove, including Beyond The Level, founded 1996 (from city area [[The Level]]) and Kemptown Artists (from city area [[Kemptown, Brighton|Kemptown]]). In 2008 there were around 1000 artists exhibiting work in over 200 houses, divided into 13 trails, together with many independent open houses. 

In 2002 the Artists Open Houses Festival broke away from the official and fringe Brighton Festivals to become an independent organisation, often simplified to just ''AOH'', producing its own brochure and website.

== Currently ==
In Brighton, the Artists Open Houses Festival still runs concurrently with the Brighton Festival and Brighton Festival Fringe. These three organisations, along with many other projects that happen during the three weeks of the festival, work together to create a diverse range of art available for display around the city. 

A similar organisation in [[Cheltenham]] also runs for a week at the beginning of June. Originally called Cheltenham Artists Open Houses, but now known as Cheltenham Art Festival &amp; Open Studios. 

The [[Helfa gelf]]/Art Trail that covers much of North Wales includes many Artists Open Houses amongst its participating studios.

Also unlinked Artists Open House events happen in other areas of the UK. [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Birmingham]], [[Bristol]], [[Leicester]], [[Manchester]], [[Oxford]], [[Peterborough]], [[Stroud]], [[Somerset]] and [[Worthing]] all have ones of their own.

The '''Arts District''' is a neighborhood on the eastern edge of [[Downtown Los Angeles]], California, United States. The gritty area has given new life to old industrial buildings whose history often dates to the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="LAT 3-7/2015"/&gt; While much of the early creative art was done behind closed doors, the street scene has slowly been activated in the early years of the 21st century as more and more factories are creatively reused with some new construction interspersed.&lt;ref name="LAT 20130120"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/20/business/la-fi-commre-arts-district-20130120|title=Gaining Traction: Trendy shops, eateries and offices transform downtown L.A.'s arts district|date= January 20, 2013|first=Roger |last=Vincent|access-date=29 July 2017|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Art galleries]] have opened and given recognition to the area amidst the entire downtown where [[Art museums]] and additional galleries can be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ladowntownnews.com/news/the-downtowners-of-distinction/article_1b311095-358e-5d39-ab5b-351f6dcb9c1a.html|title=The Downtowners of Distinction|first=Jon |last=Regardie|date= February 18, 2011|work=[[Los Angeles Downtown News]]|access-date=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city community planning boundaries are [[Alameda Street]] on the west which blends into [[Little Tokyo, Los Angeles|Little Tokyo]], [[First Street (Los Angeles)|First Street]] on the north, the [[Los Angeles River]] to the east, and Violet Street on the south.

==Early history==
Spanish Father Juan Crespi founded what is now known as the Arts District in 1796 during an expedition going to Alta California. During his journey he discovered a body of water that was surrounded by rich soil, this then inspired a passage into his observation journal that states: "Should a town be needed in this location, this site shall be called Our Lady Queen of the Angels." The small pueblo was declared a new territory for the Spanish and was officially founded on September 4, 1781.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artsdistrictla.org/arts-district-history/|title=Founding a city|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vignes Street winds through the northeastern edge of the Arts District, parallel to and a couple of blocks west of the broad cement trench that memorializes the L.A. River. It is named for [[Jean-Louis Vignes]], an aging adventurer and vintner who arrived in Los Angeles in 1831 by way of the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii) and Bordeaux. He planted grapes on 104 acres where Cabernet and Sauvignon Blanc vines imported from the south of France thrived, and by 1849 El Aliso - what the Vignes vineyard was entitled, called so after the sacred local sycamore tree of the same name&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lapl.org/collections-resources/blogs/lapl/forgotten-los-angeles-history-el-aliso-big-tree-los-angeles |title=Forgotten Los Angeles History: El Aliso, the Big Tree of Los Angeles &amp;#124; Los Angeles Public Library |publisher=Lapl.org |date=2018-04-27 |access-date=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; - was the largest producer of wine in California. The grapes are gone, but the San Antonio Winery just north of the community is a reminder of the area’s past.

By the late 19th century, oranges and grapefruit had replaced grapes as the principal agricultural products of the area and the property west of the riverbank was thick with citrus groves. The groves provided a location for filmmaker DW Griffith who filmed parts of Hollywood’s first feature film (''In Old California'') there in 1909. A single grapefruit tree remains, towering over the Japanese American Plaza off San Pedro Street and Azusa. Somewhere near Third Street and Alameda, a print shop became the area’s first commercial arts enterprise, employing artists from around the region designing labels for the boxes of citrus fruit shipped across the country.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The growing [[Santa Fe Freight Depot]] and warehouses created to serve the citrus industry’s shipping needs determined the area’s economic character for most of the next century and were responsible for the architectural flavor of the Arts District structures that have survived earthquakes, flood and fire. The single room hotels for rail workers to the northwest and the growth of Little Tokyo to the west and [[Chinatown, Los Angeles|Chinatown]] to the north created a mix that was working class and cosmopolitan.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

By World War II, the citrus groves had been replaced by factories and the rail freight business was giving way to the trucking industry. The area had taken on an industrial character that was growing seedy around the edges.&lt;ref name="LAT 20130120"/&gt; Over the next twenty years, many of the independent small manufacturers had either been absorbed by larger competitors, grown too big for their quarters – or simply failed—and an increasing number of vacant warehouse and former factory spaces contributed to a dingy, decaying urban environment typical of many aging big American cities of the era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/may/17/local/la-me-ln-downtown-security-pullout-20130517|title=Private security patrols pull out of downtown Arts District|date= May 17, 2013|access-date=28 July 2017|first=Gale |last=Holland|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950's many manufacturing companies fled oversees or were overtaken by larger manufacturing companies, resulting in vacant buildings and bringing property values down. Artists who were struggling to pay rent in the city started moving to the Arts District in the late 1960's and early 1970's. Before 1979 the Arts District buildings had been zoned for industrial use only. It wasn't until 1979 that the State of California passed a live/work legislation {{citation needed|date=November 2018}} and in 1981 Los Angeles passed the bill Artist-In-Residence (AIR) . This new bill AIR would allow artists to live legally in the areas that could no longer be used for industrial use as long as they attained a business license. To make the living standards more comfortable the building code was lifted.New regulations had been created and the AIR legislation required the lofts to have a room to sleep, fire alarm, and other requirements for them to live legally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Lindsey|date=2014|title="Isolation and authenticity in Los Angeles' arts district neighborhood"|url=|journal=Dissertations &amp; Theses Global: The Humanities and Social Sciences Collection|volume=|page=157|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art scene==
In 1969, [[Allen Ruppersberg]] presented ''Al's Cafe'' at 1913 West Sixth Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.christinewongyap.com/tag/als-cafe/|title=Al’s Cafe - R+D|website=blog.christinewongyap.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In the mid-'70s, a handful of artists, including Joel Bass, Dan Citron, Woods Davy, Marc Kreisel, [[Jon Peterson (artist)|Jon Peterson]], Stephen Seemayer, Maura Sheehan, [[Coleen Sterritt]], Sydney Littenberg, Peter Zecher, and others saw opportunity in the empty buildings and began colonizing the area, converting former industrial and commercial spaces into working studios, sometimes renting space for as little as a three cents a square foot and carving out living quarters. This resulted in a surge of artistic activity, culminating in the highly controversial "Downtown L.A. in Santa Barbara" exhibition, organized by Betty Klausner for the Santa Barbara Contemporary Arts Forum, which is now known as the Museum of Contemporary Art Santa Barbara. By the mid 1980s, the following artists were also living downtown: Linda Frye Burman, James Croak, [[Merion Estes]], Joe Fay, [[George Herms]], Mary Jones, Constance Mallinson, [[Paul McCarthy]], Margaret Nielson, Richard Newton, Margit Omar, [[Lari Pittman]], John Schroeder, Judy Simonian, [[Andy Wilf]], and Takako Yamaguchi.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Stephen Seemayer's film ''The Young Turks''(2012) documents the 1979–1981 years.

In 1979, Marc Kreisel opened [[Al's Bar (American Hotel)|Al's Bar]] opened in the American Hotel on Hewitt just off Traction. This legendary punk rock venue was the training ground for [[Sonic Youth]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Beck]], [[The Fall (band)|the Fall]], [[the Residents]], introducing generations of Angelenos to dozens of emerging groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/aug/16/news/cl-34651 |title=Raise a Glass for Al's Bar--It's Last Call |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |first=Laurie |last=Pike |date=August 16, 2001 |access-date=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popular sound band "Party Boys" played the bars and art events.Also known as the downtown artists' central meeting place, Al's Bar occasionally hosted art exhibitions. Al's Bar, the west coast's oldest punk club,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} finally closed in 2001, and the American Hotel received a facelift in 2012 and was renamed the American Apartments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ladowntownnews.com/news/upgrades-for-arts-district-projects/article_6d01e57a-6fb6-11e1-888b-001871e3ce6c.html|title=Upgrades for Arts District Projects|first=Richard|last=Guzmán|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LA Artcore, founded in 1976 by Lydia Takeshita with the purpose of exhibiting local artists, exists today in locations at [[the Brewery Art Colony]] and in [[Little Tokyo, Los Angeles|Little Tokyo]]. The Atomic Cafe on 1st Street at Alameda was an artists and musicians haunt in the late 1970s and early 1980s. [[Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions]] (LACE) created exhibitions at its gallery space, located in the late 70s on Broadway St before moving to Industrial Street in the 1980s. Several commercial art galleries, including Oranges and Sardines, Kirk DeGoyer Gallery, the Downtown Gallery, Vanguard Gallery, Exile, and Galleria by the Water opened in the late seventies, only to close in the early eighties. Cirrus Editions, the first gallery to open downtown, remains open.

Around 1980, [[Jon Peterson (artist)|Jon Peterson]] and Stephen Seemayer opened “DTLA," a club that had exactly one show before it closed, adjacent the Atomic Cafe. [[High Performance Magazine]] used DTLA as its performance space until its one-year lease was up. During that year, [[Paul McCarthy]] performed ''Monkey Man'' during the Public Spirit Performance Festival, Part 1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://charlesrivacollection.com/images/artistsProfile/resume/PaulMcCarthy-2.pdf ]{{dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name DTLA was later adopted by the neighboring coffee house where [[Beck]] got his start.

In 1981, the City of Los Angeles passed its "Artist in Residence" or "AIR" ordinance, which allowed residential use of formerly industrial and commercially zoned buildings; artists had long used such spaces as living quarters illegally, and the AIR law sought to bring this practice into legality and regulation.&lt;ref name=Gerber&gt;Gerber, Marisa (July 29, 2014) [http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-arts-district-20140730-story.html "Arts District's changing landscape is worrisome to longtime residents"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' Retrieved 15 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Art galleries, cafes and performance venues opened as the live/work population grew. 
During the '80s, Bedlam, created by artist Jim Fittipaldi,  on 6th Street (and later, briefly, in the former premises of Al’s bar) was a salon with drawing workshops, art installations, theater, live music and a speakeasy. Dangerous Curve, on a dangerous curve of 4th Place between Mateo and Molino, put on exhibitions of artists whose work was often difficult to categorize. The Spanish Kitchen, a warehouse space on Third near Traction, was home to series of happenings, events, raves, installations and blowout parties. It now houses the 3rd Steakhouse and Lounge, an eatery that hosts community events and exhibitions of works by local artists. Cocola (later known as the 410 Boyd St. Bar and Grill), the legendary artists’ bar just west of the Arts District, lives on as Escondite.

In 1985, Fritz Frauchiger curated "Off the Street," a "one-time art exhibition" sponsored by the Cultural Affairs Department in the Old City Print Shop, which featured paintings, sculptures, photographs and installations by 48 Los Angeles artists, most of whom lived downtown.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Frauchiger. ''Off the Street''. City of Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department. 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the nonprofit group Downtown Arts Development Association (DADA) was formed as a spinoff of LARABA by several artist members of the LARABA board of directors in order to provide a platform for the burgeoning downtown art scene; DADA hosted exhibits of more than 400 downtown artists in 1994–1998. [[File:DADA 1994 Artists.jpg|thumb|DADA 1994 Artists]]After 1994, the heart of the Arts District was Bloom’s General Store, presided over by Joel Bloom, a veteran of Chicago’s Second City, who became an advocate for the community and who is remembered as The Arts District’s once and only unofficial mayor. Bloom died in 2007, but his memory is honored with a plaque from the city declaring the triangle around Third, Traction and Rose to be Joel Bloom Square.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Valerie J. (July 14, 2007) [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jul/14/local/me-bloom14 "Joel Bloom, 59; activist helped shape the arts district in L.A."] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cornerstone Theater Company|Cornerstone Theater]], an enterprise that brings community theater to locations all around the country, resided on Traction Avenue for 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.americantheatre.org/2018/06/12/cornerstone-theater-company-to-leave-los-angeles-home/|title=Cornerstone Theater Company to Leave Los Angeles Home|date=June 12, 2018|work=American Theatre|publisher=[[Theatre Communications Group]]|access-date=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the corner, on Hewitt at 4th Pl., the non-profit ArtShare offers lessons in art, dance, theater and music to urban youth and features a small theater once used by Padua Playwrights. Padua stages plays around the city, often in non-traditional environments, and hosts play-writing workshops.&lt;ref name=laraba&gt;{{official website|http://www.laraba.org|Los Angeles River Artists’ &amp; Business Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transportation ==
&lt;p&gt;The Arts District is strategically located near the center of Downtown LA making it easier accessible for alternate forms of transportation. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) Gold Line station is located along Alameda St. The cross section streets are along East First St. and East Temple St. The small neighborhood is also serviced by the Los Angeles Department of Transportations (LADOT) DASH bus making several stops on Hewitt St. Additionally, Metro offers a bike share program in many neighborhoods around the Arts District area. The following five stations currently available to pick up or leave a bike are listed below. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artsdistrictla.org/getting-around/|title=Getting Around|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;740 E 3rd St.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;999 E 3rd St.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1245 Factory Place&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1301 Willow St.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;720 E Temple St.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;There are a total of sixteen parking lots scattered around the Arts District. As the area became a social hub for Angelinos, parking became an issue to the local resident. Public and private lots/ structures including on street parking offer a variety of parking options for visitors. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1EJFA_enUS736US736&amp;tbm=lcl&amp;ei=8VvqWveZOcT2zgKQ6LOwCw&amp;q=arts+district+parking+lots&amp;oq=arts+district+parking+lots&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..33i22i29i30k1.1898.1898.0.2297.1.1.0.0.0.0.145.145.0j1.1.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.1.140....0.Lb8Ex5FJAs0#rlfi=hd:;si:;mv:!1m3!1d7266.413948412242!2d-118.24054819999999!3d34.042684599999994!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i440!2i422!4f13.1;tbs:lrf:!2m1!1e3!3sIAE,lf:1,lf_ui:3|title=Arts District Parking Lots|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gentrification==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}

The real estate history of the Arts District in Los Angeles doesn't fit the usual definition of "gentrification." In the 1970s there were millions of square feet of empty commercial and industrial space in downtown LA. Around 1970, artists began to colonize these spaces illegally and use them for live in studios. In 1980, in order to legalize these ad-hoc and unsafe residences, the City of Los Angeles created the "Artist in Residence" zoning variation ordinance. The ordinance necessarily included mandated upgrades to the artists spaces, many of which had fire/safety/health issues endangering the (artist) occupants. It also enabled developers who wished to rehab or create new or old studios that were now legal. These developments, with their increased building and safety requirements, raised the retail rental rates from 10–30 cents per square foot to about 65 cents per square foot in the early to mid-1980s.

In the late 1980s and through the 1990s several (about 20) large artist loft projects were developed from empty industrial buildings, including The Brewery, 900 East 1st St, Citizens Warehouse, 2101 E. 7th St., and Long Beach Ave Lofts, with rents ranging from 65 to 75 cents/ sq ft.

After 2000, developers started converting large office buildings in the area west of the arts district under a new "Live/Work" ordinance. These apartments were marketed as lofts, although they bore little resemblance to the much larger lofts in the industrial district east of Alameda St. Rents in these live/work spaces started in the early 2000s at about $1.10 / sq ft, and over the next 15 years climbed to about $2.50/sq ft, due mainly to the high demand for the apartments and the increasing purchase price for the undeveloped buildings.

The rapid "loft" development west of Alameda, in which hundreds of thousands of sq ft of heretofore unused commercial space has been converted to live/work apartments, has led to a renaissance in downtown Los Angeles, an area long considered uninhabitable by middle class Angelenos. The increased popularity for downtown residences has continued to put upward pressure on loft rent in the Arts District, pushing rents in some of the older, more authentic artists loft buildings upwards towards $1.50- $2.00/ sq ft., pushing many longtime artist/tenants out of their lofts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Carolina A. |last=Miranda |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/miranda/la-et-cam-last-stand-artists-arts-district-20171027-htmlstory.html |title=Rent hikes and evictions — is it the last stand for artists in the Arts District? |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]  |date=October 27, 2017 |access-date=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==
The city community planning boundaries today are [[Alameda Street]] on the west, [[First Street (Los Angeles)|First Street]] on the north, the Los Angeles River to the east, and Violet Street on the south.&lt;ref name=Saillant/&gt; Challenges facing the Arts District today include the loss of affordable live/work lofts, loss of artists, and loss of historically significant buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Khouri, Andrew (June 12, 2014) [http://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/la-fi-downtown-condos-20140612-story.html "Downtown condo shortage shuts out buyers"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Community leaders are struggling to create balance amidst the economic issues brought about by gentrification and the need to preserve the character of the Arts District as a creative community that has made contributions to the cultural and economic well-being of Los Angeles for decades.&lt;ref&gt;Khouri, Andrew (September 25, 2014) [http://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/la-fi-0925-property-report-arts-district-20140925-story.html "Upscale new residential complex opens in L.A. arts district"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the average annual income for neighborhood residents was $120,000.&lt;ref name=Vincent&gt;Vincent, Roger (November 13, 2014) [http://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/la-fi-property-report-coke-20141113-story.html "Old Coca-Cola building in L.A. to be refreshed as plush office complex"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' Retrieved 15 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt; While the initial decades saw the conversion to residential and commercial uses of low-slung warehouses and industrial spaces, downtown zoning laws could be rewritten to permit the heights of buildings to double, allowing up to 1,500 new residential units to be built in 8-story, {{convert|100|ft|m|spell=in}} edifices.&lt;ref name=Saillant&gt;Saillant, Catherine (December 1, 2014) [http://www.latimes.com/local/cityhall/la-me-arts-district-20141202-story.html "Some fear Arts District development plan would ruin the neighborhood"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Southern California Institute of Architecture]] (SCI-Arc), resides in a quarter-mile-long ({{convert|0.25|mi|km|disp=out}}) former [[Santa Fe Freight Depot]] built in 1907 that has been placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Across the street is a 438-unit apartment complex, "One Santa Fe," that opened in 2014 and was designed by [[Michael Maltzan]] Architecture (MMA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hawthorne|first1=Christopher|title=Maltzan's One Santa Fe apartment complex plays with notion of density|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-ca-one-santa-fe-review-20141012-column.html|agency=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=October 10, 2014 |access-date=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/arts-district-housing/|title=How Can L.A.

The century-old [[Coca-Cola]] manufacturing plant at 4th and Merrick streets, just around the corner from the enormous Santa Fe railroad dock that houses SCI-Arc, is the latest in adaptive reuse into creative spaces. The three-story brick-clad building was described as the ''"headquarters for the company's Pacific Coast business and for its export trade in the Hawaiian Islands and Old Mexico"'' when it was built in 1915.&lt;ref name="LAT 3-7/2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-dtla-tech-20150308-story.html#page=1|title=Tech scene takes hold in revitalized downtown L.A.|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 7, 2015|first= Andrea |last= Chang|access-date=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complex has been renamed Fourth &amp; Traction after Traction Avenue.&lt;ref name="Vincent"/&gt; The Hauser Wirth &amp; Schimmel complex opened in 2016 in buildings that date from the 1890s to the 1940s that occupy an entire city block on East 3rd Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/miranda/la-ca-cam-hauser-wirth-and-schimmel-20160207-column.html|title=Hauser Wirth &amp; Schimmel in downtown Los Angeles has big ideas| first=Carolina A. |last=Miranda|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date= February 5, 2016|access-date=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The district continues to be a popular location for filming due to the historic vibe. In 2016, the head of the neighborhood’s business improvement district commented that “There’s not one day where there’s not shooting.” The popular TV sitcom [[New Girl]] takes place largely in their apartment loft located in the Arts District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The New Girl Apartment Building|url=http://www.iamnotastalker.com/2012/04/17/the-new-girl-apartment-building/|work=iamnotastalker.com|access-date=January 31, 2017|date=April 17, 2012 | author= Lindsay }}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming has become complicated due to the development of the retail sector, coffee shops, and residents who will be disturbed by filming at night. Also many formerly empty lots and desolate streets are now under development where crews used the space to park trucks and trailers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-vintage-hollywood-20161219-story.html |title='La La Land' looks beautiful, but gentrification makes it harder for old Hollywood to play itself |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |first=David |last=Ng |date= December 25, 2016 |access-date=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 developer Suncal will proposed a 2 billion 1.95 million sq. ft mixed use project which includes two 58 story buildings designed by Hezorg and de Meuron. The project called 6 am will be located along 6th street between Mills and Alameda .The live/work space, will include 1,700 apartments and condos, shops, offices, hotels, charter school, and underground garage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/|title=Betting L.A. will like density and height|last=Hawthorne|first=Christopher|date=2016|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Condos average price will be 1,000 per sq. ft. New developments have displaced artists since they can no longer afford the price hike in the Arts District. In 2016 the median price for property was $714,500. It's a huge increase from 2013 when open lofts were priced at 370 per sq ft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/|title=Los Angeles’ Arts District lures developers - but loses artists|last=Brass|first=Kevin|date=2017|website=FT.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 11, 2017 the district received a 15 million award from the Active Transportation Program which will enhance the Arts District with new bike lanes, enhancement of sidewalks,and street lighting. The program will bring two signalized intersections, pedestrian lighting, four pedestrian crosswalks, and one mile of bike lanes. Little Tokyo and Arts District Regional Connector Station will have pedestrian and bicycle access with the new Sixth Street Bridge.

Some of the changes that will occur through the program are:

· Pedestrian Plaza at Merrick St. and 4th St.

· Controlled pedestrian crossing at 4th St./4th Place split.

· Bike lanes on Santa Fe Ave. and Mateo St. down to 7th St.

· Bike lanes on Traction Ave.

· Pedestrian walkway and plaza space on 6th St Bridge frontage road &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artsdistrictla.org|title=Arts District Awarded $15 Million in Multi-modal Transpo Funding|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Arts Party''' is an international political movement, inspired by the importance of the Arts and creative action, with parties currently registered in [[Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/parties_and_representatives/party_registration/Registered_parties/ | title=Current Register of Political Parties}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Kingdom|England, Scotland and Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.electoralcommission.org.uk/English/Registrations/PP6393 | title=UK Electoral Commission Registration Summary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Australian party was founded in October 2013 by two [[Sydney]]-based artists, [[PJ Collins]] and [[Nicholas Gledhill]],&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Mimo (7 November 2013). [http://www.altmedia.net.au/sydney-artists-form-new-political-party/86147 "Sydney artists form new political party"] – altmedia. Retrieved 19 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and registered by the [[Australian Electoral Commission]] (AEC) in August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fbiradio.com/introducing-the-australian-arts-party/ | title=FBI Radio: Introducing the Australian Arts Party}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artsparty.org/ | title=The Arts Party Official Site}}&lt;/ref&gt; Money was raised for the party's registration through a [[Crowdfunding|crowd-funding campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-australian-arts-party | title=Arts Party crowd-funding campaign}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Arts Party members stood as [[Independent politician|independent]] candidates at the [[Queensland state election, 2015|2015 Queensland state election]], as the party had not been registered in time to contest the election.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Stone (21 January 2015).

Retrieved 19 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the year, the party's leader, [[PJ Collins]], stood as an ungrouped [[New South Wales Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] candidate at the [[New South Wales state election, 2015|2015 New South Wales state election]].&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Stone (23 February 2015). [http://www.artshub.com.au/news-article/news/all-arts/deborah-stone/arts-party-leader-stands-for-nsw-parliament-247225 "Arts Party Leader stands for NSW Parliament"] – ArtsHub. Retrieved 19 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first official Arts Party candidate was Lou Pollard in the [[North Sydney by-election, 2015|2015 North Sydney by-election]],&lt;ref&gt;The Music Network [https://www.themusicnetwork.com/news/arts-party-to-contest-north-sydney-by-election "ARTS PARTY TO CONTEST NORTH SYDNEY BY-ELECTION"]&lt;/ref&gt; who came eighth in a field of 13 candidates.

The Arts Party fielded seven candidates for the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and thirteen [[Australian Senate|senate]] candidates across all states in the [[Australian federal election, 2016|2016 federal election]].&lt;ref name="2016candidates"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://results.aec.gov.au/20499/Website/HouseCandidates-20499.htm |title=Candidates for the 2016 federal election |date=11 June 2016 |access-date=11 June 2016 |publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once again, the entire campaign was financed through a [[Crowdfunding|crowd-funding campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pozible.com/project/204920 | title=Pozible - Arts Party Federal Campaign by PJ Collins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''arts district''' is a demarcated urban area, usually on the periphery of a [[city centre]], intended to create a 'critical mass' of places of cultural consumption - such as [[Art gallery|art galleries]], [[Nightclub|dance club]]s, [[Theater (structure)|theatre]]s, [[art cinema]]s, music venues, and public squares for performances. Such an area is usually encouraged by public policy-making and planning, but sometimes occurs spontaneously. It is associated with allied service-industry jobs like cafes, printers, fashion outlets, restaurants, and a variety of 'discreet services' (see the back-page small-ads of almost any cultural events-listings magazine).

There may also be some artists' studios located in nearby back-streets. But, as [[Richard Florida]] has found from his research, cultural production facilities are often better sited some miles away from cultural consumption facilities - except in some very tolerant cities and in countries where a boisterous alcohol-based nightlife scene does not lead to aggressive and anti-social behaviour.

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] the term sometimes used is "Cultural quarter" or "Arts quarter".

== Types of Arts Districts ==
Steiner and Butler outline five types of arts districts commonly found in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steiner|first=Frederick|title=Planning and Urban Design Standards|year=2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-471-76090-0|page=242|author2=Kent Butler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Cultural compounds - tend to be the oldest art districts often established in cities before the 1930s.  These tend to be well-known art districts engrained into the mentality and culture of a community or nation.
# Major Cultural Institutions - large institutions that serve as anchors for an arts district such as large concert halls, playhouses, libraries, or museums.
# Arts and entertainment centers - focus primarily on smaller, popular attractions such as small theaters, private galleries, restaurants, and other entertainment that often has a more bohemian feel than larger more established districts.
# Downtown Arts Districts - occasionally art districts encompass an entire downtown and especially when tourism and walk-ability is the focus of downtown.
# Cultural Production Districts - cultural production districts are characterized by production spaces such as specialized studios, arts centers, and media facilities.  These areas are often tied to affordable studio housing for artists and prioritize the cultural life of the neighborhood.

A '''black cat''' is a [[Cat|domestic cat]] with black fur that may be a mixed or specific [[Purebred|breed]]. The [[Cat Fanciers' Association]] (CFA) recognizes 22 cat [[breed]]s that can come with solid black coats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.catchannel.com/breeds/black-cat-breeds.aspx|title= Black Cat Breeds and History|first= Stacy N.|last= Hackett|date= 2015-08-17|publisher= CatChannel.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150906094914/http://www.catchannel.com/breeds/black-cat-breeds.aspx|archivedate= 2015-09-06|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bombay cat|Bombay]] breed is exclusively black. All-black fur pigmentation is slightly more prevalent in male cats than female cats. Their high [[melanin]] pigment content causes most black cats to have yellow (golden) eyes ([[iris (anatomy)|irises]]).

==Coat==
{{see also|Cat coat genetics}}
Any cat whose fur is a single color, including black, is known as a "solid" or "self". A "solid black" cat may be coal black, grayish black, or brownish black. Most solid-colored cats result from a recessive gene that suppresses the tabby pattern. Sometimes the tabby pattern is not completely suppressed; faint markings may appear in certain lights, even on a solid black cat. A cat having black fur with white roots is known as a "black smoke."&lt;ref name="colorfaq"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cat Colors FAQ: Common Colors |url=http://fanciers.com/other-faqs/colors.html |publisher=Cat Fanciers Chat (fanciers.com) |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62ISL6nRl?url=http://fanciers.com/other-faqs/colors.html |archivedate=2011-10-09 |accessdate=2011-10-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black cats can also "rust" in sunlight, the coat turning a lighter brownish shade.&lt;ref name="colorfaq"/&gt; Eumelanin, the pigment that is required to produce the black fur, is somewhat fragile, so the rusting effect can be more pronounced in cats that frequently spend time in the sun. A rarer condition that can also cause rusting is a deficiency of the enzyme tyrosine, which is required to produce eumelanin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://paws-and-effect.com/why-is-my-black-cat-rusting/|title=Why Is My Black Cat "Rusting"?|publisher=Paws and Effect|date=2015-09-13|accessdate=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:A black Cat-photographed by Rajdeep Das.JPG|thumb|A black cat "rusting" (coat turning a lighter brown shade) in sunlight]]

In addition to the [[Bombay (cat)|Bombay]], the [[Cat Fanciers' Association]] allows solid black as a color option in 21 other breeds. The color description for those breeds is:

:''Black'': dense coal black, sound from roots to tip of fur. Free from any tinge of rust on the tips. Nose leather: black. Paw pads: black or brown.

The exceptions are:
*[[Oriental Shorthair|Oriental]] – ''Ebony'': dense coal black. Free from any tinge of rust on tips or smoke undercoat. Nose leather: black. Paw pads: black or brown.
*[[Sphynx cat|Sphynx]] – ''Black'': black. One level tone from nose to tip of tail. Nose leather: black. Paw pads: black or brown.
*[[Ragamuffin cat|Ragamuffin]] – Although black is not specifically mentioned, the standard allows for "any color, with or without white," so technically speaking, an all-black Ragamuffin would be allowed under the breed standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cats.about.com/od/blackcats/ss/factsaboutblackcats_5.htm |title=Facts About Black Cats |author=Syufy, Franny |publisher=[[About.com]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62ISnsOfs?url=http://cats.about.com/od/blackcats/ss/factsaboutblackcats_5.htm |archivedate=2011-10-09 |accessdate=2011-10-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical associations==

===Superstition, prejudice, bringer of good or bad luck===

The [[folklore]] surrounding black cats varies from culture to culture. The [[Scottish people|Scots]] believe that a strange black cat's arrival to the home signifies prosperity. In [[Celtic mythology]], a [[fairy]] known as the [[Cat sìth]] takes the form of a black cat. Black cats are also considered good luck in the rest of Britain and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csicop.org/superstition/library/black_cats |title=Superstition Bash Black Cats |year=2011 |location=Amherst, New York |publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62ITHwwRN?url=http://www.csicop.org/superstition/library/black_cats |archivedate=2011-10-09 |accessdate=2011-10-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it is believed that a lady who owns a black cat will have many suitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.petside.com/article/black-cat-myths |title=Black Cat Myths |author=Singer, Jo |publisher=PetSide.com |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62ITlNtPa?url=http://www.petside.com/article/black-cat-myths |archivedate=2011-10-09 |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-11-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Western history, black cats have typically been looked upon as a symbol of evil omens, specifically being suspected of being the [[familiar spirit|familiar]]s of witches, or actually [[shape-shifting]] witches themselves. Most of Europe considers the black cat a symbol of bad luck, particularly if one walks across the path in front of a person, which is believed to be an omen of misfortune and death. In Germany, some believe that black cats crossing a person's path from right to left, is a bad omen. But from left to right, the cat is granting favorable times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.best-cat-art.com/black-cats.html |title=Black Cats... Do black cats mean good luck or bad luck for you? |first= |last= |year=2011 |publisher=Best-Cat-Art.com |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62IU8Z7tU?url=http://www.best-cat-art.com/black-cats.html |archivedate=2011-10-09 |accessdate=2011-10-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom it is commonly considered that a black cat crossing a person's path is a good omen.&lt;ref name="Superstitionsonline"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://superstitionsonline.com/cats/|title= Black Cats and Cats in General|date= 2012-01-19|publisher= Superstitionsonline.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150401190628/http://superstitionsonline.com/cats|archivedate= 2015-04-01|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The black cat in folklore has been able to change into human shape to act as a spy or courier for witches or demons. When the [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] arrived at [[Plymouth Rock]], they brought with them a devout faith in the Bible. They also brought a deepening suspicion of anything deemed of Satan and were a deeply suspicious group. They viewed the black cat as a companion, or a familiar to witches. Anyone caught with a black cat would be severely punished or even killed. They viewed the black cat as part demon and part sorcery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecatsite.com/Snips/124/The-Mystique-Behind-Black-Cats.html |title=The Mystique Behind Black Cats |first=Mary Ann |last=Miller |year=2011 |publisher=The Cat Site.com |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6208I6S7P?url=http://www.thecatsite.com/Snips/124/The-Mystique-Behind-Black-Cats.html |archivedate=2011-09-27 |accessdate=2011-09-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These superstitions led people to kill black cats. There is no evidence from England of regular large-scale massacres of "satanic" cats, or of burning them in [[midsummer]] bonfires, as sometimes occurred elsewhere in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t71.e150 |title=''A Dictionary of English Folklore''|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2000 |accessdate=2009-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the supernatural powers ascribed to black cats were sometimes viewed positively; for example, sailors considering a "[[ship's cat]]" would want a black one because it would bring good luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Don't Shoot the Albatross!: Nautical Myths and Superstitions |last=Eyers |first=Jonathan |year=2011 |publisher=[[A &amp; C Black]] |location=London|isbn=978-1-4081-3131-2 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, fishermen's wives would keep black cats at home too, in the hope that they would be able to use their influence to protect their husbands at sea (see [[Ship's cat]]). The view of black cats being favorable creatures is attributed specifically to the Egyptian goddess Bast (or [[Bastet]]), the cat goddess. Egyptian households believed they could gain favor from Bastet by hosting black cats in their household. This view was held in the early 17th century by the English monarch [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. Upon the death of his treasured pet black cat, he is said to have lamented that his luck was gone. True to his claim, he was arrested the very next day and [[High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I|charged with high treason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cats.lovetoknow.com/Black_Cats |title=Black Cats |first=Ann |last=Parkinson |date= |publisher=Love To Know Cats |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62IX7iggs?url=http://cats.lovetoknow.com/Black_Cats |archivedate=2011-10-09 |accessdate=2011-10-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Piracy|Pirates]] of the 18th century believed that a black cat would bring different kinds of luck. If a black cat walks towards someone, that person will have bad luck. If a black cat walks away from someone, then that person will have good luck.

Conversely in the United Kingdom if a black cat walks towards someone, it brings good fortune, but if it walks away, it takes the good luck with it.&lt;ref name="Superstitionsonline" /&gt; If a black cat walks onto a ship and then walks off it, the ship is doomed to sink on its next trip.

Black cats have been found to have lower odds of adoption in American [[Animal shelter|shelters]] compared to other colors except brown, although black animals in general take more time to find homes. The reasons given include not only superstition, but also the perception of black as "boring" compared to other colors as well as the belief that black cats don't photograph well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.psyeta.org/jaaws/full_articles/5.1/leeper.pdf|title= Prediction of adoption versus euthanasia among dogs and cats in a California animal shelter|first1= Merry|last1= Lepper|first2= Philip H.|last2= Kass|first3= Lynette A.|last3= Hart|year= 2002|work= Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science, 2002;5(1):29-42 |publisher= School of Veterinary Medicine [[University of California]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060925235905/http://www.psyeta.org/jaaws/full_articles/5.1/leeper.pdf |archivedate= 2006-09-25|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="blkcatappr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://holidappy.com/holidays/Why-You-Should-Celebrate-Black-Cat-Appreciation-Day-on-August-17th|title=Why You Should Celebrate Black Cat Appreciation Day on August 17th|date=2018-07-19|author=Jennifer Wilber|publisher=holidappy.com|accessdate=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some shelters also suspend or limit adoptions of black cats around [[Halloween]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/31/living/black-cats-irpt/index.html?hpt=hp_c4|title= To be a black cat on Halloween|first= Rachel|last= Rodriguez|date= 2014-10-31|publisher= [[CNN]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141031142859/http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/31/living/black-cats-irpt/index.html?hpt=hp_c4|archivedate= 2014-10-31|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; for fear they will be tortured, or used as "living decorations" for the holiday and then abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/mayhem/blackcat.asp |title=Cat o'Nine Tales |first1=Barbara |last1=Mikkelson |first2=David |last2=Mikkelson |date=2005-10-27 |publisher=[[Snopes.com]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62IXk2kbc?url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/mayhem/blackcat.asp |archivedate=2011-10-09 |accessdate=2011-10-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="truth_halloween"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=74&amp;SubsectionID=114&amp;ArticleID=86024|author=Boks, Ed|title=The truth about black cats and Halloween|location=Prescott, Arizona|work=[[The Daily Courier (Arizona)|The Daily Courier]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61yCKuiNb?url=http://www.dcourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=74&amp;SubsectionID=114&amp;ArticleID=86024|archivedate=2011-09-25|date=2010-10-06|accessdate=2010-10-10|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailytoreador.com/news/article_9bcbeea6-ff85-11e0-8a42-0019bb30f31a.html |title=Humane Society refuses black cat adoption during Halloween season |author=Crump, Morgan |date=2011-10-25 |publisher=dailytoreador.com |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62yLXU9mn?url=http://www.dailytoreador.com/news/article_9bcbeea6-ff85-11e0-8a42-0019bb30f31a.html |archivedate=2011-11-05 |accessdate=2011-10-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, no one has ever documented in the history of humane work any relationship between adopting black cats and cats being killed or injured.

The day was chosen in memorial of June's passing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wset.com/story/15268242/august-18th-is-black-cat-appreciation-day |title=Black Cat Appreciation Day is August 17 |first=Jeremy |last=Mills |date=2011-08-15 |location=Lynchburg, Virginia |publisher=[[WSET-TV|WSET.com]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/611P0rdJc?url=http://www.wset.com/story/15268242/august-18th-is-black-cat-appreciation-day |archivedate=2011-08-18 |accessdate=2011-08-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.kpax.com/news/today-is-black-cat-appreciation-day/|title= Black Cat Appreciation Day for animal shelters|first= Robin|last= O'Day|date= 2012-08-17|location= Missoula, Montana|publisher= [[KPAX-TV|KPAX.com]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140817231310/http://www.kpax.com/news/today-is-black-cat-appreciation-day|archivedate= 2014-08-17|deadurl= yes|accessdate= 2012-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="blkcatappr"/&gt;

In the early days of television in the United States, many stations located on [[VHF]] channel 13 used a black cat as a mascot in order to make sport of being located on an "unlucky" channel number.

===Anarcho-syndicalism===

[[Image:Anarchist black cat.svg|left|thumb|The black cat of the Industrial Workers of the World, also adopted as a symbol by anarcho-syndicalists]]
Since the 1880s, the [[political colour|color]] [[black]] has been associated with [[anarchism]]. The black cat, in an alert, fighting stance was later adopted as an [[anarchist symbol]].

More specifically, the black cat—often called the "sab cat" or "sabo-tabby"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iww.org/en/history/dictionary |title=IWW Union Dictionary and Glossary |first= |last= |date=2005-05-01 |location=Chicago, Illinois |publisher=[[Industrial Workers of the World]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62IYWAFaL?url=http://www.iww.org/en/history/dictionary |archivedate=2011-10-09 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2011-10-09 |quote=A symbol for "sabotage" (i.e. inefficiency at the point of production by disgruntled workers), usually represented by a black cat with bared teeth. Also called "sab kitty", "sabo-tabby", or "the cat". |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;—is associated with [[anarcho-syndicalism]], a branch of anarchism that focuses on labor organizing (see [[Wildcat strike]]).

In testimony before the court in a 1918 trial of [[Industrial Workers of the World]] leaders, [[Ralph Chaplin]], who is generally credited with creating the IWW's black cat symbol, stated that the black cat "was commonly used by the boys as representing the idea of [[Industrial Workers of the World philosophy and tactics#Sabotage|sabotage]]. The idea being to frighten the employer by the mention of the name sabotage, or by putting a black cat somewhere around. You know if you saw a black cat go across your path you would think, if you were superstitious, you are going to have a little bad luck. The idea of sabotage is to use a little black cat on the boss."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Salerno |first1=Salvatore |title=Red November, Black November: Culture and Community in the Industrial Workers of the World |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_M25WbGARJwC&amp;pg=PA178|year=1989|location= Albany, New York|publisher= [[SUNY Press]]|isbn=0-7914-0089-1 |page=178 }} from U.S. v.

In the United States, "Black Cat Appreciation Day" is August 17.&lt;ref name="AnimalFound"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://animalfoundation.com/black-cats-the-good-the-bad-and-the-misunderstood/|title= Black Cats — The Good, The Bad, and The Misunderstood|date= n.d.|location= Las Vegas, Nevada|publisher= The Animal Foundation|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161028021839/http://animalfoundation.com/black-cats-the-good-the-bad-and-the-misunderstood/|archivedate= 2016-10-28|deadurl= no|accessdate= 2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by the [[ASPCA]] shows that black cats are the least likely to be adopted from shelters of any type of cat.&lt;ref name="AnimalFound" /&gt; This can be partly because of the superstition behind black cats such as their association with witchcraft or bad luck, or because they appear dull next to more colorful cats. In 2014 [[Toronto]], Canada's largest city, held an event on [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]] during which people could adopt a black cat without paying the usual $75 adoption fee, in order to encourage the adoption of black cats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2014/11/22/adoption_fees_being_waved_for_black_cats_at_shelters.html|title= Adoption fees being waived for black cats at shelters|first= Katherine|last= Declerq|date= 2014-11-22|location= Toronto, Ontario|work= [[Toronto Star]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160410110242/http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2014/11/22/adoption_fees_being_waved_for_black_cats_at_shelters.html|archivedate= 2016-04-10|deadurl= no|quote= Animal Services will be hosting a “cat adoption blitz” in honour of Black Friday.

With the success of the 2018 African-themed [[Superhero film]], ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'', there was a fad of adopting black domestic cats as pets and naming them after various characters of the film such as [[T'Challa]] and [[Shuri (comics)|Shuri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ahsan|first1=Sadaf|title=Thanks to Black Panther, there's been a reported rise in black cat adoptions|url=http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/movies/thanks-to-black-panther-theres-been-a-reported-rise-in-black-cat-adoptions|accessdate=2 March 2018|publisher=The National Post|date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been observed that usually people were not going out of their way to follow this fad, but visited animal shelters to simply adopt a pet under normal circumstances and were inspired by the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] to adopt a black cat when they see one. Regardless, to reduce the chance of such cats being abandoned when the fad fades, reputable animal shelter personnel took the usual precautions of having potential adopters fill out questionnaires to weed out potentially abusive guardians and have them read literature about the needs and responsibilities of such a pet to dissuade the less conscientious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chorney|first1=Saryn|title=A Kitten Named Wakanda?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="949">'''Bond paper''' is a high quality durable [[writing paper]] similar to [[bank paper]] but having a [[Paper density|weight]] greater than 50&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The most common weights are 60&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (16&amp;nbsp;lb), 75&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (20&amp;nbsp;lb) and 90 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (24&amp;nbsp;lb). The name comes from its having originally been made for documents such as [[government bond]]s. It is now used for [[letterhead]]s and other [[stationery]] and as paper for electronic [[Computer printer|printers]]. Widely employed for graphic work involving pencil, pen and felt-tip marker, bond paper can sometimes contain rag fibre pulp, which produces a stronger, though rougher, sheet of paper.

A '''Brunaille''' is a painting executed entirely or primarily in shades of brown.  Such a painting is described as having been painted "''en brunaille''".&lt;ref&gt;Christie’s, ''Sale 2437, Old Master Pictures'', lot 51, Amsterdam, Christie’s, 8 November 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  

''Brunaille'' has its roots in 12th century [[stained glass]] made for [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monasteries,  which prohibited the use of colored art in 1134. However, it was only in the early 17th century that the French term “''brunaille''” was coined to describe pictures painted in shades of brown.&lt;ref&gt; Christie’s, ''Sale 1380, Old Master Paintings'', lot 49, New York, Christie’s, 17 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Brunaille are less common than paintings executed in grey (''[[grisaille]]''), though more common than those in green ([[verdaille]]).

'''Color-blocking''' is thought of as the exploration of taking colors that are opposites on the color wheel and pairing them together to make interesting and complementary color combinations.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Color-blocking|url=http://blog.blisshomeanddesign.com/2015/06/15/building-blocks-a-brief-history-of-color-blocking/|website=Bliss by Design|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly associated in fashion as a trend that originated from the artwork of Dutch painter, [[Piet Mondrian]]. However, other experts argue whether his artwork is the true origin of color-blocking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ellenduffer.com/2012/03/23/origin-of-the-trend-color-blocking/|title=Origin of the Trend: Color Blocking|first=Ellen|last=Duffer|date=23 March 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Mondriaanmode_door_Yves_St_Laurent_(1966).jpg|thumb|Mondrian dresses by Yves Saint Laurent]]
It’s widely believed by most historians that [[Piet Mondrian]], a turn of the century artist, whose paintings were a collection of stark lines and flat squares, inspired this current color-blocking trend.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; Mondrian valued simplicity and therefore experimented with how far he could simplify his work, maximizing simplicity while still maintaining recognizable, although abstract, geometric shapes. Mondrian later named this style of painting Neo-Plasticism.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; In Piet Mondrian's Neoplasticism movement, his art directly inspired the fashion world, as well as home décor and baked goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegefashion.net/inspiration/fashion-inspired-by-art-piet-mondrians-color-blocking/|title=Fashion Inspired by Art: Piet Mondrian's Color Blocking|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Mondrian is said to be the key figure of the modern art movement, there are others that believe the credit for this trend lies with [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Claude Monet]].&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; However sources report that it is Piet Mondrian who inspired other designers such as [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]] to create the famous Mondrian Dresses.&lt;ref name="College Fashion"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fashion Inspired by Art: Piet Mondrian's Color-blocking|url=http://www.collegefashion.net/inspiration/fashion-inspired-by-art-piet-mondrians-color-blocking/|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Mondrian's aesthetic overtook the fashion world, pop art's materialization in the 50s opened America's eyes to a more vibrant but structured world. [[Pop Art]] incorporated the same clean lines and solid colors that Piet Mondrian's work encompassed. Proponents of the Georges Seurat and Monet origin theory claim that this novel acceptance lead to the color-blocking revolution.&lt;ref name="Origins of Color-blocking"&gt;{{cite web|title=Origin of the Trend: Color Blocking|url=http://ellenduffer.com/2012/03/23/origin-of-the-trend-color-blocking/|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mondrian's Neo-Plasticism aesthetic evolved through the decades, coming to include aspects such as synthetic color and a strong imposed structure in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; The color-blocking trend took off in the 60s as fashion designers like Yves Saint Laurent adopted this revolutionary aesthetic. It wasn't long before this new trend was reaching as far as London; the youth of London began wearing ensembles that would come to be known as mod fashion.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; Mod fashion much resembled the artistic style of Piet Mondrian; mismatched, solid color separates that were composed of blocks in different hues.

As for today color-blocking is more frequently seen in the home as a latest thing in interior design.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Color-blocking"/&gt; Although some argue that color-blocking is a thing in the past, high fashion figures and enthusiasts believe that this retro trend continues to thrive as a result of the hipster generation, whom revive the trend and turn it into something seen as fashion-forward.

==Process==
In the fashion world, the process of color-blocking refers to wearing blocks of colors. Color-blocking is different than how people usually dress because the colors in the outfit are considered louder, or colors that clash. Fashion figures explain color-blocking as wearing multiple articles of solid-colored clothing in a single outfit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aol.com/article/2013/10/15/the-art-of-colorblocking/20743446/?swp=1|title=The art of colorblocking|first=AOL|last=Staff|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional color-blocking consists of putting together two or three different, but complementary colors together in one outfit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fashiondujourdaily.wordpress.com/2011/03/10/color-blocking-101-what-how/|title=Color Blocking 101: What &amp; How|first=FASHION du|last=jour|date=11 March 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also considered color-blocking even if the colors are not direct opposites on the color wheel. For example, yellow and orange are right next to each other, but adding purple (a color on the opposite of the wheel) creates a color-blocked outfit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://achicdirection.com/2011/03/29/what-is-color-blocking/|title=Protected Blog › Log in|website=achicdirection.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
Fashion icons, designers, and figures have developed rules that go along with the art of color-blocking. Basic rules for color-blocking are centered on the colour theory. The colour theory states that there are unwritten rules in color-blocking such as not wearing too many colors together at once, and balancing an outfit with a neutral such as grey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-rules-of-colour-blocking-2012370|title=Rules of colour blocking - Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|date=21 August 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
Since color-blocking is an abstract form of art, it is easy to create illusions for accentuating body shapes, making people look taller and thinner. Color-blocking provides versatility to clothing that other trends and styles don't provide.&lt;ref name="Rules of Colour blocking"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rules of Colour Blocking|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-rules-of-colour-blocking-2012370|website=DNA|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interior design==
Color-blocking has recently spilled over into home décor and interior design. This trend takes the same idea in home design that is does in fashion: the colors are paired with no concern of matching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decorlove.com/color-blocking-in-home-decor-tips-and-inspirations/|title=Color Blocking In Home Decor – Tips And Inspirations|date=23 May 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the home color-blocking is used mainly in room décor and walls. Décor clashing with each other, or in more mild cases the opposite colors complement each other to provide an interesting and refreshing atmosphere in a room.

'''Color symbolism''' in [[art]] and [[anthropology]] refers to the use of color as a [[symbol]] in various [[Culture|cultures]]. There is great diversity in the use of colors and their associations between cultures&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Smith|first=N.S. |last2=Whitfield|first2=T.W.A. |last3=Wiltshire|first3=T.J. |date=April 1990 |title=The accuracy of the NCS, DIN, and OSA-UCS colour atlases |journal=Color Research &amp; Application |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=111–116 |doi=10.1002/col.5080150209 |issn=0361-2317}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even within the same culture in different time periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Color psychology and color therapy: a factual study of the influence of color on human life |last=Birren |first=Faber |date=2006 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |isbn=978-1425424107 |location=Whitefish, MT |oclc=74452551}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same color may have very different associations within the same culture at any time. Diversity in color symbolism occurs because color meanings and symbolism occur on an individual, cultural and universal basis. Color symbolism is also context-dependent and influenced by changes over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Color symbolism |doi=10.5040/9781501303364.ch-014 |title=Color Studies |editor1=Edith Anderson Feisner |editor2=Ronald Reed |edition=3rd |year=2016 |publisher=Bloomsbury |location=New York |isbn=978-1-50130-336-4 |oclc=1053938255 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolic representations of religious concepts or articles may include a specific color with which the concept or object is associated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |language=de |title=Encyclopaedia Britannica|doi=10.1163/9789004337862_lgbo_com_050367 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence to suggest that colors have been used for this purpose as early as 90,000 BC.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

Red is often associated with love, passion, and lust. It is frequently used in relation to Valentine's Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=valentine&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJobTilr7eAhWCLn0KHaP-BZIQ_AUIFCgC&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=618 |title=valentine - Google Search|website=www.google.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be used to signify danger or warning. For instance, it is used for stop signs&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Road vertical signs.

==Color symbolism in marketing==
Color plays an important role in setting expectations for a product and communicating its key characteristics.&lt;ref name=Asiam&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Aslam |first=Mubeen M. |date=2006 |title=Are You Selling the Right Colour? A Cross‐Cultural Review of Colour as a Marketing Cue |journal=Journal of Marketing Communications |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=15–30 |doi=10.1080/13527260500247827}}&lt;/ref&gt; Color is the second most important element that allows consumers to identify brand packaging.&lt;ref name=Popa&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Popa|first=C.N. |last2=Popescu|first2=S. |last3=Berehoiu|first3=R.M.T. |last4=Berehoiu|first4=S.M.T. |date=2013 |title=Considerations regarding use and role of colour in marketing |url=http://managementjournal.usamv.ro/pdf/vol.XIII/Art44.pdf |journal= Scientific Papers Series - Management, Economic Engineering in Agriculture and Rural Development |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=269–274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marketers for products with an international market navigate the color symbolism variances between cultures with targeted advertising. The car manufacturer, Volkswagen ran a commercial in Italy with a black sheep in the middle of a larger flock symbolizing those who owned a VW Golf as someone unique and self-assured among a crowd of others who were not. In several cultures around the world, a black sheep represents an outcast and is seen as something undesirable. In Italy, a black sheep represents confidence and independence.[[File:Friaul Val Aupa Drentus Sheep credit Kaspar Nickles 2017.jpg|thumb|Friaul Val Aupa Drentus Sheep credit Kaspar Nickles 2017]] There are many additional variances in color symbolism between cultures. Cold is symbolized by blue in East Asia, the USA, and Sweden while warmth is symbolized by yellow in the USA and by blue in The Netherlands. Sometimes the meanings of colors are in stark opposition across geographic boundaries, requiring products marketed to specific demographics to account for those changes across different markets. For instance, feminity is symbolized by blue in The Netherlands and pink in the USA., whereas masculinity is symbolized by blue in Sweden and the USA, and red in the UK and France.&lt;ref name=Asiam/&gt; In some instances color symbolism in marketing is constructed. For companies whose products are defined by the name of their color their sales are susceptible to the symbolism and association of that name. In one example, a company selling a paint color named “off white” more than doubled its sales by renaming the same color as “ancient silk.”&lt;ref name=Popa/&gt;

==Conceptualizations of colors cross-culturally==
Color symbolism has morphed over time. Between the 5th and 17th centuries color was largely related to in a religious context. Blue was symbolic of heaven and white of purity. Today, purity is still symbolized by white in Australia and the USA but by blue in other countries like India. Similarly, the church influenced the perception of colors like crimson and purple. Largely because the dyes for these colors could only be sourced from precious pigments, religious figures like Madonna, Cardinals, and the Virgin were seen in scarlet and purple. [[File:Vatican II - Dubois - Liénart.JPG|thumb|Vatican II - Dubois - Liénart]]Today, purple symbolizes evil and infidelity in Japan, but the same is symbolized by blue in East Asia and by yellow in France. Additionally, the sacred color of Hindu and Buddhist monks is orange. [[File:Preah Pithu T Monks - Siem Reap.jpg|thumb|Preah Pithu T Monks - Siem Reap]] The Renaissance was also a time in which black and purple were colors of mourning. Today, Mourning or death is symbolized by white in East Asia, black in the USA, and blue in Iran, while happiness is symbolized by white in Australia and NZ, and yellow in China.&lt;ref name=Asiam/&gt;

There is a general disagreement over whether reactions to color and their symbolism are a result of cultural conditioning or of instinct. Several studies concluded that color is part of the social learning process because of the significant symbolism within the culture. High quality, trustworthiness and dependability are symbolized by blue in the USA, Japan, Korea and green and yellow in China - as well as purple in China, South Korea and Japan. Because of these variances, critical cues vary across cultures. Warning signs are coded differently as danger is symbolized by green in Malaysia, and red in the USA and Mexico. The same color of green symbolizes envy in Belgium and the USA, but envy is symbolized by yellow in Germany and Russia, and purple in Mexico. Even the colors that denote powerful emotions vary. Love is symbolized by green in Japan, red and purple in China, Korea, Japan and the USA. Unluckiness is symbolized by red in Chad, Nigeria and Germany. Luckiness is symbolized by red in China, Denmark and Argentina. The traditional bridal color is red in China and white in the USA. Ambition and desire are symbolized by red in India.&lt;ref name=Asiam/&gt;

== Color symbolism in Arabic culture ==
Color has different meanings in different countries.  We can specifically look at the Arabic culture and take it into consideration. We can start with the color white. In the Arabic culture, white is thought of as the color that is symbolic for nature.  Since it related with nature, it has a meaning that is one of positivity. It also relates with that of being clean and pure.  White is a color that is commonly worn during prayers and with that, it symbolizes purity. White’s positive connotation carries out into other aspects.  It is also used as a symbol for positivity in the future. White is also used to symbolize the end of war. You will also see women adorn white at their weddings as a sign of positivity.  Since doves are white, they share the symbolic meaning that comes with the color.  This in turn causes them to be associated with positivity of good news. 

When you look at the color Black in Arabic culture you can find that it is related to funerals and death. Women will often wear black to funerals in order to show that they are sad for those who have passed.  Also relating to death, black is associated with hell. Black is also used to symbolize dark.  Hell is thought to be a dark black place associating black as negative.  Black in general is looked at as having negative connotations around it. For example, the symbolism of a black heart refers to someone who is unkind.  
[[File:Red rose with black background.jpg|thumb]]
Green is a color that is commonly found in Islam.  It is a color found in nature and with this, it is associated with and represents goodness. Green is a color that has an overall positive meaning.   The color green also has to do with truthfulness, again going with positivity.  If you look at phrases, the symbolic meanings are generally positive.  If you look at the phrase green hand, it relates to being generous which is a positive thing. 

Red has an overall positive association with it. Often you will find that red is a color associated with roses and blood.  The color red has to do with love and passion.  In sayings you can find it to have either a negative or positive meaning such as the term red eye relates with anger.  The Arabic culture also associates this color with death.

Blue is related with positivity when discussing it with nature, otherwise it can be related with negative connotations. When used in the phrase blue eyes, it refers to jealousy. A blue body relates with death and therefore is associated with negativity.

Yellow is another color that is also associated with nature and the sun.  Again, since it is a color related with nature, it takes on the symbolic meaning of positivity.  Gold is also categorized under here and is also takes on a positive meaning.  Generally, when used in phrases, the color yellow has to do with negativity.  For example, a yellow smile means to be mean.

==Colors and emotions==
[[File:Emotions - 3.png|thumb]]
Color symbolism is displayed in many ways. One of the most common ways we see color symbolism displayed in through our emotions. In this article Color-emotions associations: Past experience and personal preference it takes a look at how we connect colors with our emotions and how it depends on a person’s preference and or their past experiences. 
	This article first starts out by talking about the different colors and what they are associated with. The first color it talks about is the color blue and how people see blue as comfort and security and how they see orange as being upsetting. The next one they talk about is yellow which is more of a happy color compared to purple which they say is dignified but I have never heard of purple being seen that way. The next one this article talks about which I find very interesting is the color red. People view the color red in two different ways, one being as a strong and passionate color. However, it is also seen in a very different way, people see it as an aggressive color because it is the color of blood. The last color this article talks about is the color green and how just like red it has two different views. Green can be viewed positively as in quietness but can also be viewed negatively as in guilt. 
	This study took a look at how we associate colors with emotions. This study was done and showed that we associated lighter colors such as blue or yellow with more positive emotions. It then showed how we associated darker colors such as grey or black with more native emotions. However, something very interesting that this study did find is that most young prefer the color black over many other colors. 
	The study was done with college aged students to see how they associate their emotions with colors. Many tests were done such as matching tasks and matching color tests to see what colors they associate with their emotions. The study had 44 men and 54 women in it and they again were all college students. They identified a color sample with one emotion only and it showed what emotional response is connected to a color. 
	The results from this study did find that people mostly associate the color green with being the most positive. Over 95% off people said that green s the most positive because it makes them feel relaxed and then comfortable and at peace. It also showed that people saw yellow as the more excited and energetic emotion, with over 90% agreeing with this. 79% of students found that blue was a calming color because it reminded them of the ocean which is known as a calming place. People did have different answers when it came to red because like explained earlier, red is seen in two very different ways, It has been seen as love by many but also as evil because it remind people of blood. Many people did not seem to like the color purple very much as it was not favored by many for their preferences. The color black was seen to be more negative emotions like fear and depression. Overall, this article shows how color can be important because it is how people associate their emotions and things based on color symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;Kaya &amp; H., Naz &amp; Helen.

As originally conceived, Powers saw the public watching volunteers undergoing actual [[waterboarding]].&lt;ref name=NYMag2008-06-27/&gt;
''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that on August 17, 2008 Powers brought in [[Mike Ritz]], a former US official experienced in administering waterboarding, for a one time demonstration of waterboarding on volunteers.&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost2008-08-17/&gt;  
This demonstration was not open to the general public, but rather for an invited audience.
Powers himself was one of the volunteers.

As built, the [[Amusement ride|thrill ride]] was a diorama, where viewers would mount stairs to a window where they would see a tableau of two models, one a captive, one a masked interrogator.  The captive was wearing an [[Guantanamo captives' uniform|orange uniform]] "[[non-compliant]]" captives wear in the [[United States]]' [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]]s, in [[Cuba]], and was spread-eagled on a tilted table.

When the piece was installed, in July 2008, viewers inserted a dollar the interrogator figure would pour water onto a rag over the captive figures' nose and throat, upon which the captive figure would start convulsing.

The piece was installed in a row of ordinary Coney Island freak shows and [[concession stand|concessions]].
When installed the thrill ride triggered coverage and commentary around the world.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Dahomey Amazons''' or '''''Mino''''', which means "our mothers," were a [[Fon people|Fon]] all-female military regiment of the [[Kingdom of Dahomey]] in the present-day [[Republic of Benin]] which lasted until the end of the 19th century. They were so named by Western observers and historians due to their similarity to the mythical [[Amazons]] of ancient [[Anatolia]] and the [[Black Sea]].

==Origin==
[[File:Dahomey amazon2.jpg|right|frame|Dahomey Amazons in around 1890]]
King [[Houegbadja]] (who ruled from 1645 to 1685), the third King of [[Dahomey]], is said to have originally started the group which would become the Amazons as a corps of elephant hunters called the ''gbeto''.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|p=20}}

Houegbadja's son King [[Agaja]] (ruling from 1708 to 1732) established a female bodyguard armed with muskets. European merchants recorded their presence. According to tradition, Agaja developed the bodyguard into a militia and successfully used them in Dahomey's defeat of the neighbouring kingdom of [[Savi]] in 1727.{{sfn|Law|1993|p=}} The group of female warriors was referred to as ''Mino'', meaning "Our Mothers" in the [[Fon language]], by the male army of Dahomey.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|p=44}} Other sources contest that King Agaja's older sister Queen Hangbe was the ruler to establish the units, however some contest if Queen Hangbe actually existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20180826-the-legend-of-benins-fearless-female-warriors|title=The legend of Benin’s fearless female warriors|last=Macdonald|first=Fleur|language=en|access-date=2018-08-26|date=2018-08-26|website=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time of King [[Ghezo]] (ruling from 1818 to 1858), Dahomey became increasingly militaristic. Ghezo placed great importance on the army, increasing its budget and formalizing its structure from ceremonial to a serious military. While European narratives refer to the women soldiers as "Amazons", they called themselves ''ahosi'' (king's wives) or ''Mino'' (our mothers).{{sfn|Law|1993|p=}} Europeans exchanged goods such as knives, bayonets, firearms and fabrics for prisoners that the Dahomey captured during wars and raids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m02fdq|title=Dahomey - Google Arts &amp; Culture|work=Google Cultural Institute|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recruitment==
[[File:Dahomey amazon1.jpg|thumb|[[Seh-Dong-Hong-Beh]], a leader of the Amazons]]
Ghezo recruited both men and women soldiers from foreign captives, though women soldiers were also recruited from free Dahomean women, some enrolled as young as 8 years old.{{sfn|Law|1993|p=}} Other accounts indicate that the ''Mino'' were recruited from among the ''ahosi'' ("king's wives") of which there were often hundreds.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|p=38}} Some women in Fon society became soldiers voluntarily, while others were [[conscription|involuntarily enrolled]] if their husbands or fathers complained to the king about their behavior.

Membership among the ''Mino'' was supposed to hone any aggressive character traits for the purpose of war. During their membership they were not allowed to have children or be part of married life (though they were legally married to the king). Many of them were virgins. The regiment had a semi-sacred status, which was intertwined with the [[Fon people|Fon]] belief in [[Vodun]].

The ''Mino'' trained with intense physical exercise. They learnt survival skills and indifference to pain and death, storming [[acacia]]-thorn defenses in [[military exercises]] and executing prisoners.{{sfn|Dash|2011}} Discipline was emphasised.

Serving in the ''Mino'' offered women the opportunity to "rise to positions of command and influence" in an environment structured for individual empowerment.{{sfn|Law|1993|p=}} The ''Mino'' were also wealthy and held high status.{{sfn|Dash|2011}}

==Political role==
The ''Mino'' took a prominent role in the Grand Council, debating the policy of the kingdom. From the 1840s to 1870s (when the opposing party collapsed), they generally supported peace with [[Abeokuta]] and stronger commercial relations with England, favouring the trade in [[palm oil]] above that in slaves; this set them at odds with their male military colleagues.{{sfn|Yoder|1974}}

Apart from the Council, the [[Annual Customs of Dahomey]] included a parade and reviewing of the troops, and the troops swearing of an oath to the king. The celebrations on the 27th day of the Annual Customs  consisted of a mock battle in which the Amazons attacked a "fort" and "captured" the slaves within,{{sfn|Yoder|1974}} a custom recorded by the priest Francesco Borghero in his diaries.{{sfn|Dash|2011}}

==Combat and structure==
The women soldiers were rigorously trained and given uniforms. By the mid-19th century, they numbered between 1,000 and 6,000 women, about a third of the entire Dahomey army, according to reports written by visitors. These documented reports also indicated that the women soldiers suffered several defeats.

The women soldiers were said to be structured in parallel with the army as a whole, with a center wing (the king's bodyguards) flanked on both sides, each under separate commanders. Some accounts note that each male soldier had a female warrior counterpart.{{sfn|Law|1993|p=}} In an 1849/50 account by an Englishman, it was documented that the women that had three stripes of [[whitewash]] around each leg, were honored with marks of distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dahomey And The Dahomans: Being The Journals Of Two Missions To The King Of Dahomey And Residence At His Capital 1849 To 1850|last=Forbes|first=Frederick|publisher=Kessinger Publishing LLC|year=2010|isbn=978-1163235027|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The women's army consisted of a number of regiments: huntresses, riflewomen, reapers, archers, and gunners. Each regiment had different uniforms, weapons and commanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/womeninafrica/women-soldiers-dahomey/pedagogical-unit/4|title=The women soldiers of Dahomey pedagogical unit 4 {{!}} Women|website=en.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter period, the Dahomean female warriors were armed with Winchester rifles, clubs and knives. Units were under female command. A 1851 published translation of a war chant of the women claims the warriors would chant, "a[s] the [[blacksmith]] takes an iron bar and by fire changes its fashion so have we changed our nature. We are no longer women, we are men."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adams|first=Maeve|date=Spring 2010|title=The Amazon Warrior Women and the De/construction of Gendered Imperial Authority in Nineteenth-Century Colonial Literature|url=http://m.ncgsjournal.com/issue61/New%20PDFs/NCGS%20Journal%20Issue%206.1%20-%20The%20Amazon%20Warrior%20Woman%20-%20Maeve%20E.%20Adams.pdf|journal=Nineteenth-Century Gender Studies|volume=6|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Conflict with neighbouring kingdoms===
The Dahomey kingdom was [[History of the Kingdom of Dahomey|often at war]] with its neighbors, and captives were needed for the [[History of slavery|slave trade]]. The Dahomey women soldiers fought in slave raids, as referenced in the Zora Neale Hurston non-fiction work  [[Barracoon: The Story of the Last "Black Cargo"|Baracoon]], and in the unsuccessful wars against [[Abeokuta]].

==Conflict with France==

=== First Franco-Dahomean War ===
European encroachment into West Africa gained pace during the latter half of the 19th century, and in 1890 King [[Béhanzin]] started fighting French forces in the course of the [[First Franco-Dahomean War]]. European observers noted that they "handled admirably" in hand to hand combat, but that they did not know how to use their flintlocks.{{sfn|Dash|2011}} The Amazons participated in one major battle: Cotonou, where thousands of Dahoney (including many Amazons) charged the French lines and engaged the defenders in hand-to-hand combat. Despite the compliments given to them by the Europeans, the Amazons were decisively crushed, with several hundred Dahomey troops being gunned down while 129 Dahomey were killed in melee combat within the French lines. The French lost 5 men killed and a few dozen wounded.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|p=195}} 

=== Second Franco-Dahomean War ===
According to Holmes, many of the French soldiers fighting in Dahomey hesitated before shooting or bayoneting the Amazons. The resulting delay led to many of the French casualties. By the end of the [[Second Franco-Dahomean War]], special units of the Amazons were being assigned specifically to target French officers.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|p=|pp=205}} After several battles, the French prevailed in the [[Second Franco-Dahomean War]] and put an end to the independent Dahomean kingdom. The legionnaires were impressed by the boldness of the Amazons and later wrote about the "incredible courage and audacity." Against a military unit with decidedly superior weaponry and a longer bayonet, however, the Dahomey Amazons could not prevail.&lt;ref&gt;Yoder, John C. (1974). "Fly and Elephant Parties: Political Polarization in Dahomey, 1840-1870". The Journal of African History. 15 (3): 417–432. doi:10.1017/s0021853700013566. &lt;/ref&gt; During a battle with French soldiers at [[Second Franco-Dahomean War#Battle of Adégon|Adegon]] on October 6 during the second war, the bulk of the Amazon corps were wiped out in a matter of hours in hand-to-hand combat after the French engaged them with a bayonet charge. For the loss of 86 Regulars and 417 Amazons, the Dahomey only managed to kill 6 French troops in the melee.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|p=203}}

==Disbandment==
[[File:The célébration at Abomey(1908). - The veteran amazones( AHOSI ) of the Fon king Béhanzin, Son of Roi Gélé.jpg|Veterans at in 1908.|thumb|Veterans at the annual meeting in Abomay in 1908]]
The troops were disbanded when the kingdom became a French [[protectorate]].{{sfn|Historical Museum of Abomey}} Oral tradition states that some surviving amazons secretly remained in Abomey afterwards, where they quietly assassinated a number of French officers. Other stories say the women pledged their services in protection of [[Agoli-agbo|Agoli-Agbo]], the brother of [[Béhanzin]], disguising themselves as his wives in order to guard him.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|pp=208-209}}

Some of the women married and had children, while others remained single. According to a historian who traced the lives of almost two dozen ex-amazons, all the women displayed difficulties adjusting to life as retired warriors, often struggling to find new roles in their communities that gave them a sense of pride comparable to their former lives. Many displayed a tendency to start fights or arguments that frightened their neighbours and relatives.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|pp=208-209}}

Between 1934 and 1942, several British travelers in [[Abomey]] recorded encounters with ex-amazons, now old women who spun cotton or idled around courtyards.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|pp=210-211}} The last survivor of the Dahomey Amazons is thought to have been a woman named Nawi. In a 1978 interview with a [[Benin|Beninese]] historian, Nawi claimed to have fought the French in 1892. Nawi died in November 1979, aged well over 100.{{sfn|Dash|2011}}

==In popular culture==

{{in popular culture|date=October 2018}}{{refimprove|date=October 2018}}
Dahomey Amazons were represented in the 1987 film ''[[Cobra Verde]]'' by [[German people|German]] director [[Werner Herzog]]. Ghezo's Amazons play a significant role in the novel ''[[Flash for Freedom!]]'' by [[George MacDonald Fraser]].

The unit is also depicted in (a special edition of, and now [[Downloadable content|DLC]] of) PC game ''[[Empire: Total War]]''. In the African Kingdoms expansion to ''[[Age of Empires II]]'', Gbeto are the Malian unique unit. In either game, the Dahomey/Gbeto are the only female military units.

A segment of ''[[QI]]'' Series 7 Episode 7 discussed Dahomey Amazons and showed a photo.

Referenced in [[Stieg Larsson]]'s novel ''[[The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest]]'' in the prelude to Part 4 ''Rebooting System''.

The warriors are also mentioned in [[Patrick O'Brian]]'s novel ''[[The Commodore]]'', book 17 of the [[Aubrey-Maturin series]].

The main character of [[Charles R. Saunders]] fantasy novel ''Dossouye'', an ahosi of Abomey, is closely modelled on the Dahomey ahosi.

[[P. C. Wren]]'s 1917 book of short stories ''[[Stepsons of France]]'' contains a story called ''"Here are Ladies"'', describing a series of clashes between troops of the [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]] and the Dahomey Amazons.

The warriors are also the main focus and written about in [[Layon Gray]]'s stage play ''[[Black Sparta]]''.{{sfn|Clodfelter|2017}}

The [[Dora Milaje]], army/bodyguards to the ''[[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'', are based partially off the Dahomey Amazons.{{sfn|Johnson|2018}}

In [[Zora Neale Hurston]]’s ''[[Barracoon: The Story of the Last "Black Cargo"|Barracoon]]'', 86 year old Cudjo Lewis, the last known survivor of the slaver [[Clotilda (slave ship)|Clotilda]], describes his own capture by Dahomey Amazons when he was 19 years old.

{{Anthropology |methods}}

In [[anthropology]], [[folkloristics]], and the [[social sciences|social]] and [[behavioral sciences]], '''emic''' and '''etic''' refer to two kinds of [[field research]] done and viewpoints obtained:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.sil.org/~headlandt/ee-intro.htm |title=EE intro |publisher=SIL}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''emic,'' from within the [[social group]] (from the perspective of the subject) and ''etic,'' from outside (from the perspective of the observer).

==Definitions==
"The emic approach investigates how local people think" (Kottak, 2006): How they perceive and categorize the world, their rules for behavior, what has meaning for them, and how they imagine and explain things. "The etic (scientist-oriented) approach shifts the focus from local observations, categories, explanations, and interpretations to those of the anthropologist.  The etic approach realizes that members of a culture often are too involved in what they are doing..... to interpret their cultures impartially. When using the etic approach, the [[ethnographer]] emphasizes what he or she considers important."&lt;ref&gt;Kottak, Conrad (2006). ''Mirror for Humanity'', p. 47. McGraw-Hill, New York. {{ISBN|978-0-07-803490-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although emics and etics are sometimes regarded as inherently in conflict and one can be preferred to the exclusion of the other, the complementarity of emic and etic approaches to anthropological research has been widely recognized, especially in the areas of interest concerning the characteristics of human nature as well as the form and function of human social systems.&lt;ref&gt;Jingfeng, Xia (2013). ''An Anthropological Emic-Etic Perspective On Open Access Practices'' Academic Search Premier.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote | …Emic knowledge and interpretations are those existing within a culture, that are ‘determined by local custom, meaning, and belief’ (Ager and Loughry, 2004: n.p.) and best described by a 'native' of the culture. Etic knowledge refers to generalizations about human behavior that are considered universally true, and commonly links cultural practices to factors of interest to the researcher, such as economic or ecological conditions, that cultural insiders may not consider very relevant (Morris et al., 1999).}}
Emic and etic approaches of understanding behavior and personality fall under the study of cultural anthropology. [[Cultural anthropology]] states that people are shaped by their cultures and their subcultures, and we must account for this in the study of personality.  One way is looking at things through an emic approach. This approach "is culture specific because it focuses on a single culture and it is understood on its own terms."  As explained below, the term "emic" originated from the specific linguistic term "phonemic", from ''[[phoneme]]'', which is a language-specific way of abstracting [[speech sound]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Friedman | first1 = Howard S | first2 = Miriam W | last2 = Schustack | title = Personality: Classic Theories and Modern Research | place = Boston | publisher = Pearson Allyn &amp; Bacon | year = 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://psychology.geckos.sis.org.cn/2011/10/using-one-or-more-examples-explain-emic-and-etic-concepts-akane/ |title=Using one or more examples explain emic &amp; etic concepts |last=Akane |publisher=SIS |place=[[China|CN]] |date=October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121203103812/http://psychology.geckos.sis.org.cn/2011/10/using-one-or-more-examples-explain-emic-and-etic-concepts-akane/ |archivedate=2012-12-03 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*An 'emic' account is a description of behavior or a belief in terms meaningful (consciously or unconsciously) to the actor; that is, an emic account comes from a person within the culture.  Almost anything from within a culture can provide an emic account.
*An 'etic' account is a description of a [[behavior]] or belief by a social analyst or scientific observer (a student or scholar of anthropology or sociology, for example), in terms that can be applied across cultures; that is, an etic account attempts to be 'culturally neutral', limiting any ethnocentric, political, and/or cultural bias or alienation by the observer.
When these two approaches are combined, the “richest” view of a culture or society can be understood. On its own, an emic approach would struggle with applying overarching values to a single culture. The etic approach is helpful in enabling researchers to see more than one aspect of one culture, and in applying observations to cultures around the world.

==History==
The terms were coined in 1954 by linguist [[Kenneth Pike]], who argued that the tools developed for describing [[linguistics|linguistic]] behaviors could be adapted to the description of any human social behavior. As Pike noted, social scientists have long debated whether their knowledge is objective or subjective.  Pike's innovation was to turn away from an [[epistemological]] debate, and turn instead to a methodological solution. ''Emic'' and ''etic'' are derived from the [[Linguistics|linguistic]] terms [[phoneme|phonemic]] and [[phonetic]] respectively, which are in turn derived from Greek roots.&lt;ref&gt;Liddell, H.G. &amp; Scott, R. (1940). A Greek-English Lexicon. revised and augmented throughout by Sir Henry Stuart Jones. with the assistance of. Roderick McKenzie. Oxford: Clarendon Press&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of a truly objective description was discounted by Pike himself in his original work; he proposed the emic/etic dichotomy in anthropology as a way around philosophic issues about the very nature of [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The terms were also championed by [[anthropology|anthropologists]] [[Ward Goodenough]] and [[Marvin Harris]] with slightly different connotations from those used by Pike. Goodenough was primarily interested in understanding the culturally specific meaning of specific beliefs and practices; Harris was primarily interested in explaining human behavior.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Pike, Harris, and others have argued that cultural "insiders" and "outsiders" are equally capable of producing emic ''and'' etic accounts of their culture. Some researchers use "etic" to refer to objective or outsider accounts, and "emic" to refer to subjective or insider accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sil.org/~headlandt/ee-intro.htm|title=Thomas N. Headland: Controversies: Etic-Emic Introduction|website=Sil.org|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margaret Mead]] was an anthropologist who studied the patterns of adolescence in Samoa. She discovered that the difficulties and the transitions that adolescents faced are culturally influenced. The hormones that are released during puberty can be defined using an etic framework, because [[adolescents]] globally have the same [[hormones]] being secreted. However, Mead concluded that how adolescents respond to these hormones is greatly influenced by their cultural norms. Through her studies, Mead found that simple classifications about behaviors and [[personality]] could not be used because peoples’ cultures influenced their behaviors in such a radical way.  Her studies helped create an emic approach of understanding behaviors and personality. Her research deduced that culture has a significant impact in shaping an individual’s personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/mead/field-sepik.html|title=Papua New Guinea: Sex and Temperament - Margaret Mead: Human Nature and the Power of Culture - Exhibitions - Library of Congress|work=loc.gov|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Jung]], a Swiss [[psychoanalyst]], is a researcher who took an etic approach in his studies. Jung studied [[mythology]], [[religion]], ancient rituals, and [[dreams]] leading him to believe that there are [[archetypes]] that can be identified and used to categorize people’s behaviors. Archetypes are universal structures of the collective unconscious that refer to the inherent way people are predisposed to perceive and process information.  The main archetypes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/personalitydevelopment/tp/archetypes.htm|title=What Are Jung's 4 Major Archetypes?|author=Kendra Cherry|work=About.com Education|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Jung studied were the [[persona]] (how people choose to present themselves to the world), the [[anima and animus|animus]]/ anima (part of people experiencing the world in viewing the opposite sex, that guides how they select their romantic partner), and the [[shadow]] (dark side of personalities because people have a concept of evil. Well-adjusted people must integrate both good and bad parts of themselves). Jung looked at the role of the [[mother]] and deduced that all people have mothers and see their mothers in a similar way; they offer nurture and comfort. His studies also suggest that “infants have evolved to suck milk from the breast, it is also the case that all children have inborn tendencies to react in certain ways.” This way of looking at the mother is an etic way of applying a concept cross-culturally and universally.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Importance as regards personality==
Emic and etic approaches are important to understanding personality because problems can arise “when concepts, measures, and methods are carelessly transferred to other cultures in attempts to make cross- cultural generalizations about personality.” It is hard to apply certain generalizations of behavior to people who are so diverse and culturally different. One example of this is the F-scale (Macleod).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/authoritarian-personality.html|title=Theories of Personality|work=simplypsychology.org|accessdate=21 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024113220/http://www.simplypsychology.org/authoritarian-personality.html|archivedate=24 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[F-scale (personality test)|F-scale]], which was created by [[Theodor Adorno]], is used to measure [[Authoritarian Personality]], which can, in turn, be used to predict prejudiced behaviors. This test, when applied to Americans accurately depicts [[prejudices]] towards black individuals. However, when a study was conducted in [[South Africa]] using the F-Scale, (Pettigrew and Friedman) &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; results did not predict any anti-Black prejudices. This study used emic approaches of study by conducting interviews with the locals and etic approaches by giving participants generalized personality tests.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4824">'''Fetish art''' is [[art]] that depicts people in [[sexual fetishism|fetishistic]] situations such as [[Sadomasochism|S&amp;M]], [[Domination and submission|domination/submission]], [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], [[transvestism]] and the like, sometimes in combination.

Fetish art can simply depict a person dressed in fetish clothing, which includes undergarments, stockings, high heels, corsets and boots.  A common fetish theme is a woman dressed as a [[dominatrix]].

Many of the 'classic' 1940s, 1950s and 1960s-era fetish artists such as [[Eric Stanton]] and [[Gene Bilbrew]] began their careers at [[Irving Klaw]]'s [[Movie Star News]] company (later Nutrix), creating drawings for episodic illustrated bondage stories.

In 1946 fetish artist John Coutts (a.k.a. [[John Willie]]) founded ''Bizarre'' magazine. Bizarre was first published in Canada, then printed in the U.S., and was the inspiration for a number of new [[fetish magazine]]s such as ''Bizarre Life''.&lt;ref name=Shorter&gt;{{cite book|title=Written in the flesh: a history of desire|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|author=Edward Shorter |year=2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5APaJ7yxVA4C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|isbn=0-8020-3843-3|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957 English engineer John Sutcliffe founded ''[[Atomage]]'' magazine, which featured images of the rubber clothing he had made.&lt;ref name=Shorter/&gt; Sutcliffe's work would inspire [[Dianna Rigg]]'s leather-catsuit-wearing character in ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'', a TV show that "opened the floodgates for fetish-SM images".&lt;ref name=Shorter/&gt;

In the 1970s and 1980s, fetish artists like Robert Bishop were published extensively in [[bondage magazine]]s.  In recent years, the annual SIGNY awards have been awarded to the bondage artists voted the best of that year. Many artists working in the mainstream [[comic book]] industry have included fetishistic imagery in their work, usually as a shock tactic or to denote villainy or corruption. The boost that depictions of beautiful women in tight fetish outfits give to the sales of comics to a mostly teenage male comic-buying audience may also be a factor.

In 1950s America comics with bondage or fetish themes began appearing.&lt;ref name=Slade&gt;{{cite book|title=Pornography and sexual representation: a reference guide|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|author=Joseph W. Slade |year=2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LNTS4rmCO9kC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|isbn=0-313-31519-1|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, fetish artists influenced the cartoons of [[George Petty]], [[Alberto Vargas]] and others, which featured in magazines like ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]''.&lt;ref name=Slade/&gt; Arguably the best known example of fetish imagery in comics is the catsuit-wearing, whip-wielding ''[[Catwoman]]'', who has been called, "an icon of fetish art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern Amazons: warrior women on screen|publisher=[[Hal Leonard Corporation]]|author=Dominique Mainon, James Ursini |year=2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AlKW5X7vccgC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|isbn=0-87910-327-2|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many S&amp;M, leather and fetish artists have produced images depicting [[urine fetishism]] ("watersports"), including Domino, [[Tom of Finland]], Matt and The Hun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Soaked!: A Watersports Handbook for Men|publisher=[[Leather Archives &amp; Museum]]|author=Joseph W.

Mainstream fine artists such as [[Allen Jones (sculptor)|Allen Jones]] have included strong fetish elements in their work. An artist whose [[erotica]] transcends to mainstream collectors is found in the Shunga and Shibari style works of [[Hajime Sorayama]]. [[Taschen]] books included artist Hajime Sorayama, whom his peer artists call a cross between [[Norman Rockwell]] and [[Salvador Dali]], or an imaginative modern day Vargas. Sorayama's robotic diverse illustrative works are in the permanent collections of the [[New York City]] [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) and the [[Smithsonian Institution]], as well as the fetish arts in the private [[World Erotic Art Museum Miami]] collection.

The works of contemporary fetish artists such as [[Roberto Baldazzini]] and [[Michael Manning (fetish artist)|Michael Manning]] are published by companies such as [[NBM Publishing]] and Taschen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3079">'''Fictive art''' is a practice that involves the production of objects, events, and entities designed to support the plausibility of a central narrative. Fictive art projects disguise their fictional essence by incorporating materials that stand as evidence for narrative factuality and thus are designed to deceive the viewer as to their ontological status. Very often, these materials take a form that carries presumptive cultural authority, such as 'historical' photographs or 'scientific' data. The key tension in fictive art projects stems from the impossibility of 'making real' a fiction, no matter how many or what kinds of objects are produced as evidence. Since fictive art projects are designed to pass at least temporarily as 'real', fictive artists may draw opprobrium as hoaxers, pranksters, forgers, or con artists when their projects are revealed as fictional.

==History and usage==
The term fictive art was originated by the artists [[Antoinette LaFarge]] and [[Lise Patt]], in the title of a panel at the College Art Association Conference of 2004. It is allied to the terms [[superfiction]] and [[parafiction]] but, unlike both, does not construct the central activity as a departure from (super, para) fiction. Instead, it argues for the primacy of the visual art components, emphasizing the role they play in establishing, extending, and enabling the central narrative. A number of exhibitions in recent years have included examples of fictive art as part of broad explorations of the relationship between media, illusion, and deception; examples include "More Real? Art in the Age of Truthiness" at SITE Santa Fe (2012) and "Faking It" at the Museum of Modern Art, New York (2012).

==Examples of fictive art==
Fictive art has antecedents going back several centuries; for example, the 'Rowley' creations of [[Thomas Chatterton]], the 'Formosan' inventions of [[George Psalmanazar]], or the [[Cottingley Fairies|Cottingley fairy]] photographs. With the rise of mass media in the second half of the 20th century, the practice of fictive art has expanded; it now includes such familiar forms as [[Mockumentary|mockumentaries]]. Notable practitioners and projects include David Wilson ([[The Museum of Jurassic Technology]]), [[Kahn &amp; Selesnick|Nicholas Kahn and Richard Selesnick]] (The Circular River), [[Beauvais Lyons]] (The Hokes Archives), [[Joan Fontcuberta]] (Sputnik), [[Eve Andree Laramee]] (Yves Fissiault), and [[Jim Shaw (artist)|Jim Shaw]] (O-ism).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6482">In [[art history]], '''formalism''' is the study of art by analyzing and comparing form and [[Style (visual arts)|style]]. Its discussion also includes the way objects are made and their purely visual aspects. In painting, formalism emphasizes [[composition (art)|compositional]] elements such as color, line, shape, texture, and other perceptual aspects rather than the historical and social context. At its extreme, formalism in art history posits that everything necessary to comprehending a work of art is contained within the work of art. The context for the work, including the reason for its creation, the historical background, and the life of the artist, that is, its conceptual aspect is considered to be of secondary importance.

==History==
The historical origin of the modern form of the question of aesthetic formalism is usually dated to [[Immanuel Kant]] and the writing of his third Critique where Kant states: "Every form of the objects of sense is either ''figure'' (''Gestalt'') or ''play'' (''Spiel''). In the latter case it is either play of figures or the mere play of sensations. The charm (''Reiz'') of colors... may be added, but the delineations (''Zeichnung'') in the... composition (''Komposition'')... constitute the proper object of the pure judgment of taste."&lt;ref&gt;Kant. ''Critique of Judgment''. Section 14.8.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher Donald Crawford has summarized Kant's position stating: "Thus, for Kant, form consists of the spatial... organization of elements: figure, shape, or delineation... In the parts of the ''Critique of Judgment'' in which form is emphasized as the essential aspect of beauty, Kant is consistently a pure formalist."&lt;ref&gt;Donald Crawford, ''Kant's Aesthetic Theory'' (Madison: The University of Wisconsin Press, 1974), p.&amp;nbsp;100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary definition==
The philosopher Nick Zangwill of Glasgow University has defined formalism in art as referring to those properties "that are determined solely by sensory or physical properties—so long as the physical properties in question are not relations to other things and other times."&lt;ref&gt;Nick Zangwill, ''The Metaphysics of Beauty'' (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2001), p.&amp;nbsp;56, {{ISBN|0801438209}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher and architect Branko Mitrovic has defined formalism in art and architecture as "the doctrine that states that the aesthetic qualities of works of visual art derive from the visual and spatial properties."&lt;ref&gt;Branko Mitrović, ''Philosophy for architects'' (New York: Princeton Architectural Press, [2011]), p.&amp;nbsp;51.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the observation that works of art can in general contain formal properties and nonformal properties, the philosopher Nick Zangwill has delineated three types of formalism as they are encountered at the turn of the 21st century. First, Zangwill identifies ''extreme formalists'' who think "that all works of art are purely formal works—where a work is purely formal if all its aesthetic properties are formal aesthetic properties," then he defines ''anti-formalist'' thinkers as those who "think that no works of art have formal aesthetic properties."&lt;ref name="z84"&gt;Zangwill 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;84.&lt;/ref&gt; The third type which Zangwill identifies as representing the transition of the philosophy of aesthetics into the 21st century is that of ''moderate formalism'', where its principal exponents defend the principle "that all the aesthetic properties of works of art in a select class are formal, and second, that although many works of art outside that class have nonformal aesthetic properties, many of those works also have important formal aesthetic properties that must not be ignored."&lt;ref name="z84"/&gt;

The philosopher Michalle Gal has offered a moderate version of formalism, entitled "Deep Formalism", which is a symbolic formalism based on philosophical aestheticism. The artwork is defined by her as deep form: "a form steeped in content that cannot be extracted from it. Artistic content, since it has no existence or sense apart from the form, cannot actually be referred to, other than speculatively. The content seals the form in an opaque, non-reflective, productive symbol."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.3726/978-3-0351-0787-6|title=Aestheticism: Deep Formalism and the Emergence of Modernist Aesthetics|last=Gal|first=Michalle|date=2015|publisher=Peter Lang AG|year=|isbn=9783035199925|location=|pages=14|language=en|doi=10.3726/978-3-0351-0787-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here she introduces a broad concept of symbol, an opaque-productive symbol: one that is not transparent to preconceived or pre-determined referents and meanings, but rather produces new ones.

==Uses in art history==
A formal analysis is an academic method in [[art history]] and criticism for [[analysis|analyzing]] works of [[art]]: "In order to perceive style, and understand it, art historians use 'formal analysis'. This means they describe things very carefully. These descriptions, which may include subjective vocabulary, are always accompanied by illustrations, so that there can be no doubt about what exists objectively".&lt;ref&gt;Review by: Clemency Chase Coggins of ''The Uses of Style in Archaeology'' edited by Margaret W. Conkey and Christine A. Hastorf, p.&amp;nbsp;233, ''Journal of Field Archaeology'', Vol. 19, No. 2 (Summer, 1992), pp.&amp;nbsp;232–34, Maney Publishing, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/529988 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Genre fiction''', also known as '''popular fiction''', is a term used in the book-trade for [[fiction|fictional works]] written with the intent of fitting into a specifically [[literary genre]], in order to appeal to readers and fans already familiar with that genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=French|first=Christy Tillery|title=Literary Fiction vs Genre Fiction|url=http://www.authorsden.com/visit/viewArticle.asp?id=18884|work=AuthorsDen|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although Genre fiction is generally distinguished from [[literary fiction]], a number of major literary figures have also written genre fiction, for example, [[John Banville]], publishes crime novels as Benjamin Black, and both [[Doris Lessing]], and [[Margaret Atwood]] have written science fiction. [[Georges Simenon]], the creator of the [[Maigret]] [[detective novel]]s, has been described by [[André Gide]] as "the most novelistic of novelists in French literature".&lt;ref&gt;Charles E. Claffey, ''The Boston Globe September'',  10, 1989 Contributing to this report was Boston Globe book editor Mark Feeney. http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1989-09-10/features/8903020475_1_inspector-maigret-georges-simenon-detective-story&lt;/ref&gt;

The main genres are crime, fantasy, romance, science fiction, western, inspirational, historical fiction and horror. More commercially oriented genre fiction has been dismissed by literary critics as poorly written or escapist.&lt;ref name=time/&gt;

==Genre and the marketing of fiction==

In the publishing industry the term "category fiction" is often used as a synonym for genre fiction, with the categories serving as the familiar shelf headings within the fiction section of a bookstore, such as [[Western fiction|Western]] or mystery.

The uncategorized section is known in the industry as "general fiction", but in fact many of the titles in this usually large section are often themselves genre novels that have been placed in the general section because sellers believe they will appeal, due to their high quality or other special characteristics, to a wider audience than merely the readers of that genre.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Adult fans are often embarrassed to read genre fiction in public,&lt;ref name=wollheim200606&gt;{{Cite magazine|url=http://www.locusmag.com/2006/Issues/06Wollheim.html|title=Locus Online: Betsy Wollheim interview excerpts|magazine=Locus |date=June 2006 | access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; but authors known for literary fiction have written novels under pseudonyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Merritt|first=Stephanie|title=Forget 'serious' novels, I've turned to a life of crime|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/14/crime-fiction-merritt-sj-parris|work=The Guardian|accessdate=11 April 2013|location=London|date=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=STASIO|first=MARILYN|title=Next Victim|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/books/review/Stasio-t.html?pagewanted=print&amp;_r=0|work=The New York Times|accessdate=11 April 2013|date=20 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=KAKUTANI|first=MICHIKO|title=Critic's Notebook; Kill!

Though a production not promoted by secondary criticism it is popular literature that holds the largest market share.{{clarify|date=September 2018}} Romance fiction had an estimated $1.375 billion share in the US book market in 2007. Religion/inspirational literature followed with $819 million, science fiction/fantasy with $700 million, mystery with $650 million and then classic literary fiction with $466 million.&lt;ref&gt;See the page [http://www.rwanational.org/cs/the_romance_genre/romance_literature_statistics Romance Literature Statistics: Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223085813/http://www.rwanational.org/cs/the_romance_genre/romance_literature_statistics |date=2007-12-23 }} (visited March 16, 2009) of ''[http://www.rwanational.org/cs/home Romance Writers of America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203140439/http://www.rwanational.org/cs/home |date=2010-12-03 }}'' homepage.

==History of genres==
{{See also|History of fantasy|History of science fiction}}
[[Genre]] began as an absolute classification system for [[ancient Greek literature]]. [[Poetry]], [[prose]], and [[drama]] each had a specific and calculated style that related to the theme of the story.  Among the genres were the [[epic (genre)|epic]] in poetry and [[tragedy]] and [[comedy]] for plays.&lt;ref&gt;Hadas, Moses (1950). ''A History of Greek Literature''. New York, NY: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In later periods other genres such as the [[chivalric romance]], [[opera]], and [[prose fiction]] developed.

Though the [[novel]] is often seen as a modern genre, [[Ian Watt]], in ''The Rise of the Novel'' (1957) suggests that the novel first came into being in the early 18th century,&lt;ref name=Obituary&gt;{{cite web|title=Literary critic Ian Watt dies after a long illness|url=http://news.stanford.edu/pr/99/991217watt.html|website=Stanford News Service|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has also been described as possessing "a continuous and comprehensive history of about two thousand years", from the time of both [[Classical Greece]] and [[Classical Rome|Rome]].&lt;ref name="The True Story of the Novel"&gt;Margaret Anne Doody, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BBYU6jyA3MUC&amp;pg=PA1 ''The True Story of the Novel'']. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1996, rept. 1997, p. 1. Retrieved 25 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "romance" is a closely related long prose narrative. [[Walter Scott]] defined it as "a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents", whereas in the novel "the events are accommodated to the ordinary train of human events and the modern state of society".&lt;ref&gt;"Essay on Romance", ''Prose Works'' volume vi, p.129, quoted in "Introduction" to Walter Scott's ''Quentin Durward'', ed. Susan Maning. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992, p.xxv.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many romances, including the [[Historical novel|historical romance]]s of Scott,&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction" to Walter Scott's ''Quentin Durward'', ed. Susan Maning, pp.xxv-xxvii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]''&lt;ref name="Moers, Ellen 1978"&gt;Moers, Ellen. ''Literary Women: The Great Writers''[1976] (London: The Women’s Press, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick] Robert McCrum, "The Hundred best novels: Moby Dick", ''The Observer'', Sunday 12 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; are also frequently called novels, and Scott describes romance as a "kindred term". Romance, as defined here, should not be confused with the genre fiction love romance or [[romance novel]]. Other European languages do not distinguish between romance and novel: "a novel is ''le roman'', ''der Roman'', ''il romanzo''."&lt;ref name="Doody 1996, p. 15"&gt;Doody (1996), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Genre fiction developed from various subgenres of the novel (and its "romance" version) during the nineteenth century, along with the growth of the [[mass-marketing]] of fiction in the twentieth century: this includes the [[gothic novel]], [[fantasy]], [[science fiction]], [[adventure novel]], [[historical romance]], and the [[detective novel]]. Some scholars see precursors to the genre fiction [[romance novel]]s in [[literary fiction]] of the 18th and 19th centuries, including [[Samuel Richardson]]'s [[sentimental novel]] ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded]]'' (1740) and the novels of [[Jane Austen]] such as ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1813).&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Regis, ''A Natural History of the Romance Novel'', University of Pennsylvania Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The genres==
{{mainlist|List of literary genres}}
The following are some of the main genres as they are used in contemporary publishing:

===Crime===
{{Main article|Crime fiction|Detective fiction}}
Crime fiction is the [[literary genre]] that fictionalises [[crime]]s, their detection, criminals, and their [[Motive (law)|motives]]. It is usually distinguished from [[Literary fiction|mainstream]] fiction and other genres such as [[historical fiction]] or [[science fiction]], but the boundaries are indistinct. Crime fiction has multiple [[subgenres]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=990082541924074;res=IELAPA|title = May I Suggest Murder?: An Overview of Crime Fiction for Readers' Advisory Services Staff|last = Franks|first = Rachel|date = 2011|journal = Australian Library Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 18 January 2016|volume = 60|issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[detective fiction]] (such as the [[whodunit]]), [[courtroom drama]], [[hardboiled|hard-boiled]] fiction, [[mystery fiction]], and [[legal thriller]]s. [[Suspense]] and mystery are key elements to the genre.

===Fantasy===
{{Main article|Fantasy|History of fantasy|Fantasy literature}}
[[Fantasy]] is a [[genre]] of [[fiction]] that uses [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] or other [[supernatural]] elements as a main [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] element, [[Theme (literature)|theme]], or [[Setting (fiction)|setting]]. Many works within the genre take place in [[imaginary world]]s where magic and [[Legendary creature|magical creatures]] are common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of [[science fiction]] and [[horror fiction|horror]] by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap among the three, all of which are subgenres of [[speculative fiction]]. In [[popular culture]], the fantasy genre predominantly features a [[Medievalism|medieval]]-type setting.

===Romance===
{{Main article|Romance novel}}
The [[romance novel]] or "romantic novel" primarily focuses on the relationship and [[Romance (love)|romantic love]] between two&amp;nbsp;people, and must have an "emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending."&lt;ref name="rwadefn"&gt;{{cite web   | title = The Romance Genre Overview | publisher = [[Romance Writers of America]]  | url =http://www.rwa.org/p/cm/ld/fid=578  | accessdate = November 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many subgenres of the romance novel including [[fantasy]], [[Historical romance|historical]], [[science fiction]], same sex romantic fiction, and [[paranormal fiction]].

There is a [[literary fiction]] form of romance, which [[Walter Scott]] defined as "a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents".&lt;ref&gt;Walter Scott, "Essay on Romance", ''Prose Works'' volume vi, p. 129, quoted in "Introduction" to Walter Scott's ''Quentin Durward'', Susan Maning, ed Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Romance Writers of America''{{'s}} data,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rwa.org/p/cm/ld/fid=582 Romance Writers of America]&lt;/ref&gt; the most important subgenres are: [[Category romance|Contemporary series romance]], [[Contemporary romance]], [[Historical romance]], [[Paranormal romance]], [[Romantic suspense]], [[Inspirational fiction|Inspirational romance]], Romantic suspense (series).
*Other: [[chick-lit]], [[erotic romance novels|erotic romance]], [[women's fiction]], [[Young Adult Romance Literature|Young adult romance]].

===Science fiction===
{{Main article|Science fiction}}
Science fiction is a [[genre]] of [[speculative fiction]] dealing with [[imagination|imaginative]] concepts such as [[future|futuristic]] [[science]] and [[technology]], [[spaceflight|space travel]], [[Time travel in fiction|time travel]], [[faster than light travel]], [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]] and [[extraterrestrial life]]. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other [[innovation]]s, and has been called a "literature of ideas".&lt;ref name="Science Fiction: The Literature of Ideas"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Marg Gilks |author2=Paula Fleming |author3=Moira Allen | title = Science Fiction: The Literature of Ideas | work = | publisher =WritingWorld.com | year =2003 | url = http://www.writing-world.com/sf/sf.shtml | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It usually eschews the [[supernatural]], and unlike the related genre of [[fantasy]], historically science fiction stories were intended to have at least pretense of [[science|science-based fact or theory]] at the time the story was created, but this connection has become tenuous or non-existent in much of science fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loa.org/sciencefiction/introduction.jsp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 8, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506221319/http://www.loa.org/sciencefiction/introduction.jsp |archivedate=May 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/jenkins_mi.html |title=Media and Imagination: A Short History of American Science Fiction |publisher=Web.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Misa |url=http://misabuckley.com/does-the-science-in-science-fiction-matter/ |title=Does the Science in Science Fiction Matter? |publisher=Misa Buckley |date=2013-03-25 |accessdate=2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western===
{{Main article|Western fiction}}
Western fiction is defined primarily by being set in the [[Western United States|American West]] in the second half of the 19th century and, secondarily, by featuring heroes who are rugged, individualistic horsemen ([[cowboy]]s). Other genres, such as romance, have subgenres that make use of the Western setting.

===Inspirational===
{{Main article|Inspirational fiction}}
Inspirational fiction is fictional works with faith-based themes.  It may be targeted at a specific demographic, such as Christians.  Modern inspirational fiction has grown to encompass non-traditional subgenres, such as inspirational thrillers.

===Horror===
{{Main article|Horror fiction}}
[[Horror fiction]] aims to frighten or disgust its readers.  Although many horror novels feature supernatural phenomena or monsters, it is not required.  Early horror took much inspiration from [[Romanticism]] and [[Gothic fiction]].  Modern horror, such as [[cosmic horror]] and [[splatterpunk]], tends to be less melodramatic and more explicit.  Horror is often mixed with other genres.

==Critical appraisal and controversy==
Although frequently ignored or ridiculed by literary critics, genre fiction has achieved a measure of acceptance among some modern critics, with [[Stephen King]] being awarded the [[National Book Award|Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters]];&lt;ref name=natbook&gt;[http://www.nationalbook.org/amerletters.html "Distinguished Contribution to American Letters "], National Book Foundation, Retrieved March 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; but this polarized opinions and led to debate on genre fiction's literary merit.  Negative comments about genre fiction have sparked responses from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'',&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news|last=Grossman|first=Lev|title=Literary Revolution in the Supermarket Aisle: Genre Fiction Is Disruptive Technology|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/05/23/genre-fiction-is-disruptive-technology/|work=Time|accessdate=11 April 2013|date=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nelson|first=Erik|title=Stephen King: You can be popular and good|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/07/06/stephen_king_you_can_be_popular_and_good/|work=Salon|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[the Atlantic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jacobs|first=Alan|title=A Defense of Stephen King, Master of the Decisive Moment|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/07/a-defense-of-stephen-king-master-of-the-decisive-moment/260187/|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Los Angeles Review of Books]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dickey |first=Colin |title=King &amp; I: Stephen King and a Balanced Diet |url=http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?type=&amp;id=784&amp;fulltext=1&amp;media= |work=Los Angeles Review of Books |accessdate=11 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414150715/http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?type=&amp;id=784&amp;fulltext=1&amp;media= |archivedate=14 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobel laureate [[Doris Lessing]] described science fiction as "some of the best [[social fiction]] of our time", and called [[Greg Bear]], author of ''[[Blood Music (novel)|Blood Music]]'', "a great writer". &lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.dorislessing.org/boston.html Doris Lessing: Hot Dawns]'', interview by Harvey Blume in ''Boston Book Review''&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of major literary figures have written works of genre fiction. [[Graham Greene]] at the time of his death in 1991 had a reputation as a writer of both deeply serious novels on the theme of Catholicism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/oct/03/biography.grahamgreene|title=More Sherry trifles|author=Ian Thomson|publisher=

Steensma|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|date= 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s, the [[BBC]] defended itself against charges that it had sneered at genre fiction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Flood|first=Alison|title=BBC denies 'sneering' at genre fiction|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/21/bbc-genre-fiction?INTCMP=SRCH|work=The Guardian|accessdate=11 April 2013|location=London|date=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Man Booker]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Flood|first=Alison|title=Science fiction author hits out at Booker judges|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/sep/18/science-fiction-booker-prize|work=The Guardian|accessdate=11 April 2013|location=London|date=18 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[National Book Awards]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Laura|title=National Book Awards: Genre fiction dissed again|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/10/11/national_book_awards_genre_fiction_dissed_again/|work=Salon|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been criticized for ignoring genre fiction in their selection process. 

Some critics have claimed that reading romance and suspense thrillers makes readers more sensitive, because these novels focus on interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Fong, K., Mullin, J.B., &amp; Mar, R.A. (2013). "What you read matters: The role of fiction genre in prediction interpersonal sensitivity". ''Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, And The Arts'', 7(4), 370-376.&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th-century British and Irish genre fiction==

{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}

[[Sir John Barrow]]'s descriptive [[The Eventful History of the Mutiny and Piratical Seizure of HMS Bounty|1831 account]] of the [[Mutiny on the Bounty]] immortalised the Royal Navy ship {{HMS|Bounty}} and her people. The legend of [[Dick Turpin]] was popularised when the 18th-century English [[highwayman]]'s exploits appeared in the novel ''[[Rookwood (novel)|Rookwood]]'' in 1834.

Although pre-dated by [[John Ruskin]]'s ''[[The King of the Golden River]]'' in 1841, the history of the modern [[fantasy literature|fantasy]] genre is generally said to begin with [[George MacDonald]], the influential author of ''[[The Princess and the Goblin]]'' and ''[[Phantastes]]'' (1858). [[William Morris]] was a popular English poet who also wrote several fantasy novels during the latter part of the nineteenth century. [[Wilkie Collins]]' [[epistolary novel]] ''[[The Moonstone]]'' (1868), is generally considered the first [[Detective fiction|detective novel]] in the English language, while ''[[The Woman in White (novel)|The Woman in White]]'' is regarded as one of the finest [[sensation novels]]. [[H. G. Wells]]'s (1866–1946) writing career began in the 1890s with science fiction novels like ''[[The Time Machine]]'' (1895), and ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' (1898) which describes an invasion of late Victorian England by [[Martian]]s, and Wells is seen, along with Frenchman [[Jules Verne]] (1828–1905), as a major figure in the development of the science fiction genre. He also wrote realistic fiction about the lower middle class in novels like ''[[Kipps]]'' (1905) and ''[[The History of Mr Polly]]'' (1910).

[[Penny dreadful]] publications were an alternative to mainstream works, and were aimed at working class adolescents, introducing the infamous [[Sweeney Todd]]. The premier [[ghost story]] writer of the 19th century was the Irish writer [[Sheridan Le Fanu]]. His works include the macabre mystery novel ''[[Uncle Silas]]'' 1865, and his Gothic novella ''[[Carmilla]]'' 1872, tells the story of a young woman's susceptibility to the attentions of a female vampire. The [[vampire literature|vampire genre]] fiction began with [[John William Polidori]]'s "[[The Vampyre]]" (1819). This short story was inspired by the life of [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] and his poem ''[[The Giaour]]''. An important later work is ''[[Varney the Vampire]]'' (1845), where many standard vampire conventions originated: Varney has fangs, leaves two puncture wounds on the neck of his victims, and has hypnotic powers and superhuman strength. Varney was also the first example of the "sympathetic vampire", who loathes his condition but is a slave to it.&lt;ref&gt;Skal, David J. (1996). ''V is for Vampire'', p.99. New York: Plume. {{ISBN|0-452-27173-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bram Stoker]], yet another Irish writer, was the author of seminal horror work ''[[Dracula]]'' and featured as its primary antagonist the vampire [[Count Dracula]], with the [[vampire hunter]] [[Abraham Van Helsing]] his arch-enemy. ''Dracula'' has been attributed to a number of [[literary genre]]s including [[vampire literature]], [[horror fiction]], [[gothic novel]] and [[invasion literature]].

[[Image:PortraitOfACD.JPG|thumb|165px|[[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] was born in Scotland of Irish parents but his [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories have typified a fog-filled London for readers worldwide]]
[[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s [[Sherlock Holmes]] is a brilliant London-based "consulting detective", famous for his intellectual prowess, skilful use of astute observation, deductive reasoning and forensic skills to solve difficult cases. Holmes' [[archenemy]] [[Professor Moriarty]], is widely considered to be the first true example of a [[supervillain]], while Sherlock Holmes has become a by-word for a detective. Conan Doyle wrote four novels and fifty-six short stories featuring Holmes, from 1880 up to 1907, with a final case in 1914. All but four Conan Doyle stories are narrated by Holmes' friend, assistant, and biographer, [[John Watson (Sherlock Holmes)|Dr John H. Watson]].

The [[Lost World (genre)|Lost World]] literary genre was inspired by real stories of archaeological discoveries by imperial adventurers. [[H. Rider Haggard]] wrote one of the earliest examples, ''[[King Solomon's Mines]]'' in 1885. Contemporary European politics and diplomatic manoeuvrings informed [[Anthony Hope]]'s swashbuckling [[Ruritanian romance|Ruritanian adventure novels]] ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda]]'' 1894, and ''[[Rupert of Hentzau]]'', 1898.

[[F. Anstey]]'s [[comic novel]] ''[[Vice Versa (book)|Vice Versa]]'' 1882, sees a father and son magically switch bodies. Satirist [[Jerome K. Jerome]]'s ''[[Three Men in a Boat]]'' 1889, is a humorous account of a boating holiday on the river [[Thames]]. Grossmith brothers [[George Grossmith|George]] &amp; [[Weedon Grossmith|Weedon]]'s ''[[Diary of a Nobody]]'' 1892, is also considered a classic work of humour.

==20th-century genre fiction==

===Early 20-century===
[[Erskine Childers (author)|Erskine Childers]]' ''[[The Riddle of the Sands]]'' (1903), defined the [[spy novel]] and Follett has also called it "the first modern [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]]".&lt;ref name=follett&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ken-follett.com/suspense/index.html |title=The Art of Suspense |first=Ken |last=Follett |work=ken-follett.com |year=2016 |accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emma Orczy]]'s ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]'' (1903) was originally a highly successful play, when staged in London in 1905. The novel ''The Scarlet Pimpernel'' was published soon after the play opened and was an immediate success. Orczy gained a following of readers in Britain and throughout the world. The popularity of the novel, which recounted the adventures of a member of the English gentry in the [[French Revolution]]ary period, encouraged her to write a number of sequels for her "reckless daredevil" over the next 35 years. The play was performed to great acclaim in France, Italy, Germany and Spain, while the novel was translated into 16 languages. Subsequently, the story has been adapted for television, film, a [[The Scarlet Pimpernel (musical)|musical]] and other media. Baroness Orczy's character ''[[The Old Man in the Corner]]'' (1908) was among the earliest [[armchair detective]]s to be created. Her short stories about ''[[Lady Molly of Scotland Yard]]'' (1910) were an early example of a female detective as main character.

[[John Buchan]] wrote the [[adventure novel]]s on ''[[Prester John (novel)|Prester John]]'' (1910) and four novels telling the adventures of [[Richard Hannay]], of which the first, ''[[The Thirty-Nine Steps]]'' (1915) is the best known. Novels featuring a gentleman adventurer were popular in the [[interwar period]], exemplified by the series of [[H. C. McNeile]] with ''[[Bulldog Drummond]]'' (1920), and [[Leslie Charteris]], whose many books chronicled the adventures of [[Simon Templar]], alias ''[[Simon Templar#Publishing history|The Saint]]''.

[[Image:Agatha Christie.png|upright=0.7|thumb|[[Agatha Christie]]]]

The [[medievalist]] scholar [[M. R. James]] wrote highly regarded ghost stories (1904–1928) in contemporary settings.

This was called the [[Golden Age of Detective Fiction]]. [[Agatha Christie]], a writer of crime novels, short stories and plays, is best remembered for her 80 detective novels and her successful West End theatre plays. Christie's works, particularly those featuring the detectives [[Hercule Poirot]] or [[Miss Marple]], made her one of the most important and innovative writers in the development of the genre. Her most influential novels include ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'' (1926); one of her most controversial novels, its innovative [[twist ending]] had a significant impact on the genre), ''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'' (1934), ''[[Death on the Nile]]'' (1937) and ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' (1939). Other female writers dubbed "Queens of crime" include [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] ([[gentleman detective]], [[Lord Peter Wimsey]]), [[Margery Allingham]] ([[Albert Campion]], supposedly created as a parody of Sayers' Wimsey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strandmag.com/campion.htm|title=The Great Detectives: Albert Campion|work=Strand Mag}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and New Zealander [[Ngaio Marsh]] ([[Roderick Alleyn]]). [[Georgette Heyer]] recreated the [[historical romance]] genre since 1921, and also wrote detective fiction (1932–1953).

[[Image:Tolkien 1916.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]]]

A major work of science fiction, from the early 20th century, is ''[[A Voyage to Arcturus]]'' by Scottish writer [[David Lindsay (novelist)|David Lindsay]], first published in 1920. It combines [[fantasy]], philosophy, and science fiction in an exploration of the nature of good and evil and their relationship with existence. It has been described by critic and philosopher [[Colin Wilson]] as the "greatest novel of the twentieth century",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scifidimensions.com/Nov03/arcturus.htm Book Review: A Voyage to Arcturus (1920) by David Lindsay] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215000000/http://www.scifidimensions.com/Nov03/arcturus.htm |date=December 15, 2014 }} – Review by Paul M. Kieniewicz 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and was a central influence on [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[Space Trilogy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Lindskoog – [http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=882 „A Voyage to Arcturus, C. S. Lewis, and The Dark Tower“].&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] said he read the book "with avidity", and praised it as a work of philosophy, religion, and morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebookladysblog.com/2011/08/17/the-top-ten-books-that-influenced-j-r-r-tolkien/|title=thebookladysblog.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was made widely available in paperback form when published as one of the precursor volumes to the [[Ballantine Adult Fantasy series]] in 1968.

From the early 1930s to late 1940s, an informal [[literary]] discussion group associated with the English faculty at the University of Oxford, were the "[[Inklings]]". Its leading members were the major [[high fantasy|fantasy]] novelists; [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. Lewis is known for ''[[The Screwtape Letters]]'' (1942), ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' (1950–1956) and ''[[The Space Trilogy]]'' (1938–1945), while Tolkien is best known as the author of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' (1937), ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (1954–1955), and ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' (1977).

===Later 20th-century===
In [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] writing, [[Ian Fleming]] created the character [[James Bond 007]] in January 1952, while on holiday at his Jamaican estate, Goldeneye.

[[Patrick O'Brian]]'s [[sea story|nautical]] historical novels feature the ''[[Aubrey–Maturin series]]'' set in the [[Royal Navy]], the first being ''[[Master and Commander]]'' (1969).

The "father of [[Wicca]]", [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], began propagating his own version of [[witchcraft]] in the 1950s. Having claimed to have been initiated into the [[New Forest coven]] in 1939, Gardner published his books ''[[Witchcraft Today]]'' (1954) and ''[[The Meaning of Witchcraft]]'' (1959), the foundational texts for the religion of Wicca. [[Ronald Welch]]'s [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] winning novel ''[[Knight Crusader]]'' is set in the 12th century and gives a depiction of the [[Third Crusade]], featuring the Christian leader and King of England [[Richard the Lionheart]].

In crime fiction, the [[murder mystery|murder mysteries]] of [[Ruth Rendell]] and [[P. D. James]] are popular.

[[Nigel Tranter]] wrote historical novels of celebrated Scottish warriors; [[Robert the Bruce]] in ''[[Historical novels by Nigel Tranter set between 1286 and 1603#Robert the Bruce trilogy|The Bruce Trilogy]]'', and [[William Wallace]] in ''[[Historical novels by Nigel Tranter set between 1286 and 1603#The Wallace|The Wallace]]'' (1975), works noted by academics for their accuracy.

'''Harry Underwood''' (1969) is a painter known for his use of stenciled images and literary elements atop wood panels. His pictures are painted with house paints and written upon with ordinary No. 2 pencils. His subjects are an eclectic mix of realism, surrealism, pop art and invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parr-Moody |first1=Karen |title=Reveries of a Complicated Sign Painter |url=https://nashvillearts.com/2010/12/harry-underwood/ |website=Nashville Arts Magazine |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harry has been labelled an [[outsider artist]], a pop artist, and a folk artist. However, unlike most folk artists, his paintings are carefully planned often taking months prior to their execution. One critic said of the detailed planning that goes into Harry's work that "what results is more a cocktail of realism, surrealism, and pop, of [[Edward Hopper]] meets [[Salvador Dali]] meets [[Andy Warhol]]."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parr-Moody |first1=Karen |title=Reveries of a Complicated Sign Painter |url=https://nashvillearts.com/2010/12/harry-underwood/ |website=Nashville Arts Magazine |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is popularly known by his first name "Harry", and distinctively signs his paintings with this moniker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nolan |first1=Joe |title=Harry Underwood at Estel Gallery |url=https://www.nashvillescene.com/arts-culture/article/13017001/harry-underwood-at-estel-gallery |website=Nashville Scene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Harry Underwood was born in 1969 in Miami, FL. His father was a carpenter and his mother worked in a supermarket. His family was deeply religious and he attended the Church of God pentecostal church with them until 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Harry Underwood |url=http://www.harryunderwood.com/about.html |website=HarryUnderwood.com |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teenager, Harry cleaned pools at motels and bussed tables at the Capri Italian Restaurant in Florida City, FL. He was uprooted by [[Hurricane Andrew]] in 1992 and spent time in Austin, TX and New Orleans, LA before settling in Nashville, TN where he found work in the construction industry. He began painting in the early 2000s while working as a flooring installer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Harry Underwood |url=http://www.harryunderwood.com/about.html |website=HarryUnderwood.com |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harry's work is infused with romanticism and an undercurrent of nostalgia for a life not necessarily experienced, but wished for. Repeated images flesh out his work; bathing beauties, motel pools, vintage cars, commercial signs, palm trees, old bicycles, and dancing couples. There is a sense of mid-twentieth century Americana in his works which evokes nostalgia or longing for the vacation one never got to take, or the life one might have lived in the past, with touches of irony and commercialization that relate to the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Harry Underwood |url=https://www.justfolk.com/product-category/outsider-art/underwood/ |website=Just Folk |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Harry first started painting in the early 2000s while working as a flooring installer and house painter in Nashville, TN. He discovered his color palette while going through half-used paint cans in the garage of a house at which he was working.

His first major solo show was titled "A Pictorial History of Wishful Thinking" and hosted by the Estel Gallery in Nashville, TN in 2007. Since then, his work has been exhibited at numerous leading galleries and institutions across the United States, United Kingdom, and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Harry Underwood |url=http://www.harryunderwood.com/about.html |website=HarryUnderwood.com |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response to "Outsider Artist" Label ==

Though labeled an outsider artist, Harry avoids the term. When asked about it once by a University of North Carolina (Wilmington) researcher, he answered "I don’t think of that label as having anything to do with my vision or how I approach work each day. I don’t consider myself part of a movement. I wasn’t aware of artists like Darger or Edward Hopper until I was meeting people at my shows and they began telling me I reminded them of all that. Persistence is what making art is about. The world is designed to wreck your imagination. I don’t expect I’ll be tied to folk art forever. It wouldn’t be bad if I was. A friend recently called it “Americana,” and I kind of like that." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Louise Smith |first1=Emily |title=A Conversation with Harry Underwood |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/464134/pdf |website=John Hopkins University |publisher=University of North Carolina, Wilmington |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==
* Invade the Wild Kingdom
* Location is Not Essential
* Fine Weather From A Friendly Place
* Landmark Preservation - Measuring 4' x 6', Landmark Preservation is one of Harry Underwood's largest works. It is on long-term display at the [[Belcourt Theatre]] in Nashville, TN. The painting is a commentary on the uncertainty created when rapidly developing cities start to demolish historical buildings in order to make room for new construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nashvillearts.com/2016/01/landmark-preservation-new-painting-opinion-nashville-artist-harry-underwood/ |website=Nashville Arts Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kinetic art''' is [[art]] from any medium that contains movement perceivable by the viewer or depends on motion for its effect. Canvas [[Painting|paintings]] that extend the viewer's perspective of the artwork and incorporate multidimensional movement are the earliest examples of kinetic art.&lt;ref name="Popper"&gt;{{cite book |first=Frank |last=Popper |title=The Origins and Development of Kinetic Art |publisher= |year= |ISBN= }}&lt;/ref&gt; More pertinently speaking, kinetic art is a term that today most often refers to three-dimensional [[sculpture]]s and figures such as [[Mobile (sculpture)|mobiles]] that move naturally or are machine operated (see e. g. videos on this page of works of [[George Rickey]], [[Uli Aschenborn]] and [[Sarnikoff]]). The moving parts are generally powered by wind, a motor &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mdpi.com/2076-0752/7/2/21|author=Liliane Lijn|date=11 June 2018|title=Accepting the Machine: A Response by Liliane Lijn to Three Questions from Arts|publisher=Arts|accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the observer.  Kinetic art encompasses a wide variety of overlapping techniques and styles.

There is also a portion of kinetic art that includes virtual movement, or rather movement perceived from only certain angles or sections of the work. This term also clashes frequently with the term "apparent movement", which many people use when referring to an artwork whose movement is created by motors, machines, or electrically powered systems. Both apparent and virtual movement are styles of kinetic art that only recently have been argued as styles of [[op art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford Art Online: Kinetic Art |last= |first= |publisher= |year= |ISBN= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of overlap between kinetic and [[op art]] is not significant enough for artists and art historians to consider merging the two styles under one umbrella term, but there are distinctions that have yet to be made.

"Kinetic art" as a moniker developed from a number of sources. Kinetic art has its origins in the late 19th century [[Impressionism|impressionist]] artists such as [[Claude Monet]], [[Edgar Degas]], and [[Édouard Manet]] who originally experimented with accentuating the movement of human figures on canvas. This triumvirate of [[Impressionism|impressionist]] painters all sought to create art that was more lifelike than their contemporaries. Degas’ dancer and racehorse portraits are examples of what he believed to be "photographic [[Realism (arts)|realism]]";&lt;ref name="Oxford Art Online"&gt;{{cite book |first= |last= |title=Oxford Art Online: Kinetic Art in America |publisher= |year= |ISBN= }}&lt;/ref&gt; artists such as Degas in the late 19th century felt the need to challenge the movement toward [[photography]] with vivid, cadenced [[Landscape|landscapes]] and [[Portrait|portraits]].

By the early 1900s, certain artists grew closer and closer to ascribing their art to dynamic motion.  [[Naum Gabo]], one of the two artists attributed to naming this style, wrote frequently about his work as examples of "kinetic rhythm".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Kinetics |first=Frank |last=Popper |publisher= |year= |ISBN= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He felt that his moving sculpture ''Kinetic Construction'' (also dubbed ''Standing Wave'', 1919–20)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Kinetic Art |first=Guy |last=Brett |publisher= |year= |ISBN= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first of its kind in the 20th century. From the 1920s until the 1960s, the style of kinetic art was reshaped by a number of other artists who experimented with mobiles and new forms of sculpture.

== Origins and early development ==
The strides made by artists to "lift the figures and scenery off the page and prove undeniably that art is not rigid" ([[Alexander Calder|Calder]], 1954)&lt;ref name="Oxford Art Online" /&gt; took significant innovations and changes in compositional style. Édouard Manet, Edgar Degas, and Claude Monet were the three artists of the 19th century that initiated those changes in the [[Impressionism|Impressionist movement]]. Even though they each took unique approaches to incorporating movement in their works, they did so with the intention of being a realist. In the same period, Auguste Rodin was an artist whose early works spoke in support of the developing kinetic movement in art. However, [[Auguste Rodin]]'s later criticisms of the movement indirectly challenged the abilities of Manet, Degas, and Monet, claiming that it is impossible to exactly capture a moment in time and give it the vitality that is seen in real life.

=== Édouard Manet ===
[[File:Edouard Manet The Spanish Ballet.jpg|thumb|right|[[Édouard Manet]], ''Le Ballet Espagnol'' (1862).]]
It is almost impossible to ascribe Manet's work to any one era or style of art. One of his works that is truly on the brink of a new style is ''Le Ballet Espagnol'' (1862).&lt;ref name="Popper" /&gt; The figures' contours coincide with their gestures as a way to suggest depth in relation to one another and in relation to the setting. Manet also accentuates the lack of equilibrium in this work to project to the viewer that he or she is on the edge of a moment that is seconds away from passing. The blurred, hazy sense of color and shadow in this work similarly place the viewer in a fleeting moment.

In 1863, Manet extended his study of movement on flat canvas with ''[[Le déjeuner sur l'herbe]]''. The light, color, and composition are the same, but he adds a new structure to the background figures. The woman bending in the background is not completely scaled as if she were far away from the figures in the foreground. The lack of spacing is Manet's method of creating snapshot, near-invasive movement similar to his blurring of the foreground objects in ''Le Ballet Espagnol''.

=== Edgar Degas ===
[[File:Edgar Degas - At the Races.jpg|thumb|left|''At the Races'', 1877–1880, oil on canvas, by Edgar Degas, [[Musée d'Orsay]], Paris]]
[[File:Degas - Orchester in der Oper.jpg|thumb|right|[[Edgar Degas]], ''L'Orchestre de L'Opera'' (1868)]]
Edgar Degas is believed to be the intellectual extension of Manet, but more radical for the impressionist community. Degas' subjects are the epitome of the impressionist era; he finds great inspiration in images of ballet dancers and horse races. His "modern subjects" &lt;ref name="Kepes"&gt;{{cite book |first=Gyorgry |last=Kepes |title=The Nature and Art of Motion |publisher= |year= |ISBN= }}&lt;/ref&gt; never obscured his objective of creating moving art. In his 1860 piece ''Jeunes Spartiates s'exerçant à la lutte'', he capitalizes on the classic impressionist nudes but expands on the overall concept. He places them in a flat landscape and gives them dramatic gestures, and for him this pointed to a new theme of "youth in movement".&lt;ref name="Malina"&gt;{{cite book |first=Frank J. |last=Malina |title=Kinetic Art: Theory and Practice |publisher= |year= |ISBN= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his most revolutionary works, ''L’Orchestre de l’Opéra'' (1868) interprets forms of definite movement and gives them multidimensional movement beyond the flatness of the canvas. He positions the orchestra directly in the viewer’s space, while the dancers completely fill the background. Degas is alluding to the Impressionist style of combining movement, but almost redefines it in a way that was seldom seen in the late 1800s. In the 1870s, Degas continues this trend through his love of one shot motion horseraces in such works as ''Voiture aux Courses'' (1872).

It wasn’t until 1884 with ''Chevaux de Course'' that his attempt at creating dynamic art came to fruition. This work is part of a series of horse races and polo matches wherein the figures are well integrated into the landscape. The horses and their owners are depicted as if caught in a moment of intense deliberation, and then trotting away casually in other frames. The impressionist and overall artistic community were very impressed with this series, but were also shocked when they realized he based this series on actual photographs. Degas was not fazed by the criticisms of his integration of photography, and it actually inspired Monet to rely on similar technology.

=== Claude Monet ===
[[File:Claude Monet Le bateau atelier.jpg|thumb|right|[[Claude Monet]], ''Atelier sur Seine'' (1876)]]
Degas and Monet's style was very similar in one way: both of them based their artistic interpretation on a direct "retinal impression" &lt;ref name="Popper" /&gt; to create the feeling of variation and movement in their art. The subjects or images that were the foundation of their paintings came from an objective view of the world. As with Degas, many art historians consider that to be the subconscious effect photography had in that period of time. His 1860s works reflected many of the signs of movement that are visible in Degas' and Manet's work.

By 1875, Monet's touch becomes very swift in his new series, beginning with ''Le Bâteau-Atelier sur la Seine''. The landscape almost engulfs the whole canvas and has enough motion emanating from its inexact brushstrokes that the figures are a part of the motion. This painting along with ''Gare Saint-Lazare'' (1877-1878), proves to many art historians that Monet was redefining the style of the Impressionist era. Impressionism initially was defined by isolating color, light, and movement.&lt;ref name="Kepes" /&gt; In the late 1870s, Monet had pioneered a style that combined all three, while maintaining a focus on the popular subjects of the Impressionist era. Artists were often so struck by Monet's wispy brushstrokes that it was more than movement in his paintings, but a ''striking vibration''.&lt;ref name="Roukes"&gt;{{cite book |first=Nicholas |last=Roukes |title=Plastics for Kinetic Art|publisher= |year= |ISBN= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Auguste Rodin]]===
Auguste Rodin at first was very impressed by Monet's 'vibrating works' and Degas' unique understanding of spatial relationships. As an artist and an author of art reviews, Rodin published multiple works supporting this style. He claimed that Monet and Degas' work created the illusion "that art captures life through good modeling and movement".&lt;ref name="Roukes" /&gt; In 1881, when Rodin first sculpted and produced his own works of art, he rejected his earlier notions. Sculpting put Rodin into a predicament that he felt no philosopher nor anyone could ever solve; how can artists impart movement and dramatic motions from works so solid as sculptures? After this conundrum occurred to him, he published new articles that didn't attack men such as Manet, Monet, and Degas intentionally, but propagated his own theories that Impressionism is not about communicating movement but presenting it in static form.

== 20th century surrealism and early kinetic art ==
The [[Surrealism|surrealist style]] of the 20th century created an easy transition into the style of kinetic art. All artists now explored subject matter that would not have been socially acceptable to depict artistically. Artists went beyond solely painting landscapes or historical events, and felt the need to delve into the mundane and the extreme to interpret new styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Plastic Art |first=Carola |last=Giedion-Welcker |publisher= |year= |ISBN= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the support of artists such as [[Albert Gleizes]], other [[avant-garde]] artists such as [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Max Bill]] felt as if they had found new inspiration to discover oddities that became the focus of kinetic art.

=== Albert Gleizes ===
Gleizes was considered the ideal philosopher of the late 19th century and early 20th century arts in Europe, and more specifically France. His theories and treatises from 1912 on [[cubism]] gave him a renowned reputation in any artistic discussion. This reputation is what allowed him to act with considerable influence when supporting the plastic style or the rhythmic movement of art in the 1910s and 1920s. Gleizes published a theory on movement, which further articulated his theories on the psychological, artistic uses of movement in conjunction with the mentality that arises when considering movement. Gleizes asserted repeatedly in his publications that human creation implies the total renunciation of external sensation.&lt;ref name="Popper" /&gt; That to him is what made art mobile when to many, including Rodin, it was rigidly and unflinchingly immobile.

Gleizes first stressed the necessity for rhythm in art. To him, rhythm meant the visually pleasant coinciding of figures in a two-dimensional or three-dimensional space. Figures should be spaced mathematically, or systematically so that they appeared to interact with one another. Figures should also not have features that are too definite. They need to have shapes and compositions that are almost unclear, and from there the viewer can believe that the figures themselves are moving in that confined space. He wanted paintings, sculptures, and even the flat works of mid-19th-century artists to show how figures could impart on the viewer that there was great movement contained in a certain space. As a philosopher, Gleizes also studied the concept of artistic movement and how that appealed to the viewer. Gleizes updated his studies and publications through the 1930s, just as kinetic art was becoming popular.

=== Jackson Pollock ===
When [[Jackson Pollock]] created many of his famous works, the United States was already at the forefront of the kinetic art movement. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} The novel styles and methods he used to create his most famous pieces earned him the spot in the 1950s as the unchallenged leader of [[action painting|kinetic painters]], his work was associated with [[Action painting]] coined by [[art critic]] [[Harold Rosenberg]] in the 1950s. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Pollock had an unfettered desire to animate every aspect of his paintings. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Pollock repeatedly said to himself, "I am in every painting".&lt;ref name="Malina" /&gt; He used tools that most painters would never use, such as sticks, trowels, and knives. The shapes he created were what he thought was ''"beautiful, erratic objects"''.&lt;ref name="Malina" /&gt;

This style evolved into his drip technique. Pollock repeatedly took buckets of paint and paintbrushes and flicked them around until the canvas was covered with squiggly lines and jagged strokes. In the next phase of his work, Pollock tested his style with uncommon materials. He painted his first work with aluminum paint in 1947, titled ''Cathedral'' and from there he tried his first "splashes" to destroy the unity of the material itself. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} He believed wholeheartedly that he was liberating the materials and structure of art from their forced confinements, and that is how he arrived at the moving or kinetic art that always existed. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

{{clear}}

=== Max Bill ===
[[Max Bill]] became an almost complete disciple of the kinetic movement in the 1930s. He believed that kinetic art should be executed from a purely mathematical perspective. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} To him, using mathematics principles and understandings were one of the few ways that you could create objective movement. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} This theory applied to every artwork he created and how he created it. Bronze, marble, copper, and brass were four of the materials he used in his sculptures. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} He also enjoyed tricking the viewer’s eye when he or she first approached one of his sculptures. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} In his ''Construction with Suspended Cube'' (1935-1936) he created a mobile sculpture that generally appears to have perfect symmetry, but once the viewer glances at it from a different angle, there are aspects of asymmetry. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

== Mobiles and sculpture==
Max Bill’s sculptures were only the beginning of the style of movement that kinetic explored. Tatlin, Rodchenko, and Calder especially took the stationary sculptures of the early 20th century and gave them the slightest freedom of motion. These three artists began with testing unpredictable movement, and from there tried to control the movement of their figures with technological enhancements. The term "mobile" comes from the ability to modify how gravity and other atmospheric conditions affect the artist’s work.&lt;ref name="Kepes" /&gt;

Although there is very little distinction between the styles of mobiles in kinetic art, there is one distinction that can be made. Mobiles are no longer considered mobiles when the spectator has control over their movement. This is one of the features of virtual movement. When the piece only moves under certain circumstances that are not natural, or when the spectator controls the movement even slightly, the figure operates under virtual movement.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Kinetic art principles have also influenced [[mosaic]] art. For instance, kinetic-influenced mosaic pieces often use clear distinctions between bright and dark tiles, with three-dimensional shape, to create apparent shadows and movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Menhem|first1=Chantal|title=Kinetic Mosaics: The Art of Movement|url=http://blog.mozaico.com/kinetic-mosaics-the-art-of-movement/|website=Mozaico|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vladimir Tatlin ===
[[Vladimir Tatlin]] is considered by many artists and art historians {{who|date=March 2013}} to be the first person to ever complete a [[Mobile (sculpture)|mobile sculpture]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} The term mobile wasn't coined until Rodchenko's time, {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} but is very applicable to Tatlin's work. His mobile is a series of suspended reliefs that only need a wall or a pedestal, and it would forever stay suspended. This early mobile, ''Contre-Reliefs Libérés Dans L'espace'' (1915) is judged as an incomplete work. It was a rhythm, much similar to the rhythmic styles of Pollock, that relied on the mathematical interlocking of planes that created a work freely suspended in air. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Tatlin never felt that his art was an object or a product that needed a clear beginning or a clear end. He felt above anything that his work was an evolving process. Many artists whom he befriended considered the mobile truly complete in 1936, but he disagreed vehemently. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

=== Alexander Rodchenko ===
[[File:1915 Dance by Rodchenko.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Alexander Rodchenko ''Dance. An Objectless Composition'', 1915]]
[[Alexander Rodchenko]], one of Tatlin’s friends who insisted his work was complete, continued the study of suspended mobiles and created what he deemed to be "non-objectivism".&lt;ref name="Popper" /&gt; This style was a study less focused on mobiles than on canvas paintings and objects that were immoveable. It focuses on juxtaposing objects of different materials and textures as a way to spark new ideas in the mind of the viewer. By creating discontinuity with the work, the viewer assumed that the figure was moving off the canvas or the medium to which it was restricted. One of his canvas works titled ''Dance, an Objectless Composition'' (1915) embodies that desire to place items and shapes of different textures and materials together to create an image that drew in the viewer’s focus.

However, by the 1920s and 1930s, Rodchenko found a way to incorporate his theories of non-objectivism in mobile study. His 1920 piece ''Hanging Construction'' is a wood mobile that hangs from any ceiling by a string and rotates naturally. This mobile sculpture has concentric circles that exist in several planes, but the entire sculpture only rotates horizontally and vertically.

=== Alexander Calder ===
[[File:Calder-redmobile.jpg|thumb|300px|Alexander Calder, ''Red Mobile,'' 1956, Painted sheet metal and metal rods, a signature work - [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]]]]
[[Alexander Calder]] is an artist who many believe to have defined firmly and exactly the style of mobiles in kinetic art. Over years of studying his works, many critics allege that Calder was influenced by a wide variety of sources. Some claim that Chinese windbells were objects that closely resembled the shape and height of his earliest mobiles. Other art historians argue that the 1920s mobiles of [[Man Ray]], including ''Shade'' (1920) had a direct influence on the growth of Calder’s art.

When Calder first heard of these claims, he immediately admonished his critics. "I have never been and never will be a product of anything more than myself. My art is my own, why bother stating something about my art that isn’t true?"&lt;ref name="Malina" /&gt; One of Calder’s first mobiles, ''Mobile'' (1938) was the work that "proved" to many art historians that Man Ray had an obvious influence on Calder’s style. Both ''Shade'' and ''Mobile'' have a single string attached to a wall or a structure that keeps it in the air. The two works have a crinkled feature that vibrates when air passes through it.

Regardless of the obvious similarities, Calder’s style of mobiles created two types that are now referred to as the standard in kinetic art. There are object-mobiles and suspended mobiles. Object mobiles on supports come in a wide range of shapes and sizes, and can move in any way. Suspended mobiles were first made with colored glass and small wooden objects that hung on long threads. Object mobiles were a part of Calder’s emerging style of mobiles that were originally stationary sculptures.

It can be argued, based on their similar shape and stance, that Calder’s earliest object mobiles have very little to do with kinetic art or moving art. By the 1960s, most art critics believed that Calder had perfected the style of object mobiles in such creations as the ''Cat Mobile'' (1966).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Calder |first1=Ugo |last1=Mulas |first2=H. Harvard |last2=Arnason |others=with comments by Alexander Calder |publisher= |year= |ISBN= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this piece, Calder allows the cat’s head and its tail to be subject to random motion, but its body is stationary. Calder did not start the trend in suspended mobiles, but he was the artist that became recognized for his apparent originality in mobile construction.

One of his earliest suspended mobiles, ''McCausland Mobile'' (1933),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book 
  |title=Alexander Calder 
  |first=Joan M. |last=Marter 
  |authorlink=Joan Marter
  |publisher= 
  |year= 
  |isbn= 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; is different from many other contemporary mobiles simply because of the shapes of the two objects. Most mobile artists such as Rodchenko and Tatlin would never have thought to use such shapes because they didn’t seem malleable or even remotely aerodynamic.

Despite the fact that Calder did not divulge most of the methods he used when creating his work, he admitted that he used mathematical relationships to make them. He only said that he created a balanced mobile by using direct variation proportions of weight and distance. Calder’s formulas changed with every new mobile he made, so other artists could never precisely imitate the work.

== Virtual movement ==
By the 1940s, new styles of mobiles as well as many types of sculpture and paintings incorporated the control of the spectator. Artists such as Calder, Tatlin, and Rodchenko produced more art through the 1960s, but they were also competing against other artists who appealed to different audiences. When artists such as [[Victor Vasarely]] developed a number of the first features of virtual movement in their art, kinetic art faced heavy criticism. This criticism lingered for years until the 1960s, when kinetic art was in a dormant period.

=== Materials and electricity ===
Vasarely created many works that were considered to be interactive in the 1940s. One of his works ''Gordes/Cristal'' (1946) is a series of cubic figures that are also electrically powered. When he first showed these figures at fairs and art exhibitions, he invited people up to the cubic shapes to press the switch and start the color and light show. Virtual movement is a style of kinetic art that can be associated with mobiles, but from this style of movement there are two more specific distinctions of kinetic art.

== Apparent movement and op art ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=August 2017}}
Apparent movement is a term ascribed to kinetic art that evolved only in the 1950s. Art historians believed that any type of kinetic art that was mobile independent of the viewer has apparent movement. This style includes works that range from Pollock’s drip technique all the way to Tatlin’s first mobile. By the 1960s, other art historians developed the phrase "[[op art]]" to refer to optical illusions and all optically stimulating art that was on canvas or stationary. This phrase often clashes with certain aspects of kinetic art that include mobiles that are generally stationary.&lt;ref name="BRITTANICA"&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/Op-art Encyclopaedia Britannica - op art]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="POMPIDOU"&gt;[http://mediation.centrepompidou.fr/education/ressources/ENS-cinetisme/ENS-cinetique.html Centre Georges Pompidou, Kinetic Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, for the exhibition ''Mouvements'' at the [[Denise René]] gallery in Paris, Victor Vasarely and [[Pontus Hulten]] promoted in their "Yellow manifesto" some new kinetic expressions based on optical and luminous phenomenon as well as painting illusionism. The expression "kinetic art" in this modern form first appeared at the [[Museum für Gestaltung]] of [[Zürich]] in 1960, and found its major developments in the 1960s. In most European countries, it generally included the form of optical art that mainly makes use of [[optical illusion]]s, such as [[op art]], represented by [[Bridget Riley]], as well as art based on movement represented by [[Yacov Agam]], [[Carlos Cruz-Diez]], [[Jesús Rafael Soto]], [[Gregorio Vardanega]], or [[Nicolas Schöffer]]. From 1961 to 1968, [[Groupe de Recherche d’Art Visuel|GRAV]] (''Groupe de Recherche d’Art Visuel'') founded by [[François Morellet]],  [[Julio Le Parc]], [[Francisco Sobrino]], [[Horacio Garcia Rossi]], [[Yvaral]], [[Joël Stein]] and [[Vera Molnár]] was a collective group of opto-kinetic artists. According to its 1963 manifesto, GRAV appealed to the direct participation of the public with an influence on its behavior, notably through the use of interactive [[labyrinth]]s.

==Contemporary work==
In November 2013, the [[MIT Museum]] opened ''5000 Moving Parts'', an exhibition of kinetic art, featuring the work of [[Arthur Ganson]], [[Anne Lilly]], [[Rafael Lozano-Hemmer]], [[John Douglas Powers]], and [[Takis]].  The exhibition inaugurates a "year of kinetic art" at the Museum, featuring special programming related to the artform.&lt;ref name=5000MP&gt;{{cite web|title=5000 Moving Parts|url=http://web.mit.edu/museum/exhibitions/5000.html|work=MIT Museum|publisher=MIT Museum|accessdate=2013-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-kinetic{{clarify|date=August 2017}} art has been popular in China where you can find interactive kinetic sculptures in many public places, including Wuhu International Sculpture Park and in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gschwend|first1=Ralfonso|title=The Development of Public Art and its Future Passive, Active and Interactive Past, Present and Future|journal=Arts|date=22 July 2015|volume=4|issue=3|pages=93–100|doi=10.3390/arts4030093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Leaf v International Galleries''''' [1950] 2 KB 86 is an [[English contract law]] case concerning [[misrepresentation]], [[Mistake (contract law)|mistake]] and [[breach of contract]], and the limits to the [[equity (law)|equitable]] [[Equitable remedy|remedy]] of [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]].

==Facts==
"[[Salisbury Cathedral]]" by [[John Constable]] was what Ernest Louis Leaf thought he was buying on 8 March 1944 from International Galleries. International Galleries said it was a Constable. Leaf paid £85. Five years later when he tried to auction it, Leaf was told that it was not a Constable. He claimed rescission of the contract against International Galleries, to get back his money.

==Judgment==
[[Denning LJ]] held that Mr Leaf was barred because too much time had lapsed. He held that in the event of lapse of too much time between the making of the contract and the decision to rescind, the right to rescind is lost. He held there was a mistake about the quality of the subject matter because both parties believed the picture to be a Constable, and that mistake was fundamental. But it was not enough to void the contract, because there was no mistake about the essential subject matter (a painting). The painter's identity was a term of the contract, which could either be classified as a condition (breach of which allows termination of the contract) or a warranty (which allows damages only). Here the painter's identity was a condition, but after hanging it in one's house for five years it is far too late to reject the painting for breach of condition.

{{Cquote|The question is whether the plaintiff is entitled to rescind the contract on the ground that the painting in question was not painted by Constable. I emphasize that it is a claim to rescind only: there is no claim in this action for damages for breach of condition or breach of warranty. The claim is simply one for rescission. At a very late stage before the county court judge counsel did ask for leave to amend by claiming damages for breach of warranty, but it was not allowed. No claim for damages is before us at all. The only question is whether the plaintiff is entitled to rescind.

The way in which the case is put by Mr. Weitzman, on behalf of the plaintiff, is this: he says that this was an innocent misrepresentation and that in equity he is, or should be, entitled to claim rescission even of an executed contract of sale on that account. He points out that the judge has found that it is quite possible to restore the parties to their original position. It can be done by simply handing back the picture to the defendants.

In my opinion, this case is to be decided according to the well known principles applicable to the sale of goods. This was a contract for the sale of goods. There was a mistake about the quality of the subject-matter, because both parties believed the picture to be a Constable; and that mistake was in one sense essential or fundamental. But such a mistake does not avoid the contract: there was no mistake at all about the subject-matter of the sale. It was a specific picture, "Salisbury Cathedral." The parties were agreed in the same terms on the same subject-matter, and that is sufficient to make a contract: see ''[[Solle v Butcher]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1950] 1 K.B. 671&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Solle v Butcher]]'' has been [[Mechanisms of the English common law|disapproved]] in ''[[The Great Peace]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a term in the contract as to the quality of the subject-matter: namely, as to the person by whom the picture was painted – that it was by Constable. That term of the contract was, according to our terminology, either a condition or a warranty. If it was a condition, the buyer could reject the picture for breach of the condition at any time before he accepted it, or is deemed to have accepted it; whereas, if it was only a warranty, he could not reject it at all but was confined to a claim for damages.

I think it right to assume in the buyer's favour that this term was a condition, and that, if he had come in proper time he could have rejected the picture; but the right to reject for breach of condition has always been limited by the rule that, once the buyer has accepted, or is deemed to have accepted, the goods in performance of the contract, then he cannot thereafter reject, but is relegated to his claim for damages: see s. 11, sub-s. 1 (c), of the [[Sale of Goods Act 1893]], and ''[[Wallis, Son &amp; Wells v Pratt &amp; Haynes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1910] 2 K. B. 1003 , [1911] A. C. 394.&lt;/ref&gt;

The circumstances in which a buyer is deemed to have accepted goods in performance of the contract are set out in s. 35 of the Act, which says that the buyer is deemed to have accepted the goods, amongst other things, "when, after the lapse of a reasonable time, he retains the goods without intimating to the seller that he has rejected them." In this case the buyer took the picture into his house and, apparently, hung it there, and five years passed before he intimated any rejection at all. That, I need hardly say, is much more than a reasonable time. It is far too late for him at the end of five years to reject this picture for breach of any condition. His remedy after that length of time is for damages only, a claim which he has not brought before the court.

Is it to be said that the buyer is in any better position by relying on the representation, not as a condition, but as an innocent misrepresentation? I agree that on a contract for the sale of goods an innocent material misrepresentation may, in a proper case, be a ground for rescission even after the contract has been executed...

Although rescission may in some cases be a proper remedy, it is to be remembered that an innocent misrepresentation is much less potent than a breach of condition; and a claim to rescission for innocent misrepresentation must at any rate be barred when a right to reject for breach of condition is barred. A condition is a term of the contract of a most material character, and if a claim to reject on that account is barred, it seems to me a fortiori that a claim to rescission on the ground of innocent misrepresentation is also barred.}}

Jenkins LJ and Lord Evershed MR concurred.

* '''Summary'''
In essence, the court held that there was no breach of contract, no "operative mistake", but there WAS misrepresentation. However, after a period of five years the right to rescission had lapsed, leaving the claimant with no remedy at all.

'''Lineography''' is the [[art]] of drawing without lifting the pen, pencil, or paintbrush that is being used.&lt;ref name="Maloney"&gt;{{ citation | last = Davis | first = Ken | authorlink =  | title = Thinking Inside the Box | journal = Unitrin Specialty Update | volume =  | issue =  | date = 2007-01-02 | page = 10 | url = http://leannmaloney.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/unitrinspecialtyupdatev2_jan07.pdf }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mail art''' (also known as '''postal art''' and '''correspondence art''') is a populist artistic movement centered on sending small scale works through the [[mail|postal service]].  It initially developed out of what eventually became [[Ray Johnson]]'s New York Correspondence School in the 1950s and the [[Fluxus]] movement in the 1960s, though it has since developed into a global movement that continues to the present.

==Characteristics==

Media commonly used in mail art include postcards, paper, a collage of found or recycled images and objects, rubber stamps, artist-created stamps (called [[artistamps]]), and paint, but can also include music, sound art, poetry, or anything that can be put in an envelope and sent via post.  Mail art is considered art once it is dispatched.  Mail artists regularly call for thematic or topical mail art for use in (often [[unjuried]]) exhibition.&lt;ref name=MOCA /&gt;&lt;ref name=UB&gt;{{cite web|title=Mail Art|url=http://digital.lib.buffalo.edu/cdm/landingpage/collection/LIB-PC001|work=Digital Collections, UB Libraries|publisher=University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mail artists appreciate interconnection with other artists.  The artform promotes an egalitarian way of creating that frequently circumvents official art distribution and approval systems such as the art market, museums, and galleries.  Mail artists rely on their alternative "outsider" network as the primary way of sharing their work, rather than being dependent on the ability to locate and secure exhibition space.&lt;ref name=Oberlin&gt;{{cite web|title=Mail Art @ Oberlin|url=http://www.oberlin.edu/library/art/mailart/|work=Oberlin College Art Library|publisher=Oberlin College &amp; Conservatory|accessdate=11 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403130316/http://www.oberlin.edu/library/art/mailart/|archivedate=3 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KostelanetzBrittain2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Kostelanetz|author2=H. R. Brittain|title=A Dictionary of the Avant-gardes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NZX85xdr6boC|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-93764-1|page=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mail art can be seen as anticipating the cyber communities founded on the Internet.&lt;ref name=Spark /&gt;

==History==

[[File:RayJohnson invite1970.jpg|right|thumb|Ray Johnson's invitation to the first mail art show, 1970]]
Artist Edward M. Plunkett has argued that communication-as-art-form is an ancient tradition; he posits (tongue in cheek) that mail art began when Cleopatra had herself delivered to Julius Caesar in a rolled-up carpet.&lt;ref name=Plunkett&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plunkett|first=Edward M.|title=The New York Correspondence School|journal=Art Journal|year=1977|issue=Spring|url=http://www.artpool.hu/Ray/Publications/Plunkett.html|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ray Johnson, the New York Correspondance School, and Fluxus===
The American artist [[Ray Johnson]] is considered to be the first mail artist.&lt;ref name=MOCA&gt;{{cite web|title=Mail Art|url=http://www.moca.org/pc/viewArtTerm.php?id=22|work=Collection: MOCA's First Thirty Years|publisher=MOCA: The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Phillpot&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillpot|first=Clive|title=Eternal Network: A Mail Art Anthology|year=1995|publisher=University of Calgary Press|location=Canada|url=http://www.artpool.hu/Ray/Publications/Phillpot.html|editor=Chuck Welch|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Johnson's experiments with art in the mail began in 1943, while the posting of instructions and soliciting of activity from his recipients began in the mid-1950s with the mailing of his "moticos", and thus provided mail art with a blueprint for the free exchange of art via post.&lt;ref name=MOCA /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Vincitorio, "Informalista o videoartista? Le tendenze artistiche dagli anni '40 ad oggi", L'Espresso n.44, 7 November 1982{{full citation needed|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "mail art" was coined in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Plunkett /&gt; In 1962, Plunkett coined the term "New York Correspondence School" to refer to Johnson's activities; Johnson adopted this moniker but sometimes intentionally misspelled it as "correspondance."&lt;ref name=Plunkett /&gt; The deliberate misspelling was characteristic of the playful spirit of the Correspondance School and its actions.&lt;ref name=Danto&gt;{{cite journal|last=Danto|first=Arthur C.|journal=The Nation|date=March 29, 1999|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/correspondance-school-art#|title=Correspondance School Art|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Correspondance School members are fairly obscure, and the letters they sent, often featuring simple drawings or stickers, often instructed the recipient to perform some fairly simple action. Johnson's work consists primarily of letters, often with the addition of doodles and rubber stamped messages, which he mailed to friends and acquaintances. The Correspondance School was a network of individuals who were artists by virtue of their willingness to play along and appreciate Johnson's sense of humor.  One example of the activities of the Correspondance School consisted in calling meetings of fan clubs, such as one devoted to the actress [[Anna May Wong]].  Many of Johnson's missives to his network featured a hand drawn version of what became a personal logo or alter-ego, a bunny head.&lt;ref name=Danto /&gt;

In a 1968 interview, Johnson explained that he found mailed correspondence interesting because of the limits it puts on the usual back and forth interaction and negotiation that comprises communication between individuals.  Correspondence is  "a way to convey a message or a kind of idea to someone which is not verbal; it is not a confrontation of two people. It's an object which is opened in privacy, probably, and the message is looked at&amp;nbsp;... You look at the object and, depending on your degree of interest, it very directly gets across to you what is there&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name=AAAOH&gt;{{cite web|title=Oral history interview with Ray Johnson, 1968 Apr. 17|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-ray-johnson-13236|work=Archives of American Art|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Johnson and Marcia Tucker organized The New York Correspondence School Exhibition at the [[Whitney Museum]] in New York, which was the first significant public exhibition of the mail art genre.&lt;ref name=MOCA /&gt;

On April 5, 1973, Johnson declared the "death" of the New York Correspondance School in an unpublished letter to the Obituary Department of ''The New York Times'' and in copies that he circulated to his network.   However, he continued to practice mail art even after this.&lt;ref name=AAALippardLetter&gt;{{cite web|title=Ray Johnson mail art to Lucy R. Lippard, 1965 June 29|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/images/detail/ray-johnson-mail-art-to-lucy-r-lippard-13544|work=Archives of American Art|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RJEstate-bio&gt;{{cite web|title=Ray Johnson Biography|url=http://www.rayjohnsonestate.com/biography/|publisher=Ray Johnson Estate|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although much of Johnson's work was initially given away, this hasn't prevented it from attaining a market value. [[Andy Warhol]] is quoted as saying he would pay ten dollars for anything by Johnson."&lt;ref&gt;Stewart Home, ''The Assault On Culture'', Aporia Press &amp; Unpopular Books, London 1988 {{full citation needed|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1973 diagram showing the development and scope of [[Fluxus]], [[George Maciunas]] included mail art among the activities pursued by the Fluxus artist [[Robert Filliou]].&lt;ref&gt;Hendricks, Jon (1988). ''Fluxus Codex'', New York: Harry N. Abrams, pp 329–333. {{ISBN|978-0-8109-0920-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filliou coined the term the "Eternal Network" that has become synonymous with mail art.&lt;ref name=Bloch&gt;{{cite book|last=Bloch|first=Mark|title=Amazing Letters: The Life and Art of David Zack|url=http://www.panmodern.com/zack-article.html|editor=Istvan Kantor|accessdate=11 April 2013|chapter=An Authentik and Historikal Discourse On the Phenomenon of David Zack, Mail Artist}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other Fluxus artists have been involved since the early 1960s in the creation of artist's postage stamps (Robert Watts, Stamp Dispenser, 1963), postcards (Ben Vautier, The Postman's Choice, 1965: a postcard with a different address on each side) and other works connected to the postal medium.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} "Indeed, the mail art network counts many Fluxus members among its earliest participants.  While Johnson did not consider himself directly as a member of the Fluxus school, his interests and attitudes were consistent with those of a number of Fluxus artists.&lt;ref name=Danto /&gt;&lt;ref name=AAAOH /&gt;

===1970s and 1980s===
In the 1970s, the practice of mail art grew considerably, providing a cheap and flexible channel of expression for cultural outsiders.  It was particularly widespread where state censorship prevented a free circulation of alternative ideas, as in certain countries behind the Iron Curtain or in South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacob|first=John|title=East/West: Mail Art &amp; Censorship|journal=PostHype|year=1985|volume=4|issue=1|issn=0743-6025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of a sizable mail art community, with friendships born out of personal correspondence and, increasingly, mutual visits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lloyd|first=Ginny|title=The Mail Art Community in Europe|journal=Umbrella Magazine|year=1981|volume=5|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; led in the 1980s to the organization of several festivals, meetings and conventions where networkers could meet, socialize, perform, exhibit and plan further collaborations.  Among these events were the Inter Dada Festivals organized in California in the early 1980s&lt;ref name=Ross&gt;{{cite news|last=Ross|first=Janice|title=A gleefully rebellious festival of dada|url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/__IZN7YDU3d4/S_aip9CJ4WI/AAAAAAAAAmU/gS467sN7lZQ/s1600/reibunedada.jpg|accessdate=11 April 2013|newspaper=Oakland Tribune|date=August 26, 1984|location=Art: The Tribune Calendar}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Decentralized Mail Art Congress of 1986.&lt;ref name=HRFrickerOberlin&gt;{{cite web|title=Hans-Reudi Fricker|url=http://www.oberlin.edu/library/art/mailart/bios/fricker.html|work=Mail Art @ Oberlin|publisher=Oberlin College &amp; Conservatory|accessdate=11 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903031741/http://www.oberlin.edu/library/art/mailart/bios/fricker.html|archivedate=3 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 curator Ronny Cohen organized an exhibition for the [[Franklin Furnace]], New York, called "Mail Art Then and Now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mail Art From 1984 Franklin Furnace Exhibition|url=http://www.franklinfurnace.org/research/projects/flow/mailart/mailartf.html|publisher=Franklin Furnace|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition was to have an historical aspect as well as showing new mail art, and to mediate the two aspects Cohen edited the material sent to Franklin Furnace, breaking an unwritten but commonly accepted custom that all works submitted must be shown. The intent to edit, interpreted as censorship, resulted in a two-part panel discussion sponsored by Artists Talk on Art (organized by mail artist Carlo Pittore and moderated by art critic [[Robert C. Morgan]]) in February of that year, where Cohen and the mail artists were to debate the issues.

The night preceding the second panel on February 24, [[Carlo Pittore]], John P. Jacob, Chuck Welch a.k.a. CrackerJack Kid, David Cole and John Held, Jr. crafted a statement asking Dr. Cohen to step down as the panel moderator. Welch delivered the statement whereby Dr. Cohen was asked to remain on the panel but forfeit her right to serve as moderator. Instead of remaining, Cohen chose to leave the event. After some give and take with both panelists and audience, Dr. Cohen left, saying, "Have fun boys." Her entourage walked out with her during the ensuing melee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=International MailArt--Part II: The New Cultural Strategy|last=Heisler|first=Faith|year=1984|issue=4|volume=9|page=18|journal=Women Artists News}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The excluded works were ultimately added to the exhibition by the staff of the Franklin Furnace, but the events surrounding it and the panels revealed ideological rifts within the mail art community. Simultaneously fanning the flames and documenting the extent to which it was already dominated by a small, mostly male, coterie of artists, the discussions were transcribed and published by panelist [[John P. Jacob]] in his short-lived mail art [[zine]] [[PostHype]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacob|first=John|title=Mailart: A Partial Anatomy|journal=PostHype|year=1984|volume=3|issue=1|issn=0743-6025}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to panelist [[Mark Bloch]], [[Ray Johnson]] (who was not a panelist) commented on the reverse-censorship and sexism of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mark|first=Bloch|title=Ray Johnson's letter to me after the event, questioning the issue of sexism.|url=http://www.panmodern.com/ray-atoa-letter.jpg|publisher=panmodern.com|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of mail art meetings and congresses during the late 80s, and the articulation of various "isms" proclaimed by their founders as movements within mail art, were in part a response to fractures made visible by the events surrounding the Franklin Furnace exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacob|first=John|title=The Coffee Table Book of Mail Art: The Intimate Letters of J.P. Jacob, 1981 - 1987|year=1987|publisher=Riding Beggar Press|location=New York|url=http://arcade.nyarc.org:80/record=b569546~S8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if "tourism" was proposed satirically as a new movement by H.R. Fricker, a Swiss mail artist who was one of the organizers of the 1986 Mail Art Congress, nevertheless mail art in its pure form would continue to function without the personal meeting between so-called networkers.&lt;ref name=HRFrickerOberlin /&gt;

In the mid-1980s, Fricker and Bloch, in a bilingual "Open Letter To Everybody in the Network" &lt;ref&gt;Bloch, Mark and Fricker, Hans Ruedi."Phantastische Gebete Revisited" in Panmag International Magazine 6, ISSN 0738-4777, February 1984. pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; stated, "1) An important function of he exhibitions and other group projects in the network is: to open channels to other human beings. 2) After your exhibition is shown and the documentation sent, or after you have received such a documentation with a list of addresses, ''use the channels''! 3) Create person-to-person correspondence... 4) You have your own unique energy which you can give to others through your work: visual audio, verbal, etc.  5) This energy is best used when it is exchanged for energy from another person with the same intentions. 6) the power of the network is in the quality of the direct correspondence, not the quantity." The manifesto concludes, "We have learned this from our own mistakes." &lt;ref&gt;Röder, Kornelia "H. R. Fricker, Mail Art and Social Networks," HR Fricker: Conquer the Living Rooms of the World, Kunstmuseum Thurgau, Warth, Switzerland: Edition Fink, 2014, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s and the impact of the Internet era===
[[File:Paulo bruscky and david horvitz.JPG|thumb|American mail-artist [[David Horvitz]] (active since the 2000s) meets Brazilian mail artist Paulo Bruscky (active since the 1970s) in Berlin, Germany in November 2015.]]

In 1994, Dutch mail artist [[Ruud Janssen]] began a series of [[mail-interviews]] which became an influential contribution in the field of mail art.&lt;ref&gt;
Ruud Janssen, ''Mail-Interviews'', Tilburg 1994–2001
&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1990s, mail art's peak in terms of global postal activities had been reached, and mail artists, aware of increasing postal rates, were beginning the gradual migration of collective art projects towards the web and new, cheaper forms of digital communication.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Bleus]] (Ed.), ''Re: The E-Mail-Art &amp; Internet-Art Manifesto'', in: ''E-Pêle-Mêle: Electronic Mail-Art Netzine'', Vol.III, n° 1, T.A.C.-42.292, Hasselt, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet facilitated faster dissemination of mail art calls (invitations) and precipitated the involvement of a large number of newcomers.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Mail art blogs and websites became ever more frequently used to display contributions and online documentation,{{original research inline|date=January 2013}} even if many{{who|date=January 2013}} mail artists still preferred the surprise of a catalogue found in their mailbox.{{original research inline|date=January 2013}}

==Philosophy and norms of the mail artist network==
In spite of the many links and similarities between historical avant-garde, alternative art practices ([[visual poetry]], [[Xerox art|copy art]], [[artist's book]]s) and mail art, one aspect that distinguishes the creative postal network from other artistic movements, schools or groups (including Fluxus) is the way it disregards and circumvents for the commercial art market.&lt;ref name=Spark&gt;{{cite web|title=About John Held Jr. in the Spark episode "The Fine Art of Collecting"|url=http://www.kqed.org/arts/programs/spark/profile.jsp?essid=4489|work=Spark|publisher=KQED|accessdate=11 April 2013|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Any person with access to a mailbox can participate in the postal network and exchange free artworks, and each mail artist is free to decide how and when to answer (or not answer) a piece of incoming mail. Participants are invited by network members to take part in collective projects or unjuried exhibitions in which entries are not selected or judged.  While contributions may be solicited around a particular theme, work to a required size, or sent in by a deadline, mail art generally operates within a spirit of "anything goes."&lt;ref name="Phillpot" /&gt;

The mail art philosophy of openness and inclusion is exemplified by the "rules" included in invitations (calls) to postal projects: a mail art show has no jury, no entry fee, there is no censorship, and all works are exhibited.&lt;ref name="Phillpot" /&gt; The original contributions are not to be returned and remain the property of the organizers, but a catalogue or documentation is sent free to all the participants in exchange for their works. Although these rules are sometimes stretched, they have generally held up for four decades, with only minor dissimilarities and adjustments, like the occasional requests to avoid works of explicit sexual nature, calls for projects with specific participants, or the recent trend to display digital documentation on blogs and websites instead of personally sending printed paper to contributors.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

[[File:BananaPost'89 AnnaBanana.jpg|right|thumb|BananaPost '89 artistamps by Anna Banana, 1989]]
Mail art has been exhibited in alternative spaces such as private apartments, municipal buildings, and shop windows, as well as in galleries and museums worldwide.&lt;ref name=Oberlin /&gt;   Mail art shows, periodicals, and projects represent the "public" side of postal networking, a practice that has at its core the direct and private interaction between the individual participants. Mail artists value the process of exchanging ideas and the sense of belonging to a global community that is able to maintain a peaceful collaboration beyond differences of language, religion and ideology; this is one aspect that differentiates the mail art network from the world of commercial picture postcards and of simply "mailed art."&lt;ref name="WelchAnthology"&gt;Welch, C. (1995). ''[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/231651233 Eternal network: A mail art anthology]''. Calgary, Alta: Univ. of Calgary Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A mail artist may have hundreds of correspondents from many different countries, or build a smaller core circle of favorite contacts. Mail art is widely practiced in Europe, North and South America, Russia, Australia and Japan, with smaller numbers of participants also in Africa, and China.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}  In addition to being kept by the recipient, mail art archives have attracted the interest of libraries, archives, museums, and private collectors.&lt;ref name=Spark /&gt;  Or, the works may be 'worked into' and recycled back to the sender or to another networker.

[[File:Envelope HRFricker(1990).jpg|right|thumb|Mail art envelope from H.R. Fricker, 1990]]
Ray Johnson suggested (with a pun) that "mail art has no history, only a present", and mail artists have followed his playful attitude in creating their own mythologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43915838|title=Ray Johnson : correspondences|last=M.|first=De Salvo, Donna|last2=Catherine.|first2=Gudis,|date=1999|publisher=Wexner Center for the Arts|year=|isbn=2080136631|location=|pages=81|oclc=43915838}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parody art movements like [[neoism]] and plagiarism have challenged notions of originality, as have the shared pseudonymous names [[Monty Cantsin]] and [[Karen Eliot]], which were proposed for serial use by anyone.&lt;ref name="Carr2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=C. Carr|title=On Edge: Performance at the End of the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QX9ZSOWJO-gC&amp;pg=PA105|date=9 April 2012|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|isbn=978-0-8195-7242-4|pages=105–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Semi-fictional organizations have been set up and virtual lands invented, imaginary countries for which [[artistamps]] are issued.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, attempts have been made to document and define the history of a complex and underestimated phenomenon that has spanned five decades. Various essays, graduate theses, guides and anthologies of mail art writings have appeared in print and on the Internet, often written by veteran networkers.&lt;ref name=WelchAnthology /&gt;
A sub-group of envelope art has its genesis in the Grateful Dead Ticket Service. Looking to help their fans avoid  the high fees that are generated by national ticket services the Grateful Dead started their own service, commonly referred to as mail order. At some point fans started decorating their envelopes with art. Some for art's sake, others to grab the attention of the people that dole out tickets in hope of better seats.http://www.gdtstoo.com/

==Media and artistic practices in the creation of mail artworks==
{{see also|Postage stamp}}
Because the democratic ethos of mail art is one of inclusion, both in terms of participants ('anyone who can afford the postage') and in the scope of art forms, a broad range of media are employed in creation of mail artworks. Certain materials and techniques are commonly used and frequently favored by mail artists due to their availability, convenience, and ability to produce copies.

===Rubberstamps and artistamps===
[[File:Rubberstamps Klafki Pawson(1980s).jpg|right|thumb|Mail art rubber stamps by Jo Klafki (left) and Mark Pawson (right), 1980s]]
Mail art has adopted and appropriated several of graphic forms already associated with the postal system. The rubber stamp officially used for franking mail, already utilized by [[Dada]] and Fluxus artists, has been embraced by mail artists who, in addition to reusing ready-made rubber stamps, have them professionally made to their own designs. They also carve into erasers with linocut tools to create handmade ones. These unofficial rubber stamps, whether disseminating mail artists' messages or simply announcing the identity of the sender, help to transform regular postcards into artworks and make envelopes an important part of the mail art experience.&lt;ref name=WelchAnthology /&gt;

[[File:CarvedEraser ArtNahpro(c.1990).jpg|right|thumb|Carved eraser print by Paul Jackson, aka Art Nahpro, c. 1990]]
Mail art has also appropriated the postage stamp as a format for individual expression. Inspired by the example of Cinderella stamps and Fluxus faux-stamps, the [[artistamp]] has spawned a vibrant sub-network of artists dedicated to creating and exchanging their own stamps and stamp sheets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpost.be/site/fr/particuliers/timbres-poste/philat%C3%A9lie/timbres/2003/emission-sp%C3%A9ciale-09-du-19-mai |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526171811/http://www.bpost.be/site/fr/particuliers/timbres-poste/philat%C3%A9lie/timbres/2003/emission-sp%C3%A9ciale-09-du-19-mai |archivedate=2015-05-26 |df= }} Belgian Postal Service, Guy Bleus &amp; Jean Spiroux, ''Journée du Timbre: Mail-Art'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Artist [[Jerry Dreva]] of the conceptual art group Les Petits Bonbons created a set of stamps and sent them to David Bowie who then used them as the inspiration for the cover of the single "Ashes to Ashes" released in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Griffin|first1=Roger|title=Scary Monsters|url=http://www.bowiegoldenyears.com/scarymonsters.html|website=Bowie Golden Years}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artistamps and rubber stamps, have become important staples of mail artworks, particularly in the enhancement of postcards and envelopes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Frank, Peter, E.F. Higgins III, Rudolf Ungváry. "[http://www.artpool.hu/Artistamp/PFranke.html Postal Modernism: Artists' Stamps and Stamp Images]." ''World Art Post'', Artpool Archive, Museum of Fine Arts Budapest, April 1982 (pp.&amp;nbsp;1–4)&lt;/ref&gt; The most important anthology of rubberstamp art was published by the artist Hervé Fischer in his book ''Art and Marginal Communication'', Balland, Paris, 1974 - in French, English and German, to note also the catalog of the exhibition "Timbres d'artistes", Published of Musée de la Poste, Paris, 1993, organized by the french artist Jean-Noël Laszlo - in French, English.

===Envelopes===
Some mail artists lavish more attention on the envelopes than the contents within. Painted envelopes are one-of-a-kind artworks with the handwritten address becoming part of the work. Stitching, embossing and an array of drawing materials can all be found on postcards, envelopes and on the contents inside.&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt;

===Printing and copying===
Printing is suited to mail artists who distribute their work widely. Various printmaking techniques, in addition to rubber stamping, are used to create multiples. Copy art (xerography, photocopy) is a common practice, with both mono and color copying being extensively used within the network.&lt;ref name="UB" /&gt;  Ubiquitous 'add &amp; pass' sheets that are designed to be circulated through the network with each artist adding and copying, chain-letter fashion, have also received some unfavorable criticism.{{according to whom|date=January 2013}} However, Xerography has been a key technology in the creation of many short-run periodicals and [[zines]] about mail art, and for the printed documentation that has been the traditional project culmination sent to participants. Inkjet and laserprint computer printouts are also used, both to disseminate artwork and for reproducing zines and documentation, and PDF copies of paperless periodicals and unprinted documentation are circulated by email. Photography is widely used as an art form, to provide images for artistamps and rubber stamps, and within printed and digital magazines and documentation,&lt;ref name="WelchAnthology" /&gt; while some projects have focused on the intersection of mail art with the medium itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacob|first=John|title=[[The International Portfolio of Artists Photography]]|year=1984|publisher=Riding Beggar Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lettering and language===
Lettering, whether handwritten or printed, is integral to mail art. The written word is used as a literary art form, as well as for personal letters and notes sent with artwork and recordings of the spoken word, both of poetry and prose, are also a part of the network.&lt;ref name="UB" /&gt; Although English has been the de facto language, because of the movement's inception in America, an increasing number of mail artists, and mail artist groups on the Internet, now communicate in Breton, French, Italian, German, Spanish, and Russian.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===Other media===
In addition to appropriating the postage stamp model, mail artists have assimilated other design formats for printed artworks. Artists' books, decobooks and [[friendship book]]s, banknotes, stickers, tickets, artist trading cards (ATCs), badges, food packaging, diagrams and maps have all been used.

[[File:Kairan MAZine(2007).jpg|right|thumb|Cover of ''Kairan'' mail art zine, edited by Gianni Simone, aka Johnnyboy, 2007]]
Mail artists routinely mix media; [[collage]] and [[photomontage]] are popular, affording some mail art the stylistic qualities of [[pop art]] or Dada. Mail artists often use collage techniques to produce original postcards, envelopes and work that may be transformed using copy art techniques or computer software, then photocopied or printed out in limited editions.

[[Printed matter]] and [[ephemera]] are often circulated among mail artists, and after artistic treatment, these common items enter into the mail art network.&lt;ref name="UB" /&gt;  Small assemblages, sculptural forms or found objects of irregular shapes and sizes are parceled up or sent unwrapped to deliberately tease and test the efficiency of the postal service. Mailable fake fur ("Hairmail") and [[Astroturf]] postcards were circulated in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="WaPo"&gt;{{cite news |

Having borrowed the notion of [[intermedia]] from Fluxus, mail artists are often active simultaneously in several different fields of expression. Music and [[sound art]] have long been celebrated aspects of mail art, at first using cassette tape, then on CD and as sound files sent via the Internet.&lt;ref name="CoxWarner2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christoph Cox|author2=Daniel Warner|title=Audio Culture: Readings in Modern Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FgDgCOSHPysC&amp;pg=PA60|date=1 September 2004|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-0-8264-1615-5|pages=60–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Performance art]] has also been a prominent facet, particularly since the advent of mail art meetings and congresses. Performances recorded on film or video are communicated via DVD and movie files over the internet. Video is also increasingly being employed to document mail art shows of all kinds.&lt;ref name=mailartforum&gt;{{cite web|title=The Techniques|url=http://www.mail-art.de/frame.php?dir=about:about_techniques&amp;doc=start.htm|work=Mail-Art:The Forum|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotations==

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Correspondence art is an elusive art form, far more variegated by its very nature than, say, painting. Where a painting always involves paint and a support surface, correspondence art can appear as any one of dozens of media transmitted through the mail. While the vast majority of correspondence art or mail art activities take place in the mail, today's new forms of electronic communication blur the edges of that forum. In the 1960s, when correspondence art first began to blossom, most artists found the postal service to be the most readily available - and least expensive - medium of exchange. Today's micro-computers with modern facilities offer anyone computing and communicating power that two decades ago were available only to the largest institutions and corporations, and only a few decades previous weren't available to anyone at any price." - [[Ken Friedman]]&lt;ref name=FriedmanFlue&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedman|first=Ken|title=Mail art history: the Fluxus factor|journal=FLUE - Special Issue: Mail Art|year=1984|volume=4|issue=3–4|editor1-first=Martha|editor1-last=Wilson|publisher=Franklin Furnace}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Cultural exchange is a radical act. It can create paradigms for the reverential sharing and preservation of the earth's water, soil, forests, plants and animals. The ethereal networker aesthetic calls for guiding that dream through action. Cooperation and participation, and the celebration of art as a birthing of life, vision, and spirit are first steps. The artists who meet each other in the Eternal Network have taken these steps. Their shared enterprise is a contribution to our common future." - [[Chuck Welch]]&lt;ref name="WelchAnthology" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The purpose of mail art, an activity shared by many artists throughout the world, is to establish an aesthetical communication between artists and common people in every corner of the globe, to divulge their work outside the structures of the art market and outside the traditional venues and institutions: a free communication in which words and signs, texts and colours act like instruments for a direct and immediate interaction." - Loredana Parmesani&lt;ref&gt;Loredana Parmesani, text under the entry "Poesia visiva", in ''L'arte del secolo - Movimenti, teorie, scuole e tendenze 1900–2000'', Giò Marconi - Skira, Milan 1997 {{full citation needed|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Marxism|Aspects}}
'''Marxist aesthetics''' is a theory of [[aesthetics]] based on, or derived from, the theories of [[Karl Marx]]. It involves a [[dialectical]] and [[materialist]], or [[dialectical materialist]], approach to the application of [[Marxism]] to the cultural sphere, specifically areas related to taste such as art, beauty, etc.  Marxists believe that economic and social conditions, and especially the class relations that derive from them, affect every aspect of an individual's life, from religious beliefs to legal systems to cultural frameworks. From one classic Marxist point of view, the role of art is not only to represent such conditions truthfully, but also to seek to improve them (social/socialist realism); however, this is a contentious interpretation of the limited but significant writing by Marx and Engels on art and especially on aesthetics. For instance, [[Nikolay Chernyshevsky]], who greatly influenced the art of the early [[Soviet Union]], followed the secular humanism of [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] more than he followed Marx.

Marxist aesthetics overlaps with the Marxist theory of art. It is particularly concerned with art practice, with the prescribing of artistic standards that are deemed socially beneficial. This materialist and socialist orientation may be seen to invoke (however problematically) the traditional aims of scientific inquiry and the scientific method.

Some notable Marxist aestheticians include [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]], [[Mikhail Lifshitz]], [[William Morris]], [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Georg Lukács]], [[Terry Eagleton]], [[Fredric Jameson]], [[Louis Althusser]], [[Jacques Rancière]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and [[Raymond Williams]]. [[Roland Barthes]] must also be mentioned here.

Not all of these figures are solely concerned with aesthetics: in many cases, Marxist aesthetics forms only an important branch of their work, depending on how one defines the term. For example, a Marxist aesthetic may be latent in Brecht's work, but he formulated his own distinct theory of art and its social purpose.

One of the chief concerns of Marxist aesthetics is to unite Marx and Engels’ social and economic theory, or theory of the social ''base'', to the domain of art and culture, the ''superstructure''. These two terms, base and superstructure, became an important dichotomy in ''[[The German Ideology]]'' (1846), which however was not published during their lifetimes. Likewise Marx's early ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]'', which, though widely regarded as important for treating the themes of sensuousness and alienation, first appeared only in 1932 (the slated 1846 publication was canceled) and in English only in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Tedman, Gary. (2004) "Marx's 1844 manuscripts as a work of art: A hypertextual reinterpretation." ''Rethinking Marxism'' 16.4: 427-441.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fay, Margaret, "The Influence of Adam Smith on Marx's Theory of Alienation", ''Science &amp; Society'' Vol. 47, No. 2 (Summer, 1983), pp. 129-151, S&amp;S Quarterly, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscripts were therefore unknown to art theorists during, for instance, the often antagonistic debates on art in the early Soviet Union between the [[constructivism (art)|constructivist]] avant garde and the proponents of [[socialist realism]]. The controversy over the unusual design&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gary.tedman.pagesperso-orange.fr/index.htm |author=Gary Tedman |title=Economic &amp; Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844 (as hypertext) by Karl Marx |date=2007 |accessdate=2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the original documents adds another twist.&lt;ref&gt;See notes, Margaret Fay, Gary Tedman.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many theorists touch upon important themes of Marxist aesthetics without strictly being Marxist aestheticians, [[Joel Kovel]], for instance, has extended the concepts of Marxian ecology which deeply implicates aesthetics. He is also a part of the struggle to bridge the space between Marx and [[Freud]], which has Marxist aesthetics as a central concern.&lt;ref&gt;See the journal ''Capitalism, Nature, Socialism''.&lt;/ref&gt; Current themes within the field include research on the effect of [[mass production|mass-produced]] industrial materials on the sensed environment, such as paints and colors.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Iona. (2007) "Color, Facture, Art and Design." ''Capitalism Nature Socialism'' 18.1: 64-80.&lt;/ref&gt; A strong current within the field involves linguistics and semiotics, and arguments over structuralism and post-structuralism, modernism and post-modernism, as well as feminist theory.

Visual artists, as diverse as [[Isaak Brodsky]] or [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Kasimir Malevich]] or [[Lyubov Popova]], for example, for whom written theory is secondary, nevertheless may be said to be connected to Marxist aesthetics through their production of art, without necessarily declaring themselves aestheticians or Marxists in writing. Likewise, in this spirit [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Dziga Vertov]], [[Sergei Eisenstein]], [[Orson Welles]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Richard Paul Lohse]], for example. Such a view could apply to many visual and other artists in many fields, even those who have no apparent and/or voiced connection to Marxist politics or even those ostensibly opposed; in this respect consider [[Anton Webern]].

Probably it would be fair to say that two of the most influential writings in Marxist aesthetics in recent times, and apart from Marx himself and Lukacs, have been Walter Benjamin's essay ''[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]'', and Herbert Marcuse's ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]''. Louis Althusser has also contributed some small but significant essays on art and his theory of ideology also impacts in this area ("[[Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses]]").

The field remains polemical, with camps of modernists, post modernists, anti modernists, the avant garde, constructivists, social realists and socialist realists all referencing back to an ostensible Marxist aesthetic theory that would underpin their art practices by grounding an art theory.

'''Mexican muralism''' was the promotion of [[mural]] painting starting in the 1920s, generally with social and political messages as part of efforts to reunify the country under the post [[Mexican Revolution]] government. It was headed by “the big three” painters, [[Diego Rivera]], [[José Clemente Orozco]] and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]]. From the 1920s to about 1970s a large number of murals with nationalistic, social and political messages were created on public buildings, starting a tradition which continues to this day in [[Mexico]] and has had impact in other parts of the Americas, including the [[United States]] where it served as inspiration for the [[Chicano art movement]].

[[Mexico]] has had a tradition of painting murals, starting with the [[Olmec]] civilization in the pre Hispanic period and into the colonial period, with murals mostly painted to evangelize and reinforce Christian doctrine.&lt;ref name="chicano"&gt;{{Cite thesis |type=PhD |chapter= |title=The Chicano Mural movement of the Southwest: Populist public art and Chicano political activism |author= John Eugene Kenny |year=2006 |publisher= University of New Orleans |oclc=3253092 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern tradition has its roots in the 19th century, with this use of political and social themes. The first Mexican mural painter to use philosophical themes in his work was [[Juan Cordero]] in the mid 19th century. Although he did mostly work with religious themes such as the cupola of the [[Santa Teresa la Antigua|Santa Teresa Church]] and other churches, he painted a secular mural at the request of [[Gabino Barreda]] at the [[Escuela Nacional Preparatoria]] (since disappeared).&lt;ref name="plasmo"&gt;{{cite news |title= Plasmó Juan Cordero primer mural en México con temas filosóficos |newspaper=NOTIMEX |location=Mexico City |date=May 27, 2008&lt;!--|918-917-9042--&gt;  |language=Spanish |trans-title=Juan Cordero plastered the first mural with philosophical themes in Mexico }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter 19th century was dominated politically by the [[Porfirio Díaz]] regime. This government was the first to push for the cultural development of the country, supporting the [[Academy of San Carlos]] and sending promising artists abroad to study. However, this effort left out indigenous culture and people, with the aim of making [[Mexico]] like [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; [[Dr. Atl|Gerardo Murillo, also known as Dr. Atl]], is considered to be the first modern Mexican muralists with the idea that Mexican art should reflect Mexican life.&lt;ref name="sbcounty"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sbcounty.gov/museum/media/press-kit/contretas/contreras-media-kit-mural-tradition.pdf |title= The art of Ramón Contreras and the Mexican Muralists movement |publisher= San Bernardino County Museum  |accessdate=June 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Academy training and the government had only promoted imitations of European art.  Atl and other early muralists pressured the Diaz government to allow them to paint on building walls to escape this formalism.&lt;ref name="inehrm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inehrm.gob.mx/Portal/PtMain.php?pagina=exp-muralismo-en-la-revolucion-articulo |title=El muralismo y la Revolución Mexicana |author=) Luz Elena Mainero del Castillo |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Estudios Históricos de las Revoluciones de México |location=Mexico |year=2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Muralism asn the Mexican Revolution |accessdate=June 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514210135/http://www.inehrm.gob.mx/Portal/PtMain.php?pagina=exp-muralismo-en-la-revolucion-articulo |archivedate=May 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Atl also organized an independent exhibition of native Mexican artists promoting many indigenous and national themes along with color schemes that would later appear in mural painting.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253341 |title= Populist art and the Mexican mural renaissance |work= Hispanic Heritage in the Americas -Latin American art |publisher= Britannica  |accessdate=June 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern Mexican mural, painted by Atl, was a series of female nudes using “Atlcolor” a substance Atl invented himself, very shortly before the beginning of the [[Mexican Revolution]] .&lt;ref name="dratl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1205-dr-atl-and-the-revolution-in-mexico-s-art |title=Dr. Atl and the revolution in Mexico's art  |last1=Burton |first1=Tony |date=March 14, 2008 |issn=1028-9089 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |accessdate=June 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another influence on the young artists of the late Porfirian period was the graphic work of [[José Guadalupe Posada]], who mocked European styles and created cartoons with social and political criticism.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

The [[Mexican Revolution]] itself was the culmination of political and social opposition to [[Porfirio Díaz]] policies. One important oppositional group was a small intellectual community that included [[Antonio Curo]], [[Alfonso Reyes]] and [[José Vasconcelos]]. They promoted a populist philosophy that coincided with the social and political criticism of Atl and Posada and influenced the next generation of painters such as [[Diego Rivera]], [[José Clemente Orozco]] and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]].&lt;ref name="mexconnect"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1064-mexican-muralists-the-big-three-orozco-rivera-siqueiros |title= Mexican muralists: the big three - Orozco, Rivera, Siqueiros.  |first=Rita |last=Pomade |date= May 5, 2007  |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=June 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These ideas gained power as a result of the [[Mexican Revolution]], which overthrew the Díaz regime in less than a year.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; However, there was nearly a decade of fighting among the various factions vying for power. Governments changed frequently with a number of assassinations, including that of [[Francisco I. Madero]] who initiated the struggle. It ended in the early 1920s with one-party rule in the hands of the [[Álvaro Obregón]] faction, which became the [[Partido Revolucionario Institucional]] (PRI).&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; During the Revolution, Atl supported the Carranza faction and promoted the work of Rivera, Orozco and Siqueiros, who would later be the founders of the muralism movement. Through the war and until 1921, Atl continued to paint murals among other activities including teaching the Mexico’s next generation of artists and muralists.&lt;ref name="dratl"/&gt;

In 1921, after the end of the military phase of the Revolution, José Vasconcelos was appointed to head the [[Secretaría de Educación Pública]]. At the time, most of the Mexican population was illiterate and the government needed a way to promote the ideals of the Mexican Revolution. It was Vasconcelos’s idea have a government-backed mural program for this purpose.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; Similar to mural use in the pre Hispanic period and during the colonial period, the purpose of these murals were not simply aesthetic, but social, to promote certain ideals.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; These ideals or principles were to glorify the [[Mexican Revolution]] and the identity of [[Mexico]] as a mestizo nation, with the indigenous promoted as well as the Spanish.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;  The government began to hire the country’s best artists to paint murals, calling some of them home from Europe including [[Diego Rivera]].&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; These initial muralists included Dr. Atl, [[Ramón Alva de la Canal]], [[Federico Cantú]] and others but the main three would be [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[José Clemente Orozco]] and [[Diego Rivera]]. His time as secretary was short but it set how muralism would develop. His image was painted on a tempera mural in 1921 by [[Roberto Montenegro]], but this was short lived. His successor at the Secretaría de Educación Pública ordered it painted out.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; The muralists differed in style and temperament, but all believed that art was for the education and betterment of the people. This was behind their acceptance of these commissions as well as their creation of the Syndicate of Technical Workers, Painters, and Sculptors.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; 
[[File:HoyTamayoBADF.JPG|thumb|Mural in the Palacio de Bellas Artes by [[Rufino Tamayo]].]]

The first government sponsored mural project was on the three levels of interior walls of the old Jesuit institution [[San Ildefonso College|Colegio San Ildefonso]], at that time used for the [[Escuela Nacional Preparatoria]].&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; However, most of the murals in the Escuela National Preparatoria were done by José Clemente Orozco with themes of a mestizo Mexico, the ideas of renovation and the tragedies of the Revolution;&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; [[Fernando Leal (artist)|Fernando Leal]] painted ["dancers of Chalma"] "Los danzantes de Chalma", no earlier than 1922. Opposite that mural, [[Jean Charlot]] painted ''La conquista de Tenochtitlán'' (Conquest of Tenochtitlan) by Jean Charlot—invited by Leal.&lt;ref name="folgarait"&gt; {{cite book |title= Mural painting and Social Revolution in Mexico 1920-1940  |last= Folgariat |first= Leonard |year=1998 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= Cambridge |isbn=0-521-58147-8 |pages=42-46 }} &lt;/ref&gt; 

===After the mural project at the National Preparatory High School===
This project at the institution was followed by projects at the [[National Palace (Mexico)|Palacio Nacional]], the interior walls of the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]], the [[Chapingo Autonomous University|Escuela Nacional de Chapingo]] the Escuela Nacional de Medicina and the [[Secretariat of Public Education Main Headquarters|Secretaria de Educación Pública building]] among many others.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;
[[File:DeembarcoCanalSICDF.JPG|thumb|[[Ramón Alva de la Canal]], Mural at [[San Ildefonso College|Colegio San Ildefonso]]]]
The movement was strongest from the 1920s to the 1950s, which corresponded to the country’s transformation from a mostly rural and mostly illiterate society to an industrialized one. While today they are part of Mexico’s identity, at the time they were controversial, especially those with socialist messages plastered on centuries-old colonial buildings.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; One of the basic underpinnings of the nascence of a post revolutionary Mexican art was that it should be public, available to the citizenry and above all not the province of a few wealthy collectors.  The great societal upheaval made the concept possible as well as a lack of relatively wealthy middle class to support the arts.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; On this, the painters and the government agreed. One other point of agreement was that artists should have complete freedom of expression. This would lead to another element added to the murals over their development. In addition to the original ideas of a reconstructed Mexico and the elevation of Mexico’s indigenous and rural identity, many of the muralists, including the three main painters, also included elements of [[Marxism]], especially the struggle of the working class against oppression.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;

The inception and early years of Mexico's muralist movement are often considered the most ideologically pure and untainted by contradictions between socialist ideals and government manipulation. This initial phase is referred to as the "heroic" phase while the period after 1930 is the "statist" phase with the transition to the latter phase caused by José Vasconcelos's resignation in 1924.&lt;ref name="Coffey 2002 7–38"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coffey|first=Mary|title=Muralism and The People: Culture, Popular Citizenship, and Government in Post-Revolutionary Mexico|journal=The Communication Review|year=2002|volume=5|pages=7–38|doi=10.1080/10714420212350}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Mary Coffey describes those who "acknowledge a change but refrain from judgment about its consequences" as taking the soft line and those who see all murals after 1930 as "propaganda for a corrupt state" as taking a hard line.&lt;ref name="Coffey 2002 7–38"/&gt;  Another stance is that the evolution of Mexican muralism as having an uncomplicated relationship with the government and as an accurate reflection of avant-garde and proletariat sentiments. However, hard liners see the movement as complicit in the corrupt government's power consolidation under the guise of a socialist regime.&lt;ref name="Coffey 2002 7–38"/&gt;

Art historian Leonard Folgarait has a slightly different view. He marks 1940 as the end of the post-revolutionary period in Mexico as well as the renaissance era of the muralist movement.&lt;ref name="Leonard 1998 7"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leonard|first=Folgarait|title=Mural Painting and Social Revolution in Mexico, 1920-1940: Art of the New Order|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusion of the Lázaro Cárdenas administration (1934 – 1940) and the beginning of the Manuel Avila Camacho (1940 – 1946) administration saw the rise of an ultraconservative Mexico.&lt;ref name="Leonard 1998 7"/&gt;  The country’s policy was aimed at maintaining and strengthening a capitalist society.&lt;ref name="Leonard 1998 7"/&gt; Mural artists like the Big Three spent the post-revolutionary period developing their work based on the promises of a better future, and with the advent of conservatism they lost their subject and their voice.

The Mexican government began to distance itself from mural projects and mural production became relatively privatized. This privatization was a result of patronage from the growing national bourgeoisie. Murals were increasingly contracted for theaters, banks, and hotels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Bruce|title=Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis|year=2003|publisher=The University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistry==
[[File:MuralCamarenaBellasArtes.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Mural by [[Jorge González Camarena]] at the Palacio de Bellas Artes]]

Mexican populist art production from the 1920s to the 1950s is often grouped under the name of “Escuela Mexicana de Pintura (y Escultura) (Mexican School of Painting and Sculpture), coined in the 1930s by art historians and critics. The term is not well-defined as it does not distinguish among some important stylistic and thematic difference, there is no firm agreement which artists belong to it nor if muralism should be considered part of it or separate.&lt;ref name="anos30"&gt;{{cite news |title= Testigo de los anos 30 |author=James Oles |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=January 12, 2000 |page=1 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Witness to the 1930s }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="minima"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arts-history.mx/artmex/tema3.html |title=Escuela Mexicana de Pintura y Escultura |publisher=Artes e Historia magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=Mexican School of Painting and Sculpting |accessdate=June 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not a school in the classic sense of the word as it includes work by more than one generation and with different styles that sometimes clash. However, it does involve a number of important characteristics. Mexican School mural painting was a combination of public ideals and artistic aesthetics “positioned as a constituent of the official public sphere.” &lt;ref name="Campbell 2003 55"&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Bruce|title=Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis|year=2003|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|isbn=0-8165-2239-1|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three formal components of official Mexican muralism are defined as:
1) Direct participation in official publicity and discourse&lt;ref name="Campbell 2003 71"&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Bruce|title=Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis|year=2003|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|isbn=0-8165-2239-1|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
2) Reciprocal integration of the visual discourse of the mural to an array of communicative practices participant in defining official publicity (including a variety of scriptural genres, but also public speech, debate and provocative public “event”)&lt;ref name="Campbell 2003 71"/&gt;
3) The development and public thematizing of a social-realist aesthetic (albeit multiform in character) as the visual register for the public sense of the mural work and as the doxic, or unquestioned, limits for public dispute over the representational space of the mural image&lt;ref name="Campbell 2003 71"/&gt;
Most painters in this school worked in [[Mexico City]] or other cities in [[Mexico]], working almost uninterrupted on projects and/or as teachers, generally with support of the government. Most were concerned with the history and identity of [[Mexico]] and politically active. Most art from this school was not created for direct sale but rather for diffusion in both Mexico and abroad. Most were formally trained, often studying in Europe and/or in the Academy of San Carlos.&lt;ref name="minima"/&gt;  
[[File:Fragmento Mural Alfredo Zalce 5 057.jpg|thumb|180px|Mural by [[Alfredo Zalce]] at the state government palace in [[Morelia]].]]
A large quantity of murals were produced in most of the country from the 1920s to 1970, generally with themes related to politics and nationalism focused often on the [[Mexican Revolution]], mestizo identity and [[Mesoamerica]]n cultural history.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; These served as a form of cohesion among members of the movement.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; The political and nationalistic aspects had little directly to do with the Mexican Revolution, especially in the later decades. The goal was more to glorify it and its results as a means to legitimatize the post Revolution government.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; The other political orientation was that of [[Marxism]], especially class struggle. This was strongest in the early movement with Rivera, Orozco and Siqueiros all avowed communists.  The political messages became less radical but they remained firmly to the left.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; Much of the mural production glorified the indigenous aspect of Mexican culture, considering it an important factor in the creation of modern Mexico. This was added with the idea of reexamining the country’s history from a different perspective. One other aspect that most of the muralists shared was a rejection of the idea that art was only for the elite, but rather as a benefit for the masses.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;

The murals took on monumental status because of where they were situated, mostly on the walls of colonial era government buildings and the themes that were painted.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; The mural painters of [[Mexico]] freely shared ideas and techniques as they were a closely knit group. However, the work of each was distinctive as the government did not set style and artists can generally be deduced without looking at signatures.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; Techniques included the revival of old techniques such as the [[fresco]], painting on freshly plastered walls and [[encaustic painting|encaustic or hot wax painting]] .&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Others used mosaics and high fire ceramics, as well as metal parts, and layers of cement.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; The most innovative of the artists was Siqueiros who worked with [[pyroxlene]], a commercial enamel and [[Duco]] (used to paint cars), resins, asbestos, old machinery and was one of the first to use airbrush for artistic purposes. He pored, sprayed, dripped and splattered paint for the effects they created haphazardly.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;

==Los Tres Grandes==
[[File:RiveraMuralNationalPalace.jpg|thumb|Mural in the main stairwell of the National Palace by Diego Rivera]]
By far, the three most influential muralists from the 20th century are [[Diego Rivera]], [[José Clemente Orozco]], and [[David Siqueiros]], called “los tres grandes” (the three great ones).&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; All believed that art was the highest form of human expression and a key force in social revolution.&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt; Their work defined the movement taking over from Vasconcelos. It created a mythology around the [[Mexican Revolution]] and the Mexican people which is still influential to this day, as well as promote [[Marxism|Marxist]] ideals. At the time the works were painted, they also served as a form of catharsis over what the country had endured during the war.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; However, the three were different in their artistic expression. Rivera’s works were utopian and idealist, Orozco’s were critical and pessimistic and the most radical were those of Siqueiros, heavily focused on a scientific future.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; The differences among the three have much to do with how each experienced the [[Mexican Revolution]]. Rivera was in Europe the entire time and did not fight. He never depicted the horrors of the war but what he perceived to be the social benefits from it. The other two did and both did express the horrors of war in their work.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; There was resentment to Rivera by the other two because of it, especially from Siqueiros.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;
[[File:La abolición de la esclavitud de Orozco.JPG|thumb|left|[[Miguel Hidalgo]] abolishing slavery by José Clemente Orozco]]
Of the three, Rivera was the most traditional in terms of painting styles, drawing heavily from European modernism. In his narrative mural images, Rivera incorporated elements of cubism&lt;ref name="Campbell 2003 55"/&gt; His themes were Mexican, often scenes of everyday life and images of ancient Mexico. He originally painted this in bright colors in the European style but modified it to more earthy tones to imitate indigenous murals. His greatest contribution is the promotion of Mexico’s indigenous past into how many people both inside and outside of the country view it.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;

Orozco also began with a European style of expression. However his art developed into an angry denunciation of oppression especially by those he considered to be an evil and brutal rules class.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; His work was somber and dire, with emphasis on human suffering and fear of the technology of the future.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; His work shows an "expressionist use of color, slashing lines, and parodic distortions of the human figure." &lt;ref name="Cambell 2003 55"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cambell|first=Bruce|title=Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis|year=2003|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|isbn=0-8165-2239-1|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like most other muralists, Orozco condemned the Spanish as destroyers of indigenous culture, but he did have kinder depictions such as that of a Franciscan friar tending to an emaciated indigenous period.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Unlike other artists, Orozco never glorified the [[Mexican Revolution]], having fought in it, but rather depicted the horrors of this war. It caused many of his murals to be heavily criticized and even defaced.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;

Siqueiros was the youngest and most radical of the three. He joined the [[Venustiano Carranza]] army when he was eighteen and experienced the Revolution from the front lines.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Although all three muralists were communists, Siqueiros was the most dedicated, as evidenced by his portrayals of the proletarian masses. His work is also characterized with rapid, sweeping, bold lines and the use of modern enamels, machinery and other elements related to technology. His style showed a "futurist blurring of form and technique." His fascination with technology as it relates to art was exemplified when he emphasized the mass communications visual technology of photograph and motion picture in his eventual movement toward neorealism.&lt;ref name="Cambell 2003 55"/&gt; His radical politics made him unwelcome in [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]], so he did much of his work in [[South America]].&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; However, his masterpiece is considered to be the [[Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros]], located in Mexico City.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;

The Big Three struggled to express their leftist leanings after the initial years painting murals under government supervision. These struggles with the post-revolution government lead the muralists to create a union of artists and produce a radical manifesto. [[José Vasconcelos]], the Secretary of Public Education under President [[Álvaro Obregón]] (1920–24) contracted Rivera, Siqueiros, and Orozco to pursue painting with the moral and financial support of the new post-revolutionary government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richardson|first=William|title=The Dilemmas of a Communist Artist: Diego Rivera in Moscow, 1927-1928|journal=Mexican Studies|year=1987|volume=3|issue=1|pages=49–69|jstor=4617031|doi=10.2307/4617031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vasconcelos, while seeking to promote nationalism and “raza cosmica,” seemed to contradict this sentiment as he guided the muralists to create works in a classic, European style. The murals became a target of Vasconcelos’s criticism when the Big Three departed from classical proportion and figure. Siqueiros was dissatisfied with the incongruity between the murals and the revolutionary concerns of the muralists, and he advocated discussion among the artists of their future works.

In 1922 the muralists founded the Union of Revolutionary Technical Workers, Painters, and Sculptors of Mexico. The Union then released a manifesto listing education, art of public utility, and beauty for all as the social goals of their future artistic endeavors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cambell|first=Bruce|title=Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis|year=2003|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|isbn=0-8165-2239-1|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After nearly a century since the beginning of the movement, Mexican artists still produce murals and other forms of art with the same “mestizo” message. Murals can be found in government buildings, former churches and schools in nearly every part of the country.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crosscultural"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hubbard |first=Kathy |date=September 2010 |title= A CROSS-CULTURAL COLLABORATION: Using Visual Culture for the Creation of a Socially Relevant Mural in Mexico |journal=Art Education |volume=63 |issue=5 |pages=68–75 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One recent example is a cross cultural project in 2009 to paint a mural in the [[Traditional fixed markets in Mexico|municipal market]] of [[Teotitlán del Valle]], a small town in the state of [[Oaxaca]]. High school and college students from [[State of Georgia|Georgia]], [[United States]], collaborated with town authorities to design and paint a mural to promote nutrition, environmental protection, education and the preservation of [[Zapotec language]] and customs.&lt;ref name="crosscultural"/&gt;

Mexican muralism brought mural painting back to the forefront of Western art in the 20th century with its influence spreading abroad, especially promoting the idea of mural painting as a form of promoting social and political ideas.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; It offered an alternative to non-representational abstraction after [[World War I]] with figurative works that reflect society and its immediate concerns. While most Mexican muralists had little desire to be part of the international art scene, their influence spread to other parts of the Americas. Notable muralists influenced by Mexican muralism include [[Carlos Mérida]] of [[Guatemala]], [[Oswaldo Guayasamín]] of [[Ecuador]] and [[Candido Portinari]] of [[Brazil]] .&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

[[File:Fragmento Mural Alfredo Zalce 1 051.jpg|thumb|View of the mural in the Palacio de Gobierno]]
Rivera, Orozco, and Siqueiros all spent time in the United States. Orozco was the first to paint murals in the late 1920s at [[Pomona College]] in [[Claremont, California]], staying until 1934 and becoming popular with academic institutions.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt; During the [[Great Depression]], the [[Works Progress Administration]] employed artists to paint murals, which paved the way for Mexican muralists to find commissions in the country.&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt;  Rivera lived in the United States from 1930 to 1934. During this time, he put on an influential show of his easel work at the [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt; The success of Orozco and Rivera prompted U.S. artists to study in Mexico and opened doors for many other Mexican artists to find work in the country.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; Siqueiros did not fare as well. He was exiled to the US from Mexico in 1932, moving to [[Los Angeles]]. During this time, he painted three murals, but they were painted over.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt; The only one of the three to survive, [[América Tropical: Oprimida y Destrozada por los Imperialismos|''América Tropical'']] (full name: ''América Tropical: Oprimida y Destrozada por los Imperialismos'', or ''Tropical America: Oppressed and Destroyed by Imperialism''&lt;ref&gt;Del Barco, Mandalit.

The concept of mural as political message was transplanted to the United States, especially in the former Mexican territory of the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]]. It served as inspiration to the later [[Chicano]] muralism but the political messages are different.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; Revolutionary Nicaragua developed a tradition of muralism during the [[Sandinista]] period.&lt;ref&gt;David Kunzle, ''The Murals of Revolutionary Nicaragua, 1979-1992''.

'''Modern sculpture''' is generally considered to have begun with the work of [[Auguste Rodin]], who is seen as the progenitor of modern [[sculpture]]. While Rodin did not set out to rebel against the past, he created a new way of building his works.&lt;ref&gt;Elsen, Albert E. (2003). ''Rodin's Art: The Rodin Collection of the Iris &amp; Gerald B. Cantor Center for the Visual Arts''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-513381-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.psmuseum.org/exhibitions/upcoming_exhibition_new.php Rodin to Now: Modern Sculpture]", Palm Springs Desert Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; He "dissolved the hard outline of contemporary Neo-Greek academicism, and thereby created a vital synthesis of opacity and transparency, volume and void".&lt;ref&gt;Giedion-Welcker, Carola, ‘’Contemporary Sculpture: An Evolution in Volume and Space, A revised and Enlarged Edition’’, Faber and Faber, London, 1961, p. X&lt;/ref&gt; Along with a few other artists in the late 19th century who experimented with new artistic visions in sculpture like [[Edgar Degas]] and [[Paul Gauguin]], Rodin invented a radical new approach in the creation of sculpture. Modern sculpture, along with all modern art, "arose as part of Western society's attempt to come to terms with the urban, industrial and secular society that emerged during the nineteenth century".&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, Robert, ‘’ARTSPOKE: A Guide to Modern Ideas, Movements and Buzzwords, 1848-1944’’ Abbeville Publishers, New York, 1993, p.140&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Modernism|Modernist]] [[sculpture]] movements include [[Art Nouveau]], [[Cubist sculpture|Cubism]], [[Geometric abstraction]], [[De Stijl]], [[Suprematism]], [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], [[Dadaism]], [[Surrealism]], [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]], [[Formalism (art)|Formalism]] [[Abstract expressionism]], [[Pop-Art]], [[Minimalism]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Land art]], [[Conceptual art]], and [[Installation art]] among others.

The modern sculpture movement can be said to begin at the [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]] exhibit at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Universal Exhibition]] held in [[Paris, France|Paris]] in 1900. At this event Rodin showed his [[Burghers of Calais]], [[Balzac]], [[Victor Hugo]] statues, and the exhibition included the first public showing of his [[Gates of Hell]] which included [[The Thinker]].&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Penelope, ‘’Sculpture: 1900-1945’’, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1999, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elsen, Albert L., ‘’Rodin’s Gates of Hell’’, University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, MN, 1960 p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cubist sculpture]], in the early 20th century, was a style that developed in parallel with [[Cubism|cubist painting]], and the formal experiments of [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]]. Beginning around 1909 and evolving through the early 1920s cubist artists developed new means of constructing works of art using [[collage]], sculptural assemblage using disparate materials and traditional sculpture making from plaster and clay molds. Some sources name Picasso's 1909 bronze ''Head of a Woman'' as the first cubist sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;Grace Glueck, "[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/26/arts/art-view-picasso-revolutionized-sculpture-too.html Picasso Revolutionized Sculpture Too]", ''New York Times'', exhibition review 1982, Retrieved July 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Artists like [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] (1876-1918), whose career was cut short by his death in military service, and [[Alexander Archipenko]], who'd arrived in Paris in 1908 and whose 1912 ''Walking Woman'' were very quick to follow Braque and Picasso's lead.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kodnergallery.com/gallery/modernism/bios/archipenkobio.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Csaky]], a sculptor from Hungary, exhibited his first cubist sculptures in Paris in 1911. [[Duchamp-Villon]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Henri Laurens]] and [[Ossip Zadkine]] and others joined the earlier cubist sculptors.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Rosenblum, "Cubism", ''Readings in Art History 2'' (1976), Seuphor, Sculpture of this Century&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edith Balas, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=rUPz18-QeyEC&amp;q=csaky#v=onepage&amp;q=csaky&amp;f=false Joseph Csaky: A Pioneer of Modern Sculpture]'', American Philosophical Society, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, during his period of cubist innovation, [[Pablo Picasso]] revolutionized the art of sculpture when he began creating his ''constructions'' fashioned by combining disparate objects and materials into one constructed piece of sculpture; Picasso reinvented the art of sculpture with his innovative use of constructing a work in three dimensions with disparate material, the sculptural equivalent of the [[collage]] in two-dimensional art. Just as collage was a radical development in two-dimensional art; so was ''construction'' a radical development in three-dimensional sculpture. The advent of [[Surrealism]] led to things occasionally being described as "sculpture" that would not have been so previously, such as "involuntary sculpture" in several senses, including [[coulage]]. In later years Picasso became a prolific [[pottery|potter]], leading, with interest in historic pottery from around the world, to a revival of  [[ceramic art]], with figures such as [[George E. Ohr]] and subsequently [[Peter Voulkos]], [[Kenneth Price]], and [[Robert Arneson]]. [[Marcel Duchamp]] originated the use of the "[[found object]]" (French: ''objet trouvé'') or ''readymade'' with pieces such as [[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]] (1917).

Similarly, the work of [[Constantin Brâncuși]] at the beginning of the century paved the way for later abstract sculpture. In revolt against the naturalism of Rodin and his late 19th-century contemporaries, Brâncuși distilled subjects down to their essences as illustrated by the elegantly refined forms of his ''[[Bird in Space]]'' series (1924). These elegantly refined forms became synonymous with 20th-century sculpture.&lt;ref name=edward&gt;Edward Lucie-Smith, ''Visual arts in the 20th century'', Edition illustrated, Publisher Harry N. Abrams, 1997, Original from the University of Michigan, {{ISBN|0-8109-3934-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8109-3934-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, Brâncuși won a lawsuit against the U.S. customs authorities who attempted to value his sculpture as raw metal. The suit led to legal changes permitting the importation of abstract art free of duty.&lt;ref&gt;"Constantin Brâncuși", ''Columbia Encyclopedia'', Sixth Edition, 2008 http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Constantin_Brancusi.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Brâncuși's impact, with his vocabulary of reduction and abstraction, is seen throughout the 1930s and 1940s, and exemplified by artists such as [[Gaston Lachaise]], [[Sir Jacob Epstein]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Alberto Giacometti]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Ásmundur Sveinsson]], [[Julio González (sculptor)|Julio González]], [[Pablo Serrano]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]]&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford dictionary of American art and artists, Author Ann Lee Morgan, Publisher Oxford University Press, 2007,Original from the University of Michigan,{{ISBN|0-19-512878-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-512878-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also by the 1940s abstract sculpture was impacted and expanded by [[Alexander Calder]], [[Len Lye]], [[Jean Tinguely]], and [[Frederick Kiesler]] who were pioneers of [[Kinetic art]].

==Post-1950s==
Since the 1950s [[Modernist]] trends in sculpture both abstract and figurative have dominated the public imagination and the popularity of Modernist sculpture had sidelined the traditional approach. [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] was commissioned to make a [[maquette]] for a huge, {{convert|50|ft|m|sing=on}}-high [[public art|public sculpture]] to be built in [[Chicago]], known usually as the ''[[Chicago Picasso]]''. He approached the project with a great deal of enthusiasm, designing a sculpture which was ambiguous and somewhat controversial. What the figure represents is not known; it could be a bird, a horse, a woman, or a totally abstract shape. The sculpture, one of the most recognizable landmarks in downtown Chicago, was unveiled in 1967. Picasso refused to be paid $100,000 for it, donating it to the people of the city.

In the late 1950s and the 1960s, abstract sculptors began experimenting with a wide array of new materials and different approaches to creating their work. Surrealist imagery, anthropomorphic abstraction, new materials and combinations of new energy sources and varied surfaces and objects became characteristic of much new modernist sculpture. Collaborative projects with landscape designers, architects, and landscape architects expanded the outdoor site and contextual integration. Artists such as [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]], [[Alexander Calder]], [[Jean Tinguely]], [[Richard Lippold]], [[George Rickey]], [[Louise Bourgeois]], and [[Louise Nevelson]] came to characterize the look of modern sculpture.

By the 1960s [[Abstract expressionism]], [[Geometric abstraction]] and [[Minimalism]], which reduces sculpture to its most essential and fundamental features,  predominated. Some works of the period are: the Cubi works of David Smith, and the welded steel works of [[Sir Anthony Caro]], as well as [[welded sculpture]] by a large variety of sculptors, the large scale work of [[John Angus Chamberlain|John Chamberlain]], and environmental installation scale works by [[Mark di Suvero]]. Other Minimalists and [[Postminimalist]]s include [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Donald Judd]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Anne Truitt]], [[Ronald Bladen]], [[Giacomo Benevelli]], [[Arnaldo Pomodoro]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Eva Hesse]], [[Christo]], [[Walter De Maria]], [[Robert Smithson]], and others like [[John Safer]] who added motion and monumentality to the theme of purity of line.&lt;ref&gt;National Air and Space Museum Receives "Ascent" Sculpture for display at Udvar-Hazy Center [http://www.nasm.si.edu/events/pressroomreleaseDetail.cfm?releaseID=49]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; led contemporary abstract sculpture in new directions. During the 1960s and 1970s figurative sculpture by pop artists and modernist artists in stylized forms by artists such as: [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Arman]], [[Leonard Baskin]], [[Ernest Trova]], [[Marisol Escobar]], [[Paul Thek]], [[Manuel Neri]] and others became popular. In the 1980s several artists, among others, exploring figurative sculpture were [[Robert Graham (sculptor)|Robert Graham]] in a classic articulated style and [[Fernando Botero]] bringing his painting's "oversized figures" into monumental sculptures. [[Ceramic art|Ceramic]] sculpture as practiced by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Peter Voulkos]], [[Stephen De Staebler]], [[Kenneth Price]], and others became an important idiom of modern sculpture in the 20th century.

===Contemporary movements===
[[Site-specific art|Site specific]] and [[environmental art]] works are represented by artists: [[Andy Goldsworthy]], [[Walter De Maria]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/show-full/piece/?search=Museum%20Piece&amp;page=&amp;f=Title&amp;object=73.2034 Guggenheim museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104152454/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/show-full/piece/?search=Museum%20Piece&amp;page=&amp;f=Title&amp;object=73.2034 |date=2013-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Long (artist)|Richard Long]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Robert Irwin (artist)|Robert Irwin]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diacenter.org/exhibitions/artistbio/84 Dia Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Rickey]], and [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude]]-led contemporary abstract sculpture in new directions. Artists created [[environmental sculpture]] on expansive sites in the "[[Land Arts of the American West|land art in the American West]]" group of projects. These [[land art]] or "earth art" environmental scale sculpture works exemplified by artists such as [[Robert Smithson]], [[Michael Heizer]], [[James Turrell]] ([[Roden Crater]]). [[Eva Hesse]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Jackie Winsor]], [[Keith Sonnier]], and [[Bruce Nauman]], among others were pioneers of [[Postminimalist]] sculpture.

Also during the 1960s and 1970s artists as diverse as [[Eduardo Paolozzi]], [[Chryssa]], [[Walter De Maria]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], [[Edward Kienholz]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Duane Hanson]], and [[John DeAndrea]] explored abstraction, imagery, and figuration through [[video art]], environment, light sculpture, and [[installation art]] in new ways.

[[Conceptual art]] is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work take precedence over traditional aesthetic and material concerns. Works include ''[[One and Three Chairs]]'', 1965, by [[Joseph Kosuth]], and ''[[An Oak Tree]]'', 1973, by [[Michael Craig-Martin]], and those of [[Joseph Beuys]] and [[James Turrell]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/craig-martin-an-oak-tree-l02262 Tate]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Postmodern art|Postmodern sculpture]] occupies a broader field of activities than Modernist sculpture. [[Rosalind Krauss]] identified sculpture in the expanded field, a series of oppositions around the work's relationship to its environment that describe the various sculpture-like activities that are postmodern sculpture, creating a theoretical explanation that could adequately fit the developments of [[Land art]], [[Minimalism|Minimalist sculpture]], and [[site-specific art]] into the category of "sculpture":

* Site-Construction: the intersection of landscape and architecture 
* Axiomatic Structures: the combination of architecture and not-architecture
* Marked sites: the combination of landscape and not-landscape
* Sculpture: intersection of not-landscape and not-architecture

====Contemporary genres====
Modern sculpture is often created outdoors, as in [[environmental art]] and [[environmental sculpture]], often in full view of spectators. [[Light sculpture]] and [[site-specific art]] also often make use of the environment. Site-specific [[work of art|artwork]] is intentionally created for a specific place. The term was first used in the mid-1970s by sculptors [[Patricia Johanson]], [[Dennis Oppenheim]], [[Athena Tacha]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Frank, "Site Sculpture", ''Art News'', Oct. 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Site specific environmental art was described as a movement by architectural critic Catherine Howett&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Howett, ''New Directions in Environmental Art,'' Landscape Architecture, Jan. 1977&lt;/ref&gt; and [[art critic]] [[Lucy Lippard]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Lippard, ''Art Outdoors, In and Out of the Public Domain,'' Studio International, March–April 1977&lt;/ref&gt; [[Land art]], [[Earthworks (art)|Earthworks]], ([[Earth art]]) is an [[art movement]] that makes specific use of the real landscape to form works of sculpture that are located in and make use of [[nature]] generally in altered form. It is a form of sculpture created in nature, from nature, using materials found in nature like dirt, [[soil]], [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], logs, branches, [[leaf|leaves]], and [[water]], as well as man made materials like [[Chain-link fencing]], [[barbed wire]], [[rope]], [[rubber]], [[glass]], [[concrete]], [[metal]], [[asphalt]], and mineral [[pigments]]. [[Ice sculpture]] is a form of ephemeral sculpture that uses ice as the raw material. It is popular in China, Japan, Canada, Sweden, and Russia. Ice sculptures feature decoratively in some cuisines, especially in Asia. [[Kinetic sculpture]]s are sculptures that are designed to move, which include [[Mobile (sculpture)|mobiles]]. [[Snow sculpture]]s are usually carved out of a single block of snow about 6 to {{convert|15|ft|m}} on each side and weighing about 20–30 tons. The snow is densely packed into a form after having been produced by artificial means or collected from the ground after a snowfall.

[[Sound sculpture]]s take the form of indoor sound installations, outdoor installations such as [[aeolian harp]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, automatons, or be more or less near conventional musical instruments. Sound sculpture is often site-specific. [[Art toys]] have become another format for contemporary artists since the late 1990s, such as those produced by [[Takashi Murakami]] and [[Kid Robot]], designed by [[Michael Lau]], or hand-made by [[Michael Leavitt (artist)|Michael Leavitt]].&lt;ref&gt;"Art Army by Michael Leavitt", '' hypediss.com'' [http://www.hypediss.com/art_army_by_michael_leavitt], December 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Rubin2.jpg|thumb|[[Rubin vase|Rubin's vase]] is an [[optical illusion]] in which the negative space around the vase forms the silhouettes of two faces in profile, a well-known example of [[Figure-ground (perception)|figure-ground reversal by emphasizing that negative space]]]]
[[Image:FedEx Corporation logo.svg|thumb|FedEx logo displays an arrow between letters '''E''' and '''x'''. Not being in full silhouette, the effect is subtle and may not be noticed.]]
'''Negative space''', in [[art]], is the space around and between the subject(s) of an image. Negative space may be most evident when the space around a subject, not the subject itself, forms an interesting or artistically relevant shape, and such space occasionally is used to artistic effect as the "real" subject of an image.

==Overview==
The use of negative space is a key element of artistic composition. The [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word "[[Ma (negative space)|ma]]" is sometimes used for this concept, for example in [[garden design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.gardenweb.com/forums/load/jgard/msg100248139141.html |title=FAQ: 'Ma' and 'Mu' - Japanese Gardens Forum - GardenWeb |publisher=Forums.gardenweb.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Ne.html |title=ArtLex's Ne-Nz page |publisher=Artlex.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990504184946/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Ne.html |archivedate=1999-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfj-online.org/journalPages/MFJ38/iimura.html |title=A Note for MA: Space/Time in the Garden of Ryoan-Ji - Iimura |publisher=Mfj-online.org |date= |accessdate=2009-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a two-tone, black-and-white image, a subject is normally depicted in black and the space around it is left blank (white), thereby forming a [[silhouette]] of the subject. Reversing the tones so that the space around the subject is printed black and the subject itself is left blank, however, causes the negative space to be apparent as it forms shapes around the subject. This is called [[Figure-ground (perception)|figure-ground reversal]].

In [[graphic design]] of printed or displayed materials, where effective communication is the objective, the use of negative space may be crucial. Not only within the [[typography]], but in its placement in relation to the whole. It is the basis of why upper and lower case typography always is more legible than the use of all capital letters.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} Negative space varies around lower case letters, allowing the human eye to distinguish each word rapidly as one distinctive item, rather than having to parse out what the words are in a [[Space (punctuation)|string of letters]] that all present the same overall profile as in all caps. The same judicious use of negative space drives the [[white space (visual arts)|effectiveness of the entire design]]. Because of the long history of the use of black ink on white paper, "[[white space (visual arts)|white space]]" is the term often used in graphics to identify the same separation.

Elements of an image that distract from the intended subject, or in the case of [[photography]], objects in the same [[focal plane]], are not considered negative space. Negative space may be used to depict a subject in a chosen medium by showing everything around the subject, but not the subject itself. Use of negative space will produce a [[silhouette]] of the subject. Most often, negative space is used as a neutral or contrasting background to draw attention to the main subject, which then is referred to as the positive space.

==Use==
Considering and improving the balance between negative space and positive space in a composition is considered by many to enhance the design. This basic, but often overlooked, principle of design gives the eye a "place to rest," increasing the appeal of a composition through subtle means.

The use of negative space in art may be analogous to silence in music, but only when it is juxtaposed with adjacent musical ideas. As such, there is a difference between inert and active silences in music, where the latter is more closely analogous to negative space in art.

'''Ormolu''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɔr|m|əl|uː}} (from French ''or moulu'', signifying ground or pounded gold) is an English term, used since the 18th century for the [[gilding]] technique of applying finely ground, high-carat [[gold]]–[[mercury (element)|mercury]] [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]] to an object of [[bronze]], and for objects finished in this way.

The mercury is driven off in a [[kiln]] leaving behind a gold coating.  The French refer to this technique as "''bronze doré''"; in English, it is known as "'''gilt bronze'''".

==Process==
The manufacture of true ormolu employs a process known as mercury-gilding or [[fire-gilding]], in which a solution of [[Mercury(II) nitrate|mercuric nitrate]] is applied to a piece of [[copper]], [[brass]], or bronze; followed by the application of an [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]] of gold and mercury.  The item is then exposed to extreme heat until the mercury vaporizes and the gold remains, adhering to the metal object.

This process has generally been supplanted by the [[electroplating]] of gold over a [[nickel]] substrate, which is more economical and less dangerous.

==Health risk==
Due to exposure to the harmful mercury fumes, most gilders did not survive beyond 40 years of age. In literature there is a reference from [[John Webster]]:

{{quote|Hang him; a gilder that hath his brains perished with quicksilver is not more cold in the liver|''[[The White Devil]]''}}

After around 1830, legislation in France had outlawed the use of mercury, although it continued to be commonly employed until around 1900 and was still in use around 1960 in very few workshops. To replace ormolu, other gilding techniques (like electroplating from the mid-19th century on) were utilized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://antiqueinstruments.co.uk/ormolu ''Ormolu, definition and origins'': in Antiqueinstruments] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811140333/http://antiqueinstruments.co.uk/ormolu |date=August 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=January 2018}} Electroplating is the most common modern technique.  Ormolu techniques are essentially the same as those used on [[silver]], to produce [[silver-gilt]] (also known as [[vermeil]]).

==Alternatives==
A later substitute of a mixture of metals resembling ormolu was developed in France and called ''pomponne'', though the mix of copper and [[zinc]], sometimes with an addition of [[tin]], is technically a type of brass. From the 19th century the term has been popularized to refer to gilt metal or imitation gold.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopédie méthodique&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilt-bronze is found from [[ancient history|antiquity]] onwards across Eurasia, and especially in [[Chinese art]], where it was always more common than silver-gilt, the opposite of Europe.

==Applications==
Craftsmen principally used ormolu for the decorative mountings of furniture, clocks, lighting devices, and [[porcelain]]. The great French furniture designers and [[Cabinet making|cabinetmakers]], or ''[[ébéniste]]s'', of the 18th and 19th centuries made maximum use of the exquisite gilt-bronze mounts produced by ''[[fondeurs-ciseleurs]]'' (founders and finishers) such as the renowned [[Jacques Caffieri]] (1678–1755), whose finished gilt-bronze pieces were almost as fine as jewelers' work. Ormolu mountings attained their highest artistic and technical development in France.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Similarly fine results could be achieved for lighting devices, such as chandeliers and candelabras, as well as for the ornamental metal mounts applied to clock cases and to ceramic pieces. In the hands of the Parisian ''marchands-merciers'', the precursors of decorators, ormolu or gilt-bronze sculptures were used for bright, non-oxidizing fireplace accessories or for Rococo or Neoclassical mantel-clocks or wall-mounted clock-cases – a specialty of [[Charles Cressent]] (1685–1768) – complemented by rock-crystal drops on gilt-bronze chandeliers and wall-lights.

The bronze mounts were cast by [[lost wax casting]], and then chiseled and [[Repoussé and chasing|chased]] to add detail. [[Rococo]] gilt bronze tends to be finely cast, lightly chiseled, and part-burnished. [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] gilt-bronze is often entirely chiseled and chased with extraordinary skill and delicacy to create finely varied surfaces.

The ormolu technique was extensively used in the [[French Empire mantel clock]]s, reaching its peak during this period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zaandam.klokkenmuseum.info/ Pier Van Leeuwen, ''Empire mantel clocks: A golden dream in timekeepers'' (2003): in the Museum of the Dutch Clock website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese and European porcelains mounted in gilt-bronze were luxury wares that heightened the impact of often-costly and ornamental ceramic pieces sometimes used for display.  Chinese ceramics with gilt-bronze mounts were produced under the guidance of the Parisian ''marchands-merciers'', for only they had access to the ceramics (often purchased in the Netherlands) and the ability to overleap the [[guild]] restrictions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} A few surviving pieces of 16th-century Chinese porcelain subsequently mounted in contemporary European silver-gilt, or ''[[vermeil]]'', show where the foundations of the later fashion lay.

From the late 1760s, [[Matthew Boulton]] (1728–1809) of Birmingham produced English ormolu vases and perfume-burners in the latest Neoclassical style. Though the venture never became a financial success, it produced the finest English ormolu. In the early 19th century fine English ormolu came from the workshops of [[Benjamin Lewis Vulliamy]] (1780–1854).

In France, the tradition of neoclassic ormolu to [[Pierre-Philippe Thomire]] (1751–1843) was continued by [[Lucien-François Feuchère]]. Beurdeley &amp; Cie. produced excellent ormolu in Rococo and Neoclassical styles in Paris, and rococo gilt-bronze is characteristic of the furniture of [[François Linke]].

'''Sensoaesthetics''' is the application of scientific methods to the study of the aesthetic, sensual and emotional aspects of materials.

==Overview==

The purpose of Sensoaesthetics is to understand how people interact with materials, and use that understanding to improve design and incorporate [[multisensory integration]] into the process. Another priority of Sensoaesthetics is to connect the Materials Science community with other disciplines such as Art and the design world, and reverse a perceived eradication of interest in the sensual and aesthetic properties of materials.&lt;ref name="Institute of Making, Research, Sensoaesthetic Materials"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sensoaesthetic Materials|url=http://www.instituteofmaking.org.uk/research/sensoaesthetic-materials|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pure Appl. Chem., Vol. 79, No. 10, pp. 1635–1641, 2007."&gt;{{cite web|last=Mark|first=Miodownik|title=Towards designing new sensoaesthetic materials|url=http://pac.iupac.org/publications/pac/pdf/2007/pdf/7910x1635.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The field has been developed by Materials Science academics, Professor [[Mark Miodownik]] and Dr [[Zoe Laughlin]] at [[King's College London]] and [[University College London|UCL]], and through the work of the Materials Library at King's College, and the [[Institute of Making]].

==Spoon Experiment==

The event was held in May, 2012 at Quilon, a Michelin starred Indian restaurant in London, by Zoe Laughlin and Mark Miodownik. 
The purpose was to study the taste of solid metals, and involved inviting a group of people including chef [[Heston Blumenthal]] and food science writer [[Harold McGee]] to eat Indian food using seven different freshly polished spoons in copper, gold, silver, tin, zinc, chrome and stainless steel.

The tastes of copper and zinc were found to be "bold and assertive, with bitter, metallic tastes". The silver spoon "tasted dull", while the stainless steel had a "faintly metallic flavour". Miodownik observed that the guests were not just tasting the spoons, but eating them, as with every lick they consumed "perhaps a hundred billion atoms".&lt;ref name="Sensoaesthetic Spoons"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ediblegeography.com/sensoaesthetic-spoons/|accessdate=21 March 2014|title=Sensoaesthetic Spoons}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Financial Times"&gt;{{cite web|title=Spoon fed: how cutlery affects your food|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/776ba1d4-93ee-11e1-baf0-00144feab49a.html#axzz1twPxXo4i|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a set of the spoons Laughlin designed were included in the new permanent collection of London's [[Design Museum]] and are on display in the Designer Maker User gallery&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/designer-maker-user|title=Designer Maker User|website=Design Museum|language=en-GB|others=Fabrique &amp; Q42|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:NYC Grand Central Terminal ceiling.jpg|thumb|The [[constellation]] mural at [[Grand Central Terminal]] in [[New York City]] is an example of skyscape art.]]
'''Skyscape art''' depicts representations of the [[sky]], especially in a [[painting]] or [[photograph]]. Skyscapes differ from [[cloudscape (art)|cloudscape]]s because they do not necessarily include [[cloud]]s. Like cloudscape art, skyscape art can also omit any view of land or anything else which might help to suggest scale or orientation. Images called "skyscapes" often do include clouds or land, but these things can also be excluded or kept to a minimum.

The view may be from earth or from a level far above. There is often nothing to suggest scale in the art, unless a bit of [[landscape]] is included or some phenomena such as the depiction of clouds, precipitation, [[rainbow]]s and [[aurorae]]. Some [[artist]]s also depict [[bird]]s, [[insect]]s and other flying objects, as well as manmade [[aircraft]], [[kite]]s and objects such as [[leaves]], and [[balloon]]s.

There are many examples of cloudless skies in painting, [[printmaking]], [[serigraphy]] and photography. 

[[Weather]] is often an important element in the composition of skyscapes.

The sky is really nothing more than the denser gaseous zone of the earth’s [[atmosphere]]. Sky can be depicted as many different [[color]]s, such as a pale [[blue]] or the lack of any color at all, such as the [[night]] sky, which has the appearance of blackness, albeit with a scattering of [[star]]s on a clear night. During the day, the sky is seen as a deep blue due to the [[sunlight]] reflected on the [[air]].

Astronomically speaking, the sky is a celestial sphere–an imaginary dome divided into constellations–where the [[moon]], [[planet]]s, stars and [[sun]] seem to visually move across the sky.

Although artists have long painted the sky it was [[Edward Hopper]] who first showed us the beauty of the skyscape, sans clouds.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} In the 1950s, [[Eric Sloane]] painted many cloudless skyscapes during his stay in [[Taos, New Mexico]].

Another example of a cloudless skyscape artwork is the celestial ceiling [[mural]] at [[Grand Central Terminal]] in [[New York City]].

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="62692">A '''story within a story''' is a [[literary device]] in which one character within a [[narrative]] narrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=David |last=Herman|first2=Manfred |last2=Jahn|first3=Marie-Laure |last3=Ryan|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Narrative Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oX8hmVw_yXYC&amp;pg=PA134|accessdate=30 July 2013|date=13 May 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-45840-0|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Mise en abyme]]'' is the [[French language|French]] term for a similar literary device (also referring to the practice in [[heraldry]] of placing the image of a small shield on a larger shield). A story within a story can be used in all types of narration: [[novel]]s, [[short stories]], [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[television program]]s, [[film]]s, [[poem]]s, [[song]]s, and [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[essays]].  The inner stories are told either simply to entertain or more usually to act as an example to the other characters. In either case the story often has symbolic and psychological significance for the characters in the outer story. There is often some parallel between the two stories, and the fiction of the inner story is used to reveal the truth in the outer story.  Often the stories within a story are used to satirize views, not only in the outer story, but also in the real world.  When a story is told within another instead of being told as part of the plot, it allows the author to play on the reader's perceptions of the characters—the motives and the [[unreliable narrator|reliability of the storyteller]] are automatically in question. Stories within a story may disclose the background of characters or events, tell of myths and legends that influence the plot, or even seem to be extraneous diversions from the plot. In some cases, the story within a story is involved in the action of the plot of the outer story.  In others, the inner story is independent, so that it can either be skipped over or be read separately, although many subtle connections may be lost. Sometimes, the inner story serves as an outlet for discarded [[idea]]s that the author deemed to be of too much merit to leave out completely, something that is somewhat analogous to the inclusion of [[deleted scenes]] with [[DVD]] releases of films.  Often, there is more than one level of internal stories, leading to deeply-nested fiction.

==Frame stories and Anthology Works==
{{main|Frame story}}
The literary device of stories within a story dates back to a device known as a "[[frame story]]", where a supplemental story is used to help tell the main story. Typically, the outer story, or "frame" does not have much matter, and most of the bulk of the work consists of one or more complete stories told by one or more storytellers.

The earliest examples of "frame stories" and "stories within stories" were in ancient Egyptian and [[Indian literature]], such as the Egyptian [[Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=312|editor=[[John Clute]] and [[John Grant (author)|John Grant]]|title=[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]|year=1999|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780312198695}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Indian epics]] like the ''[[Ramayana]]'', ''[[Seven Wise Masters]]'', ''[[Hitopadesha]]'' and ''[[Baital Pachisi|Vikram and the Vampire]]''. In [[Vishnu Sarma]]'s ''[[Panchatantra]]'', an inter-woven series of colorful animal tales are told with one narrative opening within another, sometimes three or four layers deep, and then unexpectedly snapping shut in irregular rhythms to sustain attention. In the epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'', the [[Kurukshetra War]] is narrated by a character in [[Vyasa]]'s ''Jaya'', which itself is narrated by a character in [[Vaisampayana]]'s ''Bharata'', which itself is narrated by a character in Ugrasrava's ''Mahabharata''.

Both ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' by [[Apuleius]] and ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' by [[Ovid]] extend the depths of framing to several degrees. Another early example is the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights''), where the general story is narrated by an unknown narrator, and in this narration the stories are told by [[Scheherazade]]. In many of Scheherazade's narrations there are also [[List of stories within One Thousand and One Nights|stories narrated]], and even in some of these, there are some other stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Burton | first =Richard | authorlink =Richard Francis Burton | title =The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night, Volume 1 |publisher =[[Project Gutenberg]] |date=September 2003 |location = |pages = |url = http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext02/11001108.txt | doi = | id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is "[[The Three Apples]]", a [[murder mystery]] narrated by Scheherazade. Within the story, after the murderer reveals himself, he narrates a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] of events leading up to the murder. Within this flashback, an [[unreliable narrator]] tells a story to mislead the would-be murderer, who later discovers that he was misled after another character narrates the truth to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992 |isbn=90-04-09530-6|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the story concludes, the "[[s:Tale of Núr al-Dín Alí and his Son|Tale of Núr al-Dín Alí and his Son]]" is narrated within it.  This perennially popular work can be traced back to [[Arabic literature|Arabic]], [[Persian literature|Persian]], and Indian storytelling traditions. 

[[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' has a deeply nested frame story structure, that features the narration of an Arctic explorer, who records the narration of Victor Frankenstein, who recounts the narration of his creation, who narrates the story of a cabin dwelling family he secretly observes.  Similarly, [[Roald Dahl]]'s story ''[[The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar]]'' is about a rich bachelor who finds an essay written by someone who learnt to "see" playing cards from the reverse side. The full text of this essay is included in the story, and itself includes a lengthy sub-story told as a true experience by one of the essay's protagonists, Imhrat Khan.

[[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' and [[Boccacio]]'s [[Decameron]] are also classic frame stories.  In [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'', the characters tell tales suited to their personalities and tell them in ways that highlight their personalities. The noble knight tells a noble story, the boring character tells a very dull tale, and the rude miller tells a smutty tale. [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' too makes use of this device; [[Odysseus]]' adventures at sea are all narrated by Odysseus to the court of king [[Alcinous]] in [[Scheria]]. Other shorter tales, many of them false, account for much of the ''Odyssey''.  Many modern children's story collections are essentially [[anthology]] works connected by this device, such as [[Arnold Lobel]]'s ''Mouse Tales'', [[Paula Fox]]'s ''The Little Swineherd'', and Phillip and Hillary Sherlock's ''Ears and Tails and Common Sense''.

A well-known modern example of framing is ''[[The Princess Bride]]'' (both the book and the movie). In the movie, a grandfather is reading the story of "The Princess Bride" to his grandson. In the book, a more detailed frame story has a father editing a much longer (but fictive) work for his son, creating his own "Good Parts Version" (as the book called it) by leaving out all the parts that would bore a young boy. Both the book and the movie assert that the central story is from a book called "The Princess Bride" by a nonexistent author named [[William_Goldman#Autobiographical_fiction|S. Morgenstern]].
 
In the Welsh novel, [[Aelwyd F'Ewythr Robert]] (1852) by [[Gwilym Hiraethog]] a visitor to a farm in north Wales tells the story of [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]] to those gathered around the hearth.

Sometimes a frame story exists in the same setting as the main story. On the television series ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'', each episode was framed as though it were being told by [[Indiana Jones|Indy]] when he was older (usually acted by [[George Hall (actor)|George Hall]], but once by [[Harrison Ford]]).  The same device of an adult narrator representing the older version of a young protagonist is used in the films ''[[Stand By Me (film)|Stand By Me]]'' and ''[[A Christmas Story]]'', and the television show ''[[The Wonder Years]]''.

====Frame Stories in Music====

In [[The Amory Wars]], a tale told through the music of [[Coheed and Cambria]], tells a story for the first two albums but reveals that the story is being actively written by a character called the Writer in the third. During the album, the Writer delves into his own story and kills one of the characters, much to the dismay of the main character.

The critically acclaimed [[Beatles]] album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' is presented as a stage show by the fictional eponymous band, and one of its songs, "A Day in the Life" is in the form of a story within a dream. Similarly, the [[Fugees]] album ''[[The Score (Fugees album)|The Score]]'' is presented as the soundtrack to a fictional movie, as are several other notable [[concept albums]], while [[Wyclef Jean]]'s ''[[Wyclef_Jean_Presents_The_Carnival|The Carnival]]'' is presented as testimony at a trial.  The majority of [[Ayreon]]'s albums outline a sprawling, loosely interconnected science fiction narrative, as do the albums of [[Janelle Monae]].

==Examples of nested stories by type==
===Nested Books===

In his 1895 [[historical novel]] ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', [[Bolesław Prus]] introduces a number of stories within the story, ranging in length from [[vignette (literature)|vignettes]] to full-blown stories, many of them drawn from [[ancient Egypt]]ian texts, that further the plot, illuminate [[Character (arts)|characters]], and even inspire the fashioning of individual characters.  [[Jan Potocki]]'s ''[[The Manuscript Found in Saragossa]]'' (1797–1805) has an interlocking structure with stories-within-stories reaching several levels of depth.

The [[provenance]] of the story is sometimes explained internally, as in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], which depicts the [[Red Book of Westmarch]] (a story-internal version of the book itself) as a history compiled by several of the characters. The [[subtitle (titling)|subtitle]] of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' ("There and Back Again") is depicted as part of a rejected title of this book within a book, and ''The Lord of the Rings'' is a part of the final title.&lt;ref name = "havens"&gt;{{ME-ref|rotk|"The Grey Havens"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of an interconnected inner story is "The Mad Trist" in [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s ''[[The Fall of the House of Usher|Fall of the House of Usher]]'', where through somewhat mystical means the narrator's reading of the story within a story influences the reality of the story he has been telling, so that what happens in "The Mad Trist" begins happening in "The Fall of the House of Usher". Also, in ''[[Don Quixote]]'' by [[Cervantes]], there are many stories within the story that influence the hero's actions (there are others that even the author himself admits are purely digressive).

A commonly independently [[anthology|anthologised]] story is "[[The Grand Inquisitor]]" by [[Dostoevsky]] from his long [[psychological novel]] ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'', which is told by one brother to another to explain, in part, his view on religion and morality. It also, in a succinct way, dramatizes many of Dostoevsky's interior conflicts.

An example of a "bonus material" style inner story is the chapter "The Town Ho's Story" in [[Herman Melville]]'s novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]''; that chapter tells a fully formed story of an exciting [[mutiny]] and contains many plot ideas that Melville had conceived during the early stages of writing ''Moby-Dick''—ideas originally intended to be used later in the novel—but as the writing progressed, these plot ideas eventually proved impossible to fit around the characters that Melville went on to [[Characterization|create and develop]]. Instead of discarding the ideas altogether, Melville wove them into a coherent short story and had the character Ishmael demonstrate his eloquence and intelligence by [[story telling|telling the story]] to his impressed friends. 

With the rise of [[Modernist literature|literary modernism]], writers experimented with ways in which multiple narratives might nest imperfectly within each other. A particularly ingenious example of nested narratives is [[James Merrill]]'s 1974 [[Modernist poetry in English|modernist poem]] "[[Lost in Translation (poem)|Lost in Translation]]".

In [[Rabih Alameddine]]'s novel ''The Hakawati'', or ''The Storyteller'', the protagonist describes coming home to the funeral of his father, one of a long line of traditional Arabic storytellers. Throughout the narrative, the author becomes hakawati (an Arabic word for a teller of traditional tales) himself, weaving the tale of the story of his own life and that of his family with folkloric versions of tales from Qur'an, the Old Testament, Ovid, and One Thousand and One Nights. Both the tales he tells of his family (going back to his grandfather) and the embedded folk tales, themselves embed other tales, often 2 or more layers deep.

In [[Sue Townsend]]'s ''[[Adrian Mole: The Wilderness Years]]'', [[Adrian Mole|Adrian]] writes a book entitled ''Lo! The Flat Hills Of My Homeland'', in which the main character, Jake Westmorland, writes a book called ''Sparg of Kronk'', whose eponymous character, Sparg, writes a book with no language.

Dreams are a common way of including stories inside stories, and can sometimes go several levels deep.  Both the book ''The Arabian Nightmare'' and the curse of "eternal waking" from the [[Neil Gaiman]] series ''The Sandman'' feature an endless series of waking from one dream into another dream.  In [[Charles Maturin]]'s novel ''[[Melmoth the Wanderer]]'', the use of vast stories-within-stories creates a sense of dream-like quality in the reader.

=====Religion and Philosophy=====

This structure is also found in classic religious and philosophical texts.  The structure of ''[[The Symposium]]'' and ''[[Phaedo]]'', attributed to [[Plato]], is of a story within a story within a story.  In the Christian [[Bible]], the [[gospels]] are retellings of stories from the life and ministry of [[Jesus]].  However, they also include within them the stories ([[parable|parables]]) that Jesus told.  In more modern philosophical work, [[Jostein Gaarder]]'s books often feature this device. Examples are ''The Solitaire Mystery'', where the protagonist receives a small book from a baker, in which the baker tells the story of a sailor who tells the story of another sailor, and ''[[Sophie's World]]'' about a girl who is actually a character in a book that is being read by Hilde, a girl in another dimension. Later on in the book Sophie questions this idea, and realizes that Hilde too could be a character in a story that in turn is being read by another.

=====Nested science fiction=====
The experimental modernist works that incorporate multiple narratives into one story are quite often science-fiction or science fiction influenced.  These include most of the various novels written by the American author [[Kurt Vonnegut]]. Vonnegut includes the recurring character [[Kilgore Trout]] in many of his novels. Trout acts as the mysterious [[science fiction]] writer who enhances the morals of the novels through plot descriptions of his stories. Books such as ''[[Breakfast of Champions]]'' and ''[[God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater]]'' are sprinkled with these plot descriptions.  [[Stanisław Lem]]'s ''Tale of the Three Storytelling Machines of King Genius'' from ''[[The Cyberiad]]'' has several levels of storytelling. All levels tell stories of the same person, Trurl.  

''[[House of Leaves]]'' is the tale of a man who finds a manuscript telling the story of a documentary that may or may not have ever existed, contains multiple layers of plot. The book includes footnotes and letters that tell their own stories only vaguely related to the events in the main narrative of the book, and footnotes for fake books. 

[[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s later books (''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]'', ''[[The Cat Who Walks Through Walls]]'' and ''[[To Sail Beyond the Sunset]]'') propose the idea that every real universe is a fiction in another universe. This [[World as Myth|hypothesis]] enables many writers who are characters in the books to interact with their own creations.  [[Margaret Atwood]]'s novel ''[[The Blind Assassin]]'' is interspersed with excerpts from a novel written by one of the main characters; the novel-within-a-novel itself contains a [[science fiction]] story written by one of ''that'' novel's characters. 

In [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''[[The Man in the High Castle]]'', each character comes into interaction with a book called ''The Grasshopper Lies Heavy'', which was written by the Man in the High Castle. As Dick's novel details a world in which the [[Axis Powers of World War II]] had [[Axis victory in World War II|succeeded in dominating the known world]], the novel within the novel details an alternative to this history in which the Allies overcome the Axis and bring stability to the world – a victory which itself is quite different from our history.  

In ''[[Red Orc's Rage]]'' by [[Philip J. Farmer]] a doubly [[recursive method]] is used to interwine its fictional layers. This novel is part of a science-fiction series, the ''[[World of Tiers]]''. Farmer collaborated in the writing of this novel with an American psychiatrist, Dr. A. James Giannini. Dr. Giannini had previously used the World of Tiers series in treating patients in group therapy. During these therapeutic sessions, the content and process of the text and novelist was discussed rather than the lives of the patients. In this way subconscious defenses could be circumvented. Farmer took the real life case-studies and melded these with adventures of his characters in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. J. |last=Giannini |title=Use of fiction in therapy |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=18 |issue=7 |pages=56–57 |year=2001 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/articles/use-fiction-therapy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Quantum Leap (TV series)|Quantum Leap]]'' novel ''[[Knights Of The Morningstar]]'' also features a character who writes a book by that name.  In [[Matthew Stover]]'s novel ''[[Shatterpoint]]'', the protagonist [[Mace Windu]] narrates the story within his journal, while the main story is being told from the [[third-person limited]] point of view.  

Several ''[[Star Trek]]'' tales are stories or events within stories, such as [[Gene Roddenberry]]'s [[novelization]] of ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', [[J. A. Lawrence]]'s ''[[Mudd's Angels]]'', [[John M. Ford]]'s ''[[The Final Reflection]]'', [[Margaret Wander Bonanno]]'s ''[[Strangers from the Sky]]'' (which adopts the conceit that it is book from the future by an author called Gen Jaramet-Sauner), and J. R. Rasmussen's "Research" in the anthology ''[[Star Trek: Strange New Worlds]] II''. [[Steven Barnes]]'s novelization of "[[Far Beyond the Stars]]" partners with [[Greg Cox (writer)|Greg Cox]]'s ''[[The Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonien Singh]]'' (Volume Two) to tell us that the story "Far Beyond the Stars"—and, by extension, all of ''Star Trek'' itself—is the creation of 1950s writer Benny Russell.

The book ''[[Cloud Atlas (novel)|Cloud Atlas]]'' (later adapted into a film by [[The Wachowskis|The Wachowkis]] and [[Tom Tykwer]]) consisted of six interlinked stories nested inside each other in a Russian doll fashion. The first story (that of Adam Ewing in the 1850s befriending an escaped slave) is interrupted halfway through and revealed to be part of a journal being read by composer Robert Frobisher in 1930s Belgium. His own story of working for a more famous composer is told in a series of letters to his lover Rufus Sixsmith, which are interrupted halfway through and revealed to be in the possession of an investigative journalist named Luisa Rey and so on. Each of the first five tales are interrupt in the middle, with the sixth tale being told in full, before the preceding five tales are finished in reverse order. Each layer of the story either challenges the veracity of the previous layer, or is challenged by the succeeding layer. Presuming each layer to be a true telling within the overall story, a chain of events is created linking Adam Ewing's embrace of the abolitionist movement in the 1850s to the religious redemption of a post apocalyptic tribal man over a century after the fall of modern civilization. The characters in each nested layer take inspiration or lessons from the stories of their predecessors in a manner that validates a belief stated in the sixth tale that "Our lives are not our own. We are bound to others, past and present and by each crime, and every kindness, we birth our future."

====Play or film within a book====
''[[The Crying of Lot 49]]'' by [[Thomas Pynchon]] has several characters seeing a play called ''The Courier's Tragedy'' by the fictitious [[English Renaissance theatre|Jacobean]] [[playwright]] Richard Wharfinger. The events of the play broadly mirror those of the novel and give the main character, Oedipa Maas, a greater context with which to consider her predicament; the play concerns a feud between two rival mail distribution companies, which appears to be ongoing to the present day, and in which, if this is the case, Oedipa has found herself involved. As in ''[[Hamlet]]'', the director makes changes to the original script; in this instance, a couplet that was added, possibly by religious zealots intent on giving the play extra moral gravity, are said only on the night that Oedipa sees the play. From what Pynchon tells us, this is the only mention in the play of Thurn and Taxis' rivals' name—Trystero—and it is the seed for the conspiracy that unfurls.  A significant portion of [[Walter Moers]]' ''Labyrinth of Dreaming Books'' is an [[ekphrasis]] on the subject of an epic puppet theater presentation.  Another example is found in [[Samuel Delany]]'s ''[[Trouble on Triton]]'', which features a theater company that produces elaborate staged spectacles for randomly selected single-person audiences.  Plays produced by the "Caws of Art" theater company also feature in Russell Hoban's modern fable, [[The Mouse and His Child]].

In [[Manuel Puig]]'s ''[[Kiss of the Spider Woman (novel)| Kiss of the Spider Woman]]'', ekphrases on various old movies, some real, and some fictional, make up a substantial portion of the narrative.  In [[Paul Russell (novelist)|Paul Russell]]'s ''Boys of Life'', descriptions of movies by director/antihero Carlos (loosely inspired by controversial director [[Pier Paulo Pasolini]]) provide a narrative counterpoint and add a touch of surrealism to the main narrative.  They additionally raise the question of whether works of artistic genius justify or atone for the sins and crimes of their creators.

===Nested plays===
This dramatic device was probably first used by [[Thomas Kyd]] in ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'' around 1587, where the play is presented before an audience of two of the characters, who comment upon the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The action and characters in ''The Murder'' mirror the murder of Hamlet's father in the main action, and Prince Hamlet writes additional material to emphasize this. Hamlet wishes to provoke the murderer, his uncle, and sums this up by saying "the play's the thing wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king." Hamlet calls this new play ''The Mouse-trap'' (a title that [[Agatha Christie]] later took for the long-running play ''[[The Mousetrap]]''). The play ''I Hate Hamlet'' and the movie ''[[A Midwinter's Tale]]'' are about a production of ''Hamlet'', which in turn includes a production of ''The Murder of Gonzago'', as does the Hamlet-based film ''[[Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead (film)|Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' which even features a third-level puppet theatre version within their play. Similarly, in [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Seagull]]'' there are specific allusions to ''[[Hamlet]]'': in the first act a son stages a play to impress his mother, a professional actress, and her new lover; the mother responds by comparing her son to Hamlet. Later he tries to come between them, as Hamlet had done with his mother and her new husband. The tragic developments in the plot follow in part from the scorn the mother shows for her son's play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearce|first=Richard|editor=Miles, Patrick|title=Chekhov on the British stage  |year=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|page=220|chapter=Chekhov into English: the case of 'The Seagull'|quote=A dominant motif in the play is the recurrent Hamlet theme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare adopted the play-within-a-play device for many of his other plays as well, including ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''and ''[[Love's Labours Lost]]''. Almost the whole of ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' is a play-within-a-play, presented to convince [[Christopher Sly]], a drunken tinker, that he is a nobleman watching a private performance, but the device has no relevance to the plot (unless Katharina's subservience to her "lord" in the last scene is intended to strengthen the deception against the tinker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aspinall|first=Dana |title=The Taming of the Shrew|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=2001|page=19|chapter=The play and the critics|isbn=978-0-8153-3515-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and is often dropped in modern productions. The musical ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]'' is about the production of a [[List of Fictional Musicals|fictitious musical]], ''The Taming of the Shrew,'' based on the [[The Taming of the Shrew|Shakespeare play of the same name]], and features several scenes from it.  ''[[Pericles Prince of Tyre|Pericles]]'' draws in part on the 14th century ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' (itself a frame story) by [[John Gower]] and Shakespeare has the ghost of Gower "assume man's infirmities" to introduce his work to the contemporary audience and comment on the action of the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buchanan|first=Judith|title=Shakespeare—Four late plays|year=2001|publisher=Wordsworth Editions|location=Ware, England|isbn=1-84022-104-6|pages=5–8|chapter=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Francis Beaumont]]'s ''[[Knight of the Burning Pestle]]'' (ca. 1608) a supposed common citizen from the audience, actually a "planted" actor,  condemns the play that has just started and "persuades" the players to present something about a shopkeeper. The citizen's "apprentice" then acts, pretending to extemporise,  in the rest of the play. This is a satirical tilt at Beaumont's playwright contemporaries and their current fashion for offering plays about London life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gurr|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Gurr|title=The Knight of the Burning Pestle|year=1968|publisher=Oliver and Boyd|location=Edinburgh|isbn=0050015710|pages=2–6|chapter=Critical introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opera ''[[Pagliacci]]'' is about a troupe of actors who perform a play about marital infidelity that mirrors their own lives, and composer [[Richard Rodney Bennett]] and [[playwright]]-[[librettist]] [[Beverley Cross]]'s ''[[The Mines of Sulphur]]'' features a ghostly troupe of actors who perform a play about murder that similarly mirrors the lives of their hosts, from whom they depart, leaving them with the plague as nemesis. And John Adams' ''Nixon in China'' (1985-7) features a surreal version of Madam Mao's ''Red Detachment of Women'' to extraordinary effect, illuminating the ascendance of human values over the disillusionment of high politics in the meeting.

In [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''[[The Caucasian Chalk Circle]],'' a play is staged as a [[parable]] to villagers in the [[Soviet Union]] to justify the re-allocation of their farmland: the tale describes how a child is awarded to a servant-girl rather than its natural mother, an aristocrat, as the woman most likely to care for it well. This kind of play-within-a-play, which appears at the beginning of the main play and acts as a 'frame' for it, is called an ''[[Induction (play)|'induction']]''. Brecht's one-act play ''[[The Elephant Calf]]'' (1926) is a play-within-a-play performed in the foyer of the theatre during his ''[[Man Equals Man]]''.

In [[Jean Giraudoux]]'s play [[Ondine (play)|''Ondine'']], all of act two is a series of scenes within scenes, sometimes two levels deep. This increases the [[dramatic tension]] and also makes more poignant the inevitable failure of the relationship between the [[Human|mortal]] Hans and [[water sprite]] Ondine.

''[[The Two-Character Play]]'' by [[Tennessee Williams]] has a concurrent double plot with the convention of a play within a play. Felice and Clare are siblings and are both actor/producers touring ‘The Two-Character Play.’ They have supposedly been abandoned by their crew and have been left to put on the play by themselves. The characters in the play are also brother and sister and are also named Clare and Felice.

''[[The Mysteries (play)|The Mysteries]]'', a modern reworking of the medieval [[mystery play]]s, remains faithful to its roots by having the modern actors play the sincere, naïve tradesmen and women as they take part in the original performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Normington|first=Katie |title=Modern mysteries: contemporary productions of medieval English cycle dramas|publisher=Boydell and Brewer|location=Melton, Suffolk, England|date=October 2007|page=86|isbn=978-1-84384-128-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, a play might be about the production of a play, and include the performance of all or part of the play, as in ''[[Noises Off]]'', ''[[A Chorus of Disapproval (play)|A Chorus of Disapproval]]'' or ''[[Lilies (play)|Lilies]]''.  Similarly, the musical ''[[Man of La Mancha]]'' presents the story of Don Quixote as an impromptu play staged in prison by ''[[Don Quixote|Quixote]]'''s author, [[Miguel de Cervantes]].

In most stagings of the musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'', which include the song "Growltiger's Last Stand" — a recollection of an old play by Gus the Theatre Cat — the character of Lady [[Griddlebone]] sings "The Ballad of Billy McCaw". (However, many productions of the show omit "Growltiger's Last Stand", and "The Ballad of Billy McCaw" has at times been replaced with a mock aria, so this metastory isn't always seen.) Depending on the production, there is another musical scene called The Awful Battle of the Pekes and the Pollices where the Jellicles put on a show for their leader. In ''[[Lestat: The Musical]]'', there are three play within a plays. First, when Lestat visits his childhood friend, Nicolas, who works in a theater, where he discovers his love for theater; and two more when the Theater of the Vampires perform. One is used as a plot mechanism to explain the vampire god, Marius, which sparks an interest in Lestat to find him.

A play within a play also occurs in the musical ''[[The King and I]]'', where Princess Tuptim and the royal dancers give a performance of ''Small House of Uncle Thomas'' (or ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'') to their English guests. The play mirrors Tuptim's situation, as she wishes to run away from slavery to be with her lover, Lun Tha.

In stagings of [[Dina Rubina]]'s play ''Always the Same Dream'', the story is about staging a school play based on a poem by [[Pushkin]].

Joseph Heller's 1967 play ''[[We Bombed in New Haven]]'' is about actors engaged in a play about military airmen; the actors themselves become at times unsure whether they are actors or actual airmen.

The 1937 musical [[Babes in Arms]] is about a group of kids putting on a musical to raise money.  The central plot device was retained for the popular 1939 film version with [[Judy Garland]] and [[Mickey Rooney]].  A similar plot was recycled for the films [[White Christmas (film)|White Christmas]] and [[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]].

===Nested films===

[[TV Tropes]] maintains a list of feature films that feature this plot device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ShowWithinAShow/LiveActionFilms |title=Live-Action Films / Show Within A Show |publisher=TV Tropes |date= |accessdate=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1952) is frequently listed as the earliest example, although there are antecedents in silent cinema such as ''[[Mabel's Dramatic Career]]'' (1913).

The [[François Truffaut]] film ''[[Day for Night (film)|Day for Night]]'' is about the making of a fictitious movie called ''Meet Pamela'' (''Je vous présente Pamela'') and shows the interactions of the actors as they are making this movie about a woman who falls for her husband's father. The story of ''Pamela'' involves lust, betrayal, death, sorrow, and change, events that are mirrored in the experiences of the actors portrayed in ''Day for Night''.  There are a wealth of other movies that revolve around the film industry itself, even if not centering exclusively on one nested film.  These include the darkly satirical classic ''[[Sunset Boulevard]]'' about an aging star and her parasitic victim, and the Coen Brothers' farce ''[[Hail, Caesar!]]''

The script to [[Karel Reisz]]'s movie ''[[The French Lieutenant's Woman (film)|The French Lieutenant's Woman]]'' (1981), written by [[Harold Pinter]], is a film-within-a-film adaptation of [[John Fowles]]'s book. In addition to the Victorian love story of the book, Pinter creates a present-day background story that shows a love affair between the main actors.

In [[Buster Keaton]]'s ''[[Sherlock, Jr.]]'', Keaton's protagonist actually enters into a film while it is playing in a cinema, as does the main character in the [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] children's film ''[[The Last Action Hero]]''.  A similar device is used in the seminal music video ''[[Take on me]]'' by [[A-ha]], which features a young woman entering a cartoon universe. Conversely, [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Purple Rose of Cairo]]'' is about a movie character exiting the movie to interact with the real world.  Allen's earlier film ''[[Play_It_Again,_Sam_(film)|Play it Again, Sam]]'' featured liberal use of characters, dialogue and clips from the film classic ''[[Casablanca_(film)|Casablanca]]'' as a central device.

The 2002 [[Pedro Almodóvar]] film ''[[Talk to Her]]'' (''Hable con ella'') has the chief character Benigno tell a story called ''The Shrinking Lover'' to Alicia, a long-term comatose patient whom Benigno, a male nurse, is assigned to care for. The film presents ''The Shrinking Lover'' in the form of a black-and-white silent melodrama. To prove his love to a scientist girlfriend, ''The Shrinking Lover'' protagonist drinks a potion that makes him progressively smaller. The resulting seven-minute scene, which is readily intelligible and enjoyable as a stand-alone short subject, is considerably more overtly comic than the rest of ''Talk to Her''—the protagonist climbs giant breasts as if they were rock formations and even ventures his way inside a (compared to him) gigantic vagina. Critics have noted that ''The Shrinking Lover'' essentially is a sex metaphor. Later in ''Talk to Her,'' the comatose Alicia is discovered to be pregnant and Benigno is sentenced to jail for rape. ''The Shrinking Lover'' was named [https://web.archive.org/web/20110728025551/http://skandies.org/skandies02.html Best Scene of 2002] in the ''Skandies'', an annual survey of online cinephiles and critics invited each year by critic Mike D'Angelo.

''[[Tropic Thunder]]'' (2008) is a [[comedy film]] revolving around a group of [[prima donna]] actors making a [[Vietnam War]] film (itself also named "Tropic Thunder") when their fed-up writer and director decide to abandon them in the middle of the jungle, forcing them to fight their way out.  The concept was perhaps inspired by the 1986 comedy [[Three Amigos]], where three washed-up silent film stars are expected to live out a real-life version of their old hit movies.  The same idea of life being forced to imitate art was also reprised in the [[Star Trek]] parody [[Galaxy Quest]].

The first episode of the [[anime]] series ''[[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (anime)|The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya]]'' consists almost entirely of a poorly made film that the protagonists created, complete with [[Kyon]]'s typical, sarcastic commentary.

[[Chuck Jones]]'s 1953 [[cartoon]] ''[[Duck Amuck]]'' shows [[Daffy Duck]] trapped in a cartoon that an unseen animator repeatedly manipulates. At the end, it is revealed that the whole cartoon was being controlled by [[Bugs Bunny]]. The ''Duck Amuck'' plot was essentially replicated in one of Jones' later cartoons, ''[[Rabbit Rampage]]'' (1955), in which Bugs Bunny turns out to be the victim of the sadistic animator ([[Elmer Fudd]]). A similar plot was also included in an episode of ''[[Baby Looney Tunes]]'', in which Bugs was the victim, Daffy was the animator, and it was made on a computer instead of a pencil and paper. In 2007, the ''Duck Amuck'' sequence was parodied on ''[[Drawn Together]]'' ("Nipple Ring-Ring Goes to Foster Care").

All feature-length films by [[Jörg Buttgereit]] except ''[[Schramm (film)|Schramm]]'' feature a film within the film. In ''[[Nekromantik]]'', the protagonist goes to the cinema to see the fictional slasher film ''Vera''. In ''[[Der Todesking]]'' one of the character watches a video of the fictional Nazi exploitation film ''Vera - Todesengel der Gestapo'' and in ''[[Nekromantik 2]]'', the characters go to see a movie called ''Mon dejeuner avec Vera'' which is a parody of [[Louis Malle]]'s ''[[My Dinner with André]]''

[[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'' depicts a [[Nazi propaganda]] film called ''[[Nation's Pride]]'', which glorifies a soldier in the German army.  ''Nation's Pride'' is directed by [[Eli Roth]].

[[Joe Dante]]'s ''[[Matinee (1993 film)|Matinee]]'' depicts ''Mant'', an early-'60s sci-fi/horror movie about a man who turns into an [[ant]].  In one scene, the protagonists see a [[Disney]]-style family movie called ''The Shook-Up Shopping Cart''.

====Story within a Film====
The 2002 martial arts epic [[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]] presented the same narrative several different times, as recounted by different storytellers, but with both factual and aesthetic differences.  Similarly, in the whimsical 1988 [[Terry Gilliam]] film [[The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]], and the 2003 [[Tim Burton]] film [[Big Fish]], the bulk of the film is a series of stories told by an (extremely) unreliable narrator.  In the 2006 Tarsem film ''[[The Fall (2006 film)|The Fall]]'', an injured silent-movie stuntman tells [[heroic fantasy]] stories to a little girl with a broken arm to pass time in the hospital, which the film visualizes and presents with the stuntman's voice becoming voiceover narration. The fantasy tale bleeds back into and comments on the film's "present-tense" story. There are often incongruities based on the fact that the stuntman is an American and the girl Persian—the stuntman's voiceover refers to "Indians," “a squaw” and “a teepee,” but the visuals show a Bollywood-style devi and a Taj Mahal-like castle.  The same conceit of an unreliable narrator was used to very different effect in the 1995 crime drama [[The Usual Suspects]] (which garnered an Oscar for [[Kevin Spacey]]'s performance).

The seminal 1950 Japanese film ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'', based on the Japanese short story "[[In a Grove]]" (1921), utilizes the [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]-within-a-flashback technique. The story unfolds in flashback as the four witnesses in the story—the bandit, the murdered [[samurai]], his wife, and the nameless woodcutter—recount the events of one afternoon in a grove. But it is also a flashback within a flashback, because the accounts of the witnesses are being retold by a woodcutter and a priest to a ribald commoner as they wait out a rainstorm in a ruined gatehouse.

The movie ''[[Inception]]'' has a deeply nested structure that is itself part of the setting, as the characters travel deeper and deeper into layers of dreams within dreams.  Similarly, in the beginning of the music video for the [[Michael Jackson]] song "[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]", the heroine is terrorized by her monster boyfriend in what turns out to be a movie within a dream.  The film ''[[Grand Budapest Hotel]]'' has four layers of narration; starting with a young girl at the author's memorial reading his book, it cuts to the old author in 1985 telling of an incident in 1968 when he, as a young author, stayed at the hotel and met the owner, old Zero. He was then told the story of young Zero and M Gustave, from 1932, which makes up most of the narrative.

====Play within a film====
The 2001 film ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' features a [[List of Fictional Musicals|fictitious musical]] within a film, called "Spectacular Spectacular". The 1942 [[Ernst Lubitsch]] comedy ''[[To Be or Not to Be (1942 film)|To Be or Not to Be]]'' confuses the audience in the opening scenes with a play, "The Naughty Nazis", about Adolf Hitler which appears to be taking place within the actual plot of the film. Thereafter, the acting company players serve as the protagonists of the film and frequently use acting/costumes to deceive various characters in the film. ''[[Hamlet]]'' also serves as an important throughline in the film, as suggested by the title. [[Laurence Olivier]] sets the opening scene of his 1944 film of ''[[Henry V (1944 film)|Henry V]]'' in the [[Green room|tiring room]] of the old [[Globe Theatre]] as the actors prepare for their roles on stage. The early part of the film follows the actors in these "stage" performances and only later does the action almost imperceptibly expand to the full realism of the [[Battle of Agincourt]]. By way of increasingly more artificial sets (based on mediaeval paintings) the film finally returns to The Globe.  Mel Brook's film, ''[[The Producers (1968 film)|The Producers]]'', revolves around a scheme to make money by producing a disastrously bad Broadway musical, ''Springtime For Hitler.''  Ironically the film itself was later made into its own Broadway musical (although a more intentionally successful one). The [[Outkast]] music video for the song "Roses" is a short film about a high school musical.

The main plot device in ''[[Repo! The Genetic Opera]]'' is an opera which is going to be held the night of the events of the movie. All of the principal characters of the film play a role in the opera, though the audience watching the opera is unaware that some of the events portrayed are more than drama.

In ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]'',  the middle-schoolers put on a play of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.

The 1990 biopic [[Korczak (film)|Korczak]], about the last days of a Jewish children's orphanage in Nazi occupied Poland, features an amateur production of [[Rabindranath Tagore]]'s ''The Post Office'', which was selected by the orphanage's visionary leader as a way of preparing his charges for their own impending death.  That same production is also featured in the stage play ''Korczak's Children,'' also inspired by the same historical events.

====TV Show within a Film====
The 1973 film adaptation&lt;ref&gt;[[The National Health (film)|''The National Health'' (film)]]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Peter Nichols]]'s 1969 play,&lt;ref&gt;[[The National Health (play)]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The National Health (play)|The National Health]]'' features a send-up of a typical American hospital [[soap-opera]] being shown on a television situated in an underfunded, unmistakably [[United Kingdom|British]] [[National Health Service|NHS]] hospital.

The Jim Carey film [[The Truman Show]] is about a person who grows to adulthood without ever realizing that he is the unwitting hero of the immersive eponymous television show.

===Nested video games===
{{main|Minigame}}

The first example of a video game within a video game is almost certainly [[Tim Stryker]]'s 80s era text-only game Fazuul (also the world's first online multiplayer game), in which one of the objects that the player can create is a minigame.  Another early use of this trope was in [[Cliff Johnson (game designer)|Cliff Johnson]]'s 1987 hit [[The Fool's Errand]], a thematically linked narrative puzzle game, in which several of the puzzles were semi-independent games played against NPCs.

''[[Power Factor (video game)|Power Factor]]'' has been cited as a rare example of a video game in which the entire concept is a video game within a video game: The player takes on the role of a character who is playing a "Virtual Reality Simulator", in which he in turn takes on the role of the hero Redd Ace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=ProReview: Power Factor |magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=55|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=April 1993 |page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[.hack]]'' franchise also gives the concept a central role. It features a narrative in which internet advancements have created an MMORPG franchise called The World. Protagonists Kite and [[Haseo]] try to uncover the mysteries of the events surrounding The World. Characters in .hack are self-aware that they are video game characters.

More commonly, however, the video game within a video game device takes the form of mini-games that are non-plot oriented, and optional to the completion of the game. For example, in the ''[[Yakuza (series)|Yakuza]]'' and ''[[Shenmue (series)|Shenmue]]'' franchises, there are playable arcade machines featuring other Sega games that are scattered throughout the game world.

In ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' there are several video games that can be played in an arcade in the Gold Saucer theme park. In ''[[Animal Crossing]]'', the player can acquire individual NES emulations through various means and place them within their house, where they are playable in their entirety. When placed in the house, the games take the form of a [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. In ''[[Fallout 4]]'', the protagonist can find several cartridges throughout the wasteland that can be played on his pip-boy (an electronic device that exists only in the world of the game) or any terminal computer.

====TV show within a video game====
In the [[Remedy Entertainment|Remedy]] video game title ''[[Max Payne (video game)|Max Payne]]'' players can chance upon a number of ongoing television shows when activating or happening upon various television sets within the game environs, depending on where / when they are within the unfolding game narrative will dictate which episode of what show is found. Among them are ''[[Lords &amp; Ladies]]'', ''[[Captain Baseball Bat Boy]]'', ''[[Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne|Dick Justice]]'' and the pinnacle television serial ''[[Max Payne (video game)|Address Unknown]]'' -heavily inspired by David Lynch style film narrative, particularly ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', Address Unknown sometimes prophesies events or character motives yet to occur in the Max Payne narrative.

In ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'', the player can watch several TV channels which include many programs: reality shows, cartoons, and even game shows.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2008/04/watching-tv-and/ Grand Theft Auto IV Shifts Into Media Overdrive].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nested TV shows===
''[[Terrance &amp; Phillip]]'' from ''[[South Park]]'' comments on the levels of violence and acceptable behaviour in the media and allow criticism of the outer cartoon to be addressed in the cartoon itself. Similarly, on the long running animated sitcom, ''[[The Simpsons]]'', Bart's favorite cartoon, ''[[Itchy and Scratchy]]'' (a parody of ''[[Tom &amp; Jerry]]''), often echoes the plotlines of the main show.  ''[[The Simpsons]]'' also parodied this structure with numerous 'layers' of sub-stories in the Season 17 episode "[[The Seemingly Never-Ending Story]]".

On the show ''[[Dear White People (TV series)|Dear White People]]'', the ''[[Scandal (TV series)|Scandal]]'' parody ''Defamation'' offers a ironic commentary on the main show's theme of interracial relationships.  Similarly, on the HBO show ''[[Insecure (TV series)|Insecure]]'' the slavery-era soap opera ''Due North'' is an obsession for the show's main characters.

The [[Ireland|Irish]] television series ''[[Father Ted]]'' features a television show, ''Father Ben'', which has characters and storylines almost identical to that of Father Ted.

The television shows ''[[30 Rock]]'', ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]]'', ''[[Sonny with a Chance]]'', and ''[[Kappa Mikey]]'' feature a sketch show within the TV show.

An extended plotline on the semi-autobiographical sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'' dealt with the main characters developing a sitcom about their lives.  The gag was reprised on ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', another semi-autobiographical show by and about ''Seinfeld'' co-creator Larry David, when the long-anticipated ''Seinfeld'' reunion was staged entirely inside the new show.

The ''[[USS Callister]]'' episode of the ''[[Black Mirror]]'' anthology television series is about a man obsessed with a Star-Trek like show, who recreates it as part of a virtual reality game.

The concept of a film within a television series is employed in the [[Macross]] universe. ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?]]'' (1984) was originally intended as an alternative theatrical re-telling of the television series ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'' (1982), but was later "[[Retroactive continuity|retconned]]" into the Macross [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] as a popular movie within the television series ''[[Macross 7]]'' (1994).

====Film within a TV show====

''Seinfeld'' had a number of reoccurring fictional films, most notably ''Rochelle, Rochelle'', a parody of artsy but exploitative foreign films, while the trippy, metaphysically loopy thriller ''Death Castle'' is a central element of the ''[[Master of None]]'' episode ''New York, I Love You.''

==Fantasy within Realism==

Stories inside stories can allow for genre changes.  [[Arthur Ransome]] uses the device to let his young characters in the ''[[Swallows and Amazons series]]'' of children's books, set in the recognisable everyday world, take part in fantastic adventures of piracy in distant lands: two of the twelve books, ''[[Peter Duck]]'' and ''[[Missee Lee]]'' (and some would include ''[[Great Northern?]]'' as a third), are adventures supposedly made up by the characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The film version of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' does the same thing by making its inner story into a dream.  Lewis Carroll's celebrated ''[[Alice_(Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland)|Alice]]'' books use the same device of a dream as an excuse for fantasy, while Carroll's less well-known ''[[Sylvie and Bruno]]'' subverts the trope by allowing the dream figures to enter and interact with the "real" world.
==Fractal Fiction==
Some stories feature what might be called a literary version of the [[Droste effect]], where an image contains a smaller version of itself (also a common feature in many [[fractals]]).  Among the stories that include versions of themselves are [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Sandman: Worlds' End]]'' which contains several instances of multiple storytelling levels, including ''Cerements'' (issue #55) where one of the inmost levels corresponds to one of the outer levels, turning the story-within-a-story structure into an infinite regression. Similarly, in [[Charlie Kaufman]]'s 2008 film ''[[Synecdoche, New York]]'', the main character Caden Cotard is a skilled director of plays who receives a grant, and ends up creating a remarkable theater piece intended as a carbon copy of the outside world.  The layers of copies of the world ends up several layers deep.

The long-running musical [[A Chorus Line]] dramatizes its own creation, and the life stories of its own original cast members.  The famous final number does double duty as the showstopper for both the musical the audience is watching and the one the characters are appearing in.

Michael Ende's classic children's novel [[The Neverending Story]] prominently features a book of the same title.  This is later revealed to be the same book the audience is reading, when it begins to be retold again from the beginning, thus creating an infinite regression that features as a plot element.  Similarly, in the Will Ferrell comedy [[Stranger_than_Fiction_(2006_film)|Stranger than Fiction]] the main character discovers he is a character in a book that (along with its author) also exists in the same universe.

In [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', there is a narrative between [[Achilles and the Tortoise]] (characters borrowed from [[Lewis Carroll]], who in turn borrowed them from [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]]), and within this story they find a book entitled "Provocative Adventures of Achilles and the Tortoise Taking Place in Sundry Spots of the Globe", which they begin to read, the Tortoise taking the part of the Tortoise, and Achilles taking the part of Achilles. Within this narrative, which itself is somewhat self-referential, the two characters find a book entitled "Provocative Adventures of Achilles and the Tortoise Taking Place in Sundry Spots of the Globe", which they begin to read, the Tortoise taking the part of Achilles, and Achilles taking the part of the Tortoise.

The music video for the [[Björk]] song "[[Bachelorette (song)|Bachelorette]]" features a musical that is about, in part, the creation of that musical. A mini-theater and small audience appear on stage to watch the musical-within-a-musical, and at some point, within that second musical a yet-smaller theater and audience appear.

Episode 14 of the [[anime]] series ''[[Martian Successor Nadesico]]'' is essentially a clip show, but has several newly animated segments based on ''[[Gekigangar III]]'', an anime that exists within its universe and that many characters are fans of, that involves the characters of that show watching Nadesico. The episode ends with the crew of the Nadesico watching the very same episode of Gekigangar, causing a [[paradox]].

''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'' begins with an action film opening, which turns out to be a sequence being filmed by [[Steven Spielberg]].  Near the ending, the events of the film itself are revealed to be a movie being enjoyed by the characters. The 1985 Tim Burton film [[Pee-Wee's Big Adventure]] ends with the main characters watching a film version of their own adventures, but as reimagined as a Hollywood blockbuster action film, with [[James Brolin]] as a more stereotypically manly version of the [[Paul Reubens]] title character.  [[Mel Brooks]]'s 1974 comedy ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' leaves its Western setting when the climactic fight scene breaks out, revealing the setting to have been a set in the [[Warner Bros.]] studio lot; the fight spills out onto an adjacent musical set, then into the studio canteen, and finally onto the streets. The two protagonists arrive at [[Grauman's Chinese Theater]], which is showing the "premiere" of ''Blazing Saddles''; they enter the cinema to watch the conclusion of their own film.  Brooks recycled the gag in his 1987 ''[[Star Wars]]'' parody, ''[[Spaceballs]]'', where the villains are able to locate the heroes by watching a copy of the movie they are in on VHS video tape (a comic exaggeration of the phenomenon of films being available on video before their theatrical release).  Brooks also made the 1976 parody ''[[Silent Movie]]'' about a buffoonish team of filmmakers trying to make the first Hollywood silent film in forty years --which is essentially that film itself (another forty years later, life imitated art imitating art, when an actual modern silent movie became a hit, the Oscar nominated ''[[The Artist (film)|The Artist]]'').

In the latter two films of the ''[[Scream (film series)|Scream]]'' horror trilogy, a film-within-a-film format is used when the events of the first film spawn their own horror trilogy within the films themselves. In ''[[Scream 2]]'', characters get killed while watching a film version of the events in the first ''Scream'' film, while in ''[[Scream 3]]'' the actors playing the trilogy's characters end up getting killed, much in the same way as the characters they are playing on screen. In the latest ''Scream'' movie, ''[[Scream 4]]'', in the opening sequence, two characters are watching Stab 7 before they get killed. Also, the characters of Stab 7 are watching Stab 6. There's also a party in which all seven Stab movies were going to be shown. References are also made to Stab 5 involving [[time travel]] as a plot device.

Director [[Spike Jonze]]'s ''[[Adaptation (film)|Adaptation]]'' is a fictionalized version of screenwriter [[Charlie Kaufman]]'s struggles to adapt the non-cinematic book ''[[The Orchid Thief]]'' into a Hollywood blockbuster.  As his onscreen self succumbs to the temptation to commercialize the narrative, Kaufman incorporates those techniques into the script, including tropes such as an invented romance, a car chase, a drug-running sequence, and an imaginary identical twin for the protagonist. (The movie also features scenes about the making of ''[[Being John Malkovich]]'', previously written by Kaufman and directed by Jonze.)  Robert Altman's satirical noir ''[[The Player (film)|The Player]]'' about Hollywood ends with the antihero being pitched a movie version of his own story, complete with an unlikely happy ending.

==From story within a story to separate story==
Occasionally a story within a story becomes such a popular element that the producer(s) decide to develop it autonomously as a separate and distinct work. This is an example of a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]].

In the fictional world of the ''[[Toy Story]]'' movies, [[Buzz Lightyear]] is an animated toy action figure, which was based on a fictitious cartoon series, ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command]]'', which did not exist in the real world except for snippets seen within ''Toy Story''. Later, ''Buzz Lightyear of Star Command'' was produced in the real world.

''[[Kujibiki Unbalance]]'', a series in the ''[[Genshiken]]'' universe, has spawned merchandise of its own, and been remade into a series on its own.

Such spin-offs may be produced as a way of providing additional information on the fictional world for fans. In the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, three such supplemental books have been produced. ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'' is a textbook used by the main character, and ''[[Quidditch Through the Ages]]'' is a book from the library at his school. ''[[The Tales of Beedle the Bard]]'' provides an additional layer of fiction, the 'tales' being instructional stories told to children in the characters' world.

In the works of [[Kurt Vonnegut]], [[Kilgore Trout]] has written a novel called ''[[Venus on the Half-Shell]]''. In 1975 real-world author [[Philip José Farmer]] wrote a science-fiction novel called ''Venus on the Half-Shell'', published under the name Kilgore Trout.

In ''[[Homestuck]]'' by [[Andrew Hussie]], there is a comic called [[Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff]], created by one of the characters, Dave Strider. It was later adapted to its own ongoing series.

''Captain Proton: Defender of the Earth'', a story by [[Dean Wesley Smith]], was adapted from the holonovel ''[[Captain Proton]]'' in the [[Star Trek]] universe.

In the animated online franchise ''[[Homestar Runner]]'' many of the best-known features were spun off from each other.  The best known was "Strong Bad Emails," which depicted the villain of the original story giving snarky answers to fan emails, but that in turn spawned several other long-running features which started out as figments of Strong Bad's imagination, including the teen-oriented cartoon parody "Teen Girl Squad" and the anime parody "20X6."

One unique example is the [[Tyler Perry]] comedy/horror hit ''[[Boo! A Madea Halloween]]'' which originated as a parody of Tyler Perry films in the [[Chris Rock]] film ''[[Top 5]]''.

In [[literary criticism]], '''stream of unconsciousness''' is a [[narrative mode]] that portrays an individual's point of view by transcribing the author's [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] dialogue or ''[[somniloquy]]'' during sleep, in connection to his or her actions within a [[dream]].&lt;ref&gt;"Episode 5: Recent Sleep Works." ''Glossolalia''. [http://glossolalia-ailalossolg.blogspot.com/2010/05/episode-5.html], Resonance 104.4 FM, London. 17 May 2010. Radio.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stream of unconsciousness is characterized by disjointed leaps in ideation and story line, bizarre new word creation, loss of self-censorship, one sided conversations and punctuation that can make the prose both disturbing and difficult to follow.  Despite the name, the stream of unconsciousness occurs more in the form of waves than an actual continuous running stream of dialogue. The stream of unconsciousness is one of several forms of [[dramatic monologue]], where the speaker is addressing an audience or a third person. Such monologues are commonly used in [[poetry]] and [[drama]], but with the stream of unconsciousness, the audience or third persons are 'unknowingly' imaginary.  It is primarily a fictional device and often takes the form of a [[tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;"Razen: The Science of Sleep". [http://www.foxydigitalis.com/foxyd/?p=15396], USA. 04 Aug. 2011 Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was introduced to the field of literary studies from that of the independent music industry, where it was redefined by author and artist [[Bryan Lewis Saunders]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;"Stream of Unconconscious on Stand-Up Tragedy" [http://antonmobin.blogspot.com/2011/06/stream-of-unconscious-on-stand-up.html], France. 13 June 2011 Web.&lt;/ref&gt; For nearly a century the term has been both a misnomer and a [[malapropism]] for the [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]].

==History==
The audio recordings of [[Dion McGregor]] (1922–1994) can be perceived as one of the precursors of the 'stream of unconsciousness' (narrative mode), although his monlogues and somniloquy were never transcribed and presented as such.  "Dreams" (1995) by contemporary American artist [[Jim Shaw (artist)|Jim Shaw]] is a collection of  illustrations and extremely detailed dream descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;"Dreams".[https://www.blumandpoe.com/content/jim-shaw-dreams], Los Angeles. 2008 Web.&lt;/ref&gt; "Experiment with Dreams" by [[Leif Elggren]] and Thomas Liljenberg (Stockholm Feb. 1996) may also be attributed to the formation of this method.&lt;ref&gt;"Experiment with Dreams". [http://web.comhem.se/elggren/experiment.html], Stockholm. Feb. 1996 Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable works==

Examples of notable works employing the stream of unconsciousness narrative mode are:
*"Le Bobcat" Bryan Lewis Saunders and Raymond Dijkstra. Short Story on Cassette ([[Fragment Factory]] 2010)
*"The Reasons Why I Dream With Knives" Bryan Lewis Saunders. Nonfiction Book (Stand-Up Tragedy 2010)
*"The Confessor" is a book on tape composed of 24 album chapters on 12 audio cassettes.  With each album serving as a chapter, over 24 musicians and experimental sound artists created music for the unconscious epic poem by Bryan Lewis Saunders. "The Confessor" was created from app. 30 nights of somniloquy and dream descriptions. Poem and Book on Tape (Stand-Up Tragedy 2011)
*"Protective Geometry" [[Ed Pinsent]] and Bryan Lewis Saunders. Comic Book. (2012)

'''Top-left lighting''' is an artistic convention in which illustrations are produced so that the light appears to come from the top left of the picture.

Most people prefer lighting from the left when resolving a convex-concave ambiguity, and this preference may be stronger for [[right-handedness|right-handed]] people.  This is reflected in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[mosaic]]s and in [[Renaissance painting|Renaissance]], [[baroque painting|baroque]] and [[Impressionism|impressionist]] art.&lt;ref&gt;J. Sun and P. Perona, "Where is the sun?", ''Nature Neuroscience'', 1(3), 183-184, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McManus|first=I Christopher|author2=Joseph Buckman |author3=Euan Woolley |title=Is light in pictures presumed to come from the left side?|journal=Perception|date=2004|volume=33|page=1422|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ian_Mcmanus/publication/8003531_Is_light_in_pictures_presumed_to_come_from_the_left_side/file/79e4151052666c381c.pdf|accessdate=4 March 2014|doi=10.1068/p5289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cartography, the predominant custom of placing the shadow on the right-hand side of [[cartographic relief depiction#Hill profiles|hill profiles]] was established during the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;E. Imhof, ''Cartographic Relief Presentation'', Walter de Gruyter, 1982, reissued by ESRI Press, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-58948-026-1}}, pp. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Computer interfaces tend to use top left lighting as well, although this trend has gradually shifted more towards light coming straight from the top.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

There are notable exceptions to this convention, such as Sandro Botticelli's [[The_Birth_of_Venus_(Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]] due to the point of view which may represent geographical perspective and location.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4424">'''Wycinanki''' ({{IPAc-pl|v|y|ć|i|'|n|a|N|k|J|i}}) in [[Poland]] or  '''Vytynanky''' (Витина́нки) in [[Ukraine]] or  '''Vycinanki''' (Выцінанкі) in [[Belarus]], are a [[Slavic culture|Slavic]] version of the art form of [[papercutting]], popular in Belarus, Poland, and Ukraine.

== Belarus ==
[[File:2009. Stamp of Belarus 34-2009-11-02-bl.jpg|thumb|[[Postage stamp]] from [[Belarus]] inspired by Vytynanky.]] 
Vycinanka is also known as vyrazanka or vystryhanka, Viačaslaŭ Dubinka was key in reviving in Belarus the folk art of paper cutting images with scissors.&lt;ref name="kurjer.info"&gt;http://kurjer.info/2010/05/12/vyachasla%D1%9E-dubinka-%E2%80%9Cvycinanka-lichylasya-durykami-a-ne-mastactvam%E2%80%9D&lt;/ref&gt; Repeatedly the winner of international competitions, he left behind thousands of images with this technique. His works have adorned calendars, business cards, notepads, postcards and other items.&lt;ref name="kurjer.info"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.svaboda.org/content/article/2124897.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Poland ==
[[Image:Wystroj-chaty-kurpie.JPG|thumb|Wycinanki from [[Kurpie]]]]

Polish wycinanki became a popular folk craft in the mid-1800s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polskiinternet.com/english/info/artpaper.html "Polish folk art -  Paper Cutout / Wycinanki," PolskiInternet, retrieved 2010-09-14]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wycinanki originated with [[shepherd]]s cutting designs out of [[tree bark]] and leather.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sheldonbrown.org/joyce/wycinanki.html Wycinanky, Madelyn Joyce]&lt;/ref&gt; Colorful wycinanki were pasted on furniture or roof beams as decoration, hung in windows, and given as gifts.

Wycinanki vary by region. For example, wycinanki created in the [[Kurpie]] region are typically all one color, while wycinanki from the [[Łowicz]] region are multicolored.  Techniques include cutting, clipping, punching, tearing, and carving of paper, as well as ''nalepianki'' in which multiple layers are glued together.

Subject matter includes [[peacock]]s, [[rooster]]s, and other birds; circular or star-shaped [[medallion]]s (''gwiazdy''); flowers; and annual holidays such as Easter and Christmas. In some towns and villages competitions evolved to create the most beautiful wycinanki.  Traditionally done for relaxation in rural Poland, the techniques were passed down through generations, with new themes and ideas developing as the papercuttings became more detailed and intricate.

The [[Expo 2010 pavilions#Poland|Polish Pavilion]] at the [[2010 World Expo]] in [[Shanghai]] is based on a wycinanki design.

== Ukraine ==
Historical evidence suggests that vytynanky began to be made in Ukraine at the end of the fifteenth to early sixteenth [[century]], but it took quite some time before they became an integral part of the decorative arts practiced at the grass roots level. During the nineteenth century decorative paper cutouts spread all across the Ukrainian [[countryside]].&lt;ref name=index2.php/&gt;

The word itself, vytynanky, gained currency in the early twentieth century, but there were many other, regional words that were used too — stryhuntsi, khrestyky or kvity to mention but a few. The vytynanky shapes were of many kinds and represented stylized figures of [[people]], [[animals]] and [[plants]]. [[Ethnographer]]s and art historians began to study the art of vytynanky, and artists began to seek inspiration for their art in vytynanky. Articles and essays were published, vytynanky began to be collected. Vytynanky were displayed at exhibitions of the Ukrainian decorative and applied arts alongside traditional [[pottery]], [[embroidery]], [[carpet|rugs]] and other items.&lt;ref name=index2.php/&gt;

Vytynanky that were made for the occasions of religious feasts and holidays were more decorative than the ones used for everyday decoration. [[Christmas]] and [[Easter]] called for vytynanky in the shapes of angels, churches or even whole evangelical scenes to be pasted prominently on the walls. Marriages saw vytynanky in the shapes of doves, flowers, or the ones that formed “[[tree of life|trees of life]].”&lt;ref name=index2.php&gt;[http://www.wumag.kiev.ua/index2.php?param=pgs20084/62 Vytynanka — an art of decorative paper cutting]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6130">In [[Carl Jung]]'s theory of [[analytical psychology]], the '''Wise Old Woman and the [[Wise Old Man]]''' are [[archetypes]] of the [[Collective Unconscious]]. 'The "wise old woman"...[or] helpful "old woman" is a well-known symbol in myths and fairy tales for the wisdom of the eternal female nature'.&lt;ref&gt;Jolande Jacobi, "Symbols in an Individual Analysis" in C. G . Jung ed., ''Man and his Symbols'' (London 1978) p. 331 and p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; The 'Wise Old Man, or some other very powerful aspect of eternal masculinity'&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Hannah, ''Striving towards Wholeness'' (Boston 1988) p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; is her male counterpart.

==Individuation==

In Jung's thought, the [[individuation]] process was marked by a sequence of archetypes, each acquiring predominance at successive stages, and so reflecting what he termed an ascending psychic scale or 'hierarchy of the unconscious'.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Two Essays on Analytical Psychology'' (London 1953) p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, starting with the intermediate position of '[[Anima and animus|anima or animus]]...just as the latter have a higher position in the hierarchy than the [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]], so wholeness lays claim to a position and a value superior'&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Aion'' (London 1959) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; still. The Wise Old Woman and Man, as what he termed "[[Mana]]" personalities or "supraordinate" personalities, stood for that wholeness of the self: 'the ''mother'' ("Primordial Mother" and "[[Earth Mother]]") as a supraordinary personality...as the "self"'.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious'' (London 1996) p. 183 and p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Marie-Louise von Franz|von Franz]] put it, 'If an individual has wrestled seriously and long enough with the anima (or animus) problem, so that he, or she, is no longer partially identified with it, the unconscious again changes its dominant character and appears in a new symbolic form representing the Self, the innermost nucleus of the personality. In the dreams of a woman this centre is usually personified as a superior female figure – a priestess, sorceress, earth mother, or goddess of nature or love. In the case of a man, it manifests itself as a masculine initiator and guardian (an Indian ''[[guru]]''), a wise old man, a spirit of nature and so forth'.&lt;ref&gt;M.-L. von Franz, "The Process of Individuation", in C. G. Jung ed., ''Symbols'' p. 207–8&lt;/ref&gt;

The masculine initiator was described by Jung as 'a figure of the same sex corresponding to the father-imago...the mana-personality [a]s a dominant of the collective unconscious, the recognized archetype of the mighty man in the form of hero, chief, magician, medicine-man, saint, the ruler of men and spirits'.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Two Essays'' p. 226-7&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, 'the wise Old Woman figure represented by [[Hecate]] or the [[Crone]] ...the Great Mother'&lt;ref&gt;Claire Douglas, ''The Old Woman's Daughter'' (Texas 2006) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; stood for an aspect of the mother-imago. The archetypes of the collective unconscious can thus be seen as inner representations of the same-sex parent – as an 'imago built up from parental influences plus the specific reactions of the child'.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Two Essays'' p. 184-5&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, for the Jungian, 'the making conscious of those contents which constitute the archetype of the mana personality signifies therefore "for the man the second and true liberation from the father, for the woman that from the mother, and therewith the first perception of their own unique individuality"'.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, quoted in Jolande Jacobi, ''The Psychology of C. G. Jung: An Introduction'' (London 1946) p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mana attributes: positive and negative==

In Jung's view, 'all archetypes spontaneously develop favourable and unfavourable, light and dark, good and bad effects'.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Aion'' p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; Thus 'the "good Wise Man" must here be contrasted with a correspondingly dark, chthonic figure',&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Aion'' p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; and in the same way, the priestess or sibyl has her counterpart in the figure of 'the witch...called by Jung the "terrible mother"'.&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye, ''Anatomy of Criticism'' (Princeton 1971) p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; Taken together, male and female, 'The hunter or old magician and the witch correspond to the negative parental images in the magic world of the unconscious'.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Archetypes'' p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; 

But judgement of such collective archetypes must not be hasty. 'Just as all archetypes have a positive, favourable, bright side that points upwards, so also they have one that points downwards, partly negative and unfavourable, partly chthonic' – so that (for example) 'the sky-woman is the positive, the bear the negative aspect of the "supraordinate personality", which extends the conscious human being upwards into the celestial and downwards into the animal regions'.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Archetypes'' p. 226 and p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; Yet both aspects, celestial and chthonic, were (at least potentially) of equal value for Jung, as he sought for what he termed a "coniunctio oppositorum", a union of opposites.  'One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light', he argued, 'but by making the darkness conscious'.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''[[Alchemical Studies]]'' (London 1978) p. 265-6&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly with respect to the goal of the individuation process itself, 'as a totality, the self is a coincidentia oppositorum; it is therefore bright and dark and yet neither'.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Mysterium Coniunctionis'' (London 1963) p. 108n&lt;/ref&gt;

Coming to terms with the Mana figures of the collective unconscious – with the parental imagos – thus meant overcoming a psychic [[splitting (psychology)|splitting]], so as to make possible an acceptance of 'the Twisted side of the Great Mother'; an acceptance of the way 'the father contains both Kings at once...the Twisted King and the Whole King'.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bly, ''Iron John'' (Dorset 1991) p. 115 and p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;
