      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1622">A '''Basic Limiting Principle''' ('''B.L.P.''') is a general principle that limits our explanations [[Metaphysics|metaphysically]] or [[Epistemology|epistemologically]], and which normally goes unquestioned or even unnoticed in our everyday or scientific thinking. The term was introduced by the [[philosopher]] [[C. D. Broad]] in his 1949 paper "The Relevance of Psychical research to Philosophy":

&lt;blockquote&gt;"There are certain limiting principles which we unhesitatingly take for granted as the framework within which all our practical activities and our scientific theories are confined.  Some of these seem to be self-evident. Others are so overwhelmingly supported by all the empirical facts which fall within the range of ordinary experience and the scientific elaborations of it (including under this heading orthodox psychology) that it hardly enters our heads to question them. Let us call these Basic Limiting Principles."&lt;ref&gt;Broad (1949)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Broad offers nine examples of B.L.P.s, including the principle that there can be no backward causation, that there can be no action at a distance, and that one cannot perceive physical events or material things directly, unmediated by sensations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41980">A '''causal model''' is a [[conceptual model]] that describes the [[causality|causal]] mechanisms of a [[system]]. Causal models can improve study designs by providing clear rules for deciding which independent variables need to be included/controlled for. 

They can allow some questions to be answered from existing observational data without the need for an interventional study such as a [[randomized controlled trial]]. Some interventional studies are inappropriate for ethical or practical reasons, meaning that without a causal model, some questions cannot be answered. 

Casual models can help with the question of external validity(whether results from one study apply to unstudied populations). Causal models can allow data from multiple studies to be merged (in certain circumstances) to answer questions that cannot be answered by any individual data set.

Causal models are falsifiable, in that if they do not match data, they must be rejected as invalid.

Causal models have found applications in [[signal processing]], [[epidemiology]] and [[machine learning]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=LLkhAwAAQBAJ}} |title=Causality|last=Pearl|first=Judea|date=2009-09-14|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139643986|location=|pages=|language=en}} &lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

{{Quote|text=Causal models are mathematical models representing causal relationships within an individual system or population. They facilitate inferences about causal relationships from statistical data. They can teach us a good deal about the epistemology of causation, and about the relationship between causation and probability. They have also been applied to topics of interest to philosophers, such as the logic of counterfactuals, decision theory, and the analysis of actual causation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hitchcock|first=Christopher|title=Causal Models|date=2018|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2018/entries/causal-models/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-09-08}} &lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}} [[Judea Pearl|Pearl]] defines a causal model as an ordered triple &lt;math&gt;\langle U, V, E\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where U is a set of [[exogenous variable]]s whose values are determined by factors outside the model; V is a set of endogenous variables whose values are determined by factors within the model; and E is a set of [[structural equation]]s that express the value of each endogenous variable as a function of the values of the other variables in U and V.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
== History ==

[[Aristotle]] defined a taxonomy of causality, including "material", "formal", "efficient" and "final" causes. Hume rejected Aristotle's taxonomy in favor of counterfactuals. At one point, he denied that objects have "powers" that make one a cause and another an effect.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=264}} 264]}} Later he adopted "if the first object had not been, the second had never existed" ("[[Sine qua non|but-for]]" causation).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=265}} 265]}}

In the late 19th century, the discipline of statistics began to form. After a years-long effort to identify causal rules for domains such as biological inheritance, [[Francis Galton|Galton]] introduced the concept of [[Regression toward the mean|mean regression]] (epitomized by the [[sophomore slump]] in sports) which later led him to the non-causal concept of [[correlation]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ}} |title=The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect|last=Pearl|first=Judea|last2=Mackenzie|first2=Dana|date=2018-05-15|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=9780465097616|location=|pages=|language=en|author-link=Judea Pearl}} &lt;/ref&gt; 

As a [[Positivism|positivist]], [[Karl Pearson|Pearson]] expunged the notion of causality from much of science as an unprovable special case of association and introduced the [[correlation coefficient]] as the metric of association. He wrote, "Force as a cause of motion is exactly the same as a tree god as a cause of growth" and that causation was only a "fetish among the inscrutable arcana of modern science". Pearson founded ''[[Biometrika]]'' and the Biometrics Lab at [[University College London]], which became the world leader in statistics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1908 [[G. H. Hardy|Hardy]] and [[Wilhelm Weinberg|Weinberg]] solved the problem of [[Hardy–Weinberg principle|trait stability]] that had led Galton to abandon causality, by invoking [[Mendelian inheritance]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1921 [[Sewall Wright|Wright]]'s [[Path analysis (statistics)|path analysis]] became the theoretical ancestor of causal modeling and causal graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=yWWEIvNgUQ4C|page=707}} |title=The Oxford Handbook of Causation |editor-last=Beebee |editor-first=Helen|editor-last2=Hitchcock|editor-first2=Christopher|editor-last3=Menzies|editor-first3=Peter|date=2012-01-12|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780191629464|language=en|first=Samir |last=Okasha |chapter=Causation in Biology|chapter-url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199279739.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199279739-e-0036|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199279739.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199279739-e-0036 |doi-broken-date=2018-10-18 }} &lt;/ref&gt; He developed this approach while attempting to untangle the relative impacts of [[heredity]], development and environment on [[guinea pig]] coat patterns. He backed up his heretical claims by showing how such analyses could explain the relationship between guinea pig birth weight, in utero time and litter size. Opposition to these ideas by prominent statisticians led them to be ignored for the following 40 years (except among animal breeders). Instead scientists relied on correlations, partly at the behest of Wright's critic (and leading statistician), [[Ronald Fisher|Fisher]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One exception was Burks, a student who in 1926 was the first to apply path diagrams to represent a mediator and to assert that holding a mediator constant induces errors. She may have invented path diagrams independently.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=304}} 304]}} 

In 1923, [[Jerzy Neyman|Neyman]] introduced the concept of a potential outcome, but his paper was not translated from Polish to English until 1990.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=271}} 271]}} 

In 1958 [[David Cox (statistician)|Cox]] wrote warned that controlling for a variable Z is valid only if it is highly unlikely to be affected independent variables.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=154}} 154]}} 

In the 1960s, [[Otis Dudley Duncan|Duncan]], [[Hubert M. Blalock Jr.|Blalock]], [[Arthur Goldberger|Goldberger]] and others rediscovered path analysis. While reading Blalock's work on path diagrams, Duncan remembered a lecture by [[William Fielding Ogburn|Ogburn]] twenty years earlier that mentioned a paper by Wright that mentioned Burk.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=308}} 308]}} 

Sociologists called causal models [[structural equation modeling]], but once it became a rote method, it lost its utility, leading some practitioners to reject any relationship to causality. Economists adopted the algebraic part of path analysis, calling it simultaneous equation modeling. However, economists still avoided attributing causal meaning to their equations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Sixty years after his first paper, Wright published a piece that recapitulated it, following [[Samuel Karlin|Karlin]] et al.'s critique, which objected that it handled only linear relationships and that robust, model-free presentations of data are more revealing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1973 [[David Lewis (philosopher)|Lewis]] advocated replacing correlation with but-for causality (counterfactuals). He referred to humans' ability to envision alternative worlds in which a cause did or not occur and in which effect an appeared only following its cause.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=266}} 266]}} In 1974 [[Donald Rubin|Rubin]] introduced the notion of "potential outcomes" as a language for asking causal questions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=269}} 269]}}  

In 1983 [[Nancy Cartwright (philosopher)|Cartwright]] proposed that any factor that is "causally relevant" to an effect be conditioned on, moving beyond simple probability as the only guide.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=48}} 48]}} 

In 1986 Baron and Kenny introduced principles for detecting and evaluating mediation in a system of linear equations. As of 2014 their paper was the 33rd most-cited of all time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=324}} 324]}} That year [[Sander Greenland|Greenland]] and [[James Robins|Robins]] introduced the "exchangeability" approach to handling confounding by considering a counterfactual. They proposed assessing what would have happened to the treatment group if they had not received the treatment and comparing that outcome to that of the control group. If they matched, confounding was said to be absent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=154}} 154]}} 

== Ladder of causation ==

Pearl's causal [[Metamodeling|metamodel]] involves a three-level abstraction he calls the ladder of causation. The lowest level, Association (seeing/observing), entails the sensing of regularities or patterns in the input data, expressed as correlations. The middle level, Intervention (doing), predicts the effects of deliberate actions, expressed as causal relationships. The highest level, [[Counterfactual conditional|Counterfactuals]] (imagining), involves constructing a theory of (part of) the world that explains why specific actions have specific effects and what happens in he absence of such actions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Association ===

One object is associated with another if observing one changes the [[probability]] of observing the other. Example: shoppers who buy toothpaste are more likely to also buy dental floss. Mathematically: 

:&lt;math&gt;P (floss \vline toothpaste) &lt;/math&gt;

or the probability of (purchasing) floss given (the purchase of) toothpaste. Associations can also be measured via computing the [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] of the two events. Associations have no causal implications. One event could cause the other, the reverse could be true, or both events could be caused by some third event (unhappy hygenist shames shopper into treating their mouth better ).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Intervention ===

This level asserts specific causal relationships between events. Causality is assessed by experimentally performing some action that affects one of the events. Example: doubling the price of toothpaste (then what happens). Causality cannot be established by examining history (of price changes) because the price change may have been for some other reason that could itself affect the second event (a tariff that increases the price of both goods). Mathematically: 

:&lt;math&gt;P (floss \vline do(toothpaste)) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''do'' is an operator that signals the experimental intervention (doubling the price).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Counterfactuals ===

The highest, counterfactual, level involves consideration of an alternate version of a past event. Example: What is the probability that If a store had doubled the price of floss, the toothpaste-purchasing shopper would still have bought it? Answering yes asserts the existence of a causal relationship. Models that can answer counterfactuals allow precise interventions whose consequences can be predicted. At the extreme, such models are accepted as physical laws (as in the laws of physics, e.g., inertia, which says that if force is not applied to a stationary object, it will not move).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Causality==
=== Causality vs correlation ===

Statistics revolves around the analysis of relationships among multiple variables. Traditionally, these relationships are described as [[Correlation and dependence|correlations]], associations without any implied causal relationships. Causal models attempt to extend this framework by adding the notion of causal relationships, in which changes in one variable cause changes in others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Twentieth century definitions of [[causality]] relied purely on probabilities/associations. One event (X) was said to cause another if it raises the probability of the other (Y). Mathematically this is expressed as: 

:&lt;math&gt;P (Y \vline X) &gt; P(Y) &lt;/math&gt;. Such definitions are inadequate because they encompass non-causal explanations (a common cause for X and Y). Causality is relevant to the second ladder step. Associations are on the first step and provide only evidence to the latter.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A later definition attempted to address this ambiguity by conditioning on background factors. Mathematically: 

:&lt;math&gt;P (Y \vline X, K = k) &gt; P(Y|K=k) &lt;/math&gt;, where K is the set of background variables and k is the values of those variables in a specific context. However, the required set of background variables is indeterminate as long as probability is the only criterion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Other attempts to define causality include [[Granger causality]], a [[Statistical hypothesis testing|statistical hypothesis test]] that [[causality]] (in [[economics]]) can be assessed by measuring the ability to predict the future values of one time series using prior values of another time series.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Types ===

A cause can be [[Causality#Necessary and sufficient causes|necessary, sufficient, contributory]] or some combination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=skIZAQAAIAAJ|page=25}} |title=Discrete Mathematics with Applications|last=Epp|first=Susanna S.|date=2004|publisher=Thomson-Brooks/Cole|isbn=9780534359454|language=en|pp= 25–26}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==== Necessary ====

For ''x'' to be a necessary cause of ''y'', the presence of ''y'' must imply the prior occurrence of ''x''. The presence of ''x'', however, does not imply that ''y'' will occur.&lt;ref name="CR"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.istarassessment.org/srdims/causal-reasoning-2/|title=Causal Reasoning|website=www.istarassessment.org|access-date=2 March 2016}} &lt;/ref&gt; Necessary causes are also known as "but-for" causes, as in ''y'' would not have occurred but for the occurrence of ''x''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=261}} 261]}} 

==== Sufficient causes ====

For ''x'' to be a sufficient cause of ''y'', the presence of ''x'' must imply the subsequent occurrence of ''y''. However, another cause ''z'' may independently cause ''y''. Thus the presence of ''y'' does not require the prior occurrence of ''x''.&lt;ref name="CR" /&gt;

==== Contributory causes ====

For ''x'' to be a contributory cause of ''y'', the presence of ''x'' must increase the likelihood of ''y''. If the likelihood is 100%, then ''x'' is instead called sufficient. A contributory cause may also be necessary.&lt;ref name="Riegelman"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Riegelman|first1=R.|year=1979|title=Contributory cause: Unnecessary and insufficient|journal=Postgraduate Medicine|volume=66|issue=2|pages=177–179|doi=10.1080/00325481.1979.11715231|pmid=450828}} &lt;/ref&gt;

== Model ==

=== Causal diagram ===
A causal diagram is a [[directed graph]] that displays [[causality|causal]] relationships between [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] in a causal model. A causal diagram includes a set of variables (or [[node (graph theory)|nodes]]). Each node is connected by an arrow to one or more other nodes upon which it has a causal influence. An arrowhead delineates the direction of causality, e.g., an arrow connecting variables A and B with the arrowhead at B indicates that a change in A causes a change in B (with an associated probability).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Causal diagrams include [[causal loop diagram]]s, [[directed acyclic graph]]s, and [[Ishikawa diagram]]s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Casual diagrams are independent of the quantitative probabilities that inform them. Changes to those probabilities (e.g., due to technological improvements) do not require changes to the model.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Model elements ===

Causal models have formal structures with elements with specific properties.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Junction patterns ====

The three types of connections of three nodes are linear chains, branching forks and merging colliders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
===== Chain =====

Chains are straight line connections with arrows pointing from cause to effect. In this model, B is a mediator in that it mediates the change that A would otherwise have on C.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=113}} 113]}} 

:&lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C&lt;/math&gt; 

===== Fork =====

In forks, one cause has multiple effects. The two effects have a common cause. Conditioning on B (for a specific value of B) reveals a positive correlation between A and C that is not causal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=114}} 114]}} 

:&lt;math&gt;A \leftarrow B \rightarrow C&lt;/math&gt; 

An elaboration of a fork is the confounder:

:&lt;math&gt;A \leftarrow B \rightarrow C \rightarrow A &lt;/math&gt;

In such models, B is a common cause of A and C (which also causes A), making B the confounder.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=114}} 114]}} 

===== Collider =====

In colliders, multiple causes affect one outcome. Conditioning on B (for a specific value of B) often reveals a non-causal negative correlation between A and C. This negative correlation has been called collider bias and the "explain-away" effect as in, B explains away the correlation between A and C.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=115}} 115]}} The correlation can be positive in the case where contributions from both A and C are necessary to affect B.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=197}} 197]}} 

:&lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B \leftarrow C&lt;/math&gt; 

==== Node types ====

===== Mediator =====

A mediator node modifies the effect of other causes on an outcome (as opposed to simply affecting the outcome).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=113}} 113]}} 

===== Confounder =====

A confounder node affects multiple outcomes, creating a positive correlation among them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=114}} 114]}}

==== Instrumental variable ====

An [[Instrumental variables estimation|instrumental variable]] is one that:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=246}} 246]}} 

* has a causal path to the outcome
* has no other path to causal variables
* has no direct influence on the outcome

Regression coefficients can serve as estimates of the causal effect of an instrumental variable on an outcome as long as that effect is not confounded. In this way, instrumental variables allow causal factors to be quantified without data on confounders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=249}} 249]}} 

For example, given the model:

:&lt;math&gt;Z \rightarrow X \rightarrow Y \leftarrow U \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;

Z is an independent variable, because it has a path to the outcome Y and is unconfounded, e.g., by U.

Definition: In the above example, if Z and X take binary values, then the assumption that Z = 0, X = 1 does not occur is called monotonicity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=253}} 253]}} 

Refinements to the technique include creating an instrument by conditioning on other variable to block the paths between the instrument and the confounder and combining multiple variables to form a single instrument.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=257}} 257]}} 

==== Mendelian randomization ====

Definition: [[Mendelian randomization]] uses measured variation in genes of known function to examine the causal effect of a modifiable exposure on disease in [[observational studies]].&lt;ref name="Katan1986"&gt;{{cite article|author=Katan MB|date=March 1986|title=Apolipoprotein E isoforms, serum cholesterol, and cancer|journal=Lancet|volume=1|issue=8479|pages=507–8|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(86)92972-7|pmid=2869248}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK62433/|title=Mendelian Randomization: Genetic Variants as Instruments for Strengthening Causal Inference in Observational Studies|last=Smith|first=George Davey|last2=Ebrahim|first2=Shah|date=2008|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|language=en}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Because genes vary randomly across populations, presence of a gene typically qualifies as an instrumental variable, implying that in many cases, causality can be quantified using regression on an observational study.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=255}} 255]}}

== Associations ==

=== Independence conditions ===

Independence conditions are rules for deciding whether two variables are independent of each other. Variables are independent if the values of one do not directly affect the values of the other. Multiple causal models can share independence conditions. For example, the models

:&lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C&lt;/math&gt;

and 

:&lt;math&gt;A \leftarrow B \rightarrow C&lt;/math&gt;

have the same independence conditions, because conditioning on B leaves A and C independent. However, the two models do not have the same meaning and can be falsified based on data. (If observations show an association between A and C after conditioning on B, then both models are incorrect). Conversely, data cannot show which of these two models are correct, because they have the same independence conditions. Conditioning on a variable is a mechanism for conducting hypothetical experiments. Conditioning on a variable involves analyzing the values of other variables for a given value of the conditioned variable. In the first example, conditioning on B implies that observations for a given value of B should show no correlation between A and C. If such a correlation exists, then the model is incorrect. Non-causal models cannot make such distinctions, because they do not make causal assertions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=129}} 129-130]}} 

=== Confounder/deconfounder ===

An essential element of correlational study design is to identify potentially confounding influences on the variable under study, such as demographics. These variables are controlled for to eliminate those influences. However, the correct list of confounding variables cannot be determined ''a priori''. It is thus possible that a study may control for irrelevant variables or even (indirectly) the variable under study.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=139}} 139]}} 

Causal models offer a robust technique for identifying appropriate confounding variables. Formally, Z is a confounder if "Y is associated with Z via paths not going through X". These can often be determined using data collected for other studies. Mathematically, if 

:&lt;math&gt;P(Y|X) \ne P(Y|do(X))&lt;/math&gt; 

then X is a confounder for Y.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=151}} 151]}} 

Earlier, allegedly incorrect definitions include:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=152}} 152]}} 

* "Any variable that is correlated with both X and Y."
* Y is associated with Z among the unexposed.
* Noncollapsibility: A difference between the "crude relative risk and the relative risk resulting after adjustment for the potential confounder".
* Epidemiological: A variable associated with X in the population at large and associated with Y among people unexposed to X.

The latter is flawed in that given that in the model: 

:&lt;math&gt;X \rightarrow Z \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; 

Z matches the definition, but is a mediator, not a confounder, and is an example of controlling for the outcome.

In the model 

:&lt;math&gt;X \leftarrow A \rightarrow B \leftarrow C \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; 

Traditionally, B was considered to be a confounder, because it is associated with X and with Y but is not on a causal path nor is it a descendant of anything on a causal path. Controlling for B causes it to become a confounder. This is known as M-bias.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=161}} 161]}} 

==== Backdoor adjustment ====

In a causal model, the method for identifying all appropriate counfounders (deconfounding) is to block every noncausal path between X and Y without disrupting any causal paths.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=158}} 158]}} 

Definition: a backdoor path between two variables X and Y is any path from X to Y that starts with an arrow pointing to X.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=158}} 158]}} 

X and Y are deconfounded if every backdoor path is blocked and no controlled-for variable Z is descended from X. It is not necessary to control for any variables other than the deconfounders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=158}} 158]}} 

Definition: the backdoor criterion is satisfied when all backdoor paths in a model are blocked.

When the causal model is a plausible representation of reality and the backdoor criterion is satisfied, then partial regression coefficients can be used as (causal) path coefficients (for linear relationships).&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=223}} 223]}} 

:&lt;math&gt;P(Y|do(X)) = \textstyle \sum_{x} \displaystyle P(Y|X, Z=z) P(Z=z)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=227}} 227]}}

==== Frontdoor adjustment ====

Definition: a frontdoor path is a direct causal path for which data is available for all variables.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=226}} 226]}} 

The following converts a do expression into a do-free expression by conditioning on the variables along the front-door path.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=226}} 226]}} 

:&lt;math&gt;P(Y|do(X)) = \textstyle \sum_{z} \displaystyle P(Z=z,X) \textstyle \sum_{x} \displaystyle P(Y|X=x, Z=z) P(X=x)&lt;/math&gt; 

Presuming data for these observable probabilities is available, the ultimate probability can be computed without an experiment, regardless of the existence of other confounding paths and without backdoor adjustment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=226}} 226]}} 

== Interventions ==
=== Queries ===

Queries are questions asked based on a specific model. They are generally answered via performing experiments (interventions). Interventions take the form of fixing the value of one variable in a model and observing the result. Mathematically, such queries take the form (from the example):&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=8}} 8]}} 

:&lt;math&gt;P (floss \vline do(toothpaste)) &lt;/math&gt;

where the ''do'' operator indicates that the experiment explicitly modified the price of toothpaste. Graphically, this blocks any causal factors that would otherwise affect that variable. Diagramatically, this erases all causal arrows pointing at the experimental variable.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=40}} 40]}} 

More complex queries are possible, in which the do operator is applied (the value is fixed) to multiple variables.

=== Do calculus ===

The do calculus is the set of manipulations that are available to transform one expression into another, with the general goal of transforming expressions that contain the do operator into expressions that do not. Expressions that do not include the do operator can be estimated from observational data alone, without the need for an experimental intervention, which might be expensive, lengthy or even unethical (e.g., asking subjects to take up smoking).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=231}} 231]}} The set of rules is complete (it can be used to derive every true statement in this system).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=237}} 237]}} An algorithm can determine whether, for a given model, a solution is computable in [[Time complexity|polynomial time]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=238}} 238]}} 

==== Rules ====

The calculus includes three rules for the transformation of conditional probability expressions involving the do operator. 

===== Rule 1 =====
Rule 1 permits the addition or deletion of observations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=235}} 235]}}:

:&lt;math&gt;P(Y|do(X), Z, W) = P(Y|do(X),Z)&lt;/math&gt;

in the case that the variable set Z blocks all paths from W to Y and all arrows leading into X have been deleted.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=234}} 234]}}  

===== Rule 2 =====
Rule 2 permits the replacement of an intervention with an observation or vice versa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=235}} 235]}}:

:&lt;math&gt;P(Y|do(X),Z) = P(Y|X,Z)&lt;/math&gt; 

in the case that Z satisfies the [[#Deconfounding|back-door criterion]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=234}} 234]}}  

===== Rule 3 =====
Rule 3 permits the deletion or addition of interventions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;P(Y|do(X)) = P(Y)&lt;/math&gt; 

in the case where no causal paths connect X and Y.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=234}} 234]}} {{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=235}} 235]}} 

==== Extensions ====

The rules do not imply that any query can have its do operators removed. In those cases, it may be possible to substitute a variable that is subject to manipulation (e.g., diet) in place of one that is not (e.g., blood cholesterol), which can then be transformed to remove the do. Example: 

:&lt;math&gt;P(Heart disease |do(blood cholesterol)) = P(Heart disease|do(diet))&lt;/math&gt; 

== Counterfactuals ==

Counterfactuals consider possibilities that are not found in data, such as whether a nonsmoker would have developed cancer had they instead been a heavy smoker. They are the highest step on Pearl's causality ladder. 

=== Potential outcome ===
Definition: A potential outcome for a variable Y is "the value Y would have taken for individual ''u'', had X been assigned the value x". Mathematically:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=270}} 270]}} 

:&lt;math&gt;Y_X = \ _x(u)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;Y_x(u)&lt;/math&gt;.

The potential outcome is defined at the level of the individual ''u.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;''{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=270}} 270]}} 

The conventional approach to potential outcomes is data-, not model-driven, limiting its ability to untangle causal relationships. It treats causal questions as problems of missing data and gives incorrect answers to even standard scenarios.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=275}} 275]}} 

=== Causal inference ===
In the context of causal models, potential outcomes are interpreted causally, rather than statistically.

The first law of causal inference states that the potential outcome 

:&lt;math&gt;Y_X(u) &lt;/math&gt;

can be computed by modifying causal model M (by deleting arrows into X) and computing the outcome for some ''x''. Formally:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=280}} 280]}} 

:&lt;math&gt;Y_X(u) = Y_{Mx}(u)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Conducting a counterfactual ===

Examining a counterfactual using a causal model involves three steps. The approach is valid regardless of the form of the model relationships (linear or otherwise) When the model relationships are fully specified, point values can be computed. In other cases, (e.g., when only probabilities are available) a probability-interval statement (non-smoker x would have a 10-20% chance of cancer) can be computed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=279}} 279]}} 

Given the model:

:&lt;math&gt;Y \leftarrow X \rightarrow M \rightarrow Y \leftarrow U &lt;/math&gt;

the equations for calculating the values of A and C derived from regression analysis or another technique can be applied, substituting known values from an observation and fixing the value of other variables (the counterfactual).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=278}} 278]}} 

==== Abduct ====

Apply [[abductive reasoning]] ([[logical inference]] that uses observation to find the simplest/most likely explanation) to estimate ''u'', the proxy for the unobserved variables on the specific observation that supports the counterfactual.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=278}} 278]}} 

==== Act ====

For a specific observation, use the do operator to establish the counterfactual (e.g., ''m''=0), modifying the equations accordingly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=278}} 278]}} 

==== Predict ====

Calculate the values of the output (''y'') using the modified equations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=278}} 278]}} 

=== Mediation ===

Direct and indirect (mediated) causes can only be distinguished via conducting counterfactuals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=301}} 301]}} Understanding mediation requires holding the mediator constant while intervening on the direct cause. In the model

&lt;math&gt;Y \leftarrow M \leftarrow X \rightarrow Y &lt;/math&gt;

M mediates X's influence on Y, while X also has an unmediated effect on Y. Thus M is held constant, while do(X) is computed.

The Mediation Fallacy instead involves conditioning on the mediator if the mediator and the outcome are confounded, as they are in the above model.

For linear models, the indirect effect can be computed by taking the product of all the path coefficients along a mediated pathway. The total indirect effect is computed by the sum of the individual indirect effects. For linear models mediation is indicated when the coefficients of an equation fitted without including the mediator vary significantly from an equation that includes it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=324}} 324]}} 

==== Direct effect ====

In experiments on such a model, the controlled direct effect (CDE) is computed by forcing the value of the mediator M (do(M = 0)) and randomly assigning some subjects to each of the values of X (do(X=0), do(X=1), ...) and observing the resulting values of Y.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=317}} 317]}} 

:&lt;math&gt;CDE(0) = P(Y=1|do(X=1), do(M=0)) - P(Y=1|do(X=0), do(M=0)) &lt;/math&gt;

Each value of the mediator has a corresponding CDE.

However, a better experiment is to compute the natural direct effect. (NDE) This is the effect determined by leaving the relationship between X and M untouched while intervening on the relationship between X and Y.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=318}} 318]}} 

:&lt;math&gt;NDE = P(Y_{M=M0}=1|do(X=1)) - P(Y_{M=M0}=1|do(X=0)) &lt;/math&gt;

For example, consider the direct effect of increasing dental hygenist visits (X) from every other year to every year, which encourages flossing (M). Gums (Y) get healthier, either because of the hygenist (direct) or the flossing (mediator/indirect). The experiment is to continue flossing while skipping the hygenist visit.

==== Indirect effect ====

The indirect effect of X on Y is the "increase we would see in Y while holding X constant and increasing M to whatever value M would attain under a unit increase in X".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=328}} 328]}} 

Indirect effects cannot be "controlled" because the direct path cannot be disabled by holding another variable constant. The natural indirect effect (NIE) is the effect on gum health (Y) from flossing (M). The NIE is calculated as the sum of (floss and no-floss cases) of the difference between the probability of flossing given the hygenist and without the hygenist, or:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=321}} 321]}} 

:&lt;math&gt;NIE = \sum_m[P(M=m|X=1)-P(M=m|X=0)] x x P(Y=1|X=0,M=m) &lt;/math&gt;

The above NDE calculation includes counterfactual subscripts (&lt;math&gt;Y_{M=M0} &lt;/math&gt;). For nonlinear models, the seemingly obvious equivalence&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=322}} 322]}} 

:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{Total \ effect = Direct \ effect + Indirect \ effect} &lt;/math&gt;

does not apply because of anomalies such as threshold effects and binary values. However, 

:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{Total \ effect}(X=0 \rightarrow X = 1) = NDE(X=0 \rightarrow X = 1) - \ NIE(X=1 \rightarrow X=0) &lt;/math&gt;

works for all model relationships (linear and nonlinear). It allows NDE to then be calculated directly from observational data, without interventions or use of counterfactual subscripts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=326}} 326]}} 

== Transportability ==

Causal models provide a vehicle for integrating data across datasets, known as transport, even though the causal models (and the associated data) differ. E.g., survey data can be merged with randomized, controlled trial data.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=352}} 352]}} Transport offers a solution to the question of [[external validity]], whether a study can be applied in a different context.

Where two models match on all relevant variables and data from one model is known to be unbiased, data from one population can be used to draw conclusions about the other. In other cases, where data is known to be biased, reweighting can allow the dataset to be transported. In a third case, conclusions can be drawn from an incomplete dataset. In some cases, data from studies of multiple populations can be combined (via transportation) to allow conclusions about an unmeasured population. In some cases, combining estimates (e.g., P(W|X)) from multiple studies can increase the precision of a conclusion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=355}} 355]}} 

Do-calculus provides a general criterion for transport: A target variable can be transformed into another expression via a series of do-operations that does not involve any "difference-producing" variables (those that distinguish the two populations).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=355}} 355]}} An analogous rule applies to studies that have relevantly different participants.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=356}} 356]}} 

== Bayesian network ==

{{Main|Bayesian network}} 

Any causal model can be implemented as a Bayesian network. Bayesian networks can be used to provide the inverse probability of an event (given an outcome, what are the probabilities of a specific cause). This requires preparation of a conditional probability table, showing all possible inputs and outcomes with their associated probabilities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=119}} 119]}} 

For example, given a two variable model of Disease and Test (for the disease) the conditional probability table takes the form:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=117}} 117]}} 
{| class="wikitable"

|+Probability of a positive test for a given disease

!

!colspan="2"|Test

|-

!Disease 

!Positive

!Negative

|-

|Negative

|12

|88

|-

|Positive

|73

|27

|}

According to this table, when a patient does not have the disease, the probability of a positive test is 12%.

While this is tractable for small problems, as the number of variables and their associated states increase, the probability table (and associated computation time) increases exponentially.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=121}} 121]}} 

Bayesian networks are used commercially in applications such as wireless data error correction and DNA analysis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=122}} 122]}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2361">'''Conceptual architecture''' is a form of architecture that utilizes [[conceptualism]], characterized by an introduction of ideas or concepts from outside of architecture often as a means of expanding the discipline of architecture. This produces an essentially different kind of building than one produced by the widely held 'architect as a master-builder' model, in which craft and construction are the guiding principles. The finished building as product is less important in conceptual architecture, than the ideas guiding them, ideas represented primarily by texts, diagrams, or art installations. Architects that work in this vein are [[Diller and Scofidio|Diller + Scofidio]], [[Bernard Tschumi]], [[Peter Eisenman]] and [[Rem Koolhaas]].

Conceptual architecture was studied in the essay, ''Notes on Conceptual Architecture: Towards a Definition'' by [[Peter Eisenman]] in 1970, and again by the Harvard Design Magazine in Fall of 2003 and Winter 2004, by a series of articles under the heading ''Architecture as Conceptual Art''. But the understanding of design as a construction of a concept was understood by many [[modern architecture|modernist architects]] as well. To quote [[Louis Kahn]] on [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]:

:''It doesn't work, it doesn't have to work. Wright had the shape conceived long before he knew what was going into it. I claim that is where architecture starts, with the concept.''&lt;ref&gt;
Louis Kahn quote from Frampton, Kenneth. ''Modern Architecture, a critical history.'' page 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1094">'''Conceptual necessity''' is a property of the certainty with which a state of affairs, as presented by a certain description, occurs: it occurs by conceptual necessity if and only if it occurs just by virtue of the meaning of the description. If someone is a [[bachelor]], for instance, then he is bound to be unmarried by conceptual necessity, because the meaning of the word "bachelor" determines that he is.

Alternatively, there is [[metaphysical necessity]], which is a certainty determined, not by the meaning of a description, but instead by facts in the world described.

Historically, [[Baruch Spinoza]] was a subscriber to this belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza-modal/notes.html |title=Notes to Spinoza's Modal Metaphysics |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=2013 |accessdate=May 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kepler-Bruno.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Figure 'M' (for Latin ''Mundus'') from [[Johannes Kepler]]'s 1617–1621 ''[[Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae]]'', showing the [[Earth]] as belonging to just one of any number of similar stars.]]
In [[physical cosmology]], the '''Copernican principle''' is an alternative name for the  [[principle of relativity]], stating that humans, on the [[Earth]] or in the [[Solar system]], are not privileged observers of the [[universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Peacock |first=John A. | title =  Cosmological Physics | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | page = 66 | year = 1998 |isbn= 0-521-42270-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Named for [[Copernican heliocentrism]], it is a working assumption that arises from a modified cosmological extension of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus's]] argument of a moving Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bondi |first=Hermann| authorlink = Hermann Bondi | title = Cosmology | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1952 | pages = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some sense, it is equivalent to the [[mediocrity principle]].

== Origin and implications ==

[[Hermann Bondi]] named the principle after Copernicus in the mid-20th century, although the principle itself dates back to the 16th-17th century [[paradigm shift]] away from the [[Ptolemaic system]], which placed [[Earth]] at the center of the [[universe]]. Copernicus proposed that the motion of the planets can be explained by reference to an assumption that the Sun and not Earth is centrally located and stationary. He argued that the [[apparent retrograde motion]] of the planets is an illusion caused by Earth's movement around the [[Sun]], which the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican model]] placed at the centre of the universe. Copernicus himself was mainly motivated by technical dissatisfaction with the earlier system and not by support for any mediocrity principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuhn |first= Thomas S. | authorlink = Thomas Kuhn | title = The Copernican Revolution: Planetary Astronomy in the Development of Western Thought | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] |year=1957 | isbn=978-0-674-17103-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, although the Copernican heliocentric model is often described as "demoting" Earth from its central role it had in the Ptolemaic geocentric model, it was successors to Copernicus, notably the 16th century [[Giordano Bruno]] who adopted this new perspective. The earth's central position had been interpreted as being in the "lowest and filthiest parts". Instead, as Galileo said, the earth is part of the "dance of the stars" rather than the "sump where the universe's filth and ephemera collect".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1038/scientificamerican0301-24a |journal= Scientific American |year=2001 |volume=284 |issue=3 |pages=24 |title= Copernican Counterrevolution |authorlink= George Musser |last=Musser |first=George  |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=in-brief-2001-03|bibcode = 2001SciAm.284c..24M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1511/2009.76.50 |journal= American Scientist |year=2009 |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=50–57 |title= The Bones of Copernicus |first= Dennis |last=Danielson }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 20th Century, Carl Sagan asked, "Who are we? We find that we live on an insignificant planet of a humdrum star lost in a galaxy tucked away in some forgotten corner of a universe in which there are far more galaxies than people."&lt;ref&gt;Sagan C, Cosmos (1980) p.193&lt;/ref&gt;

In cosmology, if one assumes the Copernican principle and observes that the universe appears [[Isotropy|isotropic]] or the same in all directions from our vantage point on Earth, then one can infer that the universe is generally [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] or the same everywhere (at any given time) and is also isotropic about any given point. These two conditions make up the [[cosmological principle]].&lt;ref name="RowanRobinson1996" /&gt; In practice, astronomers observe that the universe has [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] or non-uniform structures up to the scale of [[galactic supercluster]]s, [[Galaxy filament|filaments]] and [[Void (astronomy)|great void]]s. It becomes more and more homogeneous and isotropic when observed on larger and larger scales, with little detectable structure on scales of more than about 200 million [[parsec]]s. However, on scales comparable to the radius of the observable universe, we see systematic changes with distance from Earth. For instance, galaxies contain more young stars and are less clustered, and [[quasars]] appear more numerous. While this might suggest that Earth is at the center of the universe, the Copernican principle requires us to interpret it as evidence for the evolution of the universe with time: this distant light has taken most of the age of the universe to reach us and show us the universe when it was young. The most distant light of all, [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], is isotropic to at least one part in a thousand.

Modern mathematical cosmology is based on the assumption that the Cosmological principle is almost, but not exactly, true on the largest scales. The Copernican principle represents the irreducible philosophical assumption needed to justify this, when combined with the observations.

[[Michael Rowan-Robinson]] emphasizes the Copernican principle as the threshold test for modern thought, asserting that: "It is evident that in the post-Copernican era of human history, no well-informed and rational person can imagine that the Earth occupies a unique position in the universe."&lt;ref name="RowanRobinson1996"&gt;{{cite book | last=Rowan-Robinson |first=Michael  |authorlink=Michael Rowan-Robinson | title = Cosmology| edition = 3rd | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | pages = 62–63  |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-19-851884-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bondi and [[Thomas Gold]] used the Copernican principle to argue for the [[perfect cosmological principle]] which maintains that the universe is also homogeneous in time, and is the basis for the [[steady-state cosmology]].&lt;ref name="BondiGold1948"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bondi|first=H.|author2=Gold, T.|title=The Steady-State Theory of the Expanding Universe|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|year=1948|volume=108|issue=3|pages=252–270|bibcode=1948MNRAS.108..252B|doi=10.1093/mnras/108.3.252}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this strongly conflicts with the evidence for cosmological evolution mentioned earlier:  the universe has progressed from extremely different conditions at the [[Big Bang]], and will continue to progress toward extremely different conditions, particularly under the rising influence of [[dark energy]], apparently toward the [[Big Freeze]] or [[Big Rip]].

Since the 1990s the term has been used (interchangeably with "the Copernicus method") for [[J. Richard Gott]]'s [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian-inference]]-based prediction of duration of ongoing events, a generalized version of the [[Doomsday argument]].{{clarify|date=April 2017}}

==Tests of the principle==
The Copernican principle has never been proven, and in the most general sense cannot be proven, but it is implicit in many modern theories of physics.  Cosmological models are often derived with reference to the [[Cosmological principle]], slightly more general than the Copernican principle, and many tests of these models can be considered tests of the Copernican principle.&lt;ref name=clarkson&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Clarkson | first1 = C. | last2 = Bassett | first2 = B. | last3 = Lu | first3 = T. | title = A General Test of the Copernican Principle | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.011301 | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 101 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = 0712.3457 |bibcode = 2008PhRvL.101a1301C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical===
Before the term Copernican principle was even coined, Earth was repeatedly shown not to have any special location in the universe. The [[Copernican Revolution]] dethroned Earth to just one of many planets orbiting the Sun. [[Proper motion]] was mentioned by Halley. [[William Herschel]] found that the Solar System is moving through space within our disk-shaped [[Milky Way]] galaxy. [[Edwin Hubble]] showed that our galaxy is just one of many galaxies in the universe. Examination of our galaxy's position and motion in the universe led to the [[Big Bang|Big Bang theory]] and the whole of modern [[cosmology]].

==Physics without the principle==
The standard model of cosmology, the [[Lambda-CDM model]], assumes the Copernican principle and the more general [[Cosmological principle]] and observations are largely consistent but there are always [[Unsolved problems in physics#Astronomy and astrophysics|unsolved problems]].  Some cosmologists and theoretical physicists design models lacking the Cosmological or Copernican principles, to constrain the valid values of observational results, to address specific known issues, and to propose tests to distinguish between current models and other possible models.

A prominent example in this context is the observed [[accelerating universe]] and the [[cosmological constant]] issue.  An alternative proposal to [[dark energy]] is that the universe is much more inhomogeneous than currently assumed, and specifically that we are in an extremely large low-density void.&lt;ref name=void&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = February | first1 = S. | last2 = Larena | first2 = J. | last3 = Smith | first3 = M. | last4 = Clarkson | first4 = C. | title = Rendering dark energy void | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.16627.x | journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | pages = no | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = 0909.1479 |bibcode = 2010MNRAS.405.2231F }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To match observations we would have to be very close to the centre of this void, immediately contradicting the Copernican principle.

In [[physics]], the '''correspondence principle''' states that the behavior of systems described by the theory of [[quantum mechanics]] (or by the [[old quantum theory]]) reproduces [[classical mechanics|classical physics]] in the limit of large [[quantum numbers]]. In other words, it says that for large [[orbit]]s and for large [[energy|energies]], quantum calculations must agree with classical calculations.&lt;ref name="Tipler"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tipler|first1=Paul|last2=Llewellyn|first2=Ralph|title=Modern Physics|edition=5|year=2008|publisher=[[W. H. Freeman and Company]]|isbn=978-0-7167-7550-8|pages=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle was formulated by [[Niels Bohr]] in 1920,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
      | last=Bohr | first=N. | authorlink = Niels Bohr
      | title = Über die Serienspektra der Element

   |bibcode = 1920ZPhy....2..423B }} (English translation in {{harv |Bohr|1976|pp=241–282}})&lt;/ref&gt; though he had previously made use of it as early as 1913 in developing his [[Bohr model|model of the atom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The term codifies the idea that a new theory should reproduce under some conditions the results of older well-established theories in those domains where the old theories work. This concept is somewhat different from the requirement of a formal [[Limiting case (philosophy of science)|limit]] under which the new theory reduces to the older, thanks to the existence of a deformation parameter.  {{What?|date=October 2017}}

Classical quantities appear in quantum mechanics in the form of [[Expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expected values]] of observables, and as such the [[Ehrenfest theorem]] (which predicts the time evolution of the expected values) lends support to the correspondence principle.

==Quantum mechanics==

The rules of quantum mechanics are highly successful in describing microscopic objects, [[atom]]s and [[particle physics|elementary particles]]. But ''macroscopic systems,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaeger|first1=Gregg|title=What in the (quantum) world is macroscopic?|journal=American Journal of Physics|date=September 2014|volume=82|issue=9|pages=896–905|doi=10.1119/1.4878358|bibcode = 2014AmJPh..82..896J }}&lt;/ref&gt; like [[spring (device)|springs]] and [[capacitor]]s, are accurately described by classical theories like [[classical mechanics]] and [[electromagnetism|classical electrodynamics]]. If quantum mechanics were to be applicable to macroscopic objects, there must be some limit in which quantum mechanics reduces to classical mechanics.  ''Bohr's correspondence principle demands that classical physics and quantum physics give the same answer when the systems become large''.&lt;ref&gt; {{Citation

      | volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A. Sommerfeld (1924) referred to the principle as "Bohrs Zauberstab" (Bohr's magic wand).

The conditions under which quantum and classical physics agree are referred to as the '''correspondence limit''', or the '''[[classical limit]]'''. Bohr provided a rough prescription for the correspondence limit: it occurs ''when the quantum numbers describing the system are large''. A more elaborated analysis of quantum-classical correspondence (QCC) in wavepacket spreading leads to the distinction between robust "restricted QCC" and fragile "detailed QCC".&lt;ref&gt;

The post-1925 new quantum theory came in two different formulations. In [[matrix mechanics]], the correspondence principle was built in and was used to construct the theory. In the [[Schrödinger equation|Schrödinger approach]] classical behavior is not clear because the waves spread out as they move. Once the Schrödinger equation was given a probabilistic interpretation, [[Ehrenfest theorem|Ehrenfest showed]] that Newton's laws hold on average: the quantum statistical expectation value of the position and momentum obey Newton's laws.

The correspondence principle is one of the tools available to physicists for selecting quantum theories corresponding to [[reality]]. The [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|principles of quantum mechanics]] are broad: states of a physical system form a [[Hilbert space|complex vector space]] and [[physical observables]] are identified with [[Hermitian operators]] that act on this [[Hilbert space]]. The correspondence principle limits the choices to those that reproduce classical mechanics in the correspondence limit.

Because quantum mechanics only reproduces classical mechanics in a statistical interpretation, and because the statistical interpretation only gives the probabilities of different classical outcomes, [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]] has argued that quantum physics does not reduce to classical mechanics similarly as classical mechanics emerges as an approximation of [[special relativity]] at small [[velocity|velocities]]. He argued that classical physics exists independently of quantum theory and cannot be derived from it. His position is that it is inappropriate to understand the experiences of observers using purely quantum mechanical notions such as wavefunctions because the different states of experience of an observer are defined classically, and do not have a quantum mechanical analog. The [[many worlds interpretation|relative state interpretation]] of quantum mechanics is an attempt to understand the experience of observers using only quantum mechanical notions. Niels Bohr was an early opponent of such interpretations.

Many of these conceptual problems, however, resolve in the [[Weyl quantization|phase-space formulation of quantum mechanics]], where the ''same variables with the same interpretation'' are utilized to describe both quantum and classical mechanics.

==Other scientific theories==

The term "correspondence principle" is used in a more general sense to mean the reduction of a new [[scientific theory#science|scientific theory]] to an earlier scientific theory in appropriate circumstances. This requires that the new theory explain all the phenomena under circumstances for which the preceding theory was known to be valid, the "correspondence limit".

For example, 
*Einstein's [[special relativity]] satisfies the correspondence principle, because it reduces to classical mechanics in the limit of velocities small compared to the [[speed of light]] (example below);
* [[General relativity]] reduces to [[gravity|Newtonian gravity]] in the limit of weak gravitational fields;
* Laplace's theory of [[celestial mechanics]] reduces to Kepler's when interplanetary interactions are ignored, and Kepler's reproduces Ptolemy's [[equant]] in a coordinate system where the Earth is stationary;

In order for there to be a correspondence, the earlier theory has to have a domain of validity—it must work under ''some'' conditions. Not all theories have a domain of validity. For example, there is no limit where Newton's mechanics reduces to [[Aristotelian physics|Aristotle's mechanics]] because Aristotle's mechanics, although academically dominant for 18 centuries, does not have any domain of validity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}{{Dubious|date=April 2018}}

==Examples==
===Bohr model===
{{Main|Bohr model}}
If an electron in an atom is moving on an orbit with period {{math|''T''}},  classically the electromagnetic radiation will repeat itself every orbital period. If the coupling to the electromagnetic field is weak, so that the orbit doesn't decay very much in one cycle, the radiation will be emitted in a pattern which repeats every period, so that the Fourier transform will have frequencies which are only multiples of   {{math|1/''T''}}. This is the classical radiation law: the frequencies emitted are integer multiples of  {{math|1/''T''}}.

In quantum mechanics, this emission must be in quanta of light, of frequencies consisting of integer multiples of  {{math|1/''T''}}, so that classical mechanics is an approximate description at large quantum numbers. This means that the energy level corresponding to a classical orbit of period  {{math|1/''T''}} must have nearby energy levels which differ in energy by  {{math|''h/T''}}, and they should be equally spaced near that level,
:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta E_n= { h\over T(E_n) }    ~.
&lt;/math&gt;

Bohr worried whether the energy spacing 1/{{math|''T''}} should be best calculated with the period of the energy state &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;E_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;, or some average—in hindsight,  this model is only the leading semiclassical approximation.

Bohr considered circular orbits.  Classically, these orbits must decay to smaller circles when  photons are emitted. The level spacing between circular orbits can be calculated with the correspondence formula. For a Hydrogen atom, the classical orbits have a period  {{math|''T''}}  determined by [[Keplers laws|Kepler's third law]] to scale as  {{math|''r''&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The energy scales as  {{math|1/''r''}}, so the level spacing formula  amounts to
:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta E \propto { 1 \over r^{3\over 2} } \propto E^{3 \over 2}.
&lt;/math&gt;
It is possible to determine the energy levels by recursively stepping down orbit by orbit, but there is a shortcut.

The angular momentum  {{math|''L''}} of the circular orbit scales as {{math|{{radic|''r''}}}}. The energy in terms of the angular momentum is then
:&lt;math&gt;E \propto {1\over r} \propto {1 \over L^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming, with Bohr, that quantized values of  {{math|''L''}} are equally spaced, the spacing between neighboring energies is
:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta E \propto {1 \over (L+\hbar)^2 } - {1 \over L^2} \approx  - {2\hbar  \over L^3} \propto  - E^{3 \over 2}.
&lt;/math&gt;
This is as desired for equally spaced angular momenta. If one kept track of the constants, the spacing would be   {{math|''ħ''}}, so the angular momentum should be an integer multiple of  {{math|''ħ''}},
:&lt;math&gt;
L = {nh \over 2\pi} = n \hbar  ~ .
&lt;/math&gt;

This is how Bohr arrived at his [[Bohr Model|model]]. Since only the level ''spacing'' is determined heuristically by the correspondence principle, one could always add a small fixed offset to the quantum number— {{math|''L''}} could just as well have been  {{math|(''n''+.338) ''ħ''}}. 

Bohr used his physical intuition to decide which quantities were best to quantize. It is a testimony to his skill that he was able to get so much from what is only the [[leading-order|leading order]] approximation. A less heuristic treatment accounts for needed offsets in the ground state '''L'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, cf. [[Wigner–Weyl transform]].

=== One-dimensional potential ===

Bohr's correspondence condition can be solved for the level energies in a general one-dimensional potential. Define a quantity    {{math|''J''(''E'')}} which is a function only of the energy, and has the property that
:&lt;math&gt;
{dJ \over dE} = T
&lt;/math&gt;

This is the analog of the angular momentum in the case of the circular orbits. The orbits selected by the correspondence principle are the ones that obey  {{math|''J'' {{=}} ''nh''}}  for {{mvar|n}} integer, since
:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta E = E_{n+1} - E_n = {dE \over dJ}(J_{n+1} - J_n) = {1 \over T} \,\Delta J
&lt;/math&gt;

This quantity  {{math|''J''}} is canonically conjugate to a variable  {{math|''θ''}} which, by the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamilton equations of motion]] changes with time as the gradient of energy with  {{math|''J''}}. Since this is equal to the inverse period at all times, the variable  {{math|''θ''}} increases steadily from 0 to 1 over one period.

The angle variable comes back to itself after 1 unit of increase, so the geometry of phase space in  {{math|''J'',''θ''}} coordinates is that of a half-cylinder, capped off at  {{math|''J''}} = 0, which is the motionless orbit at the lowest value of the energy. These coordinates are just as canonical as  {{math|''x'',''p''}}, but the orbits are now lines of constant  {{math|''J''}} instead of nested ovoids in  {{math|''x''-''p''}} space.

The area enclosed by an orbit is [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] under canonical transformations, so it is the same in  {{math|''x''-''p''}} space as in  {{math|''J''-''θ''}}. But in the {{math|''J''-''θ''}} coordinates, this area is the area of a cylinder of unit circumference between 0 and  {{math|''J''}}, or just  {{math|''J''}}. So  {{math|''J''}} is equal to the area enclosed by the orbit in  {{math|''x-p''}} coordinates too,
:&lt;math&gt;
J = \int_0^T p {d x \over dt}\, dt  ~.
&lt;/math&gt;

The quantization rule is that the [[action-angle variables|action variable]]  {{math|''J''}} is an integer multiple of  {{math|''h''}}.

=== Multiperiodic motion: Bohr–Sommerfeld quantization ===

Bohr's correspondence principle provided a way to find the semiclassical quantization rule for a one degree of freedom system. It was an argument for the old quantum condition mostly independent from the one developed by [[Wilhelm Wien|Wien]] and Einstein, which focused on [[adiabatic invariant|adiabatic invariance]]. But both pointed to the same quantity, the action.

Bohr was reluctant to generalize the rule to systems with many degrees of freedom. This step was taken by [[Arnold Sommerfeld|Sommerfeld]], who proposed the general quantization rule for an [[integrable]] system,
:&lt;math&gt; J_k = h n_k. \, &lt;/math&gt;

Each action variable is a separate integer, a separate quantum number.

This condition reproduces the circular orbit condition for two dimensional motion: let  {{math|''r,θ''}} be polar coordinates for a central potential. Then  {{math|''θ''}} is already an angle variable, and the canonical momentum conjugate is  {{math|''L''}}, the angular momentum. So the quantum condition for  {{math|''L''}} reproduces Bohr's rule:
:&lt;math&gt;
\int_0^{2\pi} L d\theta = 2\pi L = n h.
&lt;/math&gt;

This allowed Sommerfeld to generalize Bohr's theory of circular orbits to elliptical orbits, showing that the energy levels are the same. He also found some general properties of quantum angular momentum which seemed paradoxical at the time. One of these results was that the z-component of the angular momentum, the classical inclination of an orbit relative to the z-axis, could only take on discrete values, a result which seemed to contradict rotational invariance. This was called ''space quantization'' for a while, but this term fell out of favor with the new quantum mechanics since no quantization of space is involved.

In modern quantum mechanics, the principle of superposition makes it clear that rotational invariance is not lost. It is possible to rotate objects with discrete orientations to produce superpositions of other discrete orientations, and this resolves the intuitive paradoxes of the Sommerfeld model.

===The quantum harmonic oscillator===

Here is a demonstration&lt;ref&gt;
{{Citation | last1=Sells | first1=Robert L. | last2=Weidner | first2=Richard T.
      | title=Elementary modern physics
      | publisher=Allyn and Bacon | location=Boston | isbn=978-0-205-06559-2 | year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;
of how large quantum numbers can give rise to classical (continuous) behavior.

Consider the one-dimensional [[quantum harmonic oscillator]]. Quantum mechanics tells us that the total (kinetic and potential) [[energy]] of the oscillator, {{math|''E''}}, has a set of discrete values,
:&lt;math&gt;E=(n+1/2)\hbar \omega, \ n=0, 1, 2, 3, \dots ~ ,&lt;/math&gt;
where  {{math| ''ω''}}  is the [[angular frequency]] of the oscillator.

However, in a [[harmonic oscillator|classical harmonic oscillator]] such as a lead ball attached to the end of a spring, we do not perceive any discreteness. Instead, the energy of such a macroscopic system appears to vary over a continuum of values. We can verify that our idea of [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] systems fall within the correspondence limit. The energy of the classical harmonic oscillator with [[amplitude]] {{math|''A''}},  is
:&lt;math&gt; E = \frac{m \omega ^2 A^2}{2} .&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the quantum number has the value
:&lt;math&gt; n = \frac{E}{\hbar \cdot \omega} - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{m \omega A^2}{2\hbar} -\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

If we apply typical "human-scale" values {{math|''m''}} = 1[[kilogram|kg]],   {{math| ''ω''}} = 1 [[radian|rad]]/[[second|s]], and {{math|''A''}} = 1 m, then {{math|''n''}} ≈ 4.74×10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;. This is a very large number, so the system is indeed in the correspondence limit.

It is simple to see why we perceive a continuum of energy in this limit.  With   {{math| ''ω''}} = 1  rad/s, the difference between each energy level is {{math|''ħω''}} ≈  1.05 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−34&lt;/sup&gt;[[Joule|J]], well below what we normally resolve for macroscopic systems. One then describes this system through an emergent [[classical limit]].

===Relativistic kinetic energy===

Here we show that the expression of [[kinetic energy]] from [[special relativity]] becomes arbitrarily close to the classical expression, for speeds that are much slower than the [[speed of light]],  {{math|''v  ≪  c''}}.

[[Einstein]]'s   mass-energy equation
:&lt;math&gt; E =  \frac{m_0} {\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}  c^2 ~, &lt;/math&gt;
where the velocity, {{math| ''v''}} is the velocity of the body relative to the observer, &lt;math&gt; m_0 \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[rest mass|''rest'' mass]] (the observed mass of the body at zero velocity relative to the observer), and {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]].

When the velocity {{math| ''v''}}  vanishes, the energy expressed above is not zero, and represents the [[rest energy|''rest'' energy]],
:&lt;math&gt; E_0 = m_0 c^2. \ &lt;/math&gt;

When the body '''is''' in motion relative to the observer, the total energy exceeds the rest energy by an amount that is, by definition, the ''kinetic'' energy,
:&lt;math&gt; T = E - E_0 =  \frac{m_0 c^2} {\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \ - \ m_0 c^2 ~. &lt;/math&gt;

Using the approximation
:&lt;math&gt; ( 1 + x  )^n \approx 1 + nx \ &lt;/math&gt;
:::for  &lt;math&gt; |x| \ll 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;
we get, when speeds are much slower than that of light, or  {{math|''v  ≪  c''}},  
{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt; T \ &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=m_0 c^2 \left( \frac{1} {\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} - 1 \right) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=m_0 c^2 \left( \left( 1 - v^2/c^2 \right) ^{-\frac{1}{2}} - 1 \right) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\approx m_0 c^2 \left( (1 - (-\begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix} )v^2/c^2) - 1 \right)  \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=m_0 c^2 \left( \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix} v^2/c^2 \right)  \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=  \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix} m_0 v^2  ~, &lt;/math&gt;
|}
which is the [[classical physics|Newtonian]] expression for [[kinetic energy]].

The '''disquotational principle''' is a philosophical [[theorem]]{{Citation needed|reason=What/where is the proof?|date=January 2018}} which holds that a rational speaker will accept "''p''" if and only if he or she believes ''p''. The quotes indicate that the statement ''p'' [[use–mention distinction|is being treated as a sentence, and not as a proposition]]. This principle is presupposed by claims that hold that [[First-order_logic#Equality_and_its_axioms|substitution]] fails in certain [[intension]]al contexts.

==Overview==
Consider the following argument:
:(1) Sally accepts the assertion that "[[Cicero]] was a famous [[orator]]" while dissenting from the assertion that "Tully was a famous [[orator]]".
:(2) Cicero is Tully
:Therefore, (3) Sally believes that Tully was a famous orator.

To derive (3), we have to assume that when Sally accepts that "Cicero was a famous orator", she believes that Cicero was a famous orator. Then we can exchange Cicero for Tully, and derive (3). [[Bertrand Russell]] thought that this demonstrated the failure of substitutivity of identicals in [[intension]]al contexts.

In "A Puzzle about Belief,"&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, Saul. "A Puzzle about Belief." First appeared in, ''Meaning and Use''. ed., A. Margalit. Dordrecht: D. Reidel, 1979. pp. 239–283&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saul Kripke]] argues that the application of the disquotational theorem can yield a paradox on its own, without appeal to the substitution principle, and that this may show that the problem lies with the former, and not the latter. There are various formulations of this argument.

Suppose that, Pierre, a Frenchman, comes to believe that (1) "''Londres est jolie''" (London is pretty), without ever having visited the city. Later in life, Pierre ends up living in London. He finds no French speakers there (he does not speak English yet), and everyone refers to the city as "London," not ''Londres''. He finds this city decidedly unattractive, for the neighborhood he decides to live in is decidedly unattractive. Over time, he learns English, and formulates the belief that (2) "''London is not pretty''". Pierre never realizes that London is the English word for ''Londres''. Now with the disquotational principle, we can deduce from (1) that Pierre believes the proposition that ''Londres est jolie''. With a weak principle of translation (e.g., "a proposition in language A is the same as a semantically identical proposition in language B" [note that a proposition is not the same as a sentence]), we can now deduce that Pierre believes that London is pretty. But we can also deduce from (2) and the disquotational principle that Pierre believes that London is not pretty. These deductions can be made ''even though Pierre has made no logical blunders in forming his beliefs''. Without the disquotational principle, this contradiction could not be derived, because we would not be able to assume that (1) and (2) meant anything in particular.

This paradox can also be derived without appeal to another language. Suppose that Pierre assents to the proposition that "[[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Paderewski]] had musical talent", perhaps having heard that this man was a famous pianist. With the disquotational principle, we can deduce that Pierre believes the proposition that Paderewski had musical talent. Now suppose that Pierre overhears a friend discussing the political exploits of a certain statesman, [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Paderewski]], without knowing that the two Paderewskis are the same man. Pierre's background tells him that statesmen are generally not very gifted in music, and this leads him to the belief that Paderewski had no musical talent. The disquotation principle allows us to deduce that Pierre believes the proposition that Paderewski had no musical talent. Using this principle, we have now deduced that Pierre believes that Paderewski had musical talent, and does not believe that Paderewski had musical talent, ''even though Pierre's beliefs were formed logically''.

--&gt;{{General relativity sidebar |fundamentals}}

In the [[theory]] of [[general relativity]], the '''equivalence principle''' is the equivalence of [[Gravitational mass|gravitational]] and [[Mass#Inertial mass|inertial mass]], and [[Albert Einstein's]] observation that the gravitational "force" as experienced locally while standing on a massive body (such as the Earth) is the same as the ''[[fictitious force|pseudo-force]]'' experienced by an observer in a non-[[inertial frame of reference|inertial]] (accelerated) [[frame of reference]].

== Einstein's statement of the equality of inertial and gravitational mass ==
{{Quotation|
A little reflection will show that the law of the equality of the inertial and gravitational mass is equivalent to the assertion that the acceleration imparted to a body by a gravitational field is independent of the nature of the body. For Newton's equation of motion in a gravitational field, written out in full, it is:
:(Inertial mass) &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; (Acceleration) &lt;math&gt; = &lt;/math&gt; (Intensity of the gravitational field) &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; (Gravitational mass).
It is only when there is numerical equality between the inertial and gravitational mass that the acceleration is independent of the nature of the body.&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert, ''How I Constructed the Theory of Relativity'', translated by Masahiro Morikawa from the text recorded in Japanese by Jun Ishiwara, Association of Asia Pacific Physical Societies (AAPPS) Bulletin, Vol. 15, No. 2, pp. 17–19, April 2005. Einstein recalls events of 1907 in a talk in Japan on 14 December 1922.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Einstein|first1=Albert|title=The Meaning of Relativity|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134449798|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

== Development of gravitation theory ==
[[File:Apollo 15 feather and hammer drop.ogv|right|thumb|During the [[Apollo 15]] mission in 1971, astronaut [[David Scott]] showed that Galileo was right: acceleration is the same for all bodies subject to gravity on the Moon, even for a hammer and a feather.]]Something like the equivalence principle emerged in the early 17th century, when [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] expressed [[experiment]]ally that the [[acceleration]] of a [[test mass]] due to [[gravitation]] is independent of the amount of [[mass]] being accelerated.

Kepler, using Galileo's discoveries, showed knowledge of the equivalence principle by accurately describing what would occur if the moon were stopped in its orbit and dropped towards Earth. This can be deduced without knowing if or in what manner gravity decreases with distance, but requires assuming the equivalency between gravity and inertia.

{{quote|If two stones were placed in any part of the world near each other, and beyond the sphere of influence of a third cognate body, these stones, like two magnetic needles, would come together in the intermediate point, each approaching the other by a space proportional to the comparative mass of the other. If the moon and earth were not retained in their orbits by their animal force or some other equivalent, the earth would mount to the moon by a fifty-fourth part of their distance, and the moon fall towards the earth through the other fifty-three parts, and they would there meet, assuming, however, that the substance of both is of the same density.|Kepler, "Astronomia Nova", 1609&lt;ref&gt;http://quotes.yourdictionary.com/orbits/quote/71225/&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The 1/54 ratio is [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]'s estimate of the Moon–Earth mass ratio, based on their diameters. The accuracy of his statement can be deduced by using [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s inertia law F=ma and Galileo's gravitational observation that distance &lt;math&gt;D = (1/2)at^2&lt;/math&gt;.  Setting these accelerations equal for a mass is the equivalence principle. Noting the time to collision for each mass is the same gives Kepler's statement that D&lt;sub&gt;moon&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;=M&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;moon&lt;/sub&gt;, without knowing the time to collision or how or if the acceleration force from gravity is a function of distance.

Newton's [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|gravitational theory]] simplified and formalized [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s and Kepler's ideas by recognizing Kepler's "animal force or some other equivalent" beyond gravity and inertia were not needed, deducing from Kepler's planetary laws how gravity reduces with distance.

The equivalence principle was properly introduced by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1907, when he observed that the acceleration of bodies towards the center of the Earth at a rate of 1''[[g-force|''g'']]'' (''g'' = 9.81&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; being a standard reference of gravitational acceleration at the Earth's surface) is equivalent to the acceleration of an inertially moving body that would be observed on a rocket in free space being accelerated at a rate of 1''g''. Einstein stated it thus:

{{quote|we [...] assume the complete physical equivalence of a gravitational field and a corresponding [[accelerated reference frame|acceleration of the reference system]].|Einstein, 1907}}

That is, being on the surface of the Earth is equivalent to being inside a spaceship (far from any sources of gravity) that is being accelerated by its engines. The direction or vector of acceleration equivalence on the surface of the earth is "up" or directly opposite the center of the planet while the vector of acceleration in a spaceship is directly opposite from the mass ejected by its thrusters. From this principle, Einstein deduced that [[free-fall]] is [[inertial frame|inertial motion]]. Objects in free-fall do not experience being accelerated downward (e.g. toward the earth or other massive body) but rather weightlessness and no acceleration. In an [[inertial frame of reference]] bodies (and photons, or light) obey [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's first law|Newton's first law]], moving at constant velocity in straight lines. Analogously, in a curved [[spacetime]] the [[world line]] of an inertial particle or pulse of light is ''as straight as possible'' (in space ''and'' time).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.luther.edu/~macdonal/EGR.pdf |page=32 |title=General Relativity in a Nutshell |first=Alan |last=Macdonald |date=September 15, 2012 |accessdate=February 8, 2013 |publisher=[[Luther College (Iowa)|Luther College]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a world line is called a [[Geodesics in general relativity|geodesic]] and from the point of view of the inertial frame is a straight line. This is why an [[accelerometer]] in free-fall doesn't register any acceleration; there isn't any.

As an example: an inertial body moving along a geodesic through space can be trapped into an orbit around a large gravitational mass without ever experiencing acceleration. This is possible because spacetime is radically curved in close vicinity to a large gravitational mass. In such a situation the [[geodesic]] lines bend inward around the center of the mass and a free-floating (weightless) inertial body will simply follow those curved geodesics into an elliptical orbit. An accelerometer on-board would never record any acceleration.

By contrast, in [[Newtonian mechanics]], [[gravity]] is assumed to be a [[force]]. This force draws objects having mass towards the center of any massive body. At the Earth's surface, the force of gravity is counteracted by the mechanical (physical) resistance of the Earth's surface. So in Newtonian physics, a person at rest on the surface of a (non-rotating) massive object is in an inertial frame of reference. These considerations suggest the following corollary to the equivalence principle, which Einstein formulated precisely in 1911:

{{quote|Whenever an observer detects the local presence of a force that acts on all objects in direct proportion to the inertial mass of each object, that observer is in an accelerated frame of reference.}}

Einstein also referred to two reference frames, K and K'. K is a uniform gravitational field, whereas K' has no gravitational field but is [[uniform acceleration|uniformly accelerated]] such that objects in the two frames experience identical forces:

{{quote|We arrive at a very satisfactory interpretation of this law of experience, if we assume that the systems K and K' are physically exactly equivalent, that is, if we assume that we may just as well regard the system K as being in a space free from gravitational fields, if we then regard K as uniformly accelerated. This assumption of exact physical equivalence makes it impossible for us to speak of the absolute acceleration of the system of reference, just as the usual theory of relativity forbids us to talk of the absolute velocity of a system; and it makes the equal falling of all bodies in a gravitational field seem a matter of course.|Einstein, 1911}}

This observation was the start of a process that culminated in [[general relativity]]. Einstein suggested that it should be elevated to the status of a general principle, which he called the "principle of equivalence" when constructing his theory of relativity:

{{quote|As long as we restrict ourselves to purely mechanical processes in the realm where Newton's mechanics holds sway, we are certain of the equivalence of the systems K and K'. But this view of ours will not have any deeper significance unless the systems K and K' are equivalent with respect to all physical processes, that is, unless the laws of nature with respect to K are in entire agreement with those with respect to K'. By assuming this to be so, we arrive at a principle which, if it is really true, has great heuristic importance. For by theoretical consideration of processes which take place relatively to a system of reference with uniform acceleration, we obtain information as to the career of processes in a homogeneous gravitational field.|Einstein, 1911}}

Einstein combined ([[postulate]]d) the equivalence principle with [[special relativity]] to predict that clocks run at different rates in a [[gravitational potential]], and light rays [[bending of starlight|bend]] in a gravitational field, even before he developed the concept of curved spacetime.

So the original equivalence principle, as described by Einstein, concluded that free-fall and inertial motion were physically equivalent. This form of the equivalence principle can be stated as follows. An observer in a windowless room cannot distinguish between being on the surface of the Earth, and being in a spaceship in deep space accelerating at 1g. This is not strictly true, because massive bodies give rise to [[tidal force|tidal effects]] (caused by variations in the strength and direction of the gravitational field) which are absent from an accelerating spaceship in deep space. The room, therefore, should be small enough that tidal effects can be neglected.

Although the equivalence principle guided the development of [[general relativity]], it is not a founding principle of relativity but rather a simple consequence of the ''geometrical'' nature of the theory. In general relativity, objects in free-fall follow [[Geodesic (general relativity)|geodesic]]s of spacetime, and what we perceive as the force of [[gravity]] is instead a result of our being unable to follow those geodesics of spacetime, because the mechanical resistance of matter prevents us from doing so.

Since Einstein developed general relativity, there was a need to develop a framework to test the theory against other possible theories of gravity compatible with [[special relativity]]. This was developed by [[Robert H. Dicke|Robert Dicke]] as part of his program to test general relativity. Two new principles were suggested, the so-called Einstein equivalence principle and the strong equivalence principle, each of which assumes the weak equivalence principle as a starting point. They only differ in whether or not they apply to gravitational experiments.

Another clarification needed is that the equivalence principle assumes a constant acceleration of 1g without considering the mechanics of generating 1g. If we do consider the mechanics of it, then we must assume the aforementioned windowless room has a fixed mass. Accelerating it at 1g means there is a constant force being applied, which = m*g where m is the mass of the windowless room along with its contents (including the observer). Now, if the observer jumps inside the room, an object lying freely on the floor will decrease in weight momentarily because the acceleration is going to decrease momentarily due to the observer pushing back against the floor in order to jump. The object will then gain weight while the observer is in the air and the resulting decreased mass of the windowless room allows greater acceleration; it will lose weight again when the observer lands and pushes once more against the floor; and it will finally return to its initial weight afterwards. To make all these effects equal those we would measure on a planet producing 1g, the windowless room must be assumed to have the same mass as that planet. Additionally, the windowless room must not cause its own gravity, otherwise the scenario changes even further. These are technicalities, clearly, but practical ones if we wish the experiment to demonstrate more or less precisely the equivalence of 1g gravity and 1g acceleration.

==Modern usage==
Three forms of the equivalence principle are in current use: weak (Galilean), Einsteinian, and strong.

===The weak equivalence principle===
&lt;!-- Universality of free fall and weak equivalence principle redirect to this subsection.  Please do not change its title without making sure the redirects work properly. --&gt;
The '''weak equivalence principle''', also known as the '''universality of free fall''' or the '''Galilean equivalence principle''' can be stated in many ways.  The strong EP includes (astronomic) bodies with gravitational binding energy&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Todd A.; Schlamminger, Stephan; Gundlach, Jens H.; Adelberger, Eric G.; "Torsion-balance tests of the weak equivalence principle", ''Classical and Quantum Gravity'' 29, 184002 (2012); https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.2442&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., 1.74 solar-mass pulsar PSR J1903+0327, 15.3% of whose separated mass is absent as gravitational binding energy&lt;ref&gt;Champion, David J.; Ransom, Scott M.; Lazarus, Patrick; Camilo, Fernando; et al.; ''Science'' 320(5881), 1309 (2008), https://arxiv.org/abs/0805.2396&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2018}}).  The weak EP assumes falling bodies are bound by non-gravitational forces only. Either way:

:The trajectory of a point mass in a gravitational field depends only on its initial position and velocity, and is independent of its composition and ''structure''.

:All test particles at the alike spacetime point, in a given gravitational field, will undergo the same acceleration, independent of their properties, including their rest mass.&lt;ref name="Wesson"&gt;{{cite book |title=Five-dimensional Physics |first=Paul S. |last=Wesson |page=82 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dSv8ksxHR0oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:Five+intitle:Dimensional+intitle:Physics |isbn=978-981-256-661-4 |publisher=World Scientific |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:All local centers of mass free-fall (in vacuum) along identical (parallel-displaced, same speed) minimum action trajectories independent of all observable properties.

:The vacuum world-line of a body immersed in a gravitational field is independent of all observable properties.

:The local effects of motion in a curved spacetime (gravitation) are indistinguishable from those of an accelerated observer in flat spacetime, without exception.

:Mass (measured with a balance) and weight (measured with a scale) are locally in identical ratio for all bodies (the opening page to Newton's ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', 1687).

'''Locality''' eliminates measurable tidal forces originating from a radial divergent gravitational field (e.g., the Earth) upon finite sized physical bodies.  The "falling" equivalence principle embraces Galileo's, Newton's, and Einstein's conceptualization.  The equivalence principle does not deny the existence of measurable effects caused by a ''rotating'' gravitating mass ([[frame dragging]]), or bear on the measurements of [[General relativity#Light deflection and gravitational time delay|light deflection and gravitational time delay]] made by non-local observers.

==== Active, passive, and inertial masses ====

By definition of active and passive gravitational mass, the force on &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; due to the gravitational field of &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; is:

::&lt;math&gt;F_1 = \frac{M_0^\mathrm{act} M_1^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;
Likewise the force on a second object of arbitrary mass&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; due to the gravitational field of mass&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is:

::&lt;math&gt;F_2 = \frac{M_0^\mathrm{act}  M_2^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

By definition of inertial mass:

::&lt;math&gt;F = m^\mathrm{inert} a&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_2&lt;/math&gt; are the same distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt; then, by the weak equivalence principle, they fall at the same rate (i.e. their accelerations are the same)

::&lt;math&gt;a_1 = \frac{F_1}{m_1^\mathrm{inert}} = a_2 = \frac{F_2}{m_2^\mathrm{inert}}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{M_0^\mathrm{act} M_1^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2 m_1^\mathrm{inert}} = \frac{M_0^\mathrm{act}  M_2^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2 m_2^\mathrm{inert}}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{M_1^\mathrm{pass}}{m_1^\mathrm{inert}} = \frac{M_2^\mathrm{pass}}{m_2^\mathrm{inert}}&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, passive gravitational mass must be proportional to inertial mass for all objects.

Furthermore, by [[Newton's third law of motion]]:

::&lt;math&gt;F_1 = \frac{M_0^\mathrm{act} M_1^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;
must be equal and opposite to

::&lt;math&gt;F_0 = \frac{M_1^\mathrm{act}  M_0^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{M_0^\mathrm{act}}{M_0^\mathrm{pass}} = \frac{M_1^\mathrm{act}}{M_1^\mathrm{pass}}&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, passive gravitational mass must be proportional to active gravitational mass for all objects.

The dimensionless Eötvös-parameter &lt;math&gt;\eta(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; is the difference of the ratios of gravitational and inertial masses divided by their average for the two sets of test masses "A" and "B."

:&lt;math&gt;\eta(A,B)=2\frac{ \left(\frac{m_g}{m_i}\right)_A-\left(\frac{m_g}{m_i}\right)_B }{\left(\frac{m_g}{m_i}\right)_A+\left(\frac{m_g}{m_i}\right)_B}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!-- I have created [[User talk:Lemmiwinks2#Redundant edits (active, passive, and inertial masses)|a list of known places where the above material appears]]. --&gt;

====Tests of the weak equivalence principle====

Tests of the weak equivalence principle are those that verify the equivalence of gravitational mass and inertial mass. An obvious test is dropping different objects, ideally in a vacuum environment, e.g., inside the [[Fallturm Bremen]] drop tower.

Proposals that may lead to a [[quantum gravity|quantum theory of gravity]] such as [[string theory]] and [[loop quantum gravity]] predict violations of the weak equivalence principle because they contain many light [[scalar field]]s with long [[Compton wavelength]]s, which should generate [[fifth force]]s and variation of the fundamental constants. Heuristic arguments suggest that the magnitude of these equivalence principle violations could be in the 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−18&lt;/sup&gt; range.&lt;ref name="Overduin2009" /&gt; Currently envisioned tests of the weak equivalence principle are approaching a degree of sensitivity such that ''non-discovery'' of a violation would be just as profound a result as discovery of a violation. Non-discovery of equivalence principle violation in this range would suggest that gravity is so fundamentally different from other forces as to require a major reevaluation of current attempts to unify gravity with the other forces of nature. A positive detection, on the other hand, would provide a major guidepost towards unification.&lt;ref name="Overduin2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Overduin | first1 = James | last2 = Everitt | first2 = Francis | last3 = Mester | first3 = John | last4 = Worden | first4 = Paul | title = The Science Case for STEP | doi = 10.1016/j.asr.2009.02.012 | journal = Advances in Space Research | volume = 43 | issue = 10 | pages = 1532–1537 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = 0902.2247 |bibcode = 2009AdSpR..43.1532O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Einstein equivalence principle===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Gravitational field]] --&gt;
What is now called the "Einstein equivalence principle" states that the weak equivalence principle holds, and that:&lt;ref name="Lāmmerzahl"&gt;{{cite book |last=Haugen |first=Mark P. |first2=Claus |last2=Lämmerzahl |title=Principles of Equivalence: Their Role in Gravitation Physics and Experiments that Test Them |journal=Gyros |volume=562 |pages=195–212 |year=2001 |isbn=978-3-540-41236-6 |arxiv=gr-qc/0103067|bibcode=2001LNP...562..195H |doi=10.1007/3-540-40988-2_10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
: ''The outcome of any local non-gravitational experiment in a freely falling laboratory is independent of the velocity of the laboratory and its location in spacetime.''
Here "local" has a very special meaning: not only must the experiment not look outside the laboratory, but it must also be small compared to variations in the gravitational field, [[tidal forces]], so that the entire laboratory is freely falling. It also implies the absence of interactions with "external" fields ''other than the gravitational field''.{{Citation needed|reason = Definition of "local" in this context. In particular its relation to external fields as stated is dubious. If there are external fields than the equivalence principle doesn't trigger due to the "in a freely falling"-part in the statement. If *no external fields* would be part of the definition of "local", then "free falling" would be redundant.|date=August 2011}}

The [[principle of relativity]] implies that the outcome of local experiments must be independent of the velocity of the apparatus, so the most important consequence of this principle is the Copernican idea that [[dimensionless]] physical values such as the [[fine-structure constant]] and [[electron]]-to-[[proton]] mass ratio must not depend on where in space or time we measure them.  Many physicists believe that any [[Lorentz invariance|Lorentz invariant]] theory that satisfies the weak equivalence principle also satisfies the Einstein equivalence principle.

''[[Leonard I. Schiff|Schiff]]'s conjecture'' suggests that the weak equivalence principle implies the Einstein equivalence principle, but it has not been proven. Nonetheless, the two principles are tested with very different kinds of experiments. The Einstein equivalence principle has been criticized as imprecise, because there is no universally accepted way to distinguish gravitational from non-gravitational experiments (see for instance Hadley&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mark J. |last=Hadley |doi=10.1007/BF02764119 |journal=Foundations of Physics Letters |volume=10 |issue=1 |title=The Logic of Quantum Mechanics Derived from Classical General Relativity |pages=43–60 |year=1997 |arxiv=quant-ph/9706018|bibcode = 1997FoPhL..10...43H |citeseerx=10.1.1.252.6335 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Durand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Durand | first1 = Stéphane | year = 2002| title = An amusing analogy: modelling quantum-type behaviours with wormhole-based time travel | url = http://stacks.iop.org/ob/4/S351 | journal = Journal of Optics B: Quantum and Semiclassical Optics | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = S351–S357| doi = 10.1088/1464-4266/4/4/319 | bibcode = 2002JOptB...4S.351D }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

====Tests of the Einstein equivalence principle====
In addition to the tests of the weak equivalence principle, the Einstein equivalence principle can be tested by searching for variation of [[dimensionless]] [[fundamental physical constants|constants and mass ratios]]. The present best limits on the variation of the fundamental constants have mainly been set by studying the naturally occurring [[Oklo]] [[natural nuclear fission reactor]], where nuclear reactions similar to ones we observe today have been shown to have occurred underground approximately two billion years ago. These reactions are extremely sensitive to the values of the fundamental constants.

There have been a number of controversial attempts to constrain the variation of the [[strong interaction]] constant. There have been several suggestions that "constants" do vary on cosmological scales. The best known is the reported detection of variation (at the 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; level) of the fine-structure constant from measurements of distant [[quasar]]s, see Webb et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=John K. |last1=Webb |first2=Michael T. |last2=Murphy |first3=Victor V. |last3=Flambaum |first4=Vladimir A. |last4=Dzuba |first5=John D. |last5=Barrow |first6=Chris W. |last6=Churchill |first7=Jason X. |last7=Prochaska |first8=Arthur M. |last8=Wolfe |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.87.091301 |journal=Physical Review Letters |title=Further Evidence for Cosmological Evolution of the Fine Structure Constant |volume=87 |issue=9 |year=2001 |arxiv=astro-ph/0012539 |pmid=11531558 |bibcode=2001PhRvL..87i1301W |pages=091301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers{{who|date=November 2018}} dispute these findings. Other tests of the Einstein equivalence principle are [[gravitational redshift]] experiments, such as the [[Pound–Rebka experiment]] which test the position independence of experiments.

===The strong equivalence principle===
The strong equivalence principle suggests the laws of gravitation are independent of velocity and location. In particular,
:''The gravitational motion of a small test body depends only on its initial position in spacetime and velocity, and not on its constitution.''
and
: ''The outcome of any local experiment (gravitational or not) in a freely falling laboratory is independent of the velocity of the laboratory and its location in spacetime.''
The first part is a version of the weak equivalence principle that applies to objects that exert a gravitational force on themselves, such as stars, planets, black holes or [[Cavendish experiment]]s. The second part is the Einstein equivalence principle (with the same definition of "local"), restated to allow gravitational experiments and self-gravitating bodies. The freely-falling object or laboratory, however, must still be small, so that tidal forces may be neglected (hence "local experiment").

This is the only form of the equivalence principle that applies to self-gravitating objects (such as stars), which have substantial internal gravitational interactions. It requires that the [[gravitational constant]] be the same everywhere in the universe and is incompatible with a [[fifth force]]. It is much more restrictive than the Einstein equivalence principle.

The strong equivalence principle suggests that gravity is entirely geometrical by nature (that is, the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric]] alone determines the effect of gravity) and does not have any extra fields associated with it. If an observer measures a patch of space to be flat, then the strong equivalence principle suggests that it is absolutely equivalent to any other patch of flat space elsewhere in the universe. Einstein's theory of general relativity (including the [[cosmological constant]]) is thought to be the only theory of gravity that satisfies the strong equivalence principle. A number of alternative theories, such as [[Brans–Dicke theory]], satisfy only the Einstein equivalence principle.

====Tests of the strong equivalence principle====
The strong equivalence principle can be tested by searching for a variation of Newton's gravitational constant ''G'' over the life of the universe, or equivalently, variation in the masses of the fundamental particles. A number of independent constraints, from orbits in the solar system and studies of [[big bang nucleosynthesis]] have shown that ''G'' cannot have varied by more than 10%.

Thus, the strong equivalence principle can be tested by searching for [[fifth force]]s (deviations from the gravitational force-law predicted by general relativity). These experiments typically look for failures of the [[inverse-square law]] (specifically [[Yukawa potential|Yukawa forces]] or failures of [[Birkhoff's theorem (relativity)|Birkhoff's theorem]]) behavior of gravity in the laboratory. The most accurate tests over short distances have been performed by the Eöt–Wash group. A future satellite experiment, SEE (Satellite Energy Exchange), will search for fifth forces in space and should be able to further constrain violations of the strong equivalence principle. Other limits, looking for much longer-range forces, have been placed by searching for the [[Nordtvedt effect]], a "polarization" of solar system orbits that would be caused by gravitational self-energy accelerating at a different rate from normal matter. This effect has been sensitively tested by the [[Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment]]. Other tests include studying the deflection of radiation from [[astronomical radio source|distant radio sources]] by the sun, which can be accurately measured by [[very long baseline interferometry]]. Another sensitive test comes from measurements of the frequency shift of signals to and from the [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]] spacecraft. Together, these measurements have put tight limits on [[Brans–Dicke theory]] and other alternative theories of gravity.

In 2014, astronomers discovered a stellar triple system including a millisecond [[pulsar]] [[PSR J0337+1715]] and two [[white dwarf]]s orbiting it. The system provided them a chance to test the strong equivalence principle in a strong gravitational field with high accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature12917.html#ref7 |title=A millisecond pulsar in a stellar triple system |first1=Scott M. |last1=Ransom |display-authors=etal |journal=Nature |year=2014 |accessdate=8 January 2014 |doi=10.1038/nature12917 |arxiv = 1401.0535 |bibcode = 2014Natur.505..520R |volume=505 |issue=7484 |pages=520–524 |pmid=24390352}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Universality of free fall from the orbital motion of a pulsar in a stellar triple system|author=Anne M.

==Challenges==
One challenge to the equivalence principle is the [[Brans–Dicke theory]]. [[Self-creation cosmology]] is a modification of the Brans–Dicke theory. The [[Fredkin Finite Nature Hypothesis]] is an even more radical challenge to the equivalence principle and has even fewer supporters.

In August 2010, researchers from the University of New South Wales, Swinburne University of Technology, and Cambridge University published a paper titled "Evidence for spatial variation of the [[fine structure constant]]", whose tentative conclusion is that, "qualitatively, [the] results suggest a violation of the Einstein Equivalence Principle, and could infer a very large or infinite universe, within which our 'local' [[Hubble volume]] represents a tiny fraction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1008.3907 |first1=John K. |last1=Webb |first2=Julian A. |last2=King |first3=Michael T. |last3=Murphy |first4=Victor V. |last4=Flambaum |first5=Robert F. |last5=Carswell |first6=Matthew B. |last6=Bainbridge |title=Evidence for spatial variation of the fine structure constant |year=2010 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.191101 |pmid=22181590 |volume=107 |issue=19 |pages=191101 |journal=Physical Review Letters |bibcode=2011PhRvL.107s1101W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Einstein's Mistakes'', pages 226–227, Hans C. Ohanian describes several situations which falsify Einstein's Equivalence Principle. Inertial accelerative effects are analogous to, but not equivalent to, gravitational effects.  Ohanian cites Ehrenfest for this same opinion.

==Explanations==
Dutch physicist and [[string theory|string theorist]] [[Erik Verlinde]] has generated a self-contained, logical derivation of the equivalence principle based on the starting assumption of a [[holographic universe]].  Given this situation, gravity would not be a true [[fundamental force]] as is currently thought but instead an "[[emergent property]]" related to [[entropy]].  Verlinde's [[entropic gravity]] theory apparently leads naturally to the correct observed strength of [[dark energy]]; previous failures to explain its incredibly small magnitude have been called by such people as cosmologist [[Michael Turner (cosmologist)|Michael Turner]] (who is credited as having coined the term "dark energy") as "the greatest embarrassment in the history of theoretical physics".&lt;ref name=Wright2001&gt;{{cite web |last=Wright |first=Karen |title=Very Dark Energy |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2001/mar/featdark#.USwYk6XmjoI |publisher=Discover Magazine |accessdate=26 February 2013 |date=1 March 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it should be noted that these ideas are far from settled and still very controversial.

The [[equivalence principle]] is one of the corner-stones of [[gravitation|gravitation theory]].  Different formulations of the '''equivalence principle''' are labeled ''weakest'', ''weak'', ''middle-strong'' and ''strong.''  All of these formulations are based on the empirical equality of inertial mass, gravitational active and passive charges.

The ''weakest'' equivalence principle is restricted to the motion law of a probe point mass in a uniform [[gravitational field]]. Its localization is the ''weak'' equivalence principle that states the existence of a desired local inertial frame at a given world point. This is the case of equations depending on a gravitational field and its first order derivatives, e. g., the equations of mechanics of probe point masses, and the equations of electromagnetic and Dirac fermion fields. The ''middle-strong'' equivalence principle is concerned with any matter, except a gravitational field, while the ''strong'' one is applied to all physical laws.

The above-mentioned variants of the equivalence principle aim to guarantee the transition of [[General Relativity]] to [[Special Relativity]] in a certain [[frame of reference|reference frame]]. However, only the particular ''weakest'' and ''weak'' equivalence principles are true. 
To overcome this difficulty, the equivalence principle can be formulated in geometric terms as follows.

In the spirit of [[Felix Klein|Felix Klein's]] [[Erlanger program]], Special Relativity can be characterized as the [[Klein geometry]] of [[Lorentz group]] invariants. Then the '''geometric equivalence principle''' is formulated to require the existence of Lorentz invariants on a [[world manifold]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X}\,&lt;/math&gt;. This requirement holds if the [[tangent bundle]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{TX}\,&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X}\,&lt;/math&gt; admits an atlas with Lorentz transition functions, i.e., a structure group of the associated [[frame bundle]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{FX}\,&lt;/math&gt; of linear tangent frames in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{TX}\,&lt;/math&gt; is reduced to the Lorentz group &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathrm{SO}(1,3)}\,&lt;/math&gt;. By virtue of the well known theorem on [[reduction of the structure group|structure group reduction]], this reduction takes place if and only if the quotient bundle &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{FX/\mathrm{SO}(1,3)}\to \scriptstyle{X}\,&lt;/math&gt; possesses a global section, which is a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-Riemannian metric]] on &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X}\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus the geometric equivalence principle provides the necessary and sufficient conditions of the existence of a pseudo-Riemannian metric, i.e., a [[gravitational field]] on a world manifold.

Based on the geometric equivalence principle, gravitation theory is formulated as [[gauge gravitation theory|gauge theory]] where a gravitational field is described as a [[Higgs field (classical)|classical Higgs field]] responsible for spontaneous breakdown of space-time symmetries.

'''The principle of evidential existentiality''' in [[philosophy]] is a principle that explains and gives value to the [[existence]] of entities. The principle states that the reality of an entity's existence gives greater value to prove its existence than would be given through any outward studies. The principle has become a backbone of [[Arguments for the existence of God|the God argument]], stating that because God is a [[self-evidence|self-evident]] entity, His existence can only be shared by humans, thus proof of God is unnecessary and moot.
It appears that the existence is primarily evident to the self only. The God or Supreme self is perceivable to the self. So evidentially self perception is followed by God perception and so on.

'''''Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought''''' is a 1995 book by [[Douglas Hofstadter]] and other members of the Fluid Analogies Research Group exploring the mechanisms of [[intelligence]] through [[computer model]]ing. It contends that the notions of [[analogy]] and fluidity are fundamental to explain how the human [[mind]] solves problems and to create computer programs that show intelligent behavior. It analyzes several computer programs that members of the group have created over the years to solve problems that require intelligence.

It was the first book ever sold by [[Amazon.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=irol-corporateTimeline|title=Amazon Media Room: History &amp; Timeline|website=phx.corporate-ir.net|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the book==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}
The book is a collection of revised articles that appeared in precedence, each preceded by an introduction by Hofstadter.
They describe the scientific work by him and his collaborators in the 1980s and 1990s.
The project started in the late 1970s at Indiana University.
In 1983 he took a sabbatical year at MIT, working in [[Marvin Minsky]]'s Artificial Intelligence Lab.
There he met and collaborated with [[Melanie Mitchell]], who then became his doctoral student.
Subsequently, Hofstadter moved to the University of Michigan, where the FARG (Fluid Analogies Research Group) was founded.
Eventually he returned to Indiana University in 1988, continuing the FARG research there.
The book was written during a sabbatical year at the Istituto per la Ricerca Scientifica e Tecnologica in Trento, Italy.

==Publication==
Upon publication, [[Jon Udell]], a [[Byte (magazine)|BYTE]] senior technical editor-at-large said:&lt;ref name="byte"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Fifteen years ago, ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach|Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]]'' exploded on the literary scene, earning its author a [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction#1980s|Pulitzer prize]] and a monthly column in ''[[Scientific American]]''. Douglas Hofstadter's exuberant synthesis of math, music, and art, and his inspired thought experiments with "tangled hierarchy," recursion, pattern recognition, figure/ground reversal, and self-reference, delighted armchair philosophers and AI theorists. But in the end, many people believed that these intellectual games yielded no useful model of cognition on which to base future AI research. Now ''Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies'' presents that model, along with the computer programs Hofstadter and his associates have designed to test it. These programs work in stripped-down yet surprisingly rich microdomains.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On April 3, 1995, ''Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies'' became the first book ordered online by an Amazon.com customer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketwatch.com/story/meet-amazons-first-ever-customer-2015-04-22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary of chapters==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}

===Chapter 1:To Seek Whence Cometh a Sequence===
The first [[AI]] project by Hofstadter stemmed from his teenage fascination with [[integer sequence|number sequences]].
When he was 17, he studied the way that [[triangular numbers|triangular]] and [[square numbers]] interleave, and eventually found a [[recursive relation]] describing it.
In his first course on AI, he set to the students and to himself the task of writing a program that could extrapolate the rule by which a numeric sequence is generated.
He discusses [[Breadth-first search|breadth-first]] and [[Depth-first search|depth-first]] techniques, but eventually concludes that the results represent [[expert system]]s that incarnate a lot of technical knowledge but don't shine much light on the mental processes that humans use to solve such puzzles.

Instead he devised a simplified version of the problem, called SeekWhence, where sequences are based on very simple basic rules not requiring advanced mathematical knowledge.
He argues that [[pattern recognition]], analogy, and fluid working hypotheses are fundamental to understand how humans tackle such problems.

===Chapter 2:The Architecture of Jumbo===
Jumbo is a program to solve [[jumble]]s, word puzzles consisting in five or six scrambled letters that need to be [[anagram]]med to form an English word.
The resulting word does not need to be a real one but just to a plausible, that is, to consists of a sequence of letters that is normal in English.

The constituent elements of Jumbo are the following:
* The "chunkabet": a database of chunks, small sequences of letters, with a numeric value giving their strength as possible components of a word.
* The "[[cytoplasm]]": a loose data structure containing partial associations of letter, modeling a form of [[working memory]]. The name is inspired by the place in a cell where molecular fragments are assembled into proteins.
* The "Coderack": a structure containing "codelets", small pieces of programs that are waiting to be executed in the cytoplasm; the codelet that is executed next is chosen non-deterministically, based on urgencies attached to them; a codelet may form new associations, break down old ones, or generate more codelets.
A "temperature" is associated to the present state of the cytoplasm; it determines how probable it is that a destructive codelet is executed.
There is a "freezing" temperature at which no destruction can occur anymore: a solution has been found.

===Chapter 3:Numbo: A Study in Cognition and Recognition===
Numbo is a program by [[Daniel Defays]] that tries to solve numerical problems similar to those used in the French game [[Des chiffres et des lettres#Le compte est bon .28.22the total is right.22.29|"Le compte est bon"]]. The game consists in combining some numbers called "bricks", using the operations of multiplication, addition, and subtraction, to obtain a given result.

The program is modeled on Jumbo and [[Copycat (software)|Copycat]] and uses a permanent network of known mathematical facts, a working memory in the form of a cytoplasm, and a coderack containing codelets to produce free associations of bricks in order to arrive at the result.

===Chapter 4:Highlevel Perception, Representation, and Analogy===
The chapter subtitle ''A Critique of Artificial-intelligence Methodology'' indicates that this is a polemical article, in which [[David Chalmers]], [[Robert M. French|Robert French]], and [[Douglas_Hofstadter|Hofstadter]] criticize most of the research going on at that time (the early '80s) as exaggerating results and missing the central features of human intelligence.

Some of these AI projects, like the [[structure mapping engine]] (SME), claimed to model high faculties of the human mind and to be able to understand literary analogies and to rediscover important scientific breakthroughs.
In the introduction, Hofstadter warns about the [[Eliza effect]] that leads people to attribute understanding to a computer program that only uses a few stock phrases.
The authors claim that the input data for such impressive results are already heavily structured in the direction of the intended discovery and only a simple matching task is left to the computer.

Their main claim is that it is impossible to model high-level cognition without at the same time modeling low-level perception.
While cognition is necessarily based on perception, they argue that it in turn influences perception itself.
Therefore, a sound AI project should try to model the two together.
In a slogan repeated several times throughout the book: ''cognition is recognition''.

Since human perception is too complex to be modelled by available technology, they favor the restriction of AI projects to limited domains like the one used for the Copycat project.

===Chapter 5:The Copycat Project===
This chapter presents, as stated in the full title, ''A Model of Mental Fluidity and Analogy-making''.
It is a description of the architecture of the [[Copycat (software)|Copycat]] program, developed by Hofstadter and [[Melanie Mitchell]].
The field of application of the program is a domain of short alphabetic sequences.
A typical puzzle is: ''If '''abc''' were changed to '''abd''', how would you change '''ijk''' in the same way?''.
The program tries to find an answer using a strategy supposedly similar to the way the human mind tackles the question.

Copycat has three major components:
*The ''Slipnet'', a model of long-term memory in humans. It contains concepts of various degrees of abstraction, from the letter types to the notion of ''opposite''. Concepts are connected with links indicating their similarity. The activation of a node may cause the activation of a neighbor with a probability proportional to the inverse of the length of their link. The lengths of these links are not static; they have a value at the beginning but they may change elastically during computation according to the partial results achieved.
*The ''Workspace'', a model of short-term memory. Here partial structures are constructed and dismantled. The temporary results may cause the activation of concepts in the slipnet. A ''temperature'' measures the satisfaction of the program with the structure obtained at each moment. High temperature means dissatisfaction and leads to the adoption of a different strategy. Low temperature means satisfaction and the continuation of the present strategy.
*The ''Coderack'', a collection of ''codelets'', that is small fragments of code, that wait to be selected and executed in the workspace. Each has a weight associated to it that determined its probability to be selected for execution.
The resulting software displays emergent properties.
It works according to a ''[[parallel terraced scan]]'' that runs several possible processes at the same time.
It shows mental fluidity in that concepts may ''slip'' into similar ones.
It emulates human behavior in tending to find the most obvious solutions most of the time but being more satisfied (as witnessed by low temperature) by more clever and deep answers that it finds more rarely.

===Chapter 6:Perspectives on Copycat===
This chapter compares Copycat with other recent (at the time) work in [[artificial intelligence]].
Specifically, it matches it with the claimed results from the [[structure mapping engine]] SME and the [[Analogical Constraint Mapping Engine]] (ACME).
The authors' judgment is that those programs suffer from two defects: Their input is pre-structured by the developers to highlight the analogies that the software is supposed to find; and the general architecture of the programs is serial and deterministic rather than parallel and stochastic like Copycat's, which they consider psychologically more plausible.

Severe criticism is put on the claim that these tools can solve "real-life" problems.
In fact, only the terms used in the example suggest that the input to the programs comes from a concrete situation.
The logical structures don't actually imply any meaning for the term.

Finally a more positive assessment is given to two other projects: Indurkhya' PAN model and Kokinov's AMBR system.

===Chapter 7:Prolegomena to Any Future Metacat===
This chapter looks at those aspects of human creativity that are not yet modeled by Copycat and lays down a research plan for a future extension of the software.
The main missing element is the mind's ability to observe itself and reflect on its own thinking process.
Also important is the ability to learn and to remember the results of the mental activity.

The creativity displayed in finding analogies should be applicable at ever higher levels: making analogies between analogies (expression inspired by the title of a book by [[Stanislaw Ulam]]), analogies between these second-order analogies, and so on.

===Chapter 8:Tabletop, BattleOp, Ob-Platte, Potelbat, Belpatto, Platobet===
Another of Hofstadter's students, Robert French, was assigned the task of applying the architecture of Copycat to a different domain, consisting in analogies between objects lying on a table in a coffeehouse.
The resulting program was named Tabletop.

The authors present a different and vaster domain to justify the relevance of attacking such a trivial-seeming project.
The alternative domain is called Ob-Platte and consists in discovering analogies between geographical locations in different regions or countries.

Once again arguments are offered against a brute-force approach, which would work on the small Tabletop domain but would become unfeasible on the larger Ob-Platte domain.
Instead a parallel non-deterministic architecture is used, similar to the one adopted by the Copycat project.

===Chapter 9:The Emergent Personality of Tabletop, a Perception-based Model of Analogy-making===
In the premise to the chapter, title ''The Knotty Problem of Evaluating Research'', Hofstadter considers the question of how research in AI should be assessed.
He argues against a strict adherence to a match between the results of an AI program with the average answer of human test subjects.
He gives two reasons for his rejection: the AI program is supposed to emulate creativity, while an average of human responses will delete any original insight by any of the single subjects; and the architecture of the program should be more important that its mere functional description.

In the main article, the architecture of Tabletop is described: it is strongly inspired by that of Copycat and consists of a Slipnet, a Workspace, and a Corerack.

===Chapter 10:Letter Spirit===
This last chapter is about a more ambitious project that Hofstadter started with student Gary McGraw.
The microdomain used is that of grid fonts: typographic alphabets constructed using a rigid system of small rigid components.
The goal is to construct a program that, given only a few or just one letter from the grid font, can generate the whole alphabet ''in the same style''.
The difficulty lies in the ambiguity and undefinability of ''style''.
The projected program would have a structure very similar to that of Jumble, Numble, Copycat, and Tabletop.

===Epilogue===
In the concluding part of the book, Hofstadter analyses some AI projects with a critical eye.
He finds that today's AI is missing the gist of human creativity and is making exaggerated claims.
The project under scrutiny are the following.

[[AARON]], a computer artist that can draw images of people in outdoor settings in a distinctive style reminiscent of that of a human artist; criticism: the program doesn't have any understanding of the objects it draws, it just uses some graphical algorithms with some randomness thrown in to generate different scenes at every run and to give the style a more natural feel.

[[Racter]], a computer author that wrote a book entitled ''The Policeman's Beard Is Half Constructed''.
Although some of the prose generated by the program is quite impressive, due in part to the [[Eliza effect]], the computer does not have any notion of plot or of the meaning of the words it uses. Furthermore, the book is made up of selected texts from thousands produced by the computer over several years.

[[Automated Mathematician|AM]], a computer mathematician that generates new mathematical concepts. It managed to produce by itself the notion of [[prime number]] and the [[Goldbach conjecture]]. As with Racter, the question is how much the programmer filtered the output of the program, keeping only the occasional interesting output.
Also, mathematics being a very specialized domain, it is doubtful whether the techniques used can be abstracted to general cognition.

Another mathematical program, called Geometry, was celebrated for making an insightful discovery of an original proof that an isosceles triangle has equal base angles. The proof is based on seeing the triangle in two different ways. However, the program generates all possible ways of seeing the triangle, not even knowing that it is the same triangle.

Hofstadter concludes with some methodological remarks on the [[Turing Test]].
In his opinion it is still a good definition and he argues that by interacting with a program, a human may be able to have insight not just on its behaviour but also on its structure.
However, he criticises the use that is made of it at present: it encourages the development of fancy{{Peacock term|date=December 2015}} natural-language interfaces instead of the investigation of deep cognitive faculties.

In scholastic [[metaphysics]], a '''formal distinction''' is a distinction intermediate between what is merely conceptual, and what is fully real or mind-independent.  It was made by some realist philosophers of the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] period in the thirteenth century, and particularly by [[Duns Scotus]].

== Background ==

Many realist philosophers of the period (such as [[Aquinas]] and [[Henry of Ghent]]), recognised the need for an intermediate distinction that was not merely conceptual, but not fully real or mind-independent either.  Aquinas held that the difference between our concepts arises not just in the mind, but has a foundation in the thing (''fundamentum in re'').  Henry held that there was an 'intentional' distinction (''distinctio intentionalis'') such that 'intentions' (i.e. concepts) that are distinct in the mind, correspond to things which are potentially distinct in reality.

Scotus argued for a formal distinction (''distinctio formalis a parte rei''), which holds between entities which are inseparable and indistinct in reality, but whose definitions are not identical.  For example, the personal properties of the [[Trinity]] are formally distinct from the Divine essence.  Similarly, the distinction between the 'thisness' or ''haecceity'' of a thing and its existence is intermediate between a real and a conceptual distinction.&lt;ref&gt;Honderich p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also a formal distinction between the divine attributes and the powers of the soul.

[[William of Ockham|Ockham]] was opposed to the idea, arguing that whenever there is any distinction or non-identity in reality, then two contradictory statements can be made.  But  contradictory statements cannot be truly asserted unless the realities they stand for are either (1) distinct real things (2) distinct concepts or (3) a thing and a concept.  But if they all exist in reality, they are not distinct concepts, nor are they a real thing and a concept.  Therefore, they are distinct in reality.&lt;ref&gt;Ockham, ''Ordinatio'' I. i. q1.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''philosophical interpretation''' is the assignment of meanings to various concepts, symbols, or [[wikt:object|objects]] under consideration. Two broad types of interpretation can be distinguished: interpretations of physical objects, and interpretations of concepts ([[Conceptual model]]).

== Conceptual interpretations ==

=== Aesthetic interpretation ===
{{Main|Aesthetic interpretation}}

Interpretation is related to perceiving the things. An [[aesthetic]] interpretation is an explanation of the [[meaning (non-linguistic)|meaning]] of some work of art. An aesthetic interpretation expresses an understanding of a work of art, a poem, performance, or piece of literature. There may be different interpretations to same work by art by different people owing to their different perceptions or aims. All such interpretations are termed as 'aesthetic interpretations'. Some people, instead of interpreting work of art, believe in interpreting artist himself. It pretty much means "how or what do I believe about (subject)"&lt;ref&gt;http://classof1.com/homework_answers/philosophy/aesthetics_interpretation/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Judicial interpretation ===

A judicial interpretation is a conceptual interpretation that explains how the judiciary should interpret the law, particularly [[constitution]]al documents and [[legislation]] (see [[statutory interpretation]]).

=== Logical interpretation ===
{{Main|Logical interpretation}}

In [[logic]], an interpretation is an assignment of meaning to the [[Symbol (formal)|symbols]] of a language. The [[formal languages]] used in mathematics, logic, and theoretical computer science are defined in solely syntactic terms, and as such do not have any meaning until they are given some interpretation. The general study of interpretations of formal languages is called ''formal semantics''.

=== Religious interpretation ===
{{Main|Religious interpretation}}

Religious interpretation and similarly religious self-interpretation define a section of religion-related studies (theology, comparative religion, reason) where attention is given to aspects of perception—where religious symbolism and the self-image of all those who hold religious views have important bearing on how others perceive their particular belief system and its adherents.

== Scientific interpretation ==
{{Main|Scientific theory}}

=== Descriptive interpretation ===
{{Main|Descriptive interpretation}}

An interpretation is a ''descriptive interpretation'' (also called a ''factual interpretation'') if at least one of the undefined symbols of its formal system becomes, in the interpretation, the name of a physical object, or observable property. A descriptive interpretation is a type of interpretation used in science and logic to talk about empirical entities.

=== Scientific model ===
{{Main|Scientific modeling}}

When scientists attempt to formalize the principles of the empirical sciences, they use an interpretation to [[Scientific model|model reality]], in the same way logicians axiomatize the principles of logic. The aim of these attempts is to construct a formal system that will serve as a conceptual model of reality. Predictions or other statements drawn from such a formal system mirror or map the real world only insofar as these scientific models are true.

[[Image:RudolfvonIhering2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Rudolf von Ihering, one of the juris philosophers of the jurisprudence of concepts]]
The '''jurisprudence of concepts''' was the first ''sub-school'' of [[legal positivism]],&lt;ref name="ARCOS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcos.org.br/livros/hermeneutica-juridica/capitulo-iii-o-positivismo-normativista/3-a-jurisprudencia-dos-conceitos/|title=A Jurisprudência dos Conceitos|author=Costa, Alexandre Araújo|publisher=Arcos|accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FDV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fdv.br/publicacoes/periodicos/revistadepoimentos/n7/6.pdf|title=A importância da Jurisprudência dos Conceitos para a Metodologia Jurídica|author=Pepino, Elsa Maria Lopes Ferreira; Graviorno, Gracimeri, Vieira Soeiro de Castro; Filgueira, Sofia Varejão|publisher=Revista Depoimentos, da Faculdade de Direito de Vitória|accessdate=17 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119225127/http://www.fdv.br/publicacoes/periodicos/revistadepoimentos/n7/6.pdf|archivedate=19 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to which, the written [[law]] must reflect [[concept]]s, when [[interpretation (philosophy)|interpreted]].&lt;ref&gt;that means that the interpretation of the words stated in the law must be guided by the scientific concepts that these words represent.&lt;/ref&gt; Its main representatives were [[Rudolf von Ihering|Ihering]], [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny|Savigny]] and [[Georg Friedrich Puchta|Puchta]].

This school was, thus, the preceding trigger of the idea that law comes from a dogmatic source, imposition from man over man and not a ''natural'' consequence of other sciences or of metaphysical faith.

Among the main characters of the ''jurisprudence of concepts'' are:
* formalism, search of rights in written law
* systemisation
* search for justifying specific norm with basis from more generic ones.&lt;ref name="RSA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seer.ucp.br/seer/index.php/LexHumana/article/download/5/4|title=Evolução Histórica da Teoria Hermenêutica - do Formalismo do Século XVIII ao Pós-Positivismo|author=Rocha, Sérgio André|year=2009|accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So, according to this school, law should have prevailing sources based upon the legislative process, although needing to be proven by more inclusive ideas of a social sense.

A '''league system''' is a [[hierarchy]] of [[sports league|leagues]] in a sport. They are often called '''pyramids''', due to their tendency to split into an increasing number of regional divisions further down the system. League systems of some sort are used in many sports in many countries.

In [[association football]], [[rugby union]] and [[rugby league]], league systems are usually connected by the process of [[promotion and relegation]], in which teams from a lower division who finish at the top of the standings in their league are promoted (advanced to the next level of the system) while teams who finish lowest in their division are relegated (move down to a lower division). This process can be automatic each year, or can require playoffs.

In North America, league systems in the most popular sports do not use promotion or relegation. Most [[professional sports]] are divided into [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major]] and [[minor league]]s. [[Baseball]] and association football (known as soccer in North America) have well-defined pyramid shapes to their minor league hierarchies, each managed by a governing body ([[Minor League Baseball]], an organization under the authority of the [[Commissioner of Baseball]], governs baseball leagues; the [[United States Soccer Federation]] designates the American soccer pyramid.) [[Ice hockey]]'s professional minor league system is linear, with one league at most of the four levels of the game; the ice hockey league system in North America is governed by [[collective bargaining agreement]]s and affiliation deals between the [[National Hockey League|NHL]], [[American Hockey League|AHL]] and [[ECHL]].

[[Gridiron football]] does not operate on a league system. Different professional leagues play by [[List of gridiron football rules|very different sets of rules]] in different seasons (the [[National Football League|NFL]] plays 11-a-side on a 100-yard field in autumn and early winter, the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] uses 12-a-side on a 110-yard field in summer and early fall, while [[arena football]] and the [[indoor American football|minor indoor leagues]] each play 8-a-side on a 50-yard field in the spring and early summer). There have been attempts at forming true minor leagues for the professional game (most recently with 2017's [[The Spring League]]); none so far have been able to balance the major leagues' requests with the ability to maintain financial solvency.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3883">'''Lexical entrainment''' is the phenomenon in conversational [[linguistics]] of the process of the subject adopting the reference terms of their interlocutor. In practice, it acts as a mechanism of the [[cooperative principle]] in which both parties to the conversation employ lexical entrainment as a progressive system to develop "conceptual pacts"&lt;ref name=sbrennan96&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brennan|first=Susan|title=Lexical entrainment in spontaneous dialog|journal=Proceedings, 1996 International Symposium on Spoken Dialogue|year=1996|issue=ISSD-96|pages=41–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a working temporary conversational terminology) to ensure maximum clarity of reference in the communication between the parties; this process is necessary to overcome the ambiguity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deutsch|first=Werner|author2=Pechmann, Thomas |title=Social interaction and the development of definite descriptions|journal=Cognition|year=1982|volume=11|pages=159–184|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(82)90024-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  inherent in the multitude of synonyms that exist in language. 

Lexical entrainment arises by two cooperative mechanisms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garrod|first=Simon|author2=Anderson, Anthony |title=Saying what you mean in dialogue: A study in conceptual and semantic co-ordination|journal=Cognition|year=1987|volume=27|pages=181–218|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(87)90018-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Embedded corrections – a reference to the object implied by the context of the sentence, but with no explicit reference to the change in terminology
* Exposed corrections – an explicit reference to the change in terminology, possibly including a request to assign the referent a common term (e.g., "by 'girl', do you mean 'Jane'?")

==Violation of Grice's maxim of quantity==
Once lexical entrainment has come to determine the phrasing for a referent, both parties will use that terminology for the referent for the duration, even if it proceeds to violate the [[Gricean maxim]] of quantity. For example, if one wants to refer to a brown loafer out of a set of shoes that consist of: the loafer, a sneaker, and a high-heeled shoe, they will not use ''the shoe'' to describe the object as this phrasing does not unambiguously describe one item in the set under consideration. They will also not call the object ''the brown loafer'' which would violate Grice's maxim of quantity. The speaker will settle on using the term ''the loafer'' as it is just informative enough without giving too much information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brennan|first=Susan|author2=Clark, Herbert H. |title=Conceptual Pacts and Lexical Choice in Conversation|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=1996|volume=22|issue=6|pages=1482–1493|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.22.6.1482}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another important factor is lexical availability; the ease of conceptualizing a referent in a certain way and then retrieving and producing a label for it. For many objects the most available labels are basic nouns; for example, the word "dog". Instead of saying ''animal'' or ''husky'' for the referent, most subjects will default to ''dog''.
If in a set of objects one is to refer to either a husky, a table, and a poster, people are still most likely to use the word "dog." This is technically a violation of Grice's maxim of quantity, as using the term ''animal'' is ideal.

==Applications==
Lexical entrainment has applications in [[natural language processing]] in computers as well as human–human interaction. Currently, the adaptability of computers to modify their referencing to the terms of their human interlocutor is limited, so the entrainment adaptation falls to the human operator; this phenomenon is readily demonstrated in Brennan's 1996 experiment.&lt;ref name=sbrennan96 /&gt;

'''Logic models''' are hypothesized descriptions of the chain of causes and effects (see [[Causality]]) leading to an outcome of interest (e.g. prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, annual traffic collision, etc). While they can be in a narrative form, logic model usually take form in a graphical depiction of the "if-then" (causal) relationships between the various elements leading to the outcome. However, the logic model is more than the graphical depiction: it is also the theories, scientific evidences, assumptions and beliefs that support it and the various processes behind it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Renger R |date=2002|title=A Three-Step Approach to Teaching Logic Models |journal=The American Journal of Evaluation |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=493–503 |doi=10.1016/s1098-2140(02)00230-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Frechtling_2015"&gt;{{cite book |last=Frechtling|first=Joy A. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Logic Models|date=2015 |work=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences|pages=299–305|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/b978-0-08-097086-8.10549-5|isbn=978-0-08-097087-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses of the logic model ==

===Program planning===
One of the most important uses of the logic model is for program planning. It is suggested to use the logic model to focus on the intended outcomes of a particular program. The guiding questions change from "what is being done?" to "what needs to be done"? McCawley suggests that by using this new reasoning, a logic model for a program can be built by asking the following questions in sequence:

# What is the current situation that we intend to impact?
# What will it look like when we achieve the desired situation or outcome?
# What behaviors need to change for that outcome to be achieved?
# What knowledge or skills do people need before the behavior will change?
# What activities need to be performed to cause the necessary learning?
# What resources will be required to achieve the desired outcome?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.d.umn.edu/~kgilbert/educ5165-731/Readings/The%20Logic%20Model.pdf|title=The logic model for program planning and evaluation|last=McCawley|first=Paul F. | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=University of Idaho Extension|year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By placing the focus on ultimate outcomes or results, planners can ''think backward'' through the logic model to identify how best to achieve the desired results. Here it helps managers to 'plan with the end in mind', rather than just consider inputs (e.g. budgets, employees) or the tasks that must be done.

===Evaluation===
The logic model is often used in [[government]] or not-for-profit organizations, where the mission and vision are not aimed at achieving a financial benefit. Traditionally, government programs were described only in terms of their [[budget]]s.  It is easy to measure the amount of money spent on a program, but this is a poor indicator of outcomes. Likewise it is relatively easy to measure the amount of work done (e.g. number of workers or number of years spent), but the workers may have just been 'spinning their wheels' without getting very far in terms of ultimate results or outcomes.

However, nature of outcomes varies. To measure the progress toward outcomes, some initiatives may require an ad hoc measurement instrument. In addition, in programs such as in [[education]] or [[social program]]s, outcomes are usually in the long-term and may requires numerous intermediate changes (attitudes, social norm, industry practices, etc.) to advance progressively toward the outcomes.

By making clear the intended outcomes and the causal pathways leading to them, a program logic model provides the basis upon which planners and evaluators can develop a measurement plan and adequate instruments. Instead of only looking at the outcome progress, planners can open the "black box" and examine if the intermediate outcomes progress as planned. In addition, the pathways of numerous outcomes are still largely misunderstood due their complexity, their unpredictability and lack of scientific / practical evidences. Therefore, with proper research design, one may not only assess the progress of intermediate outcomes, but evaluate as well if the program theory of change is accurate, i.e. is successful change of an intermediate outcomes provokes the hypothesized subsequent effects in the causal pathway. Finally, outcomes may easily be achieved through processes independent of the program and an evaluation of those outcomes would suggest program success when in fact external outputs were responsible for the outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first1 = Peter H | last1 = Rossi | first2 = Mark W | last2 = Lipsey | first3 = Howard E | last3 = Freeman | name-list-format = vanc |title=Evaluation : a systematic approach |date=2004|publisher=Sage |isbn=978-0-7619-0894-4|edition=7th |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |oclc=52706526 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Various types of logic models ==

=== The Inputs --&gt; Activities --&gt; Outputs --&gt; Outcomes template ===
Many authors and guides use the following template when speaking about logic model:&lt;ref name="Frechtling_2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LM_EE" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=McLaughlin |first=John A. |last2=Jordan |first2=Gretchen | name-list-format = vanc |title=Using Logic Models |date=2015-10-14 |work=Handbook of Practical Program Evaluation |pages=62–87 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |doi=10.1002/9781119171386.ch3 |isbn=978-1-119-17138-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

Many refinements and variations{{Which|date=October 2018}} have been added to the basic template. For example, many versions of logic models set out a series of outcomes/impacts, explaining in more detail the logic of how an intervention contributes to intended or observed results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Weiss CH | date = 1972 | title = Evaluation Research.

Bartholomew et al. [[Intervention mapping|Intervention Mapping]] approach&lt;ref name="Eldredge_2016" /&gt; makes an extensive use of logic model through the whole life-cycle of a health promotion program. Since this method can start from as far as a vague desired outcomes (authors example is a city whose actors decide to address "health issues" of the city), planners goes through various steps in order to develop effective interventions and properly evaluate them (see [[Intervention Mapping]] entry for a more detailed account). Distinguishable but closely interweave logic models with different purposes are being developed through the process:

* '''Logic model of the problem''', which is a graphical depiction of at-risk population and its social environment behaviours (factors) leading to the health problem and their respective causal pathways (attitudes, beliefs, skills, etc.). This may include as well at-risk population physical environment related causes such as polluants or lack of physical activity infrastructure and their respective causes, i.e. environmental agents behaviours leading to the physical environment causes and their respective causal pathways;
* Once the most relevant behaviours and causal pathways are identified, planners develop a '''logic model of change'''. This is a model of behavioural changes (performance objective) that should happen and their corresponding necessary changes higher in the cause-effects chain.
* Finally, a '''logic model of the intervention''' is developed. This model describe the various activities that will happen and the cascades of effects they are expected to cause toward the desired outcome.

Evaluators thereafter use the logic model of the intervention to design a proper evaluation plan to assess [[Program evaluation#Assessing implementation|implementation]], [[Program evaluation#Assessing the impact (effectiveness)|impact]] and [[Program evaluation#Assessing efficiency|efficiency]].

==Advantages==
By describing work in this way, managers have an easier way to define the work and measure it.  [[Performance measurement|Performance measures]] can be drawn from any of the steps.  One of the key insights of the logic model is the importance of measuring final outcomes or results, because it is quite possible to waste time and money (inputs), "spin the wheels" on work activities, or produce outputs without achieving desired outcomes.  It is these outcomes (impacts, long-term results) that are the only justification for doing the work in the first place.  For commercial organizations, outcomes relate to [[Profit (accounting)|profit]].  For [[Non-profit organization|not-for-profit]] or [[governmental organization]]s, outcomes relate to successful achievement of mission or program goals.

==Disadvantages==
There are some potential disadvantages of logic models due to tendencies toward oversimplification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The logic model guidebook : better strategies for great results | first1 = Lisa Wyatt | last1 = Knowlton | first2 = Cynthia C | last2 = Phillips | last3 =Phillips | first3 = Cynthia | name-list-format = vanc |date=2013|publisher=SAGE C.|isbn=978-1-4522-1675-1|edition=2nd|location=Los Angeles|oclc=791492618}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include:
#Program logic is no guarantee of actual logic in how the program may work. The world is complex, and some situations cannot be ascertained before they are implemented, so some programs may even progress against the "logic" of the model.
#It is a partial representation of a complex system.
#It is a representation of reality, not reality itself. Programs are not linear
#Normally, it does not include effects besides those initially expected.
#They do not necessarily establish causality. Many factors exert influence upon the effects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21697">In [[theoretical physics]], particularly in [[discussions]] of [[:Category:Theories of gravitation|gravitation theories]],  '''Mach's principle''' (or '''Mach's conjecture'''&lt;ref&gt;Hans Christian Von Bayer, ''The Fermi Solution: Essays on Science'', Courier Dover Publications (2001), {{ISBN|0-486-41707-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VhJr9Qx8ohsC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;dq=mach's+conjecture&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Scny_DNMuM&amp;sig=Wm2-2sWSkBltjREyyxNkh1g-wFI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result page 79].&lt;/ref&gt;) is the name given by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] to an imprecise hypothesis often credited to the [[physicist]] and [[philosopher]] [[Ernst Mach#Philosophy of science|Ernst Mach]]. The idea is that the existence of [[absolute rotation]] (the distinction of local [[inertial frame]]s vs. [[rotating reference frame]]s) is determined by the large-scale distribution of matter, as exemplified by this anecdote:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Gravitation and Cosmology |last=Steven |first=Weinberg |publisher= Wiley |year=1972 |isbn=978-0-471-92567-5 |location=USA |pages= 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
You are standing in a field looking at the stars. Your arms are resting freely at your side, and you see that the distant stars are not moving. Now start spinning. The stars are whirling around you and your arms are pulled away from your body. Why should your arms be pulled away when the stars are whirling? Why should they be dangling freely when the stars don't move?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mach's principle says that this is not a coincidence—that there is a physical law that relates the motion of the distant stars to the local inertial frame. If you see all the stars whirling around you, Mach suggests that there is some physical law which would make it so you would feel a [[centrifugal force]]. There are a number of rival formulations of the principle. It is often stated in vague ways, like "[[mass]] out there influences [[inertia]] here". A very general statement of Mach's principle is "local physical laws are determined by the large-scale structure of the universe".&lt;ref name=Hawking&gt;{{cite book |title=The Large Scale Structure of Space–Time |author1=Stephen W. Hawking  |author2=George Francis Rayner Ellis  |lastauthoramp=yes |isbn=978-0-521-09906-6 |date=1973 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QagG_KI7Ll8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Ellis+inauthor:Hawking#PPA1,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept was a guiding factor in Einstein's development of the [[general theory of relativity]]. Einstein realized that the overall distribution of matter would determine the [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]], which tells you which frame is rotationally stationary. [[Frame-dragging]] and conservation of gravitational [[angular momentum]] makes this into a true statement in the general theory in certain solutions. But because the principle is so vague, many distinct statements can be (and have been) made that would qualify as a '''Mach principle''', and some of these are false. The [[Gödel metric|Gödel rotating universe]] is a solution of the field equations that is designed to disobey Mach's principle in the worst possible way. In this example, the distant stars seem to be revolving faster and faster as one moves further away. This example doesn't completely settle the question, because it has [[closed timelike curve]]s.

== History ==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
The basic idea also appears before Mach's time, in the writings of [[George Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=G. Berkeley | title=The Principles of Human Knowledge | date=1726}} See paragraphs 111–117, 1710.&lt;/ref&gt; The book  ''Absolute or Relative Motion?'' (1896) by [[Benedict Friedländer]] and his brother Immanuel contained ideas similar to Mach's principle.{{page needed|date=January 2015}}

== Einstein's use of the principle ==
There is a fundamental issue in relativity theory. If all motion is relative, how can we measure the inertia of a body? We must measure the inertia with respect to something else. But what if we imagine a particle completely on its own in the universe? We might hope to still have some notion of its state of motion. Mach's principle is sometimes interpreted as the statement that such a particle's state of motion has no meaning in that case.

In Mach's words, the principle is embodied as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Mach, Ernst |title= The Science of Mechanics; a Critical and Historical Account of its Development |location= LaSalle, IL |publisher= Open Court Pub. Co. |date=1960 |lccn= 60010179 }} This is a reprint of the English translation by Thomas H. MCormack (first published in 1906) with a new introduction by [[Karl Menger]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[The] investigator must feel the need of... knowledge of the immediate connections, say, of the masses of the universe.There will hover before him as an ideal insight into the principles of the whole matter, from which accelerated and inertial motions will result in the same way.}}

[[Albert Einstein]] seemed to view Mach's principle as something along the lines of:&lt;ref name=Einstein&gt;A. Einstein, letter to Ernst Mach, Zurich, 25 June 1913, in {{cite book |author1=Misner, Charles |author2=Thorne, Kip S. |author3=Wheeler, John Archibald |last-author-amp=yes |title= Gravitation |location= San Francisco |publisher=[[W. H. Freeman]] |date=1973 |isbn=978-0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...inertia originates in a kind of interaction between bodies...}}

In this sense, at least some of Mach's principles are related to philosophical [[holism]]. Mach's suggestion can be taken as the injunction that gravitation theories should be [[relational theory|relational theories]]. Einstein brought the principle into mainstream physics while working on [[general relativity]]. Indeed, it was Einstein who first coined the phrase ''Mach's principle''. There is much debate as to whether Mach really intended to suggest a new physical law since he never states it explicitly.

The writing in which Einstein found inspiration from Mach was "The Science of Mechanics", where the philosopher criticized [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s idea of [[absolute space]], in particular the argument that Newton gave sustaining the existence of an advantaged reference system: what is commonly called "Newton's [[bucket argument]]".

In his ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', Newton tried to demonstrate that:

{{quote|one can always decide if one is rotating with respect to the absolute space, measuring the apparent forces that arise only when an absolute rotation is performed. If a bucket is filled with water, and made to rotate, initially the water remains still, but then, gradually, the walls of the vessel communicate their motion to the water, making it curve and climb up the borders of the bucket, because of the centrifugal forces produced by the rotation.This [[thought experiment]] demonstrates that the centrifugal forces arise only when the water is in rotation with respect to the absolute space (represented here by the earth's reference frame, or better, the distant stars) instead, when the bucket was rotating with respect to the water no centrifugal forces were produced, this indicating that the latter was still with respect to the absolute space.}}

Mach, in his book, says that:

{{quote|the bucket experiment only demonstrates that when the water is in rotation with respect to the bucket no centrifugal forces are produced, and that we cannot know how the water would behave if in the experiment the bucket's walls were increased in depth and width until they became leagues big. In Mach's idea this concept of absolute motion should be substituted with a total relativism in which every motion, uniform or accelerated, has sense only in reference to other bodies (''i.e.'', one cannot simply say that the water is rotating, but must specify if it's rotating with respect to the vessel or to the earth). In this view, the apparent forces that seem to permit  discrimination between relative and "absolute" motions should only be considered as an effect of the particular asymmetry that there is in our reference system between the bodies which we consider in motion, that are small (like buckets), and the bodies that we believe are still (the earth and distant stars), that are overwhelmingly bigger and heavier than the former.}}

This same thought had been expressed by the philosopher [[George Berkeley]] in his ''[[De Motu (Berkeley's essay)|De Motu]]''. It is then not clear, in the passages from Mach just mentioned, if the philosopher intended to formulate a new kind of physical action between heavy bodies. This physical mechanism should determine the inertia of bodies, in a way that the heavy and distant bodies of our universe should contribute the most to the inertial forces. More likely, Mach only suggested a mere "redescription of motion in space as experiences that do not invoke the term ''space''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Barbour, Julian; and Pfister, Herbert (eds.) | title= Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity |location=Boston |publisher=[[Birkhäuser]] |date=1995 |isbn= 978-3-7643-3823-7}}  (Einstein studies, vol. 6)&lt;/ref&gt;  What is certain is that Einstein interpreted Mach's passage in the former way, originating a long-lasting debate.

Most physicists believe Mach's principle was never developed into a quantitative physical theory that would explain a mechanism by which the stars can have such an effect. It was never made clear by Mach himself exactly what his principle was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Barbour, Julian; and Pfister, Herbert (eds.) |title= Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity |place=Boston |publisher= Birkhäuser |date=1995 |isbn= 978-3-7643-3823-7|pages=9–57}} (Einstein studies, vol. 6)&lt;/ref&gt; Although Einstein was intrigued and inspired by Mach's principle, Einstein's formulation of the principle is not a fundamental assumption of [[general relativity]].

== Mach's principle in general relativity ==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
Because intuitive notions of distance and time no longer apply, what exactly is meant by "Mach's principle" in general relativity is even less clear than in Newtonian physics and at least 21 formulations of Mach's principle are possible, some being considered more strongly Machian than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Barbour, Julian; and Pfister, Herbert (eds.) |title=Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity |location= Boston |publisher=Birkhäuser |date=1995 |isbn= 978-3-7643-3823-7 |pages=530}}  (Einstein studies, vol. 6).&lt;/ref&gt;  A relatively weak formulation is the assertion that the motion of matter in one place should affect which frames are inertial in another.

Einstein, before completing his development of the general theory of relativity, found an effect which he interpreted as being evidence of Mach's principle.  We assume a fixed background for conceptual simplicity, construct a large spherical shell of mass, and set it spinning in that background.  The reference frame in the interior of this shell will [[Precession|precess]] with respect to the fixed background.  This effect is known as the [[Lense–Thirring effect]].  Einstein was so satisfied with this manifestation of Mach's principle that he wrote a letter to Mach expressing this:
{{quote|it... turns out that inertia originates in a kind of interaction between bodies, quite in the sense of your considerations on Newton's pail experiment...  If one rotates [a heavy shell of matter] relative to the fixed stars about an axis going through its center, a [[Coriolis force]] arises in the interior of the shell; that is, the plane of a [[Foucault pendulum]] is dragged around (with a practically unmeasurably small angular velocity).&lt;ref name=Einstein/&gt;}}

The Lense–Thirring effect certainly satisfies the very basic and broad notion that "matter there influences inertia here".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bondi, Hermann |author2= Samuel, Joseph |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Lense–Thirring Effect and Mach's Principle |journal= Physics Letters A |volume=228 |issue=3 |pages=121 |arxiv=gr-qc/9607009 |date= July 4, 1996 |doi= 10.1016/S0375-9601(97)00117-5 |bibcode= 1997PhLA..228..121B }}  A useful review explaining the multiplicity of "Mach principles" which have been invoked in the research literature (and elsewhere).&lt;/ref&gt;  The plane of the pendulum would not be dragged around if the shell of matter were not present, or if it were not spinning.  As for the statement that "inertia originates in a kind of interaction between bodies", this too could be interpreted as true in the context of the effect.

More fundamental to the problem, however, is the very existence of a fixed background, which Einstein describes as "the fixed stars".  Modern relativists see the imprints of Mach's principle in the initial-value problem.  Essentially, we humans seem to wish to separate [[spacetime]] into slices of constant time.  When we do this, [[Einstein's equations]] can be decomposed into one set of equations, which must be satisfied on each slice, and another set, which describe how to move between slices.  The equations for an individual slice are [[elliptic partial differential equation]]s.  In general, this means that only part of the geometry of the slice can be given by the scientist, while the geometry everywhere else will then be dictated by Einstein's equations on the slice.{{clarify|date=June 2017}}

In the context of an [[asymptotically flat spacetime]], the boundary conditions are given at infinity.  Heuristically, the boundary conditions for an asymptotically flat universe define a frame with respect to which inertia has meaning.  By performing a [[Lorentz transformation]] on the distant universe, of course, this inertia can also be transformed.

A stronger form of Mach's principle applies in [[Wheeler–Mach–Einstein spacetime]]s, which require spacetime to be spatially [[Compact space |compact]] and [[Globally hyperbolic manifold|globally hyperbolic]].  In such universes Mach's principle can be stated as ''the distribution of matter and field energy-momentum (and possibly other information) at a particular moment in the universe determines the inertial frame at each point in the universe'' (where "a particular moment in the universe" refers to a chosen [[Cauchy surface]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Barbour, Julian; and Pfister, Herbert (eds.) |title= Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity |location=Boston |publisher= Birkhäuser |date=1995 |isbn= 978-3-7643-3823-7 |pages=188–207}}  (Einstein studies, vol. 6).&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been other attempts to formulate a theory that is more fully Machian, such as the [[Brans–Dicke theory]] and the [[Hoyle–Narlikar theory of gravity]], but most physicists argue that none have been fully successful. At an exit poll of experts, held in Tübingen in 1993, when asked the question "Is general relativity perfectly Machian?", 3 respondents replied "yes", and 22 replied "no".  To the question "Is general relativity with appropriate boundary conditions of closure of some kind very Machian?" the result was 14 "yes" and 7 "no".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Barbour, Julian; and Pfister, Herbert (eds.) |title= Mach's principle: from Newton's bucket to quantum gravity |location=Boston |publisher= Birkhäuser |date=1995 |isbn=978-3-7643-3823-7 |page=106}}  (Einstein studies, vol. 6).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Einstein was convinced that a valid theory of gravity would necessarily have to include the relativity of inertia:
{{quote|text=So strongly did Einstein believe at that time in the relativity of inertia that in 1918 he stated as being on an equal footing three principles on which a satisfactory theory of gravitation should rest:
# The principle of relativity as expressed by general covariance.
# The principle of equivalence.
# Mach's principle (the first time this term entered the literature): … that the ''g&lt;sub&gt;µν&lt;/sub&gt;'' are completely determined by the mass of bodies, more generally by ''T&lt;sub&gt;µν&lt;/sub&gt;''. 
In 1922, Einstein noted that others were satisfied to proceed without this [third] criterion and added, 
"This contentedness will appear incomprehensible to a later generation however."

It must be said that, as far as I can see, to this day, Mach's principle has not brought physics decisively farther. It must also be said that the origin of inertia is and remains the most obscure subject in the theory of particles and fields. Mach's principle may therefore have a future – but not without the quantum theory.

== Variations in the statement of the principle ==
The broad notion that "mass there influences inertia here" has been expressed in several forms.
[[Hermann Bondi]] and Joseph Samuel have listed eleven distinct statements that can be called Mach principles, labelled by ''Mach0'' through ''Mach10''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bondi, Hermann |author2=Samuel, Joseph |title=The Lense–Thirring Effect and Mach's Principle |arxiv=gr-qc/9607009 |date= July 4, 1996 |doi=10.1016/S0375-9601(97)00117-5 |volume=228 |issue=3 |journal=Physics Letters A |pages=121–126 |bibcode= 1997PhLA..228..121B}}  A useful review explaining the multiplicity of "Mach principles", which have been invoked in the research literature (and elsewhere).&lt;/ref&gt;  Though their list is not necessarily exhaustive, it does give a flavor for the variety possible.

* ''Mach0'': The universe, as represented by the average motion of distant galaxies, does not appear to rotate relative to local inertial frames.
* ''Mach1'': Newton’s [[gravitational constant]] ''G'' is a [[dynamical field]].
* ''Mach2'': An isolated body in otherwise empty space has no inertia.
* ''Mach3'': Local inertial frames are affected by the cosmic motion and distribution of matter.
* ''Mach4'': The universe is spatially closed.
* ''Mach5'': The total energy, angular and linear momentum of the universe are zero.
* ''Mach6'': Inertial mass is affected by the global distribution of matter.
* ''Mach7'': If you take away all matter, there is no more space.
* ''Mach8'': &lt;math&gt;\Omega\ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ 4 \pi \rho G T^2&lt;/math&gt; is a definite number, of order unity, where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the mean density of matter in the universe, and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hubble time]].
* ''Mach9'': The theory contains no absolute elements.
* ''Mach10'': Overall rigid rotations and translations of a system are unobservable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3805">In [[economics]], '''marginal concepts''' are associated with a ''specific change'' in the quantity used of a [[Good (economics)|good]] or [[Service (economics)|service]], as opposed to some notion of the over-all significance of that class of good or service, or of some total quantity thereof.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

== Marginality ==

Constraints are conceptualized as a ''border'' or ''margin''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Wicksteed|Wicksteed, Philip Henry]]; ''The Common Sense of Political Economy'' (1910), Bk I Ch 2 and elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt;  The location of the margin for any individual corresponds to his or her ''endowment'', broadly conceived to include opportunities.  This endowment is determined by many things including physical laws (which constrain how forms of energy and matter may be transformed), accidents of nature (which determine the presence of natural resources), and the outcomes of past decisions made both by others and by the individual himself or herself.

A value that holds true given particular constraints is a [[marginal value|''marginal'' value]].  A change that would be affected as or by a specific loosening or tightening of those constraints is a ''marginal'' change, as large as the smallest relevant division of that good or service.&lt;ref name="wieser_ein"&gt;von Wieser, Friedrich; ''Über den Ursprung und die Hauptgesetze des wirtschaftlichen Wertes'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''The Nature and Essence of Theoretical Economics''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (1884), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;  For reasons of tractability, it is often assumed in [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical analysis]] that goods and services are [[Continuum (theory)|continuously divisible]].  In such context, a marginal change may be an [[infinitesimal]] change or a [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]].  However, strictly speaking, the smallest relevant division may be quite large.

== Some important marginal concepts ==

The '''[[marginal use]]''' of a [[Good (economics)|good or service]] is the specific use to which an agent would put a given increase, or the specific use of the good or service that would be abandoned in response to a given decrease.&lt;ref name="wieser_ein" /&gt;

The '''[[marginal utility]]''' of a [[Good (economics)|good or service]] is the [[utility]] of the specific use to which an agent would put a given increase in that good or service, or of the specific use that would be abandoned in response to a given decrease.  In other words, marginal utility is the utility of the  [[marginal use]].

The '''[[marginal rate of substitution]]''' is the rate of substitution is the least favorable rate, at the margin, at which an agent is willing to exchange units of one good or service for units of another.

A '''[[marginal benefit]]''' is a benefit (howsoever ranked or measured) associated with a marginal change.

The term “'''[[marginal cost]]'''” may refer to an [[opportunity cost]] at the margin, or to marginal ''[[Money|pecuniary]]'' cost — that is to say marginal cost measured by forgone money.

Other marginal concepts include (but are not limited to):
* [[marginal product|marginal physical product]] (sometimes also known as “marginal product”)
* [[marginal rate of transformation]], the rate at which one output or result must be sacrificed in order to increase another output or result
* [[marginal revenue product]]
* [[marginal propensity to save]] and [[marginal propensity to consume|consume]]
* [[marginal tax rate]]

'''[[Marginalism]]''' is the use of marginal concepts to explain economic phenomena.

The related concept of [[elasticity (economics)|elasticity]] is the ratio of the incremental percentage change in one variable with respect to an incremental percentage change in another variable.

The '''marginal propensity to import''' ('''MPI''') is the fractional change in [[imports|import]] expenditure that occurs with a change in [[disposable income]] (income after taxes and transfers).  For example, if a household earns one extra dollar of disposable income, and the marginal propensity to import is 0.2, then the household will spend 20 cents of that dollar on imported goods and services.

Mathematically, the marginal propensity to import (MPM) function is expressed as the [[derivative]] of the import (I) function with respect to disposable income (Y).&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{MPM}=\frac{\text{d}I}{\text{d}Y}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In other words, the marginal propensity to import is measured as the ratio of the change in imports to the change in income, thus giving us a figure between 0 and 1.  

Imports are also considered to be [[automatic stabiliser]]s that work to lessen fluctuations in [[real GDP]].

The UK government assumes that UK citizens have a high marginal propensity to import and thus will use a decrease in disposable income as a tool to control the current account on the balance of payments.

In [[microeconomics]], '''marginal revenue''' (R') is the additional revenue that will be generated by increasing product sales by one unit.&lt;ref name="Essentials"&gt;Bradley R. chiller, "Essentials of Economics", New York: McGraw-Hill, Inc., 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MicroTheory"&gt;Edwin Mansfield, "Micro-Economics Theory and Applications, 3rd Edition", New York and London:W.W. Norton and Company, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro"&gt;Roger LeRoy Miller, "Intermediate Microeconomics  Theory Issues Applications, Third Edition", New York: McGraw-Hill, Inc, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IndustrialOrg"&gt;Tirole, Jean,  "The Theory of Industrial Organization", Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EconDictionary"&gt;John Black, "Oxford Dictionary of Economics", New York: Oxford University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  It can also be described as the [[total revenue|unit revenue]] the last item sold has generated for the firm.&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EconDictionary" /&gt;  In a [[perfect competition|perfectly competitive]] market, the additional revenue generated by selling an additional unit of a good is equal to the price the firm is able to charge the buyer of the good.&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Sullivan &amp; Sheffrin (2003), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is because a firm in a [[perfect competition|competitive market]] will always get the same price for every unit it sells regardless of the number of units the firm sells since the firm's sales can never impact the industry's price.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt; However, a [[monopoly]] determines the entire [[industry]]'s sales.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;  As a result, it will have to lower the price of all units sold to increase sales by 1 unit.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt;  Therefore, the marginal revenue generated is always lower than the price the firm is able to charge for the unit sold, since each reduction in price causes unit revenue to decline on every good the firm sells.&lt;ref name="Essentials" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IntermediateMicro" /&gt;  The marginal revenue (the increase in [[total revenue]]) is the price the firm gets on the additional unit sold, less the revenue lost by reducing the price on all other units that were sold prior to the decrease in price. 

A firms profits will be maximized when marginal revenue (MR) equals [[Marginal cost|marginal cost (MC)]]. If &lt;math&gt;MR &gt; MC&lt;/math&gt; then a firm should increase output for more profits, if &lt;math&gt;MR &lt; MC&lt;/math&gt; then a firm should decrease output for additional profits. A firm should choose the output level which is profit maximizing under perfect competition theory &lt;math&gt;MR = MC&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/432989728|title=Managerial economics : a strategic approach|last=David.|first=Prentice,|last2=1962-|first2=Waschik, Robert G.,|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9780415495172|location=|pages=33|oclc=432989728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Marginal revenue is equal to the ratio of the change in revenue for some change in quantity sold to that change in quantity sold. This can also be represented as a derivative when the change in quantity sold becomes arbitrarily small.  More formally, define the revenue function to be the following
:&lt;math&gt;R(q)=P(q)\cdot q &lt;/math&gt;.

By the [[product rule]], marginal revenue is then given by
:&lt;math&gt;R'(q)=P(q) + P'(q)\cdot q&lt;/math&gt;.

For a firm facing perfect competition, price does not change with quantity sold (&lt;math&gt;P'(q)=0&lt;/math&gt;), so marginal revenue is equal to price. For a [[monopoly]], the price decreases with quantity sold (&lt;math&gt;P'(q)&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;), so marginal revenue is less than price (for positive &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;).

==Marginal revenue curve==

The marginal revenue curve is affected by the same factors as the demand curve - changes in income, change in the prices of complements and substitutes, change in populations. These factors can cause the R curve to shift and rotate.&lt;ref&gt;Landsburg, S Price 2002. p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship between marginal revenue and elasticity==
The relationship between marginal revenue and the [[price elasticity of demand|elasticity of demand]] by the firm's customers can be derived as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Perloff (2008) p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; R' = \frac{dR}{dQ} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R' = \langle R \rangle + \left( \frac{d \langle R \rangle}{dQ} \right) Q &lt;/math&gt;
:as &lt;math&gt; \langle R \rangle = P &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R' = \langle R \rangle \left[ 1 + \frac{d \langle R \rangle}{dQ} \frac{Q}{\langle R \rangle} \right] &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R' = \langle R \rangle (1 + 1 / e_{\langle R \rangle})&lt;/math&gt;

where e is the [[price elasticity of demand]]. If demand is inelastic (e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1) then R' will be negative, because to sell a marginal (infinitesimal) unit the firm would have to lower the selling price so much that it would lose more revenue on the pre-existing units than it would gain on the incremental unit. If demand is elastic (e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 1) R' will be positive, because the additional unit would not drive down the price by so much. If the firm is a perfect competitor, so that it is so small in the market that its quantity produced and sold has no effect on the price, then the price elasticity of demand is negative infinity, and marginal revenue simply equals the (market-determined) price.

==Marginal revenue and rule-of-thumb pricing==
Profit maximization requires that a firm produces where marginal revenue equals marginal costs. Firm managers are unlikely to have complete information concerning their marginal revenue function or their marginal costs. Fortunately, the profit maximization conditions can be expressed in a “more easily applicable form” or rule of thumb.

:R' = C' 
:R' = &lt;R&gt;(1 + 1/e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;)
:MC = &lt;R&gt;(1 + 1/e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;)
:MC = &lt;R&gt; + &lt;R&gt;/e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;
:(&lt;R&gt; - C')/ &lt;R&gt; = - 1/e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="Pindyck, R 2001 p. 334"&gt;Pindyck, R &amp; Rubinfeld, D (2001) p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

Markup is the difference between price and marginal cost. The formula states that markup as a percentage of price equals the negative of the inverse of elasticity of demand.&lt;ref name="Pindyck, R 2001 p. 334"/&gt; Alternatively, the relationship can be expressed as:
:&lt;R&gt; = C'/(1 + 1/e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;)

Thus if e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is - 2 and mc is $5.00 then price is $10.00.

(&lt;R&gt; - C')/ &lt;R&gt; = - 1/e&lt;sub&gt;&lt;R&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is called the Lerner index after economist Abba Lerner.&lt;ref name="Perloff"&gt;Perloff (2008) p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lerner index is a measure of market power - the ability of a firm to charge a price that exceeds marginal cost.  The index varies from zero to 1. The greater the difference between price and marginal cost the closer the index value is to 1. The Lerner index increases as demand becomes less elastic.&lt;ref name="Perloff"/&gt;

'''Example'''
If a company can sell 10 units at $20 each or 11 units at $19 each, then the marginal revenue from the eleventh unit is (11 × 19) - (10 × 20) = $9.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3856">A '''marginal value''' is
#a [[Value (mathematics)|value]] that holds true given particular constraints,
#the ''change'' in a value associated with a specific change in some [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variable]], whether it be of that variable or of a [[Dependent and independent variables|dependent variable]], or
#[when underlying values are quantified] the ''[[ratio]]'' of the change of a dependent variable to that of the independent variable.
(This third case is actually a special case of the second).

In the case of [[Differentiability#Continuity and differentiability|differentiability]], at the limit, a marginal change is a [[Differential (infinitesimal)|mathematical differential]], or the corresponding [[Derivative (calculus)|mathematical derivative]].

These uses of the term “marginal” are especially common in [[economics]], and result from conceptualizing constraints as ''borders'' or as ''margins''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Wicksteed|Wicksteed, Philip Henry]]; ''The Common Sense of Political Economy'' (1910),] Bk I Ch 2 and elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt;  The sorts of marginal values most common to economic analysis are those associated with ''unit'' changes of resources and, in [[mainstream economics]], those associated with ''infinitesimal'' changes.  Marginal values associated with units are considered because many decisions are made by unit, and [[marginalism]] explains ''unit price'' in terms of such marginal values.  Mainstream economics uses infinitesimal values in much of its analysis for reasons of mathematical tractability.

== Quantified conception ==

Assume a functional relationship
:&lt;math&gt;y=f\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\ldots,x_n \right)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Discrete change ===
If the value of &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is ''discretely'' changed from &lt;math&gt;x_{i,0}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x_{i,1}&lt;/math&gt; while other independent variables remain unchanged, then the marginal value of the change in &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta x_i =x_{i,1}-x_{i,0}&lt;/math&gt;
and the “marginal value” of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; may refer to
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta y=f\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\ldots ,x_{i,1},\ldots,x_n \right)-f\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\ldots ,x_{i,0},\ldots,x_n \right)&lt;/math&gt;
or to
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{f\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\ldots ,x_{i,1},\ldots,x_n \right)-f\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\ldots ,x_{i,0},\ldots,x_n \right)}{x_{i,1}-x_{i,0}}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Example ====
If an individual saw her income increase from $50000 to $55000 per annum, and part of her response was to increase yearly purchases of [[amontillado]] from 2 casks to three casks, then
*the marginal increase in her income was $5000
*the marginal effect on her purchase of amontillado was an increase of 1 cask, or of 1 cask per $5000.

=== Infinitesimal margins ===
If ''infinitesimal'' values are considered, then a marginal value of &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; would be &lt;math&gt;dx_i&lt;/math&gt;, and the “marginal value” of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; would typically refer to
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial y}{\partial x_i}=\frac{\partial f\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\ldots,x_n \right)}{\partial x_i}&lt;/math&gt;

(For a linear functional relationship &lt;math&gt;y = a + b\cdot x&lt;/math&gt;, the marginal value of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; will simply be the co-efficient of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; (in this case, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;) and this will not change as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; changes. However, in the case where the functional relationship is non-linear, say &lt;math&gt;y = a\cdot b^x&lt;/math&gt;, the marginal value of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; will be different for different values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.)

==== Example ====
Assume that, in some economy, aggregate consumption is well-approximated by
:&lt;math&gt;C=C\left(Y\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where
*&lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is [[Measures of national income and output|aggregate income]].
Then the ''[[marginal propensity to consume]]'' is
:&lt;math&gt;MPC=\frac{dC}{dY}&lt;/math&gt;

The '''mediocrity principle''' is the [[philosophical]] notion that "if an item is drawn at random from one of several sets or categories, it's likelier to come from the most numerous category than from any one of the less numerous categories".&lt;ref name="Kukla2009"&gt;{{cite book |first=A. |last=Kukla |year=2009 |title=Extraterrestrials: A Philosophical Perspective |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=9780739142455 |lccn=2009032272 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZkdqTFVNwmgC&amp;pg=PA20 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle has been taken to suggest that there is nothing very unusual about the [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|evolution of the Solar System]], [[Earth's history]], the [[evolution of biological complexity]], [[human evolution]], or any one [[nation]]. It is a [[heuristic]] in the vein of the [[Copernican principle]], and is sometimes used as a philosophical statement about the place of humanity. The idea is to assume mediocrity, rather than starting with the assumption that a phenomenon is special, privileged, exceptional, or even [[supremacism|superior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1377474/principle-of-mediocrity|title=principle of mediocrity - astrobiology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MediocrePZ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_12.html#myerspz|title=THE WORLD QUESTION CENTER 2011 — Page 12|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extraterrestrial life==
[[File:Grand prismatic spring.jpg|thumb|200px|Life is ubiquitous on Earth, but does it exist elsewhere?]]

The mediocrity principle suggests, given the existence of life on Earth, that [[life]] typically exists on [[Earth analog|Earth-like planet]]s throughout the [[universe]].&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, Eric, and Steve McMillan.

The mediocrity principle is in contrast with the [[anthropic principle]], which asserts that the presence of an intelligent observer (humans) limits the circumstances to bounds under which intelligent life can be [[Observation bias|observed to exist]], no matter [[Rare Earth hypothesis|how improbable]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/cosmo/lectures/lec24.html Anthropic Principle]&lt;/ref&gt; Both stand in contrast to the [[Fine-tuned Universe|fine-tuning hypothesis]], which asserts that the natural conditions for intelligent life are implausibly rare.

The mediocrity principle implies that Earth-like environments are necessarily common, based in part on the evidence of [[Doomsday argument|any happening at all]], whereas the anthropic principle suggests that no assertion can be made about the probability of intelligent life based on a sample set of one ([[Dunning–Kruger effect|self-described]]) example, who are necessarily capable of making such an assertion about themselves.

It is also possible to handle the Mediocrity Principle as a statistical problem, a case of a single [[Data point]] statistics, also present in the [[German tank problem]].

==Other uses==
[[David Deutsch]] argues that the mediocrity principle is incorrect from a physical point of view, in reference to either humanity's part of the universe or to its species. Deutsch refers to [[Stephen Hawking]]'s quote: "The human race is just a chemical scum on a moderate-sized planet, orbiting around a very average star in the outer suburb of one among a hundred billion galaxies". Deutsch wrote that Earth's neighborhood in the universe is not typical (80% of the universe's matter is [[dark matter]]) and that a concentration of mass such as the Solar System is an "isolated, uncommon phenomenon". He also disagrees with [[Richard Dawkins]], who considers that humans, because of natural evolution, are limited to the capabilities of their species. Deutsch responds that even though evolution did not give humans the ability to detect [[neutrino]]s, scientists can currently detect them, which significantly expands their capabilities beyond what is available as a result of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0-14-196969-5 |title=The Beginning of Infinity |author=[[David Deutsch]]|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=August 2015}}

{{InfoMaps}}
A '''mental model''' is an explanation of someone's [[thought]] process about how something works in the real world. It is a representation of the surrounding world, the relationships between its various parts and a person's intuitive perception about his or her own acts and their consequences. Mental models can help shape [[behaviour]] and set an approach to solving problems (similar to a personal [[algorithm]]) and doing tasks.

A mental model is a kind of internal symbol or representation of external reality, hypothesized to play a major role in [[cognition]], [[reasoning]] and [[decision-making]]. [[Kenneth Craik]] suggested in 1943 that the mind constructs "small-scale models" of reality that it uses to anticipate events.

[[Jay Wright Forrester]] defined general mental models as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The image of the world around us, which we carry in our head, is just a model. Nobody in his head imagines all the world, government or country. He has only selected concepts, and relationships between them, and uses those to represent the real system (Forrester, 1971).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In psychology, the term ''mental models'' is sometimes used to refer to [[mental representation]]s or mental simulation generally. At other times it is used to refer to {{§l||Mental models and reasoning}} and to the mental model theory of reasoning developed by [[Philip Johnson-Laird]] and [[Ruth M.J. Byrne]].

==History==
The term ''mental model'' is believed to have originated with [[Kenneth Craik]] in his 1943 book ''The Nature of Explanation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nersessian|first1=Nancy J.|authorlink=Nancy_J._Nersessian|title=In the Theoretician's Laboratory: Thought Experimenting as Mental Modeling|journal=PSA: Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association|date=1992|volume=1992|pages=291–301|url=http://www.cc.gatech.edu/aimosaic/faculty/nersessian/papers/in-the-theoreticians-laboratory.pdf|accessdate=17 July 2014|quote=The contemporary notion that mental modelling plays a significant role in human reasoning was formulated, initially, by Kenneth Craik in 1943.|doi=10.1086/psaprocbienmeetp.1992.2.192843}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Staggers|first1=Nancy|last2=Norcio|first2=A.F.|title=Mental models: concepts for human-computer interaction research|journal=International Journal of Man-Machine Studies|date=1993|volume=38|issue=4|pages=587–605|doi=10.1006/imms.1993.1028|url=http://userpages.umbc.edu/~norcio/papers/1993/Staggers-MM-IJMMS.pdf|quote=Although Johnson-Laird (1989) is generally credited with coining the term mental model, the history of the concept may be traced to Craik's (1943) work entitled ''The Nature of Explanation''.|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[:fr:Georges-Henri Luquet|Georges-Henri Luquet]] in ''Le dessin enfantin'' (Children's drawings), published in 1927 by Alcan, Paris, argued that children construct internal models, a view that influenced, among others, child psychologist [[Jean Piaget]].

[[Philip Johnson-Laird]] published ''Mental Models: Towards a Cognitive Science of Language, Inference and Consciousness'' in 1983. In the same year, [[Dedre Gentner]] and [[Albert Stevens]] edited a collection of chapters in a book also titled ''Mental Models''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lauradove.info/reports/mental%20models.htm "Mental models"], report at www.lauradove.info.&lt;/ref&gt; The first line of their book explains the idea further: "One function of this chapter is to belabor the obvious; people's views of the world, of themselves, of their own capabilities, and of the tasks that they are asked to perform, or topics they are asked to learn, depend heavily on the conceptualizations that they bring to the task." (see the book: ''[[Mental Models (Gentner-Stevens book)|Mental Models]]'').

Since then, there has been much discussion and use of the idea in [[human-computer interaction]] and [[usability]] by researchers including [[Donald Norman]] and Steve Krug (in his book ''[[Don't Make Me Think]]''). [[Walter Kintsch]] and [[Teun A. van Dijk]], using the term ''situation model'' (in their book ''Strategies of Discourse Comprehension'', 1983), showed the relevance of mental models for the production and comprehension of [[discourse]].

==Mental models and reasoning==&lt;!-- [[#Mental models and reasoning]] above links to this heading --&gt;
One view of human reasoning is that it depends on mental models. In this view, mental models can be constructed from perception, imagination, or the comprehension of discourse (Johnson-Laird, 1983). Such mental models are similar to architects' models or to physicists' diagrams in that their structure is analogous to the structure of the situation that they represent, unlike, say, the structure of logical forms used in formal rule theories of reasoning. In this respect, they are a little like pictures in the [[picture theory of language]] described by philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] in 1922. [[Philip Johnson-Laird]] and [[Ruth M.J. Byrne]] developed a theory of mental models which makes the assumption that reasoning depends, not on logical form, but on mental models (Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 1991).

===Principles of mental models===
Mental models are based on a small set of fundamental assumptions ([[axiom]]s), which distinguish them from other proposed representations in the [[psychology of reasoning]] (Byrne and Johnson-Laird, 2009). Each mental model represents a possibility. A mental model represents one possibility, capturing what is common to all the different ways in which the possibility may occur (Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 2002). Mental models are iconic, i.e., each part of a model corresponds to each part of what it represents (Johnson-Laird, 2006). Mental models are based on a principle of truth: they typically represent only those situations that are possible, and each model of a possibility represents only what is true in that possibility according to the proposition. However, mental models can represent what is false, temporarily assumed to be true, for example, in the case of [[counterfactual conditionals]] and [[counterfactual thinking]] (Byrne, 2005).

===Reasoning with mental models===
People infer that a conclusion is valid if it holds in all the possibilities. Procedures for reasoning with mental models rely on counter-examples to refute invalid inferences; they establish validity by ensuring that a conclusion holds over all the models of the premises. Reasoners focus on a subset of the possible models of multiple-model problems, often just a single model. The ease with which reasoners can make deductions is affected by many factors, including age and working memory (Barrouillet, et al., 2000). They reject a conclusion if they find a counterexample, i.e., a possibility in which the premises hold, but the conclusion does not (Schroyens, et al. 2003; Verschueren, et al., 2005).

===Criticisms===
Scientific debate continues about whether human reasoning is based on mental models, versus formal [[rules of inference]] (e.g., O'Brien, 2009), domain-specific rules of inference (e.g., Cheng &amp; Holyoak, 2008; Cosmides, 2005), or probabilities (e.g., Oaksford and Chater, 2007). Many empirical comparisons of the different theories have been carried out (e.g., Oberauer, 2006).

==Mental models of dynamics systems: mental models in system dynamics==

===Characteristics===
A mental model is generally:
* founded on unquantifiable, impugnable, obscure, or incomplete facts
* '''[[Cognitive flexibility|flexible]]''' – is considerably variable in positive as well as in negative sense
* an '''information filter''' – causes [[selective perception]], perception of only selected parts of [[information]]
* '''very limited''', compared with the complexities of the world, and even when a [[scientific modelling|scientific model]] is extensive and in accordance with a certain [[reality]] in the derivation of [[logical consequence]]s of it, it must take into account such restrictions as [[working memory]]; i.e., rules on the maximum number of elements that people are able to remember, [[gestaltism]]s or failure of the principles of [[logic]], etc.
* dependent on sources of information, which one can not find anywhere else, are available at any time and can be used.&lt;ref name="SUSM2004"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://proverbs.cz/media/art/SM_ST.pdf |format=PDF |author=Šusta, Marek |title=Několik slov o systémové dynamice a systémovém myšlení |pages=3–9 |publisher=Proverbs, a.s. |language=Czech |accessdate= 2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mild2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Mildeova, S., Vojtko V. |title=Systémová dynamika |year=2003 |isbn=80-245-0626-2 |publisher=Oeconomica |location=Prague |pages=19–24 |language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="forste1997"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/jsterman/www/ford_sterman_elicit_1.pdf |format=PDF |author=Ford, David N., Sterman, John D. |title=Expert Knowledge Elicitation to Improve Mental and Formal Models |publisher=Cambridge, Massachusetts, US - Massachusetts Institute of Technology |pages=18–23 |accessdate=2009-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental models are a fundamental way to understand organizational learning. Mental models, in popular science parlance, have been described as "deeply held images of thinking and acting".&lt;ref&gt;"Leading for a Change", Ralph Jacobson, 2000, Chapter 5, Page102&lt;/ref&gt; Mental models are so basic to understanding the world that people are hardly conscious of them.

===Expression of mental models of dynamic systems===
S.N. Groesser and M. Schaffernicht (2012) describe three basic methods which are typically used:
* [[Causal loop diagram]]s – displaying tendency and a direction of information connections and the resulting causality and feedback loops
* System structure diagrams – another way to express the structure of a qualitative dynamic system
* Stock and flow diagrams - a way to quantify the structure of a dynamic system
These methods allow showing a mental model of a dynamic system, as an explicit, written model about a certain system based on internal beliefs. Analyzing these graphical representations has been an increasing area of research across many social science fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Natalie A. |last2=Ross |first2=Helen |last3=Lynam |first3=Timothy |last4=Perez |first4=Pascal |last5=Leitch |first5=Anne |title=Mental Models:  An Interdisciplinary Synthesis of Theory and Methods |journal=Ecology and Society |date=2011 |volume=16 |issue=1 |doi=10.5751/ES-03802-160146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally software tools that attempt to capture and analyze the structural and functional properties of individual mental models such as Mental Modeler, "a participatory modeling tool based in fuzzy-logic cognitive mapping",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mentalmodeler.org/resources/Gray%20et%20al%20Mental%20Modeler%202013.pdf|title=Mental Modeler: A Fuzzy-Logic Cognitive Mapping Modeling Tool for Adaptive Environmental Management|author=|date=|website=mentalmodeler.org|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; have recently been developed and used to collect/compare/combine mental model representations collected from individuals for use in social science research, collaborative decision-making, and natural resource planning.

===Mental model in relation to system dynamics and systemic thinking===
In the simplification of reality, creating a model can find a sense of reality, seeking to overcome [[systemic thinking]] and [[system dynamics]].

These two disciplines can help to construct a better coordination with the reality of mental models and simulate it accurately. They increase the probability that the consequences of how to decide and act in accordance with how to plan.&lt;ref name="SUSM2004"/&gt;

* '''[[System dynamics]]''' – extending mental models through the creation of explicit models, which are clear, easily communicated and can be compared with each other.
* '''[[Systemic thinking]]''' – seeking the means to improve the mental models and thereby improve the quality of dynamic decisions that are based on mental models.

===Single and double-loop learning===
After analyzing the basic characteristics, it is necessary to bring the process of changing the mental models, or the process of learning. [[Learning]] is a back-loop [[wikt:process|process]], and [[feedback]] loops can be illustrated as: single-loop learning or double-loop learning.

====Single-loop learning====
Mental models affect the way that people work with information, and also how they determine the final decision. The decision itself changes, but the mental models remain the same. It is the predominant method of learning, because it is very convenient.

====Double-loop learning====
{{Main|Double-loop learning}}
Double-loop learning (''see diagram below'') is used when it is necessary to change the mental model on which a decision depends. Unlike single loops, this model includes a shift in understanding, from simple and static to broader and more dynamic, such as taking into account the changes in the surroundings and the need for expression changes in mental models.&lt;ref name="mild2003"/&gt;

'''Models of communication''' are [[conceptual model]]s used to explain the human [[communication]] [[:wikt:process|process]]. The first major model for communication was developed in 1948 by [[Claude Elwood Shannon]] and published with an introduction by [[Warren Weaver]] for [[Bell Laboratories]].&lt;ref name="Shannon"&gt;Shannon, C. E., &amp; Weaver, W. (1949). ''The mathematical theory of communication''. Urbana, Illinois: [[University of Illinois Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Theory of communication|basic concept]], communication is the process of sending and receiving [[message]]s or transferring [[information]] from one part (sender) to another (receiver).{{sfn|Craig|1999}}

In 1960, David Berlo expanded the linear transmission model &lt;ref name="Berlo"&gt;Berlo, D. K. (1960). The process of communication; an introduction to theory and practice. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston. Claude E Shannon, W. W. (1949)&lt;/ref&gt; with the Sender-Message-Channel-Receiver(SMCR) Model of Communication. &lt;ref name="Schulz"&gt;Schulz, Peter. Cobley, Paul. (2013). Theories and Models of Communication. Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Wilbur Schramm introduced a model that identified multiple variables in communication which includes the transmitter, encoding, media, decoding, and receiver. &lt;ref name="Qing-Lan"&gt;Qing-Lan Chen, Chiou-Shuei Wei, Mei-Yao Huang and Chiu-Chi Wei. (2013) A model for project communication

==Shannon-Weaver Model==
Elwood Shannon and Warren Weaver were engineers that worked for Bell Telephone Labs in the United States. Their goal was to make sure that the telephone cables and radio waves were working at the maximum efficiency. Therefore, they developed the Shannon-Weaver model which had an intention to expand a mathematical theory of communication.&lt;ref name="Chandler"&gt;Chandler Daniel, The Transmission Model of Communication. http://transcriptions-2008.english.ucsb.edu/archive/courses/warner/english197/Schedule_files/Chandler/Transmission.model_files/trans.htm (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; The Shannon–Weaver model was developed in 1949 which is referred as the 'mother of all models'.&lt;ref name="Hollnagel"&gt;Erik Hollnagel, David D. Woods. Joint Cognitive Systems: Foundations of Cognitive Systems Engineering. CRC Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The model is well accepted as a main initial model for Communication Studies which has grown since then.&lt;ref name="Fiske"&gt; Fiske, John. Introduction to Communication Studies. London: Routledge (Chapter 1, 'Communication Theory' is a good introduction to this topic). (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

As well, the [[Shannon-Weaver model]] was designed to mirror the functioning of radio and telephone technology. Their initial model consisted of four primary parts: [[sender]], [[message]], [[Channel (communications)|channel]], and [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]]. The sender was the part of a [[telephone]] a person speaks into, the channel was the telephone itself, and the receiver was the part of the phone through which one can hear the person on the other end of the line. Shannon and Weaver also recognized that there may often be static or background sounds that interfere with the process of the other partner in a telephone conversation; they referred to this as noise. Certain types of background sounds can also indicate the absence of a signal.&lt;ref name="Chandler"/&gt;

The original model of Shannon and Weaver has five elements: information source, transmitter, channel, receiver, and destination.  To illustrate the process of the communication the first step is the information source where the information is stored. Next, in order to send the information, the message is encoded into signals, so it can travel to its destination. After the message is encoded, it goes through the channel which the signals are adapted for the transmission. In addition, the channel carried the noise course which is any interference that might happen to lead to the signal receive a different information from the source. After the channel, the message arrives in the receiver step where the message reconstruct (decode) from the signal. Finally, the message arrives at the destination.&lt;ref name="Faustine" /&gt;

In a simple model, often referred to as ''the transmission model'' or ''standard view of communication'', [[information]] or content (e.g. a message in [[natural language]]) is sent in some form (as [[spoken language]]) from an emissor/ sender/ [[encoder]] to a destination/ receiver/ decoder. According to this common communication-related conception, communication is viewed as a means of sending and receiving information. The strengths of this model are its simplicity, generality, and quantifiability. The mathematicians Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver structured this model on the basis of the following elements:

* An [[information source]], which produces a message.
* A [[transmitter]], which encodes the message into signals
* A [[Channel (communications)|channel]], for which signals are adapted for transmission
* A [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]], which reconstructs the encoded message from a sequence of received signals and decodes it.
* An information destination, where the message arrives.

Shannon and Weaver argued that this concept entails three levels of problems for communication:

# The technical problem: how accurately can the message be transmitted?
# The [[semantic]] problem: how precisely is the meaning 'conveyed'?
# The effectiveness problem: how effectively does the received meaning affect behavior?

[[Daniel Chandler]] criticizes the transmission model in the following terms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The Transmission Model of Communication|last = Chandler|first = Daniel|authorlink = |coauthors = |year = 1994|publisher = University of Western Australia|location = |isbn = |page = |pages = |url = http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/short/trans.html|accessdate = 11.06.2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* It assumes that communicators are isolated individuals.
* It makes no allowance for differing purposes.
* It makes no allowance for differing interpretations.
* It makes no allowance for unequal power relationships.

== Berlo ==

In 1960, David Berlo expanded Shannon and Weaver's 1949 linear model of communication and created the Sender-Message-Channel-Receiver (SMCR) Model of Communication.&lt;ref&gt;Berlo, D. K. (1960).'' The process of communication''. New York, New York: Holt, Rinehart, &amp; Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; The SMCR Model of Communication separated the model into clear parts and has been expanded upon by other scholars.

The Berlo's communication process is a simple application for communication of person-to-person which include communication source, encoder, message, channel, decoder, and communication receiver. &lt;ref name="Ann"&gt;Ann, Bette. Berlo's Communication Process Model as Applied to the Behavioral Theories of Maslow, Herzberg, and McGrego. Stead Source: The Academy of Management Journal, Vol. 15, No. 3 (Sep., 1972), pp. 389-394 Published by: Academy of Management Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/254868 &lt;/ref&gt; In addition, David Berlo presented some factors that influence the communication process between two people. The factors include communication skills, awareness level, social system, cultural system, and attitude.&lt;ref name="Sluková"&gt;Sluková, Petra Zia. Studies of Information and Knowledge Management in he European Context: No. 5 Communication of Information Reg. No: CZ.1.07/2.2.00/07.0284 OP: Education for Competitiveness Support area. 2.2 University Education Realization: VŠB-Technical University of Ostrava, Faculty of Economics, separate unit: Business Academy and HPS Valašské Meziříčí&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berlo's Model of Communication process starts at the source. This is the part where determine the communication skills, attitude, knowledge, social system, and culture of the people involved in the communication. After the message is developed which is elements in a set of symbols. &lt;ref name="Sluková" /&gt; Then the encoder step beginning. The encoder process is where the motor skills take place by speaking or writing. &lt;ref name="Ann" /&gt; The message goes through the channel which carries the message by hearing, seeing, touching, smelling, or tasting.&lt;ref name="Berlo" /&gt; Then the decoder process takes place. In this process, the receiver interpreter the message with her or him sensory skills. Finally, the communication receiver gets the whole message understood.&lt;ref name="Ann" /&gt;

== Schramm ==

Communication is usually described along a few major dimensions: Message (what type of things are communicated), source / emissor / sender / [[encoder]] (by whom), form (in which form), channel (through which [[media (communication)|medium]]), destination / receiver / target / decoder (to whom), and Receiver. [[Wilbur Schramm]] (1954) also indicated that we should also examine the impact that a message has (both desired and undesired) on the target of the message.&lt;ref&gt;Schramm, W. (1954). How communication works. In W. Schramm (Ed.), ''The process and effects of communication'' (pp. 3-26). Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Between parties, communication includes acts that confer knowledge and experiences, give advice and commands, and ask questions. These acts may take many forms, in one of the various manners of communication. The form depends on the abilities of the group communicating. Together, communication content and form make [[message]]s that are sent towards a destination. The target can be oneself, another [[Interpersonal Communication|person]] or being, another entity (such as a corporation or group of beings).

Communication can be seen as processes of [[information transmission]] governed by three levels of [[semiotic]] rules:
#[[Syntactic]] (formal properties of signs and symbols),
#[[Pragmatics|Pragmatic]] (concerned with the relations between signs/expressions and their users) and
#[[Semantic]] (study of relationships between signs and symbols and what they represent).

Therefore, communication is [[Interpersonal relationship|social interaction]] where at least two interacting agents share a common set of signs and a common set of [[semiotic]] rules. This commonly held rule in some sense ignores [[semiotics|autocommunication]], including [[intrapersonal communication]] via [[diary|diaries]] or self-talk, both secondary phenomena that followed the primary acquisition of communicative competences within social interactions.

== Barnlund ==

In light of these weaknesses, Barnlund (1970) proposed a transactional model of communication.&lt;ref&gt;Barnlund, D. C. (2008). A transactional model of communication. In. C. D. Mortensen (Eds.), ''Communication theory'' (2nd ed., pp47-57). New Brunswick, New Jersey: Transaction.&lt;/ref&gt;  The basic premise of the transactional model of communication is that individuals are simultaneously engaging in the sending and receiving of messages.

In a slightly more complex form, a sender and a receiver are linked [[wikt:reciprocal|reciprocally]]. This second attitude of communication, referred to as the constitutive model or constructionist view, focuses on how an individual communicates as the determining factor of the way the message will be interpreted. Communication is viewed as a conduit; a passage in which information travels from one individual to another and this information becomes separate from the communication itself. A particular instance of communication is called a [[speech act]].  The sender's personal filters and the receiver's personal filters may vary depending upon different regional traditions, cultures, or gender; which may alter the intended meaning of message contents.  In the presence of "[[communication noise|noise]]" on the transmission channel (air, in this case), reception and decoding of content may be faulty, and thus the speech act may not achieve the desired effect. One problem with this encode-transmit-receive-decode model is that the processes of encoding and decoding imply that the sender and receiver each possess something that functions as a [code-book], and that these two code books are, at the very least, similar if not identical.  Although something like code books is implied by the model, they are nowhere represented in the model, which creates many conceptual difficulties.

Theories of [[co-regulation]] describe communication as a creative and dynamic continuous process, rather than a discrete exchange of information. Canadian media scholar [[Harold Innis]] had the theory that people use different types of media to communicate and which one they choose to use will offer different possibilities for the shape and durability of society.&lt;ref name="Wark1997"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wark|first=McKenzie|year=1997|title=The Virtual Republic|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin, St Leonards}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}} His famous example of this is using [[ancient Egypt]] and looking at the ways they built themselves out of media with very different properties stone and papyrus. Papyrus is what he called ''''Space Binding''''. it made possible the transmission of written orders across space, empires and enables the waging of distant military campaigns and colonial administration. The other is stone and ''''Time Binding'''', through the construction of temples and the pyramids can sustain their authority generation to generation, through this media they can change and shape communication in their society.&lt;ref name="Wark1997"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}}

== Constructionist ==

There is an additional working definition of communication to consider{{examples|date=October 2011}} that authors like Richard A. Lanham (2003) and as far back as Erving Goffman (1959) have highlighted.  This is a progression from Lasswell's attempt to define human communication through to this century and revolutionized into the constructionist model.  Constructionists believe that the process of communication is in itself the only messages that exist.  The packaging can not be separated from the social and historical context from which it arose, therefore the substance to look at in communication theory is style for Richard Lanham and the performance of self for Erving Goffman.

Lanham chose to view communication as the rival to the over encompassing use of [[CBS model]] (which pursued to further the transmission model). CBS model argues that clarity, brevity, and sincerity are the only purpose to prose discourse, therefore communication. Lanham wrote: "If words matter too, if the whole range of human motive is seen as animating prose discourse, then rhetoric analysis leads us to the essential questions about prose style" (Lanham 10). This is saying that rhetoric and style are fundamentally important; they are not errors to what we actually intend to transmit. The process which we construct and deconstruct meaning deserves analysis.

Erving Goffman sees the performance of self as the most important frame to understand communication. Goffman wrote: "What does seem to be required of the individual is that he learn enough pieces of expression to be able to 'fill in' and manage, more or less, any part that he is likely to be given" (Goffman 73), highlighting the significance of expression.

The truth in both cases is the articulation of the message and the package as one. The construction of the message from social and historical context is the seed as is the pre-existing message is for the transmission model. Therefore, any look into communication theory should include the possibilities drafted by such great scholars as [[Richard A. Lanham]] and Goffman that style and performance is the whole process. lun

Communication stands so deeply rooted in human [[behavior]]s and the structures of [[society]] that scholars have difficulty thinking of it while excluding social or behavioral events.{{weasel inline|date=October 2011}} Because communication theory remains a relatively young field of inquiry and integrates itself with other disciplines such as philosophy, psychology, and sociology, one probably cannot {{As of|2006|alt=yet}} expect a consensus conceptualization of communication across disciplines.{{weasel inline|date=October 2011}}

Communication Model Terms as provided by Rothwell (11-15):
*''Noise''; interference with effective transmission and reception of a message.
**For example;
***physical noise or external noise which are environmental distractions such as poorly heated rooms, startling sounds, appearances of things, music playing some where else, and someone talking really loudly near you.
***physiological noise are biological influences that distract you from communicating competently such as sweaty palms, pounding heart, butterfly in the stomach, induced by speech anxiety, or feeling sick, exhausted at work, the ringing noise in your ear, being really hungry, and if you have a runny nose or a cough.
***psychological noise are the preconception bias and assumptions such as thinking someone who speaks like a valley girl is dumb, or someone from a foreign country can’t speak English well so you speak loudly and slowly to them.
***semantic noise are word choices that are confusing and distracting such as using the word tri-syllabic instead of three syllables.
*''Sender''; the initiator and encoder of a message
*''Receiver''; the one that receives the message (the listener) and the decoder of a message
*''Decode''; translates the sender's spoken idea/message into something the receiver understands by using their knowledge of language from personal experience.
*''Encode''; puts the idea into spoken language while putting their own meaning into the word/message.
*''Channel''; the medium through which the message travels such as through oral communication (radio, television, phone, in person) or written communication (letters, email, text messages)
*''Feedback''; the receiver's verbal and nonverbal responses to a message such as a nod for understanding (nonverbal), a raised eyebrow for being confused (nonverbal), or asking a question to clarify the message (verbal).
*''Message''; the verbal and nonverbal components of language that is sent to the receiver by the sender which conveys an idea.

Humans act toward people or things on the basis of the meanings they assign to those people or things.
-"Language is the source of meaning". 
-Meaning arises out of the social interaction people have with each other.

-Meaning is not inherent in objects but it is negotiated through the use of language, hence the term symbolic interactionism.
As human beings, we have the ability to name things.
Symbols, including names, are arbitrary signs.
By talking with others, we ascribe meaning to words and develop a universe of discourse
A symbol is a stimulus that has a learned/shared meaning and a value for people
Significant symbols can be nonverbal as well as linguistic.

-Negative responses can consequently reduce a person to nothing.
-Our expectations evoke responses that confirm what we originally anticipated, resulting in a self-fulfilling prophecy.

== Linear ==

This is a one-way model to communicate with others. It consists of the '''sender''' encoding a message and channeling it to the '''receiver''' in the presence of noise. In this model there is no feedback or response which may allow for a continuous 
exchange of information (F.N.S. Palma, 1993).

The linear model was first introduced by Shannon &amp; Weaver in 1949. In the linear communication model, the message travels one direction from the start point to the endpoint. In other words, once the sender sends the message to the receiver the communication process ends. Many communications online use the linear communication model. For example, when you send an email, post a blog, or share something on social media. However, the linear model does not explain many other forms of communication including face-to-face conversation.&lt;ref name="McCornack"&gt;McCornack, Steven. Ortiz, Joseph. Choice &amp; Connections: An Introduction to Communication. (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interactive/convergence ==

It is two linear models stacked on top of each other. The sender channels a message to the receiver and the receiver then becomes the sender and channels a message to the original sender. This model has added feedback, indicating that communication is not a one way but a two way process. It also has "field of experience" which includes our cultural background, ethnicity geographic location, extent of travel, and general personal experiences accumulated over the course of your lifetime. Draw backs – there is feedback but it is not simultaneous.
[[File:Interactive.png|thumb|left|alt=An Interactive Model of Communication.|The Interactive Model.]]
*For example, – instant messaging. The sender sends an IM to the receiver, then the original sender has to wait for the IM from the original receiver to react. Or a question/answer session where you just ask a question then you get an answer.

== Communication theory framework ==

{{Main article|Theory of communication}}

Communication theory can be seen from one of the following viewpoints:

*Mechanistic:  This view{{who|date=October 2011}} considers communication as a perfect transaction of a message from the sender to the receiver. (as seen in the diagram above)
*Psychological:  This view{{who|date=October 2011}} considers communication as the act of sending a message to a receiver, and the feelings and thoughts of the receiver upon interpreting the message.
*Social [[Social constructionism|Constructionist]] (Symbolic Interactionist):  This view considers communication to be the product of the interactants sharing and creating meaning.  The Constructionist View can also be defined as, how you say something determines what the message is.  The Constructionist View assumes that "truth" and "ideas" are constructed or invented through the social process of communication.  [[Robert T. Craig (scholar)|Robert T. Craig]] saw the Constructionist View or the constitutive view as it's called in his article, as "…an ongoing process that symbolically forms and re-forms our personal identities." (Craig, 125).  The other view of communication, the Transmission Model, sees communication as robotic and computer-like.  The Transmission Model sees communication as a way of sending or receiving messages and the perfection of that.  But, the Constructionist View sees communications as, "…in human life, info does not behave as simply as bits in an electronic stream.  In human life, information flow is far more like an electric current running from one landmine to another" (Lanham, 7).  The Constructionist View is a more realistic view of communication {{opinion|date=October 2011}} because it involves the interacting of human beings and the free sharing of thoughts and ideas.  Daniel Chandler looks to prove that the Transmission Model is a lesser way of communicating by saying "The transmission model is not merely a gross over-simplification but a dangerously misleading representation of the nature of human communication" (Chandler, 2).  Humans do not communicate simply as computers or robots so that's why it's essential to truly understand the Constructionist View of Communication well.  We do not simply send facts and data to one another, but we take facts and data and they acquire meaning through the process of communication, or through interaction with others.
*Systemic:  This view{{who|date=October 2011}} considers communication to be the new messages created via "through-put", or what happens as the message is being interpreted and re-interpreted as it travels through people.
*Critical: This view considers communication as a source of power and oppression of individuals and social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Littlejohn, S.W. and Foss, K.A. (2008). Theories of human communication, 9th edition. Belmont, CA: Thomson Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspection of a particular theory on this level will provide a framework on the nature of communication as seen within the confines of that theory.

Theories can also be studied and organized according to the ontological, epistemological, and axiological framework imposed by the theorist.

== Ontology ==

[[Ontology]] essentially poses the question of what, exactly, the theorist is examining. One must consider the very nature of reality.  The answer usually falls in one of three realms depending on whether the theorist sees the phenomena through the lens of a realist, nominalist, or social constructionist. Realist perspective views the world objectively, believing that there is a world outside of our own experience and cognitions.  Nominalists see the world subjectively, claiming that everything outside of one's cognitions is simply names and labels.  Social constructionists straddle the fence between objective and subjective reality, claiming that reality is what we create together.{{lopsided|date=October 2011}}{{POV statement|date=October 2011}}

== Epistemology ==
[[Epistemology]] is an examination of the approaches and beliefs which inform particular modes of study of phenomena and domains of expertise. In positivist approaches to epistemology, objective knowledge is seen as the result of the empirical observation and perceptual experience. In the history of science, empirical evidence collected by way of pragmatic-calculation and the scientific method is believed to be the most likely to reflect truth in the findings. Such approaches are meant to predict a phenomenon.  Subjective theory holds that understanding is based on situated knowledge, typically found using interpretative methodology such as ethnography and also interviews. Subjective theories are typically developed to explain or understand phenomena in the social world.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

== Axiology ==

[[Axiology]] is concerned with how values inform research and theory development.{{sfn|Miller|2005}} Most communication theory is guided by one of three axiological approaches.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}  The first approach recognizes that values will influence theorists' interests but suggests that those values must be set aside once actual research begins. Outside replication of research findings is particularly important in this approach to prevent individual researchers' values from contaminating their findings and interpretations.{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=30}} The second approach rejects the idea that values can be eliminated from any stage of theory development. Within this approach, theorists do not try to divorce their values from inquiry. Instead, they remain mindful of their values so that they understand how those values contextualize, influence or skew their findings.{{sfn|Miller|2005|pp=30–31}} The third approach not only rejects the idea that values can be separated from research and theory, but rejects the idea that they should be separated.  This approach is often adopted by [[critical theorists]] who believe that the role of communication theory is to identify oppression and produce social change. In this axiological approach, theorists embrace their values and work to reproduce those values in their research and theory development.{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=31}}

In [[finance]], '''negative amortization''' (also known as '''NegAm''', '''deferred interest''' or '''[[Graduated payment mortgage loan|graduated payment mortgage]]''') occurs whenever the loan payment for any period is less than the interest charged over that period so that the outstanding balance of the loan increases.  As an [[amortization]] method the shorted amount (difference between interest and repayment) is then added to the total amount owed to the lender. Such a practice would have to be agreed upon before shorting the payment so as to avoid default on payment.  This method is generally used in an introductory period before loan payments exceed interest and the loan becomes self-amortizing. The term is most often used for [[mortgage loan]]s; corporate loans with negative amortization are called [[PIK loan]]s.

Amortization refers to the process of paying off a debt (often from a loan or mortgage) through regular payments. A portion of each payment is for interest while the remaining amount is applied towards the principal balance. The percentage of interest versus principal in each payment is determined in an [[amortization schedule]].

==Defining characteristics==
Negative amortization only occurs in loans in which the periodic payment does not cover the amount of interest due for that loan period. The unpaid [[accrued interest]] is then capitalized monthly into the outstanding principal balance. The result of this is that the loan balance (or principal) increases by the amount of the unpaid interest on a monthly basis.  The purpose of such a feature is most often for advanced cash management and/or more simply payment flexibility, but not to increase overall affordability.

Neg-Ams also have what is called a recast period, and the recast principal balance cap is in the U.S. based on Federal and State legislation. The recast period is usually 60 months (5 years). The recast principal balance cap (also known as the "neg am limit") is usually up to a 25% increase of the amortized loan balance over the original loan amount. States and lenders can offer products with lesser recast periods and principal balance caps; but cannot issue loans that exceed their state and federal legislated requirements under penalty of law.

A newer loan option has been introduced which allows for a 40-year loan term. This makes the minimum payment even lower than a comparable 30-year term.

==Special cases==

* '''[[Reverse mortgage]]''': In the extreme or limiting case of the principle of negative amortization, the borrower in a loan does not need to make payments on the loan until the loan comes due; that is, all interest is capitalized, and the original principal and all interest accrued as of the due date are paid off together and at once.  The most common context in which this arrangement occurs is that of using residential single-family real estate as collateral for the loan, in which case the loan is known as a [[reverse mortgage]].  In the United States of America, the terms of reverse mortgages are heavily regulated by federal law, which as of January 2016 places a lower age limit on the set of permitted borrowers and requires that the mortgage come due only when the borrower no longer uses the property in question as his/her principal residence,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/sfh/hecm/rmtopten.cfm Reverse Mortgages - Top Ten Things to Know - HUD&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; usually due to the borrower's death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Due to the specificity of the reverse-mortgage concept and the limited context in which the term appears in practice, most United States authorities use the term "negative amortization" to denote those and only those loans in which the borrower pays throughout the lifetime of the loan but during and only during its early stages, known as the negative-amortization or "NegAm" period, makes what are in effect partial payments, namely payments lower than the amount of interest accrued during the payment term.

==Typical circumstances==
All NegAM home loans eventually require full repayment of principal and interest according to the original term of the mortgage and note signed by the borrower.  Most loans only allow NegAM to happen for no more than 5 years, and have terms to "Recast" (see below) the payment to a fully amortizing schedule if the borrower allows the principal balance to rise to a pre-specified amount.

This loan is written often in high cost areas, because the monthly mortgage payments will be lower than any other type of financing instrument.

Negative amortization loans can be high risk loans for inexperienced investors.  These loans tend to be safer in a falling rate market and riskier in a rising rate market.

Start rates on negative amortization or minimum payment option loans can be as low as 1%. This is the payment rate, not the actual interest rate. The payment rate is used to calculate the minimum payment. Other minimum payment options include 1.95% or more.

==Adjustable rate feature==
NegAM loans today are mostly straight [[adjustable rate mortgage]]s (ARMs), meaning that they are fixed for a certain period and adjust every time that period has elapsed; e.g., one month fixed, adjusting every month.  The NegAm loan, like all adjustable rate mortgages, is tied to a specific financial index which is used to determine the interest rate based on the current index and the margin (the [[Markup (business)|markup]] the lender charges).  Most NegAm loans today are tied to the Monthly Treasury Average, in keeping with the monthly adjustments of this loan.  There are also Hybrid ARM loans in which there is a period of fixed payments for months or years, followed by an increased change cycle, such as six months fixed, then monthly adjustable.

The '''[[Graduated payment mortgage loan|graduated payment mortgage]]''' is a "fixed rate" NegAm loan, but since the payment increases over time, it has aspects of the ARM loan until amortizing payments are required.

The most notable differences between the traditional payment option ARM and the hybrid payment option ARM are in the start rate, also known as the "minimum payment" rate.  On a Traditional Payment Option Arm, the minimum payment is based on a principal and interest calculation of 1% - 2.5% on average.

The start rate on a hybrid payment option ARM is higher, yet still extremely competitive payment wise.

On a hybrid payment option ARM, the minimum payment is derived using the "interest only" calculation of the start rate.  The start rate on the hybrid payment option ARM typically is calculated by taking the fully indexed rate (actual note rate), then subtracting 3%, which will give you the start rate.

Example:   7.5% fully indexed rate − 3% = 4.5%  (4.5% would be the start rate on a hybrid pay option ARM)

This guideline can vary among lenders.

Aliases the payment option ARM loans are known by:
* PayOption ARM 
* Negative Amortizing Loan  (Neg Am)
* Pick - A - Pay
* Deferred interest option loan  (this is the way this loan was introduced to the mortgage industry when first created)

==Mortgage terminology==
* Cap
: Percentage rate of change in the NegAm payment.  Each year, the minimum payment due rises.  Most minimum payments today rise at 7.5%.   Considering that raising a rate 1% on a mortgage at 5% is a 20% increase, the NegAm can grow quickly in a rising market.  Typically after the 5th year, the loan is recast to an adjustable loan due in 25 years. This is for a 30 year loan term. Newer payment option loans often offer a 40 year term with a higher underlying interest rate.
* Life cap
: The maximum interest rate allowed after recast according to the terms of the note.  Generally most NegAm loans in the last 5 years have a life cap of 9.95%.  Today many of these loans are capped at 12% or above.
(In general Author is using time references that are relative to a time frame that is not defined. 'Today' which is?; 'last 5 years' from when, etc.)
* Index
: The variable, such as the [[Cost of funds index|COFI]]; COSI; CODI or often MTA, which determines the adjustment as an increase or decrease in the interest rate. Other examples include the LIBOR and TREASURY.
* Margin
: Often disclosed in the adjustable rate rider of a Deed of Trust, the margin is determined by the lender and is used to calculate the interest rate.  Often the loan originator can increase the margin when structuring the product for the borrower.  An increase to the margin will also increase the borrower's interest rate, but will improve the [[yield spread premium]] which the loan originator may receive as compensation from the lender.
* Fully indexed rate (F.I.R.)
: The fully indexed rate is the sum of the margin and the current index value at the time of adjustment. The F.I.R. is the "interest rate" and determines the interest only, 30 year and 15 year amortized payments.  Most adjustable rate products have caps on rate adjustments.  If the note provides for a single adjustment not to exceed an increase by more than 1.5, and the variable index, for example, increased by 2.5 since the last adjustment, the fully indexed rate will top out at a maximum adjustment of 1.5, as stated in the note, for that particular adjustment period.  Often the F.I.R. is used to determine the debt to income ratio when qualifying a borrower for this loan product.
* Payment options
: There are typically 4 payment options (listed from highest to lowest):
:* 15 year payment
:** Amortized over a period of 15 years at the F.I.R.
:* 30 year payment
:** Amortized over a period of 30 years at the F.I.R.
:* Interest only payment
:** F.I.R. times the principal balance, divided by 12 months (with no amortization or reduction in the owed balance).
:* Minimum payment
:** Based on the minimal start rate determined by the lender.  When paying the minimum payment, the difference between the interest only payment and the minimum payment is deferred to the balance of the loan increasing what is owed on the mortgage.
* Period
: How often the NegAm payment changes.  Typically, the minimum payment rises once every twelve months in these types of loans.  Usually the rate of rise is 7.5%.  The F.I.R. is subject to adjusting with the variable Index, most often on a monthly basis, depending on the product.
* Recast
: Premature stop of NegAm.  Should the balance increase to a predetermined amount (from 110% up to 125% of the original balance per federal or state regulations) the loan will be "recast" with one of two payment options: the fully amortized principal and interest payment, or if the maximum balance has been reached before the fifth year, an interest only payment until the loan has matured to the recast date (typically 5 years).
* Stop
: End of NegAm payment schedule.

==Criticisms==
Negative-amortization loans, being relatively popular only in the last decade, have attracted a variety of criticisms:
* Unlike most other adjustable-rate loans, many negative-amortization loans have been advertised with either teaser or artificial, introductory interest rates or with the minimum loan payment expressed as a percentage of the loan amount.  For example, a negative-amortization loan is often advertised as featuring "1% interest", or by prominently displaying a 1% number without explaining the F.I.R.  This practice has been done by large corporate lenders.  This practice has been considered deceptive for two different reasons:  most mortgages do not feature [[teaser rate]]s, so consumers do not look out for them; and, many consumers aren't aware of the negative amortization side effect of only paying 1% of the loan amount per year.  In addition, most negative amortization loans contain a clause saying that the payment may not increase more than 7.5% each year, ''except'' if the 5-year period is over or if the balance has grown by 15%.  Critics say this clause is only there to deceive borrowers into thinking the payment could only jump a small amount, whereas in fact the other two conditions are more likely to occur.
* Negative-amortization loans as a class have the highest potential for what is known as payment shock.  Payment shock is when the required monthly payment jumps from one month to the next, potentially becoming unaffordable.  To compare various mortgages' payment-shock potential (note that the items here do not include escrow payments for insurance and taxes, which can cause changes in the payment amount):
** 30-year (or 15-year) fixed-rate fully amortized mortgages: no possible payment jump.
** 5-year adjustable-rate fully amortized mortgage: No payment jump for 5 years, then a possible payment decrease or increase based on the new interest rate.
** A 10-year interest only mortgage product, recasting to a 20-year amortization schedule (after ten years of interest-only payments) could see a payment increase of up to $600 on a balance of 330K.
** Negative amortization mortgage: no payment jump either until 5 years OR the balance grows 15% (depending on the product) higher than the original amount.  The payment increases, by requiring a full interest-plus-principal payment.  The payment could further increase due to interest-rate changes.  However, all things being equal, the fully amortized payment is almost triple the negatively amortized payment.
** First month free: a loan officer may allow the borrower to skip the first monthly payment on a refinance loan, by simply adding that payment to the principal and charging [[compound interest]] on it for many years.  The borrower may not understand or question the transaction.

In a very hot real estate market a buyer may use a negative-amortizing mortgage to purchase a property with the plan to sell the property at a higher price before the end of the "negam" period.  Therefore, an informed investor could purchase several properties with minimal monthly obligations and make a great profit over a five-year plan in a rising real-estate market.

However, if the property values decrease, it is likely that the borrower will owe more on the property than it is worth, known colloquially in the mortgage industry as "being underwater". In this situation, if the property owner cannot make the new monthly payment, he or she may be faced with foreclosure or having to refinance with a very high [[loan-to-value ratio]], requiring additional monthly obligations, such as mortgage insurance, and higher rates and payments due to the adversity of a high loan-to-value ratio.

It is very easy for borrowers to ignore or misunderstand the complications of this product when being presented with minimal monthly obligations that could be from one half to one third what other, more predictable, mortgage products require.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6575">The concept of '''negative and positive [[frequency]]''' can be as simple as a wheel rotating one way or the other way: a ''signed value'' of frequency can indicate both the rate and direction of rotation. The rate is expressed in units such as revolutions (a.k.a. ''cycles'') per second ([[hertz]]) or [[radians per second|radian/second]] (where 1&amp;nbsp;cycle corresponds to 2''π''&amp;nbsp;[[radian]]s).

==Sinusoids==
Let ''ω'' be a nonnegative parameter with units of radians/sec.  Then the angular function (angle vs. time) {{nowrap|−''ωt'' + ''θ''}}, has slope −''ω'', which is called a '''negative frequency'''.  But when the function is used as the argument of a cosine operator, the result is indistinguishable from {{nowrap|cos(''ωt'' − ''θ'')}}.&amp;nbsp; Similarly, {{nowrap|sin(−''ωt'' + ''θ'')}} is indistinguishable from {{nowrap|sin(''ωt'' − ''θ'' + ''π'')}}.  Thus any [[Sine wave|sinusoids]] can be represented in terms of positive frequencies.  The sign of the underlying phase slope is ambiguous.

[[File:Negative frequency.svg|thumb|right|300px|A negative frequency causes the sin function (violet) to lead the cos (red) by 1/4 cycle.]]
[[File:Unit_circle.svg|thumb|right|300px|The vector {{nowrap|(cos ''t'', sin ''t'')}} rotates counter-clockwise at 1&amp;nbsp;radian/second, and completes a circle every 2''π'' seconds.  The vector {{nowrap|(cos −''t'', sin −''t'')}} rotates in the other direction (not shown).]]
The ambiguity is resolved when the cosine and sine operators can be observed simultaneously, because {{nowrap|cos(''ωt'' + ''θ'')}} leads {{nowrap|sin(''ωt'' + ''θ'')}} by 1/4 cycle (= ''π''/2 radians) when {{nowrap|''ω'' &gt; 0}}, and lags by 1/4 cycle when {{nowrap|''ω'' &lt; 0}}.&amp;nbsp; Similarly, a vector, {{nowrap|(cos ''t'', sin ''t'')}}, rotates counter-clockwise at 1&amp;nbsp;radian/sec, and completes a circle every 2π seconds, and the vector {{nowrap|(cos −t, sin −t)}} rotates in the other direction.

The sign of ''ω'' is also preserved in the [[complex-valued function]]:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;e^{i \omega t} = \underbrace{\cos(\omega t)}_{R(t)} + i\cdot \underbrace{\sin(\omega t)}_{I(t)},&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;The equivalence is called [[Euler's formula]]&lt;/ref&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.1}}}}

since R(''t'') and I(''t'') can be separately extracted and compared.  Although &lt;math&gt;e^{i \omega t}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; clearly contains more information than either of its components, a common interpretation is that it is a simpler function, because:
* It simplifies many important [[Euler's formula#Relationship to trigonometry|trigonometric calculations]], which leads to its formal description as the [[analytic signal|analytic representation]] of &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\cos(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;See {{section link|Euler's formula|Relationship to trigonometry}} and {{section link|Phasor|Addition}} for examples of calculations simplified by the complex representation.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A corollary of {{EquationNote|Eq.1}} is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{NumBlk||&lt;math&gt;\cos(\omega t) = \begin{matrix}\frac{1}{2}\end{matrix}\left(e^{i \omega t} + e^{-i \omega t}\right),&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.2}}}}
which gives rise to the interpretation that cos(''ωt'') comprises ''both'' positive and negative frequencies.&amp;nbsp; But the sum is actually a cancellation that contains less, not more, information.  Any measure that indicates both frequencies includes a false positive, because ''ω'' can have only one sign.&lt;ref&gt;Conversely, any measure that indicates only one frequency has made an assumption, perhaps based on collateral information.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;  The [[Fourier transform]], for instance, merely tells us that cos(''ωt'') correlates equally well with both {{nowrap|cos(''ωt'') + ''i'' sin(''ωt'')}} and with {{nowrap|cos(''ωt'') − ''i'' sin(''ωt'')}}.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Applications==

Perhaps the most well-known application of negative frequency is the calculation:

:&lt;math&gt;X(\omega) = \int_{a}^{b} x(t)\cdot e^{-i\omega t} dt,&lt;/math&gt;

which is a measure of the amount of frequency ω in the function ''x''(''t'') over the interval {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'')}}.  When evaluated as a continuous function of ''ω'' for the theoretical interval {{nowrap|(−∞, ∞)}}, it is known as the [[Fourier transform]] of ''x''(''t'').  A brief explanation is that the product of two complex sinusoids is also a complex sinusoid whose frequency is the sum of the original frequencies.  So when ''ω'' is positive, &lt;math&gt;e^{-i\omega t}&lt;/math&gt; causes all the frequencies of ''x''(''t'') to be reduced by amount ''ω''.  Whatever part of ''x''(''t'') that was at frequency ''ω'' is changed to frequency zero, which is just a constant whose amplitude level is a measure of the strength of the original ''ω'' content.  And whatever part of ''x''(''t'') that was at frequency zero is changed to a sinusoid at frequency −''ω''.  Similarly, all other frequencies are changed to non-zero values.  As the interval {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'')}} increases, the contribution of the constant term grows in proportion.  But the contributions of the sinusoidal terms only oscillate around zero.  So ''X''(''ω'') improves as a relative measure of the amount of frequency ''ω'' in the function ''x''(''t'').

The [[Fourier transform]] of &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;e^{i \omega t}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; produces a non-zero response only at frequency ''ω''.  The transform of &lt;math&gt;\cos(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt; has responses at both ''ω'' and −''ω'', as anticipated by {{EquationNote|Eq.2}}.

==Sampling of positive and negative frequencies and aliasing==
{{Main article|Aliasing#Complex sinusoids}}
[[File:Aliasing between a positive and a negative frequency.png|frame|left|This figure depicts two complex sinusoids, colored gold and cyan, that fit the same sets of real and imaginary sample points.  They are thus aliases of each other when sampled at the rate (''f&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'') indicated by the grid lines.  The gold-colored function depicts a positive frequency, because its real part (the cos function) leads its imaginary part by 1/4 of one cycle.  The cyan function depicts a negative frequency, because its real part lags the imaginary part.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15337">The [[probability]] of the outcome of an experiment is never negative, although a [[quasiprobability distribution]] allows a '''negative probability''', or '''quasiprobability''' for some events. These distributions may apply to unobservable events or conditional probabilities.

==Physics and mathematics==
In 1942, [[Paul Dirac]] wrote a paper "The Physical Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.1942.0023|pages=1–39|jstor=97777|title=Bakerian Lecture. The Physical Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|volume=180|issue=980|year=1942|last1=Dirac|first1=P. A. M.|bibcode=1942RSPSA.180....1D}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he introduced the concept of [[negative energy|negative energies]] and negative [[probabilities]]:

: "Negative energies and probabilities should not be considered as nonsense.  They are well-defined concepts mathematically, like a negative of money."

The idea of negative probabilities later received increased attention in physics and particularly in [[quantum mechanics]].  [[Richard Feynman]] argued&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Feynman |first=Richard P. |date=1987 |editor1-last=Peat |editor1-first=F. David |editor2-last=Hiley |editor2-first=Basil |title=Quantum Implications: Essays in Honour of David Bohm |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul Ltd |pages=235–248 |chapter=Negative Probability |isbn=978-0415069601 |chapter-url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/154856/files/pre-27827.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; that no one objects to using negative numbers in calculations: although "minus three apples" is not a valid concept in real life, negative money is valid. Similarly he argued how negative probabilities as well as probabilities above [[1 (number)|unity]] possibly could be useful in probability [[calculations]].

Mark Burgin gives another example:
{{quote|"Let us consider the situation when an attentive person A with the high knowledge of English writes some text T. We may ask what the probability is for the word “texxt” or “wrod” to appear in his text T. Conventional probability theory gives 0 as the answer. However, we all know that there are usually misprints. So, due to such a misprint this word may appear but then it would be corrected. In terms of extended probability, a negative value (say, −0.1) of the probability for the word “texxt” to appear in his text T means that this word may appear due to a misprint but then it’ll be corrected and will not be present in the text T."|Mark Burgin|{{cite arXiv  |authorlink= |eprint=1008.1287 |title= Interpretations of Negative Probabilities|class= physics.data-an|year= 2010|version= |last1= Burgin|first1= Mark}}  }}

Negative probabilities have later been suggested to solve several problems and [[paradoxes]].&lt;ref&gt;Khrennikov, A. Y. (1997): ''Non-Archimedean Analysis: Quantum Paradoxes, Dynamical Systems and Biological Models''. Kluwer Academic Publishers. {{ISBN|0-7923-4800-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Half-coins'' provide simple examples for negative probabilities. These strange coins were introduced in 2005 by [[Gábor J. Székely]].&lt;ref&gt;Székely, G.J. (2005) [http://www.wilmott.com/pdfs/100609_gjs.pdf Half of a Coin: Negative Probabilities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108010759/http://www.wilmott.com/pdfs/100609_gjs.pdf |date=2013-11-08 }}, Wilmott Magazine July, pp 66–68.&lt;/ref&gt; Half-coins have infinitely many sides numbered with 0,1,2,... and the positive even numbers are taken with negative probabilities. Two half-coins make a complete coin in the sense that if we flip two half-coins then the sum of the outcomes is 0 or 1 with probability 1/2 as if we simply flipped a fair coin.

In ''[[Convolution quotient]]s of nonnegative definite functions''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pages= 235–239|doi=10.1007/BF01352002|title=Convolution quotients of nonnegative functions|journal=Monatshefte für Mathematik|volume=95|issue=3|year=1983|last1=Ruzsa|first1=Imre Z.|last2=SzéKely|first2=Gábor J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Algebraic Probability Theory'' &lt;ref&gt;Ruzsa, I.Z. and Székely, G.J. (1988): ''Algebraic Probability Theory'', Wiley, New York {{ISBN|0-471-91803-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Imre Z. Ruzsa]] and [[Gábor J. Székely]] proved that if a [[random variable]] X has a signed or quasi distribution where some of the probabilities are negative then one can always find two random variables, Y and Z, with ordinary (not signed / not quasi) distributions such that X, Y are independent and X + Y = Z in distribution. Thus X can always be interpreted as the "difference" of two ordinary random variables, Z and Y. If Y is interpreted as a measurement error of X and the observed value is Z then the negative regions of the distribution of X are masked / shielded by the error Y.

Another example known as the Wigner distribution in [[phase space formulation|phase space]], introduced by [[Eugene Wigner]] in 1932 to study quantum corrections, often leads to negative probabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pages=749–759|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.40.749|title=On the Quantum Correction for Thermodynamic Equilibrium|journal=Physical Review|volume=40|issue=5|year=1932|last1=Wigner|first1=E.|bibcode=1932PhRv...40..749W}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, it has later been better known as the [[Wigner quasiprobability distribution]]. In 1945, [[M. S. Bartlett]] worked out the mathematical and logical consistency of such negative valuedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Bartlett | first=  M. S.| year = 1945| title= Negative Probability | journal=Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society | volume = 41| pages=  71–73 | doi = 10.1017/S0305004100022398|bibcode = 1945PCPS...41...71B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wigner distribution function is routinely used in [[physics]] nowadays, and provides the cornerstone of [[Weyl quantization|phase-space quantization]]. Its negative features are an asset to the formalism, and often indicate quantum interference.  The negative regions of the distribution are shielded from direct observation by the quantum [[uncertainty principle]]: typically, the moments of such a non-positive-semidefinite quasiprobability distribution are highly constrained, and prevent ''direct measurability'' of the negative regions of the distribution. But these regions contribute negatively and crucially to the [[expected value]]s of observable quantities computed through such distributions, nevertheless.

=== An example: the double slit experiment ===

Consider a double slit experiment with photons. The two waves exiting each slit can be written as:

&lt;math&gt;f_1(x) = \sqrt{\frac{dN/dt}{2\pi/d}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{d^2+(x+a/2)^2}}\exp\left[i(h/\lambda)\sqrt{d^2+(x+a/2)^2}\right],&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;f_2(x) = \sqrt{\frac{dN/dt}{2\pi/d}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{d^2+(x-a/2)^2}}\exp\left[i(h/\lambda)\sqrt{d^2+(x-a/2)^2}\right],&lt;/math&gt;

where ''d'' is the distance to the detection screen, ''a'' is the separation between the two slits, ''x'' the distance to the center of the screen, ''λ'' the wavelength and ''dN/dt'' is the number of photons emitted per unit time at the source. The amplitude of measuring a photon at distance ''x'' from the center of the screen is the sum of these two amplitudes coming out of each hole, and therefore the probability that a photon is detected at position ''x'' will be given by the square of this sum:

&lt;math&gt;I(x) = \left\vert f_1(x)+f_2(x) \right\vert^2 = \left\vert f_1(x) \right\vert^2 + \left\vert f_2(x) \right\vert^2 + \left[f_1^*(x)f_2(x)+f_1(x)f_2^*(x)\right]&lt;/math&gt;,

This should strike you as the well-known probability rule:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,\,\mathtt{going}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{either}\,\,\mathtt{slit})
 = \,&amp;P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,\,\mathtt{going}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{slit}\,\,\mathtt{1}) \\
&amp; + P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,\,\mathtt{going}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{slit}\,\,\mathtt{2}) \\
&amp; - P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,\,\mathtt{going}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{both}\,\,\mathtt{slits}) \\ \\
=\,&amp;P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,|\,\mathtt{went}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{slit}\,\,\mathtt{1})\,P(\mathtt{going}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{slit}\,\,\mathtt{1}) \\
&amp; + P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,|\,\mathtt{went}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{slit}\,\,\mathtt{2})\,P(\mathtt{going}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{slit}\,\,\mathtt{2}) \\
&amp; - P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,\,\mathtt{going}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{both}\,\,\mathtt{slits}) \\ \\
=\,&amp;P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,|\,\mathtt{went}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{slit}\,\,\mathtt{1})\,\frac{1}{2} \\
&amp; + P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,|\,\mathtt{went}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{slit}\,\,\mathtt{2})\,\frac{1}{2} \\
&amp; - P(\mathtt{photon}\,\,\mathtt{reaches}\,\,\mathtt{x}\,\,\mathtt{going}\,\,\mathtt{through}\,\,\mathtt{both}\,\,\mathtt{slits})
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Negative joint probability 2.svg|thumb|In blue, the sum of the probabilities of going through holes 1 and 2; in red, minus the joint probability of going through "both holes". The interference pattern is obtained by adding the two curves.]]whatever the last term means. Indeed, if one closes either one of the holes forcing the photon to go through the other slit, the two corresponding intensities are

&lt;math&gt;I_1(x) = \left\vert f_1(x) \right\vert^2 = \frac{1}{2}\frac{dN}{dt}\frac{d/\pi}{d^2+(x+a/2)^2}&lt;/math&gt;  and  &lt;math&gt;I_2(x) = \left\vert f_2(x) \right\vert^2 = \frac{1}{2}\frac{dN}{dt}\frac{d/\pi}{d^2+(x-a/2)^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

But now, if one does interpret each of these terms in this way, the joint probability takes negative values roughly every &lt;math&gt;\lambda\frac{d}{a}&lt;/math&gt; !&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} I_{12}(x) &amp; = \left[f_1^*(x)f_2(x)+f_1(x)f_2^*(x)\right] \\ &amp; = \frac{1}{2}\frac{dN}{dt}\frac{d/\pi}{\sqrt{d^2+(x-a/2)^2}\sqrt{d^2+(x+a/2)^2}}\sin\left[(h/\lambda)(\sqrt{d^2+(x+a/2)^2}-\sqrt{d^2+(x-a/2)^2})\right] \\ \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

However, these negative probabilities are never observed as one can't isolate the cases in which the photon "goes through both slits", but can hint at the existence of anti-particles.

== Finance ==

Negative probabilities have more recently been applied to [[mathematical finance]]. In quantitative finance most probabilities are not real probabilities but pseudo probabilities, often what is known as [[risk neutral]] probabilities.{{clarify|date=March 2015}} These are not real probabilities, but theoretical "probabilities" under a series of assumptions that helps simplify calculations by allowing such pseudo probabilities to be negative in certain cases as first pointed out by Espen Gaarder Haug in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Haug, E. G. (2004): [http://www.espenhaug.com/NegativeProbabilitiesHaug.pdf Why so Negative to Negative Probabilities], Wilmott Magazine, Re-printed in the book (2007); Derivatives Models on Models, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

A rigorous mathematical definition of negative probabilities and their properties was recently derived by Mark Burgin and Gunter Meissner (2011). The authors also show how negative probabilities can be applied to financial [[option pricing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1773077  Burgin and Meissner: Negative Probabilities in Financial Modeling] Wilmott Magazine March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Engineering ==

The concept of negative probabilities have also been proposed for reliable facility location models where facilities are subject to negatively correlated disruption risks when facility locations, customer allocation, and backup service plans are determined simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snyder|first=L.V.|last2=Daskin|first2=M.S.|date=2005|title=Reliability Models for Facility Location: The Expected Failure Cost Case|url=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/trsc.1040.0107|journal=Transportation Science|volume=39|issue=3|pages=400–416|doi=10.1287/trsc.1040.0107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cui|first=T.|last2=Ouyang|first2=Y.|last3=Shen|first3=Z-J.

This approach reduces a problem from one with correlated disruptions to one without. Xie et al.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xie|first=S.|last2=Li|first2=X.|last3=Ouyang|first3=Y.|date=|year=2015|title=Decomposition of general facility disruption correlations via augmentation of virtual supporting stations|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261515001290|journal=Transportation Research Part B|volume=80|pages=64–81|doi=10.1016/j.trb.2015.06.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; later showed how negatively correlated disruptions can also be addressed by the same modeling framework, except that a supporting station now may be disrupted with a “failure propensity” which

“... inherits all mathematical characteristics and properties of a failure probability except that we allow it to be larger than 1...”

This finding paves ways for using compact mixed-integer mathematical programs to optimally design reliable location of service facilities under site-dependent and positive/negative/mixed disruption correlations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xie|first=S.|last2=An|first2=K.|last3=Ouyang|first3=Y.|date=2017|title=Planning of Facility Location under Correlated Facility Disruptions|url=|journal=Under Review|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed “propensity” concept in Xie et al.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; turns out to be what Feynman and others referred to as “quasi-probability.” Note that when a quasi-probability is larger than 1, then 1 minus this value gives a negative probability. The truly physically verifiable observation is the facility disruption states, and there is no direct information on the station states or their corresponding probabilities. Hence the failure probability of the stations, interpreted as “probabilities of imagined intermediary states,” could exceed unity.

* Existence of states of negative norm (or fields with the wrong sign of the kinetic term, such as [[Pauli–Villars regularization|Pauli–Villars ghosts]]) allows the probabilities to be negative. See [[Ghosts (physics)]].

A '''negative repetition''' ('''negative rep''') is the repetition of a technique in [[weight training|weight lifting]] in which the lifter performs the eccentric phase of a lift.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Definition of Eccentric Weight Training|url = http://weighttraining.about.com/od/glossary/g/eccentric.htm|accessdate = 2015-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of pressing the weight up slowly, in proper form, a [[Spotting (weight training)|spotter]] generally aids in the concentric, or lifting, portion of the repetition while the lifter slowly performs the eccentric phase for 3–6 seconds. Negative reps are used to improve both [[Physical strength|muscular strength]] and power in subjects, this is commonly known as hypertrophy training.

Due to its mechanical properties, this form of training can be used for both healthy individuals and individuals who are in rehabilitation. Studies have shown that negative repetitions or "[[Eccentric training|eccentric phase training]]" combines a high amount of force on the muscle with a lower energy cost than normal concentric training, which requires 4–5 times the amount of energy. This justifies why this type of training is more beneficial and less of a risk to subjects rehabilitating or with a limited exercise capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://bv8ja7kw5x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Eccentric+Exercise+Training%3A+Modalities%2C+Applications+and+Perspectives&amp;rft.jtitle=Sports+Medicine&amp;rft.au=Marie-Eve+Isner-Horobeti&amp;rft.au=St%C3%A9phane+Pascal+Dufour&amp;rft.au=Philippe+Vautravers&amp;rft.au=Bernard+Geny&amp;rft.date=2013-06-01&amp;rft.pub=Springer+Science+%26+Business+Media&amp;rft.issn=0112-1642&amp;rft.eissn=1179-2035&amp;rft.volume=43&amp;rft.issue=6&amp;rft.spage=483&amp;rft.externalDocID=3141405021&amp;paramdict=en-US|title = Eccentric exercise training: modalities, applications and perspectives|last = |first = |date = 2013|journal = Sports Medicine|doi = 10.1007/s40279-013-0052-y|pmid = |access-date = |volume=43 |pages=483–512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Eccentric training is often associated with the terms "muscles soreness" and "muscle damage". In 1902, [[Theodore Hough]] discovered and developed the term DOMS ([[delayed onset muscle soreness]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://breakingmuscle.com/strength-conditioning/doms-the-good-the-bad-and-what-it-really-means-to-your-training|title = DOMS: the good, the bad and what it really means to your training|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; after he found that exercises containing negative repetitions caused athletes to have sore muscles. Hough believed this was causing a rupture within the muscle; when he looked further into the subject, he found that when performing eccentric exercise that exhibited soreness, the muscle "quickly adapts and becomes accustomed to the increase in applied stress".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mc.uky.edu/athletic_training/docs/nzsmsc-2010/Eccentric_Training_Spring2011.pdf|title = Eccentric training|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of this was that the muscles' soreness not only decreased, but the muscular damage did too.

== Health benefits for the elderly ==
It has been proven that eccentric resistance training improves the functional mobility of older adults. Studies have shown that eccentric training of the lower body, in particular the [[:Category:Knee extensors|knee extensors]], are essential in preventing falls in older adults and helping them maintain their independence. A study conducted focusing on eccentric training for the age group 65–87 years of age showed that, over 12 weeks, they had strengthened their knee extensors by up to 26%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://bv8ja7kw5x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Aging%2C+functional+capacity+and+eccentric+exercise+training&amp;rft.jtitle=Aging+and+disease&amp;rft.au=Gault%2C+Mandy+L&amp;rft.au=Willems%2C+Mark+E+T&amp;rft.date=2013&amp;rft.eissn=2152-5250&amp;rft.volume=4&amp;rft.issue=6&amp;rft.spage=351&amp;rft_id=info:pmid/24307968&amp;rft.externalDocID=24307968&amp;paramdict=en-US|title = Aging, Functional Capacity and Eccentric Exercise Training|last = |first = |date = 2013|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; With this evidence, it is reasonable to suggest that negative repetitions can help improve the health of older adults.

== Treatment of Tendinopathy ==
Studies have shown that eccentric training may be successful in the treatment of certain [[Tendinitis|tendonitis]]. Studies have shown that the use of eccentric training for twelve weeks may be an alternative to therapy for people suffering from [[Patellar tendinitis|Patellar Tendinopathy]] (Jumper's Knee).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Surgical Treatment Compared with Eccentric Training for Patellar Tendinopathy (Jumper's Knee)|url = http://jbjs.org/content/88/8/1689|journal = The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery|date = 2006-08-01|access-date = 2015-04-16|issn = 0021-9355|pmid = 16882889|pages = 1689–1698|volume = 88|issue = 8|doi = 10.2106/JBJS.E.01181|first = Roald|last = Bahr|first2 = Bjørn|last2 = Fossan|first3 = Sverre|last3 = Løken|first4 = Lars|last4 = Engebretsen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eccentric training has also been proven successful in the treatment of chronic [[Achilles tendinitis|Achilles tendonitis]], using a twelve-week eccentric calf muscle program various studies have shown the ability for people to return to normal pre-tendonitis levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Chronic Achilles tendon pain treated with eccentric calf-muscle training|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00167-003-0418-z|journal = Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy|date = 2003-08-26|access-date = 2015-04-16|issn = 0942-2056|pages = 327–333|volume = 11|issue = 5|doi = 10.1007/s00167-003-0418-z|first = Martin|last = Fahlström|first2 = Per|last2 = Jonsson|first3 = Ronny|last3 = Lorentzon|first4 = Håkan|last4 = Alfredson|pmid=12942235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1034/j.1600-0838.2001.110402.x/epdf|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1034/j.1600-0838.2001.110402.x/epdf|accessdate = 2015-04-16 | doi=10.1034/j.1600-0838.2001.110402.x|volume=11|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports|pages=197–206}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasoning behind the benefits of eccentric training for tendinopathy is still unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Clinical improvement after 6 weeks of eccentric exercise in patients with mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy – a randomized trial with 1-year follow-up |url = http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1600-0838.2004.378.x|journal = Scand J Med Sci Sports|access-date = 2015-04-16|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0838.2004.378.x|volume=14|pages=286–295|pmid=15387802|date=October 2004 | last1 = Roos | first1 = EM | last2 = Engström | first2 = M | last3 = Lagerquist | first3 = A | last4 = Söderberg | first4 = B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative resistance is an uncommon property which occurs in a few [[linear circuit|nonlinear]] electronic components. In a nonlinear device, two types of resistance can be defined: 'static' or 'absolute resistance', the ratio of voltage to current &lt;math&gt;v/i\,&lt;/math&gt;, and ''differential resistance'', the ratio of a change in voltage to the resulting change in current &lt;math&gt;\Delta v/\Delta i&lt;/math&gt;. The term negative resistance means '''negative differential resistance (NDR)''', &lt;math&gt;\Delta v/\Delta i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. In general, a negative differential resistance is a two-terminal component which can [[amplifier|amplify]],&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Suzuki"&gt;"''In semiconductor physics, it is known that if a two-terminal device shows negative differential resistance it can amplify.''" {{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of devices with negative differential resistance are [[tunnel diode]]s, [[Gunn diode]]s, and [[gas discharge tube]]s such as [[neon lamp]]s. In addition, circuits containing amplifying devices such as [[transistor]]s and [[op amp]]s with [[positive feedback]] can have negative differential resistance. These are used in [[electronic oscillator|oscillators]] and [[active filter]]s.

Because they are nonlinear, negative resistance devices have a more complicated behavior than the positive "ohmic" resistances usually encountered in [[electric circuit]]s. Unlike most positive resistances, negative resistance varies depending on the voltage or current applied to the device, and negative resistance devices can have negative resistance over only a limited portion of their voltage or current range.&lt;ref name="Kaplan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilmore" /&gt; Therefore, there is no real "negative resistor" analogous to a positive [[resistor]], which has a constant negative resistance over an arbitrarily wide range of current.

The resistance is the ratio of voltage to current, the inverse slope of the line (in ''I–V'' graphs where the voltage &lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt; is the independent variable) and is constant.

:Differential resistance is only relevant to time-varying currents.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb" /&gt; Points on the curve where the slope is negative (declining to the right), meaning an increase in voltage causes a decrease in current, have '''''negative differential resistance''''' {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;r_\text{diff}\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;)}}.&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gottlieb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Simpson" /&gt; Devices of this type can amplify signals,&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Suzuki" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shahinpoor" /&gt; and are what is usually meant by the term "negative resistance".&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Simpson" /&gt;

Negative resistance, like positive resistance, is measured in [[ohm]]s.

==Operation==
One way in which the different types of resistance can be distinguished is in the directions of current and electric power between a circuit and an electronic component. The illustrations below, with a rectangle representing the component attached to a circuit, summarize how the different types work:
{|
|-
| The voltage '''''v''''' and current '''''i''''' variables in an electrical component must be defined according to the [[passive sign convention]]; positive [[conventional current]] is defined to enter the positive voltage terminal; this means power '''''P''''' flowing from the circuit into the component is defined to be positive, while power flowing from the component into the circuit is negative.&lt;ref name="Traylor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Glisson" /&gt; This applies to both DC and AC current. The diagram shows the directions for positive values of the variables. || [[File:Passive sign convention.svg|140px]]
|-
| In a '''positive static resistance''', &lt;math&gt;R_\text{static}\;=\;v/i\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;, so '''''v''''' and '''''i''''' have the same sign.&lt;ref name="Chua2"&gt;{{cite book

}}, &lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, from the passive sign convention above, conventional current (flow of positive charge) is through the device from the positive to the negative terminal, in the direction of the [[electric field]] '''''E''''' (decreasing [[electric potential|potential]]).&lt;ref name="Traylor" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;P\;=\;vi\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt; so the charges lose [[potential energy]] doing [[work (physics)|work]] on the device, and electric power flows from the circuit into the device,&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Karady" /&gt; where it is converted to heat or some other form of energy ''(yellow)''. If AC voltage is applied, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; periodically reverse direction, but the instantaneous &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; always flows from the higher potential to the lower potential. || [[File:Electric load animation 2.gif|140px]]
|-
| In a '''power source''', &lt;math&gt;R_\text{static}\;=\;v/i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt; so &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; have opposite signs.&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt; This means current is forced to flow from the negative to the positive terminal.&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt; The charges gain potential energy, so power flows out of the device into the circuit:&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;P\;=\;vi\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. Work ''(yellow)'' must be done on the charges by some power source in the device to make them move in this direction against the force of the electric field. || [[File:Electric power source animation 2.gif|140px]]
|-
| In a passive '''negative differential resistance''', &lt;math&gt;r_\text{diff}\;=\;\Delta v/\Delta i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;, only the ''AC component'' of the current flows in the reverse direction. The static resistance is positive&lt;ref name="Shanefield" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gottlieb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; so the current flows from positive to negative: &lt;math&gt;P\;=\;vi\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. But the current (rate of charge flow) decreases as the voltage increases. So when a time-varying (AC) voltage is applied in addition to a DC voltage ''(right)'', the time-varying current &lt;math&gt;\Delta i\,&lt;/math&gt; and voltage &lt;math&gt;\Delta v\,&lt;/math&gt; components have opposite signs, so &lt;math&gt;P_\text{AC}\;=\;\Delta v\Delta i\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt; This means the instantaneous AC current &lt;math&gt;\Delta i\,&lt;/math&gt; flows through the device in the direction of increasing AC voltage &lt;math&gt;\Delta v\,&lt;/math&gt;, so AC power flows out of the device into the circuit. The device consumes DC power, some of which is converted to AC signal power which can be delivered to a load in the external circuit,&lt;ref name="Carr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt; enabling the device to amplify the AC signal applied to it.&lt;ref name="Suzuki" /&gt; || [[File:Negative differential resistance animation.gif|150px]]

}} In this video Prof. Horowitz demonstrates that negative static resistance actually exists. He has a black box with two terminals, labelled "−10 kilohms" and shows with ordinary test equipment that it acts like a linear negative resistor (active resistor) with a resistance of −10 KΩ: a positive voltage across it causes a proportional ''negative'' current through it, and when connected in a voltage divider with an ordinary resistor the output of the divider is greater than the input, it can amplify. At the end he opens the box and shows it contains an op-amp negative impedance converter circuit and battery.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; Unlike in the above devices, the downward-sloping region of the ''I–V'' curve passes through the origin, so it lies in the 2nd and 4th quadrants of the plane, meaning the device sources power.&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt; Amplifying devices like [[transistor]]s and [[op-amp]]s with positive [[feedback]] can have this type of negative resistance,&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pippard3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Crisson"&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Battery and resistor circuit 2.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|From [[Kirchhoff's voltage law|KVL]], the static resistance of a power source (''R''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;), such as a battery, is always equal to the negative of the static resistance of its load (''R''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt; ]]

However it is easily shown that the ratio of voltage to current '''''v/i''''' at the terminals of any power source (AC or DC) is negative.&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt; For electric power ([[potential energy]]) to flow out of a device into the circuit, charge must flow through the device in the direction of increasing potential energy, [[conventional current]] (positive charge) must move from the negative to the positive terminal.&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt; So the direction of the instantaneous current is ''out'' of the positive terminal. This is opposite to the direction of current in a passive device defined by the [[passive sign convention]] so the current and voltage have opposite signs, and their ratio is negative
:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{static} = \frac {v}{i} &lt; 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
This can also be proved from [[Joule's first law|Joule's law]]&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P = iv = i^2 R_\mathrm{static} \,&lt;/math&gt;
This shows that power can flow out of a device into the circuit {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;P\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;)}} if and only if &lt;math&gt;R_\text{static}\;&lt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; Whether or not this quantity is referred to as "resistance" when negative is a matter of convention. The absolute resistance of power sources is negative,&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt; but this is not to be regarded as "resistance" in the same sense as positive resistances. The negative static resistance of a power source is a rather abstract and not very useful quantity, because it varies with the load. Due to [[conservation of energy]] it is always simply equal to the negative of the static resistance of the attached circuit ''(right)''.&lt;ref name="Morecroft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt;

[[Work (physics)|Work]] must be done on the charges by some source of energy in the device, to make them move toward the positive terminal against the electric field, so [[conservation of energy]] requires that negative static resistances have a source of power.&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Simin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Solymar"&gt;{{cite book

This derives a slightly more complicated circuit where the two voltage divider resistors are different to allow scaling, but it reduces to the text circuit by setting ''R2'' and ''R3'' in the source to ''R1'' in the text, and ''R1'' in source to ''Z'' in the text. The ''I–V'' curve is the same.&lt;/ref&gt; will reverse the direction of current flow, making its static resistance positive so it consumes power. Similarly, applying a voltage to the negative impedance converter below greater than its power supply voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; will cause the amplifier to saturate, also making its resistance positive.

==Negative differential resistance==
In a device or circuit with negative differential resistance (NDR), in some part of the ''I–V'' curve the current decreases as the voltage increases:&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_\mathrm{diff} = \frac {dv}{di} &lt; 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
The ''I–V'' curve is [[monotonic|nonmonotonic]] (having peaks and troughs) with regions of negative slope representing negative differential resistance.

[[Passivity (engineering)|Passive]] negative differential resistances have positive ''static'' resistance;&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shanefield" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; they consume net power. Therefore, the ''I–V'' curve is confined to the 1st and 3rd quadrants of the graph,&lt;ref name="Kumar2" /&gt; and passes through the origin. This requirement means (excluding some asymptotic cases) that the region(s) of negative resistance must be limited,&lt;ref name="Gilmore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; and surrounded by regions of positive resistance, and cannot include the origin.&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaplan" /&gt;

The reason is that in [[linear circuit]]s if the load line crosses the I-V curve of the NR device at one point, the circuit is stable, while in nonlinear switching circuits that operate by [[hysteresis]] the same condition causes the circuit to become unstable and oscillate as an [[astable multivibrator]], and the [[bistability|bistable]] region is considered the "stable" one. This article uses the former "linear" definition, the earliest one, which is found in the Abraham, Bangert, Dorf, Golio, and Tellegen sources. The latter "switching circuit" definition is found in the Kumar and Taub sources.&lt;/ref&gt; or "'''N'''" type): In this type the current is a [[single-valued function|single valued]], [[continuous function]] of the voltage, but the voltage is a [[multivalued function]] of the current.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; In the most common type there is only one negative resistance region, and the graph is a curve shaped generally like the letter "N". As the voltage is increased, the current increases (positive resistance) until it reaches a maximum (''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), then decreases in the region of negative resistance to a minimum (''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), then increases again.

Suppose the negative resistance at the bias point is &lt;math&gt;\Delta v /\Delta i\,=\,-r&lt;/math&gt;. For stability &lt;math&gt;R\,&lt;/math&gt; must be less than &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt; Using the formula for a [[voltage divider]], the AC output voltage is&lt;ref name="Weaver" /&gt;

In a normal voltage divider, the resistance of each branch is less than the resistance of the whole, so the output voltage is less than the input. Here, due to the negative resistance, the total AC resistance &lt;math&gt;r - R\,&lt;/math&gt; is less than the resistance of the diode alone &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt; so the AC output voltage &lt;math&gt;v_o&lt;/math&gt; is greater than the input &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt;. The voltage gain &lt;math&gt;G_v\,&lt;/math&gt; is greater than one, and increases without limit as &lt;math&gt;R\,&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt;.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NDR acts as a dependent AC [[current source]] of value Δ''i'' = Δ''v''/''r''. Because the current and voltage are 180° out of phase, the instantaneous AC current Δ''i'' flows ''out'' of the terminal with positive AC voltage Δ''v''. Therefore it adds to the AC source current Δ''i''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; through the load ''R'', increasing the output power.&lt;ref name="Lowry" /&gt;

The diagrams illustrate how a biased negative differential resistance device can increase the power of a signal applied to it, amplifying it, although it only has two terminals. Due to the [[superposition principle]] the voltage and current at the device's terminals can be divided into a DC bias component {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;V_{bias},\;I_{bias}&lt;/math&gt;)}} and an AC component {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;\Delta v,\;\Delta i&lt;/math&gt;)}}.
:&lt;math&gt;v(t) = V_\text{bias} + \Delta v(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i(t) = I_\text{bias} + \Delta i(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
Since a positive change in voltage &lt;math&gt;\Delta v\,&lt;/math&gt; causes a ''negative'' change in current &lt;math&gt;\Delta i\,&lt;/math&gt;, the AC current and voltage in the device are 180° [[out of phase]].&lt;ref name="Carr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Radmanesh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler"&gt;{{cite web

With the proper external circuit, the device can increase the AC signal power delivered to a load, serving as an [[amplifier]],&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt; or excite oscillations in a resonant circuit to make an [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]]. Unlike in a [[two port]] amplifying device such as a transistor or op amp, the amplified signal leaves the device through the same two terminals ([[two port|port]]) as the input signal enters.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt;

In a passive device, the AC power produced comes from the input DC bias current,&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; the device absorbs DC power, some of which is converted to AC power by the nonlinearity of the device, amplifying the applied signal. Therefore, the output power is limited by the bias power&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|P_\text{AC}| \le I_\text{bias} V_\text{bias} \,&lt;/math&gt;
The negative differential resistance region cannot include the origin, because it would then be able to amplify a signal with no applied DC bias current, producing AC power with no power input.&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaplan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; The device also dissipates some power as heat, equal to the difference between the DC power in and the AC power out.

The reason that the output signal can leave a negative resistance through the same port that the input signal enters is that from [[transmission line]] theory, the AC voltage or current at the terminals of a component can be divided into two oppositely moving waves, the ''incident wave'' &lt;math&gt;V_I\,&lt;/math&gt;, which travels toward the device, and the ''reflected wave'' &lt;math&gt;V_R\,&lt;/math&gt;, which travels away from the device.&lt;ref name="Bowick"&gt;{{cite book

The "reflected" (output) signal has larger amplitude than the incident; the device has "reflection gain".&lt;ref name="Gilmore" /&gt; The reflection coefficient is determined by the AC impedance of the negative resistance device, &lt;math&gt;Z_N(j\omega)\,=\,R_N\,+\,jX_N&lt;/math&gt;, and the impedance of the circuit attached to it, &lt;math&gt;Z_L(j\omega)\,=\,R_L\,+\,jX_L&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt; If &lt;math&gt;R_N\,&lt;\,0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_L\,&gt;\,0\,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;|\Gamma|\,&gt;\,0\,&lt;/math&gt; and the device will amplify.

where &lt;math&gt;V_S&lt;/math&gt; is the DC bias supply voltage and R is the resistance of the supply. The possible DC operating point(s) ([[Q point]]s) occur where the DC load line intersects the ''I–V'' curve. For stability&lt;ref name="Krugman" /&gt;
*VCNRs require a low impedance bias {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;R\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;)}}, such as a [[voltage source]].
*CCNRs require a high impedance bias {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;R\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;)}} such as a [[current source]], or voltage source in series with a high resistance.
The AC load line (''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is a straight line through the Q point whose slope is the differential (AC) resistance &lt;math&gt;R_L\,&lt;/math&gt; facing the device. Increasing &lt;math&gt;R_L\,&lt;/math&gt; rotates the load line counterclockwise. The circuit operates in one of three possible regions ''(see diagrams)'', depending on &lt;math&gt;R_L\,&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt;
*'''&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;Stable region (green)&lt;/span&gt;''' (illustrated by line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;): When the load line lies in this region, it intersects the ''I–V'' curve at one point ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; For nonreactive circuits it is a [[stability theory|stable equilibrium]] ([[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s in the LHP) so the circuit is stable. Negative resistance [[amplifier]]s operate in this region. However, due to [[hysteresis]], with an energy storage device like a capacitor or inductor the circuit can become unstable to make a nonlinear [[relaxation oscillator]] ([[astable multivibrator]]) or a [[monostable multivibrator]].&lt;ref name="Gottlieb2"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e_oZ69GAuxAC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=%22negative+resistance Gottlieb 1997 ''Practical Oscillator Handbook'', pp. 105–108] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515053022/https://books.google.com/books?id=e_oZ69GAuxAC |date=2016-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**VCNRs are stable when &lt;math&gt;R_L\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;.

*'''Unstable point''' (Line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;): When &lt;math&gt;R_L\;=\;r&lt;/math&gt; the load line is tangent to the ''I–V'' curve. The total differential (AC) resistance of the circuit is zero (poles on the ''jω'' axis), so it is unstable and with a [[tuned circuit]] can oscillate. Linear [[electronic oscillator|oscillators]] operate at this point. Practical oscillators actually start in the unstable region below, with poles in the RHP, but as the amplitude increases the oscillations become nonlinear, and due to ''eventual passivity'' the negative resistance ''r'' decreases with increasing amplitude, so the oscillations stabilize at an amplitude where&lt;ref name="Nahin" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;r\;=\;R_L&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;Bistable region (red)&lt;/span&gt;''' (illustrated by line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;): In this region the load line can intersect the ''I–V'' curve at three points.&lt;ref name="Kumar" /&gt; The center point (''Q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is a point of [[unstable equilibrium]] (poles in the RHP), while the two outer points, ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are [[stable equilibria]]. So with correct biasing the circuit can be [[bistability|bistable]], it will converge to one of the two points ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and can be switched between them with an input pulse. Switching circuits like [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]]s ([[bistable multivibrator]]s) and [[Schmidt trigger]]s operate in this region.
**VCNRs can be bistable when &lt;math&gt;R_L\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;
**CCNRs can be bistable when &lt;math&gt;R_L\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;

These have negative differential resistance ''(&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; region)'' and produce power ''(grey region)''. Applying a large enough voltage or current of either polarity to the port moves the device into its nonlinear region where saturation of the amplifier causes the differential resistance to become positive ''('''black''' portion of curve)'', and above the supply voltage rails &lt;math&gt;\pm V_S\,&lt;/math&gt; the static resistance becomes positive and the device consumes power.

In circuit theory these are called "active resistors".&lt;ref name="Chua2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kouřil" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Popa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miano" /&gt; Applying a voltage across the terminals causes a proportional current ''out'' of the positive terminal, the opposite of an ordinary resistor.&lt;ref name="Crisson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HorowitzVideo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; For example, connecting a battery to the terminals would cause the battery to [[rechargeable battery|charge]] rather than discharge.&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt;

Considered as one-port devices, these circuits function similarly to the passive negative differential resistance components above, and like them can be used to make one-port amplifiers and oscillators&lt;ref name="Aluf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Suzuki" /&gt; with the advantages that:
*because they are active devices they do not require an external DC bias to provide power, and can be [[DC coupling|DC coupled]],

*they can be linear circuit elements;&lt;ref name="Groszkowski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deliyannis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dimopoulos" /&gt; if operation is confined to the straight segment of the curve near the origin the voltage is proportional to the current, so they do not cause [[harmonic distortion]].

:&lt;math&gt;v_o = v(R_1 + R_1)/R_1 = 2v \,&lt;/math&gt;
So if a voltage &lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt; is applied to the input, the same voltage is applied "backwards" across &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, causing current to flow through it out of the input.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; The current is
:&lt;math&gt;i = \frac {v - v_o}{Z} = \frac {v - 2v}{Z} = - \frac {v}{Z} \, &lt;/math&gt;
So the input impedance to the circuit is&lt;ref name="Muthuswamy" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_\text{in} = \frac {v}{i} = -Z \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
The circuit converts the impedance &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; to its negative. If &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is a resistor of value &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, within the linear range of the op amp &lt;math&gt;V_\text{S}/2\;&lt;\;v\;&lt;\;-V_\text{S}/2&lt;/math&gt; the input impedance acts like a linear "negative resistor" of value &lt;math&gt;-R&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; The input port of the circuit is connected into another circuit as if it was a component.

===Negative capacitance and inductance===
By replacing &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; in the above circuit with a capacitor {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;) or inductor (&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;)}}, negative capacitances and inductances can also be synthesized.&lt;ref name="Ghadiri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; A negative capacitance will have an ''I–V'' relation and an [[electrical impedance|impedance]] &lt;math&gt;Z_\text{C}(j\omega)&lt;/math&gt; of
:&lt;math&gt;i = -C {dv \over dt} \qquad\qquad Z_C = -1/j\omega C \,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;C\;&gt;\;0&lt;/math&gt;. Applying a positive current to a negative capacitance will cause it to ''discharge''; its voltage will ''decrease''. Similarly, a negative inductance will have an ''I–V'' characteristic and impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_\text{L}(j\omega)&lt;/math&gt; of
:&lt;math&gt;v = -L {di \over dt} \qquad\qquad Z_L = -j\omega L \,&lt;/math&gt;
A circuit having negative capacitance or inductance can be used to cancel unwanted positive capacitance or inductance in another circuit.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; NIC circuits were used to cancel reactance on telephone cables.

There is also another way of looking at them. In a negative capacitance the current will be 180° opposite in phase to the current in a positive capacitance. Instead of leading the voltage by 90° it will lag the voltage by 90°, as in an inductor.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; Therefore, a negative capacitance acts like an inductance in which the impedance has a reverse dependence on frequency ω; decreasing instead of increasing like a real inductance&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt; Similarly a negative inductance acts like a capacitance that has an impedance which increases with frequency. Negative capacitances and inductances are "non-Foster" circuits which violate [[Foster's reactance theorem]].&lt;ref name="Hansen"&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Negative resistance oscillator load lines.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Gunn diode oscillator [[load line (electronics)|load line]]s.&lt;br /&gt;
''DCL'': DC load line, which sets the Q point.&lt;br /&gt;
''SSL'': negative resistance during startup while amplitude is small. Since &lt;math&gt;r\;&lt;\;R&lt;/math&gt; poles are in RHP and amplitude of oscillations increases.&lt;br /&gt;
''LSL'': large-signal load line. When the current swing approaches the edges of the negative resistance region ''&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;(green)&lt;/span&gt;'', the sine wave peaks are distorted ("clipped") and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; decreases until it equals &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. ]]

The common [[Gunn diode]] oscillator ''(circuit diagrams)''&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; illustrates how negative resistance oscillators work. The diode ''D'' has voltage controlled ("N" type) negative resistance and the voltage source &lt;math&gt;V_\text{b}&lt;/math&gt; biases it into its negative resistance region where its differential resistance is &lt;math&gt;dv/di\;=\;-r&lt;/math&gt;. The [[choke (electronics)|choke]] ''RFC'' prevents AC current from flowing through the bias source.&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the equivalent resistance due to damping and losses in the series tuned circuit &lt;math&gt;LC&lt;/math&gt;, plus any load resistance. Analyzing the AC circuit with [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's Voltage Law]] gives a differential equation for &lt;math&gt;i(t)&lt;/math&gt;, the AC current&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d^2 i}{dt^2} + \frac {R - r}{L}\frac {di}{dt} + \frac {1}{LC}i = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
Solving this equation gives a solution of the form&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i(t) = i_0 e^{\alpha t} \cos(\omega t + \phi) \,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;where&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{r - R}{2L} \quad \omega = \sqrt{\frac {1}{LC} - \left(\frac {r - R}{2L}\right)^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;
This shows that the current through the circuit, &lt;math&gt;i(t)&lt;/math&gt;, varies with time about the DC [[Q point]], &lt;math&gt;I_\text{bias}&lt;/math&gt;. When started from a nonzero initial current &lt;math&gt;i(t)\;=\;i_0&lt;/math&gt; the current oscillates [[sinusoidal]]ly at the [[resonant frequency]] '''''ω''''' of the tuned circuit, with amplitude either constant, increasing, or decreasing [[exponential function|exponentially]], depending on the value of '''''α'''''. Whether the circuit can sustain steady oscillations depends on the balance between &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, the positive and negative resistance in the circuit:&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;
#[[File:Sinusoid decreasing Q=10.svg|left|80px]]&lt;math&gt;r &lt; R \Rightarrow \alpha &lt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;: ([[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s in left half plane) If the diode's negative resistance is less than the positive resistance of the tuned circuit, the damping is positive. Any oscillations in the circuit will lose energy as heat in the resistance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and die away exponentially to zero, as in an ordinary tuned circuit.&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; So the circuit does not oscillate.
#[[File:Sinusoid constant amplitude.svg|left|80px]]&lt;math&gt;r = R \Rightarrow \alpha = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;: (poles on '''''jω''''' axis) If the positive and negative resistances are equal, the net resistance is zero, so the damping is zero. The diode adds just enough energy to compensate for energy lost in the tuned circuit and load, so oscillations in the circuit, once started, will continue at a constant amplitude.&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; This is the condition during steady-state operation of the oscillator.
#[[File:Sinusoid increasing Q=10.svg|left|80px]]&lt;math&gt;r &gt; R \Rightarrow \alpha &gt; 0\,&lt;/math&gt;: (poles in right half plane) If the negative resistance is greater than the positive resistance, damping is negative, so oscillations will grow exponentially in energy and amplitude.&lt;ref name="Solymar" /&gt; This is the condition during startup.

Practical oscillators are designed in region (3) above, with net negative resistance, to get oscillations started.&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt; A widely used rule of thumb is to make &lt;math&gt;R\;=\;r/3&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Gilmore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kung2"&gt;{{cite web

}}, Sec. 3 Negative Resistance Oscillators, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; When the power is turned on, [[electrical noise]] in the circuit provides a signal &lt;math&gt;i_0&lt;/math&gt; to start spontaneous oscillations, which grow exponentially. However, the oscillations cannot grow forever; the nonlinearity of the diode eventually limits the amplitude.

At large amplitudes the circuit is nonlinear, so the linear analysis above does not strictly apply and differential resistance is undefined; but the circuit can be understood by considering &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; to be the "average" resistance over the cycle. As the amplitude of the sine wave exceeds the width of the negative resistance region and the voltage swing extends into regions of the curve with positive differential resistance, the average negative differential resistance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; becomes smaller, and thus the total resistance &lt;math&gt;R\;-\;r&lt;/math&gt; and the damping &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; becomes less negative and eventually turns positive. Therefore, the oscillations will stabilize at the amplitude at which the damping becomes zero, which is when &lt;math&gt;r\;=\;R&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Lesurf" /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In oscillators where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is close to &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;; just small enough to allow the oscillator to start, the voltage swing will be mostly limited to the linear portion of the ''I–V'' curve, the output waveform will be nearly sinusoidal and the frequency will be most stable. In circuits in which &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is far below &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, the swing extends further into the nonlinear part of the curve, the clipping distortion of the output sine wave is more severe,&lt;ref name="Kung2" /&gt; and the frequency will be increasingly dependent on the supply voltage.

===Types of circuit===
Negative resistance oscillator circuits can be divided into two types, which are used with the two types of negative differential resistance – voltage controlled (VCNR), and current controlled (CCNR)&lt;ref name="Rhea"&gt;{{cite book

The resonant circuit has high impedance only at its resonant frequency, so the circuit will be unstable and oscillate only at that frequency.

===Conditions for oscillation===
Most oscillators are more complicated than the Gunn diode example, since both the active device and the load may have reactance (''X'') as well as resistance (''R''). Modern negative resistance oscillators are designed by a [[frequency domain]] technique due to K. Kurokawa.&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kurokawa"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[complex impedance]] of the negative resistance part &lt;math&gt;Z_N = R_N(I, \omega) + jX_N(I, \omega) \,&lt;/math&gt; depends on frequency ''ω'' but is also nonlinear, in general declining with the amplitude of the AC oscillation current ''I''; while the resonator part &lt;math&gt;Z_L = R_L(\omega) + jX_L(\omega) \,&lt;/math&gt; is linear, depending only on frequency.&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Räisänen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohde" /&gt; The circuit equation is &lt;math&gt;(Z_N + Z_L)I = 0\,&lt;/math&gt; so it will only oscillate (have nonzero ''I'') at the frequency ''ω'' and amplitude ''I'' for which the total impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_N + Z_L \,&lt;/math&gt; is zero.&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt; This means the magnitude of the negative and positive resistances must be equal, and the reactances must be [[complex conjugate|conjugate]]&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Räisänen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohde" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R_N \le -R_L\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;X_N = -X_L \,&lt;/math&gt;
For steady-state oscillation the equal sign applies. During startup the inequality applies, because the circuit must have excess negative resistance for oscillations to start.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt;

Alternately, the condition for oscillation can be expressed using the [[reflection coefficient]].&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt; The voltage waveform at the reference plane can be divided into a component ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; travelling toward the negative resistance device and a component ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; travelling in the opposite direction, toward the resonator part. The reflection coefficient of the active device &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_N = V_2/V_1 \,&lt;/math&gt; is greater than one, while that of the resonator part &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_L = V_1/V_2 \,&lt;/math&gt; is less than one. During operation the waves are reflected back and forth in a round trip so the circuit will oscillate only if&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Räisänen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohde" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|\Gamma_N \Gamma_L| \ge 1 \,&lt;/math&gt;
As above, the equality gives the condition for steady oscillation, while the inequality is required during startup to provide excess negative resistance. The above conditions are analogous to the [[Barkhausen stability criterion|Barkhausen criterion]] for feedback oscillators; they are necessary but not sufficient,&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt; so there are some circuits that satisfy the equations but do not oscillate. Kurokawa also derived more complicated sufficient conditions,&lt;ref name="Kurokawa" /&gt; which are often used instead.&lt;ref name="Maas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellinger" /&gt;

==Amplifiers==
Negative differential resistance devices such as Gunn and IMPATT diodes are also used to make [[amplifier]]s, particularly at microwave frequencies, but not as commonly as oscillators.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt; Because negative resistance devices have only one ''port'' (two terminals), unlike [[two-port network|two-port]] devices such as [[transistor]]s, the outgoing amplified signal has to leave the device by the same terminals as the incoming signal enters it.&lt;ref name="Iniewski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt; Without some way of separating the two signals, a negative resistance amplifier is ''bilateral''; it amplifies in both directions, so it suffers from sensitivity to load impedance and feedback problems.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt; To separate the input and output signals, many negative resistance amplifiers use [[reciprocity (electromagnetism)|nonreciprocal]] devices such as [[isolator (microwave)|isolator]]s and [[directional coupler]]s.&lt;ref name="Golio2" /&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A circulator is a [[reciprocity (electromagnetism)|nonreciprocal]] [[solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] component with three [[two port|ports]] (connectors) which transfers a signal applied to one port to the next in only one direction, port 1 to port 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 1. In the reflection amplifier diagram the input signal is applied to port 1, a biased VCNR negative resistance diode ''N'' is attached through a filter ''F'' to port 2, and the output circuit is attached to port 3. The input signal is passed from port 1 to the diode at port 2, but the outgoing "reflected" amplified signal from the diode is routed to port 3, so there is little coupling from output to input. The characteristic impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_0&lt;/math&gt; of the input and output [[transmission line]]s, usually 50Ω, is matched to the port impedance of the circulator. The purpose of the filter ''F'' is to present the correct impedance to the diode to set the gain. At radio frequencies NR diodes are not pure resistive loads and have reactance, so a second purpose of the filter is to cancel the diode reactance with a conjugate reactance to prevent standing waves.&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linkhart" /&gt;

The filter has only reactive components and so does not absorb any power itself, so power is passed between the diode and the ports without loss. The input signal power to the diode is
:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{in} = V_I^2 / R_1\,&lt;/math&gt;
The output power from the diode is
:&lt;math&gt;P_\text{out} = V_R^2 / R_1\,&lt;/math&gt;
So the [[power gain]] &lt;math&gt;G_P&lt;/math&gt; of the amplifier is the square of the reflection coefficient&lt;ref name="Das" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linkhart"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;math&gt;R_\text{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the negative resistance of the diode '''''−r'''''. Assuming the filter is matched to the diode so &lt;math&gt;X_1\;=\;-X_N&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt; then the gain is
:&lt;math&gt;G_\text{P} = |\Gamma|^2 = {(r + R_1)^2 + 4X_N^2 \over (r - R_1)^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;
The VCNR reflection amplifier above is stable for &lt;math&gt;R_1\;&lt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt; while a CCNR amplifier is stable for &lt;math&gt;R_1\;&gt;\;r&lt;/math&gt;. It can be seen that the reflection amplifier can have unlimited gain, approaching infinity as &lt;math&gt;R_\text{1}&lt;/math&gt; approaches the point of oscillation at &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Button" /&gt; This is a characteristic of all NR amplifiers,&lt;ref name="Willardson" /&gt; contrasting with the behavior of two-port amplifiers, which generally have limited gain but are often unconditionally stable. In practice the gain is limited by the backward "leakage" coupling between circulator ports.

[[Maser]]s and [[parametric amplifier]]s are extremely low noise NR amplifiers that are also implemented as reflection amplifiers; they are used in applications like [[radio telescope]]s.&lt;ref name="Linkhart" /&gt;

==Switching circuits==
Negative differential resistance devices are also used in [[switching circuit]]s in which the device operates nonlinearly, changing abruptly from one state to another, with [[hysteresis]].&lt;ref name="Kumar2" /&gt; The advantage of using a negative resistance device is that a [[relaxation oscillator]], [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]] or memory cell can be built with a single active device,&lt;ref name="Abraham" /&gt; whereas the standard logic circuit for these functions, the [[multivibrator|Eccles-Jordan multivibrator]], requires two active devices (transistors). Three switching circuits built with negative resistances are
*''[[Astable multivibrator]]'' – a circuit with two unstable states, in which the output periodically switches back and forth between the states. The time it remains in each state is determined by the time constant of an RC circuit. Therefore, it is a [[relaxation oscillator]], and can produce [[square wave]]s or [[triangle wave]]s.
*''[[Monostable multivibrator]]'' – is a circuit with one unstable state and one stable state. When in its stable state a pulse is applied to the input, the output switches to its other state and remains in it for a period of time dependent on the time constant of the RC circuit, then switches back to the stable state. Thus the monostable can be used as a timer or delay element.
*''[[Bistable multivibrator]]'' or ''[[flip-flop (electronics)|flip flop]]'' – is a circuit with two stable states. A pulse at the input switches the circuit to its other state. Therefore, bistables can be used as memory circuits, and [[digital counter]]s.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps the first example of an electronic oscillator. [[William Duddell]], a student of Ayrton at London Central Technical College, brought Thomson's arc oscillator to public attention.&lt;ref name="Nahin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hong" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gethemann" /&gt; Due to its negative resistance, the current through an arc was unstable, and [[arc lamp|arc lights]] would often produce hissing, humming, or even howling noises. In 1899, investigating this effect, Duddell connected an [[LC circuit]] across an arc and the negative resistance excited oscillations in the tuned circuit, producing a musical tone from the arc.&lt;ref name="Nahin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hong" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gethemann" /&gt; To demonstrate his invention Duddell wired several tuned circuits to an arc and played a tune on it.&lt;ref name="Hong" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gethemann" /&gt; Duddell's "[[William Duddell|singing arc]]" oscillator was limited to audio frequencies.&lt;ref name="Nahin" /&gt; However, in 1903 Danish engineers [[Valdemar Poulsen]] and P. O. Pederson increased the frequency into the radio range by operating the arc in a hydrogen atmosphere in a magnetic field,&lt;ref name="Poulsen"&gt;{{cite conference |first=Valdemar |last=Poulsen |title=System for producing continuous electric oscillations |booktitle=Transactions of the International Electrical Congress, St. Louis, 1904, Vol. 2 |pages=963–971 |publisher=J.

===Vacuum tubes===
By the early 20th century, although the physical causes of negative resistance were not understood, engineers knew it could generate oscillations and had begun to apply it.&lt;ref name="Hong" /&gt; [[Heinrich Barkhausen]] in 1907 showed that oscillators must have negative resistance.&lt;ref name="Duncan" /&gt; Ernst Ruhmer and Adolf Pieper discovered that [[mercury vapor lamp]]s could produce oscillations, and by 1912 AT&amp;T had used them to build amplifying [[repeater]]s for [[telephone line]]s.&lt;ref name="Hong" /&gt;

In 1918 Albert Hull at [[General Electric|GE]] discovered that [[vacuum tube]]s could have negative resistance in parts of their operating ranges, due to a phenomenon called [[secondary emission]].&lt;ref name="Gottlieb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hull"&gt;{{cite journal

This represents a current ''away'' from the plate, reducing the plate current.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb" /&gt; Under certain conditions increasing the plate voltage causes a ''decrease'' in plate current. By connecting an LC circuit to the tube Hull created an oscillator, the [[dynatron oscillator]]. Other negative resistance tube oscillators followed, such as the [[magnetron]] invented by Hull in 1920.&lt;ref name="Gilmour" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12822">'''Negative thermal expansion''' (NTE) is an unusual [[physical chemistry|physicochemical]] process in which some materials contract upon heating, rather than expand as most other materials do. Materials which undergo NTE have a range of potential [[engineering]], [[photonics|photonic]], [[Electronics|electronic]], and [[structural]] applications. For example, if one were to mix a '''negative thermal expansion''' material with a "normal" material which expands on heating, it could be possible to make a zero expansion [[composite material]].

== Origin of negative thermal expansion ==

There are a number of physical processes which may cause contraction with increasing temperature, including transverse vibrational modes, [[Rigid Unit Modes]] and [[phase transitions]].

Recently, Liu et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.scriptamat.2011.07.001|title=Origin of negative thermal expansion phenomenon in solids|year=2011|last1=Liu|first1=Zi-Kui|last2=Wang|first2=Yi|last3=Shang|first3=Shun-Li|journal=Scripta Materialia|volume=65|issue=8|pages=664–667}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the NTE phenomenon originates from the existence of high pressure, small volume configurations with higher entropy, with their configurations present in the stable phase matrix through thermal fluctuations. They were able to predict both the colossal positive thermal expansion (In cerium) and zero and infinite negative thermal expansion (in {{chem|Fe|3|Pt}}) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/srep07043|pmid=25391631|pmc=4229665|title=Thermal Expansion Anomaly Regulated by Entropy|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=4|pages=7043|year=2014|last1=Liu|first1=Zi-Kui|last2=Wang|first2=Yi|last3=Shang|first3=Shunli|bibcode=2014NatSR...4E7043L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Negative thermal expansion in close-packed systems ==

Negative thermal expansion is usually observed in non-close-packed systems with directional interactions (e.g. [[ice]], [[graphene]], etc.) and complex compounds (e.g. {{Chem|Cu|2|O}}, {{Chem|Zr|W|2|O|8}}, beta-quartz, some zeolites, etc.). However, in a paper,&lt;ref name=Rechtsman&gt;{{Citation

The following sufficient condition for potential giving rise to NTE behavior is proposed:

&lt;math&gt;
    \Pi'''(a) &gt;  0,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \Pi &lt;/math&gt; is pair [[interatomic potential]], &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; is the equilibrium distance. This condition is (i) necessary and sufficient in 1D and (ii) sufficient, but not necessary in 2D and 3D. ''An approximate'' necessary and sufficient condition is derived in a paper&lt;ref name=Kuzkin&gt;{{Citation

    \Pi'''(a)a &gt; -(d-1)\Pi''(a),
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; d &lt;/math&gt; is the space dimensionality. Thus in 2D and 3D negative thermal expansion in close-packed systems with pair interactions is realized even when the third derivative of the potential is zero or even negative. Note that one-dimensional and multidimensional cases are qualitatively different. In 1D thermal expansion is cased by anharmonicity of [[interatomic potential]] only. Therefore, the sign of thermal expansion coefficient is determined by the sign of the third derivative of the potential. In multidimensional case the geometrical nonlinearity is also present, i.e. lattice vibrations are nonlinear even in the case of harmonic interatomic potential. This nonlinearity contributes to thermal expansion. Therefore, in multidimensional case both &lt;math&gt;\Pi''&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi'''&lt;/math&gt; are present in the condition for negative thermal expansion.

== Applications ==

There are many potential applications for materials with controlled thermal expansion properties, as thermal expansion causes many problems in engineering, and indeed in everyday life. One simple example of a thermal expansion problem is the tendency of [[dental fillings]] to expand by an amount different from the [[teeth]], for example when drinking a hot drink, causing [[toothache]]. If dental fillings were made of a [[composite material]] containing a mixture of materials with positive and negative thermal expansion then the overall expansion could be precisely tailored to that of [[tooth enamel]].

== Materials ==

Perhaps one of the most studied materials to exhibit ''negative thermal expansion'' is '''[[zirconium tungstate]]''' ({{Chem|Zr|W|2|O|8}}). This compound contracts continuously over a temperature range of 0.3 to 1050 K (at higher temperatures the material decomposes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Negative Thermal Expansion from 0.3 to 1050 Kelvin in {{Chem|Zr|W|2|O|8}}|journal=Science|year=1996|volume=272|issue=5258|pages=90–92|doi= 10.1126/science.272.5258.90|bibcode = 1996Sci...272...90M|last1=Mary|first1=T.

Ordinary ice shows NTE in its hexagonal and cubic phases at very low temperatures (below –200&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name=ice_NTE&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1107/S0108768194004933|title=Lattice constants and thermal expansion of {{Chem|H|2|O}} and {{Chem|D|2|O}} ice Ih between 10 and 265 K|journal=Acta Crystallographica Section B|year=1994|volume= 50|pages=644–648|issue=6|last1=Röttger|first1=K.|last2=Endriss|first2=A.|last3=Ihringer|first3=J.|last4=Doyle|first4=S.|last5=Kuhs|first5=W. F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its liquid form, pure [[water]] also displays negative thermal expansivity below 3.984&amp;nbsp;°C.

[[Rubber elasticity]] shows NTE at normal temperatures, but the reason for the effect is rather different from that in most other materials. Put simply, as the long polymer chains absorb energy, they adopt a more contorted configuration, reducing the volume of the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkeleyphysicsdemos.net/node/344 |title=Heating a rubber band: negative coefficient of thermal expansion &amp;#124; Lecture Demonstrations |publisher=Berkeleyphysicsdemos.net |date= |accessdate=2015-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cubic [[Scandium trifluoride]] has this property which is explained by the quartic oscillation of the fluoride ions. The energy stored in the bending strain of the fluoride ion is proportional to the fourth power of the displacement angle, unlike most other materials where it is proportional to the square of the displacement. A fluorine atom is bound to two scandium atoms, and as temperature increases the fluorine oscillates more perpendicularly to its bonds. This draws the scandium atoms together throughout the material and it contracts.&lt;ref name="woo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-11-incredible-material-reveal-scandium-trifluoride.html|title=An incredible shrinking material: Engineers reveal how scandium trifluoride contracts with heat|last=Woo|first=Marcus|date=7 November 2011|publisher=Physorg|accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{chem|Sc|F|3}} exhibits this property from 10 to 1100 K above which it shows the normal positive thermal expansion.&lt;ref name="greve"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greve|first=Benjamin K.|author2=Kenneth L.

The '''one-electron universe''' postulate, proposed by [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]] in a telephone call to [[Richard Feynman]] in the spring of 1940, hypothesises that all [[electron]]s and [[positron]]s are actually manifestations of a single entity moving backwards and forwards in time. According to Feynman:

{{cquote|I received a telephone call one day at the graduate college at Princeton from Professor Wheeler, in which he said, "Feynman, I know why all electrons have the same charge and the same mass" "Why?" "Because, they are all the same electron!"&lt;ref name=Feynman1965&gt;{{cite web|url=
http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/feynman-lecture.html | title= Nobel Lecture |date= 11 December 1965 | publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]|author=Richard Feynman}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Overview==
The idea is based on the [[world line]]s traced out across [[spacetime]] by every electron. Rather than have myriad such lines, Wheeler suggested that they could all be parts of one single line like a huge tangled knot, traced out by the one electron. Any given moment in time is represented by a slice across spacetime, and would meet the knotted line a great many times. Each such meeting point represents a real electron at that moment.

At those points, half the lines will be directed forward in time and half will have looped round and be directed backwards. Wheeler suggested that these backwards sections appeared as the [[antiparticle]] to the electron, the positron.

Many more electrons have been observed than positrons, and electrons are thought to comfortably outnumber them. According to Feynman he raised this issue with Wheeler, who speculated that the missing positrons might be hidden within [[proton]]s.&lt;ref name=Feynman1965/&gt;

Feynman was struck by Wheeler's insight that antiparticles could be represented by reversed world lines, and credits this to Wheeler, saying in his Nobel speech:

{{cquote|I did not take the idea that all the electrons were the same one from [Wheeler] as seriously as I took the observation that positrons could simply be represented as electrons going from the future to the past in a back section of their world lines. That, I stole!&lt;ref name=Feynman1965/&gt;}}

Feynman later proposed this interpretation of the [[positron]] as an electron moving backward in time in his 1949 paper "The Theory of Positrons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Feynman |first=Richard |title=The Theory of Positrons |journal=Physical Review |issue=6 |date=1949 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.76.749 |volume=76 |pages=749–759|bibcode = 1949PhRv...76..749F }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Yoichiro Nambu]] later applied it to all production and [[annihilation]] of particle-antiparticle pairs, stating that "the eventual creation and annihilation of pairs that may occur now and then is no creation or annihilation, but only a change of direction of moving particles, from past to future, or from future to past."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nambu |first=Yoichiro |title=The Use of the Proper Time in Quantum Electrodynamics I |journal=Progress in Theoretical Physics |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=82–94 |date=1950|bibcode=1950PThPh...5...82N |doi=10.1143/PTP.5.82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>Corrected reference to Talbot’s paper negative process. The waxed paper process was invented by French photographer Gustave le Gray and introduced in 1851.</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2621">The '''paper negative''' process consists of using a [[Negative (photography)|negative]] printed on [[paper]] (either photographically or digitally) to create the final print of a [[photograph]], as opposed to using a modern negative on a [[film base]] of [[cellulose acetate]].  The plastic acetate negative (which is what modern films produce) enables the printing of a very sharp image intended to be as close a representation of the actual subject as is possible.  By using a negative based on paper instead, there is the possibility of creating a more ethereal image, simply by using a paper with a very visible grain, or by drawing on the paper or distressing it in some way.  

One of the original forms of [[photography]] was based on the paper negative process. William Henry Fox Talbot's paper negative process, which was used to create his work "[[The Pencil of Nature]]", used a negative created on paper treated with [[silver]] salts, which was exposed in a [[camera obscura]] to create the negative and then contact printed on a similar paper to produce a [[Positive (photography)|positive]] image.      

When Talbot created this process it was intended to be a way to reproduce nature as accurately as possible (hence the name of his work, "The Pencil of Nature"). Through the years afterwards, however, better and more accurate ways of producing exact replicas of nature were developed, and these processes relegated the paper negative process to obsolescence.  

The process of the paper negative is still relevant, though, in the realm of alternative-process photography.  Photographers employing alternative processes reject the idea of the exact replica of nature and seek to use the inherent inexactness of antiquated processes to create a more personal and emotional image.  The paper negative is an extremely versatile process that allows all manner of reworking and retouching of an image, and is the perfect medium to bridge the gap between [[camera operator]] and [[artist]].

The most common monisms in the 20th and 21st centuries have all been variations of physicalism; these positions include [[behaviorism]], the [[type physicalism|type identity theory]], [[anomalous monism]] and [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]].&lt;ref name="Kim"&gt;Kim, J., "Mind–Body Problem", ''Oxford Companion to Philosophy''.

==Mind–body problem==
{{Main|Mind–body problem}}
The mind–body problem concerns the explanation of the relationship that exists between [[mind]]s, or [[mental processes]], and bodily states or processes.&lt;ref name="Kim1"&gt;{{cite book

 }} &lt;!--Kim, J., "Problems in the Philosophy of Mind". ''Oxford Companion to Philosophy''. Ted Honderich (ed.) Oxford:Oxford University Press. 1995.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The main aim of philosophers working in this area is to determine the nature of the mind and mental states/processes, and how—or even if—minds are affected by and can affect the body.

Our perceptual experiences depend on [[stimulation|stimuli]] that arrive at our various [[Sensory system|sensory organs]] from the external world, and these stimuli cause changes in our mental states, ultimately causing us to feel a sensation, which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Someone's desire for a slice of pizza, for example, will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain what he or she wants. The question, then, is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties.&lt;ref name="Kim" /&gt;

A related problem is how someone's [[propositional attitude]]s (e.g. beliefs and desires) cause that individual's [[neuron]]s to fire and muscles to contract. These comprise some of the puzzles that have confronted [[Epistemology|epistemologists]] and philosophers of mind from at least the time of [[René Descartes]].&lt;ref name="De" /&gt;

==Dualist solutions to the mind–body problem==
[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Dualism]] is a set of views about the relationship between [[mind]] and [[matter]] (or [[Human body|body]]). It begins with the claim that mental [[phenomenon|phenomena]] are, in some respects, non-[[nature|physical]].&lt;ref name="Du" /&gt; One of the earliest known formulations of mind–body dualism was expressed in the eastern [[Sankhya]] and [[Yoga]] schools of [[Hindu philosophy]] (c. 650 BCE), which divided the world into [[purusha]] (mind/spirit) and [[prakriti]] (material substance).&lt;ref name="Sa" /&gt; Specifically, the [[Yoga Sutra]] of [[Patanjali]] presents an analytical approach to the nature of the mind.

In [[Western Philosophy]], the earliest discussions of dualist ideas are in the writings of [[Plato]] who maintained that humans' "intelligence" (a faculty of the mind or soul) could not be identified with, or explained in terms of, their physical body.&lt;ref name="Plato" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rob"&gt;Robinson, H. (1983): "Aristotelian dualism", Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy 1, 123–44.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the best-known version of dualism is due to [[René Descartes]] (1641), and holds that the mind is a non-extended, non-physical substance, a "[[mental substance|res cogitans]]".&lt;ref name="De" /&gt; Descartes was the first to clearly identify the mind with [[consciousness]] and [[self-awareness]], and to distinguish this from the brain, which was the seat of intelligence. He was therefore the first to formulate the mind–body problem in the form in which it still exists today.&lt;ref name="De" /&gt;

===Arguments for dualism===
The most frequently used argument in favor of dualism appeals to the common-sense intuition that conscious experience is distinct from inanimate matter. If asked what the mind is, the average person would usually respond by identifying it with their [[self (psychology)|self]], their personality, their [[soul]], or some other such entity. They would almost certainly deny that the mind simply is the brain, or vice versa, finding the idea that there is just one [[ontology|ontological]] entity at play to be too mechanistic, or simply unintelligible.&lt;ref name="Du" /&gt; Many modern philosophers of mind think that these intuitions are misleading and that we should use our critical faculties, along with [[empirical evidence]] from the sciences, to examine these assumptions to determine whether there is any real basis to them.&lt;ref name="Du" /&gt;

Another important argument in favor of dualism is that the mental and the physical seem to have quite different, and perhaps irreconcilable, properties.&lt;ref name="Ja"&gt;Jackson, F. (1982) "Epiphenomenal Qualia." Reprinted in Chalmers, David ed. :2002. ''Philosophy of Mind: Classical and Contemporary Readings''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Mental events have a subjective quality, whereas physical events do not. So, for example, one can reasonably ask what a burnt finger feels like, or what a blue sky looks like, or what nice music sounds like to a person. But it is meaningless, or at least odd, to ask what a surge in the uptake of [[glutamate]] in the dorsolateral portion of the [[prefrontal cortex]] feels like.

Philosophers of mind call the subjective aspects of mental events "[[qualia]]" or "raw feels".&lt;ref name="Ja" /&gt; There is something that it is like to feel pain, to see a familiar shade of blue, and so on. There are qualia involved in these mental events that seem particularly difficult to reduce to anything physical. David Chalmers explains this argument by stating that we could conceivably know all the objective information about something, such as the brain states and wavelengths of light involved with seeing the color red, but still not know something fundamental about the situation – what it is like to see the color red.&lt;ref name="Nagel"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Nagel, T. | title=What is it like to be a bat? | journal=Philosophical Review | issue=83 | pages=435–456 |year=1974|url=http://www.esalq.usp.br/lepse/imgs/conteudo_thumb/What-Is-It-Like-to-Be-a-Bat-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If consciousness (the mind) can exist independently of physical reality (the brain), one must explain how physical memories are created concerning consciousness. Dualism must therefore explain how consciousness affects physical reality. One possible explanation is that of a miracle, proposed by [[Arnold Geulincx]] and [[Nicolas Malebranche]], where all mind–body interactions require the direct intervention of God.

Another possible argument that has been proposed by [[C. S. Lewis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Lewis, C.S | title=Miracles | year=1947 | isbn=978-0-688-17369-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[Argument from Reason]]: if, as monism implies, all of our thoughts are the effects of physical causes, then we have no reason for assuming that they are also the [[consequent]] of a reasonable ground. Knowledge, however, is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent. Therefore, if monism is correct, there would be no way of knowing this—or anything else—we could not even suppose it, except by a fluke.

The [[p-zombie|zombie argument]] is based on a [[thought experiment]] proposed by Todd Moody, and developed by [[David Chalmers]] in his book ''[[The Conscious Mind]]''. The basic idea is that one can imagine one's body, and therefore conceive the existence of one's body, without any conscious states being associated with this body. Chalmers' argument is that it seems possible that such a being could exist because all that is needed is that all and only the things that the physical sciences describe about a zombie must be true of it. Since none of the concepts involved in these sciences make reference to consciousness or other mental phenomena, and any physical entity can be by definition described scientifically via [[physics]], the move from conceivability to possibility is not such a large one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Chalmers, David | title=The Conscious Mind | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1997 | isbn=978-0-19-511789-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as Dennett have [[Philosophical zombie#Criticism|argued]] that the notion of a philosophical zombie is an incoherent,&lt;ref name="Dennett, Daniel 1995 322–6"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dennett, Daniel |title=The unimagined preposterousness of zombies |year=1995 |journal=J Consciousness Studies |volume=2 |pages=322–6 |url=http://pp.kpnet.fi/seirioa/cdenn/unzombie.htm |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170515115656/http://pp.kpnet.fi/seirioa/cdenn/unzombie.htm |archivedate=2017-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or unlikely,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Dennett, Daniel | title=Consciousness Explained | publisher=Little, Brown and Co. | year=1991 | page=95 | isbn=978-0-316-18065-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; concept. It has been argued under physicalism that one must either believe that anyone including oneself might be a zombie, or that no one can be a zombie—following from the assertion that one's own conviction about being (or not being) a zombie is a product of the physical world and is therefore no different from anyone else's. This argument has been expressed by Dennett who argues that "Zombies think they are conscious, think they have qualia, think they suffer pains—they are just 'wrong' (according to this lamentable tradition) in ways that neither they nor we could ever discover!"&lt;ref name="Dennett, Daniel 1995 322–6"/&gt;

===Interactionist dualism===
[[File:Frans Hals - Portret van René Descartes.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[René Descartes]] by [[Frans Hals]] (1648)]]
Interactionist dualism, or simply interactionism, is the particular form of dualism first espoused by Descartes in the ''Meditations''.&lt;ref name="De" /&gt; In the 20th century, its major defenders have been [[Karl Popper]] and [[John Carew Eccles]].&lt;ref name="PopE"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Popper, Karl  |author2=Eccles, John  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=The Self and Its Brain | publisher=Springer Verlag | year=2002 | isbn=978-3-492-21096-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the view that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, causally interact with physical states.&lt;ref name="Du" /&gt;

Descartes' famous argument for this position can be summarized as follows: Seth has a clear and distinct idea of his mind as a thinking thing that has no spatial extension (i.e., it cannot be measured in terms of length, weight, height, and so on). He also has a clear and distinct idea of his body as something that is spatially extended, subject to quantification and not able to think. It follows that mind and body are not identical because they have radically different properties.&lt;ref name="De" /&gt;

At the same time, however, it is clear that Seth's mental states (desires, beliefs, etc.) have [[causality|causal]] effects on his body and vice versa: A child touches a hot stove (physical event) which causes pain (mental event) and makes her yell (physical event), this in turn provokes a sense of fear and protectiveness in the caregiver (mental event), and so on.

Descartes' argument crucially depends on the premise that what Seth believes to be "clear and distinct" ideas in his mind are [[logical truth|necessarily true]]. Many contemporary philosophers doubt this.&lt;ref name="CE"&gt;Dennett D., (1991), ''Consciousness Explained'', Boston: Little, Brown &amp; Company&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SS"&gt;Stich, S., (1983), ''From Folk Psychology to Cognitive Science''. Cambridge, MA: [[MIT Press]] (Bradford)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryle, G., 1949, The Concept of Mind, New York: Barnes and Noble&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Joseph Agassi]] suggests that several scientific discoveries made since the early 20th century have undermined the idea of privileged access to one's own ideas. [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] claimed that a psychologically-trained observer can understand a person's unconscious motivations better than the person himself does. [[Pierre Duhem|Duhem]] has shown that a philosopher of science can know a person's methods of discovery better than that person herself does, while [[Bronisław Malinowski|Malinowski]] has shown that an anthropologist can know a person's customs and habits better than the person whose customs and habits they are. He also asserts that modern psychological experiments that cause people to see things that are not there provide grounds for rejecting Descartes' argument, because scientists can describe a person's perceptions better than the person herself can.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Agassi, J. | title=Privileged Access; ''Science in Flux, Boston Stidues in the Philosophy of Science'', 80| publisher=Reidel| location=Dordrecht| year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Agassi, J. | title=La Scienza in Divenire | publisher=Armando | location=Rome | year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other forms of dualism===
[[File:DualismCausationViews3.svg|400px|thumb|Four varieties of dualism. The arrows indicate the direction of the causal interactions. Occasionalism is not shown.]]

====Psychophysical parallelism====
[[Psychophysical parallelism]], or simply '''parallelism''', is the view that mind and body, while having distinct ontological statuses, do not causally influence one another. Instead, they run along parallel paths (mind events causally interact with mind events and brain events causally interact with brain events) and only seem to influence each other.&lt;ref name="DuSEP"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was most prominently defended by [[Gottfried Leibniz]]. Although Leibniz was an ontological monist who believed that only one type of substance, the [[Monad (Greek philosophy)|monad]], exists in the universe, and that everything is reducible to it, he nonetheless maintained that there was an important distinction between "the mental" and "the physical" in terms of causation. He held that God had arranged things in advance so that minds and bodies would be in harmony with each other. This is known as the doctrine of [[pre-established harmony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Leibniz | first=Gottfried Wilhelm | title=Monadology | year=1714 | isbn=978-0-87548-030-5| title-link=Monadology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Occasionalism====
[[Occasionalism]] is the view espoused by [[Nicholas Malebranche]] as well as Islamic philosophers  such as [[Al-Ghazali|Abu Hamid Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Ghazali]] that asserts that all supposedly causal relations between physical events, or between physical and mental events, are not really causal at all. While body and mind are different substances, causes (whether mental or physical) are related to their effects by an act of God's intervention on each specific occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Property dualism====
[[Property dualism]] is the view that the world is constituted of just one kind of [[substance theory|substance]] – the physical kind – and there exist two distinct kinds of properties: [[physical properties]] and [[mental properties]]. In other words, it is the view that non-physical, mental properties (such as beliefs, desires and emotions) inhere in some physical bodies (at least, brains). How mental and physical properties relate causally depends on the variety of property dualism in question, and is not always a clear issue. Sub-varieties of property dualism include:

#[[Emergent materialism]] asserts that when matter is organized in the appropriate way (i.e. in the way that living human bodies are organized), mental properties emerge  in a way not fully accountable for by physical laws.&lt;ref name="Du" /&gt; These emergent properties have an independent ontological status and cannot be reduced to, or explained in terms of, the physical substrate from which they emerge. They are dependent on the physical properties from which they emerge, but opinions vary as to the coherence of [[top–down causation]], i.e. the causal effectiveness of such properties. A form of emergent materialism has been espoused by [[David Chalmers]] and the concept has undergone something of a renaissance in recent years,&lt;ref name="Chalmers"&gt;{{cite book | last=Chalmers |first=David | authorlink=David Chalmers | title=The Conscious Mind | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1996 | isbn = 978-0-19-511789-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was already suggested in the 19th century by [[William James]].
#[[Epiphenomenalism]] is a doctrine first formulated by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]].&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, T. H. [1874] "On the Hypothesis that Animals are Automata, and its History", ''The Fortnightly Review'', n.s.16:555–580. Reprinted in ''Method and Results: Essays by Thomas H. Huxley'' (New York: D. Appleton and Company, 1898).&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of the view that mental phenomena are causally ineffectual, where one or more mental states do not have any influence on physical states or mental phenomena are the effects, but not the causes, of physical phenomena. Physical events can cause other physical events and physical events can cause mental events, but mental events cannot cause anything, since they are just causally inert by-products (i.e. epiphenomena) of the physical world.&lt;ref name="DuSEP" /&gt; This view has been defended most strongly in recent times by [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Jackson, Frank | title=What Mary didn't know | journal=Journal of Philosophy | year=1986 |pages=291–295}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Property dualism#Non-reductive Physicalism|Non-reductive physicalism]] is the view that mental properties form a separate ontological class to physical properties: mental states (such as qualia) are not reducible to physical states. The ontological stance towards qualia in the case of non-reductive physicalism does not imply that qualia are causally inert; this is what distinguishes it from epiphenomenalism.
#[[Panpsychism]] is the view that all matter has a mental aspect, or, alternatively, all objects have a unified center of experience or point of view. Superficially, it seems to be a form of property dualism, since it regards everything as having both mental and physical properties. However, some panpsychists say that mechanical behaviour is derived from the primitive mentality of atoms and molecules—as are sophisticated mentality and organic behaviour, the difference being attributed to the presence or absence of [[complexity|complex]] structure in a compound object. So long as the ''reduction'' of non-mental properties to mental ones is in place, panpsychism is not a (strong) form of property dualism; otherwise it is.

====Dual aspect theory====
[[Dual aspect theory]] or dual-aspect monism is the view that the [[mind|mental]] and the [[nature|physical]] are two aspects of, or perspectives on, the same substance.  (Thus it is a mixed position, which is monistic in some respects). In modern philosophical writings, the theory's relationship to [[neutral monism]] has become somewhat ill-defined, but one proffered distinction says that whereas neutral monism allows the context of a given group of neutral elements and the relationships into which they enter to determine whether the group can be thought of as mental, physical, both, or neither, dual-aspect theory suggests that the mental and the physical are manifestations (or aspects) of some underlying substance, entity or process that is itself neither mental nor physical as normally understood. Various formulations of dual-aspect monism also require the mental and the physical to be complementary, mutually irreducible and perhaps inseparable (though distinct).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Atmanspacher | first1 = H | year = 2012 | title = Dual-aspect monism a la Pauli and Jung | url = https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harald_Atmanspacher/publication/262956033_Dual-Aspect_Monism_a_la_Pauli_and_Jung/links/568a246308ae051f9af9ca21.pdf | journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies: Special Issue on Monist Alternatives to Physicalism | volume = 19 | issue = 9–10| pages = 96–120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Velmans | first1 = M | year = 2012 | title = Reflexive Monism: psychophysical relations among mind, matter and consciousness | url = https://www.academia.edu/2053423 | journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies: Special Issue on Monist Alternatives to Physicalism | volume = 19 | issue = 9–10 | pages = 143–165 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171111113509/http://www.academia.edu/2053423/Reflexive_Monism_Psychophysical_relations_among_mind_matter_and_consciousness | archivedate = 2017-11-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leopold Stubenberg.

==== Experiential dualism ====
This is a philosophy of mind that regards the degrees of freedom between mental and physical well-being as not necessarily synonymous thus implying an experiential dualism between body and mind.  An example of these disparate degrees of freedom is given by [[B. Alan Wallace|Allan Wallace]] who notes that it is "experientially apparent that one may be physically uncomfortable—for instance, while engaging in a strenuous physical workout—while mentally cheerful; conversely, one may be mentally distraught while experiencing physical comfort".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Consciousness At The Crossroads: Conversations With The Dalai Lama On Brain Science And Buddhism|last=Wallace|first=Allen|publisher=Snow Lion|year=1999|isbn=9780545227209|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Experiential dualism notes that our subjective experience of merely seeing something in the physical world seems qualitatively different than mental processes like grief that comes from losing a loved one.  This philosophy also is a proponent of causal dualism which is defined as the dual ability for mental states and physical states to affect one another.  Mental states can cause changes in physical states and vice versa.

However, unlike cartesian dualism or some other systems, experiential dualism does not posit two fundamental substances in reality: mind and matter.  Rather, experiential dualism is to be understood as a conceptual framework that gives credence to the qualitative difference between the experience of mental and physical states.  Experiential dualism is accepted as the conceptual framework of [[Madhyamaka|Madhyamaka Buddhism]].

Madhayamaka Buddhism goes even further, finding fault with the monist view of physicalist philosophies of mind as well in that these generally posit matter and energy as the fundamental substance of reality.  Nonetheless, this does not imply that the cartesian dualist view is correct, rather Madhyamaka regards as error any affirming view of a fundamental substance to reality.&lt;blockquote&gt;In denying the independent self-existence of all the phenomena that make up the world of our experience, the Madhyamaka view departs from both the substance dualism of Descartes and the substance monism—namely, physicalism—that is characteristic of modern science. The physicalism propounded by many contemporary scientists seems to assert that the real world is composed of physical things-in-themselves, while all mental phenomena are regarded as mere appearances, devoid of any reality in and of themselves. Much is made of this difference between appearances and reality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Indeed, physicalism, or the idea that matter is the only fundamental substance of reality, is explicitly rejected by Buddhism.&lt;blockquote&gt;In the Madhyamaka view, mental events are no more or less real than physical events. In terms of our common-sense experience, differences of kind do exist between physical and mental phenomena. While the former commonly have mass, location, velocity, shape, size, and numerous other physical attributes, these are not generally characteristic of mental phenomena. For example, we do not commonly conceive of the feeling of affection for another person as having mass or location. These physical attributes are no more appropriate to other mental events such as sadness, a recalled image from one's childhood, the visual perception of a rose, or consciousness of any sort. Mental phenomena are, therefore, not regarded as being physical, for the simple reason that they lack many of the attributes that are uniquely characteristic of physical phenomena. Thus, Buddhism has never adopted the physicalist principle that regards only physical things as real.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Hylomorphism====
{{Main|Hylomorphism}}
Hylomorphism is a theory that originates with [[Aristotle|Aristotelian philosophy]], which conceives [[ousia|being]] as a compound of [[matter]] and [[Substantial form|form]]. "Hylomorphism" is a 19th-century term formed from the Greek words ὕλη ''hyle'', "wood, matter", and μορφή, ''morphē'', "form".

==Monist solutions to the mind–body problem==
In contrast to [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]], [[monism]] does not accept any fundamental divisions. The fundamentally disparate nature of reality has been central to forms of eastern philosophies for over two millennia. In [[Indian philosophy|Indian]] and [[Chinese philosophy]], monism is integral to how experience is understood. Today, the most common forms of monism in Western philosophy are [[physicalism|physicalist]].&lt;ref name="Kim" /&gt; Physicalistic monism asserts that the only existing substance is physical, in some sense of that term to be clarified by our best science.&lt;ref name="Stol"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a variety of formulations (see below) are possible. Another form of monism, [[idealism]], states that the only existing substance is mental. Although pure idealism, such as that of [[George Berkeley]], is uncommon in contemporary Western philosophy, a more sophisticated variant called [[panpsychism]], according to which mental experience and properties may be at the foundation of physical experience and properties, has been espoused by some philosophers such as [[Alfred North Whitehead]]&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Michel Weber]] and Anderson Weekes (eds.), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279961/Process_Approaches_to_Consciousness_in_Psychology_Neuroscience_and_Philosophy_of_Mind Process Approaches to Consciousness in Psychology, Neuroscience, and Philosophy of Mind (Whitehead Psychology Nexus Studies II)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408022540/http://www.academia.edu/279961/Process_Approaches_to_Consciousness_in_Psychology_Neuroscience_and_Philosophy_of_Mind |date=2015-04-08 }}'', Albany, New York, State University of New York Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Ray Griffin]].&lt;ref name="Chalmers" /&gt;

[[Phenomenalism]] is the theory that representations (or [[sense data]]) of external objects are all that exist. Such a view was briefly adopted by [[Bertrand Russell]] and many of the [[logical positivists]] during the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand (1918) ''Mysticism and Logic and Other Essays'', London: Longmans, Green.&lt;/ref&gt; A third possibility is to accept the existence of a basic substance that is neither physical nor mental. The mental and physical would then both be properties of this neutral substance. Such a position was adopted by Baruch Spinoza&lt;ref name="Spin" /&gt; and was popularized by [[Ernst Mach]]&lt;ref&gt;Mach, E. (1886) ''Die Analyse der Empfindungen und das Verhältnis des Physischen zum Psychischen.'' Fifth edition translated as ''The Analysis of Sensations and the Relation of Physical to the Psychical'', New York: Dover. 1959&lt;/ref&gt; in the 19th century. This [[neutral monism]], as it is called, resembles property dualism.

===Physicalistic monisms===

====Behaviorism====
{{Main|Behaviorism}}
Behaviorism dominated philosophy of mind for much of the 20th century, especially the first half.&lt;ref name="Kim" /&gt; In psychology, behaviorism developed as a reaction to the inadequacies of [[introspection]]ism.&lt;ref name="Stol" /&gt; Introspective reports on one's own interior mental life are not subject to careful examination for accuracy and cannot be used to form predictive generalizations. Without generalizability and the possibility of third-person examination, the behaviorists argued, psychology cannot be scientific.&lt;ref name="Stol" /&gt; The way out, therefore, was to eliminate the idea of an interior mental life (and hence an ontologically independent mind) altogether and focus instead on the description of observable behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Skinner, B.F. | title=Beyond Freedom &amp; Dignity | publisher=Bantam/Vintage Books |location=New York | year=1972 | isbn=978-0-553-14372-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallel to these developments in psychology, a philosophical behaviorism (sometimes called logical behaviorism) was developed.&lt;ref name="Stol" /&gt; This is characterized by a strong [[verificationism]], which generally considers unverifiable statements about interior mental life pointless. For the behaviorist, mental states are not interior states on which one can make introspective reports. They are just descriptions of behavior or [[disposition]]s to behave in certain ways, made by third parties to explain and predict another's behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Ryle, Gilbert | title=The Concept of Mind | publisher=Chicago University Press | location=Chicago | year=1949 |isbn=978-0-226-73295-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophical behaviorism has fallen out of favor since the latter half of the 20th century, coinciding with the rise of [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]].&lt;ref name="Kim1" /&gt; Cognitivists reject behaviorism due to several perceived problems. For example, behaviorism could be said to be [[counterintuitive]] when it maintains that someone is talking about behavior in the event that a person is experiencing a painful headache.

====Identity theory====
{{Main|Type physicalism}}
Type physicalism (or type-identity theory) was developed by [[J. J. C. Smart|John Smart]]&lt;ref name="Smart" /&gt; and [[Ullin Place]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Place, Ullin | title=Is Consciousness a Brain Process? | journal=British Journal of Psychology | year=1956 | doi = 10.1111/j.2044-8295.1956.tb00560.x | volume=47 | pages=44–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a direct reaction to the failure of behaviorism. These philosophers reasoned that, if mental states are something material, but not behavioral, then mental states are probably identical to internal states of the brain. In very simplified terms: a mental state ''M'' is nothing other than brain state ''B''. The mental state "desire for a cup of coffee" would thus be nothing more than the "firing of certain neurons in certain brain regions".&lt;ref name="Smart" /&gt;
[[File:Anomalous Monism.png|thumb|right|250px|The classic Identity theory and Anomalous Monism in contrast. For the Identity theory, every token instantiation of a single mental type corresponds (as indicated by the arrows) to a physical token of a single physical type. For anomalous monism, the token–token correspondences can fall outside of the type–type correspondences. The result is token identity.]]

Despite its initial plausibility, the identity theory faces a strong challenge in the form of the thesis of [[multiple realizability]], first formulated by [[Hilary Putnam]].&lt;ref name="Pu" /&gt; For example, not only humans, but many different species of animals can experience pain. However, it seems highly unlikely that all of these diverse organisms with the same pain experience are in the identical brain state. And if this is the case, then pain cannot be identical to a specific brain state. The identity theory is thus empirically unfounded.&lt;ref name="Pu" /&gt;

On the other hand, even granted the above, it does not follow that identity theories of all types must be abandoned. According to token identity theories, the fact that a certain brain state is connected with only one mental state of a person does not have to mean that there is an absolute correlation between types of mental state and types of brain state. The type–token distinction can be illustrated by a simple example: the word "green" contains four types of letters (g, r, e, n) with two tokens (occurrences) of the letter ''e'' along with one each of the others.
The idea of token identity is that only particular occurrences of mental events are identical with particular occurrences or tokenings of physical events.&lt;ref&gt;Smart, J.J.C, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2002/entries/malebranche "Identity Theory"], ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2002 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; Anomalous monism (see below) and most other non-reductive physicalisms are token-identity theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Davidson, D.| title=Subjective, Intersubjective, Objective | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford | year=2001 | isbn=978-88-7078-832-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these problems, there is a renewed interest in the type identity theory today, primarily due to the influence of [[Jaegwon Kim]].&lt;ref name="Smart" /&gt;

====Functionalism====
{{Main|Functionalism (philosophy of mind)}}
Functionalism was formulated by [[Hilary Putnam]] and [[Jerry Fodor]] as a reaction to the inadequacies of the identity theory.&lt;ref name="Pu" /&gt; Putnam and Fodor saw mental states in terms of an empirical [[computational theory of mind|computational theory of the mind]].&lt;ref name="Block"&gt;Block, Ned. "What is functionalism" in ''Readings in Philosophy of Psychology'', 2 vols. Vol 1. (Cambridge: Harvard, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; At about the same time or slightly after, [[D.M. Armstrong]] and [[David Kellogg Lewis]] formulated a version of functionalism that analyzed the mental concepts of folk psychology in terms of functional roles.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, D., 1968, ''A Materialist Theory of the Mind'', Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]'s idea of meaning as use led to a version of functionalism as a theory of meaning, further developed by [[Wilfrid Sellars]] and [[Gilbert Harman]]. Another one, [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)#Psychofunctionalism|psychofunctionalism]], is an approach adopted by the [[Naturalism (philosophy)#Metaphysical naturalism|naturalistic philosophy of mind]] associated with Jerry Fodor and [[Zenon Pylyshyn]].

What all these different varieties of functionalism share in common is the thesis that mental states are characterized by their causal relations with other mental states and with sensory inputs and behavioral outputs. That is, functionalism abstracts away from the details of the physical implementation of a mental state by characterizing it in terms of non-mental functional properties. For example, a kidney is characterized scientifically by its functional role in filtering blood and maintaining certain chemical balances. From this point of view, it does not really matter whether the kidney be made up of organic tissue, plastic nanotubes or silicon chips: it is the role that it plays and its relations to other organs that define it as a kidney.&lt;ref name="Block" /&gt;

====Non-reductive physicalism====
{{Main|Physicalism}}

Non-reductionist philosophers hold firmly to two essential convictions with regard to mind–body relations: 1) Physicalism is true and mental states must be physical states, but 2) All reductionist proposals are unsatisfactory: mental states cannot be reduced to behavior, brain states or functional states.&lt;ref name="Stol" /&gt; Hence, the question arises whether there can still be a non-reductive physicalism. [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]'s [[anomalous monism]]&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt; is an attempt to formulate such a physicalism. He "thinks that when one runs across what are traditionally seen as absurdities of Reason, such as akrasia or self-deception, the personal psychology framework is not to be given up in favor of the subpersonal one, but rather must be enlarged or extended so that the rationality set out by the principle of charity can be found elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Di Francesco M. &amp; Marraffa M.|title=The Unconscious, consciousness, and the Self illusion|journal=Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences|date=2013|volume=6|issue=1|pages=10–22|url=http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A13-01.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303051022/http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A13-01.pdf|archivedate=2017-03-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davidson uses the thesis of [[supervenience]]: mental states supervene on physical states, but are not reducible to them. "Supervenience" therefore describes a functional dependence: there can be no change in the mental without some change in the physical–causal reducibility between the mental and physical without ontological reducibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stanton | first1 = W.L. | year = 1983 | title = Supervenience and Psychological Law in Anomalous Monism | url = | journal = Pacific Philosophical Quarterly | volume = 64 | issue = | pages = 72–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because non-reductive physicalist theories attempt to both retain the ontological distinction between mind and body and try to solve the "surfeit of explanations puzzle" in some way; critics often see this as a paradox and point out the similarities to [[epiphenomenalism]], in that it is the brain that is seen as the root "cause" not the mind, and the mind seems to be rendered inert.

Epiphenomenalism regards one or more mental states as the byproduct of physical brain states, having no influence on physical states. The interaction is one-way (solving the "surfeit of explanations puzzle") but leaving us with non-reducible mental states (as a byproduct of brain states) – causally reducible, but ontologically irreducible to physical states. Pain would be seen by epiphenomenaliasts as being caused by the brain state but as not having effects on other brain states, though it might have effects on other mental states (i.e. cause distress).

====Weak emergentism====
{{Main|Emergentism}}
Weak emergentism is a form of "non-reductive physicalism" that involves a layered view of nature, with the layers arranged in terms of increasing complexity and each corresponding to its own special science. Some philosophers hold that emergent properties causally interact with more fundamental levels, while others maintain that higher-order properties simply supervene over lower levels without direct causal interaction. The latter group therefore holds a less strict, or "weaker", definition of emergentism, which can be rigorously stated as follows: a property P of composite object O is emergent if it is metaphysically impossible for another object to lack property P if that object is composed of parts with intrinsic properties identical to those in O and has those parts in an identical configuration.

Sometimes emergentists use the example of water having a new property when Hydrogen H and Oxygen O combine to form H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (water). In this example there "emerges" a new property of a transparent liquid that would not have been predicted by understanding hydrogen and oxygen as gases. This is analogous to physical properties of the brain giving rise to a mental state. Emergentists try to solve the notorious mind–body gap this way. One problem for emergentism is the idea of "causal closure" in the world that does not allow for a mind-to-body causation.&lt;ref&gt;Jaegwon Kim, Philosophy of Mind, Westview Press; 2 edition (July 8, 2005) {{ISBN|0-8133-4269-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eliminative materialism====
{{Main|Eliminative materialism}}
If one is a materialist and believes that all aspects of our common-sense psychology will find reduction to a mature [[cognitive neuroscience]], and that non-reductive materialism is mistaken, then one can adopt a final, more radical position: eliminative materialism.

There are several varieties of eliminative materialism, but all maintain that our common-sense "[[folk psychology]]" badly misrepresents the nature of some aspect of cognition. Eliminativists such as [[Patricia Churchland|Patricia]] and [[Paul Churchland]] argue that while folk psychology treats cognition as fundamentally sentence-like, the non-linguistic vector/matrix model of neural network theory or [[connectionism]] will prove to be a much more accurate account of how the brain works.&lt;ref name="Pat" /&gt;

The Churchlands often invoke the fate of other, erroneous popular theories and [[ontology|ontologies]] that have arisen in the course of history.&lt;ref name="Pat" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul" /&gt; For example, Ptolemaic astronomy served to explain and roughly predict the motions of the planets for centuries, but eventually this model of the solar system was eliminated in favor of the Copernican model. The Churchlands believe the same eliminative fate awaits the "sentence-cruncher" model of the mind in which thought and behavior are the result of manipulating sentence-like states called "[[propositional attitude]]s".

===Non-physicalist monisms===

====Idealism====
[[Idealism]] is the form of monism that sees the world as consisting  of minds, mental contents and or consciousness.
Idealists are not faced with explaining how  minds arise from bodies: rather, the world, bodies and objects are regarded as mere appearances held by minds. However, accounting for the mind–body problem is not usually the main motivation for idealism; rather, idealists tend to be motivated by [[skepticism]], intentionality, and the unique nature of ideas.
Idealism is prominent in Eastern religious and philosophical thought. It has gone through several cycles of popularity and neglect in the history of Western philosophy.

Different varieties of idealism may hold that there are
* multiple  minds ([[pluralistic idealism]])
* only one human mind ([[solipsism]])
* or a single [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]], [[Anima Mundi]], [[Plotinus#One|One]] or [[Over-soul]].

====Neutral monism====
[[Neutral monism]], in [[philosophy]], is the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] view that the mental and the physical are two ways of organizing or describing the same elements, which are themselves "neutral", that is, neither physical nor mental.  This view denies that the mental and the physical are two fundamentally different things. Rather, neutral monism claims the universe consists of only one kind of stuff, in the form of neutral elements that are in themselves neither mental nor physical. These neutral elements might have the properties of color and shape, just as we experience those properties. But these shaped and colored elements do not exist in a mind (considered as a substantial entity, whether dualistically or physicalistically); they exist on their own.

==Mysterianism==
{{Main|New mysterianism}}
Some philosophers take an epistemic approach and argue that the mind–body problem is currently unsolvable, and perhaps will always remain unsolvable to human beings. This is usually termed [[New mysterianism]]. [[Colin McGinn]] holds that human beings are [[Cognitive closure (philosophy)|cognitively closed]] in regards to their own minds. According to McGinn human minds lack the concept-forming procedures to fully grasp how mental properties such as [[consciousness]] arise from their causal basis.&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, Colin. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2254848 "Can We Solve the Mind–Body Problem?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226060901/http://www.jstor.org/stable/2254848 |date=2016-12-26 }}, ''Mind'', New Series, Vol. 98, No. 391, July 1989 (pp. 349–366), p. 350.
*Reprinted in O'Connor, Timothy and Robb, David. [https://books.google.com/books?id=BlSDUzfMxo0C&amp;pg=PA438 "Colin McGinn, Can We Solve the Mind–Body Problem?"], ''Philosophy of Mind: Contemporary Readings''. Routledge, 2003, p. 438ff.&lt;/ref&gt; An example would be how an elephant is cognitively closed in regards to particle physics.

A more moderate conception has been expounded by [[Thomas Nagel]], which holds that the mind–body problem is currently unsolvable at the present stage of scientific development and that it might take a future scientific [[paradigm shift]] or revolution to bridge the [[explanatory gap]]. Nagel posits that in the future a sort of "objective [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]" might be able to bridge the gap between subjective conscious experience and its physical basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/hard-con/#SH3b "Hard problem of Consciousness"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150420211306/http://www.iep.utm.edu/hard-con/ |date=2015-04-20 }}, ''The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Josh Weisberg&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistic criticism of the mind–body problem==
Each attempt to answer the mind–body problem encounters substantial problems. Some philosophers argue that this is because there is an underlying conceptual confusion.&lt;ref name="Hacker"&gt;{{cite book | author=Hacker, Peter | title=Philosophical Foundations of Neuroscience | publisher=Blackwel Pub. | year=2003 | isbn=978-1-4051-0838-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These philosophers, such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and his followers in the tradition of linguistic criticism, therefore reject the problem as illusory.&lt;ref name="Witt"&gt;{{cite book | author=Wittgenstein, Ludwig | title=Philosophical Investigations | publisher=Macmillan | location=New York | year=1954 | isbn=978-0-631-14660-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that it is an error to ask how mental and biological states fit together. Rather it should simply be accepted that human experience can be described in different ways—for instance, in a mental and in a biological vocabulary. Illusory problems arise if one tries to describe the one in terms of the other's vocabulary or if the mental vocabulary is used in the wrong contexts.&lt;ref name="Witt" /&gt; This is the case, for instance, if one searches for mental states of the brain. The brain is simply the wrong context for the use of mental vocabulary—the search for mental states of the brain is therefore a [[category error]] or a sort of fallacy of reasoning.&lt;ref name="Witt" /&gt;

Today, such a position is often adopted by interpreters of Wittgenstein such as [[Peter Hacker]].&lt;ref name="Hacker" /&gt; However, [[Hilary Putnam]], the originator of functionalism, has also adopted the position that the mind–body problem is an illusory problem which should be dissolved according to the manner of Wittgenstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Putnam, Hilary | title=The Threefold Cord: Mind, Body, and World | publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York | year=2000 |isbn=978-0-231-10286-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Externalism and internalism==
Where is the mind located? If the mind is a physical phenomenon of some kind, it has to be located somewhere. According to some, there are two possible options: either the mind is internal to the body ([[internalism]]) or the mind is external to it ([[externalism]]). More generally, either the mind depends only on events and properties taking place inside the subject's body or it depends also on factors external to it.

Proponents of internalism are committed to the view that neural activity is sufficient to produce the mind.
Proponents of externalism maintain that the surrounding world is in some sense constitutive of the mind.

Externalism differentiates into several versions. The main ones are [[semantic externalism]], [[cognitive externalism]] and [[phenomenal externalism]]. Each of these versions of externalism can further be divided into whether they refer only to the content or to the vehicles of the mind.

Semantic externalism holds that the semantic content of the mind is totally or partially defined by a state of affairs external to the body of the subject. [[Hilary Putnam]]'s [[Twin Earth thought experiment]] is a good example.

Cognitive externalism is a very broad collection of views that suggests the role of the environment, of tools, of development, and of the body in fleshing out cognition. [[Embodied cognition]], the [[extended mind]], and [[enactivism]] are good examples.

Phenomenal externalism suggests that the phenomenal aspects of the mind are external to the body. Authors who addressed this possibility are Ted Honderich, Edwin Holt, Francois Tonneau, Kevin O'Regan, Riccardo Manzotti, Teed Rockwell and Max Velmans.

==Naturalism and its problems==
The thesis of physicalism is that the mind is part of the material (or physical) world. Such a position faces the problem that the mind has certain properties that no other material thing seems to possess. Physicalism must therefore explain how it is possible that these properties can nonetheless emerge from a material thing. The project of providing such an explanation is often referred to as the "[[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalization]] of the mental".&lt;ref name="Stol" /&gt; Some of the crucial problems that this project attempts to resolve include the existence of qualia and the nature of intentionality.&lt;ref name="Stol" /&gt;

===Qualia===
{{Main|Qualia}}

Many mental states seem to be experienced subjectively in different ways by different individuals.&lt;ref name="Nagel" /&gt; And it is characteristic of a mental state that it has some experiential ''quality'', e.g. of pain, that it hurts. However, the sensation of pain between two individuals may not be identical, since no one has a perfect way to measure how much something hurts or of describing exactly how it feels to hurt. Philosophers and scientists therefore ask where these experiences come from. The existence of cerebral events, in and of themselves, cannot explain why they are accompanied by these corresponding qualitative experiences. The puzzle of why many cerebral processes occur with an accompanying experiential aspect in consciousness seems impossible to explain.&lt;ref name="Ja" /&gt;

Yet it also seems to many that science will eventually have to explain such experiences.&lt;ref name="Stol" /&gt; This [[Logical consequence|follows from]] an assumption about the possibility of [[reductionism|reductive explanations]]. According to this view, if an attempt can be successfully made to explain a phenomenon reductively (e.g., water), then it can be explained why the phenomenon has all of its properties (e.g., fluidity, transparency).&lt;ref name="Stol" /&gt; In the case of mental states, this means that there needs to be an explanation of why they have the property of being experienced in a certain way.

The 20th-century German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] criticized the [[ontology|ontological]] assumptions underpinning such a reductive model, and claimed that it was impossible to make sense of experience in these terms. This is because, according to Heidegger, the nature of our subjective experience and its ''qualities'' is impossible to understand in terms of [[Descartes|Cartesian]] "substances" that bear "properties". Another way to put this is that the very concept of qualitative experience is incoherent in terms of—or is semantically [[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurable]] with the concept of—substances that bear properties.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Dreyfus, "Critique of Descartes I" (recorded lecture), University of California at Berkeley, Sept. 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

This problem of explaining introspective first-person aspects of mental states and consciousness in general in terms of third-person quantitative neuroscience is called the [[explanatory gap]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Levine (philosopher)|Joseph Levine]], ''Materialism and Qualia: The Explanatory Gap'', in: ''Pacific Philosophical Quarterly'', vol. 64, no. 4, October, 1983, 354–361&lt;/ref&gt; There are several different views of the nature of this gap among contemporary philosophers of mind. [[David Chalmers]] and the early [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]] interpret the gap as [[ontology|ontological]] in nature; that is, they maintain that qualia can never be explained by science because [[physicalism]] is false. There are two separate categories involved and one cannot be reduced to the other.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, F. (1986) "What Mary didn't Know", Journal of Philosophy, 83, 5, pp. 291–295.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative view is taken by philosophers such as [[Thomas Nagel]] and [[Colin McGinn]]. According to them, the gap is [[epistemology|epistemological]] in nature. For Nagel, science is not yet able to explain subjective experience because it has not yet arrived at the level or kind of knowledge that is required. We are not even able to formulate the problem coherently.&lt;ref name="Nagel" /&gt; For McGinn, on other hand, the problem is one of permanent and inherent biological limitations. We are not able to resolve the explanatory gap because the realm of subjective experiences is cognitively closed to us in the same manner that quantum physics is cognitively closed to elephants.&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, C. "Can the Mind-Body Problem Be Solved", ''Mind'', New Series, Volume 98, Issue 391, pp. 349–366. a [http://art-mind.org/review/IMG/pdf/McGinn_1989_Mind-body-problem_M.pdf (online)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928101441/http://art-mind.org/review/IMG/pdf/McGinn_1989_Mind-body-problem_M.pdf |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other philosophers liquidate the gap as purely a semantic problem. This semantic problem, of course, led to the famous "''Qualia Question''", which is: ''Does Red cause Redness''?

===Intentionality===
{{Main|Intentionality}}
[[File:John Searle 2002.jpg|thumb|[[John Searle]]—one of the most influential philosophers of mind, proponent of [[biological naturalism]] (Berkeley 2002)]]
[[Intentionality]] is the capacity of mental states to be directed towards (''about'') or be in relation with something in the external world.&lt;ref name="Searleint" /&gt; This property of mental states entails that they have [[mental content|contents]] and [[semantics|semantic referents]] and can therefore be assigned [[truth value]]s. When one tries to reduce these states to natural processes there arises a problem: natural processes are not true or false, they simply happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Fodor, Jerry | title=Psychosemantics. The problem of meaning in the philosophy of mind | publisher=MIT Press | location=Cambridge | year=1993 | isbn=978-0-262-06106-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It would not make any sense to say that a natural process is true or false. But mental ideas or judgments are true or false, so how then can mental states (ideas or judgments) be natural processes? The possibility of assigning semantic value to ideas must mean that such ideas are about facts. Thus, for example, the idea that [[Herodotus]] was a historian refers to Herodotus and to the fact that he was a historian. If the fact is true, then the idea is true; otherwise, it is false. But where does this relation come from? In the brain, there are only electrochemical processes and these seem not to have anything to do with Herodotus.&lt;ref name="Int" /&gt;

==Philosophy of perception==
{{Main|Philosophy of perception}}
[[Philosophy of perception]] is concerned with the nature of [[Perception|perceptual experience]] and the status of perceptual objects, in particular how perceptual experience relates to appearances and beliefs about the world. The main contemporary views within philosophy of perception include [[naive realism]], [[enactivism]] and [[Mental representation|representational]] views.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Macpherson, F. 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, S. (2011)."The Contents of Perception", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/perception-contents/.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy of mind and science==
Humans are corporeal beings and, as such, they are subject to examination and description by the natural sciences. Since mental processes are intimately related to bodily processes, the descriptions that the natural sciences furnish of human beings play an important role in the philosophy of mind.&lt;ref name="Kim1" /&gt; There are many scientific disciplines that study processes related to the mental. The list of such sciences includes: [[biology]], [[computer science]], [[cognitive science]], [[cybernetics]], [[linguistics]], [[medicine]], [[pharmacology]], and [[psychology]].&lt;ref name="Pinker"&gt;Pinker, S. (1997) ''How the Mind Works''. tr. It: ''Come Funziona la Mente''. Milan:Mondadori, 2000. {{ISBN|88-04-49908-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurobiology===
{{Main|Neuroscience}}
The theoretical background of biology, as is the case with modern [[natural science]]s in general, is fundamentally materialistic. The objects of study are, in the first place, physical processes, which are considered to be the foundations of mental activity and behavior.&lt;ref name="Bear"&gt;Bear, M. F. et al. Eds. (1995). ''Neuroscience: Exploring The Brain''. Baltimore, Maryland, Williams and Wilkins. {{ISBN|0-7817-3944-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing success of biology in the explanation of mental phenomena can be seen by the absence of any empirical refutation of its fundamental presupposition: "there can be no change in the mental states of a person without a change in brain states."&lt;ref name="Pinker" /&gt;

Within the field of neurobiology, there are many subdisciplines that are concerned with the relations between mental and physical states and processes:&lt;ref name="Bear" /&gt; [[Neurophysiology|Sensory neurophysiology]] investigates the relation between the processes of [[perception]] and [[stimulation]].&lt;ref name="Pinel"&gt;{{cite book | author=Pinel, J.P.J | title=Psychobiology | publisher=Prentice Hall | year=1997 | isbn=978-88-15-07174-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cognitive neuroscience]] studies the correlations between mental processes and neural processes.&lt;ref name="Pinel" /&gt; [[Neuropsychology]] describes the dependence of mental faculties on specific anatomical regions of the brain.&lt;ref name="Pinel" /&gt; Lastly, [[evolutionary biology]] studies the origins and development of the human nervous system and, in as much as this is the basis of the mind, also describes the [[ontogenesis|ontogenetic]] and [[phylogenesis|phylogenetic]] development of mental phenomena beginning from their most primitive stages.&lt;ref name="Pinker" /&gt; Evolutionary biology furthermore places tight constraints on any philosophical theory of the mind, as the [[gene]]-based mechanism of [[natural selection]] does not allow any giant leaps in the development of neural complexity or neural software but only incremental steps over long time periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Metzinger, Thomas | title=Being No One – The Self Model Theory of Subjectivity | publisher=MIT Press | location=Cambridge | year=2003 | pages=349–366 | isbn=978-0-262-13417-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Functional magnetic resonance imaging.jpg|thumb|Since the 1980s, sophisticated [[neuroimaging]] procedures, such as [[fMRI]] (above), have furnished increasing knowledge about the workings of the human brain, shedding light on ancient philosophical problems.]]

The [[methodology|methodological]] breakthroughs of the neurosciences, in particular the introduction of high-tech neuroimaging procedures, has propelled scientists toward the elaboration of increasingly ambitious research programs: one of the main goals is to describe and comprehend the neural processes which correspond to mental functions (see: [[neural correlate]]).&lt;ref name="Bear" /&gt; Several groups are inspired by these advances.

===Computer science===
{{Main|Computer science}}
Computer science concerns itself with the automatic processing of [[information]] (or at least with physical systems of symbols to which information is assigned) by means of such things as [[computer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Sipser, M.| title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation | location=Boston, Mass. | publisher=PWS Publishing Co. | isbn=978-0-534-94728-6 | year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning, [[computer programmer]]s have been able to develop programs that permit computers to carry out tasks for which organic beings need a mind. A simple example is multiplication. It is not clear whether computers could be said to have a mind. Could they, someday, come to have what we call a mind? This question has been propelled into the forefront of much philosophical debate because of investigations in the field of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI).

Within AI, it is common to distinguish between a modest research program and a more ambitious one: this distinction was coined by [[John Searle]] in terms of a [[philosophy of artificial intelligence#Strong AI vs. weak AI|weak AI and strong AI]]. The exclusive objective of "weak AI", according to Searle, is the successful simulation of mental states, with no attempt to make computers become conscious or aware, etc. The objective of strong AI, on the contrary, is a computer with consciousness similar to that of human beings.&lt;ref name="Searle"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Searle, John | title=Minds, Brains and Programs | journal=The Behavioral and Brain Sciences | issue=3 | pages=417–424 |year=1980|url=http://cogprints.org/7150/1/10.1.1.83.5248.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program of strong AI goes back to one of the pioneers of computation [[Alan Turing]]. As an answer to the question "Can computers think?", he formulated the famous [[Turing test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Turing 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turing believed that a computer could be said to "think" when, if placed in a room by itself next to another room that contained a human being and with the same questions being asked of both the computer and the human being by a third party human being, the computer's responses turned out to be indistinguishable from those of the human. Essentially, Turing's view of machine intelligence followed the behaviourist model of the mind—intelligence is as intelligence does. The Turing test has received many criticisms, among which the most famous is probably the [[Chinese room]] [[thought experiment]] formulated by Searle.&lt;ref name="Searle" /&gt;

The question about the possible sensitivity ([[qualia]]) of computers or robots still remains open. Some computer scientists believe that the specialty of AI can still make new contributions to the resolution of the "mind–body problem". They suggest that based on the reciprocal influences between software and hardware that takes place in all computers, it is possible that someday theories can be discovered that help us to understand the reciprocal influences between the human mind and the brain ([[wetware (brain)|wetware]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Russell, S.  |author2=Norvig, R.  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Artificial Intelligence:A Modern Approach | location=New Jersey | publisher=Prentice Hall, Inc. | year=1995 | isbn=978-0-13-103805-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychology===
{{Main|Psychology}}
Psychology is the science that investigates mental states directly. It uses generally empirical methods to investigate concrete mental states like [[joy]], [[fear]] or [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|obsessions]]. Psychology investigates the laws that bind these mental states to each other or with inputs and outputs to the human organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.psychology.org | title=Encyclopedia of Psychology | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513103646/http://www.psychology.org/ | archivedate=2008-05-13 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this is the [[Perception|psychology of perception]]. Scientists working in this field have discovered general principles of the [[Form perception|perception of forms]]. A law of the psychology of forms says that objects that move in the same direction are perceived as related to each other.&lt;ref name="Pinker" /&gt; This law describes a relation between visual input and mental perceptual states. However, it does not suggest anything about the nature of perceptual states. The laws discovered by psychology are compatible with all the answers to the mind–body problem already described.

===Cognitive science===
[[Cognitive science]] is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the mind and its processes.  It examines what [[cognition]] is, what it does, and how it works.  It includes research on intelligence and behavior, especially focusing on how information is represented, processed, and transformed (in faculties such as perception, language, memory, reasoning, and emotion) within nervous systems (human or other animal) and machines (e.g. computers). Cognitive science consists of multiple research disciplines, including [[psychology]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[philosophy]], [[neuroscience]], [[linguistics]], [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], and [[education]].&lt;ref&gt;Thagard, Paul, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/cognitive-science/ Cognitive Science], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; It spans many levels of analysis, from low-level learning and decision mechanisms to high-level logic and planning; from neural circuitry to modular brain organisation. [[Mark Rowlands|Rowlands]] argues  that cognition is  enactive, embodied, embedded, affective and (potentially) extended. The position is taken that the "classical sandwich" of cognition sandwiched between perception and action is artificial; cognition has to be seen as a product of a strongly coupled interaction that cannot be divided this way.&lt;ref name=Rowlands&gt;{{cite book |author=Mark Rowlands |authorlink=Mark Rowlands |chapter=Chapter 3: The mind embedded |pages=51 ''ff'' |year=2010 |isbn=978-0262014557 |publisher=MIT Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AiwjpL-0hDgC&amp;pg=PA51 |title=The new science of the mind: From extended mind to embodied phenomenology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ward&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dave Ward |author2=Mog Stapleton |year=2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y1E7FogqvJ0C&amp;pg=PA89 |chapter=Es are good.

==Philosophy of mind in the continental tradition==
Most of the discussion in this article has focused on one style or tradition of philosophy in modern Western culture, usually called [[analytic philosophy]] (sometimes described as Anglo-American philosophy).&lt;ref name="Dummett"&gt;{{cite book | author=Dummett, M.| title=Origini della Filosofia Analitica | publisher=Einaudi | year=2001 | isbn=978-88-06-15286-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other schools of thought exist, however, which are sometimes subsumed under the broad (and vague) label of [[continental philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Dummett" /&gt; In any case, though topics and methods here are numerous, in relation to the philosophy of mind the various schools that fall under this label ([[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[existentialism]], etc.) can globally be seen to differ from the analytic school in that they focus less on language and logical analysis alone but also take in other forms of understanding human existence and experience. With reference specifically to the discussion of the mind, this tends to translate into attempts to grasp the concepts of [[thought]] and [[experience|perceptual experience]] in some sense that does not merely involve the analysis of linguistic forms.&lt;ref name="Dummett" /&gt;

Immanuel Kant's ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', first published in 1781 and presented again with major revisions in 1787, represents a significant intervention into what will later become known as the philosophy of mind. Kant's first [[critique]] is generally recognized as among the most significant works of [[modern philosophy]] in the West. Kant is a figure whose influence is marked in both [[Continental philosophy|continental]] and analytic/Anglo-American philosophy. Kant's work develops an in-depth study of [[Transcendental idealism|transcendental]] consciousness, or the life of the mind as conceived through universal [[category (Kant)|categories]] of consciousness.

In [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s ''Philosophy of Mind'' (frequently translated as ''Philosophy of Spirit'' or [[Geist]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Hegel, G.W.F | title=Phenomenology of Spirit | isbn=978-0-19-503169-0| year=1983 }}, translated by A.V. Miller with analysis of the text and foreword by J. N. Findlay (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1977) {{ISBN|0-19-824597-1}} .&lt;/ref&gt; the third part of his ''[[Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences]]'', Hegel discusses three distinct types of mind: the "subjective mind/spirit", the mind of an individual; the "objective mind/spirit", the mind of society and of the State; and the "Absolute mind/spirit", the position of religion, art, and philosophy. See also Hegel's ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]''. Nonetheless, Hegel's work differs radically from the style of [[Anglosphere|Anglo-American]] philosophy of mind.

In 1896, [[Henri Bergson]] made in ''[[Matter and Memory]]'' "Essay on the relation of body and spirit" a forceful case for the ontological difference of body and mind by reducing the problem to the more definite one of memory, thus allowing for a solution built on the ''empirical test case'' of [[aphasia]].

In modern times, the two main schools that have developed in response or opposition to this Hegelian tradition are phenomenology and existentialism. Phenomenology, founded by [[Edmund Husserl]], focuses on the contents of the human mind (see [[noema]]) and how processes shape our experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Husserl, Edmund | title=Logische Untersuchungen | isbn=978-3-05-004391-3| year=2008 }} trans.: Giovanni Piana. Milan: EST. {{ISBN|88-428-0949-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Existentialism, a school of thought founded upon the work of [[Søren Kierkegaard]], focuses on Human predicament and how people deal with the situation of being alive. Existential-phenomenology represents a major branch of continental philosophy (they are not contradictory), rooted in the work of Husserl but expressed in its fullest forms in the work of [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]] and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]]. See Heidegger's ''[[Being and Time]]'', Merleau-Ponty's ''[[Phenomenology of Perception]]'', Sartre's ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', and Simone de Beauvoir's ''[[The Second Sex]]''.

==Mind in Eastern philosophy==

===Mind in Hindu philosophy===

====Dualism====
[[Cartesian dualism|Substance Dualism]] is a common feature of several [[Āstika and nāstika#Āstika|orthodox Hindu schools]] including the [[Sāṅkhya]], [[Nyāya]], [[Yoga]] and [[Dvaita Vedanta]]. In these schools a clear difference is drawn between matter and a non-material soul, which is eternal and undergoes [[samsara]], a cycle of death and rebirth. The [[Nyāya]] school argued that qualities such as cognition and desire are inherent qualities which are not possessed by anything solely material, and therefore by process of elimination must belong to a non-material self, the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/nyaya/#H2/|title=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004042359/http://www.iep.utm.edu/nyaya/#H2/|archivedate=2012-10-04|df=}} Nyāya, Matthew R. Dasti&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these schools see their spiritual goal as [[moksha]], liberation from the cycle of reincarnation.

====Vedanta monistic idealism====
[[File:Raja Ravi Varma - Sankaracharya.jpg|thumb|right|x200px|Śaṅkara]]
In the [[Advaita Vedanta]] of the 8th century Indian philosopher [[Śaṅkara]], the mind, body and world are all held to be the same unchanging eternal conscious entity called [[Brahman]]. Advaita, which means non-dualism, holds the view that all that exists is pure absolute [[consciousness]]. The fact that the world seems to be made up of changing entities is an illusion, or [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]. The only thing that exists is [[Brahman]], which is described as [[Satchitananda]] (Being, consciousness and bliss). Advaita Vedanta is best described by a verse which states "Brahman is alone True, and this world of plurality is an error; the individual self is not different from Brahman."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/adv-veda/|title=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626101653/http://www.iep.utm.edu/adv-veda/|archivedate=2015-06-26|df=}} Advaita Vedanta, Sangeetha Menon&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of monistic Vedanta is [[Vishishtadvaita]] (qualified non-dualism) as posited by the eleventh century philosopher [[Ramanuja]]. Ramanuja criticized Advaita Vedanta by arguing that consciousness is always [[intentionality|intentional]] and that it is also always a property of something. Ramanuja's Brahman is defined by a multiplicity of qualities and properties in a single monistic entity. This doctrine is called "[[samanadhikaranya]]" (several things in a common substrate).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/ramanuja|title=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717055536/http://www.iep.utm.edu/ramanuja/|archivedate=2014-07-17|df=}} Ramanuja, Shyam Ranganathan&lt;/ref&gt;

====Materialism====
Arguably the first exposition of [[empiricism|empirical]] [[materialism]] in the history of philosophy is in the [[Cārvāka]] school (also called Lokāyata). The Cārvāka school rejected the existence of anything but matter (which they defined as being made up of the [[four elements]]), including God and the soul. Therefore, they held that even consciousness was nothing but a construct made up of atoms. A section of the Cārvāka school believed in a material soul made up of air or breath, but since this also was a form of matter, it was not said to survive death.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/indmat/#H1|title=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611095345/http://www.iep.utm.edu/indmat/#H1|archivedate=2010-06-11|df=}} Lokāyata/Cārvāka – Indian Materialism, Abigail Turner-Lauck Wernicki&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhist philosophy of mind===
{{PancaKhandha}}
Buddhist teachings describe that the mind manifests moment-to-moment as sense impressions and mental phenomena that are continuously changing.&lt;ref name=Aggregates&gt;{{cite journal |author=Karunamuni N.D. |title=The Five-Aggregate Model of the Mind |journal=SAGE Open |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=215824401558386 |date=May 2015 |url=http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/spsgo/5/2/2158244015583860.full.pdf |doi=10.1177/2158244015583860 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921004343/http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/spsgo/5/2/2158244015583860.full.pdf |archivedate=2016-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The moment-by-moment manifestation of the mind-stream has been described as happening in every person all the time, even in a scientist who analyses various phenomena in the world, or analyses the material body including the organ brain.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt; The manifestation of the mind-stream is also described as being influenced by physical laws, biological laws, psychological laws, volitional laws, and universal laws.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt;

A salient feature of [[Buddhist philosophy]] which sets it apart from Indian orthodoxy is the centrality of the doctrine of [[Anatta|not-self]] ([[Pāli]]. anatta, Skt. anātman). The Buddha's not-self doctrine sees humans as an impermanent composite of five psychological and physical aspects instead of a single fixed self. In this sense, what is called ego or the self is merely a convenient fiction, an illusion that does not apply to anything real but to an erroneous way of looking at the ever-changing stream of [[five aggregates|five interconnected aggregate factors]].&lt;ref name="Coseru"&gt;{{citation|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mind-indian-buddhism/|title= Coseru, Christian, "Mind in Indian Buddhist Philosophy"}}, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2012 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between these aggregates is said to be one of dependent-arising ([[pratītyasamutpāda]]). This means that all things, including mental events, arise co-dependently from a plurality of other causes and conditions. This seems to reject both [[determinism|causal determinist]] and [[epiphenomenalism|epiphenomenalist]] conceptions of mind.&lt;ref name="Coseru" /&gt;

====Abhidharma theories of mind====
Three centuries after the death of the Buddha (c. 150 BCE) saw the growth of a large body of literature called the [[Abhidharma]] in several contending [[Buddhist schools]]. In the Abhidharmic analysis of mind, the ordinary thought is defined as [[prapañca]] ('conceptual proliferation'). According to this theory, perceptual experience is bound up in multiple conceptualizations (expectations, judgments and desires). This proliferation of conceptualizations form our illusory superimposition of concepts like [[self]] and [[Other (philosophy)|other]] upon an ever-changing stream of aggregate phenomena.&lt;ref name="Coseru" /&gt;
In this conception of mind no strict distinction is made between the conscious faculty and the actual sense perception of various phenomena. Consciousness is instead said to be divided into six sense modalities, five for the [[five senses]] and sixth for perception of mental phenomena.&lt;ref name="Coseru" /&gt; The arising of cognitive awareness is said to depend on sense perception, awareness of the mental faculty itself which is termed mental or 'introspective awareness' (''manovijñāna'') and attention (''āvartana''), the picking out of objects out of the constantly changing stream of sensory impressions.

Rejection of a permanent agent eventually led to the philosophical problems of the seeming continuity of mind and also of explaining how [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] and [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]] continue to be relevant doctrines without an eternal mind. This challenge was met by the [[Theravāda]] school by introducing the concept of mind as a factor of existence. This "life-stream" ([[Bhavanga]]-sota) is an undercurrent  forming the condition of being. The continuity of a karmic "person" is therefore assured in the form of a [[mindstream]] (citta-santana), a series of flowing mental moments arising from the subliminal life-continuum mind ([[Bhavanga]]-citta), mental content, and attention.&lt;ref name="Coseru" /&gt;

====Indian Mahayana====
The [[Sautrāntika]] school held a form of [[phenomenalism]] that saw the world as imperceptible. It held that external objects exist only as a support for cognition, which can only apprehend mental representations. This influenced the later [[Yogācāra]] school of [[Mahayana Buddhism]]. The Yogācāra school is often called the mind-only school because of its [[Internalism and externalism#Philosophy of mind|internalist]] stance that consciousness is the ultimate existing reality. The works of [[Vasubandhu]] have often been interpreted as arguing for some form of [[Idealism]]. Vasubandhu uses the [[dream argument]] and a [[mereology|mereological]] refutation of atomism to attack the reality of external objects as anything other than mental entities.&lt;ref name="Gold"&gt;{{citation|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vasubandhu/|title=Gold, Jonathan C., "Vasubandhu"|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201232037/http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vasubandhu/|archivedate=2012-12-01|df=}}, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2012 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarly interpretations of Vasubandhu's philosophy vary widely, and include phenomenalism, [[neutral monism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)#Realist phenomenology|realist phenomenology]].

The Indian [[Schools of Buddhism#Mahāyāna schools|Mahayana schools]] were divided on the issue of the possibility of reflexive awareness (''[[svasaṃvedana]]''). [[Dharmakīrti]] accepted the idea of reflexive awareness as expounded by the Yogācāra school, comparing it to a lamp that illuminates itself while also illuminating other objects. This was strictly rejected by [[Mādhyamika]] scholars like [[Candrakīrti]]. Since in the philosophy of the Mādhyamika all things and mental events are characterized by [[Shunyata|emptiness]], they argued that consciousness could not be an inherently reflexive ultimate reality since that would mean it was self-validating and therefore not characterized by emptiness.&lt;ref name="Coseru" /&gt; These views were ultimately reconciled by the 8th century thinker [[Śāntarakṣita]]. In Śāntarakṣita's synthesis he adopts the idealist Yogācāra views of reflexive awareness as a conventional truth into the structure of the [[two truths doctrine]]. Thus he states: "By relying on the Mind-Only system, know that external entities do not exist. And by relying on this Middle Way system, know that no self exists at all, even in that [mind]." &lt;ref name="Blumenthal"&gt;{{citation|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/saantarak-sita/|title= Blumenthal, James, "Śāntarakṣita"}}, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (fall 2009 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yogācāra school also developed the theory of the [[Vijñāna#Eight vijñānas|repository consciousness]] (''ālayavijñāna'') to explain continuity of mind in [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] and accumulation of [[karma]]. This repository consciousness acts as a storehouse for karmic seeds ([[Bīja|bija]]) when all other senses are absent during the process of death and rebirth as well as being the causal potentiality of [[Dharma (Buddhism)#Dharmas in Buddhist phenomenology|dharmic phenomena]].&lt;ref name="Coseru" /&gt; Thus according to [[B. Alan Wallace]]: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;No constituents of the body—in the brain or elsewhere—transform into mental states and processes. Such subjective experiences do not emerge from the body, but neither do they emerge from nothing. Rather, all objective mental appearances arise from the substrate, and all subjective mental states and processes arise from the substrate consciousness.&lt;ref name="Wallace"&gt;B. Alan Wallace; [https://books.google.com/books?id=WeUYBQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Mind in the Balance: Meditation in Science, Buddhism, and Christianity], p. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Tibetan Buddhism====
[[Tibetan Buddhist]] theories of mind evolved directly from the Indian Mahayana views. Thus the founder of the [[Gelug]] school, [[Je Tsongkhapa]] discusses the Yogācāra system of the [[Eight Consciousnesses]] in his ''Explanation of the Difficult Points''.&lt;ref name="Sparham"&gt;{{citation|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2011/entries/tsongkhapa/|title= Sparham, Gareth, "Tsongkhapa"}}, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (fall 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; He would later come to repudiate [[Śāntarakṣita]]'s pragmatic [[idealism]]. 
According to the [[14th Dalai Lama]] the mind can be defined "as an entity that has the nature of mere experience, that is, 'clarity and knowing'. It is the knowing nature, or agency, that is called mind, and this is non-material."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.lamayeshe.com/index.php?sect=article&amp;id=417|title=Talk by His Holiness the Dalai Lama at Cambridge, MA USA|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019213407/http://www.lamayeshe.com/index.php?sect=article&amp;id=417|archivedate=2013-10-19|df=}}, From MindScience, edited by Daniel Goleman and Robert F. Thurman, first in 1991 by Wisdom Publications, Boston, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; The simultaneously dual nature of mind is as follows:
:: 1. '''Clarity''' (''gsal'') – The mental activity which produces cognitive phenomena (''snang-ba'').
:: 2. '''Knowing''' (''rig'') – The mental activity of perceiving cognitive phenomena.
The 14th Dalai Lama has also explicitly laid out his theory of mind as '''experiential dualism''' which is described above under the different types of dualism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Because Tibetan philosophy of mind is ultimately [[soteriology|soteriological]], it focuses on meditative practices such as [[Dzogchen]] and [[Mahamudra]] that allow a practitioner to experience the true reflexive nature of their mind directly. This unobstructed knowledge of one's primordial, empty and non-dual [[Buddha nature]] is called [[rigpa]].  The mind's innermost nature is described among various schools as pure luminosity or "clear light" ([[Ösel (yoga)|'od gsal]]) and is often compared to a crystal ball or a mirror. [[Sogyal Rinpoche]] speaks of mind thus:
"Imagine a sky, empty, spacious, and pure from the beginning; its essence is like this. Imagine a sun, luminous, clear, unobstructed, and spontaneously present; its nature is like this."

====Zen Buddhism====
The central issue in Chinese Zen philosophy of mind is in the difference between the pure and awakened mind and the defiled mind. Chinese Chan master [[Huangbo Xiyun|Huangpo]] described the mind as without beginning and without form or limit while the defiled mind was that which was obscured by attachment to form and concepts.&lt;ref name="Zeuschner"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/HistoricalZen/Understanding_mind_in_NorthernChan.htm|title=Zeuschner, Robert B., "The Understanding of Mind in the Northern Line of Ch'an (Zen)"|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822105440/http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/HistoricalZen/Understanding_mind_in_NorthernChan.htm|archivedate=2012-08-22|df=}}, Philosophy East and West, V. 28, No. 1 (January 1978), pp. 69–79, University of Hawaii Press, Hawaii, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;  The pure Buddha-mind is thus able to see things "as they truly are", as absolute and non-dual "thusness" ([[Tathatā/Dharmatā|Tathatā]]). This non-conceptual seeing also includes the paradoxical fact that there is no difference between a defiled and a pure mind, as well as no difference between [[samsara]] and [[nirvana]].&lt;ref name="Zeuschner"/&gt;

In the [[Shobogenzo]], the Japanese philosopher [[Dogen]] argued that body and mind are neither ontologically nor phenomenologically distinct but are characterized by a oneness called ''shin jin'' (bodymind). According to Dogen, "casting off body and mind" (''Shinjin datsuraku'') in [[zazen]] will allow one to experience things-as-they-are (''genjokoan'') which is the nature of original enlightenment (''[[hongaku]]'').&lt;ref name="Shaner"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/HistoricalZen/Understanding_mind_in_NorthernChan.htm|title=David E.

==Topics related to philosophy of mind==
There are countless subjects that are affected by the ideas developed in the philosophy of mind. Clear examples of this are the nature of [[death]] and its definitive character, the nature of [[emotion]], of [[perception]] and of [[memory]]. Questions about what a [[person]] is and what his or her [[Personal identity|identity]] consists of also have much to do with the philosophy of mind. There are two subjects that, in connection with the philosophy of the mind, have aroused special attention: [[free will]] and the [[self (philosophy)|self]].&lt;ref name="Kim1" /&gt;

===Free will===
{{Main| Free will}}
In the context of philosophy of mind, the problem of free will takes on renewed intensity. This is certainly the case, at least, for materialistic [[determinism|determinists]].&lt;ref name="Kim1" /&gt; According to this position, natural laws completely determine the course of the material world. Mental states, and therefore the will as well, would be material states, which means human behavior and decisions would be completely determined by natural laws. Some take this reasoning a step further: people cannot determine by themselves what they want and what they do. Consequently, they are not free.&lt;ref name="Hond"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytho/dfwIntroIndex.htm | title=Philosopher Ted Honderich's Determinism web resource | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516062050/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytho/dfwIntroIndex.htm | archivedate=2008-05-16 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This argumentation is rejected, on the one hand, by the [[compatibilism|compatibilists]]. Those who adopt this position suggest that the question "Are we free?" can only be answered once we have determined what the term "free" means. The opposite of "free" is not "caused" but "compelled" or "coerced". It is not appropriate to identify freedom with indetermination. A free act is one where the agent could have done otherwise if it had chosen otherwise. In this sense a person can be free even though determinism is true.&lt;ref name="Hond" /&gt; The most important compatibilist in the history of the philosophy was [[David Hume]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Paul, ''Freedom and Moral Sentiment: Hume's Way of Naturalizing Responsibility'' Oxford University Press: New York &amp; Oxford, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, this position is defended, for example, by [[Daniel Dennett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Dennett, Daniel | title=The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting | publisher=Bradford Books–MIT Press |location=Cambridge MA | year=1984 |isbn=978-0-262-54042-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, there are also many [[incompatibilism|incompatibilists]] who reject the argument because they believe that the will is free in a stronger sense called [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarianism]].&lt;ref name="Hond" /&gt; These philosophers affirm the course of the world is either a) not completely determined by natural law where natural law is intercepted by physically independent agency,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=René|last=Descartes|year=1649|title=Passions of the Soul|isbn=978-0-87220-035-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; b) determined by indeterministic natural law only, or c) determined by indeterministic natural law in line with the subjective effort of physically non-reducible agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kane |first=Robert |year=2009 |title=Libertarianism |journal=Philosophical Studies |volume=144 |issue=1 |page=39 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/g2vg712u87804766 |doi= 10.1007/s11098-009-9365-y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Libertarianism, the will does not have to be deterministic and, therefore, it is potentially free. Critics of the second proposition (b) accuse the incompatibilists of using an incoherent concept of freedom. They argue as follows: if our will is not determined by anything, then we desire what we desire by pure chance. And if what we desire is purely accidental, we are not free. So if our will is not determined by anything, we are not free.&lt;ref name="Hond" /&gt;

===Self===
{{Main|Philosophy of self}}
The philosophy of mind also has important consequences for the concept of "self". If by "self" or "I" one refers to an essential, immutable nucleus of the ''person'', some modern philosophers of mind, such as [[Daniel Dennett]] believe that no such thing exists. According to Dennett and other contemporaries, the self is considered an illusion.&lt;ref name="DHof"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dennett, C.  |author2=Hofstadter, D.R.  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=The Mind's I | publisher=Bantam Books | year=1981 |isbn=978-0-553-01412-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a self as an immutable essential nucleus derives from the idea of an [[soul|immaterial soul]]. Such an idea is unacceptable to modern philosophers with physicalist orientations and their general skepticism of the concept of "self" as postulated by [[David Hume]], who could never catch himself ''not'' doing, thinking or feeling anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Searle, John | title=Mind: A Brief Introduction | publisher=Oxford University Press Inc, USA  | date=1 November 2004|isbn=978-0-19-515733-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the light of empirical results from [[developmental psychology]], [[developmental biology]] and [[neuroscience]], the idea of an essential inconstant, material nucleus—an integrated representational system distributed over changing patterns of synaptic connections—seems reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=LeDoux, Joseph | title=The Synaptic Self | location=New York | publisher=Viking Penguin | year=2002 | isbn=978-88-7078-795-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Policy Debate}}
'''Policy debate''' is a form of [[debate#competitive debate|debate competition]]&lt;!-- took away the clarify me because the link now explains better --&gt; in which teams of two advocate for and against a resolution that typically calls for policy change by the United States federal government. It is also referred to as '''cross-examination debate''' (sometimes shortened to '''Cross-X''', '''CX''', '''Cross-ex''', or '''C-X''') because of the 3-minute questioning period following each [[constructive speech]]. Affirmative teams generally present a ''plan'' as a proposal for implementation of the resolution.

High school policy debate is sponsored by various organizations including the [[National Speech and Debate Association]], [[National Association of Urban Debate Leagues]], [[Catholic Forensic League]], [[Stoa USA]], and the [[National Christian Forensics and Communications Association]], as well as many other regional speech organizations. Collegiate policy debates are generally competed under the guidelines of [[National Debate Tournament]] (NDT) and the [[Cross Examination Debate Association]] (CEDA), which have been joined at the collegiate level. A one-person policy format is sanctioned by the [[National Forensic Association]] (NFA) on the collegiate level as well.

==History==
Academic debate had its origins in intracollegiate debating societies, in which students would engage in (often public) debates against their classmates. [[Wake Forest University]]'s debate program claims to have its origins in student literary societies founded on campus in the mid-1830s, which first presented joint "orations" in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abbreviated Timeline: Wake Debate|url=http://groups.wfu.edu/debate/HistoryPages/AbbreviatedTimeline.html|publisher=Wake Forest University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many debating societies that were founded at least as early as the mid-nineteenth century are still active today, though they have generally shifted their focus to intercollegiate competitive debate. In addition to Wake Forest, the debate society at [[Northwestern University]] dates to 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.debate.northwestern.edu |title=Debate Society, School of Communication, Northwestern University |publisher=Debate.northwestern.edu |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boston College]]'s Fulton Debating Society, which was founded in 1868, continues to stage an annual public "Fulton Prize Debate" between teams of its own students after the intercollegiate debate season has ended. Other universities continue similar traditions.

Intercollegiate debates have been held since at least as early as the 1890s. Historical records indicate that debates between teams from [[Wake Forest University]] and Trinity College (later [[Duke University]]) occurred beginning in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Century of Intercollegiate Debate|url=http://groups.wfu.edu/debate/HistoryPages/Intercollegiatedebate.html|publisher=Wake Forest University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a debate between students from Boston College and [[Georgetown University]] occurred on May 1, 1895, in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Donovan|first=Charles F.|title=Debate at Boston College: People, Places, Traditions|date=November 1991|publisher=Boston College, Office of the University Historian|url=http://www.bc.edu/content/dam/files/schools/cas_sites/communication/pdf/Donovan-Debate-history.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Whitman College]] debated [[Washington State University]], [[Willamette University]], and the [[University of Idaho]] in the late 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cat.sckans.edu/frederick_debate/history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051201083247/http://cat.sckans.edu/frederick_debate/history.htm |archivedate=2005-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Southwestern claims that the first debate held on its campus was between Southwestern and Fairmount College (which eventually became [[Wichita State University]]) but that debate could not have occurred prior to 1895, the year Fairmount College began classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webs.wichita.edu/?u=aboutwsu&amp;p=/wsu_history_long/ |title=ABOUT WSU - Wichita State University |publisher=Webs.wichita.edu |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1970s, structured rules for lengths of speeches developed. Each side (affirmative and negative) was afforded two opening "constructive" speeches, and two closing [[Rebuttal speech|"rebuttal" speeches]], for a total of eight speeches per debate. Each speaker was cross-examined by an opponent for a period following his or her constructive speech. Traditionally rebuttals were half the length of constructives, but when a style of faster delivery speed became more standard in the late 1980s this time structure became problematic. Wake Forest University introduced reformed speech times in both its college (9‑6 instead of 10‑5) and high school (8‑5 instead of 8‑4) tournaments, which spread rapidly to become the new [[de facto]] standards.

In 2014, debaters Ameena Ruffin and Korey Johnson made history by being the first black women to win the Cross Examination Debate Association tournament, which is the largest college debate tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Meet The First Black Women to Win a National Debate Conference|url = http://www.essence.com/2014/08/04/meet-first-black-women-win-national-debate-conference|website = Essence.com|access-date = 2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and delivery==

===Speed===
{{main|Spreading (debate)}}

Policy debaters' speed of delivery will vary from league to league and tournament to tournament. In many tournaments, debaters will speak very quickly in order to read as much evidence and make as many arguments as possible within the time-constrained speech. Speed reading or spreading is normal at the majority of national circuit policy debate tournaments.

Some feel that the rapid-fire delivery makes debate harder to understand for the lay person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kang|first=Jay|title=High School Debate at 350 WPM|url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2012/01/ff_debateteam/|publisher=Wired|accessdate=27 March 2012|date=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rapid delivery is encouraged by those who believe that increased quantity and diversity of argumentation makes debates more educational. Others, citing scientific studies, claim that learning to speak faster also increases short- and long-term memory{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}. A slower style is preferred by those who want debates to be understandable to lay people and those who claim that the pedagogical purpose of the activity is to train rhetorical skills. This is often a argument made by those who oppose in-round spreading - that the use of incomprehensible speeds makes debate less appealing to lay people. Many further claim that the increased speed encourages debaters to make several poor arguments, as opposed to a few high-quality ones. Most debaters will vary their rate of delivery depending upon the judge's preferences.

===Flowing===
{{Main|Flow (policy debate)}}
Debaters utilize a specialized form of note taking, called ''flowing'', to keep track of the arguments presented during a debate. Conventionally, debater's flowing is divided into separate ''flows'' for each different argument in the debate round ([[kritik]]s, [[Disadvantage|disads]], [[Topicality (policy debate)|topicalities]], case, etc.). There are multiple methods of flowing but the most common style incorporates columns of arguments made in a given speech which allows the debater to match the next speaker's responses up with the original arguments. Certain shorthands for commonly used words are used to keep up with the rapid rate of delivery. The abbreviations or stand-in symbols vary between debaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cheshire|first=David|title=25 Tips for Taking a Better Flowsheet|journal=Rostrum|year=2000|url=http://debate.uvm.edu/NFL/rostrumlib/CheshierNov00.pdf|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:laptopflowing.jpg|thumb|200px|Judges at the 2007 [[NDT]] using a combination of laptops, quills, and [[papyrus]]]] --&gt;Flowing on a laptop has become more and more popular among high school and college debaters, despite the reservations of certain schools, tournaments, and judges. Some debaters use a basic computer spreadsheet; others use specialized flowing templates, which includes embedded shortcut keys for the most common formatting needs.

==Theory==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009|}}

Although there are many accepted standards in policy debate, there is no written formulation of rules. Sometimes debaters will in fact debate about how policy debate should work. These arguments are known as "theory arguments", and they are most often brought up when one team believes the actions of the other team are unfair and therefore warrant a loss. In more recent years, however, theory arguments have not been nearly as present in the Novice level as before.

===Burdens of the affirmative===

When the Affirmative team presents a plan, they take upon themselves the Burden of Proof to prove that their plan should be adopted. They must prove that their plan is an example of the resolution, and they must prove that the plan is a good idea. The Affirmative traditionally must uphold this burden using evidence from published sources, to avoid ridiculous cases.

====Stock issues====
{{Main|Stock issues}}
One traditional way to judge policy debate states that the affirmative team must win certain issues, called the '''stock issues'''. They are generally interpreted to be as follows:
* '''Disadvantages'''
How many negative disadvantages will the plan have? Will its disadvantages outweigh its advantages?
* '''Solvency'''
Will the plan solve the harms and can it even happen in the real world? How much of an impact will the plan have?
* '''Harms'''
What is the problem in the status quo to justify implementation of the plan? Is the plan important enough to even warrant consideration or make a difference?
* '''Inherency'''
Is the affirmative's plan happening already, and if not, why?
* '''[[Topicality (policy debate)|Topicality]]'''
Is the plan an example of the resolution? Does the affirmative team's proposed policy comply with the wording of the resolution?

The "stock issues" are also commonly described as Significance, Harms, Inherency, Topicality, and Solvency. The "stock issues" are then taught collectively as "The S.H.I.T.S." . Stock issues are taught extensively to novice debaters, but typically become less relevant as debaters move into more complex and less traditional arguments. Stock issues are strongly associated with traditional policy debate, and are typically stressed in advanced debates only if the judge is known to have traditionalist preferences. In some places (notably the West Coast), there is the additional stock issue of disadvantages; or a 'bad thing' that may occur as a result of passing the plan.

==Advantages and disadvantages==

Most affirmative teams today generally frame their case around advantages, which are good effects of their plan. The negative team will often present disadvantages which contend that the affirmative plan causes undesirable consequences. In an attempt to make sure that their advantages/disadvantages outweigh those of the other team, debaters often present extreme scenarios such as the [[Human extinction|extinction of the human race]] or a [[Nuclear warfare|global nuclear war]].

===Negation theory===
Negation Theory contends that the [[negative (policy debate)|negative]] need only negate the [[affirmative (policy debate)|affirmative]] instead of having to negate the [[resolution (policy debate)|resolution]]. The acceptance of negation theory allows negative teams to run arguments such as topical counter plans that may affirm the resolution but still negate the affirmative's specific plan.

===Negative strategy===
After the affirmative presents its case, the negative can attack the case with many different arguments, which include:
* Topicality: The Negative will attempt to argue that the Affirmative team does not fall under the rubric of the resolution and should be rejected immediately regardless of the merits or advantages of the plan. This is a type of "meta-debate" argument, as both sides then spend time defining various words or phrases in the resolution, laying down standards for why their definition(s) or interpretation(s) is superior. Most yearly topics have at least one or two commonly run Affirmative cases that are only arguably topical, so Topicality is often justified as a check or deterrent on and against such plans, which usually have quite strategic components. If run correctly, they are the strongest arguments against case.
* [[Disadvantage]]s: The negative can claim that there are disadvantages, or adverse effects of the plan, which outweigh any advantages claimed. In order to outweigh any positive effects of the affirmative case, impacts must be arguably "larger" than those of the opposing team. The negative must say what is good now, and how the affirmative's plan causes the impact of their disadvantage.
* [[Counterplan]]s: The negative can present a counter solution to the affirmative case's problem which does not have to affirm the resolution (The negative does not have to be topical in making a counterplan). This is generally accompanied by on-case arguments that the affirmative's plan does not solve, as well as disadvantages that link to the affirmative case but not the counterplan. Counterplans narrow down the on-case arguments to: advantages the counterplan can not borrow, the inherency, and the solvency. Upon the negative running a counterplan, most debates boil down to the solvency of the affirmative case, and the disadvantages. Counterplans must be competitive with the plan. This means that the counterplan must either be mutually exclusive with the affirmative (for example, one cannot both increase oil production (a hypothetical plan) and decrease oil production (a hypothetical counterplan) or be undesirable in conjunction with the plan (the negative must win that the inclusion of the plan would cause some form of harm that the counterplan alone would avoid).
* [[Kritik]]s: The negative can claim that the affirmative is guilty of a certain mindset or assumption that should be grounds for rejection or a different mutually exclusive alternative to the Affirmatives plan. Kritiks are sometimes a reason to reject the entire affirmative advocacy without evaluating its policy; other times, kritiks can be evaluated within the same framework for evaluation as the affirmative case. Examples of some areas of literature for kritiks include [[biopower]], [[racism]], [[statism|centralized government]], and [[anthropocentrism]]. Kritiks arose in the early 1990s, with the first kritiks based in [[deconstructionist]] philosophy about the intrinsic ambiguity of language and were championed by debaters Shane Stafford and Bill Shanahan. Kritiks today have evolved to sometimes include the affirmative advocacy within their alternatives. These kritiks argue that the ontological or epistemological assumptions behind the affirmative are flawed and ought to be rejected, but the plan itself is fine. For example, an affirmative could argue that it would be good to reduce our nuclear stockpile to avoid global proliferation out of fear of rogue states acquiring nuclear weapons. The negative could respond with an aff-inclusive kritik that argues that it would be good to reduce our nuclear stockpile because nuclear weapons are unethical, but that we ought not conceptualize other states as fundamentally dangerous.
* Theory: Sometimes the subject matter of the affirmative's case will create an uneven playing field from the beginning. In these cases, the negative can resort to making objections as to the procedure or content of the affirmative case. These objections often are "theoretical" in that they try to make objections based upon what bad can/has come to debate from the infraction.

==Evidence==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Debateimage.jpg|thumb|Tubs of evidence{{pufc|Debateimage.jpg|date=24 January 2013}}]] --&gt;
{{Main|Evidence (policy debate)}}
Evidence in debates is organized into units called ''cards'' (because such evidence was originally printed on note cards, though the practice has long been out of favor). Cards are designed to condense an author's argument so that debaters have an easy way to access the information. A card is composed of three parts: the tag, the cite, and the body. The ''tag'' is the debater's summary of the argument presented in the body. A tag is usually only one or two sentences. The ''cite'' contains all relevant citation information (that is, the author, date of publication, journal, title, etc.). Although every card should contain a complete citation, only the author's name and date of publication are typically spoken aloud in a speech. Some teams will also read the author's qualifications if they wish to emphasize this information. The ''body'' is a fragment of the author's original text. The length of a body can vary greatly—cards can be as short as a few sentences and as long as two or more pages. Most cards are between one and five paragraphs in length. The body of a card is often underlined or highlighted in order to eliminate unnecessary or redundant sentences when the card is read in a round. In a round, the tag is read first, followed by the cite and the body.

As pieces of evidence accumulate use, multiple colors of highlighting and different thicknesses of underlining often occur, sometimes making it difficult to determine which portion of the evidence was read. If debaters stop before finishing the underlined or highlighted portion of a card, it is considered good form to "mark" the card to show where one stopped reading. To otherwise misrepresent how much of a card was read—either by stopping early or by skipping underlined or highlighted sections—is known as "cross-reading" or "clipping" which is generally considered cheating. Although many judges overtly condemn the practice on their paradigms, it is hard to enforce, especially if judges permit debaters to be excessively unclear. Opponents will generally stand behind a debater whom they believe to be cross-reading or clipping, as if waiting to take a card (see below), and silently read along with them in an attempt to get their opponent to stop or the judge to notice.

As cards are read in round, it is common for an opponent to collect and examine even while a speech is still going on. This practice originated in part because cards are read at a rate faster than conversational speed but also because the un-underlined portions of cards are not read in round. Taking the cards during the speech allows the opponent to question the author's qualifications, the original context of the evidence, etc. in [[cross-examination]]. It is generally accepted whichever team is using preparation time has priority to read evidence read previously during a round by both teams. As a result, large amounts of evidence may change hands after the use of preparation time but before a speech. Most judges will not deduct from a team's preparation time for time spent finding evidence which the other team has misplaced.

After a round, judges often "call for cards" to examine evidence whose merit was contested during the round or whose weight was emphasized during rebuttals so that they can read the evidence for themselves. Although widespread, this practice is explicitly banned at some tournaments, most notably [[National Catholic Forensic League]] nationals, and some judges refuse to call for cards because they believe the practice constitutes "doing work for debaters that should have been done during round". Judges may also call for evidence for the purpose of obtaining its citation information so that they can produce the evidence for their own school. Opponents and spectators are also generally allowed to collect citations in this manner, and some tournaments send scouts to rounds to facilitate the collection of cites for every team at the tournament, information which is sometimes published online.

==Judging==

A judge refers to the individual responsible for determining the winner and loser of a policy debate round as well as assessing the relative merit of the participant speakers.  Judges must resolve the complex issues presented in short time while, ideally, avoiding inserting their own personal beliefs that might cloud impartiality. 

Some circuits see ''lay'' or inexperienced judges recruited from the community as an important "part of the game." Debaters in these circuits must be able to adapt from presentations to individuals with no debate experience at all, to judges who have themselves been debaters. This use of lay judges significantly impacts delivery and argumentation as the rapid-fire style and complex debate-theory [[argument]]s are frequently incomprehensible to lay judges. For this reason, other circuits restrict policy debate judging to qualified judges, generally ex-debaters. The use of lay judges, and its impact in speed, presentation and argumentation is a source of great controversy in the US high school debate community.

===Speaker points===
The judge is charged not only with selecting a winner, but also must allot points to each competitor. Known as "speaker points" or simply "speaks", its goal is to provide a numerical evaluation of the debaters' speaking skills. Speaker point schemes vary throughout local state and regional organizations particularly at the high school level. However, the method accepted by most national organizations such as the National Forensic League, Tournament of Champions, National Catholic Forensic League, Cross-Examination Debate Association, and National Debate Tournament, use values ranging from 1 to 30. In practice, within these organizations the standard variation is 26‑29, where 26's are given to extremely poor speakers, where a perfect score is considered incredibly rare and warranted only by an outstanding performance. Most tournaments accept halfpoint gradiations, for example 28.5s. Generally, speaker points are seen as secondary in importance to wins and losses, yet often correlate with a team's win/loss rate. In other words, the judge usually awards the winning team cumulatively higher speaker points than the losing team. If the judge does not, the decision is considered a "low-point win". Low-point wins simply mean that the team with better argumentation spoke worse, but are often rare, because judges will vote for teams that speak better, and award better speaker points to victorious teams.

In some smaller jurisdictions, the judge ranks the speakers 1‑4 instead of awarding them speaker points. Either speaker-point calculation may be used to break ties among teams with like records. Some areas also use speaker rankings in addition to speaker points in order to differentiate between speakers awarded the same number of points.

At a majority of tournaments, debaters also receive "speaker awards", which are awarded to the debaters who received the greatest number of speaker points. Many tournaments also drop the highest and lowest score received by each debater, in order to ensure that the speaker award calculations are fair and consistent, despite the preferences of different judges. The amount of speaker awards given out varies based on the number of debaters competing at any given tournament. For instance, a small local tournament might only award trophies or plaques to the top three debaters, whereas a widely attended "national circuit" tournament might give out awards to the top ten or fifteen speakers.

===Paradigms===
Experienced debate judges (who were generally debaters in high school and/or college) generally carry a mindset that favors certain arguments and styles over others. Depending on what mindset, or paradigm, the judge uses, the debate can be drastically different. Because there is no one view of debate agreed upon by everyone, many debaters question a judge about their paradigm and/or their feelings on specific arguments before the round.

Not every judge fits perfectly into one paradigm or another. A judge may say that they are "tabula rasa" or tab for short, or willing to listen to anything, but draw the line at arguments they consider to be offensive (such as arguments in favor of racism). Or, a judge might be a "policymaker", but still look at the debate in an offense/defense framework like a games-playing judge.

Examples of paradigms include:
* '''Stock issues:''' In order for the affirmative team to win, their plan must retain all of the [[stock issues]], which are Harms, Inherency, Solvency, Topicality, and Significance. For the negative to win, they only need to prove that the affirmative fails to meet one of the stock issues. These judges are more likely to dislike newer arguments such as kritiks and some theoretical points.
* '''Policymaker:''' At the end of the round, the judge compares the affirmative plan with either the negative counterplan or the status quo. Whichever one is a better policy option is the winner. The better policy option is determined by comparing the advantages and disadvantages of each.
* '''''[[Tabula rasa]]''''': From the [[Latin]] for "blank slate", the judge attempts to come into the round with no predispositions. These judges typically expect debaters to "debate it out", which includes telling the judge what paradigm they should view the round in.
* '''Games player:''' Views debate as a game. Judges who use this paradigm tend to be concerned with whether or not each team has a fair chance at winning the debate. They usually view the debate flow as a gameboard, and look at arguments according to an offence/defense structure.
* '''Speaking skills/communications:''' This type of judge is concerned with good presentation and persuasion skills. They tend to vote for teams that are more articulate, and present arguments in the most appealing way. These judges usually disapprove of speed.
* '''Hypothesis tester:''' In order for the affirmative to win, they convince the judge to support the resolution. Conversely, the negative must convince the judge to negate the resolution.
* '''Kritikal:''' Judges who prefer kritik debates and look to who most effectively breaks free from educationally harmful mindset such as [[patriarchy]], [[racism]], or [[orientalism]].

==Competition==
{{Main|Policy debate competitions}}

===Tournaments===
Most high school debaters debate in local tournaments in their city, state or nearby states. Thousands of tournaments are held each year at high schools throughout the US.

A small subset of high school debaters, mostly from elite public and private schools, travel around the country to tournaments in what is called the 'national circuit.' The championship of the national circuit is usually considered to be the [[Tournament of Champions (debate)|Tournament of Champions]], also called the T.O.C, at the [[University of Kentucky]], which requires formal qualification in the form of two or more bids to the tournament. Bids are achieved by reaching a certain level of elimination rounds (for example, quarter-finals) at select, highly competitive, and carefully chosen tournaments across the country based upon the quality of debaters they attract and the diversity of locations from across the United States they represent.

===Urban debate===
[[Urban debate league]]s give students in urban school districts an opportunity to participate in policy debate. There are currently urban debate leagues in 24 of the largest cities in the United States. In total, more than 500 high schools participate in the league and more than 40,000 students have competed in urban debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Urban Debate QuickFacts |url=http://urbandebate.org/quickfacts.shtml |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411183813/http://www.urbandebate.org/quickfacts.shtml |archivedate=April 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Championships===

====High school====

There is some dispute over what constitutes the "national championship" in the United States per se, but two tournaments generally compete for the title:
The [[Tournament of Champions (debate)|Tournament of Champions]] held at the [[University of Kentucky]], and the National Speech and Debate tournament sponsored by the [[National Forensic League]] (now known as the National Speech &amp; Debate Association). For the highest level of competition, the Tournament of Champions is generally considered to be the more prestigious title to hold.
* Other national championships include:
** The Grand National Tournament of the [[National Catholic Forensic League]].
** The National Championship of the [[National Association of Urban Debate Leagues]] (NAUDL).
** The National Debate Coaches' Association Championship (NDCA)
** The [[National Christian Forensics and Communications Association]] (NCFCA)
** The National Invitational Tournament of Champions (NITOC) of [[Stoa USA]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stoausa.org/nitoc-2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106224157/http://www.stoausa.org/nitoc-2011|date=November 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** The National Speech and Debate Association National Tournament (NSDA).

====TFA debate====
In Texas, some debate occurs on the [[Texas Forensic Association]] (TFA) level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Texas Forensics Association|url=http://www.tfa.org|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This organization includes mostly the progressive judging paradigms and favors many off topic arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Debate Shack|url=http://www.angelfire.com/ak/kritiklemur|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  TFA is geared towards the larger schools/programs who tend to be in the suburban areas in the major cities in the eastern part of the state.  The other type of debate is UIL. UIL is open to all public schools throughout Texas.

TFA State policy debate tends to favor a multitude of off-case arguments and teams that favor a progressive style; while UIL State tends to be more policy focused.

====College====
There is no single unified national championship in college debate; though the [[National Debate Tournament]] (NDT), the [[Cross Examination Debate Association]] (CEDA) and the [[American Debate Association]] (ADA) all host national tournaments. The NDT committee issues a ranking report of the top 16 teams in the country ("first round bids") for automatic advancement to the NDT in early February. The report roughly determines a regular season champion called the 'Copeland Award' for the team rated the highest over the course of the year through early February.

===Institutes and camps===
{{Main|Debate camp}}
While once attended by only highly competitive policy debaters, many high school students now attend debate institutes, which are typically held at colleges in the summer. Most institutes range from about two to seven weeks.

Many institutes divide students into work groups, or "labs", based on skill level and experience. Many even offer specialized "advanced" or "scholars" workshops, to which acceptance is highly limited.

==Resolutions==
A '''resolution''' or '''topic''' is a statement which the [[affirmative (policy debate)|affirmative team]] affirms and the [[negative (policy debate)|negative team]] negates. Resolutions are selected annually by affiliated schools. Most resolutions from the 1920s to 2005 have begun "Resolved: that The United States federal government should" although some variations from this structure have been apparent both before the NDT-CEDA merger and with the 2006–2007 college policy debate topic, which limited the affirmative agent to the [[United States Supreme Court]].

At the college level, a number of topics are proposed and interested parties write "topic papers" discussing the pros and cons of that individual topic. Each school then gets one vote on the topic. The single topic area voted on then has a number of proposed topic wordings, one is chosen, and it is debated by affiliated students nationally for the entire season (standard academic school year).

At the high-school level, "topic papers" are also prepared but the voting procedure is different. These papers are then presented to a topic selection committee which rewords each topic and eventually narrows down the number of topics to five topics. Then the five resolutions are put to a two-tiered voting system. State forensic associations, the National Forensic League, and the National Catholic Forensic League all vote on the five topics, narrowing it down to two. Then the two topics are again put to a vote, and one topic is selected.
* The 2010-2011 high school resolution was:

Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially reduce its military and/or police presence in one or more of the following: South Korea, Japan, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Iraq, Turkey.
* The 2011–2012 high school resolution was:

Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase its exploration and/or development of space beyond the Mesosphere.
* The 2012–2013 high school resolution was:

Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase its transportation infrastructure investment in the United States.
* The 2013–2014 high school resolution was:

Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase its economic engagement toward Cuba, Mexico or Venezuela.
* The 2014–2015 high school resolution was:

Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase its non-military exploration and/or development of the Earth's oceans.
* The 2015–2016 high school resolution was:

Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially curtail its domestic surveillance.
* The 2016–2017 high school resolution was:
Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase its economic and/or diplomatic engagement with the People's Republic of China.
* The 2017–2018 high school resolution is:
Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase its funding and/or regulation of primary and/or secondary education in the United States.
* The 2018-2019 high school resolution is:
Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially reduce its restrictions on legal immigration to the United States.

==Event structure==

|}

In addition to speeches, policy debates may allow for a certain amount of preparation time, or "[[prep time]]," during a debate round. NFL rules call for 5&amp;nbsp;minutes of total prep time that can be used, although in practice high school debate tournaments usually give 8&amp;nbsp;minutes of prep time. College debates typically have 10&amp;nbsp;minutes of preparation time. The preparation time is used at each team's preference; they can use different amounts of preparation time before any of their speeches, or even none at all. Prep time can be allocated strategically to intimidate or inconvenience the other team:  for instance, normally a 1AR requires substantial prep time, so a well-executed "stand up 1AR," delivered after no prep time intimidates the negative team and takes away from time that the 2NR may have used to prepare the parts of his/her speech which do not rely on what the 1AR says.

A '''principle''' is a concept or value that is a guide for behavior or evaluation. In [[law]], it is a [[Legal rule|rule]] that has to be or usually is to be followed, or can be desirably followed, or is an inevitable consequence of something, such as the laws observed in  nature or the way that a system is constructed. The principles of such a system are understood by its users as the essential characteristics of the system, or reflecting system's designed purpose, and the effective operation or use of which would be impossible if any one of the principles was to be ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Alpa, Guido (1994) [http://digitalcommons.law.ggu.edu/annlsurvey/vol1/iss1/2/ General Principles of Law], ''Annual Survey of International &amp; Comparative Law'', Vol. 1: Is. 1, Article 2. from [[Golden Gate University School of Law]]&lt;/ref&gt; A system may be explicitly based on and implemented from a document of principles as was done in IBM's [[IBM System/360 architecture|360/370]] ''Principles of Operation''.

Examples of principles are, [[entropy (disambiguation)|entropy]] in a number of fields, [[least action]] in physics, those in descriptive comprehensive and fundamental law: [[doctrine]]s or assumptions forming  normative rules of conduct, [[separation of church and state]] in statecraft, the [[central dogma of molecular biology]], [[wikt:fairness|fairness]] in ethics, etc.

In common English, it is a substantive and collective term referring to rule governance, the absence of which, being "unprincipled", is considered a character defect. It may also be used to declare that a reality has diverged from some ideal or norm as when something is said to be true only "in principle" but not in fact.

==As law==
===As moral law===
[[File:Socrates BM GR1973.03-27.16.jpg|thumb|[[Socrates]] preferred to face execution rather than betray his moral principles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/socrates.html "The Ethics of Socrates."] ''Philosophy''.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;|upright=0.9]]
{{main|Ethics}}
A principle represents values that orient and rule the conduct of persons in a particular society.  To "act on principle" is to act in accordance with one's moral ideals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/politics/jeff-flake-transcript-senate-speech.html "Full Transcript: Jeff Flake’s Speech on the Senate Floor."] ''New York Times''.  24 October 2017.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Principles are absorbed in childhood through a process of [[socialization]]. There is a presumption of liberty of individuals that is restrained.  Exemplary principles include [[First, do no harm]], the [[golden rule]] and the [[doctrine of the mean]].

===As a juridic law===
{{Main|Principle of legality}}
It represents a set of values that inspire the written norms that organize the life of a society submitting to the powers of an authority, generally the State. The law establishes a legal obligation, in a coercive way; it therefore acts as principle [[Classical conditioning|conditioning]] of the action that limits the liberty of the individuals. See, for examples, the [[territorial principle]], [[homestead principle]], and [[precautionary principle]].

===As scientific law===
[[Archimedes principle]], relating buoyancy to the weight of displaced water, is an early example of a  [[law (principle)|law]] in science. Another early one developed by [[Malthus]] is the ''population principle'', now called the [[Malthusian principle]].&lt;ref&gt;Elwell, Frank W.  [http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/users/f/felwell/www/Theorists/Essays/Malthus1.htm "T. Robert Mathus's Principle ...."] ''Rogers State University''.  2013.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud also wrote on principles, especially the [[reality principle]] necessary to keep the id and [[pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]] in check. Biologists use the [[principle of priority]] and [[principle of Binominal nomenclature]] for precision in naming [[species]]. There are many principles observed in physics, notably in [[cosmology]] which observes the [[mediocrity principle]], the [[anthropic principle]], the [[principle of relativity]] and the [[cosmological principle]]. Other well-known principles include the [[uncertainty principle]] in [[quantum mechanics]] and the [[pigeonhole principle]] and [[superposition principle]] in mathematics.

==As axiom or logical fundament==
===Principle of sufficient reason===
{{Main|Principle of sufficient reason}}
The principle states that every event has a rational explanation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sufficient-reason/ "Principle of Sufficient Reason."] ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.  7 September 2016.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The principle has a variety of expressions, all of which are perhaps best summarized by the following:

:For every entity ''x'', if ''x'' exists, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''x'' exists.
:For every event ''e'', if ''e'' occurs, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''e'' occurs.
:For every proposition ''p'', if ''p'' is true, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''p'' is true.

However, one realizes that in every sentence there is a direct relation between the predicate and the subject. To say that "the Earth is round", corresponds to a direct relation between the subject and the predicate.

===Principle of non-contradiction===
[[File:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bust (sculpture)|Portrait bust]] of Aristotle; an [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman]] copy of a lost [[bronze sculpture]] made by [[Lysippos]]]]
{{Main|Law of noncontradiction}}
According to [[Aristotle]], “It is impossible for the same thing to belong and not to belong at the same time to the same thing and in the same respect.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-noncontradiction/ "Aristotle on Non-contradiction."] ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.  12 June 2015.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it is not possible that in exactly the same moment and place, it rains and doesn't rain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl201/modules/Philosophers/Aristotle/aristotle_laws_of_thought.html "Great Philosophers."] ''Oregon State University''.  2002.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle of excluded middle===
{{Main|Law of excluded middle}}
The principle of the excluding third or "principium tertium exclusum" is a principle of the traditional logic formulated canonically by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] as: either ''A'' is ''B'' or ''A'' isn't ''B''. It is read the following way: either ''P'' is true, or its denial ¬''P'' is.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/AAT3201.0001.001|title=Principia mathematica, by Alfred North Whitehead ... and Bertrand Russell.|last=Whitehead|first=Alfred North|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also known as "''tertium non datur''" ('A third (thing) is not). Classically it is considered to be one of the most important fundamental principles or laws of thought (along with the principles of identity, no contradiction and sufficient reason).

In [[logic]], the semantic '''principle (or law) of bivalence''' states that every declarative sentence expressing a proposition (of a theory under inspection) has exactly one [[truth value]], either [[Truth|true]] or [[false (logic)|false]].&lt;ref name="Goble2001bis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Tomassi|title=Logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TUVQr6InyNYC&amp;pg=PA124|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-16696-6|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; A logic satisfying this principle is called a '''two-valued logic'''&lt;ref name="Goble2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lou Goble|title=The Blackwell guide to philosophical logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aaO2f60YAwIC&amp;pg=PA4|year=2001|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0-631-20693-4|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''bivalent logic'''.&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hürlimann2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Hürlimann|title=Dealing with Real-World Complexity: Limits, Enhancements and New Approaches for Policy Makers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_BThojvh-XUC&amp;pg=PA42|year=2009|publisher=Gabler Verlag|isbn=978-3-8349-1493-4|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In formal logic, the principle of bivalence becomes a property that a [[formal semantics (logic)|semantics]] may or may not possess. It is not the same as the [[law of excluded middle]], however, and a semantics may satisfy that law without being bivalent.&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"/&gt;

The principle of bivalence is studied in philosophical logic to address the question of which [[Natural language|natural-language]] statements have a well-defined truth value. Sentences which predict events in the future, and sentences which seem open to interpretation, are particularly difficult for philosophers who hold that the principle of bivalence applies to all declarative natural-language statements.&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"/&gt; [[Many-valued logic]]s formalize ideas that a realistic characterization of the [[Entailment|notion of consequence]] requires the admissibility of premises which, owing to vagueness, temporal or quantum indeterminacy, or reference-failure, cannot be considered classically bivalent. Reference failures can also be addressed by [[free logic]]s.&lt;ref name="GabbayWoods2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dov M. Gabbay|author2=John Woods|title=The Many Valued and Nonmonotonic Turn in Logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3TNj1ZkP3qEC&amp;pg=PA7|accessdate=4 April 2011|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-444-51623-7|page=vii|series=The handbook of the history of logic|volume=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to the law of the excluded middle ==

The principle of bivalence is related to  the [[law of excluded middle]] though the latter is a [[syntactic]] expression of the language of a logic of the form "P ∨ &amp;not;P". The difference between the principle and the law is important because there are logics which validate the law but which do not validate the principle.&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"/&gt; For example, the [[three-valued logic|three-valued]] [[Logic of Paradox]] (LP) validates the law of excluded middle, but not the [[law of non-contradiction]], ¬(P ∧ ¬P), and its [[intended interpretation|intended semantics]] is not bivalent.&lt;ref name="Priest2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Graham Priest|title=An introduction to non-classical logic: from if to is|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rMXVbmAw3YwC&amp;pg=PA124|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85433-7|pages=124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; In classical two-valued logic both the law of excluded middle and the [[law of non-contradiction]] hold.&lt;ref name="Goble2001bis"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lou Goble|title=The Blackwell guide to philosophical logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aaO2f60YAwIC&amp;pg=PA309|year=2001|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0-631-20693-4|page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many modern [[logic programming]] systems replace the law of the excluded middle with the concept of [[negation as failure]].  The programmer may wish to add the law of the excluded middle by explicitly asserting it as true; however, it is not assumed ''a priori''.

== Classical logic ==
The intended semantics of classical logic is bivalent, but this is not true of every [[formal semantics (logic)|semantics]] for classical logic. In [[Boolean-valued semantics]] (for classical [[propositional logic]]), the truth values are the elements of an arbitrary Boolean algebra, "true" corresponds to the maximal element of the algebra, and "false" corresponds to the minimal element. Intermediate elements of the algebra correspond to truth values other than "true" and "false". The principle of bivalence holds only when the Boolean algebra is taken to be the [[two-element Boolean algebra|two-element algebra]], which has no intermediate elements.

Assigning Boolean semantics to classical [[predicate calculus]] requires that the model be a [[complete Boolean algebra]] because the [[universal quantifier]] maps to the [[infimum]] operation, and the [[existential quantifier]] maps to the [[supremum]];&lt;ref name="SørensenUrzyczyn2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Morten Heine Sørensen|author2=Paweł Urzyczyn|title=Lectures on the Curry-Howard isomorphism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_mtnm-9KtbEC&amp;pg=PA206|year=2006|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-444-52077-7|pages=206–207}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is called a [[Boolean-valued model]]. All finite Boolean algebras are complete.

== Suszko's thesis ==
In order to justify his claim that true and false are the only logical values, Suszko (1977) observes that every structural Tarskian many-valued propositional logic can be provided with a bivalent semantics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shramko|first1=Y.|last2=Wansing|first2=H.|title=''Truth Values'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2015|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-values/suszko-thesis.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==

===Future contingents===
{{main|Problem of future contingents}}
A famous example&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"/&gt; is the ''contingent sea battle'' case found in [[Aristotle]]'s work, ''[[De Interpretatione]]'', chapter 9:

: Imagine P refers to the statement "There will be a sea battle tomorrow."

The principle of bivalence here asserts:

: Either it is true that there will be a sea battle tomorrow, or it is false that there will be a sea battle tomorrow.

Aristotle {{clarify|reason=replace with more specific words|text=hesitated|date=March 2016}} to embrace bivalence for such future contingents;{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} [[Chrysippus]], the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] logician, did embrace bivalence for this and all other propositions.  The controversy continues to be of central importance in both the [[philosophy of time]] and the [[philosophy of logic]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

One of the early motivations for the study of many-valued logics has been precisely this issue. In the early 20th century, the Polish formal logician [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] proposed three truth-values: the true, the false and the ''as-yet-undetermined''. This approach was later developed by  [[Arend Heyting]] and [[L. E. J. Brouwer]];&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"/&gt; see [[Łukasiewicz logic]].

Issues such as this have also been addressed in various [[temporal logic]]s, where one can assert that "''Eventually'', either there will be a sea battle tomorrow, or there won't be." (Which is true if "tomorrow" eventually occurs.)

===Vagueness===
Such puzzles as the [[Sorites paradox]] and the related [[continuum fallacy]] have raised doubt as to the applicability of classical logic and the principle of bivalence to concepts that may be vague in their application.  [[Fuzzy logic]] and some other [[multi-valued logic]]s have been proposed as alternatives that handle vague concepts better. Truth (and falsity) in fuzzy logic, for example, comes in varying degrees. Consider the following statement in the circumstance of sorting apples on a moving belt:

: This apple is red.&lt;ref&gt;Note the use of the (extremely) definite article: "This" as opposed to a more-vague "The". If "The" is used, it would have to be accompanied with a pointing-gesture to make it definitive. Ff ''Principia Mathematica'' (2nd edition), p. 91. Russell &amp; Whitehead observe that this " this " indicates "something given in sensation" and as such it shall be considered "elementary".&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon observation, the apple is an undetermined color between yellow and red, or it is motled both colors. Thus the color falls into neither category " red " nor " yellow ", but these are the only categories available to us as we sort the apples. We might say it is "50% red". This could be rephrased: it is 50% true that the apple is red. Therefore, P is 50% true, and 50% false. Now consider:

: This apple is red and it is not-red.

In other words, P and not-P. This violates the law of noncontradiction and, by extension, bivalence. However, this is only a partial rejection of these laws because P is only partially true. If P were 100% true, not-P would be 100% false, and there is no contradiction because P and not-P no longer holds.

However, the law of the excluded middle is retained, because P [[And (logic)|and]] not-P implies P [[Inclusive or|or]] not-P, since "or" is inclusive. The only two cases where P and not-P is false (when P is 100% true or false) are the same cases considered by two-valued logic, and the same rules apply.

'''Example of a 3-valued logic applied to vague (undetermined) cases''': Kleene 1952&lt;ref&gt;Stephen C. Kleene 1952 ''Introduction to Metamathematics'', 6th Reprint 1971, North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam NY, {{isbn|0-7294-2130-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (§64, pp.&amp;nbsp;332–340) offers a 3-valued logic for the cases when algorithms involving partial recursive functions may not return values, but rather end up with circumstances "u" = undecided. He lets "t" = "true", "f" = "false", "u" = "undecided" and redesigns all the propositional connectives. He observes that:

{{quote|We were justified intuitionistically in using the classical 2-valued logic, when we were using the connectives in building primitive and general recursive predicates, since there is a decision procedure for each general recursive predicate; i.e. the law of the excluded middle is proved intuitionistically to apply to general recursive predicates.

Now if Q(x) is a partial recursive predicate, there is a decision procedure for Q(x) on its range of definition, so the law of the excluded middle or excluded "third" (saying that, Q(x) is either t or f) applies intuitionistically on the range of definition. But there may be no algorithm for deciding, given x, whether Q(x) is defined or not. […] Hence it is only classically and not intuitionistically that we have a law of the excluded fourth (saying that, for each x, Q(x) is either t, f, or u).

The third "truth value"  u is thus not on par with the other two t and f in our theory. Consideration of its status will show that we are limited to a special kind of truth table".}}

The following are his "strong tables":&lt;ref&gt;"Strong tables" is Kleene's choice of words. Note that even though " u " may appear for the value of Q or R, " t " or " f " may, in those occasions, appear as a value in " Q V R ", " Q &amp; R " and " Q → R ". "Weak tables" on the other hand, are "regular", meaning they have " u " appear in all cases when the value " u " is applied to either Q or R or both. Kleene notes that these tables are ''not'' the same as the original values of the tables of Łukasiewicz 1920. (Kleene gives these differences on page 335). He also concludes that " u " can mean any or all of the following: "undefined", "unknown (or value immaterial)", "value disregarded for the moment", i.e. it is a third category that does not (ultimately) exclude " t " and " f " (page 335).&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if a determination cannot be made as to whether an apple is red or not-red, then the truth value of the assertion Q: " This apple is red " is " u ". Likewise, the truth value of the assertion R  " This apple is not-red " is " u ". Thus the AND of these into the assertion Q AND R, i.e. " This apple is red AND this apple is not-red " will, per the tables, yield " u ". And, the assertion Q OR R, i.e. " This apple is red OR this apple is not-red " will likewise yield " u ".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3354">The '''principle of plenitude''' asserts that the universe contains all possible forms of existence.  The [[Intellectual history|historian of ideas]] [[Arthur Oncken Lovejoy|Arthur Lovejoy]] was the first to trace the history of this [[philosophy|philosophically]] important principle explicitly.  Lovejoy distinguishes two versions of the principle: a static version, in which the universe displays a constant fullness and diversity, and a temporalized version, in which fullness and diversity gradually increase over time.

Lovejoy traces the principle of plenitude to the writings of [[Plato]], finding in the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' an insistence on "the necessarily complete translation of all the ideal possibilities into actuality".&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy 1936, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;  By contrast, he takes [[Aristotle]] to reject the principle in his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', when he writes that "it is not necessary that everything that is possible should exist in actuality".&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy 1936, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Plato, the principle of plenitude has had the following adherents:

*[[Epicurus]] reiterated the principle in fr.266 [[Hermann Usener|Us.]] His follower [[Lucretius]] (''DRN'' V 526-33 ) famously applied the principle to the sets of multiple explanations by which the Epicureans account for astronomical and meteorological phenomena: every possible explanation is also true, if not in our world, then elsewhere in the infinite universe.
*[[Augustine of Hippo]] brought the principle from [[Neo-Platonic]] thought into early Christian [[Theology]].
*[[St Anselm]]'s [[ontological argument]]s for God's existence used the principle's implication that nature will become as complete as it possibly can be, to argue that existence is a "perfection" in the sense of a completeness or fullness.
*[[Thomas Aquinas]] accepted a modified form of the principle, but qualified it by making several distinctions that safeguard the freedom of God.&lt;ref&gt;

|quote= God creates whatever exists because it is ''fitting'', not because it is ''necessary'' to him, nor because he is ''constrained'' by something outside himself.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Giordano Bruno]]'s insistence on an infinity of worlds was not based on the theories of [[Copernicus]], or on observation, but on the principle applied to God. His death may then be attributed to his conviction of its truth.
*[[Spinoza]], according to Lovejoy, "expressed the principle of plenitude in its most uncompromising form" and "represented it as necessary in the strict logical sense".&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy 1936, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] believed in the principle but not in the possibility of its empirical verification.

The framework suggests four stages – [[awareness]], attraction, [[attachment (psychology)|attachment]] and allegiance to describe how sport and event involvement progressively develops with corresponding behaviours (e.g., playing, watching, buying).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Shilbury, Westerbeek, Quick, Funk| year=2009| title = Strategic Sport Marketing, 3rd ed., p. 41-61, |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|isbn=978-1-74175-626-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The PCM uses a vertical framework to characterise various [[psychological]] connections that individuals form with objects to explain the role of attitude formation and change that directs behaviours across a variety of consumption activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Consumer Behaviour in Sport and Events |author= Daniel C.

==Framework==
[[Image:PsychologicalContinuumModel.JPG|thumb|right|300px|''Please click the box to enlarge'']]

The figure shows the four stages of the PCM - awareness, attraction, attachment and allegiance. On each stage, there is a horizontal decision making process. Inputs (green arrows) influence the internal processing (blue boxes) that creates outputs (yellow arrows). The outcomes are shown in the four different stages of the PCM (grey boxes). The unique decision making process is based upon the level of involvement of the consumer towards a sport/team/event. The following sequence is shown in each stage:

Inputs --&gt; Internal Processing &lt;--&gt; Output

The PCM framework states that, through the processing of internal and external inputs, individuals progress upward along the four psychological connection stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Lock, D., Darcy, S., &amp; Taylor, T.| year=2009| title= ''Starting with a clean slate: An analysis of member identification with a new sports team''| publisher = Sport Management Review, 12, 15-25..}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall evaluation of an object at a specific stage is the product of the processing of personal, psychological and environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Consumer Behaviour in Sport and Events |author= Daniel C. Funk |year=2008|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-7506-8666-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stages==

===Awareness===
{{Infobox
|name         = Infobox/doc
|bodystyle    = 
|title        = Example
|titlestyle   =

|image        = '''John's Awareness'''.
|imagestyle   = 
|caption      = 
John’s introduction to road cycling occurred at the age of 15 through a key socialising agent, his uncle Jack. Jack bought John his first bike, which he rode to school every day. When John was 15 and saw the Tour the France on television, he was amazed by the event. When Jack gave John one of his old road bikes and took him cycling on the weekend, John's progression to the Attraction stage began.
}}
[[Awareness]] stands for the notion when an individual first learns that a certain sport, event or team exists. In this stage the individual has not formed a preference or favourite. The PCM suggests that awareness of sport, teams and events stems from formal and informal channels, for examples parents, friends, school and media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Funk, D. C.| year=2002| title= Consumer-based marketing: The use of micro-segmentation strategies for understanding sport consumption| journal = [[International Journal of Sports Marketing &amp; Sponsorship]] |volume=4 |issue=3|pages=231–256}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases awareness begins during [[childhood]], but can also derive from other socializing agents. The value placed on the specific sport and event from a societal perspective is important in the awareness stage. The examples of ''I know about football'' and ''I know about Liverpool FC'' illustrate the awareness stage box.

===Attraction===
{{Infobox
|name         = Infobox/doc
|bodystyle    = 
|title        = Example
|titlestyle   =

|image        = '''John's Attraction'''.
|imagestyle   = 
|caption      = 
John began to realize that cycling provided him a number of positive outcomes. He was able to meet other cyclists, make new friends and spend time with his uncle. He received pleasure from riding outside and the thrill of riding down hills at fast speed. His self-esteem rose by getting into shape and being one of the fastest riders among his friends. He also enjoyed the break from his daily routine when riding the bike. }}

In the attraction stage, the individual has a favourite sport, event, team or leisure hobby.   Attraction is based upon a number of extrinsic and intrinsic motives.  In other words,  the sport, event, or leisure hobby provides the opportunity to satisfy needs and receive benefits. The motives stem from a combination of personal, psychological and environmental factors. The Attraction processing creates outcomes of positive affect and intentions, as well as engaging in consumption behaviour related to the sport and event. The examples of ''I like football'' and ''I like Liverpool FC'' illustrate the attraction stage box.

===Attachment===
{{Infobox
|name         = Infobox/doc
|bodystyle    = 
|title        = Example
|titlestyle   =

|image        = '''John's Attachment'''.
|imagestyle   = 
|caption      = 
John progresses into the attachment stage relatively quickly and within a year begins riding every Saturday and Sunday morning. Cycling now is an important part in his life. He often wears cycling clothes to class, spent time visiting bike shops and uses the Internet to follow international cycling events. He even joins a cycling club and travels to regional cycling competitions with his friends who are predominantly cyclists.
}}

In the attachment stage the benefits and the sport object are internalised taking on a collective emotional, functional, and symbolic meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Filo, K., Funk, D.C., &amp; O’Brien, D.| year=2009| title= ''The Meaning Behind Attachment: Exploring Camaraderie, Cause, and Competency at a Charity Sport Event''| publisher = Journal of Sport Management, 23, 361-387.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychological connection towards a sport, event, team or leisure hobby strengthens. Internal processes become more important and the influence of socializing agents decreases. Examples for the attachment stage are ''I am a football player'' or ''I am a Liverpool Fan''.

===Allegiance===
{{Infobox
|name         = Infobox/doc
|bodystyle    = 
|title        = Example
|titlestyle   =

|image        = '''John's Allegiance'''.
|imagestyle   = 
|caption      = 
John progressed into the allegiance stage during his last year of college as the strength of his connection to cycling became durable. He thought of cycling and related activities daily. He always found time to ride and follow the sport regardless of university and work requirements or other sport opportunities. John’s psychological connection to cycling has strengthened and is now guiding his behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Funk, D.C., &amp; James, J.| year=2006| title= ''Consumer Loyalty: The Meaning of Attachment in the Development of Sport Team Allegiance''| publisher = Journal of Sport Management, 20, 189-217}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As the attachment processing continues, the internal collective meaning becomes more durable in terms of persistence and resistance and has greater impact on activities and behaviour. This is noted by the examples of ''I live for football'' and ''I live for Liverpool FC'' within the allegiance stage.

[[File:Scientific law versus Scientific theories.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Scientific theories explain why something happens, whereas Scientific Laws record what happens.]]
The '''laws of science''', also called '''[[scientific law]]s''' or '''scientific principles''', are statements that describe or [[prediction|predict]] a range of [[natural phenomena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|law of nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each scientific law is a statement based on [[reproducibility|repeated]] [[experiment]]al [[observation]]s that describes some aspect of the [[Universe]]. The term ''law'' has diverse usage in many cases (approximate, accurate, broad, or narrow [[scientific theory|theories]]) across all fields of [[natural science]] ([[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[geology]], [[astronomy]], etc.). Scientific laws summarize and explain a large collection of facts determined by [[experiment]], and are tested based on their ability to predict the results of future experiments. They are developed either from facts or through [[mathematics]], and are strongly supported by [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] [[evidence]]. It is generally understood that they reflect causal relationships fundamental to reality, and are discovered rather than invented.&lt;ref name="McComas2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=William F. McComas|title=The Language of Science Education: An Expanded Glossary of Key Terms and Concepts in Science Teaching and Learning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aXzGBAAAQBAJ|date=30 December 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-6209-497-0|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws reflect scientific knowledge that experiments have repeatedly verified (and never [[Falsifiability|falsified]]). Their accuracy does not change when new theories are worked out, but rather the scope of application, since the equation (if any) representing the law does not change. As with other scientific knowledge, they do not have absolute certainty (as mathematical [[theorems]] or [[Identity (mathematics)|identities]] do), and it is always possible for a law to be overturned by future observations. A law can usually be formulated as one or several statements or [[equation]]s, so that it can be used to predict the outcome of an experiment, given the circumstances of the processes taking place.

Laws differ from [[hypotheses]] and [[postulates]], which are proposed during the [[Scientific method|scientific process]] before and during validation by experiment and observation. [[Hypotheses]] and [[postulates]] are not laws since they have not been verified to the same degree and may not be sufficiently general, although they may lead to the formulation of laws. A law is a more solidified and formal statement, distilled from repeated experiment. Laws are narrower in scope than [[Scientific theory|scientific theories]], which may contain one or several laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/evolution/education/definitions-fact-theory-law-scientific-work Definitions from the NCSE]&lt;/ref&gt; Science distinguishes a law or theory from facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://dels.nas.edu/resources/static-assets/materials-based-on-reports/reports-in-brief/role_of_theory_final.pdf | title=The Role of Theory in Advancing 21st Century Biology: Catalyzing Transformative Research |publisher = The National Academy of Sciences |year =2007 |journal=Report in Brief |}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calling a law a [[scientific fact|fact]] is [[ambiguous]], an [[overstatement]], or an [[equivocation]].&lt;ref name=gouldfact&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_fact-and-theory.html | first = Stephen Jay | last = Gould | authorlink = Stephen Jay Gould | title  = Evolution as Fact and Theory | journal = Discover | volume = 2 | issue = 5 | date = 1981-05-01 | pages = 34–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the nature of a scientific law is a question in [[philosophy]] and although scientific laws describe nature mathematically, scientific laws are practical conclusions reached by the [[scientific method]]; they are intended to be neither laden with [[ontology|ontological]] commitments nor statements of logical [[wikt:absolute#Noun|absolutes]].

According to the [[unity of science]] thesis, ''all'' scientific laws follow fundamentally from physics. Laws which occur in other sciences ultimately follow from [[physical law]]s. Often, from mathematically fundamental viewpoints, [[universal constant]]s emerge from a scientific law.

==Overview==
A scientific law always applies under the same conditions, and implies that there is a causal relationship involving its elements. [[Scientific fact|Factual]] and well-confirmed statements like "Mercury is liquid at standard temperature and pressure" are considered too specific to qualify as scientific laws. A central problem in the [[philosophy of science]], going back to [[David Hume]], is that of distinguishing causal relationships (such as those implied by laws) from principles that arise due to [[constant conjunction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Laws differ from [[scientific theory|scientific theories]] in that they do not posit a mechanism or explanation of phenomena: they are merely distillations of the results of repeated observation. As such, a law is limited in applicability to circumstances resembling those already observed, and may be found false when extrapolated. [[Ohm's law]] only applies to linear networks, [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] only applies in weak gravitational fields, the early laws of [[aerodynamics]] such as [[Bernoulli's principle]] do not apply in case of [[compressible flow]] such as occurs in [[transonic]] and [[supersonic]] flight, [[Hooke's law]] only applies to [[strain (physics)|strain]] below the [[elastic limit]], etc. These laws remain useful, but only under the conditions where they apply.

Many laws take [[mathematics|mathematical]] forms, and thus can be stated as an equation; for example, the [[law of conservation of energy]] can be written as &lt;math&gt;\Delta E = 0&lt;/math&gt;, where E is the total amount of energy in the universe. Similarly, the [[first law of thermodynamics]] can be written as &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U=\delta Q-\delta W\,&lt;/math&gt;.

The term "scientific law" is traditionally associated with the [[natural sciences]], though the [[social sciences]] also contain laws.&lt;ref name=Ehrenberg&gt;[[Andrew S. C. Ehrenberg]] (1993), "[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v365/n6445/pdf/365385a0.pdf Even the Social Sciences Have Laws]", [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], 365:6445 (30), page 385.{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a scientific law in social sciences is [[Zipf's law]].

Like theories and hypotheses, laws make predictions (specifically, they predict that new observations will conform to the law), and can be [[Falsifiability|falsified]] if they are found in contradiction with new data.

== Conservation laws ==

===Conservation and symmetry===
{{main article|Symmetry (physics)}}

Most significant laws in science are [[conservation laws]]. These fundamental laws follow from homogeneity of space, time and [[phase (waves)|phase]], in other words ''symmetry''.

*'''[[Noether's theorem]]:''' Any quantity which has a continuous differentiable symmetry in the action has an associated conservation law.
* [[Conservation of mass]] was the first law of this type to be understood, since most macroscopic physical processes involving masses, for example collisions of massive particles or fluid flow, provide the apparent belief that mass is conserved. Mass conservation was observed to be true for all chemical reactions. In general this is only approximative, because with the advent of relativity and experiments in nuclear and particle physics: mass can be transformed into energy and vice versa, so mass is not always conserved, but part of the more general conservation of mass-energy.
*'''[[Conservation of energy]]''', '''[[Conservation of momentum|momentum]]''' and '''[[Conservation of angular momentum|angular momentum]]''' for isolated systems can be found to be [[Time translation symmetry|symmetries in time]], translation, and rotation.
*'''[[Conservation of charge]]''' was also realized since charge has never been observed to be created or destroyed, and only found to move from place to place.

===Continuity and transfer===

Conservation laws can be expressed using the general [[continuity equation]] (for a conserved quantity) can be written in differential form as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}=-\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} &lt;/math&gt;

where ρ is some quantity per unit volume, '''J''' is the [[flux]] of that quantity (change in quantity per unit time per unit area). Intuitively, the [[divergence]] (denoted ∇•) of a [[vector field]] is a measure of flux diverging radially outwards from a point, so the negative is the amount piling up at a point, hence the rate of change of density in a region of space must be the amount of flux leaving or collecting in some region (see main article for details). In the table below, the fluxes, flows for various physical quantities in transport, and their associated continuity equations, are collected for comparison.

More general equations are the [[convection–diffusion equation]] and [[Boltzmann transport equation]], which have their roots in the continuity equation.

==Laws of classical mechanics==

===Principle of least action===

{{Main|Principle of least action}}

All of classical mechanics, including [[Newton's laws]], [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange's equations]], [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamilton's equations]], etc., can be derived from this very simple principle:

:&lt;math&gt; \delta \mathcal{S} = \delta\int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}}, t) dt = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[action (physics)|action]]; the integral of the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]]

:&lt;math&gt; L(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}}, t) = T(\mathbf{\dot{q}}, t)-V(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}}, t)&lt;/math&gt;

of the physical system between two times ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The kinetic energy of the system is ''T'' (a function of the rate of change of the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration]] of the system), and [[potential energy]] is ''V'' (a function of the configuration and its rate of change). The configuration of a system which has ''N'' [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] is defined by [[generalized coordinates]] '''q''' = (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''q&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'').

There are [[Canonical coordinates|generalized momenta]] conjugate to these coordinates, '''p''' = (''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;''), where:

:&lt;math&gt;p_i = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i}&lt;/math&gt;

The action and Lagrangian both contain the dynamics of the system for all times. The term "path" simply refers to a curve traced out by the system in terms of the [[generalized coordinates]] in the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]], i.e. the curve '''q'''(''t''), parameterized by time (see also [[parametric equation]] for this concept).

The action is a ''[[functional (mathematics)|functional]]'' rather than a ''[[function (mathematics)|function]]'', since it depends on the Lagrangian, and the Lagrangian depends on the path '''q'''(''t''), so the action depends on the ''entire'' "shape" of the path for all times (in the time interval from ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Between two instants of time, there are infinitely many paths, but one for which the action is stationary (to the first order) is the true path. The stationary value for the ''entire continuum'' of Lagrangian values corresponding to some path, ''not just one value'' of the Lagrangian, is required (in other words it is ''not'' as simple as "differentiating a function and setting it to zero, then solving the equations to find the points of [[maxima and minima]] etc", rather this idea is applied to the entire "shape" of the function, see [[calculus of variations]] for more details on this procedure).&lt;ref&gt;Feynman Lectures on Physics: Volume 2, R.P. Feynman, R.B. Leighton, M. Sands, Addison-Wesley, 1964, {{isbn|0-201-02117-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notice ''L'' is ''not'' the total energy ''E'' of the system due to the difference, rather than the sum:

:&lt;math&gt;E=T+V&lt;/math&gt;

They are equivalent formulations, Newton's is very commonly used due to simplicity, but Hamilton's and Lagrange's equations are more general, and their range can extend into other branches of physics with suitable modifications.

They are low-limit solutions to [[theory of relativity|relativity]]. Alternative formulations of Newtonian mechanics are [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] mechanics.

The laws can be summarized by two equations (since the 1st is a special case of the 2nd, zero resultant acceleration):

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}}{\mathrm{d}t}, \quad \mathbf{F}_{ij}=-\mathbf{F}_{ji} &lt;/math&gt;

For a [[dynamical system]] the two equations (effectively) combine into one:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}_\mathrm{i}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mathbf{F}_{E} + \sum_{\mathrm{i} \neq \mathrm{j}} \mathbf{F}_\mathrm{ij} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==Laws of gravitation and relativity==

===Modern laws===

;[[Special relativity]]

Postulates of special relativity are not "laws" in themselves, but assumptions of their nature in terms of ''relative motion''.

Often two are stated as "the laws of physics are the same in all [[inertial frames]]" and "the [[speed of light]] is constant". However the second is redundant, since the speed of light is predicted by [[Maxwell's equations]]. Essentially there is only one.

The said posulate leads to the [[Lorentz transformations]] – the transformation law between two [[frame of reference]]s moving relative to each other. For any [[4-vector]]

:&lt;math&gt;A' =\Lambda A &lt;/math&gt;

this replaces the [[Galilean transformation]] law from classical mechanics. The Lorentz transformations reduce to the Galilean transformations for low velocities much less than the speed of light ''c''.

The magnitudes of 4-vectors are invariants - ''not'' "conserved", but the same for all inertial frames (i.e. every observer in an inertial frame will agree on the same value), in particular if ''A'' is the [[four-momentum]], the magnitude can derive the famous invariant equation for mass-energy and momentum conservation (see [[invariant mass]]):

:&lt;math&gt; E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

in which the (more famous) [[mass-energy equivalence]] ''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a special case.

;[[General relativity]]

General relativity is governed by the [[Einstein field equation]]s, which describe the curvature of space-time due to mass-energy equivalent to the gravitational field. Solving the equation for the geometry of space warped due to the mass distribution gives the [[metric tensor]]. Using the geodesic equation, the motion of masses falling along the geodesics can be calculated.

;[[Gravitomagnetism]]

In a relatively flat spacetime due to weak gravitational fields, gravitational analogues of Maxwell's equations can be found; the '''GEM equations''', to describe an analogous ''[[Gravitomagnetism|gravitomagnetic field]]''. They are well established by the theory, and experimental tests form ongoing research.&lt;ref name="Gravitation and Inertia"&gt;Gravitation and Inertia, I. Ciufolini and J.A.

These equations can be modified to include [[magnetic monopole]]s, and are consistent with our observations of monopoles either existing or not existing; if they do not exist, the generalized equations reduce to the ones above, if they do, the equations become fully symmetric in electric and magnetic charges and currents. Indeed, there is a duality transformation where electric and magnetic charges can be "rotated into one another", and still satisfy Maxwell's equations.

;Pre-Maxwell laws

These laws were found before the formulation of Maxwell's equations. They are not fundamental, since they can be derived from Maxwell's Equations. Coulomb's Law can be found from Gauss' Law (electrostatic form) and the Biot–Savart Law can be deduced from Ampere's Law (magnetostatic form). Lenz' Law and Faraday's Law can be incorporated into the Maxwell-Faraday equation. Nonetheless they are still very effective for simple calculations.

== Laws of quantum mechanics==

Quantum mechanics has its roots in [[postulates of quantum mechanics|postulates]]. This leads to results which are not usually called "laws", but hold the same status, in that all of quantum mechanics follows from them.

One postulate that a particle (or a system of many particles) is described by a [[wavefunction]], and this satisfies a quantum wave equation: namely the [[Schrödinger equation]] (which can be written as a non-relativistic wave equation, or a [[relativistic wave equation]]). Solving this wave equation predicts the time-evolution of the system's behaviour, analogous to solving Newton's laws in classical mechanics.

Other postulates change the idea of physical observables; using [[operators (physics)|quantum operators]]; some measurements can't be made at the same instant of time ([[Uncertainty principle]]s), particles are fundamentally indistinguishable. Another postulate; the [[wavefunction collapse]] postulate, counters the usual idea of a measurement in science.

== Laws of chemistry ==
{{Main|Chemical law}}

'''Chemical laws''' are those [[natural law|laws of nature]] relevant to [[chemistry]]. Historically, observations led to many empirical laws, though now it is known that chemistry has its foundations in [[quantum mechanics]].

;[[Quantitative analysis (chemistry)|Quantitative analysis]]

The most fundamental concept in chemistry is the [[law of conservation of mass]], which states that there is no detectable change in the quantity of matter during an ordinary [[chemical reaction]]. Modern physics shows that it is actually [[energy]] that is conserved, and that [[Mass–energy equivalence|energy and mass are related]]; a concept which becomes important in [[nuclear chemistry]]. [[Conservation of energy]] leads to the important concepts of [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]], [[thermodynamics]], and [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]].

Additional laws of chemistry elaborate on the law of conservation of mass.  [[Joseph Proust]]'s [[law of definite composition]] says that pure chemicals are composed of elements in a definite formulation; we now know that the structural arrangement of these elements is also important.

[[John Dalton|Dalton]]'s [[law of multiple proportions]] says that these chemicals will present themselves in proportions that are small whole numbers (i.e. 1:2 for [[Oxygen]]:[[Hydrogen]] ratio in water); although in many systems (notably [[Biomolecule|biomacromolecules]] and [[minerals]]) the ratios tend to require large numbers, and are frequently represented as a fraction.

More modern laws of chemistry define the relationship between energy and its transformations.

;[[Reaction kinetics]] and [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibria]]

* In equilibrium, molecules exist in mixture defined by the transformations possible on the timescale of the equilibrium, and are in a ratio defined by the intrinsic energy of the molecules—the lower the intrinsic energy, the more abundant the molecule. [[Le Chatelier's principle]] states that the system opposes changes in conditions from equilibrium states, i.e. there is an opposition to change the state of an equilibrium reaction.
* Transforming one structure to another requires the input of energy to cross an energy barrier; this can come from the intrinsic energy of the molecules themselves, or from an external source which will generally accelerate transformations.  The higher the energy barrier, the slower the transformation occurs.
* There is a hypothetical intermediate, or ''transition structure'', that corresponds to the structure at the top of the energy barrier.  The [[Hammond's postulate|Hammond–Leffler postulate]] states that this structure looks most similar to the product or starting material which has intrinsic energy closest to that of the energy barrier.  Stabilizing this hypothetical intermediate through chemical interaction is one way to achieve [[catalysis]].
* All chemical processes are reversible (law of [[microscopic reversibility]]) although some processes have such an energy bias, they are essentially irreversible.
* The reaction rate has the mathematical parameter known as the [[rate constant]]. The [[Arrhenius equation]] gives the temperature and [[activation energy]] dependence of the rate constant, an empirical law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9918">In [[mathematics]], '''signed measure''' is a generalization of the concept of [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] by allowing it to have [[negative and positive numbers|negative]] values. Some authors may call it a '''charge,'''&lt;ref&gt;A charge need not be countably additive: it can be only [[Sigma additivity#Additive (or finitely additive) set functions|finitely additive]]. See reference {{Harvnb|Bhaskara Rao|Bhaskara Rao|1983}} for a comprehensive introduction to the subject.&lt;/ref&gt; by analogy with [[electric charge]], which is a familiar distribution that takes on positive and negative values.

==Definition==
There are two slightly different concepts of a signed measure, depending on whether or not one allows it to take infinite values.  In research papers and advanced books signed measures are usually only allowed to take finite values, while undergraduate textbooks often allow them to take infinite values. To avoid confusion, this article will call these two cases "finite signed measures" and "extended signed measures".

Given a [[measurable space]] (''X'', Σ), that is, a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''X'' with a [[sigma algebra]] Σ on it, an '''extended signed measure''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mu:\Sigma\to \mathbb {R}\cup\{\infty,-\infty\}&lt;/math&gt;
such that &lt;math&gt;\mu(\emptyset)=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; is [[sigma additivity|sigma additive]], that is, it satisfies the equality
:&lt;math&gt; \mu\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_n\right) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \mu(A_n)&lt;/math&gt;
where the series on the right must converge absolutely, for any [[sequence]]  ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ... of [[disjoint set]]s in Σ. One consequence is that any extended signed measure can take +∞ as value, or it can take &amp;minus;∞ as value, but both are not available. The expression ∞&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;∞ is undefined &lt;ref&gt;See the article "''[[Extended real number line#Arithmetic operations|Extended real number line]]''" for more information.&lt;/ref&gt; and must be avoided.

A '''finite signed measure''' (aka. '''real measure''') is defined in the same way, except that it is only allowed to take real values. That is, it cannot take +∞ or &amp;minus;∞.

Finite signed measures form a vector space, while extended signed measures are not even closed under addition, which makes them rather hard to work with. On the other hand,  measures are extended signed measures, but are not in general finite signed measures.

==Examples==
Consider a nonnegative measure ν on the space (''X'', Σ) and a [[measurable function]] ''f'':''X''→ '''R''' such that

:&lt;math&gt;\int_X \! |f(x)| \, d\nu (x) &lt; \infty. &lt;/math&gt;

Then, a finite signed measure is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mu (A) = \int_A \! f(x) \, d\nu (x) &lt;/math&gt;

for all ''A'' in Σ.

This signed measure takes only finite values. To allow it to take +∞ as a value, one needs to replace the assumption about ''f'' being absolutely integrable with the more relaxed condition

:&lt;math&gt;\int_X \! f^-(x) \, d\nu (x) &lt; \infty, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') = max(&amp;minus;''f''(''x''), 0) is the [[positive and negative parts|negative part]] of ''f''.

==Properties==

What follows are two results which will imply that an extended signed measure is the difference of two nonnegative measures, and a finite signed measure is the difference of two finite non-negative measures.

The [[Hahn decomposition theorem]] states that given a signed measure μ, there exist two measurable sets ''P'' and ''N'' such that:

#''P''∪''N'' = ''X'' and  ''P''∩''N'' = ∅;
#μ(''E'') ≥ 0 for each ''E'' in Σ such that ''E'' ⊆ ''P'' &amp;mdash; in other words, ''P'' is a [[positive and negative sets|positive set]];
#μ(''E'') ≤ 0 for each ''E'' in Σ such that ''E'' ⊆ ''N'' &amp;mdash; that is, ''N'' is a negative set.
Moreover, this decomposition is unique [[up to]] adding to/subtracting μ-[[null set]]s from ''P'' and ''N''.

Consider then two nonnegative measures μ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and μ&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; defined by

:&lt;math&gt; \mu^+(E) = \mu(P\cap E)&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; \mu^-(E)=-\mu(N\cap E)&lt;/math&gt;

for all measurable sets ''E'', that is, ''E'' in Σ.

One can check that both μ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and μ&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; are nonnegative measures, with one taking only finite values, and are called the ''positive part'' and ''negative part'' of μ, respectively. One has that μ = μ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; - μ&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. The measure  |μ| = μ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + μ&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is called the ''variation'' of μ, and its maximum possible value, ||μ|| = |μ|(''X''), is called the ''[[total variation]]'' of μ.

This consequence of the Hahn decomposition theorem is called the ''Jordan decomposition''. The measures μ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, μ&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and  |μ| are independent of the choice of ''P'' and ''N'' in the Hahn decomposition theorem.

==The space of signed measures==

The sum of two finite signed measures is a finite signed measure, as is the product of a finite signed measure by a real number: they are closed under [[linear combination]]. It follows that the set of finite signed measures on a measurable space (''X'', Σ) is a real [[vector space]]; this is in contrast to positive measures, which are only closed under [[conical combination]], and thus form a [[convex cone]] but not a vector space. Furthermore, the [[total variation]] defines a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] in respect to which the space of finite signed measures becomes a [[Banach space]]. This space has even more structure, in that it can be shown to be a [[Dedekind complete]] [[Riesz space|Banach lattice]] and in so doing the [[Radon–Nikodym theorem]] can be shown to be a special case of the [[Freudenthal spectral theorem]].

If ''X'' is a compact separable space, then the space of finite signed Baire measures is the dual of the real Banach space of all continuous real-valued functions on ''X'', by the  [[Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation theorem]].

[[File:ToK Simple.jpg|thumb|379px|Gregg Henriques' Tree of Knowledge System]]

The '''tree of knowledge''' ('''ToK''') '''system''' is a theoretical approach to the unification of [[psychology]] developed by [[Gregg Henriques]], associate professor and director of the Combined-Integrated Doctoral Program in Clinical and School Psychology at [[James Madison University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/about%20me.htm "About Me" section of the ToK System website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The outline of the system was published in 2003 in ''[[Review of General Psychology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt; Two special issues of the ''[[Journal of Clinical Psychology]]'' in December 2004&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/jissue/109747885 ''Journal of Clinical Psychology''. (December 2004). Special Issue: Defining Psychology: Articles and Commentaries on a New Unified Theory (Part 1) Issue Edited by Gregg R. Henriques. Volume 60 Issue 12, Pages 1203 – 1315]&lt;/ref&gt; and January 2005&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/jissue/109856879 ''Journal of Clinical Psychology''. (January 2005). Special Issue: Defining Psychology: Articles and Commentaries on a New Unified Theory (Part 2) Issue Edited by Gregg R. Henriques. Volume 61 Issue 1, Pages 1 – 139 ]&lt;/ref&gt; were devoted to the elaboration and evaluation of the model. The latest evaluation of this model appeared in a December 2008 special issue of ''[[Theory &amp; Psychology']]'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tap.sagepub.com/content/vol18/issue6/ ''Theory &amp; Psychology''. (December 2008). Volume 18, No. 6]&lt;/ref&gt;

The official website on the tree of knowledge system claims that the ToK is

:''a new unified theory of knowledge that maps the pieces of the scientific puzzle in a novel way that connects Quantum Mechanics to Sociological processes and everything in between into a coherent whole. The most novel aspect of the ToK is its visuo-spatial depiction of knowledge as consisting of four dimensions of complexity (Matter, Life, Mind, and Culture) that correspond to the behavior of four classes of objects (material objects, organisms, animals, and humans), and four classes of science (physical, biological, psychological, and social).''&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/other%20research.htm ToK FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "problem of psychology"==
Henriques argues that the most difficult problem in psychology as a discipline is that while there is incredible diversity offered by different approaches to psychology, there is no consensus model of what ''psychology'' actually is.&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The tree of knowledge system and the theoretical unification of psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2004). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/Psych%20Defined.pdf Psychology Defined]. ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, 60,'' 1207–1221.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to the ToK system, the "problem of psychology", (as Henriques puts it), is that a clear definition, an agreed upon subject matter, and a coherent conceptual framework have eluded its students for its entire [[history of psychology|history]]. He further argues that the patent tendency of psychology has been toward theoretical and substantial fragmentation and increasing insularity among the "specialties." In other words, the discipline has fragmented into [[psychological schools|different schools of thought]] and methodology, with no overall framework to interpret and integrate the research of different areas. At its best, the different approaches are a strength of psychology; different approaches lead to novel ideas, and prevent psychologists from clinging to a paradigm that fails to explain a phenomenon. At its worst, adherents of one particular school cling to their beliefs concerning the relative importance of their research and disregard or are ignorant of different approaches. In most cases, individual psychologists have to determine for themselves which elements of which perspective to apply, and how to integrate them into their overall understanding.
 
The reason for psychology's fragmentation, according to the ToK, is that there has been no [[metatheory|meta-theoretical]] frame that allows scholars to agree on the basic questions that need to be addressed. As such, the different schools of thought in psychology are like the blind men who each grab a part of the elephant and proclaim they have discovered its true nature. With its novel depiction of evolving dimensions of complexity, the ToK allows scholars finally to see the elephant. In his 2003 ''Review of General Psychology'' paper,&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The tree of knowledge system and the theoretical unification of psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt; Henriques used the ToK System with the attempt to clarify and align the views of [[B.F. Skinner]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]. These luminaries were chosen because when one considers their influence and historical opposition, it can readily be argued that they represent two schools of thought that are the most difficult to integrate. Henriques used the meta-perspective offered by the ToK to argue how one can retain the key insights from each school of thought, identify errors and points of confusion, and integrate the insights into a coherent whole.

Cultural and personality psychologist, Michael Katzko,&lt;ref&gt;[http://baserv.uci.kun.nl/~mwsk49/ Homepage of Michael Katzko]&lt;/ref&gt; however critiques Henriques' position on "the problem of psychology":

:''There is a very good reason for skepticism regarding the repeated claims that the one unique problem of psychology, applicable across the entire discipline, has been identified and that the ToK System solves it. The reason is given by the detail with which alternatives have been worked out, be they historical studies of institutional development or critical commentaries on the rhetorical structure of psychology's literature.''&lt;ref&gt;Katzko, M.W. (2008). Pruning the Tree of Knowledge. ''Theory &amp; Psychology, 18,'' 817–828. [http://tap.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/18/6/817 Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tree of knowledge==
In one way, the tree of knowledge system reflects a fairly common hierarchy of nature and of the sciences that has been represented in one way or another since the time of [[Auguste Comte]], who in the 19th century used a hierarchical conception of nature to argue for the existence of sociology. Despite its surface agreement with a standard conception, the ToK System offers a set of ideas that have added implications for both [[ontology]] and [[epistemology]]. The ontological claim made by the ToK, (and [[#top|depicted pictorially above]]), is that [[Physical cosmology|cosmic evolution]] consists of four separable dimensions of complexity, namely [[matter]], life, [[mind]], and culture. The dimension of complexity argument is arguably one of the most complicated aspects of the system. Many have argued nature is hierarchically leveled; for example, a list of such levels might be [[subatomic particles]], [[atoms]], [[molecule]]s, [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, organ structures, multi-celled organisms, [[consciousness]], and society is common. The ToK System embraces a view of nature as levels, but adds the notion that there are also ''dimensions of complexity''. The difference can be seen pictorially. A view of nature as solely consisting of levels would have a single "cone" of complexity, whereas the ToK depicts four "cones". The ToK posits that a separate dimension of complexity emerges when a process of selection operates on a unit of information. Thus, according to the ToK, [[natural selection]] operating on genetic combinations gives rise to the dimension of Life; [[Radical behaviorism|behavioral selection]] operating on [[neuron]]al combinations gives rise to the dimension of Mind; and [[theory of justification|justification]] operating on [[symbol]]ic combinations gives rise to Culture.

The ToK system also offers a new epistemology that Henriques believes will move toward what [[E.O. Wilson]] termed ''[[consilience]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, E.O. (1999). ''[[Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge]]''. Vintage:USA&lt;/ref&gt; Consilience is the interlocking of fact and theory into a coherent, holistic view of knowledge. The ToK offers alternative perspectives on how knowledge is obtained because it depicts science itself as both emerging out of culture and as a unique type of "justification system" that is based on the values of [[accuracy]] and [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]].&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2008). The problem of psychology and the integration of human knowledge: Contrasting Wilson's Consilience with the ToK system. ''Theory &amp; Psychology, 18,'' 731–755. [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/PPIHPRevised.pdf Final draft]&lt;/ref&gt; A "justification system", according to Henriques, refers to any belief system that emerges that coordinates the behaviors of individual humans to human populations. The four dimensions of complexity correspond to four broad classes of science: the [[physical science|physical]], [[biology|biological]], [[psychology|psychological]] and [[social science]]s.

===Matter===

The dimension of [[matter]] refers to the set of material objects and their behaviors through time. In accordance with modern [[cosmology]], matter is theorized to have emerged from a pure energy [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]] at the [[Big Bang]]. [[Space-time|Space and time]] were also born at such a point. Nonliving material objects range in complexity from [[subatomic particle]]s to large organic molecules. The physical sciences (i.e., [[physics]], [[chemistry]], geology, [[astronomy]]) describe the behavior of material objects.&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life===

The dimension of life refers to [[organism]]s and their behaviors through time. Living objects are considered a unique subset of material objects. Just as [[quantum particle]]s form the fundamental units of material complexity, [[gene]]s are the fundamental units of living information. Although many questions about the emergence of life remain unanswered, in accordance with modern biology, the ToK posits that natural selection operating on genetic combinations through time is the unified theory of biology and forms the foundational understanding for the emergence of organic complexity.&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mind===

Mind/cognition in the ToK system refers to the set of mental behaviors. ''Mental behaviors'' are behaviors of animals mediated by the [[nervous system]] that produce a functional effect on the animal-environment relationship. As such, Mind/cognition is essentially synonymous with what behavioral psychologists have meant when they use the term behavior. Thus, a fly avoiding a fly swatter, a rat pushing a bar or a human getting a drink of water are all mental behaviors. Mind is not synonymous with [[sentience]] or the capacity for mental experience, although such processes are presumed to emerge in the mental/cognitive dimension. [[Cognition]], in the broad sense of the term is meaning bodily-neuro-social information processing, as in EEEE Cognition: Embodied, Embedded, Enactive, Extended. While cognitive science stands for naturalist study of mind, psychology is an approach grounded in the tradition of humanities, especially philosophy. Thus, by defining mind as mental behavior, Henriques argues that the ToK System provides a way to bridge the epistemological differences between [[cognitive science|cognitive]] and [[behaviorism|behavioral science]].&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture===

Culture in the ToK system refers to the set of [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] behaviors, which range from large scale nation states to individual human justifications for particular actions. Just as genetic information processing is associated with the Life dimension and neuronal information processing associated with the Mind dimension, symbolic information processing emerges with the Cultural dimension.&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical joint points==

===Quantum gravity===
{{main|Quantum gravity}}

'''Quantum gravity''' refers to the imagined merger between the twin pillars of physical science which are [[quantum mechanics]], the study of the microscopic (e.g., electrons), and [[general relativity]], the science of the macroscopic (e.g., [[galaxy|galaxies]]). Currently, these two great domains of science cannot be effectively interwoven into a single, physical [[Theory of Everything]]. Yet progress is being made, most notably through [[string theory]], [[loop quantum gravity]], [[black hole thermodynamics]] and the study of the early universe. Some of the difficulties combining these two pillars of physical science are philosophical in nature and it is possible that the macro view of knowledge offered by the ToK may eventually aid in the construction of a coherent theory of quantum gravity. The reason the ToK might help is that it locates scientific knowledge in relationship to the physical universe.

===The modern synthesis===
{{main|Modern synthesis (20th century)|l1=The Modern Synthesis}}

The '''modern synthesis''' refers to the merger of genetics with [[natural selection]] which occurred in the 1930s and 1940s and offers a reasonably complete framework for understanding the emergence of biological complexity. Although there remain significant gaps in biological knowledge surrounding questions such as the origin of life and the emergence of sexual reproduction, the modern synthesis represents the most complete and well-substantiated joint point.

===Behavioral investment theory===

'''Behavioral investment theory''' ('''BIT''') is proposed as a merger of the selection science of [[behaviorism]] with the information science of [[cognitive neuroscience]] (notice the parallel with the modern synthesis). BIT posits that the nervous system evolved as an increasingly flexible computational control system that coordinates the behavioral expenditure of energy of the animal as a whole. Expenditure of behavioral energy is theorized to be computed on an investment value system built evolutionarily through natural selection operating on genetic combinations and [[ontogeny|ontogenetically]] through behavioral selection operating on neural combinations. As such, the current behavioral investments of the animal are conceptualized as the joint product of the two vectors of [[phylogeny]] and [[ontogeny]]. A unique element of BIT is that it finds a core of agreement and builds bridges between five brain-behavior paradigms: (1) [[cognitive science]]; (2) [[behavioral science]]; (3) evolutionary theory and genetics; (4) neuroscience; and (5) [[cybernetics]]/[[systems theory]].

[[David C. Geary]] noted the similarities between his "motive-to-control" hypothesis and Henriques' Behavioral Investment Theory, which were developed independently of each other. Furthermore, Geary suggested that his model "seem[ed] to fill in many of the [[proximate causation|proximate mechanisms]] and evolutionary pressures that define the life-mind joint point, and provided a framework for further development of the mind-culture joint point."&lt;ref&gt;Geary, D. C. (2005).

===Justification hypothesis===

The '''justification hypothesis''' ('''JH''') is a novel proposal that allows for both the understanding of the evolution of culture and for identifying what makes humans distinct animals. A basic initial claim of the JH is that the process of justification is a crucial component of human mental behavior at both the individual and societal level. Unlike all other animals, humans everywhere ask for and give explanations for their actions. Arguments, debates, moral dictates, rationalizations, and excuses all involve the process of explaining why one's claims, thoughts or actions are warranted. In virtually every form of social exchange, from warfare to politics to family struggles to science, humans are constantly justifying their behavioral investments to themselves and others.

The JH can be stated succinctly as follows: The evolution of language gave rise to the problem of justification, and this evolutionary pressure ultimately resulted in the human self-consciousness system and human culture. The JH carries with it three fundamental postulates. 
*The first is that the evolution of language must have created the problem of justification, which is the problem of explaining one’s self to others in a justifiable manner.
*The second postulate is that the human self-consciousness system can be understood as a “justification filter”. This second claim links the evolutionary analysis with key insights from [[psychodynamic theory]]. Specifically, psychodynamic theory posits that socially unjustifiable impulses are inhibited and socially justifiable reasons are given for actions taken.
*The third postulate is that culture can be understood as large scale justification systems that coordinate the behavior of human populations. Cultural systems are seen to evolve much in the same way as organisms do in biological evolution: there is a process of variation, selection and retention of belief systems.

==How the ToK solves the problem of psychology==

The problem of psychology, according to the ToK, is its conceptual incoherence, which Henriques identifies by the following: 
:(1) There is no agreed upon definition.
:(2) There is no agreed upon subject matter.
:(3) There is a proliferation of overlapping and redundant concepts.
:(4) There are a large number of paradigms with fundamentally different epistemological assumptions.
:(5) Specialization continues to be increasingly emphasized at the expense of generalization and thus the problem of fragmentation only grows.

When the various conceptions of psychology (e.g., behavioral, humanistic, cognitive) are viewed through the lens of the ToK System, psychology spans two different dimensions of complexity: the mental and the cultural. In other words, the discipline has historically spanned two fundamentally separate problems: 
:(1) the problem of animal behavior in general, and
:(2) the problem of human behavior at the individual level.
 
If, as previously thought, nature simply consisted of levels of complexity, psychology would not be crisply defined in relationship to biology or the social sciences. And, indeed, it is frequently suggested that psychology exists in an amorphous space between biology and the social sciences. However, with its dimension of complexity depiction, the ToK System suggests that psychology can be crisply defined as the science of mind, which is the third dimension of complexity. Furthermore, because human behavior exists in the fourth dimension, psychology must be divided into two broad scientific domains of 
:(1) psychological formalism and
:(2) human psychology.

''Psychological formalism'' is defined as the science of mind and corresponds to the behavior of animal objects. ''Human psychology'' is considered to be a unique subset of psychological formalism that deals with human behavior at the level of the individual. Because human behavior is immersed in the larger socio-cultural context (level four in the ToK System), human psychology is considered a hybrid discipline that merges the pure science of psychology with the social sciences. It is important to point out that there are other disciplines the ToK System would classify as “hybrids.” Molecular genetics, for example, is a hybrid between chemistry and biology and neuroscience is a hybrid between biology and psychology. As with Henriques' proposed conception of human psychology, both of these disciplines adopt an object level perspective (molecular and cellular, respectively) on phenomena that simultaneously exist as part of meta-level system processes (life and mind, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2004). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/Psych%20Defined.pdf Psychology Defined]. ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, 60,'' 1207–1221.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though David A. F. Haaga "congratulate[d] Dr. Henriques' ambitious, scholarly, provocative paper", and "found the Tree of Knowledge taxonomy, the theoretical joint points, the evolutionary history, and the levels of emergent properties highly illuminating", he asks the rhetorical questions, 
:''If it is so difficult to define terms such as 'psychology' with such precision, why bother? Why not just agree that we all have at least a rough idea of what psychology is, and take the rest of the afternoon off? After all, if theoretical or empirical work improves our understanding of some aspect of the world or our fellow people, or improves our ability to help people enhance their physical or emotional well being, what difference does it make whether this work is considered a part of psychology, of cognitive science, of behavioral neuroscience, of public health, or what have you? This raises the question of what definitions in general are good for.''&lt;ref&gt;Haaga, D.A.F. (2004). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/Related%20Articles/Defining%20Psychology.pdf Defining psychology: What can it do for us?] ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, 60,'' 1227–1230.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar vein, Scott O. Lilienfeld, who described Henriques' effort as "thoughtful", contended that psychology is "an inherently fuzzy concept that resists precise definition" and that "attempts to define psychology [would be] likely to hamper rather than foster consilience across disciplines". Lilienfield went on further to suggest that the scientist-practitioner gap in psychology lies not in definitional issues, but in different "epistemic attitudes" between these two groups. He stated that scientists have an epistemic attitude of [[empiricism]], (where questions regarding human nature are settled by scientific evidence), and that practitioners have an epistemic attitude of [[romanticism]], (where questions of human nature are settled by intuition). Lilienfeld suggested that the solution to the scientist-practitioner gulf isn't definitional, but in "train[ing] future clinical scientists to appreciate the proper places of romanticism and empiricism within science".&lt;ref&gt;Lilienfeld, S.O. (2004). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/Related%20Articles/Is%20it%20worth%20the%20trouble.pdf Defining psychology: Is it worth the trouble?] ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, 60,'' 1249–1253.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consciousness and human behavior==

A frequent question and point of confusion in the ToK System is the definition and meaning of [[consciousness]]. As mentioned above, mind is not synonymous with consciousness. And, to understand consciousness from a ToK vantage point, it is crucial to recognize that the term is often ambiguous in its meaning. Two primary meanings are [[sentience]], which is the capacity for mental experience and [[self-awareness]], which is the capacity to be aware of one's awareness. Sentience is conceptualized as a "level 3" phenomena, possessed by many animals other than humans and is defined as a "perceived" electro-neuro-chemical representation of animal-environment relations. The ingredient of neurological behavior that allows for the emergence of mental experience is considered the "hard" problem of conscious and the ToK System does not address this question explicitly. In contrast, through the Justification Hypothesis (see below), the ToK System involves a very direct analysis of the other issue of consciousness, that of [[self-awareness]]. 
 
Another frequent question that is raised is "Where does individual human behavior fall on the ToK?" To analyze human behavior from the context of the ToK, one uses the ToK like a prism to separate the dimensions of behavior into physiochemical, biogenetic, neuropsychological and sociolinguistic. Thus if we imagine a conversation between a husband and wife as follows:

:Wife: “You are late again.”
:Husband: “Please not now. It was a stressful day and traffic was bad and you know if work needs to be done, I can’t just leave it.”

The words represent the sociolinguistic dimension and are understood as a function of justification. Justification systems are seen both at the level of individual, micro-social and societal (i.e., the context of justification in which men work and women stay at home). The actions of the husband and wife in terms of [[facial expression]], body movement, etc. are seen as the mental dimension and are understood as a function of behavioral investment. The physiological make up of the organ systems and cells of each body is seen as the biogenetic dimension. Finally, the position, temperature, molecular make up is seen as the physiochemical dimension. Each of the more basic dimensions represent conditions of possibility that allow for the emergence of the higher dimension of process. Thus, insufficient oxygen disrupts organic processes which in turn renders neuropsychological and sociolinguistic processes impossible.

==Toward the integration of human knowledge==

As stated above, the ToK System proposes a new [[epistemology]] with the goal of moving academic knowledge toward what [[E.O. Wilson]] termed [[consilience]]. Consilience is the interlocking of fact and theory into a coherent, holistic view of knowledge. Henriques argues that the ToK affords new perspectives on how knowledge is obtained because it depicts how science emerges from culture and that the four dimensions of complexity correspond to four broad classes of science: the physical, biological, psychological and social sciences.

Henriques further argues that developing such a system for integrating knowledge is not just an academic enterprise. He suggests that in an increasingly complex world, the fragmented state of knowledge can be seen as one of the most pressing social problems of our time. Henriques also believes that history seems to attest that the absence of a collective worldview ostensibly condemns humanity to an endless series of conflicts that inevitably stem from incompatible, partially correct, locally situated justification systems. Thus, from Henriques' perspective, there are good reasons for believing that if there was a shared, general background of explanation, humanity might be able to achieve much greater levels of harmonious relations.
  
In a 2008 article on the ToK,&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2008). The problem of psychology and the integration of human knowledge: Contrasting Wilson's Consilience with the Tree of Knowledge System. ''Theory &amp; Psychology, 18,'' 731–755. [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/PPIHPRevised.pdf Final draft]&lt;/ref&gt; Henriques cites [[Oliver Reiser]]'s 1958 call for unifying scientific knowledge that Henriques implies is similar in theme to the ToK:

::''In this time of divisive tendencies within and between the nations, races, religions, sciences and humanities, synthesis must become the great magnet which orients us all…[Yet] scientists have not done what is possible toward integrating bodies of knowledge created by science into a unified interpretation of man, his place in nature, and his potentialities for creating the good society. Instead, they are entombing us in dark and meaningless catacombs of learning.''&lt;ref&gt;Reiser, O.L. (1958). The integration of human knowledge. Boston: Porter Sargent.&lt;/ref&gt;

With its depiction of the dimensions of complexity and interlocking theoretical joint points, Henriques' believes that his  ToK System offers new avenues that might allow scholars to meet Reiser’s call for academic synthesis. Henriques, like Reiser, believes that with a shared sense of purpose and a common background of explanation, people might yet be able to integrate bodies of knowledge into a unified interpretation of humanity, with humanity's place in nature and its potentialities for creating the good society.

The '''type–token distinction''' is used in disciplines such as [[logic]], [[linguistics]], [[metalogic]], [[typography]], and [[computer programming]] to clarify what words mean.

==Overview==
The sentence "''they drive the same car''" is ambiguous. Do they drive the same ''type'' of car (the same model) or the same instance of a car type (a single vehicle)? Clarity requires us to distinguish words that represent abstract types from words that represent objects that embody or exemplify types. The type–token distinction separates types (abstract descriptive concepts) from tokens (objects that instantiate concepts).

For example: "bicycle" represents a type: the concept of a bicycle; whereas "my bicycle" represents a token of that type: an object that instantiates that type. In the sentence "the bicycle is becoming more popular" the word "bicycle" represents a type that is a concept; whereas in the sentence "the bicycle is in the garage" the word "bicycle" represents a token: a particular object.

(The distinction in [[computer programming]] between [[class (software)|classes]] and [[object (computer science)|objects]] is related, though in this context, "class" sometimes refers to a set of objects (with class-level attribute or operations) rather than a description of an object in the set, as "type" would.)

The words type, concept, property, quality, feature and attribute (all used in describing things) tend to be used with different verbs. E.g. Suppose a rose bush is defined as a plant that is "thorny", "flowering" and "bushy". You might say a rose bush ''instantiates'' these three types, or ''embodies'' these three concepts, or ''exhibits'' these three properties, or ''possesses'' these three qualities, features or attributes.

Property types (e.g "height in metres" or "thorny") are often understood [[ontology|ontologically]] as concepts. Property instances (e.g. height = 1.74) are sometimes understood as measured values, and sometimes understood as sensations or observations of reality.

Some say types exist in descriptions of objects, but not as tangible [[physical object]]s. They say one can show someone a particular bicycle, but cannot show someone the type "bicycle", as in "''the bicycle'' is popular.". However types do exist in the sense that they appear in mental and documented models.

Some say tokens are objects that are tangible, exist in space and time as physical matter and/or energy. However, tokens can be intangible objects of types such as "thought", "tennis match", "government" and "act of kindness".

== Occurrences ==
There is a related distinction very closely connected with the type-token distinction. This distinction is the distinction between an object, or type of object, and an '''''occurrence''''' of it. In this sense, an occurrence is not necessarily a token. Considering the sentence: "[[A rose is a rose is a rose]]". We may equally correctly state that there are eight or three words in the sentence. There are, in fact, three word types in the sentence: "rose", "is" and "a". There are eight word tokens in a token copy of the line. The line itself is a type. There are not eight word types in the line. It contains (as stated) only the three word types, 'a', 'is' and 'rose', each of which is unique. So what do we call what there are eight of? They are occurrences of words. There are three occurrences of the word type 'a', two of 'is' and three of 'rose'.

The need to distinguish tokens of types from occurrences of types arises, not just in linguistics, but whenever types of things have other types of things occurring in them.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ''[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/types-tokens Types and Tokens]''&lt;/ref&gt; Reflection on the simple case of occurrences of [[numeral system|numerals]] is often helpful.{{citation needed|date=January 2017|reason=Claim made with no support or citation, term used without definition.}}

In [[typography]], the type–token distinction is used to determine the presence of a text printed by [[movable type]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert E. Brekle|Brekle, Herbert E.]]: ''Die Prüfeninger Weiheinschrift von 1119. Eine paläographisch-typographische Untersuchung'', Scriptorium Verlag für Kultur und Wissenschaft, Regensburg 2005, {{ISBN|3-937527-06-0}}, p.&amp;nbsp;23&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The defining criteria which a typographic print has to fulfill is that of the type identity of the various [[letter form]]s which make up the printed text. In other words: each letter form which appears in the text has to be shown as a particular instance ("token") of one and the same type which contains a reverse image of the printed [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]].}}

== Charles Sanders Peirce ==
:''There are only 26 letters in the [[English alphabet]] and yet there are more than 26 letters in this [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. Moreover, every time a child writes the alphabet 26 new letters have been created.''

The word 'letters' was used three times in the above paragraph, each time in a different meaning. The word 'letters' is one of many words having "type–token ambiguity". This section disambiguates 'letters' by separating the three senses using terminology standard in logic today. The key distinctions were first made by the American logician-philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] in 1906 using terminology that he established.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Sanders Peirce, Prolegomena to an apology for pragmaticism, Monist, vol.16 (1906), pp. 492–546.&lt;/ref&gt;

The letters that are created by writing are physical objects that can be destroyed by various means: these are letter TOKENS or letter INSCRIPTIONS. The 26 letters of the alphabet are letter TYPES or letter FORMS.

'''Peirce's type–token distinction''', also applies to words, sentences, paragraphs, and so on: to anything in a universe of discourse of character-string theory, or [[concatenation theory]]. There is only one word type spelled el-ee-tee-tee-ee-ar,&lt;ref&gt;Using a variant of [[Alfred Tarski]]'s structural-descriptive naming found in [[John Corcoran (logician)|John Corcoran]], [https://philarchive.org/archive/CORSTC Schemata: the Concept of Schema in the History of Logic], Bulletin of Symbolic Logic, vol. 12 (2006), pp. 219–40.&lt;/ref&gt; namely, 'letter'; but every time that word type is written, a new word token has been created.

Some logicians consider a word type to be the class of its tokens. Other logicians counter that the word type has a permanence and constancy not found in the class of its tokens. The type remains the same while the class of its tokens is continually gaining new members and losing old members.

The word type 'letter' uses only four letter types: el, ee, tee, and ar. Nevertheless, it uses ee twice and tee twice. In standard terminology, the word type 'letter' has six letter OCCURRENCES and the letter type ee OCCURS twice in the word type 'letter'. Whenever a word type is inscribed, the number of letter tokens created equals the number of letter occurrences in the word type.

Peirce's original words are the following.
"A common mode of estimating the amount of matter in a ... printed book is to count the number of words. There will ordinarily be about twenty 'thes' on a page, and, of course, they count as twenty words. In another sense of the word 'word,' however, there is but one word 'the' in the English language; and it is impossible that this word should lie visibly on a page, or be heard in any voice .... Such a ... Form, I propose to term a Type. A Single ... Object ... such as this or that word on a single line of a single page of a single copy of a book, I will venture to call a Token. .... In order that a Type may be used, it has to be embodied in a Token which shall be a sign of the Type, and thereby of the object the Type signifies." – Peirce 1906, Ogden-Richards, 1923, 280-1.

These distinctions are subtle but solid and easy to master. This section ends using the new terminology to disambiguate the first paragraph.

:''There are 26 letter types in the English alphabet and yet there are more than 26 letter occurrences in this sentence type. Moreover, every time a child writes the alphabet 26 new letter tokens have been created.''
