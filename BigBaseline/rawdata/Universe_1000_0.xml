In [[physical cosmology]], the '''age of the universe''' is the [[cosmological time|time]] elapsed since the [[Big Bang]]. The [[Planck (spacecraft)#2015 data release|current measurement]] of the age of the [[universe]] is {{val|13.799|0.021}} billion (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) years&lt;!-- The universe is 8.07×10E60 "planck times" old, this is how much the observable universe has "ticked" since the plank epoch.
For reference, if we took a "supercomputer" capable of counting at plank speed, and have it count since the Big bang, it would have counted a number 203 bits long by now. (1.25×2E202) --&gt; within the [[Lambda-CDM model|Lambda-CDM concordance model]].&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"&gt;{{Cite journal

These include studies of the [[microwave background radiation]], and [[measurement]]s by the [[Planck satellite]], the [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] and other probes.

== Explanation ==
The [[Lambda-CDM model|Lambda-CDM concordance model]] describes the evolution of the universe from a very uniform, hot, dense primordial state to its present state over a span of about 13.8 billion years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[cosmological time]]. This model is well understood theoretically and strongly supported by recent high-precision [[astronomical observation]]s such as [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|WMAP]]. In contrast, theories of the origin of the primordial state remain very speculative. If one extrapolates the Lambda-CDM model backward from the earliest well-understood state, it quickly (within a small fraction of a second) reaches a [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]]. This is known as the "[[initial singularity]]" or the "[[Big Bang]] singularity". This singularity is not understood as having a physical significance in the usual sense, but it is convenient to quote times measured "since the Big Bang" even though they do not correspond to a physically measurable time. For example, "10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang" is a well-defined era in the universe's evolution. If one referred to the same era as "13.8 billion years minus 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds ago", the precision of the meaning would be lost because the minuscule latter time interval is eclipsed by uncertainty in the former.

Though the universe might in theory have a longer history, the [[International Astronomical Union]]&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; presently use "age of the universe" to mean the duration of the Lambda-CDM expansion, or equivalently the elapsed time since the Big Bang in the current [[observable universe]].

==Observational limits==
Since the universe must be at least as old as the oldest things in it, there are a number of observations which put a lower limit on the age of the universe; these include the temperature of the coolest [[white dwarf]]s, which gradually cool as they age, and the dimmest [[turnoff point]] of [[main sequence]] [[stars]] in clusters (lower-mass stars spend a greater amount of time on the main sequence, so the lowest-mass stars that have evolved off of the main sequence set a minimum age).

==Cosmological parameters==
[[Image:Mplwp universe scale evolution.svg|thumb|400px|The age of the universe can be determined by measuring the [[Hubble constant]] today and extrapolating back in time with the observed value of density parameters (Ω). Before the discovery of [[dark energy]], it was believed that the universe was matter-dominated ([[Einstein–de Sitter universe]], green curve). Note that the [[de Sitter universe]] has infinite age, while the [[Big Crunch|closed]] universe has the least age.]]
[[File:Age Universe Planck 2013.png|thumb|400px|The value of the age correction factor, ''F'', is shown as a function of two [[cosmology|cosmological parameters]]: the current fractional matter density Ω&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; and cosmological constant density Ω&lt;sub&gt;''Λ''&lt;/sub&gt;.  The [[Lambda-CDM model|best-fit values]] of these parameters are shown by the box in the upper left; the matter-dominated universe is shown by the star in the lower right.]]
The problem of determining the age of the universe is closely tied to the problem of determining the values of the cosmological parameters. Today this is largely carried out in the context of the [[Lambda CDM model|ΛCDM]] model, where the universe is assumed to contain normal (baryonic) matter, cold [[dark matter]], radiation (including both [[photon]]s and [[neutrino]]s), and a [[cosmological constant]].  The fractional contribution of each to the current energy density of the universe is given by the [[density parameter]]s Ω&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, Ω&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;, and Ω&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt;.  The full ΛCDM model is described by a number of other parameters, but for the purpose of computing its age these three, along with the [[Hubble constant|Hubble parameter]] &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt;, are the most important.

If one has accurate measurements of these parameters, then the age of the universe can be determined by using the [[Friedmann equations|Friedmann equation]].  This equation relates the rate of change in the [[scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] ''a''(''t'') to the matter content of the universe.  Turning this relation around, we can calculate the change in time per change in scale factor and thus calculate the total age of the universe by [[Integral|integrating]] this formula. The age ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is then given by an expression of the form
:&lt;math&gt;t_0 = \frac{1}{H_0} F(\Omega_r,\Omega_m,\Omega_\Lambda,\dots) &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hubble's law|Hubble parameter]] and the function ''F'' depends only on the fractional contribution to the universe's energy content that comes from various components. The first observation that one can make from this formula is that it is the Hubble parameter that controls that age of the universe, with a correction arising from the matter and energy content. So a rough estimate of the age of the universe comes from the [[Hubble time]], the inverse of the Hubble parameter. With a value for &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; around {{val|68|u=km/s/Mpc}}, the Hubble time evaluates to &lt;math&gt;1/H_0&lt;/math&gt; = {{val|14.4}} billion years.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To get a more accurate number, the correction factor ''F'' must be computed. In general this must be done numerically, and the results for a range of cosmological parameter values are shown in the figure. For the [[Lambda CDM model|Planck values]] (Ω&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, Ω&lt;sub&gt;''Λ''&lt;/sub&gt;) = (0.3086, 0.6914), shown by the box in the upper left corner of the figure, this correction factor is about ''F'' = 0.956. For a flat universe without any cosmological constant, shown by the star in the lower right corner, ''F'' = {{Frac|2|3}} is much smaller and thus the universe is younger for a fixed value of the Hubble parameter. To make this figure, Ω&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is held constant (roughly equivalent to holding the [[Cosmic Microwave Background|CMB]] temperature constant) and the curvature density parameter is fixed by the value of the other three.

Apart from the Planck satellite, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ([[WMAP]]) was instrumental in establishing an accurate age of the universe, though other measurements must be folded in to gain an accurate number.  [[CMB]] measurements are very good at constraining the matter content Ω&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not as sensitive to Ω&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt; directly,&lt;ref name="anim3"/&gt; partly because the cosmological constant becomes important only at low redshift.  The most accurate determinations of the Hubble parameter ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; come from [[Type Ia supernova]]e.  Combining these measurements leads to the generally accepted value for the age of the universe quoted above.

The cosmological constant makes the universe "older" for fixed values of the other parameters. This is significant, since before the cosmological constant became generally accepted, the Big Bang model had difficulty explaining why [[globular cluster]]s in the Milky Way appeared to be far older than the age of the universe as calculated from the Hubble parameter and a matter-only universe.&lt;ref&gt;

==WMAP==
[[NASA]]'s [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) project's [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe#Nine-year data release|nine-year data release]] in 2012 estimated the age of the universe to be {{val|13.772|0.059|e=9}} years (13.772 billion years, with an uncertainty of plus or minus 59 million years).&lt;ref name="arxiv-20121220" /&gt;

However, this age is based on the assumption that the project's underlying model is correct; other methods of estimating the age of the universe could give different ages. Assuming an extra background of relativistic particles, for example, can enlarge the error bars of the WMAP constraint by one order of magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;

This measurement is made by using the location of the first acoustic peak in the [[cosmic microwave background radiation|microwave background]] power spectrum to determine the size of the decoupling surface (size of the universe at the time of recombination).  The light travel time to this surface (depending on the geometry used) yields a reliable age for the universe.  Assuming the validity of the models used to determine this age, the residual accuracy yields a margin of error near one percent.&lt;ref name="wmap"&gt;

==Assumption of strong priors==
Calculating the age of the universe is accurate only if the assumptions built into the models being used to estimate it are also accurate. This is referred to as [[strong priors]] and essentially involves stripping the potential errors in other parts of the model to render the accuracy of actual observational data directly into the concluded result.  Although this is not a valid procedure in all contexts (as noted in the accompanying caveat: "based on the fact we have assumed the underlying model we used is correct"{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}&lt;!--no reason to doubt this, but quotation should be cited--&gt;), the age given is thus accurate to the specified error (since this error represents the error in the instrument used to gather the raw data input into the model).

The age of the universe based on the best fit to [[Planck (spacecraft)#2015 data release|Planck 2015 data]] alone is {{val|13.813|0.038}} billion years (the estimate of {{val|13.799|0.021}} billion years uses Gaussian [[Prior probability|prior]]s based on earlier estimates from other studies to determine the combined uncertainty). This number represents an accurate "direct" measurement of the age of the universe (other methods typically involve [[Hubble's law]] and the age of the oldest stars in globular clusters, etc.). It is possible to use different methods for determining the same parameter (in this case – the age of the universe) and arrive at different answers with no overlap in the "errors". To best avoid the problem, it is common to show two sets of uncertainties; one related to the actual measurement and the other related to the systematic errors of the model being used.

An important component to the analysis of data used to determine the age of the universe (e.g. from [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]]) therefore is to use a [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian statistical]] analysis, which normalizes the results based upon the priors (i.e. the model).&lt;ref name="wmap" /&gt; This quantifies any uncertainty in the accuracy of a measurement due to a particular model used.&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
{{Nature timeline}}

{{main|Cosmic age problem|Cosmic microwave background}}
In the 18th century, the concept that the [[age of the Earth]] was millions, if not billions, of years began to appear. However, most scientists throughout the 19th century and into the first decades of the 20th century presumed that the universe itself was [[Steady State theory|Steady State]] and eternal, with maybe stars coming and going but no changes occurring at the largest scale known at the time.

The first scientific theories indicating that the age of the universe might be finite were the studies of [[thermodynamics]], formalized in the mid-19th century. The concept of [[entropy]] dictates that if the universe (or any other closed system) were infinitely old, then everything inside would be at the same temperature, and thus there would be no stars and no life. No scientific explanation for this contradiction was put forth at the time.

In 1915 [[Albert Einstein]] published the theory of [[general relativity]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
 |last=Einstein |first=A.
 |date=1915
 |title=Zur allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1917 constructed the first [[cosmological model]] based on his theory. In order to remain consistent with a steady state universe, Einstein added what was later called a [[cosmological constant]] to his equations. However, already in 1922, also using  Einstein's theory, [[Alexander Friedmann]], and independently five years later [[Georges Lemaître]], showed that the universe cannot be static and must be either expanding or contracting. Einstein's model of a static universe was in addition proved unstable by [[Arthur Eddington]].

The first direct observational hint that the universe has a finite age came from the observations of '[[recession velocity|recession velocities]]', mostly by [[Vesto Slipher]], combined with distances to the '[[nebula]]e' ([[galaxy|galaxies]]) by [[Edwin Hubble]] in a  work published in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in the 20th century, Hubble and others resolved individual stars within certain nebulae, thus determining that they were galaxies, similar to, but external to, our [[Milky Way Galaxy]]. In addition, these galaxies were very large and very far away. [[electromagnetic spectrum|Spectra]] taken of these distant galaxies showed a [[red shift]] in their [[spectral lines]] presumably caused by the [[Doppler effect]], thus indicating that these galaxies were moving away from the Earth. In addition, the farther away these galaxies seemed to be (the dimmer they appeared to us) the greater was their redshift, and thus the faster they seemed to be moving away. This was the first direct evidence that the universe is not static but expanding. The first estimate of the age of the universe came from the calculation of when all of the objects must have started speeding out from the same point. Hubble's initial value for the universe's age was very low, as the galaxies were assumed to be much closer than later observations found them to be.

The first reasonably accurate measurement of the rate of expansion of the universe, a numerical value now known as the [[Hubble constant]], was made in 1958 by astronomer [[Allan Sandage]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

 |doi=10.1086/146483
}}&lt;/ref&gt; His measured value for the Hubble constant came very close to the value range generally accepted today.

However Sandage, like Einstein, did not believe his own results at the time of discovery. His value for the age of the universe{{Elucidate|date=February 2014|reason=What was his value for the age of the universe?}} was too short to reconcile with the 25-billion-year age estimated at that time for the oldest known [[star]]s. Sandage and other astronomers repeated these measurements numerous times, attempting to reduce the [[Hubble constant]] and thus increase the resulting age for the universe. Sandage even proposed new theories of [[cosmogony]] to explain this discrepancy. This issue was finally resolved by improvements in the theoretical models used for estimating the ages of stars. As of 2013, using the latest models for stellar evolution, the estimated age of the [[oldest star|oldest known star]] is {{val|14.46|0.8}} billion years.&lt;ref name=arxiv&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; finally brought an effective end to the remaining scientific uncertainty over the expanding universe. It was a chance result from work by two teams less than 60 miles apart.  In 1964, [[Arno Allan Penzias|Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]] were trying to detect [[radio wave]] [[echo]]es with a supersensitive antenna. The antenna persistently detected a low, steady, mysterious [[noise (electronics)|noise]] in the [[microwave radiation|microwave region]] that was evenly spread over the sky, and was present day and night. After testing, they became certain that the signal did not come from the [[Earth]], the [[Sun]], or [[Milky Way|our galaxy]], but from outside our own galaxy, but could not explain it. At the same time another team, [[Robert H. Dicke]], [[P. J. E. Peebles|Jim Peebles]], and [[David Todd Wilkinson|David Wilkinson]], were attempting to detect low level noise which might be left over from the [[Big Bang]] and could prove whether the Big Bang theory was correct. The two teams realized that the detected noise was in fact radiation left over from the Big Bang, and that this was strong evidence that the theory was correct. Since then, a great deal of other evidence has strengthened and confirmed this conclusion, and refined the estimated age of the universe to its current figure.

The space probes WMAP, launched in 2001, and [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]], launched in 2009, produced data that determines the Hubble constant and the age of the universe independent of galaxy distances, removing the largest source of error.&lt;ref name="wmap"/&gt;

'''Cosmic time''' (also known as '''time since the big bang''') is the [[time]] [[coordinate]] commonly used in the [[Big Bang]] models of [[physical cosmology]].  It is defined for [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]], [[Cosmic expansion|expanding]] universes as follows:  Choose a time coordinate so that the universe has the same [[density]] everywhere at each moment in time (the fact that this is possible means that the universe is, by definition, homogeneous).  Measure the passage of time using [[Clock|clocks]] moving with the [[Hubble flow]].  Choose the big bang singularity as the origin of the time coordinate. 

Cosmic time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Cosmology|last=Dodelson|first=Scott|publisher=Academic Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-12-219141-1|location=|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Cosmology|last=Bonometto|first=Silvio|publisher=Institute of Physics Publishing|year=2002|isbn=0750308109|location=Bristol and Philadelphia|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a measure of time by a physical clock with zero [[Peculiar velocity#Cosmology|peculiar velocity]] in the absence of matter over-/under-densities (to prevent time dilation due to relativistic effects or confusions caused by expansion of the universe). Unlike other measures of time such as temperature, redshift, particle horizon, or Hubble horizon, the cosmic time (similar and complementary to the comoving coordinates) is blind to the expansion of the universe. 

There are two main ways for establishing a reference point for the cosmic time. The most trivial way is to take the present time as the cosmic reference point (sometimes referred to as the lookback time) or alternatively, take the [[Big Bang]] as &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; (also referred to as age of the universe). The big bang doesn't necessarily have to correspond to a physical event but rather it refers to the point at which the scale factor would vanish for a standard cosmological model such as ΛCDM. For instance, in the case of inflation, i.e. a non-standard cosmology, the hypothetical moment of big bang is still determined using the benchmark cosmological models which may coincide with the end of the inflationary epoch. For inflationary models, it is not possible to establish a well defined origin of time before the big bang since the universe does not require a beginning event in such models. For technical purposes, concepts such as the average temperature of the universe (in units of eV) or the particle horizon are used when the early universe is the objective of a study since understanding the interaction among particles is more relevant than their time coordinate or age. 

Cosmic time is the standard time coordinate for specifying the [[Friedmann&amp;ndash;Lemaître&amp;ndash;Robertson&amp;ndash;Walker metric|Friedmann&amp;ndash;Lemaître&amp;ndash;Robertson&amp;ndash;Walker solutions]] of [[Einstein's equations]].

'''Cosmogony''' is any model concerning the origin of either the [[cosmos]] or [[universe]].&lt;ref name=DicAstro&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=A Dictionary of Astronomy |last=Ridpath |first=Ian |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CosmoToday&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cosmogony Today |last=Woolfson |first=Michael Mark |author-link=Michael Woolfson |journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=20 |year=1979 |issue=2 |pages=97–114|bibcode = 1979QJRAS..20...97W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Developing a complete theoretical model has implications in both the [[philosophy of science]] and [[epistemology]].

==Etymology==
The word comes from the [[Koine Greek]] κοσμογονία (from κόσμος "[[cosmos]], the world") and the root of γί(γ)νομαι / γέγονα ("come into a new state of being").&lt;ref name="TU-20140917"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=γίγνομαι - come into a new state of being |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ge/gona&amp;la=greek |date= |work=[[Tufts University]] |accessdate=17 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[astronomy]], cosmogony refers to the study of the origin of particular astrophysical objects or systems, and is most commonly used in reference to the origin of the Universe, the Solar System, or the Earth–Moon system.&lt;ref name=DicAstro/&gt;&lt;ref name=CosmoToday/&gt;

==Overview==
The [[Big Bang]] theory is the prevailing [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] [[scientific theory|model]] of the early development of the [[universe]].&lt;ref name="Wollack"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wollack|first=Edward J.|title=Cosmology: The Study of the Universe|url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/|work=Universe 101: Big Bang Theory|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=27 April 2011|date=10 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514230003/http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/|archivedate=14 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The most commonly held view is that the universe originates in a  [[gravitational singularity]], which [[inflation (cosmology)|expanded extremely rapidly]] from its hot and dense state. 

[[File:Calabi-Yau.png|thumb|left|200px|Projection of a [[Calabi–Yau manifold]] from [[string theory]]. In quantum physics, there remain different, plausible theories regarding what combination of "stuff", space, or time emerged along with the singularity (and therefore this universe).&lt;ref name=Carroll/&gt; The main disagreement among theories is whether [[time]] existed "before" the emergence of our universe or not.]]
Cosmologist and science communicator [[Sean M. Carroll]] explains two competing types of explanations for the origins of the singularity which is the main disagreement between the scientists who study cosmogony and centers on the question of whether [[time]] existed "before" the emergence of our universe or not. One cosmogonical view sees time as fundamental and even eternal: The universe could have contained the singularity because the universe evolved or changed from a prior state (the prior state was "empty space", or maybe a state that could not be called "space" at all). The other view, held by proponents like [[Stephen Hawking]], says that there was no change through time because "time" itself emerged along with this universe (in other words, there can be no "prior" to the universe).&lt;ref name=Carroll&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2012/04/28/a-universe-from-nothing/|title=A Universe from Nothing?, by Sean Carroll, Discover Magazine Blogs, 28 April 2012.|publisher=|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it remains unclear what combination of "stuff", space, or time emerged with the singularity and this universe.&lt;ref name=Carroll/&gt;

One problem in cosmogony is that there is currently no theoretical model that explains the earliest moments of the universe's existence (during the [[Planck time]]) because of a lack of a testable theory of [[quantum gravity]]. Researchers in [[string theory]] and its extensions (for example, [[M theory]]), and of [[loop quantum cosmology]], have nevertheless proposed solutions of the type just discussed.

==Compared with cosmology==
{{quote box
|Cosmology is the study of the structure and changes in the present universe, while the scientific field of cosmogony is concerned with the origin of the universe. Observations about our present universe may not only allow predictions to be made about the future, but they also provide clues to events that happened long ago when ... the cosmos began. So the work of cosmologists and cosmogonists overlaps.

Cosmogony can be distinguished from [[cosmology]], which studies the universe at large and throughout its existence, and which technically does not inquire directly into the source of its origins. There is some ambiguity between the two terms. For example, the [[cosmological argument]] from [[theology]] regarding the existence of [[God]] is technically an appeal to cosmogonical rather than cosmological ideas. In practice, there is a [[science|scientific]] distinction between cosmological and cosmogonical ideas. [[Physical cosmology]] is the science that attempts to explain all [[observation]]s relevant to the development and characteristics of the universe as a whole. Questions regarding why the universe behaves in such a way have been described by physicists and cosmologists as being extra-[[Scientific method|scientific]] (i.e., [[metaphysics|metaphysical]]), though [[speculation]]s are made from a variety of perspectives that include [[extrapolation]] of scientific theories to untested regimes (i.e., at [[Planck scale]]s), and [[philosophical]] or [[religious]] ideas.

==Theoretical scenarios==
Cosmogonists have only tentative theories for the early stages of the universe and its beginning.  {{as of|2011}}, no accelerator experiments probe energies of sufficient magnitude to provide any experimental insight into the behavior of matter at the energy levels that prevailed shortly after the [[Big Bang]].  

Proposed theoretical scenarios differ radically, and include [[string theory]] and [[M-theory]], the [[Hartle–Hawking initial state]], [[string landscape]], [[Cosmic inflation|brane inflation]], the Big Bang, and the [[ekpyrotic universe]]. Some of these models are mutually compatible, whereas others are not.

'''Cosmology''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] κόσμος, ''kosmos'' "world" and -λογία, ''-logia'' "study of") is the study of the [[Chronology of the universe|origin, evolution, and eventual fate]] of the [[universe]]. [[Physical cosmology]] is the scientific study of the universe's origin, its large-scale structures and dynamics, and its [[ultimate fate of the universe|ultimate fate,]] as well as the [[Laws of science|scientific laws]] that govern these areas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9988-instant-expert-cosmology.html "Introduction: Cosmology – space"]. ''New Scientist''. 4 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''cosmology'' was first used in English in 1656 in [[Thomas Blount (lexicographer)|Thomas Blount]]'s ''Glossographia'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Cosmology (Routledge Revivals): Historical, Philosophical, and Scientific Foundations of Modern Cosmology |first1=Norriss S. |last1=Hetherington |publisher=Routledge |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-317-67766-6 |page=116 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EP9QAwAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=EP9QAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA116 Extract of page 116]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1731 taken up in Latin by [[German philosophy|German philosopher]] [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]], in ''Cosmologia Generalis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Wraparound Universe |first1=Jean-Pierre |last1=Luminet |publisher=CRC Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4398-6496-8 |page=170 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PeDqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=PeDqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170 Extract of page 170]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Religious cosmology|Religious]] or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on [[Mythology|mythological]], [[Religion|religious]], and [[Esotericism|esoteric]] literature and traditions of [[creation myth]]s and [[eschatology]].

Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as [[Astronomy|astronomers]] and [[Physics|physicists]], as well as [[Philosophy|philosophers]], such as [[Metaphysics|metaphysicians]], [[Philosophy of physics|philosophers of physics]], and [[Philosophy of space and time|philosophers of space and time]].  Because of this shared scope with [[philosophy]], [[theory|theories]] in physical cosmology may include both [[science|scientific]] and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that cannot be [[hypothesis|tested]]. Cosmology differs from astronomy in that the former is concerned with the Universe as a whole while the latter deals with individual [[celestial object]]s. Modern physical cosmology is dominated by the [[Big Bang]] theory, which attempts to bring together [[observational astronomy]] and [[particle physics]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/cosmology "Cosmology"] Oxford Dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt; more specifically, a standard parameterization of the Big Bang with [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]], known as the [[Lambda-CDM]] model.

[[Astrophysics#Theoretical astrophysics|Theoretical astrophysicist]] [[David Spergel|David N. Spergel]] has described cosmology as a "historical science" because "when we look out in space, we look back in time" due to the finite nature of the [[speed of light]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=[[David Spergel|David N.

[[Physics]] and [[astrophysics]] have played a central role in shaping the understanding of the universe through scientific observation and experiment. [[Physical cosmology]] was shaped through both mathematics and observation in an analysis of the whole universe. The universe is generally understood to have begun with the [[Big Bang]], followed almost instantaneously by [[cosmic inflation]]; an [[metric expansion of space|expansion of space]] from which the universe is thought to have emerged [[Age of the universe|13.799 ± 0.021]] [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] years ago.&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2015|title=Planck 2015 results.

In [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]]'s [[Encyclopédie]], cosmology is broken down into uranology (the science of the heavens), aerology (the science of the air), geology (the science of the continents), and hydrology (the science of waters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authors=  |title=Detailed Explanation of the System of Human Knowledge

Metaphysical cosmology has also been described as the placing of humans in the universe in relationship to all other entities. This is exemplified by [[Marcus Aurelius]]'s observation that a man's place in that relationship: "He who does not know what the world is does not know where he is, and he who does not know for what purpose the world exists, does not know who he is, nor what the world is."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = The thoughts of Marcus Aurelius Antonius viii. 52 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15877/15877-h/15877-h.htm#viii._52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical cosmology===
{{Main|Physical cosmology}}
Physical cosmology is the branch of physics and astrophysics that deals with the study of the physical origins and evolution of the Universe. It also includes the study of the nature of the Universe on a large scale. In its earliest form, it was what is now known as "[[celestial mechanics]]", the study of the [[celestial sphere|heavens]]. Greek philosophers [[Aristarchus of Samos]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Ptolemy]] proposed different cosmological theories. The [[geocentric]] [[Ptolemaic system]] was the prevailing theory until the 16th century when [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], and subsequently [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Galileo Galilei]], proposed a [[heliocentric]] system. This is one of the most famous examples of [[epistemological rupture]] in physical cosmology.

[[File:PIA17993-DetectorsForInfantUniverseStudies-20140317.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Evidence of [[gravitational waves]] in the [[Big Bang|infant universe]] may have been uncovered by the microscopic examination of the [[focal plane]] of the [[BICEP2]] [[radio telescope]].&lt;ref name="BICEP2-2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20140317" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140317" /&gt;]] 
[[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'', published in 1687, was the first description of the [[law of universal gravitation]]. It provided a physical mechanism for [[Kepler's laws]] and also allowed the anomalies in previous systems, caused by gravitational interaction between the planets, to be resolved. A fundamental difference between Newton's cosmology and those preceding it was the [[Copernican principle]]—that the bodies on earth obey the same [[physical law]]s as all the celestial bodies. This was a crucial philosophical advance in physical cosmology.

Modern scientific cosmology is usually considered to have begun in 1917 with [[Albert Einstein]]'s publication of his final modification of [[general relativity]] in the paper "Cosmological Considerations of the General Theory of Relativity" (although this paper was not widely available outside of Germany until the end of [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]]). General relativity prompted [[cosmogony|cosmogonists]] such as [[Willem de Sitter]], [[Karl Schwarzschild]], and [[Arthur Eddington]] to explore its astronomical ramifications, which enhanced the ability of [[astronomy|astronomers]] to study very distant objects. Physicists began changing the assumption that the Universe was static and unchanging. In 1922 [[Alexander Friedmann]] introduced the idea of an expanding universe that contained moving matter. Around the same time (1917 to 1922) the [[Great Debate (astronomy)|Great Debate]] took place, with early cosmologists such as [[Heber Curtis]] and [[Ernst Öpik]] determining that some [[nebula]]e seen in telescopes were separate galaxies far distant from our own.

{{Physical cosmology}}
In parallel to this dynamic approach to cosmology, one long-standing debate about the structure of the cosmos was coming to a climax. Mount Wilson astronomer [[Harlow Shapley]] championed the model of a cosmos made up of the [[Milky Way]] [[star system]] only; while [[Heber D. Curtis]] argued for the idea that spiral nebulae were star systems in their own right as island universes. This difference of ideas came to a climax with the organization of the [[Great Debate (astronomy)|Great Debate]] on 26 April 1920 at the meeting of the U.S. [[National Academy of Sciences]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The debate was resolved when [[Edwin Hubble]] detected [[Cepheid Variables]] in the [[Andromeda galaxy]] in 1923 and 1924. Their distance established spiral nebulae well beyond the edge of the Milky Way&lt;!-- and has galaxies of their own--&gt;&lt;!--Somebody's editing mistake - check.--&gt;.

Subsequent modelling of the universe explored the possibility that the [[cosmological constant]], introduced by Einstein in his 1917 paper, may result in an [[expanding universe]], depending on its value. Thus the [[Big Bang]] model was proposed by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] priest [[Georges Lemaître]] in 1927 which was subsequently corroborated by [[Edwin Hubble]]'s discovery of the [[Redshift|red shift]] in 1929 and later by the discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] by [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson]] in 1964. These findings were a first step to rule out some of many [[Non-standard cosmology|alternative cosmologies]].

Since around 1990, several dramatic advances in observational cosmology have transformed cosmology from a largely speculative science into a predictive science with precise agreement between theory and observation. These advances include observations of the microwave background from the [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]], [[WMAP]] and [[Planck spacecraft|Planck]] satellites,  large new galaxy [[redshift survey]]s including [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey|2dfGRS]] and [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey|SDSS]], and observations of distant [[supernovae]] and [[gravitational lensing]]. These observations matched the predictions of the [[cosmic inflation]] theory, a modified [[Big Bang]] theory, and the specific version known as the [[Lambda-CDM]] model.  This has led many to refer to modern times as the "golden age of cosmology".&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Guth]] is reported to have made this very claim in an [[Edge Foundation, Inc.|Edge Foundation]] interview [http://www.edge.org/documents/day/day_guth.html EDGE]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophical cosmology===
{{See also|Cosmology (philosophy)}}

Cosmology deals with the world as the totality of space, time and all phenomena. Historically, it has had quite a broad scope, and in many cases was founded in religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crouch |first1=C.

It is distinguished from religious cosmology in that it approaches these questions using philosophical methods like [[dialectic]]s. Modern metaphysical cosmology tries to address questions such as:&lt;ref name="BICEP2-2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/planck/publications#Planck2015|title=Publications - Cosmos|website=www.cosmos.esa.int|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* What is the origin of the Universe? What is its first cause? Is its existence necessary? (see [[monism]], [[pantheism]], [[emanationism]] and [[creationism]])
* What are the ultimate material components of the Universe? (see [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]], [[dynamism (metaphysics)|dynamism]], [[hylomorphism]], [[atomism]])
* What is the ultimate reason for the existence of the Universe? Does the cosmos have a purpose? (see [[teleology]])
* Does the existence of consciousness have a purpose? How do we know what we know about the totality of the cosmos? Does cosmological reasoning reveal metaphysical truths? (see [[epistemology]])

'''Debris''' or '''débris''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|d|ɛ|b|r|iː|,_|ˈ|d|eɪ|b|r|iː}}, {{IPAc-en|US|d|ə|ˈ|b|r|iː}}) is [[rubble]], wreckage, [[ruins]], [[litter]] and discarded [[waste|garbage/refuse/trash]], scattered remains of something destroyed, discarded, or as in geology, large rock fragments left by a melting glacier etc. Depending on context, ''debris'' can refer to a number of different things. The first apparent use of the French  word in English is in a 1701 description of the army of [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] upon its retreat from a battle with the army of Oliver Cromwell, in England.&lt;ref&gt;Warwick, Sir Philip. (1701). Memoires of the Reigne of King Charles I: With a continuation to the happy restoration of King Charles II. London: Ri.Chiswell. p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disaster==
In disaster scenarios, [[tornado]]s leave behind large pieces of houses and mass destruction overall. This debris also flies around the tornado itself when it is in progress. The tornado's winds capture debris it kicks up in its wind orbit, and spins it inside its vortex. The tornado's wind radius is larger than the funnel itself. tsunamis and hurricanes also bring large amounts of debris, such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Earthquakes rock cities to rubble debris.

==Geological==
[[Image:ObsidianDomeCA.JPG|thumb|[[Obsidian]] debris (talus), Obsidian Dome, [[California]].]]
In [[geology]], debris usually applies to the remains of geological activity including [[landslide]]s, [[volcanic]] explosions, [[avalanches]], [[Mudslide|mudflows]] or [[Glacial lake outburst flood]]s (Jökulhlaups) and [[moraine]], [[lahars]], and [[lava]] eruptions. Geological debris sometimes moves in a [[stream]] called a [[debris flow]].  When it accumulates at the base of hillsides, it can be called "talus" or "[[scree]]".

In [[mining]], debris called ''attle'' usually consists of rock fragments which contain little or no ore.

==Marine==
{{Main|marine debris}}
[[Image:Marine debris on Hawaiian coast.jpg|thumb|[[Marine debris]] washed ashore on [[Hawaii]]]]
''Marine debris'' applies to floating garbage such as [[bottles]], [[Tin can|cans]], [[expanded polystyrene foam|styrofoam]], cruise [[ship]] waste, offshore [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[gas]] exploration and production facilities [[pollution]], and [[fishing]] paraphernalia from professional and recreational boaters. Marine debris is also called [[litter]] or [[flotsam and jetsam]]. Objects that can constitute marine debris include used [[automobile]] [[tires]], [[detergent]] [[bottles]], [[medical waste]]s, discarded fishing line and [[Net (device)|nets]], soda cans, and [[bilge]] waste solids.

In addition to being unsightly, it can pose a serious threat to marine life, [[boats]], [[human swimming|swimmers]], [[underwater diving|divers]], and others. For example, each year millions of seabirds, sea [[turtle]]s, [[fish]], and marine [[mammal]]s become entangled in marine debris, or ingest plastics which they have mistaken for food. As many as 30,000 northern fur seals per year get caught in abandoned fishing nets and either drown or suffocate. [[Whales]] mistake [[plastic]] bags for [[squid]], and [[birds]] may mistake plastic pellets for fish [[roe|eggs]]. At other times, animals accidentally eat the plastic while feeding on natural food.

The largest concentration of marine debris is the [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]].

Marine debris most commonly originates from land-based sources. Various international agencies are currently working to reduce marine debris levels around the world.

==Meteorological==
In [[meteorology]], debris usually applies to the remains of [[human]] habitation and natural [[flora (plants)|flora]] after [[storm]] related destruction. This debris is also commonly referred to as '''storm debris'''. Storm debris commonly consists of roofing material, downed [[tree]] [[branch|limbs]], downed [[wikt:signs|signs]], downed [[power line]]s and poles, and wind-blown garbage. Storm debris can become a serious problem immediately after a storm, in that it often blocks access to individuals and communities that may require emergency services. This material frequently exists in such large quantities that disposing of it becomes a serious issue for a community. In addition, storm debris is often hazardous by its very nature, since, for example, downed power lines annually account for storm-related deaths.
{{See also|debris ball|road debris}}

==Space==
{{Main|space debris}}
''Space debris'' usually refers to the remains of [[spacecraft]] that have either fallen to [[Earth]] or are still orbiting Earth. Space debris may also consist of natural components such as chunks of [[rock (geology)|rock]] and [[ice]]. The problem of space debris has grown as various space programs have left legacies of launches, explosions, repairs, and discards in both low Earth [[orbit]] and more remote orbits. These orbiting fragments have reached a great enough proportion to constitute a hazard to future space launches of both [[satellite]] and manned vehicles. Various government agencies and international organizations are beginning to track space debris and also research possible solutions to the problem. While many of these  items, ranging in size from [[nut (hardware)|nut]]s and [[Screw|bolts]] to entire satellites and spacecraft, may fall to Earth, other items located in more remote orbits may stay aloft for centuries. The velocity of some of these pieces of space junk have been clocked in excess of 17,000 miles per hour (27,000&amp;nbsp;km/h). A piece of space debris falling to Earth leaves a fiery trail, just like a [[meteor]].

A [[debris disk]] is a circumstellar disk of dust and debris in orbit around a star.

==Surgical==
In [[medicine]], debris usually refers to biological matter that has accumulated or lodged in [[surgical instruments]] and is referred to as '''surgical debris'''. The presence of surgical debris can result in cross-infections or [[nosocomial infection]]s if not removed and the affected surgical instruments or equipment properly [[disinfect]]ed.

==War==
[[Image:Boys Toys edit.jpg|thumb|right|A child plays on an abandoned tank outside [[Phnom Penh]], [[Cambodia]] in 1991]]
In the aftermath of a war, large areas of the region of conflict are often strewn with ''war debris'' in the form of abandoned or destroyed hardware and vehicles, mines, [[unexploded ordnance]], bullet casings and other fragments of metal.

Much war debris has the potential to be lethal and continues to kill and maim civilian populations for years after the end of a conflict. The risks from war debris may be sufficiently high to prevent or delay the return of refugees. In addition war debris may contain hazardous chemicals or radioactive components that can contaminate the land or poison civilians who come into contact with it. Many [[Mine clearance agencies]] are also involved in the clearance of war debris.

[[Land mines]] in particular are very dangerous as they can remain active for decades after a conflict, which is why they have been banned by international war regulations.

In November 2006 the Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title=Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War (Protocol V to the 1980 Convention)
| year=2003
| publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross
| accessdate=2006-06-20
| url=http://www.icrc.org/IHL.nsf/FULL/610?OpenDocument
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
came into effect with 92 countries subscribing to the treaty that requires the parties involved in a conflict to assist with the removal of unexploded ordnance following the end of hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate=2006-06-20
| url=http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?F=1803977&amp;C=mideast
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the countries most affected by war debris are [[Afghanistan]], [[Angola]], [[Cambodia]], [[Iraq]] and [[Laos]].

Similarly ''military debris'' may be found in and around [[firing range]]s and military training areas.

Debris can also be used as [[Cover (military)|cover]] for military purposes, depending on the situation.

==Culinary==
In South Louisiana's [[Louisiana Creole cuisine|Creole]] and [[Cajun]] cultures, debris (pronounced "DAY-bree") refers to chopped organs such as liver, heart, kidneys, tripe, spleen, brain, lungs and pancreas.

The '''Drakoo wave energy converter'''  is a technological device that uses the motion of [[ocean surface waves]] to generate electricity.

== Principle ==
The Drakoo WEC does not fall under any of the usual [[Wave Energy Converter|wave energy converter]] classifications: its working principle, based on a twin-chamber oscillating water column system, is to transform waves into a continuous water flow which drives a hydro turbine generator.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://marineenergy.biz/2016/12/29/drakoo-wave-device-generates-first-power-china/|title=Drakoo wave device generates first power in China|work=Marine Energy|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development history ==
after being patented in 2008, the Drakoo technology has successfully been tested in NTU lab and, subsequently, in the deep wave flume of NAREC in 2012(UK).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://report2014.ocean-energy-systems.org/country-reports/singapore/technology-demonstration/|title=Ocean Energy System Annual Report 2014|last=|first=|date=|website=Ocean Energy Systems|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 23, 2016, Hann Ocean Energy, the Singapore wave developer company which invented and patented the technology, announced the first successful power production during a trial in its testing facility in [[Nantong]], with a peak power output of 3.8&amp;nbsp;kW at a wave height of 0.6m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://marineenergy.biz/2016/12/29/drakoo-wave-device-generates-first-power-china/|title=Drakoo wave device generates first power in China|work=Marine Energy|access-date=2018-04-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology continuously increased its performances along the years, reaching firstly a peak output power of 9.3&amp;nbsp;kW  in November 2017 and of 11.2&amp;nbsp;kW in March 2018. Moreover, during the [[World Future Energy Summit]] 2018, in Abu Dhabi, Hann Ocean Energy reported about sales inquiries from the Persian Gulf for the application of the Drakoo WEC for wellhead platforms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6177">'''Dynamical dimensional reduction''' or '''spontaneous dimensional reduction''' is the apparent reduction in the number of spacetime dimensions as a function of the distance scale, or conversely the energy scale, with which spacetime is probed. At least within the current level of experimental precision, our universe has three dimensions of space and one of time. However, the idea that the number of dimensions may increase at extremely small length scales was first proposed more than a century ago,&lt;ref&gt;Nordstrom, G. Z. Phys. 15 (1914) 504.&lt;/ref&gt; and is now fairly commonplace in theoretical physics. Contrary to this, a number of recent results in quantum gravity suggest the opposite behavior, a dynamical reduction of the number of spacetime dimensions at small length scales. 
== Evidence for dimensional reduction==
The phenomenon of dimensional reduction has now been reported in a number of different approaches to quantum gravity. String theory,&lt;ref&gt;Atick, J. J. Witten, E.; [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0550321388901514?via%3Dihub The Hagedorn Transition and the Number of Degrees of Freedom of String Theory].&lt;/ref&gt; causal dynamical triangulations,&lt;ref&gt;Ambjorn, J. Jurkiewicz, J. Loll, R.; [https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.171301 Spectral Dimension of the Universe].&lt;/ref&gt; renormalization group approaches,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Lauscher, O. M. Reuter, E.; [http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1126-6708/2005/10/050/meta Fractal Spacetime Structure in Asymptotically Safe Gravity].&lt;/ref&gt; noncommutative geometry,&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti, D.; Fractal properties of quantum spacetime [https://arxiv.org/abs/0811.1396 arXiv:0811.1396].&lt;/ref&gt; loop quantum gravity&lt;ref&gt;Modesto, L.; Fractal Structure of Loop Quantum Gravity [https://arxiv.org/abs/0812.2214 arXiv:0812.2214].&lt;/ref&gt; and Horava-Lifshitz gravity&lt;ref&gt;Horava, P.; Spectral Dimension of the Universe in Quantum Gravity at a Lifshitz Point [https://arxiv.org/abs/0902.3657 arXiv:0902.3657].&lt;/ref&gt; all find that the dimensionality of spacetime appears to decrease from approximately 4 on large distance scales to approximately 2 on small distance scales. 

The evidence for dimensional reduction has come mainly, although not exclusively, from calculations of the spectral dimension. The spectral dimension is a measure of the effective dimension of a manifold at different resolution scales. Early numerical simulations within the [[Causal_dynamical_triangulation|causal dynamical triangulation]] (CDT) approach to quantum gravity found a spectral dimension of 4.02 ± 0.10 at large distances and 1.80 ± 0.25 at small distances. This result created significant interest in dimensional reduction within the quantum gravity community. A more recent study of the same point in the parameter space of CDT found consistent results, namely 4.05 ± 0.17 at large distances and 1.97 ± 0.27 at small distances.&lt;ref&gt;Coumbe, D. N. Jurkiewicz, J.; [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FJHEP03%282015%29151 Evidence for Asymptotic Safety from Dimensional Reduction in Causal Dynamical Triangulations,][https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7712 arXiv:1411.7712].&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there is no consensus on the correct theoretical explanation for the mechanism of dimensional reduction.  

== Possible explanations ==

The ubiquity and consistency of dimensional reduction in quantum gravity has driven the search for a theoretical understanding of this phenomenon. Currently, there exist few proposed explanations for the observation of dimensional reduction. 

One proposal is that of scale invariance. There is growing evidence that gravity may be nonperturbatively renormalizable as described by the asymptotic safety program, which requires the existence of a non-Gaussian fixed point at high energies towards which the couplings defining the theory flow.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; At such a fixed point gravity must be scale invariant, and hence Newton's constant must be dimensionless. Only in 2-dimensional spacetime is Newton's constant dimensionless, and so in this scenario going to higher energies and hence flowing towards the fixed point should correspond to the dimensionality of spacetime reducing to the value 2. This explanation is not entirely satisfying as it does not explain why such a fixed point should exist in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;Carlip, S.; Spontaneous Dimensional Reduction in Short-Distance Quantum Gravity? [https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.3329 arXiv:0909.3329].&lt;/ref&gt;

A second possible explanation for dimensional reduction is that of asymptotic silence. General relativity exhibits so-called asymptotic silence in the vicinity of a spacelike singularity, which is the narrowing or focusing of light cones close to the Planck scale leading to a causal decoupling of nearby spacetime points. In this scenario, each point has a preferred spatial direction, and geodesics see a reduced (1 + 1)-dimensional spacetime.&lt;ref&gt;Carlip, S.; Dimension and Dimensional Reduction in Quantum Gravity [https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05417 arXiv:1705.05417].&lt;/ref&gt;

Dimensional reduction implies a deformation or violation of Lorentz invariance and typically predicts an energy dependent speed of light.&lt;ref&gt;Sotiriou, T. Visser, M. Weinfurtner, S.; From dispersion relations to spectral dimension - and back again [https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.6098 arXiv:1105.6098].&lt;/ref&gt; Given such radical consequences, an alternative proposal is that dimensional reduction should not be taken literally, but should instead be viewed as a hint of new Planck scale physics.&lt;ref&gt;Coumbe, D. N.; [https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.91.124040 Hypothesis on the nature of time,][https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04320 arXiv:1502.04320].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coumbe, D. N.; [http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S021827181750119X Quantum gravity without vacuum dispersion,][https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02519 arXiv:1512.02519].&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the name is sometimes simply given as ''Earth'', by analogy with the names of the [[Solar System|other planets]].&lt;ref name=oedearth/&gt; [[Style guide|House styles]] now vary: [[Oxford spelling]] recognizes the lowercase form as the most common, with the capitalized form an acceptable variant. Another convention capitalizes "Earth" when appearing as a name (e.g. "Earth's atmosphere") but writes it in lowercase when preceded by ''the'' (e.g. "the atmosphere of the earth"). It almost always appears in lowercase in colloquial expressions such as "what on earth are you doing?"&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;''The New Oxford Dictionary of English'', {{nowrap|1st ed.}} "earth".

===Formation===
[[File:Protoplanetary-disk.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of the early Solar System's planetary disk]]
The oldest material found in the [[Solar System]] is dated to {{val|4.5672|0.0006|ul=billion years ago}} (Bya).&lt;ref name=bowring_housch1995/&gt; By {{val|4.54|0.04|u=Bya}}&lt;ref name="age_earth1" /&gt; the primordial Earth had formed. The bodies in [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|the Solar System formed and evolved]] with the Sun. In theory, a [[solar nebula]] partitions a volume out of a [[molecular cloud]] by gravitational collapse, which begins to spin and flatten into a [[circumstellar disk]], and then the planets grow out of that disk with the Sun. A nebula contains gas, ice grains, and [[Cosmic dust|dust]] (including [[primordial nuclide]]s). According to [[nebular theory]], [[planetesimal]]s formed by [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]], with the primordial Earth taking 10–{{val|20|ul=million years}} (Mys) to form.&lt;ref name=nature418_6901_949/&gt;

A subject of research is the formation of the Moon, some 4.53 Bya.&lt;ref name=science310_5754_1671/&gt; A leading hypothesis is that it was formed by accretion from material loosed from Earth after a [[Mars]]-sized object, named [[Theia (planet)|Theia]], [[giant impact hypothesis|hit]] Earth.&lt;ref name=reilly20091022/&gt; In this view, the mass of Theia was approximately 10 percent of Earth,&lt;ref name=canup_asphaug2001a/&gt; it hit Earth with a glancing blow and some of its mass merged with Earth.&lt;ref name=canup_asphaug2001b/&gt; Between approximately 4.1 and {{val|3.8|u=Bya}}, numerous [[Impact event|asteroid impacts]] during the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the Moon and, by inference, to that of Earth.

===Geological history===
{{Main|Geological history of Earth}}
[[File:USA 10654 Bryce Canyon Luca Galuzzi 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Hoodoo (geology)|Hoodoos]] at the [[Bryce Canyon National Park]], [[Utah]]]]

Earth's atmosphere and oceans were formed by [[Volcano|volcanic activity]] and [[outgassing]]. Water vapor from these sources [[origin of the world's oceans|condensed]] into the oceans, augmented by water and ice from asteroids, [[protoplanet]]s, and [[comet]]s.&lt;ref name="watersource"/&gt; In [[faint young Sun paradox|this model]], atmospheric "[[greenhouse gas]]es" kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun had only 70% of its [[solar luminosity|current luminosity]].&lt;ref name=asp2002/&gt; By {{val|3.5|u=Bya}}, [[Earth's magnetic field]] was established, which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the [[solar wind]].&lt;ref name=physorg20100304/&gt;

A crust formed when the molten outer layer of Earth cooled [[Phase transition|to form]] a solid. The two models&lt;ref name=williams_santosh2004/&gt; that explain land mass propose either a steady growth to the present-day forms&lt;ref name=science164_1229/&gt; or, more likely, a rapid growth&lt;ref name=tp322_19/&gt; early in Earth history&lt;ref name=rg6_175/&gt; followed by a long-term steady continental area.&lt;ref name=science310_5756_1947/&gt;&lt;ref name=jaes23_799/&gt;&lt;ref name=ajes38_613/&gt; Continents formed by [[plate tectonics]], a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from Earth's interior. Over [[Geologic time scale|the period]] of hundreds of millions of years, the [[supercontinent]]s have assembled and broken apart. Roughly {{val|750|u=million years ago}} (Mya), one of the earliest known supercontinents, [[Rodinia]], began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form [[Pannotia]] {{val|600|–|540|u=Mya}}, then finally [[Pangaea]], which also broke apart {{val|180|u=Mya}}.&lt;ref name=as92_324/&gt;

The present pattern of [[ice age]]s began about {{val|40|u=Mya}} and then intensified during the [[Pleistocene]] about {{val|3|u=Mya}}. High-[[latitude]] regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating about every {{val|40000|-|100000|u=years|fmt=commas}}. The last continental glaciation ended {{val|10000|u=years|fmt=commas}} ago.&lt;ref name=psc/&gt;

[[File:PhylogeneticTree, Woese 1990.svg|thumb|left|[[Phylogenetic tree]] of life on Earth based on [[rRNA]] analysis]]
[[Chemical reaction]]s led to the first self-replicating molecules about four billion years ago. A half billion years later, the [[last universal common ancestor|last common ancestor of all current life]] arose.&lt;ref name=sa282_6_90/&gt; The evolution of [[photosynthesis]] allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms.

During the [[Neoproterozoic]], {{val|750|to|580|u=Mya}}, much of Earth might have been covered in ice. This hypothesis has been termed "[[Snowball Earth]]", and it is of particular interest because it preceded the [[Cambrian explosion]], when multicellular life forms significantly increased in complexity.&lt;ref name=kirschvink1992/&gt; Following the Cambrian explosion, {{val|535|u=Mya}}, there have been five [[Extinction event|mass extinctions]].&lt;ref name="sci215_4539_1501" /&gt; The [[Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event|most recent such event]] was {{val|66|u=Mya}}, when [[Chicxulub impactor|an asteroid impact]] triggered the extinction of the non-[[bird|avian]] [[dinosaur]]s and other large reptiles, but spared some small animals such as [[mammal]]s, which at the time resembled [[shrew]]s. Mammalian life has diversified over the past {{val|66|u=Mys}}, and several million years ago an African ape-like animal such as ''[[Orrorin tugenensis]]'' gained the ability to stand upright.&lt;ref name="gould1994" /&gt; This facilitated tool use and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation needed for a larger brain, which led to the [[Human evolution|evolution of humans]].

===Future===
{{Main|Future of Earth}}
{{See also|Global catastrophic risk}}
Earth's expected long-term future is tied to that of the Sun. Over the next {{val|1.1|u=Bys}}, solar luminosity will increase by 10%, and over the next {{val|3.5|u=Bys}} by 40%.&lt;ref name="sun_future"/&gt; The Earth's increasing surface temperature will accelerate the [[inorganic]] [[carbon cycle]], reducing [[Carbon dioxide|{{chem2|CO2}}]] concentration to levels lethally low for plants ({{val|10|ul=ppm}} for [[C4 carbon fixation|C4 photosynthesis]]) in approximately {{val|500|–|900|u=Mys}}.&lt;ref name="britt2000" /&gt; The lack of vegetation will result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere, making animal life impossible.&lt;ref name=ward_brownlee2002/&gt; After another billion years all surface water will have disappeared&lt;ref name=carrington/&gt; and the mean global temperature will reach {{convert|70|C|F|0}}.&lt;ref name=ward_brownlee2002/&gt; From that point, the Earth is expected to be habitable for another {{val|500|u=Myr}},&lt;ref name="britt2000"/&gt; possibly up to {{val|2.3|u=Ga}} if nitrogen is removed from the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=pnas1_24_9576/&gt; Even if the Sun were eternal and stable, 27% of the water in the modern oceans will descend to the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] in one billion years, due to reduced steam venting from mid-ocean ridges.&lt;ref name=hess5_4_569/&gt;

The Sun will [[stellar evolution|evolve]] to become a [[red giant]] in about {{val|5|u=Bys}}. Models predict that the Sun will expand to roughly {{convert|1|AU|e6km e6mi|lk=in|abbr=unit}}, about 250 times its present radius.&lt;ref name="sun_future" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sun_future_schroder"/&gt; Earth's fate is less clear. As a red giant, the Sun will lose roughly 30% of its mass, so, without tidal effects, Earth will move to an orbit {{convert|1.7|AU|e6km e6mi|lk=off|abbr=unit}} from the Sun when the star reaches its maximum radius. Most, if not all, remaining life will be destroyed by the Sun's increased luminosity (peaking at about 5,000 times its present level).&lt;ref name="sun_future" /&gt; A 2008 simulation indicates that Earth's orbit will eventually decay due to [[Tidal acceleration|tidal effects]] and drag, causing it to enter the Sun's atmosphere and be vaporized.&lt;ref name="sun_future_schroder" /&gt;

{{Main|Figure of the Earth|Earth radius}}
The shape of Earth is approximately [[oblate spheroid]]al. Due to [[rotation]], the Earth is flattened at the poles and [[equatorial bulge|bulging]] around the [[equator]].&lt;ref name=milbert_smith96/&gt; The diameter of the Earth at the equator is {{convert|43|km|mi}} larger than the [[Geographical pole|pole]]-to-pole diameter.&lt;ref name="ngdc2006"/&gt; Thus the point on the surface farthest from Earth's [[center of mass]] is the summit of the equatorial [[Chimborazo (volcano)|Chimborazo]] volcano in [[Ecuador]].&lt;ref name=ps20_5_16/&gt;&lt;ref name=lancet365_9462_831/&gt;&lt;ref name=tall_tales/&gt;&lt;ref name="The 'Highest' Spot on Earth"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9428163 |title=The 'Highest' Spot on Earth |publisher=NPR |date=7 April 2007 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average diameter of the reference spheroid is {{convert|12742|km|mi}}. Local [[topography]] deviates from this idealized spheroid, although on a global scale these deviations are small compared to Earth's radius: The maximum deviation of only 0.17% is at the [[Mariana Trench]] ({{convert|10911|m|ft}} below local sea level), whereas [[Mount Everest]] ({{convert|8848|m|ft}} above local sea level) represents a deviation of 0.14%.{{refn|group=n| If Earth were shrunk to the size of a [[billiard ball]], some areas of Earth such as large mountain ranges and oceanic trenches would feel like tiny imperfections, whereas much of the planet, including the [[Great Plains]] and the [[abyssal plain]]s, would feel smoother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://billiards.colostate.edu/bd_articles/2013/june13.pdf |title=Is a Pool Ball Smoother than the Earth? |publisher=Billiards Digest |date=1 June 2013 |accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[geodesy]], the exact shape that Earth's oceans would adopt in the absence of land and perturbations such as tides and winds is called the [[geoid]]. More precisely, the geoid is the surface of gravitational equipotential at [[mean sea level]].

[[Earth mass|Earth's mass]] is approximately {{val|5.97|e=24|ul=kg}} (5,970 [[yottagram|Yg]]). It is composed mostly of [[iron]] (32.1%), [[oxygen]] (30.1%), [[silicon]] (15.1%), [[magnesium]] (13.9%), [[sulfur]] (2.9%), [[nickel]] (1.8%), [[calcium]] (1.5%), and [[aluminium]] (1.4%), with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to [[mass segregation]], the core region is estimated to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.&lt;ref name=pnas71_12_6973/&gt;

The most common rock constituents of the crust are nearly all [[oxide]]s: chlorine, sulfur, and fluorine are the important exceptions to this and their total amount in any rock is usually much less than 1%. Over 99% of the crust is composed of 11 oxides, principally silica, alumina, iron oxides, lime, magnesia, potash, and soda.&lt;ref name=brown_mussett1981/&gt;&lt;ref name=pnas71_12_6973/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|title=Petrology |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal structure===
{{Main|Structure of the Earth}}
Earth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their [[chemical]] or physical ([[Rheology|rheological]]) properties. The outer layer is a chemically distinct [[Silicate minerals|silicate]] solid crust, which is underlain by a highly [[viscous]] solid mantle. The crust is separated from the mantle by the [[Mohorovičić discontinuity]]. The thickness of the crust varies from about {{convert|6|km|mi}} under the oceans to {{convert|30|-|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} for the continents. The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the [[upper mantle]] are collectively known as the lithosphere, and it is of the lithosphere that the tectonic plates are composed. Beneath the lithosphere is the [[asthenosphere]], a relatively low-viscosity layer on which the lithosphere rides. Important changes in crystal structure within the mantle occur at {{convert|410|and|660|km|mi|abbr=on}} below the surface, spanning a [[Transition zone (Earth)|transition zone]] that separates the upper and lower mantle. Beneath the mantle, an extremely low viscosity liquid [[outer core]] lies above a solid [[inner core]].&lt;ref name=tanimoto_ahrens1995/&gt; The Earth's inner core might rotate at a slightly higher [[angular velocity]] than the remainder of the planet, advancing by 0.1–0.5° per year.&lt;ref name=science309_5739_1313/&gt; The radius of the inner core is about one fifth of that of Earth.

===Heat===
{{Main|Earth's internal heat budget}}
Earth's [[internal heat]] comes from a combination of residual heat from [[planetary accretion]] (about 20%) and heat produced through [[radioactive decay]] (80%).&lt;ref name="turcotte"/&gt; The major heat-producing [[isotope]]s within Earth are [[potassium-40]], [[uranium-238]], and [[thorium-232]].&lt;ref name=sanders20031210/&gt; At the center, the temperature may be up to {{convert|6000|C|F}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Earth's Centre is 1000 Degrees Hotter than Previously Thought |url=http://www.esrf.eu/news/general/Earth-Center-Hotter |website=The European Synchrotron (ESRF) |accessdate=12 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HKckNXMF?url=http://www.esrf.eu/news/general/Earth-Center-Hotter/Earth-Centre-Hotter |archivedate=12 June 2013 |date=25 April 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the pressure could reach {{convert|360|GPa|e6psi|abbr=unit|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name=ptrsl360_1795_1227/&gt; Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's heat production was much higher. At approximately {{val|3|ul=Gyr}}, twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of [[mantle convection]] and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as [[komatiite]]s that are rarely formed today.&lt;ref name="turcotte" /&gt;&lt;ref name=epsl121_1/&gt;

{{Main|Plate tectonics}}
Earth's mechanically rigid outer layer, the lithosphere, is divided into tectonic plates. These plates are rigid segments that move relative to each other at one of three boundaries types: At [[Convergent boundary|convergent boundaries]], two plates come together; at [[Divergent boundary|divergent boundaries]], two plates are pulled apart; and at [[Transform boundary|transform boundaries]], two plates slide past one another laterally. Along these plate boundaries, [[earthquake]]s, [[Volcanism|volcanic activity]], [[Orogeny|mountain-building]], and [[oceanic trench]] formation can occur.&lt;ref name=kious_tilling1999/&gt; The tectonic plates ride on top of the asthenosphere, the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates.&lt;ref name=seligman2008/&gt;

[[File:Mount-Everest.jpg|thumb|left|[[Orogeny|Mountains build up]] when tectonic plates move toward each other, forcing rock up. The highest [[mountain]] on Earth above sea level is [[Mount Everest]].]]

As the tectonic plates migrate, oceanic crust is [[Subduction|subducted]] under the leading edges of the plates at convergent boundaries. At the same time, the upwelling of mantle material at divergent boundaries creates mid-ocean ridges. The combination of these processes recycles the [[oceanic crust]] back into the mantle. Due to this recycling, most of the ocean floor is less than {{val|100|u=Myr}} old. The oldest oceanic crust is located in the Western Pacific and is estimated to be {{val|200|u=Myr}} old.&lt;ref name=duennebier1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=noaa20070307/&gt; By comparison, the oldest dated [[continental crust]] is {{val|4030|u=Myr|fmt=commas}}.&lt;ref name=cmp134_3/&gt;

The seven major plates are the [[Pacific Plate|Pacific]], [[North American Plate|North American]], [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]], [[African Plate|African]], [[Antarctic Plate|Antarctic]], [[Indo-Australian Plate|Indo-Australian]], and [[South American Plate|South American]]. Other notable plates include the [[Arabian Plate]], the [[Caribbean Plate]], the [[Nazca Plate]] off the west coast of South America and the [[Scotia Plate]] in the southern Atlantic Ocean. The Australian Plate fused with the Indian Plate between {{val|50|and|55|u=Mya}}. The fastest-moving plates are the oceanic plates, with the [[Cocos Plate]] advancing at a rate of {{convert|75|mm/year|in/year|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name=podp2000/&gt; and the Pacific Plate moving {{convert|52|–|69|mm/year|in/year|abbr=on}}. At the other extreme, the slowest-moving plate is the Eurasian Plate, progressing at a typical rate of {{convert|21|mm/year|in/year|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=gps_time_series/&gt;

The continental crust consists of lower density material such as the igneous rocks [[granite]] and [[andesite]]. Less common is [[basalt]], a denser volcanic rock that is the primary constituent of the ocean floors.&lt;ref name=layers_earth/&gt; [[Sedimentary rock]] is formed from the accumulation of sediment that becomes buried and [[Diagenesis|compacted together]]. Nearly 75% of the continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks, although they form about 5% of the crust.&lt;ref name=jessey/&gt; The third form of rock material found on Earth is [[metamorphic rock]], which is created from the transformation of pre-existing rock types through high pressures, high temperatures, or both.

===Hydrosphere===
{{Main|Hydrosphere}}
[[File:Earth elevation histogram 2.svg|thumb|Elevation histogram of Earth's surface]]
The abundance of water on Earth's surface is a unique feature that distinguishes the "Blue Planet" from other planets in the Solar System. Earth's hydrosphere consists chiefly of the oceans, but technically includes all water surfaces in the world, including inland seas, lakes, rivers, and underground waters down to a depth of {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The deepest underwater location is [[Challenger Deep]] of the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean with a depth of {{convert|10911.4|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref group="n" name="trench_depth"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kaiko7000/&gt;

The mass of the oceans is approximately 1.35{{e|18}}&amp;nbsp;[[metric ton]]s or about 1/4400 of Earth's total mass. The oceans cover an area of {{convert|361.8|e6km2|e6mi2|abbr=unit}} with a mean depth of {{convert|3682|m|ft|abbr=on}}, resulting in an estimated volume of {{convert|1.332|e9km3|e6cumi|abbr=unit}}.&lt;ref name=ocean23_2_112/&gt; If all of Earth's crustal surface were at the same elevation as a smooth sphere, the depth of the resulting world ocean would be {{convert|2.7|to|2.8|km|mi|2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/559627/sphere-depth-of-the-ocean |title=sphere depth of the ocean&amp;nbsp;– hydrology |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ase.tufts.edu/cosmos/print_chapter.asp?id=4 |title=Third rock from the Sun&amp;nbsp;– restless Earth |work=NASA's Cosmos |accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 97.5% of the water is [[saline water|saline]]; the remaining 2.5% is [[fresh water]]. Most fresh water, about 68.7%, is present as ice in [[ice cap]]s and [[glacier]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://water.usgs.gov/edu/earthwherewater.html |title=The World's Water |last1=Perlman |first1=Howard |date=17 March 2014 |accessdate=12 April 2015 |work=USGS Water-Science School}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average [[salinity]] of Earth's oceans is about 35&amp;nbsp;grams of salt per kilogram of sea water (3.5% salt).&lt;ref name=kennish2001/&gt; Most of this salt was released from volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks.&lt;ref name=mullen2002/&gt; The oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases, which are essential for the survival of many aquatic life forms.&lt;ref name=natsci_oxy4/&gt; Sea water has an important influence on the world's climate, with the oceans acting as a large [[heat reservoir]].&lt;ref name=michon2006/&gt; Shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts, such as the [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]].&lt;ref name=sample2005/&gt;

Earth's [[biosphere]] has significantly altered its [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]]. [[Oxygen evolution#Oxygen evolution in nature|Oxygenic photosynthesis]] evolved {{val|2.7|u=Gya}}, [[oxygen catastrophe|forming]] the primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today.&lt;ref name="NYT-20131003" /&gt; This change enabled the proliferation of [[aerobic organisms]] and, indirectly, the formation of the [[ozone layer]] due to the subsequent [[Ozone–oxygen cycle|conversion of atmospheric {{chem2|O2}} into {{chem2|O3}}]]. The ozone layer blocks [[ultraviolet]] [[solar radiation]], permitting life on land.&lt;ref name="Harrison 2002"/&gt; Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small [[meteor]]s to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature.&lt;ref name="atmosphere"/&gt; This last phenomenon is known as the [[greenhouse effect]]: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture [[thermal energy]] emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, [[methane]], [[nitrous oxide]], and [[ozone]] are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be {{convert|−18|C|F}}, in contrast to the current {{convert|+15|C|F}},&lt;ref name="Pidwirny2006_7" /&gt; and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form.&lt;ref name=Narottam2008/&gt; In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be [[Reflection (physics)|reflected light]] from [[ice crystals]] in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="NYT-20170519"&gt;{{cite news |last=St. Fleur |first=Nicholas |title=Spotting Mysterious Twinkles on Earth From a Million Miles Away |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/science/dscovr-satellite-ice-glints-earth-atmosphere.html |date=19 May 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GRL-201760515"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marshak |first1=Alexander |last2=Várnai |first2=Tamás |last3=Kostinski |first3=Alexander |title=Terrestrial glint seen from deep space: oriented ice crystals detected from the Lagrangian point |date=15 May 2017 |journal=[[Geophysical Research Letters]] |doi=10.1002/2017GL073248 |volume=44 |issue=10 |pages=5197–5202 |bibcode=2017GeoRL..44.5197M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth's atmosphere has no definite boundary, slowly becoming thinner and fading into outer space. Three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within the first {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the surface. This lowest layer is called the troposphere. Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air. This lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler, higher-density air. The result is [[atmospheric circulation]] that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy.&lt;ref name="moran2005"/&gt;

The primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the [[trade winds]] in the equatorial region below 30° latitude and the [[westerlies]] in the mid-latitudes between 30° and 60°.&lt;ref name="berger2002"/&gt; [[Ocean current]]s are also important factors in determining climate, particularly the [[thermohaline circulation]] that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.&lt;ref name=rahmstorf2003/&gt;

Water vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere. When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation.&lt;ref name="moran2005" /&gt; Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This [[water cycle]] is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. Atmospheric circulation, topographic features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.&lt;ref name=hydrologic_cycle/&gt;

The amount of solar energy reaching Earth's surface decreases with increasing latitude. At higher latitudes, the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles, and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere. As a result, the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about {{convert|0.4|C-change|F-change|1}} per degree of latitude from the equator.&lt;ref name=sadava_heller2006/&gt; Earth's surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate. Ranging from the equator to the polar regions, these are the [[Tropics|tropical]] (or equatorial), [[Subtropics|subtropical]], [[temperate]] and [[Polar region|polar]] climates.&lt;ref name=climate_zones/&gt;

This latitudinal rule has several anomalies:
* Proximity to oceans moderates the climate. For example, the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]] has more moderate climate than similarly northern latitudes of [[northern Canada]].
* The [[wind]] enables this moderating effect. The windward side of a land mass experiences more moderation than the leeward side. In the Northern Hemisphere, the prevailing wind is west-to-east, and western coasts tend to be milder than eastern coasts. This is seen in Eastern North America and Western Europe, where rough continental climates appear on the east coast on parallels with mild climates on the other side of the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livescience.com/13573-east-coast-colder-europe-west-coast.html |title=Why U.S. East Coast is colder than Europe's West Coast |publisher=Live Science |date=5 April 2011 |accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Southern Hemisphere, the prevailing wind is east-to-west, and the eastern coasts are milder.
* The distance from the Earth to the Sun varies. The Earth is closest to the Sun (at [[perihelion]]) in January, which is summer in the Southern Hemisphere. It is furthest away (at [[aphelion]]) in July, which is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, and only 93.55% of the solar radiation from the Sun falls on a given square area of land than at perihelion. Despite this, there are larger land masses in the Northern Hemisphere, which are easier to heat than the seas. Consequently, summers are {{convert|2.3|C-change|F-change|0}} warmer in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere under similar conditions.&lt;ref name="Earth at Aphelion"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spaceweather.com/glossary/aphelion.html |title=Earth at Aphelion |publisher=Space Weather |date=July 2008 |accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The climate is colder at high altitudes than at sea level because of the decreased air density.

The commonly used [[Köppen climate classification]] system has five broad groups ([[tropical climate|humid tropics]], [[arid]], [[humid subtropical climate|humid middle latitudes]], [[Continental climate|continental]] and cold [[polar climate|polar]]), which are further divided into more specific subtypes.&lt;ref name="berger2002" /&gt; The Köppen system rates regions of terrain based on observed temperature and precipitation.

The highest air temperature ever measured on Earth was {{convert|56.7|C|F}} in [[Furnace Creek, California]], in [[Death Valley National Park|Death Valley]], in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/highest-recorded-temperature/ |title=Highest recorded temperature |publisher=Guinness World Records |accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest air temperature ever directly measured on Earth was {{convert|-89.2|C|F}} at [[Vostok Station]] in 1983,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lyons |first1=Walter A |title=The Handy Weather Answer Book |date=1997 |publisher=Visible Ink Press |location=Detroit, Michigan |isbn=978-0-7876-1034-0 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; but satellites have used remote sensing to measure temperatures as low as {{convert|-94.7|C|F}} in [[East Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/coldest-temperature-recorded-earth-antarctica-guinness-book |title=Coldest temperature ever recorded on Earth in Antarctica |journal=The Guardian |date=10 December 2013 |accessdate=12 July 2015|publisher=Associated Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; These temperature records are only measurements made with modern instruments from the 20th century onwards and likely do not reflect the full range of temperature on Earth.

====Upper atmosphere====
[[File:Full moon partially obscured by atmosphere.jpg|thumb|This view from orbit shows the [[full moon]] partially obscured by Earth's atmosphere.]]
Above the troposphere, the atmosphere is usually divided into the [[stratosphere]], [[mesosphere]], and [[thermosphere]].&lt;ref name="atmosphere" /&gt; Each layer has a different [[lapse rate]], defining the rate of change in temperature with height. Beyond these, the [[exosphere]] thins out into the [[magnetosphere]], where the geomagnetic fields interact with the [[solar wind]].&lt;ref name=sciweek2004/&gt; Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The [[Kármán line]], defined as 100&amp;nbsp;km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and [[outer space]].&lt;ref name=cordoba2004/&gt;

Thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth's gravity. This causes a slow but steady [[Atmospheric escape|loss of the atmosphere into space]]. Because unfixed [[hydrogen]] has a low [[molecular mass]], it can achieve [[escape velocity]] more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases.&lt;ref name=jas31_4_1118/&gt; The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially [[redox|reducing]] state to its current [[Redox|oxidizing]] one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=sci293_5531_839/&gt; Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth.&lt;ref name=abedon1997/&gt; In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.&lt;ref name=arwps4_265/&gt;

===Magnetic field===
{{Main|Earth's magnetic field}}

The main part of [[Earth's magnetic field]] is generated in the core, the site of a [[Dynamo theory|dynamo]] process that converts the kinetic energy of thermally and compositionally driven convection into electrical and magnetic field energy. The field extends outwards from the core, through the mantle, and up to Earth's surface, where it is, approximately, a [[dipole]]. The poles of the dipole are located close to Earth's geographic poles. At the equator of the magnetic field, the magnetic-field strength at the surface is {{nowrap|3.05 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; [[Tesla (unit)|T]]}}, with global [[magnetic dipole moment]] of {{nowrap|7.91 × 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; T m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name=lang2003/&gt; The convection movements in the core are chaotic; the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment. This causes [[Geomagnetic secular variation|secular variation]] of the main field and [[geomagnetic reversal|field reversals]] at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years. The most recent reversal occurred approximately 700,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=fitzpatrick2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=campbelwh/&gt;

====Magnetosphere====

The extent of Earth's magnetic field in space defines the [[magnetosphere]]. Ions and electrons of the solar wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere, to about 10 Earth radii, and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; Because the velocity of the solar wind is greater than the speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bowshock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/jump.cfm?oid=40994 |title=Cluster reveals the reformation of the Earth's bow shock |publisher=European Space Agency |first=Arnaud |last=Masson |date=11 May 2007 |accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charged particle]]s are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plasmasphere.nasa.gov/ |title=The Earth's Plasmasphere |publisher=NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center |last=Gallagher |first=Dennis L. |date=14 August 2015 |accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plasmasphere.nasa.gov/formed.html |title=How the Plasmasphere is Formed |publisher=NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center |last=Gallagher |first=Dennis L. |date=27 May 2015 |accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field,&lt;ref name="BaumjohannTreumann1997"&gt;{{cite book |title=Basic Space Plasma Physics |publisher=World Scientific |first1=Wolfgang |last1=Baumjohann |first2=Rudolf A. |last2=Treumann |pages=8, 31 |year=1997 |isbn=978-1-86094-079-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Van Allen radiation belt]] are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but otherwise contained by the magnetosphere.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/science/ionosphere-and-magnetosphere/Magnetosphere |title=Ionosphere and magnetosphere |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |first=Michael B. |last=McElroy |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Van Allen"&gt;{{cite book |title=Origins of Magnetospheric Physics |publisher=University of Iowa Press |last=Van Allen |first=James Alfred |date=2004 |isbn=978-0-87745-921-7 |oclc=646887856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[magnetic storm]]s and [[substorm]]s, charged particles can be deflected from the outer magnetosphere and especially the magnetotail, directed along field lines into Earth's ionosphere, where atmospheric atoms can be excited and ionized, causing the [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]].&lt;ref name=stern2005/&gt;

==Orbit and rotation==

===Rotation===
{{Main|Earth's rotation}}
[[File:EpicEarth-Globespin(2016May29).gif|thumb|right|Earth's rotation imaged by [[Deep Space Climate Observatory|DSCOVR EPIC]] on 29 May 2016, a few weeks before the [[solstice]].]]
Earth's rotation period relative to the Sun—its mean solar day—is {{nowrap|86,400 seconds}} of mean solar time ({{nowrap|86,400.0025 [[SI]] seconds}}).&lt;ref name=aj136_5_1906/&gt; Because Earth's solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to [[tidal acceleration|tidal deceleration]], each day varies between {{nowrap|0 and 2 SI [[millisecond|ms]]}} longer&lt;!--than the previous day or the 19th-C day?  This construction is ambiguous--&gt;.&lt;ref name=USNO_TSD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rapid Service/Prediction of Earth Orientation |journal=IERS Bulletin-A |date=9 April 2015 |volume=28 |issue=15 |url=http://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/ser7.dat |accessdate=12 April 2015 |format=.DAT file (displays as plaintext in browser)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth's rotation period relative to the [[fixed star]]s, called its ''stellar day'' by the [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] (IERS), is {{nowrap|86,164.0989 seconds}} of mean solar time (UT1), or {{nowrap |23{{smallsup|h}} 56{{smallsup|m}} 4.0989{{smallsup|s}}.}}&lt;ref name=IERS/&gt;&lt;ref group="n" name="Aoki"/&gt; Earth's rotation period relative to the [[precession (astronomy)|precessing]] or moving mean [[vernal equinox]], misnamed its ''[[sidereal day]]'', is {{nowrap|86,164.0905 seconds}} of mean solar time (UT1) {{nowrap|(23{{smallsup|h}} 56{{smallsup|m}} 4.0905{{smallsup|s}})}}.&lt;ref name=IERS/&gt; Thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about 8.4&amp;nbsp;ms.&lt;ref name=seidelmann1992/&gt; The length of the mean solar day in SI seconds is available from the IERS for the periods 1623–2005&lt;ref name=iers1623/&gt; and 1962–2005.&lt;ref name=iers1962/&gt;

Apart from meteors within the atmosphere and low-orbiting satellites, the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth's sky is to the west at a rate of 15°/h = 15'/min. For bodies near the [[celestial equator]], this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the Sun or the Moon every two minutes; from Earth's surface, the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are approximately the same.&lt;ref name=zeilik1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=angular/&gt;

===Orbit===
{{Main|Earth's orbit}}
[[File:Pale Blue Dot.png|thumb|upright|The ''[[Pale Blue Dot]]'' photo taken in 1990 by the ''[[Voyager 1]]'' spacecraft showing Earth (center right) from nearly {{convert|4|e9mi|e9km|order=flip|abbr=unit}} away]]

Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about {{convert|150|e6km|e6mi|abbr=unit}} every 365.2564 mean solar days, or one [[sidereal year]]. This gives an apparent movement of the Sun eastward with respect to the stars at a rate of about 1°/day, which is one apparent Sun or Moon diameter every 12&amp;nbsp;hours. Due to this motion, on average it takes 24&amp;nbsp;hours—a [[Solar time|solar day]]—for Earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the Sun returns to the [[Meridian (astronomy)|meridian]]. The orbital speed of Earth averages about {{convert|29.78|km/s|km/h mph|abbr=on}}, which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to Earth's diameter, about {{convert|12742|km|mi|abbr=on}}, in seven minutes, and the distance to the Moon, {{convert|384000|km|mi|abbr=on}}, in about 3.5 hours.&lt;ref name="earth_fact_sheet" /&gt;

The Moon and Earth orbit a common [[barycenter]] every 27.32&amp;nbsp;days relative to the background stars. When combined with the Earth–Moon system's common orbit around the Sun, the period of the [[synodic month]], from new moon to new moon, is 29.53&amp;nbsp;days. Viewed from the [[celestial pole|celestial north pole]], the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all [[counterclockwise]]. Viewed from a vantage point above the north poles of both the Sun and Earth, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun. The orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned: Earth's [[axial tilt|axis is tilted]] some 23.44&amp;nbsp;degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth–Sun plane (the [[ecliptic]]), and the Earth–Moon plane is tilted up to ±5.1&amp;nbsp;degrees against the Earth–Sun plane. Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between [[lunar eclipse]]s and [[solar eclipse]]s.&lt;ref name="earth_fact_sheet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moon_fact_sheet" /&gt;

The [[Hill sphere]], or the sphere of [[Gravity|gravitational]] influence, of the Earth is about {{convert|1.5|e6km|mi|abbr=unit}} in radius.&lt;ref name=vazquez_etal2006 /&gt;&lt;ref group="n" name="hill_radius" /&gt; This is the maximum distance at which the Earth's gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant Sun and planets. Objects must orbit the Earth within this radius, or they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the Sun.

Earth, along with the Solar System, is situated in the [[Milky Way]] and orbits about 28,000&amp;nbsp;[[light-year]]s from its center. It is about 20&amp;nbsp;light-years above the [[galactic plane]] in the [[Orion Arm]].&lt;ref name=nasa20051201 /&gt;

===Axial tilt and seasons===
{{Main|Axial tilt#Earth}}
[[File:AxialTiltObliquity.png|thumb|left|Earth's axial tilt (or [[obliquity]]) and its relation to the [[Rotation|rotation axis]] and [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|plane of orbit]]]]
The axial tilt of the Earth is approximately 23.439281°&lt;ref name="IERS"/&gt; with the axis of its orbit plane, always pointing towards the [[Celestial Poles]]. Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with [[summer]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] occurring when the [[Tropic of Cancer]] is facing the Sun, and [[winter]] taking place when the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] faces the Sun. During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter. In northern temperate latitudes, the Sun rises north of true east during the summer solstice, and sets north of true west, reversing in the winter. The Sun rises south of true east in the summer for the southern temperate zone and sets south of true west.

Above the [[Arctic Circle]], an extreme case is reached where there is no daylight at all for part of the year, up to six months at the North Pole itself, a [[polar night]]. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is exactly reversed, with the [[South Pole]] oriented opposite the direction of the North Pole. Six months later, this pole will experience a [[midnight sun]], a day of 24 hours, again reversing with the South Pole.

By astronomical convention, the four seasons can be determined by the [[solstice]]s—the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun—and the [[equinox]]es, when the direction of the tilt and the direction to the Sun are perpendicular. In the Northern Hemisphere, [[winter solstice]] currently occurs around 21 December; [[summer solstice]] is near 21 June, [[spring equinox]] is around 20 March and [[autumnal equinox]] is about 22 or 23 September. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.&lt;ref name=bromberg2008/&gt;

The angle of Earth's axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time. Its axial tilt does undergo [[nutation]]; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=lin2006/&gt; The orientation (rather than the angle) of Earth's axis also changes over time, [[precession|precessing]] around in a complete circle over each 25,800&amp;nbsp;year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a [[tropical year]]. Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge. The poles also migrate a few meters across Earth's surface. This [[polar motion]] has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed [[quasiperiodic motion]]. In addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the [[Chandler wobble]]. Earth's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation.&lt;ref name=fisher19960205/&gt;

In modern times, Earth's [[perihelion]] occurs around 3 January, and its [[aphelion]] around 4 July. These dates change over time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as [[Milankovitch cycles]]. The changing Earth–Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.9%&lt;ref group="n" name="solar_energy"/&gt; in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;ref name=williams20051230/&gt;

A study from 2016 suggested that [[Planet Nine]] tilted all [[Solar System]] planets, including Earth's, by about six degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.space.com/34448-planet-nine-solar-system-tilt.html |title=Did the Mysterious 'Planet Nine' Tilt the Solar System? |work=Space.com |first=Charles Q. |last=Choi |date=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitability==
[[File:Moraine Lake 17092005.jpg|thumb|The [[Rocky Mountains]] in Canada overlook [[Moraine Lake]].]]
A planet that can sustain life is termed [[Planetary habitability|habitable]], even if life did not originate there. Earth provides liquid water—an environment where complex [[Organic compound|organic molecules]] can assemble and interact, and sufficient energy to sustain [[metabolism]].&lt;ref name=ab2003/&gt; The distance of Earth from the Sun, as well as its orbital eccentricity, rate of rotation, axial tilt, geological history, sustaining atmosphere, and magnetic field all contribute to the current climatic conditions at the surface.&lt;ref name=dole1970/&gt;

===Biosphere===
{{Main|Biosphere}}
A planet's life forms inhabit [[ecosystem]]s, whose total is sometimes said to form a "biosphere". Earth's biosphere is thought to have begun [[evolution|evolving]] about {{val|3.5|u=Gya}}.&lt;ref name="NYT-20131003" /&gt; The biosphere is divided into a number of [[biome]]s, inhabited by broadly similar plants and animals. On land, biomes are separated primarily by differences in latitude, [[elevation|height above sea level]] and [[humidity]]. Terrestrial [[tundra|biomes]] lying within the Arctic or [[Antarctic Circle]]s, at [[Alpine tundra|high altitudes]] or in [[desert|extremely arid areas]] are relatively barren of plant and animal life; [[Latitudinal gradients in species diversity|species diversity]] reaches a peak in [[tropical rainforest|humid lowlands at equatorial latitudes]].&lt;ref name=amnat163_2_192/&gt;

In July 2016, scientists reported identifying a set of 355 [[gene]]s from the [[last universal common ancestor]] (LUCA) of all [[organism]]s living on Earth.&lt;ref name="NYT-20160725"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wade |first=Nicholas |authorlink=Nicholas Wade |title=Meet Luca, the Ancestor of All Living Things |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/26/science/last-universal-ancestor.html |date=25 July 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth has resources that have been exploited by humans. Those termed [[non-renewable resource]]s, such as [[fossil fuel]]s, only renew over geological timescales.

Large deposits of fossil fuels are obtained from Earth's crust, consisting of [[coal]], [[petroleum]], and [[natural gas]]. These deposits are used by humans both for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production. Mineral [[ore]] bodies have also been formed within the crust through a process of [[ore genesis]], resulting from actions of [[magmatism]], erosion, and plate tectonics.&lt;ref name="Ramdohr"/&gt; These bodies form concentrated sources for many metals and other useful [[chemical element|elements]].

Earth's biosphere produces many useful biological products for humans, including food, [[wood]], [[pharmaceutical]]s, oxygen, and the recycling of many organic wastes. The land-based [[ecosystem]] depends upon [[topsoil]] and fresh water, and the oceanic ecosystem depends upon dissolved nutrients washed down from the land.&lt;ref name=science299_5607_673/&gt; In 1980, {{convert|5053|e6ha|e6km2 e6sqmi|order=out|abbr=unit}} of Earth's land surface consisted of forest and woodlands, {{convert|6788|e6ha|e6km2 e6sqmi|order=out|abbr=unit}} was grasslands and pasture, and {{convert|1501|e6ha|e6km2 e6sqmi|order=out|abbr=unit}} was cultivated as croplands.&lt;ref name="Turner1990"/&gt; The estimated amount of [[irrigated land]] in 1993 was {{convert|2481250|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=cia/&gt; Humans also live on the land by using [[building material]]s to construct shelters.

===Natural and environmental hazards===
[[File:Pavlof2014iss.jpg|thumb|left|A volcano injecting hot ash into the atmosphere]]
Large areas of Earth's surface are subject to extreme weather such as tropical [[cyclone]]s, [[hurricane]]s, or [[typhoon]]s that dominate life in those areas. From 1980 to 2000, these events caused an average of 11,800 human deaths per year.&lt;ref name=walsh2008/&gt; Many places are subject to earthquakes, [[landslide]]s, [[tsunami]]s, [[Types of volcanic eruptions|volcanic eruptions]], [[tornado]]es, [[sinkhole]]s, [[blizzard]]s, floods, droughts, [[wildfire]]s, and other calamities and disasters.

Many localized areas are subject to human-made [[pollution]] of the air and water, [[acid rain]] and toxic substances, loss of vegetation ([[overgrazing]], [[deforestation]], [[desertification]]), loss of wildlife, species [[extinction]], [[soil degradation]], [[soil depletion]] and [[erosion]].

There is a [[scientific consensus]] linking human activities to [[global warming]] due to industrial carbon dioxide emissions. This is predicted to produce changes such as the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, more extreme temperature ranges, significant changes in weather and a [[Sea level rise|global rise in average sea levels]].&lt;ref name=un20070202/&gt;

[[Cartography]], the study and practice of map-making, and [[geography]], the study of the lands, features, inhabitants and phenomena on Earth, have historically been the disciplines devoted to depicting Earth.

{{Main|Moon}}

The Moon is a relatively large, [[Terrestrial planet|terrestrial]], planet-like [[natural satellite]], with a diameter about one-quarter of Earth's. It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, although [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] is larger relative to the [[dwarf planet]] [[Pluto]]. The natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as "moons", after Earth's.

The gravitational attraction between Earth and the Moon causes [[tide]]s on Earth. The same effect on the Moon has led to its [[tidal locking]]: its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet. As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the [[lunar phase]]s; the dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the [[terminator (solar)|solar terminator]].
[[File:Earth-Moon.svg|thumb|left|Details of the Earth–Moon system, showing the radius of each object and the Earth–Moon [[barycenter]]. The Moon's axis is located by [[Cassini's laws|Cassini's third law]].]]

Due to their [[Tidal acceleration|tidal interaction]], the Moon recedes from Earth at the rate of approximately {{convert|38|mm/yr|in/yr|abbr=on}}. Over millions of years, these tiny modifications—and the lengthening of Earth's day by about 23&amp;nbsp;[[Microsecond|µs]]/yr—add up to significant changes.&lt;ref name=espenak_meeus20070207/&gt; During the [[Devonian]] period, for example, (approximately {{val|410|u=Mya}}) there were 400 days in a year, with each day lasting 21.8 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lambeck |first=Kurt |title=The Earth's Variable Rotation: Geophysical Causes and Consequences |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1980 |page=367 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-kiG3uYkoUEC&amp;pg=PA62 |isbn=978-0-521-67330-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the planet's climate. [[Paleontology|Paleontological]] evidence and computer simulations show that Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon.&lt;ref name=aaa428_261/&gt; Some theorists think that without this stabilization against the [[torque]]s applied by the Sun and planets to Earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable, exhibiting chaotic changes over millions of years, as appears to be the case for Mars.&lt;ref name=nature410_6830_773/&gt;

Viewed from Earth, the Moon is just far enough away to have almost the same apparent-sized disk as the Sun. The [[angular size]] (or [[solid angle]]) of these two bodies match because, although the Sun's diameter is about 400 times as large as the Moon's, it is also 400 times more distant.&lt;ref name=angular /&gt; This allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on Earth.

The most widely accepted theory of the Moon's origin, the [[giant-impact hypothesis]], states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth. This hypothesis explains (among other things) the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of Earth's crust.&lt;ref name=nature412_708/&gt;

Scientific investigation has resulted in several culturally transformative shifts in people's view of the planet.

[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] used [[thermodynamics]] to estimate the age of Earth to be between 20 million and 400&amp;nbsp;million years in 1864, sparking a vigorous debate on the subject; it was only when radioactivity and [[Radiometric dating|radioactive dating]] were discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that a reliable mechanism for determining Earth's age was established, proving the planet to be billions of years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=An Equation for Every Occasion: Fifty-Two Formulas and Why They Matter |last=Henshaw |first=John M. |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-421-41491-1 |location= |pages=117–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Lord Kelvin and the Age of the Earth |last=Burchfield |first=Joe D. |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-226-08043-7 |location= |pages=13–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perception of Earth shifted again in the 20th century when humans first viewed it from orbit, and especially with photographs of Earth returned by the [[Apollo program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://alcalde.texasexes.org/2012/06/neil-degrasse-tyson-on-why-space-matters-watch/ |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson: Why Space Matters |work=[[The Alcalde]] |first=Rose |last=Cahalan |date=5 June 2012 |accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=Aoki&gt;The ultimate source of these figures, uses the term "seconds of UT1" instead of "seconds of mean solar time".—{{cite journal |last=Aoki |first=S. |title=The new definition of universal time |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics |year=1982 |volume=105 |issue=2 |pages=359–61 |bibcode=1982A&amp;A...105..359A |last2=Kinoshita |first2=H. |last3=Guinot |first3=B. |last4=Kaplan |first4=G.

&lt;ref name=apsis&gt;aphelion = ''a'' × (1 + ''e''); perihelion = ''a'' × (1&amp;nbsp;– ''e''), where ''a'' is the semi-major axis and ''e'' is the eccentricity. The difference between Earth's perihelion and aphelion is 5 million kilometers.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=epoch&gt;All astronomical quantities vary, both [[Secular phenomena|secularly]] and [[Frequency|periodically]]. The quantities given are the values at the instant [[J2000.0]] of the secular variation, ignoring all periodic variations.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=hill_radius&gt;For Earth, the [[Hill radius]] is &lt;math&gt;R_H = a\left ( \frac{m}{3M} \right )^{\frac{1}{3}}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''m'' is the mass of Earth, ''a'' is an astronomical unit, and ''M'' is the mass of the Sun. So the radius in AU is about &lt;math&gt;\left ( \frac{1}{3 \cdot 332,946} \right )^{\frac{1}{3}} = 0.01&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=jaes41_3_379&gt;Including the [[Somali Plate]], which is being formed out of the African Plate. See: {{cite journal |first=Jean |last=Chorowicz |date=October 2005 |title=The East African rift system |journal=[[Journal of African Earth Sciences]] |volume=43 |issue=1–3 |pages=379–410 |doi=10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2005.07.019 |bibcode=2005JAfES..43..379C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=sidereal_solar&gt;The number of solar days in a year is one less than the number of [[sidereal day]]s (the time it takes the Earth to revolve exactly 360 degrees around its axis) because a solar day is about 236 seconds longer than a sidereal day. Over a year, this discrepancy adds up to a full sidereal day.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=solar_energy&gt;Aphelion is 103.4% of the distance to perihelion. Due to the inverse square law, the radiation at perihelion is about 106.9% the energy at aphelion.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=surfacecover&gt;Due to natural fluctuations, ambiguities surrounding [[Ice shelf|ice shelves]], and mapping conventions for [[vertical datum]]s, exact values for land and ocean coverage are not meaningful. Based on data from the [[Vector Map]] and [http://www.landcover.org/ Global Landcover] datasets, extreme values for coverage of lakes and streams are 0.6% and 1.0% of Earth's surface. The ice shields of [[Antarctica]] and [[Greenland]] are counted as land, even though much of the rock that supports them lies below sea level.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=trench_depth&gt;This is the measurement taken by the vessel ''[[Kaikō]]'' in March 1995 and is considered the most accurate measurement to date. See the [[Challenger Deep]] article for more details.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3864">'''Energoland''' is an information centre for energy and electricity generation which was opened by [[Slovenské elektrárne]] on 14 October 2014 at [[Mochovce]], [[Slovakia]], at the site of the nuclear power plant. It is situated between Levice and Nitra. The centre mainly serves the schools and public. The entry is free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;http://energoland.seas.sk/reservations&lt;/ref&gt; The exposition was awarded as an excellent communication project at the PIME conference and evaluated as a five-star training centre by Laura Elizabeth Kennedy, governor of the United States of America in the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna and chargé d'affaires of permanent representation of the USA in international organisation in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/article/iaea-governor-energoland-is-a-5-star-education-centre/156&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exposition ==
In Energoland, there are more than thirty objects, applications, and interactive expositions. Edutainment (blending education and entertainment) at Mochovce offers information on energy, electricity generation, global warming, and carbon burden. In addition, visitors learn about the energy mix, electricity grid dispatching, or about the radiation around us. The exposition also focuses on power industry, not only with respect to safety and radioactive waste but also dealing with the fuel cycle, nanowolrd of atoms, and Cherenkov radiation. Some of the specialities include the 3D cinema with its own movie Energy Odyssey, a model of emission-free motorcycle, interactive LED floor or thermal mirror, and mobile application using augmented reality, "Energoland",&lt;ref&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.sk.strategic.EnergolandAR&lt;/ref&gt; downloadable from Google Play or AppStore. Through the Energy Map, various facts and statistics can be searched which are directly shown in the map of the world with the highlighted countries.
Energoland also wants its visitors to make their own opinion of the electricity generation and its sources. Therefore, it does not provide information only about nuclear energy but it also brings knowledge about other sources: water, sun, wind, geothermal energy, or fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;http://energoland.seas.sk/exposition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/article/energoland-opened-by-slovenske-elektrarne/119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/gallery/energoland-new-dimension-of-entertainment&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction of Energoland ==
The design of the building is the work of Ing. arch. Viktor Šabík (BARAK Architekti) who, together with the QEX Company and Italian agency Piter Design, designed the interior of Energoland, as well.[2] The total area of the building, including the training rooms and offices is 2,000 square metres; the info centre itself takes up the area of 600 m2.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/data/education/126/file/cfakepathe-atom-10-14.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other Activities ==
Energoland is not only a visitor and information centre; it also serves as a training centre for the employees of Slovenské elektrárne and provides office areas. There are many events for the employees of Slovenské elektrárne or public taking place here, such as the 90 reactor-years anniversary,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/article/90-reaktorrokov-jadrovych-blokov-slovenskych-elektrarni/140&lt;/ref&gt; programme within the national round of Olympics in Physics,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/article/mladi-fyzici-na-olympiade-v-atomovej-elektrarni/162&lt;/ref&gt; Science Talks during the Science and Technology Week,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/article/slovenske-elektrarne-hlavnym-partnerom-tvt/130&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainable Development Conference in May 2015, etc.

'''Energy customer switching''' is a concept stemming from the [[Energy market|global energy markets]]. The concept refers to the action of one energy customer [[customer switching|switching]] [[energy supplier]], a switch is essentially seen as the free (by choice) movement of a customer. In addition to that a switch can include:

* A re-switch: When a customer switches for the second or subsequent time. 
* A switch-back: When a customer switches back to his/her former or previous supplier.

If a customer moves, there is often a switch, however this will only be counted if the customer is not dealing with the incumbent in the new area of residence.

The above is the official definition of switching and is being used by public energy institutions such as [[CEER]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceer.eu|title=Welcome - ceer.eu|website=www.ceer.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp; [[ERGEG]] (forerunner to ACER&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acer.europa.eu/Pages/ACER.aspx|title=Home|website=www.acer.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The definition was originally developed by Dr Philip E. Lewis, international switching expert.

Switching is a key concept to understanding [[competition (economics)|competition]]-related issues on the global energy markets as the switching level of a concrete market reveals the state of the competition; High switching rates equals high level of competition and low switching rates equals limited competition. Thus measuring and assessing switching rates is necessary in order to have a correct impression of the energy markets. The action of switching is often done via a [[price comparison website]] or by the traditional [[door-to-door]] sales method, where a salesperson assists the customer in switching.

'''Energy density''' is the amount of [[energy]] stored in a given system or region of space per unit [[volume]]. Colloquially it may also be used for energy per unit [[mass]], though the accurate term for this is [[specific energy]].  Often only the ''useful'' or extractable energy is measured, which is to say that inaccessible energy (such as [[rest mass]] energy) is ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec04.html |title=The Two Classes of SI Units and the SI Prefixes |work=NIST Guide to the SI |publisher= |accessdate=2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] and other [[general relativity|general relativistic]] contexts, however, the energy densities considered are those that correspond to the elements of the [[stress–energy tensor]] and therefore do include mass energy as well as energy densities associated with the pressures described in the next paragraph.

Energy per unit volume has the same physical units as [[pressure]], and in many circumstances is a [[synonym]]: for example, the energy density of a magnetic field may be expressed as (and behaves as) a physical pressure, and the energy required to compress a compressed gas a little more may be determined by multiplying the difference between the gas pressure and the external pressure by the change in volume. In short, pressure is a measure of the [[enthalpy]] per unit volume of a system. A pressure gradient has the potential to perform work on the surroundings by converting enthalpy to work until equilibrium is reached.

==Introduction to energy density==
&lt;!-- This section in intended for learners, and therefore covers only common materials, and omits excessive detail --&gt;

There are many different types of energy stored in materials, and it takes a particular type of reaction to release each type of energy. In order of the typical magnitude of the energy released, these types of reactions are: nuclear, chemical, electrochemical, and electrical.

[[Nuclear reaction]]s are used by stars and nuclear power plants, both of which derive energy from the binding energy of nuclei. [[Chemical reaction]]s are used by animals to derive energy from food, and by automobiles to derive energy from gasoline. Liquid hydrocarbons (fuels such as gasoline, diesel and kerozene) are today the most dense way known to economically store and  transport chemical energy at a very large scale (1 kg of diesel fuel burns with the oxygen contained in ~15 kg of air). [[Electrochemical reaction]]s are used by most mobile devices such as laptop computers and mobile phones to release the energy from batteries.

===Energy densities of common energy storage materials===
{{refimprove section|date=December 2017}}

&lt;!-- STOP!!! This section is for a basic overview comparison of common energy storage materials. Before adding any items, first ask yourself: Is this material used on a large scale to produce energy, or is it commonly discussed in everyday journalism? If so, go ahead and add it! --&gt;

The following is a list of the thermal energy densities (that is to say: the amount of heat energy that can be extracted) of commonly used or well-known energy storage materials; it doesn't include uncommon or experimental materials. Note that this list does not consider the mass of reactants commonly available such as the oxygen required for combustion or the energy efficiency in use. An extended version of this table is found at [[Energy density#Extended Reference Table]]. Major reference = &lt;ref name="engineeringtoolbox"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/fossil-fuels-energy-content-d_1298.html |title=Fossil and Alternative Fuels - Energy Content (2008).  |publisher=Engineering ToolBox |accessdate=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The following unit conversions may be helpful when considering the data in the table: 3.6&amp;nbsp;[[Joule|MJ]] = 1&amp;nbsp;[[Kilowatt hour|kWh]] ≈ 1.34&amp;nbsp;[[Horsepower-hour|HPh]].

==Energy density in energy storage and in fuel==
[[File:Energy density.svg|thumb|400px|Selected energy densities plot&lt;ref name=tzar1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar6 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar7 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar8 /&gt;]]

In [[energy storage]] applications the energy density relates the [[mass]] of an energy store to the volume of the storage facility, e.g. the [[fuel]] tank. The higher the energy density of the fuel, the more energy may be stored or transported for the same amount of volume. The energy density of a fuel per unit mass is called the [[specific energy]] of that fuel. In general an [[engine]] using that fuel will generate less [[kinetic energy]] due to [[inefficiency|inefficiencies]] and [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] considerations—hence the [[Thrust specific fuel consumption|specific fuel consumption]] of an engine will always be greater than its rate of production of the kinetic energy of motion.

===Nuclear energy sources===&lt;!--esoterica to most readers--&gt;
The greatest energy source by far is mass itself.  This energy, ''E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'', where ''m = ρV'', ''ρ'' is the mass per unit volume, ''V'' is the volume of the mass itself and ''c'' is the speed of light.  This energy, however, can be released only by the processes of [[nuclear fission]] (0.1%), [[nuclear fusion]] (1%), or the annihilation of some or all of the matter in the volume ''V'' by matter-[[antimatter]] collisions (100%).{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}  Nuclear reactions cannot be realized by chemical reactions such as combustion.  Although greater matter densities can be achieved, the density of a [[neutron star]] would approximate the most dense system capable of matter-antimatter annihilation possible.  A [[black hole]], although denser than a neutron star, does not have an equivalent anti-particle form, but would offer the same 100% conversion rate of mass to energy in the form of Hawking radiation. In the case of relatively small black holes (smaller than astronomical objects) the power output would be tremendous.

The highest density sources of energy aside from antimatter are [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] and [[Nuclear fission|fission]]. Fusion includes energy from the sun which will be available for billions of years (in the form of sunlight) but so far (2018), sustained [[fusion power]] production continues to be elusive. 

Power from fission of uranium and thorium in [[nuclear power]] plants will be available for many decades or even centuries because of the plentiful supply of the elements on earth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/Uranium-Resources/Supply-of-Uranium/ |title=Supply of Uranium |publisher=world-nuclear.org |date=2014-10-08 |accessdate=2015-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the full potential of this source can only be realised through [[breeder reactor]]s, which are, apart from the [[BN-600 reactor]], not yet used commercially.&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/progress/cohen.html |title=Facts from Cohen |publisher=Formal.stanford.edu |date=2007-01-26 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coal]], [[gas]], and [[petroleum]] are the current primary energy sources in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/pecss_diagram.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506022627/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/pecss_diagram.html|archivedate=2010-05-06 |title=U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) - Annual Energy Review |publisher=Eia.doe.gov |date=2009-06-26 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; but have a much lower energy density. Burning local [[biomass]] fuels supplies household energy needs ([[Biomass Cook Stoves|cooking fires]], [[oil lamp]]s, etc.) worldwide. 

====Thermal power of nuclear fission reactors====
The density of thermal energy contained in the core of a [[light water reactor]] ([[Pressurized water reactor|PWR]] or [[Boiling water reactor|BWR]]) of typically 1 GWe (1 000 MW electrical corresponding to ~3 000 MW thermal) is in the range of 10 to 100 MW of thermal energy per cubic meter of cooling water depending on the location considered in the system (the core itself (~30 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), the reactor pressure vessel (~50 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), or the whole primary circuit (~300 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)). This represents a considerable density of energy which requires under all circumstances a continuous water flow at high velocity in order to be able to remove the [[heat]] from the core, even after an emergency shutdown of the reactor. The incapacity to cool the cores of three [[boiling water reactor]]s (BWR) at [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]] in 2011 after the [[tsunami]] and the resulting loss of the external electrical power and of the cold source was the cause of the meltdown of the three cores in only a few hours. Meanwhile, the three reactors were correctly shut down just after the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Tōhoku earthquake]]. This extremely high power density distinguishes nuclear power plants (NPP's) from any thermal power plants (burning coal, fuel or gas) or any chemical plants and explains the large redundancy required to permanently control the [[Nuclear chain reaction|neutron reactivity]] and to remove the residual heat from the core of NPP's.

===Broad implications===
Energy density differs from [[energy conversion efficiency]] (net output per input) or [[embodied energy]] (the energy output costs to provide, as [[energy industry|harvesting]], [[Oil refinery|refining]], distributing, and dealing with [[pollution]] all use energy). Large scale, intensive energy use impacts and is impacted by [[climate]], [[nuclear waste|waste storage]], and [[deforestation|environmental consequences]].

No single energy storage method boasts the best in [[Power-to-weight ratio|specific power]], [[specific energy]], and energy density. [[Peukert's Law]] describes how the amount of useful energy that can be obtained (for a lead-acid cell) depends on how quickly we pull it out.  To maximize both specific energy and energy density, one can compute the [[specific energy|specific energy density]] of a substance by multiplying the two values together, where the higher the number, the better the substance is at storing energy efficiently.

Alternative options are discussed for energy storage to increase energy density and decrease charging time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ionescu-Zanetti|first1=C.|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Nanogap capacitors: Sensitivity to sample permittivity changes|date=2005|volume=99|issue=2|doi=10.1063/1.2161818|bibcode=2006JAP....99b4305I}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naoi|first1=K.|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=New generation "nanohybrid supercapacitor".|journal=Accounts of Chemical Research|date=2013|doi=10.1021/ar200308h}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hubler|first1=A.|last2=Osuagwu|first2=O.|title=Digital quantum batteries: Energy and information storage in nanovacuum tube arrays|journal=Complexity|date=2010|volume=15|issue=5|doi=10.1002/cplx.20306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lyon|first1=D.|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Gap size dependence of the dielectric strength in nano vacuum gaps|journal=: IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation|date=2013|volume=2|issue=4|doi=10.1109/TDEI.2013.6571470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gravimetric]] and [[volumetric]] energy density of some fuels and storage technologies (modified from the [[Gasoline]] article):
:Note: Some values may not be precise because of [[isomers]] or other irregularities.  See [[Heating value]] for a comprehensive table of specific energies of important fuels.
:Note: Also it is important to realise that generally the density values for chemical fuels do not include the weight of oxygen required for combustion. This is typically two oxygen atoms per carbon atom, and one per two hydrogen atoms. The [[atomic weight]] of carbon and oxygen are similar, while hydrogen is much lighter than oxygen. Figures are presented this way for those fuels where in practice air would only be drawn in locally to the burner. This explains the apparently lower energy density of materials that already include their own oxidiser (such as gunpowder and TNT), where the mass of the oxidiser in effect adds dead weight, and absorbs some of the energy of combustion to dissociate and liberate oxygen to continue the reaction. This also explains some apparent anomalies, such as the energy density of a sandwich appearing to be higher than that of a stick of dynamite.

===Energy densities ignoring external components===
This table lists energy densities of systems that require external components, such as oxidisers or a heat sink or source. These figures do not take into account the mass and volume of the required components as they are assumed to be freely available and present in the atmosphere. Such systems cannot be compared with self-contained systems. These values may not be computed at the same reference conditions.
&lt;!-- To ensure this table sorts correctly: avoid using "-" or unicode dash in columns with numbers; ensure each row has a single numeric value, use data-sort-value="0" |  if unknown; do not use ? or {{?}}; do not use "A to B", nor "C (approximately)"; provide a cite for each value. Test changes on several browsers as sort behaviour may vary. --&gt;

==Energy density of electric and magnetic fields==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Special relativity]] --&gt;
[[Electric field|Electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s store energy.  In a vacuum, the (volumetric) energy density is given by

:&lt;math&gt; u = \frac{\varepsilon_0}{2} \mathbf{E}^2 + \frac{1}{2\mu_0} \mathbf{B}^2 &lt;/math&gt;

where '''E''' is the [[electric field]] and '''B''' is the [[magnetic field]]. The solution will be (in SI units) in Joules per cubic metre. In the context of [[magnetohydrodynamics]], the physics of conductive fluids, the magnetic energy density behaves like an additional [[pressure]] that adds to the [[kinetic theory of gas|gas pressure]] of a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]].

In normal (linear and nondispersive) substances, the energy density (in SI units) is

:&lt;math&gt; u = \frac{1}{2} ( \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{D} + \mathbf{H} \cdot \mathbf{B} ) &lt;/math&gt;

where '''D''' is the [[electric displacement field]] and '''H''' is the [[Effective magnetic field|magnetizing field]].

In the case of absence of magnetic fields, by exploting [[Herbert Fröhlich|Fröhlich's relationships]] it is also possible to extend these equations to [[anisotropic|anisotropy]] and [[nonlinear|nonlinearity]] dielectrics, as well as to calculate the correlated [[Helmholtz free energy]] and [[entropy]] densities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Parravicini | first1 = J. | doi = 10.1016/j.physb.2018.04.029 | title = Thermodynamic potentials in anisotropic and nonlinear dielectrics | journal = Physica B | volume = 541 | pages = 54-60 | year = 2018 | bibcode = 2018PhyB..541...54P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22527">'''Energy management''' includes planning and operation of [[energy production]] and [[energy consumption]] units. Objectives are [[Energy conservation|resource conservation]], [[climate protection]] and [[Saving|cost savings]], while the users have permanent access to the energy they need. It is connected closely to [[environmental management]], [[Manufacturing process management|production management]], [[logistics]] and other established business functions. The [[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure|VDI-Guideline]] 4602 released a definition which includes the economic dimension: “Energy management is the proactive, organized and systematic coordination of procurement, [[Energy transformation|conversion]], [[Energy distribution|distribution]] and use of energy to meet the requirements, taking into account environmental and economic objectives”.&lt;ref&gt;VDI-Guideline VDI 4602, page 3, Beuth Verlag, Berlin 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy efficiency ==

===Base line of energy assessment===
One of initial steps for an effective energy cost control program is the base line energy assessment, which examines the pattern of existing energy usage by the government or any sub-entity of the government or private organization. This program will set the reference point for improvements in energy efficiency. Energy efficiency can improve the existing energy usage and benchmarking of every individual section such as area, sub-area and the industry etc .

== Organizational integration ==
It is important to integrate the energy management in the organizational structure, so that the energy management can be implemented. Responsibilities and the interaction of the decision makers should be regularized. The delegation of functions and competencies extend from the top management to the executive worker. Furthermore, a comprehensive [[wikt:coordination|coordination]] can ensure the fulfillment of the tasks.

It is advisable to establish a separate organizational unit “energy management” in large or energy-intensive companies. This unit supports the senior management and keeps track. It depends on the basic form of the [[organizational structure]], where this unit is connected. In case of a [[functional organization]] the unit is located directly between the first ([[CEO]]) and the second hierarchical level (corporate functions such as production, [[procurement]], [[marketing]]). In a divisional organization, there should be a central and several sector-specific energy management units. So the diverse needs of the individual [[Sector (economic)|sector]]s and the coordination between the branches and the head office can be fulfilled. In a [[matrix management|matrix organization]] the energy management can be included as a matrix function and thus approach most functions directly.

== Energy management in operational functions ==

=== Facility management ===
[[Facility management]] is an important part of energy management, because a huge proportion (average 25 per cent) of complete [[operating cost]]s are energy costs. According to the [[International Facility Management Association]] (IFMA), facility management is "a profession that encompasses multiple disciplines to ensure functionality of the built environment by integrating people, place, processes and technology."

The central task of energy management is to reduce costs for the provision of energy in buildings and facilities without compromising work processes. Especially the availability and service life of the equipment and the ease of use should remain the same. The German Facility Management Association (GEFMA e.V.) has published guidelines (e.g. GEFMA 124-1 and 124-2), which contain methods and ways of dealing with the integration of energy management in the context of a successful facility management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gefma.de/uploads/tx_ttproducts/datasheet/GEFMA124-1S1.2009-11.pdf|title=GEFMA: Energiemanagement Grundlagen und Leistungsbild|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this topic the facility manager has to deal with economic, ecological, risk-based and quality-based targets. He tries to minimize the total cost of the energy-related processes (supply, distribution and use).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy20.net/pi/index.php?StoryID=317&amp;articleID=154847 |title=viewed 10. November 2012 |publisher=Energy20.net |date=2010-02-03 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Passive house scheme 1.svg|thumb|300px|The '''Passivhaus''' uses a combination of [[:category:low-energy building|low-energy building]] techniques and technologies]]

The most important key figure in this context is [[kilowatt-hour]]s per square meter per year (kWh/m²a). Based on this key figure properties can be classified according to their energy consumption.

* Europe: In Germany a [[low-energy house]] can have a maximum energy consumption of 70 kWh/m²a.
*North America: In the [[United States]], the [[ENERGY STAR]] program is the largest program defining low-energy homes. Homes earning ENERGY STAR certification use at least 15% less energy than standard new homes built to the International Residential Code, although homes typically achieve 20%-30% savings.&lt;ref&gt;"Features of ENERGY STAR Qualified New Homes." - EnergyStar.gov, Retrieved 7 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison, the [[Passive house]] (Passivhaus in German) ultra-low-energy standard, currently undergoing adoption in some other European countries, has a maximum space heating requirement of 15 kWh/m²a. A Passive House is a very well-insulated and virtually air-tight building. It does not require a conventional heating system. It is heated by solar gain and internal gains from people. Energy losses are minimized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://passiv.de/en/02_informations/01_whatisapassivehouse/01_whatisapassivehouse.htm |title=retrieved 8 December 2012 |publisher=Passiv.de |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also buildings that produce more energy (for example by [[solar water heating]] or [[photovoltaic system]]s) over the course of a year than it imports from external sources. These buildings are called [[energy-plus-house]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plusenergiehaus.de/index.php?p=home&amp;pid=8&amp;L=0&amp;host=1#a1 |title=retrieved 3 December 2012 |publisher=Plusenergiehaus.de |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the work regulations manage competencies, roles and responsibilities. Because the systems also include risk factors (e.g., oil tanks, gas lines), you must ensure that all tasks are clearly described and distributed. A clear regulation can help to avoid liability risks.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung, p. 75 – 77, Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Logistics ===
[[File:A8 bei Derching LKW Richtung München MAN Mercedes.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Carriage of goods]]
Logistics is the [[management]] of the flow of [[resources]] between the point of origin and the point of destination in order to meet some requirements, for example of customers or corporations. Especially the core logistics task, transportation of the goods, can save costs and protect the environment through efficient energy management. The relevant factors are the choice of means of transportation, duration and length of transportation and cooperation with logistics service providers.

The logistics causes more than 14% percent of CO2 emissions worldwide. For this reason the term [[Green Logistics]] is becoming increasingly important.

Possible courses of action in terms of green logistics are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iml.fraunhofer.de/de/themengebiete/umwelt_ressourcenlogistik/umwelt_ressourcen/Green_Logistics.html |title=retrieved on November 10, 2012 |publisher=Iml.fraunhofer.de |date=2013-12-20 |accessdate=2013-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101010036/http://www.iml.fraunhofer.de/de/themengebiete/umwelt_ressourcenlogistik/umwelt_ressourcen/Green_Logistics.html |archivedate=2014-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Shift to ecofriendly transport carrier such as railroad and waterway
* Route and load optimization
* Formation of corporate networks, which are connected by logistics service
* Optimizing physical logistics processes by providing a sophisticated IT support

Besides transportation of goods, the transport of persons should be an important part of the logistic strategy of organizations. In case of business trips it is important to attract attention to the choice and the proportionality of the means of transport. It should be balanced whether a physical presence is mandatory or a telephone or video conference is just as useful. Home Office is another possibility in which the company can protect the environment indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: ''Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung.'' Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}, p.103-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy procurement ===
Procurement is the acquisition of goods or services. Energy prices fluctuate constantly, which can significantly affect the energy bill of organizations. Therefore poor energy procurement decisions can be expensive. Organizations can control and reduce energy costs by taking a proactive and efficient approach to buying energy. Even a change of the energy source can be a profitable and eco-friendly alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energieagentur.nrw.de/unternehmen/energiebeschaffung-3699.asp |title=retrieved 10 November 2012 |publisher=Energieagentur.nrw.de |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Production ===
Production is the act of creating output, a good or service which has value and contributes to the utility of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., Brown, L., and Adam, S. (2006) Marketing, 7th Ed. Pearson Education Australia/Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; This central process may differ depending on the industry. Industrial companies have facilities that require a lot of energy. Service companies, in turn, do not need many materials, their energy-related focus is mainly facility management or Green IT. Therefore the energy-related focus has to be identified first, then evaluated and optimize.

=== Production planning and control ===
Usually, production is the area with the largest energy consumption within an organization. Therefore also the production planning and control becomes very important. It deals with the operational, temporal, quantitative and spatial planning, control and management of all processes that are necessary in the production of goods and commodities. The "production planner" should plan the production processes so that they operate in an energy efficient way. For example, strong power consumer can be moved into the night time. Peaks should be avoided for the benefit of a unified [[load profile]].

The impending changes in the structure of energy production require an increasing demand for storage capacity. The Production planning and control has to deal with the problem of limited [[energy storage|storability of energy]]. In principle there is the possibility to store energy electrically, mechanically or chemically. Another trend-setting technology is lithium-based electrochemical storage, which can be used in electric vehicles or as an option to control the power grid. The German [[Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology]] realized the significance of this topic and established an initiative with the aim to promote technological breakthroughs and support the rapid introduction of new energy storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmwi.de/English/Navigation/Press/press-releases,did=487632.html |title=retrieved 6 December 2012 |language=de |publisher=Bmwi.de |date=2012-04-24 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maintenance ===
Maintenance is the combination of all technical and administrative actions, including supervision actions, intended to retain an item in, or restore it to, a state in which it can perform a required function.&lt;ref&gt;British Standard Glossary of terms (3811:1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Detailed maintenance is essential to support the energy management. Hereby power losses and cost increases can be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ps-consulting.de/industrie/IH-Energiemanagement.html |title=abgerufen am 12. November 2012 |publisher=Ps-consulting.de |date=2013-11-21 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy management challenge===
Through the energy efficiency it management is remain the key for the any industrial user across globe , to achieve  the energy management goal for the federal government or  industry  the efficiency of water and energy resources play a vital role

Examples of how it is possible to save energy and costs with the help of maintenance:

* Defrost the fridges
* Check the barometer of cars and trucks
* Insulation of hot systems
* Improve leaks in building envelopes

== Energy strategies ==
A long-term energy strategy should be part of the overall strategy of a company. This strategy may include the objective of increasing the use of renewable energies. Furthermore, criteria for decisions on energy investments, such as yield expectations, are determined.&lt;ref&gt;J. Kals, K. Würtenberger: IT-unterstütztes Energiemanagement in: HMD - Praxis der Wirtschaftsinformatik HMD, Heft 285/2012, S. 73-81.&lt;/ref&gt; By formulating an energy strategy companies have the opportunity to avoid risks and to assure a competitive advance against their business rivals.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: ''Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung.'' Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Potential energy strategies ===
According to Kals there are the following energy strategies:&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: ''Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung.'' Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}, p. 182-184.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Passive Strategy: There is no systematic planning. The issue of energy and environmental management is not perceived as an independent field of action. The organization only deals with the most essential subjects.
* Strategy of short-term profit maximization: The management is concentrating exclusively on measures that have a relatively short [[payback period]] and a high return. Measures with low profitability are not considered.
* Strategy of long-term profit maximization: This strategy includes that you have a high knowledge of the energy price and technology development. The relevant measures (for example, [[heat exchanger]]s or [[power station]]s) can have durations of several decades. Moreover, these measures can help to improve the [[image]] and increase the [[motivation]] of the employees.
* Realization of all financially attractive energy measures: This strategy has the goal to implement all measures that have a positive return on investment.
* Maximum strategy: For the climate protection one is willing to change even the object of the company.

In reality, you usually find hybrid forms of different strategies.

=== Energy strategies of companies ===
Many companies are trying to promote its image and time protect the climate through a proactive and public energy strategy. [[General Motors]] (GM) strategy is based on continuous improvement. Furthermore they have six principles: e.g. restoring and preserving the environment, reducing waste and pollutants, educating the public about environmental conservation, collaboration for the development of environmental laws and regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gm.com/vision/environment1/our_commitment.html |title=retrieved 21. December 2012 |publisher=Gm.com |date=2012-01-13 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nokia]] created its first climate strategy in 2006. The strategy tries to evaluate the energy consumption and [[greenhouse gas]] emissions of products and operations and sets reduction targets accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Global&amp;nbsp; Change country |url=http://www.nokia.com/global/about-nokia/people-and-planet/operations/operations/ |title=retrieved 22. December 2012 |publisher=Nokia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, their environmental efforts is based on four key issues: substance management, energy efficiency, recycling, promoting environmental sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Global&amp;nbsp; Change country |url=http://www.nokia.com/global/about-nokia/people-and-planet/strategy/strategy-and-reports/ |title=retrieved 22. December 2012 |publisher=Nokia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The energy strategy of [[Volkswagen]] (VW) is based on environmentally friendly products and a resource-efficient production according to the "Group Strategy 2018".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkswagenag.com/content/vwcorp/content/en/sustainability_and_responsibility/Model_of_Sustainable_Development/Strategy_2018.html |title=retrieved 22. December 2012. |publisher=Volkswagenag.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all locations of the Group are certified to the international standard ISO 14001 for environmental management systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volkswagen.de/de/Volkswagen/nachhaltigkeit/management_und_daten/management/umweltzertifikat.html retrieved 22. December 2012.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114083829/http://www.volkswagen.de/de/Volkswagen/nachhaltigkeit/management_und_daten/management/umweltzertifikat.html |date=November 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When looking at the energy strategies of companies it is important to you have the topic [[greenwashing]] in mind. This is a form of propaganda in which green strategies are used to promote the opinion that an organization's aims are environmentally friendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenwashingindex.com/about-greenwashing/ |title=retrieved 16.01.2013 |publisher=Greenwashingindex.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy strategies of politics ===
Even many countries formulate energy strategies. The [[Swiss Federal Council]] decided in May 2011 to resign nuclear energy medium-dated. The nuclear power plants will be shut down at the end of life and will not be replaced. In Compensation they put the focus on energy efficiency, [[renewable energies]], [[fossil energy]] sources and the development of [[water power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfe.admin.ch/themen/00526/00527/index.html?lang=de |title=retrieved 14. December 2012 |publisher=Bfe.admin.ch |date=2013-12-12 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union]] has clear instructions for its members. The "20-20-20-targets" include, that the [[Member state of the European Union|Member States]] have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% below 1990 levels, increase energy efficiency by 20% and achieve a 20% share of renewable energy in total energy consumption by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmwi.de/DE/Themen/Energie/Energiepolitik/europaeische-energiepolitik.html |title=retrieved 14. December 2012 |language=de |publisher=Bmwi.de |date=2012-07-04 |accessdate=2013-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101085821/http://www.bmwi.de/DE/Themen/Energie/Energiepolitik/europaeische-energiepolitik.html |archivedate=2014-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethical and normative basis of the energy strategies ===
The basis of every energy strategy is the [[corporate culture]] and the related ethical standards applying in the company.&lt;ref&gt;J. Kals, K. Würtenberger: IT-unterstütztes Energiemanagement in: HMD - Praxis der Wirtschaftsinformatik HMD, Heft 285/2012, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethics]], in the sense of [[business ethics]], examines ethical principles and moral or ethical issues that arise in a business environment. Ethical standards can appear in company guidelines, energy and environmental policies or other documents.

The most relevant ethical ideas for the energy management are:

* [[Utilitarianism]]: This form of ethics has the maxim that the one acts are good or right, whose consequences are optimal for the welfare of all those affected by the action (principle of maximum happiness). In terms of energy management, the existence of external costs should be considered. They do not directly affect those who profit from the economic activity but non-participants like future generations. This error in the market mechanism can be solved by the [[internalization]] of [[external cost]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: ''Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung.'' Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Discourse ethics|Argumentation Ethics]]: This fundamental ethical idea says that everyone who is affected by the [[Decision making|decision]], must be involved in decision making. This is done in a fair [[dialogue]], the result is completely uncertain.&lt;ref name="odpowiedzialny6"&gt;Johannes Kals: Business Ethics and Corporate Energy Management, in: Karczewski, Leszek; Kretek, Henryk (eds): Odpowiedzialny biznes i konsumerysm wyzwaniem XXI Wieku (Responsible Business and Responsible Consumerism as a Challenge of the 21st Century), Polen, Raciborz 2012, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Deontological ethics]]: The deontological ethics assigns individuals and organizations certain obligations. A general example is the [[golden rule]]: "One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself." Therefore everyone should manage their duties and make an energy economic contribution.&lt;ref name="odpowiedzialny6"/&gt;

'''Energy rate density''' is the amount of [[Thermodynamic_free_energy|free energy]] per unit [[time]] per unit [[mass]] (in CGS metric units erg/s/g; in MKS units joule/s/kg).  It is terminologically (but not always numerically) equivalent to [[power density]] when measured in SI units of W/kg.  Regardless of the units used, energy rate density describes the flow of energy through any system of given mass, and has been proposed as a measure of system complexity. The more complex the system, the more energy flows per second through each gram. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2011 | title = Energy Rate Density as a Complexity Metric and Evolutionary Driver | url = https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/EnergyRateDensity_I_FINAL_2011.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Complexity | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 27–40 | doi = 10.1002/cplx.20323 | bibcode = 2011Cmplx..16c..27C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chaisson2014&gt;[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/big_history_review_Chaisson_TSWJ2014.pdf "The Natural Science Underlying Big History,"] ''The Scientific World Journal'', v 2014, 41 pgs, 2014; {{DOI|10.1155/2014/384912}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Chaisson's figure2.jpg|thumb|Energy rate density for a wide spectrum of systems is plotted versus the number of billion years ago they first appeared.

For example, in astronomy it is called the luminosity-to-mass ratio (the inverse of the [[mass-luminosity ratio]]), in physics the power density, in geology the specific [[radiant flux]] (where “specific” denotes per unit mass), in biology the specific [[metabolic rate]], and in engineering the [[power-to-weight ratio]].  Interdisciplinary researchers prefer to use the general term, energy rate density, not only to stress the intuitive notion of energy flow (in contrast to more colloquial connotations of the word "power"), but also to unify its potential application among all the natural sciences,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/ASUessay_revised_for_CUP.pdf "Using Complexity Science to Search for Unity in the Natural Sciences,"] In ''Complexity and the Arrow of Time'', Lineweaver, Davies and Ruse (eds.), Cambridge Univ.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1805">A '''Gold universe''' is a [[cosmology|cosmological]] model of the [[universe]].  In these models, the universe starts with a [[Big Bang]] and expands for some time, with increasing [[entropy]] and a  [[thermodynamic]] [[arrow of time]] pointing in the direction of the expansion.  After the universe reaches a low-density state, it recontracts, but entropy now decreases, pointing the thermodynamic arrow of time in the opposite direction, until the universe ends in a low-entropy, high-density [[Big Crunch]]. 
There are two models of the universe which support the possibility of a reversed direction of time. The first begins with a state of low entropy at the Big Bang which continually increases until the Big Crunch. The second, a Gold Universe, posits that entropy will increase only until a moment of contraction, then gradually decrease. This latter model suggests the universe will become more orderly after the moment of contraction. The Gold model has been linked to the possibility of retrocausal change, questions concerning the preservation of information in a time-reversed universe (states of decreasing entropy), and [[Causality (physics)|causation]] in general.  The Gold Universe is named after the cosmologist [[Thomas Gold]], who proposed the model in the 1960s.

This '''timeline of the Big Bang''' shows a sequence of events as currently theorized by scientists. 

It is a [[logarithmic scale]] that shows &lt;math&gt;10 \cdot \log_{10}&lt;/math&gt; ''second'' instead of ''second''. For example, one microsecond is &lt;math&gt;10 \cdot \log_{10} 0.000 001 = 10 \cdot (-6) = -60&lt;/math&gt;. To convert −30 read on the scale to second calculate &lt;math&gt;10^{-\frac{30}{10}} = 10^{-3} = 0.001&lt;/math&gt; second = one millisecond. On a logarithmic time scale a step lasts ten times longer than the previous step.

'''Hardness''' is a measure of the resistance to localized plastic deformation induced by either mechanical indentation or abrasion. Some materials (e.g. [[Metal|metals]]) are harder than others (e.g. [[Plastic|plastics]], [[wood]]). Macroscopic hardness is generally characterized by strong [[intermolecular bond]]s, but the behavior of solid materials under force is complex; therefore, there are different measurements of hardness: ''scratch hardness'', ''indentation hardness'', and ''rebound hardness''.

Hardness is dependent on [[ductility]], [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] [[stiffness]], [[plasticity (physics)|plasticity]], [[deformation (mechanics)|strain]], [[Strength of materials|strength]], [[toughness]], [[viscoelasticity]], and [[viscosity]].

Common examples of '''hard matter''' are [[ceramic]]s, [[concrete]], certain [[metal]]s, and [[superhard material]]s, which can be contrasted with [[soft matter]].

==Measuring hardness==
[[Image:Vickers-tester.jpg|thumb|A Vickers hardness tester]]

There are three main types of hardness measurements: ''scratch'', ''indentation'', and ''rebound''. Within each of these classes of measurement there are individual measurement scales. For practical reasons [[hardness comparison|conversion tables]] are used to convert between one scale and another.

===Scratch hardness{{Anchor|Scratch hardness}}===

{{main|Scratch hardness}}

Scratch hardness is the measure of how resistant a sample is to [[fracture]] or permanent [[plastic deformation]] due to friction from a sharp object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wredenberg|first=Fredrik|author2=PL Larsson|title=Scratch testing of metals and polymers: Experiments and numerics|journal=Wear|date=2009|doi=10.1016/j.wear.2008.05.014|volume=266|issue=1–2|pages=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle is that an object made of a harder material will scratch an object made of a softer material. When testing coatings, scratch hardness refers to the force necessary to cut through the film to the substrate. The most common test is [[Mohs scale]], which is used in [[mineralogy]]. One tool to make this measurement is the [[sclerometer]].

Another tool used to make these tests is the pocket hardness tester. This tool consists of a scale arm with graduated markings attached to a four-wheeled carriage. A scratch tool with a sharp rim is mounted at a predetermined angle to the testing surface. In order to use it a weight of known mass is added to the scale arm at one of the graduated markings, the tool is then drawn across the test surface. The use of the weight and markings allows a known pressure to be applied without the need for complicated machinery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.byk.com/en/instruments/products/download.php?doc=74 Hoffman Scratch Hardness Tester] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323002752/https://www.byk.com/en/instruments/products/download.php?doc=74 |date=2014-03-23 }}. byk.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indentation hardness===
{{main|Indentation hardness}}

Indentation hardness measures the resistance of a sample to material deformation due to a constant compression load from a sharp object. Tests for indentation hardness are primarily used in [[engineering]] and [[metallurgy]] fields. The tests work on the basic premise of measuring the critical dimensions of an indentation left by a specifically dimensioned and loaded indenter.

Common indentation hardness scales are [[Rockwell scale|Rockwell]], [[Vickers hardness test|Vickers]], [[Shore scale|Shore]], and [[Brinell hardness test|Brinell]], amongst others.

===Rebound hardness===
Rebound hardness, also known as ''dynamic hardness'', measures the height of the "bounce" of a diamond-tipped hammer dropped from a fixed height onto a material. This type of hardness is related to [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]. The device used to take this measurement is known as a [[scleroscope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Allen | first = Robert | title = A guide to rebound hardness and scleroscope test | date = 2006-12-10 | url = http://www.articlestree.com/science/a-guide-to-rebound-hardness-and-scleroscope-test-tx301428.html | accessdate = 2008-09-08 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120718022923/http://www.articlestree.com/science/a-guide-to-rebound-hardness-and-scleroscope-test-tx301428.html | archivedate = 2012-07-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two scales that measures rebound hardness are the [[Leeb rebound hardness test]] and [[Bennett hardness scale]].

==Hardening==
{{Main|Hardening (metallurgy)}}

There are five hardening processes: [[Hall-Petch strengthening]], [[work hardening]], [[solid solution strengthening]], [[precipitation hardening]], and [[martensitic transformation]].

==Physics==
[[Image:stress-strain1.svg|thumb|Diagram of a [[stress-strain curve]], showing the relationship between [[Stress (physics)|stress]] (force applied per unit area) and [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] or [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]] of a ductile metal.]]

In [[solid mechanics]], solids generally have three responses to [[force]], depending on the amount of force and the type of material:
* They exhibit [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]—the ability to temporarily change shape, but return to the original shape when the pressure is removed. "Hardness" in the elastic range—a small temporary change in shape for a given force—is known as [[stiffness]] in the case of a given object, or a high [[elastic modulus]] in the case of a material.
* They exhibit [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]]—the ability to permanently change shape in response to the force, but remain in one piece. The [[Yield (engineering)|yield strength]] is the point at which elastic deformation gives way to plastic deformation. Deformation in the plastic range is non-linear, and is described by the [[stress-strain curve]]. This response produces the observed properties of scratch and indentation hardness, as described and measured in materials science. Some materials exhibit both [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] and [[viscosity]] when undergoing plastic deformation; this is called [[viscoelasticity]].
* They [[fracture]]—split into two or more pieces.

[[Strength of materials|Strength]] is a measure of the extent of a material's elastic range, or elastic and plastic ranges together. This is quantified as [[compressive strength]], [[shear strength]], [[tensile strength]] depending on the direction of the forces involved. [[Ultimate strength]] is an engineering measure of the maximum load a part of a specific material and geometry can withstand.

[[Brittleness]], in technical usage, is the tendency of a material to fracture with very little or no detectable plastic deformation beforehand. Thus in technical terms, a material can be both brittle and strong. In everyday usage "brittleness" usually refers to the tendency to fracture under a small amount of force, which exhibits both brittleness and a lack of strength (in the technical sense). For perfectly brittle materials, yield strength and ultimate strength are the same, because they do not experience detectable plastic deformation. The opposite of brittleness is [[ductility]].

The [[toughness]] of a material is the maximum amount of [[energy]] it can absorb before fracturing, which is different from the amount of [[force]] that can be applied. Toughness tends to be small for brittle materials, because elastic and plastic deformations allow materials to absorb large amounts of energy.

Hardness increases with decreasing [[particle size]]. This is known as the [[Hall-Petch relationship]]. However, below a critical grain-size, hardness decreases with decreasing grain size. This is known as the inverse Hall-Petch effect.

Hardness of a material to deformation is dependent on its microdurability or small-scale [[shear modulus]] in any direction, not to any [[Stiffness|rigidity]] or [[stiffness]] properties such as its [[bulk modulus]] or [[Young's modulus]]. Stiffness is often confused for hardness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Jeandron | first = Michelle | title = Diamonds are not forever | journal = Physics World | date = 2005-08-25 | url = http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/22997 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090215064216/http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/22997 | archivedate = 2009-02-15 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = San-Miguel | first = A. | last2 = Blase | first2 = P. | title = High Pressure Behavior of Silicon Clathrates: A New Class of Low Compressibility Materials | journal = Physical Review | volume = 83 | issue = 25 | date = 1999-05-19 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.83.5290 | pages = 5290 | last3 = Blase | first3 = X. | last4 = Mélinon | first4 = P. | last5 = Perez | first5 = A. | last6 = Itié | first6 = J. | last7 = Polian | first7 = A. | last8 = Reny | first8 = E. | last9 = Cros | first9 = C. | last10 = Pouchard | first10 = M. | bibcode=1999PhRvL..83.5290S| display-authors = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some materials are stiffer than diamond (e.g. osmium) but are not harder, and are prone to [[spall]]ing and flaking in squamose or acicular habits.

===Mechanisms and theory===
[[Image:Close-packed spheres.jpg|thumb|A representation of the crystal lattice showing the planes of atoms.]]

The key to understanding the mechanism behind hardness is understanding the metallic [[microstructure]], or the structure and arrangement of the atoms at the atomic level. In fact, most important metallic properties critical to the manufacturing of today’s goods are determined by the microstructure of a material.&lt;ref name="Haasen"&gt;Haasen, P. (1978). Physical metallurgy. Cambridge [Eng.] ; New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; At the atomic level, the atoms in a metal are arranged in an orderly three-dimensional array called a [[crystal lattice]]. In reality, however, a given specimen of a metal likely never contains a consistent single crystal lattice. A given sample of metal will contain many grains, with each grain having a fairly consistent array pattern. At an even smaller scale, each grain contains irregularities.

There are two types of irregularities at the grain level of the microstructure that are responsible for the hardness of the material. These irregularities are point defects and line defects. A point defect is an irregularity located at a single lattice site inside of the overall three-dimensional lattice of the grain. There are three main point defects. If there is an atom missing from the array, a [[vacancy defect]] is formed. If there is a different type of atom at the lattice site that should normally be occupied by a metal atom, a substitutional defect is formed. If there exists an atom in a site where there should normally not be, an [[interstitial defect]] is formed. This is possible because space exists between atoms in a crystal lattice. While point defects are irregularities at a single site in the crystal lattice, line defects are irregularities on a plane of atoms. [[Dislocations]] are a type of line defect involving the misalignment of these planes. In the case of an edge dislocation, a half plane of atoms is wedged between two planes of atoms. In the case of a screw dislocation two planes of atoms are offset with a helical array running between them.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel, J. (2009). ''Introduction to materials science course manual''. Madison, Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin-Madison.&lt;/ref&gt;

In glasses, hardness seems to depend linearly on the number of topological constraints acting between the atoms of the network.&lt;ref name=mauro2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smedskjaer|first=Morten M.|author2=John C. Mauro |author3=Yuanzheng Yue |title=Prediction of Glass Hardness Using Temperature-Dependent Constraint Theory|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|year=2010|volume=105|issue=11|page=2010|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.115503|pmid=20867584|bibcode=2010PhRvL.105k5503S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the [[Rigidity theory (physics)|rigidity theory]] has allowed predicting hardness values with respect to composition.

[[Image:Dislocation edge d2.jpg|thumb|right|Planes of atoms split by an edge dislocation.]]

Dislocations provide a mechanism for planes of atoms to slip and thus a method for plastic or permanent deformation.&lt;ref name="Haasen" /&gt;  Planes of atoms can flip from one side of the dislocation to the other effectively allowing the dislocation to traverse through the material and the material to deform permanently. The movement allowed by these dislocations causes a decrease in the material's hardness.

The way to inhibit the movement of planes of atoms, and thus make them harder, involves the interaction of dislocations with each other and interstitial atoms. When a dislocation intersects with a second dislocation, it can no longer traverse through the crystal lattice. The intersection of dislocations creates an anchor point and does not allow the planes of atoms to continue to slip over one another&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, W. C. (1981). The physical metallurgy of steels. Washington: Hempisphere Pub. Corp., New York: McGraw-Hill, {{ISBN|0070377804}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A dislocation can also be anchored by the interaction with interstitial atoms. If a dislocation comes in contact with two or more interstitial atoms, the slip of the planes will again be disrupted. The interstitial atoms create anchor points, or pinning points, in the same manner as intersecting dislocations.

By varying the presence of interstitial atoms and the density of dislocations, a particular metal's hardness can be controlled. Although seemingly counter-intuitive, as the density of dislocations increases, there are more intersections created and consequently more anchor points. Similarly, as more interstitial atoms are added, more pinning points that impede the movements of dislocations are formed. As a result, the more anchor points added, the harder the material will become.

'''Intelligent Energy''' is a fuel cell engineering company focused on the development and commercialisation of its PEM fuel cell technologies for a range of markets including automotive, stationary power and UAVs. We are headquartered in the UK, with offices and representation in the US, Japan, India, and China.

== History ==

The origins of Intelligent Energy began at [[Loughborough University]] in the UK during the late 1980s, when the University became one of Europe’s first research and development centres for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell technology. In 1995, the UK’s first kW-level PEM fuel cell stack was produced by the R&amp;D team.  In June of that year, Advanced Power Sources (APS) Ltd was founded as a spin-out from Loughborough University by Paul Adcock, Phil Mitchell, Jon Moore and Anthony Newbold, and was the first company in the UK formed specifically to address the development and commercialisation of PEM fuel cells.

Founded by Harry Bradbury, Intelligent Energy was established in 2001, acquiring Advanced Power Sources Ltd, together with its personnel and fuel cell related intellectual property that originated from research conducted by both APS and Loughborough University into PEM fuel cell technology. This triggered investment and enabled the company to grow its business activities.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;[http://www.cleantechinvestor.com/portal/mainmenucomp/companiesi/586-intelligent-energy-/11138-profile-intelligent-energy-published-in-cleantech-infocus-uk-innovation-in-fuel-cells-and-hydrogen.html Profile: Intelligent Energy - October 2012].

== Technology ==

Intelligent Energy's fuel-cell technology is divided into two platforms: air-cooled (AC) and evaporatively-cooled (EC). The air-cooled fuel cell systems use low-power fans to provide cooling and the oxidant supply for operation. Heat from the fuel cell stack is conducted to cooling plates and removed through airflow channels,  a simplified and cost-effective system for the power range from a few watts to several kilowatts. They  are used in a wide range of UAV, stationary power and automotive applications for two-wheel and small car range extender applications.

Evaporatively-cooled (EC) fuel cell systems provide power generation from a few kilowatts up to 200&amp;nbsp;kW. Efficient thermal management of the EC fuel cell stack reduces system complexity, mass and cost. These  systems are designed for high-volume, low-cost manufacturing, and use modular architecture that can be quickly modified to suit the application.

{{Cosmology|comp/struct}}
The '''ΛCDM''' ('''Lambda cold dark matter''') or '''Lambda-CDM''' model is a [[parametrization]] of the [[Big Bang]] [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] model in which the universe contains a [[cosmological constant]], denoted by [[Lambda]] ([[Greek alphabet|Greek]] '''Λ'''), associated with [[dark energy]], and [[cold dark matter]] (abbreviated '''CDM'''). It is frequently referred to as the '''standard model''' of Big Bang cosmology because it is the simplest model that provides a reasonably good account of the following properties of the cosmos:
* the existence and structure of the [[cosmic microwave background]]
* the [[Observable universe#Large-scale structure|large-scale structure]] in the distribution of galaxies
* the [[abundance of the chemical elements|abundances]] of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|hydrogen (including deuterium), helium, and lithium]]
* the accelerating [[metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]] observed in the light from distant galaxies and [[supernova]]e

The model assumes that [[general relativity]] is the correct theory of gravity on cosmological scales.
It emerged in the late 1990s as a '''concordance cosmology''', after a period of time when disparate observed properties of the universe appeared mutually inconsistent, and there was no consensus on the makeup of the energy density of the universe.

The ΛCDM model can be extended by adding [[cosmological inflation]], [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]] and other elements that are current areas of speculation and research in cosmology.

Some alternative models challenge the assumptions of the ΛCDM model. Examples of these are [[modified Newtonian dynamics]], modified gravity, theories of large-scale variations in the matter density of the universe, and scale invariance of empty space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maeder|first=Andre|date=2017|title=An Alternative to the ΛCDM Model: The Case of Scale Invariance|url=http://stacks.iop.org/0004-637X/834/i=2/a=194|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|language=en|volume=834|issue=2|pages=194|doi=10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/194|issn=0004-637X|arxiv=1701.03964|bibcode=2017ApJ...834..194M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pavel Kroupa|P.

==Overview==
[[File:Lambda-Cold Dark Matter, Accelerated Expansion of the Universe, Big Bang-Inflation.jpg|thumb|upright=2.4|Lambda-CDM, accelerated expansion of the universe. The time-line in this schematic diagram extends from the Big Bang/inflation era 13.7 Byr ago to the present cosmological time.]]
Most modern cosmological models are based on the [[cosmological principle]], which states that our observational location in the universe is not unusual or special; on a large-enough scale, the universe looks the same in all directions ([[isotropy]]) and from every location ([[homogeneity (physics)|homogeneity]]).&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Liddle. ''An Introduction to Modern Cosmology (2nd ed.).'' London: Wiley, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The model includes an expansion of metric space that is well documented both as the [[red shift]] of prominent spectral absorption or emission lines in the light from distant galaxies and as the time dilation in the light decay of supernova luminosity curves. Both effects are attributed to a [[Doppler shift]] in electromagnetic radiation as it travels across expanding space. Although this expansion increases the distance between objects that are not under shared gravitational influence, it does not increase the size of the objects (e.g. galaxies) in space. It also allows for distant galaxies to recede from each other at speeds greater than the speed of light; local expansion is less than the speed of light, but expansion summed across great distances can collectively exceed the speed of light.

The letter &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; (lambda) represents the [[cosmological constant]], which is currently associated with a vacuum energy or [[dark energy]] in empty space that is used to explain the contemporary accelerating expansion of space against the attractive effects of gravity. A cosmological constant has negative pressure, &lt;math&gt; p = - \rho c^{2} &lt;/math&gt;, which contributes to the [[stress-energy tensor]] that, according to the general theory of relativity, causes accelerating expansion. The fraction of the total energy density of our (flat or almost flat) universe that is dark energy, &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{\Lambda}&lt;/math&gt;, is currently (2015) estimated to be 0.692 ± 0.012, or even 0.6911 ± 0.0062 based on [[Planck satellite]] data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/planck-upholds-standard-cosmology-0210201523/ Camille M. Carlisle, ''Planck Upholds Standard Cosmology'', Sky &amp; Telescope, February 10, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dark matter]] is postulated in order to account for gravitational effects observed in very large-scale structures (the "flat" [[rotation curve]]s of galaxies; the [[gravitational lens]]ing of light by galaxy clusters; and enhanced clustering of galaxies) that cannot be accounted for by the quantity of observed matter. [[Cold dark matter]] is ''non-[[baryon]]ic'', i.e. it consists of matter other than protons and neutrons (and electrons, by convention, although electrons are not baryons); ''cold'', i.e. its velocity is far less than the speed of light at the epoch of radiation-matter equality (thus neutrinos are excluded, being non-baryonic but not cold); ''dissipationless'', i.e. it cannot cool by radiating photons; and ''collisionless'', i.e. the dark matter particles interact with each other and other particles only through gravity and possibly the weak force. The dark matter component is currently (2013) estimated to constitute about 26.8% of the mass-energy density of the universe.

The remaining 4.9% (2013) comprises all ordinary matter observed as atoms, chemical elements, gas and plasma, the stuff of which visible planets, stars and galaxies are made. The great majority of ordinary matter in the universe is unseen, since visible stars and gas inside galaxies and clusters account for less than 10% of the ordinary matter contribution to the mass-energy density of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Also, the energy density includes a very small fraction (~ 0.01%) in cosmic microwave background radiation, and not more than 0.5% in [[relic neutrinos]]. Although very small today, these were much more important in the distant past, dominating the matter at redshift &gt; 3200.

The model includes a single originating event, the "Big Bang", which was not an explosion but the abrupt appearance of expanding [[space-time]] containing radiation at temperatures of around 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; K. This was immediately (within 10&lt;sup&gt;−29&lt;/sup&gt; seconds) followed by an exponential expansion of space by a scale multiplier of 10&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; or more, known as [[cosmic inflation]]. The early universe remained hot (above 10,000 K) for several hundred thousand years, a state that is detectable as a residual [[cosmic microwave background]], or CMB, a very low energy radiation emanating from all parts of the sky. The "Big Bang" scenario, with cosmic inflation and standard particle physics, is the only current cosmological model consistent with the observed continuing expansion of space, the observed distribution of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|lighter elements in the universe]] (hydrogen, helium, and lithium), and the spatial texture of minute irregularities ([[Anisotropy|anisotropies]]) in the CMB radiation. Cosmic inflation also addresses the "[[horizon problem]]" in the CMB; indeed, it seems likely that the universe is larger than the observable [[particle horizon]].

The model uses the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]], the [[Friedmann equations]] and the [[Equation of state (cosmology)|cosmological equations of state]] to describe the observable universe from right after the [[Timeline of the Big Bang#Inflationary epoch|inflationary epoch]] to present and future.

== Cosmic expansion history ==
The expansion of the universe is parametrized by a [[dimensionless]] [[scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] &lt;math&gt;a = a(t)&lt;/math&gt; (with time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; counted from the birth of the universe), defined relative to the present day, so &lt;math&gt;a_0 = a(t_0) = 1 &lt;/math&gt;; the usual convention in cosmology is that subscript 0 denotes present-day values, so &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; is the current age of the universe. The scale factor is related to the observed [[Redshift#Expansion of space|redshift]]&lt;ref name="Dodelson"/&gt; &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; of the light emitted at time &lt;math&gt;t_\mathrm{em}&lt;/math&gt; by

:&lt;math&gt;{1 \over a(t_\mathrm{em})} = 1 + z.&lt;/math&gt;
The expansion rate is described by the time-dependent [[Hubble parameter]], &lt;math&gt;H(t)&lt;/math&gt;, defined as
:&lt;math&gt;H(t) \equiv \frac{\dot a}{a},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\dot a&lt;/math&gt; is the time-derivative of the scale factor.  The first [[Friedmann equations|Friedmann equation]] gives the expansion rate in terms of the matter+radiation density {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;,}} the [[Curvature of the universe|curvature]] {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;,}} and the [[cosmological constant]] {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;,}}&lt;ref name="Dodelson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dodelson|first1=Scott|title=Modern cosmology|date=2008|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|location=San Diego, CA [etc.]|isbn=978-0122191411|edition=4. [print.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H^2 = \left(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\right)^2 = \frac{8 \pi G}{3} \rho - \frac{kc^2}{a^2} + \frac{\Lambda c^2}{3}, &lt;/math&gt;

where as usual {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;}} is the speed of light and {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;}} is the [[gravitational constant]]. 
A critical density &lt;math&gt;\rho_\mathrm{crit}&lt;/math&gt; is the present-day density, which gives zero curvature &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, assuming the cosmological constant &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is zero, regardless of its actual value. Substituting these conditions to the Friedmann equation gives

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_\mathrm{crit} = \frac{3 H_0^2}{8 \pi G} = 1.878\;47(23) \times 10^{-26} \; h^2 \; \text{kg} \; \text{m}^{-3},&lt;/math&gt;{{refn|name=constants|{{cite web|url=http://pdg.lbl.gov/2015/reviews/rpp2014-rev-astrophysical-constants.pdf |title=The Review of Particle Physics. 2.

where &lt;math&gt; h \equiv H_0 / (100 \; \mathrm{km \; s^{-1} \; Mpc^{-1}}) &lt;/math&gt; is the reduced Hubble constant.
If the cosmological constant were actually zero, the critical density would also mark the dividing line between eventual recollapse of the universe to a [[Big Crunch]], or unlimited expansion. For the Lambda-CDM model with a positive cosmological constant (as observed), the universe is predicted to expand forever regardless of whether the total density is slightly above or below the critical density; though other outcomes are possible in extended models where the [[dark energy]] is not constant but actually time-dependent.

It is standard to define the present-day '''density parameter''' &lt;math&gt;\Omega_x&lt;/math&gt; for various species as the dimensionless ratio
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_x \equiv \frac{\rho_x(t=t_0)}{\rho_\mathrm{crit} } = \frac{8 \pi G\rho_x(t=t_0)}{3 H_0^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where the subscript &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is one of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; for [[Baryon|baryons]], &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; for [[cold dark matter]], &lt;math&gt;rad&lt;/math&gt; for [[radiation]] ([[Photon|photons]] plus relativistic [[Neutrino|neutrinos]]), and &lt;math&gt;DE&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; for [[dark energy]].

Since the densities of various species scale as different powers of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, e.g. &lt;math&gt;a^{-3}&lt;/math&gt; for matter etc.,
the [[Friedmann equation]] can be conveniently rewritten in terms of the various density parameters as
:&lt;math&gt;H(a) \equiv \frac{\dot{a}}{a} = H_0 \sqrt{ (\Omega_c + \Omega_b) a^{-3} + \Omega_\text{rad} a^{-4} + \Omega_k a^{-2} + \Omega_{DE} a^{-3(1+w)} } &lt;/math&gt;
where w is the [[Equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] of dark energy, and assuming negligible neutrino mass (significant neutrino mass requires a more complex equation). The various &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt; parameters add up to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; by construction.
In the general case this is integrated by computer to give
the expansion history &lt;math&gt;a(t)&lt;/math&gt; and also observable distance-redshift relations for any chosen values of the cosmological parameters, which can then be compared with observations such as [[supernovae]] and [[baryon acoustic oscillations]].

In the minimal 6-parameter Lambda-CDM model, it is assumed that curvature &lt;math&gt;\Omega_k&lt;/math&gt; is zero and &lt;math&gt; w = -1 &lt;/math&gt;, so this simplifies to
:&lt;math&gt; H(a) = H_0 \sqrt{ \Omega_m a^{-3} + \Omega_\text{rad} a^{-4} + \Omega_\Lambda } &lt;/math&gt;

Observations show that the radiation density is very small today, &lt;math&gt; \Omega_\text{rad} \sim 10^{-4} &lt;/math&gt;; if this term is neglected
the above has an analytic solution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frieman|first1=Joshua A.|last2=Turner|first2=Michael S.|last3=Huterer|first3=Dragan|title=Dark Energy and the Accelerating Universe|journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics|year=2008|volume=46|issue=1|pages=385–432|arxiv=0803.0982|doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.46.060407.145243|bibcode=2008ARA&amp;A..46..385F}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; a(t) = (\Omega_m / \Omega_\Lambda)^{1/3} \, \sinh^{2/3} ( t / t_\Lambda) &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; t_\Lambda \equiv 2 / (3 H_0 \sqrt{\Omega_\Lambda} ) \ ; &lt;/math&gt;
this is fairly accurate for &lt;math&gt;a &gt; 0.01&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;t &gt; 10&lt;/math&gt;million years.
Solving for &lt;math&gt; a(t) = 1 &lt;/math&gt; gives the present age of the universe &lt;math&gt; t_0 &lt;/math&gt; in terms of the other parameters.

It follows that the transition from decelerating to accelerating expansion (the second derivative &lt;math&gt; \ddot{a} &lt;/math&gt; crossing zero) occurred when
:&lt;math&gt; a = ( \Omega_m / 2 \Omega_\Lambda )^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt;

which evaluates to &lt;math&gt;a \sim 0.6&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;z \sim 0.66&lt;/math&gt; for the best-fit parameters estimated from the [[Planck spacecraft]].

==Historical development==
The discovery of the [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] (CMB) in 1964 confirmed a key prediction of the [[Big Bang]] cosmology. From that point on, it was generally accepted that the universe started in a hot, dense state and has been expanding over time. The rate of expansion depends on the types of matter and energy present in the universe, and in particular, whether the total density is above or below the so-called critical density. During the 1970s, most attention focused on pure-baryonic models, but there were serious challenges explaining the formation of galaxies, given the small anisotropies in the CMB (upper limits at that time). In the early 1980s, it was realized that this could be resolved if cold dark matter dominated over the baryons, and the theory of [[cosmic inflation]] motivated models with critical density. During the 1980s, most research focused on cold dark matter with critical density in matter, around 95% CDM and 5% baryons: these showed success at forming galaxies and clusters of galaxies, but problems remained; notably, the model required a Hubble constant lower than preferred by observations, and observations around 1988-1990 showed more large-scale galaxy clustering than predicted. These difficulties sharpened with the discovery of CMB anisotropy by [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] in 1992, and several modified CDM models, including ΛCDM and mixed cold and hot dark matter, came under active consideration through the mid-1990s. The ΛCDM model then became the leading model following the observations of [[Accelerating universe|accelerating expansion]] in 1998, and was quickly supported by other observations: in 2000, the [[BOOMERanG]] microwave background experiment measured the total (matter–energy) density to be close to 100% of critical, whereas in 2001 the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey|2dFGRS]] galaxy redshift survey measured the matter density to be near 25%; the large difference between these values supports a positive Λ or [[dark energy]]. Much more precise spacecraft measurements of the microwave background from [[WMAP]] in 2003 – 2010 and [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] in 2013 - 2015 have continued to support the model and pin down the parameter values, most of which are now constrained below 1 percent uncertainty.

There is currently active research into many aspects of the ΛCDM model, both to refine the parameters and possibly detect deviations. In addition, ΛCDM has no explicit physical theory for the origin or physical nature of dark matter or dark energy; the nearly scale-invariant spectrum of the CMB perturbations, and their image across the celestial sphere, are believed to result from very small thermal and acoustic irregularities at the point of recombination. A large majority of astronomers and astrophysicists support the ΛCDM model or close relatives of it, but [[Mordehai Milgrom|Milgrom]], [[Stacy McGaugh|McGaugh]], and [[Pavel Kroupa|Kroupa]] are leading critics, attacking the dark matter portions of the theory from the perspective of [[galaxy formation]] models and supporting the alternative [[MOND]] theory, which requires a modification of the [[Einstein field equations]] and the [[Friedmann equations]] as seen in proposals such as [[MOG theory]] or [[Tensor–vector–scalar gravity|TeVeS theory]]. Other proposals by theoretical astrophysicists of cosmological alternatives to Einstein's general relativity that attempt to account for dark energy or dark matter include [[f(R) gravity]], [[Scalar–tensor theory|scalar–tensor theories]] such as [[galileon]] theories, [[brane cosmology|brane cosmologies]], the [[DGP model]], and [[massive gravity]] and its extensions such as [[bimetric theory|bimetric gravity]].

==Successes==
In addition to explaining pre-2000 observations,
the model has made a number of successful predictions: notably the existence of the
[[baryon acoustic oscillation]] feature, discovered in 2005 in the predicted location; and the statistics of weak [[gravitational lensing]], first observed in 2000 by several teams.

The six free parameters can be well constrained by the TT spectrum alone, and then the TE and EE spectra can be predicted theoretically to few-percent precision with no further adjustments allowed: comparison of theory and observations shows an excellent match.

==Challenges==
Extensive searches for dark matter particles have so far shown no well-agreed detection;
the dark energy may be almost impossible to detect in a laboratory, and its value is [[cosmological constant problem|unnaturally small]] compared to [[vacuum energy|naive theoretical predictions]].

Comparison of the model with observations is very successful on large scales (larger than galaxies, up to the observable horizon), but may have some problems on sub-galaxy scales, possibly predicting [[Dwarf galaxy problem|too many dwarf galaxies]] and too much dark matter in the innermost regions of galaxies. This problem is called the "small scale crisis".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The simple ΛCDM model is based on six [[parameter]]s: physical baryon density parameter; physical dark matter density parameter; the age of the universe; scalar spectral index; curvature fluctuation amplitude; and reionization optical depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The dark side of the cosmology: dark matter and dark energy|author=Spergel, D.

(See below for extended models that allow these to vary.)

The values of these six parameters are mostly not predicted by current theory (though, ideally, they may be related by a future "[[Theory of Everything]]"), except that most versions of [[cosmic inflation]] predict the scalar spectral index should be slightly smaller than 1, consistent with the estimated value 0.96. The parameter values, and uncertainties, are estimated using large computer searches to locate the region of parameter space providing an acceptable match to cosmological observations. From these six parameters, the other model values, such as the [[Hubble's law|Hubble constant]] and the [[dark energy]] density, can be readily calculated.

Commonly, the set of observations fitted includes the [[cosmic microwave background]] anisotropy, the brightness/redshift relation for supernovae, and large-scale galaxy clustering including the [[baryon acoustic oscillation]] feature. Other observations, such as the Hubble constant, the abundance of galaxy clusters, [[weak gravitational lensing]] and globular cluster ages, are generally consistent with these, providing a check of the model, but are less precisely measured at present.

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_b = \sum \int L\phi(L) \frac{M_b}{L} \, dL.&lt;/math&gt;

The result was:

:&lt;math&gt; \Omega_b=\Omega_*+\Omega_\text{gas}=2.2\times10^{-3}+1.5\times10^{-3}h^{-1.3}\simeq0.003&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; h\simeq0.72 &lt;/math&gt;.

Note that this value is much lower than the prediction of standard cosmic nucleosynthesis &lt;math&gt; \Omega_b\simeq0.048 &lt;/math&gt;, so that stars and gas in galaxies and in galaxy groups and clusters account for less than 10% of the primordially synthesized baryons. This issue is known as the problem of the "missing baryons".

Extended models allow one or more of the "fixed" parameters above to vary, in addition to the basic six; so these models join smoothly to the basic six-parameter model in the limit that the additional parameter(s) approach the default values. For example, possible extensions of the simplest ΛCDM model allow for spatial curvature (&lt;math&gt;\Omega_{tot}&lt;/math&gt; may be different from 1); or [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]] rather than a [[cosmological constant]] where the [[Equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] of dark energy is allowed to differ from −1. Cosmic inflation predicts tensor fluctuations ([[gravitational wave]]s). Their amplitude is parameterized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio (denoted &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;), which is determined by the unknown energy scale of inflation. Other modifications allow [[hot dark matter]] in the form of [[neutrino]]s more massive than the minimal value, or a running spectral index; the latter is generally not favoured by simple cosmic inflation models.

Allowing additional variable parameter(s) will generally ''increase'' the uncertainties in the standard six parameters quoted above, and may also shift the central values slightly. The Table below shows results for each of the possible "6+1" scenarios with one additional variable parameter; this indicates that, as of 2015, there is no convincing evidence that any additional parameter is different from its default value.

Some researchers have suggested that there is a running spectral index, but no statistically significant study has revealed one. Theoretical expectations suggest that the tensor-to-scalar ratio &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; should be between 0 and 0.3, and the latest results are now within those limits.

Knowledge of the '''location of Earth''' has been shaped by 400 years of telescopic observations, and has expanded radically in the last century. Initially, Earth was believed to be the [[Geocentric model|center of the Universe]],  
which consisted only of those planets visible with the [[classical planet|naked eye]] and an outlying sphere of [[fixed stars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas S. |last=Kuhn |title=The Copernican Revolution |pages=5–20 |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |date=1957 |isbn=978-0-674-17103-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the acceptance of the [[heliocentric model]] in the 17th century, observations by [[William Herschel]] and others showed that the Sun lay within a vast, disc-shaped [[galaxy]] of stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1781: William Herschel Reveals the Shape of our Galaxy|url=http://cosmology.carnegiescience.edu/timeline/1781|publisher=[[Carnegie Institution for Science]]|accessdate=19 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326182039/http://cosmology.carnegiescience.edu/timeline/1781|archivedate=26 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 20th century, observations of [[spiral nebula]]e revealed that our galaxy was one of billions in an [[expanding universe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Spiral Nebulae and the Great Debate|publisher=[[Eberly College of Science]]|url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/astro801/content/l9_p2.html|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1929: Edwin Hubble Discovers the Universe is Expanding|publisher=Carnegie Institution for Science|url=https://cosmology.carnegiescience.edu/timeline/1929|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; grouped into clusters and [[supercluster]]s. By the end of the 20th century, the [[large-scale structure of the cosmos|overall structure]] of the visible universe was becoming clearer, with superclusters forming into a vast web of [[galactic filament|filaments]] and [[Void (astronomy)|voids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1989: Margaret Geller and John Huchra Map the Universe|publisher=[[Carnegie Institution for Science]]|url=https://cosmology.carnegiescience.edu/timeline/1989|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Superclusters, filaments and voids are the largest coherent structures in the Universe that we can observe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Structure of the Universe|author= Villanueva, John Carl |publisher=[[Universe Today]]|year=2009|url=http://www.universetoday.com/37360/structure-of-the-universe/|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At still larger scales (over 1000 [[megaparsec]]s{{efn|name=parsec|A parsec (pc) is the distance at which a star's [[parallax]] as viewed from Earth is equal to one [[second of arc]], equal to roughly 206,000&amp;nbsp;AU or 3.0857×10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;km.

Production at Margham commenced in 1984, with three major gas-bearing formations located up to 10,000 feet below sea level. The field is connected by pipeline to Jebel Ali, where the gas condensate is loaded onto tankers for export. Dry gas is now also sent by pipeline to supply the Dubai grid, with consumption increasing since 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.icis.com/resources/news/2018/01/10/10181701/uae-bets-on-alternative-energy-local-gas-production/|title=UAE bets on alternative energy, local gas production|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Margham was initially developed as a liquids stripping/gas recycling project (dry gas was pumped back into the reservoir),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.woodmac.com/reports/upstream-oil-and-gas-margham-field-gas-storage-project-1770930|title=Margham Field Gas Storage Project|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but now operates as a gas storage facility for Dubai since 2008, allowing Dubai to depend on gas produced from Margham for its elecricity generation and desalination needs. This usage, together with sustainables such as DEWA's [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park]], means that Dubai has eliminated the use of oil as a domestic energy fuel.

Although it is a major producer with ambitions to develop its trading activities to become a major global LNG hub, the UAE is actually a net importer of LNG.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenational.ae/business/dubai-supply-authority-agrees-deal-with-japan-s-jera-to-explore-lng-opportunities-1.19125|title=Dubai Supply Authority agrees deal with Japan’s Jera to explore LNG opportunities|work=The National|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''material''' is a [[chemical substance]] or [[mixture]] of substances that constitute an object. Materials can be pure or impure, a singular composite or a complex mix, living or non-living matter, whether natural or man-made, either concrete or abstract. Materials can be classified based on different properties such as [[physical property|physical]] and [[chemical property|chemical properties]] (see [[List of materials properties]]), [[geological]], [[biological]], choreographical, or [[property (philosophy)|philosophical properties]]. In the physical sense, materials are studied in the field of [[materials science]].

In [[industry]], materials are inputs to [[wiktionary:production|production]] or [[list of manufacturing processes|manufacturing processes]]. They may either be [[raw material]], that is, unprocessed, or processed before being used in more advanced production processes, either by [[distillation]] or [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] (synthetic materials).

Types of materials include:
*[[Biomaterial]], of biological origin
*[[Composite material]], composed of multiple materials with differing physical properties
*[[Textile]]s, sometimes referred to as "material"
*[[Genetic material]]

==Classification of materials==
Materials are classified according to many different criteria including their physical and chemical characteristics as well as their intended applications whether it is thermal, optical, electrical, magnetic, or combined. As their methods of usage dictate their physical appearance, they can be designed, tailored, and/or prepared in many forms such as powders, thin or thick films, and plates and could be introduced/studied in a single or multi layers. End products could be pure materials or doped ones with most useful compounds are those with controlled added impurities.The dopants could be added chemically or mixed and implanted physically. In case the impurities were added chemically, the dopants/co-dopants on substitutional/interstitial sites should be optimized and investigated thoroughly as well as any stresses instigated by their presence within the structure; whereas in the case of the physical mixing, the influence of the degree of heterogeneity of the prepared hybrid composites ought to be studied.The different physical and chemical preparation techniques can be used solely or combined including solid state synthesis, hydrothermal, sol-gel, precipitations and coprecipitations, spin coating, physical vapor deposition, and spray pyrolysis. Types of impurities along with their amounts are usually dictated by types of matrices to be added to, and their ability to maximize the desired products’ usefulness. Among the most commonly used characterization techniques are X-ray diffraction (XRD) either single crystal or powder, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), UV-Vis absorption Spectroscopy, Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR), and Photoluminescence spectrometry. In addition, it is usually considered of extreme importance to find theoretical models that can confirm and/or predict the experimental findings and assist in discussion, assignment, and the explanation of results and outcomes. Also, vision and room for future modification and development should always be pinpointed. Hence, one can classify the material as a smart one if its presence can serve multi purposes within the final product.

{{quantum mechanics}}
'''Matter waves''' are a central part of the theory of [[quantum mechanics]], being an example of [[wave–particle duality]]. All [[matter]] can exhibit [[wave]]-like behavior. For example, a beam of [[electron]]s can be [[diffraction|diffracted]] just like a beam of light or a water wave. The concept that matter behaves like a wave was proposed by [[Louis de Broglie]] ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˈ|b|r|ɔɪ}}) in 1924. It is also referred to as the ''de Broglie hypothesis''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Feynman|Feynman, R.]], ''[[QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter]]'', Penguin 1990 Edition, page 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Matter waves are referred to as ''de Broglie waves''.

The ''de Broglie wavelength'' is the [[wavelength]], {{math|''λ''}}, associated with a massive particle and is related to its [[momentum]], {{math|''p''}}, through the [[Planck constant]], {{math|''h''}}:
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \frac{h}{p}=\frac{h}{mv}.&lt;/math&gt;

Wave-like behavior of matter was first experimentally demonstrated by [[George Paget Thomson]]'s thin metal diffraction experiment,&lt;ref name=GPTdiff&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thomson, G. P. | title = Diffraction of Cathode Rays by a Thin Film | journal = Nature | volume = 119 | issue = 3007 | pages = 890 | year = 1927 | doi = 10.1038/119890a0 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v119/n3007/pdf/119890a0.pdf | format = PDF |bibcode = 1927Natur.119Q.890T }}&lt;/ref&gt; and independently in the [[Davisson–Germer experiment]] both using electrons, and it has also been confirmed for other [[elementary particle]]s, neutral [[atom]]s and even [[molecule]]s. Recently, it was also found that investigating the elementary process of diffusion gives the theoretical evidence of the relation of matter wave, regardless of the photon energy.&lt;ref&gt;Okino, T. (2018) Quantum Effect on Elementary Process of Diffusion and Collective Motion of Brown Particles, Journal Modern Physics 9, pp. 1007-1028.&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus revealed that the relation of matter wave is now not a hypothesis but an actual equation relevant to a characteristic of micro particle. The wave-like behavior of matter is crucial to the modern theory of atomic  structure and [[particle physics]].

==Historical context==
At the end of the 19th century, light was thought to consist of waves of electromagnetic fields which propagated according to [[Maxwell's equations]], while matter was thought to consist of localized particles (See [[wave–particle duality#Brief history of wave and particle viewpoints|history of wave and particle viewpoints]]). In 1900, this division was exposed to doubt, when, investigating the theory of black body thermal radiation, [[Max Planck]] proposed that light is emitted in discrete quanta of energy. It was thoroughly challenged in 1905. Extending Planck's investigation in several ways, including its connection with the [[photoelectric effect]], [[Albert Einstein]] proposed that light is also propagated and absorbed in quanta. Light quanta are now called [[photon]]s. These quanta would have an energy given by the [[Planck–Einstein relation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;E=h\nu&lt;/math&gt;
and a momentum
:&lt;math&gt;p=\frac{E}{c}=\frac{h}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''ν''}} (lowercase [[Nu (letter)|Greek letter nu]]) and {{math|''λ''}} (lowercase [[Lambda|Greek letter lambda]]) denote the frequency and wavelength of the light, {{math|''c''}} the speed of light, and {{math|''h''}} the [[Planck constant]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Einstein|Einstein, A.]] (1917).

[[File:Propagation of a de broglie wave.svg|290px|"290px"|right|thumb|Propagation of '''de Broglie waves''' in 1d – real part of the [[complex number|complex]] amplitude is blue, imaginary part is green. The probability (shown as the color [[opacity (optics)|opacity]]) of finding the particle at a given point ''x'' is spread out like a waveform; there is no definite position of the particle. As the amplitude increases above zero the [[curvature]] decreases, so the amplitude decreases again, and vice versa. The result is an alternating amplitude: a wave. Top: [[plane wave]]. Bottom: [[wave packet]].]]
De Broglie, in his 1924 PhD thesis, proposed that just as light has both wave-like and particle-like properties, [[electron]]s also have wave-like properties. By rearranging the momentum equation stated in the above section, we find a relationship between the [[wavelength]], {{math|''λ''}} associated with an electron and its [[momentum]], {{math|''p''}}, through the [[Planck constant]], {{math|''h''}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \frac{h}{p}.&lt;/math&gt;

The relationship is now known to hold for all types of matter: all matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves.

{{quote|When I conceived the first basic ideas of wave mechanics in 1923–24, I was guided by the aim to perform a real physical synthesis, valid for all particles, of the coexistence of the wave and of the corpuscular aspects that Einstein had introduced for photons in his theory of light quanta in 1905.|De Broglie&lt;ref&gt;Louis de Broglie [http://www.springerlink.com/content/n170347gr6h82147/ "The Reinterpretation of Wave Mechanics" Foundations of Physics, Vol. 1 No. 1 (1970)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1926, [[Erwin Schrödinger]] published an [[Schrödinger equation|equation]] describing how a matter wave should evolve—the matter wave analogue of [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell’s equations]]—and used it to derive the [[Emission spectrum|energy spectrum]] of [[hydrogen]].

==Experimental confirmation==
[[File:Wave-particle duality.gif|right|thumb|200px|Demonstration of a matter wave in diffraction of electrons]]

Matter waves were first experimentally confirmed to occur in [[George Paget Thomson]]'s cathode ray diffraction experiment&lt;ref name=GPTdiff/&gt; and the [[Davisson–Germer experiment|Davisson-Germer experiment]] for electrons, and the de Broglie hypothesis has been confirmed for other elementary particles. Furthermore, neutral atoms and even molecules have been shown to be wave-like.

===Electrons===
{{further|Davisson–Germer experiment|Electron diffraction}}
In 1927 at Bell Labs, [[Clinton Davisson]] and [[Lester Germer]] [[Davisson–Germer experiment|fired]] slow-moving [[electron]]s at a [[crystal]]line [[nickel]] target. The angular dependence of the diffracted electron intensity was measured, and was determined to have the same [[diffraction|diffraction pattern]] as those predicted by [[William Lawrence Bragg|Bragg]] for [[x-ray]]s. At the same time George Paget Thomson at the University of Aberdeen was independently firing electrons at very thin metal foils to demonstrate the same effect.&lt;ref name=GPTdiff/&gt; Before the acceptance of the de Broglie hypothesis, diffraction was a property that was thought to be exhibited only by waves. Therefore, the presence of any [[diffraction]] effects by matter demonstrated the wave-like nature of matter. When the de Broglie wavelength was inserted into the [[Bragg's law|Bragg condition]], the observed diffraction pattern was predicted, thereby experimentally confirming the de Broglie hypothesis for electrons.&lt;ref&gt;Mauro Dardo, ''Nobel Laureates and Twentieth-Century Physics'', Cambridge University Press 2004, pp. 156–157&lt;/ref&gt;

This was a pivotal result in the development of [[quantum mechanics]]. Just as the [[photoelectric effect]] demonstrated the particle nature of light, the [[Davisson–Germer experiment]] showed the wave-nature of matter, and completed the theory of [[wave–particle duality]]. For [[physicist]]s this idea was important because it meant that not only could any particle exhibit wave characteristics, but that one could use [[wave equation]]s to describe phenomena in matter if one used the de Broglie wavelength.

===Special relativity===
Using two formulas from [[special relativity]], one for the [[Momentum#Relativistic|relativistic momentum]] and one for the relativistic mass energy

:&lt;math&gt;E = m c^2 = \gamma m_0 c^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{p} = m\vec{v} = \gamma m_0 \vec{v} &lt;/math&gt;

allows the equations to be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}&amp;\lambda =\,\, \frac {h}{\gamma m_0v}\, =\, \frac {h}{m_0v}\,\,\,\, \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}\\
&amp; f = \frac{\gamma\,m_0c^2}{h} = \frac {m_0c^2}{h} \bigg/ \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt; denotes the particle's [[Invariant mass|rest mass]], &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; its [[velocity]], &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; the [[Lorentz factor]], and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Stationary states |first=Alan |last=Holden |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1971 |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-501497-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, W.S.C. (2002). ''Introducing Special Relativity'', Taylor &amp; Francis, London, {{ISBN|0-415-27761-2}}, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Broglie, L. (1970). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/n170347gr6h82147/ The reinterpretation of wave mechanics, ''Foundations of Physics'' '''1'''(1): 5–15, p. 9.]&lt;/ref&gt; See below for details of the derivation of the de Broglie relations. Group velocity (equal to the particle's speed) should not be confused with [[phase velocity]] (equal to the product of the particle's frequency and its wavelength). In the case of a non-[[dispersion relation|dispersive medium]], they happen to be equal, but otherwise they are not.

====Group velocity====
[[Albert Einstein]] first explained the [[wave–particle duality]] of light in 1905.  [[Louis de Broglie]] hypothesized that any particle should also exhibit such a duality. The velocity of a particle, he concluded, should always equal the group velocity of the corresponding wave. The magnitude of the group velocity is equal to the particle's speed.

Both in relativistic and non-relativistic quantum physics, we can identify the group velocity of a particle's wave function with the particle velocity.  [[Quantum mechanics]] has very accurately demonstrated this hypothesis, and the relation has been shown explicitly for particles as large as [[molecule]]s.&lt;ref name="Arndt 680–682"/&gt;

De Broglie deduced that if the duality equations already known for light were the same for any particle, then his hypothesis would hold.  This means that

:&lt;math&gt;v_g = \frac{\partial \omega}{\partial k} = \frac{\partial (E/\hbar)}{\partial (p/\hbar)} = \frac{\partial E}{\partial p}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''E''}} is the total [[energy]] of the particle, {{math|''p''}} is its [[momentum]], {{math|''ħ''}} is the reduced Planck constant. For a free non-relativistic particle it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  v_g &amp;= \frac{\partial E}{\partial p} = \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \left( \frac{1}{2}\frac{p^2}{m} \right)\\
    &amp;= \frac{p}{m}\\
    &amp;= v
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''m''}} is the [[mass]] of the particle and {{math|''v''}} its velocity.

Also in [[special relativity]] we find that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  v_g &amp;= \frac{\partial E}{\partial p} = \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \left( \sqrt{p^2c^2+m_0^2c^4} \right)\\
    &amp;= \frac{pc^2}{\sqrt{p^2c^2 + m_0^2c^4}}\\
    &amp;= \frac{pc^2}{E}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the rest mass of the particle and {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum. But (see below), using that the phase velocity is {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''E''/''p'' {{=}} ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''v''}}, therefore

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  v_g &amp;= \frac{pc^2}{E}\\
    &amp;= \frac{c^2}{v_p}\\
    &amp;= v
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''v''}} is the velocity of the particle regardless of wave behavior.

====Phase velocity====
In [[quantum mechanics]], particles also behave as waves with [[complex number|complex]] phases. The [[phase velocity]] is equal to the product of the frequency multiplied by the wavelength.

By the de Broglie hypothesis, we see that

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{p} = \frac{\omega}{k} = \frac{E/\hbar}{p/\hbar} = \frac{E}{p}. &lt;/math&gt;

Using [[special relativity|relativistic]] relations for energy and momentum, we have

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{p} = \frac{E}{p} = \frac{m c^2}{m v} = \frac{\gamma m_0 c^2}{\gamma m_0 v} = \frac{c^2}{v} = \frac{c}{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E'' is the total energy of the particle (i.e. [[Invariant mass#Rest energy|rest energy]] plus [[kinetic energy]] in the [[Kinematics|kinematic]] sense), ''p'' the [[momentum]], &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; the [[Lorentz factor]], ''c'' the [[speed of light]], and β the speed as a fraction of ''c''. The variable ''v'' can either be taken to be the speed of the particle or the group velocity of the corresponding matter wave. Since the particle speed &lt;math&gt;v &lt; c &lt;/math&gt; for any particle that has mass (according to [[special relativity]]), the phase velocity of matter waves always exceeds ''c'', i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{p} &gt; c, \,&lt;/math&gt;

and as we can see, it approaches ''c'' when the particle speed is in the relativistic range. The [[Faster-than-light|superluminal]] phase velocity does not violate special relativity, because phase propagation carries no energy. See the article on ''[[Dispersion (optics)#Group and phase velocity|Dispersion (optics)]]'' for details.

===Four-vectors===
{{Main|Four-vector}}

Using four-vectors, the De Broglie relations form a single equation:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}= \hbar\mathbf{K}&lt;/math&gt;

which is [[Inertial frame of reference|frame]]-independent.

Likewise, the relation between group/particle velocity and phase velocity is given in frame-independent form by:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K} = \left(\frac{\omega_o}{c^2}\right)\mathbf{U}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:[[Four-momentum]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} = \left(\frac{E}{c}, \vec{\mathbf{p}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:[[Four-vector#Four-wavevector|Four-wavevector]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K} = \left(\frac{\omega}{c}, \vec{\mathbf{k}} \right) = \left(\frac{\omega}{c}, \frac{\omega}{v_p}\mathbf{\hat{n}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:[[Four-velocity]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U} = \gamma(c,\vec{\mathbf{u}}) = \gamma(c,v_g \hat{\mathbf{n}}) &lt;/math&gt;

==Interpretations==
The physical reality underlying de Broglie waves is a subject of ongoing debate. Some theories treat either the particle or the wave aspect as its fundamental nature, seeking to explain the other as an [[Emergence|emergent property]]. Some, such as the [[hidden variable theory]], treat the wave and the particle as distinct entities. Yet others propose some intermediate entity that is neither quite wave nor quite particle but only appears as such when we measure one or the other property. The [[Copenhagen interpretation]] states that the nature of the underlying reality is unknowable and beyond the bounds of scientific inquiry.

Schrödinger's quantum mechanical waves are conceptually different from ordinary physical waves such as water or sound. Ordinary physical waves are characterized by undulating real-number 'displacements' of dimensioned physical variables at each point of ordinary physical space at each instant of time. Schrödinger's "waves" are characterized by the undulating value of a dimensionless complex number at each point of an abstract multi-dimensional space, for example of configuration space.

At the Fifth Solvay Conference in 1927, [[Max Born]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]] reported as follows:

{{quote|If one wishes to calculate the probabilities of excitation and ionization of atoms [M. Born, Zur Quantenmechanik der Stossvorgange, ''Z. f. Phys.'', '''37''' (1926), 863; [Quantenmechanik der Stossvorgange], ''ibid.'', '''38''' (1926), 803] then one must introduce the coordinates of the atomic electrons as variables on an equal footing with those of the colliding electron. The waves then propagate no longer in three-dimensional space but in multi-dimensional configuration space. From this one sees that the quantum mechanical waves are indeed something quite different from the light waves of the classical theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Born|Born, M.]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1928). Quantum mechanics, pp. 143–181 of ''Électrons et Photons: Rapports et Discussions du Cinquième Conseil de Physique, tenu à Bruxelles du 24 au 29 Octobre 1927, sous les Auspices de l'Institut International de Physique Solvay'', Gauthier-Villars, Paris, p. 166; this translation at p. 425 of Bacciagaluppi, G., Valentini, A. (2009), ''Quantum Theory at the Crossroads: Reconsidering the 1927 Solvay Conference'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, {{ISBN|978-0-521-81421-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the same conference, [[Erwin Schrödinger]] reported likewise.

{{quote|Under [the name 'wave mechanics',] at present two theories are being carried on, which are indeed closely related but not identical. The first, which follows on directly from the famous doctoral thesis by L. de Broglie, concerns waves in three-dimensional space. Because of the strictly relativistic treatment that is adopted in this version from the outset, we shall refer to it as the ''four-dimensional'' wave mechanics. The other theory is more remote from Mr de Broglie's original ideas, insofar as it is based on a wave-like process in the space of ''position coordinates'' (''q''-space) of an arbitrary mechanical system.[Long footnote about manuscript not copied here.] We shall therefore call it the ''multi-dimensional'' wave mechanics. Of course this use of the ''q''-space is to be seen only as a mathematical tool, as it is often applied also in the old mechanics; ultimately, in this version also, the process to be described is one in space and time. In truth, however, a complete unification of the two conceptions has not yet been achieved. Anything over and above the motion of a single electron could be treated so far only in the ''multi''-dimensional version; also, this is the  one that provides the mathematical solution to the problems posed by the Heisenberg-Born matrix mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger, E.]] (1928). Wave mechanics, pp. 185–206 of ''Électrons et Photons: Rapports et Discussions du Cinquième Conseil de Physique, tenu à Bruxelles du 24 au 29 Octobre 1927, sous les Auspices de l'Institut International de Physique Solvay'', Gauthier-Villars, Paris, pp. 185–186; this translation at p. 447 of Bacciagaluppi, G., Valentini, A. (2009), ''Quantum Theory at the Crossroads: Reconsidering the 1927 Solvay Conference'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, {{ISBN|978-0-521-81421-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1955, Heisenberg reiterated this:

{{quote|An important step forward was made by the work of Born [''Z. Phys.'', '''37''': 863, 1926 and '''38''': 803, 1926] in the summer of 1926. In this work, the wave in configuration space was interpreted as a probability wave, in order to explain collision processes on Schrödinger's theory. This hypothesis contained two important new features in comparison with that of [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]], [[Hans Kramers|Kramers]] and [[John C. Slater|Slater]]. The first of these was the assertion that, in considering "probability waves", we are concerned with processes not in ordinary three-dimensional space, but in an abstract configuration space (a fact which is, unfortunately, sometimes overlooked even today); the second was the recognition that the probability wave is related to an individual process.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1955). The development of the interpretation of the quantum theory, pp. 12–29, in ''[[Niels Bohr]] and the Development of Physics: Essays dedicated to Niels Bohr on the occasion of his seventieth birthday'', edited by [[Wolfgang Pauli|W. Pauli]], with the assistance of [[Léon Rosenfeld|L. Rosenfeld]] and [[Victor Weisskopf|V. Weisskopf]], Pergamon Press, London, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is mentioned above that the "displaced quantity" of the Schrödinger wave has values that are dimensionless complex numbers. One may ask what is the physical meaning of those numbers. According to Heisenberg, rather than being of some ordinary physical quantity such as, for example, Maxwell's electric field intensity, or mass density, the Schrödinger-wave packet's "displaced quantity" is probability amplitude. He wrote that instead of using the term 'wave packet', it is preferable to speak of a probability packet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1927).

Also translated as 'The actual content of quantum theoretical kinematics and mechanics' [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19840008978.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; The probability amplitude supports calculation of probability of location or momentum of discrete particles. Heisenberg recites Duane's account of particle diffraction by probabilistic quantal translation momentum transfer, which allows, for example in Young's two-slit experiment, each diffracted particle probabilistically to pass discretely through a particular slit.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1930). ''The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory'', translated by C. Eckart, F. C. Hoyt, University of Chicago Press, Chicago IL, pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus one does not need necessarily think of the matter wave, as it were, as 'composed of smeared matter'.

These ideas may be expressed in ordinary language as follows. In the account of ordinary physical waves, a 'point' refers to a position in ordinary physical space at an instant of time, at which there is specified a 'displacement' of some physical quantity. But in the account of quantum mechanics, a 'point' refers to a configuration of the system at an instant of time, every particle of the system being in a sense present in every 'point' of configuration space, each particle at such a 'point' being located possibly at a different position in ordinary physical space. There is no explicit definite indication that, at an instant, this particle is 'here' and that particle is 'there' in some separate 'location' in configuration space. This conceptual difference entails that, in contrast to de Broglie's pre-quantum mechanical wave description, the quantum mechanical probability packet description does not directly and explicitly express the Aristotelian idea, referred to by Newton, that causal efficacy propagates through ordinary space by contact, nor the Einsteinian idea that such propagation is no faster than light. In contrast, these ideas are so expressed in the classical wave account, through the [[Green's function]], though it is inadequate for the observed quantal phenomena. The physical reasoning for this was first recognized by Einstein.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, A. (1986).

==De Broglie's phase wave and periodic phenomenon==
De Broglie's thesis started from the hypothesis, "that to each portion of energy with a proper mass {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} one may associate a periodic phenomenon of the frequency {{math|''ν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} , such that one finds: {{math|''hν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The frequency {{math|''ν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is to be measured, of course, in the rest frame of the energy packet. This hypothesis is the basis of our theory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = de Broglie | first1 = L. | authorlink = Louis de Broglie | year = 1923 | title = Waves and quanta | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 112 | issue = 2815| page = 540 | doi=10.1038/112540a0| bibcode = 1923Natur.112..540D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis de Broglie|de Broglie, L.]] (1924).

De Broglie followed his initial hypothesis of a periodic phenomenon, with frequency {{math|''ν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, associated with the energy packet. He used the special theory of relativity to find, in the frame of the observer of the electron energy packet that is moving with velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, that its frequency was apparently reduced to

:&lt;math&gt;f = \nu_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
 
Then
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda f = E/p=v_\mathrm p\,.&lt;/math&gt;

using the same notation as above. The quantity &lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm p&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of what de Broglie called the "phase y wave". Its wavelength is &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and frequency &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. De Broglie reasoned that his hypothetical intrinsic particle periodic phenomenon is in phase with that phase wave. This was his basic matter wave conception. He noted, as above, that &lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm p &gt; c&lt;/math&gt;, and the phase wave does not transfer energy.&lt;ref name="Medicus"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bacciagaluppi, G., Valentini, A. (2009).

While the concept of waves being associated with matter is correct, de Broglie did not leap directly to the final understanding of quantum mechanics with no missteps. There are conceptual problems with the approach that de Broglie took in his thesis that he was not able to resolve, despite trying a number of different fundamental hypotheses in different papers published while working on, and shortly after publishing, his thesis.&lt;ref name="MacKinnon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Martins"&gt;{{cite web

These difficulties were resolved by [[Erwin Schrödinger]], who developed the wave mechanics approach, starting from a somewhat different basic hypothesis.

The '''maximum power principle''' or '''Lotka's principle'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tilley |first1=David Rogers |title=Howard T. Odum’s contribution to the laws of energy |journal=Ecological Modelling |date=2004 |volume=178 |pages=121–125 |doi=10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2003.12.032 |url=http://www.unicamp.br/fea/ortega/extensao/davidtilley-2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been proposed as the fourth [[Principles of energetics|principle of energetics]] in [[Open system (systems theory)|open system]] [[thermodynamics]], where an example of an open system is a biological cell. According to [[Howard T. Odum]], "The maximum power principle can be stated: During self-organization, system designs develop and prevail that maximize power intake, energy transformation, and those uses that reinforce production and efficiency."&lt;ref&gt;H.T. Odum 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;311&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Chen (2006) has located the origin of the statement of maximum power as a formal principle in a tentative proposal by [[Alfred J. Lotka]] (1922a, b). Lotka's statement sought to explain the Darwinian notion of evolution with reference to a physical principle. Lotka's work was subsequently developed by the [[systems ecology|systems ecologist]] [[Howard T. Odum]] in collaboration with the Chemical Engineer Richard C. Pinkerton, and later advanced by the Engineer [[Myron Tribus]].

While Lotka's work may have been a first attempt to formalise evolutionary thought in mathematical terms, it followed similar observations made by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Vito Volterra|Volterra]] and Ludwig [[Boltzmann]], for example, throughout the sometimes controversial history of natural philosophy.  In contemporary literature it is most commonly associated with the work of Howard T. Odum.

The significance of Odum's approach was given greater support during the 1970s, amid times of [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]], where, as Gilliland (1978, pp.&amp;nbsp;100) observed, there was an emerging need for a new method of analysing the importance and value of energy resources to economic and environmental production. A field known as [[energy analysis]], itself associated with [[net energy]] and [[EROEI]], arose to fulfill this analytic need. However, in energy analysis intractable theoretical and practical difficulties arose when using the [[energy unit]] to understand, a) the conversion among concentrated fuel types (or [[energy types]]), b)  the contribution of labour, and c) the contribution of the environment.

==Philosophy and theory==
Lotka said (1922b: 151): 
{{cquote|The principle of natural selection reveals itself as capable of yielding information which the first and second laws of thermodynamics are not competent to furnish. The two fundamental laws of thermodynamics are, of course, insufficient to determine the course of events in a physical system. They tell us that certain things cannot happen, but they do not tell us what does happen.}}

Gilliland noted that these difficulties in analysis in turn required some new theory to adequately explain the interactions and transactions of these different energies (different concentrations of fuels, labour and environmental forces). Gilliland (Gilliland 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;101) suggested that Odum's statement of the maximum power principle (H.T.Odum 1978, pp.&amp;nbsp;54–87) was, perhaps, an adequate expression of the requisite theory:
{{cquote|That theory, as it is expressed by the maximum power principle, addresses the empirical question of why systems of any type or size organize themselves into the patterns observed. Such a question assumes that physical laws govern system function. It does not assume, for example, that the system comprising economic production is driven by consumers; rather that the whole cycle of production-consumption is structured and driven by physical laws.}}

This theory Odum called maximum power theory. In order to formulate maximum power theory Gilliland observed that Odum had added another law (the maximum power principle) to the already well established laws of thermodynamics. In 1978 Gilliland wrote that Odum's new law had not yet been validated (Gilliland 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;101). Gilliland stated that in maximum power theory the [[second law efficiency]] of thermodynamics required an additional physical concept: "the concept of second law efficiency under maximum power" (Gilliland 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;101):

{{cquote|Neither the first or second law of thermodynamics include a measure of the rate at which energy transformations or processes occur. The concept of maximum power incorporates time into measures of energy transformations. It provides information about the rate at which one kind of energy is transformed into another as well as the efficiency of that transformation.}} 
     
In this way the concept of maximum power was being used as a principle to quantitatively describe the selective law of biological [[evolution]]. Perhaps H.T.Odum's most concise statement of this view was (1970, p.&amp;nbsp;62):

{{cquote|Lotka provided the theory of natural selection as a maximum power organizer; under competitive conditions systems are selected which use their energies in various structural-developing actions so as to maximize their use of available energies. By this theory systems of cycles which drain less energy lose out in comparative development. However Leopold and Langbein have shown that streams in developing erosion profiles, meander systems, and tributary networks disperse their potential energies more slowly than if their channels were more direct. These two statements might be harmonized by an optimum efficiency maximum power principle (Odum and Pinkerton 1955), which indicates that energies which are converted too rapidly into heat are not made available to the systems own use because they are not fed back through storages into useful pumping, but instead do random stirring of the environment.}}

The Odum–Pinkerton approach to Lotka's proposal was to apply [[Ohm's law]] – and the associated [[maximum power theorem]] (a result in [[electric power|electrical power]] systems) – to ecological systems. Odum and Pinkerton defined "power" in electronic terms as the rate of [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]], where Work is understood as a "[[Thermodynamic free energy|useful energy]] transformation". &lt;!-- (In electrical engineering and physics, "[[Power (physics)|power]]" is defined as the rate of doing work or consuming energy, without any distinction between "useful energy" and any other energy.) --&gt;The concept of maximum power can therefore be defined as the '''''maximum''' rate of '''useful''' energy transformation''. Hence the underlying philosophy aims to unify the theories and associated laws of electronic and thermodynamic systems with biological systems. This approach presupposed an [[Analogical models|analogical view]] which sees the world as an ecological-electronic-economic engine.

==Proposals for maximum power principle as 4th thermodynamic law==
{{quotation|It has been pointed out by [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]] that the fundamental object of contention in the life-struggle, in the evolution of the organic world, is available energy. In accord with this observation is the principle that, in the struggle for existence, the advantage must go to those organisms whose energy-capturing devices are most efficient in directing available energy into channels favorable to the preservation of the species.|A.J. Lotka 1922a, p. 147}}

{{quotation|...it seems to this author appropriate to unite the biological and physical traditions by giving the Darwinian principle of natural selection the citation as the ''fourth law of thermodynamics'', since it is the controlling principle in rate of heat generation and efficiency settings in irreversible biological processes.|H.T. Odum 1963, p. 437}}

{{quotation|...it may be time to recognize the maximum power principle as the fourth thermodynamic law as suggested by Lotka.|H.T. Odum 1994}}

==Definition in words==
{{cquote|The maximum power principle can be stated: During self-organization, system designs develop and prevail that maximize power intake, energy transformation, and those uses that reinforce production and efficiency. (H.T. Odum 1995, p. 311)}}

{{cquote|...the maximum power principle ... states that systems which maximize their flow of energy survive in competition. In other words, rather than merely accepting the fact that more energy per unit of time is transformed in a process which operates at maximum power, this principle says that systems organize and structure themselves naturally to maximize power. Systems regulate themselves according to the maximum power principle. Over time, the systems which maximize power are selected for whereas those that do not are selected against and eventually eliminated. ... Odum argues ... that the free market mechanisms of the economy effectively do the same thing for human systems and that our economic evolution to date is a product of that selection process. (Gilliland 1978, pp. 101–102)}}

Odum et al. viewed the [[maximum power theorem]] as a principle of '''power-efficiency reciprocity selection''' with wider application than just electronics. For example, Odum saw it in open systems operating on solar energy, like both photovoltaics and photosynthesis (1963, p.&amp;nbsp;438). Like the maximum power theorem, Odum's statement of the maximum power principle relies on the notion of 'matching', such that high-quality energy maximizes power by matching and amplifying energy (1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;262, 541): "in surviving designs a matching of high-quality energy with larger amounts of low-quality energy is likely to occur" (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;260). As with electronic circuits, the resultant rate of energy transformation will be at a maximum at an intermediate power efficiency. In 2006, T.T. Cai, C.L. Montague and J.S. Davis said that, "The maximum power principle is a potential guide to understanding the patterns and processes of ecosystem development and sustainability. The principle predicts the selective persistence of ecosystem designs that capture a previously untapped energy source." (2006, p.&amp;nbsp;317). In several texts H.T. Odum gave the [[Atwood machine]] as a practical example of the 'principle' of maximum power.

=== Mathematical definition ===
The mathematical definition given by H.T. Odum is formally analogous to the definition provided on the [[maximum power theorem]] article. (For a brief explanation of Odum's approach to the relationship between ecology and electronics see [[Howard T. Odum#Ecological analog of Ohm.27s Law|Ecological Analog of Ohm's Law]])

==Contemporary ideas==
Whether or not the principle of maximum power efficiency can be considered the fourth law of thermodynamics and the fourth principle of energetics is moot. Nevertheless, H.T. Odum also proposed a corollary of maximum power as the organisational principle of evolution, describing the evolution of [[microbiological]] systems, [[economic systems]], [[planet]]ary systems, and [[astrophysical]] systems. He called this corollary the '''[[Maximum empower#Empower and maximum empower|maximum empower]]''' principle.  This was suggested because, as S.E. Jorgensen, M.T. Brown, H.T. Odum (2004) note,

{{quotation|Maximum power might be misunderstood to mean giving priority to low level processes. ... However, the higher level transformation processes are just as important as the low level processes. ... Therefore, Lotka's principle is clarified by stating it as the principle of self organization for maximum ''empower''. |p. 18}}

C. Giannantoni may have confused matters when he wrote "The "Maximum Em-Power Principle" (Lotka–Odum) is generally considered the "Fourth Thermodynamic Principle" (mainly) because of its practical validity for a very wide class of physical and biological systems" (C. Giannantoni 2002, § 13, p.&amp;nbsp;155). Nevertheless,  Giannantoni has proposed the Maximum Em-Power Principle as the fourth principle of thermodynamics (Giannantoni 2006).

The preceding discussion is incomplete. The "maximum power" was discovered several times independently, in physics and engineering, see: Novikov (1957), El-Wakil (1962), and Curzon and Ahlborn (1975). The incorrectness of this analysis and design evolution conclusions was demonstrated by Gyftopoulos (2002).

'''Moisture expansion''' is the tendency of matter to change in volume in response to a change in moisture content. The macroscopic effect is similar to that of [[thermal expansion]] but the microscopic causes are very different. Moisture expansion is caused by [[hygroscopy]].

A '''molecule''' is an [[electrically]] neutral group of two or more [[atom]]s held together by [[chemical bond]]s.&lt;ref name="iupac"&gt;{{GoldBookRef| title=Molecule|file=M04002|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Ebbin, Darrell D.| title= General Chemistry |edition=3rd| date= 1990| publisher= [[Houghton Mifflin Co.]]| location= Boston| isbn= 0-395-43302-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Brown, T.L. |author2=Kenneth C.

However, in [[quantum physics]], [[organic chemistry]], and [[biochemistry]], the term ''molecule'' is often used less strictly, also being applied to [[polyatomic ion]]s.

In the [[kinetic theory of gases]], the term ''molecule'' is often used for any gaseous [[particle]] regardless of its composition. According to this definition, [[noble gas]] atoms are considered molecules as they are monatomic molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Chandra| first= Sulekh| title= Comprehensive Inorganic Chemistry| date= 2005| publisher= New Age Publishers| isbn= 81-224-1512-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A molecule may be [[homonuclear]], that is, it consists of atoms of one [[chemical element]], as with [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;); or it may be [[heteronuclear]], a [[chemical compound]] composed of more than one element, as with [[water (molecule)|water]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). Atoms and complexes connected by [[non-covalent interactions]], such as [[hydrogen bond]]s or [[ionic bond]]s, are generally not considered single molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title= Molecule|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|date =22 January 2016|url=http://global.britannica.com/science/molecule|access-date=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molecules as components of matter are common in organic substances (and therefore biochemistry). They also make up most of the oceans and atmosphere. However, the majority of familiar solid substances on Earth, including most of the minerals that make up the [[Crust (geology)|crust]], [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], and [[Earth core|core of the Earth]], contain many chemical bonds, but are ''not'' made of identifiable molecules. Also, no typical molecule can be defined for [[ionic crystal]]s ([[salt (chemistry)|salts]]) and covalent crystals ([[network solid]]s), although these are often composed of repeating [[unit cell]]s that extend either in a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] (such as in [[graphene]]) or three-dimensionally (such as in [[diamond]], [[quartz]], or [[sodium chloride]]). The theme of repeated unit-cellular-structure also holds for most condensed phases with [[metallic bond]]ing, which means that solid metals are also not made of molecules. In [[glass]]es (solids that exist in a vitreous disordered state), atoms may also be held together by chemical bonds with no presence of any definable molecule, nor any of the regularity of repeating units that characterizes crystals.

== Molecular science ==

The science of molecules is called ''molecular chemistry'' or ''[[molecular physics]]'', depending on whether the focus is on chemistry or physics. Molecular chemistry deals with the laws governing the interaction between molecules that results in the formation and breakage of [[chemical bond]]s, while molecular physics deals with the laws governing their structure and properties. In practice, however, this distinction is vague. In molecular sciences, a molecule consists of a stable system ([[bound state]]) composed of two or more [[atom]]s. [[Polyatomic ion]]s may sometimes be usefully thought of as electrically charged molecules. The term ''unstable molecule'' is used for very [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]] species, i.e., short-lived assemblies ([[Resonance (chemistry)|resonances]]) of electrons and [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], such as [[radical (chemistry)|radicals]], molecular [[ion]]s, [[Rydberg molecule]]s, [[transition state]]s, [[van der Waals bonding|van der Waals complexes]], or systems of colliding atoms as in [[Bose–Einstein condensate]].

== History and etymology ==
{{Main|History of molecular theory}}

According to [[Merriam-Webster]] and the [[Online Etymology Dictionary]], the word "molecule" derives from the [[Latin]] "[[Mole (unit)|moles]]" or small unit of mass.
* '''Molecule''' (1794)&amp;nbsp;– "extremely minute particle", from French ''{{linktext|molécule}}'' (1678), from [[New Latin]] ''{{linktext|molecula}}'', diminutive of Latin ''{{linktext|moles}}'' "mass, barrier". A vague meaning at first; the vogue for the word (used until the late 18th century only in Latin form) can be traced to the philosophy of [[René Descartes|Descartes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|molecule|accessdate=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=molecule|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/molecule|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of the molecule has evolved as knowledge of the structure of molecules has increased. Earlier definitions were less precise, defining molecules as the smallest [[list of particles#Molecules|particles]] of pure [[chemical substance]]s that still retain their [[chemical compound|composition]] and chemical properties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/glossary/m.shtml#molecule Molecule Definition] ([[Frostburg State University]])&lt;/ref&gt; This definition often breaks down since many substances in ordinary experience, such as [[rock (geology)|rocks]], [[salt (chemistry)|salts]], and [[metal]]s, are composed of large crystalline networks of [[chemical bond|chemically bonded]] atoms or [[ion]]s, but are not made of discrete molecules.
{{clear}}

== Bonding ==

Molecules are held together by either [[covalent bonding]] or [[ionic bonding]]. Several types of non-metal elements exist only as molecules in the environment. For example, hydrogen only exists as hydrogen molecule. A molecule of a compound is made out of two or more elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hutchinson unabridged encyclopedia with atlas and weather guide|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/hutchinson-unabridged-encyclopedia-with-atlas-and-weather-guide/oclc/696918830|website=worldcat.org|publisher=Oxford, England|accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Covalent ===
{{main|Covalent bonding}}
[[File:Covalent bond hydrogen.svg|thumb|right|A covalent bond forming H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (right) where two [[hydrogen atom]]s share the two electrons]]
A covalent bond is a [[chemical bond]] that involves the sharing of [[electron pair]]s between [[atom]]s. These electron pairs are termed ''shared pairs'' or ''bonding pairs'', and the stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms, when they share electrons, is termed ''covalent bonding''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author2= Brad Williamson; Robin J. Heyden| last= Campbell| first= Neil A.| title= Biology: Exploring Life| url= http://www.phschool.com/el_marketing.html| accessdate= 2012-02-05| year= 2006| publisher= [[Pearson Prentice Hall]]| location= Boston, Massachusetts| isbn= 0-13-250882-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

=== Ionic ===
{{main|Ionic bonding}} [[File:NaF.gif|thumb|left|[[Sodium]] and [[fluorine]] undergoing a redox reaction to form [[sodium fluoride]]. Sodium loses its outer [[electron]]  to give it a stable [[electron configuration]], and this electron enters the fluorine atom [[exothermic]]ally.]]

Ionic bonding is a type of [[chemical bond]] that involves the [[electrostatic]] attraction between oppositely charged [[ion]]s, and is the primary interaction occurring in [[ionic compound]]s. The ions are atoms that have lost one or more [[electron]]s (termed [[cation]]s) and atoms that have gained one or more electrons (termed [[anion]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6VdROgeQ5M8C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=ionic+bonding+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi34bOG_6nTAhVnl1QKHRLZBeoQ6AEILTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=ionic%20bonding%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false|title=Elements of Metallurgy and Engineering Alloys|last=Campbell|first=Flake C.|date=2008-01-01|publisher=[[ASM International]]|isbn=9781615030583|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This transfer of electrons is termed ''electrovalence'' in contrast to [[covalent bond|covalence]]. In the simplest case, the cation is a [[metal]] atom and the anion is a [[nonmetal]] atom, but these ions can be of a more complicated nature, e.g. molecular ions like NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;. Basically, an ionic bond is the transfer of electrons from a metal to a non-metal for both atoms to obtain a full valence shell.

== Molecular size ==

Most molecules are far too small to be seen with the naked eye, but there are exceptions. [[DNA]], a [[macromolecule]], can reach [[macroscopic]] sizes, as can molecules of many [[polymer]]s. Molecules commonly used as building blocks for organic synthesis have a dimension of a few [[angstrom]]s (Å) to several dozen Å, or around one billionth of a meter. Single molecules cannot usually be observed by [[light]] (as noted above), but small molecules and even the outlines of individual atoms may be traced in some circumstances by use of an [[atomic force microscope]]. Some of the largest molecules are [[macromolecule]]s or [[supermolecule]]s.

The smallest molecule is the [[diatomic]] [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), with a bond length of 0.74 Å.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Roger L. DeKock |author2=Harry B. Gray|author3=Harry B.

== Molecular formulas ==

=== Chemical formula types ===
{{Main|Chemical formula}}

The [[chemical formula]] for a molecule uses one line of [[chemical element]] symbols, numbers, and sometimes also other symbols, such as parentheses, dashes, brackets, and ''plus'' (+) and ''minus'' (−) signs. These are limited to one typographic line of symbols, which may include subscripts and superscripts.

A compound's [[empirical formula]] is a very simple type of chemical formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6wUmteTIc18C&amp;pg=PA288&amp;dq=empirical+formula&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiv64bBh6rTAhUSwmMKHb3vB0IQ6AEIOjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=empirical%20formula&amp;f=false|title=The Practice of Chemistry|last=Wink|first=Donald J.|last2=Fetzer-Gislason|first2=Sharon|last3=McNicholas|first3=Sheila|date=2003-03-01|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780716748717|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the simplest [[integer]] [[ratio]] of the [[chemical element]]s that constitute it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chemteam.info/Mole/EmpiricalFormula.html|title=ChemTeam: Empirical Formula|website=www.chemteam.info|access-date=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, water is always composed of a 2:1 ratio of [[hydrogen]] to [[oxygen]] atoms, and ethyl [[alcohol]] or [[ethanol]] is always composed of [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], and [[oxygen]] in a 2:6:1 ratio. However, this does not determine the kind of molecule uniquely&amp;nbsp;– [[dimethyl ether]] has the same ratios as ethanol, for instance. Molecules with the same [[atom]]s in different arrangements are called [[isomer]]s. Also carbohydrates, for example, have the same ratio (carbon:hydrogen:oxygen= 1:2:1) (and thus the same empirical formula) but different total numbers of atoms in the molecule.

The [[molecular formula]] reflects the exact number of atoms that compose the molecule and so characterizes different molecules. However different isomers can have the same atomic composition while being different molecules.

The empirical formula is often the same as the molecular formula but not always. For example, the molecule [[acetylene]] has molecular formula C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but the simplest integer ratio of elements is CH.

The [[molecular mass]] can be calculated from the [[chemical formula]] and is expressed in conventional [[atomic mass unit]]s equal to 1/12 of the mass of a neutral carbon-12 (&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;[[carbon|C]] [[isotope]]) atom. For [[network solid]]s, the term [[formula unit]] is used in [[stoichiometric]] calculations.

[[File:Atisane3.png|thumb|right|upright=1.8|[[Three-dimensional space|3D]] (left and center) and [[2D geometric model|2D]] (right) representations of the [[terpenoid]] molecule atisane]]

For molecules with a complicated 3-dimensional structure, especially involving atoms bonded to four different substituents, a simple molecular formula or even semi-structural [[chemical formula]] may not be enough to completely specify the molecule. In this case, a graphical type of formula called a [[structural formula]] may be needed. Structural formulas may in turn be represented with a one-dimensional chemical name, but such [[chemical nomenclature]] requires many words and terms which are not part of chemical formulas.

== Molecular geometry ==
{{Main|Molecular geometry}}

[[File:Cyanostar STM.png|thumb|left|upright|Structure and [[Scanning tunneling microscopy|STM]] image of a "cyanostar" [[dendrimer]] molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/C4CC03725A|pmid=25080328|title=Anion-induced dimerization of 5-fold symmetric cyanostars in 3D crystalline solids and 2D self-assembled crystals|journal=Chemical Communications|volume=50|issue=69|pages=9827–30|year=2014|last1=Hirsch|first1=Brandon E.|last2=Lee|first2=Semin|last3=Qiao|first3=Bo|last4=Chen|first4=Chun-Hsing|last5=McDonald|first5=Kevin P.|last6=Tait|first6=Steven L.|last7=Flood|first7=Amar H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Molecules have fixed [[mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] geometries—bond lengths and angles— about which they continuously oscillate through vibrational and rotational motions. A pure substance is composed of molecules with the same average geometrical structure. The chemical formula and the structure of a molecule are the two important factors that determine its properties, particularly its [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]]. [[Isomers]] share a chemical formula but normally have very different properties because of their different structures. [[Stereoisomer]]s, a particular type of isomer, may have very similar physico-chemical properties and at the same time different [[biochemistry|biochemical]] activities.

== Molecular spectroscopy ==
{{Main|Spectroscopy}}

[[File:Dehydrogenation of H2TPP by STM.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Hydrogen can be removed from individual [[Tetraphenylporphyrin|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TPP]] molecules by applying excess voltage to the tip of a [[scanning tunneling microscope]] (STM, a); this removal alters the current-voltage (I-V) curves of TPP molecules, measured using the same STM tip, from [[diode]] like (red curve in b) to [[resistor]] like (green curve). Image (c) shows a row of TPP, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TPP and TPP molecules. While scanning image (d), excess voltage was applied to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TPP at the black dot, which instantly removed hydrogen, as shown in the bottom part of (d) and in the rescan image (e). Such manipulations can be used in [[single-molecule electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/srep08350|pmid=25666850|pmc=4322354|title=N and p type character of single molecule diodes|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=5|page=8350|year=2015|bibcode= 2015NatSR...5E8350Z|author1=Zoldan|first1=V. C.|last2=Faccio|first2=R|last3=Pasa|first3=A. A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Molecular spectroscopy''' deals with the response ([[frequency spectrum|spectrum]]) of molecules interacting with probing signals of known [[energy]] (or [[frequency]], according to [[Planck's constant|Planck's formula]]). Molecules have quantized energy levels that can be analyzed by detecting the molecule's energy exchange through [[absorbance]] or [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]].&lt;ref name="iupac2"&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Spectroscopy|file=S05848|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Spectroscopy does not generally refer to [[diffraction]] studies where particles such as [[neutron]]s, [[electron]]s, or high energy [[X-ray]]s interact with a regular arrangement of molecules (as in a crystal).

[[Microwave spectroscopy]] commonly measures changes in the rotation of molecules, and can be used to identify molecules in outer space. [[Infrared spectroscopy]] measures changes in vibration of molecules, including stretching, bending or twisting motions. It is commonly used to identify the kinds of bonds or [[functional group]]s in molecules. Changes in the arrangements of electrons yield absorption or emission lines in ultraviolet, visible or [[near infrared]] light, and result in colour. Nuclear resonance spectroscopy actually measures the environment of particular nuclei in the molecule, and can be used to characterise the numbers of atoms in different positions in a molecule.

== Theoretical aspects ==

The study of molecules by [[molecular physics]] and [[theoretical chemistry]] is largely based on [[quantum mechanic]]s and is essential for the understanding of the [[chemical bond]]. The simplest of molecules is the [[hydrogen molecule-ion]], H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and the simplest of all the chemical bonds is the [[one-electron bond]]. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is composed of two positively charged [[proton]]s and one negatively charged [[electron]], which means that the [[Schrödinger equation]] for the system can be solved more easily due to the lack of electron–electron repulsion. With the development of fast digital computers, approximate solutions for more complicated molecules became possible and are one of the main aspects of [[computational chemistry]].

When trying to define rigorously whether an arrangement of atoms is ''sufficiently stable'' to be considered a molecule, IUPAC suggests that it "must correspond to a depression on the [[potential energy surface]] that is deep enough to confine at least one vibrational state".&lt;ref name="iupac" /&gt; This definition does not depend on the nature of the interaction between the atoms, but only on the strength of the interaction. In fact, it includes weakly bound species that would not traditionally be considered molecules, such as the [[helium]] [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]], [[helium dimer|He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], which has one vibrational [[bound state]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anderson JB |title=Comment on "An exact quantum Monte Carlo calculation of the helium-helium intermolecular potential" [J. Chem. Phys. 115, 4546 (2001)] |journal=J Chem Phys |volume=120 |issue=20 |pages=9886–7 |date=May 2004 |pmid=15268005 |doi=10.1063/1.1704638 |bibcode= 2004JChPh.120.9886A}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is so loosely bound that it is only likely to be observed at very low temperatures.

Whether or not an arrangement of atoms is ''sufficiently stable'' to be considered a molecule is inherently an operational definition. Philosophically, therefore, a molecule is not a fundamental entity (in contrast, for instance, to an [[elementary particle]]); rather, the concept of a molecule is the chemist's way of making a useful statement about the strengths of atomic-scale interactions in the world that we observe.

A '''natural landscape''' is the original landscape that exists before it is acted upon by human culture.&lt;ref group = note&gt;"The area prior to the introduction of man 's activity is represented by one body of morphologic facts. The forms that man has introduced are another set. We may call the former, with reference to man, the original, natural landscape. In its entirety it no longer exists in many parts of the world, but its reconstruction and understanding are the first part of formal morphonology." Carl O. Sauer, "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography'', vol. 2, No. 2, 12 October 1925, p. 37.[https://archive.org/stream/universityofc02univ/universityofc02univ_djvu.txt]&lt;/ref&gt; The natural landscape and the [[cultural landscape]] are separate parts of the [[landscape]].&lt;ref group = note&gt;"The cultural landscape is fashioned from a natural landscape by a culture group. Culture is the agent, the natural area is the medium, the cultural landscape the result." Carl O. Sauer, "The Morphology of Landscape", p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the twenty-first century landscapes that are totally untouched by human activity no longer exist, so that reference is sometimes now made to degrees of naturalness within a landscape.&lt;ref group = note&gt;The [[European Environment Agency]]'s planned forest naturalness index is an example of an attempt to define one type of natural landscape in Europe. The Agency lists forests in three categories: (1) [[Plantations]]; (2) Semi-natural; and (3) Naturally dynamic. The latter are "forests whose structure, composition and function have been shaped by natural dynamics without substantial [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] influence over a long period of time".&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (1962) [[Rachel Carson]] describes a roadside verge as it used to look: "Along the roads, laurel, viburnum and alder, great ferns and wildflowers delighted the traveler’s eye through much of the year" and then how it looks now following the use of [[herbicide]]s: "The roadsides, once so attractive, were now lined with browned and withered vegetation as though swept by fire".&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge, Mass.: Riverside Press, 1962, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the landscape before it is sprayed is biologically degraded, and may well contains alien species, the concept of what might constitute a natural landscape can still be deduced from the context.

The phrase "natural landscape" was first used in connection with [[landscape painting]], and [[landscape gardening]], to contrast a formal style with a more natural one, closer to nature. [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1769 – 1859) was to further conceptualize this into the idea of a natural landscape ''separate'' from the [[cultural landscape]]. Then in 1908 [[geographer]] [[Otto Schlüter]] developed the terms original landscape (''Urlandschaft'') and its opposite cultural landscape (''Kulturlandschaft'') in an attempt to give the science of geography a subject matter that was different from the other sciences. An early use of the actual phrase "natural landscape" by a [[geographer]] can be found in  [[Carl O. Sauer]]'s paper "The Morphology of Landscape" (1925).&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl O. Sauer]], "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography'' 2 (2), pp. 19-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the term==
The concept of a natural landscape was first developed in connection with [[landscape painting]], though the actual term itself was first used in relation to [[landscape gardening]]. In both cases it was used to contrast a formal style with a more natural one, that is closer to nature. Chunglin Kwa suggests, "that a seventeenth-century or early-eighteenth-century person could experience natural scenery ‘just like on a painting,’ and so, with or without the use of the word itself, designate it as a landscape."&lt;ref&gt;Chunglin Kwa, "Alexander von Humboldt's invention of the natural landscape", ''The European Legacy'', Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 149-162, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to landscape gardening John Aikin, commented in 1794: "Whatever, therefore, there be of ''novelty'' in the singular scenery of an artificial garden, it is soon exhausted, whereas the infinite diversity of a natural landscape presents an inexhaustible flore of new forms".&lt;ref&gt;J. Aikin, M.D., ''Letters from a Father to His Son, on Various Topics, Relative to Literature and the Conduct of Life. Written in the Years 1792 and 1793'',  (Philadelphia:  Samuel Harrison Smith), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1844 the prominent American landscape gardener [[Andrew Jackson Downing]] comments: "straight canals, round or oblong pieces of water, and all the regular forms of the geometric mode ... would evidently be in violent opposition to the whole character and expression of natural landscape".&lt;ref&gt;''A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening Adapted to North America''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his extensive travels in South America, [[Alexander von Humboldt]] became the first to conceptualize a natural landscape separate from the cultural landscape, though he does not actually use these terms.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/qnct310.txt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/cele/2005/00000010/00000002/art00002 Chunglin Kwa, Alexander von Humboldt's invention of the natural landscape, The European Legacy, Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 149-162, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group = note&gt;[http://www.avhumboldt.net/humboldt/publications/paragraph/did/35/vid/38/cid/244/tid/7698/text/The-description-of-nature-in-its-manifold-richness-of-form-as-a-distinct-branch-of-poetic-literat] "The description of nature in its manifold richness of form, as a distinct branch of poetic literature, was wholly unknown to the Greeks. The landscape appears among them merely as the basil-ground of the picture of which human figures constitute the main subject. Passions, breaking forth into action, riveted their attention almost exclusively." Alexander von Humboldt ''[[Cosmos: a sketch of a physical description of the universe]]'' (translation 1804), Volume 2, Part I, Paragraph 5, Chapter I.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Jackson Downing was aware of, and sympathetic to, Humboldt's ideas, which therefore influenced American landscape gardening.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Horticulturist'', vol.4, no.2, August 1849, which Downing edited.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the [[geographer]] [[Otto Schlüter]], in 1908, argued that by defining [[geography]] as a ''Landschaftskunde'' (landscape science) would give geography a logical subject matter shared by no other discipline.&lt;ref&gt;James, P.E &amp; Martin, G (1981) ''All Possible Worlds: A History of Geographical Ideas.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York, p.177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, T.H (1989) ''Human and Regional Geography in the German-speaking lands in the first forty years of the Twentieth Century''. Entriken, J. Nicholas &amp; Brunn, Stanley D (Eds) ''Reflections on Richard Hartshorne's The nature of geography''. Occasional publications of the Association of the American Geographers, Washington DC., p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; He defined two forms of landscape: the ''Urlandschaft'' (original landscape) or landscape that existed before major human induced changes and the ''Kulturlandschaft'' (cultural landscape) a landscape created by human culture. Schlüter argued that the major task of geography was to trace the changes in these two landscapes.

The term natural landscape is sometimes used as a synonym for [[wilderness]], but for geographers natural landscape is a scientific term which refers to the [[biological]], [[geological]], [[Climatology|climatological]] and other aspects of a landscape, not the cultural values that are implied by the word wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;"The Trouble with Wilderness; or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature". William Cronon, ed., ''Uncommon Ground: Rethinking the Human Place in Nature''. (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1995), pp. 69–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The natural and conservation===
Matters are complicated by the fact that the words nature and natural have more than one meaning. On the one hand there is the main dictionary meaning for nature: "The phenomena of the physical world collectively, including plants, animals, the landscape, and other features and products of the earth, as opposed to humans or human creations".&lt;ref&gt;"Nature", ''New Oxford American Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there is the growing awareness, especially since [[Charles Darwin]], of humanities biological affinity with nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.seattlepi.com/animals-share-human-dna-sequences-6693.html "Animals That Share Human DNA Sequences", Seattlepi.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] of the first definition has its roots is an "ancient concept", because early people viewed "nature, or the nonhuman world […] as a divine ''Other'', godlike in its separation from humans".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory H. Aplett and David N. Cole, "The Trouble with Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Goals" in ''Beyond Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Stewardshio in an Era of Rapid Change'' (Washington, DC.: Island Press, 2010), p. 14. They cite William Conron's 1995 essay "The Trouble with Wilderness: or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature".&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Western culture|West]], Christianity's myth of [[The fall of man|the fall]], that is the expulsion of humankind from the [[Garden of Eden]], where all creation lived in harmony, into an imperfect world, has been the major influence.&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Vining, Melinda Merrick and Emily Price, "The Distinction between Humans and Nature". ''Human Ecology Review'', vol.15, no. 1, 2008, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cartesian dualism]], from the seventeenth century on,  further reinforced this dualistic thinking about nature.&lt;ref&gt;Vining, Merrick and Price, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; 
With this [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] goes value judgement as to [[appeal to nature|the superiority of the natural over the artificial]]. Modern science, however, is moving towards a [[holistic]] view of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Kaika, ''City of Flows: Modernity, Nature, and the City''. (New York: Routledge, 2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

====America====
What is meant by natural, within the American [[conservation movement]], has been changing over the last century and a half.

In the mid-nineteenth century American began to realize that the land was becoming more and more domesticated and wildlife was disappearing. This led to the creation of [[National Park Service|American National Parks]] and other conservation sites.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory H. Aplett and David N. Cole, "The Trouble with Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Goals" in ''Beyond Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Stewardshio in an Era of Rapid Change'' (Washington, DC.: Island Press, 2010), pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially it was believed that all that was needed to do was to separate what was seen as natural landscape and "avoid disturbances such as logging, grazing, fire and insect outbreaks".&lt;ref name="Aplett and Cole, p. 15"&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; This, and subsequent environmental policy, until recently, was influenced by ideas of the wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;William Cronon, pp. 72-77&lt;/ref&gt; However, this policy was not consistently applied, and in [[Yellowstone Park]], to take one example, the existing ecology was altered, firstly by the exclusion of Native Americans and later with the virtual extermination of the wolf population.&lt;ref name="dow"&gt;{{cite web |title=Defenders of Wildlife |work=A Yellowstone Chronology |url=http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html |accessdate=2007-03-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607214843/http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html |archivedate=7 June 2007}}&lt;/ref{{cite book |last=Merchant |first=Carolyn |title=The Columbia Guide to American Environmental History |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-231-11232-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QQQximQsxSgC |page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A century later, in the mid-twentieth century, it began to be believed that the earlier policy of "protection from disturbance was inadequate to preserve park values", and that is that direct human intervention was necessary to restore the landscape of National Parks to its ‘’natural’’ condition.&lt;ref name="Aplett and Cole, p. 15"/&gt; In 1963 the [[Leopold Report]] argued that "A national park should represent a vignette of primitive America".&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; This policy change eventually led to the restoration of [[History of wolves in Yellowstone|wolves in Yellowstone Park]] in the 1990s.

However, recent research in various disciplines indicates that a pristine natural or "primitive" landscape is a myth, and it now realised that people have been changing the natural into a cultural landscape for a long while, and that there are few places untouched in some way from human influence.&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier conservation policies were now seen as cultural interventions. The idea of what is natural and what artificial or cultural, and how to maintain the natural elements in a landscape, has been further complicated by the discovery of [[global warming]] and how it is changing natural landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Also important is a reaction recently amongst scholars against dualistic thinking about nature and culture. Maria Kaika comments: "Nowadays, we are beginning to see nature and culture as intertwined once again – not [[ontologically]] separated anymore […].What I used to perceive as a compartmentalized world, consisting of neatly and tightly sealed, autonomous ‘space envelopes’ (the home, the city, and nature) was, in fact, a messy socio-spatial continuum”.&lt;ref&gt;''City of Flows: Modernity, Nature, and the City''. (New York: Routledge, 2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; And William Cronon argues against the idea of wilderness because it "involves a dualistic vision in which the human is entirely outside the natural"&lt;ref&gt;Cronon, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; and affirms that "wildness (as opposed to wilderness) can be found anywhere" even "in the cracks of a Manhattan sidewalk".&lt;ref name="Cronon, p. 85"&gt;Cronon, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cronon we have to "abandon the dualism that sees the tree in the garden as artificial […] and the tree in the wilderness as natural […] Both in some ultimate sense are wild."&lt;ref name="Cronon, p. 85"/&gt; Here he bends somewhat the regular dictionary meaning of wild, to emphasise that nothing natural, even in a garden, is fully under human control.

====Europe====
The landscape of Europe has considerably altered by people and even in an area, like the [[Cairngorm Mountains]] of [[Scotland]], with a low population density, only " the high summits of the [[Cairngorm Mountains]], consist entirely of natural elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snh.gov.uk/about-scotlands-nature/scotlands-landscapes/what-is-landscape/  [[Scottish Natural Heritage]], ]&lt;/ref&gt; These ''high summits'' are of course only part of the Cairngorms, and there are no longer wolves, bears, wild boar or lynx in Scotland's wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/6155172.stm | title = Extinct Island Pig Spotted Again | publisher = BBC News | date = 17 November 2006 | accessdate =1 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraser Darling and Boyd 1969 64"&gt;Fraser Darling and Boyd (1969) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scots pine]] in the form of the [[Caledonian forest]] also covered much more of the Scottish landscape than today.&lt;ref&gt;Steven, H. M. &amp; Carlisle, A. (1959). ''The Native Pinewoods of Scotland''. Oliver and Boyd, Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Swiss National Park]], however, represent a more natural landscape. It was founded in 1914, and is one of the earliest national parks in Europe.
Visitors are not allowed to leave the motor road, or paths through the park, make fire or camp. The only building within the park is Chamanna Cluozza, [[mountain hut]]. It is also forbidden to disturb the animals or the plants, or to take home anything found in the park. Dogs are not allowed. Due to these strict rules, the Swiss National Park is the only park in the Alps who has been categorized by the [[IUCN]] as a [[strict nature reserve]], which is the highest protection level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?code=SWI+01&amp;mode=all Parc Suisse Biosphere Reserve]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of natural landscape==
No place on the Earth is unaffected by people and their culture. People are part of [[biodiversity]], but human activity affects biodiversity, and this alters the natural landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html National Survey Reveals Biodiversity Crisis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607101209/http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html |date=7 June 2007 }} American Museum of Natural History&lt;/ref&gt; Mankind have altered landscape to such an extent that few places on earth remain pristine, but once free of human influences, the landscape can return to a natural or near natural state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4uDb0H4V5c YouTube, Professor James Lovelock, We can't save the planet, BBC NEWS, 2010/03/30]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wrangell St. Elias National Park.jpg|thumb| [[Glacier]] on the border between [[Alaska]], US, and Canada: [[Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek]] park system]]
Even the remote [[Yukon]] and [[Alaskan]] wilderness, the bi-national [[Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek]] park system comprising [[Kluane National Park|Kluane]], [[Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve|Wrangell-St Elias]], [[Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve|Glacier Bay]] and [[Tatshenshini-Alsek Park|Tatshenshini-Alsek]] parks, a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], is not free from human influence, because the [[Kluane National Park]] lies within the traditional territories of the Champagne and Aishihik [[First Nations]] and [[Kluane First Nation]] who have a long history of living in this region. Through their respective Final Agreements with the Canadian Government, they have made into law their rights to harvest in this region.

==Examples of cultural forces==
Cultural forces intentionally or unintentionally, have an influence upon the landscape.&lt;ref group = note&gt;[http://lamar.colostate.edu/%7Ehrolston/Technol-vs-Nature-Aberdeen.pdf "It is true that certain human technological actions do have unintended consequences that spread everywhere; there are contagious effects that seep into the nooks and crannies of all nature." Holmes Rolston III, "Technology versus nature, What is natural, Journal of Philosophy and Technology", ''Ends and Means'', Vol 2 No.2 Spring 1998, University of Aberdeen, Edinburgh University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cultural landscapes]] are places or artifacts created and maintained by people. Examples of cultural intrusions into a landscape are: fences, roads, parking lots, sand pits, buildings, hiking trails, management of plants, including the introduction of [[invasive species]], extraction or removal of plants, management of animals, mining, hunting, [[natural landscaping]], farming and forestry, pollution. Areas that might be confused with a natural landscape include [[public park]]s, farms, orchards, artificial lakes and reservoirs, managed forests, golf courses, nature center trails, gardens.

'''Nature-based solutions''' ('''NBS''' or '''NbS''') refers to the [[sustainable management]] and use of nature for tackling socio-environmental challenges. The challenges include issues such as [[climate change]], [[water security]], [[water pollution]], [[food security]], [[human health]], and [[disaster]] [[risk]] management. 

A definition by the [[European Union]] states that these solutions are "inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simultaneously provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build [[Resilience (engineering and construction)|resilience]]. The [http://www.naturebasedsolutionsinitiative.org/about/ Nature-based Solutions Initiative] meanwhile defines them as "actions that work with and enhance nature so as to help people adapt to change and disasters". Such solutions bring more, and more diverse, nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-efficient and systemic interventions".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.think-nature.eu/|title=thinknature|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With NBS, healthy, resilient and diverse [[ecosystems]] (whether natural, managed or newly created) can provide solutions for the benefit of societies and overall [[biodiversity]].

For instance, the restoration or protection of [[mangroves]] along coastlines utilizes a nature-based solution to accomplish several things. Mangroves moderate the impact of waves and wind on coastal settlements or cities and sequester CO&lt;sub&gt;2.&lt;/sub&gt; . They also provide safe nurseries for marine life that can be the basis for sustaining populations of fish that local populations may depend on. Additionally, the mangrove forests can help control coastal erosion resulting from sea level rise. Similarly, in cities [[green roofs]] or walls are nature-based solutions that can be used to moderate the impact of high temperatures, capture storm water, abate [[pollution]], and act as carbon sinks, while enhancing [[biodiversity]].

Conservation approaches and environment management initiatives have been carried out for decades. What is new is that the benefits of such nature-based solutions to human well-being have been articulated well more recently. Even if the term itself is still being framed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-01-12|title=‘Nature-based solutions’ is the latest green jargon that means more than you might think|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/541133b|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=541|issue=7636|pages=133–134|doi=10.1038/541133b|bibcode=2017Natur.541R.133.}}&lt;/ref&gt; examples of nature-based solutions can be found all over the world, and imitated. Nature-based solutions are on their way to being mainstreamed in national and international policies and programmes (e.g. climate change policy, law, infrastructure investment and financing mechanisms).{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} For example, the theme for [[World Water Day]] 2018 was "Nature for water" and by [[UN-Water]]'s accompanying [[UN World Water Development Report]] had the title "Nature-based Solutions for Water".&lt;ref&gt;UN-Water (2018) [http://www.unwater.org/publications/world-water-development-report-2018/ World Water Development Report 2018: Nature-based Solutions for Water], Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;

Societies increasingly face challenges such as [[climate change]], [[urbanization]], jeopardized [[food security]] and [[water resource]] provision, and [[disaster]] [[risk]]. One approach to answer these challenges is to singularly rely on technological strategies. An alternative approach is to manage the [[Socio-ecological system|(socio-)ecological systems]] in a comprehensive way in order to sustain and potentially increase the delivery of ecosystem services to humans. In this context, nature-based solutions (NBS) have recently been put forward by practitioners and quickly thereafter by [[policymakers]]. These solutions stress the sustainable use of nature in solving coupled environmental-social-economic challenges. 

While [[ecosystem services]] are often valued in terms of immediate benefits to human well-being and economy, NBS focus on the benefits to people and the environment itself, to allow for sustainable solutions that are able to respond to environmental change and [[hazard]]s in the long-term. NBS go beyond the traditional biodiversity conservation and management principles by "re-focusing" the debate on humans and specifically integrating societal factors such as human well-being and [[poverty reduction]], [[Socioeconomic development|socio-economic development]], and [[governance]] principles. 

With respect to water issues, NBS can achieve the following, according to the [[World Water Development Report]] 2018 by [[UN-Water]]:&lt;ref&gt;UN-Water (2018) [http://www.unwater.org/publications/world-water-development-report-2018/ World Water Development Report 2018], Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Use natural processes to enhance water availability (e.g., [[soil]] moisture retention, [[groundwater recharge]]),  
* Improve [[water quality]] (e.g., [[Wetland|natural wetlands]] and [[constructed wetlands]] to treat [[wastewater]], [[riparian buffer]] strips), and  
* Reduce risks associated with water‐related disasters and climate change (e.g., [[floodplain restoration]], [[green roofs]]).

These organisations refer to "policies and measures that take into account the role of ecosystem services in reducing the vulnerability of society to climate change, in a multi-sectoral and multi-scale approach".&lt;ref name="Cowan3" /&gt;

Likewise, natural infrastructure is defined as a "strategically planned and managed network of natural lands, such as forests and wetlands, working landscapes, and other open spaces that conserves or enhances ecosystem values and functions and provides associated benefits to human populations";&lt;ref name="Smith5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ozment6" /&gt; and [[green infrastructure]] refers to an "interconnected network of green spaces that conserves natural systems and provides assorted benefits to human populations".&lt;ref name="Benedict7" /&gt;

Similarly, the concept of [[ecological engineering]] generally refers to "protecting, restoring (i.e. ecosystem restoration) or modifying ecological systems to increase the quantity, quality and sustainability of particular services they provide, or to build new ecological systems that provide services that would otherwise be provided through more conventional engineering, based on non-renewable resources".&lt;ref name="Borsje8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barot9" /&gt;

== Objectives and framing ==

The general objective of NBS is clear, namely the sustainable management and use of nature for tackling societal challenges.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature). 2016. Resolution 077 World Conservation Congress 2016, Hawai’i (https://portals.iucn.org/congress/motion/077)
17. European Commission. 2016. Horizon2020 Work Programme 2016–2017 – 12. Climate action, environment, resource efficiency &amp; raw materials, 99 pp. (http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2016_2017/main/h2020-wp1617-climate_en.pdf)
&lt;/ref&gt; However, different stakeholders view NBS from other perspectives.&lt;ref name="Eggermont15"&gt;Eggermont, H., E. Balian, J. M.N. Azevedo, V. Beumer, T. Brodin, J. Claudet, B. Fady, M. Grube, H. Keune, P. Lamarque, K. Reuter, M. Smitt, C. Van Ham, W.W. Weisser, X. Le Roux. 2015. Nature-based solutions: New influence for Environmental Management and Research in Europe. GAIA Ecological Perspectives 24/4: 243–248.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[IUCN]]&lt;ref name="IUCN16"&gt;IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature). 2016. Resolution 077 World Conservation Congress 2016, Hawai’i (https://portals.iucn.org/congress/motion/077)&lt;/ref&gt; defines NBS as "actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems, which address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, while simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits". This framing puts the need for well-managed and restored ecosystems at the heart of NBS, with the overarching goal of "Supporting the achievement of society's development goals and safeguard human well-being in ways that reflect cultural and societal values and enhance the resilience of ecosystems, their capacity for renewal and the provision of services". 

In the context of the ongoing political debate on jobs and growth (main drivers of the current EU policy agenda), the European Commission underlines that NBS can transform environmental and societal challenges into innovation opportunities, by turning [[natural capital]] into a source for green growth and sustainable development.&lt;ref name="European Commission 2015" /&gt; In their view, NBS to societal challenges are "solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simultaneously provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. Such solutions bring more, and more diverse, nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-efficient and systemic interventions.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"&gt;European Commission. 2016. Horizon2020 Work Programme 2016–2017 – 12. Climate action, environment, resource efficiency &amp; raw materials, 99 pp. (http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2016_2017/main/h2020-wp1617-climate_en.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;" 

This framing is somewhat broader, and puts economy and social assets at the heart of NBS as importantly as sustaining environmental conditions. It shares similarities with the definition proposed by Maes and Jacobs (2015)&lt;ref&gt;Maes, J., S. Jacobs. 2015. Conservation Letters {{doi|10.1111/conl.12216}}&lt;/ref&gt; defining NBS as "any transition to a use of ES with decreased input of non-renewable natural capital and increased investment in renewable natural processes". In their view, development and evaluation of NBS spans three basic requirements: (1) decrease of fossil fuel input per produced unit; (2) lowering of systemic trade-offs and increasing synergies between ES; and (3) increasing labor input and jobs. Here, nature is seen as a tool to inspire more systemic solutions to societal problems.

Whatever definition used, promoting sustainability and the increased role of natural, self-sustained processes relying on [[biodiversity]], are inherent to NBS. They constitute actions easily seen as positive for a wide range of stakeholders, as they bring about benefits at environmental, economic and social levels. As a consequence, the concept of NBS is gaining acceptance outside the conservation community (e.g. urban planning) and is now on its way to be mainstreamed into policies and programmes (climate change policy, law, infrastructure investment and financing mechanisms).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

== Types ==

[[File:Fig 2 NbS.jpg|thumb|upright=1.46|Schematic presentation of the NBS typology.&lt;ref name="Eggermont15"/&gt;]]

In 2015,&lt;ref name="Eggermont15"/&gt; the European network [http://www.biodiversa.org BiodivERsA] mobilized a range of scientists, research donors and stakeholders and proposed a typology characterizing NBS along two gradients. 1. "how much engineering of biodiversity and ecosystems is involved in NBS", and 2. "how many ecosystem services and stakeholder groups are targeted by a given NBS". The typology highlights that NBS can involve very different actions on ecosystems (from protection to management and even creation of new ecosystems) and is based on the assumption that the higher the number of services and stakeholder groups targeted, the lower the capacity to maximize the delivery of each service and simultaneously fulfil the specific needs of all stakeholder groups. As such, three types of NBS are distinguished (Figure 2):

=== Type 1 – Minimal intervention in ecosystems ===
Type 1 NBS consists of no or minimal intervention in ecosystems, with the objectives of maintaining or improving the delivery of a range of ES both inside and outside of these conserved ecosystems. Examples include the protection of mangroves in coastal areas to limit risks associated to extreme weather conditions and provide benefits and opportunities to local populations; and the establishment of marine protected areas to conserve biodiversity within these areas while exporting biomass into fishing grounds. This type of NBS is connected to, for example, the concept of [[Man and the Biosphere Programme|biosphere reserves]] which incorporates core protected areas for nature conservation and buffer zones and transition areas where people live and work in a sustainable way.

=== Type 2 – Some interventions in ecosystems and landscapes ===
Type 2 NBS corresponds to management approaches that develop sustainable and multifunctional ecosystems and landscapes (extensively or intensively managed). These types improve the delivery of selected ES compared to what would be obtained with a more conventional intervention. Examples include innovative planning of agricultural landscapes to increase their multi-functionality; and approaches for enhancing tree species and genetic diversity to increase forest resilience to extreme events. This type of NBS is strongly connected to concepts like natural systems agriculture,&lt;ref name="Jackson1" /&gt; agro-ecology,&lt;ref&gt;Alteri, M.A. 1989. Agroecology – a new research and development paradigm for world agriculture. Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment 27: 37–36.&lt;/ref&gt; and evolutionary-orientated forestry.&lt;ref&gt;Lefèvre F. et al. 2014. Considering evolutionary processes in adaptive forestry. Annals of Forest Science 71: 723 – 739.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Type 3 – Managing ecosystems in extensive ways ===
Type 3 NBS consists of managing ecosystems in very extensive ways or even creating new ecosystems (e.g., artificial ecosystems with new assemblages of organisms for green roofs and walls to mitigate city warming and clean polluted air). Type 3 is linked to concepts like green and blue infrastructures and objectives like restoration of heavily degraded or polluted areas and greening cities.

Type 1 and 2 would typically fall within the IUCN NBS framework, whereas Type 2 and moreover Type 3 are often exemplified by EC for turning natural capital into a source for green growth and sustainable development.

=== Hybrid solutions ===
Hybrid solutions exist along this gradient both in space and time. For instance, at landscape scale, mixing protected and managed areas could be needed to fulfil multi-functionality and sustainability goals. Similarly, a [[constructed wetland]] can be developed as a type 3 but, when well established, may subsequently be preserved and surveyed as a type 1.

== Examples ==

Demonstrating the benefits of nature and healthy ecosystems and showcasing the return on investment they can offer is necessary in order to increase awareness, but also to provide support and guidance on how to implement NBS. A large number of initiatives around the world already highlight the effectiveness of NBS approaches to address a wide range of societal challenges.

==== East Kolkata wetlands ====
In 2018, [[The Hindu]] reported that the [[East Kolkata wetlands]], the world's largest organic sewage treatment facility had been used to clean the sewage of Kolkata in an organic manner by using algae for several decades. In use since the 1930s, the natural system was discovered by Dhrubajyoti Ghosh, an ecologist and a municipal engineer in the 1970s while working in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestatesman.com/opinion/wetlands-will-weep-today-1502586927.html|title=The wetlands will weep today|last1=Ghatak|first1=Aditi Roy|date=17 February 2018|accessdate=8 March 2018|publisher=The Statesman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghosh worked for decades to protect the wetlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dhrubajyoti.net/publ/Dr.%20Ghosh_changemaker.pdf|title=The Calcutta Wetlands: turning bad water into good|last1=Ghosh|first1=Dhrubajyoti|website=www.dhrubajyoti.net|publisher=Changemakers (issue October 2008)|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been a practice in [[Kolkata]], one of the five largest cities in [[India]], for the municipal authorities to pump sewage into shallow ponds (''bheris'').&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://dhrubajyoti.net/Final%20Ecosystem%20Book.pdf|title=Ecosystem management – towards merging theory and practice|last1=Ghosh|first1=Dhrubajyoti|date=2 October 2014|publisher=Nimby books|isbn=9788190657044|location=New delhi|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the heat of the tropical sun, algae proliferated in them, converting the sewage into clean water, which in turn was used by villagers to grow paddy and vegetables. This system has been in use in the region since the 1930s and treats 750 million litres of [[wastewater]] per day, giving livelihood to 100,000 people in the vicinity.&lt;ref name="kol"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aseem|first1=Shrivastava|title=The ecologically subsidised city: on Kolkata's wetland communities|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-ecologically-subsidised-city/article22970933.ece|accessdate=8 March 2018|publisher=The Hindu|date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For his work, Ghosh was included in the UN Global 500 Roll of Honour in 1990 and received the [[Luc Hoffmann]] award in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.global500.org/index.php/year/1990?start=100|title=Global 500 environmental forum|website=www.global500.org|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practical implementation ==
{{refimprove|section|date=March 2018}}
There is currently no accepted basis on which a government agency, municipality or private company can systematically assess the efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability of a particular nature-based solution. However, a series of principles are proposed to guide effective and appropriate implementation, and thus to upscale NBS in practice. For example, NBS embrace and are not meant to replace nature conservation norms. Also, NBS are determined by site-specific natural and cultural contexts that include traditional, local and scientific knowledge. NBS are an integral part of the overall design of policies, and measure or actions, to address a specific challenges. Finally, NBS can be implemented alone or in an integrated manner with other solutions to societal challenges (e.g. technological and engineering solutions) and they are applied at the landscape scale.

Implementing NBS requires political, economic, and scientific challenges to be tackled. First and foremost, private sector investment is needed, not to replace but to supplement traditional sources of capital such as public funding or [[philanthropy]]. The challenge is therefore to provide a robust evidence base for the contribution of nature to economic growth and jobs, and to demonstrate the economic viability of these solutions – compared to technological ones – on a timescale compatible with that of global change. Furthermore, it requires measures like adaptation of economic subsidy schemes, and the creation of opportunities for [[conservation finance]], to name a few. Indeed, such measures will be needed to scale up NBS interventions, and strengthen their impact in mitigating the world's most pressing challenges.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

=== Projects supported by the European Union ===
Since 2016, the EU is supporting a multi-stakeholder dialogue platform (called ThinkNature) to promote the co-design, testing and deployment of improved and innovative NBS in an integrated way.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Creation of such science-policy-business-society interfaces could promote the market uptake of NBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nikolaidis|first=Nikolaos P.|last2=Kolokotsa|first2=Dionyssia|last3=Banwart|first3=Steven A.|date=2017-03-16|title=Nature-based solutions: business|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7645/full/543315d.html?foxtrotcallback=true|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=543|issue=7645|pages=315–315|doi=10.1038/543315d|issn=0028-0836|bibcode=2017Natur.543..315N}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is part of the EU’s Horizon 2020 – Research and Innovation programme, and will last for 3 years. There are a total of 17 international partners involved, including the Technical University of Crete (Project Leader), the University of Helsinki and BiodivERsA.

In 2017, as part of the Presidency of the [[Estonia|Estonian Republic]] of the [[Council of the European Union]], a conference called “Nature-based Solutions: From Innovation to Common-use” was organized by the Ministry of the Environment of Estonia and the University of Tallinn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nbs2017.eu/|title=Nature-Based Solutions, Tallinn, 24–26 October 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conference aimed to strengthen synergies among various recent initiatives and programs related to NBS launched by the European Commission and by the EU Member States, focusing on policy and governance of NBS, and on research and innovation.

=== Nature-based Solutions in the Paris Agreement ===
In recognition of the importance of natural ecosystems for mitigation and adaptation, the [http://unfccc.int/files/essential_background/convention/application/pdf/english_paris_agreement.pdf Paris Agreement] calls on all Parties to acknowledge “the importance of the conservation and enhancement, as appropriate, of sinks and reservoirs of the greenhouse gases” and to “note the importance of ensuring the integrity of all ecosystems, including oceans, and the protection of biodiversity, recognized by some cultures as Mother Earth”. It then includes in its Articles several references to nature-based solutions. For example, Article 5.2 encourages Parties to adopt “…policy approaches and positive incentives for activities relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and the role of conservation and sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries; and alternative policy approaches, such as joint mitigation and adaptation approaches for the integral and sustainable management of forests, while reaffirming the importance of incentivizing, as appropriate, non-carbon benefits associated with such approaches”. Article 7.1 further encourages Parties to build the resilience of socioeconomic and ecological systems, including through economic diversification and sustainable management of natural resources. In total, the Agreement refers to nature (ecosystems, natural resources, forests) in 13 distinct places. An in-depth analysis &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbspolicyplatform.org/|title=Nature-Based Solutions Policy Platform|website=www.nbspolicyplatform.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; of all Nationally Determined Contributions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unfccc.int/process/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions/ndc-registry|title=Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) {{!}} UNFCCC|website=unfccc.int|language=en|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; submitted to UNFCCC, revealed that around 130 NDCs or 65% of signatories commit to nature-based solutions in their climate pledges, suggesting broad consensus for the role of nature in helping meet climate change goals. However, high-level commitments rarely translate into robust, measurable actions on-the-ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=July 2016|title=Ecosystem-based adaptation: a win–win formula for sustainability in a warming world?|url=http://pubs.iied.org/17364IIED/?k=Ecosystem-based+Adaptation+EbA&amp;p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The term NBS was put forward by practitioners in the late 2000s (in particular the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|International Union for the Conservation of Nature]] and the [[World Bank]]) and thereafter by policymakers in Europe (most notably the [[European Commission]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Faivre|first=Nicolas|last2=Fritz|first2=Marco|last3=Freitas|first3=Tiago|last4=Boissezon|first4=Birgit de|last5=Vandewoestijne|first5=Sofie|title=Nature-Based Solutions in the EU: Innovating with nature to address social, economic and environmental challenges|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2017.08.032|journal=Environmental Research|volume=159|pages=509–518|doi=10.1016/j.envres.2017.08.032|bibcode=2017ER....159..509F}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term "nature-based solutions" was first used in the late 2000s.&lt;ref name="MacKinnon11"&gt;MacKinnon, K., C. Sobrevila, V. Hickey. 2008. Biodiversity, climate change and adaptation: nature-based solutions from the Word Bank portfolio. Washington D.C.: World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mittermeier12"&gt;Mittermeier, R. et al. 2008. A Climate For Life: Meeting the Global Challenge. Arlington, VA: International League of Conservation Photographers.&lt;/ref&gt; It was used in the context of finding new solutions to mitigate and adapt to climate change effects, whilst simultaneously protecting biodiversity and improving sustainable livelihoods. 

The IUCN referred to NBS in a position paper for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature). 2009. No time to lose – make full use of nature-based solutions in the post-2012 climate change regime. Position paper on the Fifteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 15). Gland: IUCN.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was also adopted by European policymakers, in particular by the European Commission in a report&lt;ref name="European Commission 2015"&gt;European Commission. 2015. Towards an EU Research and Innovation policy agenda for nature-based solutions &amp; re-naturing cities. Final Report of the Horizon2020 Expert Group on Nature-Based Solutions and Re-Naturing Cities. Brussels: European Commission.&lt;/ref&gt; stressing that NBS can offer innovative means to create jobs and growth as part of a green economy. The term started to make appearances in the mainstream media around the time of the Global Climate Action Summit in California in September 2018 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nathalieseddon.blogspot.com/2018/09/global-climate-action-summit-kicks-off.html|title=Global Climate Action Summit kicks off today in San Francisco with nature-based solutions high on the agenda|website=Global Climate Action Summit kicks off today in San Francisco with nature-based solutions high on the agenda|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9251">[[File:Romuvan ritual fire.png|thumb|An ''aukuras'', a type of fire altar found in [[Romuva (religion)|Romuva]], a modern Pagan faith characterised as a "nature religion".]]

A '''nature religion''' is a religious movement that believes [[nature]] and the [[Natural environment|natural world]] is an embodiment of divinity, sacredness or spiritual power.&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 11"/&gt; Nature religions include [[indigenous religion]]s [[Nature worship|practiced]] in various parts of the world by cultures who consider the environment to be imbued with spirits and other sacred entities. It also includes [[modern Paganism|contemporary Pagan]] faiths which are primarily concentrated in Europe and North America.

The term "nature religion" was first coined by the American [[religious studies]] scholar [[Catherine Albanese]], who used it in her work ''Nature Religion in America: From the Algonkian Indians to the New Age'' (1991) and later went on to use it in other studies. Following on from Albanese's development of the term it has since been used by other academics working in the discipline.

==Definition==
Catherine Albanese described nature religion as "a symbolic center and the cluster of beliefs, behaviours, and values that encircles it", deeming it to be useful for shining a light on aspects of history that are rarely viewed as religious.{{sfn|Albanese|1991|pp=7&amp;ndash;8}}
In a paper of his on the subject, the Canadian religious studies scholar Peter Beyer described "nature religion" as a "useful analytical abstraction" to refer to "any religious belief or practice in which devotees consider nature to be the embodiment of divinity, sacredness, transcendence, spiritual power, or whatever cognate term one wishes to use".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 11"&gt;[[#Bey98|Beyer 1998]]. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to note that in this way nature religion was not an "identifiable religious tradition" such as [[Buddhism]] or [[Christianity]] are, but that it instead covers "a range of religious and quasi-religious movements, groups and social networks whose participants may or may not identify with one of the many constructed religions of global society which referred to many other nature religion."&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 16"&gt;[[#Bey98|Beyer 1998]]. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amatciems July 2015.jpg|thumb|left|Amatciems, a settlement of [[Ringing Cedars' Anastasians]] in [[Drabeši Parish]], [[Latvia]]. Anastasianism is a Russian-originated modern Pagan movement that sacralises environmental and human nativity (''[[Rod (Slavic religion)|Rod]]''), and is therefore regarded as a "nature religion".]]

===Common characteristics===
Peter Beyer noted the existence of a series of common characteristics which he believed were shared by different nature religions. He remarked that although "one must be careful not to overgeneralise", he suspected that there were a series of features which "occur sufficiently often" in those nature religions known to recorded scholarship to constitute a pattern.&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt;

The first of these common characteristics was nature religion's "comparative resistance to institutionalisation and legitimisation in terms of identifiable socio-religious authorities and organisations", meaning that nature religionists rarely formed their religious beliefs into large, visible socio-political structures such as churches. Furthermore, Beyer noted, nature religionists often held a "concomitant distrust of and even eschewing of politically orientated power".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt; Instead of this, he felt that among nature religious communities, there was "a valuing of community as non-hierarchical" and a "conditional optimism with regard to human capacity and the future."&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt;

In the sphere of the environment, Beyer noted that nature religionists held to a "holistic conception of reality" and "a valorisation of physical place as vital aspects of their spiritualities".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt; Similarly, Beyer noted the [[individualism]] which was favoured by nature religionists. He remarked that those adhering to such beliefs typically had respect for "charismatic and hence purely individual authority" and place a "strong emphasis on individual paths" which led them to believe in "the equal value of individuals and groups". Along similar lines, he also commented on the "strong experiential basis" to nature religionist beliefs "where personal experience is a final arbiter of truth or validity".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt;

==Use within academia==
In April 1996, the [[University of Lancaster]] in North West England held a conference on contemporary Paganism entitled "Nature Religion Today: Western Paganism, Shamanism and Esotericism in the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Samuel|first=Geoffrey|date=1996-10-01|title=Nature Religion Today: Western Paganism, Shamanism and Esotericism in the 1990s. Conference at the Lake District Campus of Lancaster University, 9th to 13th April 1996|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1006/reli.1996.0031|journal=Religion|volume=26|issue=4|pages=373–376|doi=10.1006/reli.1996.0031|issn=0048-721X}}&lt;/ref&gt;", and ultimately led to the publication of an academic anthology of the same name two years later.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pea98|Pearson, Roberts and Samuel 1998]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 8"&gt;[[#Clif04|Clifton 2004]]. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; This book, ''Nature Religion Today: Paganism in the Modern World'', was edited by members of the University's Department of Religious Studies, a postgraduate named Joanne Pearson and two professors, Richard H. Roberts and Geoffrey Samuel.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pea98|Pearson, Roberts and Samuel 1998]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In his study of [[Wicca]], the [[Pagan studies]] scholar Ethan Doyle White expressed the view that the category of "nature religion" was problematic from a "historical perspective" because it solely emphasises the "commonalities of belief and attitude to the natural world" that are found between different religions and in doing so divorces these different belief systems from their distinctive socio-cultural and historical backgrounds.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=8}}

'''Open energy system database''' projects employ [[open data]] methods to collect, [[Data cleansing|clean]], and republish energy-related [[dataset]]s for open use.  The resulting information is then available, given a suitable [[open license]], for statistical analysis and for building numerical [[energy system]] [[Energy modeling|models]], including [[open energy system models]].  Permissive licenses like [[Creative Commons]] [[CC0]] and {{nowrap|[[CC BY]]}} are preferred, but some projects will house data made public under market transparency regulations and carrying unqualified [[copyright]].

The databases themselves may furnish information on national power plant fleets, renewable generation assets, transmission networks, [[time series]] for electricity loads, dispatch, [[Spot contract|spot prices]], and cross-border trades, weather information, and similar.  They may also offer other energy statistics including fossil fuel imports and exports, gas, oil, and coal prices, emissions certificate prices, and information on [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] costs and benefits.

Much of the data is sourced from official or semi-official agencies, including [[Official statistics|national statistics offices]], [[transmission system operator]]s, and [[Electricity market|electricity market operators]].  Data is also [[Crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] using public [[wiki]]s and public upload facilities.  Projects usually also maintain a strict record of the [[wiktionary:provenance|provenance]] and version histories of the datasets they hold.  Some projects, as part of their mandate, also try to persuade primary data providers to release their data under more liberal licensing conditions.{{efn|For example, in 2016 the [[#Open Power System Data|Open Power System Data]] project persuaded four German [[transmission system operator]]s to adopt open licensing.&lt;ref name="osi-2016"/&gt;}}

Two drivers favor the establishment of such databases.  The first is a wish to reduce the duplication of effort that accompanies each new analytical project as it assembles and processes the data that it needs from primary sources.  And the second is an increasing desire to make [[public policy]] energy models more transparent to improve their acceptance by policymakers and the public.&lt;ref name="acatech-etal-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Better transparency dictates the use of open information, able to be accessed and scrutinized by third-parties, in addition to releasing the [[source code]] for the models in question.&lt;ref name="decarolis-etal-2012"/&gt;

&lt;!-- The projects listed here are deemed suitable for inclusion through having pending or published academic literature or by being reported in secondary sources. --&gt;

== General considerations ==

=== Background ===

In the mid-1990s, energy models used structured text files for data interchange but efforts were being made to migrate to [[relational database management system]]s for data processing.&lt;ref name="groscurth-1995-075bf0"&gt;
{{cite journal

 | doi = 10.1080/00908319508946093
 | issn = 0090-8312
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  These early efforts however remained local to a project and did not involve online publishing or open data principles.

The first energy information portal to go live was [[#OpenEI|OpenEI]] in late 2009, followed by [[#reegle|reegle]] in 2011.

A 2012 paper marks the first scientific publication to advocate the [[crowdsourcing]] of energy data.&lt;ref name="bazilian-etal-2012"&gt;
{{cite journal

 | access-date = 2016-06-17
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2012 PhD thesis by Chris Davis also discusses the crowdsourcing of energy data in some depth.&lt;ref name="davis-2012"/&gt;  A 2016 thesis surveyed the spatial ([[geographic information system|GIS]]) information requirements for energy planning and finds that most types of data, with the exception of energy expenditure data, are available but nonetheless remain scattered and poorly coordinated.&lt;ref name="berndtsson-2016-msc"&gt;
{{cite thesis

 | access-date = 2017-03-07
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of open data, a 2017 paper concludes that energy research has lagged behind other fields, most notably physics, biotechnology, and medicine.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"&gt;
{{cite journal

 | access-date = 2017-02-03
}} {{open access}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|213–214}}  The paper also lists the benefits of open data and open models and discusses the reasons that many projects nonetheless remain closed.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|211–213}}  A one-page opinion piece from 2017 advances the case for using open energy data and modeling to build public trust in policy analysis.  The article also argues that [[academic journal|scientific journals]] have a responsibility to require that data and code be submitted alongside text for [[peer review]].&lt;ref name="pfenninger-2017"&gt;&lt;!-- alternative url: http://www.nature.com/news/energy-scientists-must-show-their-workings-1.21517 --&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Database design ===

[[Data models]] are central to the design and organization of databases.  Open energy database projects generally try to develop and adhere to well resolved data models, using [[De facto standard|de{{nbsp}}facto]] and [[Technical standard|published standards]] where applicable.  Some projects attempt to coordinate their data models in order to harmonize their data and improve its utility.  Defining and maintaining suitable [[metadata]] is also a key issue.  The [[Information lifecycle management|life-cycle management]] of data includes, but is not limited to, the use of [[version control]] to track the provenance of incoming and [[Data cleansing|cleansed]] data.  Some sites allow users to comment on and rate individual datasets.

=== Dataset copyright and database rights ===

Issues surrounding [[copyright]] remain at the forefront with regard to open energy data.  As noted, most energy datasets are collated and published by official or semi-official sources.  But many of the publicly available energy datasets carry no license, limiting their reuse in numerical and statistical models, open or otherwise.  Copyright protected material cannot lawfully be circulated, nor can it be modified and republished.

{{anchor|ec-regulation-543-2013}}Measures to enforce [[Transparency (market)|market transparency]] have not helped much because the associated information is again not licensed to enable modification and republication.  Transparency measures include the 2013 European energy market transparency regulation 543/2013.&lt;ref name="ec-regulation-543-2013"&gt;
{{cite journal
 | author = European Commission
 | title = Commission Regulation (EU) No 543/2013 of 14 June 2013 on submission and publication of data in electricity markets and amending Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council

 | journal = Official Journal of the European Union
 | volume = L&amp;nbsp;163
 | pages = 1–12

 | access-date = 2016-12-01
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, 543/2013 "is only an obligation to publish, not an obligation to license".&lt;ref name="boecker-2016"/&gt;{{rp|slide{{nnbsp}}14}}  Notwithstanding, 543/2013 does enable downloaded data to be computer processed with legal certainty.&lt;ref name="jaeger-2017"/&gt;{{rp|5}}

Energy databases with hardware located with the European Union are protected under a general [[Sui generis database right|database law]], irrespective of the legal status of the information they hold.&lt;ref name="boecker-2016"&gt;
{{cite book

 | access-date = 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Database rights not waived by public sector providers significantly restrict the amount of data a user can lawfully access.

A December 2017 submission by energy researchers in Germany and elsewhere highlighted a number of concerns over the re-use of public sector information within the Europe Union.&lt;ref name="morrison-etal-2017"&gt;
{{cite book
 | last1 = Morrison | first1 = Robbie

 | access-date = 2017-12-13
}} {{open access}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The submission drew heavily on a recent legal opinion covering electricity data.&lt;ref name="jaeger-2017"&gt;
{{cite book
 | last1 = Jaeger | first1 = Till
 | title = Legal aspects of European electricity data — Legal opinion
 | date = 24 July 2017
 | publisher = JBB Rechtsanwälte
 | location = Berlin, Germany
 | url = https://open-power-system-data.org/legal-opinion.pdf
 | access-date = 2017-10-13
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy statistics ===

National and international energy statistics are published regularly by governments and international agencies, such as the [[International Energy Agency|IEA]].&lt;ref name="iea-2016"&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = Key world energy statistics
 | date = 2016

 | location = Paris, France
 | url = https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld2016.pdf
 | access-date = 2016-12-15
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016 the United Nations issued guidelines for energy statistics.&lt;ref name="ires-2016"&gt;&lt;!-- print ISBN: 978-92-1-161584-5 --&gt;
&lt;!-- PDF dated: 23 September 2016  --&gt;
{{cite book|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/energy/ires/IRES_edited2.pdf|title=International Recommendations for Energy Statistics (IRES) — ST/ESA/STAT/SER.M/93|date=2016|publisher=Statistics Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, United Nations|isbn=978-92-1-056520-2|location=New York, NY, USA|access-date=2016-12-17}}  Annotated as final edited version prior to typesetting.  Also covers energy-related greenhouse gas emissions accounting.
&lt;/ref&gt;  While the definitions and sectoral breakdowns are useful when defining models, the information provided is rarely in sufficient detail to enable its use in high-resolution energy system models.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|213}}

=== Published standards ===

There are few published standards covering the collection and structuring of high-resolution energy system data.  The [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] [[Common Information Model (electricity)|Common Information Model]] (CIM) defines data exchange protocols for low and high voltage electricity networks.

== Open energy system database projects ==

Energy system models are data intensive and normally require detailed information from a number of sources.  Dedicated projects to collect, collate, document, and republish energy system datasets have arisen to service this need.  Most database projects prefer open data, issued under [[Copyright|free licenses]], but some will accept datasets with proprietary licenses in the absence of other options.

The [[OpenStreetMap]] project, which uses the [[Open Database License]] (ODbL), contains geographic information about energy system components, including transmission lines.  Wikipedia itself has a growing set of information related to national energy systems, including descriptions of individual power stations.&lt;ref name="davis-2012"/&gt;{{rp|156–159}}

The following [[#table-open-energy-system-database-projects|table]] summarizes projects that specifically publish open energy system data.  Some are general repositories while others (for instance, [[#oedb|oedb]]) are designed to interact with open energy system models in real-time.

{{anchor|tag-linked-open-data}} Three of the projects listed work with [[Linked data#Linked open data|linked open data]] (LOD), a method of publishing structured data on the [[World Wide Web|web]] so that it can be networked and subject to [[Semantic query|semantic queries]].  The overarching concept is termed the [[semantic web]].  Technically, such projects support [[Representational state transfer|RESTful APIs]], [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]], and the [[SPARQL]] query language.  A 2012 paper reviews the use of LOD in the renewable energy domain.&lt;ref name="abanda-and-tah-2012"&gt;&lt;!--

The energydata.info project from the [[World Bank Group]], [[Washington, DC]], USA is an energy database portal designed to support national development by improving public access to energy information.&lt;ref name="energydata-info-website"&gt;
{{cite web
 | title = Welcome — Energy Data

 | url = https://energydata.info/
 | access-date = 2017-01-17
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  As well as sharing data, the platform also offers tools to visualize and analyze energy data.  Although the World Bank Group has made available a number of dataset and apps, external users and organizations are encouraged to contribute.  The concepts of open data and open source development are central to the project.  energydata.info uses its own [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of the [[CKAN]] open source data portal as its web-based platform.  The Creative Commons [[Creative Commons license|CC BY 4.0]] license is preferred for data but other open licenses can be deployed. Users are also bound by the terms of use for the site.&lt;ref name="energydata-info-terms-of-use"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2017|01}}, the database held 131{{nbsp}}datasets, the great majority related to [[Developing country|developing countries]].  The datasets are tagged and can be easily filtered.  A number of download formats, including [[Geographic information system|GIS]] files, are supported: [[Comma-separated values|CSV]], [[Microsoft Excel|XLS]], [[Office Open XML|XLSX]], [[ArcGIS]], [[Esri]], [[GeoJSON]], [[Keyhole Markup Language|KML]], and [[Shapefile|SHP]].  Some datasets are also offered as [[HTML]].  Again, {{as of|lc=yes|2017|01}}, four apps are available.  Some are web-based and run from a browser.

The OpenEnergy Platform (OEP) is a collaborative versioned [[dataset]] repository for storing open energy system model datasets.  A dataset is presumed to be in the form of a [[table (database)|database table]], together with [[metadata]].  Registered users can upload and download datasets manually using a web-interface or programmatically via an [[Application programming interface|API]] using [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] [[POST (HTTP)|POST]] calls.  Uploaded datasets are screened for integrity using deterministic rules and then subject to confirmation by a moderator.  The use of versioning means that any prior state of the database can be accessed (as recommended in this 2012 paper).&lt;ref name="decarolis-etal-2012"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, the repository is specifically designed to interoperate with energy system models.  The [[Front and back ends|backend]] is a [[PostgreSQL]] [[object-relational database]] under [[Apache Subversion|subversion]] [[version control]].  Open source licenses are specific to each dataset.  Unlike other database projects, users can download the current version (the public tables) of the entire [[PostgreSQL]] database or any previous version.  Initial development is being lead by the Reiner Lemoine Institute, [[Berlin]], Germany.

Developers collate and harmonize data from a range of government, regulatory, and industry sources throughout Europe.  The website and the metadata utilize English, whereas the original material can be in any one of [[Languages of European Union|24{{nbsp}}languages]].  Datasets follow the emerging [[Comma-separated values#OKI frictionless tabular data package|frictionless data package]] standard being developed by [[Open Knowledge International]] (OKI).  The website was launched on 28{{nbsp}}October 2016.  {{as of|2018|06}}, the project offers the following primary packages, for Germany and other European countries:

* details, including [[geolocation]], of conventional power plants and renewable energy power plants
* aggregated generation capacity by technology and country
* hourly [[time series]] covering electrical load, day-ahead electricity spot prices, and wind and solar resources
* a script to filter and download [[NASA]] MERRA-2 satellite weather data{{efn|name=merra-2|
MERRA-2 stands for Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2.  The [[Remote sensing|remote-sensed]] data is provided unencumbered by the [[NASA]] [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] research laboratory.

In addition, the project hosts selected contributed packages:

* electricity demand and self-generation time series for representative south German households
* simulated [[Photovoltaics|PV]] and wind generation [[capacity factor]] time series for Europe, generated by the [[#Renewables.ninja|Renewables.ninja]] project

To facilitate analysis, the data is aggregated into large structured files (in [[comma-separated values|CSV]] format) and loaded into data packages with standardized machine-readable metadata (in [[JSON]] format).&lt;ref name="oki-data-package"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The same data is usually also provided as [[Office Open XML|XLSX]] ([[Microsoft Excel|Excel]]) and [[SQLite]] files.  The datasets can be accessed in real-time using stable [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]].  The [[Python (programming language)|Python]] scripts deployed for data processing are available on [[GitHub]] and carry an [[MIT license]].  The licensing conditions for the data itself depends on the source and varies in terms of openness.  Previous versions of the datasets and scripts can be recovered in order to track changes or replicate earlier studies.  The project also engages with energy data providers, such as [[transmission system operator]]s (TSO) and [[European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity|ENTSO-E]], to encourage them to make their data available under [[Copyright#Free licences|open licenses]] (for instance, [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons]] and [[Open Database License|ODbL]] licenses).&lt;ref name="osi-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  While much of its data is from US government sources, the platform is intended to be open and global in scope.

OpenEI provides two mechanisms for contributing structured information: a [[semantic wiki]] (using [[MediaWiki]] and the [[Semantic MediaWiki]] extension) for collaboratively-managed resources and a [[dataset]] upload facility for contributor-controlled resources.  US government data is distributed under a [[CC0]] [[public domain]] dedication, whereas other contributors are free to select an open data license of their choice.  Users can rate data using a five-star system, based on accessibility, adaptability, usefulness, and general quality.&lt;ref name="brodt-giles-2012"/&gt;  Individual datasets can be manually downloaded in an appropriate format, often as [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] files.&lt;ref name="brodt-giles-2012"/&gt; [[Scripting language|Scripts]] for processing data can also be shared through the site.  In order to build a community around the platform, a number of [[Internet forum|forums]] are offered covering energy system data and related topics.&lt;ref name="openei-homepage"/&gt;

Most of the data on OpenEI is exposed as [[Linked data#Linked open data|linked open data]] (LOD) (described [[#tag-linked-open-data|elsewhere]] on this page).  OpenEI also uses LOD methods to populate its definitions throughout the wiki with real-time connections to [[DBPedia]], [[#reegle|reegle]], and [[Wikipedia]].&lt;ref name="brodt-giles-2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bauer-and-kaltenboeck-2012"&gt;

OpenGridMap employs [[crowdsourcing]] techniques to gather detailed data on electricity network components and then infer a realistic network structure using methods from [[Correlation and dependence|statistics]] and [[graph theory]].  The scope of the project is worldwide and both distribution and transmission networks can be [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineered]].  The project is managed by the Chair of Business Information Systems, [https://www.in.tum.de/en.html TUM Department of Informatics], [[Technical University of Munich]], [[Munich]], Germany.  The project maintains a website and a [[Facebook]] page and provides an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[mobile app]] to help the public document electrical devices, such as [[transformer]]s and [[Electrical substation|substations]].

OpenGridMap provides a tailored [[Geographic information system|GIS]] web application, layered on [[OpenStreetMap]], which contributors can use to upload and edit information directly.  The same database automatically stores field recordings submitted by the mobile app.  Subsequent classification by experts allows normal citizens to document and photograph electrical components and have them correctly identified.  The project is experimenting with the use of hobby drones to obtain better information on associated facilities, such as [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] installations.  Transmission line data is also sourced from and shared with OpenStreetMap.  Each component [[Row (database)|record]] is verified by a moderator.

Once sufficient data is available, the transnet software is run to produce a likely network, using [[Correlation and dependence|statistical correlation]], [[Voronoi diagram|Voronoi partitioning]], and [[minimum spanning tree]] (MST) algorithms.  The resulting network can be exported in [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] (separate files for nodes and lines), [[XML]], and [[Common Information Model (electricity)|CIM]] formats.  CIM models are well suited for translation into software-specific data formats for further analysis, including [[Power system simulation|power grid simulation]].  Transnet also displays [[descriptive statistics]] about the resulting network for visual confirmation.&lt;ref name="rivera-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|3–5}}

The project is motivated by the need to provide datasets for high-resolution energy system models, so that energy system transitions (like the German ''[[Energiewende]]'') can be better managed, both technically and policy-wise.&lt;ref name="energate-messenger-2016"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The rapid expansion of [[Renewable energy|renewable generation]] and the anticipated uptake of [[electric vehicle]]s means that electricity system models must increasingly represent distribution and transmission networks in some detail.

{{as of|2017}}, OpenGridMap techniques have been used to estimate the low voltage network in the German city of [[Garching bei München|Garching]] and to estimate the high voltage grids in several other countries.

The website displays an interactive world map to aid the selection of a site.  Users can then choose a plant type and enter some technical characteristics.  {{as of|2017|02}}, only year 2014 data can be served, due to technical restrictions.  The results are automatically plotted and are available for download in hourly [[comma separated values|CSV]] format with or without the associated weather information.  The site offers an [[Application programming interface|API]] for programmatic dataset recovery using token-based authorization.  Examples deploying [[cURL]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] are provided.

A number of studies have been undertaking using the power production datasets underpinning the website (these studies predate the launch of the website), with the bulk focusing on energy options for [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref name="staffel-and-green-2014"&gt;

The '''Orapa Power Station''' is a [[Peaking power plant|Peak load power generation plant]] located in the mining town of [[Orapa]] in northeastern [[Botswana]] in the [[Central District (Botswana)|Central District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=4&amp;aid=587&amp;dir=2011/October/Monday10/|title=Mmegi Online :: Orapa power plant to be finally launched|work=Mmegi Online|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is built within the [[Debswana|Debswana Diamond Company Ltd]] [[Orapa diamond mine]] [[lease|fenced leased area]] and is operated by the [[Botswana Power Corporation]].


==Background==
The plant construction was initiated when [[Botswana]] started experiencing electricity supply challenges from year '''2007''' when demand for electricity in the [[country]] started exceeding the county's electricity generation capacity leading to forced periodic nation wide [[Rolling_blackout|load shedding]] excises by the [[Botswana Power Corporation]]. The plant was a short term response to the mining industry electricity requirements&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=4&amp;aid=5796&amp;dir=2010/October/Friday22 Developers of Orapa's 90MW push for 60 % cost reduction]&lt;/ref&gt; prior to the development of Mmamabula and Morupule B power stations.

The plant site is located next to an [[electrical substation]] through which it connects to the [[Electrical grid|national grid]] and was designed to use either [[natural gas]] or [[Diesel_fuel|diesel]] as [[fuel]]. It was commissioned using [[Diesel_fuel|diesel]] with a planned conversion to [[natural gas]] once construction of a [[Pipeline transport|gas pipeline]] from nearby [[Coalbed methane|gas fields]] was complete and commissioned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundaystandard.info/kalahari-energy-convert-diesel-orapa-power-plant-cbm-operation Kalahari Energy to convert diesel Orapa Power Plant to CBM operation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specifications==
The plant consists of two 45MW [[GE LM6000]] Sprint [[Simple_cycle_combustion_turbine|Simple Cycle]] [[gas turbines]] fueled using [[Diesel_fuel|diesel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sundaystandard.info/bpc-gets-orapa-90mw-power-station|title=BPC gets Orapa 90MW Power Station {{!}} Sunday Standard|website=www.sundaystandard.info|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The energy produced is transferred to the [[Electrical grid|national grid]] via the interconnected Orapa Substation by use of two short [[Electric power transmission|132kV overhead power lines]].

'''Patterns in nature''' are visible regularities of form found in the natural world. These [[patterns]] recur in different contexts and can sometimes be [[modelled mathematically]]. Natural patterns include [[symmetries]], [[trees]], [[spirals]], [[meanders]], [[wave]]s, [[foams]], [[tessellations]], [[fracture|cracks]] and stripes.{{sfn|Stevens|1974|page=3}} Early [[Greek philosophers]] studied pattern, with [[Plato]], [[Pythagoras]] and [[Empedocles]] attempting to explain order in nature. The modern understanding of visible patterns developed gradually over time.

In the 19th century, Belgian physicist [[Joseph Plateau]] examined [[soap film]]s, leading him to formulate the concept of a [[minimal surface]]. German biologist and artist [[Ernst Haeckel]] painted hundreds of [[Marine biology|marine organisms]] to emphasise their [[symmetry]]. Scottish biologist [[D'Arcy Thompson]] pioneered the study of growth patterns in both plants and animals, showing that simple equations could explain spiral growth. In the 20th century, British mathematician [[Alan Turing]] predicted mechanisms of [[morphogenesis]] which give rise to [[Turing patterns|patterns]] of spots and stripes. Hungarian biologist [[Aristid Lindenmayer]] and French American mathematician [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] showed how the mathematics of [[fractals]] could create plant growth patterns.

[[Mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] can explain patterns in nature at different levels. Patterns in living things are explained by the [[biology|biological]] processes of [[natural selection]] and [[sexual selection]]. Studies of [[pattern formation]] make use of [[computer models]] to simulate a wide range of patterns.

==History==
[[File:Cycas circinalis male cone in Olomouc.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fibonacci]] patterns occur widely in plant structures, including this cone of queen sago, ''[[Cycas circinalis]]'']]

Early Greek philosophers attempted to explain order in [[nature]], anticipating modern concepts. [[Plato]] (c. 427 – c. 347 BC) — looking only at his work on natural patterns — argued for the existence of [[universals (metaphysics)|universals]]. He considered these to consist of [[Theory of Forms|ideal forms]] ({{lang|grc|εἶδος}} ''eidos'': "form") of which physical objects are never more than imperfect copies. Thus, a flower may be roughly circular, but it is never a perfect mathematical circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism/ | title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | publisher=Stanford University | work=Platonism in Metaphysics | origyear=2004 | date=7 April 2009 | accessdate=4 May 2012 | author=Balaguer, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pythagoras]] explained patterns in nature like the harmonies of music as arising from number, which he took to be the basic constituent of existence.&lt;ref&gt;The so-called Pythagoreans, who were the first to take up mathematics, not only advanced this subject, but saturated with it, they fancied that the principles of mathematics were the principles of all things. [[Aristotle]], ''Metaphysics 1–5 '', cc. 350 BC&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empedocles]] to an extent anticipated [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s evolutionary explanation for the structures of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle reports Empedocles arguing that, "[w]herever, then, everything turned out as it would have if it were happening for a purpose, there the creatures survived, being accidentally compounded in a suitable way; but where this did not happen, the creatures perished." ''The Physics'', B8, 198b29 in Kirk, et al., 304).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1202, [[Fibonacci|Leonardo Fibonacci]] (c. 1170 – c. 1250) introduced the Fibonacci number sequence to the western world with his book ''[[Liber Abaci]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Parmanand. ''Acharya Hemachandra and the (so called) Fibonacci Numbers''. Math. Ed. Siwan, 20(1):28–30, 1986. {{issn|0047-6269}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fibonacci gave an (unrealistic) biological example, on the growth in numbers of a theoretical [[rabbit]] population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Knott | first = Ron | title = Fibonacci's Rabbits | url=http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibnat.html#Rabbits | publisher =[[University of Surrey]] Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1658, the English physician and philosopher [[Sir Thomas Browne]] discussed "how Nature Geometrizeth" in ''[[The Garden of Cyrus]]'', citing [[Pythagorean numerology]] involving the number 5, and the [[Platonic form]] of the [[quincunx]] pattern. The discourse's central chapter features examples and observations of the [[quincunx]] in botany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Browne, Thomas |authorlink=Sir Thomas Browne |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/gardennoframes/garden3.html |title=How Nature Geometrizeth |work=[[The Garden of Cyrus]] |date=1658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, [[D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson]] (1860–1948) published his book ''[[On Growth and Form]]''. His description of [[phyllotaxis]] and the [[Fibonacci sequence]], the mathematical relationships in the spiral growth patterns of plants, is classic. He showed that simple equations could describe all the apparently complex spiral growth patterns of [[animal horn]]s and [[mollusc shell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darcythompson.org/about.html About D'Arcy]. D' Arcy 150. [[University of Dundee]] and the [[University of St Andrews]]. Retrieved 16 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Belgian physicist [[Joseph Plateau]] (1801–1883) formulated the [[Plateau's problem|mathematical problem]] of the existence of a [[minimal surface]] with a given boundary, which is now named after him. He studied soap films intensively, formulating [[Plateau's laws]] which describe the structures formed by films in foams.{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=108–109}}

The German psychologist [[Adolf Zeising]] (1810–1876) claimed that the [[golden ratio]] was expressed in the arrangement of plant parts, in the [[skeleton]]s of animals and the branching patterns of their veins and nerves, as well as in the geometry of [[crystal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Proportion | author=Padovan, Richard | authorlink=Richard Padovan | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | date=1999 | isbn=978-0-419-22780-9 | pages=305–306 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=Vk_CQULdAssC&amp;pg=PA306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Nexus Network Journal | first=Richard | last=Padovan | authorlink=Richard Padovan | title=Proportion: Science, Philosophy, Architecture | volume=4 | pages=113–122 | doi=10.1007/s00004-001-0008-7 | date=2002 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Adolf | last=Zeising | title=Neue Lehre van den Proportionen des meschlischen Körpers |date=1854 | page=preface | nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernst Haeckel]] (1834–1919) painted beautiful illustrations of marine organisms, in particular [[Radiolaria]], emphasising their [[symmetry]] to support his faux-[[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] theories of evolution.{{sfn|Ball|2009|page=41}}

The American photographer [[Wilson Bentley]] (1865–1931) took the first micrograph of a [[snowflake]] in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Photography | volume=1 | first=John | last=Hannavy | publisher=CRC Press | date=2007 | isbn=978-0-415-97235-2 | page=149 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=PJ8DHBay4_EC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=wilson+bentley+january+15#v=onepage&amp;q=wilson%20bentley%20january%2015&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Drcy.svg|thumb|[[D'Arcy Thompson]] pioneered the study of growth and form in his 1917 book]]
In 1952, [[Alan Turing]] (1912–1954), better known for his work on computing and [[codebreaking]], wrote ''[[The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis]]'', an analysis of the mechanisms that would be needed to create patterns in living organisms, in the process called [[morphogenesis]].&lt;ref name=Turing&gt;{{Cite journal| last= Turing | first= A. M. | authorlink=Alan Turing | title = The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis | journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] | volume = 237 | pages = 37–72 | date = 1952 | doi=10.1098/rstb.1952.0012 | issue= 641| bibcode = 1952RSPTB.237...37T }}&lt;/ref&gt; He predicted [[Chemical clock|oscillating]] [[chemical reaction]]s, in particular the [[Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction]]. These activator-inhibitor mechanisms can, Turing suggested, generate patterns (dubbed "[[Turing pattern]]s") of stripes and spots in animals, and contribute to the spiral patterns seen in plant phyllotaxis.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=163, 247–250}}

In 1968, the Hungarian theoretical biologist [[Aristid Lindenmayer]] (1925–1989) developed the [[L-system]], a [[formal grammar]] which can be used to model [[plant development|plant growth patterns]] in the style of [[fractal]]s.&lt;ref name=L&gt;[[Rozenberg, Grzegorz]]; Salomaa, Arto. ''The Mathematical Theory of L Systems''. [[Academic Press]], New York, 1980. {{isbn|0-12-597140-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; L-systems have an [[alphabet]] of symbols that can be combined using [[Formal grammar|production rules]] to build larger strings of symbols, and a mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric structures. In 1975, after centuries of slow development of the mathematics of patterns by [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[Georg Cantor]], [[Helge von Koch]], [[Wacław Sierpiński]] and others, [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] wrote a famous paper, ''[[How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension]]'', crystallising mathematical thought into the concept of the [[fractal]].&lt;ref name=Mandelbrot/&gt;

==Causes==
[[File:Aphids and live young under Sycamore leaf.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Composite patterns: [[aphids]] and newly born young in arraylike clusters on [[sycamore]] leaf, divided into [[polygon]]s by [[vein (botany)|veins]], which are avoided by the young aphids]]

Living things like [[orchid]]s, [[hummingbird]]s, and the [[Structural coloration|peacock's tail]] have abstract designs with a beauty of form, pattern and colour that artists struggle to match.&lt;ref name=ForbesGuardian&gt;Forbes, Peter. ''All that useless beauty''. The Guardian. Review: Non-fiction. 11 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The beauty that people perceive in nature has causes at different levels, notably in the mathematics that governs what patterns can physically form, and among living things in the effects of natural selection, that govern how patterns evolve.{{sfn|Stevens|1974|page=222}}

[[Mathematics]] seeks to discover and explain abstract patterns or regularities of all kinds.&lt;ref name=Steen&gt;[[Lynn Steen|Steen, L.A.]]. ''The Science of Patterns''. [[Science (journal)|Science]], 240: 611–616, 1998. [http://www.ascd.org/publications/curriculum-handbook/409/chapters/The-Future-of-Mathematics-Education.aspx Summary at ascd.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Devlin&gt;[[Keith Devlin|Devlin, Keith]]. ''Mathematics: The Science of Patterns: The Search for Order in Life, Mind and the Universe'' (Scientific American Paperback Library) 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
Visual patterns in nature find explanations in [[chaos theory]], fractals, logarithmic spirals, topology and other mathematical patterns. For example, [[L-system]]s form convincing models of different patterns of tree growth.&lt;ref name=L/&gt;
[[File:Dragon trees.jpg|thumb|The growth patterns of certain trees resemble these [[L-system|Lindenmayer system]] fractals.]]

The laws of [[physics]] apply the abstractions of mathematics to the real world, often as if it were [[perfection#Physics and chemistry|perfect]]. For example, a [[crystal]] is perfect when it has no structural defects such as dislocations and is fully symmetric. Exact mathematical perfection can only approximate real objects.&lt;ref name=Tatarkiewicz&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz, Władysław]]. ''Perfection in the Sciences. II. Perfection in Physics and Chemistry'', Dialectics and Humanism, vol. VII, no. 2 (spring 1980), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Visible patterns in nature are governed by [[physical law]]s; for example, [[meander]]s can be explained using [[fluid dynamics]].

In [[biology]], [[natural selection]] can cause the development of patterns in living things for several reasons, including [[camouflage]],&lt;ref name=DarwinCh4&gt;[[Charles Darwin|Darwin, Charles]]. ''On the Origin of Species''. 1859, chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[sexual selection]],&lt;ref name=DarwinCh4/&gt; and different kinds of signalling, including [[mimicry]]&lt;ref name=Wickler&gt;{{cite book |last=Wickler |first=Wolfgang |authorlink=Wolfgang Wickler |date=1968 |title=Mimicry in plants and animals |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cleaning symbiosis]].&lt;ref name=PoulinGrutter&gt;Poulin, R.; Grutter, A.S.

''Bioscience'' 46(7): 512–517. {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; In plants, the shapes, colours, and patterns of [[insect pollination|insect-pollinated]] [[flowers]] like the [[Lilium|lily]] have evolved to attract insects such as [[European honey bee|bees]]. Radial patterns of colours and stripes, some visible only in ultraviolet light serve as [[nectar guides]] that can be seen at a distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plantphys.info/plants_human/pollenadapt.shtml | title=Plant Physiology Information Website | publisher=Ross Koning | work=Pollination Adaptations | date=1994 | accessdate=May 2, 2012 | author=Koning, Ross}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of pattern ==

=== Symmetry ===

{{further|Symmetry in biology|Floral symmetry|Crystal symmetry}}

[[Symmetry]] is pervasive in living things. Animals mainly have bilateral or [[Reflection symmetry|mirror symmetry]], as do the leaves of plants and some flowers such as [[orchid]]s.{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=48–49}} Plants often have radial or [[rotational symmetry]], as do many flowers and some groups of animals such as [[sea anemone]]s. Fivefold symmetry is found in the [[echinoderms]], the group that includes [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s, and [[sea lilies]].{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=64–65}}

Among non-living things, [[snowflake]]s have striking [[dihedral symmetry|sixfold symmetry]]; each flake's structure forms a record of the varying conditions during its crystallization, with nearly the same pattern of growth on each of its six arms.{{sfn|Stewart|2001|page=52}} [[Crystal]]s in general have a variety of symmetries and [[crystal habit]]s; they can be cubic or octahedral, but true crystals cannot have fivefold symmetry (unlike [[quasicrystals]]).{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=82–84}} Rotational symmetry is found at different scales among non-living things, including the crown-shaped [[Splash (fluid mechanics)|splash]] pattern formed when a drop falls into a pond,{{sfn|Stewart|2001|page=60}} and both the [[spheroidal]] shape and rings of a [[planet]] like [[Saturn]].{{sfn|Stewart|2001|page=71}}

Symmetry has a variety of causes. Radial symmetry suits organisms like sea anemones whose adults do not move: food and threats may arrive from any direction. But animals that move in one direction necessarily have upper and lower sides, head and tail ends, and therefore a left and a right. The head becomes specialised with a mouth and sense organs ([[cephalisation]]), and the body becomes bilaterally symmetric (though internal organs need not be).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://biocongroup.eu/DA/Calendario_files/Bilateria.pdf | title=Animal Diversity | edition=Third | publisher=McGraw-Hill | work=Chapter 8: Acoelomate Bilateral Animals | date=2002 | accessdate=October 25, 2012 | author=Hickman, Cleveland P. | author2=Roberts, Larry S. | author3=Larson, Allan | pages=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; More puzzling is the reason for the fivefold (pentaradiate) symmetry of the echinoderms. Early echinoderms were bilaterally symmetrical, as their larvae still are. Sumrall and Wray argue that the loss of the old symmetry had both developmental and ecological causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=4500143 | title=Ontogeny in the fossil record: diversification of body plans and the evolution of "aberrant" symmetry in Paleozoic echinoderms | author=Sumrall, Colin D. | author2=Wray, Gregory A. | journal=Paleobiology |date=January 2007 | volume=33 | issue=1 | pages=149–163 |doi=10.1666/06053.1}} &lt;!--http://www.psjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1666/06053.1--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Trees, fractals ===

[[Fractal]]s are infinitely [[self-similarity|self-similar]], iterated mathematical constructs having [[fractal dimension]].&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mandelbrot, Benoît B. | title=The fractal geometry of nature| date=1983 |publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Falconer"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Falconer | first = Kenneth | authorlink=Kenneth Falconer (mathematician) | title = Fractal Geometry: Mathematical Foundations and Applications | publisher = John Wiley | date = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="patterns"&gt;{{Cite book | title=Fractals:The Patterns of Chaos | last=Briggs | first=John | authorlink= |date= 1992|publisher= Thames and Hudson |page=148 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Infinite [[iteration]] is not possible in nature so all 'fractal' patterns are only approximate. For example, the leaves of [[fern]]s and [[umbellifer]]s (Apiaceae) are only self-similar (pinnate) to 2, 3 or 4 levels. Fern-like growth patterns occur in plants and in animals including [[bryozoa]], [[coral]]s, [[hydrozoa]] like the [[air fern]], ''Sertularia argentea'', and in non-living things, notably [[electrical discharge]]s. [[L-system|Lindenmayer system]] fractals can model different patterns of tree growth by varying a small number of parameters including branching angle, distance between nodes or branch points ([[Internode (botany)|internode]] length), and number of branches per branch point.&lt;ref name=L/&gt;

Fractal-like patterns occur widely in nature, in phenomena as diverse as clouds, [[river|river networks]], geologic [[fault line]]s, [[mountain]]s, [[coastline]]s,&lt;ref name=Batty&gt;{{cite journal | journal=New Scientist | date=1985-04-04 | title=Fractals – Geometry Between Dimensions | author=Batty, Michael | page=31 | volume=105 |issue=1450}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[animal coloration]], [[snowflake|snow flakes]],&lt;ref name="snowflake"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=aHux78oQbbkC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=snowflake+fractals+book#v=onepage&amp;q=snowflake%20fractals%20book&amp;f=false | page=25 | author=Meyer, Yves | author2=Roques, Sylvie | title=Progress in wavelet analysis and applications: proceedings of the International Conference "Wavelets and Applications," Toulouse, France – June 1992 | date=1993 | publisher=Atlantica Séguier Frontières| isbn=9782863321300 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[crystal]]s,&lt;ref name="crystal"&gt;{{cite book| page=78 | author=Carbone, Alessandra | author2=Gromov, Mikhael | author3=Prusinkiewicz, Przemyslaw | title=Pattern formation in biology, vision and dynamics | date=2000|publisher=World Scientific | isbn=9789810237929}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[blood vessel]] branching,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Fractal aspects of three-dimensional vascular constructive optimization| author=Hahn, Horst K.| author2=Georg, Manfred| author3=Peitgen, Heinz-Otto | editor=Losa, Gabriele A. | editor2=Nonnenmacher, Theo F.| title=Fractals in biology and medicine | date=2005 | publisher=Springer| pages=55–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[actin cytoskeleton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sadegh|first=Sanaz|date=2017|title=Plasma Membrane is Compartmentalized by a Self-Similar Cortical Actin Meshwork|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevX.7.011031|journal=Physical Review X|volume=7|issue=1|doi=10.1103/PhysRevX.7.011031|pmc=5500227|pmid=28690919}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[wind wave|ocean waves]].&lt;ref name="nature"&gt;{{cite book | pages=44–46 | title=Fractals and chaos: an illustrated course | author=Addison, Paul S. | date=1997 | publisher=CRC Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spirals ===
{{further|phyllotaxis}}

[[Spirals]] are common in plants and in some animals, notably [[molluscs]]. For example, in the [[nautilus]], a cephalopod mollusc, each [[Camera (cephalopod)|chamber]] of its shell is an approximate copy of the next one, scaled by a constant factor and arranged in a [[logarithmic spiral]].&lt;ref&gt;Maor, Eli. ''e: The Story of a Number''. Princeton University Press, 2009.

These arrangements have explanations at different levels – mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology – each individually correct, but all necessary together.{{sfn|Ball|2009|page=13}} Phyllotaxis spirals can be generated mathematically from [[Fibonacci]] ratios: the Fibonacci sequence runs 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... (each subsequent number being the sum of the two preceding ones). For example, when leaves alternate up a stem, one rotation of the spiral touches two leaves, so the pattern or ratio is 1/2. In [[hazel]] the ratio is 1/3; in [[apricot]] it is 2/5; in [[pear]] it is 3/8; in [[almond]] it is 5/13.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to geometry|first=H. S.

=== Chaos, flow, meanders ===

In mathematics, a [[dynamical system]] is chaotic if it is (highly) sensitive to initial conditions (the so-called "[[butterfly effect]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lorenz|first=Edward N. |authorlink=Edward Norton Lorenz |title=Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences |date=March 1963 |volume=20|issue=2 |pages=130–141|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0469%281963%29020%3C0130%3ADNF%3E2.0.CO%3B2 | doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1963)020&lt;0130:DNF&gt;2.0.CO;2| bibcode = 1963JAtS...20..130L}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which requires the mathematical properties of [[topological mixing]] and [[dense set|dense]] [[periodic orbits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Elaydi, Saber N. |title=Discrete Chaos |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC |date=1999 |page=117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside fractals, [[chaos theory]] ranks as an essentially universal influence on patterns in nature. There is a relationship between chaos and fractals—the ''[[strange attractors]]'' in chaotic systems have a [[fractal dimension]].&lt;ref&gt;Ruelle, David. ''Chance and Chaos''. Princeton University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[cellular automata]], simple sets of mathematical rules that generate patterns, have chaotic behaviour, notably [[Stephen Wolfram]]'s [[Rule 30]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, Stephen. ''[[A New Kind of Science]]''. Wolfram Media, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vortex street]]s are zigzagging patterns of whirling [[Vortex|vortices]] created by the unsteady [[flow separation|separation of flow]] of a [[fluid]], most often air or water, over obstructing objects.&lt;ref&gt;von Kármán, Theodore. ''Aerodynamics''. McGraw-Hill (1963): {{isbn|978-0070676022}}. Dover (1994): {{isbn|978-0486434858}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smooth ([[Laminar flow|laminar]]) flow starts to break up when the size of the obstruction or the velocity of the flow become large enough compared to the [[viscosity]] of the fluid.

[[Meander]]s are sinuous bends in rivers or other channels, which form as a fluid, most often water, flows around bends. As soon as the path is slightly curved, the size and curvature of each loop increases as [[helical flow]] drags material like sand and gravel across the river to the inside of the bend. The outside of the loop is left clean and unprotected, so [[erosion]] accelerates, further increasing the meandering in a powerful [[positive feedback loop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jacques | last=Lewalle | title=Lecture Notes in Incompressible Fluid Dynamics: Phenomenology, Concepts and Analytical Tools | chapter=Flow Separation and Secondary Flow: Section 9.1 | url=http://www.ecs.syr.edu/faculty/lewalle/FluidDynamics/fluidsCh9.pdf | date=2006 | location=Syracuse, NY | publisher=Syracuse University | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929075022/http://www.ecs.syr.edu/faculty/lewalle/FluidDynamics/fluidsCh9.pdf | archivedate=2011-09-29 | df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waves, dunes ===

[[Wave]]s are disturbances that carry energy as they move. [[Mechanical wave]]s propagate through a medium – air or water, making it [[Oscillation|oscillate]] as they pass by.&lt;ref&gt;French, A.P. ''Vibrations and Waves''. Nelson Thornes, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wind wave]]s are sea [[surface wave]]s that create the characteristic chaotic pattern of any large body of water, though their statistical behaviour can be predicted with wind wave models.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=H.L. | last=Tolman | contribution=Practical wind wave modeling | title=CBMS Conference Proceedings on Water Waves: Theory and Experiment | date=2008 | location=Howard University, USA, 13–18 May 2008 | publisher=World Scientific Publ. | url=http://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/mmab/papers/tn270/Howard_08.pdf | editor-first=M.F. | editor-last=Mahmood}}&lt;/ref&gt; As waves in water or wind pass over sand, they create patterns of ripples. When winds blow over large bodies of sand, they create [[dune]]s, sometimes in extensive dune fields as in the [[Taklamakan]] desert. Dunes may form a range of patterns including crescents, very long straight lines, stars, domes, parabolas, and longitudinal or seif ('sword') shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/dunes/ | title=Types of Dunes | publisher=USGS | date=29 October 1997 | accessdate=May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barchan]]s or crescent dunes are produced by wind acting on desert sand; the two horns of the crescent and the [[slip face]] point downwind. Sand blows over the upwind face, which stands at about 15 degrees from the horizontal, and falls onto the slip face, where it accumulates up to the [[angle of repose]] of the sand, which is about 35 degrees. When the slip face exceeds the angle of repose, the sand [[avalanche]]s, which is a [[nonlinear]] behaviour: the addition of many small amounts of sand causes nothing much to happen, but then the addition of a further small amount suddenly causes a large amount to avalanche.&lt;ref&gt;Strahler, A. &amp; Archibold, O.W. ''Physical Geography: Science and Systems of the Human Environment''. John Wiley, 4th edition 2008. Page 442.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from this nonlinearity, barchans behave rather like [[soliton|solitary waves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Schwämmle, V. | author2=Herrman, H.J. | title=Solitary wave behaviour of sand dunes| journal=Nature | volume=426 | issue=Dec. 11 | date=2003 | pages=619–620 [https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/426619a Abstract] | doi=10.1038/426619a | pmid=14668849|bibcode = 2003Natur.426..619S }}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bubbles, foam===

A [[soap bubble]] forms a [[sphere]], a [[minimal surface|surface with minimal area]] — the smallest possible surface area for the volume enclosed. Two bubbles together form a more complex shape: the outer surfaces of both bubbles are spherical; these surfaces are joined by a third spherical surface as the smaller bubble bulges slightly into the larger one.{{sfn|Stewart|2001|pages=108–109}}

A [[foam]] is a mass of bubbles; foams of different materials occur in nature. Foams composed of [[soap film]]s obey [[Plateau's laws]], which require three soap films to meet at each edge at 120° and four soap edges to meet at each vertex at the [[tetrahedron|tetrahedral]] angle of about 109.5°. Plateau's laws further require films to be smooth and continuous, and to have a constant [[mean curvature|average curvature]] at every point. For example, a film may remain nearly flat on average by being curved up in one direction (say, left to right) while being curved downwards in another direction (say, front to back).{{sfn|Ball|2009|page=68}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick J. Almgren, Jr.]] and [[Jean E. Taylor]], ''The geometry of soap films and soap bubbles'', Scientific American, vol. 235, pp. 82–93, July 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Structures with minimal surfaces can be used as tents. [[Lord Kelvin]] identified the problem of the most efficient way to pack cells of equal volume as a foam in 1887; his solution uses just one solid, the [[bitruncated cubic honeycomb]] with very slightly curved faces to meet Plateau's laws. No better solution was found until 1993 when Denis Weaire and Robert Phelan proposed the [[Weaire–Phelan structure]]; the [[Beijing National Aquatics Center]] adapted the structure for their outer wall in the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=73–76}}

At the scale of living [[cell (biology)|cells]], foam patterns are common; [[radiolarian]]s, [[sponge]] [[spicule (sponge)|spicule]]s, [[silicoflagellate]] [[exoskeleton]]s and the calcite skeleton of a [[sea urchin]], ''[[Cidaris rugosa]]'', all resemble mineral casts of Plateau foam boundaries.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=96–101}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/indexmag.html?http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/artfeb05/cbdiatoms.html | title=Geometry and Pattern in Nature 3: The holes in radiolarian and diatom tests | publisher=Microscopy-UK | date=February 2005 | accessdate=May 28, 2012 | author=Brodie, Christina}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skeleton of the [[Radiolarian]], ''Aulonia hexagona'', a beautiful marine form drawn by [[Ernst Haeckel]], looks as if it is a sphere composed wholly of hexagons, but this is mathematically impossible. The [[Euler characteristic]] states that for any [[convex polyhedron]], the number of faces plus the number of vertices (corners) equals the number of edges plus two. A result of this formula is that any closed polyhedron of hexagons has to include exactly 12 pentagons, like a [[Euler characteristic#Soccer ball|soccer ball]], [[Buckminster Fuller]] [[geodesic dome]], or [[fullerene]] molecule. This can be visualised by noting that a mesh of hexagons is flat like a sheet of chicken wire, but each pentagon that is added forces the mesh to bend (there are fewer corners, so the mesh is pulled in).{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=51–54}}

=== Tessellations ===
{{main|tessellation}}

[[Tessellation]]s are patterns formed by repeating [[tile]]s all over a flat surface. There are 17 [[wallpaper group]]s of tilings.&lt;ref name=armstrong&gt;{{cite book | last=Armstrong | first=M.A. | title=Groups and Symmetry | date=1988 | publisher=Springer-Verlag | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; While common in art and design, exactly repeating tilings are less easy to find in living things. The cells in the paper nests of social [[wasp]]s, and the wax cells in [[honeycomb]] built by honey bees are well-known examples. Among animals, bony fish, reptiles or the [[pangolin]], or fruits like the [[salak]] are protected by overlapping scales or [[osteoderms]], these form more-or-less exactly repeating units, though often the scales in fact vary continuously in size. Among flowers, the snake's head fritillary, ''[[Fritillaria meleagris]]'', have a tessellated chequerboard pattern on their petals. The structures of [[minerals]] provide good examples of regularly repeating three-dimensional arrays. Despite the hundreds of thousands of known minerals, there are rather few possible types of arrangement of atoms in a [[crystal]], defined by [[crystal structure]], [[crystal system]], and [[point group]]; for example, there are exactly 14 [[Bravais lattices]] for the 7 lattice systems in three-dimensional space.&lt;ref name="Solid State Physics 2010"&gt;Hook, J.R.; Hall, H.E.

=== Cracks ===

[[Fracture|Cracks]] are linear openings that form in materials to relieve [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]]. When an [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] material stretches or shrinks uniformly, it eventually reaches its breaking strength and then fails suddenly in all directions, creating cracks with 120 degree joints, so three cracks meet at a node. Conversely, when an inelastic material fails, straight cracks form to relieve the stress. Further stress in the same direction would then simply open the existing cracks; stress at right angles can create new cracks, at 90 degrees to the old ones. Thus the pattern of cracks indicates whether the material is elastic or not.{{sfn|Stevens|1974|page=207}} In a tough fibrous material like oak tree bark, cracks form to relieve stress as usual, but they do not grow long as their growth is interrupted by bundles of strong elastic fibres. Since each species of tree has its own structure at the levels of cell and of molecules, each has its own pattern of splitting in its bark.{{sfn|Stevens|1974|page=208}}

===Spots, stripes===

Leopards and ladybirds are spotted; angelfish and zebras are striped.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=156–158}} These patterns have an [[evolution]]ary explanation: they have [[Function (biology)|functions]] which increase the chances that the offspring of the patterned animal will survive to reproduce. One function of animal patterns is [[camouflage]];&lt;ref name=DarwinCh4/&gt; for instance, a [[leopard]] that is harder to see catches more prey. Another function is [[Signalling theory|signalling]]&lt;ref name=Wickler/&gt; — for instance, a [[ladybird]] is less likely to be attacked by [[predator]]y birds that hunt by sight, if it has bold warning colours, and is also [[Aposematism|distastefully bitter or poisonous]], or [[Mimicry|mimics]] other distasteful insects. A young bird may see a warning patterned insect like a ladybird and try to eat it, but it will only do this once; very soon it will spit out the bitter insect; the other ladybirds in the area will remain undisturbed. The young leopards and ladybirds, inheriting [[gene]]s that somehow create spottedness, survive. But while these evolutionary and functional arguments explain why these animals need their patterns, they do not explain how the patterns are formed.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=156–158}}

Alan Turing,&lt;ref name=Turing/&gt; and later the mathematical biologist [[James D. Murray|James Murray]],&lt;ref name="Murray2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=James D.|title=Mathematical Biology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K3LmCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA436|date=9 March 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-662-08539-4|pages=436–450}}&lt;/ref&gt; described a mechanism that spontaneously creates spotted or striped patterns: a [[reaction-diffusion]] system.{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=159–167}} The cells of a young organism have genes that can be switched on by a chemical signal, a [[morphogen]], resulting in the growth of a certain type of structure, say a darkly pigmented patch of skin. If the morphogen is present everywhere, the result is an even pigmentation, as in a black leopard. But if it is unevenly distributed, spots or stripes can result. Turing suggested that there could be [[feedback]] control of the production of the morphogen itself. This could cause continuous fluctuations in the amount of morphogen as it diffused around the body. A second mechanism is needed to create [[standing wave]] patterns (to result in spots or stripes): an inhibitor chemical that switches off production of the morphogen, and that itself diffuses through the body more quickly than the morphogen, resulting in an activator-inhibitor scheme. The [[Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction]] is a non-biological example of this kind of scheme, a [[chemical oscillator]].{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=159–167}}

Later research has managed to create convincing models of patterns as diverse as zebra stripes, giraffe blotches, jaguar spots (medium-dark patches surrounded by dark broken rings) and ladybird shell patterns (different geometrical layouts of spots and stripes, see illustrations).{{sfn|Ball|2009|pages=168–180}} [[Richard Prum]]'s activation-inhibition models, developed from Turing's work, use six variables to account for the observed range of nine basic within-feather pigmentation patterns, from the simplest, a central pigment patch, via concentric patches, bars, chevrons, eye spot, pair of central spots, rows of paired spots and an array of dots.{{sfn|Rothenberg|2011|pages=93–95}}&lt;ref name=Prum/&gt;{{rp|6}} More elaborate models simulate complex feather patterns in the guineafowl ''[[Numida meleagris]]'' in which the individual feathers feature transitions from bars at the base to an array of dots at the far (distal) end. These require an oscillation created by two inhibiting signals, with interactions in both space and time.&lt;ref name=Prum&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.yale.edu/eeb/prum/pdf/Prum%20&amp;%20Williamson%202002.pdf | title=Reaction–diffusion models of within-feather pigmentation patterning | author=Prum, Richard O. |author1link=Richard Prum | author2=Williamson, Scott | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B | date=2002 | volume=269 | issue=1493 | pages=781–792 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2001.1896| pmid=11958709 | pmc=1690965 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7–8}}

In permafrost soils with an active upper layer subject to annual freeze and thaw, [[patterned ground]] can form, creating circles, nets, [[ice wedge]] polygons, steps, and stripes. [[Thermal contraction]] causes shrinkage cracks to form; in a thaw, water fills the cracks, expanding to form ice when next frozen, and widening the cracks into wedges. These cracks may join up to form polygons and other shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Permafrost: Patterned Ground |url=http://permafrosttunnel.crrel.usace.army.mil/permafrost/patterned_ground.html |publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers |accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[gyrification|fissured pattern]] that develops on vertebrate brains are caused by a physical process of constrained expansion dependent on two geometric parameters: relative tangential cortical expansion and relative thickness of the [[cerebellar cortex|cortex]]. Similar patterns of [[Gyrus|gyri]] (peaks) and [[Sulcus (neuroanatomy)|sulci]] (troughs) have been demonstrated in models of the brain starting from smooth, layered gels, with the patterns caused by compressive mechanical forces resulting from the expansion of the outer layer (representing the cortex) after the addition of a solvent. Numerical models in computer simulations support natural and experimental observations that the surface folding patterns increase in larger brains.&lt;ref name="Scientific American"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/human-brain-s-bizarre-folding-pattern-re-created-in-a-vat/|last1=Ghose|first1=Tia|title=Human Brain's Bizarre Folding Pattern Re-Created in a Vat|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PNAS"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tallinen|first1=Tuoma|last2=Chung|first2=Jun Young|last3=Biggins|first3= John S.|last4=Mahadevan|first4=L.|title=Gyrification from constrained cortical expansion|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=111|issue=35|pages=12667–12672|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39135">'''Philosophy of space and time''' is the branch of [[philosophy]] concerned with the issues surrounding the [[ontology]], [[epistemology]], and character of [[space]] and [[time]]. While such ideas have been central to philosophy from its inception, the philosophy of space and time was both an inspiration for and a central aspect of early [[analytic philosophy]]. The subject focuses on a number of basic issues, including whether time and space exist independently of the mind, whether they exist independently of one another, what accounts for time's apparently unidirectional flow, whether times other than the present moment exist, and questions about the nature of identity (particularly the nature of identity over time).

==Ancient and medieval views==
The earliest recorded [[Western philosophy]] of [[time]] was expounded by the [[ancient Egypt]]ian thinker [[Ptahhotep]] (c. 2650–2600 BC) who said:

The ''[[Vedas]]'', the earliest texts on [[Indian philosophy]] and [[Hindu philosophy]], dating back to the late [[2nd millennium BC]], describe ancient [[Hindu cosmology]], in which the [[universe]] goes through repeated cycles of creation, destruction, and rebirth, with each cycle lasting 4,320,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cosmology of the Bhagavata Purana: Mysteries of the Sacred Universe |first1=Richard L. |last1=Thompson |publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-81-208-1919-1 |page=225 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3TZmDSr-1msC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=3TZmDSr-1msC&amp;pg=PA225  Extract of page 225]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient philosophy|Ancient]] [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]], including [[Parmenides]] and [[Heraclitus]], wrote essays on the nature of time.&lt;ref&gt;Dagobert Runes, ''Dictionary of Philosophy'', p. 318&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Incas]] regarded space and time as a single concept, named '''pacha''' ({{lang-qu|pacha}}, {{lang-ay|pacha}}).&lt;ref&gt;Atuq Eusebio Manga Qespi, Instituto de lingüística y Cultura Amerindia de la Universidad de Valencia.

Allen, ''Handbook of Inca mythology'', p. 86, ({{ISBN|1-57607-354-8}})&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]], in the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', identified time with the period of motion of the heavenly bodies, and space as that in which things come to be. [[Aristotle]], in Book IV of his ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', defined time as the number of changes with respect to before and after, and the place of an object as the innermost motionless boundary of that which surrounds it.

In Book 11 of [[St. Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine's]] ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'', he ruminates on the nature of time, asking, "What then is time? If no one asks me, I know: if I wish to explain it to one that asketh, I know not." He goes on to comment on the difficulty of thinking about time, pointing out the inaccuracy of common speech: "For but few things are there of which we speak properly; of most things we speak improperly, still the things intended are understood."&lt;ref&gt;St. Augustine, ''Confessions'', Book 11. http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/augconf/aug11.htm (Accessed 19/5/14).&lt;/ref&gt;  But Augustine presented the first philosophical argument for the reality of Creation (against Aristotle) in the context of his discussion of time,  saying that knowledge of time depends on the knowledge of the movement of things,  and therefore time cannot be where there are no creatures to measure its passing (Confessions Book XI ¶30; [[The City of God|City of God]] Book XI ch.6).

In contrast to ancient Greek philosophers who believed that the universe had an infinite past with no beginning, [[Medieval philosophy|medieval philosophers]] and [[Theology|theologians]] developed the concept of the universe having a finite past with a beginning, now known as [[Temporal finitism]]. The [[Christian philosophy|Christian philosopher]] [[John Philoponus]] presented early arguments, adopted by later Christian philosophers and theologians of the form "argument from the impossibility of the existence of an actual infinite", which states:&lt;ref name=Craig&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Whitrow and Popper on the Impossibility of an Infinite Past|first=William Lane|last=Craig|journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science|volume=30|issue=2|date=June 1979|pages=165–170 [165–6]|doi=10.1093/bjps/30.2.165|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"An actual infinite cannot exist."
:"An infinite temporal regress of events is an actual infinite."
:"∴ An infinite temporal regress of events cannot exist."

In the early 11th century, the [[Islamic physics|Muslim physicist]] [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhacen or Alhazen) discussed [[Depth perception|space perception]] and its [[Epistemology|epistemological]] implications in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (1021). He also rejected Aristotle's definition of ''topos'' (''Physics'' IV) by way of geometric demonstrations and defined place as a mathematical spatial extension.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nader El-Bizri]], 'In Defence of the Sovereignty of Philosophy: al-Baghdadi's Critique of Ibn al-Haytham's Geometrisation of Place', ''Arabic Sciences and Philosophy'' 17 (2007), 57–80&lt;/ref&gt; His [[experiment]]al proof of the intro-mission model of vision led to changes in the understanding of the [[visual perception]] of space, contrary to the previous [[Emission theory (vision)|emission theory of vision]] supported by [[Euclid]] and [[Ptolemy]]. In "tying the visual perception of space to prior bodily experience, Alhacen unequivocally rejected the intuitiveness of spatial perception and, therefore, the autonomy of vision. Without tangible notions of distance and size for correlation, sight can tell us next to nothing about such things."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=A.

==Realism and anti-realism==
A traditional [[Philosophical realism|realist]] position in [[ontology]] is that time and space have existence apart from the human mind. [[Idealism|Idealists]], by contrast, deny or doubt the existence of objects independent of the mind. Some [[anti-realism|anti-realists]], whose ontological position is that objects outside the mind do exist, nevertheless doubt the independent existence of time and space.

In 1781, [[Immanuel Kant]] published the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', one of the most influential works in the history of the philosophy of space and time. He describes time as an ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' notion that, together with other ''a priori'' notions such as [[space]], allows us to comprehend [[empirical evidence|sense experience]]. Kant denies that neither space or time are [[Substance theory|substance]], entities in themselves, or learned by experience; he holds, rather, that both are elements of a systematic framework we use to structure our experience. Spatial [[measurement]]s are used to [[quantity|quantify]] how far apart [[Physical body|object]]s are, and temporal measurements are used to quantitatively compare the interval between (or duration of) [[Spacetime#Basic concepts|event]]s. Although space and time are held to be ''transcendentally ideal'' in this sense, they are also ''empirically real''—that is, not mere illusions.

Some idealist writers, such as [[J. M. E. McTaggart]] in ''[[The Unreality of Time]]'', have argued that time is an illusion (see also [[Philosophy of space and time#The flow of time|The flow of time]], below).

The writers discussed here are for the most part realists in this regard; for instance, [[Gottfried Leibniz]] held that his [[monadology|monad]]s existed, at least independently of the mind of the observer.

==Absolutism and relationalism==

===Leibniz and Newton&lt;!--linked from 'Adolf Grünbaum'--&gt;===
The great debate between defining notions of space and time as real objects themselves (absolute), or mere orderings upon actual objects ([[relationalism|relational]]), began between physicists [[Isaac Newton]] (via his spokesman, Samuel Clarke) and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]] in the papers of the [[Leibniz–Clarke correspondence]].

Arguing against the absolutist position, Leibniz offers a number of [[thought experiment]]s with the purpose of showing that there is contradiction in assuming the existence of facts such as absolute location and velocity. These arguments trade heavily on two principles central to his philosophy: the [[principle of sufficient reason]] and the [[identity of indiscernibles]]. The principle of sufficient reason holds that for every fact, there is a reason that is sufficient to explain what and why it is the way it is and not otherwise. The identity of indiscernibles states that if there is no way of telling two entities apart, then they are one and the same thing.

The example Leibniz uses involves two proposed universes situated in absolute space. The only discernible difference between them is that the latter is positioned five feet to the left of the first. The example is only possible if such a thing as absolute space exists. Such a situation, however, is not possible, according to Leibniz, for if it were, a universe's position in absolute space would have no sufficient reason, as it might very well have been anywhere else. Therefore, it contradicts the principle of sufficient reason, and there could exist two distinct universes that were in all ways indiscernible, thus contradicting the identity of indiscernibles.

Standing out in Clarke's (and Newton's) response to Leibniz's arguments is the [[bucket argument]]: Water in a bucket, hung from a rope and set to spin, will start with a flat surface. As the water begins to spin in the bucket, the surface of the water will become concave. If the bucket is stopped, the water will continue to spin, and while the spin continues, the surface will remain concave. The concave surface is apparently not the result of the interaction of the bucket and the water, since the surface is flat when the bucket first starts to spin, it becomes concave as the water starts to spin, and it remains concave as the bucket stops.

In this response, Clarke argues for the necessity of the existence of [[absolute space]] to account for phenomena like rotation and acceleration that cannot be accounted for on a purely [[relationalism|relationalist account]]. Clarke argues that since the curvature of the water occurs in the rotating bucket as well as in the stationary bucket containing spinning water, it can only be explained by stating that the water is rotating in relation to the presence of some third thing—absolute space.

Leibniz describes a space that exists only as a relation between objects, and which has no existence apart from the existence of those objects. Motion exists only as a relation between those objects. Newtonian space provided the absolute frame of reference within which objects can have motion. In Newton's system, the frame of reference exists independently of the objects contained within it. These objects can be described as moving in relation to space itself. For almost two centuries, the evidence of a concave water surface held authority.

===Mach===
Another important figure in this debate is 19th-century physicist [[Ernst Mach]]. While he did not deny the existence of phenomena like that seen in the bucket argument, he still denied the absolutist conclusion by offering a different answer as to what the bucket was rotating in relation to: the [[fixed stars]].

Mach suggested that thought experiments like the bucket argument are problematic. If we were to imagine a universe that only contains a bucket, on Newton's account, this bucket could be set to spin relative to absolute space, and the water it contained would form the characteristic concave surface. But in the absence of anything else in the universe, it would be difficult to confirm that the bucket was indeed spinning. It seems equally possible that the surface of the water in the bucket would remain flat.

Mach argued that, in effect, the water experiment in an otherwise empty universe would remain flat. But if another object were introduced into this universe, perhaps a distant star, there would now be something relative to which the bucket could be seen as rotating. The water inside the bucket could possibly have a slight curve. To account for the curve that we observe, an increase in the number of objects in the universe also increases the curvature in the water. Mach argued that the momentum of an object, whether angular or linear, exists as a result of the sum of the effects of other objects in the universe ([[Mach's Principle]]).

===Einstein===
[[Albert Einstein]] proposed that the laws of physics should be based on the [[principle of relativity]]. This principle holds that the rules of physics must be the same for all observers, regardless of the frame of reference that is used, and that light propagates at the same speed in all reference frames. This theory was motivated by [[Maxwell's equations]], which show that electromagnetic waves propagate in a vacuum at the [[speed of light]]. However, Maxwell's equations give no indication of what this speed is relative to. Prior to Einstein, it was thought that this speed was relative to a fixed medium, called the [[luminiferous ether]]. In contrast, the theory of special relativity postulates that light propagates at the speed of light in all inertial frames, and examines the implications of this postulate.

All attempts to measure any speed relative to this ether failed, which can be seen as a confirmation of Einstein's postulate that light propagates at the same speed in all reference frames. [[Special relativity]] is a formalization of the principle of relativity that does not contain a privileged inertial frame of reference, such as the luminiferous ether or absolute space, from which Einstein inferred that no such frame exists.

Einstein generalized relativity to frames of reference that were non-inertial. He achieved this by positing the [[equivalence principle|Equivalence Principle]], which states that the force felt by an observer in a given gravitational field and that felt by an observer in an accelerating frame of reference are indistinguishable. This led to the conclusion that the mass of an object warps the geometry of the space-time surrounding it, as described in [[Einstein's field equation]]s.

In classical physics, an inertial reference frame is one in which an object that experiences no forces does not accelerate. In general relativity, an inertial frame of reference is one that is following a [[Geodesic (general relativity)|geodesic]] of space-time. An object that moves against a geodesic experiences a force. An object in [[free fall]] does not experience a force, because it is following a geodesic. An object standing on the earth, however, will experience a force, as it is being held against the geodesic by the surface of the planet.

Einstein partially advocates [[Mach's principle]] in that distant stars explain inertia because they provide the gravitational field against which acceleration and inertia occur. But contrary to Leibniz's account, this warped space-time is as integral a part of an object as are its other defining characteristics, such as volume and mass. If one holds, contrary to idealist beliefs, that objects exist independently of the mind, it seems that relativistics commits them to also hold that space and temporality have exactly the same type of independent existence.

==Conventionalism==
The position of conventionalism states that there is no fact of the matter as to the geometry of space and time, but that it is decided by convention. The first proponent of such a view, [[Henri Poincaré]], reacting to the creation of the new [[non-Euclidean geometry]], argued that which geometry applied to a space was decided by convention, since different geometries will describe a set of objects equally well, based on considerations from his [[sphere-world]].

This view was developed and updated to include considerations from relativistic physics by [[Hans Reichenbach]]. Reichenbach's conventionalism, applying to space and time, focuses around the idea of [[coordinative definition]].

Coordinative definition has two major features. The first has to do with coordinating units of length with certain physical objects. This is motivated by the fact that we can never directly apprehend length. Instead we must choose some physical object, say the Standard Metre at the [[Bureau International des Poids et Mesures]] (International Bureau of Weights and Measures), or the [[wavelength]] of [[cadmium]] to stand in as our unit of length. The second feature deals with separated objects. Although we can, presumably, directly test the equality of length of two measuring rods when they are next to one another, we can not find out as much for two rods distant from one another. Even supposing that two rods, whenever brought near to one another are seen to be equal in length, we are not justified in stating that they are always equal in length. This impossibility undermines our ability to decide the equality of length of two distant objects. Sameness of length, to the contrary, must be set by definition.

Such a use of coordinative definition is in effect, on Reichenbach's conventionalism, in the General Theory of Relativity where light is assumed, i.e. not discovered, to mark out equal distances in equal times. After this setting of coordinative definition, however, the geometry of spacetime is set.

As in the absolutism/relationalism debate, contemporary philosophy is still in disagreement as to the correctness of the conventionalist doctrine.

==Structure of space-time==
{{unreferenced|section (and every subsection)|date=August 2018}}
Building from a mix of insights from the historical debates of absolutism and conventionalism as well as reflecting on the import of the technical apparatus of the General Theory of Relativity, details as to the structure of [[spacetime|space-time]] have made up a large proportion of discussion within the philosophy of space and time, as well as the [[philosophy of physics]]. The following is a short list of topics.

===Relativity of simultaneity===
According to [[special relativity]] each point in the universe can have a different set of events that compose its present instant. This has been used in the [[Rietdijk–Putnam argument]] to demonstrate that relativity predicts a [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|block universe]] in which events are fixed in four dimensions.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Invariance vs. covariance===
Bringing to bear the lessons of the absolutism/relationalism debate with the powerful mathematical tools invented in the 19th and 20th century, [[Michael Friedman (philosopher)|Michael Friedman]] draws a distinction between invariance upon mathematical [[Transformation (mathematics)|transformation]] and covariance upon transformation.

Invariance, or symmetry, applies to ''objects'', i.e. the [[symmetry group]] of a space-time theory designates what features of objects are invariant, or absolute, and which are dynamical, or variable.

Covariance applies to ''formulations'' of theories, i.e. the [[Group (mathematics)|covariance group]] designates in which range of [[coordinate system]]s the laws of physics hold.

This distinction can be illustrated by revisiting Leibniz's thought experiment, in which the universe is shifted over five feet. In this example the position of an object is seen not to be a property of that object, i.e. location is not invariant. Similarly, the covariance group for [[classical mechanics]] will be any coordinate systems that are obtained from one another by shifts in position as well as other translations allowed by a [[Galilean transformation]].

In the classical case, the invariance, or symmetry, group and the covariance group coincide, but they part ways in relativistic physics. The symmetry group of the general theory of relativity includes all differentiable transformations, i.e., all properties of an object are dynamical, in other words there are no absolute objects. The formulations of the general theory of relativity, unlike those of classical mechanics, do not share a standard, i.e., there is no single formulation paired with transformations. As such the covariance group of the general theory of relativity is just the covariance group of every theory.

===Historical frameworks===
A further application of the modern mathematical methods, in league with the idea of invariance and covariance groups, is to try to interpret historical views of space and time in modern, mathematical language.

In these translations, a theory of space and time is seen as a [[manifold]] paired with [[vector spaces]], the more vector spaces the more facts there are about objects in that theory. The historical development of spacetime theories is generally seen to start from a position where many facts about objects are incorporated in that theory, and as history progresses, more and more structure is removed.

For example, Aristotelian space and time has both absolute position and special places, such as the center of the cosmos, and the circumference. Newtonian space and time has absolute position and is [[Galilean invariance|Galilean invariant]], but does not have special positions.

===Holes===
With the general theory of relativity, the traditional debate between absolutism and relationalism has been shifted to whether spacetime is a substance, since the general theory of relativity largely rules out the existence of, e.g., absolute positions. One powerful argument against spacetime [[substantivalism]], offered by [[John Earman]] is known as the "[[hole argument]]".

This is a technical mathematical argument but can be paraphrased as follows:

Define a function ''d'' as the [[identity function]] over all elements over the manifold M, excepting a small [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] H belonging to M. Over H ''d'' comes to differ from identity by a [[smooth function]].

With use of this function ''d'' we can construct two [[mathematical model]]s, where the second is generated by applying ''d'' to proper elements of the first, such that the two models are identical prior to the time ''t''=0, where ''t'' is a time function created by a [[foliation]] of spacetime, but differ after ''t''=0.

These considerations show that, since substantivalism allows the construction of holes, that the universe must, on that view, be indeterministic. Which, Earman argues, is a case against substantivalism, as the case between determinism or indeterminism should be a question of physics, not of our commitment to substantivalism.

==Direction of time==
The problem of the [[Arrow of time|direction of time]] arises directly from two contradictory facts. Firstly, the fundamental physical laws are time-reversal [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]]; if a cinematographic film were taken of any process describable by means of the aforementioned laws and then played backwards, it would still portray a physically possible process. Secondly, our experience of time, at the [[macroscopic]] level, is ''not'' time-reversal invariant.&lt;ref&gt;Borchert, D.M. (2006) Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2nd Ed. Vol. 9. MI: Cengage Learning. P. 468.&lt;/ref&gt; Glasses can fall and break, but shards of glass cannot reassemble and fly up onto tables. We have memories of the past, and none of the future. We feel we can't change the past but can influence the future.

===Causation solution===
One solution to this problem takes a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] view, in which the direction of time follows from an asymmetry of [[Causality|causation]]. We know more about the past because the elements of the past are causes for the effect that is our perception. We feel we can't affect the past and can affect the future because we ''can't'' affect the past and ''can'' affect the future.

There are two main objections to this view. First is the problem of distinguishing the cause from the effect in a non-arbitrary way. The use of causation in constructing a temporal ordering could easily become circular. The second problem with this view is its explanatory power. While the causation account, if successful, may account for some time-asymmetric phenomena like perception and action, it does not account for many others.

However, asymmetry of causation can be observed in a non-arbitrary way which is not metaphysical in the case of a human hand dropping a cup of water which smashes into fragments on a hard floor, spilling the liquid. In this order, the causes of the resultant pattern of cup fragments and water spill is easily attributable in terms of the trajectory of the cup, irregularities in its structure, angle of its impact on the floor, etc. However, applying the same event in reverse, it is difficult to explain why the various pieces of the cup should fly up into the human hand and reassemble precisely into the shape of a cup, or why the water should position itself entirely within the cup. The causes of the resultant structure and shape of the cup and the encapsulation of the water by the hand within the cup are not easily attributable, as neither hand nor floor can achieve such formations of the cup or water. This asymmetry is perceivable on account of two features: i) the relationship between the agent capacities of the human hand (i.e., what it is and is not capable of and what it is for) and non-animal agency (i.e., what floors are and are not capable of and what they are for) and ii) that the pieces of cup came to possess exactly the nature and number of those of a cup before assembling. In short, such asymmetry is attributable to the relationship between i) temporal direction and ii) the implications of form and functional capacity.

The application of these ideas of form and functional capacity only dictates temporal direction in relation to complex scenarios involving specific, non-metaphysical agency which is not merely dependent on human perception of time. However, this last observation in itself is not sufficient to invalidate the implications of the example for the progressive nature of time in general.

===Thermodynamics solution===
The second major family of solutions to this problem, and by far the one that has generated the most literature, finds the existence of the direction of time as relating to the nature of thermodynamics.

The answer from classical [[thermodynamics]] states that while our basic physical theory is, in fact, time-reversal symmetric, thermodynamics is not. In particular, the [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that the net [[entropy]] of a closed system never decreases, and this explains why we often see glass breaking, but not coming back together.

But in [[statistical mechanics]] things become more complicated. On one hand, statistical mechanics is far superior to classical thermodynamics, in that thermodynamic behavior, such as glass breaking, can be explained by the fundamental laws of physics paired with a [[statistical]] postulate. But statistical mechanics, unlike classical thermodynamics, is time-reversal symmetric. The second law of thermodynamics, as it arises in statistical mechanics, merely states that it is ''overwhelmingly'' likely that net entropy will increase, but it is not an absolute law.

Current thermodynamic solutions to the problem of the direction of time aim to find some further fact, or feature of the laws of nature to account for this discrepancy.

===Laws solution===
A third type of solution to the problem of the direction of time, although much less represented, argues that the laws are not time-reversal symmetric. For example, certain processes in [[quantum mechanics]], relating to the [[weak nuclear force]], are not time-reversible, keeping in mind that when dealing with quantum mechanics time-reversibility comprises a more complex definition. But this type of solution is insufficient because 1) the time-asymmetric phenomena in quantum mechanics are too few to account for the uniformity of macroscopic time-asymmetry and 2) it relies on the assumption that quantum mechanics is the final or correct description of physical processes.{{citation needed |date=April 2012}}

One recent proponent of the laws solution is [[Tim Maudlin]] who argues that the fundamental laws of physics are laws of temporal evolution (see Maudlin [2007]). However, elsewhere Maudlin argues: "[the] passage of time is an intrinsic asymmetry in the temporal structure of the world... It is the asymmetry that grounds the distinction between sequences that runs from past to future and sequences which run from future to past" [ibid, 2010 edition, p.&amp;nbsp;108]. Thus it is arguably difficult to assess whether Maudlin is suggesting that the direction of time is a consequence of the laws or is itself primitive.

==Flow of time==
The problem of the flow of time, as it has been treated in analytic philosophy, owes its beginning to a paper written by [[J. M. E. McTaggart]], in which he proposes two "temporal series". The first series, which means to account for our intuitions about temporal becoming, or the moving Now, is called the [[A-series and B-series|A-series]]. The A-series orders events according to their being in the past, present or future, ''simpliciter'' and in comparison to each other. The [[A-series and B-series|B-series]] eliminates all reference to the present, and the associated temporal modalities of past and future, and orders all events by the temporal relations ''earlier than'' and ''later than''.

McTaggart, in his paper "[[The Unreality of Time]]", argues that time is unreal since a) the A-series is inconsistent and b) the B-series alone cannot account for the nature of time as the A-series describes an essential feature of it.

Building from this framework, two camps of solution have been offered. The first, the A-theorist solution, takes becoming as the central feature of time, and tries to construct the B-series from the A-series by offering an account of how B-facts come to be out of A-facts. The second camp, the B-theorist solution, takes as decisive McTaggart's arguments against the A-series and tries to construct the A-series out of the B-series, for example, by temporal indexicals.

== Dualities ==
{{expand section|date=May 2016}}
[[Quantum field theory]] models have shown that it is possible for theories in two different space-time backgrounds, like [[AdS/CFT]] or [[T-duality]], to be equivalent.

==Presentism and eternalism==
{{Main|Presentism (philosophy of time)|Eternalism (philosophy of time)}}
According to [[Presentism (philosophy of time)|Presentism]], time is an ordering of various [[reality|realities]]. At a certain time some things exist and others do not. This is the only reality we can deal with and we cannot for example say that [[Homer]] exists because at the present time he does not. An [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|Eternalist]], on the other hand, holds that time is a dimension of reality on a par with the three spatial dimensions, and hence that all things&amp;mdash;past, present and future&amp;mdash;can be said to be just as real as things in the present. According to this theory, then, Homer really ''does'' exist, though we must still use special language when talking about somebody who exists at a distant time&amp;mdash;just as we would use special language when talking about something far away (the very words ''near'', ''far'', ''above'', ''below'', and such are directly comparable to phrases such as ''in the past'', ''a minute ago'', and so on).

==Endurantism and perdurantism==
{{Main|Endurantism|Perdurantism}}
The positions on the persistence of objects are somewhat similar. An [[endurantism|endurantist]] holds that for an object to persist through time is for it to exist completely at different times (each instance of existence we can regard as somehow separate from previous and future instances, though still numerically identical with them). A [[perdurantism|perdurantist]] on the other hand holds that for a thing to exist through time is for it to exist as a continuous reality, and that when we consider the thing as a whole we must consider an aggregate of all its "[[temporal part]]s" or instances of existing. Endurantism is seen as the conventional view and flows out of our pre-philosophical ideas (when I talk to somebody I think I am talking to that person as a complete object, and not just a part of a cross-temporal being), but perdurantists such as [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]] have attacked this position. They argue that perdurantism is the superior view for its ability to take account of change in objects.

On the whole, [[Presentism (philosophy of time)|Presentists]] are also endurantists and [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|Eternalists]] are also perdurantists (and vice versa), but this is not a necessary relation and it is possible to claim, for instance, that time's passage indicates a series of ordered realities, but that objects within these realities somehow exist outside of the reality as a whole, even though the realities as wholes are not related. However, such positions are rarely adopted.

The '''relational theory of space''' is a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] theory according to which [[space]] is composed of relations between objects, with the implication that it cannot exist in the absence of matter. Its opposite is the [[container space|container]] theory. A [[theory of relativity|relativistic]] [[physics|physical]] theory implies a [[relation (philosophy)|relational metaphysics]], but not the other way round: even if space is composed of nothing but relations between [[observer (relativity)|observer]]s and [[event (relativity)|event]]s, it would be conceptually possible for all observers to agree on their measurements, whereas relativity implies they will disagree. [[Newtonian physics]] can be cast in [[Galilean invariance|relational terms]], but Newton insisted, for philosophical reasons, on [[Absolute time and space|absolute]] (container) space. The subject was famously debated by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] and a supporter of Newton's in the [[Leibniz–Clarke correspondence]].

An absolute approach can also be applied to [[time]], with, for instance, the implication that there might have been vast epochs of time before the first [[event (philosophy)|event]].&lt;ref&gt;''Physics and Metaphysics: Theories of Space and Time'' by Jennifer Trusted, Routledge, 1991 {{ISBN|0-415-05948-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3245">'''Energy statistics''' refers to collecting, compiling, analyzing and disseminating data on commodities such as [[coal]], [[crude oil]], [[natural gas]], [[electricity]], or renewable energy sources ([[biomass]], [[geothermal power|geothermal]], [[wind power|wind]] or [[solar power|solar energy]]), when they are used for the energy they contain. [[Energy]] is the capability of some substances, resulting from their physico-chemical properties, to do [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] or produce [[heat]]. Some energy commodities, called [[fuels]], release their [[energy content]] as heat when they [[combustion|burn]]. This heat could be used to run an [[Internal combustion engine|internal]] or [[external combustion engine]].

The need to have [[statistics]] on energy commodities became obvious during the [[1973 oil crisis]] that brought tenfold increase in [[petroleum prices]]. Before the crisis, to have accurate data on global energy supply and demand was not deemed critical. Another concern of energy statistics today is a huge gap in energy use between [[developed country|developed]] and [[developing country|developing]] countries. As the gap narrows (''see picture''), the pressure on energy supply increases tremendously.[[Image:Global energy consumption.jpg|thumb|right|525px|Global energy consumption per capita, 1950-2004]] 

The data on energy and electricity come from three principal sources:
* [[Energy industry]]
* Other industries ("self-producers")
* Consumers
The flows of and trade in energy commodities are measured both in physical units (e.g., [[metric ton]]s), and, when [[Energy accounting|energy balances]] are calculated, in energy units (e.g., [[terajoule]]s or [[Ton of oil equivalent|tons of oil equivalent]]). What makes energy statistics specific and different from other fields of [[economic statistics]] is the fact that energy commodities undergo greater number of transformations (flows) than other commodities. In these transformations energy is conserved, as defined by and within the limitations of the [[First law of thermodynamics|first]] and [[second law of thermodynamics|second]] laws of thermodynamics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1050">The '''streaming vibration current''' ('''SVI''') and the associated '''streaming vibration potential''' is an [[electric]] signal that arises when an [[acoustic wave]] propagates through a porous body in which the pores are filled with fluid.

Streaming vibration current was experimentally observed in 1948 by M. Williams.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, M. "An Electrokinetic Transducer" The review of scientific instruments, 19, 10, 640–646, 1948&lt;/ref&gt; A theoretical model was developed some 30 years later by Dukhin and coworkers.&lt;ref&gt;Dukhin, S.S., Mischuk, N.A., Kuz’menko, B.B and Il’in, B.I. "Flow current and potential in a high-frequency acoustic field" Colloid J., 45, 5, 875–881,1983&lt;/ref&gt; This effect opens another possibility for characterizing the electric properties of the surfaces in porous bodies.

There is no formal definition for the '''water-energy nexus''' - the concept refers to the relationship between the [[water]] used for [[energy production]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Spang, E. S., Moomaw, W. R., Gallagher, K. S., Kirshen, P. H., and Marks, D. H. (2014). "The water consumption of energy production: an international comparison." ''Environmental Research Letters'', 9(10), 105002.&lt;/ref&gt; including both [[electricity]] and sources of fuel such as [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]], and the energy consumed to extract, purify, deliver, heat/cool, treat and dispose of water (and wastewater) sometimes referred to as the [[energy intensity]] (EI). The relationship is not truly a closed loop as the water used for energy production need not be the same water that is processed using that energy, but all forms of energy production require some input of water making the relationship inextricable.

Among the first studies to evaluate the water and energy relationship was a [[life-cycle analysis]] conducted by [[Peter Gleick]] in 1994 that highlighted the interdependence and initiated the joint study of water and energy.&lt;ref&gt;Gleick, P. H. (1994). "Water and Energy." ''Annual Review of Energy and the Environment'', 19(1), 267-299.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the [[US Department of Energy]] (DOE) released their report on the water-energy nexus citing the need for joint water-energy policies and better understanding of the nexus and its susceptibility to [[climate change]] as a matter of [[national security]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Bauer, D., Philbrick, M., and Vallario, B. (2014). "The Water-Energy Nexus: Challenges and Opportunities." U.S. Department of Energy.&lt;/ref&gt; The hybrid Sankey diagram in the DOE's 2014 water-energy nexus report summarizes water and [[energy flow (ecology)|energy flows]] in the US by sector, demonstrating [[interdependence]] as well as singling out [[Electric power|thermoelectric power]] as the single largest user of water, used mainly for cooling. 

==  Water Used for Energy Production ==
[[File:Spang-2014-The water consumption of energy production.tif|thumb|486x486px|Figure 1. Total WCEP by energy category, 2008]]
All types of energy generation consume water either to process the raw materials used in the facility, constructing and maintaining the plant, or to just generate the electricity itself. Renewable power sources such as [[Photovoltaic solar cell|photovoltaic solar]] and [[wind power]], which require little water to produce energy, require water in processing the raw materials to build. Water can either be ''used'' or ''consumed,'' and can be categorised as fresh, ground, surface, blue, grey or green among others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Water is considered used if it does not reduce the supply of water to downstream users, i.e. water that is taken and returned to the same source (instream use), such as in thermoelectric plants that use water for cooling and are by far the largest users of water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While used water is returned to the system for downstream uses, it has usually been degraded in some way, mainly due to thermal or chemical pollution, and the natural flow has been altered which does not factor into an assessment if only the quantity of water is considered. Water is consumed when it is removed completely from the system, such as by evaporation or consumption by crops or humans. When assessing water use all these factors must be considered as well as spatiotemporal considerations making precise determination of water use very difficult.

Spang et al. (2014) conducted a study looking at the water consumption for energy production (WCEP) internationally that both showed the variation in energy types produced across countries as well as the vast differences in efficiency of energy production per unit of water use (figure 1).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Operations of water distribution systems and power distribution systems under emergency conditions of limited power and water availability is an important consideration for improving the overall resilience of the water - energy nexus. Khatavkar and Mays (2017) &lt;ref&gt; Khatavkar, P., &amp; Mays, L. W. (2017 a) Model for the Real-Time Operation of Water Distribution Systems under Limited Power Availability. In World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2017 (pp. 171-183). &lt;/ref&gt; present a methodology for control of water distribution and power distribution systems under emergency conditions of drought and limited power availability to ascertain at least minimal supply of cooling water to the power plants.

In Congress on Technical Advancement 2017 (pp. 1-9).&lt;/ref&gt; applied an optimization model for water - energy nexus system for a hypothetical regional level system which showed an improved resilience for several contingency scenarios.

== Energy Intensity ==

=== US (California) ===
In 2001 operating water systems in the US consumed approximately 3% of the total annual electricity (~75 TWh).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Cohen, R., Nelson, B., and Wolff, G. (2004). "Energy Down The Drain: The Hidden Costs of California’s Water Supply." E. Cousins, ed., Natural Resources Defense Council&lt;/ref&gt; The California's [[State Water Project]] (SWP) and [[Central Valley Project]] (CVP) are together the largest water system in the world with the highest water lift, over 2000&amp;nbsp;ft. across the [[Tehachapi mountains]], delivering water from the wetter and relatively rural north of the state, to the [[agricultural]]ly intensive central valley, and finally to the [[arid]] and heavily populated south. Consequently, the SWP and CVP are the single largest consumers of electricity in California consuming approximately 5 TWh of electricity each per year.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2001, 19% of the state’s total electricity use (~48 TWh/year) was used in processing water including end uses, with the urban sector accounting for 65% of this.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Klein, G., Krebs, M., Hall, V., O’Brien, T., and Blevins, B. B. (2005). "California's Water – Energy Relationship." California Energy Commission, Sacramento, California.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to electricity, 30% of California’s natural gas consumption was due to water-related processes, mainly residential water heating, and 88 million gallons of diesel was consumed by groundwater pumps for agriculture.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The residential sector alone accounted for 48% of the total combined electricity and natural gas consumed for water-related processes in the state.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

According to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) Energy Division’s Embedded Energy in Water Studies report:&lt;blockquote&gt;''“'[[Energy Intensity]]' refers to the average amount of energy needed to transport or treat water or wastewater on a per unit basis"''&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Energy Intensity is sometimes used synonymously with embedded or [[embodied energy]]. In 2005, water deliveries to Southern California were assessed to have an average EI of 12.7 MWh/MG, nearly two-thirds of which was due to transportation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Following the findings that a fifth of California’s electricity is consumed in water-related processes including end-use,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; the CPUC responded by authorising a statewide study into the relationship between energy and water that was conducted by the California Institute for Energy and Environment (CIEE), and developed programs to save energy through water conservation.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Bennett, B., and Park, L. (2010). "Embedded Energy in Water Studies Study 1: Statewide and Regional Water-Energy Relationship." California Public Utilities Commission Energy Division.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, B., and Park, L. (2010). "Embedded Energy in Water Studies Study 2: Water Agency and Function Component Study and Embedded Energy- Water Load Profiles." California Public Utilities Commission Energy Division.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hydroelectricity ==
[[Hydroelectricity]] is a special case of water used for energy production mainly because hydroelectric power generation is regarded as being clean and [[renewable]], and dams (the main source of hydroelectric production) serve multiple purposes besides energy generation, including flood prevention, storage, control and recreation which make justifiable allocation analyses difficult.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, the impacts of hydroelectric power generation can be hard to quantify both in terms of evaporative consumptive losses and altered quality of water, since damming results in flows that are much colder than for flowing streams. In some cases the moderation of flows can be seen as a rivalry of water use in time may also need to accounted for in impact analysis.

 --&gt;{{General relativity sidebar |phenomena}}

A '''wormhole''' (or '''Einstein–Rosen bridge''') is a speculative structure linking separate points in [[spacetime]], and is based on a [[Solutions of the Einstein field equations|solution of the Einstein field equations]]. A wormhole can be visualized as a tunnel with two ends, each at separate points in spacetime (i.e., different locations or different points of time). More precisely it is a transcendental bijection of the spacetime continuum, an asymptotic projection of the [[Calabi–Yau]] manifold manifesting itself in [[Anti-de Sitter space]]. 

Wormholes are consistent with the [[general theory of relativity]], but whether wormholes actually exist remains to be seen.

A wormhole could connect extremely long distances such as a billion [[light year]]s or more, short distances such as a few [[meter]]s, different [[multiverse|universes]], or different points in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1998-08-03|title=Focus: Wormhole Construction: Proceed with Caution|url=https://physics.aps.org/story/v2/st7|journal=Physics|language=en-US|volume=2|pages=|via=American Physical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Visualization ==
[[File:Wormhole-demo.png|thumb|Wormhole visualized]]
For a simplified notion of a wormhole, [[space]] can be visualized as a two-dimensional (2D) surface. In this case, a wormhole would appear as a hole in that surface, lead into a [[Three-dimensional space (mathematics)|3D]] tube (the inside surface of a [[cylinder]]), then re-emerge at another location on the 2D surface with a hole similar to the entrance. An actual wormhole would be analogous to this, but with the spatial dimensions raised by one. For example, instead of circular holes on a [[2D plane]], the entry and exit points could be visualized as spheres in [[3D space]].

Another way to imagine wormholes is to take a sheet of paper and draw two somewhat distant points on one side of the paper. The sheet of paper represents a plane in the [[Spacetime|spacetime continuum]], and the two points represent a distance to be traveled, however theoretically a wormhole could connect these two points by folding that plane so the points are touching. In this way it would be much easier to traverse the distance since the two points are now touching.


== Terminology ==
In 1928, [[Hermann Weyl]] proposed a wormhole hypothesis of matter in connection with mass analysis of [[electromagnetic field]] energy;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weyl | first1 = H. | title = Feld und Materie | doi = 10.1002/andp.19213701405 | journal = Annalen der Physik | volume = 65 | issue = 14| year = 1921 | pages=541–563| bibcode = 1921AnP...370..541W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scholz, Erhard  (ed.), ''Hermann Weyl's Raum - Zeit - Materie and a General Introduction to His Scientific Work'', 2001, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; however, he did not use the term "wormhole" (he spoke of "one-dimensional tubes" instead).&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weyl/ "Hermann Weyl"]: entry in the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

American [[theoretical physicist]] [[John Archibald Wheeler]] (inspired by Weyl's work)&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt; coined the term "wormhole" in a 1957 paper co-authored by [[Charles Misner]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Misner | first1 = C. W. | last2 = Wheeler | first2 = J. A. | title = Classical physics as geometry | doi = 10.1016/0003-4916(57)90049-0 | journal = Ann. Phys. | volume = 2 | issue = 6 | page = 525| year = 1957 | bibcode = 1957AnPhy...2..525M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|This analysis forces one to consider situations... where there is a net flux of lines of force, through what [[topologist]]s would call "a [[Handle decomposition|handle]]" of the multiply-connected space, and what physicists might perhaps be excused for more vividly terming a "wormhole".|Charles Misner and John Wheeler in ''[[Annals of Physics]]''}}

=== Modern definitions ===
Wormholes have been defined both [[Geometry and topology|''geometrically'' and ''topologically'']].{{elucidate|are these definitions equivalent?|date=March 2017}} From a topological point of view, an intra-universe wormhole (a wormhole between two points in the same universe) is a [[Compact space|compact]] region of spacetime whose boundary is topologically trivial, but whose interior is not [[simply connected]]. Formalizing this idea leads to definitions such as the following, taken from [[Matt Visser]]'s ''Lorentzian Wormholes'' (1996).&lt;ref name="Visser1996" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2018}}

{{quote|If a [[Minkowski space]]time contains a compact region Ω, and if the topology of Ω is of the form Ω ~ R × Σ, where Σ is a three-manifold of the nontrivial topology, whose boundary has topology of the form ∂Σ ~ S&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and if, furthermore, the [[hypersurface]]s Σ are all spacelike, then the region Ω contains a quasipermanent intrauniverse wormhole.}}

Geometrically, wormholes can be described as regions of spacetime that constrain the incremental deformation of closed surfaces. For example, in Enrico Rodrigo's ''The Physics of Stargates, ''a wormhole is defined informally as: {{quote|a region of spacetime containing a "[[world tube]]" (the time evolution of a closed surface) that cannot be continuously deformed (shrunk) to a [[world line]] (the time evolution of a point).}}

=== Schwarzschild wormholes&lt;!--'Lorentzian wormhole', 'Lorentzian wormholes', 'Schwarzschild wormhole', 'Lorentzian wormholes', 'Euclidean wormhole', 'Euclidean wormholes', 'Einstein–Rosen bridge', 'Einstein–Rosen bridges', 'Einstein-Rosen bridge', 'Einstein-Rosen bridges', and 'Eternal black hole' redirect here--&gt; ===
The equations of the theory of [[general relativity]] have valid solutions that contain wormholes. The first type of wormhole solution discovered was the ''Schwarzschild wormhole''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;,&lt;ref name=Dobrev&gt;Vladimir Dobrev (ed.), ''Lie Theory and Its Applications in Physics: Varna, Bulgaria, June 2015'', Springer, 2016, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; which would be present in the [[Schwarzschild metric]] describing an ''eternal black hole'', but it was found that it would collapse too quickly for anything to cross from one end to the other. Wormholes that could be crossed in both directions, known as [[Wormhole#Traversable wormholes|traversable wormholes]], would only be possible if [[exotic matter]] with negative [[energy density]] could be used to stabilize them.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

[[File:FY221c15.png|thumb|An artist's impression of a wormhole from an observer's perspective, crossing the [[event horizon]] of a Schwarzschild wormhole that bridges two different universes. The observer originates from the right, and another universe becomes visible in the center of the wormhole's shadow once the horizon is crossed, the observer seeing light that has fallen into the [[black hole]] interior region from the other universe; however, this other universe is unreachable in the case of a Schwarzschild wormhole, as the bridge always collapses before the observer has time to cross it, and everything that has fallen through the event horizon of either universe is inevitably crushed in the [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]].]]

Schwarzschild wormholes, also known as ''Einstein–Rosen bridges''&lt;ref name=Dobrev/&gt; (named after [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Nathan Rosen]]),&lt;ref name=ER/&gt; are connections between areas of space that can be modeled as [[vacuum solution]]s to the [[Einstein field equations]], and that are now understood to be intrinsic parts of the [[Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates#The maximally extended Schwarzschild solution|maximally extended]] version of the [[Schwarzschild metric]] describing an eternal black hole with no charge and no rotation. Here, "maximally extended" refers to the idea that the [[spacetime]] should not have any "edges": it should be possible to continue this path arbitrarily far into the particle's future or past for any possible trajectory of a free-falling particle (following a [[geodesic]] in the spacetime).

In order to satisfy this requirement, it turns out that in addition to the black hole interior region that particles enter when they fall through the [[event horizon]] from the outside, there must be a separate [[white hole]] interior region that allows us to extrapolate the trajectories of particles that an outside observer sees rising up ''away'' from the event horizon. And just as there are two separate interior regions of the maximally extended spacetime, there are also two separate exterior regions, sometimes called two different "universes", with the second universe allowing us to extrapolate some possible particle trajectories in the two interior regions. This means that the interior black hole region can contain a mix of particles that fell in from either universe (and thus an observer who fell in from one universe might be able to see light that fell in from the other one), and likewise particles from the interior white hole region can escape into either universe. All four regions can be seen in a spacetime diagram that uses [[Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates]].

In this spacetime, it is possible to come up with [[coordinate system]]s such that if a [[hypersurface]] of constant time (a set of points that all have the same time coordinate, such that every point on the surface has a [[space-like]] separation, giving what is called a 'space-like surface') is picked and an "embedding diagram" drawn depicting the curvature of space at that time, the embedding diagram will look like a tube connecting the two exterior regions, known as an "Einstein&amp;ndash;Rosen bridge". Note that the Schwarzschild metric describes an idealized black hole that exists eternally from the perspective of external observers; a more realistic black hole that forms at some particular time from a collapsing star would require a different metric. When the infalling stellar matter is added to a diagram of a black hole's history, it removes the part of the diagram corresponding to the white hole interior region, along with the part of the diagram corresponding to the other universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/collapse.html#kruskal |title=Collapse to a Black Hole |publisher=Casa.colorado.edu |date=2010-10-03 |accessdate=2010-11-11}}{{tertiary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Einstein&amp;ndash;Rosen bridge was discovered by [[Ludwig Flamm]] in 1916,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flamm|title=Beiträge zur Einsteinschen Gravitationstheorie|date=1916|journal=[[Physikalische Zeitschrift]]|volume=XVII|page=448}} ("Comments on Einstein's Theory of Gravity")&lt;/ref&gt; a few months after Schwarzschild published his solution, and was rediscovered by Albert Einstein and his colleague Nathan Rosen, who published their result in 1935.&lt;ref name=ER&gt;A.

According to general relativity, the [[gravitational collapse]] of a sufficiently compact mass forms a singular Schwarzschild black hole. In the [[Einstein–Cartan theory|Einstein–Cartan]]–Sciama–Kibble theory of gravity, however, it forms a regular Einstein–Rosen bridge. This theory extends general relativity by removing a constraint of the symmetry of the [[affine connection]] and regarding its antisymmetric part, the [[torsion tensor]], as a dynamical variable. Torsion naturally accounts for the quantum-mechanical, intrinsic angular momentum ([[spin (physics)|spin]]) of matter. The minimal coupling between torsion and [[Dirac spinor]]s generates a repulsive spin–spin interaction that is significant in fermionic matter at extremely high densities. Such an interaction prevents the formation of a gravitational singularity.{{clarify|date=April 2015}} Instead, the collapsing matter reaches an enormous but finite density and rebounds, forming the other side of the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Poplawski, Nikodem J. |authorlink=Nikodem Popławski |year=2010 |title=Cosmology with torsion: An alternative to cosmic inflation |journal=Phys.

Although Schwarzschild wormholes are not traversable in both directions, their existence inspired [[Kip Thorne]] to imagine traversable wormholes created by holding the "throat" of a Schwarzschild wormhole open with [[exotic matter]] (material that has negative mass/energy).

Ellis thoroughly analyzed the topology and the [[geodesic]]s of the [[Ellis drainhole]], showing it to be geodesically complete, horizonless, singularity-free, and fully traversable in both directions.  The drainhole is a solution manifold of Einstein's field equations for a vacuum space-time, modified by inclusion of a scalar field minimally coupled to the [[Ricci tensor]] with antiorthodox polarity (negative instead of positive).  (Ellis specifically rejected referring to the scalar field as 'exotic' because of the antiorthodox coupling, finding arguments for doing so unpersuasive.)  The solution depends on two parameters: &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, which fixes the strength of its gravitational field, and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, which determines the curvature of its spatial cross sections.  When &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is set equal to 0, the drainhole's gravitational field vanishes.  What is left is the [[Ellis wormhole]], a nongravitating, purely geometric, traversable wormhole.
[[Kip Thorne]] and his graduate student [[Mike Morris (physicist)|Mike Morris]], unaware of the 1973 papers by Ellis and Bronnikov,  manufactured, and in 1988 published, a duplicate of the Ellis wormhole for use as a tool for teaching general relativity. For this reason, the type of traversable wormhole they proposed, held open by a spherical shell of [[exotic matter]], was from 1988 to 2015 exclusively referred to in the literature as a ''Morris–Thorne wormhole''. Later, other types of traversable wormholes were discovered as allowable solutions to the equations of general relativity, including a variety analyzed in a 1989 paper by [[Matt Visser]], in which a path through the wormhole can be made where the traversing path does not pass through a region of exotic matter. However, in the pure [[Gauss–Bonnet gravity]] (a modification to general relativity involving extra spatial dimensions which is sometimes studied in the context of [[brane cosmology]]) exotic matter is not needed in order for wormholes to exist—they can exist even with no matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Elias Gravanis|author2=Steven Willison|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.75.084025|year=2007|title='Mass without mass' from thin shells in Gauss-Bonnet gravity|issue=8|pages=084025|volume=75|journal=Phys.

Cramer|Cramer]] ''et al.'',&lt;ref name="naturalwormholes"/&gt; in which it was proposed that such wormholes could have been naturally created in the early universe.

Wormholes connect two points in spacetime, which means that they would in principle allow [[time travel|travel in time]], as well as in space. In 1988, Morris, Thorne and Yurtsever worked out explicitly how to convert a wormhole traversing space into one traversing time by accelerating one of its two mouths.&lt;ref name="time travel"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.61.1446|title=Wormholes, Time Machines, and the Weak Energy Condition|date=1988|last1=Morris|first1=Michael|last2=Thorne|first2=Kip|last3=Yurtsever|first3=Ulvi|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=61|issue=13|pages=1446–1449|url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/9262/1/MORprl88.pdf|pmid=10038800|bibcode=1988PhRvL..61.1446M}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to general relativity, it would not be possible to use a wormhole to travel back to a time earlier than when the wormhole was first converted into a time 'machine'. Until this time it could not have been noticed or have been used.&lt;ref name="Thorne1994" /&gt;{{Rp|504}}

== Raychaudhuri's theorem and exotic matter ==
To see why [[exotic matter]] is required, consider an incoming light front traveling along geodesics, which then crosses the wormhole and re-expands on the other side. The [[congruence (general relativity)|expansion]] goes from negative to positive. As the wormhole neck is of finite size, we would not expect caustics to develop, at least within the vicinity of the neck. According to the optical [[Raychaudhuri's theorem]], this requires a violation of the [[averaged null energy condition]]. Quantum effects such as the [[Casimir effect]] cannot violate the averaged null energy condition in any neighborhood of space with zero curvature,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fewster|first=Christopher J.|author2=Ken D.

==Modified general relativity==
In some hypotheses where [[Alternatives to general relativity|general relativity is modified]], it is possible to have a wormhole that does not collapse without having to resort to exotic matter. For example, this is possible with R^2 gravity, a form of [[f(R) gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1506.00988|title=Exotica ex nihilo: Traversable wormholes &amp; non-singular black holes from the vacuum of quadratic gravity|journal=Physical Review D|volume=92|issue=4|pages=043516|last1=Duplessis|first1=Francis|last2= Easson|first2=Damien A.|year=2015|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.92.043516|bibcode=2015PhRvD..92d3516D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impossibility of faster-than-light relative speed only applies locally. Wormholes might allow effective superluminal ([[faster-than-light]]) travel by ensuring that the speed of light is not exceeded locally at any time. While traveling through a wormhole, subluminal (slower-than-light) speeds are used. If two points are connected by a wormhole whose length is shorter than the distance between them ''outside'' the wormhole, the time taken to traverse it could be less than the time it would take a light beam to make the journey if it took a path through the space ''outside'' the wormhole. However, a light beam traveling through the same wormhole would of course beat the traveler.

== Time travel ==
{{main|Time travel}}

If [[#Traversable wormholes|traversable wormholes]] exist, they could allow [[time travel]].&lt;ref name="time travel"/&gt; A proposed time-travel machine using a traversable wormhole would hypothetically work in the following way: One end of the wormhole is accelerated to some significant fraction of the speed of light, perhaps with some advanced [[Vehicle propulsion|propulsion system]], and then brought back to the point of origin. Alternatively, another way is to take one entrance of the wormhole and move it to within the gravitational field of an object that has higher gravity than the other entrance, and then return it to a position near the other entrance. For both of these methods, [[time dilation]] causes the end of the wormhole that has been moved to have aged less, or become "younger", than the stationary end as seen by an external observer; however, time connects differently ''through'' the wormhole than ''outside'' it, so that [[Synchronization|synchronized]] clocks at either end of the wormhole will always remain synchronized as seen by an observer passing through the wormhole, no matter how the two ends move around.&lt;ref name="Thorne1994"&gt;{{cite book | last = Thorne | first = Kip S. | authorlink = Kip Thorne | title = Black Holes and Time Warps | publisher = W.

One significant limitation of such a time machine is that it is only possible to go as far back in time as the initial creation of the machine;&lt;ref name="Thorne1994" /&gt;{{rp|503}} It is more of a path through time rather than it is a device that itself moves through time, and it would not allow the technology itself to be moved backward in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=gr-qc/0503097|title=Wormholes and Time Travel?

According to current theories on the nature of wormholes, construction of a traversable wormhole would require the existence of a substance with negative energy, often referred to as "[[exotic matter]]". More technically, the wormhole spacetime requires a distribution of energy that violates various [[energy condition]]s, such as the null energy condition along with the weak, strong, and dominant energy conditions. However, it is known that quantum effects can lead to small measurable violations of the null energy condition,&lt;ref name="Visser1996"&gt;{{cite book | last = Visser | first = Matt | authorlink = Matt Visser | title = Lorentzian Wormholes | publisher = Springer-Verlag | year= 1996 | isbn = 978-1-56396-653-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|101}} and many physicists believe that the required negative energy may actually be possible due to the [[Casimir effect]] in quantum physics.&lt;ref name="casimir"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npl.washington.edu/av/altvw69.html |title=NASA Goes FTL Part 1: Wormhole Physics |website=Analog Science Fiction &amp; Fact Magazine|year=1994|accessdate=December 2, 2006|last1=Cramer|first1=John G. |authorlink=John G.

In 1993, [[Matt Visser]] argued that the two mouths of a wormhole with such an induced clock difference could not be brought together without inducing quantum field and gravitational effects that would either make the wormhole collapse or the two mouths repel each other,&lt;ref name="visser_1"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Matt | last = Visser | authorlink = Matt Visser | title = From wormhole to time machine: Comments on Hawking's Chronology Protection Conjecture | journal = Physical Review D | volume = 47 | year = 1993 | issue = 2 | pages = 554–565 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.47.554| arxiv=hep-th/9202090|bibcode = 1993PhRvD..47..554V }}&lt;/ref&gt; or otherwise prevent information from passing through the wormhole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=gr-qc/0204022|title=The quantum physics of chronology protection|last1=Visser|first1=Matt|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, the two mouths could not be brought close enough for [[causality (physics)|causality]] violation to take place. However, in a 1997 paper, Visser hypothesized that a complex "[[Roman ring]]" (named after Tom Roman) configuration of an N number of wormholes arranged in a symmetric polygon could still act as a time machine, although he concludes that this is more likely a flaw in classical quantum gravity theory rather than proof that causality violation is possible.&lt;ref name="visser_2"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Matt | last = Visser | authorlink = Matt Visser | title = Traversable wormholes: the Roman ring | journal = Physical Review D | volume = 55 | year = 1997 | issue = 8 | pages = 5212–5214 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.55.5212| arxiv=gr-qc/9702043|bibcode = 1997PhRvD..55.5212V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interuniversal travel&lt;!--'Interuniversal travel', 'Inter-universal travel' and 'Everett phone' redirect here--&gt; ==
A possible resolution to the paradoxes resulting from wormhole-enabled time travel rests on the [[many-worlds interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics]].

In 1991 [[David Deutsch]] showed that quantum theory is fully consistent (in the sense that the so-called [[density matrix]] can be made free of discontinuities) in spacetimes with closed timelike curves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deutsch|first=David |title=Quantum Mechanics Near Closed Timelike Lines|date=1991|journal=[[Physical Review D]]|volume=44|issue=10|page=3197|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevD.44.3197|bibcode=1991PhRvD..44.3197D}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later it was shown that such model of closed timelike curve can have internal inconsistencies as it will lead to strange phenomena like distinguishing non-orthogonal quantum states and distinguishing proper and improper mixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Brun|display-authors=etal |title=Localized Closed Timelike Curves Can Perfectly Distinguish Quantum States|date=2009|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=102|issue=21|page=210402|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.210402|bibcode=2009PhRvL.102u0402B|pmid=19519086|arxiv=0811.1209}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Pati |author2=Chakrabarty|author3=Agrawal|title=Purification of mixed states with closed timelike curve is not possible|date=2011|journal=[[Physical Review A]]|volume=84|issue=6|page=062325|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevA.84.062325|bibcode = 2011PhRvA..84f2325P |arxiv = 1003.4221 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the destructive positive feedback loop of virtual particles circulating through a wormhole time machine, a result indicated by semi-classical calculations, is averted. A particle returning from the future does not return to its universe of origination but to a parallel universe. This suggests that a wormhole time machine with an exceedingly short time jump is a theoretical bridge between contemporaneous parallel universes.&lt;ref name="Rodrigo2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rodrigo|first=Enrico|title=The Physics of Stargates|publisher=Eridanus Press|date= 2010|page=281|isbn= 978-0-9841500-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The possibility of communication between parallel universes has been dubbed '''interuniversal travel'''.&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Walker, [https://www.newscientist.com/letter/mg23331111-100-14-interuniversal-travel-i-wouldnt-start-from-here/ "Inter-universal travel: I wouldn't start from here], ''[[New Scientist]]'' (1 February 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metrics ==
Theories of ''wormhole metrics'' describe the spacetime geometry of a wormhole and serve as theoretical models for time travel. An example of a (traversable) wormhole [[metric tensor|metric]] is the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Raine |first1=Derek |last2=Thomas |first2=Edwin |date=2009 |title= Black Holes: An Introduction |publisher=Imperial College Press |page=143 |isbn=978-1-84816-383-6 | edition=2nd|doi=10.1142/p637 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2= - c^2 dt^2 + dl^2 + (k^2 + l^2)(d \theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2),&lt;/math&gt;

first presented by Ellis (see [[Ellis wormhole]]) as a special case of the [[Ellis drainhole]].

One type of non-traversable wormhole [[metric tensor|metric]] is the [[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild solution]] (see the first diagram):

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2= - c^2 \left(1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2}\right)dt^2 + \frac{dr^2}{1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2}} + r^2(d \theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2).&lt;/math&gt;

The original Einstein–Rosen bridge was described in an article published in July 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Einstein|first1=A.|last2=Rosen|first2=N.|title=The Particle Problem in the General Theory of Relativity|journal=Physical Review|date=1 July 1935|volume=48|issue=1|pages=73–77|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.48.73|bibcode = 1935PhRv...48...73E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBPpRqxY8Uw|title=Leonard Susskind {{!}} 'ER = EPR' or 'What's Behind the Horizons of Black Holes?'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Schwarzschild spherically symmetric static solution 
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = - \frac{1}{1 - \frac{2m}{r}} dr^2 - r^2(d\theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2) + (1 - \frac{2m}{r})dt^2&lt;/math&gt;
(&lt;math&gt;ds&lt;/math&gt; = proper time, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; = 1)

If one replaces &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; according to
&lt;math&gt;u^2 = r - 2m&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = -4(u^2 + 2m)du^2 - (u^2 + 2m)^2(d\theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2) + \frac{u^2}{u^2 + 2m} dt^2&lt;/math&gt;

{{Quote|text=The four-dimensional space is described mathematically by two congruent parts or "sheets", corresponding to &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; &gt; 0 and &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; &lt; 0, which are joined by a hyperplane &lt;math&gt;r = 2m&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; = 0 in which &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; vanishes. We call such a connection between the two sheets a "bridge".|author=A. Einstein, N. Rosen, "The Particle Problem in the General Theory of Relativity"}}

For the combined field, gravity and electricity, Einstein and Rosen derived the following Schwarzschild static spherically symmetric solution
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{1} = \phi_{2} = \phi_{3} = 0, \phi_{4} = \frac{\epsilon}{4},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = - \frac{1}{( 1 - \frac{2m}{r} - \frac{\epsilon^2}{2 r^2})} dr^2 - r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2) +
(1 - \frac{2m}{r} - \frac{\epsilon^2}{2 r^2}) dt^2&lt;/math&gt;
(&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; = electrical charge)

The field equations without denominators in the case when &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; = 0 can be written
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{\mu \nu} = \phi_{\mu,\nu} - \phi_{\nu,\mu}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g^2 \phi_{\mu\nu;\sigma}g^{\nu\sigma} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g^2 (R_{ik} + \phi_{i\alpha}\phi_{k}^{\alpha} - \frac{1}{4} g_{ik} \phi_{\alpha\beta}\phi^{ab}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

In order to eliminate singularities, if one replaces &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; according to the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;u^2 = r^2 - \frac{\epsilon^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

and with &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; = 0 one obtains&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/09/150903081506.htm|title=Magnetic wormhole connecting two regions of space created for the first time}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uab.cat/web/newsroom/news-detail/magnetic-wormhole-created-for-first-time-1345668003610.html?noticiaid=1345689132054|title=Magnetic wormhole created for first time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{1} = \phi_{2} = \phi_{3} = 0,  \phi_{4} = \epsilon / (u^2 + \frac{\epsilon^2}{2})^\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = - du^2 - (u^2 + \frac{\epsilon^2}{2})(d \theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2) + (\frac{2 u^2}{2 u^2 + \epsilon^2})dt^2&lt;/math&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=March 2017}}

'''Ylem''' is a term that was used by [[George Gamow]], his student [[Ralph Alpher]], and their associates in the late 1940s for a hypothetical original substance or condensed state of matter, which became [[subatomic particles]] and [[chemical element|element]]s as we understand them today. The term ''ylem'' was actually resuscitated (it appears in [[Webster's Second]] "the first substance from which the elements were supposed to have been formed") by Ralph Alpher.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cosmos''--''Voyage Through the Universe'' series, New York:1988 Time-Life Books Page 75&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern understanding, the "ylem" described as by Gamow was the primordial [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], formed in [[baryogenesis]], which underwent [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] and was opaque to radiation. [[Recombination (cosmology)|Recombination]] of the charged plasma into neutral [[atom]]s made the Universe transparent at the age of 380,000 years, and the radiation released is still observable as [[cosmic microwave background radiation]].

==History==
It comes from an obsolete [[Middle English]] philosophical word that Alpher said he found in Webster's dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED |term=ylem |id=/231917 |date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word means something along the lines of "primordial substance from which all matter is formed" (that in ancient [[mythology]] of many different cultures was called the [[cosmic egg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bernstein |first=Jeremy |title=Out of My Mind: The Birth of Modern Cosmology |journal=The American Scholar |volume=55 |issue=1 |year=1986 |pages=7–18 |jstor=41211280}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and ultimately derives from the Greek ''ὕλη'' (''hūlē, hȳlē''), "matter", probably through an accusative singular form in Latin ''hylen, hylem''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED |term=hyle |id=90173 |date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an oral history interview in 1968 Gamow talked about ylem as an old Hebrew word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Gamow |first=George |url=https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/oral-histories/4325 |title=Oral Histories - George Gamow |interviewer=Charles Weiner |publisher=[[American Institute of Physics]] |date=25 April 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ylem is what Gamow and colleagues presumed to exist immediately after the Big Bang. Within the ylem, there were assumed to be a large number of high-energy [[photon]]s present. Alpher and [[Robert Herman]] made a [[scientific prediction]] in 1948 that we should still be able to observe these [[red-shift]]ed photons today as an ambient [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMBR) pervading all space with a temperature of about 5 [[kelvin]]s&lt;ref&gt;''The Cosmos'' – ''Voyage Through the Universe'' series, New York: 1988 Time-Life Books, Page 80.&lt;/ref&gt; (when the CMBR was actually first detected in 1965, its temperature was found to be 3 kelvins). It is now recognized that the CMBR originated at the transition from predominantly ionized hydrogen to non-ionized hydrogen at around 400,000 years after the Big Bang.

==In popular culture ==
After the term ''ylem'' was resuscitated by Alpher, it was used in the 1952 [[science fiction]] novel ''Jack of Eagles'' by [[James Blish]]. It was also used by [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]] in his 1959 short story "Round Trip", reprinted in the collection ''[[Not Before Time]]''. [[Keith Laumer]] in the novel ''Dinosaur Beach'' introduces the ylem field 1969.  The term is also used by British author [[Richard Calder (writer)|Richard Calder]] in the 1990s to describe the [[quantum mechanical]] state of the "quantum magic" in the girls/robots in his "Dead" trilogy (''[[Dead Girls]]'', ''[[Dead Boys (novel)|Dead Boys]]'', ''Dead Things''). [[John C. Wright (author)|John C. Wright]] used the term in his debut novel ''[[The Golden Age (John C. Wright novel)#Book 1: The Golden Age|The Golden Age]]'' to describe a "pseudo-matter" that forms "temporary virtual particles". A German black metal band "Dark Fortress" also released an album titled "Ylem". A the trance classic by The Thrillseekers - Synaesthesia has a "Ylem" remix. The video game series [[Ultima (series)|Ultima]] uses "Ylem" as a Word of Power in its incantation and runic based spell casting system, its meaning being "matter".

In 1981, Trudy Myrrh Reagan formed an organization, "Ylem: Artists Using Science and Technology" (later written YLEM), in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ylem.org/Membership/history_detailed.html|title=YLEM Detailed history|website=www.ylem.org|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also a usable word in the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary, Fifth edition.
