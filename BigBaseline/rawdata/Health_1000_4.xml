      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3455">The '''3 by 5 Initiative''' was an initiative of the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) to provide [[antiretroviral treatment]] to patients with [[HIV/AIDS]] in low- and middle-income countries.&lt;ref name="who_main"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/3by5/en/ |title=The 3 by 5 Initiative |accessdate=May 2, 2016 |publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program lasted from December 2003 to December 2005,&lt;ref name="eval"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/derec/canada/3by5-Evaluation-WHO.pdf |title=EVALUATION OF WHO’s CONTRIBUTION TO "3 BY 5": Main Report |accessdate=May 2, 2016 |date=2006 |author=Maria Ines Battistella Nemes |publisher=World Health Organization|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the name "3 by 5" refers to the goal of treating 3 million people by 2005. The 3 by 5 Initiative is seen as the beginning of the scaling of antiretroviral treatments, and evaluations of the Initiative take this into account.&lt;ref name=eval/&gt;

==Strategy==

The 3 by 5 Initiative was guided by five "strategic pillars":&lt;ref name="making_it_happen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/3by5/publications/documents/en/3by5StrategyMakingItHappen.pdf |title=Treating 3 million by 2005: Making it happen - The WHO Strategy |accessdate=May 2, 2016 |date=2003 |publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* global leadership, strong partnership and advocacy
* urgent, sustained country support
* simplified, standardized tools for delivering antiretroviral therapy
* effective, reliable supply of medicines and diagnostics
* rapidly identifying and reapplying new knowledge and successes
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Evaluation of the initiative==

An evaluation team commissioned by the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] (CIDA) and WHO reviewed the 3 by 5 initiative between July 2005 and March 2006. The evaluation team published their report in March 2006, titled ''Progress on global access to HIV antiretroviral therapy: a report on "3 by 5" and beyond''. It found that 1.3 million people were receiving antiretroviral treatment in the target countries by December 2005, up from 400,000 before the start of the initiative. The evaluation team also found that many of the worst-affected countries were still far from containing their AIDS crises. It also credits the 3 by 5 Initiative with establishing antiretroviral treatment as an essential public health intervention.&lt;ref name=eval/&gt;{{rp|XIX–XX}}

The evaluation team attributes some of the difficulties in achieving the goals of the Initiative to an initial lack of secured funding (resulting in delays) and an unstable management of the HIV/AIDS program (due to the high turnover rate of WHO directors).&lt;ref name=eval/&gt;{{rp|XXIX}}

The 3 by 5 Initiative has been criticized by [[Arthur J. Ammann]] for focusing only on treatment of HIV (instead of also focusing on testing and prevention), for the high costs of the program, and for being "top down" instead of allowing target countries to take charge of their own AIDS programs.&lt;ref name="plos"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0010037 |title=Is the "3 by 5" Initiative the Best Approach to Tackling the HIV Pandemic? |accessdate=May 2, 2016 |date=November 30, 2004 |last1=Kim |first1=Jim Yong |first2=Arthur |last2=Ammann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antibiotic misuse''', sometimes called '''antibiotic abuse''' or '''antibiotic overuse''', refers to the misuse or overuse of [[antibiotic]]s, with potentially serious effects on health. It is a contributing factor to the development of [[antibiotic resistance]], including the creation of [[Antibiotic resistance|multidrug-resistant bacteria]], informally called "super bugs": relatively harmless bacteria (such as [[staphylococcus]], [[enterococcus]] and [[acinetobacter]]) can develop resistance to multiple antibiotics and cause life-threatening infections.&lt;ref name="pmid9643260"&gt;{{cite journal|date=April 1998|title=The beginning of the end of the antibiotic era? Part II. Proposed solutions to antibiotic abuse|journal=[[Quintessence International]]|volume=29|issue=4|pages=223–9|pmid=9643260|vauthors=Harrison JW, Svec TA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of antibiotic regulation==
Antibiotics have been around since 1928 when penicillin was discovered by Alexander Fleming. In the 1980s, antibiotics that were determined medically important for treatment of animals could be approved under veterinary oversight. In 1996, the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) was established.&lt;ref name="Food Insight 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Food Insight | year = 2016 | title = FDA Antibiotic Regulation Through the Decades | url = http://www.foodinsight.org/fda-antibiotics-regulations-fact-sheet }}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2010, publications regarding antimicrobial drugs in food become an annual report. Starting in 2012, there was publicly solicited input on how data is to be collected and reported for matters relating to the use of antimicrobials for food-producing animals. Resulting from this, the FDA revised its sampling structure within NARMS with the goal of obtaining more representative livestock data for the key organisms under surveillance.&lt;ref name="Food Insight 2016"/&gt;  “NARMS partners at CDC and USDA have published over 150 peer-reviewed research articles examining the nature and magnitude of antimicrobial resistance hazards associated with antibiotic use in food-producing animals.” In 2014, the FDA began working with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  to explore additional mechanisms to obtain data that is representative of antibiotic use in food-producing animals. In 2015, the FDA issues the [[Veterinary Feed Directive]] (VFD) final rule. Under this rule veterinarians must authorize the use of antimicrobials within feed for the animals they serve.&lt;ref name="Food Insight 2016"/&gt;

In a study of 32 States in 2011, antibiotics and anti-infectives accounted for nearly 24 percent of ADEs that were present on admission, and 28 percent of those that occurred during a hospital stay.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss AJ, Elixhauser A.

If antimicrobial resistance continues to increase from current levels, it is estimated that by 2050 ten million people would die every year due to lack of available treatment and the world’s GDP would be 2 - 3.5% lower in 2050.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://amr-review.org/sites/default/files/AMR%20Review%20Paper%20-%20Tackling%20a%20crisis%20for%20the%20health%20and%20wealth%20of%20nations_1.pdf|title=Antimicrobial Resistance: Tackling a crisis for the health and wealth of nations|last=|first=|date=|website=Review on Antimicrobial Resistance|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If worldwide action is not taken to combat antibiotic misuse and the development of antimicrobial resistance, from 2014 - 2050 it is estimated that 300 million people could die prematurely due to drug resistance and $60 – 100 trillion of economic output would be lost.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If the current worldwide development of antimicrobial resistance is delayed by just 10 years,  $65 trillion of the world’s GDP output can be saved from 2014-2050.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Prescribing by an infectious disease specialist compared with prescribing by a non-infectious disease specialist decreases antibiotic consumption and reduces costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Beović B., Kreft, Seme K., Čižman M. | year = 2009 | title = The Impact of Total Control of Antibiotic Prescribing by Infectious Disease Specialist on Antibiotic Consumption and Cost | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/joc.2009.21.1.46 | journal = Journal of Chemotherapy | volume = 21 | issue = 1| pages = 46–51 | doi=10.1179/joc.2009.21.1.46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antibiotic resistance==
{{main|Antibiotic resistance}}
Though antibiotics are required to treat severe bacterial infections, misuse has contributed to a rise in bacterial resistance.

===Antibiotics in livestock===
{{main|Antibiotic use in livestock}}
There has been massive use of antibiotics in [[animal husbandry]]. The most abundant use of antimicrobials worldwide is in livestock; they are typically distributed in animal feed or water for purposes such as disease prevention and growth promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Industrial food animal production, antimicrobial resistance, and human health|year=2008|last1=Silbergeld|last2=Graham|last3=Price|first1=E.K.|first2=J.|first3=L.B.|journal=Annual Review of Public Health|volume=29|pages=151–169|doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.29.020907.090904|pmid=18348709}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Debates have arisen surrounding the extent of the impact of these antibiotics, particularly antimicrobial growth promoters, on human antibiotic resistance. Although some sources assert that there remains a lack of knowledge on which antibiotic use generates the most risk to humans,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=A review of antibiotic use in food animals: Perspective, policy, and potential|year=2012|last1=Landers|last2=Cohen|last3=Wittum|last4=Larson|first1=T.F.|first2=B.|first3=T.E.|first4=E.L.|journal=Public Health Reports|volume=127|issue=1|pages=4–22|doi=|pmc=3234384|pmid=22298919}}&lt;/ref&gt; policies and regulations have been placed to limit any harmful effects, such as the potential of bacteria developing antibiotic resistance within livestock, and that bacteria transferring resistance genes to human pathogens &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/09/are-antibiotics-turning-livestock-superbug-factories&lt;/ref&gt;
On January 1, 2017, the FDA enacted legislation to require that all human medically important feed-grade antibiotics (many prior over-the-counter-drugs) become classified as Veterinary Feed Directive drugs (VFD).  This action requires that farmers establish and work with veterinaries to receive a written VFD order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Beth Ferry, Madonna Benjamin, Michigan State University Extension and Megan Sprague, MDARD | year = 2016 | title = Don’t wait, be ready! New antibiotic rules for 2017  | url = http://msue.anr.msu.edu/news/dont_wait_be_ready_new_antibiotic_rules_for_2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of this act places a requirement on an established veterinarian-client-patient relationship (VCPR). Through this relationship, farmers will receive an increased education in the form of advice and guidance from their veterinarian.

These approaches may be more expensive, [[adverse effect|more toxic]] or both. Microbes resistant to multiple antimicrobials are called [[multiple drug resistance|multidrug resistant]] (MDR). Those considered extensively drug resistant (XDR) or totally drug resistant (TDR) are sometimes called "superbugs".&lt;ref name="cdcgetsmart"&gt;{{cite web|title=Antibiotic Resistance Questions &amp; Answers|url=https://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/antibiotic-use/antibiotic-resistance-faqs.html#e|work=Get Smart: Know When Antibiotics Work|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA|access-date=20 March 2013|date=30 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329183317/http://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/antibiotic-use/antibiotic-resistance-faqs.html#e|archive-date=29 March 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resistance arises through one of three mechanisms: natural resistance in certain types of bacteria, genetic [[mutation]], or by one species acquiring resistance from another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tufts.edu/med/apua/about_issue/about_antibioticres.shtml|title=General Background: About Antibiotic Resistance|website=www.tufts.edu|access-date=2015-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023035356/http://www.tufts.edu/med/apua/about_issue/about_antibioticres.shtml|archive-date=23 October 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; All classes of microbes can develop resistance. Fungi develop [[antifungal]] resistance. [[Virus]]es develop [[antiviral]] resistance. [[Protozoa]] develop [[antiprotozoal]] resistance, and [[bacteria]] develop [[antibiotic]] resistance. Resistance can appear spontaneously because of random mutations. However, extended use of antimicrobials appears to encourage selection for mutations which can render antimicrobials ineffective.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention --&gt;
Preventive measures include only using antibiotics when needed, thereby stopping [[antibiotic misuse|misuse of antibiotics or antimicrobials]].&lt;ref name="About Antimicrobial Resistance"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/about.html|title=About Antimicrobial Resistance|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2015-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171001044758/https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/about.html|archive-date=1 October 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all|date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swedish"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Swedish work on containment of antibiotic resistance – Tools, methods and experiences|publisher = Public Health Agency of Sweden|year = 2014|isbn = 978-91-7603-011-0|url = http://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/pagefiles/17351/Swedish-work-on-containment-of-antibiotic-resistance.pdf|location = Stockholm|pages = 16–17, 121–128|access-date = 23 July 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150723081110/http://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/pagefiles/17351/Swedish-work-on-containment-of-antibiotic-resistance.pdf|archive-date = 23 July 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Narrow-spectrum antibiotics are preferred over broad-spectrum antibiotics when possible, as effectively and accurately targeting specific organisms is less likely to cause resistance.&lt;ref name="NPS2013"&gt;{{cite web|title = Duration of antibiotic therapy and resistance|url = http://www.nps.org.au/publications/health-professional/health-news-evidence/2013/duration-of-antibiotic-therapy|website = NPS Medicinewise|publisher = National Prescribing Service Limited trading, Australia|access-date = 22 July 2015|date = 13 June 2013|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150723074759/http://www.nps.org.au/publications/health-professional/health-news-evidence/2013/duration-of-antibiotic-therapy|archive-date = 23 July 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For people who take these medications at home, education about proper use is essential.

&lt;!-- Treatment and Epidemiology --&gt;
Rising drug resistance is caused mainly by use of antimicrobials in humans and other animals, and spread of resistant strains between the two.&lt;ref name="About Antimicrobial Resistance"/&gt; Growing resistance has also been linked to dumping of inadequately treated effluents from the pharmaceutical industry, especially in countries where bulk drugs are manufactured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Changing Markets|title=IMPACTS OF PHARMACEUTICAL POLLUTION ON COMMUNITIES AND ENVIRONMENT IN INDIA|url=https://www.nordea.com/Images/35-107206/impacts%201-20.pdf|website=Nordea|publisher=Nordea|accessdate=1 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170520031434/https://www.nordea.com/Images/35-107206/impacts%201-20.pdf|archive-date=20 May 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antibiotics increase [[selective pressure]] in bacterial populations, causing vulnerable bacteria to die; this increases the percentage of resistant bacteria which continue growing.

The WHO defines antimicrobial resistance as a microorganism's resistance to an antimicrobial drug that was once able to treat an infection by that microorganism.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt;
A person cannot become resistant to antibiotics. Resistance is a property of the microbe, not a person or other organism infected by a microbe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/antibiotic-use/antibiotic-resistance-faqs.html#antibiotic-resistance-concerns|title=CDC: Get Smart: Know When Antibiotics Work|publisher=Cdc.gov|access-date=2013-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429180658/http://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/antibiotic-use/antibiotic-resistance-faqs.html#antibiotic-resistance-concerns|archive-date=29 April 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all|date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
A [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) report released April 2014 stated, "this serious threat is no longer a prediction for the future, it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone, of any age, in any country. Antibiotic resistance—when bacteria change so antibiotics no longer work in people who need them to treat infections—is now a major threat to public health."&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/amr-report/en/ "WHO's first global report on antibiotic resistance reveals serious, worldwide threat to public health"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502044726/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/amr-report/en/ |date=2 May 2014 }} Retrieved 2014-05-02&lt;/ref&gt;

Because individuals may feel better before the infection is eradicated, doctors must provide instructions to them so they know when it is safe to stop taking a prescription.

Penicillinase may have emerged as a defense mechanism for bacteria in their [[habitat]]s, such as the case of penicillinase-rich ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', living with penicillin-producing ''[[Trichophyton]]''; however, this may be circumstantial.&lt;ref name="penicillinase" /&gt; Search for a penicillinase ancestor has focused on the class of [[protein]]s that must be ''a priori'' capable of specific combination with [[penicillin]].&lt;ref&gt;Pollock, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; The resistance to cefoxitin and clindamycin in turn was attributed to Braine's and Hartnell's contact with microorganisms that naturally produce them or [[random mutation]] in the [[chromosome]]s of ''Clostridium'' strains.&lt;ref name="NS" /&gt;

There is evidence that [[heavy metals]] and other pollutants may select for antibiotic-resistant bacteria, generating a constant source of them in small numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seiler C, Berendonk TU | title = Heavy metal driven co-selection of antibiotic resistance in soil and water bodies impacted by agriculture and aquaculture | journal = Frontiers in Microbiology | volume = 3 | pages = 399 | date = December 14, 2012 | pmid = 23248620 | pmc = 3522115 | doi = 10.3389/fmicb.2012.00399 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water pollution===
Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem among humans and wildlife in terrestrial or aquatic environments. In this respect, the spread and contamination of the environment, especially through [[water pollution]] "hot spots" such as hospital [[wastewater]] and untreated urban wastewater, is a growing and serious public health problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Levy SB | title = The 2000 Garrod lecture.

L. 2012 pp. 151- 171"&gt;Martinez, J. L., &amp; Olivares, J. (2012). 
Environmental Pollution By Antibiotic Resistance Genes. In P. L. Keen, &amp; M. H. Montforts, Antimicrobial Resistance in the Environment (pp. 151- 171). Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; The contribution of the pharmaceutical industry is so significant that parallels can be drawn between countries with highest rate of increasing antibiotic resistance and countries with largest footprint of pharmaceutical industry. China, which contributes to nearly 90 per cent of the world's active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) manufacturing, has seen a 22 per cent increase in rate of antimicrobial resistance in six years, compared to a 6 per cent increase in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yezli S, Li H | title = Antibiotic resistance amongst healthcare-associated pathogens in China | journal = International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents | volume = 40 | issue = 5 | pages = 389–97 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 22999767 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2012.07.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with antibiotic waste, resistant bacteria follow, thus introducing antibiotic-resistant bacteria into the environment. Already in 2011, mapping of sewage and water supply samples in [[New Delhi]] showed widespread and uncontrolled infection as indicated by the presence of NDM-1-positive enteric bacteria ([[New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1]]).&lt;ref name="Walsh_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Walsh TR, Weeks J, Livermore DM, Toleman MA | title = Dissemination of NDM-1 positive bacteria in the New Delhi environment and its implications for human health: an environmental point prevalence study | journal = The Lancet.

As bacteria replicate quickly, the resistant bacteria that enter water bodies through wastewater replicate their resistance genes as they continue to divide. In addition, bacteria carrying resistance genes have the ability to spread those genes to other species via horizontal gene transfer. Therefore, even if the specific antibiotic is no longer introduced into the environment, antibiotic-resistance genes will persist through the bacteria that have since replicated without continuous exposure.&lt;ref name="Martinez, J. L. 2012 pp. 151- 171" /&gt; Antibiotic resistance is widespread in marine vertebrates, and they may be important reservoirs of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the [[Marine ecosystem|marine environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rose JM, Gast RJ, Bogomolni A, Ellis JC, Lentell BJ, Touhey K, Moore M | title = Occurrence and patterns of antibiotic resistance in vertebrates off the Northeastern United States coast | journal = FEMS Microbiology Ecology | volume = 67 | issue = 3 | pages = 421–31 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19187217 | pmc = 5444207 | doi = 10.1111/j.1574-6941.2009.00648.x | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
[[File:Antibioticresistance diagram.png|thumb|350px|Mission Critical: Preventing Antibiotic Resistance (CDC report, 2014)|alt=Infographic from CDC report on preventing antibiotic resistance]]

There have been increasing public calls for global collective action to address the threat, including a proposal for international treaty on antimicrobial resistance. Further detail and attention is still needed in order to recognize and measure trends in resistance on the international level; the idea of a global tracking system has been suggested but implementation has yet to occur. A system of this nature would provide insight to areas of high resistance as well as information necessary for evaluation of programs and other changes made to fight or reverse antibiotic resistance.

===Duration of antibiotics===
Antibiotic treatment duration should be based on the infection and other health problems a person may have.&lt;ref name=NPS2013/&gt;&lt;!-- "When optimising therapy for an infection consider the person’s immune status, the infecting agent and the focus of infection." --&gt; For many infections once a person has improved there is little evidence that stopping treatment causes more resistance.&lt;ref name=NPS2013/&gt;&lt;!--  "There does not appear to be strong evidence to support the notion that stopping antibiotics before the end of the recommended treatment contributes to increasing resistance" --&gt; Some therefore feel that stopping early may be reasonable in some cases.&lt;ref name=NPS2013/&gt;&lt;!--  "Therefore, in selected cases, it may be appropriate to stop antibiotic therapy early." --&gt; Other infections, however, do require long courses regardless of whether a person feels better.&lt;ref name=NPS2013/&gt;&lt;!-- "For some infections, such as Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia, enterococcal endocarditis or tuberculosis, clear evidence favours prolonged treatment to prevent relapse" --&gt;

===Monitoring and mapping===
There are multiple national and international monitoring programs for drug-resistant threats, including [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA), [[Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|vancomycin-resistant ''S. aureus'']] (VRSA), [[Beta-lactamase|extended spectrum beta-lactamase]] (ESBL), [[Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus|vancomycin-resistant ''Enterococcus'']] (VRE), [[Acinetobacter baumannii|multidrug-resistant ''A. baumannii'']] (MRAB).&lt;ref name="CDC2013"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/biggest_threats.html|title=Biggest Threats - Antibiotic/Antimicrobial Resistance - CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-05-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912115220/https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/biggest_threats.html|archive-date=12 September 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all|date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Limiting antibiotic use ===
{{Further|Antibiotic misuse}}
[[Antibiotic stewardship programme]]s appear useful in reducing rates of antibiotic resistance.&lt;ref name="pmid28629876"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baur D, Gladstone BP, Burkert F, Carrara E, Foschi F, Döbele S, Tacconelli E | title = Effect of antibiotic stewardship on the incidence of infection and colonisation with antibiotic-resistant bacteria and Clostridium difficile infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = The Lancet.

Excessive antibiotic use has become one of the top contributors to the development of antibiotic resistance. Since the beginning of the antibiotic era, antibiotics have been used to treat a wide range of disease.&lt;ref name=Andersson2011&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Andersson DI, Hughes D | title = Persistence of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations | journal = FEMS Microbiology Reviews | volume = 35 | issue = 5 | pages = 901–11 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21707669 | doi = 10.1111/j.1574-6976.2011.00289.x | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overuse of antibiotics has become the primary cause of rising levels of antibiotic resistance. The main problem is that doctors are willing to prescribe antibiotics to ill-informed individuals who believe that antibiotics can cure nearly all illnesses, including viral infections like the common cold. In an analysis of drug prescriptions, 36% of individuals with a cold or an upper respiratory infection (both viral in origin) were given prescriptions for antibiotics.&lt;ref name=Gilberg2003&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilberg K, Laouri M, Wade S, Isonaka S | title = Analysis of medication use patterns:apparent overuse of antibiotics and underuse of prescription drugs for asthma, depression, and CHF | journal = Journal of Managed Care Pharmacy | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 232–7 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14613466 | doi = 10.18553/jmcp.2003.9.3.232 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These prescriptions accomplished nothing other than increasing the risk of further evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria.

==== At the hospital level ====
[[Antimicrobial stewardship]] teams in hospitals are encouraging optimal use of antimicrobials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Doron S, Davidson LE | title = Antimicrobial stewardship | journal = Mayo Clinic Proceedings | volume = 86 | issue = 11 | pages = 1113–23 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 22033257 | pmc = 3203003 | doi = 10.4065/mcp.2011.0358 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of antimicrobial stewardship are to help practitioners pick the right drug at the right dose and duration of therapy while preventing misuse and minimizing the development of resistance. Stewardship may reduce the length of stay by an average of slightly over 1 day while  not increasing the risk of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Davey P, Marwick CA, Scott CL, Charani E, McNeil K, Brown E, Gould IM, Ramsay CR, Michie S | title = Interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing practices for hospital inpatients | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2 | pages = CD003543 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 28178770 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.cd003543.pub4 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== At the level of GP ====
Given the volume of care provided in primary care (General Practice), recent strategies have focused on reducing unnecessary antibiotic prescribing in this setting. Simple interventions, such as written information explaining the futility of antibiotics for common infections such as upper respiratory tract infections, have been shown to reduce antibiotic prescribing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Sullivan JW, Harvey RT, Glasziou PP, McCullough A | title = Written information for patients (or parents of child patients) to reduce the use of antibiotics for acute upper respiratory tract infections in primary care | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 11 | pages = CD011360 | date = November 2016 | pmid = 27886368 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD011360.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prescriber should closely adhere to the five rights of drug administration: the right patient, the right drug, the right dose, the right route, and the right time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ihi.org/resources/pages/improvementstories/fiverightsofmedicationadministration.aspx|title=The Five Rights of Medication Administration|website=www.ihi.org|access-date=2015-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024101457/http://www.ihi.org/resources/pages/improvementstories/fiverightsofmedicationadministration.aspx|archive-date=24 October 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultures should be taken before treatment when indicated and treatment potentially changed based on the susceptibility report.&lt;ref name="CDC Mission" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Leekha S, Terrell CL, Edson RS | title = General principles of antimicrobial therapy | journal = Mayo Clinic Proceedings | volume = 86 | issue = 2 | pages = 156–67 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21282489 | pmc = 3031442 | doi = 10.4065/mcp.2010.0639 | url = http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(11)60140-7/pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

About a third of antibiotic prescriptions written in [[Patient#Outpatients and inpatients|outpatient settings]] in the United States were not appropriate in 2010 and 2011. Doctors in the U.S. wrote 506 annual antibiotic scripts for every 1,000 people, with 353 being medically necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fleming-Dutra KE, Hersh AL, Shapiro DJ, Bartoces M, Enns EA, File TM, Finkelstein JA, Gerber JS, Hyun DY, Linder JA, Lynfield R, Margolis DJ, May LS, Merenstein D, Metlay JP, Newland JG, Piccirillo JF, Roberts RM, Sanchez GV, Suda KJ, Thomas A, Woo TM, Zetts RM, Hicks LA | title = Prevalence of Inappropriate Antibiotic Prescriptions Among US Ambulatory Care Visits, 2010-2011 | journal = JAMA | volume = 315 | issue = 17 | pages = 1864–73 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 27139059 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2016.4151 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Health workers and pharmacists can help tackle resistance by: enhancing infection prevention and control; only prescribing and dispensing antibiotics when they are truly needed; prescribing and dispensing the right antibiotic(s) to treat the illness.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;

==== At the individual level ====
People can help tackle resistance by using antibiotics only when prescribed by a doctor; completing the full prescription, even if they feel better; never sharing antibiotics with others or using leftover prescriptions.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;

====Country examples====
* The [[Netherlands]] has the lowest rate of antibiotic prescribing in the [[OECD]], at a rate of 11.4 defined daily doses (DDD) per 1,000 people per day in 2011. 
* [[Germany]] and [[Sweden]] also have lower prescribing rates, with Sweden's rate having been declining since 2007.

=== Water, sanitation, hygiene ===
Infectious disease control through improved [[WASH|water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)]] infrastructure needs to be included in the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) agenda.

====United States====
The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) and the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) collect data on antibiotic use in humans and in a more limited fashion in animals.&lt;ref name="gao"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/330/323097.html|title=GAO-11-801, Antibiotic Resistance: Agencies Have Made Limited Progress Addressing Antibiotic Use in Animals|publisher=gao.gov|access-date=2014-01-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105120254/http://www.gao.gov/assets/330/323097.html|archive-date=5 November 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The FDA first determined in 1977 that there is evidence of emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains in livestock. The long-established practice of permitting OTC sales of antibiotics (including penicillin and other drugs) to lay animal owners for administration to their own animals nonetheless continued in all states.
In 2000, the FDA announced their intention to revoke approval of [[fluoroquinolone]] use in poultry production because of substantial evidence linking it to the emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant ''[[Campylobacter]]'' infections in humans. Legal challenges from the food animal and pharmaceutical industries delayed the final decision to do so until 2006.&lt;ref name="Nelson-2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nelson JM, Chiller TM, Powers JH, Angulo FJ | title = Fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter species and the withdrawal of fluoroquinolones from use in poultry: a public health success story | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 44 | issue = 7 | pages = 977–80 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17342653 | doi = 10.1086/512369 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluroquinolones have been banned from extra-label use in food animals in the USA since 2007. However, they remain widely used in companion and exotic animals.

===Global action plans and awareness===

The increasing interconnectedness of the world and the fact that new classes of antibiotics have not been developed and approved for more than 25 years highlight the extent to which antimicrobial resistance is a global health challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rand.org/randeurope/research/health/focus-on-antimicrobial-resistance.html|title=RAND Europe Focus on Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)|website=www.rand.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180421004546/https://www.rand.org/randeurope/research/health/focus-on-antimicrobial-resistance.html|archive-date=21 April 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A global action plan to tackle the growing problem of resistance to antibiotics and other antimicrobial medicines was endorsed at the Sixty-eighth World Health Assembly in May 2015.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wpro.who.int/entity/drug_resistance/resources/global_action_plan_eng.pdf|title=GLOBAL ACTION PLAN ON ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE|last=WHO|first=|date=|website=|access-date=November 14, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031170522/http://www.wpro.who.int/entity/drug_resistance/resources/global_action_plan_eng.pdf|archive-date=31 October 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the key objectives of the plan is to improve awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance through effective communication, education and training.

==== Antibiotic Awareness Week ====
The World Health Organization has promoted the first World Antibiotic Awareness Week running from 16–22 November 2015. The aim of the week is to increase global awareness of antibiotic resistance. It also wants to promote the correct usage of antibiotics across all fields in order to prevent further instances of antibiotic resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/events/2015/world-antibiotic-awareness-week/event/en/|title=World Antibiotic Awareness Week|website=World Health Organization|access-date=20 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120222039/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/events/2015/world-antibiotic-awareness-week/event/en/|archive-date=20 November 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

World Antibiotic Awareness Week has been held every November since 2015. For 2017, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) are together calling for responsible use of antibiotics in humans and animals to reduce the emergence of antibiotic resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/campaigns/world-antibiotic-awareness-week/2017/launch-event/en/|title=World Antibiotic Awareness Week|website=WHO|access-date=14 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113074006/http://www.who.int/campaigns/world-antibiotic-awareness-week/2017/launch-event/en/|archive-date=13 November 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms and organisms==

===Fundamentals===
[[File:mecA Resistance.svg|thumb|Diagram depicting antibiotic resistance through alteration of the antibiotic's target site, modeled after MRSA's resistance to penicillin. Beta-lactam antibiotics permanently inactivate [[Penicillin-binding protein|PBP enzymes]], which are essential for bacterial life, by permanently binding to their active sites. [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]], however, expresses a PBP that does not allow the antibiotic into its active site.|alt=Diagram depicting antibiotic resistance through alteration of the antibiotic's target site]]

The four main mechanisms by which microorganisms exhibit resistance to antimicrobials are:
# Drug inactivation or modification: for example, enzymatic deactivation of [[Penicillin|''penicillin'' G]] in some penicillin-resistant bacteria through the production of [[Beta-lactamases|β-lactamases]]. Most commonly, the protective enzymes produced by the bacterial cell will add an acetyl or phosphate group to a specific site on the antibiotic, which will reduce its ability to bind to the bacterial ribosomes and disrupt protein synthesis.&lt;ref name="Criswell, Daniel 2004"&gt;[Criswell, Daniel. "The "Evolution" of Antibiotic Resistance." Institute for Creation Research. N.p., 2004. Web. 28 Oct. 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Alteration of target- or binding site: for example, alteration of [[Penicillin binding protein|PBP]]—the binding target site of penicillins—in [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] and other penicillin-resistant bacteria. Another protective mechanism found among bacterial species is ribosomal protection proteins. These proteins protect the bacterial cell from antibiotics that target the cell’s ribosomes to inhibit protein synthesis. The mechanism involves the binding of the ribosomal protection proteins to the ribosomes of the bacterial cell, which in turn changes its conformational shape. This allows the ribosomes to continue synthesizing proteins essential to the cell while preventing antibiotics from binding to the ribosome to inhibit protein synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Connell SR, Tracz DM, Nierhaus KH, Taylor DE | title = Ribosomal protection proteins and their mechanism of tetracycline resistance | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | volume = 47 | issue = 12 | pages = 3675–81 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 14638464 | pmc = 296194 | doi = 10.1128/AAC.47.12.3675-3681.2003 | url = http://aac.asm.org/content/47/12/3675 | access-date = 14 June 2018 | dead-url = no | df = dmy-all | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180601200938/http://aac.asm.org/content/47/12/3675 | archive-date = 1 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Alteration of metabolic pathway: for example, some [[sulfa drugs|sulfonamide]]-resistant bacteria do not require [[para-aminobenzoic acid]] (PABA), an important precursor for the synthesis of [[folic acid]] and [[nucleic acid]]s in bacteria inhibited by sulfonamides, instead, like mammalian cells, they turn to using preformed folic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Henry|first=Richard J.|date=December 1943|title=THE MODE OF ACTION OF SULFONAMIDES *|pmc=440870|journal=Bacteriological Reviews|volume=7|issue=4|pages=175–262|issn=0005-3678|pmid=16350088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are often activated by a specific substrate associated with an antibiotic.&lt;ref&gt;[RI Aminov, RI Mackie. Evolution and ecology of antibiotic resistance genes.

[[File:Antibiotic resistance mechanisms.jpg|thumb|300x300px|A number of mechanisms used by common antibiotics to deal with bacteria and ways by which bacteria become resistant to them.|alt=Infographic showing mechanisms for antibiotic resistance]]

Antibiotic resistance can be a result of [[horizontal gene transfer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ochiai K, Yamanaka T, Kimura K, Sawada O, O | year = 1959 |title = Inheritance of drug resistance (and its transfer) between Shigella strains and Between Shigella and E.coli strains|journal= Hihon Iji Shimpor |page= 1861|volume= 34|language= Japanese|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also of unlinked point mutations in the [[pathogen]] [[genome]] at a rate of about 1 in 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; per chromosomal replication. Mutations are rare but the fact that bacteria reproduce at such a high rate allows for the effect to be significant. A mutation may produce a change in the binding site of the antibiotic, which may allow the site to continue proper functioning in the presence of the antibiotic or prevent the binding of the antibiotic to the site altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cirz RT, Chin JK, Andes DR, de Crécy-Lagard V, Craig WA, Romesberg FE | title = Inhibition of mutation and combating the evolution of antibiotic resistance | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | pages = e176 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15869329 | pmc = 1088971 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0030176 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antibiotic action against a pathogen can be seen as an environmental pressure. Those bacteria with a mutation that allows them to survive will reproduce, pass the trait to their offspring, which leads to the [[microevolution]] of a fully resistant colony. Chromosomal mutations providing antibiotic resistance benefit the bacteria but also confer a cost of fitness. For example, a ribosomal mutation may protect a bacterial cell by changing the binding site of an antibiotic but will also slow protein synthesis.&lt;ref name="Criswell, Daniel 2004" /&gt; manifesting, in slower growth rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Levin BR, Perrot V, Walker N | title = Compensatory mutations, antibiotic resistance and the population genetics of adaptive evolution in bacteria | journal = Genetics | volume = 154 | issue = 3 | pages = 985–97 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10757748 | pmc = 1460977 | url = http://www.genetics.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10757748 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Gram-negative bacteria, plasmid-mediated resistance genes produce proteins that can bind to [[DNA gyrase]], protecting it from the action of quinolones. Finally, mutations at key sites in DNA gyrase or [[topoisomerase IV]] can decrease their binding affinity to quinolones, decreasing the drug's effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Robicsek A, Jacoby GA, Hooper DC | title = The worldwide emergence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance | journal = The Lancet. Infectious Diseases | volume = 6 | issue = 10 | pages = 629–40 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 17008172 | doi = 10.1016/S1473-3099(06)70599-0 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bacteria===
[[File:Klebsiella pneumoniae 01.png|thumb|''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'', the bacterium in which NDM-1 was first identified.|alt=Magnified Klebsiella pneumoniae]]
{{Further|List of antibiotic resistant bacteria}}[[Bacteria]]&amp;nbsp;can often develop&amp;nbsp;[[antibiotic]]&amp;nbsp;resistance. [[Mutation]]s that confer increased survival are selected for in [[natural selection]], which can happen quickly in bacteria because lifespans and production of new generations can be on a timescale of mere hours. A new (de novo) mutation in a parent cell can quickly become an [[heredity|inherited]] mutation of widespread prevalence. Moreover, some adaptive mutations can propagate not only through inheritance but also through [[horizontal gene transfer]]. Very often this is done via [[plasmid]]s, however, through means of [[Transduction (genetics)]], [[Transformation (genetics)]] and chromosomal [[Conjugation (genetics)]], resistance genes residing on bacterial chromosomes can also be transferred. If the new DNA is maintained in the receiving bacterium, this transfer is followed by inheritance of the new resistance from parents to offspring.

Recent findings show no necessity of large populations of bacteria for the appearance of antibiotic resistance. Small populations of ''E. coli'' in an antibiotic gradient can become resistant. Any heterogeneous environment with respect to nutrient and antibiotic gradients may facilitate antibiotic resistance in small bacterial populations. Researchers hypothesize that the mechanism of resistance development is based on four SNP mutations in the genome of ''E. coli'' produced by the gradient of antibiotic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johansen TB, Scheffer L, Jensen VK, Bohlin J, Feruglio SL | title = Whole-genome sequencing and antimicrobial resistance in Brucella melitensis from a Norwegian perspective | language = En | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 8538 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 29867163 | pmc = 5986768 | doi = 10.1038/s41598-018-26906-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antibiotic resistance can be introduced artificially into a microorganism through laboratory protocols, sometimes used as a [[selectable marker]] to examine the mechanisms of gene transfer or to identify individuals that absorbed a piece of DNA that included the resistance gene and another gene of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chan CX, Beiko RG, Ragan MA | title = Lateral transfer of genes and gene fragments in Staphylococcus extends beyond mobile elements | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 193 | issue = 15 | pages = 3964–77 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21622749 | pmc = 3147504 | doi = 10.1128/JB.01524-10 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Viruses===
Specific [[antiviral drug]]s are used to treat some viral infections. These drugs prevent viruses from reproducing by inhibiting essential stages of the virus's replication cycle in infected cells. Antivirals are used to treat [[HIV]], [[hepatitis B]], [[hepatitis C]], [[influenza]], [[herpesviridae|herpes viruses]] including [[varicella zoster virus]], [[cytomegalovirus]] and [[Epstein-Barr virus]]. With each virus, some strains have become resistant to the administered drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lou Z, Sun Y, Rao Z | title = Current progress in antiviral strategies | journal = Trends in Pharmacological Sciences | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 86–102 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24439476 | doi = 10.1016/j.tips.2013.11.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Infections by fungi are a cause of high morbidity and mortality in [[Immunodeficiency|immunocompromised]] persons, such as those with HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis or receiving [[chemotherapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Xie JL, Polvi EJ, Shekhar-Guturja T, Cowen LE | title = Elucidating drug resistance in human fungal pathogens | journal = Future Microbiology | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 523–42 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24810351 | doi = 10.2217/fmb.14.18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fungi [[Candida (fungus)|candida]], ''[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]'' and ''[[Aspergillus fumigatus]]'' cause most of these infections and antifungal resistance occurs in all of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Srinivasan A, Lopez-Ribot JL, Ramasubramanian AK | title = Overcoming antifungal resistance | journal = Drug Discovery Today: Technologies | volume = 11 | pages = 65–71 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24847655 | pmc = 4031462 | doi = 10.1016/j.ddtec.2014.02.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Multidrug resistance in fungi is increasing because of the widespread use of antifungal drugs to treat infections in immunocompromised individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Costa C, Dias PJ, Sá-Correia I, Teixeira MC | title = MFS multidrug transporters in pathogenic fungi: do they have real clinical impact? | journal = Frontiers in Physiology | volume = 5 | pages = 197 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24904431 | pmc = 4035561 | doi = 10.3389/fphys.2014.00197 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of particular note, [[Fluconazole]]-resistant Candida species have been highlighted as a growing problem by the CDC.&lt;ref name="CDC2013" /&gt; More than 20 species of Candida can cause [[Candidiasis]] infection, the most common of which is ''[[Candida albicans]]''. Candida yeasts normally inhabit the skin and mucous membranes without causing infection. However, overgrowth of Candida can lead to Candidiasis. Some Candida strains are becoming resistant to first-line and second-line [[Antifungal|antifungal agents]] such as [[Azole#Use as anti-fungal agents|azoles]] and [[echinocandin]]s.&lt;ref name="CDC2013" /&gt;

===Parasites===

The [[protozoa]]n parasites that cause the diseases [[malaria]], [[trypanosomiasis]], [[toxoplasmosis]], [[cryptosporidiosis]] and [[leishmaniasis]] are important human pathogens.&lt;ref name="pmid25057459"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Andrews KT, Fisher G, Skinner-Adams TS | title = Drug repurposing and human parasitic protozoan diseases | journal = International Journal for Parasitology.

Malarial parasites that are resistant to the drugs that are currently available to infections are common and this has led to increased efforts to develop new drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Visser BJ, van Vugt M, Grobusch MP | title = Malaria: an update on current chemotherapy | journal = Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy | volume = 15 | issue = 15 | pages = 2219–54 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25110058 | doi = 10.1517/14656566.2014.944499 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Resistance to recently developed drugs such as [[artemisinin]] has also been reported. The problem of drug resistance in malaria has driven efforts to develop vaccines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chia WN, Goh YS, Rénia L | title = Novel approaches to identify protective malaria vaccine candidates | journal = Frontiers in Microbiology | volume = 5 | pages = 586 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25452745 | pmc = 4233905 | doi = 10.3389/fmicb.2014.00586 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Trypanosoma|Trypanosomes]] are parasitic protozoa that cause [[African trypanosomiasis]] and [[Chagas disease]]  (American trypanosomiasis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Franco JR, Simarro PP, Diarra A, Jannin JG | title = Epidemiology of human African trypanosomiasis | journal = Clinical Epidemiology | volume = 6 | pages = 257–75 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25125985 | pmc = 4130665 | doi = 10.2147/CLEP.S39728 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Herrera L | title = Trypanosoma cruzi, the Causal Agent of Chagas Disease: Boundaries between Wild and Domestic Cycles in Venezuela | journal = Frontiers in Public Health | volume = 2 | pages = 259 | date = 2014 | pmid = 25506587 | pmc = 4246568 | doi = 10.3389/fpubh.2014.00259 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no vaccines to prevent these infections so drugs such as [[pentamidine]] and [[suramin]], [[benznidazole]] and [[nifurtimox]] are used to treat infections. These drugs are effective but infections caused by resistant parasites have been reported.&lt;ref name="pmid25057459" /&gt;

[[Leishmaniasis]] is caused by protozoa and is an important public health problem worldwide, especially in sub-tropical and tropical countries. Drug resistance has "become a major concern".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mansueto P, Seidita A, Vitale G, Cascio A | title = Leishmaniasis in travelers: a literature review | journal = Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease | volume = 12 | issue = 6 Pt A | pages = 563–81 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25287721 | doi = 10.1016/j.tmaid.2014.09.007 | url = https://iris.unipa.it/bitstream/10447/101959/4/Travel%20Medicine%20and%20Infectious%20Disease%202014%2012%20563-581.pdf | hdl = 10447/101959 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The discovery of penicillin in 1928 and other antibiotics in the 20th century proved to be a significant medical achievement, saving millions of lives and significantly reducing the burden of infectious diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Adedeji WA | title = THE TREASURE CALLED ANTIBIOTICS | journal = Annals of Ibadan Postgraduate Medicine | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 56–57 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 28337088 | pmc = 5354621 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1950s to 1970s represented the golden age of antibiotic discovery, where countless new classes of antibiotics were discovered to treat previously incurable diseases such as tuberculosis and syphilis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aminov RI | title = A brief history of the antibiotic era: lessons learned and challenges for the future | language = English | journal = Frontiers in Microbiology | volume = 1 | pages = 134 | date = 2010 | pmid = 21687759 | pmc = 3109405 | doi = 10.3389/fmicb.2010.00134 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since that time the discovery of new classes of antibiotics has been almost nonexistent, and represents a situation that is especially problematic considering the resiliency of bacteria shown over time and the continued misuse and overuse of antibiotics in treatment.&lt;ref name="worldcat.org"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Antimicrobial resistance : global report on surveillance|others=World Health Organization,|isbn=9789241564748|location=Geneva, Switzerland|oclc=880847527|last1 = Organization|first1 = World Health|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon of antimicrobial resistance caused by overuse of antibiotics was predicted by [[Alexander Fleming]] who said "The time may come when penicillin can be bought by anyone in the shops. Then there is the danger that the ignorant man may easily under-dose himself and by exposing his microbes to nonlethal quantities of the drug make them resistant."&lt;ref&gt;Amábile-Cuevas CF, editor.

==Society and culture==
For the [[fiscal year]] 2016 budget, President Obama suggested to nearly double the amount of federal funding to "combat and prevent" antibiotic resistance to more than $1.2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/01/27/fact-sheet-president-s-2016-budget-proposes-historic-investment-combat-a President’s 2016 Budget Proposes Historic Investment to Combat Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria to Protect Public Health] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311113659/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/01/27/fact-sheet-president-s-2016-budget-proposes-historic-investment-combat-a |date=11 March 2015 }} The White House, Office of the Press Secretary, January 27, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Many international funding agencies like USAID, DFID, [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency|SIDA]] and [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] have pledged money for developing strategies to counter antimicrobial resistance.

Since the mid-1980s pharmaceutical companies have invested in medications for cancer or chronic disease that have greater potential to make money and have "de-emphasized or dropped development of antibiotics".&lt;ref name="NYT_jan_21_2016" /&gt; On January 20, 2016 at the [[World Economic Forum]] in [[Davos]], [[Switzerland]], more than "80 pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies" from around the world called for "transformational commercial models" at a global level to spur research and development on antibiotics and on the "enhanced use of diagnostic tests that can rapidly identify the infecting organism".&lt;ref name="NYT_jan_21_2016"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/business/to-fight-superbugs-drug-makers-call-for-incentives-to-develop-antibiotics.html?smid=tw-share | title=To Fight 'Superbugs,' Drug Makers Call for Incentives to Develop Antibiotics | publisher=New York Times | date=20 January 2016 | access-date=24 January 2016 | last=Pollack | first=Andrew | name-list-format=vanc | series=Davos 2016 Special Report | location=Davos, Switzerland | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424142407/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/business/to-fight-superbugs-drug-makers-call-for-incentives-to-develop-antibiotics.html?smid=tw-share | archive-date=24 April 2018 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal frameworks===
Some global health scholars have argued that a global, legal framework is needed to prevent and control antimicrobial resistance.&lt;ref name="A. Behdinan, S.J.

==== U.S. ====
On March 27, 2015, the [[White House]] released a comprehensive plan to address the increasing need for agencies to combat the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The Task Force for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria developed ''The National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria'' with the intent of providing a roadmap to guide the US in the antibiotic resistance challenge and with hopes of saving many lives. This plan outlines steps taken by the Federal government over the next five years needed in order to prevent and contain outbreaks of antibiotic-resistant infections; maintain the efficacy of antibiotics already on the market; and to help to develop future diagnostics, antibiotics, and vaccines.&lt;ref name="whitehouse.gov"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/03/27/fact-sheet-obama-administration-releases-national-action-plan-combat-ant|title=FACT SHEET: Obama Administration Releases National Action Plan to Combat Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria|website=whitehouse.gov|access-date=2015-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122075741/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/03/27/fact-sheet-obama-administration-releases-national-action-plan-combat-ant|archive-date=22 November 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Action Plan was developed around five goals with focuses on strengthening health care, public health veterinary medicine, agriculture, food safety and research, and manufacturing. These goals, as listed by the White House, are as follows:
* Slow the Emergence of Resistant Bacteria and Prevent the Spread of Resistant Infections
* Strengthen National One-Health Surveillance Efforts to Combat Resistance
* Advance Development and use of Rapid and Innovative Diagnostic Tests for Identification and Characterization of Resistant Bacteria
* Accelerate Basic and Applied Research and Development for New Antibiotics, Other Therapeutics, and Vaccines
* Improve International Collaboration and Capacities for Antibiotic Resistance Prevention, Surveillance, Control and Antibiotic Research and Development
The following are goals set to meet by 2020:&lt;ref name="whitehouse.gov"/&gt;
* Establishment of antimicrobial programs within acute care hospital settings
* Reduction of inappropriate antibiotic prescription and use by at least 50% in outpatient settings and 20% inpatient settings
* Establishment of State Antibiotic Resistance (AR) Prevention Programs in all 50 states
* Elimination of the use of medically important antibiotics for growth promotion in food-producing animals.

=== Policies ===
According to [[World Health Organization|WHO]] policymakers can help tackle resistance by strengthening resistance tracking and laboratory capacity; regulating and promoting appropriate use of medicines.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt; Policymakers and industry can help tackle resistance by: fostering innovation and research and development of new tools; promoting cooperation and information sharing among all stakeholders.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;

== Further research ==
It is unclear if rapid viral testing affects antibiotic use in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Doan Q, Enarson P, Kissoon N, Klassen TP, Johnson DW | title = Rapid viral diagnosis for acute febrile respiratory illness in children in the Emergency Department | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 9 | issue = 9 | pages = CD006452 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25222468 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006452.pub4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vaccines===
Microorganisms do not develop resistance to [[vaccine]]s because a vaccine enhances the body's immune system, whereas an antibiotic operates separately from the body's normal defenses. Furthermore, if the use of vaccines increases, there is evidence that antibiotic resistant strains of pathogens will decrease; the need for antibiotics will naturally decrease as vaccines prevent infection before it occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mishra RP, Oviedo-Orta E, Prachi P, Rappuoli R, Bagnoli F | title = Vaccines and antibiotic resistance | journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology | volume = 15 | issue = 5 | pages = 596–602 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22981392 | doi = 10.1016/j.mib.2012.08.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, new strains that escape immunity induced by vaccines may [[Evolution|evolve]]; for example, an updated [[influenza vaccine]] is needed each year.

While theoretically promising, antistaphylococcal vaccines have shown limited efficacy, because of immunological variation between ''Staphylococcus'' species, and the limited duration of effectiveness of the antibodies produced. Development and testing of more effective vaccines is underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homesteadschools.com/nursing/courses/Immunity/Chapter05.html|title=Immunity, Infectious Diseases, and Pandemics—What You Can Do|publisher=HomesteadSchools.com|access-date=2013-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203005320/http://www.homesteadschools.com/nursing/courses/Immunity/Chapter05.html|archive-date=3 December 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternating therapy===
Alternating therapy is a proposed method in which two or three antibiotics are taken in a rotation versus taking just one antibiotic such that bacteria resistant to one antibiotic are killed when the next antibiotic is taken. Studies have found that this method reduces the rate at which antibiotic resistant bacteria emerge in vitro relative to a single drug for the entire duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim S, Lieberman TD, Kishony R | title = Alternating antibiotic treatments constrain evolutionary paths to multidrug resistance | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 40 | pages = 14494–9 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25246554 | pmc = 4210010 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1409800111 | bibcode = 2014PNAS..11114494K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the discovery of antibiotics, [[research and development]] (R&amp;D) efforts have provided new drugs in time to treat bacteria that became resistant to older antibiotics, but in the 2000s there has been concern that development has slowed enough that seriously ill people may run out of treatment options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu J, Bedell TA, West JG, Sorensen EJ | title = Design and Synthesis of Molecular Scaffolds with Anti-infective Activity | journal = Tetrahedron | volume = 72 | issue = 25 | pages = 3579–3592 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27284210 | pmc = 4894353 | doi = 10.1016/j.tet.2016.01.044 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wp.dh.gov.uk/publications/files/2013/03/CMO-Annual-Report-Volume-2-20111.pdf |title=Annual Report of the Chief Medical Officer - Infections and the rise of antimicrobial resistance|date=2011|publisher=UK NHS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030190650/http://media.dh.gov.uk/network/357/files/2013/03/CMO-Annual-Report-Volume-2-20111.pdf|archive-date=30 October 2013|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another concern is that doctors may become reluctant to perform routine surgeries because of the increased risk of harmful infection.&lt;ref name="obama"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/06/04/188380562/obama-administration-seeks-to-loosen-antibiotic-approvals|title=Obama Administration Seeks To Ease Approvals For Antibiotics|date=4 June 2013|publisher=NPR|access-date=7 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313042023/http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/06/04/188380562/obama-administration-seeks-to-loosen-antibiotic-approvals|archive-date=13 March 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Backup treatments can have serious side-effects; for example, treatment of [[multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis]] can cause deafness or psychological disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/06/04/188566805/moldova-grapples-with-whether-to-isolate-tb-patients|title=Moldova Grapples With Whether To Isolate TB Patients|date=4 June 2013|publisher=NPR|access-date=7 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803104507/http://www.npr.org/2013/06/04/188566805/moldova-grapples-with-whether-to-isolate-tb-patients|archive-date=3 August 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The potential crisis at hand is the result of a marked decrease in industry R&amp;D.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-21737844|title=BBC News&amp;nbsp;— Antibiotics resistance 'as big a risk as terrorism' – medical chief|last=Walsh|first=Fergus|name-list-format=vanc|publisher=Bbc.co.uk|access-date=2013-03-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180808002730/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-21737844|archive-date=8 August 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Poor financial investment in antibiotic research has exacerbated the situation.&lt;ref name="TheRealNews-2014-05-18"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=11872 | title = Why Are Antibiotics Becoming Useless All Over the World? | first = Martin | last = Khor | name-list-format = vanc | author-link = Martin Khor | date = 2014-05-18 | publisher = [[The Real News]] | access-date = 2014-05-18 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140518173348/http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=11872 | archive-date = 18 May 2014 | dead-url = no | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; The pharmaceutical industry has little incentive to invest in antibiotics because of the high risk and because the potential financial returns are less likely to cover the cost of [[drug development|development]] than for other pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Antibiotic Resistance: Why Aren't Drug Companies Developing New Medicines to Stop Superbugs?|last = Nordrum | first =  Amy | name-list-format = vanc | publisher = International Business Times|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[Pfizer]], one of the last major pharmaceutical companies developing new antibiotics, shut down its primary research effort, citing poor shareholder returns relative to drugs for chronic illnesses.&lt;ref name="medpage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/InfectiousDisease/GeneralInfectiousDisease/24708|title=Pfizer Moves May Dim Prospect for New Antibiotics|last=Gever|first=John|name-list-format=vanc|date=2011-02-04|publisher=MedPage Today|access-date=2013-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214004508/http://www.medpagetoday.com/InfectiousDisease/GeneralInfectiousDisease/24708 |archive-date=14 December 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, small and medium-sized pharmaceutical companies are still active in antibiotic drug research.

In the United States, drug companies and the administration of President [[Barack Obama]] have been proposing changing the standards by which the FDA approves antibiotics targeted at resistant organisms.&lt;ref name="obama" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ledford H | title = FDA under pressure to relax drug rules | journal = Nature | volume = 492 | issue = 7427 | pages = 19 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23222585 | doi = 10.1038/492019a | bibcode = 2012Natur.492...19L }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 12 December 2013, the Antibiotic Development to Advance Patient Treatment (ADAPT) Act of 2013 was introduced in the [[U.S. Congress]]. The ADAPT Act aims to fast-track the drug development in order to combat the growing public health threat of 'superbugs'. Under this Act, the FDA can approve antibiotics and antifungals needed for life-threatening infections based on data from smaller clinical trials. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) will reinforce the monitoring of the use of antibiotics that treat serious and life-threatening infections and the emerging resistance, and make the data publicly available. The FDA antibiotics labeling process, 'Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria for Microbial Organisms' or 'breakpoints' is also streamlined to allow the most up-to-date and cutting-edge data available to healthcare professionals under the new Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://green.house.gov/press-release/green-gingrey-introduce-adapt-act-safeguard-public-health|title=Green, Gingrey Introduce ADAPT Act to Safeguard Public Health|author=Press Release|date=12 December 2013|publisher=U.S. Congress|access-date=19 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220023844/http://green.house.gov/press-release/green-gingrey-introduce-adapt-act-safeguard-public-health|archive-date=20 December 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/lifesciences/HR3742.pdf|title=Antibiotic Development to Advance Patient Treatment Act of 2013|date=12 December 2013|publisher=U.S. Congress|access-date=19 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303233910/http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/lifesciences/HR3742.pdf|archive-date=3 March 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the proposals:
* Create a 'robust, standing national clinical trials network for antibiotic testing' which will promptly enroll patients once identified to be suffering from dangerous bacterial infections.  The network will allow testing multiple new agents from different companies simultaneously for their safety and efficacy.
* Establish a 'Special Medical Use (SMU)' pathway for FDA to approve new antimicrobial agents for use in limited patient populations, shorten the approval timeline for new drug so patients with severe infections could benefit as quickly as possible.
* Provide economic incentives, especially for development of new classes of antibiotics, to offset the steep R&amp;D costs which drive away the industry to develop antibiotics.

Phage therapy relies on the use of naturally-occurring bacteriophages to infect and lyse bacteria at the site of infection in a host. Due to current advances in genetics and biotechnology these bacteriophages can possibly be manufactured to treat specific infections.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lin DM, Koskella B, Lin HC | title = Phage therapy: An alternative to antibiotics in the age of multi-drug resistance | journal = World Journal of Gastrointestinal Pharmacology and Therapeutics | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 162–173 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28828194 | pmc = 5547374 | doi = 10.4292/wjgpt.v8.i3.162 | url = http://www.wjgnet.com/2150-5349/full/v8/i3/162.htm | access-date = 23 April 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180424135945/https://www.wjgnet.com/2150-5349/full/v8/i3/162.htm | archive-date = 24 April 2018 | dead-url = no | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phages can be bioengineered to target multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, and their use involves the added benefit of preventing the elimination of beneficial bacteria in the human body.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Phages destroy bacterial cell walls and membrane through the use of lytic proteins which kill bacteria by making many holes from the inside out.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Salmond GP, Fineran PC | title = A century of the phage: past, present and future | language = En | journal = Nature Reviews.

Contraceptive use in [[developing countries]] is estimated to have decreased the number of [[maternal death]]s by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% of deaths if the full demand for birth control were met.&lt;ref name="pmid22784533" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22784531" /&gt; These benefits are achieved by reducing the number of unplanned pregnancies that subsequently result in unsafe abortions and by preventing pregnancies in those at high risk.&lt;ref name="pmid22784533" /&gt;

Birth control also improves child survival in the developing world by lengthening the time between pregnancies.&lt;ref name="pmid22784533" /&gt; In this population, outcomes are worse when a mother gets pregnant within eighteen months of a previous delivery.&lt;ref name="pmid22784533" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Shol2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sholapurkar|first=SL|title=Is there an ideal interpregnancy interval after a live birth, miscarriage or other adverse pregnancy outcomes?|journal=Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology|date=February 2010|volume=30|issue=2|pages=107–10|pmid=20143964|doi=10.3109/01443610903470288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delaying another pregnancy after a [[miscarriage]] however does not appear to alter risk and women are advised to attempt pregnancy in this situation whenever they are ready.&lt;ref name=Shol2010 /&gt;

The National Birth Control Association was founded in Britain in 1931, and became the [[Family Planning Association]] eight years later. The Association amalgamated several British birth control-focused groups into 'a central organisation' for administering and overseeing birth control in Britain. The group incorporated the Birth Control Investigation Committee, a collective of physicians and scientists that was founded to investigate scientific and medical aspects of contraception with 'neutrality and impartiality'.&lt;ref&gt;BCIC Memorandum on Proposed Re-organisation [c.1931]. Wellcome Library, Archives of the Eugenics Society (WL/SA/EUG/D/12/12.)&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the Association effected a series of [[pure science|'pure']] and [[Applied science|'applied']] product and safety standards that manufacturers must meet to ensure their contraceptives could be prescribed as part of the Association's standard two-part-technique combining ‘a rubber appliance to protect the mouth of the womb’ with a ‘chemical preparation capable of destroying... sperm’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wright |first1=Helena |title=Birth Control: Advice on Family Spacing and Healthy Sex Life |date=1935 |publisher=Cassell's Health Handbooks |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1931 and 1959, the Association founded and funded a series of tests to assess chemical efficacy and safety and rubber quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=SZUHAN |first1=NATASHA |title=Sex in the laboratory: the Family Planning Association and contraceptive science in Britain, 1929–1959 |journal=The British Journal for the History of Science |date=28 June 2018 |pages=1–24 |doi=10.1017/S0007087418000481}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tests became the basis for the Association's Approved List of contraceptives, which was launched in 1937, and went on to become an annual publication that the expanding network of FPA clinics relied upon as a means to 'establish facts [about contraceptives] and to publish these facts as a basis on which a sound public and scientific opinion can be built'.&lt;ref&gt;Birth Control Investigation Committee Statement of Intent [c.1927], Wellcome Library, Archives of the Family Planning Association (WL/SA/FPA), WL/SA/FPA/A13/5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936 the U.S. court ruled in U.S. v. One Package that medically prescribing contraception to save a person's life or well-being was not illegal under the [[Comstock Law]]; following this decision, the [[American Medical Association]] Committee on Contraception revoked its 1936 statement condemning birth control. A national survey in 1937 showed 71 percent of the adult population supported the use of contraception. By 1938 347 birth control clinics were running in the United States despite their advertisement still being illegal. [[First Lady]] [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] publicly supported birth control and family planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alesha Doan|title=Opposition and Intimidation: The Abortion Wars and Strategies of Political Harassment|date=2007|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-06975-0|pages=53–54|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, [[Lyndon B.

[[Human rights]] agreements require most governments to provide family planning and contraceptive information and services.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="hrintlaw" /&gt; --&gt; These include the requirement to create a national plan for family planning services, remove laws that limit access to family planning, ensure that a wide variety of safe and effective birth control methods are available including emergency contraceptives, make sure there are appropriately trained healthcare providers and facilities at an affordable price, and create a process to review the programs implemented.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="hrintlaw" /&gt; --&gt; If governments fail to do the above it may put them in breach of binding international treaty obligations.&lt;ref name="hrintlaw"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cottingham J. |author2=Germain A. |author3=Hunt P. | year = 2012 |title = Use of human rights to meet the unmet need for family planning | url = | journal = The Lancet | volume = 380 | issue = 9837| pages = 172–180 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60732-6 | pmid = 22784536 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the 1965 Supreme Court decision ''[[Griswold v.

Since at least the 1870s, American religious, medical, legislative, and legal commentators have debated contraception laws. Ana Garner and Angela Michel have found that in these discussions men often attach reproductive rights to moral and political matters, as part of an ongoing attempt to regulate human bodies. In press coverage between 1873–2013 they found a divide between institutional ideology and real-life experiences of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garner|first1=A. C.|last2=Michel|first2=A.

'''Calvin C.J.

The Hawaii Healthy Start program, which targets expecting and new parents who may be at risk of abusing or neglecting their children, became the model for the Healthy Families America home visiting program that the [[United States Department of Justice]]'s [[Office of Justice Programs]] identified in 2010 as a "promising" approach to child abuse prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crimesolutions.gov/ProgramDetails.aspx?ID=200 |title=Program: Healthy Families America |publisher=CrimeSolutions.gov |date=2011-09-23 |accessdate=2015-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Healthy and Ready to Learn Center was a three-year pilot project to initiate training and health delivery services in an integrated system of care, with pediatric residents and graduate students in social work and early childhood education working as a team.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clas.uiuc.edu/fulltext/cl00910/cl00910.html|title=CLAS: Building Bridges: Lessons Learned in Interprofessional Collaboration|publisher=Clas.uiuc/edu|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Sia spearheaded the creation of the Variety School for learning disabled children, a Honolulu-based educational institution for children ages 5 through 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://varietyschool.org/about.html|title=Variety School of Hawaii|publisher=Varietyschool.org|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sia retired from his Honolulu-based medical practice in 1996, after almost 40 years of treating patients,&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/96/10/30/news/story2.html|title=The godfather and the grandfather|last=Altonn|first=Helen|date=October 30, 1996|website=|publisher=Archives.starbulletin.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but continues to promote Medical Home and community pediatrics as professor of Pediatrics at the [[University of Hawaii]] [[John A.

==Education==
Sia is a 1945 graduate of [[Punahou School]] in [[Honolulu]] and a graduate of [[Dartmouth College]] in 1950. He received his medical degree at [[Western Reserve University School of Medicine]] in 1955 and did a general rotating internship as a lieutenant in the [[U.S. Army Medical Corps]] at [[William Beaumont Army Hospital]] in El Paso, Texas from 1955-1956. Sia then served his pediatric residency under Dr. Irvine McQuarrie at Kauikeolani Children's Hospital in Honolulu,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/90/3/419|title=Abraham Jacobi Award Address, April 14, 1992 The Medical Home: Pediatric Practice and Child Advocacy in the 1990s|publisher=Pediatrics.aappublications.org|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and obtained his license to practice medicine in Hawaii in 1958. He was certified by the American Board of Pediatrics in 1960 and recertified in 1987. The [[University of Hawaii]] awarded Sia an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hawaii.edu/offices/bor/honorary.php|title=Honorary degrees conferred by the University of Hawaii|publisher=Hawaii.edu|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public service==

===Early years===
As a young practicing pediatrician, Sia joined the early cadre of American Academy of Pediatrics consultants for Head Start and Parent Child Centers in Hawaii in the 1960s and developed a strong interest in prenatal, neonatal, and postnatal causes of physical and mental disabilities in children. In a paper he presented in 1964 to the Hawaii Academy of Sciences on advances in neonatology, Sia cited progress in the care of premature babies but also noted that "completeness" of the first physical exam and the education of nurses to be on the alert for early signs of disabilities were possible ways to save newborns with previously lethal birth defects. He concluded by observing, "One of the basic problems will be in solving the causes and prevention of prematurity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sia|first=Calvin C.J.|date=1964|title=Advances in neonatology|url=https://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10524/2159/PHAS1964.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the Hawaiian Academy of Science|volume=|pages=16-17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by one of his mentors, Dr. Robert E. Cooke, the Johns Hopkins pediatrician behind the creation of the Hopkins hospital's Kennedy Institute for Handicapped Children, Sia helped establish Hawaii's Variety School for Learning Disabilities in 1967 and served as chairman of its board of directors for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaiiaap.org/pdfs/AAP%20Member%20Spotlight%20Article%20-%20Sia_HS%203%202010_1_.pdf |format=PDF |title=Calvin C.J. Sia, MD, FAAP - Resume |publisher=Hawaiiaap.org |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sia broadened the scope of his community work to address all children with special health care needs. In the early 1970s, he invited Dr. [[C. Henry Kempe]], founder of the Denver-based National Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Child Abuse and Neglect, and Dr. Ray E. Helfer of Michigan—two pioneers in the identification and treatment of child abuse—to help him and a small group of child advocates develop a plan to prevent and treat child abuse and neglect in the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/txtfiles/hawaiihs.txt |format=TXT |title=Helping to Prevent Child Abuse -- and Future Criminal Consequences: Hawai'i Healthy Start |publisher=Ncjrs.org |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; That effort netted one of the first 12 demonstration grant awards by the newly created National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect in 1975, with $1 million going to establish the first Hawaii Family Stress Center. The center, later renamed the Hawaii Family Support Center, established several child abuse and neglect programs on Oahu, including a home-visiting program based on Kempe's effective use of "lay therapists." These were home visitors from the community, properly trained and supervised by public health nurses and social workers who could earn the trust of at-risk families and focus on family strengths to reduce environmental risk and prevent child abuse and neglect.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{cite web|url=http://futureofchildren.org/publications/journals/article/index.xml?journalid=49&amp;articleid=246&amp;sectionid=1609|title= - The Future of Children -|author=Princeton University|publisher=Futureofchildren.org|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="princeton.edu"&gt;The Future of Children (Princeton University-Brookings Institution), Home Visiting: Recent Program Evaluations, "Evaluation of Hawaii's Healthy Start Program," by Anne K. Duggan, Sc.D, et al., Vol. 9 No. 1, Spring-Summer 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The center's goal was to identify vulnerable families before their day-to-day stresses, isolation, and lack of parenting knowledge and good role models gave rise to abusive and neglectful behavior.

The center's operations coincided with an effort launched by Dr. Vince L. Hutchins and Dr. Merle McPherson of the Maternal and Child Health Bureau in 1977 to revise and update the
mission of the federal agency's Title V and companion "crippled children's" programs to address child development and the prevention of developmental, behavioral and psychosocial problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fv-ncfpp.org/index.php/download_file/view/465/95/ |format=PDF |title=Celebrate 2010 |publisher=Fv-ncfpp.org |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; McPherson took note of Sia's call for a continuous system of care originating with the primary care pediatrician.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/113/Supplement_4/1473.long|title=History of the Medical Home Concept|work=aappublications.org|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AAP collaborated in this effort by asking each state’s AAP chapter to develop a Child Health Plan that set priorities for using MCHB block grants. Sia spearheaded the Hawaii planning effort, bringing together representatives from the Hawaii AAP Chapter, the UH medical school, the Hawaii Medical Association, and [[Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children]]. Armed with anecdotal evidence showing home visitors were able to promote
effective parenting and ultimately improve outcomes, the group wrote a plan that incorporated a coordinated system of care that emphasized wellness and prevention for
children, especially those with special needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journals.lww.com/iycjournal/Abstract/2003/10000/Building_Medical_Homes_for_Children_With_Special.6.aspx|title=Building Medical Homes for Children With Special Health Care... : Infants &amp; Young Children|work=LWW|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the birth of the Medical Home concept for primary care,&lt;ref&gt;[http://facm.unjbg.edu.pe/revistaspediatria/Clinical%20Pediatrics/2009/August/16%20The%20Medical%20Home-Improving%20Quality%20of%20Primary%20Care%20for%20Children.pdf] {{dead link|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to which Sia attached the slogan, “Every Child Deserves a Medical Home.” Under this idea, which the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] adopted as a policy statement in 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/110/1/184|title=The Medical Home|work=aappublications.org|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the medical care of all infants, children and adolescents should be accessible, continuous, comprehensive, family-centered, coordinated, compassionate, and culturally effective.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amchp.org/AboutAMCHP/Newsletters/Pulse/Archive/2010/April2010/Pages/article.aspx|title=From the Presidents|publisher=Amchp.org|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be delivered or directed by well-trained physicians who provide primary care and help to manage and facilitate essentially all aspects of pediatric care. The physician should be known to the child and family and should be able to develop a partnership of mutual responsibility and trust with them. As Sia and his co-authors of a 2006 monograph on the Medical Home noted, this new model broadens the traditional focus on acute care to include prevention and well care at one end of the continuum and chronic care management of children with special health care needs at the other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aap.org/commpeds/CPTI/MedicalHome2006.pdf]{{dead link|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nccic.acf.hhs.gov/node/33969|title=The Medical Home and Early Child Development in Primary Care|last=|first=|date=2006|website=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027080143/http://nccic.acf.hhs.gov/node/33969|archivedate=October 27, 2011|deadurl=yes|accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One expert observed, for example, that for a child born with [[spina bifida]], Sia's Medical Home model would have the family and its health care provider compose a list of specialists and therapists who would be caring for the child and a timeline of anticipated surgeries and interventions. The aim would be to have as few emergencies and unanticipated events as possible.&lt;ref name="Palfrey" /&gt;

As the lead author of an often-cited article published by the journal [[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] in May 2004, Sia traced the development of the Medical Home concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/113/Supplement_4/1473.long|title=History of the Medical Home Concept|author=Calvin Sia|publisher=Pedriatrics.aappublications.org|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pilot programs===
By 1984, Sia had begun to implement the Medical Home concept in Hawaii. As chairman of an ad hoc state legislative task force on child abuse, he persuaded Hawaii lawmakers to authorize the Hawaii Healthy Start Home Visiting Program for the prevention of child abuse and neglect.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; This state-funded pilot program, carried out by Hawaii Family Support Center in collaboration with the Hawaii Department of Health, focused on a neighborhood in the Ewa community on Oahu, a community with relatively high rates of child abuse and neglect.&lt;ref name="princeton.edu"/&gt; A year later, he spearheaded the Hawaii Medical Association's effort to obtain a grant from the U.S. [[Maternal and Child Health Bureau]], under the Special Projects of Regional and National Significance (SPRANS) initiative,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://perfdata.hrsa.gov/mchb/mchreports/LEARN_More/Block_Grant_Program/block_grant_program.asp|title=Block Grant Program|last=|first=|date=|website=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115044032/https://perfdata.hrsa.gov/mchb/mchreports//LEARN_More/Block_Grant_Program/block_grant_program.asp|archivedate=January 15, 2009|deadurl=yes|accessdate=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to train primary care physicians to provide a "Medical Home" for all children with special health care needs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/113/Supplement_4/1473.full.pdf |format=PDF |title=History of the Medical Home Concept |publisher=Pediatrics.aappublications.org |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstration project—which sought to help first-time families give their newborn children the best start in life—was so successful it was expanded from a small part of [[Oahu]] to other areas of Hawaii, and as word of the demonstrated positive outcomes spread, Hawaii’s Healthy Start became a model for parenting education programs nationwide.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; In the early 1990s, Healthy Families America and the National Healthy Start Association began to standardize and credential programs to ensure effectiveness and research-based practices. Across the United States, according to the MCHB, the home visiting program has shown that it can reduce child maltreatment and increase children’s readiness for school.

Meanwhile, Sia launched the Hawaii Early Intervention Program for infants and toddlers in 1986 and also became actively involved with Hawaii’s Early Intervention Coordinating Council for Zero to Three, placing this under Hawaii’s Department of Health instead of the Department of Education.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt;  The focus of this effort was to support the Medical Home system of care with prevention and early intervention programs.

===Implementation===
At a June 1987 conference called by [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] [[C. Everett Koop]] and sponsored by the AAP and MCHB to address children with special needs, Sia and his delegation from Hawaii made a presentation of the Medical Home concept. Koop appeared to embrace it by issuing a report that endorsed a system of family-centered, community-based, coordinated care for children with special needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/83/6/1055|title=Family-Centered, Community-Based, Coordinated Care for Children With Special Health Care Needs|author=Earl J. Brewer Jr|publisher=Pedriatics.aappublications.org|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in 1989 by the first National Medical Home Conference, which drew 26 AAP state chapters to Hawaii for presentations organized by Sia and MCHB officials on how to train pediatricians in the Medical Home system of care. This led to consultations to introduce the Medical Home training program to interdisciplinary teams of pediatricians, families, and other health care–related professionals in Florida, Minnesota, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Washington and other states.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The pace of activity prompted Sia to close his private medical practice in 1996 so he could devote his time as principal investigator on various early childhood grant projects promoting the Medical Home and its integrated system of care. He launched several initiatives with a MCHB Health Education Collaboration grant in support of interprofessional training in early childhood, a [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] Starting Points planning grant in early childhood, and Consuelo Foundation of Hawaii's Healthy and Ready to Learn grant–all with the emphasis on integrating the continuum of care of the Medical Home with other health, family, and community services from a holistic approach.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; The MCHB funding enabled him to travel across the country to promote the Medical Home concept to various
communities, state AAP chapters, family advocacy groups and state Title V maternal and child health officers.

A three-year pilot project creating a Healthy and Ready to Learn Center in Hawaii began in 1992 and helped gauge the effectiveness of Sia's family-centered interprofessional collaboration approach.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; Lessons learned from this project were subsequently adopted by the Office of Children and Youth of the Governor's Office of Hawaii with Sia as Co-Principal Investigator.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; The Carnegie Corp. Starting Points grant then was assumed by the Good Beginnings Alliance in Hawaii.

Sia, serving as chairman of the American Medical Association's Section Council on Pediatrics and other AMA- and AAP-related posts, used those platforms and his network of contacts with other groups to help introduce the Medical Home concept into the care of adults&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/ehc/products/391/1177/EvidenceReport208_ClosingTheQualityGap-Patient-Centered-Medical-Home_ExecutiveSummary_20120703.pdf |format=PDF |title=2. The Patient-Centered Medical Home Closing the Quality Gap: Revisiting the State of the Science : Executive Summary |publisher=Effectibvehealthcare.ahrq.gov |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as children, although his primary focus has remained on pediatric care. In 2007, the AAP, American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of Physicians and the [[American Osteopathic Association]] adopted the Joint Principles of the Patient-Centered Medical Home that set a standard definition of a Medical Home. A year later, the AMA adopted the principles, which have since received support from over 700 member organizations of the [[Patient Centered Primary Care Collaborative]], including primary care and specialty care societies, all major health plans and consumer organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nccp.org/publications/pdf/text_1041.pdf |format=PDF |title=Pediatric Medical Homes : Laying the Foundation of a Promising Model of Care |publisher=Nccp.org |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the term Medical Home now regularly shows up in the literature of parent groups such as Family Voices, in family practice journals and on the websites of state public health and medical agencies.&lt;ref name="Palfrey" /&gt;

===Focus on Asia===

Beginning in 2000, Sia expanded his efforts related to early child development and the Medical Home to Asia. In 2003, he created the Asia-US Partnership, a think tank based at the University of Hawaii medical school whose mission is to improve child health in Asia and the United States through cross-cultural
exchanges with leaders in pediatrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cds.hawaii.edu/sites/default/files/downloads/ausp/ausp1/pdf/AUSP1_report.pdf |format=PDF |title=Early Child Development in Primary Care |publisher=Cds.hawaii.edu |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Sia initiated and chaired the first of several AUSP Early Child Development and Primary Care conferences, bringing together pediatric and early childhood development experts from Asia and the United States to translate the science of early child development into policy and action. Participants have come from China (Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong), the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand and the United States. According to conference reports, these international exchanges have stimulated translation of the science on early child development and primary care into action programs in the broad areas of advocacy, service delivery, research, and training among the Asian early childhood professionals leadership.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Sia has continued to serve as co-chairman of these events, including the sixth international conference, held in the Philippines capital of Manila, in May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cds.hawaii.edu/sites/default/files/downloads/ausp/ausp6/pdf/AUSPVI_BriefingBook.pdf |format=PDF |title=Briefing Book : Asia-US Partnership 2011 : Early Childhood Development in Primary Care |publisher=Cds.hawaii.edu |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; After hosting the earliest AUSP conferences in Hawaii, Sia decided to move the 2009 event to Shanghai and tapped a team of Chinese doctors to serve as conference host, signaling what he called a new phase of activity aimed at developing greater shared leadership and stronger "country teams."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cds.hawaii.edu/sites/default/files/downloads/ausp/ausp5/pdf/AUSPV_FinalReport.pdf |format=PDF |title=Asia-US Partnership 2011 : Early Childhood Development in Primary Care |publisher=Cds.hawaii.edu |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pediatric emergency medicine===
While planting the seeds of the Medical Home concept in Hawaii, Sia embarked on a related advocacy campaign focused on emergency care for children. In 1979, as president of the Hawaii Medical Association, Sia urged members of the American Academy of Pediatrics to develop multifaceted Emergency Medical Services programs designed to decrease disability and death in children. By January 1981, AAP's Executive Board had approved formation of a Section on Emergency Medicine, with Sia as one of its seven charter members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.aap.org/sections/pem/25AnniversaryBookletFinal.pdf |format=PDF |title=The AAP Section on Emergency Medicine |publisher=2.aap.org |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He along with José B. Lee then-executive officer of the Hawaii Medical Association Emergency Medical Services Program began working closely with Senator [[Daniel Inouye]], whom he happened to meet on a flight to Washington, D.C.,&lt;ref name="Palfrey" /&gt; to create a National Emergency Medical Services for Children System ([[Emergency Medical Services for Children|EMSC]]) demonstration grant program to address acute injuries, illnesses and other childhood crises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oDI8Rxe34U8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=snippet&amp;q=Calvin%20Sia&amp;f=false|title=APLS : the Pediatric Emergency Medicine Resource|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was launched after the October 1984 enactment of EMSC legislation (Public Law 98-555), a bipartisan measure sponsored by Inouye and Republican Senators [[Orrin Hatch]] of Utah and [[Lowell Weicker]] of Connecticut and endorsed by Surgeon General C. Everett Koop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.ny.gov/nysdoh/ems/emsc/index.htm|title=Emergency Medical Services for Children (EMSC)|publisher=Health.ny.gov|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childrensnational.org/files/PDF/EMSC/EMSC_An_Historical_Perspective.pdf|title=EMSC: an historical perspective|last=|first=|date=|website=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203204651/http://www.childrensnational.org/files/PDF/EMSC/EMSC_An_Historical_Perspective.pdf|archivedate=February 3, 2012|deadurl=yes|accessdate=February 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; States receiving these demonstration grants established an emergency medical care service system for children that upgraded training and equipment for first responders and emergency departments to treat children. Hawaii ultimately received a grant to initiate its own emergency care system for children, which improved care coordination with the primary care physician. EMSC is now an established statewide system of care for children in all 50 states and territories.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

'''[[Case mix]] index''' (CMI) is a relative value assigned to a [[diagnosis-related group]] of patients in a medical care environment. The CMI value is used in determining the allocation of resources to care for and/or treat the patients in the group.

==Resource Use Groups==

Patients are classified into groups having the same condition (based on main and secondary diagnosis, procedures, age), complexity ([[comorbidity]]) and needs. These groups are known as Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG), or Resource Use Groups (RUG).

Each DRG has a relative average value assigned to it that indicates the amount of resources required to treat patients in the group, as compared to all the other diagnosis-related groups within the system. The relative average value assigned to each group is its CMI.

==Hospital CMI==

The CMI of a hospital reflects the diversity, clinical complexity and the needs for resources in the population of all the patients in the hospital. 

The CMI value of a hospital can be used to adjust the average cost per patient (or per day) for a given hospital relative to the adjusted average cost for other hospitals by dividing the average cost per patient (or day) by the hospital's calculated CMI. The adjusted average cost per patient would reflect the charges reported for the types of cases treated in that year. If a hospital has a CMI greater than 1.00, their adjusted cost per patient or per day will be lower and conversely if a hospital has a CMI less than 1.00, their adjusted cost will be higher.

'''''Example:'''''

A link to the 2011 spreadsheet of the CMI for all US providers is located here
[http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/AcuteInpatientPPS/FY-2011-IPPS-Final-Rule-Home-Page-Items/CMS1237932.html]

An analysis of that file shows that there are 3619 hospital records. The number of cases for the hospitals ranges from a low of 1 to a high of 36,282 cases at Florida Hospital in Orlando, FL (Medicare ID 100007). That hospital has a Case Mix Index of 1.57. The mean number of cases across all the hospitals in the database is 3,098 with a standard deviation of 3,102.  As far as the Case Mix Index, the average is 1.37 with a minimum of .58 and a max of 3.73 and a standard deviation of 0.31.

'''Chemotherapy''' (often abbreviated to '''chemo''' and sometimes '''CTX''' or '''CTx''') is a type of [[cancer treatment]] that uses one or more anti-cancer drugs ([[list of chemotherapeutic agents|chemotherapeutic agents]]) as part of a standardized [[chemotherapy regimen]]. Chemotherapy may be given with a [[cure|curative]] intent (which almost always involves combinations of drugs), or it may aim to prolong life or to [[Palliative care|reduce symptoms]] (palliative chemotherapy). Chemotherapy is one of the major categories of the medical discipline specifically devoted to [[pharmacotherapy]] for [[cancer]], which is called [[oncology#Specialties|''medical oncology'']].

The term ''chemotherapy'' has come to connote non-specific usage of intracellular [[poison]]s to inhibit [[mitosis]], cell division. The connotation excludes more selective agents that block extracellular signals ([[signal transduction]]). The development of therapies with specific molecular or genetic targets, which inhibit growth-promoting signals from classic endocrine hormones (primarily [[estrogen]]s for breast cancer and [[androgen]]s for prostate cancer) are now called [[hormonal therapy (oncology)|hormonal therapies]]. By contrast, other inhibitions of growth-signals like those associated with [[receptor tyrosine kinase]]s are referred to as [[targeted therapy]].

Importantly, the use of drugs (whether chemotherapy, hormonal therapy or targeted therapy) constitutes ''systemic therapy'' for cancer in that they are introduced into the blood stream and are therefore in principle able to address cancer at any anatomic location in the body. Systemic therapy is often used in conjunction with other modalities that constitute ''local therapy'' (i.e. treatments whose efficacy is confined to the anatomic area where they are applied) for cancer such as [[radiation therapy]], [[surgery]] or [[hyperthermia therapy]].

Traditional chemotherapeutic agents are [[cytotoxicity|cytotoxic]] by means of interfering with cell division (mitosis) but cancer cells vary widely in their susceptibility to these agents. To a large extent, chemotherapy can be thought of as a way to damage or stress cells, which may then lead to cell death if [[apoptosis]] is initiated. Many of the side effects of chemotherapy can be traced to damage to normal cells that divide rapidly and are thus sensitive to anti-mitotic drugs: cells in the [[bone marrow]], [[digestive tract]] and [[hair follicle]]s. This results in the most common side-effects of chemotherapy: [[myelosuppression]] (decreased production of blood cells, hence also [[immunosuppression]]), [[mucositis]] (inflammation of the lining of the digestive tract), and [[alopecia]] (hair loss). Because of the effect on immune cells (especially lymphocytes), chemotherapy drugs often find use in a host of diseases that result from harmful overactivity of the immune system against self (so-called [[autoimmunity]]). These include [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[vasculitis]] and many others.

There are a number of strategies in the administration of chemotherapeutic drugs used today. Chemotherapy may be given with a [[cure|curative]] intent or it may aim to prolong life or to [[Palliative care|palliate symptoms]].
* Induction chemotherapy is the first line treatment of cancer with a chemotherapeutic drug. This type of chemotherapy is used for curative intent.&lt;ref name=Airley2009&gt;{{cite book | name-list-format = vanc  |author=Rachel Airley|title=Cancer chemotherapy |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location= |year=2009 |isbn=0-470-09254-8|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|55–59}}
* Combined modality chemotherapy is the use of drugs with other [[Cancer#Treatments|cancer treatments]], such as [[surgery]], [[radiation therapy]], or [[hyperthermia therapy]].
* Consolidation chemotherapy is given after remission in order to prolong the overall disease-free time and improve overall survival. The drug that is administered is the same as the drug that achieved remission.&lt;ref name=Airley2009/&gt;{{rp|55–59}}
* Intensification chemotherapy is identical to consolidation chemotherapy but a different drug than the induction chemotherapy is used.&lt;ref name=Airley2009/&gt;{{rp|55–59}}
* [[Combination chemotherapy]] involves treating a person with a number of different drugs simultaneously. The drugs differ in their mechanism and side-effects. The biggest advantage is minimising the chances of resistance developing to any one agent. Also, the drugs can often be used at lower doses, reducing toxicity.&lt;ref name=Airley2009/&gt;{{rp|55–59}}&lt;ref name=Wood2005&gt;{{cite book | name-list-format = vanc  |author1=Wood, Miriam |author2=David Brighton |title=The Royal Marsden Hospital handbook of cancer chemotherapy: a guide for the multidisciplinary team|publisher=Elsevier Churchill Livingstone|location=St. Louis, Mo |year=2005|isbn=0-443-07101-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|17–18}}&lt;ref name=CochraneGastric2017/&gt;
* [[Neoadjuvant]] chemotherapy is given prior to a local treatment such as surgery, and is designed to shrink the primary tumor.&lt;ref name=Airley2009/&gt;{{rp|55–59}} It is also given to cancers with a high risk of micrometastatic disease.&lt;ref name=Perry2008&gt;{{cite book | name-list-format = vanc  |author=Perry, Michael J. |title=The Chemotherapy source book |publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia |year=2008|isbn=0-7817-7328-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|42}}
* [[Adjuvant chemotherapy]] is given after a local treatment (radiotherapy or surgery). It can be used when there is little evidence of cancer present, but there is risk of recurrence.&lt;ref name=Airley2009/&gt;{{rp|55–59}} It is also useful in killing any cancerous cells that have spread to other parts of the body. These [[micrometastases]] can be treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and can reduce relapse rates caused by these disseminated cells.&lt;ref name="pmid16061845"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Epstein RJ | title = Maintenance therapy to suppress micrometastasis: the new challenge for adjuvant cancer treatment | journal = Clinical Cancer Research | volume = 11 | issue = 15 | pages = 5337–41 | date = Aug 2005 | pmid = 16061845 | doi = 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0437 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Maintenance chemotherapy is a repeated low-dose treatment to prolong remission.&lt;ref name=CochraneGastric2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Airley2009/&gt;{{rp|55–59}}
* Salvage chemotherapy or palliative chemotherapy is given without curative intent, but simply to decrease tumor load and increase life expectancy. For these regimens, in general, a better toxicity profile is expected.&lt;ref name=Airley2009/&gt;{{rp|55–59}}

All [[chemotherapy regimen]]s require that the recipient be capable of undergoing the treatment. [[Performance status]] is often used as a measure to determine whether a person can receive chemotherapy, or whether dose reduction is required.  Because only a fraction of the cells in a tumor die with each treatment ([[fractional kill]]), repeated doses must be administered to continue to reduce the size of the tumor.&lt;ref name=skeel&gt;{{cite book | name-list-format = vanc  |last1=Skeel |first1= R. T. |year=2003 |title= Handbook of Cancer Chemotherapy (paperback) |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |edition=6th |isbn=0-7817-3629-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current chemotherapy regimens apply drug treatment in cycles, with the frequency and duration of treatments limited by toxicity.&lt;ref name=chabner&gt;{{cite book | name-list-format = vanc  |last1=Chabner|first1= B. |last2= Longo | first2=D.

=== Efficacy ===
The efficacy of chemotherapy depends on the type of cancer and the stage. The overall effectiveness ranges from being curative for some cancers, such as some [[leukemias]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nastoupil LJ, Rose AC, Flowers CR | title = Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: current treatment approaches | journal = Oncology | volume = 26 | issue = 5 | pages = 488–95 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22730604 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Freedman A | title = Follicular lymphoma: 2012 update on diagnosis and management | journal = American Journal of Hematology | volume = 87 | issue = 10 | pages = 988–95 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 23001911 | doi = 10.1002/ajh.23313 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to being ineffective, such as in some [[brain tumors]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rampling R, James A, Papanastassiou V | title = The present and future management of malignant brain tumours: surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 75 Suppl 2 | issue = Suppl 2 | pages = ii24–30 | date = Jun 2004 | pmid = 15146036 | pmc = 1765659 | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.2004.040535 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to being needless in others, like most [[non-melanoma skin cancer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Madan V, Lear JT, Szeimies RM | title = Non-melanoma skin cancer | journal = Lancet | volume = 375 | issue = 9715 | pages = 673–85 | date = Feb 2010 | pmid = 20171403 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61196-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dosage ===
[[File:Screenshot at 2013-08-16 14 52 30.png|thumb|left|Dose response relationship of cell killing by chemotherapeutic drugs on normal and cancer cells. At high doses the percentage of normal and cancer cells killed is very similar. For this reason, doses are chosen where anti-tumour activity exceeds normal cell death.&lt;ref name=Corrie /&gt;]]
Dosage of chemotherapy can be difficult: If the dose is too low, it will be ineffective against the tumor, whereas, at excessive doses, the toxicity ([[adverse effect|side-effects]]) will be intolerable to the person receiving it.&lt;ref name=Corrie /&gt; The standard method of determining chemotherapy dosage is based on calculated [[body surface area]] (BSA). The BSA is usually calculated with a mathematical formula or a [[nomogram]], using the recipient's weight and height, rather than by direct measurement of body area. This formula was originally derived in a 1916 study and attempted to translate medicinal doses established with laboratory animals to equivalent doses for humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Du Bois D|author2=Du Bois EF|title=A formula to estimate the approximate surface area if height and weight be known. 1916.|journal=Nutrition|volume=5|issue=5|pages=303–11|pmid=2520314}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study only included 9 human subjects.&lt;ref name="dosing strategies"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Felici A.|author2=J. Verweij|author3=A. Sparreboom|title=Dosing strategies for anticancer drugs: the good, the bad and body-surface area|journal=Eur J Cancer|year=2002|volume=38|issue=13|pages=1677–84|doi=10.1016/s0959-8049(02)00151-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; When chemotherapy was introduced in the 1950s, the BSA formula was adopted as the official standard for chemotherapy dosing for lack of a better option.&lt;ref name="pmid17305252"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaestner SA, Sewell GJ | title = Chemotherapy dosing part I: scientific basis for current practice and use of body surface area | journal = Clinical Oncology | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 23–37 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17305252 | doi = 10.1016/j.clon.2006.10.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Use of Body Surface Area as a Criterion of Drug Dosage in Cancer Chemotherapy|author=Donald Pinkel|journal=Cancer Res|date=August 1958|volume=18|issue=7|pages=853–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, the validity of this method in calculating uniform doses has been questioned. The reason for this is that the formula only takes into account the individual's weight and height. Drug absorption and clearance are influenced by multiple factors, including age, gender, metabolism, disease state, organ function, drug-to-drug interactions, genetics, and obesity, which has a major impact on the actual concentration of the drug in the person's bloodstream.&lt;ref name="pmid17305252" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11953888"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gurney H | title = How to calculate the dose of chemotherapy | journal = British Journal of Cancer | volume = 86 | issue = 8 | pages = 1297–302 | date = Apr 2002 | pmid = 11953888 | pmc = 2375356 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bjc.6600139 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22965963"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beumer JH, Chu E, Salamone SJ | title = Body-surface area-based chemotherapy dosing: appropriate in the 21st century? | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 30 | issue = 31 | pages = 3896–7 | date = Nov 2012 | pmid = 22965963 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2012.44.2863 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, there is high variability in the systemic chemotherapy drug concentration in people dosed by BSA, and this variability has been demonstrated to be more than 10-fold for many drugs.&lt;ref name="dosing strategies" /&gt;&lt;ref name="role of body"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Baker SD|author2=Verweij J|author3=Rowinsky EK|author4=Donehower RC|author5=Schellens JH|author6=Grochow LB|author7=Sparreboom A|title=Role of body surface area in dosing of investigational anticancer agents in adults, 1991–2001|journal=J Natl Cancer Inst|year=2002|volume=94|issue=24|pages=1883–8|doi=10.1093/jnci/94.24.1883}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In other words, if two people receive the same dose of a given drug based on BSA, the concentration of that drug in the bloodstream of one person may be 10 times higher or lower compared to that of the other person.&lt;ref name="role of body" /&gt; This variability is typical with many chemotherapy drugs dosed by BSA, and, as shown below, was demonstrated in a study of 14 common chemotherapy drugs.&lt;ref name="dosing strategies" /&gt;

[[File:Improvement in Response Rate.jpg|thumb|180px|right|5-FU dose management results in significantly better response and survival rates versus BSA dosing.&lt;ref name="individual fluorouracil" /&gt;]]
The result of this pharmacokinetic variability among people, is that many people do not receive the right dose to achieve optimal treatment effectiveness with minimized toxic side effects.

There has been controversy over the use of BSA to calculate chemotherapy doses for people who are [[obese]].&lt;ref name="dosing chemotherapy"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hunter RJ, Navo MA, Thaker PH, Bodurka DC, Wolf JK, Smith JA | title = Dosing chemotherapy in obese patients: actual versus assigned body surface area (BSA) | journal = Cancer Treat Rev| volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–78 | date = Feb 2009 | pmid = 18922643 | doi = 10.1016/j.ctrv.2008.07.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their higher BSA, clinicians often arbitrarily reduce the dose prescribed by the BSA formula for fear of [[overdosing]].&lt;ref name="dosing chemotherapy" /&gt; In many cases, this can result in sub-optimal treatment.&lt;ref name="dosing chemotherapy" /&gt;

Several clinical studies have demonstrated that when chemotherapy dosing is individualized to achieve optimal systemic drug exposure, treatment outcomes are improved and toxic side effects are reduced.&lt;ref name="individual fluorouracil" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dose adjustment" /&gt; In the 5-FU clinical study cited above, people whose dose was adjusted to achieve a pre-determined target exposure realized an 84% improvement in treatment response rate and a six-month improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with those dosed by BSA.&lt;ref name="individual fluorouracil" /&gt;

In the same study, investigators compared the incidence of common 5-FU-associated grade 3/4 toxicities between the dose-adjusted people and people dosed per BSA.&lt;ref name="individual fluorouracil" /&gt; The incidence of debilitating grades of diarrhea was reduced from 18% in the BSA-dosed group to 4% in the dose-adjusted group and serious hematologic side effects were eliminated.&lt;ref name="individual fluorouracil" /&gt;  Because of the reduced toxicity, dose-adjusted patients were able to be treated for longer periods of time.&lt;ref name="individual fluorouracil" /&gt; BSA-dosed people were treated for a total of 680 months while people in the dose-adjusted group were treated for a total of 791 months.&lt;ref name="individual fluorouracil" /&gt; Completing the course of treatment is an important factor in achieving better treatment outcomes.

Similar results were found in a study involving people with colorectal cancer who were treated with the popular [[FOLFOX]] regimen.&lt;ref name="dose adjustment" /&gt; The incidence of serious diarrhea was reduced from 12% in the BSA-dosed group of patients to 1.7% in the dose-adjusted group, and the incidence of severe mucositis was reduced from 15% to 0.8%.&lt;ref name="dose adjustment" /&gt;

The FOLFOX study also demonstrated an improvement in treatment outcomes.&lt;ref name="dose adjustment" /&gt; Positive response increased from 46% in the BSA-dosed group to 70% in the dose-adjusted group.  Median progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) both improved by six months in the dose adjusted group.&lt;ref name="dose adjustment" /&gt;

One approach that can help clinicians individualize chemotherapy dosing is to measure the drug levels in blood plasma over time and adjust dose according to a formula or algorithm to achieve optimal exposure. With an established target exposure for optimized treatment effectiveness with minimized toxicities, dosing can be personalized to achieve target exposure and optimal results for each person.  Such an algorithm was used in the clinical trials cited above and resulted in significantly improved treatment outcomes.

Oncologists are already individualizing dosing of some cancer drugs based on exposure.

==== Alkylating agents ====
{{Main|Alkylating antineoplastic agent}}
Alkylating agents are the oldest group of chemotherapeutics in use today. Originally derived from [[mustard gas]] used in [[World War I]], there are now many types of alkylating agents in use.&lt;ref name=Corrie /&gt; They are so named because of their ability to [[alkylation|alkylate]] many molecules, including [[protein]]s, [[RNA]] and [[DNA]]. This ability to bind [[covalent bond|covalently]] to DNA via their [[alkyl group]] is the primary cause for their anti-cancer effects.&lt;ref name=lind&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lind M.J.|title=Principles of cytotoxic chemotherapy|journal=Medicine|year=2008|volume=36|issue=1|pages=19–23|doi=10.1016/j.mpmed.2007.10.003|first1=M.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA is made of two strands and the molecules may either bind twice to one strand of DNA (intrastrand crosslink) or may bind once to both strands (interstrand crosslink). If the cell tries to replicate crosslinked DNA during [[cell division]], or tries to repair it, the DNA strands can break. This leads to a form of programmed cell death called [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref name =Siddik&gt;{{cite book | name-list-format = vanc |last=Siddik ZH|title=Mechanisms of Action of Cancer Chemotherapeutic Agents: DNA-Interactive Alkylating Agents and Antitumour Platinum-Based Drugs|year=2005|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|doi=10.1002/0470025077.chap84b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19002790" /&gt; Alkylating agents will work at any point in the cell cycle and thus are known as cell cycle-independent drugs. For this reason the effect on the cell is dose dependent; the fraction of cells that die is directly proportional to the dose of drug.&lt;ref name="pmid14508075" /&gt;

The subtypes of alkylating agents are the [[nitrogen mustard]]s, [[nitrosoureas]], [[tetrazine]]s, [[aziridine]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Giorgi-Renault S. |author2=Renault J. |author3=Baron M. |author4=Gebel-Servolles P. |author5=Delic J. |author6=Cros S. |author7=Paoletti C. | year = 1988 | title = Heterocyclic quinones XIII.

==== Antimetabolites ====
[[File:Deoxcytidine, Gemcitidine and Decitabine.png|thumb|[[Deoxycytidine]] (left) and two anti-metabolite drugs (center and right); [[gemcitabine]] and [[decitabine]]. The drugs are very similar but they have subtle differences in their [[chemical structure]].]]
{{Main|Antimetabolite}}
[[Anti-metabolite]]s are a group of molecules that impede DNA and RNA synthesis. Many of them have a similar structure to the building blocks of DNA and RNA. The building blocks are [[nucleotide]]s; a molecule comprising a [[nucleobase]], a sugar and a [[phosphate group]]. The nucleobases are divided into [[purine]]s ([[guanine]] and [[adenine]]) and [[pyrimidine]]s ([[cytosine]], [[thymine]] and [[uracil]]). Anti-metabolites resemble either nucleobases or nucleosides (a nucleotide without the phosphate group), but have altered [[chemical group]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid19476376"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Parker WB | title = Enzymology of purine and pyrimidine antimetabolites used in the treatment of cancer | journal = Chemical Reviews | volume = 109 | issue = 7 | pages = 2880–93 | date = Jul 2009 | pmid = 19476376 | pmc = 2827868 | doi = 10.1021/cr900028p }}&lt;/ref&gt; These drugs exert their effect by either blocking the enzymes required for DNA synthesis or becoming incorporated into DNA or RNA. By inhibiting the enzymes involved in DNA synthesis, they prevent mitosis because the DNA cannot duplicate itself. Also, after misincorporation of the molecules into DNA, [[DNA damage]] can occur and programmed cell death ([[apoptosis]]) is induced. Unlike alkylating agents, anti-metabolites are cell cycle dependent. This means that they only work during a specific part of the cell cycle, in this case [[S-phase]] (the DNA synthesis phase). For this reason, at a certain dose, the effect plateaus and proportionally no more cell death occurs with increased doses. Subtypes of the anti-metabolites are the [[antifolate|anti-folates]], fluoropyrimidines, deoxynucleoside analogues and [[thiopurine]]s.&lt;ref name=lind /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19476376" /&gt;

The anti-folates include [[methotrexate]] and [[pemetrexed]]. Methotrexate inhibits [[dihydrofolate reductase]] (DHFR), an enzyme that regenerates [[tetrahydrofolate]] from [[dihydrofolate]]. When the enzyme is inhibited by methotrexate, the cellular levels of folate coenzymes diminish. These are required for [[thymidylate]] and purine production, which are both essential for DNA synthesis and cell division.&lt;ref name=Airley2009/&gt;{{rp|55–59}}&lt;ref name=Wood2005/&gt;{{rp|11}} Pemetrexed is another anti-metabolite that affects purine and pyrimidine production, and therefore also inhibits DNA synthesis. It primarily inhibits the enzyme [[thymidylate synthase]], but also has effects on DHFR, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase and [[glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase]].&lt;ref name="pmid15217974"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Adjei AA | title = Pemetrexed (ALIMTA), a novel multitargeted antineoplastic agent | journal = Clinical Cancer Research | volume = 10 | issue = 12 Pt 2 | pages = 4276s–4280s | date = Jun 2004 | pmid = 15217974 | doi = 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-040010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fluoropyrimidines include [[fluorouracil]] and [[capecitabine]]. Fluorouracil is a nucleobase analogue that is metabolised in cells to form at least two active products; 5-fluourouridine monophosphate (FUMP) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-phosphate (fdUMP). FUMP becomes incorporated into RNA and fdUMP inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase; both of which lead to cell death.&lt;ref name=Wood2005/&gt;{{rp|11}} Capecitabine is a [[prodrug]] of 5-fluorouracil that is broken down in cells to produce the active drug.&lt;ref name="pmid12515569"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wagstaff AJ, Ibbotson T, Goa KL | title = Capecitabine: a review of its pharmacology and therapeutic efficacy in the management of advanced breast cancer | journal = Drugs | volume = 63 | issue = 2 | pages = 217–36 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12515569 | doi = 10.2165/00003495-200363020-00009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The deoxynucleoside analogues include [[cytarabine]], [[gemcitabine]], [[decitabine]], [[azacitidine]], [[fludarabine]], [[nelarabine]], [[cladribine]], [[clofarabine]], and [[pentostatin]]. The thiopurines include [[thioguanine]] and [[mercaptopurine]].&lt;ref name=lind /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19476376" /&gt;

==== Anti-microtubule agents ====
[[File:Microtubules and alkaloids.png|thumb|left|''Vinca'' alkaloids prevent the assembly of microtubules, whereas taxanes prevent their disassembly. Both mechanisms cause defective mitosis.]]
[[Anti-microtubule agent]]s are [[plant]]-derived chemicals that block cell division by preventing [[microtubule]] function. Microtubules are an important cellular structure composed of two proteins; [[α-tubulin]] and [[β-tubulin]]. They are hollow rod shaped structures that are required for cell division, among other cellular functions.&lt;ref name="pmid1687171"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rowinsky EK, Donehower RC | title = The clinical pharmacology and use of antimicrotubule agents in cancer chemotherapeutics | journal = [[Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics]] | volume = 52 | issue = 1 | pages = 35–84 | date = Oct 1991 | pmid = 1687171 | doi = 10.1016/0163-7258(91)90086-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Microtubules are dynamic structures, which means that they are permanently in a state of assembly and disassembly. [[Vinca alkaloid|''Vinca'' alkaloids]] and [[taxane]]s are the two main groups of anti-microtubule agents, and although both of these groups of drugs cause microtubule dysfunction, their mechanisms of action are completely opposite. The vinca alkaloids prevent the formation of the microtubules, whereas the taxanes prevent the microtubule disassembly. By doing so, they prevent the cancer cells from completing mitosis. Following this, cell cycle arrest occurs, which induces programmed cell death ([[apoptosis]]).&lt;ref name=lind /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20577942" /&gt; Also, these drugs can affect [[Angiogenesis|blood vessel growth]]; an essential process that tumours utilise in order to grow and metastasise.&lt;ref name="pmid20577942"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yue QX, Liu X, Guo DA | title = Microtubule-binding natural products for cancer therapy | journal = [[Planta Medica]] | volume = 76 | issue = 11 | pages = 1037–43 | date = Aug 2010 | pmid = 20577942 | doi = 10.1055/s-0030-1250073 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They bind to the tubulin molecules in [[S-phase]] and prevent proper microtubule formation required for [[M-phase]].&lt;ref name="pmid14508075" /&gt;

Taxanes are natural and semi-synthetic drugs. The first drug of their class, [[paclitaxel]], was originally extracted from the [[Pacific Yew]] tree, ''Taxus brevifolia''.  Now this drug and another in this class, [[docetaxel]], are produced semi-synthetically from a chemical found in the bark of another Yew tree; ''[[Taxus baccata]]''. These drugs promote microtubule stability, preventing their disassembly. Paclitaxel prevents the cell cycle at the boundary of G2-M, whereas docetaxel exerts its effect during [[S-phase]]. Taxanes present difficulties in formulation as medicines because they are poorly soluble in water.&lt;ref name="pmid20577942" /&gt;

[[Podophyllotoxin]] is an antineoplastic [[lignan]] obtained primarily from the [[American Mayapple]] (''Podophyllum peltatum'') and [[Himalayan Mayapple]] (''Podophyllum hexandrum'' or ''Podophyllum emodi''). It has anti-microtubule activity, and its mechanism is similar to that of ''vinca'' alkaloids in that they bind to tubulin, inhibiting microtubule formation. Podophyllotoxin is used to produce two other drugs with different mechanisms of action: [[etoposide]] and [[teniposide]].&lt;ref name="pmid9562603"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Damayanthi Y, Lown JW | title = Podophyllotoxins: current status and recent developments | journal = [[Current Medicinal Chemistry]] | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 205–52 | date = Jun 1998 | pmid = 9562603 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu YQ, Yang L, Tian X|title=Podophyllotoxin: current perspectives|journal=[[Current Bioactive Compounds]]|year=2007|volume=3|issue=1|pages=37–66|doi=10.1016/j.jallcom.2006.06.070|first1=Cong|last2=Zhang|first2=Wei|last3=Qian|first3=Zhengnan|last4=Hua|first4=Zhong|last5=Zhao|first5=Qibo|last6=Sui|first6=Yu|last7=Su|first7=Wenhui|last8=Zhang|first8=Ming|last9=Liu|first9=Zhuhong|last10=Liu|first10=Guodong|last11=Wu|first11=Guangheng}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Topoisomerase inhibitors ====
[[File:Topoisomerase Inhibitor.JPG|thumb|Topoisomerase I and II Inhibitors]]
[[Topoisomerase inhibitor]]s are drugs that affect the activity of two enzymes: [[topoisomerase I]] and [[topoisomerase II]]. When the DNA double-strand helix is unwound, during DNA replication or [[transcription (biology)|transcription]], for example, the adjacent unopened DNA winds tighter (supercoils), like opening the middle of a twisted rope. The stress caused by this effect is in part aided by the topoisomerase enzymes. They produce single- or double-strand breaks into DNA, reducing the tension in the DNA strand. This allows the normal unwinding of DNA to occur during [[DNA replication|replication]] or transcription. Inhibition of topoisomerase I or II interferes with both of these processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | name-list-format = vanc |vauthors=Lodish H, Berk A, Zipursky SL |title=Molecular Cell Biology. 4th edition.

Two topoisomerase I inhibitors, [[irinotecan]] and [[topotecan]], are semi-synthetically derived from [[camptothecin]], which is obtained from the Chinese ornamental tree ''[[Camptotheca acuminata]]''.&lt;ref name="pmid14508075" /&gt; Drugs that target topoisomerase II can be divided into two groups. The topoisomerase II poisons cause increased levels enzymes bound to DNA. This prevents DNA replication and [[transcription (biology)|transcription]], causes DNA strand breaks, and leads to programmed cell death ([[apoptosis]]). These agents include [[etoposide]], [[doxorubicin]], [[mitoxantrone]] and [[teniposide]]. The second group, catalytic inhibitors, are drugs that block the activity of topoisomerase II, and therefore prevent DNA synthesis and translation because the DNA cannot unwind properly. This group includes [[novobiocin]], merbarone, and [[aclarubicin]], which also have other significant mechanisms of action.&lt;ref name="pmid19377506"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nitiss JL | title = Targeting DNA topoisomerase II in cancer chemotherapy | journal = Nature Reviews.

==== Cytotoxic antibiotics ====
The cytotoxic [[antibiotics]] are a varied group of drugs that have various mechanisms of action. The common theme that they share in their chemotherapy indication is that they interrupt [[cell division]]. The most important subgroup is the [[anthracycline]]s and the [[bleomycin]]s; other prominent examples include [[mitomycin C]], [[mitoxantrone]], and [[actinomycin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwwo5gx8aX8C&amp;pg=PA155 |title=Encyclopedia of Molecular Pharmacology |last=Offermanns |first=Stefan |last2=Rosenthal |first2=W. |date=2008-08-14 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=9783540389163 |pages=155 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanisms of anthracyclines include [[DNA intercalation]] (molecules insert between the two strands of DNA), generation of highly reactive [[free radicals]] that damage intercellular molecules and topoisomerase inhibition.&lt;ref name="pmid15169927"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Minotti G, Menna P, Salvatorelli E, Cairo G, Gianni L | title = Anthracyclines: molecular advances and pharmacologic developments in antitumor activity and cardiotoxicity | journal = Pharmacological Reviews | volume = 56 | issue = 2 | pages = 185–229 | date = Jun 2004 | pmid = 15169927 | doi = 10.1124/pr.56.2.6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actinomycin is a complex molecule that intercalates DNA and prevents [[RNA synthesis]].&lt;ref name="pmid2410919"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sobell HM | title = Actinomycin and DNA transcription | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 82 | issue = 16 | pages = 5328–31 | date = Aug 1985 | pmid = 2410919 | pmc = 390561 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.82.16.5328 | bibcode = 1985PNAS...82.5328S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bleomycin, a [[glycopeptide]] isolated from ''Streptomyces verticillus'', also intercalates DNA, but produces [[free radical]]s that damage DNA. This occurs when bleomycin binds to a [[metal ion]], becomes [[reduction (chemistry)|chemically reduced]] and reacts with [[oxygen]].&lt;ref name="pmid1384141"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dorr RT | title = Bleomycin pharmacology: mechanism of action and resistance, and clinical pharmacokinetics | journal = Seminars in Oncology | volume = 19 | issue = 2 Suppl 5 | pages = 3–8 | date = Apr 1992 | pmid = 1384141 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Airley2009/&gt;{{rp|87}}

=== Delivery ===
[[File:Pediatric patients receiving chemotherapy.jpg|thumb|Two girls with [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] receiving chemotherapy.

Anti-cancer IV drip is seen at top right.]]
Most chemotherapy is [[Route of administration|delivered]] [[intravenous therapy|intravenously]], although a number of agents can be administered orally (e.g., [[melphalan]], [[busulfan]], [[capecitabine]]).

There are many intravenous methods of drug delivery, known as vascular access devices. These include the [[Winged infusion set|winged infusion device]], [[peripheral venous catheter]], midline catheter, [[peripherally inserted central catheter]] (PICC), [[central venous catheter]] and [[implantable port]]. The devices have different applications regarding duration of chemotherapy treatment, method of delivery and types of chemotherapeutic agent.&lt;ref name=Wood2005/&gt;{{rp|94–95}}

Depending on the person, the cancer, the stage of cancer, the type of chemotherapy, and the dosage, intravenous chemotherapy may be given on either an [[inpatient]] or an [[outpatient]] basis. For continuous, frequent or prolonged intravenous chemotherapy administration, various systems may be surgically inserted into the vasculature to maintain access.&lt;ref name=Wood2005/&gt;{{rp|113–118}} Commonly used systems are the [[Hickman line]], the [[Port-a-Cath]], and the [[PICC line]]. These have a lower infection risk, are much less prone to [[phlebitis]] or [[extravasation]], and eliminate the need for repeated insertion of peripheral cannulae.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Topical chemotherapies, such as [[5-fluorouracil]], are used to treat some cases of [[non-melanoma skin cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chitwood K, Etzkorn J, Cohen G | title = Topical and intralesional treatment of nonmelanoma skin cancer: efficacy and cost comparisons | journal = Dermatologic Surgery | volume = 39 | issue = 9 | pages = 1306–16 | date = Sep 2013 | pmid = 23915332 | doi = 10.1111/dsu.12300 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the cancer has [[central nervous system]] involvement, or with meningeal disease, [[intrathecal]] chemotherapy may be administered.&lt;ref name=Corrie /&gt;

== Adverse effects ==
Chemotherapeutic techniques have a range of side-effects that depend on the type of medications used. The most common medications affect mainly the [[fast-dividing cells]] of the body, such as blood cells and the cells lining the mouth, stomach, and intestines. Chemotherapy-related toxicities can occur acutely after administration, within hours or days, or chronically, from weeks to years.&lt;ref name=Airley2009/&gt;{{rp|265}}

=== Immunosuppression and myelosuppression ===
Virtually all chemotherapeutic regimens can cause depression of the [[immune system]], often by paralysing the [[bone marrow]] and leading to a decrease of [[white blood cell]]s, [[red blood cell]]s, and [[platelet]]s.
[[Anemia]] and [[thrombocytopenia]] may require [[blood transfusion]]. [[Neutropenia]] (a decrease of the [[neutrophil granulocyte]] count below 0.5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;/[[litre]]) can be improved with synthetic [[G-CSF]] ([[granulocyte]]-colony-stimulating factor, e.g., [[filgrastim]], [[lenograstim]]).

In very severe [[myelosuppression]], which occurs in some regimens, almost all the bone marrow [[stem cell]]s (cells that produce [[white blood cells|white]] and [[red blood cell]]s) are destroyed, meaning ''allogenic'' or ''[[autologous]]'' [[bone marrow transplant|bone marrow cell transplants]] are necessary. (In autologous BMTs, cells are removed from the person before the treatment, multiplied and then re-injected afterward; in ''allogenic'' BMTs, the source is a donor.) However, some people still develop diseases because of this interference with bone marrow.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Although people receiving chemotherapy are encouraged to wash their hands, avoid sick people, and take other infection-reducing steps, about 85% of infections are due to naturally occurring microorganisms in the person's own [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]] (including [[oral cavity]]) and skin.&lt;ref name=Huang2000&gt;{{cite book | name-list-format = vanc   | last1 = Huang | first1 = Elbert S. | title = Internal medicine: handbook for clinicians, resident survival guide | year = 2000 | publisher = Scrub Hill Press | location = Arlington, VA  | isbn = 978-0-9645467-5-2 | page = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|130}} This may manifest as systemic infections, such as [[sepsis]], or as localized outbreaks, such as [[Herpes simplex]], [[shingles]], or other members of the [[human herpes virus|Herpesviridea]].&lt;ref name="HSV"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Elad S, Zadik Y, Hewson I, Hovan A, Correa ME, Logan R, Elting LS, Spijkervet FK, Brennan MT | title = A systematic review of viral infections associated with oral involvement in cancer patients: a spotlight on Herpesviridea | journal = Supportive Care in Cancer | volume = 18 | issue = 8 | pages = 993–1006 | date = Aug 2010 | pmid = 20544224 | doi = 10.1007/s00520-010-0900-3 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/g476114717852h80/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of illness and death can be reduced by taking common antibiotics such as [[Quinolone antibiotic|quinolone]]s or [[trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole]] before any fever or sign of infection appears.&lt;ref name="Cochrane Database"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gafter-Gvili|first=Anat|last2=Fraser|first2=Abigail|last3=Paul|first3=Mical|last4=Vidal|first4=Liat|last5=Lawrie|first5=Theresa A.|last6=van de Wetering|first6=Marianne D.|last7=Kremer|first7=Leontien C.

=== Neutropenic enterocolitis ===
Due to immune system suppression, [[neutropenic enterocolitis]] (typhlitis) is a "life-threatening gastrointestinal complication of chemotherapy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Davila ML | title = Neutropenic enterocolitis | journal = Current Opinion in Gastroenterology | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 44–7 | date = Jan 2006 | pmid = 16319675 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Typhlitis]] is an intestinal infection which may manifest itself through symptoms including [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]], a [[distended abdomen]], [[fever]], [[chills]], or [[abdominal pain]] and tenderness.

[[Typhlitis]] is a [[medical emergency]]. It has a very poor [[prognosis]] and is often fatal unless promptly recognized and aggressively treated.&lt;ref name="Keidan 1989 206–9"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Keidan RD, Fanning J, Gatenby RA, Weese JL | title = Recurrent typhlitis. A disease resulting from aggressive chemotherapy | journal = Diseases of the Colon and Rectum | volume = 32 | issue = 3 | pages = 206–9 | date = Mar 1989 | pmid = 2920627 | doi = 10.1007/BF02554529 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Successful treatment hinges on early diagnosis provided by a high index of suspicion and the use of CT scanning, nonoperative treatment for uncomplicated cases, and sometimes elective right [[hemicolectomy]] to prevent recurrence.&lt;ref name="Keidan 1989 206–9" /&gt;

=== Gastrointestinal distress ===
[[Nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], [[diarrhoea]], abdominal cramps, and [[constipation]] are common side-effects of chemotherapeutic medications that kill fast-dividing cells.&lt;ref name="pmid"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gibson RJ, Keefe DM | title = Cancer chemotherapy-induced diarrhoea and constipation: mechanisms of damage and prevention strategies | journal = Supportive Care in Cancer | volume = 14 | issue = 9 | pages = 890–900 | date = Sep 2006 | pmid = 16604351 | doi = 10.1007/s00520-006-0040-y }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malnutrition]] and [[dehydration]] can result when the recipient does not eat or drink enough, or when the person vomits frequently, because of gastrointestinal damage. This can result in rapid weight loss, or occasionally in weight gain, if the person eats too much in an effort to allay nausea or heartburn. Weight gain can also be caused by some steroid medications. These side-effects can frequently be reduced or eliminated with [[antiemetic]] drugs. Self-care measures, such as eating frequent small meals and drinking clear liquids or [[Ginger#Medicinal use|ginger]] tea, are often recommended. In general, this is a temporary effect, and frequently resolves within a week of finishing treatment. However, a high [[index of suspicion]] is appropriate, since [[diarrhea]] and bloating are also symptoms of [[typhlitis]], a very serious and potentially life-threatening [[medical emergency]] that requires immediate treatment.

=== Anemia ===
[[Anemia]] can be a combined outcome caused by myelosuppressive chemotherapy, and possible cancer-related causes such as [[bleeding]], [[blood cell]] destruction ([[hemolysis]]), hereditary disease, kidney dysfunction, nutritional
deficiencies or [[anemia of chronic disease]]. Treatments to mitigate anemia include hormones to boost blood production ([[erythropoietin]]), [[iron supplement]]s, and [[blood transfusion]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid10511589"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Groopman JE, Itri LM | title = Chemotherapy-induced anemia in adults: incidence and treatment | journal = Journal of the National Cancer Institute | volume = 91 | issue = 19 | pages = 1616–34 | date = Oct 1999 | pmid = 10511589 | doi = 10.1093/jnci/91.19.1616 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16925107"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Henry DH | title = The role of intravenous iron in cancer-related anemia | journal = Oncology | volume = 20 | issue = 8 Suppl 6 | pages = 21–4 | date = Jul 2006 | pmid = 16925107 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18597709"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rodgers GM, Becker PS, Bennett CL, Cella D, Chanan-Khan A, Chesney C, Cleeland C, Coccia PF, Djulbegovic B, Garst JL, Gilreath JA, Kraut EH, Lin WC, Matulonis U, Millenson M, Reinke D, Rosenthal J, Sabbatini P, Schwartz RN, Stein RS, Vij R | title = Cancer- and chemotherapy-induced anemia | journal = Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 536–64 | date = Jul 2008 | pmid = 18597709 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Myelosuppressive therapy can cause a tendency to bleed easily, leading to anemia.

=== Fatigue ===
[[Cancer-related fatigue|Fatigue]] may be a consequence of the cancer or its treatment, and can last for months to years after treatment.

=== Nausea and vomiting ===
{{Further|Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting}}
[[Nausea]] and [[vomiting]] are two of the most feared cancer treatment-related side-effects for people with cancer and their families. In 1983, Coates et al. found that people receiving chemotherapy ranked nausea and vomiting as the first and second most severe side-effects, respectively. Up to 20% of people receiving highly emetogenic agents in this era postponed, or even refused, potentially curative treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/g152223567614560/ | title = Nausea and Vomiting in the Cancer Patient | accessdate = 2 September 2011 | year = 2006 | journal = Oncology | pages = 1482–1496 | doi = 10.1007/0-387-31056-8_83 | quote = Nausea and vomiting are two of the most feared cancer treatment-related side effects for cancer patients and their families. | last1 = Gill | first1 = Paula | last2 = Grothey | first2 = Axel | last3 = Loprinzi | first3 = Charles | isbn = 978-0-387-24291-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) are common with many treatments and some forms of cancer. Since the 1990s, several novel classes of [[antiemetics]] have been developed and commercialized, becoming a nearly universal standard in chemotherapy regimens, and helping to successfully manage these symptoms in many people. Effective mediation of these unpleasant and sometimes-crippling symptoms results in increased quality of life for the recipient and more efficient treatment cycles, due to less stoppage of treatment due to better tolerance and better overall health.

=== Hair loss ===
[[Hair loss]] (alopecia) can be caused by chemotherapy that kills rapidly dividing cells; other medications may cause hair to thin.  These are most often temporary effects: hair usually starts to regrow a few weeks after the last treatment, but sometimes with a change in colour, texture, thickness or style. Sometimes hair has a tendency to curl after regrowth, resulting in "chemo curls." Severe hair loss occurs most often with drugs such as [[doxorubicin]], [[daunorubicin]], [[paclitaxel]], [[docetaxel]], [[cyclophosphamide]], [[ifosfamide]] and [[etoposide]]. Permanent thinning or hair loss can result from some standard chemotherapy regimens.

Chemotherapy induced hair loss occurs by a non-androgenic mechanism, and can manifest as [[alopecia totalis]], telogen effluvium, or less often [[alopecia areata]].&lt;ref name="pmid17642856"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chadha V, Shenoi SD | title = Hair loss in cancer chemotherapeutic patients | journal = Indian Journal of Dermatology, Venereology and Leprology | volume = 69 | issue = 2 | pages = 131–132 | year = 2003 | pmid = 17642856 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually associated with systemic treatment due to the high mitotic rate of hair follicles, and more reversible than androgenic hair loss,&lt;ref name="pmid23187775"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lemieux J | title = Reducing chemotherapy-induced alopecia with scalp cooling | journal = Clinical Advances in Hematology &amp; Oncology | volume = 10 | issue = 10 | pages = 681–682 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 23187775 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shapiro J, Price VH | title = Hair regrowth.

=== Secondary neoplasm ===
Development of secondary neoplasia after successful chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatment can occur. The most common [[secondary neoplasm]] is secondary acute myeloid leukemia, which develops primarily after treatment with alkylating agents or topoisomerase inhibitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Secondary neoplasias following chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunosuppression |date=2000 |publisher=Karger |isbn=9783318006155 |volume=55 |location=Basel |oclc=606559421}}&lt;/ref&gt; Survivors of [[childhood cancer]] are more than 13 times as likely to get a [[secondary neoplasm]] during the 30 years after treatment than the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hijiya N, Hudson MM, Lensing S, Zacher M, Onciu M, Behm FG, Razzouk BI, Ribeiro RC, Rubnitz JE, Sandlund JT, Rivera GK, Evans WE, Relling MV, Pui CH | title = Cumulative incidence of secondary neoplasms as a first event after childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia | journal = JAMA | volume = 297 | issue = 11 | pages = 1207–1215 | date = Mar 2007 | pmid = 17374815 | doi = 10.1001/jama.297.11.1207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all of this increase can be attributed to chemotherapy.

[[Female infertility]] by chemotherapy appears to be secondary to [[premature ovarian failure]] by loss of [[primordial follicles]].&lt;ref name=Morgan2012&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morgan S, Anderson RA, Gourley C, Wallace WH, Spears N | title = How do chemotherapeutic agents damage the ovary? | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 525–35 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22647504 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dms022 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This loss is not necessarily a direct effect of the chemotherapeutic agents, but could be due to an increased rate of growth initiation to replace damaged developing follicles.&lt;ref name=Morgan2012 /&gt;

People may choose between several methods of [[fertility preservation]] prior to chemotherapy, including [[cryopreservation]] of semen, ovarian tissue, oocytes, or embryos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gurgan T, Salman C, Demirol A | title = Pregnancy and assisted reproduction techniques in men and women after cancer treatment | journal = Placenta | volume = 29 Suppl B | issue =  | pages = 152–9 | date = Oct 2008 | pmid = 18790328 | doi = 10.1016/j.placenta.2008.07.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As more than half of cancer patients are elderly, this adverse effect is only relevant for a minority of patients. A study in France between 1999 and 2011 came to the result that embryo freezing before administration of gonadotoxic agents to females caused a delay of treatment in 34% of cases, and a live birth in 27% of surviving cases who wanted to become pregnant, with the follow-up time varying between 1 and 13 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Courbiere B, Decanter C, Bringer-Deutsch S, Rives N, Mirallié S, Pech JC, De Ziegler D, Carré-Pigeon F, May-Panloup P, Sifer C, Amice V, Schweitzer T, Porcu-Buisson G, Poirot C | title = Emergency IVF for embryo freezing to preserve female fertility: a French multicentre cohort study | journal = Human Reproduction | volume = 28 | issue = 9 | pages = 2381–8 | date = Sep 2013 | pmid = 23832792 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1093/humrep/det268 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Potential protective or attenuating agents include [[GnRH analog]]s, where several studies have shown a protective effect ''[[in vivo]]'' in humans, but some studies show no such effect. [[Sphingosine-1-phosphate]] (S1P) has shown similar effect, but its mechanism of inhibiting the [[Sphingomyelin#Apoptosis|sphingomyelin apoptotic pathway]] may also interfere with the [[apoptosis]] action of chemotherapy drugs.&lt;ref name="RonessKalich-Philosoph2014"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roness H, Kalich-Philosoph L, Meirow D | title = Prevention of chemotherapy-induced ovarian damage: possible roles for hormonal and non-hormonal attenuating agents | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | pages = 759–774 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24833728 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmu019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In chemotherapy as a [[conditioning regimen]] in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, a study of people conditioned with cyclophosphamide alone for severe aplastic anemia came to the result that ovarian recovery occurred in all women younger than 26 years at time of transplantation, but only in five of 16 women older than 26 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tichelli A, Rovó A | title = Fertility issues following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation | journal = [[Expert Review of Hematology]] | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 375–388 | date = Aug 2013 | pmid = 23991924 | doi = 10.1586/17474086.2013.816507 | url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/810686_2?nlid=34365_904 }}

=== Teratogenicity ===
Chemotherapy is [[teratogenic]] during [[pregnancy]], especially during the [[first trimester]], to the extent that [[abortion]] usually is recommended if pregnancy in this period is found during chemotherapy.&lt;ref name=arnon2011&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Arnon J, Meirow D, Lewis-Roness H, Ornoy A | title = Genetic and teratogenic effects of cancer treatments on gametes and embryos | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 394–403 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11476352 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/7.4.394 }} [http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/content/7/4/394.full.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Second- and third-trimester exposure does not usually increase the teratogenic risk and adverse effects on cognitive development, but it may increase the risk of various [[complications of pregnancy]] and fetal myelosuppression.&lt;ref name=arnon2011 /&gt;

In males previously having undergone chemotherapy or radiotherapy, there appears to be no increase in genetic defects or congenital malformations in their children conceived after therapy.&lt;ref name=arnon2011 /&gt; The use of [[assisted reproductive technologies]] and [[micromanipulation technique]]s might increase this risk.&lt;ref name=arnon2011 /&gt; In females previously having undergone chemotherapy, miscarriage and congenital malformations are not increased in subsequent conceptions.&lt;ref name=arnon2011 /&gt; However, when [[in vitro fertilization]] and [[embryo cryopreservation]]is practised between or shortly after treatment, possible genetic risks to the growing oocytes exist, and hence it has been recommended that the babies be screened.&lt;ref name=arnon2011 /&gt;

=== Peripheral neuropathy ===
{{further|Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy}}
Between 30 and 40 percent of people undergoing chemotherapy experience [[chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy]] (CIPN), a progressive, enduring, and often irreversible condition, causing pain, tingling, numbness and sensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes progressing to the arms and legs.&lt;ref name = NCI&gt;{{vcite journal | author = del Pino BM | date = Feb 23, 2010 | journal = NCI Cancer Bulletin | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | page = 6 | title = Chemotherapy-induced Peripheral Neuropathy | url = http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/research/chemotherapy-induced-peripheral-neuropathy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemotherapy drugs associated with CIPN include [[thalidomide]], [[epothilone]]s, ''vinca'' alkaloids, taxanes, [[proteasome inhibitor]]s, and the platinum-based drugs.&lt;ref name = NCI /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal|url=http://www.kup.at/kup/pdf/10376.pdf|author=Grisold W, Oberndorfer S, Windebank AJ|journal=European Association of Neurooncology Magazine|title=Chemotherapy and polyneuropathies|year=2012|volume=12|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether CIPN arises, and to what degree, is determined by the choice of drug, duration of use, the total amount consumed and whether the person already has [[peripheral neuropathy]]. Though the symptoms are mainly sensory, in some cases [[motor nerve]]s and the [[autonomic nervous system]] are affected.&lt;ref name=Beijers&gt;{{vcite journal|author=Beijers AJM, Jongen, JLM &amp; Vreugdenhil1 G |date=January 2012 |journal=The Netherlands Journal of Medicine |volume=70 |issue=1 |pmid=22271810 |url=http://www.njmonline.nl/getpdf.php?id=10000794 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203001320/http://www.njmonline.nl/getpdf.php?id=10000794 |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; CIPN often follows the first chemotherapy dose and increases in severity as treatment continues, but this progression usually levels off at completion of treatment. The platinum-based drugs are the exception; with these drugs, sensation may continue to deteriorate for several months after the end of treatment.&lt;ref name= Windebank&gt;{{vcite journal | author = Windebank AJ &amp; Grisold W | title = Chemotherapy-induced neuropathy | journal =  Journal of the Peripheral Nervous System | date = 2008 Mar | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–46 | pmid = 18346229 | doi=10.1111/j.1529-8027.2008.00156.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some CIPN appears to be irreversible.&lt;ref name= Windebank /&gt; Pain can often be managed with drug or other treatment but the numbness is usually resistant to treatment.&lt;ref name=Savage&gt;{{vcite journal | journal = Journal of the National Cancer Institute| title = Chemotherapy-induced pain puzzles scientists | volume = 99 | issue = 14 | author = Savage L | date = 2007 | url = http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/99/14/1070.long | pages = 1070–1071 | doi=10.1093/jnci/djm072 | pmid=17623791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cognitive impairment ===
Some people receiving chemotherapy report fatigue or non-specific neurocognitive problems, such as an inability to concentrate; this is sometimes called [[post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment]], referred to as "chemo brain" in popular and social media.&lt;ref name="pmid15169812"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tannock IF, Ahles TA, Ganz PA, Van Dam FS | title = Cognitive impairment associated with chemotherapy for cancer: report of a workshop | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 22 | issue = 11 | pages = 2233–9 | date = Jun 2004 | pmid = 15169812 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2004.08.094 | url = http://www.jco.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15169812 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tumor lysis syndrome ===
In particularly large tumors and cancers with high [[white cell count]]s, such as [[lymphoma]]s, [[teratoma]]s, and some [[leukemia]]s, some people develop [[tumor lysis syndrome]]. The rapid breakdown of cancer cells causes the release of chemicals from the inside of the cells. Following this, high levels of [[hyperuricemia|uric acid]], [[hyperkalemia|potassium]] and [[hyperphosphatemia|phosphate]] are found in the blood. High levels of phosphate induce secondary hypoparathyroidism, resulting in low levels of calcium in the blood.  This causes kidney damage and the high levels of potassium can cause [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|cardiac arrhythmia]]. Although prophylaxis is available and is often initiated in people with large tumors, this is a dangerous side-effect that can lead to death if left untreated.&lt;ref name=Wood2005/&gt;{{rp|202}}

=== Organ damage ===
[[Cardiotoxicity]] (heart damage) is especially prominent with the use of [[anthracycline]] drugs ([[doxorubicin]], [[epirubicin]], [[idarubicin]], and [[liposomal doxorubicin]]). The cause of this is most likely due to the production of [[free radical]]s in the cell and subsequent [[DNA damage]]. Other chemotherapeutic agents that cause cardiotoxicity, but at a lower incidence, are [[cyclophosphamide]], [[docetaxel]] and [[clofarabine]].&lt;ref name="pmid22382639"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shaikh AY, Shih JA | title = Chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity | journal = Current Heart Failure Reports | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 117–27 | date = Jun 2012 | pmid = 22382639 | doi = 10.1007/s11897-012-0083-y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hepatotoxicity]] (liver damage) can be caused by many cytotoxic drugs. The susceptibility of an individual to liver damage can be altered by other factors such as the cancer itself, [[viral hepatitis]], [[immunosuppression]] and [[nutritional deficiency]]. The liver damage can consist of damage to liver cells, [[Hepatic veno-occlusive disease|hepatic sinusoidal syndrome]] (obstruction of the veins in the liver), [[cholestasis]] (where bile does not flow from the liver to the intestine) and [[liver fibrosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thatishetty AV, Agresti N, O'Brien CB | title = Chemotherapy-induced hepatotoxicity | journal = Clinics in Liver Disease | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 671–86, ix–x | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24099024 | doi = 10.1016/j.cld.2013.07.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11306728"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=King PD, Perry MC | title = Hepatotoxicity of chemotherapy | journal = The Oncologist | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 162–76 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11306728 | doi = 10.1634/theoncologist.6-2-162 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nephrotoxicity]] (kidney damage) can be caused by [[tumor lysis syndrome]] and also due direct effects of drug clearance by the kidneys. Different drugs will affect different parts of the kidney and the toxicity may be [[asymptomatic]] (only seen on blood or urine tests) or may cause [[acute renal failure]].&lt;ref name="pmid16473645"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=de Jonge MJ, Verweij J | title = Renal toxicities of chemotherapy | journal = Seminars in Oncology | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 68–73 | date = Feb 2006 | pmid = 16473645 | doi = 10.1053/j.seminoncol.2005.11.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15574506"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Humphreys BD, Soiffer RJ, Magee CC | title = Renal failure associated with cancer and its treatment: an update | journal = Journal of the American Society of Nephrology | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 151–61 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15574506 | doi = 10.1681/ASN.2004100843 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ototoxicity]] (damage to the inner ear) is a common side effect of platinum based drugs that can produce symptoms such as dizziness and [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]].&lt;ref name="pmid22547603"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brock PR, Knight KR, Freyer DR, Campbell KC, Steyger PS, Blakley BW, Rassekh SR, Chang KW, Fligor BJ, Rajput K, Sullivan M, Neuwelt EA | title = Platinum-induced ototoxicity in children: a consensus review on mechanisms, predisposition, and protection, including a new International Society of Pediatric Oncology Boston ototoxicity scale | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 30 | issue = 19 | pages = 2408–17 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22547603 | pmc = 3675696 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2011.39.1110 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19851045"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rybak LP, Mukherjea D, Jajoo S, Ramkumar V | title = Cisplatin ototoxicity and protection: clinical and experimental studies | journal = The Tohoku Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 219 | issue = 3 | pages = 177–86 | date = Nov 2009 | pmid = 19851045 | pmc = 2927105 | doi = 10.1620/tjem.219.177 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other side-effects ===
Less common side-effects include red skin ([[erythema]]), dry skin, damaged fingernails, a dry mouth ([[xerostomia]]), [[Water retention (medicine)|water retention]], and [[sexual impotence]]. Some medications can trigger [[allergic]] or [[pseudoallergic]] reactions.

Specific chemotherapeutic agents are associated with organ-specific toxicities, including [[cardiovascular disease]] (e.g., [[doxorubicin]]), [[interstitial lung disease]] (e.g., [[bleomycin]]) and occasionally [[secondary neoplasm]] (e.g., [[MOPP (medicine)|MOPP]] therapy for Hodgkin's disease).

[[Chemotherapy-induced acral erythema|Hand-foot syndrome]] is another side effect to cytotoxic chemotherapy.

== Limitations ==
Chemotherapy does not always work, and even when it is useful, it may not completely destroy the cancer. People frequently fail to understand its limitations. In one study of people who had been newly diagnosed with incurable, [[Stage-4 cancer|stage 4 cancer]], more than two-thirds of people with lung cancer and more than four-fifths of people with colorectal cancer still believed that chemotherapy was likely to cure their cancer.&lt;ref name=Weeks&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weeks JC, Catalano PJ, Cronin A, Finkelman MD, Mack JW, Keating NL, Schrag D | title = Patients' expectations about effects of chemotherapy for advanced cancer | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 367 | issue = 17 | pages = 1616–25 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 23094723 | pmc = 3613151 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1204410 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[blood–brain barrier]] poses an obstacle to delivery of chemotherapy to the [[brain]]. This is because the brain has an extensive system in place to protect it from harmful chemicals. Drug transporters can pump out drugs from the brain and brain's blood vessel cells into the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] and blood circulation. These transporters pump out most chemotherapy drugs, which reduces their efficacy for treatment of brain tumors. Only small [[lipophilic]] [[alkylating agents]] such as [[lomustine]] or [[temozolomide]] are able to cross this blood–brain barrier.&lt;ref name="pmid17363519"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Deeken JF, Löscher W | title = The blood-brain barrier and cancer: transporters, treatment, and Trojan horses | journal = Clinical Cancer Research | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 1663–74 | date = Mar 2007 | pmid = 17363519 | doi = 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-2854 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid10794805"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Agarwala SS, Kirkwood JM | title = Temozolomide, a novel alkylating agent with activity in the central nervous system, may improve the treatment of advanced metastatic melanoma | journal = The Oncologist | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 144–51 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10794805 | doi = 10.1634/theoncologist.5-2-144 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17538177"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gerstner ER, Fine RL | title = Increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier to chemotherapy in metastatic brain tumors: establishing a treatment paradigm | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 25 | issue = 16 | pages = 2306–12 | date = Jun 2007 | pmid = 17538177 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2006.10.0677 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Blood vessel]]s in tumors are very different from those seen in normal tissues. As a tumor grows, tumor cells furthest away from the blood vessels become low in oxygen ([[Tumor hypoxia|hypoxic]]). To counteract this they then signal for new blood vessels to grow. The newly formed tumor vasculature is poorly formed and does not deliver an adequate blood supply to all areas of the tumor. This leads to issues with drug delivery because many drugs will be delivered to the tumor by the [[circulatory system]].&lt;ref name="pmid16862189"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Minchinton AI, Tannock IF | title = Drug penetration in solid tumours | journal = Nature Reviews. Cancer | volume = 6 | issue = 8 | pages = 583–92 | date = Aug 2006 | pmid = 16862189 | doi = 10.1038/nrc1893 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resistance ==
[[Drug resistance|Resistance]] is a major cause of treatment failure in chemotherapeutic drugs. There are a few possible causes of resistance in cancer, one of which is the presence of small pumps on the surface of cancer cells that actively move chemotherapy from inside the cell to the outside. Cancer cells produce high amounts of these pumps, known as [[p-glycoprotein]], in order to protect themselves from chemotherapeutics. Research on [[p-glycoprotein]] and other such chemotherapy efflux pumps is currently ongoing. Medications to inhibit the function of [[p-glycoprotein]] are undergoing investigation, but due to toxicities and interactions with anti-cancer drugs their development has been difficult.&lt;ref name="pmid12591977"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Goldman B | title = Multidrug resistance: can new drugs help chemotherapy score against cancer? | journal = Journal of the National Cancer Institute | volume = 95 | issue = 4 | pages = 255–7 | date = Feb 2003 | pmid = 12591977 | doi = 10.1093/jnci/95.4.255 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | name-list-format = vanc |author1=E.

Generating Inhibitors of P-Glycoprotein: Where to, Now?|year=2009|publisher=Springer Protocols|pages=405–432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another mechanism of resistance is [[gene duplication|gene amplification]], a process in which multiple copies of a gene are produced by cancer cells. This overcomes the effect of drugs that reduce the expression of genes involved in replication. With more copies of the gene, the drug can not prevent all expression of the gene and therefore the cell can restore its proliferative ability. Cancer cells can also cause defects in the cellular pathways of [[apoptosis]] (programmed cell death). As most chemotherapy drugs kill cancer cells in this manner, defective apoptosis allows survival of these cells, making them resistant. Many chemotherapy drugs also cause DNA damage, which can be repaired by [[enzyme]]s in the cell that carry out [[DNA repair]]. Upregulation of these genes can overcome the DNA damage and prevent the induction of apoptosis. Mutations in genes that produce drug target proteins, such as [[tubulin]], can occur which prevent the drugs from binding to the protein, leading to resistance to these types of drugs.&lt;ref name="pmid16103712"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Luqmani YA | title = Mechanisms of drug resistance in cancer chemotherapy | journal = Medical Principles and Practice | volume = 14 Suppl 1 | issue =  | pages = 35–48 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16103712 | doi = 10.1159/000086183 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drugs used in chemotherapy can induce cell stress, which can kill a cancer cell; however, under certain conditions, cells stress can induce changes in gene expression that enables resistance to several types of drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moschovi|first1=Maria|title=Drugs acting on homeostasis: challenging cancer cell adaptation.|journal=Expert Rev Anticancer Ther.|volume=15|issue=12|pages=1405–17|doi=10.1586/14737140.2015.1095095|pmid=26523494|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1586/14737140.2015.1095095?journalCode=iery20|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cytotoxics and targeted therapies ==
[[Targeted therapy|Targeted therapies]] are a relatively new class of cancer drugs that can overcome many of the issues seen with the use of cytotoxics. They are divided into two groups: small molecule and antibodies. The massive toxicity seen with the use of cytotoxics is due to the lack of cell specificity of the drugs. They will kill any rapidly dividing cell, tumor or normal. Targeted therapies are designed to affect cellular proteins or processes that are utilised by the cancer cells. This allows a high dose to cancer tissues with a relatively low dose to other tissues. Although the [[adverse effects|side effects]] are often less severe than that seen of cytotoxic chemotherapeutics, life-threatening effects can occur. Initially, the targeted therapeutics were supposed to be solely selective for one protein. Now it is clear that there is often a range of protein targets that the drug can bind. An example target for targeted therapy is the protein produced by the [[Philadelphia chromosome]], a genetic lesion found commonly in [[chronic myelomonocytic leukemia]]. This fusion protein has enzyme activity that can be inhibited by [[imatinib]], a [[small molecule]] drug.&lt;ref name="pmid18297955"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gerber DE | title = Targeted therapies: a new generation of cancer treatments | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 77 | issue = 3 | pages = 311–9 | date = Feb 2008 | pmid = 18297955 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12360278"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Allen TM | title = Ligand-targeted therapeutics in anticancer therapy | journal = Nature Reviews.

In the broad sense, most chemotherapeutic drugs work by impairing [[mitosis]] ([[cell division]]), effectively targeting [[fast-dividing cells]]. As these drugs cause damage to cells, they are termed ''cytotoxic''. They prevent mitosis by various mechanisms including damaging DNA and inhibition of the cellular machinery involved in cell division.&lt;ref name="pmid14508075"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Malhotra V, Perry MC | title = Classical chemotherapy: mechanisms, toxicities and the therapeutic window | journal = Cancer Biology &amp; Therapy | volume = 2 | issue = 4 Suppl 1 | pages = S2–4 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14508075 | doi=10.4161/cbt.199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19651324"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kehe K, Balszuweit F, Steinritz D, Thiermann H | title = Molecular toxicology of sulfur mustard-induced cutaneous inflammation and blistering | journal = Toxicology | volume = 263 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–9 | date = Sep 2009 | pmid = 19651324 | doi = 10.1016/j.tox.2009.01.019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One theory as to why these drugs kill cancer cells is that they induce a programmed form of cell death known as [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref name="pmid10928287"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Makin G, Hickman JA | title = Apoptosis and cancer chemotherapy | journal = Cell and Tissue Research | volume = 301 | issue = 1 | pages = 143–52 | date = Jul 2000 | pmid = 10928287 | doi = 10.1007/s004419900160 | bibcode = 1994RSPTB.345..319H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As chemotherapy affects cell division, tumors with high [[proliferative index|growth rates]] (such as [[acute myelogenous leukemia]] and the aggressive [[lymphoma]]s, including [[Hodgkin's disease]]) are more sensitive to chemotherapy, as a larger proportion of the targeted cells are undergoing [[cell division]] at any time.

Cells from the [[immune system]] also make crucial contributions to the antitumor effects of chemotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zitvogel|first1=L|last2=Apetoh|first2=L|last3=Ghiringhelli|first3=F|last4=Kroemer|first4=G|title=Immunological aspects of cancer chemotherapy.|journal=Nat Rev Immunol|date=Jan 2008|volume=8|issue=1|pages=59–73|doi=10.1038/nri2216|pmid=18097448|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nri2216}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the chemotherapeutic drugs [[oxaliplatin]] and [[cyclophosphamide]] can cause tumor cells to die in a way that is detectable by the immune system (called [[immunogenic cell death]]), which mobilizes immune cells with antitumor functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galluzzi|first1=L|last2=Buqué|first2=A|last3=Kepp|first3=O|last4=Zitvogel|first4=L|last5=Kroemer|first5=G|title=Immunogenic cell death in cancer and infectious disease|journal=Nat Rev Immunol|date=Feb 2017|volume=17|issue=2|pages=97–111|doi=10.1038/nri.2016.107|pmid=27748397|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nri.2016.107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemotherapeutic drugs that cancer immunogenic tumor cell death can make unresponsive tumors sensitive to [[immune checkpoint]] therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pfirschke|first1=C|last2=Engblom|first2=C|last3=Rickelt|first3=S|last4=Cortez-Retamozo|first4=V|last5=Garris|first5=C|last6=Pucci|first6=F|last7=Yamazaki|first7=T|last8=Poirier-Colame|first8=V|last9=Newton|first9=A|last10=Redouane|first10=Y|last11=Lin|first11=YJ|last12=Wojtkiewicz|first12=G|last13=Iwamoto|first13=Y|last14=Mino-Kenudson|first14=M|last15=Huynh|first15=TG|last16=Hynes|first16=RO|last17=Freeman|first17=GJ|last18=Kroemer|first18=G|last19=Zitvogel|first19=L|last20=Weissleder|first20=R|last21=Pittet|first21=MJ|title=Immunogenic Chemotherapy Sensitizes Tumors to Checkpoint Blockade Therapy|journal=Immunity|date=Feb 2016|volume=44|issue=2|pages=343–54|doi=10.1016/j.immuni.2015.11.024|pmid=26872698|pmc=4758865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemotherapy drugs are also used in [[conditioning regimen]]s prior to bone marow transplant ([[hematopoietic stem cell transplant]]). Conditioning regimens are used to suppress the recipient's immune system in order to allow a transplant to engraft.

Chemotherapeutic drugs may be used at high doses to permanently remove the recipient's bone marrow cells (myeloablative conditioning) or at lower doses that will prevent permanent bone marrow loss (non-myeloablative and reduced intensity conditioning).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bacigalupo A, Ballen K, Rizzo D, Giralt S, Lazarus H, Ho V, Apperley J, Slavin S, Pasquini M, Sandmaier BM, Barrett J, Blaise D, Lowski R, Horowitz M | title = Defining the intensity of conditioning regimens: working definitions | journal = Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation | volume = 15 | issue = 12 | pages = 1628–33 | date = Dec 2009 | pmid = 19896087 | pmc = 2861656 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.07.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When used in non-cancer setting, the treatment is still called "chemotherapy", and is often done in the same treatment centers used for people with cancer.

== Antineoplastic (Chemotherapy) Drugs Occupational Exposure and Safe Handling ==

=== Background ===
In the 1970s, antineoplastic drugs were identified as hazardous, and the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) has since then introduced the concept of hazardous drugs after publishing a recommendation in 1983 regarding handling hazardous drugs. The adaptation of federal regulations came when the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) first released its guidelines in 1986 and then updated them in 1996, 1999, and, most recently, 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SORSA|first=M.|last2=HAMEILA|first2=M.|last3=JARVILUOMA|first3=E.|date=2006-09-01|title=Handling Anticancer Drugs: From Hazard Identification to Risk Management?|url=https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1196/annals.1371.008|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=1076|issue=1|pages=628–634|doi=10.1196/annals.1371.008|issn=0077-8923}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has been conducting an assessment in the workplace since then regarding these drugs. Occupational exposure to antineoplastic drugs has been linked to multiple health effects, including infertility and possible carcinogenic effects. A few cases have been reported by the NIOSH alert report, such as one in which a female pharmacist was diagnosed with papillary transitional cell carcinoma. Twelve years before the pharmacist was diagnosed with the condition, she had worked for 20 months in a hospital where she was responsible for preparing multiple antineoplastic drugs&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theoncologypharmacist.com/top-issues/2014-issues/february-2014-vol-7-no-1/16084-chemotherapy-biomarkers-of-exposure-effect-reproductive-hazards-and-cancer|title=Chemotherapy: Biomarkers of Exposure, Effect, Reproductive Hazards, and Cancer|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The pharmacist didn't have any other risk factor for cancer, and therefore, her cancer was attributed to the exposure to the antineoplastic drugs, although a cause-and-effect relationship has not been established in the literature. Another case happened when a malfunction in biosafety cabinetry is believed to have exposed nursing personnel to antineoplastic drugs. Investigations revealed evidence of genotoxic biomarkers two and nine months after that exposure.

=== Potential occupational exposure ===
Antineoplastic drugs are usually given through intravenous, intramuscular. intrathecal, or subcutaneous administration. In most cases, before the medication is administered to the patient, it needs to be prepared and handled by several workers. Any worker who is involved in handling, preparing, or administering the drugs, or with cleaning objects that have come into contact with antineoplastic drugs, is potentially exposed to hazardous drugs. Health care workers are exposed to drugs in different circumstances, such as when pharmacists and pharmacy technicians prepare and handle antineoplastic drugs and when nurses and physicians administer the drugs to patients. Additionally, those who are responsible for disposing antineoplastic drugs in health care facilities are also at risk of exposure&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/wp-solutions/2009-106/|title=Personal protective equipment for health care workers who work with hazardous drugs|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== '''Route of exposure''' ===
Dermal exposure is thought to be the main route of exposure due to the fact that significant amounts of the antineoplastic agents have been found in the gloves worn by healthcare workers who prepare, handle, and administer the agents. Another noteworthy route of exposure is inhalation of the drugs' vapors. Multiple studies have investigated inhalation as a route of exposure, and although air sampling has not shown any dangerous levels, it is still a potential route of exposure. Ingestion by hand to mouth is a route of exposure that is less likely compared to others because of the enforced hygienic standard in the health institutions. However, it is still a potential route, especially in the workplace, outside of a health institute. One can also be exposed to these hazardous drugs through injection by needle sticks. Research conducted in this area has established that occupational exposure occurs by examining evidence in multiple urine samples from health care workers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Antineoplastic drugs: Occupational exposure and health risks|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2006|isbn=90-393-4331-4|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Health effect in occupational exposure ===
Hazardous drugs expose health care workers to serious health risks. Many studies show that antineoplastic drugs could have many side effects on the reproductive system, such as fetal loss, congenital malformation, and infertility. Health care workers who are exposed to antineoplastic drugs on many occasions have adverse reproductive outcomes such as spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and congenital malformations. Moreover, studies have shown that exposure to these drugs leads to menstrual cycle irregularities. Antineoplastic drugs may also increase the risk of learning disabilities among children of health care workers who are exposed to these hazardous substances. 

Moreover, these drugs have carcinogenic effects. In the past five decades, multiple studies have shown the carcinogenic effects of exposure to antineoplastic drugs. Similarly, there have been research studies that linked alkylating agents with humans developing leukemias. Studies have reported elevated risk of breast cancer, nonmelanoma skin cancer, and cancer of the rectum among nurses who are exposed to these drugs. Other investigations revealed that there is a potential genotoxic effect from anti-neoplastic drugs to workers in health care settings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Current standard exposure limit ===
As of 2018, there were no occupational exposure limits set for antineoplastic drugs, i.e., OSHA or the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) have not set workplace safety guidelines.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2004-165/pdfs/2004-165.pdf|title=preventing occupational exposure to antineoplastic and other hazardous drugs in health care settings|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Occupational safe handling in health care settings ===

==== Drugs Preparation ====
NIOSH recommends using a ventilated cabinet that is designed to decrease worker exposure. Additionally, it recommends training of all staff, the use of cabinets, implementing an initial evaluation of the technique of the safety program, and wearing protective gloves and gowns when opening drug packaging, handling vials, or labeling. When wearing personal protective equipment, one should inspect gloves for physical defects before use and always wear double gloves and protective gowns. Health care workers are also required to wash their hands with water and soap before and after working with antineoplastic drugs, change gloves every 30 minutes or whenever punctured, and discard them immediately in a chemotherapy waste container&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lni.wa.gov/Safety/Topics/AtoZ/HazardousDrugs/ProgramGuides.asp|title=Hazardous Drugs Program Guides|website=www.lni.wa.gov|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The gowns used should be disposable gowns made of polyethylene-coated polypropylene. When wearing gowns, individuals should make sure that the gowns are closed and have long sleeves. When preparation is done, the final product should be completely sealed in a plastic bag.

The health care worker should also wipe all waste containers inside the ventilated cabinet before removing them from the cabinet. Finally, workers should remove all protective wear and put them in a bag for their disposal inside the ventilated cabinet.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Drugs Administration ====
Drugs should only be administered using protective medical devices such as needle lists and closed systems and techniques such as priming of IV tubing by pharmacy personnel inside a ventilated cabinet. Workers should always wear personal protective equipment such as double gloves, goggles, and protective gowns when opening the outer bag and assembling the delivery system to deliver the drug to the patient, and when disposing of all material used in the administration of the drugs&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. 

Hospital workers should never remove tubing from an IV bag that contains an antineoplastic drug, and when disconnecting the tubing in the system, they should make sure the tubing has been thoroughly flushed. After removing the IV bag, the workers should place it together with other disposable items directly in the yellow chemotherapy waste container with the lid closed. Protective equipment should be removed and put into a disposable chemotherapy waste container. After this has been done, one should double bag the chemotherapy waste before or after removing one’s inner gloves. Moreover, one must always wash one’s hands with soap and water before leaving the drug administration site&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Infectious and Medical Waste Management|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=9781315894430|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Employee Training ====
All employees whose jobs in health care facilities expose them to hazardous drugs must receive training. Training should include shipping and receiving personnel, housekeepers, pharmacists, assistants, and all individuals involved in the transportation and storage of antineoplastic drugs. These individuals should receive information and training to inform them of the hazards of the drugs present in their areas of work. They should be informed and trained on operations and procedures in their work areas where they can encounter hazards, different methods used to detect the presence of hazardous drugs and how the hazards are released, and the physical and health hazards of the drugs, including their reproductive and carcinogenic hazard potential. Additionally, they should be informed and trained on the measures they should take to avoid and protect themselves from these hazards. This information ought to be provided when health care workers come into contact with the drugs, that is, perform the initial assignment in a work area with hazardous drugs. Moreover, training should also be provided when new hazards emerge as well as when new drugs, procedures, or equipment are introduced&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

==== Housekeeping and Waste Disposal ====
When performing cleaning and decontaminating the work area where antineoplastic drugs are used, one should make sure that there is sufficient ventilation to prevent the buildup of airborne drug concentrations. When cleaning the work surface, hospital workers should use deactivation and cleaning agents before and after each activity as well as at the end of their shifts. Cleaning should always be done using double protective gloves and disposable gowns. After employees finish up cleaning, they should dispose of the items used in the activity in a yellow chemotherapy waste container while still wearing protective gloves. After removing the gloves, they should thoroughly wash their hands with soap and water. Anything that comes into contact or has a trace of the antineoplastic drugs, such as needles, empty vials, syringes, gowns, and gloves, should be put in the chemotherapy waste container&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.searo.who.int/srilanka/documents/safe_management_of_wastes_from_healthcare_activities.pdf?ua=1|title=Safe management of wastes from health-care activities|last=|first=|date=|website=WHO|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Spill Control ====
A written policy needs to be in place in case of a spill of antineoplastic products. The policy should address the possibility of various sizes of spills as well as the procedure and personal protective equipment required for each size. A trained worker should handle a large spill and always dispose of all cleanup materials in the chemical waste container according to EPA regulations, not in a yellow chemotherapy waste container&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DeJoy|first=David M.|last2=Smith|first2=Todd D.|last3=Woldu|first3=Henok|last4=Dyal|first4=Mari-Amanda|last5=Steege|first5=Andrea L.|last6=Boiano|first6=James M.|date=2017-03-22|title=Effects of organizational safety practices and perceived safety climate on PPE usage, engineering controls, and adverse events involving liquid antineoplastic drugs among nurses|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1080%2F15459624.2017.1285496|journal=Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene|language=en|volume=14|issue=7|pages=485–493|doi=10.1080/15459624.2017.1285496|issn=1545-9624}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Occupational monitoring ===
A medical surveillance program must be established. In case of exposure, occupational health professionals need to ask for a detailed history and do a thorough physical exam. They should test the urine of the potentially exposed worker by doing a urine dipstick or microscopic examination, mainly looking for blood, as several antineoplastic drugs are known to cause bladder damage&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

==== Urine sample for mutagenicity ====
Urinary mutagenicity is a marker of exposure to antineoplastic drugs that was first used by Falck and colleagues in 1979 and uses bacterial mutagenicity assays. Apart from being nonspecific, the test can be influenced by extraneous factors such as dietary intake and smoking and is, therefore, used sparingly. However, the test played a significant role in changing the use of horizontal flow cabinets to vertical flow biological safety cabinets during the preparation of antineoplastic drugs because the former exposed health care workers to high levels of drugs. This changed the handling of drugs and effectively reduced workers’ exposure to antineoplastic drugs&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. 

==== Urinary Excretion of Drugs/Metabolites ====
Biomarkers of exposure to antineoplastic drugs commonly include urinary platinum, methotrexate, urinary cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide, and urinary metabolite of 5-fluorouracil. In addition to this, there are other drugs used to measure the drugs directly in the urine, although they are rarely used. A measurement of these drugs directly in one’s urine is a sign of high exposure levels and that an uptake of the drugs is happening either through inhalation or dermally&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

[[File:Sidney Farber nci-vol-1926-300.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Sidney Farber]] is regarded as the father of modern chemotherapy.]]
The first use of [[small-molecule drug]]s to treat cancer was in the early 20th century, although the specific chemicals first used were not originally intended for that purpose. [[Mustard gas]] was used as a [[chemical warfare]] agent during [[World War I]] and was discovered to be a potent suppressor of [[hematopoiesis]] (blood production).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Krumbhaar EB |title=Role of the blood and the bone marrow in certain forms of gas poisoning |journal=JAMA |volume=72 |pages=39–41 |year=1919 |doi=10.1001/jama.1919.26110010018009f }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar family of compounds known as [[nitrogen mustards]] were studied further during [[World War II]] at the [[Yale School of Medicine]].&lt;ref name="Fenn"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fenn JE, Udelsman R | title = First use of intravenous chemotherapy cancer treatment: rectifying the record | journal = Journal of the American College of Surgeons | volume = 212 | issue = 3 | pages = 413–417 | date = Mar 2011 | pmid = 21247779 | doi = 10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2010.10.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reasoned that an agent that damaged the rapidly growing white blood cells might have a similar effect on cancer.&lt;ref name="Fenn" /&gt; Therefore, in December 1942, several people with advanced [[lymphomas]] (cancers of the lymphatic system and lymph nodes) were given the drug by vein, rather than by breathing the irritating gas.&lt;ref name="Fenn" /&gt; Their improvement, although temporary, was remarkable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1 =Goodman LS |author1-link=Louis S.

The survivors were later found to have very low white blood cell counts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | name-list-format = vanc |last = Faguet|first = Guy B.|title = The War on Cancer|publisher = Springer|year = 2005|page = 71|isbn = 1-4020-3618-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; After WWII was over and the reports declassified, the experiences converged and led researchers to look for other substances that might have similar effects against cancer. The first chemotherapy drug to be developed from this line of research was [[mustine]]. Since then, many other drugs have been developed to treat cancer, and drug development has exploded into a multibillion-dollar industry, although the principles and limitations of chemotherapy discovered by the early researchers still apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Joensuu H | title = Systemic chemotherapy for cancer: from weapon to treatment | journal = The Lancet. Oncology | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | page = 304 | date = Mar 2008 | pmid = 18308256 | doi = 10.1016/S1470-2045(08)70075-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The term ''chemotherapy'' ===
The word ''chemotherapy'' without a modifier usually refers to cancer treatment, but its historical meaning was broader. The term was coined in the early 1900s by [[Paul Ehrlich]] as meaning any use of chemicals to treat any disease (''[[wikt:chemo-|chemo]]-'' + ''[[wikt:-therapy|-therapy]]''), such as the use of [[antibiotic]]s (''antibacterial chemotherapy'').&lt;ref name="DeVita"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=DeVita VT, Chu E | title = A history of cancer chemotherapy | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 68 | issue = 21 | pages = 8643–53 | date = Nov 2008 | pmid = 18974103 | doi = 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-6611 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ehrlich was not optimistic that effective chemotherapy drugs would be found for the treatment of cancer.&lt;ref name="DeVita" /&gt;  The first modern chemotherapeutic agent was [[arsphenamine]], an arsenic compound discovered in 1907 and used to treat [[syphilis]].&lt;ref name="pmid19868743"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nichols HJ, Walker JE | title = EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE PROPHYLAXIS AND TREATMENT OF SYPHILIS | journal = The Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 525–42 | date = Mar 1923 | pmid = 19868743 | pmc = 2128372 | doi = 10.1084/jem.37.4.525 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later followed by [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamides]] (sulfa drugs) and [[penicillin]]. In today's [[usage]], the [[word sense|sense]] "any treatment of disease with drugs" is often expressed with the word ''[[pharmacotherapy]]''.

{{Main|Experimental cancer treatments}}

=== Targeted therapies ===
Specially targeted delivery vehicles aim to increase effective levels of chemotherapy for tumor cells while reducing effective levels for other cells. This should result in an increased tumor kill or reduced toxicity or both.&lt;ref name="pmid21501554"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chidambaram M, Manavalan R, Kathiresan K | title = Nanotherapeutics to overcome conventional cancer chemotherapy limitations | journal = Journal of Pharmacy &amp; Pharmaceutical Sciences | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 67–77 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21501554 | doi =  10.18433/J30C7D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Antibody-drug conjugates ====
[[Antibody-drug conjugate]]s (ADCs) comprise an [[antibody]], drug and a linker between them. The antibody will be targeted at a preferentially expressed protein in the tumour cells (known as a [[tumor antigen]]) or on cells that the tumor can utilise, such as blood vessel [[endothelial cells]]. They bind to the tumor antigen and are internalised, where the linker releases the drug into the cell. These specially targeted delivery vehicles vary in their stability, selectivity, and choice of target, but, in essence, they all aim to increase the maximum effective dose that can be delivered to the tumor cells.&lt;ref name="pmid22003066"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Teicher BA, Chari RV | title = Antibody conjugate therapeutics: challenges and potential | journal = Clinical Cancer Research | volume = 17 | issue = 20 | pages = 6389–97 | date = Oct 2011 | pmid = 22003066 | doi = 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-1417 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reduced systemic toxicity means that they can also be used in people who are sicker, and that they can carry new chemotherapeutic agents that would have been far too toxic to deliver via traditional systemic approaches.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The first approved drug of this type was [[gemtuzumab ozogamicin]] (Mylotarg), released by [[Wyeth]] (now [[Pfizer]]). The drug was approved to treat [[acute myeloid leukemia]], but has now been withdrawn from the market because the drug did not meet efficacy targets in further clinical trials.&lt;ref name="pmid11673694"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sievers EL, Linenberger M | title = Mylotarg: antibody-targeted chemotherapy comes of age | journal = Current Opinion in Oncology | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 522–7 | date = Nov 2001 | pmid = 11673694 | doi = 10.1097/00001622-200111000-00016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=FDA|title=Mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin): Market Withdrawal|url=http://www.fda.gov/safety/medwatch/safetyinformation/safetyalertsforhumanmedicalproducts/ucm216458.htm|accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other drugs, [[trastuzumab emtansine]] and [[brentuximab vedotin]], are both in late clinical trials, and the latter has been granted accelerated approval for the treatment of [[refractory]] [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]] and systemic [[anaplastic large cell lymphoma]].&lt;ref name="pmid22003066" /&gt;

==== Nanoparticles ====
[[Nanoparticles]] are 1–1000 [[nanometer]] (nm) sized particles that can promote tumor selectivity and aid in delivering low-[[solubility]] drugs. Nanoparticles can be targeted passively or actively. Passive targeting exploits the difference between tumor blood vessels and normal blood vessels. Blood vessels in tumors are "leaky" because they have gaps from 200–2000&amp;nbsp;nm, which allow nanoparticles to escape into the tumor. Active targeting uses biological molecules ([[Antibody|antibodies]], [[protein]]s, [[DNA]] and [[receptor ligand]]s) to preferentially target the nanoparticles to the tumor cells. There are many types of nanoparticle delivery systems, such as [[mesoporous silica|silica]], [[polymer]]s, [[liposome]]s and [[magnetic particles]]. Nanoparticles made of magnetic material can also be used to concentrate agents at tumor sites using an externally applied magnetic field.&lt;ref name="pmid21501554" /&gt;  They have emerged as a useful vehicle in [[magnetic drug delivery]] for poorly soluble agents such as [[paclitaxel]].&lt;ref name="pmid19554862"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vines T, Faunce T | title = Assessing the safety and cost-effectiveness of early nanodrugs | journal = Journal of Law and Medicine | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 822–45 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19554862 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electrochemotherapy ===
{{Main|Electrochemotherapy}}
Electrochemotherapy is the combined treatment in which injection of a chemotherapeutic drug is followed by application of high-voltage electric pulses locally to the tumor. The treatment enables the chemotherapeutic drugs, which otherwise cannot or hardly go through the membrane of cells (such as bleomycin and cisplatin), to enter the cancer cells. Hence, greater effectiveness of antitumor treatment is achieved.

Clinical electrochemotherapy has been successfully used for treatment of cutaneous and subcutaneous tumors irrespective of their histological origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heller R, Gilbert R, Jaroszeski MJ | title = Clinical applications of electrochemotherapy | journal = Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 119–129 | date = Jan 1999 | pmid = 10837693 | doi = 10.1016/S0169-409X(98)00067-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Larkin JO, Collins CG, Aarons S, Tangney M, Whelan M, O'Reily S, Breathnach O, Soden DM, O'Sullivan GC | title = Electrochemotherapy: aspects of preclinical development and early clinical experience | journal = Annals of Surgery | volume = 245 | issue = 3 | pages = 469–479 | date = Mar 2007 | pmid = 17435555 | pmc = 1877027 | doi = 10.1097/01.sla.0000250419.36053.33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marty M, Sersa G, Garbay JR, Gehl J, Collins CG, Snoj M, Billard V, Geertsen PF, Larkin JO, Miklavcic D, Pavlovic I, Paulin-Kosir SM, Cemazar M, Morsli N, Soden DM, Rudolf Z, Robert C, O'Sullivan GC, Mir LM. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marty M, Sersa G, Garbay JR, Gehl J, Collins CG, Snoj M, Billard V, Geertsen PF, Larkin JO, Miklavcic D, Pavlovic I, Paulin-Kosir SM, Cemazar M, Morsli N, Soden DM, Rudolf Z, Robert C, O'Sullivan GC, Mir LM |title=Electrochemotherapy – An easy, highly effective and safe treatment of cutaneous and subcutaneous metastases |pages=3–13 |journal=Eur J Cancer Suppl |volume=4 |issue=11 |year=2006|doi=10.1016/j.ejcsup.2006.08.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Möller MG, Salwa S, Soden DM, O'Sullivan GC | title = Electrochemotherapy as an adjunct or alternative to other treatments for unresectable or in-transit melanoma | journal = Expert Review of Anticancer Therapy | volume = 9 | issue = 11 | pages = 1611–1630 | date = Nov 2009 | pmid = 19895245 | doi = 10.1586/era.09.129 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Testori A, Tosti G, Martinoli C, Spadola G, Cataldo F, Verrecchia F, Baldini F, Mosconi M, Soteldo J, Tedeschi I, Passoni C, Pari C, Di Pietro A, Ferrucci PF | title = Electrochemotherapy for cutaneous and subcutaneous tumor lesions: a novel therapeutic approach | journal = Dermatologic Therapy | volume = 23 | issue = 6 | pages = 651–661 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21054709 | doi = 10.1111/j.1529-8019.2010.01370.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hampton T | title = Electric pulses help with chemotherapy, may open new paths for other agents | journal = JAMA | volume = 305 | issue = 6 | pages = 549–551 | date = Feb 2011 | pmid = 21304073 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2011.92 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The method has been reported as safe, simple and highly effective in all reports on clinical use of electrochemotherapy.

=== Hyperthermia therapy ===
[[Hyperthermia therapy]] is heat treatment for cancer that can be a powerful tool when used in combination with chemotherapy (thermochemotherapy) or radiation for the control of a variety of cancers.  The heat can be applied locally to the tumor site, which will dilate blood vessels to the tumor, allowing more chemotherapeutic medication to enter the tumor.  Additionally, the tumor cell membrane will become more porous, further allowing more of the chemotherapeutic medicine to enter the tumor cell.

Hyperthermia has also been shown to help prevent or reverse "chemo-resistance."  Chemotherapy resistance sometimes develops over time as the tumors adapt and can overcome the toxicity of the chemo medication. "Overcoming chemoresistance has been extensively studied within the past, especially using CDDP-resistant cells. In regard to the potential benefit that drug-resistant cells can be recruited for effective therapy by combining chemotherapy with hyperthermia, it was important to show that chemoresistance against several anticancer drugs (e.g. mitomycin C, anthracyclines, BCNU, melphalan) including CDDP could be reversed at least partially by the addition of heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Issels|first=R.|title=Hyperthermia Combined with Chemotherapy – Biological Rationale, Clinical Application, and Treatment Results|journal=Onkologie|year=1999|volume=22|issue=5|pages=374–381|doi=10.1159/000026986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other animals ==
Chemotherapy is used in veterinary medicine similar to how it is used in human medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = McKnight JA | title = Principles of chemotherapy | journal = Clinical Techniques in Small Animal Practice | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 67–72 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12831063 | doi = 10.1053/svms.2003.36617 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2223">'''Clinic management systems''' are computer software products that coordinate and integrate all the inherent activities involved in the management and running of a [[healthcare]] facility.  They must meet specified security, technology and functionality standards for managing electronic medical records and practice management information.  Some systems maintain the complete Patient Information coupled with the [[electronic medical records]] (EMR), [[medical billing]], [[Electronic Data Interchange|EDI]]/[[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|HCFA]] [[claim sending]] and  meeting the stipulated security, technology &amp; functional standards.

Aside from general patient care, a clinic may also participate in running [[clinical trials]]. In order to manage the additional responsibilities in managing a clinical trial, a clinic may also use a [[CTMS]] or [[clinical data management system]] (CDMS) in addition to and combined with their EMR and billing systems.

Healthcare computer system, commonly known as clinic management system, is created to computerize manual operations in clinics. The primary purpose is to digitize patient records so as to make data retrieval easy and efficient. Being in the digital form, patient data can be conveniently shared and accessed by multiple simultaneous users at different locations, resulting in smoother clinical operations and collaboration among clinicians. It also means that patient data can be easily backed up, and be protected for confidentiality and from tampering through access control. In addition, clinical tasks involving panel billing, inventory management and accounting are all made easy, and in some manner automated. Economically, clinics benefit from constant cost savings as a result of increased productivity and overall efficiency. Essentially, everyone in the clinic benefits from the system – doctor, nurse, clerk, administrator and the clinic owner – which makes their lives easy and removes unnecessary human errors from their daily activities.

[[File:Ultrasound of human fetus, 8 weeks and 1 day.jpg|thumb|An ultrasound showing a fetus measured to have a crown-rump length of 1.67 cm, and estimated to have a gestational age of 8 weeks and 1 day]]

'''Crown-rump length''' ('''CRL''') is the measurement of the length of human [[embryo]]s and [[fetus]]es from the top of the head (crown) to the bottom of the buttocks (rump). It is typically determined from [[Obstetric ultrasonography|ultrasound imagery]] and can be used to estimate [[gestational age]].

==Measuring==
[[File:Crown-rump length by gestational age.png|thumb|300px|Diagram showing crown-rump length by [[gestational age]]. The blue line is the [[mean]] and the green area delimits the 3rd versus the 97th [[percentile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ohuma EO, Papageorghiou AT, Villar J, Altman DG |title=Estimation of gestational age in early pregnancy from crown-rump length when gestational age range is truncated: the case study of the INTERGROWTH-21st Project |journal=BMC Med Res Methodol |volume=13 |issue= |pages=151 |year=2013 |pmid=24314232 |pmc=4029763 |doi=10.1186/1471-2288-13-151 |url=}}
&lt;br&gt;Crown rump length before a gestational age of 9 weeks is extrapolated by assuming a crown rump length of 0 at a gestational age of 2 weeks, corresponding to an [[:en:embryonic age|embryonic age]] of 0 weeks. This extrapolated part is blurred because of uncertain values.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The embryo and fetus float in the [[amniotic fluid]] inside the [[uterus]] of the mother usually in a curved posture resembling the letter ''C''. The measurement can actually vary slightly if the fetus is temporarily stretching (straightening) its body. The measurement needs to be in the natural state with an unstretched body which is actually ''C'' shaped. The measurement of CRL is useful in determining the [[gestational age]] (menstrual age starting from the first day of the last menstrual period) and thus the expected date of delivery (EDD). Different babies do grow at different rates and thus the gestational age is an approximation. Recent evidence has indicated that CRL growth (and thus the approximation of gestational age) may be influenced by maternal factors such as age, [[Smoking and pregnancy|smoking]], and folic acid intake. Early in [[pregnancy]] it is accurate within +/- 4 days but later in pregnancy due to different growth rates, the accuracy is less. In that situation, other parameters can be used in addition to CRL. The length of the [[umbilical cord]] is approximately equal to the CRL throughout pregnancy.

Gestational age is not the same as fertilization age. It takes about 14 days from the first day of the last menstrual period for [[Conception (biology)|conception]] to take place and thus for the [[conceptus]] to form. The age from this point in time (conception) is called the fertilization age and is thus 2 weeks shorter than the gestational age. Thus a 6-week gestational age would be a 4-week fertilization age. Some authorities however casually interchange these terms {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} and the reader is advised to be cautious. An average gestational period (duration of pregnancy from the first day of the last menstrual period up to delivery) is 280 days. On average, this is 9 months and 6 days.

===Typical measurements===
{| border="1"
|+ Gestational Age for CRL
! Age !! CRL 
|-
| 6.1 Weeks: || 0.45&amp;nbsp;cm
|-
| 7.1 Weeks: || 1.0&amp;nbsp;cm
|-
| 8.0 Weeks: || 1.9&amp;nbsp;cm
|-
| 9.2 Weeks: || 2.15&amp;nbsp;cm
|-
|9.6 Weeks: ||2.9&amp;nbsp;cm

|-
| 13.2 Weeks: || 6.90&amp;nbsp;cm
|-
| 14.0 Weeks: || 8.0&amp;nbsp;cm

|}

The following formula is an approximation that can be used up to 14 weeks of gestational age, with CRL in [[millimetre|mm]] and gestational age in days:&lt;ref name="LoughnaChitty2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loughna|first1=Pam|last2=Chitty|first2=Lyn|last3=Evans|first3=Tony|last4=Chudleigh|first4=Trish|title=Fetal Size and Dating: Charts Recommended for Clinical Obstetric Practice|journal=Ultrasound|volume=17|issue=3|year=2009|pages=160–166|issn=1742-271X|doi=10.1179/174313409X448543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gestational age = (CRL x 1.037)&lt;sup&gt;0.5&lt;/sup&gt; x 8.052 + 23.73

'''Disability abuse''' is when a person with a disability is abused [[Physical abuse|physically]], [[Financial abuse|financially]], [[Sexual abuse|sexually]] and/or [[Psychological abuse|psychologically]] due to the person having a disability. Since many disabilities are not visible (for example, [[asthma]], [[schizophrenia]], or [[learning disabilities]]) some abusers cannot rationalise the non-physical disability with a need for understanding, support, and so on. Since some disabled people are in need of additional support from others throughout their lives, they are also [[social vulnerability|vulnerable]] to [[neglect]]. Disability abuse has also been considered a [[hate crime]].&lt;ref name=Quarmby&gt;Quarmby, Katharine. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=yIJh7Z0AG84C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Scapegoat: Why we are failing disabled people]". ''Portobello'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The abuse is not limited to those who are visibly disabled such as wheelchair-users or physically deformed such as those with a [[cleft lip]] but also those with [[learning disabilities]] or difficulties such as dyslexia and dysgraphia, and other disabilities, including [[autism spectrum disorder]], [[Down syndrome]]&lt;ref name=Sainsbury&gt;Sainsbury, Clare. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=PvN65iMZveMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Martian in the Playground: Understanding the schoolchild with Asperger's syndrome]".

''Jessica Kingsley Publishers'', 2007, pp 95–111.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[developmental coordination disorder]].&lt;ref name=Kirby&gt;Kirby, Amanda. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=2AvtCQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Dyspraxia: The Hidden Handicap]". ''Souvenir Press'', 1999, pp106-113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brookes&gt;Brookes, Geoff. "Dyspraxia". ''Continuum'', 2005, 2007 (second edition), pp 43–46.&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter case, this is linked to a poor ability in physical education, and this behaviour can be encouraged by an unthinking physical education teacher.{{Who|date=October 2015}} Abuse of the disabled is not limited to schools. There are many known cases in which the disabled have been abused by staff of a care institution, such as the case revealed in a [[BBC]] ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' programme on a Castlebeck care home ([[Winterbourne View]]) near [[Bristol]] which led to its closure and the suspension or dismissal of some of the staff.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news

Those with learning disabilities are often not as able to explain things to other people so are more likely to be disbelieved or ignored if they do complain.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}  There was one study done that shows 60 percent of the children with disabilities come forth about being bullied regularly, versus 25 percent of the students who are being bullied with no disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 10 facts parents, educators, and Students need to Know|url=http://www.pacer.org/bullying/resources/students-with-disabilities/|website=Bullying and Harassment of Students with Disabilities}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This can also affect their learning and school and education.  Their grades are more at risk in dropping, they have a more difficult time concentrating, and there is no interest in school and the learning material.  All of this can lead to the child dropping out of school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 10 facts parents. educators, and students need to know|url=http://www.pacer.org/bullying/resources/students-with-disabilities/|website=National Bullying prevention center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been numerous cases of parents of children with disabilities who have murdered their children because of their disabilities. Sometimes the parents kill themselves alongside their child. It was even advocated by Aristotle in the case of congenital deformity—"As to the exposure of children, let there be a law that no deformed child shall live."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Aristotle (384–322 bc): philosopher and scientist of ancient Greece| pmc=2672651 | pmid=16371395|doi=10.1136/adc.2005.074534|volume=91|year=2006|pages=F75–7 | last1 = Dunn | first1 = PM | journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is documented in various indigenous societies. 
Disabled girls and women are particularly vulnerable to abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=1514 |title=Women and girls with disabilities |format= |work=UN Enable |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bullying==
{{Main article|Bullying}}
Bullying is an aggressive behavior or attitude towards a person that is unwanted.  It is usually a repeated behavior.  There is more than just one type of bullying, there is verbal bullying, social, and physical.  Verbal bullying consist of name calling a person, teasing, and threatening to cause harm to the person.  Social abuse is intentionally leaving a person out while in a social setting or gathering, or taunting the person.  Physical abuse consist of hitting or pushing someone, pulling their hair, tripping them, or breaking their belongings intentionally.  Bullying happens usually before or after school hours, and it is usually done on campus or on the playground of the school.  However, it can also happen while on the school bus or going to and from the school bus.   Bullying can also happen through the internet or through the phone as well, this is known as cyber bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stopbullying.gov/what-is-bullying/definition/|title=Bullying definition|last=|first=|date=|website=Stop Bullying|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 survey by the [[Interactive Autism Network]] found that 63% of children with [[autism]] are bullied in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-204_162-57406540/survey-finds-63-of-children-with-autism-bullied/ |title=Survey finds 63% of children with autism bullied |format= |work=CBS News |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a third of autistic adults said they had been bullied at work in a survey by the UK's [[National Autistic Society]].&lt;ref name="The Independent"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/autistic-adults-bullied-and-not-supported-at-work-poll-shows-7743517.html |title=Autistic adults bullied and not supported at work, poll shows  |work=The Independent (UK) |accessdate= |location=London |first=Sarah |last=Cassidy |date=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

82% of children with learning disability in the UK are bullied, according to [[Mencap]], and 79% are scared to go out in case they are bullied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/jun/18/schools.children | title = Eight of out 10 disabled children bullied, report finds | accessdate = 2016-10-23| date = 2007-06-18| work = Mencap}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey that was done shows that roughly 7 out of 10 people with disabilities have been abused, and that it is an ongoing problem.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.disabilityscoop.com/2013/09/04/survey-abuse-widespread/18652/|title=Survey Finds Disability Abuse Widespread|website=Disability Scoop|access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also found that bullying people with disabilities is a problem that is going on in different countries as well, and that problem is not always surfaced and given attention to.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Bullying is also a cause of disability and exacerbates existing disabilities.

Bullying can take occur in a variety of forms. They aren't always physical. Verbal bullying and nonverbal bullying are the ones that occur very often. Catherine Thornberry and Karin Olson claim that carers often [[Dehumanization|dehumanize]] disabled people, taking away their abilities and qualities that make them a person and lowering them to the level of just an object or a thing. They found that the caregivers or assistants are often the ones who are unintentionally bullying the disabled individuals. The caregivers look at the individuals at lower standard than they do other people, leading to their labeling of disabled individuals as a hate crime.&lt;ref&gt;Thornberry, Catherine, and Karin Olson. "[https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ844468.pdf The Abuse of Individuals with Developmental Disabilities]." Developmental Disabilities Bulletin 33.1-2 (n.d.): 1-19. EBSCO Host. Web. 22 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bullying a child with a disability is considered to be harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pacer.org/bullying/resources/students-with-disabilitie|title=Bullying and Harassment of Students with Disabilities|last=|first=|date=|website=Top 10 facts parents, educators, and students need to know|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual abuse==
{{Main article|Sexual abuse}}
Disabled people are more vulnerable to sexual abuse than the general population for numerous reasons. As they are less likely to report what has happened to them, their rapists are able to get away with the abuse. Victims often not taken seriously due to [[ableism]] which intersects with societal myths about sexual violence, for example, that 'ugly' people aren't raped, since society's beauty standard devalues disability.

According to Valenti-Hein &amp; Schwartz, only 3% of sexual abuse cases involving developmentally disabled people are ever reported, more than 90% of developmentally disabled people will experience sexual abuse at some point in their lives, and 49% will experience 10 or more abusive incidents.&lt;ref name="Leigh Ann Davis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwild.org/Victims%20of%20Crime/Downloads/Research/Vulnerability%20and%20Abuse%20of%20People%20with%20an%20Intellectual%20Disability/Davis%20n.d.pdf |title=People with Mental Retardation &amp; Sexual Abuse |format= |work=by Leigh Ann Davis |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in the ''British Journal of Psychiatry'' by Sequeira, Howlin, &amp; Hollins found that sexual abuse is associated with a higher incidence of psychiatric and behavioural disorder in people with learning disabilities in a case-control study. Sexual abuse was associated with increased rates of mental illness and behavioural problems, and with symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Psychological reactions to abuse were similar to those observed in the general population, but with the addition of stereotypical behaviour. The more serious the abuse, the more severe the symptoms that were reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/183/5/451|title=Psychological disturbance associated with sexual abuse in people with learning disabilities. Case-control study.|vauthors=Sequeira, H, Howlin, P, Hollins, S|journal=British Journal of Psychiatry|volume=183|number=5|year=2003|pages=451–456|doi=10.1192/bjp.183.5.451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual abuse is less likely to be reported by individuals with disabilities. The people that surround these individuals are often found to be less likely to report these cases of abuse. Society sees the disabled as weak and vulnerable targets, making it easy for the abuser to not feel guilty or to blame themselves. More often than not people figure they can trust their physicians or doctors who provide care for these individuals. In a clinical study it was found that the physicians would provide poor quality of care to individuals with disabilities. They would suppress the problems instead of addressing them by giving them drugs to make them be quiet. It was also found that physicians were less likely to report sexual abuse or any abuse that they found present on these individuals. The justified these actions by believing that in society that disabled people matter less than any other person.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Ruth. "[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1017526112637 Physician Unwitting Participation in Abuse and Neglect of Persons with Developmental Disabilities]." Community Mental Health Journal 36.6 (2001): 499–509. Proquest Central. Web. 24 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder==
Extreme disability abuse can lead directly or indirectly to death. In [[Tanzania]], people with [[albinism]] are hunted by witchcraft practitioners for their organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sociocultural aspects of albinism in Sub-Saharan Africa: mutilations and ritual murders committed in east Africa (Burundi and Tanzania)| pmid=20025171 | volume=69 | year=2009| journal=Med Trop (Mars)| pages=449–53 | last1 = Aquaron | first1 = R | last2 = Djatou | first2 = M | last3 = Kamdem | first3 = L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England and Wales over 1700 disability hate crimes were recorded by police in 2011 and 2012, but a review by the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] said that they are 'overlooked' and 'under-reported'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Disability hate crime is 'overlooked and under-reported'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21865264|newspaper=BBC | date=2013-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Awareness Center"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theawarenesscenter.blogspot.co.uk/2002/08/people-with-mental-retardation-sexual.html |title=People with Mental Retardation &amp; Sexual Abuse |work=The Awareness Center |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preparedness can consist of survival measures, preparation that will improve survival in the event of an earthquake, or mitigating measures, that seek to minimise the effect of an earthquake. Common survival measures include storing food and water for an emergency, and educating individuals what to do during an earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/emergency-preparedness-response-recovery/preparedbc/know-the-risks/earthquakes|title=Earthquakes - Province of British Columbia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitigating measures can include firmly securing large items of furniture (such as bookcases and large cabinets), TV and computer screens that may otherwise fall over in an earthquake. Likewise, avoiding storing items above beds or sofas reduces the chance of objects falling on individuals.&lt;ref name="joffe"/&gt;

Planning for a related [[tsunami]], tsunami preparedness, can also be part of earthquake preparedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/emergency-preparedness-response-recovery/preparedbc/know-the-risks/tsunamis|title=Tsunamis - Province of British Columbia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Building design and retrofitting===
{{Main|Seismic retrofit}}
Building codes in earthquake prone areas may have specific requirements designed to increase new buildings' resistance to earthquakes.  Older buildings and homes that are not up to code may be modified to increase their resistance. Modification and earthquake resistant design are also employed in elevated [[freeway]]s and bridges.

Codes are not designed to make buildings earthquake proof in the sense of them suffering zero damage. The goal of most building designs is to reduce earthquake damage to a building such that it protects the lives of occupants and thus tolerance of some limited damage is accepted and considered a necessary tradeoff. A supplement or precursor to retrofitting can be the implementation of earthquake proof furniture.

Earthquake modification techniques and modern building codes are designed to prevent total destruction of buildings for earthquakes of no greater than 8.5 on the [[Richter Scale]].&lt;ref name="SFGate"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.il-st-acad-sci.org/kingdom/geo1001.html|title = What San Francisco didn't learn from the '06 quake |accessdate = 20 June 2011|last = Smith|first = Charles|authorlink = |date=2006-04-15| work = [[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Richter Scale is referenced, the localized shaking intensity is one of the largest factors to be considered in building resiliency.

==Types of preparedness==
The basic theme behind preparedness is to be ready for an earthquake. Preparedness starts with an individual's everyday life and involves items and training that would be useful in an earthquake. Preparedness continues on a continuum from individual preparedness through family preparedness, community preparedness&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/emergency-preparedness-response-recovery/preparedbc/neighbourhood-preparedness|title=In It Together - Province of British Columbia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then business, non-profit and governmental preparedness. Some organisations blend these various levels. Business continuity planning encourages businesses to have a [[Disaster Recovery Plan]]. The US [[FEMA]] breaks down preparedness generally into a pyramid, with citizens on the foundational bottom, on top of which rests local government, state government and federal government in that order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1549-20490-4325/why_prepare.pdf |format=PDF |title=Why Prepare |publisher=Fema.gov |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Non Perishable Food in cabinet.JPG|thumb|Non-perishable food in cabinet]]Children may present particular issues and some planning and resources are directly focused on supporting them. The US [[FEMA]] has advice noting that "Disasters can leave children feeling frightened, confused, and insecure" whether a child has experienced it first hand, had it happen to a friend or simply seen it on television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fema.gov/coping-disaster#4 |title=Coping with Disaster |publisher=FEMA.gov |date=2015-01-31 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with disabilities or other special needs may have special emergency preparation needs. FEMA's suggestions for people with disabilities include having copies of prescriptions, charging devices for medical devices such as motorized wheel chairs and a week's supply of medication readily available.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150211090322/http://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/1390849866881-33d608585d1e0e55ff6fbbb1ad6f4765/ready_Disabilities_R-6_2014.pdf] (archived link, February 11, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Preparedness can also cover pets.

Preparedness can also encompass psychological preparedness: resources are designed to support both community members affected by a disaster and the disaster workers serving them.

A multi-hazard approach, where communities are prepared for several hazards, are more resilient than single hazard approaches and have been gaining popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Scawthorn C, Schneider PJ, Schauer BA (2006b) Natural hazards—the multihazard approach. Nat Hazards Rev 7:39–39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scawthorn C, O’Rourke T, Blackburn F (2006a) The 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire—enduring lessons for fire protection and water supply. Earthq Spectra 22:135–158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="joffe"/&gt;

Long term power outages can cause damage beyond the original disaster that can be mitigated with emergency generators or other power sources to provide an [[emergency power system]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1627-20490-0643/how2022_generator_04_11_r1.pdf |format=PDF |title=Install a Generator for Emergency Power |publisher=Fema.gov |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of Energy]] states: "homeowners, business owners, and local leaders may have to take an active role in dealing with energy disruptions on their own."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.gov/oe/services/energy-assurance/emergency-preparedness/community-guidelines-energy-emergencies |title=Community Guidelines for Energy Emergencies &amp;#124; Department of Energy |publisher=Energy.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major institutions like hospitals, military bases and educational institutions often have extensive backup power systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.burnsmcd.com/Resource_/PressRelease/2894/FileUpload/White-Paper-Microgrid-Effects-Opportunities-for-Utilities-031113.pdf |format=PDF |title=Microgrid Effects and Opportunities for Utilities |publisher=Burnsmcd.com |accessdate=2015-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412130600/http://www.burnsmcd.com/Resource_/PressRelease/2894/FileUpload/White-Paper-Microgrid-Effects-Opportunities-for-Utilities-031113.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Preparedness does not stop at home or at school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ready.gov/plan-for-locations |title=Plan for Locations |publisher=Ready.gov |date=2014-01-30 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] addresses specific emergency preparedness issues hospitals may have to respond to, including maintaining a safe temperature, providing adequate electricity for life support systems and even carrying out evacuations under extreme circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.ahrq.gov/prep/hospevacguide/hospevac2.htm |title=Hospital Evacuation Decision Guide: Chapter 2. Pre-Disaster Self-Assessment |publisher=Archive.ahrq.gov |date=2011-06-30 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; FEMA encourages all businesses to have an emergency response plan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ready.gov/business/implementation/emergency |title=Emergency Response Plan |publisher=Ready.gov |date=2012-12-19 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Small Business Administration]] specifically advises small business owners to also focus emergency preparedness and provides a variety of different worksheets and resources.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sba.gov/content/disaster-preparedness ''Emergency Preparedness''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marked gas shuttoff.JPG|thumb|Marked gas shuttoff]] Given the explosive danger posed by [[natural gas]] leaks, Ready.gov states that "It is vital that all household members know how to shut off natural gas" and that property owners must ensure they have any special tools needed for their particular gas connections. Ready.gov also notes that "It is wise to teach all responsible household members where and how to shut off the electricity," cautioning that individual circuits should be shut off before the main circuit. Ready.gov further states that "It is vital that all household members learn how to shut off the water at the main house valve" and cautions that the possibility that rusty valves might require replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ready.gov/utility-shut-safety |title=Utility Shut-off &amp; Safety |publisher=Ready.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achieving preparedness==
Levels of preparedness generally remain low, despite attempts to increase public awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Joffe H, Rossetto T, Solberg C, O’Connor C (2013) Social representations of earthquakes: a study of people living in three highly seismic areas. Earthq Spectra 29:367–397&lt;/ref&gt;

Various methods exist to promote disaster preparedness, but they are rarely well documented and their efficacy is rarely tested.&lt;ref&gt;Verrucci E et al (2016) Digital engagement methods for earthquake and fire preparedness—a review. Nat Hazards 83:1583&lt;/ref&gt; Hands on training, drills and [[face-to-face interaction]] have proven more successful at changing behaviour.&lt;ref name="joffe"/&gt; Digital methods have also been used,&lt;ref name="joffe"/&gt; including for examples educational [[videogame]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dropcoverholdon.org/beatthequake/game/|title=shakeoutgame|work=dropcoverholdon.org|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sleeping_while_studying.JPG|thumb|Typical example of a sleep deprived college student who is unable to concentrate on her studies, leading to things such as impaired learning and decreased academic performance]]
[[Sleep deprivation]] is simply a condition of having an inadequate amount of sleep. At least 50% of college students exhibit daytime sleepiness due to sleep deprivation compared to 36% of adolescents and adults.&lt;ref name="Hershner_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hershner SD, Chervin RD | title = Causes and consequences of sleepiness among college students | journal = Nature and Science of Sleep | volume = 6 | pages = 73–84 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 25018659 | pmc = 4075951 | doi = 10.2147/NSS.S62907 }}&lt;/ref&gt; College students, on average, get about 6 to 6.9 hours of sleep per night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.uhs.uga.edu/sleep | title = Managing Stress | work = SleepUniversity Health Center | publisher =  University of Georgia University Health Center | access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Stanford University]]'s Department for the Diagnosis and Treatment for Sleep Disorders, the recommended amount of sleep needed for college students is around 8 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://web.stanford.edu/~dement/sleepless.html | title = Sleepless at Stanford | publisher = Stanford University | access-date=2018-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most college students are sleep deprived, as 70.6% of students reported that they get less than 8 hours of sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lund HG, Reider BD, Whiting AB, Prichard JR | title = Sleep patterns and predictors of disturbed sleep in a large population of college students | journal = The Journal of Adolescent Health | volume = 46 | issue = 2 | pages = 124–32 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 20113918 | doi = 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2009.06.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;There are various effects that sleep deprivation can have on college students, including lower academic performance, impaired learning, and decreased physical activity.&lt;ref name="Hershner_2014" /&gt; One primary cause as to why college students experience a lack of sleep is improper sleep hygiene.&lt;ref name="Hershner_2014" /&gt;

== Causes ==

=== Sleep Hygiene ===
Inadequate sleep hygiene is one primary cause as to why college students experience sleep deprivation. [[Sleep hygiene]] is defined as habits or practices that allow for healthy amounts of sleep on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-topics/sleep-hygiene|title=Sleep Hygiene|website=sleepfoundation.org|access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Good sleep hygiene habits include keeping a consistent sleep schedule, having a quiet sleep environment, and avoiding consuming caffeine and alcohol before sleeping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sleepeducation.org/essentials-in-sleep/healthy-sleep-habits|title=Healthy Sleep Habits and Good Sleep Hygiene|website=www.sleepeducation.org|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many students have inadequate sleep hygiene that leads to sleep deprivation.  

==== Alcohol ====

According to a study by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|US Department of Health and Human Services]], approximately 80% of college students have drunk alcohol, with nearly 40% of the students reporting to "binge drinking," or the consumption of an excessive amount of alcohol over a short amount of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collegedrinkingprevention.gov/media/taskforcereport.pdf|title=A Call to Action: Changing the Culture of Drinking at U.S Colleges}}&lt;/ref&gt; While alcohol may help with faster sleep, it can affect the quality of the sleep. Alcohol may effect one's REM sleep, the stage of sleep where most dreams and memories occur and are stored. Without REM sleep, one would go straight into deep sleep. This may be why people who have insomnia resort to consuming alcohol in order to fall asleep. However, this can result in alcohol dependence. Relying on alcohol as a sleeping aid can lead to sleepwalk, sleep talk and memory problems.&lt;ref name="Vita_Talalay"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vitatalalay.com/alcohol-effects-on-sleep|title=Alcohol Effects On Sleep|work=Vita Talalay|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drinking alcohol has also been linked to causing obstructive sleep apnea, where it causes breathing to repeatedly stop and start during sleep.&lt;ref name="Vita_Talalay" /&gt; In addition, it has been proven that alcohol can cause insomnia. Researchers from the [[University of Missouri School of Medicine]] observed the effects of alcohol on sleep. The results showed that drinking alcohol boosted the adenosine levels. Adenosine levels go up when one is awake and go down when one is asleep. The participants in this study had extended periods of regular drinking and as a result, sleep came quickly to them. However, the participants woke up in a few hours and suffered from insomnia.&lt;ref name="Vita_Talalay" /&gt;

==== Technology ====
The blue light that is emitted from the screens of phones, computers and other devices stops the production of melatonin, the hormone that controls the sleep-wake cycle of the circadian rhythm. Reducing the amount of melatonin produced makes it harder to fall and stay asleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sleep.org/articles/ways-technology-affects-sleep/|title=How Technology Impacts Sleep Quality {{!}} Sleep.org|work=Sleep.Org|access-date=2018-02-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2011 poll conducted by the National Sleep Foundation, it reported that approximately 90% of Americans used technology in the hour before bed.&lt;ref name="sleepfoundation"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sleepfoundation.org/media-center/press-release/annual-sleep-america-poll-exploring-connections-communications-technology-use-|title=Annual Sleep in America Poll Exploring Connections with Communications Technology Use and Sleep|website=sleepfoundation.org|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poll noted that young adults and teenagers were more likely to use cell phones, computers, and video game consoles.&lt;ref name="sleepfoundation" /&gt; Additionally, the authors of the poll found that technology use was connected to sleep patterns. 22% of participants reported going to sleep with cell phone ringers on in their bedroom and 10% reported awakenings in at least a few nights per week due to their cell phones' ringers.&lt;ref name="sleepfoundation" /&gt; Among those with the cell phone ringers on, being awakened by their cell phone was correlated to difficulty sustaining sleep.&lt;ref name="sleepfoundation" /&gt;

==== Caffeine ====
A study from the [[University of Kentucky]] depicted that more than 78% of college freshmen consume above the recommended amount of caffeine each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=McIlvain|first=Gary Eugene|title=Caffeine Consumption Patterns and Beliefs of College Freshmen|date=2008|publisher=University of Kentucky|url=https://uknowledge.uky.edu/gradschool_diss/638/|name-list-format=vanc}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one group of researchers' study from the Henry Ford Hospital's Sleep and Research Center and Wayne State College of Medicine, they discovered that caffeine consumed at least six hours before bedtime can significantly disrupt sleep.&lt;ref name="Drake_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Drake C, Roehrs T, Shambroom J, Roth T | title = Caffeine effects on sleep taken 0, 3, or 6 hours before going to bed | journal = Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine | volume = 9 | issue = 11 | pages = 1195–200 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24235903 | pmc = 3805807 | doi = 10.5664/jcsm.3170 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants in this study who consumed caffeine right before bedtime, three hours before bedtime, and six hours before bedtime all experienced a shorter night's sleep, lower sleep quality and spent more time awake at night.&lt;ref name="Drake_2013" /&gt;

== Effects  ==

=== Academic ===
There is evidence that sleep is correlated with [[Grading in education|GPA]]. GPA is associated with the students' overall academic performances in their classes. Students who had longer amounts of sleep had higher GPAs than students who had shorter amounts of sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285664611_The_relationship_between_sleep_length_and_grade-point_average_among_college_students| vauthors = Kelly W, Kelly KE, Clanton RC | title = The relationship between sleep length and grade-point average among college students | journal = College Student Journal | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 84–86  |date= January 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, researchers from the Sleep Health Institute and Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorder at the Departments of Medicine and Neurology in the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, created a study to discover how irregular sleep patterns are associated with poorer academic performances. The students who participated in this study kept online diaries of their sleep schedules for 30 days. The researchers divided the participants into two groups: regular sleepers, or those who went to bed and woke up around the same time every day and irregular sleepers, or those who have different sleep patterns every day. Using a scoring index from zero to 100 to calculate a student’s sleep schedule, students with irregular sleeping patterns were given lower scores closer to zero while the students with regular sleeping patterns had scores closer to 100. The researchers found that for every score increase of 10 on the scoring index, the student had an average increase of 0.10 of their GPA. The researchers concluded that college students who do not go to bed or wake up at consistent time are likely to have lower GPAs. The study suggests that irregular sleeping schedules do indeed affect student’s GPA and academic performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Phillips AJ, Clerx WM, O'Brien CS, Sano A, Barger LK, Picard RW, Lockley SW, Klerman EB, Czeisler CA | title = Irregular sleep/wake patterns are associated with poorer academic performance and delayed circadian and sleep/wake timing | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 3216 | date = June 2017 | pmid = 28607474 | doi = 10.1038/s41598-017-03171-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical ===
Student's physical shape seems to be affected by sleep deprivation as well. Researchers from the Imperial College School of Medicine conducted a randomized controlled study to investigate the effects of a night of sleep deprivation on the physical performance in students. The participants were randomized into two conditions, normal sleep or one night of sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation was monitored using an online-time stamped questionnaire at 45 minute intervals, done in the participant’s homes. The results show that reaction time and exercise performance were significantly affected by sleep deprivation. The researchers concluded that sleep deprivation can affect physical performance in university students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Patrick Y, Lee A, Raha O, Pillai K, Gupta S, Sethi S, Mukeshimana F, Gerard L, Moghal MU, Saleh SN, Smith SF, Morrell MJ, Moss J | title = Effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive and physical performance in university students | journal = Sleep and Biological Rhythms | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 217–225 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28680341 | pmc = 5489575 | doi = 10.1007/s41105-017-0099-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Interventions ==

=== Naps ===
Daytime naps offer a potential intervention for sleep deprivation in college students. Napping may improve certain memory tasks as students who were excelling in their academics were more likely to nap than those who had low academic success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eliasson AH, Lettieri CJ, Eliasson AH | title = Early to bed, early to rise! Sleep habits and academic performance in college students | journal = Sleep &amp; Breathing = Schlaf &amp; Atmung | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 71–5 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 19603214 | doi = 10.1007/s11325-009-0282-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sleep Courses ===
In one study, participants took a two-credit, 18-week course that included group discussions, lectures, and self-evaluation of topics that included circadian rhythms, sleep hygiene, muscle relaxation, and public sleep education. Participants reported that they had improved sleep quality and sleep hygiene throughout the course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsai LL, Li SP | title = Sleep education in college: a preliminary study | journal = Perceptual and Motor Skills | volume = 99 | issue = 3 Pt 1 | pages = 837–48 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15648478 | doi = 10.2466/pms.99.3.837-848 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cognitive Behavioral Therapy ===
In one study, a revised type of cognitive behavioral for treating insomnia was sent to participating students by email. The email contained an attachment addressing several aspects of sleep, such as techniques for relaxation and methods to stabilize the circadian rhythm. This method was compared to another program called Breathe which was created in order to reduce symptoms of depression and to cope with high stress. Participants in the Breathe program showed improvements in sleep quality and a decrease in depressive symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Trockel M, Manber R, Chang V, Thurston A, Taylor CB, Tailor CB | title = An e-mail delivered CBT for sleep-health program for college students: effects on sleep quality and depression symptoms | journal = Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 276–81 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21677898 | pmc = 3113967 | doi = 10.5664/JCSM.1072 }}&lt;/ref&gt;While this study only had a small number of participants, the final results showed hope as an effective method that can help with sleep deprivation for college students.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4882">An '''Exposure Action Value''' ('''EAV''') or '''Action Value''' ('''AV''') is a limit set on occupational exposure to noise where, when those values are exceeded, employers must take steps to monitor the exposure levels.  These levels are measured in [[decibels]].  The American [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) set the EAV to 85&amp;nbsp;dB(A).  When the eight-hour time-weighted average (TWA) reaches 85&amp;nbsp;dB(A), employers are required to administer a continuing, effective [[hearing conservation program]].  The program consists of monitoring, employee notification, observation, an audiometric testing program, hearing protectors, training programs, and record keeping requirements.

== Purpose ==
The purpose of the EAV is to ensure that employees are not suffering from high levels of noise exposure.  OSHA requires employers to take steps to reduce exposure levels when the TWA reaches 90 dB(A).  The EAV is to ensure that the exposure levels do not reach 90 dB(A) or more.  It is also to ensure that employees are not experiencing [[noise-induced hearing loss]].

== Use ==
A [[noise dosimeter]] is used to measure noise exposures to employees.  Dosimeters can be used to determine the TWA.  If it is determined that levels of noise exposure have reached the EAV, employers are required to implement a hearing conservation program.  The hearing conservation program consists of many different aspects.

The first aspect is monitoring.  The employer is required to monitor noise exposure for all of its employees who may be exposed at a TWA at or above 85 dB(A).  This is to identify employees for inclusion in the hearing conservation program and to enable the proper selection of hearing protectors.

The second aspect is the audiometric testing program.  Employees exposed to levels at or above the EAV will undergo audiometric testing.  The first test is called a baseline.  It provides a standard to compare future audiometric tests to.  If a significant change in hearing capabilities occurs (called a standard threshold shift) greater steps must be taken to ensure the employee is protected from high levels of noise exposure.

The third aspect is the implementation of hearing protection.  Employers must make hearing protection available to all employees who are exposed to noise levels of 85 dB(A) or greater.  This is to be at no cost to employees.  Employees can pick whichever type of hearing protection they prefer.  This also requires an ongoing evaluation of the hearing protection.

The fourth aspect is a training program.  The training program must cover the effects of noise on hearing, the purpose of hearing protection, and the purpose of audiometric testing.

The last aspect is record keeping.  Records of employee audiometric tests must be retained for two years.  This information must also be available to the employees.

Just like the Exposure Action Value or Action Value for noise, safety administrations across the world are publishing values for vibrations.  As of right now, The American Occupational Safety and Health Administration has not officially published a list of appropriate, time-weighted EAV guidelines for employers to follow.  However, companies in the United States are encouraged by the [[NIOSH|National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] to follow the vibration limits set up by the [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists|ACGIH]], which publishes a ''Threshold Limit Value'' or ''TLV'' in their annual book of TLVs and BEIs.  The goal is for employers to have these numbers in order to make a conscious effort to lower the amount of harmful exposure absorbed by their workers.  Since the link from physical vibration to damage caused by [[Raynaud's phenomenon]] is less clearly defined between the EAV for noise and noise-induced hearing loss, an upper extreme limit ''Exposure Limit Value'' or ''ELV'' is provided as well to give a margin.

[[Image:William Hogarth - Gin Lane.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Gin Lane]] by [[William Hogarth]], 1751]]
The '''Gin Craze''' was a period in the first half of the 18th century when the consumption of [[gin]] increased rapidly in [[Great Britain]], especially in [[London]]. [[Daniel Defoe]] commented: "the Distillers have found out a way to hit the palate of the Poor, by their new fashion'd compound Waters called Geneva, so that the common People seem not to value the French-brandy as usual, and even not to desire it".&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=Iqs_AAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22good%20old%20days%22%20defoe&amp;pg=RA1-PA91#v=onepage&amp;q=compound%20waters&amp;f=false The Complete English Tradesman, Vol 2, Page 91 Daniel Defoe, 1727&lt;/ref&gt; Many people overconsumed and the city had an epidemic of extreme [[drunkenness]]; this provoked [[Moral panic|moral outrage]] and a legislative backlash that some compare to the modern [[Prohibition (drugs)|drug war]]s.

Parliament passed five major Acts, in 1729, 1736, 1743, 1747 and 1751, designed to control the consumption of gin. Though many similar drinks were available and alcohol consumption was considerable at all levels of society, gin caused the greatest public concern. Although it is commonly thought gin or Jenever was the singular drink, "gin" was a blanket statement for all grain-based alcohols at the time.

==Increased consumption of gin==

Gin was popularised in England following the accession of [[William III of England|William of Orange]] in 1688. Gin provided an alternative to French [[brandy]] at a time of both political and religious conflict between Britain and France. Between 1689 and 1697, the Government passed a range of legislation aimed at restricting brandy imports and encouraging gin production. Most importantly, the monopoly of the London Guild of Distillers was broken in 1690, thereby opening up the market in gin distillation.  The production and consumption of English gin, which was then popular amongst politicians and even [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], was encouraged by the government. This encouragement was shown in the reduced taxes on the distillation of spirits. Additionally, no licenses were needed to make spirits, so distillers of spirits could have smaller, more simple workshops than brewers, who needed to serve food and provide shelter for patrons.&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phillips|first1=Roderick|title=Alcohol A History|date=2014|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Economic protectionism was a major factor in beginning the Gin Craze; as the price of food dropped and income grew, consumers suddenly had the opportunity to spend excess funds on spirits. By 1721, however, [[Middlesex]] [[magistrate]]s were already decrying gin as "the principal cause of all the vice &amp; debauchery committed among the inferior sort of people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4727944/A-tonic-for-the-nation.html|title=A tonic for the nation|date=2002-06-09|accessdate=2010-08-30|author=Kate Chisholm|newspaper=Telegraph}} In a review of ''The Much-Lamented Death of Madam Geneva'' by Patrick Dillon.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1736, the Middlesex Magistrates complained: &lt;blockquote&gt;It is with the deepest concern your committee observe the strong Inclination of the inferior Sort of People to these destructive Liquors, and how surprisingly this Infection has spread within these few Years … it is scarce possible for Persons in low Life to go anywhere or to be anywhere, without being drawn in to taste, and, by Degrees, to like and approve of this pernicious Liquor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7rYRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA326&amp;lpg=PA326#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Pamphleteer, Volume 29  By Abraham John Valpy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Gin Acts of 1736 and 1751==
{{Main|Gin Act 1751}}
The British government tried a number of times to stop the flow of gin.  The [[Gin Act 1736]] taxed retail sales at a rate of 20 shillings a gallon on spirits and required licensees to take out a £50 annual licence to sell gin, a fee equivalent to about £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|50|1736|r=-3}}}} today.  The aim was to effectively prohibit the trade by making it economically unfeasible.  Only two licences were ever taken out.  The trade became illegal, consumption dipped but then continued to rise and the law was effectively repealed in 1743 following mass law-breaking and violence (particularly towards informers who were paid £5 to reveal the whereabouts of illegal gin shops).  The illegally distilled gin which was produced following the 1736 Act was less reliable and more likely to result in poisoning.

By 1743, England was drinking 2.2 [[Imperial (UK) gallon#Measures of volume|gallons]] (10 litres) of gin per person per year.  As consumption levels increased, an organised campaign for more effective legislation began to emerge, led by the [[Bishop of Sodor and Man]], Thomas Wilson, who, in 1736, had complained that gin produced a "drunken ungovernable set of people".  Prominent anti-gin campaigners included [[Henry Fielding]] (whose 1751 "Enquiry into the Late Increase in Robbers" blamed gin consumption for both increased crime and increased ill health among children), [[Josiah Tucker]], [[Daniel Defoe]] (who had originally campaigned for the liberalisation of distilling, but later complained that drunken mothers were threatening to produce a "fine spindle-shanked generation" of children), and – briefly – [[William Hogarth]]. Hogarth's engraving ''[[Gin Lane]]'' is a well known image of the gin craze, and is often paired with "[[Beer Street]]", creating a contrast between the miserable lives of gin drinkers and the healthy and enjoyable lives of beer drinkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gately|first1=Iain|title=Drink: A Cultural History of Alcohol|date=2008|publisher=Gotham|location=New York|isbn=978-1-592-40464-3|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gin Craze began to diminish after the [[Gin Act 1751]].  This Act lowered the annual licence fees, but encouraged "respectable" gin selling by requiring licensees to trade from premises rented for at least £10 a year.  Historians suggest that gin consumption was reduced not as a result of legislation but because of the rising cost of grain.  Landowners could afford to abandon the production of gin, and this fact, coupled with population growth and a series of poor harvests, resulted in lower wages and increased food prices.  The Gin Craze had mostly ended by 1757.  The government tried to ensure this by temporarily banning the manufacture of spirits from domestic grain. There was a resurgence of gin consumption during the [[Victorian era]], with numerous "[[Gin palace|Gin Palaces]]" appearing. In 1840, the amount of gin consumed in London (but by that time with a population in excess of one million) finally matched that from when prohibition ended in 1743.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dillon|first1=Patrick|title=Gin: The Much-Lamented Death of Madam Geneva: The Eighteenth-Century Gin Craze|date=2002|publisher=Review|location=London|isbn=1-932112-25-1|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Glucose''' (also called '''dextrose''') is a simple [[sugar]] with the [[Chemical formula#Molecular formula|molecular formula]] {{Chemical formula|C|6|H|12|O|6}}.

(Raisins, being moistened with a small quantity of water, in a way that they soften, can be then pressed, and the juice that is squeezed out, [after] being purified and thickened, will provide a sort of sugar.)&lt;/ref&gt; Glucose was discovered in grapes by [[Johann Tobias Lowitz]] in 1792 and recognized as different from cane sugar (sucrose). Glucose is the term coined by [[Jean Baptiste Dumas]] in 1838, which has prevailed in the chemical literature. [[Friedrich August Kekulé]] proposed the term dextrose (from Latin dexter = right), because in aqueous solution of glucose, the plane of linearly polarized light is turned to the right. In contrast, D-fructose (a ketohexose) and L-glucose turn linearly polarized light to the left.

Since glucose is a basic necessity of many organisms, a correct understanding of its chemical makeup and structure contributed greatly to a general advancement in [[organic chemistry]]. This understanding occurred largely as a result of the investigations of [[Hermann Emil Fischer|Emil Fischer]], a German chemist who received the 1902 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Emil Fischer | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1902/fischer-bio.html | publisher = Nobel Foundation | accessdate = 2009-09-02 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090903164859/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1902/fischer-bio.html | archivedate = 2009-09-03 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The synthesis of glucose established the structure of organic material and consequently formed the first definitive validation of [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff]]'s theories of chemical kinetics and the arrangements of chemical bonds in carbon-bearing molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = van't Hoff's Glucose | first = Bert | last = Fraser-Reid | journal = Chem.

The names initially referred to the natural substances. Their enantiomers were given the same name with the introduction of systematic nomenclatures, taking into account absolute stereochemistry (e.g. Fischer nomenclature, D/L nomenclature).

== Chemical properties ==
With six carbon atoms, it is classed as a [[hexose]], a subcategory of the monosaccharides. &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-Glucose is one of the sixteen [[aldohexose]] [[stereoisomer]]s. The &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-[[isomer]], &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glucose, also known as dextrose, occurs widely in nature, but the &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-isomer, [[L-glucose|&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-glucose]], does not. Glucose can be obtained by [[hydrolysis]] of carbohydrates such as milk sugar ([[lactose]]), cane sugar ([[sucrose]]), [[maltose]], [[cellulose]], [[glycogen]], etc. It is commonly commercially manufactured from cornstarch by hydrolysis via pressurized steaming at controlled [[pH]] in a jet followed by further enzymatic depolymerization.&lt;ref&gt;"glucose." The Columbia Encyclopedia, 6th ed.. 2015.

All forms of glucose are colorless and easily soluble in water, [[acetic acid]], and several other solvents.  They are only sparingly soluble in [[methanol]] and [[ethanol]].

===Structure and nomenclature===
Glucose is a monosaccharide with formula C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; or H-(C=O)-(CHOH)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-H, whose five [[hydroxyl]] (OH) groups are arranged in a specific way along its six-[[carbon]] back. Glucose is usually present in solid form as a [[monohydrate]] with a closed [[pyran]] ring (dextrose hydrate). In aqueous solution, on the other hand, it is has an open-chain to a small extent and is present predominantly as α- or β-[[pyranose]], which partially mutually merge by [[mutarotation]]. From aqueous solutions, the three known forms can be crystallized: α-glucopyranose, β-glucopyranose and β-glucopyranose hydrate.&lt;ref name="Ullmann"&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1002/14356007.a12_457.pub2|chapter=Glucose and Glucose-Containing Syrups|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2006|last1=Schenck|first1=Fred W.|isbn=978-3527306732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glucose is a building block of the disaccharides [[lactose]] and [[sucrose]] (cane or beet sugar), of [[oligosaccharide]]s such as [[raffinose]] and of polysaccharides such as [[starch]] and [[amylopectin]], [[glycogen]] or [[cellulose]].

===Open-chain form===
[[Image:Glucose Fisher to Haworth.gif|thumb|Glucose can exist in both a straight-chain and ring form.]]
In its fleeting [[open-chain]] form, the glucose molecule has an open (as opposed to [[cyclic compound|cyclic]]) and unbranched backbone of six carbon atoms, C-1 through C-6; where C-1 is part of an [[aldehyde group]] H(C=O)-, and each of the other five carbons bears one hydroxyl group -OH.  The remaining  [[covalent bond|bonds]] of the backbone carbons are satisfied by [[hydrogen]] atoms -H. Therefore, glucose is both a [[hexose]] and an [[aldose]], or an [[aldohexose]]. The aldehyde group makes glucose a [[reducing sugar]] giving a positive reaction with the [[Fehling test]].

Each of the four carbons C-2 through C-5 is a [[stereocenter]], meaning that its four bonds connect to four different substituents.  (Carbon C-2, for example, connects to -(C=O)H, -OH, -H, and -(CHOH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H.)  In &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glucose, these four parts must be in a specific three-dimensional arrangement. Namely, when the molecule is drawn in the [[Fischer projection]], the hydroxyls on C-2, C-4, and C-5 must be on the right side, while that on C-3 must be on the left side.

The positions of those four hydroxyls are exactly reversed in the Fischer diagram of [[L-Glucose|&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-glucose]].  &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;- and &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-glucose are two of the 16 possible aldohexoses; the other 14 are [[allose]], [[altrose]], [[galactose]], [[gulose]], [[idose]], [[mannose]], and [[talose]], each with two [[enantiomer]]s, “&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-” and “&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-”.

It is important to note that the linear form of glucose makes up less than 0.02% of the glucose molecules in a water solution. The rest is one of two cyclic forms of glucose that are formed when the hydroxyl group on carbon 5 (C5) bonds to the aldehyde carbon 1 (C1).

}}
In solutions, the open-chain form of glucose (either "{{small|D}}-" or "{{small|L}}-") exists in equilibrium with several [[Carbohydrate#Ring-straight chain isomerism|cyclic isomers]], each containing a ring of carbons closed by one oxygen atom. In aqueous solution however, more than 99% of glucose molecules, at any given time, exist as [[pyranose]] forms. The open-chain form is limited to about 0.25% and [[furanose]] forms exists in negligible amounts. The terms "glucose" and "{{small|D}}-glucose" are generally used for these cyclic forms as well. The ring arises from the open-chain form by an intramolecular [[nucleophilic addition]] reaction between the aldehyde group (at C-1) and either the C-4 or C-5 hydroxyl group, forming a [[hemiacetal]] linkage, -C(OH)H-O-.

The reaction between C-1 and C-5 yields a six-membered [[heterocycle|heterocyclic]] system called a pyranose, which is a monosaccharide sugar (hence "–ose") containing a derivatised [[pyran]] skeleton. The (much rarer) reaction between C-1 and C-4 yields a five-membered furanose ring, named after the cyclic ether [[furan]].  In either case, each carbon in the ring has one hydrogen and one hydroxyl attached, except for the last carbon (C-4 or C-5) where the hydroxyl is replaced by the remainder of the open molecule (which is -(C(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH)HOH)-H or -(CHOH)-H, respectively).

The ring-closing reaction makes carbon C-1 [[Chirality|chiral]], too, since its four bonds lead to -H, to -OH, to carbon C-2, and to the ring oxygen.  These four parts of the molecule may be arranged around C-1 (the [[anomeric carbon]]) in two distinct ways, designated by the prefixes "α-" and "β-".  When a glucopyranose molecule is drawn in the [[Haworth projection]], the designation "α-" means that the hydroxyl group attached to C-1 and the -CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH group at C-5 lies on opposite sides of the ring's plane (a [[cis-trans isomerism|''trans'']] arrangement), while "β-" means that they are on the same side of the plane (a [[cis-trans isomerism|''cis'']] arrangement). Therefore, the open-chain isomer {{small|D}}-glucose gives rise to four distinct cyclic isomers: α-{{small|D}}-glucopyranose, β-{{small|D}}-glucopyranose, α-{{small|D}}-glucofuranose, and β-{{small|D}}-glucofuranose. These five structures exist in equilibrium and interconvert, and the interconversion is much more rapid with acid [[catalysis]].

| footer = &lt;br /&gt;[[Chair conformation]]s of α- (left) and β- (right) {{small|D}}-glucopyranose
}}
The other open-chain isomer {{small|L}}-glucose similarly gives rise to four distinct cyclic forms of {{small|L}}-glucose, each the mirror image of the corresponding {{small|D}}-glucose.

The rings are not planar, but are twisted in three dimensions. The glucopyranose ring (α or β) can assume several non-planar shapes, analogous to the "chair" and "boat" conformations of [[cyclohexane]].  Similarly, the glucofuranose ring may assume several shapes, analogous to the "envelope" conformations of [[cyclopentane]].

In the solid state, only the glucopyranose forms are observed, forming colorless crystalline solids that are highly [[Solubility|soluble]] in water and [[acetic acid]] but poorly soluble in [[methanol]] and [[ethanol]].  They melt at {{convert|146|C|F}} (''α'') and {{convert|150|C|F}} (''β''), and [[Decomposition|decompose]] at higher temperatures into [[carbon]] and water.

===Rotational isomers===
Each glucose [[isomer]] is subject to [[rotamer|rotational isomerism]]. Within the cyclic form of glucose, rotation may occur around the O6-C6-C5-O5 [[torsion angle]], termed the ''ω''-angle, to form three staggered rotamer conformations called ''gauche''-''gauche'' (gg), ''gauche''-''trans'' (gt) and ''trans''-''gauche'' (tg).&lt;ref&gt;For methyl α-D-glucuopyranose at equilibrium, the ratio of molecules in each rotamer conformation is reported to be  57% gg, 38% gt, and 5% tg. See {{citation | last1 = Kirschner | first1 = Karl N. | last2 = Woods | first2 = Robert J. | title = Solvent interactions determine carbohydrate conformation | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA | year = 2001 | volume = 98 | issue = 19 | pages = 10541–45 | pmid = 11526221 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.191362798 | pmc = 58501 | bibcode = 2001PNAS...9810541K }}.{{Primary source inline|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a tendency for the ''ω''-angle to adopt a ''gauche'' conformation, a tendency that is attributed to the [[gauche effect]].

===Mutarotation===
[[File:Mutarotation D-Glucose V.1.png|thumb|upright=2|Mutarotation: D-glucose molecules exist as cyclic hemiacetals that are epimeric (= diastereomeric) to each other. The epimeric ratio α:β is 36:64. In the α-D-glucopyranose (left), the blue-labeled hydroxy group is in the axial position at the anomeric center, whereas in the β-D-glucopyranose (right) the blue-labeled hydroxy group is in equatorial position at the anomeric center.]]
Mutarotation consists of a temporary reversal of the ring-forming reaction, resulting in the open-chain form, followed by a reforming of the ring. The ring closure step may use a different -OH group than the one recreated by the opening step (thus switching between pyranose and furanose forms), or the new hemiacetal group created on C-1 may have the same or opposite handedness as the original one (thus switching between the α and β forms). Thus, though the open-chain form is barely detectable in solution, it is an essential component of the equilibrium.

The open-chain form is [[Chemical stability|thermodynamically unstable]], and it spontaneously [[isomer]]izes to the cyclic forms.  (Although the ring closure reaction could in theory create four- or three-atom rings, these would be highly strained, and are not observed in practice.)  In solutions at [[room temperature]], the four cyclic isomers interconvert over a time scale of hours, in a process called [[mutarotation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{McMurry2nd | page = 866}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting from any proportions, the mixture converges to a stable ratio of α:β 36:64.&lt;!--AT ANY TEMPERATURE?--&gt; The ratio would be α:β 11:89 if it were not for the influence of the [[anomeric effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = The Anomeric Effect | last1 = Juaristi | first1 = Eusebio | first2 = Gabriel | last2 = Cuevas | year = 1995 | publisher = CRC Press | pages = 9–10 | isbn = 978-0-8493-8941-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mutarotation is considerably slower at temperatures close to {{convert|0|C}}.

===Optical activity===
Whether in water or in the solid form, &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-(+)-glucose is [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|dextrorotatory]], meaning it will rotate the direction of [[polarized light]] clockwise as seen looking toward the light source.  The effect is due to the [[chirality]] of the molecules, and indeed the mirror-image isomer, &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-(−)-glucose, is [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|levorotatory]] (rotates polarized light counterclockwise) by the same amount. The strength of the effect is different for each of the five [[tautomer]]s.

Note that the &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;- prefix does not refer directly to the optical properties of the compound. It indicates that the C-5 chiral center has the same handedness as that of &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glyceraldehyde (which was so labeled because it is dextrorotatory).  The fact that &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glucose is dextrorotatory is a combined effect of its four chiral centers, not just of C-5; and indeed some of the other &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-aldohexoses are levorotatory.&lt;!--CHECK--&gt;

The conversion between the two anomers can be observed in a [[polarimeter]], since pure α- D- glucose has a specific rotation angle of +112.2 ° · ml · dm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; · g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, pure β- D- glucose of +17.5 ° · ml · dm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; · g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Hesse"&gt;Manfred Hesse, Herbert Meier, Bernd Zeeh, Stefan Bienz, Laurent Bigler, Thomas Fox: ''Spektroskopische Methoden in der organischen Chemie''. 8th revised Edition.

(german)&lt;/ref&gt; When equilibrium has been reached after a certain time due to mutarotation, the angle of rotation is +52.7 ° · ml · dm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; · g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Hesse" /&gt; By adding acid or base, this transformation is much accelerated. The equilibration takes place via the open-chain aldehyde form.

===Isomerisation===
In dilute [[sodium hydroxide]] or other dilute bases, the monosaccharides [[mannose]], glucose and [[fructose]] interconvert (via a [[Lobry de Bruyn–van Ekenstein transformation|Lobry de Bruyn–Alberda–van Ekenstein transformation]]), so that a balance between these isomers is formed. This reaction proceeds via an [[enediol]]:

Glucose is the most abundant monosaccharide. Glucose is also the most widely used [[aldohexose]] in most living organisms. One possible explanation for this is that glucose has a lower tendency than other aldohexoses to react nonspecifically with the [[amine]] groups of [[protein]]s.&lt;ref name=Higgins&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bunn|first1=H. F.|last2=Higgins|first2=P.

Glucose's low rate of glycation can be attributed to its having a more stable [[Glucose#Cyclic forms|cyclic form]] compared to other aldohexoses, which means it spends less time than they do in its reactive [[Glucose#Open-chain form|open-chain form]].&lt;ref name=Higgins/&gt; The reason for glucose having the most stable cyclic form of all the aldohexoses is that its [[Hydroxy group#Hydroxy group|hydroxy groups]] (with the exception of the hydroxy group on the anomeric carbon of &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glucose) are in the [[Cyclohexane conformation|equatorial position]]. Presumably, glucose is the most abundant natural monosaccharide because it is less glycated with proteins than other monosaccharides.&lt;ref name=Higgins /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stryer 531"&gt;Jeremy M. Berg: ''Stryer Biochemie.'' Springer-Verlag, 2017, {{ISBN|978-3-662-54620-8}}, p.&amp;nbsp;531. (german)&lt;/ref&gt; Another hypothesis is that glucose, being the only [[Aldohexose|D-aldohexose]] that has all five [[Hydroxy group|hydroxy]] substituents in the [[Equatorial bond|equatorial]] position in the form of β-D-glucose, is more readily accessible to chemical reactions,&lt;ref name="Garrett"&gt;Reginald H.

Lehninger, ''Biochemistry, 6th printing'', Worth Publishers Inc. 1972, {{ISBN|0-87901-009-6}} p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, D-glucose is also a highly preferred building block in natural [[polysaccharides]] (glycans). Polysaccharides that are composed solely of Glucose are termed [[glucan]]s.

Glucose is produced by plants through the photosynthesis using sunlight, water and carbon dioxide and can be used by all living organisms as an energy and carbon source. However, most glucose does not occur in its free form, but in the form of its polymers, i.e. lactose, sucrose, starch and others which are energy reserve substances, and cellulose and [[chitin]], which are components of the cell wall in plants or [[fungi]] and [[arthropod]]s, respectively. These polymers are degraded to glucose during food intake by animals, fungi and bacteria using enzymes.  All animals are also able to produce glucose themselves from certain precursors as the need arises. [[Nerve cells]], cells of the [[renal medulla]] and [[erythrocytes]] depend on glucose for their energy production.&lt;ref name="Löffler/Petrides 195"&gt;Peter C.

===Uptake===
Ingested glucose initially binds to the receptor for sweet taste on the tongue in humans. This complex of the proteins [[T1R2]] and [[T1R3]] makes it possible to identify glucose-containing food sources. Glucose mainly comes from food - about 300 g per day are produced by conversion of food,&lt;ref name="Löffler/Petrides 404"&gt;Peter C. Heinrich: ''Löffler/Petrides Biochemie und Pathobiochemie.'' Springer-Verlag, 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-642-17972-3}}, p.&amp;nbsp;404.&lt;/ref&gt; but it is also synthesized from other metabolites in the body's cells. In humans, the breakdown of glucose-containing polysaccharides happens in part already during [[mastication|chewing]] by means of [[amylase]], which is contained in [[saliva]], as well as by [[maltase]], [[lactase]] and [[sucrase]] on the [[brush border]] of the small intestine. Glucose is a building block of many carbohydrates and can be split off from them using certain enzymes. [[Glucosidases]], a subgroup of the glycosidases, first catalyze the hydrolysis of long-chain glucose-containing polysaccharides, removing terminal glucose. In turn, disaccharides are mostly degraded by specific glycosidases to glucose. The names of the degrading enzymes are often derived from the particular poly- and disaccharide; inter alia, for the degradation of polysaccharide chains there are amylases (named after amylose, a component of starch), cellulases (named after cellulose), chitinases (named after chitin) and more. Furthermore, for the cleavage of disaccharides, there are maltase, lactase, sucrase, [[trehalase]] and others. In humans, about 70 genes are known that code for glycosidases. They have functions in the digestion and degradation of glycogen, [[sphingolipids]], [[mucopolysaccharides]] and [[poly(ADP-ribose)]]. Humans do not produce cellulases, chitinases and trehalases, but the bacteria in the [[gut flora]] do.

In order to get into or out of cell membranes of cells and membranes of cell compartments, glucose requires special transport proteins from the [[major facilitator superfamily]]. In the [[small intestine]] (more precisely, in the [[jejunum]]),&lt;ref name="Harper 641"&gt;Harold A. Harper: ''Medizinische Biochemie.''

With the help of [[glucose-6-phosphatase]], glucose-6-phosphate is converted back into glucose exclusively in the liver, if necessary, so that it is available for maintaining a sufficient blood glucose concentration. In other cells, uptake happens by passive transport through one of the 14 GLUT proteins.&lt;ref name="Löffler/Petrides 199" /&gt; In the other cell types, phosphorylation occurs through a [[hexokinase]], whereupon glucose can no longer diffuse out of the cell.

===Biosynthesis===
{{main|Gluconeogenesis|Glycogenolysis}}
In [[plant]]s and some [[prokaryote]]s, glucose is a product of [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/Education/Teachers/Resources/cfb/Photosynthesis.htm|title=Chemistry for Biologists: Photosynthesis|website=www.rsc.org|access-date=2018-02-05|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804060610/http://www.rsc.org/Education/Teachers/Resources/cfb/Photosynthesis.htm|archivedate=2016-08-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glucose is also formed by the breakdown of polymeric forms of glucose like [[glycogen]] (in animals and [[mushroom]]s) or [[starch]] (in plants). The cleavage of glycogen is termed [[glycogenolysis]], the cleavage of starch is called starch degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Smith, Alison M. |last2=Zeeman, Samuel C. |last3= Smith, Steven M. |year= 2005 |title= Starch Degradation |journal= Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. |volume= 56 |pages= 73–98 |doi= 10.1146/annurev.arplant.56.032604.144257 |pmid=15862090 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The metabolic pathway that begins with molecules containing two to four carbon atoms (C) and ends in the glucose molecule containing six carbon atoms is called gluconeogenesis and occurs in all living organisms. The smaller starting materials are the result of other metabolic pathways. Ultimately almost all [[biomolecule]]s come from the assimilation of carbon dioxide in plants during photosynthesis.&lt;ref name="Voet 359"&gt;Donald Voet, Judith G. Voet: ''Biochemistry, 4th Edition.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0470-57095-1}}. p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt; The free energy of formation of α-D-glucose is 917.2 kilojoules per mole.&lt;ref name="Voet 59"&gt;Donald Voet, Judith G. Voet: ''Biochemistry, 4th Edition.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0470-57095-1}}. p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, gluconeogenesis occurs in the liver and kidney,&lt;ref name="Szablewski"&gt;Leszek Szablewski: ''Glucose Homeostasis and Insulin Resistance.'' Bentham Science Publishers, 2011, {{ISBN|978-1-608-05189-2}}, p.&amp;nbsp;46.&lt;/ref&gt; but also in other cell types. In the liver about 150 g of glycogen are stored, in skeletal muscle about 250 g.&lt;ref name="Löffler/Petrides 389"&gt;Peter C. Heinrich: ''Löffler/Petrides Biochemie und Pathobiochemie.'' Springer-Verlag, 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-642-17972-3}}, p.&amp;nbsp;389. (german)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the glucose released in muscle cells upon cleavage of the glycogen can not be delivered to the circulation because glucose is phosphorylated by the hexokinae, and a glucose-6-phosphatase is not expressed to remove the phosphate group. Unlike for glucose, there is no transport protein for glucose-6-phosphate. Gluconeogenesis allows the organism to build up glucose from other metabolites, including [[lactic acid|lactate]] or certain amino acids, while consuming energy. The renal [[tubular cell]]s can also produce glucose.

If there is not enough oxygen available for this, the glucose degradation in animals occurs anaerobic to lactate via lactic acid fermentation and releases less energy. Muscular lactate enters the liver through the bloodstream in mammals, where gluconeogenesis occurs ([[Cori cycle]]). With a high supply of glucose, the metabolite [[acetyl-CoA]] from the Krebs cycle can also be used for [[fatty acid synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00125-016-3940-5|pmid=27048250|year=2016|last1=Jones|first1=J.

These processes are [[Hormone|hormonally]] regulated.

In other living organisms, other forms of fermentation can occur. The bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' can grow on nutrient media containing glucose as the sole carbon source.&lt;ref name="Voet 59" /&gt; In some bacteria and, in modified form, also in archaea, glucose is degraded via the [[Entner-Doudoroff pathway]].&lt;ref&gt;Entner, N. und Doudoroff, M.

Use of glucose as an energy source in cells is by either aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration, or fermentation. The first step of glycolysis is the [[phosphorylation]] of glucose by a [[hexokinase]] to form [[glucose 6-phosphate]]. The main reason for the immediate phosphorylation of glucose is to prevent its diffusion out of the cell as the charged [[phosphate]] group prevents glucose 6-phosphate from easily crossing the [[cell membrane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bonadonna|first1=Riccardo C|last2=Bonora|first2=Enzo|last3=Del Prato|first3=Stefano|last4=Saccomani|first4=Maria|last5=Cobelli|first5=Claudio|last6=Natali|first6=Andrea|last7=Frascerra|first7=Silvia|last8=Pecori|first8=Neda|last9=Ferrannini|first9=Eleuterio|last10=Bier|first10=Dennis|last11=DeFronzo|first11=Ralph A|last12=Gulli|first12=Giovanni|title=Roles of glucose transport and glucose phosphorylation in muscle insulin resistance of NIDDM|journal=Diabetes|date=July 1996|volume=45|issue=7|pages=915–25|doi=10.2337/diab.45.7.915|pmid=8666143|url=http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/45/7/915.full-text.pdf|accessdate=March 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, addition of the high-energy phosphate group [[Activation#Biochemistry|activates]] glucose for subsequent breakdown in later steps of glycolysis. At [[physiological condition]]s, this initial reaction is irreversible.

In anaerobic respiration, one glucose molecule produces a net gain of two ATP molecules (four ATP molecules are produced during glycolysis through substrate-level phosphorylation, but two are required by enzymes used during the process).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Medical Biochemistry at a Glance @Google books | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9BtxCWxrWRoC&amp;pg=PA52 | year = 2006 | page = 52 | publisher = Blackwell Publishing | isbn = 978-1-4051-1322-9 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180223145046/https://books.google.com/books?id=9BtxCWxrWRoC&amp;pg=PA52 | archivedate = 2018-02-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In aerobic respiration, a molecule of glucose is much more profitable in that a maximum net production of 30 or 32 ATP molecules (depending on the organism) through oxidative phosphorylation is generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Medical Biochemistry at a Glance  @Google books | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9BtxCWxrWRoC&amp;pg=PA50 | year = 2006 | publisher = Blackwell Publishing | page = 50 | isbn = 978-1-4051-1322-9 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180223145046/https://books.google.com/books?id=9BtxCWxrWRoC&amp;pg=PA50 | archivedate = 2018-02-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[yeast]], ethanol is fermented at high glucose concentrations, even in the presence of oxygen (which normally leads to respiration but not to fermentation). This effect is called the [[Crabtree effect]].

Some glucose is converted to [[lactic acid]] by [[astrocyte]]s, which is then utilized as an energy source by [[brain cells]]; some glucose is used by intestinal cells and [[erythrocytes|red blood cells]], while the rest reaches the [[liver]], [[adipose tissue]] and [[muscle]] cells, where it is absorbed and stored as glycogen (under the influence of [[insulin]]). Liver cell glycogen can be converted to glucose and returned to the blood when insulin is low or absent; muscle cell glycogen is not returned to the blood because of a lack of enzymes. In [[Adipocyte|fat cells]], glucose is used to power reactions that synthesize some [[fat]] types and have other purposes. Glycogen is the body's "glucose energy storage" mechanism, because it is much more "space efficient" and less reactive than glucose itself.

The [[glycemic load]] is an indicator for the amount of glucose added to blood glucose levels after consumption, based on the glycemic index and the amount of consumed food.

===Precursor===
Organisms use glucose as a precursor for the synthesis of several important substances. [[Starch]], [[cellulose]], and [[glycogen]] ("animal starch") are common glucose [[polymer]]s ([[polysaccharide]]s). Some of these polymers (starch or glycogen) serve as energy stores, while others (cellulose and [[chitin]], which is made from a derivative of glucose) have structural roles. [[Oligosaccharide]]s of glucose combined with other sugars serve as important energy stores. These include [[lactose]], the predominant sugar in milk, which is a glucose-galactose disaccharide, and [[sucrose]], another disaccharide which is composed of glucose and [[fructose]]. Glucose is also added onto certain proteins and [[lipid]]s in a process called [[glycosylation]]. This is often critical for their functioning. The enzymes that join glucose to other molecules usually use [[phosphorylation|phosphorylated]] glucose to power the formation of the new bond by coupling it with the breaking of the glucose-phosphate bond.

Other than its direct use as a monomer, glucose can be broken down to synthesize a wide variety of other biomolecules. This is important, as glucose serves both as a primary store of energy and as a source of organic carbon. Glucose can be broken down and converted into [[lipids]]. It is also a precursor for the synthesis of other important molecules such as vitamin C ([[ascorbic acid]]). In living organisms, glucose is converted to several other chemical compounds that are the starting material for various [[metabolic pathway]]s. Among them, all other monosaccharides&lt;ref name="Löffler/Petrides 27"&gt;Peter C. Heinrich: ''Löffler/Petrides Biochemie und Pathobiochemie.'' Springer-Verlag, 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-642-17972-3}}, p.&amp;nbsp;27. (german)&lt;/ref&gt; such as fructose (via the [[polyol pathway]]),&lt;ref name="Löffler/Petrides 199"&gt;Peter C. Heinrich: ''Löffler/Petrides Biochemie und Pathobiochemie.'' Springer-Verlag, 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-642-17972-3}}, p.&amp;nbsp;199, 200. (german)&lt;/ref&gt; mannose (the epimer of glucose at position 2), galactose (the epimer at position 4), fucose, various [[uronic acids]] and the [[amino sugar]]s are produced from glucose.&lt;ref name="Löffler/Petrides 214"&gt;Peter C. Heinrich: ''Löffler/Petrides Biochemie und Pathobiochemie.'' Springer-Verlag, 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-642-17972-3}}, p.&amp;nbsp;214. (german)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the phosphorylation to glucose-6-phosphate, which is part of the glycolysis, glucose can be oxidized during its degradation to [[glucono-1,5-lactone]]. Glucose is used in some bacteria as a building block in the [[trehalose]] or the [[dextran]] biosynthesis and in animals as a building block of glycogen. Glucose can also be converted from bacterial [[xylose isomerase]] to fructose. In addition, glucose [[metabolite]]s produce all nonessential [[amino acid]]s, [[sugar alcohol]]s such as [[mannitol]] and [[sorbitol]], [[fatty acid]]s, [[cholesterol]] and [[nucleic acid]]s.&lt;ref name="Löffler/Petrides 27" /&gt; Finally, glucose is used as a building block in the [[glycosylation]] of proteins to [[glycoprotein]]s, [[glycolipid]]s, [[peptidoglycan]]s, [[glycoside]]s and other substances (catalyzed by [[glycosyltransferase]]s) and can be cleaved from them by [[glycosidase]]s.

==Pathology==
===Diabetes===
[[Diabetes mellitus|Diabetes]] is a metabolic disorder where the body is unable to regulate [[Blood sugar|levels of glucose in the blood]] either because of a lack of insulin in the body or the failure, by cells in the body, to respond properly to insulin. Each of these situations can be caused by persistently high elevations of blood glucose levels, through pancreatic burnout and [[insulin resistance]]. The [[pancreas]] is the organ responsible for the secretion of the hormones insulin and glucagon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Röder PV, Wu B, Liu Y, Han W | title = Pancreatic Regulation of Glucose Homeostasis | journal = Exp. Mol. Med. | volume = 48 | issue = 3, March  | pages = e219– | year = 2016 | pmid =  26964835| doi = 10.1038/emm.2016.6 | pmc = 4892884 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Insulin is a hormone that regulates glucose levels, allowing the body's cells to absorb and use glucose. Without it, glucose cannot enter the cell and therefore cannot be used as fuel for the body's functions.&lt;ref&gt;Estela, Carlos (2011) "Blood Glucose Levels," Undergraduate Journal of Mathematical Modeling: One + Two: Vol. 3: Iss. 2, Article 12.&lt;/ref&gt; If the pancreas is exposed to persistently high elevations of blood glucose levels, the [[beta cell|insulin-producing cells]] in the pancreas could be damaged, causing a lack of insulin in the body. Insulin resistance occurs when the pancreas tries to produce more and more insulin in response to persistently elevated blood glucose levels. Eventually, the rest of the body becomes resistant to the insulin that the pancreas is producing, thereby requiring more insulin to achieve the same blood glucose-lowering effect, and forcing the pancreas to produce even more insulin to compete with the resistance. This negative spiral contributes to pancreatic burnout, and the disease progression of diabetes.

To monitor the body's response to blood glucose-lowering therapy, glucose levels can be measured. [[Blood glucose monitoring]] can be performed by multiple methods, such as the fasting glucose test which measures the level of glucose in the blood after 8 hours of fasting. Another test is the 2-hour glucose tolerance test (GTT) – for this test, the person has a fasting glucose test done, then drinks a 75-gram glucose drink and is retested. This test measures the ability of the person's body to process glucose. Over time the blood glucose levels should decrease as insulin allows it to be taken up by cells and exit the blood stream.

===Overweight and fatty liver===
An increased intake of glucose leads to [[obesity]] and, in consequence, partly to the [[metabolic syndrome]] with [[non-alcoholic fatty liver disease]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/S2213-8587(14)70032-4 |pmid=24731669|year=2014|last1=Yki-Järvinen|first1=H.|title=Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease as a cause and a consequence of metabolic syndrome|journal=The Lancet. Diabetes &amp; Endocrinology|volume=2|issue=11|pages=901–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not the consumption of glucose as part of a normal calorie intake.

===Hypoglycemia management===
[[File:Soluţie glucoză 5%.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Glucose, 5% solution for [[infusion]]s]]
Individuals with [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] or other conditions that result in [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugar]] often carry small amounts of sugar in various forms.  One sugar commonly used is glucose, often in the form of glucose tablets (glucose pressed into a tablet shape sometimes with one or more other ingredients as a binder), [[hard candy]], or [[sugar packet]].{{clear}}

In the USA almost exclusively corn (more precisely: corn syrup) is used as glucose source for the production of [[isoglucose]], which is a mixture of glucose and fructose, since fructose has a higher sweetening power — with same physiological calorific value of 374 kilocalories per 100 g. The annual world production of isoglucose is eight million tonnes (as of 2011).&lt;ref name="Ullmann 48" /&gt; When made from corn syrup, the final product is [[high fructose corn syrup]] (HFCS).

Most soft drinks in the US use HFCS-55 (with a fructose content of 55% in the dry mass), while most other HFCS-sweetened foods in the US use HFCS-42 (with a fructose content of 42% in the dry mass).&lt;ref name="fda2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/FoodAdditivesIngredients/ucm324856.htm|title=High Fructose Corn Syrup: Questions and Answers|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|date=2014-11-05|accessdate=2017-12-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180125013538/https://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/FoodAdditivesIngredients/ucm324856.htm|archivedate=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the neighboring country Mexico, on the other hand, cane sugar is used in the soft drink as a sweetener, which has a higher sweetening power.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Pang: [https://web.archive.org/web/20110629002034/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002076071_coke29.html ''Mexican Coke a hit in U.S.''] In: ''[[Seattle Times]]'', October 29, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, glucose syrup is used, inter alia, in the production of [[confectionery]] such as [[candy|candies]], [[toffee]] and [[fondant icing|fondant]].&lt;ref name="Beckett"&gt;Steve T. Beckett: ''Beckett's Industrial Chocolate Manufacture and Use.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2017, {{ISBN|978-1-118-78014-5}}, p.&amp;nbsp;82.&lt;/ref&gt; Typical chemical reactions of glucose when heated under water-free conditions are the [[caramelization]] and, in presence of amino acids, the [[maillard reaction]].

In addition, various organic acids can be biotechnologically produced from glucose, for example by fermentation with ''[[Clostridium thermoaceticum]]'' to produce [[acetic acid]], with ''[[Penicilium notatum]]'' for the production of [[araboascorbic acid]], with ''[[Rhizopus delemar]]'' for the production of [[fumaric acid]], with ''[[Aspergillus niger]]'' for the production of [[gluconic acid]], with ''[[Candida brumptii]]'' to produce [[isocitric acid]], with ''[[Aspergillus terreus]]'' for the production of [[itaconic acid]], with ''[[Pseudomonas fluorescens]]'' for the production of [[2-ketogluconic acid]], with ''[[Gluconobacter suboxydans]]'' for the production of [[5-ketogluconic acid]], with ''[[Aspergillus oryzae]]'' for the production of [[kojic acid]], with ''[[Lactobacillus delbrueckii]]'' for the production of [[lactic acid]], with ''[[Lactobacillus brevis]]'' for the production of [[malic acid]], with ''[[Propionibacter shermanii]]'' for the production of [[propionic acid]], with ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' for the production of [[pyruvic acid]] and with ''[[Gluconobacter suboxydans]]'' for the production of [[tartaric acid]].&lt;ref name="Kent"&gt;James A. Kent: ''Riegel's Handbook of Industrial Chemistry.'' Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2013, {{ISBN|978-1-475-76431-4}}, p.&amp;nbsp;938.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
Specifically, when a glucose molecule is to be detected at a certain position in a larger molecule, [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]], [[X-ray crystallography]] analysis or [[lectin]] [[immunostaining]] is performed with [[concanavalin A]] reporter enzyme conjugate (that binds only glucose or mannose).

===Classical qualitative detection reactions===
These reactions have only historical significance:

====Fehling Test====
The [[Fehling test]] is a classic method for the detection of aldoses.&lt;ref name="Fehling-Harn"&gt;H. Fehling: ''Quantitative Bestimmung des Zuckers im Harn.'' In: ''[[Archiv für physiologische Heilkunde]]'' (1848), volume 7, p.&amp;nbsp;64–73. (german)&lt;/ref&gt; Due to mutarotation, glucose is always present to a small extent as an open-chain aldehyde. By adding the Fehling reagents (Fehling (I) solution and Fehling (II) solution), the aldehyde group is oxidized to a [[carboxylic acid]], while the Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; tartrate complex is reduced to Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and forming a brick red precipitate (Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).

====Tollens Test====
In the [[Tollens test]], after addition of ammoniacal [[Silver nitrate|AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] to the sample solution, Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is reduced by glucose to elemental [[silver]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Tollens: [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112025692838;view=1up;seq=535 ''Über ammon-alkalische Silberlösung als Reagens auf Aldehyd'']. In ''[[Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft]]'' (1882), volume 15, p. 1635–1639. (german)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Barfoed test====
In [[Barfoed's test]],&lt;ref name="barfoed"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01462957|title=Ueber die Nachweisung des Traubenzuckers neben Dextrin und verwandten Körpern|journal=Zeitschrift Für Analytische Chemie|volume=12|pages=27–32|year=1873|last1=Barfoed|first1=C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a solution of dissolved [[copper acetate]], [[sodium acetate]] and [[acetic acid]] is added to the solution of the sugar to be tested and subsequently heated in a water bath for a few minutes. Glucose and other monosaccharides rapidly produce a reddish color and reddish brown [[copper(I) oxide]] (Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).

====Nylander's Test====
As a reducing sugar, glucose reacts in the [[Nylander's test]].&lt;ref&gt;Emil Nylander: ''Über alkalische Wismuthlösung als Reagens auf Traubenzucker im Harne'', [[Zeitschrift für physiologische Chemie]]. Volume 8, Issue 3, 1884, p.&amp;nbsp;175–185 [http://www.degruyter.com/dg/viewarticle/j$002fbchm1.1884.8.issue-3$002fbchm1.1884.8.3.175$002fbchm1.1884.8.3.175.xml Abstract]. (german)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other tests====
Upon heating a dilute [[potassium hydroxide]] solution with glucose to 100&amp;nbsp;°C, a strong reddish browning and a caramel-like odor develops.&lt;ref name="Schwedt 102"&gt;Georg Schwedt: ''Zuckersüße Chemie.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2012, {{ISBN|978-3-527-66001-8}}, p.&amp;nbsp;102. (german)&lt;/ref&gt; Concentrated [[sulfuric acid]] dissolves dry glucose without blackening at room temperature forming sugar sulfuric acid.&lt;ref name="Schwedt 102" /&gt; In a yeast solution, alcoholic fermentation produces carbon dioxide in the ratio of 2.0454 molecules of glucose to one molecule of [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref name="Schwedt 102" /&gt; Glucose forms a black mass with [[stannous chloride]].&lt;ref name="Schwedt 102" /&gt; In an ammoniacal silver solution, glucose (as well as lactose and dextrin) leads to the deposition of silver. In an ammoniacal [[lead acetate]] solution, white [[lead glycoside]] is formed in the presence of glucose, which becomes less soluble on cooking and turns brown.&lt;ref name="Schwedt 102" /&gt; In an ammoniacal copper solution, yellow [[copper oxide]] hydrate is formed with glucose at room temperature, while red copper oxide is formed during boiling (same with dextrin, except for with an ammoniacal [[copper acetate]] solution).&lt;ref name="Schwedt 102" /&gt; With [[Hager's reagent]], glucose forms [[mercury oxide]] during boiling.&lt;ref name="Schwedt 102" /&gt; An alkaline [[bismuth]] solution is used to precipitate elemental, black-brown bismuth with glucose.&lt;ref name="Schwedt 102" /&gt; Glucose boiled in an [[ammonium molybdate]] solution turns the solution blue. A solution with [[indigo carmine]] and [[sodium carbonate]] destains when boiled with glucose.&lt;ref name="Schwedt 102" /&gt;

===Instrumental Quantification===
====Refractometry and Polarimetry====
In concentrated solutions of glucose with a low proportion of other carbohydrates, its concentration can be determined with a polarimeter. For sugar mixtures, the concentration can be determined with a [[refractometer]], for example in the [[Oechsle scale|Oechsle]] determination in the course of the production of wine.

====Photometric enzymatic methods in solution====
{{main|Glucose oxidation reaction}}
The enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx) converts glucose into gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide while consuming oxygen. Another enzyme, peroxidase, catalyzes a chromogenic reaction (Trinder reaction)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1177/000456326900600108|title=Determination of Glucose in Blood Using Glucose Oxidase with an Alternative Oxygen Acceptor|journal=Annals of Clinical Biochemistry: An International Journal of Biochemistry and Laboratory Medicine|volume=6|pages=24–27|year=1969|last1=Trinder|first1=P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[phenol]] with [[4-Aminoantipyrine|4-aminoantipyrine]] to a purple dye.

====Photometric Test Strip Method====
The test strip method employs the above-mentioned enzymatic conversion of glucose to gluconic acid to form hydrogen peroxide. The reagents are immobilised on a polymer matrix, the so-called test strip, which assumes a more or less intense color. This can be measured reflectometrically at 510&amp;nbsp;nm with the aid of an LED-based handheld photometer. This allows for routine blood sugar determination by laymen. In addition to the reaction of phenol with 4-aminoantipyrine, new chromogenic reactions have been developed that allow photometry at higher wavelengths (550&amp;nbsp;nm, 750&amp;nbsp;nm).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1039/A709038B|title=Water-soluble chromogenic reagent for colorimetric detection of hydrogen peroxide—an alternative to 4-aminoantipyrine working at a long wavelength|journal=Analytical Communications|volume=35|issue=2|pages=71–74|year=1998|last1=Mizoguchi|first1=Makoto|last2=Ishiyama|first2=Munetaka|last3=Shiga|first3=Masanobu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Amperometric glucose sensor====
The electroanalysis of glucose is also based on the enzymatic reaction mentioned above. The produced hydrogen peroxide can be amperometrically quantified by anodic oxidation at a potential of 600 mV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=18154363|year=2008|last1=Wang|first1=J.|title=Electrochemical glucose biosensors|journal=Chemical Reviews|volume=108|issue=2|pages=814–25|doi=10.1021/cr068123a}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The GOx is immobilised on the electrode surface or in a membrane placed close to the electrode. Precious metals such as platinum or gold are used in electrodes, as well as carbon nanotube electrodes, which e.g. are doped with boron.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.talanta.2008.04.023 |pmid=18656655|year=2008|last1=Chen|first1=X.|title=Amperometric glucose biosensor based on boron-doped carbon nanotubes modified electrode|journal=Talanta|volume=76|issue=4|pages=763–7|last2=Chen|first2=J.|last3=Deng|first3=C.|last4=Xiao|first4=C.|last5=Yang|first5=Y.|last6=Nie|first6=Z.|last7=Yao|first7=S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cu-CuO nanowires are also used as enzyme-free amperometric electrodes. This way a detection limit of 50 µmol/L has been achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00604-009-0260-1|title=Enzyme-free amperometric sensing of glucose using Cu-CuO nanowire composites|journal=Microchimica Acta|volume=168|pages=87–92|year=2010|last1=Wang|first1=Guangfeng|last2=Wei|first2=Yan|last3=Zhang|first3=Wei|last4=Zhang|first4=Xiaojun|last5=Fang|first5=Bin|last6=Wang|first6=Lun}}&lt;/ref&gt; A particularly promising method is the so-called "enzyme wiring". In this case, the electron flowing during the oxidation is transferred directly from the enzyme via a molecular wire to the electrode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1021/ac00087a008 |pmid=8092486|year=1994|last1=Ohara|first1=T. J.|title="Wired" enzyme electrodes for amperometric determination of glucose or lactate in the presence of interfering substances|journal=Analytical Chemistry|volume=66|issue=15|pages=2451–7|last2=Rajagopalan|first2=R.|last3=Heller|first3=A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other sensory methods====
There are a variety of other chemical sensors for measuring glucose.&lt;ref name="Borisov"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1021/cr068105t |pmid=18229952|year=2008|last1=Borisov|first1=S. M.|title=Optical biosensors|journal=Chemical Reviews|volume=108|issue=2|pages=423–61|last2=Wolfbeis|first2=O. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1177/193229681100500507 |pmc=3208862 |pmid=22027299|year=2011 |last1=Ferri |first1=S. |title=Review of glucose oxidases and glucose dehydrogenases: A bird's eye view of glucose sensing enzymes |journal=Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=1068–76 |last2=Kojima |first2=K. |last3=Sode |first3=K. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the importance of glucose analysis in the life sciences, numerous optical probes have also been developed for saccharides based on the use of boronic acids,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00604-008-0947-8|title=Boronic acid based probes for microdetermination of saccharides and glycosylated biomolecules|journal=Microchimica Acta|volume=162|pages=1–34|year=2008|last1=Mader|first1=Heike S.|last2=Wolfbeis|first2=Otto S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are particularly useful for intracellular sensory applications where other (optical) methods are not or only conditionally usable. In addition to the organic boronic acid derivatives, which often bind highly specifically to the 1,2-diol groups of sugars, there are also other probe concepts classified by functional mechanisms which use selective glucose-binding proteins (e.g. concanavalin A) as a receptor. Furthermore, methods were developed which indirectly detect the glucose concentration via the concentration of metabolised products, e.g. by the consumption of oxygen using fluorescence-optical sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0956-5663(99)00073-1|title=Sol–gel based glucose biosensors employing optical oxygen transducers, and a method for compensating for variable oxygen background|journal=Biosensors and Bioelectronics|volume=15|pages=69–76|year=2000|last1=Wolfbeis|first1=Otto S.|last2=Oehme|first2=Ines|last3=Papkovskaya|first3=Natalya|last4=Klimant|first4=Ingo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, there are enzyme-based concepts that use the intrinsic absorbance or fluorescence of (fluorescence-labeled) enzymes as reporters.&lt;ref name="Borisov" /&gt;

====Copper iodometry====
Glucose can be quantified by copper iodometry.&lt;ref name="Galant"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.04.071 |pmid=26041177|year=2015|last1=Galant|first1=A. L.|title=Glucose: Detection and analysis|journal=Food Chemistry|volume=188|pages=149–60|last2=Kaufman|first2=R. C.|last3=Wilson|first3=J. D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chromatographic methods===
In particular, for the analysis of complex mixtures containing glucose, e.g. in honey, chromatographic methods such as [[high performance liquid chromatography]] and [[gas chromatography]]&lt;ref name="Galant" /&gt; are often used in combination with [[mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref&gt;M. L. Sanz, J. Sanz, I. Martínez-Castro: ''Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric method for the qualitative and quantitative determination of disaccharides and trisaccharides in honey.'' In: ''[[Journal of Chromatography A]]'', volume 1059, issue 1–2, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;143–148; {{PMID|15628134}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mpg-210190"&gt;{{cite web|title=Glucose mass spectrum|periodical=Golm Metabolome Database|publisher=|url=http://gmd.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/Spectrums/8dee81a1-8d98-4a73-b55d-9de42f10e190.aspx|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2018-06-04|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=[[Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology]] in Golm Database|date=2007-07-19|month=|day=|language=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking into account the isotope ratios, it is also possible to reliably detect honey adulteration by added sugars with these methods.&lt;ref&gt;A.

{{globalize|date=February 2016}}
'''Health administration''' or '''healthcare administration''' is the field relating to leadership, management, and administration of [[public health]] systems, [[health care systems]], [[hospital]]s, and [[hospital network]]s.

==Terminology==
Health systems management or health care systems management describes the leadership and general management of [[hospitals]], [[hospital network]]s, and/or [[health care systems]].  In international use, the term refers to management at all levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/management/en|title=World Health Organization - Management|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212002640/http://www.who.int/topics/management/en/|archivedate=2009-02-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, management of a single institution (e.g. a hospital) is also referred to as "medical and health services management",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov|title=Bureau of Labor Statistics|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423042046/http://www.bls.gov/|archivedate=2013-04-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "healthcare management", or "health administration".

Health systems management ensures that specific outcomes are attained, that departments within a health facility are running smoothly, that the right people are in the right jobs, that people know what is expected of them, that resources are used efficiently and that all departments are working towards a common goal.

==Hospital administrators==
Hospital administrators are individuals or groups of people who act as the central point of control within hospitals. These individuals may be previous or current [[clinician]]s, or individuals with other backgrounds. There are two types of administrators, generalists and specialists. Generalists are individuals who are responsible for managing or helping to manage an entire facility. Specialists are individuals who are responsible for the efficient operations of a specific department such as policy analysis, finance, accounting, budgeting, human resources, or marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mshealthcareers.com/careers/healthcareadmin.htm |title=Health Care Administrator |accessdate=11 September 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702233306/http://www.mshealthcareers.com/careers/healthcareadmin.htm |archivedate=2 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported in September 2014, that the United States spends roughly $218 billion per year on hospital's administration costs, which is equivalent to 1.43 percent of the total [[United States economy|U.S. economy]]. Hospital administration has grown as a percent of the U.S. economy from .9 percent in 2000 to 1.43 percent in 2012, according to ''Health Affairs''. In 11 different countries, hospitals allocate approximately 12 percent of their budget toward administrative costs. In the United States, hospitals spend 25 percent on administrative costs.&lt;ref name="Kliff-administractive costs"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kliff|first1=Sarah|title=$1.43 of every $100 in America goes toward hospital administration|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/9/15/6151861/1-43-of-every-100-in-america-towards-hospital-paperwork|publisher=Vox|accessdate=16 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915211307/http://www.vox.com/2014/9/15/6151861/1-43-of-every-100-in-america-towards-hospital-paperwork|archivedate=15 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Associated qualifications===
Health care management is usually studied through healthcare administration&lt;ref name="NE"&gt;[http://www.newenglandcollegeonline.com/bachelors-degree-healthcare-administration/ "Bachelor's Degree in Healthcare Administration"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208031955/http://www.newenglandcollegeonline.com/bachelors-degree-healthcare-administration/ |date=2013-02-08 }} ''[[New England College]]''&lt;/ref&gt; or healthcare management&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.floridatechonline.com/undergraduate-ba-healthcare-management-degree/|title=Bachelor of Arts in Business Administration Healthcare Management - Online Healthcare Management Degree|author=|date=|website=Florida Tech Online|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820105146/http://www.floridatechonline.com/undergraduate-ba-healthcare-management-degree/|archivedate=2013-08-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; programs in a business school or, in some institutions, in a school of public health.

====North America====
Although many colleges and universities are offering a [[bachelor's degree]] in healthcare administration or human resources,&lt;ref name="NE" /&gt; a [[master's degree]] is considered the "standard credential"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos014.htm|title=Bureau of Labor Statistics - Occupational Outlook Handbook entry|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105224955/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos014.htm|archivedate=2009-01-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for most health administrators in the United States. Research and academic-based doctorate level degrees, such as the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Health Administration and the Doctor of Health Administration (DHA) degree, prepare health care professionals to turn their clinical or administrative experiences into opportunities to develop new knowledge and practice, teach, shape public policy and/or lead complex organizations.  There are multiple recognized degree types that are considered equivalent from the perspective of professional preparation.

The [[Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Management Education]] (CAHME) is the [[Educational accreditation|accrediting body]] overseeing master's-level programs in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] on behalf of the [[United States Department of Education]]. It accredits several degree program types, including Master of Hospital Administration (MHA), [[Master of Health Administration|Master of Health Services Administration]] (MHSA), [[Master of Business Administration|Master of Business Administration in Hospital Management]] (MBA-HM), [[Master of Health Administration]] (MHA), [[Master of Public Health]] (MPH, MSPH, MSHPM), [[Master of Science]] (MS-HSM, MS-HA), and [[Master of Public Administration]] (MPA).

Health care management study is a new discipline in Nepal. [[Pokhara University]] offers a Hospital Management course. National Open College launched a four-year Bachelor's level (BHCM) course in September 2000 with an enrolment of 40 students, and the next year it also started a one-year postgraduate diploma (PGDHCM) and a two-year master's course (MHCM) in health care management. Nobel College at Sinamangal has also been offering a Bachelor’s level (BHCM) course since 2006. MD Hospital administration (MDHA) and Master in Hospital Management (MHM) are being started from 2013. It is uncertain how many citizens of Nepal are gaining healthcare management qualifications in other countries. There is an absence of  professional organization and regulation in the health care management profession in Nepal.

=== Professional organizations ===
There are a variety of different professional associations related to health systems management, which can be subcategorized as either personal or institutional membership groups. Personal membership groups are joined by individuals, and typically have individual skills and career development as their focus. Larger personal membership groups include the [[Healthcare Financial Management Association]], and the [[Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society]]. Institutional membership groups are joined by organizations; whereas they typically focus on organizational effectiveness, and may also include data-sharing agreements and other medical related or administrative practice sharing vehicles for member organizations. Prominent examples include the [[American Hospital Association]] and the University Healthsystems Consortium.

==History==

Early hospital administrators were called patient directors or superintendents. At the time, many were nurses who had taken on administrative responsibilities. Over half of the members of the [[American Hospital Association]] were graduate nurses in 1916. Other superintendents were medical doctors, laymen and members of the clergy. 
In the United States, the first degree granting program in the United States was established at [[Marquette University]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]. By 1927, the first two students received their degrees. The original idea is credited to Father Moulinier, associated with the Catholic Hospital Association.&lt;ref&gt;Haddock, Cynthia Carter [http://www.healthmanagementcareers.org/haddock_ch01.pdf "A Brief History of Healthcare Management"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904050920/http://www.healthmanagementcareers.org/haddock_ch01.pdf |date=2012-09-04 }}, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern health systems management program was established in 1934 at the University of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gphap.uchicago.edu/aboutgphap.shtml|title=University of Chicago - Graduate Program in Health Administration and Policy|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620062442/http://gphap.uchicago.edu/aboutgphap.shtml|archivedate=2010-06-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, programs were completed in two years – one year of formal graduate study and one year of practicing internship.  In 1958, the Sloan program at [[Cornell University]] began offering a special program requiring two years of formal study,&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, R. (1999). "In sickness and in wealth: American hospitals in the twentieth century."  Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which remains the dominant structure in the United States and Canada today (see also "Academic Preparation").

"Careers in Healthcare Management: How to Find your Path and Follow It."

However the visibility of the management profession within healthcare has been rising in recent years, due largely to the widespread problems developed countries are having in balancing cost, access, and quality in their hospitals and health systems.&lt;ref&gt;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2006).

[[Radon]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|eɪ|d|ɒ|n}}) is a [[radioactive decay|radioactive]], colorless, odorless, tasteless [[noble gas]], occurring naturally as the decay product of [[radium]]. It is one of the densest substances that remains a gas under normal conditions, and is considered to be a health hazard due to its radioactivity. Its most stable [[isotope]], [[radon-222|&lt;sup&gt;222&lt;/sup&gt;Rn]], has a [[half-life]] of 3.8 days. Due to its high radioactivity, it has been less well-studied by chemists, but a few compounds are known.

Radon is formed as part of the normal radioactive decay chain of [[uranium]] into [[Decay chain|&lt;sup&gt;206&lt;/sup&gt;Pb]]. Uranium has been present since the earth was formed and its [[isotopes of uranium|most common isotope]] has a very long half-life (4.5 billion years), which is the time required for one-half of uranium to break down. Thus, uranium and radon, will continue to occur for millions of years at about the same concentrations as they do now.&lt;ref name=USPHS90&gt;[http://www.bvsde.paho.org/bvstox/i/fulltext/toxprofiles/radon.pdf Toxological profile for radon], [[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]], U.S. Public Health Service, In collaboration with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, December 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Radon is responsible for the majority of the mean public exposure to [[ionizing radiation]]. It is often the single largest contributor to an individual's background radiation dose, and is the most variable from location to location. Radon gas from natural sources can accumulate in buildings, especially in confined areas such as attics, and basements. It can also be found in some spring waters and hot springs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Facts about Radon |publisher=Facts about |url=http://www.facts-about.org.uk/science-element-radon.htm |accessdate=September 7, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009035009/http://www.facts-about.org.uk/science-element-radon.htm |archivedate=October 9, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2003 report ''EPA's Assessment of Risks from Radon in Homes'' from the [[United States]] [[Environmental Protection Agency]], [[epidemiological]] evidence shows a clear link between [[lung cancer]] and high concentrations of radon, with 21,000 radon-induced U.S. lung cancer deaths per year—second only to cigarette smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report: EPA's Assessment of Risks from Radon in Homes |url=http://www.epa.gov/radon/risk_assessment.html |accessdate=April 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus in geographic areas where radon is present in heightened concentrations, radon is considered a significant [[indoor air quality|indoor air]] contaminant.

Here is a typical deposition rate of &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Pb as observed in Japan as a function of time, due to variations in radon concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Radon |first6=C |last6=Kim |first5=Y |last5=Igarashi |first4=K |last4=Hirose |first3=K |last3=Sasaki |first2=A |last2=Sakaguchi |author= Yamamoto, M. |journal=Journal of Environmental Radioactivity |year=2006 |doi=10.1016/j.jenvrad.2005.08.001 |issue=1 |volume=86 |pmid=16181712|pages=110–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Radon concentration is usually measured in the atmosphere in [[becquerel]]s per cubic meter (Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), which is an [[SI derived unit]]. As a frame of reference, typical domestic exposures are about 100 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; indoors and 10-20 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; outdoors. In the US, radon concentrations are often measured in [[picocurie]]s per liter (pCi/l), with 1 pCi/l&amp;nbsp;= 37 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="EPA03"/&gt;

The mining industry traditionally measures exposure using the ''[[working level]]'' (WL) index, and the cumulative exposure in ''working level months'' (WLM): 1 WL equals any combination of short-lived &lt;sup&gt;222&lt;/sup&gt;Rn progeny (&lt;sup&gt;218&lt;/sup&gt;Po, &lt;sup&gt;214&lt;/sup&gt;Pb, &lt;sup&gt;214&lt;/sup&gt;Bi, and &lt;sup&gt;214&lt;/sup&gt;Po) in 1 liter of air that releases 1.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; MeV of potential alpha energy;&lt;ref name="EPA03"/&gt; one WL is equivalent to 2.08 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; joules per cubic meter of air (J/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name=USPHS90/&gt; The SI unit of cumulative exposure is expressed in joule-hours per cubic meter (J·h/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). One WLM is equivalent to 3.6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; J·h/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. An exposure to 1 WL for 1 working month (170 hours) equals 1 WLM cumulative exposure.

A cumulative exposure of 1 WLM is roughly equivalent to living one year in an atmosphere with a radon concentration of 230 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-carmin.cea.fr/espace-pedagogique/rayonnements-ionisants-et-sante/les-radionucleides/radon-rn French CEA note on Radon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222042407/http://www-carmin.cea.fr/espace-pedagogique/rayonnements-ionisants-et-sante/les-radionucleides/radon-rn |date=December 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The radon (&lt;sup&gt;222&lt;/sup&gt;Rn) released into the air decays to &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Pb and other radioisotopes. The levels of &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Pb can be measured. The rate of deposition of this [[radioisotope]] is dependent on the weather.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Radon concentrations found in natural environments are much too low to be detected by chemical means: for example, a 1000 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (relatively high) concentration corresponds to 0.17 [[pico-]]gram per cubic meter. The average concentration of radon in the atmosphere is about 6{{e|-20}} atoms of radon for each molecule in the air, or about 150 atoms in each ml of air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=June 26, 2008 |url=http://www.us.lindegas.com/International/Web/LG/US/MSDS.nsf/NotesMSDS/Air+002/$file/Air+002.pdf |title=HEALTH HAZARD DATA|publisher=[[The Linde Group]]|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire radon activity of the Earth's atmosphere at a time is due to some tens of grams of radon, consistently replaced by decay of larger amounts of radium and uranium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=July 7, 2009 |url=http://www.laradioactivite.com/fr/site/pages/radon.htm |title= Le Radon. Un gaz radioactif naturel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concentrations can vary greatly from place to place. In the open air, it ranges from 1 to 100 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, even less (0.1 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) above the ocean. In caves, aerated mines, or in poorly ventilated dwellings, its concentration can climb to 20-2,000 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance {{cite journal |author1=Sperrin, Malcolm |author2=Gillmore, Gavin |author3=Denman, Tony |year=2001 |title=Radon concentration variations in a Mendip cave cluster |journal=Environmental Management and Health |volume=12|pages=476–482|doi=10.1108/09566160110404881 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mining contexts, radon concentrations can be much higher. Ventilation regulations try to maintain concentrations in uranium mines under the "working level", and under 3 WL (546 pCi &lt;sup&gt;222&lt;/sup&gt;Rn per liter of air; 20.2 kBq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; measured from 1976 to 1985) 95 percent of the time.&lt;ref name=USPHS90/&gt;
The concentration in the air at the (unventilated) [[Bad Gastein|Gastein]] Healing Gallery averages 43 kBq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (about 1.2 nCi/L) with maximal value of 160 kBq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (about 4.3 nCi/L).&lt;ref name=zdo&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2203/dose-response.05-025.Zdrojewicz |title=Radon Treatment Controversy, Dose Response |first2=Jadwiga (Jodi) |year=2006 |last2=Strzelczyk |pmc=2477672 |volume=4 |issue=2|author=Zdrojewicz, Zygmunt |journal=Dose-Response |pmid=18648641 |pages=106–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radon emanates naturally from the ground and from some building materials all over the world, wherever traces of uranium or [[thorium]] can be found, and particularly in regions with soils containing [[granite]] or [[shale]], which have a higher concentration of uranium. Every square mile of surface soil, to a depth of 6&amp;nbsp;inches (2.6&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to a depth of 15&amp;nbsp;cm), contains approximately 1&amp;nbsp;gram of radium, which releases radon in small amounts to the atmosphere&lt;ref name=USPHS90/&gt; [[Sand]] used in making [[concrete]] is the major source of radon in buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook Of Radon In Buildings: Detection, Safety, &amp; Control|page=28-32|author=Mueller Associates, SYSCON Corporation, [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]]|publisher=CRC Press|year=1988|isbn=0891168230}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On a global scale, it is estimated that 2,400 million curies (91 TBq) of radon are released from soil annually. Not all granitic regions are prone to high emissions of radon. Being a rare gas, it usually migrates freely through faults and fragmented soils, and may accumulate in caves or water. Due to its very small [[half-life]] (four days for [[radon-222|&lt;sup&gt;222&lt;/sup&gt;Rn]]), its concentration decreases very quickly when the distance from the production area increases.

Its atmospheric concentration varies greatly depending on the season and conditions. For instance, it has been shown to accumulate in the air if there is a [[inversion (meteorology)|meteorological inversion]] and little wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Steck, Daniel J. |author2=Field, R. William |author3=Lynch, Charles F. |title=Exposure to Atmospheric Radon|journal= Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=107|issue=2|year=1999 |url=http://www.ehponline.org/members/1999/107p123-127steck/steck-full.html |doi=10.2307/3434368|jstor=3434368|pmid=9924007|pmc=1566320|pages=123–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because atmospheric radon concentrations are very low, radon-rich water exposed to air continually loses radon by [[volatilization]]. Hence, [[ground water]] generally has higher concentrations of &lt;sup&gt;222&lt;/sup&gt;Rn than [[surface water]], because the radon is continuously produced by radioactive decay of &lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;[[radium|Ra]] present in rocks. Likewise, the saturated zone of a soil frequently has a higher radon content than the unsaturated zone because of diffusional losses to the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=June 28, 2008|title=The Geology of Radon |url=http://energy.cr.usgs.gov/radon/georadon/3.html |publisher=United States Geological Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=June 28, 2008 |url=http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU2008/08953/EGU2008-A-08953.pdf?PHPSESSID= |format=PDF|title=Radon-222 as a tracer in groundwater-surface water interactions|publisher=Lancaster University}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a below-ground source of water, some [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]]s—including [[hot spring]]s—contain significant amounts of radon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cheec.uiowa.edu/misc/radon_occ.pdf|title=Radon Occurrence and Health Risk|author=Field, R.

Radon is also found in some petroleum. Because radon has a similar pressure and temperature curve as propane, and oil refineries separate petrochemicals based on their boiling points, the piping carrying freshly separated propane in oil refineries can become partially radioactive due to radon decay particles. Residues from the [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas|gas]] industry often contain radium and its daughters. The sulfate scale from an oil well can be radium rich, while the water, oil, and gas from a well often contains radon. The radon decays to form solid radioisotopes which form coatings on the inside of pipework. In an oil processing plant, the area of the plant where [[propane]] is processed is often one of the more contaminated areas, because radon has a similar boiling point as propane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=National Energy Board|accessdate=July 7, 2009 |url=http://www.neb-one.gc.ca/clf-nsi/rsftyndthnvrnmnt/sfty/sftydvsr/1994/nbs199401-eng.pdf |title=Potential for Elevated Radiation Levels In Propane |date=April 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accumulation in dwellings===&lt;!-- this section is (or was) #-linked from [[Limerick Nuclear Power Plant]] and [[Stanley Watras]] --&gt;
[[File:Radon Lognormal distribution.gif|thumb|Typical Lognormal radon distribution in dwellings]]
Typical domestic exposures are of ≈ 100 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; indoors, but specifics of construction and ventilation strongly affect levels of accumulation; a further complications for risk assessment is that concentrations in a single location may differ by a factor of two over an hour, and concentrations can vary greatly even between two adjoining rooms in the same structure.&lt;ref name=USPHS90/&gt;

The distribution of radon concentrations tends to be asymmetrical around the average, the larger concentrations have a disproportionately greater weight. Indoor radon concentration is usually assumed to follow a [[lognormal distribution]] on a given territory.&lt;ref&gt;Numerous references, see for instance [http://www.geology.cz/extranet/vav/geochemie-zp/radon/sympozia/2006/radon-2006-258-265.pdf Analysis And Modelling Of Indoor Radon Distributions Using Extreme Values Theory] or [http://www.geology.cz/extranet/vav/geochemie-zp/radon/sympozia/2006/radon-2006-252-257.pdf Indoor Radon in Hungary (Lognormal Mysticism)] for a discussion.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the [[geometric mean]] is generally used for estimating the "average" radon concentration in an area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aprg.utoledo.edu/radon/datacoll.html |title= Data Collection and Statistical Computations |accessdate=July 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The mean concentration ranges from less than 10 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to over 100 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in some European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=July 7, 2009 |url=http://www.unscear.org/docs/reports/2006/09-81160_Report_Annex_E_2006_Web.pdf |publisher=UNSCEAR|title=Sources-to-effects assessment for radon in homes and workplaces}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical [[geometric standard deviation]]s found in studies range between 2 and 3, meaning (given the [[68-95-99.7 rule]]) that the radon concentration is expected to be more than a hundred times the mean concentration for 2 to 3% of the cases.

The so-called&lt;!--by whom--&gt; '''Watras incident''' (named after the American construction engineer Stanley Watras), in which an employee at a U.S. nuclear plant triggered radiation monitors while leaving work over several days—despite the fact that the plant had yet to be fueled, and despite the employee being decontaminated and sent home "clean" each evening, dramatized that radon levels in particular dwellings can occasionally be orders of magnitude higher than typical.
This implied a source of contamination outside the plant, which turned out to be radon levels of 100,000 [[Becquerel|Bq]]/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (2.7 [[Curie|nCi]]/L) in the worker's basement.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/reaction/etc/script.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health effects==

===Cancer in miners===
[[File:WLM-Cancer risk.jpg|thumb|Relative risk of lung cancer mortality by cumulative exposure to radon decay products (in WLM) from the combined data from 11 cohorts of underground hard rock miners. Though high exposures (&gt;50 WLM) cause statistically significant excess cancers, the evidence on small exposures (10 WLM) is inconclusive and appears slightly beneficial in this study (see [[radiation hormesis]]).]]

The health effects of high exposure to radon in mines, where exposures reaching 1,000,000 [[becquerel|Bq]]/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; can be found, can be recognized in [[Paracelsus]]' 1530 description of a wasting disease of miners, the ''mala metallorum.'' Though at the time radon itself was not understood to be the cause—indeed, neither it nor radiation had even been discovered—mineralogist [[Georg Agricola]] recommended ventilation of mines to avoid this mountain sickness (''Bergsucht'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radon-france.com/pdf/historique.pdf Le radon, aspects historiques et perception du risque] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009164542/http://www.radon-france.com/pdf/historique.pdf |date=October 9, 2007 }}, Roland Masse.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/csem/radon/whosat_risk.html Radon Toxicity: Who is at Risk?], Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879, the "wasting" was identified as lung cancer by Herting and Hesse in their investigation of miners from Schneeberg, Germany.

Beyond mining in general, radon is a particular problem in the [[uranium mining|mining of uranium]];
significant excess lung cancer deaths have been identified in [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies of uranium miners and other hard-rock miners employed in the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.1989.03430050045024 |volume=262 |issue=5 |last=Roscoe |first=R.

The first major studies with radon and health occurred in the context of uranium mining, first in the [[Joachimsthal]] region of [[Bohemia]] and then in the [[Southwestern United States]] during the early [[Cold War]]. Because radon is a product of the [[radioactive decay]] of uranium, underground uranium mines may have high concentrations of radon. Many uranium miners in the [[Four Corners]] region contracted [[lung cancer]] and other pathologies as a result of high levels of exposure to radon in the mid-1950s. The increased incidence of lung cancer was particularly pronounced among [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[Mormon]] miners, because those groups normally have low rates of lung cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |volume=85 |issue=4 |last=Roscoe |first=R.

Safety standards requiring expensive ventilation were not widely implemented or policed during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Century of X-rays and Radioactivity in Medicine|author=Mould, Richard Francis|year=1993|isbn=0-7503-0224-0|publisher=CRC Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In studies of uranium miners, workers exposed to radon levels of 50 to 150 picocuries of radon per liter of air (2000–6000 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) for about 10 years have shown an increased frequency of lung cancer.&lt;ref name=USPHS90/&gt;
Statistically significant excesses in lung cancer deaths were present after cumulative exposures of less than 50 WLM.&lt;ref name=USPHS90/&gt;
There is, however, unexplained heterogeneity in these results (whose confidence interval do not always overlap).&lt;ref name="EPA03"/&gt;
The size of the radon-related increase in lung cancer risk varied by more than an order of magnitude between the different studies.&lt;ref name="Darby05"/&gt;

Heterogeneities are possibly due to systematic errors in exposure ascertainment, unaccounted for differences in the study populations (genetic, lifestyle, etc.), or confounding mine exposures.&lt;ref name="EPA03"/&gt; There are a number of [[confounding factor]]s to consider, including exposure to other agents, ethnicity, smoking history, and work experience. The cases reported in these miners cannot be attributed solely to radon or radon daughters but may be due to exposure to silica, to other mine pollutants, to smoking, or to other causes.&lt;ref name=USPHS90/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Lubin JH, Boice JD, Edling C, etal |title=Lung cancer in radon-exposed miners and estimation of risk from indoor exposure |journal=J. Natl. Cancer Inst. |volume=87 |issue=11 |year=1995|pmid=7791231|doi=10.1093/jnci/87.11.817 |pages=817–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The majority of miners in the studies are smokers and all inhale dust and other pollutants in mines. Because radon and cigarette smoke both cause lung-cancer, and since the effect of smoking is far above that of radon, it is complicated to disentangle the effects of the two kinds of exposure; misinterpreting the smoking habit by a few percent can blur out the radon effect.&lt;ref name="BEIR VI"/&gt;

Since that time, ventilation and other measures have been used to reduce radon levels in most affected mines that continue to operate. In recent years, the average annual exposure of uranium miners has fallen to levels similar to the concentrations inhaled in some homes. This has reduced the risk of occupationally induced cancer from radon, although it still remains an issue both for those who are currently employed in affected mines and for those who have been employed in the past.&lt;ref name="Darby05"/&gt;
The power to detect any excess risks in miners nowadays is likely to be small, exposures being much smaller than in the early years of mining.&lt;ref name=UNSCEAR06/&gt;

A confounding factor with mines is that both radon concentration and carcinogenic dust (such as quartz dust) depend on the amount of ventilation.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3461166 | pmid=22929885 | doi=10.1038/bjc.2012.374 | volume=107 | title=Quantitative relationship between silica exposure and lung cancer mortality in German uranium miners, 1946-2003 | year=2012 | journal=Br.

The primary route of exposure to radon and its progeny is inhalation. Radiation exposure from radon is indirect. The health hazard from radon does not come primarily from radon itself, but rather from the radioactive products formed in the decay of radon.&lt;ref name=USPHS90/&gt; The general effects of radon to the human body are caused by its radioactivity and consequent risk of [[radiation-induced cancer]]. Lung cancer is the only observed consequence of high concentration radon exposures; both human and animal studies indicate that the lung and respiratory system are the primary targets of radon daughter-induced toxicity.&lt;ref name=USPHS90/&gt;

Radon has a short half-life (3.8 days) and decays into other solid particulate [[decay chain#Radium series|radium-series]] radioactive nuclides.
Two of these decay products, polonium-218 and 214, present a significant radiologic hazard.&lt;ref name=williams&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cheec.uiowa.edu/misc/radon_occ.pdf |format=PDF |last=Field |first=R. William |year=1999 |accessdate=February 2, 2008 |title=Radon Occurrence and Health Risk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lTMHBlx2?url=http://www.cheec.uiowa.edu/misc/radon_occ.pdf |archivedate=November 22, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
If the gas is inhaled, the radon atoms decay in the airways or the lungs, resulting in radioactive polonium and ultimately lead atoms attaching to the nearest tissue. If dust or aerosol is inhaled that already carries radon decay products, the deposition pattern of the decay products in the respiratory tract depends on the behaviour of the particles in the lungs. Smaller diameter particles diffuse further into the respiratory system, whereas the larger&amp;nbsp;— tens to hundreds of micron-sized&amp;nbsp;— particles often deposit higher in the airways and are cleared by the body's mucociliary staircase. Deposited radioactive atoms or dust or aerosol particles continue to decay, causing continued exposure by emitting energetic [[alpha radiation]] with some associated gamma radiation too, that can damage vital molecules in lung cells,&lt;ref name="EPA radon" /&gt;
by either creating [[free radical]]s or causing [[DNA]] breaks or damage,&lt;ref name=williams/&gt;
perhaps causing mutations that sometimes turn cancerous. In addition, through ingestion and blood transport, following crossing of the lung membrane by radon, radioactive progeny may also be transported to other parts of the body.

The risk of lung cancer caused by smoking is much higher than the risk of lung cancer caused by indoor radon. Radiation from radon has been attributed to increase of lung cancer among smokers too. It is generally believed that exposure to radon and cigarette smoking are synergistic; that is, that the combined effect exceeds the sum of their independent effects. This is because the daughters of radon often become attached to smoke and dust particles, and are then able to lodge in the lungs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Biermann|first=A.H. |author2=Sawyer, S.R.|title=Attachment of radon progeny to cigarette-smoke aerosols|journal=Information Bridge|date=May 1, 1995 |url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=78555|doi=10.2172/78555 |accessdate=February 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unknown whether radon causes other types of cancer, but recent studies suggest a need for further studies to assess the relationship between radon and [[leukemia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=B. J. |author2=Zhang, L. |author3=Field, W. R.  |pmid=17373673 |title=Iowa radon leukaemia study: a hierarchical population risk model for spatially correlated exposure measured with error |year=2007 |journal=Statistics in Medicine |doi=10.1002/sim.2884 |issue=25 |volume=26 |pages=4619–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16759978 |title=Incidence of leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma in Czech uranium miners: a case-cohort study |last=Rericha |first=V. |author2=Kulich, M. |author3=Rericha, R. |author4=Shore, D.

The effects of radon, if found in food or drinking water, are unknown. Following ingestion of radon dissolved in water, the biological half-life for removal of radon from the body ranges from 30 to 70 minutes. More than 90% of the absorbed radon is eliminated by exhalation within 100 minutes, By 600 minutes, only 1% of the absorbed amount remains in the body.&lt;ref name=USPHS90/&gt;

=== Health risks in children ===
While radon presents the aforementioned risks in adults, exposure in children leads to a unique set of health hazards that are still being researched. The physical composition of children leads to faster rates of exposure through inhalation given that their respiratory rate is higher than that of adults, resulting in more gas exchange and more potential opportunities for radon to be inhaled.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Toxicological Profile for Radon. Available online: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp145.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Accessed on 19 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this potentially higher dose of radon inhalation, children have smaller lungs, which can become damaged much more quickly than adults’ lungs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, children who are exposed to radon and who live in a household where they are exposed to tobacco smoke have a 20 times greater risk of developing lung cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Agency for Toxic Substances &amp; Disease Registry. Radon Toxicity. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/csem/csem.asp?csem=8&amp;po=7&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Accessed October 16, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting health effects in children are similar to those of adults, predominantly including lung cancer and respiratory illnesses such as asthma, bronchitis, and pneumonia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While there have been numerous studies assessing the link between radon exposure and childhood leukemia, the results are largely varied. Many ecological studies show a positive association between radon exposure and childhood leukemia; however, most case control studies have produced a weak correlation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tong | first1 = J | last2 = Qin | first2 = L | last3 = Jianxiang | first3 = Y | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al | year = 2012 | title = Environmental Radon Exposure and Childhood Leukemia | url = | journal = Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health | volume = 15 | issue = 5| pages = 332–347 | doi=10.1080/10937404.2012.689555}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genotoxicity has been noted in children exposed to high levels of radon, specifically a significant increase of frequency of aberrant cells was noted, as well as an “increase in the frequencies of single and double fragments, chromosome interchanges, [and] number of aberrations chromatid and chromosome type”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Druzhinin | first1 = V | last2 = Sinitsky | first2 = MY | last3 = Larionov | first3 = AV | last4 = Volobaev | first4 = VP | last5 = Minina | first5 = VI | last6 = Golovina | first6 = TA | year = 2015 | title = Assessing the level of chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes in long-term resident children under conditions of high exposure to radon and its decay products | url = | journal = Mutagenesis | volume = 50 | issue = | page = 5 | doi=10.1093/mutage/gev029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Childhood exposure ===
Because radon is generally associated with diseases that are not detected until many years after elevated exposure, the public may not consider the amount of radon that children are currently being exposed to. Aside from the exposure in the home, one of the major contributors to radon exposure in children are the schools in which they attend almost every day. A survey was conducted in schools across the United States to detect radon levels, and it was estimated that about one in five schools has at least one room (more than 70,000 schoolrooms) with short-term levels above 4pCi/L.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency (2017). Radon in Schools. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.epa.gov/radon/radon-schools&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The only way to know the level of radon is to test for it, and levels of radon vary across the world. This EPA mapping tool shows average levels of radon by area: &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.epa.gov/radon/find-information-about-local-radon-zones-and-state-contact-information&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

Many states have active radon testing and mitigation programs in place, which require testing in buildings such as public schools. However, these are not standardized nationwide, and the rules and regulations on reducing high radon levels are even less common. The School Health Policies and Practices Study (SHPPS), conducted by the CDC in 2012, found that of schools located in counties with high predicted indoor radon levels, only 42.4% had radon testing policies, and a mere 37.5% had policy for radon-resistant new construction practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foster | first1 = S. | last2 = Jones | first2 = S. E. | year = 2016 | title = December 13).

For exposure standards to be effective, they should be set for those most susceptible.

===Effective dose and cancer risks estimations===
[[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation|UNSCEAR]] recommends&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation|publisher=UNSCEAR |year=2000 |title=Report to the General Assembly, with scientific annexes&amp;nbsp;— Annex B, § 153}}&lt;/ref&gt; a reference value of 9 nSv (Bq·h/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.
For example, a person living (7000 h/year) in a concentration of 40 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; receives an effective dose of 1 mSv/year.

Studies of miners exposed to radon and its decay products provide a direct basis for assessing their lung cancer risk.

According to the UNSCEAR modeling, based on these miner's studies, the excess relative risk from long-term residential exposure to radon at 100 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is considered to be about 0.16 (after correction for uncertainties in exposure assessment), with about a threefold factor of uncertainty higher or lower than that value.&lt;ref name=UNSCEAR06/&gt;
In other words, the absence of ill effects (or even positive [[hormesis]] effects) at 100 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; are compatible with the known data.

The ICPR 65 model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=ICRP Publication 65: Protection Against Radon-222 at Home and at work, Annals of the ICRP |volume= 23/2 |publisher=Elsevier|year=1994|isbn= 0-08-042475-9 |url=http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/bookdescription.cws_home/30291/description#description |author=a report of a Task Group of the International Commission on Radiological Protection.}}&lt;/ref&gt; follows the same approach, and estimates the relative lifelong risk probability of radon-induced cancer death to 1.23 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; per Bq/(m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;·year).&lt;ref name="Pirard"&gt;Principes, construction et présentation des coefficients de risque proposés par la CIPR 65 et le BEIR VI, précisions sur les incertitudes associées. Philippe PIRARD. [http://apheis.net/publications/2003/radon/annexes.pdf on line]&lt;/ref&gt; This relative risk is a global indicator; the risk estimation is independent of sex, age, or smoking habit. Thus, if a smoker's chances of dying of lung cancer are 10 times that of a nonsmoker's, the relative risks for a given radon exposure will be the same according to that model, meaning that the absolute risk of a radon-generated cancer for a smoker is (implicitly) tenfold that of a nonsmoker.
The risk estimates correspond to a unit risk of approximately 3–6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; per Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, assuming a lifetime risk of lung cancer of 3%. This means that a person living in an average European dwelling with 50 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; has a lifetime excess lung cancer risk of 1.5–3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;. Similarly, a person living in a dwelling with a high radon concentration of 1000 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; has a lifetime excess lung cancer risk of 3–6%, implying a doubling of background lung cancer risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euro.who.int/air/activities/20050223_3 |title=WHO air quality guidelines for Europe, 2nd edition|year= 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BEIR VI model proposed by the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] of the USA&lt;ref name="BEIR VI"/&gt; is more complex. It is a multiplicative model that estimates an excess risk per exposure unit. It takes into account age, elapsed time since exposure, and duration and length of exposure, and its parameters allow for taking smoking habits into account.&lt;ref name="Pirard"/&gt;
In the absence of other causes of death, the absolute risks of lung cancer by age 75 at usual radon concentrations of 0, 100, and 400 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; would be about 0.4%, 0.5%, and 0.7%, respectively, for lifelong nonsmokers, and about 25 times greater (10%, 12%, and 16%) for cigarette smokers.&lt;ref name="DarbyBMJ"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Darby S, Hill D, Auvinen A, etal |title=Radon in homes and risk of lung cancer: collaborative analysis of individual data from 13 European case-control studies |journal=BMJ |volume=330 |issue=7485|page=223 |year=2005 |pmid=15613366 |pmc=546066 |doi=10.1136/bmj.38308.477650.63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is great uncertainty in applying risk estimates derived from studies in miners to the effects of residential radon, and direct estimates of the risks of residential radon are needed.&lt;ref name="Darby05"/&gt;

As with the miner data, the same confounding factor of other carcinogens such as dust applies.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt; Radon concentration is high in poorly ventilated homes and buildings and such buildings tend to have poor air quality, larger concentrations of dust etc. BEIR VI did not consider that other carcinogens such as dust might be the cause of some or all of the lung cancers, thus omitting a possible spurious relationship.

==Studies on domestic exposure==
[[File:Average-radiation.gif|thumb|400px|Average radiation doses received in Germany. Radon accounts for half of the background dose; and medical doses reach the same levels as background dose.]]

The largest natural contributor to public radiation dose is radon, a naturally occurring, radioactive gas found in soil and rock,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Radiation Dose Chart |publisher=American Nuclear Society |year=2007 |url=http://www.ans.org/pi/resources/dosechart/ |accessdate=February 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which comprises approximately 55% of the annual background dose.
Radon gas levels vary by locality and the composition of the underlying soil and rocks.

Radon (at concentrations encountered in mines) was recognized as carcinogenic in the 1980s, in view of the lung cancer statistics for miners' cohorts.&lt;ref name=Catelinois /&gt;
Although radon may present significant risks, thousands of persons annually go to radon-contaminated mines for deliberate exposure to help with the symptoms of [[arthritis]] without any serious health effects.&lt;ref name=Falkenbach&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Falkenbach A, Kovacs J, Franke A, Jörgens K, Ammer K, etal |title=Radon therapy for the treatment of rheumatic diseases--review and meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials |journal=Rheumatology international |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=205–10 |year=2005|pmid=14673618 |doi=10.1007/s00296-003-0419-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Franke&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=10952746 |year=2000|author1=Franke, A |author2=Reiner, L |author3=Pratzel, Hg |author4=Franke, T |author5=Resch, Kl |title=Long-term efficacy of radon spa therapy in rheumatoid arthritis-a randomized, sham-controlled study and follow-up|volume=39 |issue=8|journal=Rheumatology (Oxford, England) |url=http://rheumatology.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10952746 |doi=10.1093/rheumatology/39.8.894 |pages=894–902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radon as a terrestrial source of [[background radiation]] is of particular concern because, although overall very rare, where it does occur it often does so in high concentrations. Some of these areas, including parts of [[Cornwall]] and [[Aberdeenshire]] have high enough natural radiation levels that nuclear licensed sites cannot be built there—the sites would already exceed legal limits before they opened, and the natural topsoil and rock would all have to be disposed of as [[low-level nuclear waste]].&lt;ref name=pubs /&gt;{{Clarify|date=June 2010}}
People in affected localities can receive up to 10 mSv per year background radiation.&lt;ref name=pubs&gt;{{cite web |title=Publications|publisher=United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation |date=February 6, 2008 |url=http://www.unscear.org/unscear/en/publications.html |accessdate=February 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This{{Clarify|date=June 2010}} led to a health policy problem: what is the health impact of exposure to radon concentrations (100 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) typically found in some buildings?{{Clarify|date=June 2010}}&lt;!-- "typically" kind of contradicts "some" --&gt;

===Detection methods===
When exposure to a carcinogenic substance is suspected, the cause/effect relationship on any given case can never be ascertained. Lung cancer occurs spontaneously, and there is no difference between a "natural" cancer and another one caused by radon (or smoking). Furthermore, it takes years for a cancer to develop, so that determining the past exposure of a case is usually very approximative. The health effect of radon can only be demonstrated through theory and statistical observation.

The [[study design]] for [[epidemiological methods]] may be of three kinds:
*The best proofs come from observations of [[cohort study|cohort]]s (predetermined populations with known exposures and exhaustive follow-up), such as those on miners, or on Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors. Such studies are efficient, but very costly{{Clarify|date=June 2010}}&lt;!-- Efficient inconsistent with costly, unless you mean the statistical concept of estimator efficiency, which seems unlikely --&gt; when the population needs to be a large one. Such studies can only be used when the effect is strong enough, hence, for high exposures.
*Alternate proofs are [[case-control study|case-control studies]] (the environment factors of a "case" population is individually determined, and compared to that of a "control″ population, to see what the difference might have been, and which factors may be significant), like the ones that have been used to demonstrate the link between lung cancer and smoking. Such studies can identify key factors when the signal/noise ratio is strong enough, but are very sensitive to selection bias, and prone to the existence of confounding factors.
*Lastly, [[ecological studies]] may be used (where the global environment variables and their global effect on two different populations are compared). Such studies are "cheap and dirty": they can be easily conducted on very large populations (the whole USA, in Dr Cohen's study), but are prone to the existence of confounding factors, and exposed to the [[ecological fallacy]] problem.

Furthermore, theory and observation must confirm each other for a relationship to be accepted as fully proven. Even when a statistical link between factor and effect appears significant, it must be backed by a theoretical explanation; and a theory is not accepted as factual unless confirmed by observations.

===Epidemiology studies of domestic exposures===
[[File:Radon and Cancer by Cohen.GIF|thumb|A controversial epidemiological study, unexpectedly showing ''decreased'' cancer risk vs. radon domestic exposure (5 pCi/L ≈ 200 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cohen BL |title=A test of the linear-no threshold theory of radiation carcinogenesis |journal=Environ. Res.|volume=53 |issue=2|year=1990|pmid=2253600|doi=10.1016/S0013-9351(05)80119-7 |bibcode=1990ER.....53..193C |pages=193–220}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study lacks individual level controls for smoking and radon exposure, and therefore lacks statistical power to draw definitive conclusions. Because of this, the error bars (which simply reflect the raw data variability) are probably too small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Heath CW, Bond PD, Hoel DG, Meinhold CB |title=Residential radon exposure and lung cancer risk: commentary on Cohen's county-based study |journal=Health Phys |volume=87|issue=6|year=2004|pmid=15545771|doi=10.1097/01.HP.0000138588.59022.40|pages=647–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other expert panels, the [[World Health Organization|WHO]]'s [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] concluded that these analyses "can be rejected."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |series=IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans |volume=78 |title=Ionizing Radiation, Part 2: Some Internally Deposited Radionuclides |publisher=World Health Organization, International Agency for Research on Cancer |year=2001 |url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol78/mono78.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Cohort studies are impractical for the study of domestic radon exposure. With the expected effect of small exposures being very small, the direct observation of this effect would require huge cohorts: the populations of whole countries.

Several [[ecological studies]] have been performed to assess possible relationships between selected cancers and estimated radon levels within particular geographic regions where environmental radon levels appear to be higher than other geographic regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cohen BL |title=Test of the linear-no threshold theory of radiation carcinogenesis for inhaled radon decay products |journal=Health Phys |volume=68 |issue=2|year=1995 |pmid=7814250 |url=http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/%7Eblc/LNT-1995.PDF |format=PDF |doi=10.1097/00004032-199502000-00002 |pages=157–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Results of such ecological studies are mixed; both positive and negative associations, as well as no significant associations, have been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp145.html#bookmark12 |title=Toxicological Profile for Radon, Draft for Public Comment|publisher= Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry|date= September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most direct way to assess the risks posed by radon in homes is through case-control studies.

The studies have not produced a definitive answer, primarily because the risk is likely to be very small at the low exposure encountered from most homes and because it is difficult to estimate radon exposures that people have received over their lifetimes. In addition, it is clear that far more lung cancers are caused by smoking than are caused by radon.&lt;ref name="BEIR VI"&gt;{{cite web|title=Health Effects of Exposure to Radon: BEIR VI |year=1999 |url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=5499&amp;page=2|publisher= National Academy of Sciences|isbn= 0-309-05645-4|vauthors = ((Committee on Health Risks of Exposure to Radon)), ((Board on Radiation Effects Research)), ((Commission on Life Sciences, National Research Council))}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epidemiologic radon studies have found trends to increased lung cancer risk from radon with a no evidence of a threshold, and evidence against a threshold above high as 150 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (almost exactly the EPA's action level of 4 pCi/L).&lt;ref name="DarbyBMJ"/&gt; Another study similarly found that there is no evidence of a threshold but lacked the statistical power to clearly identify the threshold at this low level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.radonnews.org/RadonRiskStudies/NorthAmericanPooling.pdf |format=PDF |last=Krewski |first=D.|journal=Epidemiology |volume=16 |doi=10.1097/01.ede.0000152522.80261.e3 |title=Residential radon and risk of lung cancer: A combined analysis of 7 North American case-control studies |year=2005 |accessdate=April 29, 2009 |pmid=15703527 |issue=2 |pages=137–45|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the latter deviance from zero at low level convinced the [[World Health Organization]] that, "The dose-response relation seems to be linear without evidence of a threshold, meaning that the lung cancer risk increases proportionally with increasing radon exposure."&lt;ref name="WHO291"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[World Health Organization]] |title=Radon and cancer, fact sheet 291 |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs291/en/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most elaborate [[case-control study|case-control]] epidemiologic radon study performed by [[R. William Field]] and colleagues identified a 50% increased lung cancer risk with prolonged radon exposure at the EPA's action level of 4 pCi/L.&lt;ref name=Field/&gt; Iowa has the highest average radon concentrations in the United States and a very stable population which added to the strength of the study. For that study, the odds ratio was found to be increased slightly above the confidence interval (95% CI) for cumulative radon exposures above 17 WLM (6.2 pC/L=230 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and above).

The results of a methodical ten-year-long, case-controlled study of residential radon exposure in Worcester County, Massachusetts, found an apparent 60% ''reduction'' in lung cancer risk amongst people exposed to low levels (0–150 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of radon gas; levels typically encountered in 90% of American homes—an apparent support for the idea of radiation [[hormesis]].&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Thompson, R.E. |author2=Nelson, D.F. |author3=Popkin, J.H. |author4=Popkin, Z. |year= 2008|title=Case-control study of lung cancer risk from residential radon exposure in Worcester County, Massachusetts|publisher=Health Physics|journal=The Radiation Safety Journal|volume=94|issue=3|pmid=18301096|doi=10.1097/01.HP.0000288561.53790.5f|pages=228–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that study, a significant result (95% CI) was obtained for the 75-150 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; category.
The study paid close attention to the [[cohort (statistics)|cohort's]] levels of smoking, occupational exposure to carcinogens and education attainment. However, unlike the majority of the residential radon studies, the study was not population-based. Errors in retrospective exposure assessment could not be ruled out in the finding at low levels. Other studies into the effects of domestic radon exposure have not reported a hormetic effect; including for example the respected "Iowa Radon Lung Cancer Study" of Field et al. (2000), which also used sophisticated radon exposure [[dosimetry]].&lt;ref name=Field/&gt;

==Intentional exposure==
"Radon therapy" is an intentional exposure to [[radon]] via inhalation or ingestion. Nevertheless, epidemiological evidence shows a clear link between breathing high concentrations of radon and incidence of lung cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts145.html ToxFAQs for Radon, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arthritis===
In the late 20th century and early 21st century, some "health mines" were established in [[Basin, Montana]], which attracted people seeking relief from health problems such as [[arthritis]] through limited exposure to radioactive mine water and radon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/2143 |title=Radon Health Mines: Boulder and Basin, Montana|publisher= Roadside America|accessdate=December 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is controversial because of the "well-documented ill effects of high-dose radiation on the body."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salak|first=Kara|author2=Nordeman, Landon|title=59631: Mining for Miracles|journal=National Geographic|publisher=National Geographic Society|year=2004 |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0401/feature7/index.html |accessdate=June 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radon has nevertheless been found to induce beneficial long-term effects.&lt;ref name=Franke /&gt;

===Bathing===
Radioactive water baths have been applied since 1906 in [[Jáchymov]], [[Czech Republic]], but even before radon discovery they were used in [[Bad Gastein]], [[Austria]]. Radium-rich springs are also used in traditional [[Japan]]ese [[onsen]] in [[Misasa, Tottori|Misasa]], [[Tottori Prefecture]]. Drinking therapy is applied in [[Bad Brambach]], [[Germany]]. Inhalation therapy is carried out in Gasteiner-Heilstollen, [[Austria]], in [[Kowary]], [[Poland]] and in [[Boulder, Montana]], [[United States]]. In the United States and Europe there are several "radon [[destination spa|spas]]", where people sit for minutes or hours in a high-radon atmosphere in the belief that low doses of radiation will invigorate or energize them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=June 26, 2008 |url=http://www.petros.cz/spa/spa_ja.asp |title=Jáchymov |publisher=Petros |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020107060646/http://www.petros.cz/spa/spa_ja.asp |archivedate=January 7, 2002 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radiotherapy===
Radon has been produced commercially for use in [[radiation therapy]], but for the most part has been replaced by radionuclides made in accelerators and nuclear reactors. Radon has been used in implantable seeds, made of gold or glass, primarily used to treat cancers.
The gold seeds were produced by filling a long tube with radon pumped from a radium source, the tube being then divided into short sections by crimping and cutting. The gold layer keeps the radon within, and filters out the alpha and beta radiations, while allowing the gamma rays to escape (which kill the diseased tissue). The activities might range from 0.05 to 5 millicuries per seed (2 to 200 MBq).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orau.org/ptp/collection/brachytherapy/seeds.htm |title= Radon seeds |accessdate=May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gamma rays are produced by radon and the first short-lived elements of its [[decay chain]] (&lt;sup&gt;218&lt;/sup&gt;Po, &lt;sup&gt;214&lt;/sup&gt;Pb, &lt;sup&gt;214&lt;/sup&gt;Bi, &lt;sup&gt;214&lt;/sup&gt;Po).

Radon and its first [[decay product]]s being very short-lived, the seed is left in place. After 12 half-lives (43 days), radon radioactivity is at 1/2000 of its original level. At this stage, the predominant residual activity is due to the radon [[decay product]] &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Pb, whose half-life (22.3 year) is 2000 times that of radon (and whose activity is thus 1/2000 of radon's), and its descendants &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Bi and &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Po, totalizing 0.03% of the initial seed activity.

==Health policies==

=== Current public health policy efforts ===

=== Federal Radon Action Plan ===
The Federal Radon Action Plan, also known as FRAP, was created in 2010 and launched in 2011.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Protecting People and Families from Radon: a Federal Action Plan for Saving Lives. United States Environmental Protection Agency. Available online at &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-08/documents/Federal_Radon_Action_Plan.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Accessed 17 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It was piloted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in conjunction with the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, the Interior, Veterans Affairs, and the General Services Administration. The goal set forth by FRAP was to eliminate radon induced cancer that can be prevented by expanding radon testing, mitigating high levels of radon exposure, and developing radon resistant construction, and to meet Healthy People 2020 radon objectives.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; They identified the barriers to change as limited public knowledge of the dangers of radon exposure, the perceived high costs of mitigation, and the availability of radon testing. As a result, they also identified major ways to create change: demonstrate the importance of testing and the ease of mitigation, provide incentives for testing and mitigation, and build the radon services industry.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; To complete these goals, representatives from each organization and department established specific commitments and timelines to complete tasks and continued to meet periodically. However, FRAP was concluded in 2016 as The National Radon Action Plan took over. In the final report on commitments, it was found that FRAP completed 88% of their commitments.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Federal Radon Action Plan (FRAP). United States Environmental Protection Agency. Available online at &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.epa.gov/radon/federal-radon-action-plan-frap&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They reported achieving the highest rates of radon mitigation and new construction mitigation in the United States as of 2014.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; FRAP concluded that because of their efforts, at least 1.6 million homes, schools, and childcare facilities received direct and immediate positive effects.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== National Radon Action Plan ===
The National Radon Action Plan, also known as NRAP, was created in 2014 and launched in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;The National Radon Action Plan: A Strategy for Saving Lives. Available online at &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.epa.gov/radon/national-radon-action-plan-strategy-saving-lives&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Accessed 17 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It is led by The American Lung Association with collaborative efforts from the American Association of Radon Scientists and Technologists, American Society of Home Inspectors, Cancer Survivors Against Radon, Children’s Environmental Health Network, Citizens for Radioactive Radon Reduction, Conference of Radiation Control Program Directors, Environmental Law Institute, National Center for Healthy Housing, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The goals of NRAP are to continue efforts set forth by FRAP to eliminate radon induced cancer that can be prevented by expanding radon testing, mitigating high levels of radon exposure, and developing radon resistant construction.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;National Radon Action Plan: A Strategy for Saving Lives.

Accessed 17 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; NRAP also aims to reduce radon risk in 5 million homes, and save 3,200 lives by 2020.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; To complete these goals, representatives from each organization have established the following action plans: embed radon risk reduction as a standard practice across housing sectors, provide incentives and support to test and mitigate radon, promote the use of certified radon services and build the industry, and increase public attention to radon risk and the importance of reduction.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The NRAP is currently in action, implementing programs, identifying approaches, and collaborating across organizations to achieve these goals.

===Dose-effect model retained===
The only dose-effect relationship available are those of miners cohorts (for much higher exposures), exposed to radon. Studies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors are less informative (the exposure to radon is chronic, localized, and the ionizing radiations are alpha rays).
Although low-exposed miners experienced exposures comparable to long-term residence in high-radon dwellings, the mean cumulative exposure among miners is approximately 30-fold higher than that associated with long-term residency in a typical home. Moreover, the smoking is a significant confounding factor in all miners' studies. It can be concluded from miner studies that when the radon exposure in dwellings compares to that in mines (above 1000 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), radon is a proven health hazard; but in the 1980s very little was known on the dose-effect relationship, both theoretically and statistical.

Studies have been made since the 1980s, both on epidemiological studies and in the [[radiobiology]] field.
In the [[radiobiology]] and [[carcinogenesis]] studies, progress has been made in understanding the first steps of cancer development, but not to the point of validating a reference dose-effect model. The only certainty gained is that the process is very complex, the resulting dose-effect response being complex, and most probably not a linear one.
Biologically based models have also been proposed that could project substantially reduced carcinogenicity at low doses.&lt;ref name="EPA03"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=7983461 |year=1994|author=Elkind, Mm |title=Radon-induced cancer: a cell-based model of tumorigenesis due to protracted exposures |volume=66 |issue=5 |journal=International journal of radiation biology |doi=10.1080/09553009414551771 |pages=649–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moolgavkar SH, Knudson AG |title=Mutation and cancer: a model for human carcinogenesis |journal=J.

In the epidemiological field, no definite conclusion has been reached. However, from the evidence now available, a threshold exposure, that is, a level of exposure below which there is no effect of radon, cannot be excluded.&lt;ref name="BEIR VI"/&gt; L

Given the radon distribution observed in dwellings, and the dose-effect relationship proposed by a given model, a theoretical number of victims can be calculated, and serve as a basis for public health policies.

With the BEIR VI model, the main health effect (nearly 75% of the death toll) is to be found at low radon concentration exposures, because most of the population (about 90%) lives in the 0-200 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; range.&lt;ref&gt;Évaluation de l’impact sanitaire de l’exposition domestique au radon en France, in [http://www.invs.sante.fr/beh/2007/18_19/index.htm Numéro thématique - Impact sanitaire du radon domestique: de la connaissance à l’action], 15 mai 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this modeling, the best policy is obviously to reduce the radon levels of all homes where the radon level is above average, because this leads to a significant decrease of radon exposure on a significant fraction of the population; but this effect is predicted in the 0-200 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; range, where the linear model has its maximum uncertainty. From the statistical evidence available, a threshold exposure cannot be excluded; if such a threshold exists, the real radon health effect would in fact be limited to those homes where the radon concentrations reaches that observed in mines&amp;nbsp;— at most a few percent. If a [[radiation hormesis]] effect exists after all, the situation would be even worse: under that hypothesis, suppressing the natural low exposure to radon (in the 0-200 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; range) would actually lead to an increase of cancer incidence, due to the suppression of this (hypothetical) protecting effect. As the low-dose response is unclear, the choice of a model is very controversial.

No conclusive statistics being available for the levels of exposure usually found in homes, the risks posed by domestic exposures is usually estimated on the basis of observed lung-cancer deaths caused by higher exposures in mines, under the assumption that the risk of developing lung-cancer increases linearly as the exposure increases.&lt;ref name="BEIR VI"/&gt; This was the basis for the model proposed by BEIR IV in the 1980s. The [[linear no-threshold model]] has since been kept in a conservative approach by the UNSCEAR&lt;ref name=UNSCEAR06/&gt; report and the BEIR VI and BEIR VII&lt;ref&gt;
http://books.nap.edu/catalog/11340.html Health Risks from Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation: BEIR VII Phase 2&lt;/ref&gt; publications, essentially for lack of a better choice:&lt;blockquote&gt;Until the [...] uncertainties on low-dose response are resolved, the Committee believes that [''the [[linear no-threshold model]]''] is consistent with developing knowledge and that it remains, accordingly, the most scientifically defensible approximation of low-dose response. However, a strictly linear dose response should not be expected in all circumstances.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The BEIR VI committee adopted the linear no-threshold assumption based on its understanding of the mechanisms of radon-induced lung cancer, but recognized that this understanding is incomplete and that therefore the evidence for this assumption is not conclusive.&lt;ref name="EPA03"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Death toll attributed to radon===
In discussing these figures, it should be kept in mind that both the radon distribution in dwelling and its effect at low exposures are not precisely known, and the radon health effect has to be computed (deaths caused by radon domestic exposure cannot be observed as such). These estimations are strongly dependent on the model retained.

According to these models, radon exposure is thought to be the second major cause of lung cancer after smoking.&lt;ref name=Catelinois&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Catelinois O, Rogel A, Laurier D, etal |title=Lung cancer attributable to indoor radon exposure in france: effect of the risk models and uncertainty analysis |journal=Environ.

Based on studies carried out by the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in the United States, radon would thus be the second leading cause of [[lung cancer]] after [[tobacco smoking|smoking]], and accounts for 15,000 to 22,000 cancer deaths per year in the US alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=June 26, 2008 |url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/radon |title=Radon and Cancer: Questions and Answers|publisher=[[National Cancer Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, residential radon would be, after cigarette smoking, the second most frequent cause of lung cancer deaths: according to models, 83.9% of deaths are attributed to smoking only, 1.0% to radon only, and 5.5% to a combination of radon and smoking.&lt;ref name="Darby05"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Darby, S |author2=Hill, D |author3=Doll, R |title=Radon: a likely carcinogen at all exposures |journal=Annals of Oncology|volume=12|issue=10 |year=2005|pmid=11762803|doi=10.1023/A:1012518223463|pages=1341–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Health Organization has recommended a radon reference concentration of 100 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (2.7 pCi/L).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241547673_eng.pdf |title=WHO handbook on indoor radon|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Union]] recommends that action should be taken starting from concentrations of 400 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (11 pCi/L) for older dwellings and 200 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (5 pCi/L) for newer ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/97053/4.6_-RPG4_Rad_Ex1-ed2010_editedViv_layouted.pdf |title= Radon Levels in Dwellings: Fact Sheet 4.6 |date=December 2009 |publisher= European Environment and Health Information System |accessdate= July 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After publication of the North American and European Pooling Studies, [[Health Canada]] proposed a new guideline that lowers their action level from 800 to 200 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (22 to 5 pCi/L).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Radon |work=It's Your Health |publisher=Health Canada|date=June 2007 |url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hl-vs/iyh-vsv/environ/radon-eng.php |accessdate=February 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) strongly recommends action for any dwelling with a concentration higher than 148 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (4 pCi/L),&lt;ref name="EPA radon"&gt;{{cite web |title=Radiation Protection: Radon |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] |date=November 2007 |url=http://www.epa.gov/radiation/radionuclides/radon.html |accessdate =April 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and encourages action starting at 74 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (2 pCi/L).

EPA recommends that all homes should be monitored for radon. If testing shows levels less than 4 picocuries radon per liter of air (160 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), then no action is necessary. For levels of 20 picocuries radon per liter of air (800 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) or higher, the home owner should consider some type of procedure to decrease indoor radon levels.&lt;ref name=USPHS90/&gt; For instance, as radon has a half-life of four days, opening the windows once a day can cut the mean radon concentration to one fourth of its level.

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) recommends homes be fixed if an occupant's long-term exposure will average 4 picocuries per liter (pCi/L) that is 148 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/radon/ |title=United States Environmental Protection Agency: Radon |accessdate=June 26, 2008 |date=August 8, 2007|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPA estimates that one in 15 homes in the United States has radon levels above the recommended guideline of 4 pCi/L.&lt;ref name="EPA radon"/&gt;
EPA radon risk level tables including comparisons to other risks encountered in life are available in their citizen's guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Citizen's Guide to Radon: The Guide to Protecting Yourself and Your Family from Radon |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] |date=November 2007 |url=http://www.epa.gov/radon/pubs/citguide.html |accessdate=June 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The EPA estimates that nationally, 8% to 12% of all dwellings are above their maximum "safe levels" (four picocuries per liter—the equivalent to roughly 200 chest x-rays). The United States Surgeon General and the EPA both recommend that all homes be tested for radon.

The limits retained do not correspond to a known threshold in the biological effect, but are determined by a cost-efficiency analysis. EPA believes that a 150 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; level (4 pCi/L) is achievable in the majority of homes for a reasonable cost, the average cost per life saved by using this action level is about $700,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6360&amp;page=169 |title=Evaluation of Guidelines for Exposures to Technologically Enhanced Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials|publisher= National Research Council, Commission on Life Sciences|year= 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For radon concentration in drinkable water, the [[World Health Organization]] issued as guidelines (1988) that remedial action should be considered when the radon activity exceeded 100 kBq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in a building, and remedial action should be considered ''without long delay'' if exceeding 400 kBq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=USPHS90/&gt;

===Radon testing===
[[Image:Radon test kit.jpg|thumb|A radon test kit.]]
{{see also|Radon testing}}

There are relatively simple tests for radon gas. Radon test kits are commercially available. The short-term radon test kits used for screening purposes are inexpensive, in many cases free. Discounted test kits can be purchased online through The National Radon Program Services at Kansas State University or through state radon offices. Information about local radon zones and specific state contact information can be accessed through the EPA Map at &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.epa.gov/radon/find-information-about-local-radon-zones-and-state-contact-information&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  The kit includes a collector that the user hangs in the lowest livable floor of the dwelling for 2 to 7 days.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sosradon.org/devices|title=National radon program services.|last=Kansas State University.|access-date=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charcoal canisters are another type of short-term radon test, and are designed to be used for 2 to 4 days.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The user then sends the collector to a laboratory for analysis. Both devices are passive, meaning that they do not need power to function.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It should be noted that the accuracy of the residential radon test depends upon the lack of ventilation in the house when the sample is being obtained. Thus, the occupants will be instructed not to open windows, etc., for ventilation during the pendency of test, usually two days or more.

Long-term kits, taking collections for 3 months up to one year, are also available.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An open-land test kit can test radon emissions from the land before construction begins. A [[Lucas cell]] is one type of long-term device. A Lucas cell is also an active device, or one that requires power to function. Active devices provide continuous monitoring, and some can report on the variation of radon and interference within the testing period. These tests usually require operation by trained testers and are often more expensive than passive testing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The National Radon Proficiency Program (NRPP) provides a list of radon measurement professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aarst-nrpp.com/wp/database-search/|title=Member Search « AARST-NRPP|website=aarst-nrpp.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radon levels fluctuate naturally. An initial test might not be an accurate assessment of a home's average radon level. Transient weather can affect short term measurements.&lt;sup&gt;[95]&lt;/sup&gt; Therefore, a high result (over 4 pCi/L) justifies repeating the test before undertaking more expensive abatement projects. Measurements between 4 and 10 pCi/L warrant a long-term radon test. Measurements over 10 pCi/L warrant only another short-term test so that abatement measures are not unduly delayed. Purchasers of real estate are advised to delay or decline a purchase if the seller has not successfully abated radon to 4 pCi/L or less.&lt;sup&gt;[95]&lt;/sup&gt;

Since radon concentrations vary substantially from day to day, single grab-type measurements are generally not very useful, except as a means of identifying a potential problem area, and indicating a need for more sophisticated testing.[[Health effects of radon#cite note-USPHS90-1|&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] The EPA recommends that an initial short-term test be performed in a closed building. An initial short-term test of 2 to 90 days allows residents to be informed quickly in case a home contains high levels of radon. Long-term tests provide a better estimate of the average annual radon level.&lt;ref&gt;A citizen’s guide to radon. United States Environmental Protection Agency. Available online at: &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-12/documents/2016_a_citizens_guide_to_radon.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  Updated December 2016.

===Mitigation===
{{see also|Radon mitigation|Radon removal}}

Transport of radon in indoor air is almost entirely controlled by the ventilation rate in the enclosure. Since air pressure is usually lower inside houses than it is outside, the home acts like a vacuum, drawing radon gas in through cracks in the foundation or other openings such as ventilation systems.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;"Consumer’s Guide to Radon Reduction". United States Environmental Protection Agency. www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-12/documents/2016_consumers_guide_to_radon_reduction.pdf. Accessed on 10 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the indoor radon concentrations increase as ventilation rates decrease.[[Health effects of radon#cite note-USPHS90-1|&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] In a well ventilated place, the radon concentration tends to align with outdoor values (typically 10 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, ranging from 1 to 100 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).

Radon levels in indoor air can be lowered in several ways, from sealing cracks in floors and walls to increasing the ventilation rate of the building. Listed here are some of the accepted ways of reducing the amount of radon accumulating in a dwelling:[[Health effects of radon#cite note-WHO291-69|&lt;sup&gt;[69]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

·         Improving the ventilation of the dwelling and avoiding the transport of radon from the basement, or ground, into living areas;

·         Installing crawlspace or basement ventilation systems;

·         Installing sub-slab depressurization radon mitigation systems, which vacuum radon from under slab-on-grade foundations;

·         Installing sub-membrane depressurization radon mitigation systems, which vacuum radon from under a membrane that covers the ground used in crawlspace

foundations;

·         Installing a radon sump system in the basement;

·         Sealing floors and walls (not a stand-alone solution); and

·         Installing a positive pressurization or positive supply ventilation system.

The half-life for radon is 3.8 days, indicating that once the source is removed, the hazard will be greatly reduced within approximately one month (seven half-lives).

Positive-pressure ventilation systems can be combined with a heat exchanger to recover energy in the process of exchanging air with the outside, and simply exhausting basement air to the outside is not necessarily a viable solution as this can draw radon gas ''into'' a dwelling. Homes built on a [[Crawl space (basement)|crawl space]] may benefit from a radon collector installed under a "radon barrier, or membrane" (a sheet of plastic or laminated polyethylene film that covers the crawl space floor).

[[ASTM International|ASTM]] E-2121 is a standard for reducing radon in homes as far as practicable below 4 picocuries per liter (pCi/L) in indoor air.[[Health effects of radon#cite note-96|&lt;sup&gt;[96]&lt;/sup&gt;]][[Health effects of radon#cite note-97|&lt;sup&gt;[97]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

In the US, approximately 14 states have a state radon programs which train and license radon mitigation contractors and radon measurement professionals. To determine if your state licenses radon professionals contact your state health department. The National Environmental Health Association and the National Radon Safety Board administer voluntary National Radon Proficiency Programs for radon professionals consisting of individuals and companies wanting to take training courses and examinations to demonstrate their competency.[[Health effects of radon#cite note-98|&lt;sup&gt;[98]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Without the proper equipment or technical knowledge, radon levels can actually increase or create other potential hazards and additional costs.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;"Radon". United States Environmental Protection Agency. www.epa.gov/radon. Accessed on 10 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; A list of certified mitigation service providers is available through state radon offices, which are listed on the EPA website at www.epa.gov/radon/whereyoulive.html[[Health effects of radon#cite note-99|&lt;sup&gt;[99]&lt;/sup&gt;]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; [[Radon mitigation|Indoor radon can be mitigated]] by sealing basement foundations, water drainage, or by sub-slab, or sub-membrane depressurization. In many cases, mitigators can use PVC piping and specialized radon suction fans to exhaust sub-slab, or sub-membrane radon and other soil gases to the outside atmosphere. Most of these solutions for radon mitigation require maintenance, and it is important to continually replace any fans or filters as needed to continue proper functioning.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Since radon gas is found in most soil and rocks, it is not only able to move into the air, but also into underground water sources.&lt;ref&gt;"Radon and Cancer". American Cancer Socity, Inc. www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/radiation-exposure/radon.html. Accessed on 10 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Radon may be present in well water and can be released into the air in homes when water is used for showering and other household uses.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; If it is suspected that a private well or drinking water may be affected by radon, the National Radon Program Services Hotline at 1-800-SOS-RADON can be contacted for information regarding state radon office phone numbers. State radon offices can provide additional resources, such as local laboratories that can test water for radon.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

If it is determined that radon is present in a private well, installing either a point-of-use or point-of-entry solution may be necessary.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Point-of-use treatments are installed at the tap, and are only helpful in removing radon from drinking water. To address the more common problem of breathing in radon released from water used during showers and other household activities, a point-of-entry solution may be more reliable.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Point-of-entry systems usually involve a granular activated carbon filter, or an aeration system; both methods can help to remove radon before it enters the home’s water distribution system.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Aeration systems and granular activation carbon filters both have advantages and disadvantages, so it is recommended to contact state radon departments or a water treatment professional for specific recommendations.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Detractors===
The high cost of radon remediation in the 1980s led to detractors arguing that the issue is a financial [[boondoggle]] reminiscent of the [[1976 swine flu outbreak|swine flu scare of 1976]].&lt;ref name="87times"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/18/nyregion/new-jersey-opinion-bad-advice-about-the-problems-of-radon.html New Jersey Opinion; bad advice about the problems of radon], ''NY Times'', Leonard A. Cole, October 18, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; They further argued that the results of mitigation are inconsistent with lowered cancer risk, especially when indoor radon levels are in the lower range of the actionable exposure level.&lt;ref name="87times" /&gt;

A '''health system''', also sometimes referred to as '''health care system''' or as '''healthcare system''', is the [[organization]] of people, institutions, and resources that deliver [[health care]] services to meet the [[health]] needs of target populations.

There is a wide variety of health systems around the world, with as many histories and [[organizational structure]]s as there are nations. Implicitly, nations must design and develop health systems in accordance with their needs and resources, although common elements in virtually all health systems are [[primary healthcare]] and [[public health]] measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = White F | year = 2015 | title = Primary health care and public health: foundations of universal health systems | url = http://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/370197/| journal = Med Princ Pract | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 103–116 | doi = 10.1159/000370197 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, health system planning is distributed among [[market (economics)|market]] participants. In others, there is a concerted effort among [[government]]s, [[trade unions]], [[charities]], religious organizations, or other co-ordinated bodies to deliver planned health care services targeted to the populations they serve. However, health care planning has been described as often evolutionary rather than revolutionary.&lt;ref name="liverpool-ha.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpool-ha.org.uk/health-care-system.html |title=''Health care system'' |publisher=Liverpool-ha.org.uk |accessdate=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/01/26/090126fa_fact_gawande?currentPage=all ''New Yorker'' magazine article: "Getting there from here."] 26 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), the directing and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations system, is promoting a goal of [[universal health care]]: to ensure that all people obtain the health services they need without suffering financial hardship when paying for them. According to WHO, healthcare systems' goals are good health for the citizens, responsiveness to the expectations of the population, and fair means of funding operations. Progress towards them depends on how systems carry out four vital functions: [[health care provider|provision of health care services]], resource generation, financing, and stewardship.&lt;ref name="WHO2000"&gt;World Health Organization. (2000). ''World Health Report 2000 – Health systems: improving performance.'' Geneva, WHO http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Other dimensions for the evaluation of health systems include quality, efficiency, acceptability, and [[health equity|equity]].&lt;ref name="liverpool-ha.org.uk"/&gt; They have also been described in the United States as "the five C's": Cost, Coverage, Consistency, Complexity, and [[chronic disease|Chronic Illness]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.jhu.edu/president/speeches/2007/health.html Remarks by Johns Hopkins University President William Brody: "Health Care '08: What's Promised/What's Possible?"] 7 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[continuity of health care]] is a major goal.&lt;ref name=cook2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cook | first1 = R. I. | last2 = Render | first2 = M. | last3 = Woods | first3 = D. | doi = 10.1136/bmj.320.7237.791 | title = Gaps in the continuity of care and progress on patient safety | journal = BMJ | volume = 320 | issue = 7237 | pages = 791–794 | year = 2000 | pmid =  10720370| pmc =1117777 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Often '''health system''' has been defined with a reductionist perspective, for example reducing it to '''healthcare system'''. In many publications, for example, both expressions are used interchangeably. Some authors&lt;ref name="Frenk Global Health"&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2797599 | pmid=20069038 | doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000089 | volume=7 | title=The global health system: strengthening national health systems as the next step for global progress | year=2010 | journal=PLoS Med. | pages=e1000089 | author = Frenk J}}&lt;/ref&gt; have developed arguments to expand the concept of health systems, indicating additional dimensions that should be considered:
* Health systems should not be expressed in terms of their components only, but also of their interrelationships;
* Health systems should include not only the institutional or supply side of the health system, but also the population;
* Health systems must be seen in terms of their goals, which include not only health improvement, but also [[Health equity|equity]], responsiveness to legitimate expectations, respect of dignity, and fair financing, among others;
* Health systems must also be defined in terms of their functions, including the direct provision of services, whether they are medical or [[public health]] services, but also "other enabling functions, such as stewardship, financing, and resource generation, including what is probably the most complex of all challenges, the health workforce."&lt;ref name="Frenk Global Health"/&gt;

===World Health Organization definition===
The [[World Health Organization]] defines health systems as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A health system consists of all organizations, people and actions whose primary intent is to promote, restore or maintain health. This includes efforts to influence determinants of health as well as more direct health-improving activities. A health system is therefore more than the pyramid of publicly owned facilities that deliver personal health services. It includes, for example, a mother caring for a sick child at home; private providers; behaviour change programmes; vector-control campaigns; health insurance organizations; occupational health and safety legislation. It includes inter-sectoral action by health staff, for example, encouraging the ministry of education to promote female education, a well known determinant of better health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=WHO|year=2007|title=Everybody's business. Strengthening health systems to improve health outcomes : WHO's framework for action|url=http://www.who.int/healthsystems/strategy/everybodys_business.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Providers==
{{Main article|Health care provider}}
Healthcare providers are institutions or individuals providing healthcare services. Individuals including health professionals and [[allied health professions]] can be self-employed or working as an employee in a [[hospital]], [[clinic]], or other health care institution, whether government operated, private for-profit, or private not-for-profit (e.g. non-governmental organization). They may also work outside of direct patient care such as in a government [[health department]] or other agency, [[medical laboratory]], or health training institution. Examples of [[Health Human Resources|health workers]] are [[physician|doctors]], [[nursing|nurses]], [[midwifery|midwives]], [[dietetics|dietitians]], [[paramedic]]s, [[dentist]]s, [[medical laboratory technologist]]s, [[therapist]]s, [[psychologist]]s, [[pharmacist]]s, [[Chiropractic|chiropractors]], [[Optometry|optometrists]], [[community health worker]]s, traditional medicine practitioners, and others.

There are generally five primary methods of funding health systems:&lt;ref name="WHO2"&gt;[http://www.searo.who.int/EN/Section1243/Section1382/Section1731.htm "Regional Overview of Social Health Insurance in South-East Asia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224050244/http://www.searo.who.int/en/Section1243/Section1382/Section1731.htm |date=24 February 2007 }}, [[World Health Organization]].

# general [[taxation]] to the state, county or municipality
# [[national health insurance]]
# voluntary or private [[health insurance]]
# [[Out-of-pocket expenses|out-of-pocket payments]]
# [[donation]]s to [[charities]]

Most countries' systems feature a mix of all five models. One study&lt;ref&gt;[[Sherry Glied|Glied, Sherry A.]] [http://papers.nber.org/papers/w13881 "Health Care Financing, Efficiency, and Equity."] ''National Bureau of Economic Research'', March 2008. Accessed 20 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; based on data from the [[OECD]] concluded that all types of health care finance "are compatible with" an efficient health system. The study also found no relationship between financing and cost control.

The term health insurance is generally used to describe a form of [[insurance]] that pays for medical expenses. It is sometimes used more broadly to include insurance covering [[Disability insurance|disability]] or [[Long term care insurance|long-term nursing or custodial care]] needs. It may be provided through a [[social insurance]] program, or from private insurance companies. It may be obtained on a group basis (e.g., by a firm to cover its employees) or purchased by individual consumers. In each case premiums or taxes protect the insured from high or unexpected health care expenses.

By estimating the overall cost of health care expenses, a routine finance structure (such as a monthly premium or annual tax) can be developed, ensuring that money is available to pay for the health care benefits specified in the insurance agreement. The benefit is typically administered by a government agency, a non-profit health fund or a corporation operating seeking to make a profit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kff.org/insurance/upload/How-Private-Insurance-Works-A-Primer-Report.pdf How Private Insurance Works: A Primer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221100523/http://www.kff.org/insurance/upload/How-Private-Insurance-Works-A-Primer-Report.pdf |date=21 December 2008 }} by Gary Claxton, Institution for Health Care Research and Policy, Georgetown University, on behalf of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

Many forms of commercial health insurance control their costs by restricting the benefits that are paid by through [[deductible]]s, [[co-payment]]s, [[coinsurance]], policy exclusions, and total coverage limits and will severely restrict or refuse coverage of pre-existing conditions. Many government schemes also have co-payment schemes but exclusions are rare because of political pressure. The larger insurance schemes may also negotiate fees with providers.

Many forms of social insurance schemes control their costs by using the bargaining power of their community they represent to control costs in the health care delivery system. For example, by negotiating drug prices directly with pharmaceutical companies negotiating standard fees with the medical profession, or reducing [[unnecessary health care]] costs. Social schemes sometimes feature contributions related to earnings as part of a scheme to deliver [[universal health care]], which may or may not also involve the use of commercial and non-commercial insurers. Essentially the more wealthy pay proportionately more into the scheme to cover the needs of the relatively poor who therefore contribute proportionately less. There are usually caps on the contributions of the wealthy and minimum payments that must be made by the insured (often in the form of a minimum contribution, similar to a deductible in commercial insurance models).

In addition to these traditional health care financing methods, some lower income countries and development partners are also implementing non-traditional or [[innovative financing]] mechanisms for scaling up delivery and sustainability of health care,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bloom|first=G|title=Markets, Information Asymmetry And Health Care: Towards New Social Contracts|journal=Social Science and Medicine|year=2008|volume=66|issue=10|pages=2076–2087|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/markets-information-asymmetry-and-health-care-towards-new-so.html|accessdate=26 May 2012|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.01.034|pmid=18316147|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as micro-contributions, [[public-private partnership]]s, and market-based [[financial transaction tax]]es. For example, as of June 2011, [[UNITAID]] had collected more than one billion dollars from 29 member countries, including several from Africa, through an air ticket solidarity levy to expand access to care and treatment for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in 94 countries.&lt;ref name="UNITAID"&gt;UNITAID. [http://www.unitaid.eu/en/resources/news/347-republic-of-guinea-introduces-air-solidarity-levy-to-fight-aids-tb-and-malaria.html ''Republic of Guinea Introduces Air Solidarity Levy to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112114051/http://www.unitaid.eu/en/resources/news/347-republic-of-guinea-introduces-air-solidarity-levy-to-fight-aids-tb-and-malaria.html |date=12 November 2011 }} Geneva, 30 June 2011. Accessed 5 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Payment models===
In most countries, [[wage]] costs for healthcare practitioners are estimated to represent between 65% and 80% of renewable health system expenditures.&lt;ref&gt;Saltman RB, Von Otter C. ''Implementing Planned Markets in Health Care: Balancing Social and Economic Responsibility''. Buckingham: Open University Press 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kolehamainen-Aiken RL | year = 1997 | title = Decentralization and human resources: implications and impact | url = | journal = Human Resources for Health Development | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 1–14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three ways to pay medical practitioners: fee for service, capitation, and salary. There has been growing interest in blending elements of these systems.&lt;ref name="docteur/oxley"/&gt;

====Fee-for-service====
''[[Fee-for-service]] arrangements'' pay [[general practitioner]]s (GPs) based on the service.&lt;ref name="docteur/oxley"/&gt; They are even more
widely used for specialists working in [[ambulatory care]].&lt;ref name="docteur/oxley"/&gt;

There are two ways to set fee levels:&lt;ref name="docteur/oxley"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/5/53/22364122.pdf|title=Health-Care Systems: Lessons from the Reform Experience|publisher=OECD|author1=Elizabeth Docteur |author2=Howard Oxley |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* By individual practitioners.
* Central negotiations (as in Japan, Germany, Canada and in France) or hybrid model (such as in Australia, France's sector 2, and New Zealand) where GPs can charge extra fees on top of standardized patient reimbursement rates.

====Capitation====
In ''[[Capitation (healthcare)|capitation payment systems]]'', GPs are paid for each patient on their "list", usually with adjustments for factors such as age and gender.&lt;ref name="docteur/oxley"/&gt; According to OECD, "these systems are used in Italy (with some fees), in all four countries of the United Kingdom (with some fees and allowances for specific services), Austria (with fees for specific services), Denmark (one third of income with remainder fee for service), Ireland (since 1989), the Netherlands (fee-for-service for privately insured patients and public employees) and Sweden (from 1994). Capitation payments have become more frequent in "managed care" environments in the United States."&lt;ref name="docteur/oxley"/&gt;

According to OECD, "Capitation systems allow funders to control the overall level of primary health expenditures, and the allocation of funding among GPs is determined by patient registrations. However, under this approach, GPs may register too many patients and under-serve them, select the better risks and refer on patients who could have been treated by the GP directly. Freedom of consumer choice over doctors, coupled with the principle of "money following the patient" may moderate some of these risks. Aside from selection, these problems are likely to be less marked than under salary-type arrangements."&lt;ref name="docteur/oxley"/&gt;

====Salary arrangements====
In several OECD countries, general practitioners (GPs) are employed on ''[[salary|salaries]]'' for the government.&lt;ref name="docteur/oxley"/&gt; According to OECD, "Salary arrangements allow funders to control primary care costs directly; however, they may lead to under-provision of services (to ease workloads), excessive referrals to secondary providers and lack of attention to the preferences of patients."&lt;ref name="docteur/oxley"/&gt; There has been movement away from this system.&lt;ref name="docteur/oxley"/&gt;

==Information resources==
{{Main article|Health care delivery|Health information management|Health informatics|eHealth}}
Sound information plays an increasingly critical role in the delivery of modern health care and efficiency of health systems. Health informatics&amp;nbsp;– the intersection of [[information science]], [[medicine]] and [[healthcare]]&amp;nbsp;– deals with the resources, devices, and methods required to optimize the acquisition and use of information in health and biomedicine. Necessary tools for proper health information coding and management include [[Medical guideline|clinical guidelines]], formal [[Medical terminology|medical terminologies]], and computers and other [[Information and communications technology|information and communication technologies]]. The kinds of [[health data]] processed may include [[medical records|patients' medical records]], [[hospital information system|hospital administration and clinical functions]], and [[HRHIS|human resources information]].

The use of health information lies at the root of [[evidence-based policy]] and [[evidence-based management]] in health care. Increasingly, information and communication technologies are being utilised to improve health systems in developing countries through: the standardisation of health information; computer-aided diagnosis and treatment monitoring; informing population groups on health and treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lucas|first=H|title=Information And Communications Technology For Future Health Systems In Developing Countries|journal=Social Science and Medicine|year=2008|volume=66|issue=10|pages=2122–2132|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/information-and-communications-technology-for-future-health.html|accessdate=26 May 2012|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.01.033|pmid=18343005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
{{Main article|Health policy|Public health|Health administration|Disease management (health)}}
The management of any health system is typically directed through a set of [[health policy|policies and plans]] adopted by government, private sector business and other groups in areas such as personal healthcare delivery and financing, [[pharmaceutical policy|pharmaceuticals]], [[Health Human Resources|health human resources]], and [[public health]].

Public health is concerned with threats to the overall health of a community based on [[population health]] analysis. The population in question can be as small as a handful of people, or as large as all the inhabitants of several continents (for instance, in the case of a [[pandemic]]). Public health is typically divided into [[epidemiology]], [[biostatistics]] and [[health services]]. [[Environmental Health|Environmental]], social, [[behavioral health|behavioral]], and [[occupational health]] are also important subfields.

[[File:Poliodrops.jpg|right|thumb|A child being immunized against [[polio]].]]
Today, most governments recognize the importance of public health programs in reducing the incidence of disease, disability, the effects of ageing and [[health equity|health inequities]], although public health generally receives significantly less government funding compared with medicine. For example, most countries have a [[vaccination policy]], supporting public health programs in providing [[vaccination]]s to promote health. Vaccinations are voluntary in some countries and mandatory in some countries. Some governments pay all or part of the costs for vaccines in a national vaccination schedule.

The rapid emergence of many [[chronic disease]]s, which require costly [[chronic care management|long-term care and treatment]], is making many health managers and policy makers re-examine their healthcare delivery practices. An important health issue facing the world currently is [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euphix.org/object_class/euph_hiv_aids.html |title=European Union Public Health Information System – HIV/Aides page |publisher=[[EUPHIX|Euphix]].org |accessdate=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another major public health concern is [[diabetes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euphix.org/object_class/euph_diabetes.html |title=European Union Public Health Information System – Diabetes page |publisher=Euphix.org |accessdate=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, according to the World Health Organization, at least 171 million people worldwide suffered from diabetes. Its incidence is increasing rapidly, and it is estimated that by the year 2030, this number will double. A controversial aspect of public health is the control of [[tobacco smoking]], linked to cancer and other chronic illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euphix.org/object_class/euph_health_behaviours_smoking.html |title=European Union Public Health Information System – Smoking Behaviors page |publisher=Euphix.org |accessdate=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antibiotic resistance]] is another major concern, leading to the reemergence of diseases such as [[tuberculosis]]. The [[World Health Organization]], for its [[World Health Day|World Health Day 2011]] campaign, is calling for intensified global commitment to safeguard antibiotics and other [[antimicrobial]] medicines for future generations.

Since 2000, more and more initiatives have been taken at the international and national levels in order to strengthen national health systems as the core components of the [[global health]] system. Having this scope in mind, it is essential to have a clear, and unrestricted, vision of national health systems that might generate further progresses in global health. The elaboration and the selection of [[performance indicator]]s are indeed both highly dependent on the [[conceptual framework]] adopted for the [[evaluation]] of the health systems performances.&lt;ref&gt;Handler A, Issel M, Turnock B.

In response to a series of papers published in 2012 by members of the World Health Organization's Task Force on Developing Health Systems Guidance, researchers from the Future Health Systems consortium argue that there is insufficient focus on the 'policy implementation gap'. Recognizing the diversity of stakeholders and complexity of health systems is crucial to ensure that evidence-based guidelines are tested with requisite humility and without a rigid adherence to models dominated by a limited number of disciplines.&lt;ref name="Peters 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hyder|first=A|title=Exploring health systems research and its influence on policy processes in low income countries|journal=BMC Public Health|year=2007|volume=7|pages=309|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/exploring-health-systems-research-and-its-influence-on-polic.html|accessdate=26 May 2012|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-7-309|pmid=17974000|pmc=2213669|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Healthcare services often implement Quality Improvement Initiatives to overcome this policy implementation gap.

Health Policy and Systems Research (HPSR) is an emerging multidisciplinary field that challenges 'disciplinary capture' by dominant health research traditions, arguing that these traditions generate premature and inappropriately narrow definitions that impede rather than enhance health systems strengthening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sheikh|first=Kabir|author2=Lucy Gilson |author3=Irene Akua Agyepong |author4=Kara Hanson |author5=Freddie Ssengooba |author6=Sara Bennett |title=Building the Field of Health Policy and Systems Research: Framing the Questions|journal=PLoS Medicine|year=2011|volume=8|issue=8|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001073|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001073 |accessdate=22 May 2012|pages=e1001073|pmid=21857809|pmc=3156683}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; HPSR focuses on low- and middle-income countries and draws on the relativist social science paradigm which recognises that all phenomena are constructed through human behaviour and interpretation. In using this approach, HPSR offers insight into health systems by generating a complex understanding of context in order to enhance health policy learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilson|first=Lucy|author2=Kara Hanson |author3=Kabir Sheikh |author4=Irene Akua Agyepong |author5=Freddie Ssengooba |author6=Sara Bennet |title=Building the Field of Health Policy and Systems Research: Social Science Matters|journal=PLoS Medicine|year=2011|volume=8|issue=8|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001079|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001079 |pages=e1001079|pmid=21886488|pmc=3160340}}  {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; HPSR calls for greater involvement of local actors, including policy makers, civil society and researchers, in decisions that are made around funding health policy research and health systems strengthening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bennet|first=Sara|author2=Irene Akua Agyepong |author3=Kabir Sheikh |author4=Kara Hanson |author5=Freddie Ssengooba |author6=Lucy Gilson |title=Building the Field of Health Policy and Systems Research: An Agenda for Action|journal=PLoS Medicine |year=2011|volume=8|issue=8|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001081|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001081 |pages=e1001081 |pmid=21918641 |pmc=3168867}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Health systems can vary substantially from country to country, and in the last few years, comparisons have been made on an international basis. The [[World Health Organization]], in its ''[[World Health Report|World Health Report 2000]]'', provided a [[World Health Organization ranking of health systems|ranking of health systems]] around the world according to criteria of the overall level and distribution of [[health]] in the populations, and the responsiveness and fair financing of health care services.&lt;ref name="WHO2000"/&gt; The goals for health systems, according to the WHO's ''World Health Report 2000 – Health systems: improving performance'' (WHO, 2000),&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. (2000) [http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/ ''World Health Report 2000 – Health systems: improving performance'']. Geneva, WHO Press.&lt;/ref&gt; are good health, responsiveness to the expectations of the population, and fair financial contribution. There have been several debates around the results of this WHO exercise,&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/health-systems-performance/docs/overallframework_docs.htm ''Health Systems Performance: Overall Framework.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617053343/http://www.who.int/health-systems-performance/docs/overallframework_docs.htm |date=17 June 2012 }} Accessed 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and especially based on the country [[ranking]] linked to it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Navarro V | year = 2000 | title = Assessment of the World Health Report 2000 | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 356 | issue = | pages = 1598–601 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(00)03139-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; insofar as it appeared to depend mostly on the choice of the retained [[performance indicator|indicators]].

Direct comparisons of health statistics across nations are complex. The [[Commonwealth Fund]], in its annual survey, "Mirror, Mirror on the Wall", compares the performance of the health systems in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada and the United States Its 2007 study found that, although the United States system is the most expensive, it consistently underperforms compared to the other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Content/Publications/Fund-Reports/2007/May/Mirror--Mirror-on-the-Wall--An-International-Update-on-the-Comparative-Performance-of-American-Healt.aspx|title=Mirror, Mirror on the Wall: An International Update on the Comparative Performance of American Health Care|publisher=The Commonwealth Fund|date=15 May 2007|accessdate=7 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major difference between the United States and the other countries in the study is that the United States is the only country without [[universal health care]]. The [[OECD]] also collects comparative statistics, and has published brief country profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]| title=OECD Health Data 2008: How Does Canada Compare| publisher=| url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/46/33/38979719.pdf| format=PDF| accessdate=9 January 2009| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531222830/http://www.oecd.org/health/health-systems/BriefingNoteCANADA2012.pdf| archivedate=31 May 2013| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oecdstats"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/document/46/0,3343,en_2649_34631_34971438_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=Updated statistics from a 2009 report |publisher=Oecd.org |accessdate=6 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305122330/http://www.oecd.org/document/46/0,3343,en_2649_34631_34971438_1_1_1_1,00.html |archivedate=5 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="datasource"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/document/16/0,3343,en_2649_34631_2085200_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=OECD Health Data 2009 – Frequently Requested Data |publisher=Oecd.org |accessdate=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Health Consumer Powerhouse]] makes comparisons between both national health care systems in the [[Euro health consumer index]] and specific areas of health care such as diabetes

The '''International Hygiene Exhibition''' was a [[world's fair]] focusing on [[medicine]] and [[public health]], held in [[Dresden]], [[Germany]], in 1911.&lt;ref name=Vogel&gt;{{cite book | author = Klaus Vogel | chapter = The Transparent Man — Some comments on the history of a symbol | title = Manifesting Medicine | editor = Robert Bud | publisher = [[National Museum of Science and Industry]] | year = 2004 | pages = 36–38 | isbn = 1-900747-56-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leading figure organizing the exhibition was German philanthropist and businessman {{Interlanguage link multi|Karl August Lingner|de}}, who had grown wealthy from his [[Odol]] mouthwash brand, and was enthusiastic to educate the public about advances in public health. Lingner had previously organized a public-health exhibition as part of the 1903 Dresden municipal expo, and its success led him to plan a larger endeavor.&lt;ref name=Vogel /&gt;

The exhibition opened on May 6, 1911, with 30 countries participating, 100 buildings built for the event, and 5 million visitors over its duration. It emphasized accessible visual representations of the body, and a particular sensation were the transparent organs preserved and displayed according to a method devised by [[Werner Spalteholz]].&lt;ref name=Vogel /&gt;

Following the exhibition, its contents became the permanent [[German Hygiene Museum]] in Dresden. Its success spawned several follow-up expos, most notably the 1926 ''[[GeSoLei]]'' exhibition in [[Düsseldorf]].&lt;ref name=Vogel /&gt;

'''Kegel exercise''', also known as '''pelvic floor exercise''', consists of repeatedly contracting and relaxing the muscles that form part of the [[pelvic floor]], now sometimes colloquially referred to as the "Kegel muscles". The exercise can be performed multiple times each day, for several minutes at a time, for one to three months, to begin to have an effect.

Kegel exercises can make the pelvic floor muscles stronger. These are the muscles that hold up the bladder and help keep it from leaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/urologic-diseases/bladder-control-problems-women/kegel-exercises|title=Kegel Exercises {{!}} NIDDK|work=National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases|access-date=2017-12-02|language=en-US}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003975.htm|title=Pelvic floor muscle training exercises: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exercises are usually done to reduce [[Stress incontinence|urinary stress incontinence]] (especially after childbirth) and reduce [[premature ejaculation]] in men.&lt;ref name="autogenerated22"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Nicastro|first2=A|year=1996|title=A new treatment for premature ejaculation: the rehabilitation of the pelvic floor|journal=Journal of sex &amp; marital therapy|volume=22|issue=1|pages=22–6|doi=10.1080/00926239608405302|pmid=8699493|last1=La Pera|first1=G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Several tools exist to help with these exercises, although various studies debate the relative effectiveness of different tools versus traditional exercises.&lt;ref name="bjui.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bjui.org/ContentFullItem.aspx?id=427&amp;LinkTypeID=1&amp;SectionType=4 |title=A randomised controlled trial of the PelvicToner Device in female stress urinary incontinence |publisher=BJUI.org |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were first described in 1948 by American gynecologist [[Arnold Kegel]].

==Health effects==
Factors such as [[pregnancy]], [[childbirth]], aging, being [[overweight]], and abdominal surgery such as cesarean section, often result in the weakening of the pelvic muscles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/pelvic-floor|title=Pelvic floor|last=Services|first=Department of Health &amp; Human|access-date=2018-02-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be assessed by either digital examination of vaginal pressure or using a Kegel [[perineometer]]. Kegel exercises are useful in regaining pelvic floor muscle strength in such cases.

==Mechanism of action==
The aim of Kegel exercises is to improve [[muscle tone]] by strengthening the [[pubococcygeus muscle]]s of the [[pelvic floor]]. Kegel is a popular prescribed exercise for pregnant women to prepare the [[pelvic floor]] for physiological stresses of the later stages of [[pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]]. Kegel exercises are said to be good for treating [[vaginal prolapse]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=September 2, 2011 |url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/vaginal_prolapse/article_em.htm |title=Vaginal Prolapse |publisher=eMedicineHealth |date=2011-02-09 |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and preventing [[uterine prolapse]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001508.htm#Prevention |title=MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia: Uterine prolapse |publisher=Nlm.nih.gov |date=2011-08-29 |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; in women and for treating [[prostate]] pain and swelling resulting from [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]] (BPH) and [[prostatitis]] in men. Kegel exercises may be beneficial in treating [[urinary incontinence]] in both men and women.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003975.htm|title=MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia: Kegel exercises|date=2011-08-29|publisher=Nlm.nih.gov|accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kegel exercises may also increase sexual gratification, allowing women to complete [[pompoir]] and aid in reducing [[premature ejaculation]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated22"/&gt; in men. The many actions performed by Kegel muscles include holding in urine and avoiding defecation. Reproducing this type of muscle action can strengthen the Kegel muscles. The action of slowing or stopping the flow of urine may be used as a test of correct pelvic floor exercise technique.&lt;ref&gt;Kenway, M., and Goh, J. (2009). ''Inside Out: The Essential Women's Guide to Pelvic Support''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is now known that the components of levator ani (the pelvic diaphragm), namely pubococcygeus, puborectalis and ileococcygeus, contract and relax as one muscle. Hence, pelvic floor exercises involve the entire levator ani rather than pubococcygeus alone. Pelvic floor exercises may be of benefit in cases of [[fecal incontinence]] and pelvic organ prolapse conditions e.g. [[rectal prolapse]].&lt;ref name="Bø 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bø|first=K|title=Can pelvic floor muscle training prevent and treat pelvic organ prolapse?|journal=Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand|year=2006|volume=85|issue=3|pages=263–8|pmid=16553172|doi=10.1080/00016340500486800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pelvic toning devices==
[[Image:Kegel exerciser.JPG|thumb|A Kegel exerciser]]
Some devices have been marketed to women exercise their pelvic floor muscle and improve the muscle tone of the pubococcygeal or vaginal muscle.
[[File:Jade Eggs usually come in 3 different sizes.jpg|thumb|250px|Jade eggs (or Yoni eggs) have been marketed for use in vaginal weightlifting.]]
[[File:Ben Wa Balls.jpg|thumb|[[Ben wa balls]]]]

As of 2013 there was no evidence that doing pelvic floor exercise with weights worked better than doing Kegel exercises without weights; there is greater risk with weights, because a foreign object is introduced into the vagina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herbison|first1=GP|last2=Dean|first2=N|title=Weighted vaginal cones for urinary incontinence|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=8 July 2013|issue=7|pages=CD002114|pmid=23836411|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002114.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bjui.org" /&gt;

Inserting foreign objects into the vagina increases the risk of infections and can lead to [[vaginosis]] or [[toxic shock syndrome]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Overuse of such Kegel exercises, with or without a device, can lead to pelvic pain and pain during sex.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://drjengunter.wordpress.com/2017/01/17/dear-gwyneth-paltrow-im-a-gyn-and-your-vaginal-jade-eggs-are-a-bad-idea/|title=Dear Gwyneth Paltrow, I’m a GYN and your vaginal jade eggs are a bad idea|last=Gunter|first=Jen|date=2017-01-17|website=Dr. Jen Gunter|access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marketing===
During the latter part of the 20th century, a number of medical and pseudo-medical devices were marketed to consumers as improving sex or orgasms, increasing "[[Energy (esotericism)|energy]]", "balancing hormones", and as having other health or lifestyle benefits. There  is no evidence for any of these claims, and many of them are pseudoscience.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="skeptical"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tuteur |first1=Amy |title=Vaginal weight lifting |url=http://www.skepticalob.com/2008/12/vaginal-weight-lifting.html |work=The Skeptical OB |date=18 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref nam°e=":1"&gt;{{cite news|title=No, Gwyneth Paltrow, women should not put jade eggs in their vaginas, gynecologist says|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/01/22/no-gwyneth-paltrow-women-should-not-put-jade-eggs-in-their-vaginas-gynecologist-says/|accessdate=6 February 2017|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''mature minor doctrine''' is an American term for the [[statutory]], [[regulatory]], or [[common law]] policy accepting that an [[emancipated minor|unemancipated minor]] [[patient]] may possess the [[maturity (psychological)|maturity]] to choose or reject a particular [[health care]] [[Therapy|treatment]], sometimes without the knowledge or agreement of parents, and should be permitted to do so.&lt;ref&gt;''West's encyclopedia of American law'', Volume 8, West Publishing, 1998, page 47&lt;/ref&gt; It is now generally considered a form of patients [[rights]]; formerly, the '''mature minor rule''' was largely seen as protecting [[health care providers]] from [[criminal]] and civil [[cause of action|claims]] by parents of minors at least 15.&lt;ref&gt;''Legal issues in pediatrics and adolescent medicine'' by Angela Roddey Holder, Yale University Press, 1985, page 133&lt;/ref&gt;

Jurisdictions may [[codification (law)|codify]] an age of medical consent, accept the judgment of [[licensure|licensed]] providers regarding an individual minor, or accept a formal [[court decision]] following a request that a patient be designated a mature minor, or may rely on some combination. For example, patients at least 16 may be assumed to be mature minors for this purpose,&lt;ref&gt;"Definitions", ''USLegal.com'', [http://definitions.uslegal.com/m/mature-minor-doctrine/ Retrieved 2011-05-16], "Mature minor doctrine is a legal principle which... has been consistently applied in cases where the minor is sixteen years or older"&lt;/ref&gt; patients aged 13 to 15 may be designated so by licensed providers, and pre-teen patients may be so-designated after evaluation by an [[Government agency|agency]] or [[court]]. The mature minor doctrine is sometimes connected with enforcing [[Confidentiality#Medical confidentiality|confidentiality]] of minor patients from their parents.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mature Minor Rule: Teens and patient confidentiality'', Public Health - Seattle &amp; King County, [http://www.kingcounty.gov/healthservices/health/personal/famplan/providers/matureminor.aspx Retrieved 2011-05-13]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statute==
In the United States, a typical statute lists: ''"Who may consent [or withhold consent for] surgical or medical treatment or procedures."''
:"...Any unemancipated minor of sufficient intelligence to understand and appreciate the consequences of the proposed surgical or medical treatment or procedures, for himself."&lt;ref&gt;''Mississippi Code'', [http://www.mscode.com/free/statutes/41/041/0003.htm Retrieved 2011-05-13] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720125628/http://www.mscode.com/free/statutes/41/041/0003.htm |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''2010 Arkansas Code'', [http://law.justia.com/codes/arkansas/2010/title-20/subtitle-2/chapter-9/subchapter-6/20-9-602/ Retrieved 2011-05-13]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical emancipation==
{{See also|Emancipation of minors}}
By definition, a "mature minor" has been found to have the [[Capacity (law)|capacity]] to make serious medical decisions alone. By contrast, "medical emancipation" formally releases children from some parental involvement requirements but does not necessarily grant that decision making to children themselves. Pursuant to statute, several jurisdictions grant medical emancipation to a minor who has become [[pregnant]] or requires [[reproductive health|sexual-health]] services, thereby permitting medical treatment without parental consent and, often, confidentiality from parents. A limited [[legal guardian|guardianship]] may be appointed to make medical decisions for the medically emancipated minor and the minor may not be permitted to refuse or even choose treatment.&lt;ref&gt;''Children and the Law'' by Douglas E. Abrams and Sarah H. Ramsey, West Group, 2003, page 769&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
One early U.S. case of significance, [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10967297783373086168&amp;q=431+P.2d+719.&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,31 ''Smith v. Seibly''], 72 Wn.2d 16, 431 [[Pacific Reporter|P.2d]] 719 (1967), before the [[Washington Supreme Court]], establishes precedent on the mature minor doctrine. The plaintiff, Albert G. Smith, an 18-year-old married father, was suffering from [[myasthenia gravis]], a progressive disease. Because of this, Smith expressed concern that his wife might become burdened in caring for him for their existing child  and possibly for additional children. On March 9, 1961, while still 18, Smith requested a [[vasectomy]]. His doctor required [[Informed consent|written consent]], which Smith provided, and the [[surgery]] was performed. Later, after reaching Washington's statutory [[age of majority]], then 21, the doctor was sued by Smith, who now claimed that he had been a minor and thus unable to grant surgical or medical consent. The Court rejected Smith's argument: "Thus, age, intelligence, maturity, training, experience, economic independence or lack thereof, general conduct as an adult and freedom from the control of parents are all factors to be considered in such a case [involving consent to surgery]."

The court further quoted another recently decided case, [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18043554202269328547&amp;q=422+P.2d+812&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,31 ''Grannum v. Berard''], 70 Wn.2d 304, 307, 422 [[Pacific Reporter|P.2d]] 812 (1967): "The mental capacity necessary to consent to a surgical operation is a question of fact to be determined from the circumstances of each individual case." The court explicitly stated that a minor may grant surgical consent even without formal emancipation.

Especially since the 1970s, older pediatric patients sought to make autonomous decisions regarding their own treatment and sometimes sued successfully to do so.&lt;ref&gt;"Affirming the Decisions Adolescents Make about Life and Death" by Robert F. Weir and Charles Peters, ''Hastings Center Report'', Vol 27 No. 6, November–December 1997, Hastings Center, page 29&lt;/ref&gt; The decades of accumulated evidence tended to demonstrate that children are capable of participating in medical decision-making in a meaningful way;&lt;ref&gt;"Ethical problems in pediatric critical care: Consent" by Christine A. Zawistowski and Joel E. Frader, ''Critical Care Medicine'', Vol 31 Issue 5, May 2003, page S407-S410&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Mature Minors Should Have the Right to Refuse Life-Sustaining Medical Treatment" by Melinda T. Derish and Kathleen Vanden Heuvel, ''The Journal of Law Medicine and Ethics'', Vol 28 Issue 2, June 2000, pages 109-124&lt;/ref&gt; and legal and medical communities have demonstrated an increasing willingness of formally affirming decisions made by young people, even regarding life and death.&lt;ref&gt;"Children's Competence to Participate in Healthcare Decisions" by Susan M. Beidler and Susan B. Dickey, ''JONA's Healthcare Law Ethics and Regulation'', Vol 3 Issue 3, September 2001, page 80-87&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious beliefs have repeatedly influenced a patient's decision to choose treatment or not. In a case in 1989 in Illinois, [https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/01/you-must-be-this-old-to-die/384303/ a 17 year old female Jehovah's Witness] was permitted to refuse necessary life saving treatments.

In 1990, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Patient Self-Determination Act]]; even though key provisions apply only to patients over age 18,&lt;ref&gt;''The Patient Self-Determination Act: An Early Look at Implementation'' by Mathy Mezey and Beth Latimer, ''Hastings Center Report'', January–February 1993, page 16&lt;/ref&gt; the legislation advanced patient involvement in decisionmaking. The [[West Virginia Supreme Court]], in [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14842078072813819970&amp;q=422+SE2d+827&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,31 ''Belcher v. Charleston Area Medical Center''], 422 [[South Eastern Reporter|S.E.2d]] 827, 188 W.Va. 105 (1992), defined a "mature minor" exception to [[parental consent]], according consideration to seven factors to be weighed regarding such a minor: age, ability, experience, education, exhibited judgment, conduct, and appreciation of relevant risks and consequences.&lt;ref&gt;"Mature Minors and Emancipated Minors", Health Sciences Center, West Virginia University, [http://www.wvendoflife.org/MediaLibraries/WVCEOLC/Media/laws/Minors.pdf Retrieved 2011-08-04] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226055543/http://www.wvendoflife.org/MediaLibraries/WVCEOLC/Media/laws/Minors.pdf |date=2011-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Withholding of consent==
{{See also|Informed refusal}}

===United States===
In the United States, [[bodily integrity]] has long been considered a [[Natural and legal rights|common law right]]; the United States Supreme Court, in 1891's ''[[Union Pacific Railway Company v. Botsford]]'', found, "No right is held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded, by the common law, than the right of every individual to the possession and control of his own person, free from all restraint or interference of others, unless by clear and unquestionable [[Rational-legal authority|authority of law]]." The Supreme Court in 1990 (''[[Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health]]'') allowed that "constitutionally protected [[Claim rights and liberty rights|liberty interest]] in refusing unwanted medical treatment may be inferred" in the ''[[Due process#The U.S. Constitution|Due Process]] Clause'' of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Due Process Clause|Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], but the Court refrained from explicitly establishing what would have been a newly enumerated right. Nevertheless, lower courts have increasingly held that competent patients have the right to refuse any treatment for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;"Towards the right to be killed?" by Trudo Lemmens, ''British Medical Bulletin'', Vol 52 No. 2, British Council, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the [[Supreme Court of Illinois]] interpreted the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] to have already adopted major aspects of mature minor doctrine, concluding,
:Although the United States Supreme Court has not broadened this constitutional right of minors beyond [[Abortion in the United States|abortion cases]], the [Illinois] [[appellate court]] found such an extension "inevitable." ...Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has not held that a [[Constitutional right|constitutionally based right]] to [[Informed refusal|refuse medical treatment]] exists, either for adults or minors. ...[U.S. Supreme Court] cases do show, however, that no "[[bright line]]" age restriction of 18 is tenable in restricting the rights of mature minors, [thus] mature minors may possess and exercise rights regarding medical care... If the evidence is clear and convincing that the minor is mature enough to appreciate the consequences of her actions, and that the minor is mature enough to exercise the judgment of an adult, then the mature minor doctrine affords her the common law right to consent to or refuse medical treatment [including life and death cases, with some considerations].&lt;ref&gt;''In re E.G.'', 549 [[North Eastern Reporter|N.E.2d]] 322, 133 Ill. 2d 98, Supreme Court of Illinois, November 13, 1989, [http://il.findacase.com/research/wfrmDocViewer.aspx/xq/fac.19891113_0001777.IL.htm/qx Retrieved 2011-05-16]&lt;/ref&gt;

An ongoing case of Z.M is being heard in Maryland regarding the minor's right to refuse chemotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.courts.state.md.us/cosappeals/pdfs/201610schedule.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In Connecticut, Cassandra C. a seventeen year old was ordered by the Connecticut Supreme Court to receive treatment. The court decided that Cassandra was not mature enough to make medical decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://campbelllawobserver.com/the-choice-is-not-always-yours-a-minors-right-to-make-medical-decisions/|title=The Choice is Not Always Yours: A Minor’s Right to Make Medical Decisions|newspaper=Campbell Law Observer|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In 2009, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruling in ''[[A.C. v. Manitoba (Director of Child and Family Services)|A.C. v. Manitoba]]''&lt;!-- This article will be added; please do not "fix" redlink.---&gt; [2009] SCC 30 (CanLII) found that children ''may'' make life and death decisions about their medical treatment. In the majority opinion, [[Puisne Justice|Justice]] [[Rosalie Abella]] wrote:
:"The result of this [decision] is that young people under 16 will have the right to demonstrate mature medical decisional capacity. ...If, after a careful analysis of the young person’s ability to exercise mature and independent judgment, the court is persuaded that the necessary level of maturity exists, the young person’s views ought to be respected."
A "dissenting"&lt;ref&gt;That is, dissenting to the disposition of this specific case rather than the larger point of law&lt;/ref&gt; opinion by Justice [[Ian Binnie]] would have gone further:
:"At common law, proof of capacity entitles the “mature minor” to exercise personal autonomy in making medical treatment decisions free of parental or judicial control. ...[A] young person with capacity is entitled to make the treatment decision, not just to have ‘input’ into a [[judge]]’s consideration of what the judge believes to be the young person’s best interests."&lt;ref&gt;"A.C. v. Manitoba (Director of Child and Family Services)", Supreme Court of Canada, June 26, 2009, Docket 31955, [http://www.lewisday.ca/ldlf_files/pdf/AC.pdf Retrieved 2011-05-16]&lt;/ref&gt;
Analysts note that the Canadian decision merely requires that younger patients be permitted a ''[[Hearing (law)|hearing]]'', and still allows a judge to "decide whether or not to order a medical procedure on an unwilling minor".&lt;ref&gt;"Charter Offers No Protection from Forced Blood Transfusion for Young Jehovah’s Witness" by Jim Young, Center for Constitutional Studies, July 2, 2009, [http://www.law.ualberta.ca/centres/ccs/news/?id=313 Retrieved 2011-05-16]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8385">'''MedInfo'''  is the name of the [[international]] [[medical informatics]] [[Academic conference|conference]] organized initially every 3 years and now every other year by the [[International Medical Informatics Association]]. It is the most important international conference in the field with 3000+ health and medical informatics professions attending from all over the world. MedInfo also serves to bring together all officers of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Board together with national representatives in the General Assembly of IMIA.

The General Assembly elects the officers of IMIA. The IMIA Board consists of the President (the Past or the Elect President), Treasurer and Secretary as its officers. In addition it has other Vice Presidents for targeted areas: Membership, MedInfo, Services, Special Affairs, Strategic Plan Implementation, and Working Groups. With the exception of the President and the Vice President of MedInfo all officers serve a three-year term that can be extended for a second three-year term.  The President is on a 5-year cycle and the Vice President of MedInfo has one 3-year cycle and elected the year before the next Medinfo meeting so that he/she can be mentored through one MedInfo cycle.

== MedInfo conferences ==
MedInfo was held every 3 years since its inception in 1974, after 2013 it is now held every two years.  The table below gives an overview of these conferences.

The post is held by a [[physician]] who serves to advise and lead a team of public health professionals such as [[environmental health officer]]s and [[public health nurse]]s on matters of [[public health]] importance.

The equivalent senior health official at the national level is often referred to as the [[Chief Medical Officer]], although the title varies across countries, for example known as the [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] in the United States and the [[Chief Public Health Officer of Canada|Chief Public Health Officer]] in Canada.

In Canada, all communities are under the jurisdiction of an MOH. The roles of the MOH vary across jurisdictions, but always include responsibilities related to public health and safety, and may include the following functions:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fniah-spnia/pubs/finance/_agree-accord/initiative_transfer/index-eng.php ''Role of the Medical Officer of Health.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101030321/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fniah-spnia/pubs/finance/_agree-accord/initiative_transfer/index-eng.php |date=2012-01-01 }} Health Canada, accessed 16 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{expand section|date=November 2015}}
Health officers in India are expected to have prescribed qualifications, such as a Bachelor of Sanitary Science (B.S.Sc.), a degree of an institution recognized by the [[Medical Council of India]] or a diploma in Public Health after a 2-year study at the [[University of Calcutta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notification No:22/2014 Health Officer in the Tamil Nadu Public Health Service, 2013-2014|url=http://www.tnpsc.gov.in/notifications/22_2014_not_eng_Health_Officer.pdf|publisher=TAMIL NADU PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION|accessdate=8 November 2015|pages=14|format=pdf|date=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the municipal position was an elected head of the [[local board of health]], however the term MOH has also been used to refer to the [[Chief Medical Officer (United Kingdom)|Chief Medical Officer]]. Under the [[Metropolis Local Management Act 1855]], London municipalities were each required to appoint a medical officer. In 1856, 48 officers took up appointments in the city,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Epidemic Streets: Infectious Disease and the Rise of Preventive Medicine | page = 4 | author = Anne Hardy | year = 1993 | isbn = 0-19-820377-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and these specialists formed [[Metropolitan Association of Medical Officers of Health]].

'''Medical nutrition therapy''' ('''MNT''') is a [[therapy|therapeutic]] approach to treating medical conditions and their associated [[symptom]]s via the use of a specifically tailored [[Dieting|diet]] devised and monitored by a medical doctor [[physician]] or registered [[dietitian]] nutritionist (RDN).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jARn54eCUqoC|title=Advanced Medical Nutrition Therapy Practice|last=Skipper|first=Annalynn|date=2009-10-07|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|page=50|isbn=9780763742898|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diet is based upon the patient's medical record, physical examination, functional examination and dietary history.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The role of MNT when administered by a [[physician]] or dietitian nutritionist (RDN) is to reduce the risk of developing complications in pre-existing conditions such as [[type 2 diabetes]] as well as ameliorate the effects any existing conditions such as high cholesterol.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Many medical conditions either develop or are made worse by an improper or unhealthy diet.&lt;ref&gt;Sikand G, Kashyap ML, Yang I Medical nutrition therapy lowers serum cholesterol and saves medication costs in men with hypercholesterolemia.J Am Diet Assoc. 1998 Aug;98(8):889-94; quiz 895-6.{{PMID|9710659}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Copperman N, Jacobson MS.

Medical nutrition prevention and medical nutrition therapy of lipid metabolism disorder Med Pregl 62 Suppl 3():95-100 (2009) {{PMID|19702125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example is the use of [[macronutrient preload]] in type 2 diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;Li C, Norstedt G, Hu ZG, Yu P, Li DQ, Li J, Yu Q, Sederholm M, Yu DM. Effects of a macronutrient preload on type 2 diabetic patients, Frontiers in Endocrinology 6:139, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=Sara F.|last2=Wylie-Rosett|first2=Judith|date=2010-01-01|title=Medical Nutrition Therapy: A Key to Diabetes Management and Prevention|url=http://clinical.diabetesjournals.org/content/28/1/12|journal=Clinical Diabetes|language=en|volume=28|issue=1|pages=12–18|doi=10.2337/diaclin.28.1.12|issn=0891-8929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
"Medical nutrition therapy" (MNT) is the use of specific nutrition services to treat an illness, injury, or condition.&lt;ref name="ER"&gt;{{cite news | last =| first = | title =RDNs and Medical Nutrition Therapy Services | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''eatright.org''| date =12 June 2014 | url =http://www.eatright.org/resource/food/resources/learn-more-about-rdns/rdns-and-medical-nutrition-therapy-services | accessdate =3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was introduced in 1994 by the American Dietetic Association to better articulate the nutrition therapy process.  It involves the assessment of the nutritional status of the client and  the actual treatment, which includes nutrition therapy, counseling, and the use of specialized nutrition supplements.&lt;ref name="ER"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CDJ"&gt;{{cite news | last =Sara F. | first =Morris, et all | title =Medical Nutrition Therapy: A Key to Diabetes Management and Prevention | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''clinical.diabetesjournals.org''| date = | url =http://clinical.diabetesjournals.org/content/28/1/12.full | accessdate =3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Registered dietitians started using MNT as a dietary intervention for  preventing or treating other health conditions that are caused by or made worse by unhealthy eating habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =  | first =  | title =Medical Nutrition Therapy: Definition &amp; Uses | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''study.com''| date = | url =http://study.com/academy/lesson/medical-nutrition-therapy-definition-uses.html | accessdate =3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, '''Medical nutrition''' is a broader term describing nutrition in a medical context.

==Dietary needs and disease processes==
Normally, individuals obtain the necessary nutrients their bodies require through normal daily diets that process the foods accordingly within the body. Nevertheless, there are circumstances such as disease, distress, stress, and so on that may prevent the body from obtaining sufficient nutrients through diets alone. In such conditions, a dietary supplementation specifically formulated for their individual condition may be required to fill the void created by the specific condition. This can come in form of Medical Nutrition.&lt;ref name="NC"&gt;{{cite news | last =| first = | title =What is Medical Nutrition? | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''nutritioncollege.org''| date = | url =http://www.nutritioncollege.org/medicalnutrition | accessdate =3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administration==
In most cases the use of Medical Nutrition is recommended within international and professional guidelines.&lt;ref name="NC"/&gt; It can be an integral part of managing acute and short-term diseases. It can also play a major role in supporting patients for extended periods of time and even for a lifetime in some special cases.&lt;ref name="NC"/&gt; Medical Nutrition is not meant to replace the treatment of disease but rather complement the normal use of  drug therapies prescribed by physicians and other licensed healthcare providers.&lt;ref name="NC"/&gt;

Unlike Medical Foods which are defined by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]]' [[Food and Drug Administration]], {within their 'Medical Foods Guidance Documents &amp; Regulatory Information' guide in section 5(b) of the Orphan Drug Act (21 U.S.C. 30ee (b) (3))}; as “a food which is formulated to be consumed or administered enterally under the supervision of a physician and which is intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements, based on recognized scientific principles, are established by medical evaluation,”&lt;ref name="FDA"&gt;{{cite news | last =  | first =  | title =Draft Guidance for Industry: Frequently Asked Questions About Medical Foods; Second Edition | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''fda.gov''| date = | url =http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/MedicalFoods/ucm054048.htm | accessdate =3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14426">In 1767, the 11-year-old composer [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] was struck by [[smallpox]]. Like all smallpox victims, he was at serious risk of dying, but he survived the disease. This article discusses smallpox as it existed in Mozart's time, the decision taken in 1764 by Mozart's father [[Leopold Mozart|Leopold]] not to inoculate his children against the disease, the course of Mozart's illness, and the aftermath.

==Smallpox in Mozart's day==
{{Main|Smallpox|History of smallpox}}
Smallpox in 18th-century Europe was a devastating disease, recurring in frequent epidemics and killing or disfiguring millions of people. The 18th century was probably a particularly terrible time for smallpox in Europe: urbanization had increased crowding, making it easier for the disease to spread;&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins (2002, 62)&lt;/ref&gt; yet effective protection from smallpox through a [[smallpox vaccine]] was discovered only at the end of the century (see below).

The disease was a terrible one for its victims. Ian and Jenifer Glynn write:
&lt;blockquote&gt;So what was it like? As children, we were told it was like [[chickenpox]] but worse. In fact it is not related to chickenpox, and it was unimaginably worse. In an unvaccinated population, something like 10–30 percent of all patients with smallpox would be expected to die. And dying was not easy; smallpox was, as [[Thomas Macaulay|Macaulay]] wrote, 'the most terrible of all the ministers of death.'&lt;ref&gt;Glynn and Glynn (2008, 2)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Those who survived smallpox did not always survive intact; it frequently inflicted blindness on its survivors. The survival rate was particularly low for children.

The physical appearance of the disease was frightening to patients and to their caretakers: the patient's skin became covered with large, bulging pustules, which often left conspicuous pitting on the skin of patients who survived the disease.

==Leopold's decision against inoculation==
Medicine had made only slight progress against the disease in Mozart's time. Around the second decade of the 18th century&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell (1998, 70)&lt;/ref&gt; the method of [[inoculation]], which had originated in Asia, reached European countries. Inoculation was not the same as the [[vaccination]] which later succeeded in eradicating the disease; rather, an inoculated person was treated with live smallpox virus, taken from pustules of the mildest variety of smallpox that could be found.

Inoculation offered immunity to smallpox, but the procedure carried a definite risk that the inoculated person could die from smallpox as a result. Thus, many parents felt that they would rather do nothing, risking future smallpox arriving at random, rather than carry out a deliberate act that might well kill their children immediately.&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell (1998, 71–72)&lt;/ref&gt;

As Mozart biographer [[Ruth Halliwell]] points out, it is in this context that we must interpret a letter sent by Leopold Mozart on 22 February 1764 to his landlord and friend [[Lorenz Hagenauer]] concerning smallpox:
&lt;blockquote&gt;They are trying to persuade me to let my boy be inoculated with smallpox. But as I have expressed sufficiently clearly my aversion to this impertinence they are leaving me in peace. Here inoculation is the general fashion. But for my part I leave the matter to the grace of God. It depends on His grace whether He wishes to keep this prodigy of nature in this world in which He placed it or to take it to Himself.&lt;ref&gt;Translation from Jenkins (1995, 410), who cites Anderson (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From the modern perspective—with most children now made safe from several terrible diseases by vaccination—it is easy to make the superficial interpretation that Leopold was acting foolishly, relying on divine will when direct action was available that would have helped his children. However, since in Leopold's day it was not firmly established that inoculation was beneficial,&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins (2002, 62) observes that inoculation was a very controversial practice in Paris at the very time of the Mozarts' visit. The visiting Italian physician Angelo Gatti noted in 1761 that in Paris there were "more brochures for and against inoculation than inoculations."&lt;/ref&gt; his remarks can be seen to be more of appeal to religion to resolve what must have seemed an impossible dilemma.&lt;ref&gt;The primary source for this section is Halliwell (1998, 70–72), which discusses Leopold's dilemma in greater detail.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mozart's case of smallpox==
The Mozart family (Wolfgang, his father Leopold, his mother [[Anna Maria Mozart|Anna Maria]], and his older sister [[Maria Anna Mozart|Nannerl]]) left their home in [[Salzburg]] for [[Vienna]] on 11 September, 1767.&lt;ref name=H120&gt;Halliwell (1998, 120)&lt;/ref&gt; They had been there before, exhibiting the children's talents, in 1762;&lt;ref&gt;Solomon (1995, 40–42)&lt;/ref&gt; by this time they had completed their "[[Mozart family grand tour|Grand Tour]]" of Europe, performing in England, France, and elsewhere, and hoped to achieve even greater recognition (and income) in the Imperial capital. The forthcoming marriage of the 16-year-old [[Archduchess Maria Josepha]], daughter of Empress [[Maria Theresa]], scheduled for October 14, promised many festivities and thus opportunities for visiting musicians.&lt;ref name=H120 /&gt;

[[File:Martin van Meytens 002.jpg|thumb|Archduchess Maria Josepha of Austria]]Unfortunately, there was an outbreak of smallpox in Vienna at the time. On 28 May of that year, Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] had lost his second wife [[Maria Josepha of Bavaria|Maria Josepha]] to the disease, and his mother Maria Theresa also caught it (she survived).&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell (1998, 122)&lt;/ref&gt; The imperial bride-to-be Maria Josepha caught the disease in October and died of it on the 15th, the day after she had been scheduled to be married.&lt;ref name=H120 /&gt;

The Mozarts were renting rooms in the home of the goldsmith Johann Schmalecker,&lt;ref&gt;The address was at #3 Weihburggasse; the building no longer exists. Source: Deutsch (1965, 77).&lt;/ref&gt; and were horrified when all three of Schmalecker's children came down with smallpox.&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell (1998, 123)&lt;/ref&gt; Alarmed, Leopold first left Schmalacker's house, taking Wolfgang (only) with him (17 October).&lt;ref&gt;The implication that Leopold valued Wolfgang's survival over Nannerl's is not necessarily correct; according to Sadie and Zaslaw (2006, 132), the parents "suspected, wrongly, that Nannerl had already had smallpox as a child and so was in less danger"; see also Halliwell (1998, 125)&lt;/ref&gt; Six days later (23 October), the entire family fled the city.&lt;ref name=H120 /&gt;

They headed north, into what today is the [[Czech Republic]], first reaching [[Brno]] (then called by its German name, Brünn), where they called on the Count Franz Anton Schrattenbach, brother of Leopold's employer in Salzburg, the Prince-Archbishop [[Sigismund von Schrattenbach]]. Count Schrattenbach invited them to give a concert, but Leopold, impelled by an "inner urge," wanted to go farther, and the family continued northward after two days&lt;ref name=D77&gt;Deutsch (1965, 77)&lt;/ref&gt; to Olmütz (today [[Olomouc]]). It was there that, on 26 October, Wolfgang showed the first symptoms of smallpox. Given the incubation period of the disease (roughly, 12 days), it can be ascertained that he had already caught it in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins (2002, 63)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Source for this paragraph except where indicated: Halliwell (1998, 124)&lt;/ref&gt;

Leopold consulted an acquaintance, Count Leopold Anton Podstatsky, who was dean of the Cathedral and rector of the [[Palacký University of Olomouc|University in Olmütz]].&lt;ref name=D77 /&gt; Leopold had known Podstatsky when the Count had previously worked in Salzburg. The count, learning that Wolfgang was showing symptoms of smallpox, insisted that the Mozarts move into his home, and he placed Mozart under the excellent care of his personal physician, Dr. Joseph Wolff.&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell (1998, 124–125); Deutsch (1965, 77)&lt;/ref&gt;

Leopold later wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Wolfgang was complaining of his eyes. I noticed his head was warm, that his cheeks were hot and very red, but that his hands were cold as ice. Moreover, his pulse was not right. So we gave him some black powder&lt;ref&gt;"The black powders were ''pulvis epilecticus niger''; they had the effect of reducing fever, and were a staple of the Mozarts' medicine chest"; Halliwell (1998, 294).&lt;/ref&gt; and put him to bed. During the night he was rather restless and in the morning he still had the dry fever.&lt;ref&gt;Letter of 10 November, 1767; quoted from Solomon (1995, 70).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A frightening symptom of Wolfgang's illness, not made explicit in Leopold's letter, was an inability to see. In a letter written much later (1800), his sister Nannerl reported:
&lt;blockquote&gt;He caught the smallpox, which made him so ill that he could see nothing for nine days and had to spare his eyes for several weeks after his recovery.&lt;ref name=S70&gt;Quoted from Solomon (1995, 70)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although blindness was indeed a common result of smallpox, ophthalmologist Richard H. C. Zegers suggests that Mozart's symptoms did not represent actual blindness, but rather resulted from the pustular rash of the disease affecting his eyelids.&lt;ref&gt;Zegers (2007, 372)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 10 November, Wolfgang was feeling better, but then Nannerl also contracted smallpox, and was ill for three weeks.&lt;ref name=S70 /&gt; The Mozart children were thereafter safe from the disease, which confers immunity on its survivors. According to Leopold, both children were pitted in the locations of the former pustules, but neither seriously.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins (2002, 63), Gutman (2000, 233)&lt;/ref&gt;

During his recovery, Wolfgang, who needed to spare his eyes, spent the time learning card tricks and [[fencing]].&lt;ref&gt;Gutman (2000, 233)&lt;/ref&gt;

With both children's illness to contend with, the Mozarts spent a total of four months away from Vienna.&lt;ref name=S70 /&gt; They eventually returned there and were received in the Imperial court on 19 January, 1768. The Empress, who had by now lost three children to smallpox, conversed with Frau Mozart about the disease.

The remainder of the trip was not especially successful.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion, see Solomon (1995, 73–74)&lt;/ref&gt; Leopold apparently misinterpreted a chance remark of the Emperor as a firm invitation for Wolfgang to compose an opera; this resulted in Wolfgang writing ''[[La finta semplice]]''. However, the opera went unperformed in Vienna; the singers and musicians did not like it, and intrigues prevented the work from reaching the stage.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon (1995, 71)&lt;/ref&gt; ''La finta semplice'' eventually was premiered in Salzburg,&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch (1965, 89)&lt;/ref&gt; following the Mozarts' return there on 5 January 1769.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch (1965, 86)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later history==
{{see also|Smallpox#Eradication}}
The experience of losing three of her children to smallpox led Empress Maria Theresa to become a convert to inoculation. In 1768 she engaged the Dutch physician [[Jan Ingenhousz]] to conduct an inoculation program. Ingenhousz's program worked first among poor people, with the goal of developing a weakened strain of the disease; poor parents in Vienna were paid a ducat to have their children inoculated. The inoculations performed with this weakened strain on the imperial family were successful, and led to greater public acceptance for the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell (1998, 126), Glynn and Glynn (2004, 82–83)&lt;/ref&gt;

Smallpox struck the Mozart family again in the next generation: Nannerl's eldest son Leopold and two of her stepchildren caught the disease during an outbreak in the Salzburg area in 1787. All three children survived.&lt;ref name=H573&gt;Halliwell (1998, 573)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1796, the discovery of vaccination—the use of the related [[cowpox]] virus to immunize against smallpox—by [[Edward Jenner]] revolutionized the ability of medicine to deal with smallpox. Vaccination reached Vienna around 1800, when yet another local epidemic created impetus for its adoption. One of the doctors trained in the Vienna campaign, named Doutrepout, then brought vaccination to Mozart's native city of Salzburg. According to Halliwell, "popular resistance was fierce," and both the government and the Roman Catholic Church (previously an opponent) took stern measures to promote vaccination.&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell (1998, 617)&lt;/ref&gt; The first relative of Mozart's known to have been vaccinated was Johanna Berchtold von Sonnenberg, called "Jeannette" (1789–1805), Nannerl's youngest child;&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell (1998, 685)&lt;/ref&gt; she was vaccinated during the 1802 campaign in Salzburg.&lt;ref name=H573 /&gt;

With vaccination, great progress was made in reducing incidence of the disease, and it was eventually confirmed as eradicated in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Health Organization]]: [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/smallpox/en/ Factsheet Smallpox] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921235036/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/smallpox/en/ |date=2007-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6339">The '''National Data Guardian for Health and Care in England''' is an independent, non-regulatory, advice giving body sponsored by the [[Department of Health and Social Care]]. Dame [[Fiona Caldicott]] has held the position since its inauguration in November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/Health-Care-News/dame-fiona-caldicott-named-as-national-data-guardian|title=Dame Fiona Caldicott named as National Data Guardian|website=Nationalhealthexecutive.com|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitalhealth.net/2014/11/caldicott-becomes-data-guardian/|title=Caldicott becomes data guardian {{!}} Digital Health|date=2014-11-14|work=Digital Health|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role ==
The National Data Guardian provides guidance to the UK Government and the health and adult social care system on data confidentiality, security and patient data choice. Its role is to "help make sure the public can trust their confidential information is securely safeguarded and make sure that it is used to support citizens’ care and to achieve better outcomes from health and care services"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/national-data-guardian/about|title=About us|work=GOV.UK|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a non-regulatory body, the National Data Guardian does not issue or enforce sanctions; it works with existing regulators such as the [[Information Commissioner's Office|Information Commissioner’s Office]] and the [[Care Quality Commission]] where this is required.

== The Health and Social Care (National Data Guardian) Bill 2017-19 ==
A [[Private Members' Bills in the Parliament of the United Kingdom|Private Members' Bill]] to place the National Data Guardian role on a statutory footing was introduced to the Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in 2017. The Health and Social Care (National Data Guardian) Bill 2017-19 is sponsored by Member of Parliament [[Peter Bone]].

A consultation on the roles and functions of the National Data Guardian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/the-role-of-the-national-data-guardian-for-health-and-social-care|title=The role of the National Data Guardian for health and social care|website=Gov.uk|accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was held in 2015 in preparation for the bill's drafting. When enacted, it will give the role formal, advice-giving powers on matters related to the processing of health and adult social care data in England&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2018-06-06/debates/5decb14a-7c91-45fc-9c54-6dba2a90e841/HealthAndSocialCare(NationalDataGuardian)Bill|title=Health and Social Care (National  Data Guardian) Bill - Hansard|website=Hansard.parliament.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formal reviews ==
=== Review of Data Security, Consent and Opt-outs (published July 2016) ===
In September 2015, the Secretary of State for Health [[Jeremy Hunt]] asked the National Data Guardian and the [[Care Quality Commission]] conduct a formal review into data security and use, delivering as its outcomes: recommendations for new data security standards for health and care; a method for testing compliance against the standards; and a new consent or opt-out model for data sharing in relation to patient confidential data.

The National Data Guardian's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-of-data-security-consent-and-opt-outs|title=Review of data security, consent and opt-outs|website=Gov.uk|accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Review of Data Security, Consent and Opt-outs'' was published in July 2016. It made 20 recommendations, including the introduction of 10 national data security standards for health and care and a new tool for measuring performance against them.

The Care Quality Commission published its report ''Safe Data Safe Care'' in tandem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cqc.org.uk/publications/themed-work/safe-data-safe-care|title=Safe data, safe care - Care Quality Commission|website=Cqc.org.uk|accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government's 2017 response, '''Your Data: Better Security, Better Choice, Better Care''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/new-data-security-standards-for-health-and-social-care|title=New health data security standards and consent/opt-out model|website=Gov.uk|accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, accepted the recommendations and reported on plans to deliver against them, including the development of a new national data opt-out system for patients, which was launched by [[NHS Digital]] in May 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252441825/NHS-to-launch-national-data-opt-out-tool|title=NHS to launch national data opt-out tool|work=ComputerWeekly.com|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitalhealth.net/2018/05/national-data-opt-out-programme/|title=National data opt-out programme comes into force|date=2018-05-25|work=Digital Health|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The review also led to the closure of the [[care.data]] programme by [[NHS England]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/Health-Care-News/nhs-england-to-close-caredata-programme-following-caldicott-review|title=NHS England to close care.data programme following Caldicott Review|website=Nationalhealthexecutive.com|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prior reviews by Dame Fiona Caldicott ===
The ''Review of Data Security, Consent and Opt-outs'' was the first formal report delivered by Dame Fiona Caldicott in her role as National Data Guardian. It is referred to as Caldicott 3, as it is her third formal report to Government on the protection and use of patient information. The first, her ''[[Caldicott Report|Report on the Review of Patient-identifiable Information]]'' is known as the [[Caldicott Report]] and was published in 1997. The second report &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-information-governance-review|title=Caldicott review: information governance in the health and care system|website=Gov.uk|accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as Caldicott 2 was published in 2013.

'''Population Impact Measures (PIMs)''' are [[biostatistics |biostatistical]] measures of risk and benefit used in [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] and [[public health]] research. They are used to describe the impact of health risks and benefits in a population, to inform health policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heller |first1=R.

Frequently used measures of risk and benefit identified by Jerkel, Katz and Elmore, &lt;ref&gt;Jekel JF, Katz DL, Elmore JG Epidemiology, biostatistics, and preventive medicine: Chapter 6 Assessment of risk and benefit in epidemiologic studies Elsevier Health Sciences, 2001{{Page needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; describe measures of risk difference (attributable risk), rate difference (often expressed as the [[odds ratio]] or [[relative risk]]), [[attributable risk|Population Attributable Risk (PAR)]], and the [[relative risk reduction]], which can be recalculated into a measure of ''absolute benefit'', called the [[Number needed to treat]]. Population Impact Measures are an extension of these statistics, as they are measures of absolute risk at the population level, which are calculations of number of people in the population who are at risk to be harmed, or who will benefit from Public Health interventions. 

They are measures of absolute risk and benefit, producing numbers of people who will benefit from an intervention or be at risk from a [[risk factor]] within a particular local or national population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Torun |first1=P. |last2=Heller |first2=R.

They may have special relevance for local policy-making. They depend on the ability to obtain and use local data, and by being explicit about the data required may have the added benefit of encouraging the collection of such data.

==The measures==
To describe the impact of preventive and treatment interventions, the Number of Events Prevented in a Population (NEPP) is defined as ''"the number of events prevented by the intervention in your population over a defined time period"''. NEPP extends the well-known measure [[Number needed to treat]] (NNT) beyond the individual patient to the population. To describe the impact of a risk factor on causing ill health and disease the Population Impact Number of Eliminating a Risk factor (PIN-ER-t) is defined as ''"the potential number of disease events prevented in a population over the next t years by eliminating a risk factor"''. The PIN-ER-t extends the well-known [[Attributable risk|Population Attributable Risk]] (PAR) to a particular population and relates it to disease incidence, converting the PAR from a measure of relative to absolute risk.

The components for the calculations are as follows: Population denominator (size of the population); Proportion of the population with the disease; Proportion of the population exposed to the risk factor or the incremental proportion of the diseased population eligible for the proposed intervention (the latter requires the actual or estimated proportion who are currently receiving the interventions ‘subtracted’ from best practice goal from guidelines or targets, adjusted for likely compliance with the intervention); Baseline risk – the probability of the outcome of interest in this or similar populations; and Relative Risk of outcome given exposure to a risk factor or Relative Risk Reduction associated with the intervention.

==Number of Events Prevented in your Population; NEPP==
The formula is: NEPP=N*Pd*Pe*ru*RRR where: N = population size, Pd = prevalence of the disease, Pe = proportion eligible for treatment, ru = risk of the event of interest in the untreated group or baseline risk over appropriate time period (can be multiplied by life expectancy to produce life-years), RRR = relative risk reduction associated with treatment.

In order to reflect the incremental effect of changing from current to ‘best’ practice, and to adjust for levels of compliance, the proportion eligible for treatment, Pe, is (Pb-Pt)*Pc, where Pt is the proportion currently treated, Pb is the proportion that would be treated if best practice was adopted, and Pc is the proportion of the population who are compliant with the intervention.

You can calculate the NEPP and its confidence intervals [https://www.webcitation.org/5UvTU5t4v?url=http://www.phsim.man.ac.uk/nepp/ at this web site] from the [https://www.webcitation.org/5LeSrLsVX?url=http://www.phsim.man.ac.uk/ Population Health Decision Support &amp; Simulation site].

[Note: Number Needed to Treat (NNT): 1/(Baseline risk x Relative Risk Reduction)]

==Population Impact Number of Eliminating a Risk Factor; PIN-ER-t==
The formula is: PIN-ER-t = N*Ip*PAR Where: N is the number of people in the population; Ip the baseline risk of the outcome of interest in the population as a whole; t is the time period over which the outcome is measured.

The PAR/F, Population Attributable Risk (or Fraction), is calculated for two or multiple strata. The basic formula to compute the PAR for dichotomous variables is PAR = Pe*(RR-1)/1+ Pe*(RR-1). Where: Pe is the prevalence of the population within each income stratum as the exposure, and RR is the prevalence of risk factors in each stratum relative to the highest income fifth. This is modified where there are multiple strata to: PAR = [Pe1(RR1-1)+Pe2(RR2-1)+Pe3(RR3-1)…]/[1+Pe1(RR1-1)+Pe2(RR2-1)+ Pe3(RR3-1)...].
You can calculate the PIN-ER-t and its confidence intervals [https://archive.is/20121223091849/http://www.phsim.man.ac.uk/pinert/ at this web site] from the [https://www.webcitation.org/5LeSrLsVX?url=http://www.phsim.man.ac.uk/ Population Health Decision Support &amp; Simulation site].

The '''President's Malaria Initiative''' (PMI) is a U.S. Government initiative to control and eliminate [[malaria]], one of the leading global causes of premature death and disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/can-malaria-be-eradicated|title=Can Malaria Be Eradicated?|work=Council on Foreign Relations|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative was originally launched by U.S. president [[George W. Bush]] in 2005, and has been continued by each successive U.S. president.&lt;ref name="AboutPMI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmi.gov/about|title=About {{!}} PMI|publisher=President's Malaria Initiative}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PMI was originally created with a mission to "reduce malaria-related mortality by 50 percent across 15 high-burden countries in sub-Saharan Africa".&lt;ref name="AboutPMI" /&gt; PMI has since expanded to 24 malaria-endemic countries in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and 3 additional countries in the [[Greater Mekong Subregion]] of Southeast Asia, where it seeks to further reduce malaria burden and assist countries in achieving malaria elimination.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pmi.gov/docs/default-source/default-document-library/pmi-reports/2018-pmi-twelfth-annual-report.pdf|title=The President's Malaria Initiative, 12th Annual Report to Congress|last=|first=|date=|website=PMI.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The ''U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003'' originally authorized the U.S. Government to provide 5 years of malaria funding to bilateral partners and the Global Fund. PMI was subsequently launched by President George W. Bush in 2005. In 2008, PMI was reauthorized for another 5 years of funding by the ''Lantos-Hyde Act,'' which also called for development of a comprehensive U.S. Global Malaria Strategy, the latest version of which is the U.S. Global Malaria Strategy 2015-2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-u-s-government-and-global-malaria/|title=The President’s Malaria Initiative and Other U.S. Government Global Malaria Efforts|date=2018-04-10|work=The Henry J.

== Structure and Governance ==
PMI is interagency initiative overseen by the [[U.S. Global Malaria Coordinator]] in consultation with an Interagency Advisory Group composed of representatives from [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]], [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]], the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], and [[Office of Management and Budget]]. The initiative is led by USAID and implemented together with CDC. In addition to US-based staff at USAID and CDC headquarters, PMI maintains resident advisors from both agencies in each focus country.&lt;ref name="AboutPMI" /&gt;

== Countries ==
PMI currently provides direct support to 24 "focus" countries and 3 additional country programs in the Great Mekong Subregion. At the time of its launch in 2005, PMI provided support to just three countries: Angola, Tanzania, and Uganda. Four additional countries (Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, and Senegal) were added the following year. By 2007, PMI had added Benin, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Mali, and Zambia—bringing the total number of focus countries to the originally envisioned total of 15 high-burden nations.&lt;ref name="AboutPMI" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

In 2010, PMI added the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, Guinea, Zimbabwe, and the Mekong Subregion. &lt;ref name="AboutPMI" /&gt;

In 2017, with additional funding from Congress, PMI expanded to 5 more countries: Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Niger, and Sierra Leone.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Results ==
PMI is estimated to have prevented 185 million malaria cases and nearly 1 million deaths between 2005 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winskill|first=Peter|last2=Slater|first2=Hannah C.|last3=Griffin|first3=Jamie T.|last4=Ghani|first4=Azra C.|last5=Walker|first5=Patrick G.

'''Prevention through design''' (PtD), also called '''safety by design''' usually in Europe, is the concept of applying methods to minimize [[occupational safety and health|occupational hazards]] early in the design process, with an emphasis on optimizing employee health and safety throughout the [[Product lifecycle|life cycle]] of materials and processes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2012-147/|title=General Safe Practices for Working with Engineered Nanomaterials in Research Laboratories|last=|first=|date=May 2012|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|language=en-us|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a concept and movement that encourages [[Construction management|construction]] or [[product design]]ers to "design out" health and safety risks during design development. The concept supports the view that along with quality, programme and cost; safety is determined during the design stage.&lt;ref&gt;Behm M, 2005, Linking Construction Fatalities to the Design for Construction Safety Concept, Safety Science, Number 43, Pages 589-611&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Churcher D W, Alwani-Starr G M,Incorporating construction health and safety into the design process”, Implementation of Health and Safety in Construction Sites, Alvels, Dias &amp; Coble (eds), {{ISBN|90-5410-847-9}}, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ECI 2000 Designing for Safety and Health, Proceedings of the ECI/CIB/HSE international Conference, London, European Construction Institute, Loughborough, ed A G F Gibb, June 245pp ECI, Publications&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gambatese JA,  Hinze J and Haas C, Tool to Design for Construction Worker Safety, Journal of Architectural Engineering, Volume 3, Part 1, Pages 32-42, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gambatese JA, 2003, Safety in design: A Proactive Approach to Construction Worker Safety and Health, Applied Occupational and Environmental Hygiene, Vol 18 (5): pp 339-342&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gambatese JA, Hinze J, Addressing Construction Worker Safety in the Design Phase&amp;nbsp;– Designing for worker Safety, Automation in Construction, Volume 8, Issue 6, Pages 643-649, August 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hecker S, Gambatese J, Weinstein M, Designing for Worker Safety- Moving the Construction Safety Process Upstream, Professional Safety, Pages 32-44, September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;   It increases the cost-effectiveness of enhancements to occupational safety and health.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Background ==
Each year in the U.S., 55,000 people die from work-related injuries and diseases, 294,000 are made sick, and 3.8 million are injured. The annual direct and indirect costs have been estimated to range from $128 billion to $155 billion. Recent studies in [[Australia]] indicate that design is a significant contributor in 37% of work-related fatalities; therefore, the successful implementation of prevention through design concepts can have substantial impacts on worker health and safety.&lt;ref&gt;Heidel, Donna S., Paul Schulte.

The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) in the United States is a major contributor and promoter of PtD policy and guidelines. NIOSH considers PtD to be "the most effective and reliable type" of prevention of [[Occupational injury|occupational injuries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/wp-solutions/2015-198/|title=CDC - NIOSH Publications and Products - Supporting Prevention through Design (PtD) Using Business Value Concepts (2015-198)|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A core tenet of PtD philosophy the concept of addressing workplace hazards using methods at the top of the [[Hierarchy of hazard controls|Hierarch of Controls]], namely elimination and substitution.

Within Europe, construction designers are legally bound to design out risks during design development to reduce [[Construction site safety#Hazards to construction workers|hazards]] in the construction and end use phases via the Mobile Worksite Directive (also known as CDM regulations in the UK). The concept supports this legal requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/construction/cdm/2015/index.htm|title=Construction Design and Management Regulations 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=www.hse.gov.uk|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some [[Notified Body|Notified Bodies]] provide testing and design verification services to ensure [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]] with the safety standards defined in [[regulation codes]] such as the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tuv.com/en/corporate/business_customers/plants_machinery_1/pressure_equipment_2/asme_1/asme.html|title=Pressure Vessel Inspection According to ASME|last=|first=|date=|website=TÜV Rheinland|language=de|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many [[non-governmental organization]]s have been established to support this aim, principally in the UK, Australia and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saferdesign.org/Pages/default.aspx|title=Expired Registration Recovery Policy|last=|first=|date=|website=www.saferdesign.org|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130415184534/http://www.saferdesign.org/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=2013-04-15|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-04-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/swa/HealthSafety/SafeDesign/|title=Safe Work Australia|last=|first=|date=|website=Safe Work Australia|language=en-AU|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091214053507/http://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/swa/HealthSafety/SafeDesign/|archive-date=2009-12-14|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-04-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://secure.sph.harvard.edu/ccpe/programs.cfm?CSID=SDC0210&amp;pg=cluster&amp;CLID=1|title=Executive and Continuing Professional Education|last=|first=|date=|website=Harvard University School of Public Health|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816172545/https://secure.sph.harvard.edu/ccpe/programs.cfm?CSID%3DSDC0210%26pg%3Dcluster%26CLID%3D1|archive-date=2010-08-16|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
While engineering as a rule factors human safety into the design process, a modern appraisal of specific links to design and workers' safety can be seen in efforts beginning in the 1800s.  Trends included the widespread implementation of guards for machinery, controls for [[elevator]]s, and [[boiler]] safety practices. This was followed by enhanced design for [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]], enclosures, system monitors, [[Lockout-Tagout|lockout/tagout]] controls, and hearing protectors. More recently, there has been the development of chemical [[process safety]], [[ergonomics|ergonomically]] engineered tools, chairs, and work stations, lifting devices, retractable needles, latex-free gloves, and a parade of other safety devices and processes.&lt;ref name=schulte&gt;Schulte, Paul A., Richard Rinehart, Andrea Okun, Charles L. Geraci, Donna S. Heidel. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6V6F-4S3G8HX-2/2/b4749f31e38e327949d99b974a9705f8 ''National Prevention through Design (PtD) Initiative''], ''Journal of Safety Research'', Volume 39, Issue 2. Prevention through Design, 2008, Pages 115-121.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety]] began its National Initiative on Prevention through Design&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2014-123/|title=CDC - NIOSH Publications and Products - The State of the National Initiative on Prevention through Design (2014-123)|author=|date=|website=www.CDC.gov|access-date=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the goal of promoting prevention through design philosophy, practice, and policy.

==Integration==
Prevention through design represents a shift in approach for on-the-job safety. It involves evaluating potential risks associated with processes, structures, equipment, and tools. It takes into consideration the construction, maintenance, decommissioning, and disposal or recycling of waste material.&lt;ref name=schulte /&gt;
 
The idea of redesigning job tasks and work environments has begun to gain momentum in business and government as a cost-effective means to enhance occupational safety and health. Many U.S. companies openly support PtD concepts and have developed management practices to implement them. Other countries are actively promoting PtD concepts as well. The [[United Kingdom]] began requiring construction companies, project owners, and architects to address safety and health during the design phase of projects in 1994. Australia developed the Australian National OHS Strategy 2002–2012, which set "eliminating hazards at the design stage" as one of five national priorities. As a result, the Australian Safety and Compensation Council (ASCC) developed the Safe Design National Strategy and Action Plans for Australia encompassing a wide range of design areas.&lt;ref name=niosh /&gt;

=== Government ===
The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] is a large contributor to prevention through design efforts in the United States. Several NIOSH initiatives and guidelines directly or indirectly advocate for PtD practices. Through NIOSH efforts, the [[U.S. Green Building Council]] posted new PtD credits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/ptd/greenjobs.html|title=CDC - Prevention Through Design: Green , Safe, and Healthy Jobs - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|author=|date=|website=www.CDC.gov|access-date=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; available for [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification]] for construction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5897">'''Pseudonymization''' is a [[data management]] and [[de-identification]] procedure by which [[personally identifiable information]] fields within a [[data]] record are replaced by one or more artificial identifiers, or [[pseudonym]]s. A single pseudonym for each replaced field or collection of replaced fields makes the data record less identifiable while remaining suitable for [[data analysis]] and [[data processing]]. 

Pseudonymization can be one way to comply with the [[European Union]]'s new [[General Data Protection Regulation]] demands for secure data storage of personal information.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dativa.com/data-science-gdpr-pseudonymization-data-pipeline/ Data science under GDPR with pseudonymization in the data pipeline] Published by Dativa, 17 April, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Pseudonymized data can be restored to its original state with the addition of information which then allows individuals to be re-identified, while anonymized data can never be restored to its original state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.protegrity.com/pseudonymization-vs-anonymization-help-gdpr/ Pseudonymization vs. Anonymization and How They Help With GDPR] Published January, 2017 Retrieved April 20, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data fields==
The choice of which data fields are to be pseudonymized is partly subjective. Less selective fields, such as Birth Date or Postal Code are often also included because they are usually available from other sources and therefore make a record easier to identify. Pseudonymizing these less identifying fields removes most of their analytic value and is therefore normally accompanied by the introduction of new derived and less identifying forms, such as year of birth or a larger [[postal code]] region.

Data fields that are less identifying, such as date of attendance, are usually not pseudonymized. It is important to realize that this is because too much statistical utility is lost in doing so, not because the data cannot be identified. For example, given prior knowledge of a few attendance dates it is easy to identify someone's data in a pseudonymized dataset by selecting only those people with that pattern of dates. This is an example of an [[inference attack]].

The weakness of pseudonymized data to inference attacks is commonly overlooked. A famous example is the [[AOL search data scandal]].

Protecting statistically useful pseudonymized data from re-identification requires:
#  a sound [[information security]] base 
#  controlling the risk that the analysts, researchers or other data workers cause a privacy breach

The pseudonym allows tracking back of data to its origins, which distinguishes pseudonymization from [[anonymization]],&lt;ref&gt;http://dud.inf.tu-dresden.de/literatur/Anon_Terminology_v0.31.pdf Anonymity, Unlinkability, Undetectability, Unobservability, Pseudonymity, and Identity Management – A Consolidated Proposal for Terminology&lt;/ref&gt; where all person-related data that could allow backtracking has been purged. Pseudonymization is an issue in, for example, patient-related data that has to be passed on securely between clinical centers.

The application of pseudonymization to e-health intends to preserve the patient's privacy and data confidentiality. It allows primary use of medical records by authorized health care providers and privacy preserving secondary use by researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Neubauer T, Heurix J. A methodology for the pseudonymization of medical data. Int J Med Inform. 2011 Mar;80(3) 190-204. doi:10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2010.10.016. {{PMID|21075676}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, plain pseudonymization for privacy preservation often reaches its limits when [[genetic data]] are involved (see also [[genetic privacy]]). Due to the identifying nature of genetic data, depersonalization is often not sufficient to hide the corresponding person. Potential solutions are the combination of pseudonymization with fragmentation and [[encryption]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xylem-technologies.com/2011/09/07/privacy-preserving-storage-and-access-of-medical-data-through-pseudonymization-and-encryption Privacy-Preserving Storage and Access of Medical Data through Pseudonymization and Encryption&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of application of pseudonymization procedure is creation of datasets for [[de-identification]] research by replacing [[Personally identifiable information|identifying]] words with words from the same category (e.g. replacing a name with a random name from the names dictionary),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Neamatullah | first1 = Ishna | last2 = Douglass | first2 = Margaret M | last3 = Li-wei | last4 = Lehman | first4 = H | last5 = Reisner | first5 = Andrew | last6 = Villarroe | first6 = Mauricio | last7 = Long | first7 = William J | last8 = Szolovits | first8 = Peter | last9 = Moody | first9 = George B | last10 = Mark | first10 = Roger G | last11 = Clifford | first11 = Gari D | year = 2008 | title = Automated de-identification of free-text medical records | url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/8/32 | journal = BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making | volume = 8 | issue ishna neamatullah, automated de-identification of free-text medical records, http://www.physionet.= | page = 32 | doi=10.1186/1472-6947-8-32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;org/physiotools/deid/doc/ishna-meng-thesis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deleger | first1 = L | display-authors = etal   | year = 2014 | title = Preparing an annotated gold standard corpus to share with extramural investigators for de-identification research | url = | journal = J Biomed Inform | volume = 50| issue = | pages = 173–183| doi = 10.1016/j.jbi.2014.01.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, in this case it is in general not possible to track data back to its origins.

'''Pulsus paradoxus''', also '''paradoxic pulse''' or '''paradoxical pulse''',  is an abnormally large decrease in stroke volume, [[systolic blood pressure]] and [[pulse]] wave [[amplitude]] during [[Inhalation|inspiration]]. The normal fall in pressure is less than 10 [[mmHg]]. When the drop is more than 10&amp;nbsp;mmHg, it is referred to as pulsus paradoxus. Pulsus paradoxus is not related to pulse rate or heart rate and it is not a paradoxical rise in systolic pressure. The normal variation of blood pressure during breathing/respiration is a decline in blood pressure during inhalation and an increase during exhalation. Pulsus paradoxus is a [[Medical sign|sign]] that is indicative of several conditions, including [[cardiac tamponade]],  chronic [[sleep apnea]], [[croup]],  and [[obstructive lung disease]] (e.g. [[asthma]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]]).&lt;ref name=khasnis_12082330&gt;{{cite journal

The ''paradox'' in ''pulsus paradoxus'' is that, on [[physical examination]], one can detect beats on [[cardiac auscultation]] during inspiration that cannot be palpated at the [[radial artery|radial]] [[pulse]].&lt;ref name=khasnis_12082330/&gt;  It results from an accentuated decrease of the blood pressure, which leads to the (radial) pulse not being palpable and may be accompanied by an increase in the [[jugular venous pressure]] height ([[Kussmaul's sign]]).  As is usual with inspiration, the [[heart rate]] is slightly increased,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Guntheroth W, Morgan B, Mullins G |title=Effect of respiration on venous return and stroke volume in cardiac tamponade. Mechanism of pulsus parodoxus |journal=Circ. Res. |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=381–90 |year=1967 |pmid=6025402 |doi=10.1161/01.res.20.4.381}} [http://circres.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/circresaha;20/4/381 Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; due to decreased &lt;!-- it is systemic venous return --&gt; left ventricular output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Soucek M, Kára T, Jurák P, Halámek J, Spinarová L, Meluzín J, Toman J, Rihácek I, Sumbera J, Frána P |title=Heart rate and increased intravascular volume |journal=Physiological research / Academia Scientiarum Bohemoslovaca |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=137–40 |year=2003 |pmid=12625819}} [http://www.biomed.cas.cz/physiolres/pdf/52/52_137.pdf Free Full Text].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
During inspiration, the negative intra-thoracic pressure results in an increased right venous return, filling the right atrium more than during an exhalation. The increased blood volume dilates the right atrium, reducing the compliance of the left atrium due to their shared septum. Lower left atrial compliance reduces the left atrium venous return and as a consequence causes a reduction in left ventricular preload. This results in a reduction in left ventricular stroke volume, and will be noted as a reduction in systolic blood pressure in inspiration.
Pulses paradoxus is therefore an exaggeration or an increase in the fall of systolic BP beyond 10 mmHG during inspiration.

Normally during inspiration, a person's systolic blood pressure decreases by ≤10 [[mmHg]]&lt;ref name=khasnis_12082330/&gt; and pulse slightly increases. This is because inspiration decreases [[intra-thoracic pressure]] relative to atmospheric pressure, which increases blood flow (systemic venous return) to the right atrium of the heart by reducing pressure on the veins, particularly the venae cavae. However, the decrease in intra-thoracic pressure and stretching of the lungs during inhalation also expands the compliant pulmonary vasculature so that blood pools in the lungs and decreases pulmonary venous return to the left atrium. Also, the increased systemic venous return to the right side of the heart expands the right heart and directly compromises filling of the left side of the heart by slightly bulging the septum to the left, reducing maximum volume. Reduced left-heart filling leads to a reduced stroke volume which manifests as a decrease in systolic blood pressure, leading to a faster heart rate due to the [[baroreceptor reflex]], which stimulates [[autonomic nervous system|sympathetic outflow]] to the heart.

Under normal physiologic conditions the large pressure gradient between the right and left ventricles prevents the septum from bulging dramatically into the left ventricle during inspiration. However such bulging does occur during cardiac tamponade where  pressure equalizes between all of the chambers of the heart.&lt;ref name="Spectrum of hemodynamic changes in cardiac tamponade"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reddy|title=Spectrum of hemodynamic changes in cardiac tamponade|journal=American Journal of Cardiology|year=1990|volume=66|issue=20|pages=1487–91|doi=10.1016/0002-9149(90)90540-H|pmid=2251997|first1=PS|last2=Curtiss|first2=EI|last3=Uretsky|first3=BF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following a zero-sum game principle, as the right ventricle receives more volume it can push the septum into the left ventricle further reducing its volume in turn. This additional loss of volume of the left ventricle that ''only'' occurs with equalization of the pressures (as in tamponade) allows for the further reduction in volume, so cardiac output is reduced, leading to a further decline in BP.  However, in situations where the left ventricular pressure remains higher than the pericardial sac (most frequently from coexisting disease with an elevated left ventricular diastolic pressure), there is no pulsus paradoxus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reddy|title=Cardiac tamponade: hemodynamic observations in man|journal=Circulation|year=1978|volume=58|issue=2|pages=265–72|pmid=668074|first1=PS|last2=Curtiss|first2=EI|last3=O'Toole|first3=JD|last4=Shaver|first4=JA|doi=10.1161/01.cir.58.2.265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although one or both of these mechanisms may occur, a third may additionally contribute. The large negative intra-thoracic pressure increases the pressure across the wall of the left ventricle (increased transmural pressure, equivalent to [pressure within ventricle] - [pressure outside of ventricle]). This pressure gradient, resisting the contraction of the left ventricle, causes an increase in [[afterload]]. This results in a decrease in [[stroke volume]], contributing to the decreased [[pulse pressure]] and increased heart rate as described above.

Pulsus paradoxus occurs not only with severe cardiac tamponade, but also with asthma, obstructive sleep apnea and croup. The mechanism, at least with severe tamponade, is likely very similar to those of hypertrophic and restrictive cardiomyopathies (diastolic dysfunction), where a decrease in Left Ventricular (LV) filling corresponds to an increasingly reduced stroke volume. In other words, with these cardiomyopathies, as LV filling decreases, ejection fraction decreases directly, yet non-linearly and with a negative concavity (negative first and second derivatives). Similarly with tamponade, the degree of diastolic dysfunction is inversely proportional to the LV end-diastolic volume. So during inspiration, since LV filling is lesser relative to that during expiration, the diastolic dysfunction is also proportionally greater, so the systolic pressure drops &gt;10&amp;nbsp;mmHg. This mechanism is also likely with pericarditis, where diastolic function is chastened.

==Measurement==
PP is quantified using a [[blood pressure cuff]] and stethoscope ([[Korotkoff sounds]]), by measuring the variation of the '''systolic''' pressure during expiration and inspiration. Inflate cuff until no sounds (as is normally done when taking a BP) slowly decrease cuff pressure until systolic sounds are first heard during ''expiration'' but not during inspiration, (note this reading), slowly continue decreasing the cuff pressure until sounds are heard ''throughout'' the respiratory cycle, (inspiration and expiration)(note this second reading). If the pressure difference between the two readings is &gt;10mmHg, it can be classified as pulsus paradoxus.

==Causes==
Pulsus paradoxus can be caused by several physiologic mechanisms.  Anatomically, these can be grouped into:&lt;ref name=khasnis_12082330/&gt;
*''cardiac causes'',
*''pulmonary causes'' and
*''non-pulmonary and non-cardiac causes''.

Considered physiologically, PP is caused by:
*decreased right heart functional reserve, e.g. [[myocardial infarction]] and tamponade,
*right ventricular inflow or outflow obstruction, e.g. superior vena cava obstruction and pulmonary embolism, and
*decreased blood to the left heart due to lung hyperinflation (e.g. asthma, COPD) and anaphylactic shock.

===List of causes===
Cardiac:
*[[constrictive pericarditis]]. One study found that pulsus paradoxus occurs in less than 20% of patients with constrictive pericarditis.&lt;ref name=Talreja&gt;{{cite journal|last=Talreja|first=DR |author2=Nishimura, RA |author3=Oh, JK |author4=Holmes, DR|title=Constrictive pericarditis in the modern era: novel criteria for diagnosis in the cardiac catheterization laboratory.|journal=Journal of the American College of Cardiology|date=Jan 22, 2008|volume=51|issue=3|pages=315–9|pmid=18206742|doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2007.09.039}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[pericardial effusion]], including [[cardiac tamponade]]
*[[cardiogenic shock]]

Pulmonary:
*[[pulmonary embolism]]
*[[tension pneumothorax]]
*[[asthma]] (especially with severe asthma exacerbations)
*[[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]]

Non-pulmonary and non-cardiac:
*[[anaphylactic shock]]
*[[hypovolemia]]
*[[superior vena cava]] obstruction
*[[pregnancy]]
*[[obesity]]

PP has been shown to be predictive of the severity of cardiac tamponade.&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss EI, Reddy PS, Uretsky BF, Cecchetti AA. Pulsus paradoxus: definition and relation to the severity of cardiac tamponade. Am Heart J. 1988 Feb;115(2):391-8. {{PMID|3341174}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Pulsus paradoxus may not be seen with cardiac tamponade if an [[atrial septal defect]] or significant [[aortic regurgitation]] is also present.

'''''Pure, White, and Deadly''''' is a book written by [[John Yudkin]] in 1972. It summarised the research that Yudkin had been conduction at [[Queen Elizabeth College]] where he was professor of Nutrition.  It set out the physiological impact of sugar on the western diet leading to increased rates of obesity and heart disease. This was at a time when consumption of fat was regarded as the key causative agent of the increases in obesity.

[[File:Sanfranciscocityclinicnight.jpeg|thumb|right|[[San Francisco City Clinic]], a STD testing center in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]].]]

'''Sexual health clinics''' specialize in the prevention and treatment of [[sexually transmitted infections]].

==Terminology==

Sexual health clinics are also called ''[[sexually transmitted disease]] (STD) clinics'', ''sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics'', ''venereal disease (VD) clinics'', or ''[[genitourinary medicine]] (GUM) clinics''.

Sexual health clinics differ from [[reproductive health]] and [[family planning]] clinics. Sexual health clinics offer only some reproductive health services. [[Reproductive health]] clinics, such as [[Planned Parenthood]], offer most of the services of sexual health clinics.

==Services==

Sexual health clinics provide some or all of the following:

*Information about [[safer sex]], [[birth control]], [[reproductive health]] and general [[sex education]]
*[[Condom]]s
*Sexual health [[#Examinations|examinations]]
*[[STD testing|Tests]] to detect some [[sexually transmitted infection]]s
*[[Antibiotic]]s to [[cure]] [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], [[gonorrhea]], and [[syphilis]]
*[[Medication]]s and other [[Therapy|treatments]]
*[[Vaccination]]s
*Counseling and education
*[[Emergency contraception]]
*[[Urine test]] for [[pregnancy]]
*Referrals for additional information or services

Many clinics provide vaccinations to prevent [[infection]]s from the [[hepatitis A]] and [[Hepatitis B virus|B]] [[Introduction to viruses|viruses]].&lt;ref&gt;

 | publisher = [[National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse]]
 |date=December 2006
 | accessdate = 2008-09-28
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Young women may receive vaccinations to prevent infection from some strains of the [[HPV vaccine|human papillomavirus]] (HPV).

Many clinics provide [[interpreting]] for the hearing impaired or speakers of other languages.

Many clinics will help patients tell their sexual contacts if they have a sexually transmitted infection, anonymously if needed.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public governmental and [[non-profit]] clinics often provide services for free or adjust the fee based on a patient's ability to pay.

Sexual health clinics often offer services without appointments. Some clinics open evenings or weekends.

Some clinics have separate hours or facilities for men and women. Some clinics serve only specific populations such as women, men, [[Men who have sex with men|MSM]], [[youths]], [[LGBT]], ethnic groups, the poor, or students.

==Examinations==
&lt;!-- {{ main|Sexual health examination}} --&gt;
{{See also|intimate examination}}

With the patient's [[informed consent|consent]], a [[clinician]] will inspect the patient visually and by touch. If needed, the clinician will take samples to [[STD test|test]] for [[sexually transmitted infection]]s.

In a private room or space, the patient will partially undress.

The clinician may inspect the patient's:
*Throat and [[lymph node]]s of the neck for inflammation
*[[Pubic hair]] for [[pubic lice|lice]]
*[[Superficial inguinal lymph nodes|Lymph node]]s of the groin for swelling
*Genitals, [[Human anus|anus]], and surrounding areas for sores and [[wart]]s

The clinician may swab the patient's:
*Throat to test for [[gonorrhea]] and possibly [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]]
*Cheek, inside, to [[Diagnosis of HIV/AIDS|diagnose HIV]]
*Sores of the genitals, [[Human anus|anus]], and surrounding areas to test for [[herpes]]&lt;ref&gt;

The clinician may ask for a small [[urine]] sample, given in private, to test for [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] and possibly [[gonorrhea]].

The inspections and taking samples don't hurt, but swabbing the urethra and cervix, and a finger prick blood sample feel uncomfortable.

Women will often receive a [[pelvic exam]], both external and internal, but usually less thorough than a reproductive health exam.

A patient can choose a female or male clinician if available.
A patient can have a [[chaperone (clinical)|chaperone]].
Some clinics have separate hours or facilities for men and women.

==Privacy==
Medical [[confidentiality]] is an important part of the [[medical ethics]] of a [[doctor–patient relationship]]. Sexual health clinics follow local standards of medical confidentiality to protect the privacy of patients. Some clinics provide anonymous services or protect confidentiality by having a patient use a number or a pseudonym.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional privacy protections sometimes apply to matters of sexuality and reproduction, since these areas are sensitive in many cultures. The [[diagnosis of HIV/AIDS]] has legal restrictions in patient confidentiality, and some clinics use [[Diagnosis of HIV/AIDS#Rapid or point-of-care tests|rapid antibody tests]] to provide results to a patient within 30 minutes, without holding the patient's records.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In the United States, clinics receiving federal funding from [[Medicaid]] or [[Title X]] of the [[Public Health Service Act]] must treat all patients confidentially. Thus minors can receive services without parental notification or consent.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, medical records for all patients age 18 and above are strictly confidential under [[HIPAA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stevens|first1=Sara|title=STD Health Clinics|url=https://www.stdaware.com/stds/std-health-clinics|publisher=STDAware|accessdate=16 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consent==

Medical standards of [[informed consent]] apply to sexual health clinics. A patient needs information about the purposes and consequences of examinations, tests, treatments, and other procedures. A patient may then choose whether to consent to these procedures.

A [[Minor (law)|minor]] may consent to receive some or all of the procedures at many sexual health clinics.

==Overview==
The questionnaire is designed so that each question has a two-part answer. The first part asks the interviewee to list up to nine people available to provide support that meet the criteria stated in the question. These support individuals are specified using their initials in addition to the relationship to the interviewee.&lt;ref name="BioPsychoSocial Assessment Tools for the Elderly"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://instruct.uwo.ca/kinesiology/9641/Assessments/Social/SSQ.html|title=BioPsychoSocial Assessment Tools for the Elderly - Assessment Summary Sheet|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Example questions from the first part includes questions such as “Whom could you count on to help if you had just been fired from your job or expelled from school?” and “Whom do you feel would help if a family member very close to you died?”.&lt;ref name="A Brief Measure of Social Support" /&gt;

The second part asks the interviewee to specify how satisfied they are with each of the people stated in the first part. The SSQ respondents use a 6 -point [[Likert scale]] to indicate their degree of satisfaction with the support from the above people ranging from “1 - very dissatisfied” to “6 - very satisfied”.&lt;ref name="A Brief Measure of Social Support" /&gt;

The Social Support Questionnaire has multiple short forms such as the SSQ3 and the SSQ6.

==History of the SSQ==
The SSQ is based on 4 original studies. The first study set out to determine whether the SSQ had the desired psychometric properties. The second study tried to relate SSQ and a diversity of personality measures such as [[anxiety]], depression and hostility in connection with the Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist. The third study considered the relationship between social support, the prior year’s negative and positive life events, internal-external locus of control and self- esteem in conjunction with the Life Experiences Survey. The fourth study tested the idea that social support could serve as a buffer when faced with difficult life situations via trying to solve a maze and subsequently completing the Cognitive Interference Questionnaire.&lt;ref name="ADA100464" /&gt;

==Scoring==
The overall support score (SSQN) is calculated by taking an average of the individual scores across the 27 items.&lt;ref name="BioPsychoSocial Assessment Tools for the Elderly" /&gt; A high score on the SSQ indicates more optimism about life than a low score. Respondents with low SSQ scores have a higher prevalence of negative life events and illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sarason|first=|year=1985|title=Concomitants of Social Support: Social Skills, Physical Attractiveness and Gender|url=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA141884|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=49|pages=469–480|via=|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.49.2.469}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scoring is as follows:

1. Add the total number of people for all 27 items (questions). (Max. is 243). Divide by 27 for average item score. This gives you SSQ Number Score, or SSQN.

2. Add the total satisfaction scores for all 27 items (questions). (Max is 162). Divide by 27 for average item score. This gives you SSQ Satisfaction score or SSQS.

3. Finally, you can average the above for  the total number of people that are family members - this results in the SSQ family score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agedcaretests.com/The_Social_Support_Questionnaire_(SSQ)_SAMPLE.pdf|title=Social Support Questionnaire Sample|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reliability==
According to Sarason, the SSQ takes between fifteen to eighteen minutes to properly administer and has “good” test-retest reliability.&lt;ref name="A Brief Measure of Social Support" /&gt;

==Validity==
The SSQ was compared with the depression scale and validity tests show significant negative correlation ranging from -0.22 to -0.43. The SSQ and the optimism scale have a correlation of 0.57. The SSQ and the satisfaction score have a correlation of 0.34.&lt;ref name="A Brief Measure of Social Support" /&gt; The SSQ has high [[internal consistency]] among items.&lt;ref name="ADA100464" /&gt;

==Related Surveys==

=== SSQ3 ===

The SSQ3 is a short form of the SSQ and has only three questions. The SSQ3 has acceptable test-test reliability and correlation with personality variables as compared to the long form of the Social Support Questionnaire. The internal reliability was borderline but this low level of internal reliability is as expected since there are only three questions.&lt;ref name="Social Support Questionnaire" /&gt;

=== SSQ6 ===

The SSQ6 is a short form of the SSQ. The SSQ6 has been shown to have high correlation with: the SSQ, SSQ personality variables and internal reliability. In the development of the SSQ6, the research suggests that professed social support in adults may be a connected to “early attachment experience.”&lt;ref name="Social Support Questionnaire" /&gt; The SSQ6 consists of the below 6 questions:

1. Whom can you really count on to be dependable when you need help?

2. Whom can you really count on to help you feel more relaxed when you are under pressure or tense?

3. Who accepts you totally, including both your worst and your best points?

4. Whom can you really count on to care about you, regardless of what is happening to you?

5. Whom can you really count on to help you feel better when you are feeling generally down-in-the-dumps?

6. Whom can you count on to console you when you are very upset?&lt;ref name="BioPsychoSocial Assessment Tools for the Elderly" /&gt;

===Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL)===

The Interpersonal Support Evaluation List includes 40 items (questions) with four sub-scales in the areas of Tangible Support, Belonging Support, Self-Esteem Support and Appraisal Support. The interviewee rates each item based on how true or false they feel the item is for themselves. The four total response options are “Definitely True”, “Probably True”, “Probably False”, and “Definitely False”.&lt;ref name="Social Support Questionnaire" /&gt;

'''Socialized medicine''' is a term used in the United States to describe and discuss systems of [[universal health care]]: medical and hospital care for all at a nominal cost by means of government regulation of [[health care]] and subsidies derived from [[taxation]].&lt;ref&gt;The American Heritage Medical Dictionary, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company&lt;/ref&gt; Because of historically negative associations with [[socialism]] in American culture, the term is usually used [[pejorative]]ly in American political discourse.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Paul Burleigh Horton, Gerald R.

==Background==
The original meaning was confined to systems in which the government operates health care facilities and employs health care professionals.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/57/S0525700.html|title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210141328/http://www.bartleby.com/61/57/S0525700.html|archivedate=2009-02-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/so/socmed.html|title=The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111064610/http://www.bartleby.com/65/so/socmed.html|archivedate=2007-11-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacob S. Hacker, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/21/AR2008032102743.html "Socialized Medicine: Let's Try a Dose, We're Bound to Feel Better"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822064338/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/21/AR2008032102743.html |date=2016-08-22 }}, ''Washington Post'', March 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This narrower usage would apply to the British [[National Health Service]] hospital trusts and health systems that operate in other countries as diverse as Finland, Spain, Israel, and Cuba. The United States [[Veterans Health Administration]] and the medical departments of the [[Army Medical Department (United States)|U.S. Army]], [[Surgeon General of the United States Navy|Navy]], and [[Air Force Medical Service|Air Force]], would also fall under this narrow definition. When used in that way, the narrow definition permits a clear distinction from [[single-payer health care|single payer health insurance]] systems, in which the government finances health care but is not involved in care delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Single Payer article from AMSA |url=http://www.amsa.org/uhc/SinglePayer101.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061024133141/http://www.amsa.org/uhc/SinglePayer101.pdf |archivedate=2006-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=25521|title=MedTerms medical dictionary|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930180758/http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=25521|archivedate=2007-09-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, American conservative critics of [[health care reform in the United States|health care reform]] have attempted to broaden the term by applying it to any publicly funded system. [[Medicare (Canada)|Canada's Medicare]] system and most of the UK's NHS [[general practitioner]] and [[dentistry|dental]] services, which are systems where health care is delivered by private business with partial or total government funding, fit the broader definition, as do the health care systems of most of Western Europe. In the United States, [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], [[Medicaid]], and the [[US military]]'s [[TRICARE]] fall under that definition. In specific regard to military benefits of a (currently) volunteer military, such care is an owed benefit to a specific group as part of an economic exchange, which muddies the definition yet further.

Most industrialized countries and many developing countries operate some form of publicly funded health care with universal coverage as the goal. According to the [[Institute of Medicine]] and others, the United States is the only wealthy, industrialized nation that does not provide [[universal health care]].&lt;ref name="IOM"&gt;[http://www.iom.edu/?id=17848 Insuring America's Health: Principles and Recommendations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818031109/http://www.iom.edu/?id=17848 |date=2007-08-18 }}, Institute of Medicine at the National Academies of Science, 2004-01-14, accessed 2007-10-22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cthealth.server101.com/the_case_for_universal_health_care_in_the_united_states.htm|title=The Case for Universal Health Care in the United States|author=|date=|website=cthealth.server101.com|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423105127/http://cthealth.server101.com/the_case_for_universal_health_care_in_the_united_states.htm|archivedate=23 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonathan Oberlander]], a professor of health policy at the [[University of North Carolina]], maintains that the term is merely a political pejorative that has been defined to mean different levels of government involvement in health care, depending on what the speaker was arguing against at the time.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16962482 Socialized Medicine Belittled on Campaign Trail] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707232709/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16962482 |date=2017-07-07 }} from NPR.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is often used by conservatives in the U.S. to imply that the privately run health care system would become controlled by the government, thereby associating it with [[socialism]], which has negative connotations to some people in American political culture.&lt;ref name="MFriedman"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hillsdale.edu/hctools/imprimis_archive/2006/07/2006_07_Imprimis.pdf |title=Free to Choose: A Conversation with Milton Friedman |accessdate=2008-04-14 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530160511/http://www.hillsdale.edu/hctools/imprimis_archive/2006/07/2006_07_Imprimis.pdf |archivedate=May 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, its usage is controversial,&lt;ref name="autogenerated6" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt; and at odds with the views of conservatives in other countries prepared to defend socialized medicine such as [[Margaret Thatcher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opinion.publicfinance.co.uk/2009/08/the-end-is-nye/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723184018/http://opinion.publicfinance.co.uk/2009/08/the-end-is-nye/ |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of term==
When the term "socialized medicine" first appeared in the United States in the early 1900s, it bore no negative connotations. Otto P. Geier, chairman of the Preventive Medicine Section of the [[American Medical Association]], was quoted in ''The New York Times'' in 1917 as praising socialized medicine as a way to "discover disease in its incipiency," help end "venereal diseases, alcoholism, tuberculosis," and "make a fundamental contribution to social welfare."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1917/07/01/96251567.pdf |title=World at War is Facing a Shortage of Doctors|accessdate=2009-04-02 |date=1917-07-01 |work= |publisher=''[[New York Times]]'' | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, by the 1930s, the term socialized medicine was routinely used negatively by [[American conservatism|conservative]] opponents of [[publicly funded health care]] who wished to imply it represented socialism, and by extension, communism.&lt;ref name="Slate history lesson"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2175477 |title=Who's Afraid of Socialized Medicine?

Roosevelt]] later championed it, as did [[Harry S.

Truman Library and Museum&lt;/ref&gt; and many others. Truman announced before describing his proposal that: "This is not socialized medicine".&lt;ref name="Slate history lesson"/&gt;

Government involvement in health care was ardently opposed by the AMA, which distributed posters to doctors with slogans such as "Socialized medicine&amp;nbsp;... will undermine the democratic form of government."&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Garceau, "Organized Medicine Enforces its 'Party Line'", Public Opinion Quarterly, September 1940, p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt; According to T.R. Reid (''The Healing of America'', 2009): &lt;blockquote&gt;The term ["socialized medicine"] was popularized by the public relations firm [[Whitaker and Baxter]] working for the American Medical Association in 1947 to disparage President Truman's proposal for a national health care system. It was a label, at the dawn of the [[cold war]], meant to suggest that anybody advocating universal access to health care must be a communist. And the phrase has retained its political power for six decades.&lt;ref name="T.R. Reid, 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The AMA conducted a nationwide campaign called [[Operation Coffee Cup]] during the late 1950s and early 1960s in opposition to the Democrats' plans to extend [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] to include health insurance for the elderly, later known as [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]. As part of the plan, doctors' wives would organize coffee meetings in an attempt to convince acquaintances to write letters to Congress opposing the program.&lt;ref name=OCC&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/16/magazine/16SOCIAL.html| title=A Question of Numbers| publisher=[[The New York Times]]| author=Roger Lowenstein| date=2009-07-27| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331144728/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/16/magazine/16SOCIAL.html| archivedate=2014-03-31| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, [[Ronald Reagan]] recorded a disc entitled ''[[Ronald Reagan Speaks Out Against Socialized Medicine]]'' warning its audience the "dangers" that socialized medicine could bring.

[[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] are forms of [[publicly funded health care]], which fits the looser definition of socialized medicine.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Part B coverage (Medical) requires a monthly premium of $96.40 (and possibly higher) and the first $135 of costs per year also fall to the senior, not the government.&lt;ref&gt;http://questions.medicare.gov/cgi-bin/medicare.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=2100 Medicare rates&lt;/ref&gt;

A poll released in February 2008, conducted by the [[Harvard School of Public Health]] and [[Harris Insights &amp; Analytics|Harris Interactive]], indicated that Americans are currently divided in their opinions of socialized medicine, and this split correlates strongly with their political party affiliation.&lt;ref name="Harvard School of Public Health"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Poll Finds Americans Split by Political Party Over Whether Socialized Medicine Better or Worse Than Current System |publisher=Harvard School of Public Health |date=2007-02-14 |url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/2008-releases/poll-americans-split-by-political-party-over-socialized-medicine.html |accessdate=2008-02-27 |quote= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217230522/http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/2008-releases/poll-americans-split-by-political-party-over-socialized-medicine.html |archivedate=2008-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two thirds of those polled said they understood the term "socialized medicine" very well or somewhat well.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} When offered descriptions of what such a system could mean, strong majorities believed that it means "the government makes sure everyone has health insurance" (79%) and "the government pays most of the cost of health care" (73%). One third (32%) felt that socialized medicine is a system in which "the government tells doctors what to do."{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The poll showed "striking differences" by party affiliation. Among Republicans polled, 70% said that socialized medicine would be worse than the current system. The same percentage of Democrats (70%) said that a socialized medical system would be better than the current system. Independents were more evenly split, with 43% saying socialized medicine would be better and 38% worse.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

According to Robert J. Blendon, professor of health policy and political analysis at the Harvard School of Public Health, "The phrase 'socialized medicine' really resonates as a pejorative with Republicans. However, that so many Democrats believe that socialized medicine would be an improvement is an indication of their dissatisfaction with our current system." Physicians' opinions have become more favorable toward "socialized medicine."&lt;ref name="Harvard School of Public Health"/&gt;

A 2008 survey of doctors, published in ''[[Annals of Internal Medicine]]'', shows that physicians support universal health care and national health insurance by almost 2 to 1.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSN3143203520080331?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=healthNews&amp;rpc=22&amp;sp=true Doctors support universal health care: survey], Reuters, March 31, 2008 (first reported in Annals of Internal Medicine).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political controversies in the United States==
{{See also|Health care economics}}
{{Debate|date=January 2011}}

Although the marginal scope of free or subsidized medicine provided is much discussed within the political body in most countries with socialized health care systems, there is little or no evidence of strong public pressure for the removal of subsidies or the privatization of health care in those countries. The political distaste for government involvement in health care in the U.S. is a unique counter to the trend found in other developed countries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}{{Dubious|date=September 2009}}

In the United States, neither of the main parties favors a socialized system that puts the government in charge of hospitals or doctors, but they do have different approaches to financing and access. Democrats tend to be favorably inclined towards reform that involves more government control over health care financing and citizens' right of access to health care. Republicans are broadly in favor of the status quo, or a reform of the financing system that gives more power to the citizen, often through tax credits.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Supporters of government involvement in health care argue that government involvement ensures access, quality, and addresses [[market failure]]s&lt;ref&gt;Office of Health Economics (UK), [http://www.oheschools.org/ohe.pdf The Economics of Health Care] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530154951/http://www.oheschools.org/ohe.pdf |date=2008-05-30 }}, Section 3.i, "Market Failure: an Overview," p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; specific to the health care markets. When the government covers the cost of health care, there is no need for individuals or their employers to pay for private insurance.&lt;!--If I'm reading the source correctly, it's oriented towards a British discussion of the NHS.  While it uses the U.S. system as a case study, it's used to illustrate certain issues for a predominately British audience.

Opponents also claim that the absence of a market mechanism may slow innovation in treatment and research.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Both sides have also looked to more philosophical arguments, debating whether people have a fundamental [[Rights|right]] to have health care provided to them by their government.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

===Cost of care===
Socialized medicine amongst industrialized countries tends to be more affordable than in systems where there is little government involvement. A 2003 study examined costs and outputs in the U.S. and other industrialized countries and broadly concluded that the U.S. spends so much because its health care system is more costly. It noted that "the United States spent considerably more on health care than any other country&amp;nbsp;... [yet] most measures of aggregate utilization such as physician visits per capita and hospital days per capita were below the OECD median. Since spending is a product of both the goods and services used and their prices, this implies that much higher prices are paid in the United States than in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=Gerard F. |last2=Reinhardt |first2=Uwe E. |last3=Hussey |first3=Peter S. |last4=Petrosyan |first4=Varduhi |title=It's the prices, stupid: why the United States is so different from other countries |journal=Health Affairs |date=May 2003 |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=89–105 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.22.3.89|doi-access=free |pmid=12757275}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers examined possible reasons and concluded that input costs were high (salaries, cost of pharmaceutical), and that the complex payment system in the U.S. added higher administrative costs. Comparison countries in Canada and Europe were much more willing to exert [[monopsony]] power to drive down prices, whilst the highly fragmented buy side of the U.S. health system was one factor that could explain the relatively high prices in the United States of America.  The current [[fee-for-service]] payment system also stimulates expensive care by promoting procedures over visits through financially rewarding the former ($1,500 – for doing a 10-minute procedure) vs. the latter ($50 – for a 30–45 minute visit).{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} This causes the proliferation of specialists (more expensive care) and creating, what [[Donald Berwick|Don Berwick]] refers to as, "the world's best healthcare system for rescue care".{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Other studies have found no consistent and systematic relationship between the type of financing of health care and cost containment; the efficiency of operation of the health care system itself appears to depend much more on how providers are paid and how the delivery of care is organized than on the method used to raise these funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink1=Sherry Glied |first=Sherry A. |last=Glied |title=Health Care Financing, Efficiency, and Equity |date=March 2008 |work=NBER Working Paper No. 13881 |doi=10.3386/w13881 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some supporters argue that government involvement in health care would reduce costs not just because of the exercise of monopsony power, e.g. in drug purchasing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pnhp.org/facts/singlepayer_faq.php#drug_prices|title=Single Payer FAQ - Physicians for a National Health Program|author=|date=|website=pnhp.org|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026121131/http://www.pnhp.org/facts/singlepayer_faq.php#drug_prices|archivedate=26 October 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also because it eliminates profit margins and administrative overhead associated with private insurance, and because it can make use of [[economies of scale]] in administration.  In certain circumstances, a volume purchaser may be able to guarantee sufficient volume to reduce overall prices while providing greater profitability to the seller, such as in so-called "[[Advance market commitments|purchase commitment]]" programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Löfgren |first1=Hans |title=Purchase commitments: Big business bias or solution to the ‘neglected diseases’ dilemma? |journal=Australian Review of Public Affairs |date=31 October 2005 |url=http://www.australianreview.net/digest/2005/10/lofgren.html |accessdate=2018-04-27 |issn=1832-1526|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180422072411/http://www.australianreview.net/digest/2005/10/lofgren.html|archivedate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=June 2008}} Economist [[Arnold Kling]] attributes the present cost crisis mainly to the practice of what he calls ''premium medicine'', which overuses expensive forms of technology that is of marginal or no proven benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Arnold S. |last=Relman |title=Book Review: ''Crisis of Abundance: Rethinking How We Pay for Health Care'' |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=355 |issue= |pages=1073–1074 |date=2006 |doi=10.1056/NEJMbkrev57033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Milton Friedman]] has argued that government has weak incentives to reduce costs because "nobody spends somebody else’s money as wisely or as frugally as he spends his own".&lt;ref name="How to Cure Health Care"&gt;Milton Friedman, [http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/3459466.html How to Cure Health Care] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080426072208/http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/3459466.html |date=2008-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others contend that health care consumption is not like other consumer consumption. Firstly there is a negative utility of consumption (consuming more health care does not make one better off) and secondly there is an [[information asymmetry]] between consumer and supplier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blomqvist |first=Åke |last2=Léger |first2=Pierre Thomas |year=2005 |title=Information asymmetry, insurance and the decision to hospitalize |journal=[[Journal of Health Economics]] |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=775–93 |doi=10.1016/j.jhealeco.2004.12.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Krugman]] and [[Robin Wells (economist)|Robin Wells]] argue that all of the evidence indicates that public insurance of the kind available in several European countries achieves equal or better results at much lower cost, a conclusion that also applies within the United States. In terms of actual administrative costs, Medicare spent less than 2% of its resources on administration, while private insurance companies spent more than 13%.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Krugman and Robin Wells, [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18802 "The Health Care Crisis and What to Do About It"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627092738/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18802 |date=2007-06-27 }}, The New York Review of Books, Volume 53, Number 5, March 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cato Institute]] argues that the 2% Medicare cost figure ignores all costs shifted to doctors and hospitals, and alleges that Medicare is not very efficient at all when those costs are incorporated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=John Goodman | title=Five Myths of Socialized Medicine | work=[[Cato Institute]] | date=Winter 2005 | url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/catosletter/catosletterv3n1.pdf | format=PDF | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230100531/https://www.cato.org/pubs/catosletter/catosletterv3n1.pdf | archivedate=2006-12-30 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have found that the U.S. wastes more on bureaucracy (compared to the Canadian level), and that this excess administrative cost would be sufficient to provide health care to the uninsured population in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Summary of New England Journal of Medicine Study, [http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/8800.php USA wastes more on health care bureaucracy than it would cost to provide health care to all of the uninsured] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223201811/http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/8800.php |date=2008-02-23 }}, Medical News Today, 28 May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding the arguments about Medicare, there is overall less bureaucracy in socialized systems than in the present mixed U.S. system. Spending on administration in Finland is 2.1% of all health care costs, and in the UK the figure is 3.3% whereas the U.S. spends 7.3% of all expenditures on administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Figure 14.

===Quality of care===
Some in the U.S. claim that socialized medicine would reduce health care quality. The quantitative evidence for this claim is not clear. The WHO has used Disability Adjusted Life Expectancy (the number of years an average person can expect to live in good health) as a measure of a nation's health achievement, and has ranked its member nations by this measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/whr00_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718144538/http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/whr00_en.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-18 |df= }} WHO. World Health Report 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  The U.S. ranking was 24th, worse than similar industrial countries with high public funding of health such as Canada (ranked 5th), the UK (12th), Sweden (4th), France (3rd) and Japan (1st). But the U.S. ranking was better than some other European countries such as Ireland, Denmark and Portugal, which came 27th, 28th and 29th respectively. Finland, with its relatively high death rate from guns and renowned high suicide rate came above the U.S. in 20th place. The British have a [[Care Quality Commission]] that commissions independent surveys of the quality of care given in its health institutions and these are publicly accessible over the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhssurveys.org|title=NHS Surveys :: Focused on patients' experience :: Home|author=|date=|website=www.nhssurveys.org|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180307201512/http://nhssurveys.org/|archivedate=7 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These determine whether health organizations are meeting public standards for quality set by government and allows regional comparisons. Whether these results indicate a better or worse situation to that in other countries such as the U.S. is hard to tell because these countries tend to lack a similar set of standards.

===Taxation===
Opponents claim that socialized medicine would require higher taxes but international comparisons do not support this; the ratio of public to private spending on health is lower in the U.S. than that of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, or any EU country, yet the per capita tax funding of health in those countries is already lower than that of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_20072008_EN_Indicator_tables.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226204118/http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/hdr_20072008_en_indicator_tables.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-26 |df= }} UN Human Development Report 2007/2008 Table 6 Page 247&lt;/ref&gt;

Taxation is not necessarily an unpopular form of funding for health care. In England, a survey for the [[British Medical Association]] of the general public showed overwhelming support for the tax funding of health care. Nine out of ten people agreed or strongly agreed with a statement that the NHS should be funded from taxation with care being free at the point of use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bma.org.uk/ap.nsf/AttachmentsByTitle/PDFnhssystreform2007/$FILE/48751Surveynhsreform.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227150902/http://www.bma.org.uk/ap.nsf/AttachmentsByTitle/PDFnhssystreform2007/%24FILE/48751Surveynhsreform.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-27 |df= }} Survey of the general public’s views on NHS system reform - in England: BMA June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[opinion piece]] in ''The Wall Street Journal'' by two conservative Republicans argues that government sponsored health care will legitimatize support for government services generally, and make an activist government acceptable. "Once a large number of citizens get their health care from the state, it dramatically alters their attachment to government. Every time a tax cut is proposed, the guardians of the new medical-welfare state will argue that tax cuts would come at the expense of health care -- an argument that would resonate with middle-class families entirely dependent on the government for access to doctors and hospitals."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123207075026188601 Beware of the Big-Government Tipping Point] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120205305/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123207075026188601 |date=2018-01-20 }}, [[Peter Wehner]] and Paul Ryan, The Wall Street Journal, January 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Innovation===
Some in the U.S. argue that if government were to use its size to bargain down health care prices, this would undermine American leadership in medical innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Tyler Cowen, [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/05/business/05scene.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin "Poor U.S. Scores in Health Care Don’t Measure Nobels and Innovation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708213302/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/05/business/05scene.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin |date=2011-07-08 }}, ''The New York Times'', October 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julie Chan, [http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=4664 "We're Number 37 in Health Care!"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411014948/http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=4664 |date=2008-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that the high level of spending in the U.S. health care system and its tolerance of waste is actually beneficial because it underpins American leadership in medical innovation, which is crucial not just for Americans, but for the entire world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Kling   | first = Arnold   | author-link = Arnold Kling  | title = Two health-care documentaries | periodical = The Washington Times   | date = June 30, 2007   | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others point out that the American health care system spends more on state-of-the-art treatment for people who have good insurance, and spending is reduced on those lacking it&lt;ref&gt;Paul Krugman, Robin Wells, [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18802 "The Health Care Crisis and What to Do About It"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627092738/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18802 |date=2007-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and question the costs and benefits of some medical innovations, noting, for example, that "rising spending on new medical technologies designed to address heart disease has not meant that more patients have survived."&lt;ref&gt;Maggie Mahar, [http://alternet.org/story/81142/?page=1 The Mythology of Boomers Bankrupting Our Healthcare System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214142005/http://www.alternet.org/story/81142/?page=1 |date=2009-02-14 }}, Health Beat, April 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access===
One of the goals of socialized medicine systems is ensuring universal access to health care. Opponents of socialized medicine say that access for low-income individuals can be achieved by means other than socialized medicine, for example, income-related subsidies can function without public provision of either insurance or medical services. Economist [[Milton Friedman]] said the role of the government in health care should be restricted to financing hard cases.&lt;ref name="How to Cure Health Care"/&gt; Universal coverage can also be achieved by making purchase of insurance compulsory. For example, European countries with socialized medicine in the broader sense, such as [[Healthcare in Germany|Germany]] and [[Health care in the Netherlands|The Netherlands]], operate in this way. A legal obligation to purchase health insurance is akin to a mandated health tax, and the use of public subsidies is a form of directed [[income redistribution]] via the tax system{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}. Such systems give the consumer a free choice amongst competing insurers whilst achieving universality to a government directed minimum standard.

Compulsory health insurance or savings are not limited to so-called socialized medicine, however. Singapore's health care system, which is often referred to as a [[free-market]] or [[Mixed economy|mixed]] system, makes use of a combination of compulsory participation and state price controls to achieve the same goals.&lt;ref name="Watson Wyatt Singapore"&gt;John Tucci, [http://www.watsonwyatt.com/europe/pubs/healthcare/render2.asp?ID=13850 "The Singapore health system – achieving positive health outcomes with low expenditure"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121210052940/http://www.watsonwyatt.com/europe/pubs/healthcare/render2.asp?ID=13850 |date=2012-12-10 }}, Watson Wyatt Healthcare Market Review, October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rationing (access, coverage, price, and time)===
{{See also|Healthcare rationing in the United States}}

Part of the current debate about [[health care in the United States]] revolves around whether the [[Affordable Care Act]] as part of [[health care reform in the United States|health care reform]] will result in a more systematic and logical allocation of health care. Opponents tend to believe that the law will eventually result in a government takeover of health care and ultimately to socialized medicine and rationing based not on being able to afford the care you want but on whether a third party other than the patient and the doctor decides whether the procedure or the cost is justifiable. Supporters of reform point out that health care rationing already exists in the United States through insurance companies either denying coverage for [[pre-existing condition]]s or applying differential pricing for this coverage, or issuing denial for reimbursement on the grounds that the insurance company believes the procedure is [[Medical research|experimental]] or will not assist even though the doctor has recommended it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kmbc.com/r/6882159/detail.html Man Dies After Insurance Co.

Opponents of reform invoke the term socialized medicine because they say it will lead to health care rationing by denial of coverage, denial of access, and use of waiting lists, but often do so without acknowledging coverage denial, lack of access and waiting lists exist in the U.S. health care system currently&lt;ref&gt;"95,000+ U.S. patients are currently waiting for an organ transplant; nearly 4,000 new patients are added to the waiting list each month. Every day, 17 people die while waiting for a transplant of a vital organ, such as a heart, liver, kidney, pancreas, lung or bone marrow. Because of the lack of available donors in this country, 3,916 kidney patients, 1,570 liver patients, 356 heart patients and 245 lung patients died in 2006 while waiting for life-saving organ transplants:National Kidney Foundation http://www.kidney.org/news/newsroom/fs_new/25factsorgdon&amp;trans.cfm {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711030138/http://www.kidney.org/news/newsroom/fs_new/25factsorgdon%26trans.cfm |date=2009-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or that waiting lists in the U.S. are sometimes longer than the waiting lists in countries with socialized medicine.&lt;ref&gt;"Right now more than 8,000 people in the UK need an organ transplant that could save or improve their life. But each year around 400 people die while waiting for a transplant". National Kidney Federation. {{cite web |url=http://www.kidney.org.uk/donor.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223044349/http://www.kidney.org.uk/donor.html |archivedate=2010-02-23 |df= }}. (Note: The UK population is about one sixth the size of the U.S. population).&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the reform proposal point out a public insurer is not akin to a socialized medicine system because it will have to negotiate rates with the medical industry just as other insurers do and cover its cost with premiums charged to policyholders just as other insurers do without any form of subsidy.

There is a frequent misunderstanding to think that waiting happens in places like the United Kingdom and Canada but does not happen in the United States. For instance it is not uncommon even for emergency cases in some U.S. hospitals to be boarded on beds in hallways for 48 hours or more due to lack of inpatient beds&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last = GIFFIN  | author2 = SHARI M.

Between 1993 and 2003, the total number of hospitals in the United States decreased by 703, the number of hospital beds dropped by 198,000, and the number of EDs fell by 425. The result has been serious overcrowding. If the beds in a hospital are filled, patients cannot be transferred from the ED to inpatient units. This can lead to the practice of “boarding” patients—holding them in the ED, often in beds in hallways, until an inpatient bed becomes available.

&lt;/ref&gt; and people in the U.S. rationed out by being unable to afford their care are simply never counted and may never receive the care they need, a factor that is often overlooked. Statistics about waiting times in national systems are an honest approach to the issue of those waiting for access to care. Everyone waiting for care is reflected in the data, which, in the UK for example, are used to inform debate, decision-making and research within the government and the wider community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=1091|title=What does the Department of Health do? - Health Questions - NHS Direct&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=nhsdirect.nhs.uk|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031075726/http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=1091|archivedate=31 October 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/indicat/index_e.html|title=Health Indicators - Canada.ca|first=Health|last=Canada|date=|website=www.hc-sc.gc.ca|accessdate=27 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513015835/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/indicat/index_e.html|archivedate=13 May 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.18weeks.nhs.uk/endwaiting/documents/EWCL_patient_LON_280907.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012102149/http://www.18weeks.nhs.uk/endwaiting/documents/EWCL_patient_LON_280907.pdf |archivedate=2009-10-12 |df= }} Setting new standards for your care: 2007 NHS patient leaflet on the 18 week maximum wait time promise for Dec 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Some people in the U.S. are rationed out of care by unaffordable care or denial of access by [[Health maintenance organization|HMOs]] and insurers or simply because they cannot afford co-pays or deductibles even if they have insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/19/magazine/19healthcare-t.html?_r=3&amp;pagewanted=all | title=Why we must Ration Health Care | work=[[New York Times]] | date=July 15, 2009 | quote=But if the stories ... lead us to think badly of the British system of rationing health care, we should remind ourselves that the U.S. system also results in people going without life-saving treatment&amp;nbsp;— it just does so less visibly.

Opponents of the current reform care proposals fear that U.S. comparative effective research (a plan introduced in the stimulus bill) will be used to curtail spending and ration treatments, which is one function of the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE), arguing that rationing by market pricing rather by government is the best way for care to be rationed. However, when defining any group scheme, the same rules must apply to everyone in the scheme so some coverage rules had to be established. Britain has a national budget for public funded health care, and recognizes there has to be a logical trade off between spending on expensive treatments for some against, for example, caring for sick children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/03/health/03nice.html?_r=3&amp;hp=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515102140/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/03/health/03nice.html?_r=3&amp;hp=&amp;pagewanted=all |archivedate=2013-05-15 |df= }} Quote "Britain’s National Health Service provides 95 percent of the nation’s care from an annual budget, so paying for costly treatments means less money for, say, sick children." from NY Times article Dec 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; NICE is therefore applying the same market pricing principles to make the hard job of deciding between funding some treatments and not funding others on behalf of everyone in the insured pool. This rationing does not preclude choice of obtaining insurance coverage for excluded treatment as insured persons do having the choice to take out supplemental health insurance for drugs and treatments that the NHS does not cover (at least one private insurer offers such a plan) or from meeting treatment costs out-of-pocket.

The debate in the U.S. over rationing has enraged some in the UK and statements made by politicians such as [[Sarah Palin]] and [[Chuck Grassley]] resulted in a mass Internet protest on websites such as Twitter and Facebook under the banner title "welovetheNHS" with positive stories of NHS experiences to counter the negative ones being expressed by these politicians and others and by certain media outlets such as ''Investor's Business Daily'' and Fox News.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2009/08/14/welove-thenhs-115875-21595748/The Mirror (UK newspaper) on public reaction and rage in UK to Palin, Grassley, IBD, and Fox (Hanan) interviews intended to denigrate the NHS&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, it is private health insurers that ration care (in the sense of not covering the most common services such as access to a primary care physician or excluding pre-existing conditions) rather than the NHS. Free access to a general practitioner is a core right in the NHS, but private insurers in the UK will not pay for payments to a private primary care physician.&lt;ref name="ABI"/&gt; Private insurers exclude many of the most common services as well as many of the most expensive treatments, whereas the vast majority of these are not excluded from the NHS but are obtainable at no cost to the patient. According to the [[Association of British Insurers]] (ABI), a typical policy will exclude the following: going to a general practitioner; going to [[Emergency department|accident and emergency]]; drug abuse; HIV/AIDS; normal pregnancy; gender reassignment; mobility aids, such as wheelchairs; organ transplant; injuries arising from dangerous hobbies (often called hazardous pursuits); pre-existing conditions; dental services; outpatient drugs and dressings; deliberately self-inflicted injuries; infertility; cosmetic treatment; experimental or unproven treatment or drugs; and war risks. Chronic illnesses, such as [[diabetes]] and [[Chronic kidney disease|end stage renal disease]] requiring [[dialysis]] are also excluded from coverage.&lt;ref name="ABI"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abi.org.uk/Information/Consumers/Health_and_Protection/496.pdf|title=Are you buying private medical insurance?

Palin had alleged that America will create rationing "[[death panels]]" to decide whether old people could live or die, again widely taken to be a reference to NICE. U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley alleged that he was told that Senator [[Edward Kennedy]] would have been refused the brain tumor treatment he was receiving in the United States had he instead lived a country with government run health care. This, he alleged, would have been due to rationing because of Kennedy's age (77 years) and the high cost of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Audio of Senator Grassly repeating allegation Sen Kennedy would not receive care in the UK on grounds of his age. {{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZK8ffUpL60 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414063816/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZK8ffUpL60 |archivedate=2016-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The UK Department of Health said that Grassley’s claims were "just wrong" and reiterated health service in Britain provides health care on the basis of clinical need regardless of age or ability to pay. The chairman of the British Medical Association, Hamish Meldrum, said he was dismayed by the "jaw-droppingly untruthful attacks" made by American critics. The chief executive of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), told ''The Guardian'' newspaper that "it is neither true, nor is it anything you could extrapolate from anything we've ever recommended" that Kennedy would be denied treatment by the NHS.&lt;ref name="foreignpolicy.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/08/18/the_most_outrageous_us_lies_about_global_healthcare?page=0,0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728041712/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/08/18/the_most_outrageous_us_lies_about_global_healthcare?page=0,0 |archivedate=2013-07-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The business journal ''Investor's Business Daily'' recently claimed mathematician and astrophysicist [[Stephen Hawking]], who has ALS and speaks with the aid of an American-accented voice synthesizer, would not have survived if he had been treated in the British National Health Service.

Some argue that countries with national health care may use waiting lists as a form of rationing compared to countries that ration by price, such as the United States, according to several commentators and healthcare experts.&lt;ref name=patel/&gt;&lt;ref name=scoring/&gt;&lt;ref name=JPE/&gt; ''The Washington Post'' columnist [[Ezra Klein]] compared 27% of Canadians reportedly waiting four months or more for [[elective surgery]] with 26% of Americans reporting that they did not fulfill a [[Medical prescription|prescription]] due to cost (compared to only 6% of Canadians).&lt;ref name=ezra&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2009/06/a_rational_look_at_rationing.html|title=A Rational Look At Rationing|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|accessdate=September 7, 2009|date=June 17, 2009|author=Ezra Klein|authorlink=Ezra Klein}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=David |last=Gratzer |title=Canada's ObamaCare Precedent |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124451570546396929 |work=[[OpinionJournal.com]] |publisher=''The Wall Street Journal'' |date=June 9, 2009 |accessdate=September 1, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322085442/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124451570546396929 |archivedate=March 22, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain's former age-based policy that once prevented the use of [[kidney dialysis]] as treatment for older patients with renal problems, even to those who can privately afford the costs, has been cited as another example.&lt;ref name=patel&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XX_-rB07oP0C&amp;pg=PA360&amp;dq=Health+Care+Rationing#v=onepage&amp;q=Health%20Care%20Rationing|title=Health Care Politics and Policy in America|author1=Kant Patel|author2=Mark E.

Supporters of private price rationing over waiting time rationing, such as ''[[The Atlantic]]'' columnist [[Megan McArdle]], argue time rationing leaves patients worse off since their time (measured as an [[opportunity cost]]) is worth much more than the price they would pay.&lt;ref name=McArdle&gt;[http://business.theatlantic.com/2009/08/rationing_by_any_other_name.php "Rationing By Any Other Name"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903182419/http://business.theatlantic.com/2009/08/rationing_by_any_other_name.php |date=2009-09-03 }}. By [[Megan McArdle]]. ''[[The Atlantic]]''. Published August 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents also state categorizing patients based on factors such as social value to the community or age will not work in a heterogeneous society without a common ethical consensus such as the U.S.&lt;ref name=patel/&gt; [[Doug Bandow]] of the [[CATO Institute]] wrote that government decision making would "override the differences in preferences and circumstances" for individuals and that it is a matter of personal liberty to be able to buy as much or as little care as one wants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Doug Bandow|title=Uwe Reinhardt on Health Care Rationing|publisher=[[CATO Institute]]|url=http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2009/07/06/uwe-reinhardt-on-health-care-rationing/|accessdate=September 7, 2009|authorlink=Doug Bandow|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906173825/http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2009/07/06/uwe-reinhardt-on-health-care-rationing/|archivedate=September 6, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither argument recognizes the fact that in most countries with socialized medicine, a parallel system of private health care allows people to pay extra to reduce their waiting time. The exception is that some provinces in Canada disallow the right to bypass queuing unless the matter is one in which the rights of the person under the constitution.

A 1999 article in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'', stated "there is much merit in using waiting lists as a rationing mechanism for elective health care if the waiting lists are managed efficiently and fairly."&lt;ref name=scoring&gt;[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1114887 Points for pain: waiting list priority scoring systems] by Rhiannon Tudor Edwards.

Some argue that waiting lists result in great pain and suffering, but again evidence for this is unclear. In a recent survey of patients admitted to hospital in the UK from a waiting list or by planned appointment, only 10% reported they felt they should have been admitted sooner than they were. 72% reported the admission was as timely as they felt necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.healthcarecommission.org.uk/_db/_documents/Full_2007_results_with_historical_comparisons_-_tables.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029031549/http://www.healthcarecommission.org.uk/_db/_documents/Full_2007_results_with_historical_comparisons_-_tables.doc |archivedate=2008-10-29 |df= }} Healthcare Commission: 'Survey of adult inpatients in the NHS 2007'&lt;/ref&gt; Medical facilities in the U.S. do not report waiting times in national statistics as is done in other countries and it is a myth to believe there is no waiting for care in the U.S. Some argue that wait times in the U.S. could actually be as long as or longer than in other countries with universal health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_28/b4042072.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007064527/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_28/b4042072.htm |archivedate=2008-10-07 |df= }} ''Business Week'': The doctor will see you in 3 months&lt;/ref&gt;

There is considerable argument about whether any of the health bills currently before congress will introduce rationing. [[Howard Dean]] for example contested in an interview that they do not. However, ''[[Politico]]'' has pointed out that all health systems contain elements of rationing (such as coverage rules) and the public health care plan will therefore implicitly involve some element of rationing.&lt;ref name=scott/&gt;&lt;ref name=dean&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/25/howard-dean/rationing-health-care-reform/|title=There's rationing in health care now, and there still would be under reform bill|publisher=[[PolitiFact]]|accessdate=September 7, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830200720/http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/25/howard-dean/rationing-health-care-reform/|archivedate=August 30, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political interference and targeting===
In the UK, where government employees or government-employed sub-contractors deliver most health care, political interference is quite hard to discern. Most supply-side decisions are in practice under the control of medical practitioners and of boards comprising the medical profession. There is some antipathy towards the target-setting by politicians in the UK. Even the NICE criteria for public funding of medical treatments were never set by politicians. Nevertheless, politicians have set targets, for instance to reduce waiting times and to improve choice.  Academics have pointed out that the claims of success of the targeting are statistically flawed.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.cass.city.ac.uk/press/press_release_pdfs/A&amp;E%20waiting%20targets%20-%20Les%20Mayhew.pdf Cass Business School: Academics challenge A&amp;E waiting times] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910021448/http://www.cass.city.ac.uk/press/press_release_pdfs/A%26E%20waiting%20targets%20-%20Les%20Mayhew.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The veracity and significance of the claims of targeting interfering with clinical priorities are often hard to judge. For example, some UK ambulance crews have complained that hospitals would deliberately leave patients with ambulance crews to prevent an accident and emergency department (A&amp;E, or emergency room) target-time for treatment from starting to run. The Department of Health vehemently denied the claim, because the A&amp;E time begins when the ambulance arrives at the hospital and not after the handover. It defended the A&amp;E target by pointing out that the percentage of people waiting four hours or more in A&amp;E had dropped from just under 25% in 2004 to less than 2% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7249514.stm BBC News:Anger at 'patient stacking' claim] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517174557/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7249514.stm |date=2008-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original ''Observer'' article reported that in London, 14,700 ambulance turnarounds were longer than an hour and 332 were more than two hours when the target turnaround time is 15 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/feb/17/health.nhs1 copy of original Observer story from Guardian website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160718130903/https://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/feb/17/health.nhs1 |date=2016-07-18 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the context of the total number of emergency ambulance attendances by the [[London Ambulance Service]] each year (approximately 865,000),&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/publications/areport/London%20Ambulance%20Service%20AR%2006-07.pdf http://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/publications/areport/London%20Ambulance%20Service%20AR%2006-07.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029031548/http://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/publications/areport/London%20Ambulance%20Service%20AR%2006-07.pdf |date=2008-10-29 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; these represent just 1.6% and 0.03% of all ambulance calls. The proportion of these attributable to patients left with ambulance crews is not recorded. At least one junior doctor has complained that the four-hour A&amp;E target is too high and leads to unwarranted actions that are not in the best interests of patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4631793.stm | work=BBC News | title=Minister blasted over A&amp;E target | date=June 28, 2005 | accessdate=May 23, 2010 | first=Nick | last=Triggle | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030192743/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4631793.stm | archivedate=October 30, 2007 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political targeting of waiting-times in Britain has had dramatic effects. The [[National Health Service]] reports that the median admission wait-time for elective inpatient treatment (non-urgent hospital treatment) in England at the end of August 2007, was just under 6 weeks, and 87.5% of patients were admitted within 13 weeks. Reported waiting times in England also overstate the true waiting-time. This is because the clock starts ticking when the patient has been referred to a specialist by the GP and it only stops when the medical procedure is completed. The 18-week maximum waiting period target thus includes all the time taken for the patient to attend the first appointment with the specialist, time for any tests called for by the specialist to determine precisely the root of the patient's problem and the best way to treat it. It excludes time for any intervening steps deemed necessary prior to treatment, such as recovery from some other illness or the losing of excessive weight.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42765">The movement to start school later consists of efforts by health care professionals, sleep scientists, educators, economists, legislators, parents, students, and other concerned citizens to restore a later start to the school day. Based on a growing body of evidence that starting middle and high schools too early in the morning is unhealthy, counterproductive, and incompatible with adolescent sleep needs and patterns. During the second half of the 20th century, many public schools in the United States began shifting instructional time earlier than the more conventional bell time, thought{{By whom|date=March 2017}} to be about 9&amp;nbsp;a.m. Today it is common for American schools to begin the instructional day in the 7&amp;nbsp;a.m. hour and end about seven hours later, around 2&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = School Start 3Times for Middle School and High School Students — United States, 1738 School Year|url = https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6430a1.htm?s_cid=mm6430a1_e|website = www.cdc.gov|access-date = August 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most sleep research suggests that morning classes should begin no earlier than 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. for middle and high school students.&lt;ref name="Group peds.2014-1697"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = School Start Times for Adolescents|url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/08/19/peds.2014-1697|journal = Pediatrics|date = August 25, 2014|issn = 0031-4005|pmid = 25156998|pages = peds.2014-1697|doi = 10.1542/peds.2014-1697|language = en|first = Adolescent Sleep Working|last = Group|first2 = And Council on School Health|last2 = Committee on Adolescence|volume=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of a return to later school start times argue that sleep and school hours should be viewed as a public health issue, citing evidence linking early school start times to widespread [[sleep deprivation]] among teenagers as well as a wide array of acute and chronic physical, psychological, and educational problems. Not only do students consistently get significantly more sleep on school nights when their schools move to later start times, but later school hours have been consistently linked with improved school performance, reduced impulsiveness, and greater motivation, as well as with lower rates of depression, tardiness, truancy, and morning automobile accidents.&lt;ref name="Group peds.2014-1697"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = School Start Times for Middle School and High School Students — United States, 2011–12 School Year|url = https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6430a1.htm?s_cid=mm6430a1_ev|website = www.cdc.gov|access-date = August 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent (2011) studies suggest that early school start times disproportionately hurt economically disadvantaged students and may even negatively impact future earning potential of students, offsetting any financial savings to the school system attributed to earlier hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teensneedsleep.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/jacob-and-rockoff-organizing-schools-to-improve-student-achievement.pdf|title=Jacob &amp; Rockoff, "Organizing Schools to Improve Student Achievement: Start Times, Grade Configurations, and Teacher Assignments", Hamilton Project, Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution, September 2011|website=Wordpress.com|access-date=October 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the early 1990s, the [[University of Minnesota]]'s landmark School Start Time Study tracked high school students from two Minneapolis-area districts – [[Edina, Minnesota|Edina]], a suburban district that changed its opening hour from 7:20&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. and the [[Minneapolis Public Schools]], which changed their opening from 7:20&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 8:40&amp;nbsp;a.m. Many positive benefits to students were found, including:
* Improved attendance and enrollment rates
* Less sleeping in class
* Less student-reported depression
* Fewer student visits to school counselors for behavioral and peer issues
* More even temperament at home

A longitudinal follow-up study of the Minneapolis Public Schools after five years revealed that these and other positive benefits had persisted. In 2014, a three-year project using data from more than 9,000 students attending eight high schools in three states, found that when schools switched to a start time of 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. or later, attendance, [[standardized test]] scores and academic performance improved, and tardiness, substance abuse, symptoms of depression, consumption of caffeinated drinks, and the rate of traffic accidents involving teen drivers decreased.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/11299/162769/1/Impact%20of%20Later%20Start%20Time%20Final%20Report.pdf Kyla L.

== Shifted Circadian Rhythms and Sleep Deprivation ==
Proponents of a return to later school hours cite abundant evidence that starting middle and high school before about 8:30 or 9&amp;nbsp;a.m. is incompatible with the [[biological clocks]] of teenagers and young adults.&lt;ref&gt;National Sleep Foundation. Backgrounder: Later School Start Times http://www.sleepfoundation.org/article/hot-topics/backgrounder-later-school-start-times&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, a team led by [[Mary Carskadon]], PhD, of [[Brown University]] showed that changes in [[circadian]] biology during [[puberty]] drive a "sleep-phase delay," a shift in the sleep-wake patterns of adolescents that leads them to fall asleep and wake up later than younger and older people. Subsequent studies have confirmed these findings, explored the impact of school start times on the sleep needs and patterns of adolescents.,&lt;ref name="McGeorgeDavid"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McGeorge | first1 = David | year = 2012 | title = Sleepless in America: School start times (Editorial) | url = | journal = Education and Health | volume = 30 | issue = 3| pages = 56–58 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and demonstrated a "phase shift" in the release of [[melatonin]] at puberty, which appears to be involved in shifting the sleep-wake cycle several hours later during the adolescent years.&lt;ref&gt;Later Start Times for High School Students, [[University of Minnesota]], June 2002, {{cite web |url=http://www.cehd.umn.edu/research/highlights/Sleep/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502065827/http://www.cehd.umn.edu/research/highlights/Sleep/ |archivedate=2014-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carskadon"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carskadon | first1 = MA | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 1980 | title = Pubertal changes in daytime sleepiness | url = | journal = Sleep | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 453–460 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carskadon | first1 = MA | last2 = Vierira | first2 = C | last3 = Acebo | first3 = C | year = 1993 | title = Association between puberty and delayed phase preference | url = | journal = Sleep | volume = 16 | issue = 3| pages = 258–262 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This same shift to a delayed phase in the release of melatonin during puberty has also been seen in other mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=21397604|pmc=3112245|year=2011|author1=Hagenauer|first1=M.

The shifted [[circadian rhythm]]s associated with puberty make it difficult, if not impossible, for many teenagers—who may have to rise at 5 or 6 a.m. to get ready and commute to school in time for 7 a.m. school bells—to get sufficient sleep on school nights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carskadon | first1 = MA | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 1998 | title = Adolescent sleep patterns, circadian timing and sleepiness at a transition to early school days | url = | journal = Sleep | volume = 21 | issue = 8| pages = 871–881 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even discounting for the distractions of homework and extracurricular demands and electronics, most adolescents find it difficult to fall asleep before about 11 p.m. or rise before about 8 a.m. In addition, they need to sleep in until 8 a.m. or so to get the 9 or more hours of sleep that most sleep research suggests they need.&lt;ref name="Carskadon" /&gt; As a result, many teenagers arrive at school sleep-deprived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hansen | first1 =  | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2005 | title = The impact of school daily schedule on adolescent sleep | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/reprint/115/6/1555.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 115 | issue = 6| pages = 1555–1561 | doi=10.1542/peds.2004-1649}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eaton | first1 = McKnight-Eily L | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2010 | title = Prevalence of insufficient, borderline, and optimal hours of sleep among high school students – United States, 2007 | url = | journal = Journal of Adolescent Health | volume = 46 | issue = | pages = 399–401 | doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2009.10.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc=2735816|year=2009|author1=Roberts|first1=R.

== Health and Safety Impact of Early School Hours ==

Due to the fact that almost 70% of teens don't get enough sleep&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search-proquest-com.ezp.tccd.edu/docview/1705538712/E237BDD4B346D7PQ/1?accountid=7079|title=TCCD Library Databases Login (EZProxy)|website=search-proquest-com.ezp.tccd.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;, there are increases in [[stimulant]] abuse, [[weight gain]], risk of [[diabetes]],&lt;ref&gt;Sleep Loss and Obesity http://startschoollater.pbworks.com/w/page/60412574/Sleep%20Loss%20and%20Obesity&lt;/ref&gt; [[immune disorders]], [[mood swings]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], and [[suicidal ideation]], as well as reduced impulse control.&lt;ref&gt;Sleep Loss and Behavioral or Emotional Issues http://startschoollater.pbworks.com/w/page/60412566/Sleep%20Loss%20and%20Behavioral%20or%20Emotional%20Issues&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Consequences of Insufficient Sleep in Adolescents {{cite web |url=http://startschoollater.pbworks.com/w/page/60412578/Consequences%20of%20Insufficient%20Sleep%20-%20Adolescents |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928092256/http://startschoollater.pbworks.com/w/page/60412578/Consequences%20of%20Insufficient%20Sleep%20-%20Adolescents |archivedate=2013-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, early school start times have been associated with [[drowsy driving]] in new teen drivers and higher car crash rates. Schools ending early in the afternoon may also increase the risk of engaging in unhealthy, risky behaviors among sleep-deprived adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lr | first1 = McKnight-Eily | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2011 | title = Relationships between hours of sleep and health-risk behaviors in US adolescent students | url = | journal = Prev Med | volume = 53 | issue = 4-5| pages = 271–273 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sending children to school before sunrise also means they must wait or walk in dark, with low visibility.&lt;ref&gt;Sleep Loss and Accidents or Injury http://startschoollater.pbworks.com/w/page/60412558/Sleep%20Loss%20and%20Accidents%20or%20Injury&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on School Performance ==

Sleep deprivation can result in low motivation, difficulty concentrating, restlessness, slowed reaction times, lack of energy, frequent errors, forgetfulness, and impaired decision-making skills. Studies, many spearheaded by Kyla Wahlstrom and her research team at [[University of Minnesota]]'s Center for Applied Research and Educational Improvement (CAREI), have tied these effects to early school start times, which, in turn, have repeatedly been linked to increased rates of tardiness, truancy, absenteeism, and dropping out.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan LA, The Effects of Sleep Deprivation on School Attendance and Dropout Rates, Sleeping Resources 2012 http://sleepingresources.com/sleep-deprivation-and-dropout-rates/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sleep Loss and Academic Achievement http://startschoollater.pbworks.com/w/page/60412535/Sleep%20Loss%20and%20Academic%20Achievement&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 a study using data from Wake County, North Carolina, showed that delaying middle school start times by one hour, from roughly 7:30 to 8:30, increases standardized test scores by at least two percentile points in math and one percentile point in reading. The effect was largest for students with below-average test scores, suggesting that later start times would narrow gaps in student achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Edwards | first1 = F | year = 2012 | title = Do schools begin too early? | url = http://educationnext.org/do-schools-begin-too-early/#.T6JrcBYJQKM.facebook | journal = Education Next | volume = 12 | issue = | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equity Impact of Early School Hours ==

The impact of later start times on school performance—including reduced [[truancy]], [[absenteeism]], and increased overall academic achievement—is approximately double in economically disadvantaged students.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob BA, Rockoff JE, Organizing Schools to Improve Student Achievement: StartTimes, Grade Configurations, and
Teacher Assignments. [[The Hamilton Project]]. [[Brookings Institution|Brookings]]: September 2011 {{cite web |url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2011/9/organization%20jacob%20rockoff/092011_organize_jacob_rockoff_paper.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215194112/http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2011/9/organization%20jacob%20rockoff/092011_organize_jacob_rockoff_paper.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This discrepancy may be explained, at least in part, by the fact that privileged students have opportunities to attend private schools (most of which start instruction after 8 a.m.) and/or save time by driving or being driven to school.

== Economic Impact of Early School Hours ==

A 2017 report by the [[RAND Corporation]] concluded that delaying school start times to 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. is a cost-effective, population-level strategy that would significantly impact public health and the U.S. economy, with benefits quickly outweighing any immediate costs. After just two years, the study conservatively projected a gain of $8.6 billion to the U.S. economy. After a decade, this gain would increase to $83 billion, and after 15 years to $140 billion, amounting to an average annual gain to the U.S. economy of $9.3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2109.html|title=Starting School Later Would Boost the Economy|date=October 29, 2017|website=RAND.org|access-date=October 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier Hamilton Project Report published by the [[Brookings Institution]] concluded that starting class later can be an immediate and inexpensive way to boost health, safety, and achievement for all students. The authors, economists Brian A. Jacob and Jonah E. Rockoff, predicted that starting high schools one hour later, at about 9 a.m., would result in roughly $17,500 in increased future earnings per student in present value—a benefit:cost ratio of at least 9:1 even when changing schedules requires upfront investment to alter bus schedules and/or accommodate later after-school activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2011/9/organization%20jacob%20rockoff/092011_organize_jacob_rockoff_paper.pdf|title=Jacob BA, Rockoff JE, Organizing Schools to Improve Student Achievement: StartTimes, Grade Configurations, and Teacher Assignments.

In England, [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]'s Sleep and Circadian Neurosciences Institute (SCNi) in 2015 began a study involving sleep education for teenagers in England and Wales. Professors [[Russell Foster (neuroscientist)|Russell Foster]] and [[Colin Espie]] with their project "Teensleep" will assess whether ten half-hour lessons in year 10 will improve academic performance and well-being. Taught by specially trained teachers, the lessons introduce scientific theory on the importance of sleep and the effects of sleep deprivation as well as techniques for stress management.  The study has been redesigned since it was originally announced; it was previously considerably more ambitious, including a later start time at about twenty-five schools, sleep education in others, both in some schools and neither in others. Students will be evaluated before and after the sleep education periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teensleep|url=http://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/research/sleep-circadian-neuroscience-institute/research-projects-4/teensleep|website=Sleep &amp; Circadian Neuroscience Institute|publisher=University of Oxford|access-date=21 April 2016|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grassroots Advocacy ==

Community groups have sporadically arisen in various school communities since the 1990s, sometimes prompting studies and reform proposals but often dying out as concerned, active families grew out of the system.&lt;ref name="McGeorgeDavid" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Snider, Terra Ziporyn Snider.

More recently, [[social media]] tools have allowed once isolated advocates to unite efforts and share resources. In fall 2011, an [[online petition]] effort galvanized a national non-profit organization, [[Start School Later]], a coalition of health professionals, sleep scientists, educators, parents, students, and other concerned citizens dedicated to increasing public awareness about the relationship between sleep and school hours and to ensuring school start times compatible with health, safety, education, and equity.

'''Subjective well-being''' ('''SWB''') is a self-reported measure of [[well-being]], typically obtained by questionnaire.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oecd.org/site/worldforum06/38331839.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160107223341/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/well-being/publications/measuring-subjective-well-being-in-the-uk.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ed Diener]] developed a tripartite model of subjective well-being in 1984, which describes how people experience the [[quality of life|quality of their lives]] and includes both [[emotion]]al reactions and [[cognitive]] judgments.&lt;ref name="Diener1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Diener|first=Ed| title= Subjective well-being|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year= 1984|volume= 95|pages=542–575|url= http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/95/3/542/|issue=3|doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.95.3.542|pmid= 6399758}}&lt;/ref&gt; It posits "three distinct but often related components of wellbeing: frequent positive [[affect (psychology)|affect]], infrequent negative [[affect (psychology)|affect]], and cognitive evaluations such as [[life satisfaction]]."&lt;ref&gt;Tov &amp; Diener (2013), ''Subjective Well-Being''. Research Collection School of Social Sciences. Paper 1395. http://ink.library.sju.edu.sg/soss_research/1395&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49658154_A_Review_of_the_Tripartite_Structure_of_Subjective_Well-Being_Implications_for_Conceptualization_Operationalization_Analysis_and_Synthesis&lt;/ref&gt;

SWB therefore encompasses [[mood (psychology)|moods]] and emotions as well as evaluations of one's satisfaction with general and specific areas of one's life.&lt;ref name=Diener1999&gt;{{cite journal|last= Diener|first=Ed |author2=Suh, E.M. |author3=Lucas, R.E. |author4=Smith, H.L|title=Subjective well-being: Three Decades of Progress|journal= Psychological Bulletin |year=1999|volume=125|pages=276–302|url =http://stat.psych.uiuc.edu/~ediener/Documents/Diener-Suh-Lucas-Smith_1999.pdf|doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.125.2.276|issue= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concepts encompassed by SWB include [[happiness]]. 

SWB tends to be stable over time&lt;ref name=Diener1999/&gt; and is strongly related to [[personality psychology|personality traits]].&lt;ref name=Steel&gt;{{cite journal|last= Steel|first=Piers |author2=Schmidt, Joseph |author3=Shultz, Jonas|title=Refining the relationship between personality and Subjective well-being|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2008|volume=134|pages=138–161|url=http://www.subjectpool.com/ed_teach/y4person/3_happiness/Steel2008_5FM_and_happiness_psych_bull.pdf|doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.134.1.138|pmid= 18193998|issue= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that health and SWB may mutually influence each other, as good health tends to be associated with greater happiness,&lt;ref name=Okunmeta-analysis/&gt; and a number of studies have found that positive emotions and [[optimism]] can have a beneficial influence on health.&lt;ref name=Dienerhealth/&gt;

==Construction of SWB==
[[Ed Diener|Diener]] et al.  argued that the various components of SWB represent distinct constructs that need to be understood separately, even though they are closely related. Hence, SWB may be considered "a general area of scientific interest rather than a single specific construct".&lt;ref name=Diener1999/&gt; Due to the specific focus on the ''subjective'' aspects of well-being, definitions of SWB typically exclude ''objective'' conditions such as material conditions or [[health]], although these can influence ratings of SWB.&lt;ref name=Diener1984/&gt; Definitions of SWB therefore focus on how a person evaluates his/her own life, including emotional experiences of [[pleasure]] versus [[suffering|pain]] in response to specific events and cognitive evaluations of what a person considers a [[Eudaimonia|good life]].&lt;ref name=Diener2000/&gt; Components of SWB relating to [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] include positive affect (experiencing pleasant emotions and moods) and low negative affect (experiencing unpleasant, distressing emotions and moods), as well as "overall affect" or "[[valence (psychology)|hedonic]] balance", defined as the overall equilibrium  between positive and negative affect, and usually measured as the difference between the two.&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt;  High positive affect and low negative affect are often highly correlated, but not always.&lt;ref name=Diener2000/&gt;

==Components of SWB==
There are two components of SWB. One is [[affect (psychology)|Affective Balance]] and the other is Life Satisfaction. An individual's scores on the two measures are summed to produce a total SWB score. In some cases, these scores are kept separate.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;
* Affective balance
Affective balance refers to the emotions, moods, and feelings a person has. These can be all positive, all negative, or a combination of both positive and negative.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt; Some research shows also that feelings of reward are separate from positive and negative affect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = M | last2 = Dolan | first2 = P | year = 2009 | title = Accounting for the richness of our daily activities | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02392.x | pmid = 19549079 | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 20 | issue = 8| pages = 1000–1008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Life satisfaction
[[Life satisfaction]] (global judgments of one's life) and satisfaction with specific life domains (e.g. work satisfaction) are considered cognitive components of SWB.&lt;ref name=Diener2000/&gt; The term "[[happiness]]" is also commonly used in regards to SWB and has been defined variously as "satisfaction of desires and goals" (therefore related to life satisfaction), as a "preponderance of positive over negative affect" (therefore related to emotional components of SWB),&lt;ref name=Diener1984/&gt; as "contentment",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Michael C.|title=Facts of Life: ten issues of contentment|date=2014|publisher=Outskirts Press|isbn=978-1-4787-2259-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a "consistent, [[optimistic]] mood state"&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt; and may imply an affective evaluation of one's life as a whole.&lt;ref name=deneve&amp;cooper&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeNeve|first=Kristina M.|author2=Cooper, Harris |title=The Happy Personality: A Meta-Analysis of 137 Personality Traits and Subjective Well-Being|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1998|volume=124|pages=197–229|url=http://www.subjectpool.com/ed_teach/y5_ID/personality/wellbeing/1998_Deneve_cooper_psych_bull.pdf|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.124.2.197|pmid=9747186|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Life satisfaction can also be known as the "stable" component in one's life.&lt;ref name=Diener1984/&gt;  Affective concepts of SWB can be considered in terms of momentary emotional states as well as in terms of longer-term moods and tendencies (i.e. how much positive and/or negative affect a person generally experiences over any given period of time).&lt;ref name=Diener1999/&gt; Life satisfaction and in some research happiness are typically considered over long durations, up to one's lifetime.&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt; "[[Quality of life]]" has also been studied as a conceptualization of SWB. Although its exact definition varies, it is usually measured as an aggregation of well-being across several life domains and may include both subjective and objective components.&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt;

===Measurement of SWB components===

Life satisfaction and Affect balance are generally measured separately and independently.&lt;ref name=Albuquerque /&gt;  
* Life satisfaction is generally measured using a self-report method. A common measurement for life satisfaction is questionnaires. 
* Affective balance is also generally measured using a self-report method. An example of a measurement of affective balance is the [[Positive and Negative Affect Schedule|PANAS]] (Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule).&lt;ref name=Albuquerque /&gt;  
Sometimes a single SWB question attempts to capture an overall picture.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. "''The most basic way of measuring it involves asking individuals how they feel about their lives - known as subjective well being. A typical question is, "Taking all things together, how happy are you?" - with possible answers from 0 (extremely unhappy) to 10 (extremely happy).''" Can Happiness be Measured?, http://www.actionforhappiness.org/why-happiness&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue with the such measurements of life satisfaction and affective balance is that they are self-reports. The problem with self-reports is that the participants may be lying or at least not telling the whole truth on the questionnaires. Participants may be lying or holding back from revealing certain things because they are either embarrassed or they may be filling in what they believe the researcher wants to see in the results. To gain more accurate results, other methods of measurement have been used to determine one’s SWB. 

Another way to corroborate or confirm that the self-report results are accurate is through informant reports.&lt;ref name=Albuquerque /&gt;  Informant reports are given to the participant’s closest friends and family and they are asked to fill out either a survey or a form asking about the participants mood, emotions, and overall lifestyle. The participant may write in the self-report that they are very happy, however that participant’s friends and family record that he/she is always depressed. This would obviously be a contradiction in results which would ultimately lead to inaccurate results. 

Another method of gaining a better understanding of the true results is through ESM, or the Experience Sampling Method.&lt;ref name=Albuquerque /&gt;  In this measure, participants are given a beeper/pager that will randomly ring throughout the day. Whenever the beeper/pager sounds, the participant will stop what he/she is doing and record the activity they are currently engaged in and their current mood and feelings. Tracking this over a period of a week or a month will give researchers a better understanding of the true emotions, moods, and feelings the participant is experiencing, and how these factors interact with other thoughts and behaviors.&lt;ref name= HGIN&gt;{{cite journal |author1=van der Krieke et al., L. | year = 2015 | title = HowNutsAreTheDutch (HoeGekIsNL): A crowdsourcing study of mental symptoms and strengths | journal = International Journal of Methods in Psychiatric Research | volume = 25| issue = 2| pages = 123–44| doi=10.1002/mpr.1495 | pmid=26395198}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third measurement to ensure validity is the Day Reconstruction Method.&lt;ref name=Albuquerque /&gt;  In this measure, participants fill out a diary of the previous days’ activities. The participant is then asked to describe each activity and provide a report of how they were feeling, what mood they were experiencing, and any emotions that surfaced. Thus to ensure valid results, a researcher may tend to use self-reports along with another form of measurement mentioned above. Someone with a high level of life satisfaction and a positive affective balance is said to have a high level of SWB.&lt;ref name=Albuquerque /&gt;

==Theories==
Theories of the causes of SWB tend to emphasise either top-down or bottom-up influences.&lt;ref name="Diener1984"/&gt;

===Top-down perspective===

In the top-down view, global features of personality influence the way a person perceives events. Individuals may therefore have a global tendency to perceive life in a consistently positive or negative manner, depending on their stable personality traits.&lt;ref name=deneve1999&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeNeve|first=Kristina M. |title=Happy as an Extraverted Clam? The Role of Personality for Subjective Well-Being

Set Point theory implies that a person's baseline or equilibrium level of SWB is a consequence of hereditary characteristics and therefore, almost entirely predetermined at birth.&lt;ref name="Happiness Is a Stochastic Phenomenon"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lykken|author2=Tellegen |title=Happiness Is a Stochastic Phenomenon|journal=Psychological Science|year=1996|volume=7|issue=3|doi= 10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00355.x |url=http://www.theiahe.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Happiness-is-a-Stochastic-Phenomenon.-by-David-Lykken-and-Auke-Tellegen.-APS.-May-1996.pdf|first1=David|pages=186–189 |citeseerx=10.1.1.613.4004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evidence for this genetic predisposition derives from behavior-genetic studies that have found that positive and negative affectivity each have high [[heritability]] (40% and 55% respectively in one study).&lt;ref name=Diener1999/&gt; Numerous twin studies confirm the notion of set point theory, however, they do not rule out the possibility that is it possible for individuals to experience long term changes in SWB.&lt;ref name="Happiness Is a Stochastic Phenomenon"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = Matt |last=McGue |author2=Bacon, Steve |author3=Lykken, David|title=Personality stability and change in early adulthood: A behavioral genetic analysis|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1993|volume=29|issue=1|pages=96–109 |url =  http://psych.colorado.edu/~carey/pdfFiles/Personality_McGue01.pdf|doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.29.1.96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diener et al. note that heritability studies are limited in that they describe long-term SWB in a sample of people in a modern [[western society]] but may not be applicable to more extreme environments that might influence SWB and do not provide absolute indicators of genetic effects. Additionally, heritability estimates are inconsistent across studies.

Further evidence for a genetically influenced predisposition to SWB comes from findings that personality has a large influence on long-term SWB. This has led to the ''dynamic equilibrium model'' of SWB. This model proposes that personality provides a baseline for emotional responses. External events may move people away from the baseline, sometimes dramatically, but these movements tend to be of limited duration, with most people returning to their baseline eventually.&lt;ref name=Diener1999/&gt;

===Bottom-up perspective===

From a bottom-up perspective, happiness represents an accumulation of happy experiences. Bottom-up influences include external events, and broad situational and demographic factors, including health and marital status. Bottom-up approaches are based on the idea that there are universal [[basic human needs]] and that happiness results from their fulfilment. In support of this view, there is evidence that daily pleasurable events are associated with increased positive affect, and daily unpleasant events or hassles are associated with increased negative affect.

However, research suggests that external events account for a much smaller proportion of the variance in self-reports of SWB than top-down factors, such as personality.&lt;ref name=Diener1999/&gt; A theory proposed to explain the limited impact of external events on SWB is hedonic adaptation.&lt;ref name=Diener2000/&gt; Based originally on the concept of a "[[hedonic treadmill]]", this theory proposes that positive or negative external events temporarily increase or decrease feelings of SWB, but as time passes people tend to become habituated to their circumstances and have a tendency to return to a personal SWB "setpoint" or baseline level.

The hedonic treadmill theory originally proposed that most people return to a neutral level of SWB (i.e. neither happy nor unhappy) as they habituate to events. However, subsequent research has shown that for most people, the baseline level of SWB is at least mildly positive, as most people tend to report being at least somewhat happy in general and tend to experience positive mood when no adverse events are occurring. Additional refinements to this theory have shown that people do not adapt to all life events equally, as people tend to adapt rapidly to some events (e.g. imprisonment), slowly to others (e.g. the death of a loved one), and not at all to others (e.g. noise and sex).&lt;ref name=Diener2000/&gt;

==Factors affecting SWB==

===Personality and genetics===
A number of studies have found that SWB constructs are strongly associated with a range of personality traits, including those in the [[five factor model]].&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt; Findings from numerous personality studies show that genetics account for 20-48% of the variance in Five-Factor Model and the variance in subjective well-being is also heritable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bouchard | first = Thomas J., Jr. |author2=Loehlin, J.C.  | year = 2001 | title = Genes, evolution, and personality | journal = Behavior Genetics | volume = 31 | pages = 243–273 | doi =  10.1023/A:1012294324713 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/qt0138g23w8720j1/ | issue = 3 | pmid = 11699599}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, [[neuroticism]] predicts poorer subjective well-being whilst [[extraversion]], [[agreeableness]], [[conscientiousness]] and [[openness to experience]] tend to predict higher subjective well-being. A [[meta-analysis]] found that neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness were significantly related to all facets of SWB examined (positive, negative, and overall affect; happiness; life satisfaction; and quality of life). Neuroticism was the strongest predictor of overall SWB and is the strongest predictor of negative affect.&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt;

A large number of personality traits are related to SWB constructs, although [[intelligence]] has negligible relationships.&lt;ref name=deneve&amp;cooper/&gt; Positive affect is most strongly predicted by extraversion, to a lesser extent agreeableness, and more weakly by openness to experience. Happiness was most strongly predicted by extraversion, and also strongly predicted by neuroticism, and to a lesser extent by the other three factors. Life satisfaction was significantly predicted by neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Quality of life was very strongly predicted by neuroticism, and also strongly predicted by extraversion and conscientiousness, and to a modest extent by agreeableness and openness to experience.&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt;   One study found that subjective well-being was genetically indistinct from personality traits, especially those that reflected emotional stability (low Neuroticism), and social and physical activity (high Extraversion), and constraint (high Conscientiousness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Weiss | first = A. |author2=Bates, T.

DeNeve (1999) argued that there are three trends in the relationship between personality and SWB. Firstly, SWB is closely tied to traits associated with emotional tendencies ([[neuroticism#Emotional stability|emotional stability]], positive affectivity, and tension). Secondly, relationship enhancing traits (e.g. [[trust (social sciences)|trust]], affiliation) are important for subjective well-being. Happy people tend to have strong relationships and be good at fostering them. Thirdly, the way people think about and explain events is important for subjective well-being. Appraising events in an [[optimistic]] fashion, having a sense of control, and making active coping efforts facilitates subjective well-being. Trust, a trait substantially related to SWB, as opposed to cynicism involves making positive rather than negative attributions about others. Making positive, optimistic attributions rather than negative pessimistic ones facilitates subjective well-being.&lt;ref name=deneve1999/&gt;

The related trait of [[eudaimonia]] or [[psychological well-being]], is also heritable. Evidence from one study supports 5 independent genetic mechanisms underlying the Ryff facets of psychological well-being, leading to a genetic construct of eudaimonia in terms of general [[self-control]], and four subsidiary biological mechanisms enabling the psychological capabilities of purpose, agency, growth, and positive social relations&lt;ref name=Archontaki2012&gt;D.

===Social influences===
{{expand section|date=December 2012}}
A person's level of subjective well-being is determined by many different factors and social influences prove to be a strong one. Results from the famous [[Framingham Heart Study]] indicate that friends three [[degrees of separation]] away (that is, friends of friends of friends) can affect a person's happiness. From abstract: "A friend who lives within a mile (about 1.6 km) and who becomes happy increases the probability that a person is happy by 25%."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fowler|first=J. H|author2=Christakis, N.

===Wealth===
Research indicates that wealth is related to many positive outcomes in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Furnham &amp; Argyle|title=The psychology of money|year=1998|publisher=Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such outcomes include: improved health and mental health,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Langner &amp; Michael|title=Life stress and mental health: The Midtown Manhattan study|year=1963|publisher=Free Press of Glencoe  (New York)}}&lt;/ref&gt; greater longevity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkinson|title=Unhealthy societies: the afflictions of inequality|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; lower rates of infant mortality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith |author2=Eikeseth |author3=Klevstrand |author4=Lovaas |title=Intensive behavioral treatment for preschoolers with severe mental retardation and pervasive developmental disorder|journal=American Journal on Mental Retardation|year=1997|volume=102|issue=3|pages=238–249|doi=10.1352/0895-8017(1997)102&lt;0238:IBTFPW&gt;2.0.CO;2|pmid=9394133|first1=T}}&lt;/ref&gt; experience fewer stressful life events,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = RM | last2 = Runciman | first2 = WB | last3 = Gibberd | first3 = RW | last4 = Harrison | first4 = BT | last5 = Newby | first5 = L | last6 = Hamilton | first6 = JD.  | year = 1995 | title = The quality in Australian health care study | url = | journal = Med J Aust | volume = 163 | issue = | pages = 458–471 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and less frequently the victims of violent crimes&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, J.

New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; However, research suggests that wealth has a smaller impact on SWB than people generally think, even though higher incomes do correlate substantially with life satisfaction reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aknin|author2=Norton, Dunn |title=From wealth to well-being? Money matters, but less than people think|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|year=2009|volume=4|issue=6|pages=523–527|doi=10.1080/17439760903271421|first1=Lara B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative influence of [[wealth]] together with other material components on overall subjective [[well-being]] of a person is being studied through new researches. The Well-being Project at Human Science Lab investigates how material [[well-being]] and [[perceptual]] well-being works as relative determinants in conditioning our [[mind]] for positive [[emotion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://humansciencelab.org.uk| title=Understanding Positive Emotions |publisher=Human Science Lab | access-date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study done by Aknin, Norton, &amp; Dunn (2009), researchers asked participants from across the income spectrum to report their own happiness and to predict the happiness of others and themselves at different income levels.  In study 1, predicted happiness ranged between 2.4-7.9 and actual happiness ranged between 5.2-7.7.  In study 2, predicted happiness ranged between 15-80 and actual happiness ranged between 50-80.  These findings show that people believe that money does more for happiness than it really does.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, M.I., Dunn, E.W., &amp; *Aknin, L.B. (2009). From wealth to well-being: Spending money on others promotes happiness. Invited talk at the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Tampa, FL&lt;/ref&gt; However, some research indicates that while [[socioeconomic]] measures of status do not correspond to greater happiness, measures of [[sociometric status]] (status compared to people encountered face-to-face on a daily basis) do correlate to increased subjective well-being, above and beyond the effects of extroversion and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=C.|author2=Kraus, M. W. |author3=Galinsky, A. D. |author4= Keltner, D. |title=The Local-Ladder Effect: Social Status and Subjective Well-Being|journal=Psychological Science|date=31 May 2012|volume=23|issue=7|pages=764–771|doi=10.1177/0956797611434537 |pmid=22653798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Easterlin Paradox also suggests that there is no connection between a society's [[economic]] development and its average level of [[happiness]].   Through time, the Easterlin has looked at the relationship between [[happiness]] and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) across countries and within countries.  There are three different phenomena to look at when examining the connection between money and Subjective well-being; rising GDP within a country, relative income within a country, and differences in GDP between countries.&lt;ref&gt;Easterlin,  Richard  A.,  1973,  Does  Money  Buy  Happiness?  The  Public  Interest,  30  (Winter),  3-10&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, when making comparisons between countries, a principle called the Diminishing Marginal Utility of Income (DMUI) stands strong.  Veenhoven (1991) said, "[W]e not only see a clear positive relationship [between happiness and GNP per capita], but also a curvilinear pattern; which suggest that wealth is subject to a law of diminishing happiness returns."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Veenhoven | first1 = Ruut | year = 1991 | title = Is Happiness Relative? | url = http://repub.eur.nl/pub/16148| journal = Social Indicators Research | volume = 24 | issue = 1| pages = 1–34 | doi=10.1007/bf00292648| format = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meaning a $1,000 increase in real income, becomes progressively smaller the higher the initial level of income, having less of an impact on subjective well-being. Easterlin (1995) proved that the DMUI is true when comparing countries, but not when looking at rising gross domestic product within countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Easterlin | first1 = Richard A. | year = 1995 | title = Will Raising the Incomes of All Increase the Happiness of All? | url = | journal = Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization | volume = 27 | issue = 1| pages = 35–48 | doi=10.1016/0167-2681(95)00003-b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
There are substantial positive associations between [[health]] and SWB so that people who rate their general health as "good" or "excellent" tend to experience better SWB compared to those who rate their health as "fair" or "poor". A meta-analysis found that self-ratings of general health were more strongly related to SWB than physician ratings of health.&lt;ref name=Okunmeta-analysis&gt;

A review of longitudinal studies found&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt; that measures of baseline subjective well-being constructs such as [[optimism]] and positive affect predicted longer-term health status and mortality. Conversely, a number of studies found that baseline [[depression (mood)|depression]] predicted poorer longer-term health status and mortality. Baseline health may well have a causal influence on subjective well-being so causality is difficult to establish.
A number of studies found that positive emotions and optimism had a beneficial impact on cardiovascular health and on immune functioning. Changes in mood are also known to be associated with changes in immune and cardiovascular response.
There is evidence that interventions that are successful in improving subjective well-being can have beneficial effects on aspects of health. For example, [[meditation]] and [[relaxation training]] have been found to increase positive affect and to reduce blood pressure. The effect of specific types of subjective well-being is not entirely clear. For example, how durable the effects of mood and emotions on health are  remains unclear. Whether some types of subjective well-being predict health independently of others is also unclear.&lt;ref name=Dienerhealth/&gt; Meditation has the power to increase happiness because it can improve self-confidence and reduces anxiety, which increases your well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Howard|title=The Pursuit of Happiness|year=1953|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultivating personal strengths and resources, like humour, social/animal company, and daily occupations, also appears to help people preserve acceptable levels of SWB despite the presence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress.&lt;ref name="BosPrSWB" /&gt;

Research suggests that probing a patient's happiness is one of the most important things a doctor can do to predict that patient's health and longevity.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;  In health-conscious modern societies, most people overlook the emotions as a vital component of one's health, while over focusing on diet and exercise. According to Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener, people who are happy become less sick than people who are unhappy. There are three types of health: morbidity, survival, and longevity.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;  Evidence suggests that all three can be improved through happiness:

# Morbidity, simply put, is whether or not someone develops a serious illness, such as the flu or cancer.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;  In a 30-year longitudinal study, participants who were high in positive emotions were found to have lower rates of many health problems. Some of these illnesses/problems include lower death rates from heart disease, suicide, accidents, homicides, mental illnesses, drug dependency, and liver disease related to alcoholism.  Additionally, results showed that depressed participants were more likely to have heart attacks and recurrences of heart attacks when compared to happy people.
# Survival is the term used for what happens to a person after he/she has already developed or contracted a serious illness.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;  Although happiness has been shown to increase health, with survival, this may not be the case. Survival may be the only area of health that evidence suggests happiness may actually be sometimes detrimental. It is unclear why exactly research results suggest this is the case, however Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener offer an explanation. It is possible that happy people fail to report symptoms of the illness, which can ultimately lead to no treatment or inadequate treatment. Another possible reason may be that happy people tend to be optimistic, leading them to take their symptoms too lightly, seek treatment too late, and/or follow the doctor’s instructions half-heartedly. And lastly, Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener suggest that people with serious illnesses may be more likely to choose to live out the rest of their days without painful or invasive treatments.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;
# Longevity, the third area of health, is measured by an individual's age of death.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;  Head researcher Deborah Danner of the University of Kentucky researched links between an individual's happiness and that individual's longevity. Danner recruited 180 Catholic nuns from a nearby convent as the participants of her study. She chose nuns because they live very similar lives. This eliminates many confounding variables that might be present in other samples, which can lead to inaccurate results. Such confounding variables could include drug use, alcohol abuse, diet, and sexual risk-taking. Since there are few differences among the nuns as far as the confounding variables, this sample offered the best option to match a controlled laboratory setting. Results showed that nuns who were considered{{by whom|date=September 2014}} happy or positive in their manner and language on average lived 10 years longer than the nuns who were considered unhappy or negative in their manner and language. A follow-up study by health researcher Sarah Pressman examined 96 famous psychologists to determine if similar results from the nun research would be seen as well. Pressman's results showed that the positive or happy psychologists lived, on average, 6 years longer. The psychologists who were considered{{by whom|date=September 2014}} negative or unhappy lived, on average, 5 years less.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;

===Physical characteristics===
A positive relationship has been found between the volume of gray matter in the right [[precuneus]] area of the brain, and the subject's subjective happiness score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep16891 | doi=10.1038/srep16891| pmid=26586449| pmc=4653620| title=The structural neural substrate of subjective happiness| journal=Scientific Reports| volume=5| pages=16891| year=2015| last1=Sato| first1=Wataru| last2=Kochiyama| first2=Takanori| last3=Uono| first3=Shota| last4=Kubota| first4=Yasutaka| last5=Sawada| first5=Reiko| last6=Yoshimura| first6=Sayaka| last7=Toichi| first7=Motomi}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 6 week [[mindfulness]] based intervention was found to correlate with a significant gray matter increase within the precuneus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 4306280 | pmid=25632405 | doi=10.17140/NOJ-1-106 | volume=1 | issue=1 | title=Brain Gray Matter Changes Associated with Mindfulness Meditation in Older Adults: An Exploratory Pilot Study using Voxel-based Morphometry | year=2014 | journal=Neuro | pages=23–26 | last1 = Kurth | first1 = F | last2 = Luders | first2 = E | last3 = Wu | first3 = B | last4 = Black | first4 = DS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leisure===
There are a number of domains that are thought to contribute to subjective well-being. In a study by Hribernik and Mussap (2010), leisure satisfaction was found to predict unique variance in life satisfaction, supporting its inclusion as a distinct life domain contributing to subjective well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hribernik | first1 = J. | last2 = Mussap | first2 = A. J. | year = 2010 | title = Research note: Leisure satisfaction and subjective well-being | url = | journal = Annals of Leisure Research | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 701–708 | doi=10.1080/11745398.2010.9686871}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, relationship status interacted with age group and gender on differences in leisure satisfaction. The relationship between leisure satisfaction and life satisfaction, however, was reduced when considering the impact of core affect (underlying mood state). This suggests that leisure satisfaction may primarily be influenced by an individual's subjective well-being level as represented by core affect. This has implications for possible limitations in the extent to which leisure satisfaction may be improved beyond pre-existing levels of well-being and mood in individuals.

===Cultural variations===

Although all cultures seem to value happiness, cultures vary in how they define happiness. There is also evidence that people in more individualistic cultures tend to rate themselves as higher in subjective well-being compared to people in more collectivistic cultures.&lt;ref name=science&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Western culture]]s, predictors of happiness include elements that support personal independence, a sense of personal agency, and self-expression. In [[Eastern culture]]s, predictors of happiness focus on an interdependent self that is inseparable from significant others. Compared to people in individualistic cultures, people in collectivistic cultures are more likely to base their judgments of life satisfaction on how significant others appraise their life than on the balance of inner emotions experienced as pleasant versus unpleasant. Pleasant emotional experiences have a stronger social component in East Asian cultures compared to Western ones. For example, people in Japan are more likely to associate happiness with interpersonally engaging emotions (such as friendly feelings), whereas people in the United States are more likely to associate happiness with interpersonally disengaging emotions (pride, for example).&lt;ref name=science/&gt; There are also cultural differences in motives and goals associated with happiness. For example, Asian Americans tend to experience greater happiness after achieving goals that are pleasing to or approved of by significant others compared to European Americans. There is also evidence that high self-esteem, a sense of personal control and a consistent sense of identity relate more strongly to SWB in Western cultures than they do in Eastern ones. However, this is not to say that these things are unimportant to SWB in Eastern cultures. Research has found that even within Eastern cultures, people with high self-esteem and a more consistent sense of identity are somewhat happier than those who are low in these characteristics. There is no evidence that low self-esteem and so on{{vague|date=September 2014}} are actually beneficial to SWB in any known culture.&lt;ref name=science/&gt;

A large body of research evidence has confirmed that people in individualistic societies report higher levels of happiness than people in collectivistic ones and that socioeconomic factors alone are insufficient to explain this difference.&lt;ref name=science/&gt; In addition to political and economic differences, individualistic versus collectivistic nations reliably differ in a variety of psychological characteristics that are related to SWB, such as emotion norms and attitudes to the expression of individual needs. Collectivistic cultures are based around the belief that the individual exists for the benefit of the larger social unit, whereas more individualistic cultures assume the opposite. Collectivistic cultures emphasise maintaining social order and harmony and therefore expect members to suppress their personal desires when necessary in order to promote collective interests. Such cultures therefore consider self-regulation more important than self-expression or than individual rights. Individualistic cultures by contrast emphasise the inalienable value of each person and expect individuals to become self-directive and self-sufficient. Although people in collectivistic cultures may gain happiness from the social approval they receive from suppressing self-interest, research seems to suggest that self-expression produces a greater happiness "payoff" compared to seeking approval outside oneself.&lt;ref name=science/&gt;

===Positive psychology===
[[Positive psychology]] is particularly concerned with the study of SWB.&lt;ref name=Diener2000&gt;{{cite journal|last= Diener|first=Ed| title= Subjective well-being: The Science of Happiness and a Proposal for a National Index|journal=American Psychologist|year=2000|volume=55|pages=34–43|url=http://mina.education.ucsb.edu/janeconoley/ed197/documents/Dienersubjectivewell-being.pdf|doi= 10.1037/0003-066X.55.1.34|pmid= 11392863|issue= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sonja"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lyubomirsky|first=Sonja|title=Why are some happier than others?

P.|citeseerx=10.1.1.183.6660 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers in positive psychology have pointed out that in almost every [[culture]] studied the pursuit of happiness is regarded as one of the most valued goals in life. Understanding [[individual differences psychology|individual differences]] in SWB is of key interest in positive psychology, particularly the issue of why some people are happier than others. Some people continue to be happy in the face of adversity whereas others are chronically unhappy at the best of times.&lt;ref name=BosPrSWB&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bos, E.H.|author2=Snippe, E.|author3=de Jonge, P.|author4=Jeronimus, B.F.| year = 2016 | title = Preserving Subjective Wellbeing in the Face of Psychopathology: Buffering Effects of Personal Strengths and Resources | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 11| issue = 3| pages = e0150867| doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0150867 | pmid=26963923|pmc=4786317}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Positive psychology has investigated how people might improve their level of SWB and maintain these improvements over the longer term, rather than returning to baseline.&lt;ref name="Sonja"/&gt; [[Sonja Lyubomirsky|Lyubomirsky]] (2001) argued that SWB is influenced by a combination of personality/genetics (studies have found that genetic influences usually account for 35-50% of the variance in happiness measures), external circumstances, and activities that affect SWB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Røysamb | first1 = E. | last2 = Harris | first2 = J. | last3 = Magnus | first3 = P. | last4 = Vittersø | first4 = J. | last5 = Tambs | first5 = K. | year = 2002 | title = Subjective well-being.

==Big picture==

===Late 1700s–1930s (pre-WWII era)===

During this pre-WWII era, there are three big trends that operate separately, but sometimes affect each other in development and outcomes.

First, a trend of urbanization (fueled by the [[Industrial Revolution]]) as well as greater global trade and migration leads to new challenges, including those in urban sanitation and infectious diseases/pandemics. Six global [[cholera]] pandemics happen in this period because of increased commerce and migration.&lt;ref name="markel"/&gt;{{rp|125}}

Second, there is a lot of development on the underlying theory of disease, advancements in vaccine and antibiotic development, and a variety of experimental large-scale eradication and control programs. One big example: the [[germ theory of diseases]] begins to become accepted and popularized starting around 1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/contagion/germtheory.html |title=Germ Theory |publisher=Harvard |accessdate=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another big example is the development of the smallpox vaccine by Edward Jenner in 1796.&lt;ref name=Baxby1999/&gt; Systematic eradication and control efforts include the [[Rockefeller Sanitary Commission]] and efforts to eradicate smallpox.&lt;ref name="cugh.org"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20150918175742/http://cugh.org/sites/default/files/content/resources/modules/To%20Post%20Both%20Faculty%20and%20Trainees/29_Global_Health_In_Historical_Perspective_The_Uses_Of_History_FINAL.pptx.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Antitoxins and vaccines for numerous diseases including [[cholera]] and [[tuberculosis]] are developed during this period, building on a trend of greater understanding of and control over [[microorganisms]].&lt;ref name="vaccine_timeline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofvaccines.org/timeline |title=Timeline – History of Vaccines |publisher=The College of Physicians of Philadelphia |accessdate=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third theme during this era is the formation of various preliminary international alliances and conferences, including the [[International Sanitary Conferences]], [[Pan American Health Organization]], [[Office International d'Hygiène Publique]], and the [[League of Nations]] Health Committee. This is closely intertwined with the other two trends. For instance, the cholera pandemics mentioned above, as well as the growing scientific understanding of the germ theory of disease, are both key impetuses for the International Sanitary Conferences.&lt;ref name="markel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://s2.medicina.uady.mx/observatorio/docs/ee/ac/EE2014_Ac_Markel.pdf |title=Worldly approaches to global health: 1851 to the present |first=Howard |last=Markel |date=January 7, 2014 |accessdate=April 5, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418174941/http://s2.medicina.uady.mx/observatorio/docs/ee/ac/EE2014_Ac_Markel.pdf |archivedate=April 18, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|125}}

===1940s–early 1960s (post-WWII era)===
Following the end of [[World War II]], the first batch of big organizations, both international and national (with international cooperation), including the [[United Nations]] and [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), form.&lt;ref name="markel"/&gt; Beginning with the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] for relief of victims of war in 1943, there is a big push to begin creating large scale health initiatives, non-governmental organizations, and worldwide global health programs by the United Nations to improve quality of life around the world. [[UNICEF]], the World Health Organization, as well as the UNRRA are all part of United Nations efforts to benefit global health beginning with developing countries. These various programs aim to aid in economic endeavors by providing loans, direct disease prevention programs, health education, etc.

===Late 1960s–1970s===

After wrapping up complications caused by the end of the war, there is an international energy put in into eradication, beginning with the complete smallpox eradication in 1979. There is greater dissatisfaction with WHO for its focus on disease/infection control at the expense of trying to improve general living conditions, as well as disappointment at its low budget and staffing. This atmosphere spurs other organizations to provide their own forms of aid.&lt;ref name="palilonis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bioethics.wfu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Topic-3-A-Brief-History-of-Global-Health.pdf |title=An Introduction to Global Health and Global Health Ethics: A Brief History of Global Health |author= M. A. Palilonis |accessdate=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}&lt;ref name="markel"/&gt;{{rp|126}} The [[Alma Ata Declaration]] and selective [[primary healthcare]] are created to express urgent action by all governments and citizens to protect and promote the health of all people equally.&lt;ref name="Alma Ata Declaration"&gt;WHO. [http://www.who.int/publications/almaata_declaration_en.pdf Declaration from the website of the World Health Organization].&lt;/ref&gt; More organizations form following these new active attitudes toward global health, including the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] and the [[Doctors Without Borders]] organization. Publications like the [[WHO Model List of Essential Medicines]] highlight basic medicines required by most adults and children to survive, and set priorities for healthcare fund allocation in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/en/|title=WHO Model Lists of Essential Medicines|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, there is more buy-in for the idea that direct, targeted efforts to address healthcare could be worthwhile and benefit many countries.

===1980s–2000===

Certain specific efforts increase in efficiency and productivity, including improvement in maternal and child health and a focus on [[HIV/AIDS]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[malaria]] (the 'Big Three') in developing countries. During this time period, the [[child survival revolution]] (CSR), which helps reduce child mortality in the developing world, and [[GOBI-FFF]] are both advocated by [[James P. Grant]].&lt;ref name="David Bornstein 2007 pp. 250"&gt;David Bornstein (2007). How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas New York: Oxford University Press pp. 250&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Summit for Children]] also takes place, becoming one of the largest ever gathering of heads of states and government to commit a set of goals to improve the well-being of children. Finally, HIV/AIDS becomes the focus of many governmental and non-governmental organizations, leading to the formation of the Global Programme on AIDS (GPA) by efforts of the World Health Organization.&lt;ref name="palilonis"/&gt;{{rp|6}} However, these health organizations also make significant advancements to tuberculosis treatments, including the [[DOTS]] strategy and the formation of the [[Stop TB Partnership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoptb.org/|title=Stop TB Partnership - Home Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s and beyond===

UN's [[Millennium Development Goals]] establishes health care as an important goal (not just combating infectious diseases).&lt;ref name="palilonis"/&gt;{{rp|7}} Later in 2015, the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] build on the MDGs to outline the objectives that will transform our world by ending poverty, helping the environment, and improving health and education. More specific disease-targeting organizations are created primarily to fund healthcare plans in developing countries, including the  [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] and [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/|title=Home - The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These organizations (especially the WHO) adopt new strategies and initiatives, including the [[3 by 5 Initiative]] to widen the access to [[antiretroviral treatment]], the [[WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/fctc/en/|title=World Health Organization|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private large donors such as the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] begin to play an important role in shaping the funding landscape and direction of efforts in global health.

==Full timeline==

=== Inclusion criteria ===

The following events are selected for inclusion in the timeline:

* Major medical advances, such as the first vaccines or antibiotics for important diseases.
* Major disease outbreaks, particularly those that played a key role in identifying key medical facts about the nature of disease or epidemiology.
* Key programs, innovations, and strategies in delivery of treatments and healthcare supply chains.
* Government policies or healthcare systems that are the first of their kind in the world, or have global significance for some other reason.
* The forming of trans-national organizations and private foundations that either directly deal with global health, or fund and manage other organizations that do. Note that we also include some emergency medical relief organizations, because they have played an important role in identifying and combating disease outbreaks in the aftermath of natural or man-made disaster.
* Important conferences related to global health. For conferences held regularly, we only include an event for the first time the conference was held, or if there was a particularly influential conference.

We do ''not'' include:

* Incremental advances in medical science except the most important ones.
* Rollouts of policies by different governments, or changes to local healthcare structures, except those that are pioneering. To understand healthcare at the country level, you can see the timelines of healthcare by country.
* Incremental changes to existing trans-national organizations or private foundations in their global health programs, except those that have significance as pioneering new approaches to global health.

'''''To Save Humanity''''' is a 2015 collection of 96 essays on [[global health]] from a collection of authors who range from heads of states, movie stars, scientists at leading universities, activists, and [[Nobel Prize]] winners. Each contributor was asked the same question: "What is the single most important thing for the future of global health over the next fifty years?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/137492688|title=To Save Humanity Book Launch Julio Frenk|website=Vimeo|access-date=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection was edited by [[Julio Frenk]] and Steven J.

== Reception ==
The [[Global Strategy Lab]] called the collection "unparalleled" and "a primer on the major issues of our time and a blueprint for post-2015 health and development," and featured it in their annual conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalstrategylab.org/conference|title=Global Health / Global Justice 2015 Conference|website=globalstrategylab.org|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Health Impact Fund]] also featured the collection at their conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/CemmaM/status/596740585651884032|title=Masha Cemma on Twitter|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Lancet]] described the book as "testimony to the complexity of global health politics," and called it "a reminder that the breadth of individual and institutional engagement with global health cannot be fully captured by one set of global goals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=James|date=21 May 2016|title=Voices in global health: present realities, future challenges|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)30529-3/abstract|journal=The Lancet|volume=387|issue=10033|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30529-3|pmid=|access-date=2016-07-17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Vaginismus''' is a condition in which involuntary [[muscle spams]] prevents [[vaginal penetration]].&lt;ref name=Fer2016&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ferri |first1=Fred F. |title=Ferri's Clinical Advisor 2017 E-Book: 5 Books in 1 |date=2016 |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=9780323448383 |page=1330 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=rRhCDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1330 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often results in [[pain with sex|pain with attempts at sex]].&lt;ref name=Fer2016/&gt; Often it begins when [[sexual intercourse]] is first attempted.&lt;ref name=Mer2013/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
The underlying cause is generally a fear that penetration will hurt.&lt;ref name=Mer2013/&gt; Risk factors include a history of [[sexual assault]], [[endometriosis]], [[vaginitis]], or a prior [[episiotomy]].&lt;ref name=Fer2016/&gt; Diagnosis is based on the symptoms and [[pelvic examination|examination]].&lt;ref name=Fer2016/&gt; It requires there to be no [[anatomical]] or physical problems and a desire for penetration on the part of the women.&lt;ref name=Mer2013&gt;{{cite web |title=Vaginismus |url=https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/sexual-dysfunction-in-women/vaginismus |website=Merck Manuals Professional Edition |accessdate=15 October 2018 |date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Braddom |first1=Randall L. |title=Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation E-Book |date=2010 |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=1437735630 |page=665 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=dxd4Kcy1StYC&amp;pg=PA665 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Severity as well as the pain during penetration varies between women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Reissing | first =Elke | authorlink = |author2=Yitzchak Binik |author3=Samir Khalife  | title =Does Vaginismus Exist?

==Causes==

===Primary vaginismus===
A woman is said to have primary vaginismus  when she is unable to have penetrative sex or experience vaginal penetration without pain. It is commonly discovered in teenage girls and women in their early twenties, as this is when many girls and young women first attempt to use [[tampon]]s, have penetrative sex, or undergo a [[Pap test|Pap smear]]. Women with vaginismus may be unaware of the condition until they attempt vaginal penetration. A woman may be unaware of the reasons for their condition.&lt;ref name=Pacik09/&gt;

A few of the main factors that may contribute to primary vaginismus include:

* a condition called [[vulvar vestibulitis]] syndrome, more or less synonymous with focal [[vaginitis]], a so-called [[sub-clinical]] inflammation, in which no pain is perceived until some form of penetration is attempted
* [[urinary tract infection]]s
* vaginal [[Candidiasis|yeast infections]]
* [[sexual abuse]], [[rape]], other [[sexual assault]], or attempted sexual abuse or assault
* knowledge of (or witnessing) sexual or physical abuse of others, without being personally abused
* [[domestic violence]] or similar conflict in the early home environment
* fear of pain associated with penetration, particularly the popular misconception of "breaking" the [[hymen]] upon the first attempt at penetration, or the idea that vaginal penetration will inevitably hurt the first time it occurs
* chronic pain conditions and [[Harm avoidance|harm-avoidance]] behaviour&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Borg |first1=Charmaine |last2=Peters |first2=L. M. |last3=Weijmar Schultz |first3=W. |last4=de Jong |first4=P. J. |title=Vaginismus: Heightened Harm Avoidance and Pain Catastrophizing Cognitions |journal=Journal of Sexual Medicine |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=558–567 |date=February 2012 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2011.02535.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* any physically invasive trauma (not necessarily involving or even near the genitals)
* generalized anxiety
* stress
* negative emotional reaction towards sexual stimulation, e.g. disgust both at a deliberate level and also at a more implicit level&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Borg|first=Charmaine|author2=Peter J. De Jong |author3=Willibrord Weijmar Schultz |title=Vaginismus and Dyspareunia: Automatic vs. Deliberate: Disgust Responsivity|journal=Journal of Sexual Medicine|date=June 2010|volume=7|issue=6|pages=2149–2157|doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2010.01800.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* strict conservative moral education, which also can elicit negative emotions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Borg|first=Charmaine|author2=Peter J. de Jong |author3=Willibrord Weijmar Schultz |title=Vaginismus and Dyspareunia: Relationship with General and Sex-Related Moral Standards|journal=Journal of Sexual Medicine|date=Jan 2011|volume=8|issue=1|pages=223–231|doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2010.02080.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary vaginismus is often [[idiopathic]].&lt;ref name=Health.am&gt;{{cite web | title =Vaginismus | work =Sexual Pain Disorders and Vaginismus | url=http://www.health.am/sex/more/sexual_pain_disorders_vaginismus/ | year = 2006 | publisher=Armenian Medical Network | accessdate=2008-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaginismus has been classified by Lamont&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lamont | first1 = JA | title = Vaginismus | journal = Am J Obstet Gynecol | volume = 131 | issue = 6 | pages = 633–6 | year = 1978 | pmid = 686049 }}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the severity of the condition. Lamont describes four degrees of vaginismus: In first degree vaginismus, the patient has spasm of the pelvic floor that can be relieved with reassurance. In second degree, the spasm is present but maintained throughout the pelvis even with reassurance. In third degree, the patient elevates the buttocks to avoid being examined. In fourth degree vaginismus (also known as grade 4 vaginismus), the most severe form of vaginismus, the patient elevates the buttocks, retreats and tightly closes the thighs to avoid examination. Pacik expanded the Lamont classification to include a fifth degree in which the patient experiences a visceral reaction such as sweating, hyperventilation, palpitations, trembling, shaking, nausea, vomiting, losing consciousness, wanting to jump off the table, or attacking the doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Pacik, PT. |author2=Cole, JB. |title=When Sex Seems Impossible. Stories of Vaginismus and How You Can Achieve Intimacy |publisher=Odyne Publishing |year=2010 |pages=40–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lamont classification continues to be used to the present and allows for a common language among researchers and therapists.

Although the [[pubococcygeus muscle]] is commonly thought to be the primary muscle involved in vaginismus, Pacik identified two additionally-involved spastic muscles in treated patients under sedation. These include the entry muscle ([[bulbospongiosus muscle|bulbocavernosum]]) and the mid-vaginal muscle ([[puborectalis muscle|puborectalis]]). Spasm of the entry muscle accounts for the common complaint that patients often report when trying to have intercourse: "It's like hitting a brick wall".&lt;ref name=Pacik09&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pacik PT |title=Botox treatment for vaginismus |journal=Plast. Reconstr. Surg. |volume=124 |issue=6 |pages=455e–6e |date=December 2009 |pmid=19952618 |doi=10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181bf7f11 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0032-1052&amp;volume=124&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=455e}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secondary vaginismus ===
Secondary vaginismus occurs when a person who has previously been able to achieve penetration develops vaginismus. This may be due to physical causes such as a [[yeast infection]] or trauma during [[childbirth]], while in some cases it may be due to psychological causes, or to a combination of causes. The treatment for secondary vaginismus is the same as for primary vaginismus, although, in these cases, previous experience with successful penetration can assist in a more rapid resolution of the condition. Peri-menopausal and menopausal vaginismus, often due to a drying of the vulvar and vaginal tissues as a result of reduced estrogen, may occur as a result of "micro-tears" first causing sexual pain then leading to vaginismus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pacik|first=Peter|title=When Sex Seems Impossible. Stories of Vaginismus &amp; How You Can Achieve Intimacy|year=2010|publisher=Odyne|location=Manchester, NH|isbn=978-0-9830134-0-2|pages=8–16|url=http://www.vaginismusmd.com/book/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further factors that may contribute to either secondary or primary vaginismus include:
* Fear of losing control
* Not trusting one’s partner
* Self-consciousness about body image
* History of sexual abuse, rape, sexual assault, or attempted sexual abuse or assault
* Misconceptions about sex or unattainable standards for sex from exaggerated sexual materials, such as pornography or abstinence 
* Fear of vagina not being wide or deep enough / fear of partner’s penis being too large
* Undiscovered or denied sexuality

==Mechanism==
Which muscles are involved is unclear but may include the [[pubococcygeus muscle]], [[levator ani]], [[Bulbospongiosus muscle|bulbocavernosus]], circumvaginal, and perivaginal muscles.&lt;ref name="Lahaie"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lahaie|first=MA|author2=Boyer, SC |author3=Amsel, R |author4=Khalifé, S |author5= Binik, YM |title=Vaginismus: a review of the literature on the classification/diagnosis, etiology and treatment.|journal=Women's health (London, England)|date=Sep 2010|volume=6|issue=5|pages=705–19|pmid=20887170|doi=10.2217/whe.10.46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==

A [[Cochrane review]] found little high quality evidence regarding the treatment of vaginismus in 2012.&lt;ref name=Mel2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Melnik|first1=T|last2=Hawton|first2=K|last3=McGuire|first3=H|title=Interventions for vaginismus.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=12 December 2012|volume=12|pages=CD001760|pmid=23235583|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001760.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically it is unclear if [[systematic desensitisation]] is better than other measures including nothing.&lt;ref name=Mel2012/&gt;

===Psychological===
According to Ward and Ogden's qualitative study on the experience of vaginismus (1994), the three most common contributing factors to vaginismus are fear of painful sex; the belief that sex is wrong or shameful (often the case with patients who had a strict religious upbringing); and traumatic early childhood experiences (not necessarily sexual in nature).

People with vaginismus are twice as likely to have a history of childhood sexual interference and held less positive attitudes about their sexuality, whereas no correlation was noted for lack of sexual knowledge or (non-sexual) physical abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reissing ED, Binik YM, Khalifé S, Cohen D, Amsel R |title=Etiological correlates of vaginismus: sexual and physical abuse, sexual knowledge, sexual self-schema, and relationship adjustment |journal=J Sex Marital Ther |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=47–59 |year=2003 |pmid=12519667 |doi=10.1080/713847095 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical===
[[File:Dilatorsfortreatingvaginismus.jpg|thumb|Dilators for treating vaginismus]]
Often, when faced with a person experiencing painful intercourse, a gynecologist will recommend [[Kegel exercises]] and provide some additional lubricants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://sogc.org/publications/when-sex-hurts-vaginismus/|title= When sex hurts – vaginismus|author= &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date= n.d.|publisher= The Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada|accessdate= |deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131020055743/http://sogc.org/publications/when-sex-hurts-vaginismus/|archivedate= 2013-10-20|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.healthline.com/health/vaginismus?toptoctest=expand |title=Vaginismus |last=Herndon | first= Jaime |date=November 30, 2015|website=Healthline |publisher= George Kruick, MD. |accessdate=December 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/women/guide/vaginismus-causes-symptoms-treatments |title= Women’s Health: Vaginismus |last= Nazario | first= Brunilda, MD.  |date= 2012 |website=WebMD|publisher= |accessdate=December 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletters/Harvard_Womens_Health_Watch/2012/May/when-sex-gives-more-pain-than-pleasure |title= When sex gives more pain than pleasure.|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= May 2012 |website=Harvard Health Publications |publisher= Harvard Health |accessdate= December 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strengthening the muscles that unconsciously tighten during vaginismus may be extremely counter-intuitive for some people. Although vaginismus has not been shown to affect a person's ability to produce lubrication, providing additional lubricant can be helpful in achieving successful penetration. This is due to the fact that women may not produce natural lubrication if anxious or in pain. Treatment of vaginismus may involve the use [[Hegar dilators]], (sometimes called vaginal trainers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Vaginismus/Pages/Treatment.aspx|title=NHS Choices Vaginal Trainers to treat vaginismus|last=nhs|first=nhs|date=2015|website=NHS Choices Vaginismus treatment|publisher=NHS}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  progressively increasing the size of the dilator inserted into the vagina.&lt;ref name="Doleys2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Doleys|first=Daniel|title=Behavioral Medicine|accessdate=|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|language=English |isbn=9781468440706|page=377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuromodulators===
[[Botulinum toxin|Botulinum toxin A (Botox)]] has been considered as a treatment option, under the idea of temporarily reducing the hypertonicity of the pelvic floor muscles. Although no random controlled trials have been done with this treatment, experimental studies with small samples have shown it to be effective, with sustained positive results through 10 months.&lt;ref name="Lahaie"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pacik, PT. Vaginismus: A Review of Current Concepts and Treatment using Botox Injections, Bupivacaine Injections and Progressive Dilation Under Anesthesia. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery Journal, {{DOI|10.1007/s00266-011-9737-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar in its mechanism of treatment, [[lidocaine]] has also been tried as an experimental option.&lt;ref name="Lahaie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Melnick"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Melnik|first=T|author2=Hawton, K |author3=McGuire, H |title=Interventions for vaginismus.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Dec 12, 2012|volume=12|pages=CD001760|pmid=23235583|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001760.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anxiolytic]]s and [[antidepressant]]s are other pharmacotherapies that have been offered to people in conjunction with other psychotherapy modalities, or if these patients experience high levels of anxiety from their condition.&lt;ref name="Lahaie"/&gt; Results from these medications have not been consistent.&lt;ref name="Lahaie"/&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
True epidemiological studies of vaginismus have not been done, as diagnosis would require painful examinations that such women would most likely avoid. Data available is primarily reported statistics from clinical settings.&lt;ref name="Lahaie"/&gt;

A study of vaginismus in people in [[Morocco]] and [[Sweden]] found a prevalence of 6%. 18-20% of people in British and Australian studies were found to have manifest [[dyspareunia]], while the rate among elderly British people was as low as 2%.&lt;ref name=ex&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Lewis RW, Fugl-Meyer KS, Bosch R, etal |title=Epidemiology/risk factors of sexual dysfunction |journal=J Sex Med |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=35–9 |date=July 2004 |pmid=16422981 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2004.10106.x |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1743-6109.2004.10106.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1990 study of people presenting to sex therapy clinics found reported vaginismus rates of between 12% and 17%, while a random sampling and structured interview survey conducted in 1994 by National Health and Sexual Life Survey documented 10%-15% of people reported that in the past six months they had experienced pain during intercourse.&lt;ref name="Health.am"/&gt;

The most recent study-based estimates of vaginismus incidence range from 5% to 47% of people presenting for sex therapy or complaining of sexual problems, with significant differences across cultures.&lt;ref&gt;see Reissing et al. 1999; Nusbaum 2000; Oktay 2003&lt;/ref&gt; It seems likely that a society's expectations of person's sexuality may particularly impact on the people with the condition.&lt;ref name=van&gt;{{cite web | title =Critical literature Review on Vaginismus| work =Critical literature Review on Vaginismus | url=http://www.vaginismus-awareness-network.org/lit_review.html | publisher=Vaginismus Awareness Network | accessdate=2008-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11698">A '''well woman examination''' is an exam offered to women to review elements of their [[reproductive health]]. It is recommended once a year for most women. The exam includes a [[breast examination]], a [[pelvic examination]] and a [[pap smear]] but may also include other procedures. Hospitals employ strict policies relating to the provision of consent by the patient, the availability of [[chaperone (clinical)|chaperone]]s at the examination, and the absence of other parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|format=PDF|url=http://www.whittington.nhs.uk/Documents/Intimate%20Examination%20and%20Chaperoning_1905.pdf|date=July 2003|author=Kath Evans|publisher=Whittington Hospital NHS Trust|title=INTIMATE EXAMINATION, PROCEDURE, CARE &amp;amp; CHAPERONING POLICY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=School pupil allowed to observe intimate examination|author=Helen Barratt|url=http://www.studentbmj.com/issues/01/10/news/361a.php|journal=studentBMJ|date=October 2001|volume=09|pages=357&amp;ndash;398|publisher=BMJ Publishing Group Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most healthcare providers also allow the patient to specify if they have any preferences towards the examiner's gender.

The well-woman examination by a medical professional is recommended at least once a year to women over 18 years old and/or women who are sexually active.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acog.org/About-ACOG/ACOG-Departments/Annual-Womens-Health-Care/Well-Woman-Recommendations|title=Well-Woman Recommendations - ACOG|website=www.acog.org|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its importance lies in identifying potential early health problems. The most important tests included in an examination is the breast exam, pelvic exam and the pap test, although some doctors consider other tests in the examination, including measurement of blood pressure, [[HIV testing]], and other laboratory tests such as [[urinalysis]], [[Complete blood count|CBC (Complete blood count)]] and testing for other [[sexually transmitted disease]]s. The procedure is important also to detect certain cancers, especially [[breast cancer|breast]] and [[cervical cancer]].&lt;ref name="Reproductive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcm.edu/crowd/?pmid=1467|title=Reproductive Health Information - The Well Woman Exam|work=Baylor College of Medicine.

Campus Health Services |accessdate=2013-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breast examination==

===Visual inspection===
The breast examination begins with a visual inspection. With the patient in a prone or seated position, the medical professional will look at both breasts to check the color, symmetry, dimensions according to age, lean body mass, the physiological (pregnancy and lactation) and race, looking for abnormalities, such as bulges and shrinkage.&lt;ref name=Manual&gt;{{cite web|url= http://escuela.med.puc.cl/Publ/ManualSemiologia/270ExamenMamas.htm|title=Examen de las Mamas |work= Manual de Semiología|accessdate=2013-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of these abnormalities is changed in the [[areola]] or nipple. If it is flattened or retracted (umbilicated), it is necessary to consider the possibility of a cancerous lesion which has caused the malformation.&lt;ref name=Manual/&gt;&lt;ref name="Exploración"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.isea.gob.mx/formatos/Cancer%20de%20mama/CLINICA%20DE%20MAMAS%20(web).pdf |title=Manual de exploración Física de las Mamas |work= Secretaría de Salud|accessdate=2013-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palpation===
Next, the breasts are palpated, again with the patient lying or sitting. The patient has to lift the arm and put one hand behind her head. With this position, the entire gland is palpated. It is also important to examine the armpits, because of masses that may be found there.&lt;ref name=Manual/&gt; The test is executed pressing the gland with two or three fingers against the chest wall, making a radial route or by quadrants. The nipple is also squeezed check for secretions, such as secretion of milk ([[galactorrhea]]), [[serous]], blood or purulent secretions. If a node is detected, it is necessary to determine its place, size, shape, edges, consistency and sensitivity.&lt;ref name=Manual/&gt;

===Self-examination===
In addition to the yearly check by a professional, women over the age of 18 should also perform this examination monthly.
It is important because regular and comprehensive examinations of the breasts can be used to find breast changes that occur between every clinical examination and detect early breast cancer. This auto examination should to be performed seven days after the onset of the menstrual period. If a woman finds a lump or notice any changes in her breast, she should seek medical attention promptly.&lt;ref name=Autoexamen&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.permanente.net/homepage/kaiser/pdf/6293.pdf|title=Autoexamen de los senos |work= Kaiser permanent|accessdate=2013-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Autoexamen/&gt;

===Further examination of the breasts===
A mammogram or mammography is a special x-ray of the breasts. They are the procedure most likely to detect early breast cancer in asymptomatic women. Mammograms can show tumors long before they are large enough to palpate. They are recommended for women who have symptoms of breast cancer or who are at increased risk of developing the disease. They are performed with the patient standing, the breast pressed between two plastic plates, as the image is taken. The interpretation has to be performed by a specialist.&lt;ref name=Mmmography&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/mammography.html|title=Mammography |website= Medline Plus|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services National Institutes of Health|accessdate=2013-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breast ultrasound is a complementary study of mammography. In many women the tissue that makes up the breast is very dense, representing fibrous tissue and glandular tissue, which produces milk during lactation. This limits the radiologist interpreting the study, so, in these cases, the ultrasound is helpful, since this is capable of distinguishing tumors in women with dense breast tissue, where identification is otherwise difficult. Additionally, it is advisable to follow up a mammogram that shows indications of tumors with an ultrasound, to confirm, before more invasive procedures are undertaken.&lt;ref name=Ultrasonido&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.fucam.org.mx/index.php/servicios/ultrasonido-mamario|title=Ultrasonido mamario |work= FUCAM|accessdate=2013-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pelvic exam==
The [https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/pelvic-exam/about/pac-20385135?p=1 pelvic exam] is part of the physical examination of the pelvic area of a woman, which generally also includes the taking of a sample for a pap smear. This test includes three parts. These are the general inspection of the external genitalia, bimanual examination, and inspection of the vaginal canal using a speculum.&lt;ref name=Anatomia&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Parrondo P, Pérez-Medina T, Álvarez-Heros J |title = Anatomía del aparato genital femenino|journal = Salud Mujer|pages = 15–18 |date=April 2013 |url = http://www2.univadis.net/microsites/area_salud_mujer/pdfs/1-Anatomia_del_aparto_genital_femenino.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inspection of external female genitalia ===
The patient is placed in a supine position on a special examination table, which has two protrusions called "stirrups." With the feet in these stirrups, the legs are placed in a position such that the medical professional can access the pelvic area. The external genitalia is examined first, looking for abnormalities like lesions, ulcers, warts and color changes. The elements of this exam include the vulva, which contains the mons pubis, of which there are two longitudinal folds of skin forming the labia majora; then the labia minora and hair follicles. The clitoral hood is also checked.&lt;ref name=Anatomia/&gt;

===Bimanual exam===
The purpose of this exam is to palpate organs which cannot be seen with visual inspection. The index and middle finger are inserted into the vagina. This maneuver allows the doctor to check the orientation, length and width of the vagina. Next, the cervix and vaginal fornices are palpated, to check position, size, consistency, mobility and sensibility.&lt;ref name=Examen&gt;{{cite web |url= http://escuela.med.puc.cl/Publ/ManualSemiologia/Ginecolo.html|title=Examen ginecológico  |work= Manual de Semiología |accessdate=2013-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other hand is placed in the pubis pressing it to feel the uterus between both hands. The most important characteristics to examine are the size of the uterus, presence of nodes or agglomerations, consistency, size, tilt, and mobility. With this technique, the ovaries are also palpable.&lt;ref name=Examen/&gt;

===Speculum examination===
The speculum examination is recommended for only women over 21 years old, irrespective of her sexual activity.&lt;ref name=Well-Woman&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.acog.org/Resources%20And%20Publications/Committee%20Opinions/Committee%20on%20Gynecologic%20Practice/Well-Woman%20Visit.aspx |title=Well-Woman Visit |work= The American College of Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists |accessdate=2013-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The speculum is an instrument made of metal or plastic and is constructed with two flaps. Its purpose is to separate and widen the vaginal opening and keep it open. This allows direct observation by the physician into the vaginal canal with the help of a lamp or a mirror.&lt;ref name=tecnica&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.polgalvan.sld.cu/softw_apn/contenido/tecnicaespeculo.htm|title=Técnica de colocación del eséculo |work= Omar Morera |accessdate=2013-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different types of speculums used within the different characteristics of each patient such as age, sex life, and other factors. The first step is to open the vaginal opening with two fingers at the vulvo-perineal angle, then separate the fingers slightly and press down, then insert the speculum arranging the width of the tip of the flaps in anteroposterior. Then the speculum is moved into the vagina at an angle of 45°, following the natural contour of the posterior vaginal wall. When the speculum is in place, the fingers are removed and the device is rotated so that the flaps are horizontal. The flaps are then separated and locked into place when the cervical neck is completely visible.&lt;ref name=tecnica/&gt;

==Pap smear==
The pap smear is a screening test to test for abnormalities such as cervical cancer and human papillomavirus infections, which require early treatment. To be viable, the patient should not be menstruating and had not used a vaginal contraceptive in the prior 24–48 hours.&lt;ref name=pelvico&gt;{{cite journal | author = Klein S., Miller S., Thomson F002E| title = El examen pélvico| journal = Atención del embarazo, el parto y la salud de la mujer| pages = 373–387 |date=May 2000 | url = http://hesperian.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf/es_midw_2011/es_midw_2011_Cap20.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure begins with the scraping of cells from the cervix and the uterine fornix, done during the speculum examination as there is access to the cervix. The scraping is done with a spatula, cervical brush or swab. Some women experience temporary bleeding from this procedure. The scrapings are placed on a slide, covered with a fixative for later examination under a microscope to determine if they are normal or abnormal.&lt;ref name=pelvico/&gt;
