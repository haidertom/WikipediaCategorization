[[File:William Sydney Porter by doubleday.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The phrase ''banana republic'' was coined in 1901 by the American writer [[O. Henry]] (William Sydney Porter, 1862–1910).]]

In [[political science]], the term '''banana republic''' describes a politically unstable country with an economy dependent upon the exportation of a limited-resource product, such as [[banana]]s or minerals. In 1901, the American author [[O. Henry]] coined the term to describe Honduras and neighbouring countries under [[exploitation of natural resources|economic exploitation]] by U.S. corporations, such as the [[United Fruit Company]]. Typically, a banana republic has a society of extremely [[social stratification|stratified]] [[social class]]es, usually a large impoverished [[working class]] and a ruling-class [[plutocracy]], composed of the business, political and military elites of that society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author = Richard Alan White |title = The Morass.

In economics, a banana republic is a country with an economy of [[state capitalism]], by which economic model the country is operated as a [[private property|private]] commercial enterprise for the exclusive [[profit (economics)|profit]] of the ruling class. Such exploitation is enabled by collusion between the state and favored economic [[monopoly|monopolies]], in which the profit, derived from the private exploitation of public lands, is private property, while the debts incurred thereby are the financial responsibility of the public treasury. Such an imbalanced economy remains limited by the [[uneven and combined development|uneven economic development]] of town and country, and usually reduces the national [[currency]] into devalued [[banknote]]s (paper money), rendering the country ineligible for [[development aid|international development credit]].&lt;ref name=Hitchens &gt;{{cite magazine |author=[[Christopher Hitchens]] |title=America the Banana Republic |magazine=Vanity Fair |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2008/10/hitchens200810 |date=9 October 2008 |accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Cover of Cabbages and Kings, 1904 edition.jpg|thumb|right|185px|Cover of ''[[Cabbages and Kings (literature)|Cabbages and Kings]]'' (1904 edition).]]
In the 19th century, the American writer [[O. Henry]] (William Sydney Porter, 1862–1910) coined the term ''banana republic'' to describe the fictional Republic of Anchuria in the book ''[[Cabbages and Kings (novel)|Cabbages and Kings]]'' (1904),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[O. Henry]]|title=Cabbages and Kings|publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday, Page &amp; Company]]|location=New York City|year=1904|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6jpMsL2T0CoC|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6jpMsL2T0CoC&amp;q=%22banana+republic%22+Anchuria 132, 296]}}&lt;/ref&gt; a collection of thematically related short stories inspired by his experiences in [[Honduras]], where he lived for six months until January 1897, hiding in a hotel in [[Trujillo, Honduras|Trujillo, Colón]], when he was wanted in the U.S. for [[embezzlement]] from a bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Malcolm D.

In the early 20th century, the [[United Fruit Company]], a multinational American corporation, was instrumental to the creation of the banana republic phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chapman | first = Peter | title = Jungle capitalists : a story of globalisation, greed and revolution | publisher = Canongate | location = Edinburgh New York | year = 2009 | page = 6 | isbn = 1847676863 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://nytimes.com/2008/03/02/books/review/Kurtz-Phelan-t.html Big Fruit], ''NY Times''&lt;/ref&gt; Together with other American corporations, such as the [[Cuyamel Fruit Company]], and with occasional support from the United States government, the corporations created the political, economic, and social circumstances that established banana republics in Central American countries such as [[Honduras]] and [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/11/economist-explains-16 Where did banana republics get their name?], ''The Economist''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The history of the ''banana republic'' began with the introduction of the [[banana]] fruit to the U.S. in 1870, by [[Lorenzo Dow Baker]], captain of the [[schooner]] ''Telegraph'', who bought bananas in Jamaica and sold them in Boston at a 1,000 percent profit.&lt;ref name=acker&gt;{{Cite book |author=Alison Acker |title=Honduras. The Making of a Banana Republic |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lwhrAAAAMAAJ |publisher=[[Between the Lines Books|Between the Lines]] |location=[[Toronto]] |year=1988 |pages=60 |id={{ISBN|0-919946-89-5}} |isbn=978-0-919946-89-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The banana proved popular with Americans, as a nutritious tropical fruit that was less expensive than locally-grown fruit in the U.S., such as apples; in 1913, 25 cents ({{Inflation|US|0.25|1913|r=2|fmt=eq}}) bought a dozen bananas, but only two apples.&lt;ref name="Koeppel-2008"&gt;{{Cite book|author = Dan Koeppel |title = Banana. The Fate of the Fruit that Changed the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cSoVd-o8PmoC&amp;hl=en|publisher = Hudson Street Press|location = London|year=2008|pages=68 |id={{ISBN|1-59463-038-0}} |isbn=978-1-59463-038-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1873,  to produce food for their railroad workers, the American railroad tycoons [[Henry Meiggs]] and his nephew, [[Minor C. Keith]], established [[banana plantation]]s along the railroads they built in Costa Rica; recognizing the profitability of exporting bananas, they began exporting the fruit to the Southeastern U.S.&lt;ref name="Koeppel-2008" /&gt;
[[File:Minor Keith.jpg|thumb|right|185px|The banana planter: [[Minor Cooper Keith|Minor C. Keith]], American businessman.]]
In the mid-1870s, to manage the new [[Agribusiness|industrial-agriculture]] business enterprise in the countries of [[Central America]], Keith founded the [[Tropical Trading and Transport Company]]: one-half of what would later become the [[United Fruit Company]] (UFC); later [[Chiquita Brands International]], created in 1899 by merger with the [[Boston Fruit Company]], and owned by [[Andrew Preston]]. By the 1930s, the international political and economic tensions created by the United Fruit Company enabled the corporation to control 80–90 per cent of the banana business in the U.S.&lt;ref name=Acker63&gt;Alison Acker (1988), p.&amp;nbsp;63.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 19th century, three American [[multinational corporation]]s (the [[United Fruit Company]], the [[Standard Fruit Company]], and the [[Cuyamel Fruit Company]]) dominated the cultivation, harvesting, and exportation of bananas, and controlled the road, rail, and port infrastructure of Honduras. In the northern coastal areas near the Caribbean Sea, the Honduran government ceded to the banana companies {{convert|500|ha/km|acre/mi}} of a laid railroad, despite there being neither passenger nor freight railroad service to Tegucigalpa, the capital city. Among the Honduran people, the United Fruit Company was known as ''El pulpo'' (The Octopus), because its influence pervaded Honduran society, controlled their country's transport infrastructure, and sometimes manipulated Honduran national politics with anti-labor violence.&lt;ref name=Chapman&gt;{{Cite book |author=Peter Chapman |title=Bananas. How the United Fruit Company Shaped the World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a-azAAAAIAAJ |publisher=[[Canongate Books|Canongate]] |location=[[Edinburgh]] |year = 2007|pages=102 |id={{ISBN|1-84195881-6}} |isbn=978-1-84195-881-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, despite the UFC [[monopoly]], the [[Vaccaro Brothers]] established the [[Standard Fruit Company]] (later the [[Dole Food Company]]) to export Honduran bananas to the U.S. port of New Orleans. The fruit-exporting corporations kept U.S. prices low by [[Legalism (Western philosophy)|legalistic]]  manipulation of Latin American national [[land use]] laws to cheaply buy large tracts of prime agricultural land for corporate banana plantations in the republics of the [[Caribbean Basin]], the [[Central America|Central American isthmus]], and tropical South America; the American fruit companies then employed the dispossessed Latin American natives as low-wage employees.&lt;ref name="Koeppel-2008" /&gt;

By the 1930s the [[United Fruit Company]] owned 3.5 million acres of land in Central America and the Caribbean and was the single largest landowner in Guatemala. Such holdings gave it great power over the governments of small countries. That was one of the factors confirming the suitability of the phrase Banana Republics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WH5jDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT31&amp;dq=United+Fruit+company+Banana+republics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjnh8TCgdPVAhWr7oMKHdOqCHQ4ChDoAQgnMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=United+Fruit+company+Banana+republics&amp;f=false|title=America's Backyard: The United States and Latin America from the Monroe Doctrine to the War on Terror|first=Grace|last=Livingstone|date=4 April 2013|publisher=Zed Books Ltd.|accessdate=22 March 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honduras===
[[File:CLeePic.jpg|thumb|200px|In 1912, for the Cuyamel Fruit Company, the American mercenary "General" [[Lee Christmas]] overthrew the civil government of Honduras to install a military government friendly to foreign business.]]

In the early 20th century, the American businessman [[Sam Zemurray]] (founder of the Cuyamel Fruit Company) was instrumental to establishing the "banana republic" stereotype, when he entered the banana-export business by buying overripe bananas from the United Fruit Company to sell in New Orleans. In 1910, Zemurray bought 6,070 hectares (15,000 acres) in the Caribbean coast of Honduras for exploitation by the Cuyamel Fruit Company. In 1911, Zemurray conspired with [[Manuel Bonilla]], an ex-president of Honduras (1904–07), and the American mercenary Gen. [[Lee Christmas]], to overthrow the civil government of Honduras and install a military government friendly to foreign businessmen.

To that end, the mercenary army of the Cuyamel Fruit Company, led by Gen. Christmas, effected a ''[[coup d'état]]'' against President [[Miguel R. Dávila]] (1907–11) and installed General [[Manuel Bonilla]] (1912–13). The U.S. ignored the [[Deposition (politics)|deposition]] of the elected government of Honduras by a private army, justified by the U.S. State Department's misrepresenting President Dávila as too politically liberal and a poor businessman whose management had indebted Honduras to Great Britain, a geopolitically unacceptable circumstance in light of the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. The ''coup d'état'' was consequence of the Dávila government's having slighted the Cuyamel Fruit Company by colluding with the rival United Fruit Company to award them a monopoly contract for the Honduran banana, in exchange for the UFC's brokering of U.S.government loans to Honduras.&lt;ref name=Acker63 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Darío A. Euraque |title=Reinterpreting the Banana Republic.

[[File:Honduras rel 1985.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Honduras, the quintessential banana republic.]]

The political instability consequent to the ''coup d'état'' stalled the Honduran economy, and the unpayable [[external debt]] (ca. US$4 billion) of the Republic of Honduras was excluded from access to international [[investment]] capital. That financial deficit perpetuated Honduran economic stagnation and perpetuated the image of Honduras as a banana republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=W.S. Valentine |date=November 1916 |title=Need for Capital in Latin America: Honduras |journal=[[Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science]] |volume=68 |issue= |pages= 185–87 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |location=[[Thousand Oaks, California]] |jstor=1013083}}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 June 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Such a historical, inherited foreign debt functionally undermined the Honduran government, which allowed foreign corporations to manage the country and become sole employers of the Honduran people, because the American fruit companies controlled the economic infrastructure (road, rail, and port, telegraph and telephone) they had built in Honduras.

In the event, the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]] became the legal-tender currency of Honduras; the mercenary Gen. Lee Christmas became commander of the Honduran army, and later was appointed [[Consul (representative)|U.S. Consul]] to the Republic of Honduras.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=George Black |title=The Good Neighbor: How the United States Wrote the History of Central America and the Caribbean |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uvl6AAAAMAAJ |publisher=[[Pantheon Books]] |location=New York City |year=1988 |pages=35 |id={{ISBN|0-39475965-6}} |isbn=978-0-394-75965-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, 23 years later, after much corporate intrigue among the American businessmen, by means of a [[takeover|hostile takeover]] of agricultural business interests, Sam Zemurray assumed control of the rival United Fruit Company, in 1933.&lt;ref name=Chapman /&gt;

===Guatemala===
[[File:LocationGuatemala.svg|300px|right]]
[[Guatemala]] suffered the regional socio-economic legacy of the ''banana republic'': inequitably distributed agricultural land and natural wealth, [[Uneven and combined development|uneven economic development]], and an economy dependent upon a few export crops—usually bananas, coffee, and sugar cane. The inequitable land distribution was an important cause of national poverty, and the concomitant sociopolitical discontent and [[civil war|insurrection]]. Almost 90 percent of the country's farms are too small to yield adequate subsistence harvests to the farmers, while two percent of the country's farms occupy 65 percent of the arable land, the property of the local [[oligarchy]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

During the 1950s, the United Fruit Company sought to convince the governments of U.S. Presidents [[Harry S. Truman|Harry Truman]] (1945–53) and [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Dwight Eisenhower]] (1953–61) that the popular, elected government of President [[Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán|Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán]] of Guatemala was secret pro-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] for having expropriated unused "fruit company lands" to landless peasants. In the [[Cold War]] (1945–91) context of the pro-active [[anti-Communism|anti-communist]] politics exemplified by U. S. Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] in the years 1947–57, [[Geopolitics|geo-political]] concerns about the security of the Western Hemisphere facilitated President Eisenhower's ordering and authorizing Operation Success, the [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'état]] by means of which the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] [[Deposition (politics)|deposed]] the democratically elected government (1950–54) of President Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán and installed the pro-business government of Colonel [[Carlos Castillo Armas]] (1954–57), which lasted for three years until his [[assassination]] by a presidential guard.&lt;ref name="GREED"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Koeppel |first=Dan |date=8 June 2008 |title=Yes, We Will Have No Bananas |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/18/opinion/18koeppel.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mixed history of elected presidents and [[Hegemony|puppet-master]] [[military junta]]s were the governments of Guatemala in the course of the 36-year [[Guatemalan Civil War]] (1960–96). However, in 1986, at the 26-year mark, the Guatemalan people promulgated a new [[political constitution]], and elected [[Vinicio Cerezo]] (1986–91) president; then [[Jorge Serrano Elías]] (1991–93).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Carol A.

===Poetry===
[[File:Pablo Neruda.jpg|thumb|right|175px|With the poem "La United Fruit Co.", [[Pablo Neruda]] denounced the corporate subjugation of Latin America.]]
In the book ''[[Canto General]]'' (General Song, 1950), the Chilean poet [[Pablo Neruda]] (1904–73) denounced foreign [[multinational corporation|multinational corporate]] political dominance of [[Latin America]]n countries with the four-stanza poem "La United Fruit Co."; the second-stanza excerpts read:&lt;ref&gt;George Black (1988), p.&amp;nbsp;33.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;The Fruit Company, Inc.&lt;br&gt;
Reserved for itself the most succulent,&lt;br&gt;
The central coast of my own land,&lt;br&gt;
The delicate waist of the Americas.

It rechristened its territories&lt;br&gt;
As the "Banana Republics", &lt;br&gt;
And over the sleeping dead,&lt;br&gt;
Over the restless heroes&lt;br&gt;
Who brought about the greatness,&lt;br&gt;
The liberty and the flags,&lt;br&gt;
It established a comic opera&amp;nbsp;...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

===Literature===
The novel ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'' (1967), by [[Gabriel García Márquez]], depicts the [[Imperialism|imperialist]] capitalism of foreign fruit companies as voracious socio-economic [[exploitation of natural resources]] of Macondo and of the people. Domestically, the corrupt national government of Macondo abets the business policies and labor practices of the foreign corporations, which brutally oppress the workers.

The protagonist, José Arcadio Segundo, has been [[Labour union|organizing]] the workers of the banana plantations to jointly affect a work strike to protest the inhumane working conditions. Martial law is imposed upon Macondo, and the workers respond by sabotaging the banana plantations. In unexpected response, the national government diplomatically invites more than 3,000 workers to meet with provincial leaders to resolve their labor-and-management differences. The meeting is a deceit; the army surrounds the workers and methodically kill them with machine guns. Afterward, the three thousand corpses are collected onto a train and later dumped into the sea, to be forgotten.

Meanwhile, the apparently dead José Arcadio Segundo also was loaded onto the coast-bound train of corpses, yet later escapes and walks back to Macondo. To his horror, José Arcadio learns that all memory of the massacre has been eliminated, no-one in Macondo remembers the killing of three thousand workers. The townsfolk refuse to believe José Arcadio when he tells them of the massacre, which he survived. Moreover, nature contributes to the oblivion with heavy, unrelenting rain that destroys the physical traces of the massacred workers.

===Movies===

[[Woody Allen]]'s 1971 film ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'' depicted a fictional banana republic called San Marcos; the film is also named for this term.

The [[analogy]] typically includes reference to the [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] head of [[government]] as [[head of state]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Body politic: political metaphor and political violence |author=A. D. Harvey |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-84718-272-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the analogy may also be extended to other anatomical parts, as in political readings of [[Aesop's fable]] of "[[The Belly and the Members]]".

A later [[Europe]]an reference to the concept appears in ''The Book of the Body Politic'' (1407) by poet and court writer [[Christine de Pizan]], in which she admits having borrowed the concept from a letter of [[Plutarch]]'s to the Roman Emperor [[Trajan]] but does not mention [[John of Salisbury]]'s work, ''[[Policraticus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christine de Pizan]] ''The Book of the Body Politic'' pp.xviii-xx Kate Langdon Forhan 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of the Body Politic'' pp.3-5 1994&lt;/ref&gt;  The metaphor appears in the French language as the ''corps-état''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Baecque|first1=Antoine|others=Trans.

The metaphor was elaborated in the [[Renaissance]], and subsequently, as medical knowledge based on [[Galen]] was challenged by thinkers such as [[William Harvey]].  Analogies were drawn between supposed causes of disease and disorder and their equivalents in the political field, viewed as [[Plague (disease)|plague]]s or infections that might be remedied with [[purgative|purges]] and [[Patent medicine|nostrums]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Foreign bodies and the body politic: discourses of social pathology in early modern England |author=Jonathan Harris |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-521-59405-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval origins==
{{Anchor|In statehood}} The term "Body politic" (the political body of [[society]]) derives from the mediæval political concept of the '''King's two bodies''' first noted by mediaeval historian [[Ernst Kantorowicz]], as a point of theology as much as statehood. However, the person to give the concept some legal bite and codified reality, as much as legitimacy as well as Sovereignty, was the 14th century judge Sir [[William de Shareshull]] in 1351 for the offence of high treason&lt;ref&gt;"Declaration what Offences shall be adjudged Treason. Compassing the Death of the King, Queen, or their eldest Son; violating the Queen, or the King’s eldest Daughter unmarried, or his eldest Son’s Wife; levying War; adhering to the King’s Enemies; killing the Chancellor, Treasurer, or Judges in Execution of their Duty.

ITEM, Whereas divers Opinions have been before this Time in what Case Treason shall be said, and in what not; the King, at the Request of the Lords and of the Commons, hath made a Declaration in the Manner as hereafter followeth, that is to say; When a Man doth compass or imagine the Death of our Lord the King, or of our Lady his [Queen or of their eldest Son and Heir; or if a Man do violate the King’s Companion or the King’s eldest Daughter unmarried, or the Wife  the King’s eldest Son and Heir; or if a Man do levy War against our Lord the King in his Realm, or be adherent to the King’s Enemies in his Realm, giving to them Aid and Comfort in the Realm, or elsewhere, and thereof be probably] attainted of open Deed by the People] of their Condition: . . . , and if a Man slea the Chancellor, Treasurer, or the King’s Justices of the one Bench or the other, Justices in Eyre, or Justices of Assise, and all other Justices assigned to hear and determine, being in their Places, doing their Offices: And it is to be understood, that in the Cases above rehearsed, that ought to be judged Treason which extends to our Lord the King, and his Royal Majesty" Treason Act 1351 25 Edw 3 St 5 c 2
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''1351 Treason''' Act 25 Edw 3 St 5 c 2&lt;/ref&gt; in the aftermath of the [[First Barons' War|Barons war]]. However, by the time of the fifteenth-century judge [[John Fortescue (judge)|Sir John Fortescue]] the concept moves away from theology to [[jurisprudence]] in his ''The Difference between an Absolute and a Limited Monarchy'', written from exile in about 1462 . Fortescue explains that the ''character angelus'' (divine character) of the king is his royal power, derived from angels and separate from the frail physical powers of his body.  However, he uses the phrase ''body politic'' itself only in its modern sense, to describe the realm, or shared rule, of [[Brutus of Troy|Brutus]], mythical first king of England, and how he and his fellow exiles had covenanted to form a body politic. Unusually for the time, Fortescue was writing in English and not Latin: "made a body pollitike callid a reawme." The early medieval period (13th century) saw a general and radical shift in the idea of the political body and sovereignty and who was to be ultimate ruler of humankind.This constant shift in [[Translatio imperii]] and ''The Halo of perpetuity''(Kantorowicz reasoning)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kings Two Bodies|last=Ernst|first=Kantorowicz|publisher=|year=1957|isbn=|location=|pages=78–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; transformed the king's persona from [[Liturgy]] to legal science, argues Kantorowicz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The King's Two Bodies|last=Kantorowicz|first=|publisher=|year=1957|isbn=|location=|pages=87–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] proved one thing, quite surprisingly enough, the king wasn't the ultimate and major landowner with just 20% of land ownership as [[William the Conqueror]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Doomsday Of Crown Lands|last=Sidney J|first=Madge|publisher=Routledge|year=1938|isbn=|location=|pages=20–21|quote="Before the Norman conquest, therefore, it is possible to find a feudal edifice of at least four stages-first, the king as supreme lord;then the holders of "bocland"with their "courts", and the power of making separate grants; next the owners of "laenland", rendering military service and special dues;and lastly, the cultivators of the land (Feudal serfs) of two types, free and unfree.This division of the land before and after the (Norman) Conquest, worked out so carefully in 1867, but expressed in percentage form for the first time, reveals the curious fact that the Church(29.6%) alone gained by the Conquest, relatively speaking, the Crown(19.9%) and the Baronage(50.5%) showing proportionate losses in the new triangular balance of power."}}&lt;/ref&gt; found out to his disgust and chagrin, which ultimately led to the [[Domesday Book|Domesday book]] being compiled. With [[Plenitudo potestatis]], [[Unam sanctam]] (a [[Papal bull]]) [[extra Ecclesiam nulla salus]] and the [[Sun and moon allegory]] now part of the armoury of jurisdictional power of the papacy with both [[Canon law]], and medieval political theology now becoming(part of the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] movement beginning with [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[John of Salisbury]]) a standard bearer for medieval political power which then descended into the infamous [[Inquisition]] and [[heresy]] (deviation from truth)as the ultimate legal reality which meant both the [[Roman catholic church|Roman Catholic Church]] and [[Papal supremacy]] couldn't be ignored(not without fear of [[Excommunication (Catholic Church)|excommunication]] and in some cases judicial execution). The church, which ultimately had powerful claims to sovereignty due to their immense wealth and vast monetary resources which included a clever taxation system establishing the legal validity of the [[tithe]] system which baffled legal experts of the day of its historical lineage and origin, such as Sir [[William Blackstone]], for example, not its legal validity; such as their (the church's) enormous network and ownership of land, law making and the then-University and education system.

==Literal manifestation==
In 1550 the jurist [[Edmund Plowden]] merged Fortescue's concepts, at the same time removing them from abstraction into a real, physical manifestation in the body of the king. Plowden reports how lawyers codified this notion in an examination of a case of land-ownership turning on a disputed gift by an earlier monarch; they determined that the "Body politic…that cannot be seen or handled…[is] constituted for the direction of the People…[and] these two bodies are incorporated in one person…the Body politic includes the [king's] Body natural."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kantorowicz|first=Ernst H|authorlink=Ernst Kantorowicz|title=The King's Two Bodies: A Study in Mediaeval Political Theology|year=1957|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0691071209|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1609 [[Attorney General]] [[Edward Coke]] pronounced his dissenting opinion,  that mortal power was God-made while the immortality of royal power existed only as a man-made concept; Coke later succeeded in limiting the royal power of both [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and [[James VI and I]] with his now infamous judgements of [[Case of Proclamations]]&lt;ref&gt;'''England and Wales High Court (King's Bench Division)''' ''Decisions Case of Proclamations [1610] EWHC KB J22 November 1610''&lt;/ref&gt; and his ''[[Petition of Right]]'', which triggered off the [[English Civil War]] and would have reverberations right across the country for the next 100 years. When the monarchy, in the person of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], was [[Restoration (England)|restored]] at the end of the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] the idea remained current and royalty continued to use the notion, as a buttress to its authority, until an assertion of the rights of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] brought about the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688.&lt;ref&gt;Kantorowicz (1957: 423)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olwig (2002: 102)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century English [[Barrister]] and judge Sir [[William Blackstone]] developed further the medieval idea and the legal argument  (which still stands today) of the monarch in legal terms "immortal" with added emphasis of a quasi divine (''character angelus'') status.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Blackstone|Sir William Blackstone]] (1765) ''Commentaries On The Laws of England: In Four Books'' p.196 Volume 1 "But, fourthly; however the crown may be limited or transferred, it still retains its descendible quality, and becomes hereditary in the wearer of it. And hence in our law the king is said never to die, in his political capacity; though,in common with other men, he is subject to mortality in his natural: because immediately upon the natural death of Henry,William, or Edward, the king survives in his successor.
For the right of the crown vests, eo instanti, upon his heir; either the ''hares natus'', if the course of descent remains unimpeached,or the ''hares factus'', if the inheritance be under any particular settlement. So that there can be no interregnum (7); but,as [[Sir Matthew Hale]] (b) observes, the right of sovereignty is fully invested in the successor by the very descent of the crown.And therefore, however acquired, it becomes in him absolutely hereditary, unless by the rules of the limitation it is otherwise ordered and determined. 
In the same manner as landed estates,to continue our former comparison, are by the law here hereditary, or descendible to the heirs of the owner; but still there exists a power, by which the property of those lands may be transferred to another person. If this transfer be made simply and absolutely (8), the lands will be hereditary in the new owner, and descend to his heir-at-law; but if the transfer be clogged with any limitations, conditions, or entails, the lands must descend in that channel, so limited and prescribed,and no other". 
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ancient legal maxim is that ‘the King never dies’. According to Blackstone,”the King survives in his successor” and “the right of the Crown ''vests, eo instanti'', upon his heirs”. Thus in legal theory the monarch is regarded as immortal and there is no moment in which the throne is vacant”. [[Halsbury's Laws of England]] Fifth Edition ''Crown and Crown Proceedings'' pp.8-9 Volume 29 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=John Anthony|title=James I and Divine Right|publisher=Sophia University|location=Tokyo|oclc=41418652|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-Revolution monarchs of France also claimed legitimacy on this principle, and extended it to include the idea that the king's heir assimilated the "body politic" of the old king, in a physical "transfer of corporeality", on accession.&lt;ref&gt;de Baecque (1997: 100–102)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bombard The Headquarters – My Big-Character Poster''''' ({{Zh|c=炮打司令部——我的一张大字报}}) was a short document written by Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] on August 5, 1966 during the 11th Plenary Session of the [[8th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China]] and published on the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]]'s official newspaper ''[[People's Daily]]'' a year later, on August 5, 1967.

It is commonly believed that this "poster" directly targeted Chinese President [[Liu Shaoqi]] and senior leader [[Deng Xiaoping]], who were then in charge of Chinese government's daily affairs and who tried to cool down the mass hysteria which had been coming into shape in several universities in [[Beijing]] since the [[Cultural Revolution#May 16 notification|May 16 Notice]], through which Mao officially launched the [[Cultural Revolution]], was issued.

Much larger scale of mass persecutions came after the publication of this [[big-character poster]], resulting in turmoil of the whole country and the death of thousands of "class enemies", including President Liu Shaoqi.

The original text of the poster was:
{{quote|全国第一张马列主义的大字报和人民日报评论员的评论，写得何等好呵！请同志们重读这一张大字报和这个评论。可是在50多天里，从中央到地方的某些领导同志，却反其道而行之，站在反动的资产阶级立场上，实行资产阶级专政，将无产阶级轰轰烈烈的文化大革命运动打下去，颠倒是非，混淆黑白，围剿革命派，压制不同意见，实行白色恐怖，自以为得意，长资产阶级的威风，灭无产阶级的志气，又何其毒也！联想到1962年的右倾和1964年形“左”实右的错误倾向，岂不是可以发人深醒的吗？&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=炮打司令部——我的一张大字报|author=毛泽东|url=http://www.people.com.cn/GB/historic/0805/2563.html|publisher=人民网}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
English translation:
{{quote|China's first Marxist-Leninist big-character poster and Commentator's article on it in People's Daily are indeed superbly written! Comrades, please read them again. But in the last fifty days or so some leading comrades from the central down to the local levels have acted in a diametrically opposite way. Adopting the reactionary stand of the bourgeoisie, they have enforced a bourgeois dictatorship and struck down the surging movement of the great cultural revolution of the proletariat. They have stood facts on their head and juggled black and white, encircled and suppressed revolutionaries, stifled opinions differing from their own, imposed a white terror, and felt very pleased with themselves. They have puffed up the arrogance of the bourgeoisie and deflated the morale of the proletariat. How poisonous! Viewed in connection with the Right deviation in 1962 and the wrong tendency of 1964 which was 'Left' in form but Right in essence, shouldn't this make one wide awake?}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2673">"'''Boris, you are wrong'''" ({{lang-ru|Борис, ты не прав}}) is a political [[catchphrase]], originally said by [[Yegor Ligachev]] to [[Boris Yeltsin]] on 1 July 1988 to tackle Yeltsin's split from Soviet politics. Ligachev was at the time a member of the [[Politburo]], while Yeltsin was First Deputy Chairman of the Soviet [[State Committee for Construction]]. Speaking at the 19th All-Union Conference of the [[CPSU]], Ligachev said: "Dear comrades! We should not be silent because communist Yeltsin has chosen a wrong path. It turned out that the man does not have a creative, but a destructive force. His assessment of the ''[[perestroyka]]'' process, the approach and the method of work have been declared untenable and erroneous in the party. There are reasonable proposals in his speech, but in general it indicates that you, Boris, have not drawn the correct political conclusions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hY28PXvHaE| title =Video of Yegor Ligachev's speech|language=Russian|publisher =[[YouTube]]| accessdate =20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form "Boris, you are wrong" was popularized by [[Gennady Khazanov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://pda.mn.ru/opinions/20130701/350508736.html| archive-url =https://archive.is/20140220005412/http://pda.mn.ru/opinions/20130701/350508736.html| dead-url =yes| archive-date =20 February 2014| title =Ощущение цитаты| publisher =''[[Moskovskiye Novosti]]''| language =Russian| accessdate =20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase did not appear in the published protocol of the conference, but within days after that event people in Moscow started to wear lapel buttons saying, "Yegor, you are wrong!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =O'Clery | first =Conor | title =Moscow, December 25, 1991: The Last Day of the Soviet Union| publisher =PublicAffairs | year =2011 | page =65 | isbn =1610390121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase has been used in later Russian publications to admonish or rebuke the opposing side in the form "''N,'' you are wrong". Following Yeltsin's death in 2007, Ligachev upheld his criticism by saying that what he told Yeltsin back then was right in his opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://politsovet.ru/18209-.html| title =Егор Лигачев: Говоря: "Борис, ты не прав!", я не ошибся |publisher =Politsovet.ru|language=Russian| accessdate =20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ligachev's own 2012 memoir book is titled ''Boris Was Wrong'' ({{ISBN|978-5-4438-0089-9}}).

The '''Build the Wall, Enforce the Law Act of 2018''' ({{USBill|115|hr|7059}}) is a [[United States Congress]] [[Bill (law)|bill]] to fund President [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016#Border wall and illegal immigration|border wall]] along the [[Mexico–United States border]] and to follow federal immigration law. Estimated at $23.4 billion, the bill, along with the $1.6 billion from the [[Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018]], would amount to the $25 billion projected to complete the larger and fortified wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fredericks|first1=Bob|title=Trump says he wants another $1.6 billion for border wall|url=https://nypost.com/2018/06/26/trump-says-he-wants-another-1-6-billion-for-border-wall/|accessdate=9 October 2018|publisher=New York Post|date=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was introduced on October 12, 2018 by [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Leader]] [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]], who stated that "President Trump’s [[United States presidential election, 2016|election]] was a wakeup call to Washington.

For too long, America has failed in this responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Reilly|first1=Andrew|title=McCarthy introducing bill to fully fund Trump border wall|url=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mccarthy-to-introduce-bill-to-fully-fund-trumps-border-wall|accessdate=9 October 2018|publisher=Fox News|date=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Segers|first1=Grace|title=Kevin McCarthy says he will introduce bill to fully fund border wall|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kevin-mccarthy-introducing-bill-to-fully-fund-border-wall/|accessdate=9 October 2018|publisher=CBS News|date=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Clash of Civilizations''' is a hypothesis that people's [[cultural identity|cultural]] and [[Religious identity|religious]] [[Identity (social science)|identities]] will be the primary source of conflict in the post-[[Cold War]] world. The American political scientist [[Samuel P. Huntington]] argued that future wars would be fought not between countries, but between cultures, and that [[Islamic extremism]] would become the biggest threat to world peace. It was proposed in a 1992 lecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aei.org/issue/29196 |title=U.S. Trade Policy – Economics |publisher=AEI |date=2007-02-15 |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629170348/http://www.aei.org/issue/29196 |archivedate=2013-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[American Enterprise Institute]], which was then developed in a 1993 ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' article titled "The Clash of Civilizations?",&lt;ref name="FAarticle"&gt;Official copy (free preview): [https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/1993-06-01/clash-civilizations The Clash of Civilizations?], ''Foreign Affairs'', Summer 1993&lt;/ref&gt; in response to his former student [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s 1992 book, ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]''. Huntington later expanded his thesis in a 1996 book ''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order''.

The phrase itself was earlier used by [[Albert Camus]] in 1946,&lt;ref&gt;{{quote|le problème russo-américain, et là nous revenons à l’Algérie, va être dépassé lui-même avant très peu, cela ne sera pas un choc d’empires nous assistons au choc de civilisations et nous voyons dans le monde entier les civilisations colonisées surgir peu à peu et se dresser contre les civilisations colonisatrices.}} http://www.ina.fr/audio/PHD85011203&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Girilal Jain]] in his analysis of the [[Ayodhya dispute]] in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;Elst K., Some recollections from my acquaintance with Sita Ram Goel in Elst, K. (2005). India's only communalist: In commemoration of Sita Ram Goel. [https://www.academia.edu/20079544/_Some_recollections_from_my_acquaintance_with_Sita_Ram_Goel_ch.6_of_K._Elst_ed._Indias_Only_Communalist_In_Commemoration_of_Sita_Ram_Goel] Also: Elst, K. India's Only Communalist: an Introduction to the Work of Sita Ram Goel, in Sharma, A. (2001). Hinduism and secularism: After Ayodhya. Basingstoke: Palgrave.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Bernard Lewis]] in an article in the September 1990 issue of ''[[The Atlantic|The Atlantic Monthly]]'' titled "The Roots of Muslim Rage"&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lewis: [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1990/09/the-roots-of-muslim-rage/4643/ The Roots of Muslim Rage] ''The Atlantic Monthly'', September 1990&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Mahdi Elmandjra|Mahdi El Mandjra]] in his book "La première guerre civilisationnelle" published in 1992&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Premi%C3%A8re_guerre_civilisationnelle.html?id=AhVIAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Première guerre civilisationnelle|last=Elmandjra|first=Mahdi|date=1992|publisher=Toubkal|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel P. Huntington, The Clash of Civilizations (1996), p. 246: " 'La premiere guerre civilisationnelle' the distinguished Moroccan scholar Mahdi Elmandjra called the Gulf War as it was being fought."&lt;/ref&gt;. Even earlier, the phrase appears in a 1926 book regarding the Middle East by Basil Mathews: ''Young Islam on Trek:  A Study in the Clash of Civilizations'' (p.&amp;nbsp;196). This expression derives from "clash of cultures", already used during the colonial period and the [[Belle Époque]].&lt;ref&gt;Louis Massignon, ''La psychologie musulmane'' (1931), in Idem, ''Ecrits mémorables'', t. I, Paris, Robert Laffont, 2009, p. 629: "Après la venue de Bonaparte au Caire, le ''clash of cultures'' entre l'ancienne Chrétienté et l'Islam prit un nouvel aspect, par invasion (sans échange) de l'échelle de valeurs occidentales dans la mentalité collective musulmane."&lt;/ref&gt;

Huntington began his thinking by surveying the diverse theories about the nature of global politics in the post-Cold War period. Some theorists and writers argued that [[human rights]], [[liberal democracy]], and the capitalist free market economy had become the only remaining ideological alternative for nations in the post-Cold War world. Specifically, [[Francis Fukuyama]] argued that the world had reached the '[[end of history]]' in a [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegelian]] sense.

Huntington believed that while the age of [[ideology]] had ended, the world had only reverted to a normal state of affairs characterized by cultural conflict. In his thesis, he argued that the primary axis of conflict in the future will be along cultural lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/mehbaliyev/rashad-mehbaliyev-civilizations-their-nature-and-clash-possibilities|title=Civilizations, their nature and clash possibilities (c) Rashad Mehbal…|first=|last=mehbaliyev|date=30 October 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an extension, he posits that the concept of different [[civilization]]s, as the highest rank of [[cultural identity]], will become increasingly useful in analyzing the potential for conflict. At the end of his 1993 ''Foreign Affairs'' article, "The Clash of Civilizations?", Huntington writes, "This is not to advocate the desirability of conflicts between civilizations. It is to set forth descriptive hypothesis as to what the future may be like."&lt;ref name="FAarticle"/&gt;

In addition, the clash of civilizations, for Huntington, represents a development of history. In the past, world history was mainly about the struggles between monarchs, nations and ideologies, such as seen within Western civilization. But after the end of the [[Cold War]], world politics moved into a new phase, in which non-Western civilizations are no longer the exploited recipients of Western civilization but have become additional important actors joining the West to shape and move world history.&lt;ref&gt;Murden S. Cultures in world affairs. In: Baylis J, Smith S, Owens P, editors. The Globalization of World Politics. 5th ed. New York: Oxford University Press; 2011. p. 416-426.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major civilizations according to Huntington==
[[File:Clash of Civilizations mapn2.png|thumb|center|750px|The clash of civilizations according to Huntington (1996), as presented in the book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://s02.middlebury.edu/FS056A/Herb_war/clash3.htm THE WORLD OF CIVILIZATIONS: POST-1990] scanned image {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312101415/http://s02.middlebury.edu/FS056A/Herb_war/clash3.htm |date=March 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Huntington divided the world into the "major civilizations" in his thesis as such:
* [[Western world|Western]] civilization, comprising the United States and Canada, Western and Central Europe, Australia and Oceania. Whether Latin  America and the [[Post-Soviet states|former member states]] of the Soviet Union are included, or are instead their own separate civilizations, will be an important future consideration for those regions, according to Huntington. The traditional Western viewpoint identified Western Civilization with the [[Western Christianity|Western Christian]] ([[Catholic Church|Catholic]]-[[Protestantism|Protestant]]) countries and culture.&lt;ref name="google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=%22western+christianity%22+%22western+world%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3US_UfOUN9D04QTElIHwDQ&amp;ved=0CCUQpwUoBA&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A1800%2Ccd_max%3A1960&amp;tbm=bks|title="western christianity" "western world" - Google Search|website=google.com|accessdate=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Latin America]]n. Includes Central America, South America (excluding [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]] and [[French Guiana]]), [[Cuba]], the [[Dominican Republic]], and [[Mexico]]. May be considered a part of Western civilization. Many people in [[South America]] and [[Mexico]] regard themselves as full members of Western civilization (especially [[White Latin Americans]]).
* The [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] world of the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]], the former [[Yugoslavia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Cyprus]], [[Greece]] and [[Romania]].
** Countries with a non-Orthodox majority are usually excluded e.g. Muslim [[Azerbaijan]] and Muslim [[Albania]] and most of [[Central Asia]], as well as majority Muslim regions in the [[Balkans]], [[Caucasus]] and central Russian regions such as [[Tatarstan]] and [[Bashkortostan]], Roman Catholic [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]], Protestant and Catholic [[Baltic states]]). However, [[Armenia]] is included, despite its dominant faith, the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], being a part of [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] rather than the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], and [[Kazakhstan]] is also included, despite its dominant faith being [[Sunni Islam]].
* The [[Eastern world]] is the mix of the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], [[Greater China|Chinese]], [[Hindu]], and [[Japan|Japonic]] civilizations.
** The [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] areas of [[Bhutan]], [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Mongolia]], [[Myanmar]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Thailand]] are identified as separate from other civilizations, but Huntington believes that they do not constitute a major civilization in the sense of international affairs.
** The [[Confucianism|Confucian]] civilization of China, the [[Korea]]s, [[Singapore]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Vietnam]]. This group also includes the [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese diaspora]], especially in relation to Southeast Asia.

* The civilization of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] located in Southern Africa, Middle Africa (excluding Chad), East Africa (excluding [[Ethiopia]], the [[Comoros]], [[Mauritius]], and the [[Swahili coast]] of [[Kenya]] and [[Tanzania]]), [[Cape Verde]], [[Ghana]], the [[Ivory Coast]], [[Liberia]], and [[Sierra Leone]]. Considered as a possible 8th civilization by Huntington.
* Instead of belonging to one of the "major" civilizations, [[Ethiopia]] and [[Haiti]] are labeled as "Lone" countries. [[Israel]] could be considered a unique state with its own civilization, Huntington writes, but one which is extremely similar to the West. Huntington also believes that the [[Commonwealth Caribbean|Anglophone Caribbean]], former British colonies in the Caribbean, constitutes a distinct entity.
* There are also others which are considered "cleft countries" because they contain very large groups of people identifying with separate civilizations. Examples include [[Ukraine]] ("cleft" between its [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Eastern Rite Catholic]]-dominated western section and its [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)|Orthodox]]-dominated east), [[French Guiana]] (cleft between Latin America, and the West), [[Benin]], [[Chad]], [[Kenya]], [[Nigeria]], [[Tanzania]], and [[Togo]] (all cleft between Islam and Sub-Saharan Africa), [[Guyana]] and [[Suriname]] (cleft between Hindu and Sub-Saharan African), [[Sri Lanka]] (cleft between Hindu and Buddhist), [[China]] (cleft between Sinic and Buddhist, in the case of [[Tibet]]; and the West, in the case of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]), and the [[Philippines]] (cleft between Islam, in the case of [[Mindanao]]; Sinic, in the case of [[Cordillera Administrative Region|Cordillera]]; and the West). [[Sudan]] was also included as "cleft" between Islam and Sub-Saharan Africa; this division became a formal split in July 2011 following an overwhelming vote for independence by [[South Sudan]] in a [[South Sudanese independence referendum, 2011|January 2011 referendum]].

==Huntington's thesis of civilizational clash==
[[File:Samuel P. Huntington (2004 World Economic Forum).jpg|thumb|Huntington at the 2004 World Economic Forum]]
Huntington argues that the trends of global conflict after the end of the Cold War are increasingly appearing at these civilizational divisions. Wars such as those following the break up of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], in [[Chechnya]], and between India and Pakistan were cited as evidence of inter-civilizational conflict. He also argues that the widespread Western belief in the universality of the West's values and political systems is naïve and that continued insistence on democratization and such "universal" norms will only further antagonize other civilizations. Huntington sees the West as reluctant to accept this because it built the international system, wrote its laws, and gave it substance in the form of the [[United Nations]].

Huntington identifies a major shift of economic, military, and political power from the West to the other civilizations of the world, most significantly to what he identifies as the two "challenger civilizations", Sinic and Islam.

In Huntington's view, East Asian Sinic civilization is culturally asserting itself and its values relative to the West due to its rapid economic growth. Specifically, he believes that China's goals are to reassert itself as the regional [[hegemon]], and that other countries in the region will 'bandwagon' with China due to the history of hierarchical command structures implicit in the [[Confucian]] Sinic civilization, as opposed to the individualism and pluralism valued in the West. Regional powers such as the two Koreas and Vietnam will acquiesce to Chinese demands and become more supportive of China rather than attempting to oppose it. Huntington therefore believes that the rise of China poses one of the most significant problems and the most powerful long-term threat to the West, as Chinese cultural assertion clashes with the American desire for the lack of a regional hegemony in East Asia.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Huntington argues that the Islamic civilization has experienced a massive population explosion which is fueling instability both on the [[Divisions of the world in Islam|borders of Islam]] and in its interior, where [[Islamic fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] movements are becoming increasingly popular. Manifestations of what he terms the "[[Islamic revival|Islamic Resurgence]]" include the [[1979 Iranian revolution]] and the first [[Gulf War]]. Perhaps the most controversial statement Huntington made in the ''Foreign Affairs'' article was that "Islam has bloody borders". Huntington believes this to be a real consequence of several factors, including the previously mentioned Muslim [[youth bulge]] and population growth and Islamic proximity to many civilizations including Sinic, Orthodox, Western, and African.

Huntington sees Islamic civilization as a potential ally to China, both having more revisionist goals and sharing common conflicts with other civilizations, especially the West. Specifically, he identifies common Chinese and Islamic interests in the areas of weapons proliferation, human rights, and democracy that conflict with those of the West, and feels that these are areas in which the two civilizations will cooperate.

Russia, Japan, and India are what Huntington terms 'swing civilizations' and may favor either side. Russia, for example, clashes with the many Muslim ethnic groups on its southern border (such as [[Chechnya]]) but—according to Huntington—cooperates with Iran to avoid further Muslim-Orthodox violence in Southern Russia, and to help continue the flow of oil. Huntington argues that a "[[Sino-Islamic connection]]" is emerging in which China will cooperate more closely with [[Iran]], Pakistan, and other states to augment its international position.

Huntington also argues that civilizational conflicts are "particularly prevalent between Muslims and non-Muslims", identifying the "bloody borders" between Islamic and non-Islamic civilizations. This conflict dates back as far as the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|initial thrust of Islam into Europe]], its eventual expulsion in the [[Reconquista|Iberian reconquest]], the attacks of the Ottoman Turks on Eastern Europe and Vienna, and the European imperial division of the Islamic nations in the 1800s and 1900s.

Huntington also believes that some of the factors contributing to this conflict are that both Christianity (upon which Western civilization is based) and Islam are:
* Missionary religions, seeking conversion of others
* Universal, "all-or-nothing" religions, in the sense that it is believed by both sides that only their faith is the correct one
* [[Teleological]] religions, that is, that their values and beliefs represent the goals of existence and purpose in human existence.

More recent factors contributing to a Western–Islamic clash, Huntington wrote, are the [[Islamic revival|Islamic Resurgence]] and demographic explosion in Islam, coupled with the values of Western universalism—that is, the view that all civilizations should adopt Western values—that infuriate Islamic fundamentalists. All these historical and modern factors combined, Huntington wrote briefly in his ''Foreign Affairs'' article and in much more detail in his 1996 book, would lead to a bloody clash between the Islamic and Western civilizations.

===Why civilizations will clash===
Huntington offers six explanations for why civilizations will clash:
# Differences among civilizations are too basic in that civilizations are differentiated from each other by history, language, culture, tradition, and, most importantly, religion. These fundamental differences are the product of centuries and the foundations of different civilizations, meaning they will not be gone soon.
# The world is becoming a smaller place. As a result, interactions across the world are increasing, which intensify "civilization consciousness" and the awareness of differences between civilizations and commonalities within civilizations.
# Due to economic modernization and social change, people are separated from longstanding local identities. Instead, religion has replaced this gap, which provides a basis for identity and commitment that transcends national boundaries and unites civilizations.
# The growth of civilization-consciousness is enhanced by the dual role of the West. On the one hand, the West is at a peak of power. At the same time, a return-to-the-roots phenomenon is occurring among non-Western civilizations. A West at the peak of its power confronts non-Western countries that increasingly have the desire, the will and the resources to shape the world in non-Western ways.
# Cultural characteristics and differences are less mutable and hence less easily compromised and resolved than political and economic ones.
# Economic regionalism is increasing. Successful economic regionalism will reinforce civilization-consciousness. Economic regionalism may succeed only when it is rooted in a common civilization.

===The West versus the Rest===
Huntington suggests that in the future the central axis of world politics tends to be the conflict between Western and non-Western civilizations, in [Stuart Hall]'s phrase, the conflict between "the West and the Rest". He offers three forms of general actions that non-Western civilization can take in response to Western countries.&lt;ref&gt;Hungtington SP, The Clash of Civilizations? In: Lechner FJ, Boli J, editors. The globalization reader. 4th ed. West Sussex: Wiley-Blackwell; 2012. 37–44&lt;/ref&gt;
# Non-Western countries can attempt to achieve isolation in order to preserve their own values and protect themselves from Western invasion. However, Huntington argues that the costs of this action are high and only a few states can pursue it.
# According to the theory of "[[Bandwagoning|band-wagoning]]" non-Western countries can join and accept Western values.
# Non-Western countries can make an effort to balance Western power through modernization. They can develop economic, military power and cooperate with other non-Western countries against the West while still preserving their own values and institutions. Huntington believes that the increasing power of non-Western civilizations in international society will make the West begin to develop a better understanding of the cultural fundamentals underlying other civilizations. Therefore, Western civilization will cease to be regarded as "universal" but different civilizations will learn to coexist and join to shape the future world.

===Core state and fault line conflicts===
&lt;!-- Possible link target. Please check before changing sub-section header. --&gt;
In Huntington's view, intercivilizational conflict manifests itself in two forms: fault line conflicts and core state conflicts.

''[[Fault line war|Fault line conflicts]]'' are on a local level and occur between adjacent states belonging to different civilizations or within states that are home to populations from different civilizations.

''Core state conflicts'' are on a global level between the major states of different civilizations. Core state conflicts can arise out of fault line conflicts when core states become involved.&lt;ref name="Huntington1"&gt;{{cite book

These conflicts may result from a number of causes, such as: relative influence or power (military or economic), discrimination against people from a different civilization, intervention to protect kinsmen in a different civilization, or different values and culture, particularly when one civilization attempts to impose its values on people of a different civilization.&lt;ref name="Huntington1"/&gt;

==Modernization, Westernization, and "torn countries"==
{{weasel|date=October 2012}}
Critics of Huntington's ideas often extend their criticisms to [[tradition]]al [[culture]]s and internal reformers who wish to modernize without adopting the values and attitudes of [[Westernization|Western]] culture. These critics{{Who|date=November 2009}} sometimes claim that to modernize it is necessary to become Westernized to a very large extent, so that sources of tension with the West will be reduced.

Japan, China and the [[Four Asian Tigers]] have modernized in many respects while maintaining traditional or authoritarian societies which distinguish them from the West. Some of these countries have clashed with the West and some have not.

Perhaps the ultimate example of non-Western modernization is Russia, the core state of the Orthodox civilization. Huntington argues that Russia is primarily a non-Western state although he seems to agree that it shares a considerable amount of cultural ancestry with the modern West. According to Huntington, the West is distinguished from Orthodox Christian countries by its experience of the [[Renaissance]], [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]; by overseas [[colonialism]] rather than contiguous expansion and colonialism; and by the infusion of [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] culture through [[ancient Greece]] rather than through the continuous trajectory of the [[Byzantine Empire]].

Huntington refers to countries that are seeking to affiliate with another civilization as "torn countries". [[Turkey]], whose political leadership has systematically tried to Westernize the country since the 1920s, is his chief example. Turkey's history, culture, and traditions are derived from Islamic civilization, but Turkey's elite, beginning with [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] who took power as first President in 1923, imposed Western institutions and dress, embraced the [[Latin alphabet]], joined [[NATO]], and has sought to [[European Union–Turkey relations|join the European Union]].

Mexico and Russia are also considered to be torn by Huntington. He also gives the example of Australia as a country torn between its Western civilizational heritage and its growing economic engagement with Asia.

According to Huntington, a torn country must meet three requirements to redefine its civilizational identity. Its political and economic elite must support the move. Second, the public must be willing to accept the redefinition. Third, the elites of the civilization that the torn country is trying to join must accept the country.

The book claims that to date no torn country has successfully redefined its civilizational identity, this mostly due to the elites of the 'host' civilization refusing to accept the torn country, though if Turkey gained membership in the [[European Union]], it has been noted that many of its people would support Westernization, as in the following quote by EU Minister Egemen Bağış: "This is what Europe needs to do: they need to say that when Turkey fulfills all requirements, Turkey will become a member of the EU on date X. Then, we will regain the Turkish public opinion support in one day."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euractiv.com.tr/ab-ve-turkiye/article/bagis-fransanin-tutumunda-degisimin-basladigini-goruyoruz-027174 Bağış: Fransa'nın tutumunda değişimin başladığını görüyoruz | AB ve Türkiye | EurActiv.com.tr – Türkiye’nin online AB Gazetesi&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109202339/http://www.euractiv.com.tr/ab-ve-turkiye/article/bagis-fransanin-tutumunda-degisimin-basladigini-goruyoruz-027174 |date=January 9, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If this were to happen, it would, according to Huntington, be the first to redefine its civilizational identity.

==Criticism==
Huntington has fallen under the stern critique of various left-leaning academic writers, who have either empirically, historically, logically, or ideologically challenged his claims (Fox, 2005; Mungiu Pippidi &amp; Mindruta, 2002; Henderson &amp; Tucker, 2001; Russett, Oneal, &amp; Cox, 2000; Harvey, 2000).&lt;ref&gt;Fox, J.

&lt;!-- Other books, written for the general public, similarly challenge Huntington's contentious claims. For example, in his work ''Identity and Violence: The illusion of destiny'', The Nobel Laureate [[Amartya Sen]] advances several critiques of Huntington's main concept of an inevitable clash along civilizational lines. He argues that violence occurs when individuals see each other as having a singular affiliation (e.g., Hindu, Muslim, Christian), as opposed to multiple affiliations: e.g., Hindu, woman, housewife, mother, artist, daughter, member of a particular socio-economic class etc. In this sense, and to the detriment of civilization distinctiveness, it is argued that all of these dimensions can, and should be a source of a personal identity.&lt;ref&gt; Sen, Amartya (2006). Identity and  Violence. New York: W.W. Norton. &lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;
In an article explicitly referring to Huntington, scholar &lt;!--the same --&gt;[[Amartya Sen]] (1999) argues:&lt;blockquote&gt;diversity is a feature of most cultures in the world. Western civilization is no exception. The practice of democracy that has won out in the modern West is largely a result of a consensus that has emerged since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the [[Industrial Revolution]], and particularly in the last century or so. To read in this a historical commitment of the West—over the millennia—to democracy, and then to contrast it with non-Western traditions (treating each as monolithic) would be a great mistake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sen A |year=1999 |title=Democracy as a Universal Value |journal=Journal of Democracy |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=3–17 |doi=10.1353/jod.1999.0055}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|16}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;In his 2003 book ''Terror and Liberalism'', [[Paul Berman]] argues that distinct cultural boundaries do not exist in the present day. He argues there is no "Islamic civilization" nor a "Western civilization", and that the evidence for a civilization clash is not convincing, especially when considering relationships such as that between the United States and [[Saudi Arabia]]. In addition, he cites the fact that many Islamic extremists spent a significant amount of time living or studying in the Western world. According to Berman, conflict arises because of [[Philosophy|philosophical]] beliefs various groups share (or do not share), regardless of cultural or religious identity.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Paul (2003). Terror and Liberalism. W W Norton &amp; Company. {{ISBN|0-393-05775-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Timothy Garton Ash]] objects to the ‘extreme cultural determinism… crude to the point of parody’ of Huntington’s idea that Catholic and Protestant Europe is headed for democracy but that Orthodox Christian and Islamic Europe must accept dictatorship. &lt;ref&gt; [[Timothy Garton Ash]], [[History of the Present]], Penguin, 2000, p 388-389 &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Said]] issued a response to Huntington's thesis in his 2001 article, "[[The Clash of Ignorance]]".&lt;ref&gt;Edward Said: [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20011022/said The Clash of Ignorance] The Nation, October 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Said argues that Huntington's categorization of the world's fixed "civilizations" omits the dynamic interdependency and interaction of culture. A longtime critic of the Huntingtonian paradigm, and an outspoken proponent of Arab issues, Edward Said (2004) also argues that the clash of civilizations thesis is an example of "the purest invidious racism, a sort of parody of Hitlerian science directed today against Arabs and Muslims" (p.&amp;nbsp;293).&lt;ref&gt;Said, E. W. (2004). From Oslo to Iraq and the Road Map. New York: Pantheon, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Noam Chomsky]] has criticized the concept of the clash of civilizations as just being a new justification for the United States "for any atrocities that they wanted to carry out", which was required after the [[Cold War]] as the [[Soviet Union]] was no longer a viable threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TrystanCJ|title=Noam Chomsky on The "Clash of Civilizations"|date=2007-03-02|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qT64TNho59I&amp;feature=youtu.be|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intermediate Region===
Huntington's geopolitical model, especially the structures for North Africa and Eurasia, is largely derived from the "[[Intermediate Region]]" geopolitical model first formulated by [[Dimitri Kitsikis]] and published in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitri Kitsikis, ''A Comparative History of Greece and Turkey in the 20th century''. In Greek, ''Συγκριτική Ἱστορία Ἑλλάδος καί Τουρκίας στόν 20ό αἰῶνα'', Athens, Hestia, 1978. Supplemented 2nd edition: Hestia, 1990. 3rd edition: Hestia, 1998, 357 pp.. In Turkish, ''Yırmı Asırda Karşılaştırmalı Türk-Yunan Tarihi'', İstanbul, Türk Dünyası Araştırmaları Dergisi, II-8, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; The Intermediate Region, which spans the [[Adriatic Sea]] and the [[Indus River]], is neither Western nor Eastern (at least, with respect to the Far East) but is considered distinct.Concerning this region, Huntington departs from Kitsikis contending that a civilizational fault line exists between the two dominant yet differing religions ([[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] and [[Sunni Islam]]), hence a dynamic of external conflict. However, Kitsikis establishes an integrated civilization comprising these two peoples along with those belonging to the less dominant religions of [[Shia Islam]], [[Alevism]], and [[Judaism]]. They have a set of mutual cultural, social, economic and political views and norms which radically differ from those in the West and the Far East.In the Intermediate Region, therefore, one cannot speak of a civilizational clash or external conflict, but rather an internal conflict, not for cultural domination, but for political succession. This has been successfully demonstrated by documenting the rise of Christianity from the Hellenized [[Roman Empire]], the rise of the [[Caliphate|Islamic caliphates]] from the [[Byzantine Empire|Christianized Roman Empire]] and the rise of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule from the Islamic caliphates and the Christianized Roman Empire.

===Opposing concepts===
In recent years, the theory of [[Dialogue Among Civilizations]], a response to Huntington's Clash of Civilizations, has become the center of some international attention. The concept was originally coined by Austrian philosopher [[Hans Köchler]] in an essay on cultural identity (1972).&lt;ref&gt;"Kulturelles Selbstverständnis und Koexistenz: Voraussetzungen für einen fundamentalen Dialog" (Cultural Identity and Co-existence: Preconditions for a Fundamental Dialogue). Public lecture delivered at the University of Innsbruck, Austria, 19 October 1972, published in: ''Philosophie und Politik. Dokumentation eines interdisziplinären Seminars''. (Publications of the Working Group for Science and Politics at the University of Innsbruck, Vol. IV.) Innsbruck: Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Wissenschaft und Politik, 1973, pp. 75-78.&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to [[UNESCO]], Köchler had earlier proposed that the cultural organization of the United Nations should take up the issue of a "dialogue between different civilizations" (''dialogue entre les différentes civilisations'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://i-p-o.org/Koechler-letter-UNESCO-26Sep1972.jpg Letter dated 26 September 1972], addressed to the Division of Philosophy of UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Iranian president [[Mohammad Khatami]] introduced the concept at the global level. At his initiative, the United Nations proclaimed the year 2001 as the "United Nations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/dialogue2001/en/khatami.htm http://www.unesco.org/dialogue2001/en/khatami.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030216000000/http://www.unesco.org/dialogue2001/en/khatami.htm |date=February 16, 2003 }} ''Unesco.org'' Retrieved on 05-24-07&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dialoguecentre.org/about.html http://www.dialoguecentre.org/about.html] ''Dialoguecentre.org'' Retrieved on 05-24-07&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.unu.edu/dialogue/ Dialogue Among Civilizations] United Nations University Centre&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Alliance of Civilizations]] (AOC) initiative was proposed at the 59th [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly of the United Nations]] in 2005 by the Spanish Prime Minister, [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] and co-sponsored by the Turkish Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]]. The initiative is intended to galvanize collective action across diverse societies to combat [[extremism]], to overcome cultural and social barriers between mainly the Western and predominantly Muslim worlds, and to reduce the tensions and polarization between societies which differ in religious and cultural values.

'''Classical liberalism''' is a [[political ideology]] and a [[History of liberalism|branch]] of [[liberalism]] which advocates [[civil liberties]] under the [[rule of law]] with an emphasis on [[economic freedom]]. Closely related to [[economic liberalism]], it developed in the early 19th century, building on ideas from the previous century as a response to [[urbanization]] and to the [[Industrial Revolution]] in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]].{{sfn|Conway|p=296}}&lt;ref name="google.com"&gt;{{cite book|first = Richard |last =Hudelson |date = 1999|url = https://www.google.com/books?id=sq-1z8VMhDEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Modern%20Political%20Philosophy&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title= Modern Political Philosophy|pages =  37–38|isbn =9780765600219|publisher = M.E. Sharpe}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Dickerson|Flanagan|O'Neill|p=129}} Notable individuals whose ideas contributed to classical liberalism include [[John Locke]],&lt;ref name="Steven M. Dworetz 1994"&gt;Steven M. Dworetz (1994). ''The Unvarnished Doctrine: Locke, Liberalism, and the American Revolution''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Baptiste Say]], [[Thomas Robert Malthus]], and [[David Ricardo]]. It drew on the [[Classical economics|classical economic ideas]] espoused by [[Adam Smith]] in Book One of ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' and on a belief in [[natural law]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Joyce Appleby|first = Joyce|last = Appleby|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=83HlqTJjLcgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |date = 1992|title = Liberalism and Republicanism in the Historical Imagination|page = 58|publisher =Harvard University Press|isbn = 9780674530133}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[utilitarianism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1 = Gerald F.|last1= Gaus |author2-link= Chandran Kukathas|first2 = Chandran|last2= Kukathas|date = 2004|title = Handbook of Political Theory |page = 422|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dXjXKlb79cgC&amp;pg=PA422#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher = SAGE|isbn =  9780761967873}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Social progress|progress]].{{sfn|Hunt|p=54}} The term "classical liberalism" was applied in retrospect to distinguish earlier 19th-century liberalism from the newer [[social liberalism]].{{sfn|Richardson|p=52}}

== Evolution of core beliefs ==
Core beliefs of classical liberals included new ideas—which departed from both the older [[Conservatism|conservative]] idea of [[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft|society as a family]] and from the later [[Sociology|sociological]] concept of society as [[Gesellschaft#Gesellschaft|complex set]] of [[social network]]s. Classical liberals believe that individuals are "egoistic, coldly calculating, essentially inert and atomistic"{{sfn|Hunt|p=44}} and that society is no more than the sum of its individual members.{{sfn|Hunt|pp=44–46}}

Classical liberals agreed with [[Thomas Hobbes]] that government had been created by individuals to protect themselves from each other and that the purpose of government should be to minimize conflict between individuals that would otherwise arise in a [[state of nature]]. These beliefs were complemented by a belief that laborers could be best motivated by financial incentive. This belief led to the passage of the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834]], which limited the provision of social assistance, based on the idea that [[Market (economics)|markets]] are the mechanism that most efficiently leads to wealth. Adopting [[Thomas Robert Malthus]]'s population theory, they saw poor urban conditions as inevitable, they believed population growth would outstrip food production and they regarded that consequence desirable because starvation would help limit population growth. They opposed any income or wealth redistribution, which they believed would be dissipated by the lowest orders.{{sfn|Hunt|pp=49–51}}

Drawing on ideas of [[Adam Smith]], classical liberals believed that it is in the common interest that all individuals be able to secure their own economic self-interest. They were critical of what would come to be the idea of the [[welfare state]] as interfering in a [[free market]].&lt;ref name="Ryan"&gt;Alan Ryan, "Liberalism", in ''A Companion to Contemporary Political Philosophy'', ed. Robert E. Goodin and Philip Pettit (Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 1995), p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Smith’s resolute recognition of the importance and value of labor and of laborers, they selectively criticized labour's [[group rights]] being pursued at the expense of [[individual rights]]&lt;ref&gt;Evans, M. ed. (2001): ''Edinburgh Companion to Contemporary Liberalism: Evidence and Experience'', London: Routledge, 55 ({{ISBN|1-57958-339-3}}).&lt;/ref&gt; while accepting [[Economic liberalism|corporations' rights]], which led to [[inequality of bargaining power]].{{sfn|Dickerson|Flanagan|O'Neill|p=132}}&lt;ref name = smith&gt;{{cite book|last =Smith|first = A. |date = 1778|title =  An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations|volume = I|chapter = 8|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=KpWg1DYxRTwC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=%22public+good%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lgx2t0b3Xu&amp;sig=ygsWFIUuw8JhsxYeiXgaiE5LdNc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RGFIUfzqNe-N4gTvqoDgDA&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22public%20good%22&amp;f=false|publisher = W. Strahan; and T. Cadell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical liberals argued that individuals should be free to obtain work from the highest-paying employers while the [[profit motive]] would ensure that products that people desired were produced at prices they would pay. In a free market, both labor and capital would receive the greatest possible reward while production would be organized efficiently to meet consumer demand.{{sfn|Hunt|pp=46–47}}

Classical liberals argued for what they called a minimal state, limited to the following functions:
* A government to protect individual rights and to provide services that cannot be provided in a free market.
* A common national defense to provide protection against foreign invaders.{{sfn|Hunt|pp=51–53}}
* Laws to provide protection for citizens from wrongs committed against them by other citizens, which included protection of private property, enforcement of contracts and common law.
* Building and maintaining public institutions.
* Public works that included a stable currency, standard weights and measures and building and upkeep of roads, canals, harbors, railways, communications and postal services.{{sfn|Hunt|pp=51–53}}

They asserted that rights are of a [[Negative and positive rights|negative]] nature, which require other individuals (and governments) to refrain from interfering with the free market, opposing social liberals who assert that individuals have positive rights, such as the right to vote, the right to an education, the right to health care and the right to a living wage. For society to guarantee positive rights, it requires taxation over and above the minimum needed to enforce negative rights.&lt;ref name=Cato_Institut_Kelley&gt;[[David Kelley|Kelly, D.]] (1998): ''A Life of One's Own: Individual Rights and the Welfare State'', Washington, DC: [[Cato Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Richardson|pp=36–38}}

Core beliefs of classical liberals did not necessarily include [[democracy]] or government by a majority vote by citizens because "there is nothing in the bare idea of majority rule to show that majorities will always respect the rights of property or maintain rule of law".&lt;ref name="RyanA_1995"&gt;Ryan, A. (1995): "Liberalism", In: Goodin, R. E. and Pettit, P., eds.: ''A Companion to Contemporary Political Philosophy'', Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[James Madison]] argued for a constitutional republic with protections for individual liberty over a [[pure democracy]], reasoning that in a pure democracy a "common passion or interest will, in almost every case, be felt by a majority of the whole...and there is nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party".&lt;ref&gt;James Madison, [[Federalist No. 10]] (22 November 1787), in Alexander Hamilton, John Jay and James Madison, ''The Federalist: A Commentary on the Constitution of the United States'', ed. Henry Cabot Lodge (New York, 1888), [https://books.google.com/books?id=XcllKruLvi4C&amp;pg=PA56&amp;vq=%22common+passion+or+interest%22 p. 56].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, classical liberalism developed into [[neo-classical liberalism]], which argued for government to be as small as possible to allow the exercise of [[individual freedom]]. In its most extreme form, neo-classical liberalism advocated [[Social Darwinism]].&lt;ref name="mayne"&gt;Mayne, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Right-libertarianism]] is a modern form of neo-classical liberalism.&lt;ref name="mayne"/&gt;

=== Friedrich Hayek's typology of beliefs ===
[[Friedrich Hayek]] identified two different traditions within classical liberalism: the "British tradition" and the "French tradition". Hayek saw the British philosophers [[Bernard Mandeville]], [[David Hume]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Adam Ferguson]], [[Josiah Tucker]] and [[William Paley]] as representative of a tradition that articulated beliefs in [[empiricism]], the [[common law]] and in traditions and institutions which had spontaneously evolved but were imperfectly understood. The French tradition included [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Marquis de Condorcet]], the [[Encyclopédistes|Encyclopedists]] and the [[Physiocrats]]. This tradition believed in rationalism and sometimes showed hostility to tradition and religion. Hayek conceded that the national labels did not exactly correspond to those belonging to each tradition: Hayek saw the Frenchmen [[Montesquieu]], [[Benjamin Constant]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] as belonging to the "British tradition" and the British [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Joseph Priestley]], [[Richard Price]] and [[Thomas Paine]] as belonging to the "French tradition".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite book|first = F. A. |last = Hayek|title = The Constitution of Liberty|location = London|publisher =  Routledge |date= 1976|pages =  55–56|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0otEBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Constitution+of+Liberty&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQ_a-MwpreAhUQXKwKHaLkCBMQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn = 9781317857808}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. A. Hayek, 'Individualism: True and False', in ''Individualism and Economic Order'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980), pp. 1–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Hayek also rejected the label ''[[laissez-faire]]'' as originating from the French tradition and alien to the beliefs of Hume and Smith.

[[Guido De Ruggiero]] also identified differences between "Montesquieu and Rousseau, the English and the democratic types of liberalism"{{sfn|De Ruggiero|p=71}} and argued that there was a "profound contrast between the two Liberal systems".{{sfn|De Ruggiero|p=81}} He claimed that the spirit of "authentic English Liberalism" had "built up its work piece by piece without ever destroying what had once been built, but basing upon it every new departure". This liberalism had  "insensibly adapted ancient institutions to modern needs" and "instinctively recoiled from all abstract proclamations of principles and rights".{{sfn|De Ruggiero|p=81}} Ruggiero claimed that this liberalism was challenged by what he called the "new Liberalism of France" that was characterised by egalitarianism and a "rationalistic consciousness".{{sfn|De Ruggiero|pp=81–82}}

In 1848, [[Francis Lieber]] distinguished between what he called "Anglican and Gallican Liberty". Lieber asserted that "independence in the highest degree, compatible with safety and broad national guarantees of liberty, is the great aim of Anglican liberty, and self-reliance is the chief source from which it draws its strength".{{sfn|Lieber|p=377}} On the other hand, Gallican liberty "is sought in government...the French look for the highest degree of political civilization in organizational, that is, in the highest degree of interference by public power".{{sfn|Lieber|pp=382–383}}

== History ==
=== Great Britain ===
Classical liberalism in Britain developed from [[Whigs (British political party)|Whiggery]] and [[Radicalism (historical)|radicalism]], was also heavily influenced by French [[physiocracy]] and represented a new political ideology. Whiggery had become a dominant ideology following the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 and was associated with the defence of the British Parliament, upholding the rule of law and defending [[landed property]]. The origins of rights were seen as being in an [[ancient constitution]], which had existed from [[time immemorial]]. These rights, which some Whigs considered to include freedom of the press and freedom of speech, were justified by custom rather than by [[natural rights]]. They believed that the power of the executive had to be constrained. While they supported limited suffrage, they saw voting as a privilege rather than as a right. However, there was no consistency in Whig ideology and diverse writers including [[John Locke]], [[David Hume]], [[Adam Smith]] and [[Edmund Burke]] were all influential among Whigs, although none of them was universally accepted.{{sfn|Vincent|pp=28-29}}

From the 1790s to the 1820s, British radicals concentrated on parliamentary and electoral reform, emphasising natural rights and popular sovereignty. [[Richard Price]] and [[Joseph Priestley]] adapted the language of Locke to the ideology of radicalism.{{sfn|Vincent|pp=28-29}} The radicals saw parliamentary reform as a first step toward dealing with their many grievances, including the treatment of [[English Dissenters|Protestant Dissenters]], the slave trade, high prices and high taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Michael J. |last=Turner |year=1999 |title=British Politics in an Age of Reform |location=Manchester, England |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0-7190-51869 |page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was greater unity to classical liberalism ideology than there had been with Whiggery. Classical liberals were committed to individualism, liberty and equal rights. They believed that required a free economy with minimal government interference. Writers such as [[John Bright]] and [[Richard Cobden]] opposed both aristocratic privilege and property, which they saw as an impediment to the development of a class of [[yeoman]] farmers. Some elements of Whiggery opposed this new thinking and were uncomfortable with the commercial nature of classical liberalism. These elements became associated with conservatism.{{sfn|Vincent|pp=29–30}}

[[File:1846 - Anti-Corn Law League Meeting.jpg|thumb|250px|A meeting of the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] in [[Exeter Hall]] in 1846]]
Classical liberalism was the dominant political theory in Britain from the early 19th century until the First World War. Its notable victories were the [[Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829]], the [[Reform Act of 1832]] and the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] in 1846. The [[Anti-Corn Law League]] brought together a coalition of liberal and radical groups in support of free trade under the leadership of [[Richard Cobden]] and [[John Bright]], who opposed militarism and public expenditure. Their policies of low public expenditure and low taxation were adopted by [[William Ewart Gladstone]] when he became [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and later [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. Classical liberalism was often associated with religious dissent and [[nonconformism]].{{sfn|Gray|pp=26–27}}

Although classical liberals aspired to a minimum of state activity, they accepted the principle of [[government intervention]] in the economy from the early 19th century with passage of the [[Factory Acts]]. From around 1840 to 1860, ''laissez-faire'' advocates of the [[Manchester capitalism|Manchester School]] and writers in ''[[The Economist]]'' were confident that their early victories would lead to a period of expanding economic and personal liberty and world peace, but would face reversals as government intervention and activity continued to expand from the 1850s. [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[James Mill]], although advocates of ''laissez-faire'', non-intervention in foreign affairs and individual liberty, believed that social institutions could be rationally redesigned through the principles of [[utilitarianism]]. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] rejected classical liberalism altogether and advocated [[Tory democracy]]. By the 1870s, [[Herbert Spencer]] and other classical liberals concluded that historical development was turning against them.{{sfn|Gray|p=28}} By the First World War, the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] had largely abandoned classical liberal principles.{{sfn|Gray|p=32}}

The changing economic and social conditions of the 19th century led to a division between neo-classical and social (or welfare) liberals, who while agreeing on the importance of individual liberty differed on the role of the state.  Neo-classical liberals, who called themselves "true liberals", saw Locke's ''[[Two Treatises of Government#Second Treatise|Second Treatise]]'' as the best guide and emphasised "limited government" while social liberals supported government regulation and the welfare state. Herbert Spencer in Britain and [[William Graham Sumner]] were the leading neo-classical liberal theorists of the 19th century.{{sfn|Ishiyama|Breuning|p=596}} Neo-classical liberalism has continued into the contemporary era, with writers such as [[John Rawls]].{{sfn|Ishiyama|Breuning|p=603}} The evolution from classical to social/welfare liberalism is for example reflected in Britain in the evolution of the thought of [[John Maynard Keynes]].&lt;ref&gt;See the studies of Keynes by [[Roy Harrod]], [[Robert Skidelsky]], [[Donald Moggridge]] and [[Donald Markwell]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
In the United States, liberalism took a strong root because it had little opposition to its ideals, whereas in Europe liberalism was opposed by many reactionary or feudal interests such as the nobility, the aristocracy, the landed gentry, the established church and the aristocratic army officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first =Louis|last= Hartz|title=The Liberal Tradition in America|date=1955|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=e1bQY1CDx2IC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |chapter = The Concept of a Liberal Society|isbn = 9780156512695|publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Jefferson]] adopted many of the ideals of liberalism, but in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] changed Locke's "life, liberty and property" to the more [[Social liberalism|socially liberal]] "[[Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness]]".&lt;ref name="Steven M. Dworetz 1994"/&gt; As the United States grew, industry became a larger and larger part of American life; and during the term of its first [[Populism|populist]] [[President of the United States|President]], [[Andrew Jackson]], economic questions came to the forefront. The economic ideas of the [[Jacksonian democracy|Jacksonian era]] were almost universally the ideas of classical liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeremy M. Brown|title=Explaining the Reagan Years in Central America: A World System Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k9N1duU9zgMC&amp;pg=PA25|year=1995|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-8191-9813-6|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom was maximised when the government took a "hands off" attitude toward the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Kahan|title=The Homestead Strike: Labor, Violence, and American Industry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ctaTAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28|date=3 January 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-17397-4|page=28|quote=Called the "Jacksonian Era," this era was characterized by greater voting rights for white men, a hands-off approach to economic issues, and a desire to spread U.S. culture and government west (an outlook called "[[Manifest Destiny]]").}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Historian Kathleen G. Donohue argues:
:[A]t the center of classical liberal theory [in Europe] was the idea of ''laissez-faire''. To the vast majority of American classical liberals, however, ''laissez-faire'' did not mean no government intervention at all. On the contrary, they were more than willing to see government provide tariffs, railroad subsidies, and internal improvements, all of which benefited producers. What they condemned was intervention in behalf of consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kathleen G. Donohue|title=Freedom from Want: American Liberalism and the Idea of the Consumer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ud7TN4Asro8C&amp;pg=PA2|year=2005|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|page=2|isbn=9780801883910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading magazine ''[[The Nation]]'' espoused liberalism every week starting in 1865 under the influential editor [[Edwin Lawrence Godkin|Edwin Lawrence Godkin]] (1831–1902).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Gustav |last = Pollak|url = https://archive.org/details/fiftyyearsofamer00poll |title= Fifty Years of American Idealism: 1865-1915|date = 1915|publisher = Houghton Mifflin Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas of classical liberalism remained essentially unchallenged until a series of [[Depression (economics)|depressions]], thought to be impossible according to the tenets of [[classical economics]], led to economic hardship from which the voters demanded relief. In the words of [[William Jennings Bryan]], "[[Cross of Gold speech|You shall not crucify the American farmer on a cross of gold]]". Classical liberalism remained the orthodox belief among American businessmen until the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name=Voegelin&gt;Eric Voegelin, Mary Algozin, and Keith Algozin, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1406338 "Liberalism and Its History"], ''Review of Politics'' 36, no. 4 (1974): 504–520.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] of the 1930s saw a sea change in liberalism, with priority shifting from the producers to consumers. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] represented the dominance of [[modern liberalism]] in politics for decades. In the words of [[Arthur Schlesinger Jr.]]:&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schelesinger Jr., [http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/50s/schleslib.html "Liberalism in America: A Note for Europeans"], in ''The Politics of Hope'' (Boston: Riverside Press, 1962).&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|When the growing complexity of industrial conditions required increasing government intervention in order to assure more equal opportunities, the liberal tradition, faithful to the goal rather than to the dogma, altered its view of the state. [...] There emerged the conception of a social welfare state, in which the national government had the express obligation to maintain high levels of employment in the economy, to supervise standards of life and labour, to regulate the methods of business competition, and to establish comprehensive patterns of social security.|sign=|source=}}

[[Alan Wolfe]] summarizes the viewpoint that there is a continuous liberal understanding that includes both [[Adam Smith]] and [[John Maynard Keynes]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first = Alan|last = Wolfe|url = http://www.tnr.com/blog/alan-wolfe/false-distinction |title = A False Distinction |work = The New Republic|date = 12 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|The idea that liberalism comes in two forms assumes that the most fundamental question facing mankind is how much government intervenes into the economy... When instead we discuss human purpose and the meaning of life, Adam Smith and John Maynard Keynes are on the same side. Both of them possessed an expansive sense of what we are put on this earth to accomplish. [...] For Smith, mercantilism was the enemy of human liberty. For Keynes, monopolies were. It makes perfect sense for an eighteenth-century thinker to conclude that humanity would flourish under the market. For a twentieth century thinker committed to the same ideal, government was an essential tool to the same end.|sign=|source=}}

For as Hayek noted: "It is the doctrine on which the American system of government is based. "But, contemporary American conservatism is a novel brew which Micklethwait and Wooldridge rightly note is a mixture of the individualism of classical liberalism and "ubertraditionalism." It represents adherence to the bourgeois organization of society epitomized by that much-maligned word, "Victorian": with its faith in individualism, capitalism, progress, and virtue. Having been silenced by the seemingly endless march of "embedded liberalism" since the New Deal, American conservatism has, since the late 1960s, regrouped, and under Presidents Reagan and George W. Bush created a new powerful political movement. Thus, apart from the brief period of Margaret Thatcher's ascendancy in Britain, it is only in the United States that the classical liberal tradition continues to have political force.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intellectual sources ==
=== John Locke ===
[[File:Locke-John-LOC.jpg|thumb|160px|[[John Locke]]]]
Central to classical liberal ideology was their interpretation of [[John Locke]]'s ''[[Two Treatises of Government#Second Treatise|Second Treatise of Government]]'' and ''[[A Letter Concerning Toleration]]'', which had been written as a defence of the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Although these writings were considered too radical at the time for Britain's new rulers, they later came to be cited by Whigs, radicals and supporters of the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven M. Dworetz, ''The Unvarnished Doctrine: Locke, Liberalism, and the American Revolution'' (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; However, much of later liberal thought was absent in Locke's writings or scarcely mentioned and his writings have been subject to various interpretations. For example, there is little mention of [[constitutionalism]], the [[separation of powers]] and [[limited government]].{{sfn|Richardson|pp=22–23}}

James L. Richardson identified five central themes in Locke's writing: [[individualism]], consent, the concepts of the [[rule of law]] and government as trustee, the significance of property and religious toleration. Although Locke did not develop a theory of natural rights, he envisioned individuals in the state of nature as being free and equal. The individual, rather than the community or institutions, was the point of reference. Locke believed that individuals had given consent to government and therefore authority derived from the people rather than from above. This belief would influence later revolutionary movements.{{sfn|Richardson|p=23}}

As a trustee, government was expected to serve the interests of the people, not the rulers; and rulers were expected to follow the laws enacted by legislatures. Locke also held that the main purpose of men uniting into commonwealths and governments was for the preservation of their property. Despite the ambiguity of Locke's definition of property, which limited property to "as much land as a man tills, plants, improves, cultivates, and can use the product of", this principle held great appeal to individuals possessed of great wealth.{{sfn|Richardson|pp=23–24}}

Locke held that the individual had the right to follow his own religious beliefs and that the state should not impose a religion against [[Dissenter]]s, but there were limitations. No tolerance should be shown for [[Atheism|atheists]], who were seen as amoral, or to [[Catholic Church|Catholics]], who were seen as owing allegiance to the Pope over their own national government.{{sfn|Richardson|p=24}}

=== Adam Smith ===
[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Adam Smith]]]]
[[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776, was to provide most of the ideas of economics, at least until the publication of [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' in 1848.{{sfn|Mills|pp=63, 68}} Smith addressed the motivation for economic activity, the causes of prices and the distribution of wealth and the policies the state should follow to maximise wealth.{{sfn|Mills|p=64}}

Smith wrote that as long as supply, demand, prices and competition were left free of government regulation, the pursuit of material self-interest, rather than altruism, would maximise the wealth of a society&lt;ref name = smith/&gt; through profit-driven production of goods and services. An "[[invisible hand]]" directed individuals and firms to work toward the public good as an unintended consequence of efforts to maximise their own gain. This provided a moral justification for the accumulation of wealth, which had previously been viewed by some as sinful.{{sfn|Mills|p=64}}

He assumed that workers could be paid wages as low as was necessary for their survival, which was later transformed by [[David Ricardo]] and [[Thomas Robert Malthus]] into the "[[iron law of wages]]".{{sfn|Mills|p=65}} His main emphasis was on the benefit of free internal and international trade, which he thought could increase wealth through specialisation in production.{{sfn|Mills|p=66}} He also opposed restrictive trade preferences, state grants of monopolies and employers' organisations and trade unions.{{sfn|Mills|p=67}} Government should be limited to defence, public works and the administration of justice, financed by taxes based on income.{{sfn|Mills|p=68}}

Smith's economics was carried into practice in the nineteenth century with the lowering of tariffs in the 1820s, the repeal of the [[Poor Relief Act 1662|Poor Relief Act]] that had restricted the mobility of labour in 1834 and the end of the rule of the [[East India Company]] over India in 1858.{{sfn|Mills|p=69}}

=== Classical economics ===
In addition to Smith's legacy, [[Say's law]], [[Thomas Robert Malthus]]' theories of population and [[David Ricardo]]'s [[iron law of wages]] became central doctrines of [[classical economics]]. The pessimistic nature of these theories provided a basis for criticism of capitalism by its opponents and helped perpetuate the tradition of calling economics the "[[dismal science]]".{{sfn|Mills|p=76}}

[[Jean-Baptiste Say]] was a French economist who introduced Smith's economic theories into France and whose commentaries on Smith were read in both France and Britain.{{sfn|Mills|p=69}} Say challenged Smith's [[labour theory of value]], believing that prices were determined by utility and also emphasised the critical role of the entrepreneur in the economy. However, neither of those observations became accepted by British economists at the time. His most important contribution to economic thinking was Say's law, which was interpreted by classical economists that there could be no overproduction in a market and that there would always be a balance between supply and demand.{{sfn|Mills|p=70}} This general belief influenced government policies until the 1930s. Following this law, since the economic cycle was seen as self-correcting, government did not intervene during periods of economic hardship because it was seen as futile.{{sfn|Mills|p=71}}

Malthus wrote two books, ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' (published in 1798) and ''[[Principles of Political Economy (Malthus)|Principles of Political Economy]]'' (published in 1820). The second book which was a rebuttal of Say's law had little influence on contemporary economists.{{sfn|Mills|pp=71–72}} However, his first book became a major influence on classical liberalism. In that book, Malthus claimed that population growth would outstrip food production because population grew geometrically while food production grew arithmetically. As people were provided with food, they would reproduce until their growth outstripped the food supply. Nature would then provide a check to growth in the forms of vice and misery. No gains in income could prevent this and any welfare for the poor would be self-defeating. The poor were in fact responsible for their own problems which could have been avoided through self-restraint.{{sfn|Mills|p=72}}

Ricardo, who was an admirer of Smith, covered many of the same topics, but while Smith drew conclusions from broadly empirical observations he used deduction, drawing conclusions by reasoning from basic assumptions {{sfn|Mills|pp=73–74}} While Ricardo accepted Smith's [[labour theory of value]], he acknowledged that utility could influence the price of some rare items. Rents on agricultural land were seen as the production that was surplus to the subsistence required by the tenants. Wages were seen as the amount required for workers' subsistence and to maintain current population levels.{{sfn|Mills|pp=74–75}} According to his iron law of wages, wages could never rise beyond subsistence levels. Ricardo explained profits as a return on capital, which itself was the product of labour, but a conclusion many drew from his theory was that profit was a surplus appropriated by [[Capitalism|capitalists]] to which they were not entitled.{{sfn|Mills|p=75}}

=== Utilitarianism ===
[[Utilitarianism]] provided the political justification for implementation of [[economic liberalism]] by British governments, which was to dominate economic policy from the 1830s. Although utilitarianism prompted legislative and administrative reform and [[John Stuart Mill]]'s later writings on the subject foreshadowed the [[welfare state]], it was mainly used as a justification for ''laissez-faire''.{{sfn|Richardson|p=32}}

The central concept of utilitarianism, which was developed by [[Jeremy Bentham]], was that public policy should seek to provide "the greatest happiness of the greatest number". While this could be interpreted as a justification for state action to reduce poverty, it was used by classical liberals to justify inaction with the argument that the net benefit to all individuals would be higher.{{sfn|Mills|p=76}}

== Political economy ==
Classical liberals saw utility as the foundation for public policies. This broke both with conservative "[[Traditionalist conservatism|tradition]]" and [[Natural rights#John Locke|Lockean "natural rights"]], which were seen as irrational. Utility, which emphasises the happiness of individuals, became the central ethical value of all liberalism.{{sfn|Richardson|p=31}} Although utilitarianism inspired wide-ranging reforms, it became primarily a justification for ''laissez-faire'' economics. However, classical liberals rejected Smith's belief that the "invisible hand" would lead to general benefits and embraced Malthus' view that population expansion would prevent any general benefit and Ricardo's view of the inevitability of class conflict. ''Laissez-faire'' was seen as the only possible economic approach and any government intervention was seen as useless and harmful. The [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834]] was defended on "scientific or economic principles" while the authors of the [[Act for the Relief of the Poor 1601|Elizabethan Poor Law of 1601]] were seen as not having had the benefit of reading Malthus.{{sfn|Richardson|p=33}}

However, commitment to ''laissez-faire'' was not uniform and some economists advocated state support of public works and education. Classical liberals were also divided on [[free trade]] as Ricardo expressed doubt that the removal of grain tariffs advocated by [[Richard Cobden]] and the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] would have any general benefits. Most classical liberals also supported legislation to regulate the number of hours that children were allowed to work and usually did not oppose factory reform legislation.{{sfn|Richardson|p=33}}

Despite the pragmatism of classical economists, their views were expressed in dogmatic terms by such popular writers as [[Jane Marcet]] and [[Harriet Martineau]].{{sfn|Richardson|p=33}} The strongest defender of ''laissez-faire'' was ''The Economist'' founded by [[James Wilson (UK politician)|James Wilson]] in 1843. ''The Economist'' criticised Ricardo for his lack of support for free trade and expressed hostility to welfare, believing that the lower orders were responsible for their economic circumstances. ''The Economist'' took the position that regulation of factory hours was harmful to workers and also strongly opposed state support for education, health, the provision of water and granting of patents and copyrights.{{sfn|Richardson|p=34}}

''The Economist'' also campaigned against the Corn Laws that protected landlords in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland against competition from less expensive foreign imports of cereal products. A rigid belief in ''laissez-faire'' guided the government response in 1846–1849 to the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] in Ireland, during which an estimated 1.5 million people died. The minister responsible for economic and financial affairs, [[Charles Wood, 1st Viscount Halifax|Charles Wood]], expected that private enterprise and free trade, rather than government intervention, would alleviate the famine.{{sfn|Richardson|p=34}} The [[Corn Laws]] were finally repealed in 1846 by the removal of tariffs on grain which kept the price of bread artificially high,&lt;ref&gt;George Miller. ''On Fairness and Efficiency''. The Policy Press, 2000. {{ISBN|978-1-86134-221-8}} p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt; but it came too late to stop the Irish famine, partly because it was done in stages over three years.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Kinealy. ''A Death-Dealing Famine:The Great Hunger in Ireland''. Pluto Press, 1997. {{ISBN|978-0-7453-1074-9}}. p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Lee. ''Aspects of British Political History, 1815–1914''. Routledge, 1994. {{ISBN|978-0-415-09006-3}}. p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Free trade and world peace ==
Several liberals, including Smith and Cobden, argued that the free exchange of goods between nations could lead to [[world peace]]. Erik Gartzke states: "Scholars like Montesquieu, Adam Smith, Richard Cobden, [[Norman Angell]], and [[Richard Rosecrance]] have long speculated that [[free market]]s have the potential to free states from the looming prospect of recurrent warfare".&lt;ref&gt;Erik Gartzke, "Economic Freedom and Peace," in ''Economic Freedom of the World: 2005 Annual Report'' (Vancouver: Fraser Institute, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; American political scientists John R. Oneal and Bruce M. Russett, well known for their work on the democratic peace theory, state:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=J. R.|first2=B. M.|title=The Classical Liberals Were Right: Democracy, Interdependence, and Conflict, 1950–1985|journal=International Studies Quarterly|volume=41|issue=2|pages=267–294|year=1997|last1=Oneal|doi=10.1111/1468-2478.00042|last2=Russet}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|The classical liberals advocated policies to increase liberty and prosperity. They sought to empower the commercial class politically and to abolish royal charters, monopolies, and the protectionist policies of mercantilism so as to encourage entrepreneurship and increase productive efficiency. They also expected democracy and laissez-faire economics to diminish the frequency of war.}}

In ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', Smith argued that as societies progressed from hunter gatherers to industrial societies the spoils of war would rise, but that the costs of war would rise further and thus making war difficult and costly for industrialised nations:&lt;ref&gt;Michael Doyle, ''Ways of War and Peace: Realism, Liberalism, and Socialism'' (New York: Norton, 1997), p. 237 ({{ISBN|0-393-96947-9}}).&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|[T]he honours, the fame, the emoluments of war, belong not to [the middle and industrial classes]; the battle-plain is the harvest field of the aristocracy, watered with the blood of the people...Whilst our trade rested upon our foreign dependencies, as was the case in the middle of the last century...force and violence, were necessary to command our customers for our manufacturers...But war, although the greatest of consumers, not only produces nothing in return, but, by abstracting labour from productive employment and interrupting the course of trade, it impedes, in a variety of indirect ways, the creation of wealth; and, should hostilities be continued for a series of years, each successive war-loan will be felt in our commercial and manufacturing districts with an augmented pressure|[[Richard Cobden]]&lt;ref&gt;Edward P. Stringham, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1676244 "Commerce, Markets, and Peace: Richard Cobden's Enduring Lessons"], ''Independent Review'' 9, no. 1 (2004): 105, 110, 115.&lt;/ref&gt;|source=}}
{{quote|[B]y virtue of their mutual interest does nature unite people against violence and war, for the concept of cosmopolitan right does not protect them from it. The spirit of trade cannot coexist with war, and sooner or later this spirit dominates every people. For among all those powers (or means) that belong to a nation, financial power may be the most reliable in forcing nations to pursue the noble cause of peace (though not from moral motives); and wherever in the world war threatens to break out, they will try to head it off through mediation, just as if they were permanently leagued for this purpose.|[[Immanuel Kant]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Kant]], ''The Perpetual Peace''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cobden believed that military expenditures worsened the welfare of the state and benefited a small, but concentrated elite minority, summing up British [[imperialism]], which he believed was the result of the economic restrictions of mercantilist policies. To Cobden and many classical liberals, those who advocated peace must also advocate free markets. The belief that free trade would promote peace was widely shared by English liberals of the 19th and early 20th century, leading the economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883–1946), who was a classical liberal in his early life, to say that this was a doctrine on which he was "brought up" and which he held unquestioned only until the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Markwell]], [http://global.oup.com/academic/product/john-maynard-keynes-and-international-relations-9780198292364;jsessionid=4B0FEAE67C6CC2944F0147AFD5045F62?cc=au&amp;lang=en&amp; ''John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace''], Oxford University Press, 2006, ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In his review of a book on Keynes, Michael S. Lawlor argues that it may be in large part due to Keynes' contributions in economics and politics, as in the implementation of the [[Marshall Plan]] and the way economies have been managed since his work, "that we have the luxury of not facing his unpalatable choice between free trade and full employment".&lt;ref&gt;[https://eh.net/book_reviews/john-maynard-keynes-and-international-relations-economic-paths-to-war-and-peace/ John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace]  Donald Markwell (2006), reviewed by M S Lawlor (February 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; A related manifestation of this idea was the argument of [[Norman Angell]] (1872–1967), most famously before World War I in ''[[The Great Illusion]]'' (1909), that the interdependence of the economies of the major powers was now so great that war between them was futile and irrational; and therefore unlikely.

'''Collectivism''' is a cultural value that is characterized by emphasis on cohesiveness among individuals and prioritization of the group over self. Individuals or groups that subscribe to a collectivistic worldview tend to find common values and goals as particularly salient&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=S.

== Origins and historical perspectives ==
The German sociologist Tönnies described an early model of collectivism and individualism using the terms ''Gemeinschaft'' (community) and ''Gesellschaft'' (society).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Community and association|last=Tönnies|first=F.|publisher=Harper Torchbooks|year=1957 |orig-year=1887|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gemeinschaft'' relationships, in which communalism is prioritized, were thought to be characteristic of small, rural village communities. An anthropologist, Redfield (1941) echoed this notion in work contrasting folk society with urban society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The folk culture of Yucatán|last=Redfield|first=R.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1941|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Weber]] (1930) contrasted collectivism and individualism through the lens of religion, believing that Protestants were more individualistic and self-reliant compared to Catholics, who endorsed hierarchical, interdependent relationships among people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism|last=Weber|first=M.|publisher=Routledge|year=1930|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geert Hofstede|Hofstede]] (1980) was highly influential in ushering in an era of cross-cultural research making comparisons along the dimension of collectivism versus individualism. Hofstede conceptualized collectivism and individualism as part of a single continuum, with each cultural construct representing an opposite pole. The author characterized individuals that endorsed a high degree of collectivism as being embedded in their social contexts and prioritizing communal goals over individual goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Culture's consequences|last=Hofstede|first=G.|publisher=Sage|year=1980|isbn=|location=Beverly Hills|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion that collectivism-individualism is unidimensional has been challenged by contemporary theorists.

=== Marxism–Leninism ===
{{Main|New Soviet man}}
Collectivism was an important part of [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] ideology in the [[Soviet Union]], where it played a key part in forming the New Soviet man, willingly sacrificing his or her life for the good of the collective. Terms such as "collective" and "the masses" were frequently used in the official language and praised in [[agitprop]] literature, for example by [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] (''Who needs a "1"'') and [[Bertolt Brecht]] ([[The Decision (play)|The Decision]], [[Man Equals Man]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia|last=Overy|first=Richard|publisher=|year=|isbn=0-393-02030-4|location=|pages=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horn|first=Eva|date=2006|title=Actors/Agents: Bertolt Brecht and the Politics of Secrecy|url=|journal=Grey Room|volume=24|pages=38–55|doi=10.1162/grey.2006.1.24.38|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology and measurement ==
The construct of collectivism is represented in empirical literature under several different names. Most commonly, the term interdependent self-construal is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Markus, H. R., &amp; Kitayama, S.|first=|date=1991|title=Culture and the self: Implications for cognition, emotion, and motivation|url=|journal=Psychological Review|volume=98|pages=224–253|via=|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.98.2.224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other phrases used to describe the concept of collectivism-individualism include allocentrism-idiocentrism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Allocentric vs. idiocentric social behavior: A major cultural difference between Hispanics and mainstream (Technical reports)|last=Triandis|first=H. C.|publisher=Department of Psychology, University of Illinois|year=1983|isbn=|location=Champaign|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; collective-private self,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trafimow, D., [[Triandis, H. C.]], &amp; Goto, S. G.|first=|date=1991|title=Some tests of the distinction between the private self and the collective self|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=60|pages=649–665|via=|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.60.5.649}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as subtypes of collectivism-individualism (meaning, vertical and horizontal subtypes).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Triandis, H. C., Bhawuk, D. P. S., &amp; Gelfand, M. J.|first=|date=1995|title=Horizontal and vertical dimensions of individualism and collectivism: A theoretical and measurement refinement|url=|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|volume=29|pages=240–275|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inconsistent terminology is thought to account for some of the difficulty in effectively synthesizing the empirical literature on collectivism.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taras et al.|first=|date=2014|title=Opposite Ends of the Same Stick? Multi-Method Test of the Dimensionality of Individualism and Collectivism|url=|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|volume=45 | issue = 2 |pages=213–245|via=|doi=10.1177/0022022113509132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, collectivism is measured via self-report questionnaire. Meta-analytic findings suggest that there are six instruments that have been used to measure collectivism (and the related construct of individualism) in a manner that best reflects current theoretical thinking.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* Gudykunst and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gudykunst, W. G., Matsumoto, Y., Ting-Toomey, S., &amp; Nishida, T.|first=|date=1996|title=The influence of cultural individualism-collectivism, self-construals, and individual values on communication styles across cultures|url=|journal=Human Communication Research|volume=22|pages=510–543|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1996.tb00377.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed a 28-item measurement tool that rates items on a scale from 1-7. Interdependent and independent self-construal subscales are produced. Sample items from the interdependent subscale include, "I maintain harmony in the groups of which I am a member" and "I will sacrifice my self-interest for the benefit of the group."
* Kim and Leung developed the Revised Self-Construal Scale,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A revised Self-Construal Scale|last=Kim, M. S., &amp; Leung, K.|first=|publisher=University of Hawaii at Manoa|year=1997|isbn=|location=Honolulu|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a 28-item measure that produces Interdependent and independent self-construal subscales. Sample items from the interdependent subscale include, "I feel uncomfortable disagreeing with my group" and "My relationships with others in my group are more important than my personal accomplishments."
* Oyserman&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; developed a measure containing 18 items rated on a five-point Likert scale which produces collectivism and individualism subscales. An example item from the collectivism subscale include "In order to really understand who I am, you must see me with members of my group."
* Singelis developed the 24-item Self-Construal Scale,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; which rates items on a scale from 1-7. Items from the interdependent subscale include, "My happiness depends on the happiness of those around me" and "If my brother or sister fails, I feel responsible."
* Takata&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Takata, T.|first=|date=1993|title=Social comparison and formation of self-concept in adolescent: Some findings about Japanese college students|url=|journal=Japanese Journal of Educational Psychology|volume=41|pages=339–348|via=|doi=10.5926/jjep1953.41.3_339}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed a 20-item measure that was originally published in Japanese. It contains a collectivism and an individualism subscale. 
* Triandis&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; developed a 12-item measure that produces collectivism and individualism subscales. The person completing the question is asked "Are you a person who is likely to..." and then asked to rate a number of scenarios. Examples of scenarios that if endorsed would indicate greater adherence to collectivism include "Stay with friends, rather than at a hotel, when you go to another town (even if you have plenty of money)."

== Theoretical models ==
In one critical model of collectivism, Markus and Kitayama&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Markus, H. R., &amp; Kitayma, S.|first=|date=2010|title=Cultures and selves: A cycle of mutual constitution|url=|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|volume=5 | issue = 4 |pages=420–430|via=|doi=10.1177/1745691610375557}}&lt;/ref&gt; describe the interdependent (i.e., collectivistic) self as fundamentally connected to the social context. As such, one's sense of self depends on and is defined in part by those around them and is primarily manifested in public, overt behavior. As such, the organization of the self is guided by using others as a reference. That is, an interdependent individual uses the unexpressed thoughts, feelings, and beliefs of another person with whom they have a relationship with, as well as the other person's behaviors, to make decisions about their own internal attributes and actions.

Markus and Kitayama also contributed to the literature by challenging Hofstede's unidimensional model of collectivism-individualism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The authors conceptualized these two constructs bidimensionally, such that both collectivism and individualism can be endorsed independently and potentially to the same degree. This notion has been echoed by other prominent theorists in the field.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singelis|first=T.|date=1994|title=The measurement of independent and interdependent self-construal|url=|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=20|pages=580–591|via=|doi=10.1177/0146167294205014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=INDCOL (Unpublished research scale on individualism and collectivism)|last=Triandis|first=H. C.|publisher=University of Illinois|year=1994|isbn=|location=Champaign|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers have expanded the collectivism-individualism framework to include a more comprehensive view. Specifically, Triandis and colleagues introduced a theoretical model in which incorporates the notion of relational contexts.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singelis, T. M., Triandis, H. C., Bhawuk, D. P. S., &amp; Gelfand, M. J.|first=|date=1995|title=Horizontal and vertical dimensions of individualism and collectivism: A theoretical and measurement refinement|url=|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|volume=29|pages=240–275|via=|doi=10.1177/106939719502900302}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors argues that the domains of collectivism and individualism can be further described by horizontal and vertical relationships. Horizontal relationships are believed to be status-equal whereas vertical relationships are characterized as hierarchical and status-unequal. As such, horizontal collectivism is manifested as an orientation in which group harmony is highly valued and in-group members are perceived to experience equal standing. Vertical collectivism involves the prioritization of group goals over individual goals, implying a hierarchical positioning of the self in relation to the overarching in-group. The horizontal-vertical individualism-collectivism model has received empirical support and has been used to explore patterns within cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Komarraju, M., &amp; Cokley, K. O.|first=|date=2008|title=Horizontal and vertical dimensions of individualism–collectivism: A comparison of African Americans and European Americans|url=|journal=Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology|volume=14|pages=336–343|via=|doi=10.1037/1099-9809.14.4.336}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lalwani, A.

Originated by W. E. B. DuBois,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The souls of Black folk|last=DuBois|first=W. E. B.|publisher=Signet|year=1969 |orig-year=1903 |isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; some researchers have adopted a historical perspective on the emergence of collectivism among some cultural groups. DuBois and others argued that oppressed minority groups contend with internal division, meaning that the development of self-identity for individuals from these groups involves the integration of one's own perceptions of their group as well as typically negative, societal views of their group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaines, Jr., S.

Some organizational research has found different variations of collectivism. These include institutional collectivism and in-group collectivism. Institutional collectivism is the idea that a work environment creates a sense of collectivist nature due to similar statuses and similar rewards, such as earning the same salary. In-group collectivism is the idea that an individual's chosen group of people, such as family or friend groups, create a sense of collectivist nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/culture-leadership-and-organizations/book226013|title=Culture, Leadership, and Organizations|last1=House|first1=Robert J.|last2=Hanges|first2=Paul J.|last3=Javidan|first3=Mansour|last4=Dorfman|first4=Peter W.|last5=Gupta|first5=Vipin|date=2004|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In-group collectivism can be referred to as family collectivism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brewer|first1=Paul|last2=Venaik|first2=Sunil|date=April 2011|title=Individualism-Collectivism in Hofstede and GLOBE|url=https://www.jstor.org.db19.linccweb.org/stable/29789431|journal=Palgrave Macmillan Journals|volume=42|pages=436–445|doi=10.1057/jibs.2010.62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cognition ==
A number of classic studies have demonstrated that there is a relationship between collectivism and cognition. These studies support the notion that people from collectivistic cultures tend to demonstrate a [[holistic]] cognitive style, which is reflected in processes such as memory, visual perception, attributional style, and categorization schemas. This effect has been replicated extensively by independent research groups, supporting its robustness.

*Memory: Masuda and Nisbett&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Masuda, T., &amp; Nisbett, R. E.|first=|date=2001|title=Attending holistically versus analytically: comparing the context sensitivity of Japanese and Americans|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=81 | issue = 5 |pages=922–934|via=|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.81.5.922}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that Japanese students, who were presumed to hold greater collectivistic views, demonstrated greater attention to the context in which a visual stimulus was embedded and resultantly, exhibited more holistic memory compared to North American students.
*Visual perception: During a “rod and frame” test, in which a person is asked to determine the angle of a rod in relation to a frame, [[East Asian cultural sphere|East Asian]] participants were more likely be “field dependent” than Americans, meaning that they were more biased by the orientation of the frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ji, L. J., Peng, K., &amp; Nisbett, R. E.|first=|date=2000|title=Culture, control, and perception of relationships in the environment|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=78|pages=943–955|via=|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.78.5.943}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kitayama, S., Duffy, S., Kawamura, T., &amp; Larsen, J.

*Attributional style: Participants were shown a picture of a group of fish and asked to rate the reasons they believed one fish was swimming in front of the group. Chinese participants were more likely to endorse external forces (for example, “the fish is being chased”) compared to Americans, who endorsed more internal forces (for example, “the fish is a leader”).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morris, M., &amp; Peng, K.|first=|date=1994|title=Culture and cause: American and Chinese attributions for social and physical events|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=67 | issue = 6 |pages=949–971|via=|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.67.6.949}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Categorization schemas: Collectivism has been shown to influence how people sort and group. Individuals who are more collectivistic tend to think about the relationship of objects and sort on that basis rather than by shared properties.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chiu|first=L. H.|date=1972|title=A cross-cultural comparison of cognitive styles in Chinese and American children|url=|journal=International Journal of Psychology|volume=7 | issue = 4 |pages=235–242|via=|doi=10.1080/00207597208246604}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ji, L.

When probed about the reasons for this grouping, it was explained that cows eat grass.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Development of self-concept ==
An individual's self-concept can be fundamentally shaped by cultural values. Such processes typically begin in childhood and adolescence and parents are often one of the first critical inputs that shape a child's sense of self-concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=New Perspectives on Human Development|last=Chiao|first=J. Y.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2017|isbn=|editor1=N. Budwig|editor2=E. Turiel|editor3=P. D. Zelazo|location=|pages=|chapter=Cultural neuroscience of the developing brain in adolescence}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents with more collectivistic world views have been shown to speak and interact with their children in a manner that conveys the core tenets of collectivism, such as emphasis on the relationships between objects and interpersonal connections. As such, youth who are parented in this manner tend to develop a sense of self that is defined in relation to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang, Q., Shao, Y., &amp; Li, Y. J.|first=|date=2010|title="My way or mom's way?" The bilingual and bicultural self in Hong Kong Chinese children and adolescents|url=|journal=Child Development|volume=81 | issue = 2 |pages=555–567|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2009.01415.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sense of self also has been found to be reflected in patterns of structural and functional connectivity in the brain. For example, generally the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) is more active when adults think about themselves compared to when they think about someone else. However, for adults who endorse collectivism, the MPFC actually shows greater response when they think about themselves in the context of their close relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wagner, D. D., Haxby, J. V., &amp; Heatherton, T. F.|first=|date=2012|title=The representation of self and person knowledge in the medial prefrontal cortex|url=|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science|volume=3 | issue = 4 |pages=451–470|via=|doi=10.1002/wcs.1183|pmc=3375705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Macro-level effects ==
Cultural views are believed to have a reciprocal relationship with macro-level processes such as economics, social change, and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Culture Shift in Advanced Industrial Society|last=Inglehart|first=R.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1990|isbn=|location=Princeton|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modernization and Postmodernization: Cultural, Economic, and Political Change in 43 Societies|last=Inglehart|first=R.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=Princeton|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[collectivism-individualism dimension]] of culture influences [[economic development]]: collectivistic culture theoretically promotes growth. For instance, the influence of the collectivist dimension of culture can be observed among the [[European Union]] economies: countries which societies are less individualistic record faster economic development, at the expense of individual liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maziarz|first=Mariusz|date=2015|title=Collectivism and economic development - a causal analysis|url=http://www.socioeconomica.info/jspui/bitstream/11171/180/1/2.%20Maziarz.pdf|journal=Socioeconomica|volume=4 | issue = 8 |pages=277–290|via=|doi=10.12803/sjseco.48133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Societal changes in China exemplifies this well. Beginning in the early 1980s, China experienced dramatic expansion of economic and social structures, resulting in greater income inequality between families, less involvement of the government in social welfare programs, and increased competition for employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transforming China: Economic reform and its political implications|last=Zhang|first=W. W.|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corresponding with these changes was a shift in ideology among Chinese citizens, especially among those who were younger, away from collectivism (the prevailing cultural ideology) toward individualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cai, X., &amp; Wu, P.|first=|date=1999|title=A study of the modernity of social concept of younger students in China|url=http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-XLKX199902013.htm|journal=Psychological Science |location=China|volume=22|pages=148–152|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=M.|date=1999|title=A comparative study of the value outlook of Chinese adolescent students|url=|journal=Journal of Southwest China Normal University (Philosophy and Social Sciences)|volume=25|pages=83–88|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; China also saw this shift reflected in educational policies, such that teachers were encouraged to promote the development of their students’ individual opinions and self-efficacy, which prior to the aforementioned economic changes, was not emphasized in Chinese culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xu, X., &amp; Peng, L.|first=|date=2001|title=Reflection on parents' educational beliefs in the new century|url=|journal=Theory and Practice of Education|volume=21|pages=62–63|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yu, R.|first=|date=2002|title=On the reform of elementary school education in China|url=|journal=Educational Exploration|volume=129|pages=56–57|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to study the association of collectivism and political views and behaviors has largely occurred at the aggregate national level. However, more isolated political movements have also adopted a collectivistic framework. For example, [[Collectivist anarchism]] (also known as anarcho-collectivism) is a revolutionary&lt;ref name="Patsouras, Louis 2005. p. 54"&gt;Patsouras, Louis. 2005. ''Marx in Context''. iUniverse. p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; [[anarchist]] doctrine that advocates the abolition of both the [[State (polity)|state]] and [[private property|private ownership]] of the [[means of production]]. It instead envisions the means of production being owned collectively and controlled and managed by the producers themselves.&lt;ref name="Patsouras, Louis 2005. p. 54" /&gt;

The idea of the '''Common Peace''' (Κοινὴ Εἰρήνη, ''Koinē Eirēnē'') was one of the most influential concepts of 4th century BC Greek political thought, along with the idea of [[Panhellenism]]. The term described both the concept of a desirable, permanent peace between the Greek city-states ([[polis|poleis]]) and a sort of [[peace treaty]] which fulfilled the three fundamental criteria of this concept: it had to include all the Greek city-states, it had to recognise the [[autonomy]] and equality of all city states without regard for their military power, and it had to be intended to remain in force permanently.

The advocates of the Common Peace saw it as a way to end the endemic warfare which engulfed the Greek ''poleis'' from the outbreak of the [[Peloponnesian War]] in 431 BC. From the [[Peace of Antalcidas|King's Peace]] of 387/6 BC down to the foundation of the [[League of Corinth]] in 338 BC, the idea of the Common Peace influenced all peace treaties between Greek ''poleis''. In the end, however, it turned out that only a strong [[hegemony|hegemonic power]] could maintain a comprehensive peace for long. In modern times, the concept has been revived and in the 20th century, the principle of the Common Peace was a foundation stone of international organisations like the [[League of Nations]] and the [[United Nations]].

== The idea of the Common Peace ==
The idea of the Common Peace developed out of older ideas which had gradually taken form in the political interactions of the 5th century BC in Greece. Its temporary enforcement however owes less to the realisation of the need for a permanent peace, than to the fact that it seemed to serve the interests of several successive hegemonic powers. The history of the Common Peace is therefore not only part of the [[history of ideas]], but also of the diplomatic history of Greece in the decades between the Peloponnesian War and the arrival of king [[Philip II of Macedon]] and [[Alexander the Great]].

=== Development of the term===
[[File:Helmed Hoplite Sparta.JPG|thumb|Spartan [[hoplite]]]]
The [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''Eirene'', which originally only signified a 'state of peace', developed the related meaning of 'peace agreement' at the beginning of the 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Diekhoff, ''Friedensreden'', p. 379–391&lt;/ref&gt; This was a consequence of a change in attitudes to war and peace more generally. Already in the 5th century BC, wars between Greek ''poleis'' were ended with treaties, which were known as ''spondai'' (σπονδαί), ''synthekai'' (συνθήκαι) or ''dialyseis polemou'' (διάλυσεις πολέμου). All these terms ultimately only indicated a truce or temporary break from war.&lt;ref&gt;Ryder, ''Koine Eirene'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; But as a result of the unending warfare from the middle of that century, the idea gradually developed that a state of peace rather than war should be the normal state of international affairs. This is reflected in the increased prominence of the term ''Eirene'' and in its use as a term for peace treaties.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Diodorus]], XV.5.1 and XV.38.1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

The term 'Common Peace' was first used in 391 BC, in reference to the failed negotiations between [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]] to end the [[Corinthian War]]. The Athenian politician [[Andocides]] advised his fellow citizens in a speech for the acceptance of a settlement which he called ''koine eirene''.&lt;ref&gt;Andokides, ''Orations'' III.17&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly the term had already come into general parlance before this, but this speech is the first attestation. The first treaty in which the terms ''eirene'' and ''koine eirene'' were actually used was the 'King's Peace' imposed by the Spartans and [[Achaemenids|Persians]] in 387/6 BC. The phrase ''koine eirene'' only appears in an official document for the first time in the peace treaty made after the [[Battle of Mantinea (362 BC)|Battle of Mantinea]] in 362 BC.

Generally, the term ''koine eirene'' is only sparsely attested in contemporary sources. Authors like [[Isocrates]], [[Demosthenes]] and [[Xenophon]] do not use it at all. But they do refer to its essential characteristics for each of the peace treaties which the 1st century BC historian [[Diodorus]] consistently refers to as a ''koine eirene''. The fact that Diodorus based his account of the period from 386 to 361 on the contemporary author [[Ephorus]] makes it very likely that the term was in general use at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Ryder, ''Koine Eirene'', S. 11–13&lt;/ref&gt; It also appears in mid-4th century BC inscription from [[Argos]], known as the [[Reply to the Satraps]], whose exact date and circumstances are unclear.&lt;ref&gt;''IG'' IV 556&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Characteristics ===
In the speech of Andocides and the provisions of the King's Peace&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, ''Hellenica'' V.1.31&lt;/ref&gt; two characteristics are revealed which were new for peace treaties at this time. One of these was that all Greek ''poleis'' (with a few exceptions) were to be autonomous. The other was that each of these draft treaties were sent to all ''poleis''. Peace is therefore no longer presented as a bilateral agreement between two formerly hostile ''poleis'' or leagues, but as a multilateral treaty, which would also encompass all the parties that were not involved in the conflict, as far as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Jehne, ''Koine Eirene'', pp. 39 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

A third characteristic is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the absence of set time limit. In the 5th century, it was the norm for peace treaties to have a specified period of validity. The [[Thirty Years' Peace]] of 446/5 BC between Athens and Sparta was named for the period of time it was expected to last. The [[Peace of Nicias]] of 421 BC was meant to last for fifty years, while treaties with a set period of one hundred years were practically intended to last forever. This derives from the idea that peace was not being made between the states as such, but rather between their populations, and thus the longest possible period of time that a treaty could last was the lifetime of a single generation - which could only make agreements for itself, not its descendants. By contrast, a ''koine eirene'' was in principle designed to endure forever.&lt;ref&gt;Jehne, ''Koine Eirene'', p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; Although this was not actually explicitly stated in the treaties, it is clear from the internal logic of the autonomy clauses, since an independence with chronological limits would not be independence.

==== Multilaterality ====
The bilateral peace treaties of the 5th century BC between Athens and Sparta largely ignored the interests of other parties - including their own allies, who were not even consulted. Even the treaty of 404 BC, which ended the Peloponnesian War and was in practice a diktat from the Spartan side, was formally a treaty between Sparta and Athens.&lt;ref&gt;Baltrusch: ''Symmachie'', pp. 23 f.&lt;/ref&gt; It did not contain any terms regarding the allies of Athens in the [[Delian League]] and was actually concluded despite the opposition of the Spartans' allies. The treaty therefore entirely reflects the conditions and ideas of the 5th century, in which there were only two major hegemonic powers in Greece, to which all other ''poleis'' were subordinated.
[[File:Pericles Pio-Clementino Inv269 n3.jpg|thumb|Bust of Pericles]]
The idea of a multilateral panhellenic agreement was not actually new, however. After the defeat of [[Persian Wars|Xerxes' invasion]], a general peace had been concluded in 481, although it was temporary. In 450 BC, [[Pericles]] is reported to have desired to convene a general peace conference in Athens. It is reported that the refusal of the Spartans to participate on account of their fear of Athenian hegemony meant that it never actually took place. Apart from some multilateral treaties between individual ''poleis'' in [[Sicily]] and [[Ionia]], the religious association of the [[Amphictyonic League]] was the only multilateral agreement of ancient Greece which was enduring and significant. The Amphictyonic oath forswore the destruction of member states in war or the removal of their water. ''Poleis'' that broke this oath would themselves be threatened with destruction. This might be a forerunner of the ''koine eirene''.&lt;ref&gt;Ryder, ''Koine eirene'', pp. 3–6 &amp; Ehrenberg, ''Staat'', p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

That it became ever more common to make peace treaties on the basis of a ''koine eirene'' after 387 BC had a practical aspect. The successive hegemonial powers were not individual ''poleis'', but several opposing ''poleis'' or leagues of roughly equal strength. With them, peace was only possible if all agreed together. For the general acceptance of such a multilateral agreement, the autonomy clause was the first requirement.

==== Autonomy clause ====
The Greek term ''autonomia'' signified the right and ability of the citizens of a ''polis'' to use their own legal system or ''nomos'' (νόμος) and to be free from all submission to other ''poleis''.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenberg, ''Staat'', p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the ''polis'' had become the characteristic form of the state in Greece, there was an unwritten law in their relationships with one another that each of them - even the most insignificant ones - should be autonomous. The only exceptions to this were the small cities of [[Attica]] and [[Laconia]], which hadlong been completely integrated into the Athenian and Spartan ''poleis''. It was a source of substantial tension in the 4th century, when the [[Thebans]] attempted to incorporate the cities of [[Boeotia]] into a single ''polis'' in the same way.&lt;ref&gt;Ryder, ''Koine eirene'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Persian Wars, however, the willingness to form leagues, called ''koina'' or ''symmachiai'' under the leadership of a hegemonic power or ''hegemon'' increased. These were entered into voluntarily, so that the principle of autonomy was theoretically not infringed. But as the Persian threat declined in significance, it seemed that the Athenians wished to convert the Delian League which they controlled into a naval empire which they ruled. Thus the Athenians violated the foundations of ''autonomia'': the freedom of ''poleis'' to live under their own political systems, to be free of [[garrison]]s, [[cleruchy|cleruchies]], external legal jurisdiction, and tribute. The introduction of ''phoros'' (φόρος, i.e. contributions for military purposes), the relocation of league's treasury from [[Delos]] to Athens and the forced introduction of [[Athenian democracy|democratic]] constitutions based on the Athenian model in some members of the league all seemed to violate the principle of ''autonomia''.

The Spartans, whose [[Peloponnesian League]] was comparatively loosely organised, began to use the demand for ''autonomia'' as a diplomatic means to weaken the Athenian league from the middle of the 5th century BC. The took up the complaints of the Athenians' allies as their own: during and after the Peloponnesian War, the Spartans presented themselves as the protectors of the freedom of all Greek states. Thus the autonomy clause was not only a key component of every Common Peace because smaller ''poleis'' saw it as a way to ensure their independence,&lt;ref&gt;Pistorius, ''Hegemoniestreben'', p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; but also and more importantly because larger powers could use it to advance their own interests.

==Development of the Common Peace==
Whether a peace agreement was a Common Peace or not is uncertain for some treaties. In the following, a wide definition is used in order to make the development of the idea of the Common Peace clear. Criteria for inclusion are the autonomy clause and the permission for all Greek poleis to join, regardless of whether that option was actually taken up.

=== Failed peace of 391 BC===
In 392/1 BC, in the course of the [[Corinthian War]], Sparta submitted an initial peace offer to the [[Achaemenid|Persian]] [[satrap]] of [[Lydia]], [[Tiribazus]]. The Spartans were under pressure to extract themselves from their hopeless war in [[Asia Minor]] and simultaneously reassert their military supremacy in mainland Greece. For this it was necessary, firstly, to concede Persian control of the Greek cities of [[Ionia]], and, secondly, to end the Persians' alliances with the Greek opponents of Sparta, especially Athens. Simultaneously, the [[Great King]] needed to be convinced that no new Greek power would form in the [[Aegean civilizations|Aegean]] which might challenge Persian control of the Ionian cities.

The agreement that would solve all these problems was that Sparta and Persia would guarantee the autonomy of all Greek states (exceptthose in Asia Minor). The Spartans would then have been able to point to the protection of a generally recognised principle as the outcome of the war. At the same time, this would allow the Spartans to split the Greek world into a number of weak individual states, ensuring the Spartan hegemony and satisfying the Persian desire for security. The Greek city-states naturally rejected the treaty out of hand. The Persian king [[Artaxerxes II]] was also inclined to reject it. He recalled Tiribazus and replaced him with a new satrap, [[Struthas]], who strengthened the Persian alliance with Athens.

A few months later, the Spartans attempted to come to terms with their Greek enemies in a conference in their own city. Once more, they made the autonomy principle the basis of any agreement, this time with concessions to Athens and Thebes. The Athenians would have retained the islands of [[Lemnos]], [[Imbros]], and [[Skyros]], while the Thebans' possession of [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenus]] would have been recognised.

It was during these negotiations that the formula of a 'Common Peace' for all Greeks was first used. The Athenian orator Andocides used it in a speech, in which he vainly urged his countrymen to accept the Spartan offer:
{{quote|Consider this too, Athenians: right now you are negotiating peace and freedom common to all the Greeks and causing everyone to share control over everything.|Andokides, ''On the Peace'' 17}}
Andokides makes a distinction between treaties and a real peace. He invoked the panhellenic ideal, while idealising the project of the common peace. As he did this, however, he omitted the fact that the Ionian cities for whose freedom Athens had gone to war with Persia some hundred years earlier, would be abandoned as a result of this treaty. In the end the Athenians rejected the treaty because of this (and because after their alliance with [[Struthas]], they believed they were in a stronger position).

===Peace of Antalcidas===
[[File:Xenophon.jpg|thumb|150px|Xenophon]]
{{main|Peace of Antalcidas}}
The successes of the Athenian fleet in 390 BC, however, led to a reevaluation at the Persian court, which did not want the Athenians to get too strong. Struthas was replaced two years later by his predecessor [[Tiribazus]], who negotiated a peace with the Spartan envoy [[Antalcidas]]. The resulting agreement, known as the 'Peace of Antalcidas' or the 'King's Peace' essentially accepted the Spartan proposals of 392/1. The most important terms were the inclusion of all Greek states and the guarantee of their freedom and autonomy. Only the Ionian cities, [[Cyprus]] and [[Clazomenae]], which remained under Persian control, and the three aforementioned islands under Athenian rule were excluded. The Athenians had to surrender all other possessions and the dissolution of all leagues was the unavoidable consequence of the treaty. The key passage comes from [[Xenophon]], whose [[Hellenica]] is the most important source for this period:
{{quote|Artaxerxes the king thinks it is just that the cities in Asia be his as well as the islands of Clazomenae and Cyprus, but that all the Greek cities great and small should be allowed to be autonomous, except for Lemnos, Imbros, and Scyros, which should be Athenian, as of old. And if anybody does not accept this peace, I will go to war against them, with those who want these things, on foot and by sea, with ships and with money.|Xenophon, ''Hellenica'' 5.1.31}}

Most scholars see the Peace of Antalcidas as the first example of a common peace. [[Hermann Bengtson]] viewed the common peace as a side-effect of the treaty, which was originally only a decree of the Great King (from which it derives its name).&lt;ref&gt;Bengtson, ''Griechische Geschichte.'' p.&amp;nbsp;271.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spartans were appointed as guardians (''prostatai'') of the peace, with the power to interpret and enforce its provisions. All the Greek states swore to abide by this decree at Sparta - in light of the Great King's threat to go to war with anyone who refused to do so. This fact and the aforementioned exceptions show that a common peace was not fully achieved. Nor would one be achieved subsequently. While the autonomy and the inclusion of all cities was guaranteed, they were entirely dependent on the interests of those same powers which initiated and guaranteed the common peace.

Artaxerxes did not intend to provide Greece with an enduring peace, but to divide and weaken it politically. The Spartans displayed a desire for peace, but also a wish to ensure their own hegemony. The Spartan interpretation of autonomy required the dissolution of all leagues except their own [[Peloponnesian League]],&lt;ref&gt;On the problem of the definition of autonomy, see Pistorius, ''Hegemoniestreben'', pp. 165–167&lt;/ref&gt; since this was not unified or centrally organised, but instead was a system of bilateral treaties which the Spartans had made with each individual member. In the Spartan view, bilateral treaties between individual states were not included in the ban on leagues controlled by a hegemonic power, although in practice this is exactly what the Peloponnesian League was.

Therefore, the Spartans remained the strongest military power in Greece. Under the pretext of protecting the autonomy principle, they maintained a hegemonic position over the next few years which greatly abused the autonomy of other states, such as the [[Chalcidian League]] and the city of [[Mantinea]].

=== The Common Peace of 375 BC ===
In 382 BC, the Spartans seized the [[Cadmea]], the citadel of Thebes, whose increasing strength was a thorn in their side. This act costed them the rest of their credit as protectors of autonomy and led to the [[Boeotian War]] with the Thebans and their Athenian allies. In the course of this, in spring 377 BC, the [[Second Athenian Confederacy]] was established. This league represented a violation of the clauses of the Peace of Antalcidas. But it is possible that a majority of the Aegean islands and coastal states now saw Athens as a better advocate of the principle of autonomy, as a result of their support for the Thebans. The league treaty was explicitly concluded:
{{quote|for the good fortune of the Athenians and the allies of the Athenians: so that the Spartans shall allow the Greeks 10 to be free and autonomous and to live at peace, possessing securely all their own (territory), &lt;nowiki&gt;[[and so that [the peace and the friendship which the Greeks] and the King [swore] shall be in force [and endure] in accordance with the 15 agreements]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;|Rhodes &amp; Osborne, ''Greek Historical Inscriptions 404-323 BC'' (2007), no 22.}}

The Athenians had thus taken clever advantage of the situation and the restoration of the naval confederacy clearly brought with it the undertaking to maintain the King's Peace. It had taken less than thirty years of Spartan hegemony to reverse attitudes on the Athenian empire. The first league had been presented as a threat to autonomy, but the second was claimed to be its protector. In order to prevent the Athenians from reassuming a hegemonic position, the new league was organised in accordance with the principles of the common peace. This is a sign that these principles were generally accepted by this time.

When the war with Sparta stagnated in 375 BC, the a willingness to make peace developed in Sparta and Athens. The Spartans could no longer hope for a victory and the Athenians had achieved their goals: the freedom of Thebes from Spartan control and the recognition of the sea league as compatible with the terms of the Peace of Antalcidas. [[Diodorus]] reports an embassy of the Great King came to secure a renewal of the peace, since the Persians needed peace in Greece in order to free the mercenaries up for a war they wanted to undertake in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus 15.38.1&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek states accepted the agreement and the Common Peace was renewed.

At this point, the Common Peace was extended in one respect: as already foreseen in the terms of the Second Athenian Confederacy, it was required that all foreign garrisons be removed from all cities. This was directed particularly at the Spartans who had garrisons in some south [[Boeotia]]n cities, such as [[Thespiae]] (actually at their request, as protection against the Thebans). The Thebans were thus the main beneficiaries of the Common Peace of 375. The Spartans had begun the war on the same grounds that the Athenians now wished to end it: to prevent the further growth of Theban power. However, in the end the departure of the Spartan troops on the pretext of the autonomy principle left the Thebans with a free hand in Boeotia. Even so, the Athenians were clearly on the winning side: their success lay in the recognition of a new confederacy. Neither the Spartans nor the Persians could do anything about this, as they had done ten years earlier.

Despite the Persian diplomatic involvement, the Common Peace of 375 can be seen as the first which derived principally from Greek initiative and in which all parties were of roughly equal strength and thus received equal terms. For the first time, a peaceful system seemed to be possible without enforcement by a hegemonic power.

=== Failed negotiations of 371 BC ===
Two opposing political groups had already developed in Athens before the treaty of 375 BC: one sought an agreement with Sparta, the other a strengthening of the alliance with Thebes. However, the anti-Spartan forces over-estimated Athens' position after the peace and supported a democratic insurgency against the government of the island of [[Corcyra]], which was allied with Sparta. Thus the Spartans, who were anything but satisfied with the result of the preceding clashes, already had grounds to go back to war a year and a half after the peace. At the same time, the situation was further complicated by the fact that Thebes destroyed the city of [[Plataea]] in 374/3 BC, which had an ancient alliance with Athens and had also been allied with Sparta since 380 BC. The Spartans therefore sent troops to [[Phokis]], to threaten Thebes and undo the failures of the preceding years. Thus, 371 BC once more saw the outbreak of a general conflict.

In Athens, however, the moderate politicians considered the best outcome for their city to lie in a policy of neutrality and proposed a new common peace. To support Thebes would decisively strengthen their position. Support of Sparta, on the other hand, would have alarmed their allies, who say them as a threat to their right to autonomy. Further factors were also relevant: if the Spartans refused the proposed league, the Athenians would have been forced to fight two wars at once. Therefore, the Athenians decided to overlook the fate of Plataea and invited the Thebans to a peace conference in Sparta. The Spartans were even more willing to make peace now, since their actions in Phocis had been unsuccessful. Threatening Thebes thus became unlikely, but the Spartans did not consider themselves to be in any danger.

The common peace which was now proposed at the initiative of the Athenians, again saw critical innovation. The Athenian interpretation of autonomy prevailed and according to Xenophon, the Spartans committed to removing all their [[harmost]]s from cities of the peace.&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, ''Hellenica'', 6.18–19&lt;/ref&gt; This was a difficult situation, since after 375 BC, only the cities in the Peloponnese (Sparta's chief area of influence) were relevant. Even more important for the continued development of idea of peace were rules which provided for all sides to demobilise their troops and fleets and which allowed the treaty partners to help one another in the event of an attack. The final clause, which did not impose a duty to help, was included at Athenian request. They intended to use it later to maintain the possibility of holding the balance of power between the other two powers.

Considered in isolation, this peace treaty could be taken as a skilled piece of Athenian diplomacy. But since it never actually came into effect, it can only be speculated whether it could have formed the basis of an enduring peace. After all, the treaty partners had taken account of the idea that sufficient force needed to be made available for use against potential treaty breakers in order to maintain the peace. In the Peace of Antalcidas, this had been accomplished by the threat of the Great King. In an agreement between free states, it had to be an agreement to oppose an attack on a treaty partner together.

At the planned swearing of the treaty, however, a serious rift arose between Thebes and Sparta. The Theban envoys had initially sworn to the agreement in the name of their own city and allowed that name to be placed on the treaty. But the next day, they demanded that the name of Thebes be replaced with that of the [[Boeotian League]], since they claimed to be entitled to represent it. The Spartans categorically rejected this, since in their view the Boeotian cities ought to be autonomous. The split led to war and only twenty days later, the [[Battle of Leuctra]] took place, which proved to be the first Spartan defeat in open battle and decisively altered the balance of power in Greece in Thebes' favour.

[[File:Griechenland 371-362.jpg|thumb|400px|Greece during the [[Theban Hegemony]], 371–362 BC.]]

After the battle, military activity ceased. At first, the Thebans undertook no further military action against the Spartans, who eventually sent troops to the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] to ward off any chance of a Theban attack on the Peloponnese. In this situation, the Athenians seized the initiative and called a peace conference, at which they could swear to the common peace once more and negotiate a new treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, ''Hellenica'', 6.5.2-3&lt;/ref&gt; This was motivated by the desire to prevent further increase in Theban power. An innovation in this new peace treaty was that the possibility of aiding a treaty partner in attacking a disturber of the peace was transformed into a duty. This was a logical development of the previous failed peace and was found at the start of all future common peace treaties. Some researchers see the second treaty of 371 as the foundation of a military alliance (''symmachia''), as a result of this duty to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Ernst Mayer in the review of Hampl, ''Staatsverträge'', in [[Zeitschrift der Savigny-Stiftung für Rechtsgeschichte|Zeitschrift für Rechtsgeschichte]], Romanische Abteilung 59 (1938), pp. 598–606&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spartans joined this new agreement immediately for their own sake. Their neighbours, the [[Elis|Eleans]] had already sought to take advantage of the defeat of Sparta in the meanwhile and they refused to recognise the autonomy of some of their border cities, which they had given up in 399 BC under Spartan compulsion, but had retaken after Leuctra.&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, ''Hellenica'', 6.5.3&lt;/ref&gt; Fatally, the Thebans did not agree to the treaty, since a common peace was inconsistent with their ambitions for their newly won hegemony. H. Bengtson saw this common peace as nothing more than an Athenian "gesture against Thebes, without practical value."&lt;ref&gt;Bengtson, ''Geschichte'', p. 279&lt;/ref&gt;

If the idea of the Common Peace had any chance to be based on equal rights for all states, it was in the short period between 375 BC and the Battle of Leuctra. Only then were there three Greek powers of roughly equal strength such that the strongest could be controlled by an alliance of the other two. Before and after this there was a clearly dominant hegemonic power (first Sparta, then Thebes) which either sought to use the common peace for their own purposes or rejected it altogether. Both approaches led to further military conflict. With the failure of the negotiations of 371 BC, the concept of the common peace largely lost credence as part of a practical policy.

===Peace treaties of 368 and 366 BC ===
In the year after Leuctra, the Thebans clearly established their hegemony. Through a campaign into the Peloponnese, they established the independence of the [[Messenians]], who had been ruled by the Spartans for centuries, and supported the establishment of the [[Arcadian League]]. A further war against an alliance of Sparta, Athens and [[Dionysius I of Syracuse]] proved inconclusive. Thus in 369/8 BC, all the Greek states responded to the call to meet in a peace conference at [[Delphi]], issued by [[Ariobarzanes of Phrygia|Ariobarzanes]], the satrap of [[Phrygia]].&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, Hellenica 7.1.27&lt;/ref&gt; However, the negotiations foundered in the face of the Spartans' refusal to accept Messenian independence - a position which was supported by the Athenians and by the Persian representative, Philiscus. Since Ariobarzanes went into rebellion against the Great King a little later, it is not entirely clear whether he was acting on the king's orders or in accordance with his own interests.&lt;ref&gt;See Ryder, ''Koine Eirene'', p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of further clashes, [[Dionysius II of Syracuse]] withdrew his aid from the Spartans, leading them to turn to the Persians for assistance once more. Thus, in 367/6 BC, Greek envoyse to the court of the Great king engaged in what the ancient historian [[Karl Julius Beloch]] referred to as the ''Wettkriechen'' (wager-creep), in which the Theban [[Pelopidas]] was ultimately successful. The Persians now recognised Thebes as the organising power in Greece in the same way that they had recognised Sparta in the King's Peace twenty years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ryder |first=T. T. B. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1957 |month= |title=The Supposed Common Peace of 366/5 BC |journal=The Classical Quarterly |volume=7 |issue=3/4 |pages=199–205 |doi=10.1017/S0009838800015275|quote= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |jstor= 637462 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Henceforth, the Messenians were to be independent from Sparta and [[Amphipolis]] from Athens, while the [[Elis|Eleans]] were granted the neighbouring area of [[Triphylia]]. Furthermore, all armies and the fleet of the Athenians were to be reduced in size.

This attempt at a common peace was rejected by Sparta and Athens. The Thebans did not manage to enthuse other city-states with the agreement either. These two attempts at a common peace under Theban hegemony represent a return to the idea of peace presented in 387 BC: the Persians attempted to use the influence of a Greek hegemonic power to force a common peace. That both attempts, unlike the King's Peace, were rejected is a result of the fact that the Great King had lost power as a peacebroker, as a result of the revolt of Ariobarzanes and other satraps. The most important reason for the course of events, however, may have been the experiences of the Greek cities with Paris after the King's Peace.

=== The Common Peace of 362 ===
Due to the growing Theban pressure on Athens (such as the seizure of [[Oropus]] in 366 BC), the Athenians became hostile once more, especially when actual help from their allies failed to materialise. None of the Greek states were able to gain full dominance in the following years. The conflict arising from the split in the Arkadian League also remained unresolved. This culminated in 362 BC with the [[Battle of Mantinea (362 BC)|Battle of Mantinea]], in which the Spartans, Athenians and their allies faced down the Thebans and their allies. After the battle, in which the foremost Theban commander [[Epaminondas]] was killed, both sides considered themselves the victors and again concluded a common peace.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus 15.89.1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time, the agreement was reached neither at the instigation of one of more leading powers, nor as a result of the power of the Persian king. In this and in the refusal of the Greek states to support the [[Great Satraps' Revolt]] against the Persian king in Asia Minor, many scholars have seen a positive element.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Taeger, ''Friede'', pp. 1–4&lt;/ref&gt; According to this viewpoint, the Greeks had managed to control themselves and establish a peace on their own. The opposing view is that the basis of this new common peace was simply the military and economic exhaustion of all parties, which also made an intervention in Asia Minor completely unthinkable.&lt;ref&gt;Bengtson, ''Geschichte'', S. 385 f.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The terms of the agreement particularly indicate that they arose from widespread war weariness and a desire to make peace as quickly as possible. They allowed each state to hold whatever they actually possessed at the time when the treaty was concluded. Territorial conflicts were not resolved at all - they no longer even posed an obstacle to agreement. The Arcadian League remained split into a northern and a southern half and the Messenians continued to be independent. Since half the land owned by the Spartans lay within Messenia, they did not accede to this common peace, but they were in no condition to carry on the war.

=== The Common Peace as the basis of the League of Corinth ===
[[File:Demosthenes2.jpg|thumb|Demosthenes]]
{{main|League of Corinth}}
After Mantinea, Greek politics continued along the same lines as before. When conflict with the rising power of [[Philip II of Macedon]] became more intense in the 350s, the idea of the Common Peace was revived once more. Philip first made the suggestion of replacing the [[Peace of Philocrates]] which had ended the [[Third Sacred War]] with a common peace. In the next few years, [[Demosthenes]] and other advocates of a decidedly anti-Macedonian approach gained preeminence in Athens. They rejected the proposal and called for war against Philip of Macedon. In 340/39 BC, the Athenians successfully brought together an alliance of Greek states, but their forces were decisively defeated by Philip at the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)|Battle of Chaeronea]] in 338 BC.

The Macedonians reacted harshly only against the Thebans, wishing instead to take advantage of the power of Athens and the other states by means of a league. The treaty establishing this league contained an express ban on interfering in the constitutions of other states by force (essentially an autonomy clause) and general bans on conflict and piracy for the first time, as well as a guarantee of free navigation. Only the Spartans refused to join this league. The other states were to send representatives, who would meet in a [[synedrion]] (council). They then entered into a personal alliance with Philip II, making him the Hegemon of the League.

Theoretically, the freedom and autonomy of the Greek state were thus assured. In practice, however, the general ban on conflict marked a striking limitation on independence. In addition, the Macedonians retained garrisons in the [[Cadmea]] of Thebes, the [[Acrocorinth]], and at [[Chalcis]] - ostensibly to maintain the common peace.

The League of Corinth therefore marked the end of the Common Peace as the foundation for full equality between states and linked the idea of peace strongly with the guarantee of a hegemonic power once more. The alliance and the common peace were interlinked in the league treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenberg, ''Staat'', pp. 146 &amp; 322&amp;nbsp;f.&lt;/ref&gt; The Panhellenic idea of a unified Greece and a campaign of vengeance against Persia were enabled by this Common Peace.

==Reasons for failure==
With 'autonomy and freedom' the Greek states at the beginning of the fourth century found a formula for a inclusive peace system which was acceptable to all sides. After 387 BC no peace was possible without it, even if the individual attempts only held for a few years each. However, the principles of the common peace also found their way into league treaties, such as the Second Athenian Sea League and the League of Corinth. A major opportunity for the development of a true Common Peace lay in the fact that the peace idea proved flexible enough to be developed further in this way.

Scholars like [[Bengtson]] take the view that the Greek city states did not have enough time before the establishment of the Macedonian hegemony, to fully adopt the Common Peace as an instrument of peace and as the foundations of a new order in the Greek world.&lt;ref&gt;Bengtson, ''Geschichte'', S. 255&lt;/ref&gt; The best chance for an enduring peace on the basis of equality between city states was probably missed with the failure of the Common Peace of 371 BC. Nine years later, after the Battle of Mantinea, a Common Peace was seen only as a compromise solution. The revival of the concept by Philip of Macedon was undertaken only in the interests of Macedonian power, as it had previously been used to support the interests of Persia, Sparta, Athens, and Thebes.

A major aspect of the failure of the Common Peace lay in the formulation of the concept itself, especially the broad interpretation of the autonomy clause.&lt;ref&gt;Ebenda, p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; The mutual control of Greek states by one another was only possible at the beginning of the fourth century. The idea that any limitations of the ability to wage war were restrictions on freedom and autonomy made any system of peace almost certain to fail.

The leaders of the city-states were aware that good will alone was not enough to guarantee a Common Peace. Depending on the political situation, they developed mechanisms of enforcement to prevent disturbances of the peace. They gradually came to the conclusion that a common peace on the basis of equal rights for all states was only possible if all participants were to immediately come to the aid of any member of the alliance under attack. This assumed a roughly equal balance of power between the Greek states, which actually only existed for a short period between 375 BC and the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC. Before and after these dates, a Common Peace would only have had a chance if a strong guaranteeing power was prepared to provide military support to the agreement as necessary.

==Afterlife==
The principles of the Common Peace developed by the Greeks in the fourth century BC, only developed once more in Europe in the 17th century when they became the basis for enduring peace agreements and systems. Thus, the [[Peace of Westphalia]] was the first European peace agreement in modern times to be based on priniciples of the equality of sovereign states and on the inviolability of their internal affairs - that is, on the idea of autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, ''Krieg''; S. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; In his work ''[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch|Perpetual Peace]]'' of 1795, [[Immanuel Kant]] went one step further. He advocated not only the principle of non-intervention, but also called for a ''Volkerbund'' (People's league). In order to end the lawless natural situation between states, this would establish a federal relationship between them, in a manner similar to the common peace proposed after the Battle of Leuctra.&lt;ref&gt;Kant, ''Frieden'', pp 19 &amp; 30 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Kant's ideas were appealed to in the twentieth century by the founders of the [[League of Nations]] and the [[United Nations]].

'''Communist Party of Finland''' ({{lang-fi|Suomen Kommunistinen Puolue}}, SKP {{lang-sv|Finlands kommunistiska parti}}, FKP) is a political party in Finland. It was founded in the mid-1980s as '''Communist Party of Finland (Unity)''' ({{lang-fi|Suomen Kommunistinen Puolue (yhtenäisyys)}}, SKPy, {{lang-sv|Finlands kommunistiska parti(enhet)}} FKP(e)) by the former opposition of the old [[Communist Party of Finland]] (1918–1992). SKP is not represented in the [[eduskunta|Finnish parliament]], but the party has local councillors in some municipalities, including the city councils of [[Helsinki]] and [[Tampere]]. SKP claims 2,500 members.

The party has been officially registered since 1997. In the 1980s, when the opposition and the organizations it controlled were expelled from the SKP led by [[Arvo Aalto]], the SKPy, however, chose not to register since they considered themselves the real SKP and claimed Aalto had illegally stolen the party. The courts later ruled all the expulsions illegal.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==History==

===The opposition inside SKP===

The internal conflict of Finnish communists began in the mid-1960s, when the party led by the new chairman [[Aarne Saarinen]], began to modernize the party line / outlook. A minority of the party cadre didn't accept this and they accused the SKP leadership of being [[Marxist revisionism|revisionist]]. SKP didn't break up in the 1960s and the party was formally united until the mid-1980s. After the 20th party congress in 1984 things, however, changed as [[Arvo Aalto]] was elected chairman, after which the opposition didn't participate in (or was left out of) the SKP central committee. The opposition, which was also known as “[[taistoism|taistoists]]”, called supporters of Aalto “axe liners”.

===The founding of SKPy===
The central committee of the SKP expelled eight opposition district organizations from the party 13 October 1985. Also, 494 other basic organizations and 17 city or regional organizations were expelled 13 June 1986, which the expelled then dubbed “Black Friday”. The opposition considered the actions to be against the law. They took the conflict to courts and because of minor technicalities Helsingin Hovioikeus court overruled SKP's decision 11 June 1987. SKP then re-expelled these same organizations in its 21st party congress (12–14 June 1987). However, a week before this happened, the newly founded SKP (Unity) held its own “21st” party congress. The ambiguities in the expelling process and the opposition's firm belief in its own cause gave it the justification it needed and they considered SKPy to be the real SKP. They claimed Aalto had illegally seized the party with “paper members”. SKPy was never taken to the official party register of Finland as the party considered that to have been voluntary resignation and admission of SKPy not being the real SKP.

April 26, 1986 a meeting of "the representatives of SKP organizations" was held in [[Tampere]] and those present elected a new central committee. The leader of the new central committee was [[Taisto Sinisalo]], former vice chairman of the SKP and the most well-known figure of the opposition, who already had led ''Committee of SKP Organizations'' founded in November 1985. In the SKPy's 21st party congress Sinisalo was re-elected. [[Yrjö Hakanen]] and [[Marja-Liisa Löyttyjärvi]] became the vice chairmen while the former SKP chairman [[Jouko Kajanoja]] was elected party secretary. In his congress speech, Sinisalo told that the suffix “unity” meant “strong intention to gather all the forces of the SKP”. The congress, however, also was heading to future and building of a new party, or “rebuilding” as they thought it. Before the name SKPy was adopted the party was known in media as the ''unity'' or ''Tiedonantaja group''.

===SKP and the Soviet Union===
SKPy was very committed to the [[Soviet Union]] and the political line of its [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] (CPSU), which was going through great changes during [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]]'s time. SKPy supported [[perestroika]] but criticized those who claimed to have been "Gorbachevist" even before Gorbachev's time. SKPy claimed SKP to be anti-SU and tried to give the Finnish people as positive a picture as possible of that country. When SKP split the monetary support from Soviet Union was halted and, for example, the very profitable publishing deals of the SKP had gone to SKPy. Gorbachev's CPSU, however, had relations with both parties.

===KTP splits from SKPy===
In the late 1970s the opposition of SKP began to split as those supporting a more traditional version of [[Marxism-Leninism]] began to criticize opposition leaders. When it was decided that SKPy would not be registered as an official party, some communists protested and demanded registration. They thought SKPy was clinging to the unity slogan in a situation in which it no longer seemed realistic. In the 1987 party congress, these people were warned by the SKPy leadership but they chose to ignore the advice and oriented themselves toward founding a new party. [[For Peace and Socialism - Communist Workers Party]] (''Kommunistinen Työväenpuolue – Rauhan ja Sosialismin puolesta'', KTP) was founded early in the year 1988. Founders of KTP felt to be securing the existence of a Marxist-Leninist party in Finland while criticizing SKPy for being revisionist and supporting [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. The most famous figure in the new party was probably [[Markus Kainulainen]], a longtime SKP district secretary of [[Uusimaa]] and a former MP.

===The founding of Left Alliance===
[[Esko-Juhani Tennilä]], a member of the [[Parliament of Finland]], was elected new chairman of SKPy 22 October 1989 when Kajanoja decided to resign while strongly criticizing his comrades. Tennilä has later told he took the job to secure that the founding of a new united left party would not be sabotaged by his own party comrades many of which were quite critical of it. The [[Left Alliance (Finland)|Left Alliance]] (''Vasemmistoliitto'') was founded in spring 1990 and members of SKPy and its electoral front Deva also joined even though prejudices were very high on both sides at this point.

===Dispute over double membership===
Members of the [[Left Alliance (Finland)|Left Alliance]] (LA) disliked that many of their members were also members of the SKPy. It was thus decided that SKPy members couldn't participate in the LA's electoral lists, even though they could be members. Because of this, Tennilä also had to quit his job as party chairman when joining LA group in parliament. [[Yrjö Hakanen]] was chosen Tennilä's successor. The dispute over double membership, as it was called, led to many SKPy members leaving LA and relations between the two parties got even colder. On the other hand, many former SKPy members were actively participating in LA.

===The “new” SKP===
In its 1993 party congress (August 28–29) SKPy oriented towards founding a new officially registered communist party and drafting of a new party program. A new party logo was also introduced to mark renewal. It was suggested that a congress to continue SKP's work should be held and that happened next year (November 26–27). In the congress the suffix “unity” was dropped from the name as SKPy now considered to consist of all those comrades who wanted to have an independent communist party. An athletic club was made the basis of new organization and renamed SKP. The decision split the party as some supporters would have preferred SKP to have a lesser role as “Marxist forum” of some kind. Leadership of Left Alliance was also not pleased with those plans. SKP would have wanted to stay inside LA but that wasn't possible and the parties split in the spring of 1994. SKP wasn't however “re-registered” until 1997. There was some confusion, as the new SKP didn't accept responsibility for debts of the old one, which had gone bankrupt.

SKP has a nationwide organization consisting of 14 district organizations. The [[central committee]] has 41 members and the [[politbyro]] 10. The organ of SKP is ''[[Tiedonantaja]]'', which was founded in the 1960s. Tiedonantaja was also the organ of Deva during 1986-1990. The editor-in-chief is [[Marko Korvela]] since 2012. SKP also has some local papers.

As the SKPy considered itself to be the real SKP it also had the same organizational structure. It was based on [[Leninist]] principle of [[democratic centralism]] and the party rules of 1958 (modified in 1978).

===Deva – SKPy's electoral front===
While SKPy was never officially registered, its supporters founded an electoral front [[Democratic Alternative (Finland)|Democratic Alternative]] (''{{lang|fi|Demokraattinen vaihtoehto}}'', Deva). Those MPs of [[Finnish People's Democratic League]] (''{{lang|fi|Suomen kansan demokraattinen liitto}}'', SKDL, a front organization dominated by SKP) who were against expulsions were expelled from SKDL and they found the parliament group of Deva. Deva was SKPy's SKDL and it was supposed to attract some democratic allies. The small [[Socialist Workers Party (Finland)|Socialist Workers Party]] (''{{lang|fi|Sosialistinen työväenpuolue}}'', STP) didn't join Deva but it had members on the DEVA list. Young supporters of SKPy and Deva founded [[Revolutionary Youth League (Finland)|Revolutionary Youth League]] (''{{lang|fi|Vallankumouksellinen nuorisoliitto}}'', VKN) which was Deva's youth organization. SKDL's [[Socialist Student League (Finland)|Socialist Student League]] (''{{lang|fi|Sosialistinen opiskelijaliitto}}'', SOL) also joined. Deva was led by actress [[Kristiina Halkola]].

In [[Finnish parliamentary election, 1987|1987 parliamentary elections]] Deva got 4.3% of votes and four MPs. In [[Finnish presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential elections]] Deva candidate [[Jouko Kajanoja]] got under 2 per cent of the votes. Not even all members of SKPy supported Kajanoja who was the party chairman. Deva was closed down in 1990 after [[Left Alliance (Finland)|Left Alliance]] was founded and most of its members joined the new party.

The SKP participates in [[Elections in Finland#Parliamentary elections|parliamentary]], [[European Parliament elections|European Parliament]] and [[Elections in Finland#Municipal elections|municipal]] elections. The party has not put up candidates in recent [[presidential elections]]. No national representatives has been elected from the SKP lists but the party has a few local councillors. The SKP also participates in trade union and cooperative elections.

The SKP first took part in parliamentary elections in 1999. The party had electoral alliances with small parties of ''Muutos 99'' coalition. It was the first time the Finnish electorate had an opportunity to vote for a list named Communist Party of Finland. In 2003 the vote-puller for the party was rock musician [[Kari Peitsamo]] (1 803 votes) and in 2007 rap artist [[Steen1|Seppo "Steen1" Lampela]] (1 842).

In the local elections the SKP has had elected councillors in about ten different municipalities. The party has got its strongest support in [[Nokia (city)|Nokia]], where there are three SKP councillors. Communists also briefly had three councillors in the [[Jyväskylä]] city council until early 2008.

The SKP has made electoral coalitions with other small parties, especially the Communist Workers Party (KTP). Communist League members were on SKP lists before they in 2006 founded the [[Workers Party of Finland]] (STP). The SKP condemned the STP for scattering communist forces.&lt;ref&gt;KTP:stä erotetut hajottivat Vaihtoehtoväen (Tiedonantaja 22.9.2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The parties have made some limited electoral cooperation since. The Left Alliance has never been interested in coalitions with the communists,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skp.fi/ajankohtaista/110806TA.html Vasemmistoliitto torjui vaaliliitot SKP:n kanssa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927211453/http://www.skp.fi/ajankohtaista/110806TA.html |date=2007-09-27 }} (Tiedonantaja 11.8.2006)&lt;/ref&gt; although the parties have had coalitions in few municipalities.

The former SKP chairman [[Yrjö Hakanen]] is an elected member of [[HOK-Elanto]] cooperative council since 1999. The SKP represented joint list with the KTP.

The '''Constitution of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic (1941)''' was the [[Constitution|fundamental law]] of the [[Moldovan SSR]], adopted in 1941.

== History ==

The Constitution of 1941 was adopted soon after the [[Elections in the Moldavian SSR, 1940|1940 Moldavian SSR elections]]. The Constitution was adopted at the first session of the [[Supreme Soviet]] of the [[Moldavian SSR]], on January 12, 1941. It was based on the principles and provisions of the [[1936 Soviet Constitution]]. 

[[Moldovans|Moldovan]] deputies represented 56% of the total number of representatives, although the titular ethnicity made up 65% of the republic's population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/52-6-111.shtml "The New Constitution of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216093607/http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/52-6-111.shtml |date=2009-02-16 }}, ''[[Radio Free Europe]]'' background report&lt;/ref&gt;

The Constitution was superseded by a [[Constitution of the Moldovan SSR (1978)|new one in 1978]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3159">'''Cultural variation''' refers to the rich diversity in social practices that different cultures exhibit around the world. Music, language, dance, cuisine and art all change from one culture to the next, but so do gender roles, economic systems, and social hierarchy among any number of other humanly organised behaviours. Cultural variation can be studied across cultures (for example, a cross-cultural study of ritual in Indonesia and Brazil)&lt;ref&gt;{{Mason, P.H. (2016) Fight-dancing and the Festival: Tabuik in Pariaman, Indonesia, and Iemanjá in Salvador da Bahia, Brazil. Martial Arts Studies Journal, 2, 71-90. DOI: 10.18573/j.2016.10065}}&lt;/ref&gt; or across generations (for example, a comparison of [[Generation X]] and [[Millennials|Generation Y]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Bristow, D., Amyx, D., Castleberry, S.

Journal of personal selling &amp; sales management, 31(1), 77-85.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is often a subject studied by anthropologists, sociologists and cultural theorists with subspecialties in the fields of economic anthropology, ethnomusicology, health sociology etc. In recent years, cultural variation has become a rich source of study in [[neuroanthropology]], [[cultural neuroscience]], and [[social neuroscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Domínguez D|first1=JF|last2=Turner|first2=R|last3=Lewis|first3=ED|last4=Egan|first4=GF|title=Neuroanthropology: A Humanistic Science for the Study of the Culture–Brain Nexus|journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience|date=2010|volume=5|pages=138–47|doi=10.1093/scan/nsp024|pmc=2894669}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Domínguez D|first1=JF|title=Neuroanthropology and the Dialectical Imperative|journal=Anthropological Theory|date=2012|volume=12|issue=1|pages=5–27|doi=10.1177/1463499612436459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2734">A '''death in office''' is the death of a person who was [[incumbent]] of an office-position until the time of death. Such deaths have been usually due to natural causes, but they are also caused by [[accident]]s and murders.

The death of most [[monarch]]s and [[pope]]s have been deaths in office, since they have usually held their papacy/reign for the rest of their lives. Otherwise as most office positions require that the person is constantly competent in performing the associated duties, deaths in office are usually premature deaths.

==Consequences==
{{see also|Order of succession|Casual vacancy}}
Systems differ in how they deal with the death of an office holder. In some death results in a [[casual vacancy]], whereby the office is unfilled for a time. The office may subsequently be filled by a [[by-election]] or by appointment. A person may temporarily take the powers and responsibilities of the deceased in an "acting" capacity before a permanent replacement is made. In other systems there may be a legally defined [[order of succession]]. For example, in [[Hereditary monarchy|hereditary monarchies]] reigns are typically expected to end with death and the transition of power to an heir. Many presidential systems have offices of [[Vice president#In government|vice president]], whose principle responsibility is to immediately assume the presidency if the president dies or otherwise leaves the office.

[[File:Henryk Siemiradzki 004.jpeg|thumb|300px|''An orgy in Imperial Rome'', by [[Henryk Siemiradzki]]]]
[[File:THOMAS COUTURE - Los Romanos de la Decadencia (Museo de Orsay, 1847. Óleo sobre lienzo, 472 x 772 cm).jpg|thumb|300px|''Romans during the Decadence'', by [[Thomas Couture]]]]

The word '''decadence''', which at first meant simply "decline" in an abstract sense, is now most often used to refer to a perceived decay in standards, morals, dignity, religious faith, or skill at governing among the members of the elite of a very large social structure, such as an empire or nation state. By extension, it may refer to a decline in art, literature, science, technology, and work ethics, or (very loosely) to self-indulgent behavior.

Usage of the term sometimes implies moral censure, or an acceptance of the idea, met with throughout the world since ancient times, that such declines are objectively observable and that they inevitably precede the destruction of the society in question; for this reason, modern historians use it with caution. The word originated in Medieval Latin ''(dēcadentia)'', appeared in 16th-century French, and entered English soon afterwards. It bore the neutral meaning of decay, decrease, or decline until the late 19th century, when the influence of new theories of [[social degeneration]] contributed to its modern meaning.

In literature, the [[Decadent movement]]—late nineteenth century ''[[fin de siècle]]'' writers who were associated with [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] or the [[Aesthetic movement]]—was first given its name by hostile critics. Later it was triumphantly adopted by some of the writers themselves. The Decadents praised artifice over nature and sophistication over simplicity, defying contemporary discourses of decline by embracing subjects and styles that their critics considered morbid and over-refined. Some of these writers were influenced by the tradition of the [[Gothic novel]] and by the poetry and fiction of [[Edgar Allan Poe]].

==History==
===Decadent movement===
{{Main|Decadent movement}}
[[File:Félicien Rops - Pornokratès - 1878.jpg|thumb|''[[Pornocrates]]'' by [[Félicien Rops]] (1878)]]
Decadence was the name given to a number of late nineteenth-century writers who valued artifice over the earlier Romantics' naïve view of nature. Some of them triumphantly adopted the name, referring to themselves as Decadents. For the most part, they were influenced by the tradition of the [[Gothic novel]] and by the poetry and fiction of [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and were associated with [[symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and/or [[Aestheticism]].

This concept of decadence dates from the eighteenth century, especially from [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], and was taken up by critics as a term of abuse after [[Désiré Nisard]] used it against [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Romanticism]] in general. A later generation of Romantics, such as [[Théophile Gautier]] and [[Charles Baudelaire]] took the word as a badge of pride, as a sign of their rejection of what they saw as banal "progress." In the 1880s, a group of [[French literature|French writers]] referred to themselves as Decadents. The classic [[novel]] from this group is [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]]' ''[[À rebours|Against Nature]]'', often seen as the first great decadent work, though others attribute this honor to Baudelaire's works.

In Britain and Ireland the leading figure associated with the Decadent movement was Irish writer, [[Oscar Wilde]]. Other significant figures include Arthur Symons, Aubrey Beardsley and Ernest Dowson.

The Symbolist movement has frequently been confused with the Decadent movement. Several young writers were derisively referred to in the press as "decadent" in the mid-1880s. [[Jean Moréas]]' manifesto was largely a response to this [[polemic]]. A few of these writers embraced the term while most avoided it. Although the aesthetics of Symbolism and Decadence can be seen as overlapping in some areas, the two remain distinct.

===1920s Berlin===
{{main|1920s Berlin}}

This "''fertile culture''" of Berlin extended onwards until [[Adolf Hitler]] rose to power in early 1933 and stamped out any and all resistance to the [[Nazi Party]]. Likewise, the Nazis decried Berlin as a haven of vice.{{Clarify|date=April 2008}} A new [[culture]] developed in and around Berlin, including architecture and design ([[Bauhaus]], 1919–33), a variety of literature ([[Alfred Döblin|Döblin]], ''[[Berlin Alexanderplatz]]'', 1929), film ([[Fritz Lang|Lang]], ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'', 1927, [[Marlene Dietrich|Dietrich]], ''[[Der blaue Engel]]'', 1930), painting ([[George Grosz|Grosz]]), and music ([[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]] and [[Kurt Weill|Weill]], ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'', 1928), criticism ([[Walter Benjamin|Benjamin]]), philosophy/psychology ([[Carl Jung|Jung]]), and fashion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} This culture was often considered to be decadent, and socially, morally, destructive.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkus UK review of Laqueur, Walter ''Weimar: A cultural history, 1918-1933''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cinema of Germany|Film]] was making huge technical and artistic strides during this period of time in Berlin, and gave rise to the influential movement called [[German Expressionism]]. "[[Talkies]]", the Sound films, were also becoming more popular with the general public across Europe, and Berlin was producing very many of them.

Berlin in the 20s also proved to be a haven for English writers such as [[W. H. Auden]], [[Stephen Spender]] and [[Christopher Isherwood]], who wrote a series of 'Berlin novels', inspiring the play ''[[I Am a Camera]]'', which was later adapted into a musical, ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'', and an [[Academy Award]] winning [[Cabaret (1972 film)|film of the same name]]. Spender's semi-autobiographical novel ''[[The Temple (Stephen Spender)|The Temple]]'' evokes the attitude and atmosphere of the place at the time.

==Use in Marxism==
===Leninism===
According to [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[capitalism]] had reached its highest stage and could no longer provide for the general development of society. He expected reduced vigor in economic activity and a growth in unhealthy economic phenomena, reflecting capitalism's gradually decreasing capacity to provide for social needs and preparing the ground for [[socialist]] revolution in the [[Western world|West]].  Politically, [[World War I]] proved the decadent nature of the advanced capitalist countries to Lenin, that [[capitalism]] had reached the stage where it would destroy its own prior achievements more than it would advance.&lt;ref name=libcom&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/decadence-aufheben-2 Decadence: The Theory of Decline or the Decline of Theory? (Part I)]. ''[[Aufheben]]''. Summer 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

One who directly opposed the idea of decadence as expressed by Lenin was [[José Ortega y Gasset]] in ''[[The Revolt of the Masses]]'' (1930). He argued that the "[[mass man]]" had the notion of material progress and scientific advance deeply inculcated to the extent that it was an expectation.  He also argued that contemporary progress was opposite the true decadence of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Mora, José Ferrater (1956). ''Ortega y Gasset: an outline of his philosophy.'' Bowes &amp; Bowes. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Left communism===
Decadence is an important aspect of contemporary left [[Communism|communist]] theory. Similar to Lenin's use of it, left communists, coming from the Communist International themselves started in fact with a theory of decadence in the first place, yet the communist left sees the theory of decadence at the heart of [[Karl Marx|Marx's]] method as well, expressed in famous works such as ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', ''[[Grundrisse]]'', ''[[Das Kapital]]'' but most significantly in ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy|Preface to the Critique of Political Economy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl (1859). ''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy.''  Progress Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary left communist theory defends that Lenin was mistaken on his definition of imperialism (although how grave his mistake was and how much of his work on imperialism is valid varies from groups to groups) and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] to be basically correct on this question, thus accepting capitalism as a world epoch similarly to Lenin, but a world epoch from which no capitalist state can oppose or avoid being a part of. On the other hand, the theoretical framework of capitalism's decadence varies between different groups while left communist organizations like the [[International Communist Current]] hold a basically [[Luxemburgist]] analysis that makes an emphasis on the world market and its expansion, others hold views more in line with those of [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Nikolai Bukharin]] and most importantly [[Henryk Grossman]] and [[Paul Mattick]] with an emphasis on monopolies and the falling [[rate of profit]].

The '''Democratic Representative Caucus''', also called the '''Democratic Representative Association''', was a [[parliamentary group]] in the [[37th Canadian Parliament]] consisting of Members of Parliament who left the [[Canadian Alliance]] in 2001 in protest against the leadership of [[Stockwell Day]]. Following the Alliance's disappointing performance in the [[Canadian federal election, 2000|2000 election]], Day came under severe criticism from his own party.  Several high-profile Alliance MPs began publicly calling for him to step down.  Through the spring of 2001, several members of the Alliance resigned their shadow cabinet seats, the most high-profile resignation being that of deputy leader [[Deborah Grey]].

On May 2, [[Art Hanger]] was the first Alliance MP suspended from caucus for criticizing Day. Over the next two months, 11 other Alliance MPs were either suspended from caucus or resigned.  On May 16, Hanger was followed by [[Chuck Strahl]], [[Gary Lunn]], [[Jim Pankiw]], [[Val Meredith]], [[Grant McNally]], [[Jay Hill]] and [[Jim Gouk]]. In late June, they were joined by [[Monte Solberg]], [[Andy Burton (politician)|Andy Burton]] and [[Brian Fitzpatrick (Canadian politician)|Brian Fitzpatrick]], and in the first week of July by [[Inky Mark]] and Grey. Through the summer, this group of MPs sat as "Independent Alliance Caucus", and were jokingly dubbed the "[[Rebel Alliance]]" by political commentators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ibbitson|first1=John|authorlink1=John Ibbitson|title=Stephen Harper|date=2015|publisher=McClelland &amp; Stewart|location=Toronto|isbn=9780771047091|page=146|quote=Others joined the 'Rebel Alliance' as reporters dubbed it. The Democratic Representative Caucus, as the dissidents preferred to be called...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early September, an offer was made to the MPs in which they would be readmitted to the Alliance caucus if they promised to refrain from criticizing Day's leadership. The MPs surveyed their constituents, and on September 10, the offer was accepted by Hanger, Gouk, Solberg, Fitzpatrick and Burton. The remaining seven MPs refused, and formed the Democratic Representative Caucus on September 12, with Strahl as its parliamentary leader and Grey as deputy leader. This was not intended as a new political party, but simply as a group caucus.

==Coalition with the Progressive Conservatives==
Two weeks later, on September 24, the DRC members entered into a coalition with the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives]], known as the "Progressive Conservative - Democratic Reform Coalition Caucus."  Strahl was named deputy leader of the coalition caucus, with Grey as caucus chairwoman.  The PC-DRC Coalition was intended to be PC leader [[Joe Clark]]'s framework for proving that the two parties could be united on his terms rather than Day's.  Clark and Strahl tried to propose common policies that would appeal to both PC and Alliance members.

While the DRC members insisted that they remained loyal to the Canadian Alliance despite their opposition to Day's leadership, the group founded the Democratic Representative Association (DRA), presumably to support their re-election campaigns as DRC Members of Parliament.

On November 19, Lunn left the DRC to rejoin the Alliance shortly after Day agreed to hold a new Alliance leadership race.

==End of the coalition==
In March 2002, Day lost that leadership race to [[Stephen Harper]], and on April 10, five of the seven DRC members returned to the Alliance caucus, terminating their coalition agreement with the PCs after Clark rebuffed Harper's attempts to seek a greater union between the Alliance and the Tories. The DRA was disbanded.

Mark chose not to return to the Alliance caucus, instead sitting as an Independent Conservative, then joining the PC caucus in early 2003.

Pankiw's request for readmission to the Alliance caucus was denied, as he was embroiled in a political scandal involving a violent confrontation with an aboriginal constituent. He ran for mayor of [[Saskatoon]], in 2003, while still sitting as an independent MP, and again attracted controversy because his home was in fact outside of Saskatoon's city limits and not in the city's Forest Grove area as he claimed on his application.

==Conservative Party of Canada==
Clark's successor, [[Peter MacKay]], negotiated a merger with the CA in late 2003, and he, along with Mark and most of the PC caucus, joined with the CA caucus to form the [[Conservative Party of Canada]], fulfilling the DRC's main goal of a unified centre right. But, Clark and a few other prominent PC MPs and senators refused to join the new party, whilst Pankiw was again refused admission along with another Saskatchewan CA MP, [[Larry Spencer]].

In 2004, Grey, having retired from politics, noted in her published political memoirs that the PC-DRC's full name was constantly misreported by the press, political commentators and the media. The official title of the coalition was "Progressive Conservative - Democratic ''Reform'' Coalition Caucus" as opposed to ''Representative''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15888">'''The [[family]] as a model for the organization of the [[State (polity)|state]]''' is a theory of [[political philosophy]].  It either explains the structure of certain kinds of state in terms of the structure of the family (as a model or as a claim about the historical growth of the state), or it attempts to justify certain types of state by appeal to the structure of the family.  The first writer to use it (certainly in any clear and developed way) was [[Aristotle]], who argued that the natural progression of human beings was from the family via small communities to the [[polis]].

Many writers from ancient times to the present have seen parallels between the family and the forms of the state. In particular, [[Monarchy|monarchists]] have argued that the state mirrors the [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] family, with the people obeying the [[Monarch|king]] as children obey their father.

==Ancient Greek thought==
The family&amp;ndash;state model was first expressed in ancient times, often as a form of justification for [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] rule.

[[Plutarch]] records a laconic saying of the [[Dorians]] attributed to [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]].  Asked why he didn't establish a democracy in the Lacedæmon, Lycurgus responded: “Begin, friend, and set it up in your family”. The Dorians of Crete and Sparta seemed to mirror the family institution and organization in their form of government. (see Plutarch's ''The Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans'' &amp;mdash; Lycurgus, p.&amp;nbsp;65)

[[Aristotle]] often describes personal and domestic relationships in terms of different forms of government. He gives examples such as men and their domestic animals, wives, slaves, and children. He says, for example: “the government of a household is a monarchy, since every house is governed by a single ruler”.(2)  Later in the same text he says that husbands exercise a [[republic]]an government over their wives and monarchical government over their children, and that they exhibit political office over slaves and royal office over the family in general. (''Politics'' Bk I, §v, 1&amp;ndash;2; 1259a 35&amp;ndash;1259b 1)

However, while he is prepared to use political terms as metaphors for domestic relationships, he is equally clear that such metaphors are limited:
:“Some thinkers, however, suppose that statesman, king, estate manager, and master of a family have a common character.  This is a mistake; they think that the distinction between them is not a difference in kind, but a simple, numerical difference.” (''Politics'' Bk I, §i)&lt;!-- standardise translations, &amp; add full reference here and following --&gt;
After discussing the various domestic relationships, he concludes: “mastership and statesmanship are not identical, nor are all forms of power the same, as some thinkers suppose.” (''Politics'' Bk I, §vi)

Aristotle's main notion is that the ancient Greek ''polis'' or city-state is the natural end of human beings; they start in family groups, progress naturally to forming villages, and finally come together in cities.  Thus the family forms the root of human relationships, but the city is the flower.

[[Arius Didymus]] in Stobaeus, 1st century CE, writes: “A primary kind of association (politeia) is the legal union of a man and woman for begetting children and for sharing life.”  From the collection of households a village is formed and from villages a city, “&lt;nowiki&gt;[s]&lt;/nowiki&gt;o just as the household yields for the city the seeds of its formation, thus it yields the constitution (politeia)”. Further, he claims: “Connected with the house is a pattern of monarchy, of aristocracy and of democracy.  The relationship of parents to children is monarchic, of husbands to wives aristocratic, of children to one another democratic.” (''Hellenistic Commentary to the New Testament'', edd Boring, Berger, &amp; Colpe)

==Confucian thought==
{{main|Role ethics}}

[[Confucius]] believed the child should be subordinate to the parent, younger brother to the older, wife to husband, and subject to the sovereign who is to be regarded as the [[father of the nation]]. The state as the family writ large was the most harmonious, orderly, and natural form of government. This was later expanded to cover [[international relations]] (e.g. the [[emperor of China]] is treated as the older brother of the [[list of Korean monarchs|Korean king]]). Confucian family theory is still espoused in [[North Korea]] to justify their method of leadership succession.

The concept of family is important in classical [[Confucianism]]. For Confucius, ''xiào'' or [[filial piety]] was a ''[[De (Chinese)|dé]]'' or [[virtue]]. The character representing ''xiào'', 孝, itself represents a basic family structure, with the upper component representing elders (''lao'', old), and the lower representing children (''zi'', son). Those acting with filial piety, such as through the performances of ''[[Li (Confucian)|lĭ]]'' were therefore acting in accordance with ''[[Yi (Confucianism)|yì]]'' (righteousness, or fulfilling one's proper roles or acting in harmony with one's station). The relationship of this concept to the state is discussed at length in the ''Xiàojīng'', or [[Classic of Filial Piety]]. In politics, ''xiào'' is not simply loyalty on the part of subordinates and citizens, but also an expectation for the king to provide for his subjects with "paternal love"; just as the people were expected to act with respect for the king's law, the king was expected to make those laws out of kindness for the people.&lt;ref&gt;Confucius.

American [[Edmund Roberts (diplomat)|diplomat Edmund Roberts]] in his description of [[Guangzhou|Canton City]], which he visited in 1832, included a quote on this, for which he gives no source, but which was subsequently include in latter 18th-century publications, again without a source:&lt;blockquote&gt;The sovereign of men, say they, "is heaven's son; nobles and statesmen are the sovereign's children; the people are the children of nobles and statesmen. The sovereign should serve heaven as a father, never forgetting to cherish reverential thoughts, but exciting himself to illustrate his virtues, and looking up to receive from heaven, the vast patrimony which it confers; thus the emperors will daily increase in felicity and glory. Nobles and ministers of state should serve their sovereign as a father, never forgetting to cherish reverential thoughts, not harbouring covetous and sordid desires, nor engaging in wicked and clandestine thoughts, but faithfully and justly exerting themselves; thus their noble rank will be preserved. The people should never forget to cherish reverential thoughts towards the nobles and ministers of state, to obey and keep the laws; to excite no secret or open rebellion; then no great calamity will befall their persons."&lt;ref name = "Roberts"&gt;{{cite book

==Modern thought==
[[Louis de Bonald]] wrote as if the family were a miniature state. In his analysis of the family relationships of father, mother and child, De Bonald related these to the functions of a state: the father is the power, the mother is the minister and the child as subject. As the father is “active and strong” and the child is “passive or weak”, the mother is the “median term between the two extremes of this continuous proportion”. De Bonald justified his analysis by quoting and interpreting passages from the [[Bible]]:

:“&lt;nowiki&gt;[It]&lt;/nowiki&gt; calls man the ''reason'', the ''head'', the power of woman: ''Vir caput est mulieris'' {man is head of woman} says St Paul.  It calls woman the helper or ''minister'' of man:  ‘Let us make man,’ says Genesis, ‘a helper similar to him.’  It calls the child a ''subject'', since it tells it, in a thousand places, to obey its parents”. (''On Divorce'' pp&amp;nbsp;44&amp;ndash;46)

De Bonald also sees divorce as the first stage of disorder in the state (the principle of [[macrocosm/microcosm]]). He insists that the ''deconstitution'' of the family brings about the deconstitution of state, with “[[The Kyklos]]” not far behind. (''On Divorce'', pp&amp;nbsp;88&amp;ndash;89; 149.)

[[Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn]] draws a connection between the family and monarchy:

:“Due to its inherent patriarchalism, monarchy fits organically into the ecclesiastic and familistic pattern of a Christian society.  (Compare the teaching of Pope [[Leo XIII]]: 'Likewise the powers of fathers of families preserves expressly a certain image and form of the authority which is in God, from which ''all paternity in heaven and earth receives its name'' &amp;mdash; Eph 3.15')  The relationship between the King as 'father of the fatherland' and the people is one of mutual love”. (''Liberty or Equality'', p.155)

==Politics and the family==
In her book, ''Delacroix, Art and Patrimony in Post-Revolutionary France'', Elisabeth Fraser analyses [[Eugène Delacroix]]'s famous “Massacres of Chios” (1824), which helped galvanise [[philo-Hellenism]] in France. Delacroix's symbol for the oppressed Greek nation was a family employed as a conceptual and visual structuring device. A reviewer encapsulated Fraser's argument:
:“Equating patriarchal family metaphor with government paternalism and imperialist protectionism, the chapter argues that such familial intimations, heightened by acute emotionalism and hints of a Western culture soiled by Eastern penetration, corresponded to and reflected a paternalistic government urge to protect the victimized Greeks, a thinly veiled justification for French colonial intervention in the Mediterranean.” [http://www.kunstform.historicum.net/2005/02/4653.html Nina Athanassoglou-Kallmyer]

More recently, [[George Lakoff]] has claimed that the [[left-right politics|left/right distinction]] in politics comes from a difference between ideals of the family in the mind of the person in question; for [[right-wing]] people, the ideal is a patriarchical and moralistic family; for [[left-wing]] people, the ideal is an unconditionally loving family. As a result, Lakoff argues, both sides find each other's views not only immoral, but incomprehensible, since they appear to violate each side's deeply held beliefs about personal morality in the sphere of the family.[https://web.archive.org/web/20020416055642/http://www.texasobserver.org/showArticle.asp?ArticleID=515].

Such a model is not a recent addition to modern discourse; J. Vernon Jenson discussed “British Voices on the Eve of the American Revolution: Trapped by the Family Metaphor” in the ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' 63 (1977), pp&amp;nbsp;43&amp;ndash;50.

The idea of the [[commonwealth]] as a family is close to [[cliché]]; it permeates political discourse at every level:

:“There is an historic American National Family metaphor .. That American National Family frame is like any real extended family-fractious but in the end functional. There are people in it who aren't just like you, but they are still family and we still have to try to solve our problems together, despite our differences.” &amp;mdash; [http://metaphorproject.org/our-one-big-family-frame/           Susan C. Strong, ''Our 'One Big Family' Frame'']

The '''Finnish Rural Party''' ({{lang-fi|Suomen maaseudun puolue}}, SMP; {{lang-sv|Finlands landsbygdsparti}}, FLP) was an [[Agrarianism|agrarian]]&lt;ref name="Bergqvist1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christina Bergqvist|title=Equal Democracies?: Gender and Politics in the Nordic Countries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t8bfrJvsfJ8C&amp;pg=PA319|date=1 January 1999|publisher=Nordic Council of Ministers|isbn=978-82-00-12799-4|pages=319–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[populism|populist]] [[List of political parties in Finland|political party in Finland]]. Starting as a breakaway faction of the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Agrarian League]] in 1959, the party was identified with the person of [[Veikko Vennamo]], a former Agrarian League Member of Parliament known for his opposition to the politics of President [[Urho Kekkonen]]. Vennamo was chairman of the Finnish Rural Party between 1959 and 1979.

Support for the party was at its highest in the 1970s and 1980s, with its share of the votes reaching around 10 percent in some parliamentary elections.&lt;ref name="edoc.hu-berlin.de"&gt;Anders Widfeldt: “A fourth phase of the extreme right? Nordic immigration-critical parties in a comparative context”. In: NORDEUROPAforum (2010:1/2), 7-31, http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/nordeuropaforum/2010-1/widfeldt-anders-7/XML/&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, the party fell into financial trouble and was disbanded in 1995 (formally disolved in 2003). The [[True Finns]] party is the successor of the Finnish Rural Party.

==History==
The founder of the Finnish Rural Party was [[Veikko Vennamo]], leader of a faction in the Agrarian League (which was renamed [[Centre Party of Finland|Centre Party]] in 1965). The relations of Veikko Vennamo and the Agrarian League's strong man [[Urho Kekkonen]] were icy at best, and after Kekkonen was elected [[President of Finland|president]] in 1956 Vennamo ran into serious disagreement with the party secretary, Arvo Korsimo, and was excluded from the parliamentary group. As a result, he immediately founded his own party in 1959.

The Finnish Rural Party started as a protest movement, with support from the unemployed and small farmers.&lt;ref name="edoc.hu-berlin.de"/&gt; The state-sponsored resettlement of veterans of World War II and evacuees from [[Evacuation of Finnish Karelia|ceded Karelia]] into independent small farms provided an independent power base to Vennamo. Vennamo was the honorary chairman of ''Asutusliitto'', the resettler society, and the society was involved in early campaigning. For the newly founded party, the main carrying force was Vennamo, who was charismatic, a good orator and a skilled negotiator.

The Rural Party won in its best showing 18 seats in the Finnish parliament (which has 200 seats) in the 1970 election. The party got the exact same amount of MPs in the next election in 1972, but was soon after split in two as majority of the parliamentary group (12 MPs) resigned and established a new party called [[Finnish People's Unity Party]] (''Suomen Kansan Yhtenäisyyden Puolue'', SKYP). The party defectors accused Vennamo of autocratic leadership. Veikko Vennamo's son, [[Pekka Vennamo]], became the party leader when his father retired in the 1980s. Vennamo Junior had neither the charisma nor the oratorical skills of his father. Other parties noticed this, and the Rural Party was taken into the cabinet in 1983. As a protest movement without a charismatic leader, burdened with ministers participating in unpopular coalitions, the party gradually lost political support.

Agricultural changes proved hard for small farmers, who sold their farms and moved to the cities. The [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democratic Party]] was seen as a more credible alternative for the unemployed. Finally, the declining support of the Rural Party forced Vennamo Junior to resign. Some of the party's former MPs joined the [[Centre Party of Finland|Centre Party]] or retired with Vennamo. The party's last chairman and MP [[Raimo Vistbacka]] (the only one elected in 1995) was among the founders of [[Finns Party]] and became that party's first MP and chairman. The Rural Party's last party secretary [[Timo Soini]] likewise became the Finns Party's first party secretary. With the Finns Party's electoral success in the [[Finnish parliamentary election, 2011|2011 election]] three former Rural Party MPs returned to the parliament as the Finns Party MPs (Anssi Joutsenlahti, Lea Mäkipää, Pentti Kettunen).

'''Gaming the system''' (also '''gaming''' or '''bending the rules''', or '''rigging''', '''abusing''', '''cheating''', '''milking''', '''playing''' or '''working the system''') can be defined as using the rules and procedures meant to protect a system to, instead,  [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] the system for a desired outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

According to James Rieley, a British advisor to CEOs and an author, structures in companies and organizations (both explicit and implicit policies and procedures, stated goals, and mental models) drive behaviors that are detrimental to long-term organizational success and stifle competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gaming the System: how to stop playing the organizational game and start playing the competitive game|author=James Rieley|date=April 2001|isbn=978-0-273-65419-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some, error is the essence of gaming the system, in which a gap in protocol allows for errant practices that lead to unintended results.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cgg.appstate.edu/faculty/mark-nunes Mark Nunes], ''Error: Glitch, Noise, and Jam in New Media Cultures'' (2010) p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term generally carries negative connotations, gaming the system can be used for benign purposes in the undermining and dismantling of corrupt or oppressive organisations.

==History==
{{expand section|date=July 2016}}
The first known documented use of the term "gaming the system" is in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-ZNTAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22gaming+the+system%22&amp;dq=%22gaming+the+system%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=L9sFVeSsK4GvUZD7gyA&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBjg8 1975 Systems Engineering Conference Proceedings, Las Vegas, Nevada, November 19-21, 1975]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Finance===
[[Henry Paulson]], considering that the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]] demonstrated that US financial markets had outgrown the ability of the system that had been used to regulate them, saw as a necessity a better framework than US financial markets had used before. This framework would be one that featured less duplication and that restricted the ability of financial firms to pick and choose their own, generally less strict  regulators—a practice known as [[regulatory arbitrage]],&lt;ref&gt;Hank Paulson, ''On the Brink'' (London 2010) p. 441&lt;/ref&gt; which enabled widespread gaming of the regulatory system.

A similar, contributing effect has been identified within corporate rating systems, where gaming the system becomes virulent when formalization is combined with transparency.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lounsbury/P. M. Hirsch, ''Markets on Trial'' (2010) p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet===
{{See also|Hacker (computer security)}}

Designers of [[online communities]] are explicitly warned that whenever one creates a system for managing a community, someone will try to work it to their advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Bell, ''Building Social Web Applications'' (2009) p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, they are advised from the start to think like a bad guy and to consider what behaviors they are unintentionally encouraging by creating some new social rules for the community.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child-rearing===
Parental divisions on child-rearing will always give the child plenty of opportunity to play one parent off against the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robin |last=Skynner |first2=John |last2=Cleese |title=[[Families and How to Survive Them]] |location=London |publisher=Cedar |year=1994 |page=221 |isbn=0-7493-1410-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Object relations theory]] stresses, however, that while, if a child finds one parent easy to get round, compared with the other who is trying to set limits, it is likely to take advantage of that split. According to this theory, this is always a hollow triumph; what the child is really hoping is that such parents will eventually begin to see a need to get together on the issue of limit-setting.&lt;ref name="Casement, p. 114"&gt;{{cite book |first=Patrick |last=Casement |title=Further Learning from the Patient |location=London |publisher=Routledge |year=1997 |page=114 |isbn=0-415-05425-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the particular point of contingent feeding—offering treats on condition that a certain unpopular food is eaten—it has been specifically noted that contingent feeding encourages children to argue and practice gaming the system fighting over the fine print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Roy |last=Benaroch |title=Solving Health and Behavioral Problems from Birth Through Preschool |year=2008 |location=Westport |publisher=Praeger |isbn=978-0-275-99347-4 |page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NHS dentistry===
[[NHS dentistry]] in the UK sees the frequent use of "gaming the system" to describe the use of adapting treatment to the payment system, and is frequently referred to as simply "gaming". The practice of adapting treatment to payment systems, rather than clinical need, is thought to be widespread in NHS dentistry and is considered by some to be as a result of a poorly-planned target based system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Holden |first = A.C.L. | journal = British Dental Journal | title= Justice and NHS dental treatment - is injustice rife in NHS dentistry? | volume = 214 |issue = 7 | pages = 335–337 | date = 12 April 2013 | url = http://www.nature.com/bdj/journal/v214/n7/full/sj.bdj.2013.323.html|pmid = 23579129 |doi = 10.1038/sj.bdj.2013.323 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used to describe obfuscation of the scope of NHS dentistry in order to "upsell" items of treatment that should be available.

===Performance management===

In [[performance management]], gaming the system is finding ways to achieve good scores on [[performance metric]]s (for employees or departments) without achieving the aims of the corporation which the metrics were instigated to promote. This is related to the well-known problem inherent in [[incentive system]] design, in that people will tend to pursue incentives, even by means that make no common sense, should the incentive be naively constructed.

===Other===
[[Eric Berne]] identified a kind of gaming the system in a clinical context through what he called the [[Games People Play (book)|game]] of "Psychiatry", with its motto "You will never cure me, but you will teach me to be a better neurotic (play a better game of 'Psychiatry')."&lt;ref name="Eric Berne p. 136"&gt;Eric Berne, ''Games People Play'' (Penguin) p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; A few patients, he noted, carefully pick weak [[psychoanalysts]], moving from one to another, demonstrating that they can't be cured and meanwhile learning to play a sharper and sharper game of 'Psychiatry;' eventually it becomes difficult for even a first-rate clinician to separate the wheat from the chaff.&lt;ref name="Eric Berne p. 136"/&gt;

Some people confuse "gaming the system" with "working the system".  Gaming the system has a negative connotation, while working the system has a positive meaning.  Working the system implies that one is using an understanding to work within the system to attain sets of goals that align, whereas gaming the system implies using this understanding to attain specific goals that don't align with the rest of a set of goals. Depending on the observers interest or preferred goals, this may be perceived as unfair or as an outcome for which the system was never intended. The cause of the difference between gaming the system and working the system lies in the existence of a (perceived) [[Goal setting|conflict between goals]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14399">[[File:Jean-Jacques Rousseau (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|Jean-Jacques Rousseau, populariser of the idea of the general will]]

In [[political philosophy]], the '''general will''' ({{lang-fr|volonté générale}}) is the [[will (philosophy)|will]] of the people as a whole. The term was made famous by 18th-century French philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].

==Basic ideas==

The phrase "general will," as Rousseau used it, occurs in Article Six of the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen]]'' (French: ''Déclaration des droits de l'Homme et du citoyen''), composed in 1789 during the [[French Revolution]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;The law is the expression of the general will. All citizens have the right to contribute personally, or through their representatives, to its formation. It must be the same for all, whether it protects or punishes. All citizens, being equal in its eyes, are equally admissible to all public dignities, positions, and employments, according to their capacities, and without any other distinction than that of their virtues and their talents.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in James Swenson, ''On Jean-Jacques Rousseau'' (Stanford University Press 2001), p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

James Swenson writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;To my knowledge, the only time Rousseau actually uses the formulation "expression of the general will" is in a passage of the ''Discours sur l'économie politique'', whose content renders it little susceptible of celebrity. [...] But it is indeed a faithful summary of his doctrine, faithful enough that commentators frequently adopt it without any hesitation. Among Rousseau's definitions of law, the textually closest variant can be found in a passage of the ''Lettres écrites de la montagne'' summarizing the argument of ''Du contrat social'', in which law is defined as "a public and solemn declaration of the general will on an object of common interest."&lt;ref&gt;''Lettres de la montagne'', quoted in Swenson (2000), p. 164. See also: Patrick Riley, ''The General Will before Rousseau'' (Princeton University Press, 1988) and Mark Hulliung "Rousseau, Voltaire and the Revenge of Pascal" in the ''Cambridge Companion to Rousseau'', edited by Patrick Riley (Cambridge University Press: 2000), pp. 57-77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As used by Rousseau, the "general will" is considered by some identical to the [[rule of law]],&lt;ref&gt;See Maurice Cranston's introduction to the ''Social Contract'', Penguin Classics, 1968, pp. 9-42.&lt;/ref&gt; and to Spinoza's ''mens una''.&lt;ref&gt;for Spinoza's ''mens una'', see Jonathan Israel, ''Radical Enlightenment'' (Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The notion of the general will is wholly central to Rousseau's theory of [[political legitimacy]]. [...] It is, however, an unfortunately obscure and controversial notion. Some commentators see it as no more than the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] or the tyranny of the urban poor (such as may perhaps be seen in the French Revolution). Such was not Rousseau's meaning. This is clear from the ''Discourse on Political Economy'', where Rousseau emphasizes that the general will exists to protect individuals against the mass, not to require them to be sacrificed to it. He is, of course, sharply aware that men have selfish and sectional interests which will lead them to try to oppress others. It is for this reason that loyalty to the good of all alike must be a supreme (although not exclusive) commitment by everyone, not only if a truly general will is to be heeded but also if it is to be formulated successfully in the first place".&lt;ref&gt;Entry, "Rousseau" in the ''Routelege Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Edward Craig, editor, Volume Eight, p. 371&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticisms==
Early critics of Rousseau included [[Benjamin Constant]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].  Hegel argued that, because it lacked any grounding in an objective ideal of reason, Rousseau's account of the general will ineluctably lead to the [[Reign of Terror]].  Constant also blamed Rousseau for the excesses of the French Revolution, and he rejected the total subordination of the citizen-subjects to the determinations of the general will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Political Theory |contribution=General Will |author=Joseph Reisert |editor-first=Mark |editor-last=Bevir |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gryvMfjg-zEC&amp;pg=PA553&amp;lpg=PA553&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |pages=551–553 |year=2010 |isbn=1412958652 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952 [[Jacob Talmon]] characterized Rousseau's "general will" as leading to a [[totalitarian democracy]] because, Talmon argued, the state subjected its citizens to the supposedly infallible will of the [[tyranny of the majority|majority]]. Another writer of the period, liberal theorist [[Karl Popper]], also interpreted Rousseau in this way, while [[Bertrand Russell]] warned that "the doctrine of general will ... made possible the mystic identification of a leader with its people, which has no need of confirmation by so mundane an apparatus as the ballot box."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_tGAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Rousseau's Social Contract: An Introduction |author= David Lay Williams |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year= 2014 |isbn=978-0521124447 |pages=1–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other prominent critics include [[Isaiah Berlin]] who argued that Rousseau's association of freedom with obedience to the General Will allowed totalitarian leaders to defend oppression in the name of freedom, and made Rousseau "one of the most sinister and formidable enemies of liberty in the whole history of human thought."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dj-bMlq0V5QC&amp;pg=PA61#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Isaiah Berlin: Liberty, Pluralism and Liberalism |author= George Crowder |page=61 |publisher=Polity |year= 2004 |isbn=978-0745624778 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defense of Rousseau==
Some Rousseau scholars, however, such as his biographer and editor Maurice Cranston, and Ralph Leigh, editor of Rousseau's correspondence, do not consider Talmon's 1950s "totalitarian thesis" as sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;For a rejoinder to Talmon see R. A. Leigh, "Liberté et autorité dans le Contrat Social" in ''Jean-Jacques Rousseau et son oeuvre'', (Paris, 1963).&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of Rousseau argued that Rousseau was not alone among republican political theorists in thinking that small, homogeneous states were best suited to maintaining the freedom of their citizens. [[Montesquieu]] and [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] were also of this opinion. Furthermore, Rousseau envisioned his ''[[Social Contract]]'' as part of a projected larger work on political philosophy, which would have dealt with issues in larger states. Some of his later writings, such as his ''Discourse on Political Economy'', his proposals for a Constitution of Poland, and his essay on maintaining perpetual peace, in which he recommends a federated [[European Union]], gave an idea of the future direction of his thought.

His defenders also argued Rousseau is one of the great prose stylists and because of his penchant for the paradoxical effect obtained by stating something strongly and then going on to qualify or negate it, it is easy to misrepresent his ideas by taking them out of context.

Rousseau was also a great synthesizer who was deeply engaged in a dialog with his contemporaries and with the writers of the past, such as the theorists of [[Natural Law]], [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] and [[Hugo Grotius|Grotius]]. Like "the body politic", "the general will" was a term of art and was not invented by Rousseau, though admittedly Rousseau did not always go out of his way to explicitly  acknowledge his debt to the jurists and theologians who influenced him. Prior to Rousseau, the phrase "general will" referred explicitly to the general (as opposed to the particular) will or ''volition'' (as it is sometimes translated) of the Deity. It occurs in the theological writings of [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/malebranche/ See the "Nicolas Malebranche" entry in the ''Stanford History of Philosophy'' (revised 2009).]&lt;/ref&gt; who had picked it up from [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], and in the writings of Malebranche's pupil, [[Montesquieu]],&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Riley, "The General Will Before Rousseau", ''Political Theory'' 6: 4: Special Issue: ''Jean-Jacques Rousseau'' (Nov., 1978): 485-516&lt;/ref&gt; who contrasted ''volonté particulière'' and ''volonté générale'' in a secular sense in his most celebrated chapter (Chapter XI) of [[The Spirit of the Laws|''De L'Esprit des Lois'']] (1748).&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau at one point, states that the most profound metaphysics are to be found in "Plato, Locke, or Malebranche" P [IV: III], quoted in Charles William Hendel, ''Rousseau Moralist'' [Oxford University Press, 1934], p. 169. See also [https://books.google.com/books?id=ybYLfAw_084C&amp;pg=PA742&amp;lpg=PA742&amp;dq=malebranche+general+volition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lsDW9D1Ynv&amp;sig=vLTOvg4jdzzpmeer3w1OXV4RIio&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yAOTT97eI5OM6QGM2p2pBA&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwCA#v=snippet&amp;q=general%20volition&amp;f=false  Nicolas Malebranche,  ''Malebranche: The Search After Truth: With Elucidations of The Search After Truth'', Thomas M. Lennon and Paul J. Olscamp, editors (Cambridge University Press, 1997), p. 742.]&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Discourse on Political Economy'', Rousseau explicitly credits [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]]'s ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' article "''Droit Naturel''" as the source of "the luminous concept" of the general will, of which he maintains his own thoughts are simply a development. Montesquieu, Diderot, and Rousseau's innovation was to use the term in a secular rather than theological sense.

==Quotations==
'''Diderot on the General Will''' [emphasis added]:&lt;blockquote&gt;
EVERYTHING you conceive, everything you contemplate, will be good, great, elevated, sublime, if it accords with ''the general and common interest''. There is no quality essential to your species apart from that which you demand from all your fellow men to ensure your happiness and theirs . . . . [D]o not ever lose sight of it, or else you will find that your comprehension of the notions of goodness, justice, humanity and virtue grow dim. Say to yourself often, “I am a man, and I have no other truly inalienable natural rights except those of humanity.”  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
But, you will ask, in what does this '''general will''' reside? Where can I consult it? [...] [The answer is:] In the principles of prescribed law of all civilized nations, in the social practices of savage and barbarous peoples; in the tacit agreements obtaining amongst the enemies of mankind; and even in those two emotions — indignation and resentment — which nature has extended as far as animals to compensate for social laws and public retributions. --Denis Diderot, “''Droit Naturel''” article in the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Diderot: Political writings: Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought,'' edited by John Hope Mason and Robert Walker (Cambridge University Press, 1992), p. 20. Compare Rousseau: “Cast your eyes on all the nations of the world, go through all the histories. Among so many inhuman and bizarre cults, among this prodigious diversity of morals and character, you will find everywhere the same ideas of justice and decency, everywhere the same notions of good and bad” (''Emile'', 288, [IV 597-98]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
'''Rousseau on the General Will''' [emphasis added]:&lt;blockquote&gt;AS long as several men assembled together consider themselves as a single body, they have only ''one will'' which is directed towards their common preservation and general well-being. Then, all the animating forces of the state are vigorous and simple, and its principles are clear and luminous; it has no incompatible or conflicting interests; the ''common good'' makes itself so manifestly evident that only common sense is needed to discern it. Peace, unity and equality are the enemies of political sophistication. Upright and simple men are difficult to deceive precisely because of their simplicity; stratagems and clever arguments do not prevail upon them, they are not indeed subtle enough to be dupes. When we see among the happiest people in the world bands of peasants regulating the affairs of state under an oak tree, and always acting wisely, can we help feeling a certain contempt for the refinements of other nations, which employ so much skill and effort to make themselves at once illustrious and wretched?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A state thus governed needs very few laws [...]&lt;ref&gt;''Of the Social Contract'', Book IV, Chapter 1, Paragraphs 1 &amp; 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;However, when the social tie begins to slacken and the state to weaken, when particular interests begin to make themselves felt and sectional societies begin to exert an influence over the greater society, the ''common interest'' then becomes corrupted and meets opposition, voting is no longer unanimous; the '''general will''' is no longer the will of all; contradictions and disputes arise, and even the best opinion is not allowed to prevail unchallenged."&lt;ref&gt;''The Social Contract'', Book IV, paragraph 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;For this reason the sensible rule for regulating public assemblies is one intended not so much to uphold the '''general will''' there, as to ensure that it is always questioned and always responds.&lt;ref&gt;''The Social Contract'', Book IV, Chapter 1, Paragraph 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St Patrick's saltire.svg|thumb|right|The Greenshirts, like their Blueshirt predecessors, used the Saint Patrick's saltire flag as the symbol of their movement.]]

The '''Greenshirts''' were members of the [[fascist]] [[National Corporate Party]] (NCP) in [[Ireland]] in the 1930s. The NCP was founded by [[Eoin O'Duffy]] after he broke from the [[Fine Gael]] party in 1935. The Greenshirts were different from the better known [[Blueshirts]], O'Duffy's followers before he left Fine Gael. Only eighty of the Blueshirts later became Greenshirts. It was an influence to a later fascist party, [[Ailtirí na hAiséirghe]].

In 1936 O'Duffy [[Irish Brigade (Spanish Civil War)|led a volunteer Irish Brigade]] to fight for the Nationalists in the [[Spanish Civil War]], and retired on his return in 1937. Without him, both the Greenshirts and NCP faded away.

'''Jantantrik Bahujan Samaj Party''' (Democratic Majority Society Party), splinter group of [[Bahujan Samaj Party]] (BSP) formed in 1997 when 19 BSP Members of the Legislative Assembly of [[Uttar Pradesh]] broke away. JBSP allied themselves with [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) and joined the [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]]. In UP they gave their support to [[Kalyan Singh]]'s government. 17 out of the JBSP MLAs were inducted as ministers in the state government. The president of JBSP was DP Yadav ([[Rajya Sabha]] MP) and the general secretary Shahidullah Khan.

JBSP became an unstable party, and suffered various splits. Four MLAs defected to [[Lok Jan Shakti Party]]. Another splinter group was [[Kisan Mazdoor Bahujan Party]].

When JBSP fell apart DP Yadav organized a new party, [[Rashtriya Parivartan Dal]].

JBSP should not be confused with another BSP splinter group, [[Loktantrik Bahujan Samaj Party]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19491">{{Judaism}}The relationship between '''[[Judaism]] and [[politics]]''' is a historically complex subject, and has evolved over time concurrently with both changes within Jewish society and religious practice, and changes in the secular societies that [[Jews]] live in. In particular, Jewish political thought can be split into four major eras: '''biblical''' (prior to Roman rule), '''rabbinic''' (from roughly the 100 BCE to 600 CE), '''medieval''' (from roughly 600 CE to 1800 CE), and '''modern''' (18th century to the present day). 

Political leadership is a common topic in the [[Hebrew Bible]], and several different political models are described across its canon, usually composed of some combination of [[Tribe|tribal]] [[federation]], [[monarchy]], a [[Kohen|priestly]] [[theocracy]], and rule by [[Prophet|prophets]]. Political organization during the [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbinic]] and [[History of European Jews in the Middle Ages|Medieval]] generally involved semi-autonomous rule by Jewish councils and courts (with council membership often composed purely of [[Rabbi|rabbis]]) that would govern the community and act as representatives to [[secular]] authorities outside the Jewish community. Beginning in the 19th century, and coinciding with the expansion of the political rights accorded to individual Jews in European society, Jews would affiliate with and contribute theory to a wide range of political movements and philosophies.

==Biblical Models==

{{MoreInfo}}

There are many models for political leadership described in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. Stuart Cohen has pointed out that there are three separate power centers depicted in the Hebrew Bible: the priesthood, the royal throne, and the prophets.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Cohen, ''The Three Crowns''&lt;/ref&gt;

One model of Biblical politics is the model of the tribal federation, where power is shared among different tribes and institutions. Another is the model of limited constitutional monarchy.&lt;ref name="jcpa.org"&gt;Daniel Elazar, [http://www.jcpa.org/dje/books/kincon-ch1.htm "Covenant as the Basis of the Jewish Political Tradition"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bible appears to command appointing a king in the Book of Deuteronomy with the following command: "When you come into the land that the Lord your God is about to give you, and you take hold of it and dwell in it, and you say, 'Let me put a king over me like all the nations that are around me', you shall surely put over you a king whom the Lord your God chooses..." (Deut. 17:14-15).

The [[Hebrew Bible]] contains a complex [[chronicle]] of the [[Kings of Israel]] and [[Kings of Judah|Judah]], written over the course of many generations by authors whose relationships and intimacy with the rulers of the several kingdoms fluctuated widely in both intimacy and respect. Some historical passages of the Hebrew Bible contain intimate portrayals of the inner workings of the royal households of [[Saul]], [[David]], and [[Solomon]]; the accounts of subsequent monarchs are frequently more distanced and less detailed, and frequently begin with the judgement that the monarch "did evil in the sight of the Lord".

[[Daniel Elazar]] has argued that the concept of [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]] is the fundamental concept in the Biblical political tradition and in the later Jewish thought that emerges from the Bible.&lt;ref name="jcpa.org"/&gt;

==Rabbinic Period==

=== The Sanhedrin ===
{{Main articles|Sanhedrin}}
In [[Judea (Roman province)|Roman Judea,]] Jewish communities were governed by rabbinical courts known as [[Sanhedrin]]. Lesser Sanhedrin composed of 23 judges were appointed to each city, while a Great Sanhedrin with 71 judges was the highest authority, taking cases appealed from the lower courts. The Sanhedrin served as the leadership of the Jewish community under [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule, and served as emissaries to the imperial authorities in addition to overseeing religious practice and collecting taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Jack N. Lightstone; Canadian Corporation for Studies in Religion (13 May 2002). [https://books.google.com/books?id=s42kv4NGBU4C&amp;pg=PA189 ''Mishnah and the social formation of the early Rabbinic Guild: a socio-rhetorical approach'']. Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press. p. 189. {{ISBN|978-0-88920-375-4}}. Retrieved 21 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sanhedrin was the highest Jewish governing body of the [[Second Temple period]], and the codification of the [[Mishnah]] by the [[Tannaim]] during this period laid the foundations for later [[Rabbinic Judaism]].

=== Talmudic sources on political philosophy ===
{{See also|Talmud}}
A statement by Rabbi Judah in the [[Babylonian Talmud]] (Sanhedrin 20b) depicts kingship as the ideal form of Jewish governance, following the [[Book of Deuteronomy]] statement that, "When you come into the land that the Lord your God is about to give you, and you take hold of it and dwell in it, and you say, 'Let me put a king over me like all the nations that are around me', you shall surely put over you a king whom the Lord your God chooses..." (Deut. 17:14-15).&lt;ref name="schechter.org.il"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20110821083739/http://www.schechter.org.il/iyounei_chabate.asp?id=238&lt;/ref&gt;

But the Talmud also brings a different interpretation of this verse from Rabbi Nehorai, who is quoted as explaining that, "This section was spoken only in anticipation of their future murmurings, as it is written, and you say, Let me put a king over me..." (Sanhedrin 20b). In many interpretations, Rabbi Nehorai does not think of appointing a king as a strict obligation, but as a concession to later "murmurings" from Israel.&lt;ref name="schechter.org.il"/&gt;

In addition to imagining ideal forms of governance, the rabbis accept a principle to obey the government currently in power. The Talmud makes reference to the principle of ''dina de-malkhuta dina'' ("the law of the land is law"), a principle recognizing non-Jewish laws and non-Jewish legal jurisdiction as binding on Jewish citizens, provided that they are not contrary to any laws of Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0005_0_05228.html Dina de-Malkhutah dina ''Jewish Virtual Library'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=t9QUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA146 ''The Jewish Law Annual 1978 p 146 Maimonedes on '''Din de-Malkhuta dina''' (The Law of the State is Law) '' Shmuel Shilo ''Senior Lecturer in Jewish Law. Hebrew University of Jerusalem'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval Period==
{{MoreInfo}}

=== The Qahal ===
{{Main articles|Qahal}}
An autonomous form Jewish government in the Middle Ages was known as the [[Qahal|Qahal{{Clarify|reason=Where and when were Qahal'im convened?|date=April 2018}}]] (more often spelled ''Kahal''), a form of government which many Jews saw as exemplifying Jewish principles. The kahal had regulatory control over Jewish communities in a given region; they administered commerce, hygiene, sanitation, charity, [[Jewish education]], ''[[kashrut]]'', and relations between landlords and their tenants. It provided a number of community facilities, such as a [[rabbi]], a [[mikveh|ritual bath]], and an [[gemach|interest-free loan facility for the Jewish community]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Louis Finkelstein]], ''Jewish Self-Government in the Middle Ages''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Caro]], ''[[Shulkhan 'Arukh]]'', ''[[Hoshen Mishpat]]'' chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; The kahal even had sufficient authority that it could arrange for individuals to be expelled from [[synagogue]]s, [[excommunication|excommunicating]] them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopedia of Ukraine]]'', (1989) volume 2, entry for ''Kahal''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval Jewish political philosophy ===
Some medieval political theorists such as [[Maimonides]] and [[Rabbeinu Nissim]] saw kingship as ideal. Maimonides' views the commandment in Deuteronomy to appoint a king as a clear positive ideal, following the Talmudic teaching that "three commandments were given to Israel when they entered the land: to appoint a king, as it says, 'You shall surely put over you a king'..."&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, ''Mishneh Torah'', "The Laws of Kings and their Wars" 1:1)&lt;/ref&gt; A large section of Maimonides' legal code, the [[Mishneh Torah]], titled "The Laws of Kings and their Wars", deals with the ideal model of kingship, especially in the messianic era, and also concerning ruling over non-Jewish subjects through the [[Noachide laws]]. Other sections of Maimonides' Mishneh Torah (mostly also in Sefer Shofetim, the book of Judges, where the laws of kingship are also found) is dedicated to the laws relating to legislators and judges.

Whereas Maimonides' idealized kingship, other medieval political theorists, such as [[Abravanel]], saw kingship as misguided. According to Abravanel, the commandment in Deuteroneomy to appoint a king is not a positive commandment at all. Rather, monarchy is a bad model, as "kingship is very harmful to the general public".&lt;ref name="schechter.org.il"/&gt; Later on, other Jewish philosophers such as [[Baruch Spinoza]] would lay the groundwork for [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]], arguing for ideas such as the [[separation of church and state]]. Spinoza's writings caused him to be [[Excommunication|excommunicated]]&lt;ref&gt;Nadler, Steven M. (2001). Spinoza's Heresy: Immortality and the Jewish Mind. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 120. {{ISBN|0-19-926887-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; from the Jewish community of [[Amsterdam]], although his work and legacy has been largely rehabilitated, especially amongst [[Secular Judaism|secular Jews]] in the 20th and 21st centuries&lt;ref&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10B1EFC3E54167A93C7AB178FD85F4D8285F9 &lt;nowiki&gt;"Einstein believes in "Spinoza's God"; Scientist Defines His Faith in Reply, to Cablegram From Rabbi Here. Sees a Divine Order But Says Its Ruler Is Not Concerned "Wit [sic] Fates and Actions of Human Beings.""&lt;/nowiki&gt;]. ''The New York Times''. 25 April 1929. Retrieved 8 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Modern Period==

{{MoreInfo}}

With [[Jewish Emancipation]], the institution of the Qahal as an autonomous entity was officially abolished. Jews increasingly became participants in the wider political and social sphere of larger nations. As Jews became citizens of states with various political systems, and argued about whether to [[Zionism|found their own state]], Jewish ideas of the relationship between Judaism and politics developed in many different directions.

===In Europe===

In the nineteenth century and early twentieth century, when there was a large Jewish population in Europe, some Jews favored various forms of [[liberalism]], and saw them as connected with Jewish principles. Some Jews allied themselves with a range of [[Jewish political movements]]. These included [[Socialism|Socialist]] and [[Bundism|labor]] movements favored by the [[Jewish left]], [[Zionist]] movements, [[Jewish Autonomist]] movements, [[Jewish Territorialist Organization|Territorialist]] movements, and [[Jewish Anarchism]] movements. [[Haredi]] Jews formed an organization known as [[World Agudath Israel]] which espoused Haredi Jewish political principles. 

==== 21st Century ====
In the 21st century, shifts are occurring. The Jewish community in Great Britain, one of the largest in the diaspora, is leaning conservative, as a poll published by the Jewish Chronicle in early 2015 shows. Of British Jews polled, 69% would vote for the Conservative Party, while 22% would vote for the Labour Party. This is in stark contrast to the rest of the voter population, which, according to a BBC poll, had Conservatives and Labor almost tied at about a third each. Jews have typically been a part of the British middle class, traditional home of the Conservative Party, though the number of Jews in working-class communities of London is in decline. The main voting bloc of poorer Jews in Britain now, made up primarily of ultra-Orthodox, votes "en masse" for the Conservatives. Attitudes toward [[Israel]] influence the vote of three out of four of British Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/133505/huge-majority-british-jews-will-vote-tory-jc-poll-reveals Huge majority of British Jews will vote Tory, JC poll reveals] The JC.com, 7 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.forward.com/forward-thinking/218262/how-ed-miliband-lost-britains-jewish-voters/ How Ed Miliband Lost Britain's Jewish Voters] The Jewish Daily Forward, 8 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; A shift toward conservatism has also been exhibited in France, where about half of the Jewish population is Sephardic. Jérôme Fourquet, director of the IFOP, the French polling organization, notes that there is a "pronounced preference" for right-wing politics among French Jews. During the 2007 election, Jews (Orthodox or not) represent the strongest pillar of support for Sarkozy after observant Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forward.com/articles/151738/french-jews-mostly-side-with-sarkozy/ French Jews Mostly Side With Sarkozy] The jewish Daily Forward, 22 february 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the United States===
{{List|section|date=November 2017}}
{{See also|Jews and politics in the United States}}

=== 19th Century ===

==== American Civil War ====
During the [[American Civil War]], Jews were divided in their views of [[slavery]] and [[Abolitionism|abolition]]. Prior to 1861, there were virtually no rabbinical sermons on slavery. The silence on this issue was probably a result of fear that the controversy would create conflict within the Jewish community. Some Jews owned slaves or traded them, and the livelihoods of many in the Jewish community of both the North and South were tied to the slave system. Most southern Jews supported slavery, and some, like Judah P. Benjamin, advocated its expansion. The abolitionist Ben Wade, who knew Benjamin in the U.S. Senate, described him as "an Israelite with Egyptian principles". Northern Jews sympathized with the South, and few were abolitionists, seeking peace and remaining silent on the subject of slavery. America's largest Jewish community, New York's Jews, were "overwhelmingly pro-southern, pro-slavery, and anti-Lincoln in the early years of the war". However, eventually, they began to lean politically toward "Father Abraham", his Republican party, and emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forward.com/articles/179441/jews-mostly-supported-slavery-or-kept-silent-d/?p=all Jews Mostly Supported Slavery — Or Kept Silent — During Civil War] The Jewish Daily Forward, 5 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th and 21st Centuries ===
While earlier Jewish immigrants tended to be politically conservative, the wave of Eastern European Jews starting in the early 1880s, were generally more liberal or left-wing, and became the political majority.&lt;ref name="Hasia Diner 2004"&gt;[[Hasia Diner]], ''The Jews of the United States. 1654 to 2000'' (2004), ch 5&lt;/ref&gt; For most of the 20th century since 1936, the vast majority of Jews in the United States have been aligned with the Democratic Party. Many religious supporters of the [[Jewish left]] have argued that left-wing values vis-à-vis [[social justice]] can be traced to [[Judaism|Jewish]] religious texts, including the [[Tanakh]] and later texts, which include a strong endorsement of hospitality to "the stranger" and the principle of [[Income redistribution|redistribution of wealth]] in the Biblical idea of [[Jubilee (Biblical)|Jubilee]] - as well as a tradition of challenging authority, as exemplified by the Biblical [[Prophet]]s.

American rabbinic leaders who have advanced a progressive political agenda grounded in Jewish principles have included:
*[[Michael Lerner (rabbi)]] of the [[Jewish Renewal]] movement
*[[Arthur Waskow]] of the [[Jewish Renewal]] movement
*[[Jill Jacobs (rabbi)|Jill Jacobs]] of [[Conservative Judaism]]
*[[David Saperstein (rabbi)|David Saperstein]] of [[Reform Judaism]]

Other prominent Jews who have argued based on Jewish principles for a progressive political agenda have included:
*[[Ruth Messinger]]

Towards the end of the 20th century, and at the beginning of the 21st century, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] launched initiatives to woo American Jews away from the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. While a solid majority of American Jews continues to be aligned with the Democratic Party, many have argued that there is increased Jewish support for political conservatism. (The "[[List of Jewish American politicians]]" illustrates the diversity of Jewish political thought and of the roles Jews have played in American politics.)

Rabbinic leaders who have advanced a conservative political agenda grounded in Jewish principles have included:
*[[Seymour Siegel]] of [[Conservative Judaism]]
*[[David Dalin]] of [[Conservative Judaism]]

Other prominent Jews who have argued based on Jewish principles for a conservative political agenda have included:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Friedman |first1=Murray |title=The Changing Jewish Political Profile |journal=American Jewish History |date=2003 |volume=91 |issue=3/4 |pages=423–438 |jstor=23887289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[David Klinghoffer]] 
*[[Dennis Prager]]
*[[Elliott Abrams]]

====Jewish political philosophy in North America====

Significant Jewish political philosophers in North America have included:
*[[David Novak]], a rabbi and philosopher at the [[University of Toronto]], associated with the [[Union for Traditional Judaism]]
*[[Alan Mittleman]], a rabbi and philosopher at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]] of [[Conservative Judaism]]
*[[Daniel Elazar]], a professor of [[political science]] at [[Bar-Ilan University]] and [[Temple University]]
*[[Michael Walzer]], a political theorist at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]
*[[Michael Sandel]], a political philosopher at [[Harvard University]]
*[[Robert Nozick]], a late political philosopher at [[Harvard University]]
*[[Murray Rothbard]], a late anarcho-capitalist philosopher and economist at the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]]
*[[Ronald Dworkin]], a philosopher of law and political philosopher at [[New York University]]

===In Israel===
{{Main|Religious Zionism}}
{{expand section|date=November 2010}}

The development of a political system in Israel drew largely on European models of governance, rather than on models from the Jewish political tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Elazar, [http://www.jcpa.org/dje/books/kincon-intro.htm The Jews' Rediscovery of the Political and its Implications], sees a "strong inclination toward centralized control of every aspect of public life brought from their European experiences by the state's molders and shapers".&lt;/ref&gt; Some political figures in Israel, however, have seen their principles as based in Judaism. This is especially pronounced in political parties that see themselves as religious parties, such as [[Shas]], [[United Torah Judaism]], and [[The Jewish Home]].

Recent interest in developing political theory grounded in Jewish sources has been spurred on by the activities of the neo-conservative [[Shalem Center]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/news/funded-by-u-s-neocons-think-tank-researchers-now-carving-israeli-policy-1.276236&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''justification of the state''' refers to the source of legitimate authority for the [[State (polity)|state]] or [[government]]. Typically, such a justification explains why the state should exist, and to some degree scopes the '''role of government''' - what a legitimate state should or should not be able to do.

There is no single, universally accepted justification of the state. In fact, [[anarchism|anarchists]] believe that there is no justification for the state at all, and that human societies would be better off without it. However, most political [[ideology|ideologies]] have their own justifications, and thus their own vision of what constitutes a legitimate state. Indeed, a person's opinions regarding the role of government often determine the rest of their political ideology. Thus, discrepancy of opinion in a wide array of political matters is often directly traceable back to a discrepancy of opinion in the justification for the state.

The [[constitution]]s of various countries codify views as to the purposes, powers, and forms of their governments, but they tend to do so in rather vague terms, which particular laws, courts, and actions of politicians subsequently flesh out. In general, various countries have translated vague talk about the purposes of their governments into particular state laws, bureaucracies, enforcement actions, etc.

The following are just a few examples.

== Transcendent sovereignty ==
In feudal [[Europe]] the most widespread justification of the state was the emerging idea of the [[divine right of kings]], which stated that monarchs draw their power from [[God]], and that the state should only be an apparatus that puts the monarch's will into practice. The legitimacy of the state's lands derived from the lands being the personal possession of the monarch. The divine-right theory, combined with [[primogeniture]], became a theory of [[hereditary monarchy]] in the [[nation state]]s of the [[early modern]] period.{{cn|date=November 2017}} The [[Holy Roman Empire]] was not a state in that{{which?|date=November 2017}} sense, and was not a true [[theocracy]], but rather a federal entity.

The political ideas current in [[China]] at that time involved the idea of the [[mandate of heaven]]. It resembled the theory of divine right in that it placed the ruler in a divine position, as the link between Heaven and Earth, but it differed from the divine right of kings in that it did not assume a permanent connection between a [[dynasty]] and the state. Inherent in the concept was that a ruler held the mandate of heaven only as long as he provided good government. If he did not, heaven would withdraw its mandate and whoever restored order would hold the new mandate. This is true theocracy;{{cn|date=November 2017}} the power and wisdom to govern is granted by a higher power, not by human political schemes, and can be equally removed by [[tian | heaven]]. This has similarities to the idea presented in the Judeo-Christian [[Bible]] from the time when Israel requests "a king like the nations" ({{bibleverse| 1 Samuel | 8:5 | KJV}}) through to Christ himself telling his contemporary [[leader]]s that they only had power because God gave it to them.{{cn|date=November 2017}} The classic Biblical example comes in the story of King [[Nebuchadnezzar II | Nebuchadnezzar]], who according to the [[Daniel 4 | Book of Daniel]] ruled the Babylonian empire because God ordained his power, but who later ate grass like a ox for seven years because he deified himself{{cn|date=November 2017}} instead of acknowledging God. Nebuchadnezzar is restored when he again acknowledges God as the true sovereign.

== Self-aggrandizement ==
In [[Renaissance Italy]], contemporary theoreticians saw the primary purpose of the less-overtly monarchical Italian city-states as civic glory.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== The social contract ==
In the period of the eighteenth century, usually called [[the Enlightenment]], a new justification of the European state developed. Jean-Jacques Rousseau's [[social contract theory]] states that governments draw their power from the governed, its 'sovereign' people (usually a certain ethnic group, and the state's limits are legitimated theoretically as that people's lands, although that is often not, rarely exactly, the case), that no person should have absolute power, and that a ''legitimate'' state is one which meets the needs and wishes of its citizens. These include security, peace, economic development and the resolution of conflict. Also, the social contract requires that an individual gives up some of his natural rights in order to maintain social order via the rule of law. Eventually, the divine right of kings fell out of favor and this idea ascended; it formed the basis for modern [[democracy]].

==Public goods==
This is an example of the theoretical thinking shifting the emphasis from faith and theoretical principles such as sovereignty to the socio-economic logic, as Karl Marx did.
Thus modern political theorists typically legitimize the state with two major ideas: redistribution and the provision of public goods. In ''The Limits of Government'', philosopher [[David Schmidtz]] takes on the second of these ideas.
While a market system may allow self-interested to create and allocate many goods optimally, there exists a class of "collective" - or "public goods" that are not produced adequately in a market system. These collective goods are goods that all individuals want but for whose production it is often not individually rational for people voluntarily to do their part to secure a collectively rational outcome. The state can step in and force us all to contribute toward the production of these goods, and we can all thereby be made better off. There are actually many different opinions when it comes to this topic.

==Political ideologies==
It is on those questions that one can find the differences between [[conservatism]], [[socialism]], [[liberalism]], [[libertarianism]], [[fascism]], especially the latter, and other political ideologies. There are also two ideologies - [[anarchism]] and [[communism]] - which argue that the existence of the state is ultimately unjustified and harmful. For this reason, the kind of society they aim to establish would be stateless.

Anarchism claims that the community of those fighting to create a new society must themselves constitute a [[stateless society]]. Communism wishes to immediately or eventually replace the communities, unities and divisions that things such as work, money, exchange, borders, nations, governments, police, religion, and race create with the universal community possible when these things are replaced.&lt;ref&gt;http://prole.info/wcpw.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[State socialism]] states that the degree to which a state is working class is the degree to which it fights government, class, work, and rule. The degree to which it wins such a fight is held to be the degree to which it is communist instead of capitalist, socialist, or the state. [[Anarcho-capitalism]] argues that taxes are theft, that government and the business community complicit in governance is [[organized crime]] and is equivalent to the criminal underworld, and that defense of life and property is just another industry, which must be privatized. [[Anarcho-communism]] and [[anarcho-collectivism]] says that taxes, being theft, are just property, which is also theft, and that the state is inherently capitalist and will never result in a transition to communism, and says that those fighting against capitalism and the state to produce a communist society must themselves already form such a community. However, the majority of viewpoints agree that the existence of ''some'' kind of government is morally justified. What they disagree about is the proper role and the proper form of that government.

There are several ways to conceive of the differences between these different political views. For example, one might ask ''in what areas'' should the government have jurisdiction, to ''what extent'' it may intervene in those areas, or even what constitutes ''intervention'' in the first place.  Some institutions can be said to exist only because the government provides the framework for their existence; for instance, [[Marxism|Marxists]] argue that the institution of [[property|private property]] only exists due to government.  The intervention debate can be framed in terms of [[big government]] versus [[small government]].

==Etymology==
The word is derived from two Greek words, ''kakistos'' ({{lang|grc|κάκιστος}}; worst) and ''kratos'' ({{lang|grc|κράτος}}; rule), with a literal meaning of government by the worst people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Evans|first1=Rod L|title=Thingamajigs and Whatchamacallits: Unfamiliar Terms for Familiar Things|date=2011|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9781101515921|page=87|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8hWqD8iG0n4C&amp;pg=PT87|accessdate=21 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguistic equivalents of the English word ''kakistocracy'' are as follows:  its Greek equivalent is ''kakistokratia'' ({{lang|grc|κακιστοκρατία}}), Catalan ''caquistocràcia'', Spanish ''kakistocracia'', French ''kakistocratie'', German ''Kakistokratie'', and Russian ''kakistokratiya'' ({{lang|ru|какистократия}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Charalambidis|first1=Michalis|title=Μια άλλη Ελλάδα μπορεί να ανοίξει τη συζήτηση για την Ευρώπη|url=http://www.tovima.gr/opinions/article/?aid=478892|accessdate=8 December 2016|work=Tovima|date=11 October 2012|language=el}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Froelich|first1=Thomas J.|title=Anàlisi no tan breu de l'estat actual de l'ètica de la informació: ètica de la ignorància, informació incompleta, falsa i falsejada i altres formes d'engany i incompetència|url=http://bid.ub.edu/39/froehlich.htm|accessdate=4 May 2018|language=ca, en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dimopoulos|first1=Carlos|title=La kakistocracia: El gobierno de los peores - El Impulso|url=http://www.elimpulso.com/apartado-de-lectores/la-kakistocracia-el-gobierno-de-los-peores|accessdate=21 November 2016|work=El Impulso|date=10 August 2013|language=es-es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lavoie|first1=Gilbert|title=» La coalition de Legault restera "caquiste"|url=http://blogues.lapresse.ca/gilbertlavoie/2011/11/01/la-coalition-de-legault-restera-%C2%ABcaquiste%C2%BB/|accessdate=21 November 2016|work=Blogues de La Presse|date=1 November 2011|language=fr-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Какистократия переходного периода|url=http://politikan.com.ua/2/12/0/17150.htm|accessdate=21 November 2016|work=Politikan|date=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The earliest use of the word dates to the seventeenth century, in Paul Gosnold's ''A sermon Preached at the Publique Fast the ninth day of Aug. 1644 at St. Maries:''&lt;ref name="mw2962017"/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Therefore we need not make any scruple of praying against such: against those Sanctimonious Incendiaries, who have fetched fire from heaven to set their Country in combustion, have pretended Religion to raise and maintaine a most wicked rebellion: against those Nero's, who have ripped up the wombe of the mother that bare them, and wounded the breasts that gave them sucke: against those Cannibal's who feed upon the flesh and are drunke with the bloud of their own brethren: against those Catiline's who seeke their private ends in the publicke disturbance, and have set the Kingdome on fire to rost their owne egges: against those tempests of the State, those restlesse spirits who can no longer live, then be stickling and medling; who are stung with a perpetuall itch of changing and innovating, transforming our old Hierarchy into a new Presbytery, and this againe into a newer Independency; and our well-temperd Monarchy into a mad kinde of Kakistocracy. Good Lord!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gosnold|first1=Paul|title=A sermon preached at the publique fast the ninth day of Aug. 1644 at St. Maries, Oxford, before the honorable members of the two Houses of Parliament there assembled by Paul Gosnold ... ; and published by authority. |url=http://tei.it.ox.ac.uk/tcp/Texts-HTML/free/A41/A41582.html|publisher=University of Oxford Text Archive|accessdate=22 August 2017|language=en|date=1644}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

English author [[Thomas Love Peacock]] later used the term in his 1829 novel ''[[The Misfortunes of Elphin]]'', in which he explains kakistocracy represents the opposite of [[aristocracy]], as  ''aristos'' (ἄριστος) means "excellent" in Greek.&lt;ref name="dict"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kakistocracy|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/kakistocracy|publisher=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1838 ''Memoir on Slavery'' (which he supported), U.S. Senator [[William Harper (South Carolina)|William Harper]] compared kakistocracy to [[anarchy]], and said it had seldom occurred:&lt;ref name="harper"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harper|first1=William|title=Memoir on Slavery: Read Before the Society for the Advancement of Learning, of South Carolina, at its annual meeting at Columbia, 1837|date=1838|publisher=J. S. Burges|page=49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-hZWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA49|accessdate=27 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Anarchy is not so much the absence of government as the government of the worst—not aristocracy but kakistocracy—a state of things, which to the honor of our nature, has seldom obtained amongst men, and which perhaps was only fully exemplified during the worst times of the [[French revolution]], when that horrid hell burnt with its most horrid flame. In such a state of things, to be accused is to be condemned—to protect the innocent is to be guilty; and what perhaps is the worst effect, even men of better nature, to whom their own deeds are abhorrent, are goaded by terror to be forward and emulous in deeds of guilt and violence.}}

American poet [[James Russell Lowell]] used the term in 1876, in a letter to [[Joel Benton]], writing, "What fills me with doubt and dismay is the degradation of the moral tone. Is it or is it not a result of Democracy? Is ours a 'government of the people by the people for the people,' or a Kakistocracy rather, for the benefit of knaves at the cost of fools?"&lt;ref name="fiske" /&gt;

==Usage==
{{Forms of government}}
Use of the word was rare in the early part of the 20th century, but it regained popularity in 1981 with criticism of the [[Reagan administration]]. Since then it has been employed to negatively describe various governments around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Let's dump this kakistocracy for good |url=http://www.iol.co.za/sundayindependent/lets-dump-this-kakistocracy-for-good-2084926|accessdate=21 November 2016|work=Sunday Independent|date=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was frequently used by conservative commentator [[Glenn Beck]] to describe the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ali|first=Amro|title=Kakistocracy: a word we need to revive|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/arab-awakening/amro-ali/kakistocracy-word-we-need-to-revive|accessdate=21 November 2016|work=openDemocracy|date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word returned to use during the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 U.S. presidential campaign]], particularly by opponents and critics of Republican presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cay Johnston|first1=David|title=Kakistocracy|url=http://www.nationalmemo.com/kakistocracy/|accessdate=21 November 2016|work=[[The National Memo]]|date=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, academic and blogger Amro Ali{{who|date=May 2018}} argued that kakistocracy was a word that needed to be revived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ali|first1=Amro|title=Kakistocracy: A word we need to revive|url=http://amroali.com/2016/05/kakistocracy-rule-by-the-stupid-unqualified/|website=amroali.com|date=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' would later credit Ali's blog post with initiating a wider conversation on the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2016/12/17/degeneration-nation-it-takes-a-village-of-idiots-to-raise-a-kakistocracy-like-donald-trumps/|title=Degeneration nation: It takes a village of idiots to raise a kakistocracy like Donald Trump’s|last=McClennen|first=Sophia A.|website=Salon|access-date=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, Dan Leger of the [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] newspaper ''[[The Chronicle Herald]]'' suggested that a Trump victory in the U.S. presidential election would require renewed use of the term "kakistocracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leger|first1=Dan|title=LEGER: Trump’s America would be a 'kakistocracy, ruled by most corrupt or incompetent|url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/opinion/1390469-leger-trump%E2%80%99s-america-would-be-a-%E2%80%98kakistocracy%E2%80%99-ruled-by-most-corrupt-or-incompetent|work=[[The Chronicle Herald]]|date=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kyklos''' ({{lang-grc |κύκλος}}, {{IPA-el|kýklos|IPA}}, "cycle")  is a term used by some classical [[Ancient Greece| Greek]] authors to describe what they saw as the political cycle of [[government]]s in a society. It was roughly based on the history of Greek [[city-states]] in the same period. The concept of "The Kyklos" is first elaborated in [[Republic (dialogue)|Plato's ''Republic'']], chapters VIII and IX. [[Polybius]] calls it the ''anakyklosis'' or "[[anacyclosis]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.votefamily.us/understanding-the-cycles-of-governments/|title=Understanding the cycles of governments - Let's Defend Our Families!|work=Let's Defend Our Families!|access-date=2017-05-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Polybius, who has the most fully developed version of the cycle, it rotates through the three basic forms of government, [[democracy]], [[aristocracy]], and [[monarchy]] and the three degenerate forms of each of these governments [[ochlocracy]], [[oligarchy]], and [[tyranny]].  Originally society is in ochlocracy but the strongest figure emerges and sets up a monarchy.  The monarch's descendants, who because of their family's power lack virtue, become [[Despotism| despots]] and the monarchy degenerates into a tyranny.  Because of the excesses of the ruler the tyranny is overthrown by the leading citizens of the state who set up an aristocracy. They too quickly forget about virtue and the state becomes an oligarchy. These oligarchs are overthrown by the people who set up a democracy.  Democracy soon becomes corrupt and degenerates into ochlocracy, beginning the cycle anew.

[[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] have somewhat different beliefs.  Plato only sees five forms of government.  Aristotle believes the cycle begins with monarchy and ends in anarchy, but that it does not start anew.  He also refers to democracy as the degenerate form of rule by the many and calls the virtuous form ''[[politeia]]'', which is often translated as constitutional democracy. Cicero describes anacyclosis in his philosophical work ''[[De re publica]]''.

[[Machiavelli]], writing during the [[Renaissance]], appears to have adopted Polybius' version of the cycle.  Machiavelli's adoption of [[anacyclosis]] can be seen in Book I, Chapter II of his ''[[Discourses on Livy]]''.

All the philosophers believed that this cycling was harmful.  The transitions would often be accompanied by violence and turmoil, and a good part of the cycle would be spent with the degenerate forms of government.  Aristotle gave a number of options as to how the cycle could be halted or slowed:
*Even the most minor changes to basic laws and constitutions must be opposed because over time the small changes will add up to a complete transformation.  
*In aristocracies and democracies the tenure of rulers must be kept very short to prevent them from becoming despots
*External threats, real or imagined, preserve internal peace
*The three government basic systems can be blended into one, taking the best elements of each
*If any one individual gains too much power, be it political, monetary, or military he should be [[banishment|banished]] from the polis
*[[Judge]]s and [[magistrate]]s must never accept money to make decisions
*The [[middle class]] must be large
*Most important to Aristotle in preserving a constitution is [[education]]: if all the citizens are aware of law, history, and the constitution they will endeavour to maintain a good government.

Polybius, by contrast, focuses on the idea of [[mixed government]].  The idea that the ideal government is one that blends elements of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy.  Aristotle mentions this notion but pays little attention to it.  To Polybius it is the most important and he saw the [[Roman Republic]] as the embodiment of this mixed constitution and that this explained its stability.

'''Legal plunder''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fee.org/the_freeman/detail/frdric-bastiat-on-legal-plunder|author=David Hart|title=Frédéric Bastiat on Legal Plunder|accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the act of appropriating, under the laws, the property of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fee.org/the_freeman/detail/frdric-bastiat-on-legal-plunder|author=David Hart|title=Frédéric Bastiat on Legal Plunder|accessdate=2014-04-30|quote=the State (which he often wrote as THE STATE) is a vast machine that is purposely designed to take the property of some people without their consent and to transfer it to other people.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was coined by [[Frédéric Bastiat]], most famously in his 1850 book [[The Law (book)|''The Law'']]. It has since become a concept in [[libertarianism|libertarian thought]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/legal-plunder Legal Plunder]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfif.org/v/index.php/commentary/61/3057-legal-plunder Legal Plunder]&lt;/ref&gt;, and has been used similarly by others, including [[Daniel Lord Smail]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674737280 Legal Plunder: Households and Debt Collection in Late Medieval Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today it is the appropriation of the assets of another person by power groups through rules of public law that violate the principle of equality and the Constitution.

Throughout history there are many examples of legal [[plunder]] as the political and economic regimes that have followed: partial legal plunder are the result of tyranny and protectionism or universal legal plunder the result of socialism or communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/sites/default/files/thelaw.pdf|author=Frédéric Bastiat|title=The law|accessdate=2015-03-29|quote=p. 15 - Partial plunder. This is the system that prevailed so long as the elective privilege was partial; a system that is resorted to, to avoid the invasion of socialism. Universal plunder. We have been threatened by this system when the elective privilege has become universal; the masses having conceived the idea of making law, on the principle of legislators who had preceded them.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the thought of Frédéric Bastiat==
Frédéric Bastiat thought that the law can only implement the individual rights: personality, liberty, and property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/sites/default/files/thelaw.pdf|author=Frédéric Bastiat|title=The law|accessdate=2015-03-29|quote=p. 2 - If every man has the right of defending, even by force, his person, his liberty, and his property, a number of men have the right to combine together to extend, to organize a common force to provide regularly for this defense}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So, if the law goes against the person, liberty, property, it becomes perverse as it goes against the rights that should be protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/sites/default/files/thelaw.pdf|author=Frédéric Bastiat|title=The law|accessdate=2015-03-29|quote=p. 3 - For who will dare to say that force has been given to us, not to defend our rights, but to annihilate the equal rights of our brethren? And if this be not true of every individual force, acting independently, how can it be true of the collective force, which is only the organized union of isolated forces?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For him ''The law is the organization of the natural right of lawful defense''.

So he prefers a government that intervenes as little as possible in the sphere of people, liberty, and property.

Every citizen is therefore responsible for his fortune or his failures.

Frédéric Bastiat to defend his idea of what should be the purpose of the law, has set a specific definition of "''legal plunder''".

First he defines "''extra-legal plunder''" "such as theft, or swindling, which is defined, foreseen, and punished by the penal code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/sites/default/files/thelaw.pdf|author=Frédéric Bastiat|title=The law|accessdate=2015-03-29|quote=p. 13 - As to extralegal plunder, such as theft, or swindling, which is defined, foreseen, and punished by the penal code, I do not think it can be adorned by the name of socialism. It is not this that systematically threatens the foundations of society.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In that case, "magistracy, police, gendarmerie, prisons, dungeons, and scaffolds" are the instrument of the State used against the plunderer and to defend the plundered party.

Legal plunder is when the law "''takes from some persons that which belongs to them, to give to others what does not belong to them.''"

Examples of legal plunder include protectionist tariffs, redistributive taxation, crony capitalism, welfare, etc., which Bastiat terms (only two years after the publication of the Communist Manifesto, and before it was a firm political science term of art), "socialism:"
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Now, legal plunder may be exercised in an infinite multitude of ways. Hence come an infinite multitude of plans for organization; tariffs, protection, perquisites, gratuities, encouragements, progressive taxation, free public education, right to work, right to profit, right to wages, right to assistance, right to instruments of labor, gratuity of credit, etc., etc. And it is all these plans, taken as a whole, with what they have in common, legal plunder, that takes the name of socialism.

Now socialism, thus defined, and forming a doctrinal body, what other war would you make against it than a war of doctrine? You find this doctrine false, absurd, abominable. Refute it. This will be all the easier, the more false, absurd, and abominable it is. Above all, if you wish to be strong, begin by rooting out of your legislation every particle of socialism which may have crept into it—and this will be no light work.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/sites/default/files/thelaw.pdf|author=Frédéric Bastiat|title=The law|accessdate=2018-07-09|quote=p. 14-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In that case, "magistracy, police, gendarmerie, prisons, dungeons, and scaffolds" are the instrument of the State to defend the plunderer and treat the plundered party that tries to defend his property as a criminal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2962">A '''legislative calendar''' is used by legislatures to plan their business during the [[legislative session]]. 

== Calendar ==
Typically, one of the first items mentioned on the calendar is passing the bill enacting procedures and deadlines for the session. Time may also be allotted for considering the [[Government budget|budget bill]], which is usually the major item of business in a session. The calendar may provide scheduled committee hearings and generally includes many important deadlines. 

For instance, California has a fiscal deadline, which is the date on the legislative calendar by which all bills with fiscal effect must have been taken up in a policy Committee and referred to a fiscal Committee; any fiscal bill missing the deadline is considered "dead" unless it receives a rule waiver allowing further consideration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislature.ca.gov/quicklinks/glossary.html California State Legislature—Glossary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some legislatures have a "crossover day," which is the point in the session after which each house only considers legislation sent to it by the other house. In the U.S. Congress, the phrase "placed on calendar" accompanies a bill that is pending before committees of either house; the bill is assigned a calendar number, which determines when it will be considered by that house.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpoaccess.gov/bills/glossary.html Congressional Bills: Glossary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312025413/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/bills/glossary.html |date=2008-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a legislative calendar, a "legislative day" is a day on which the Legislature actually meets. The Virginia General Assembly has six legislative days per week (Monday through Saturday), probably reflecting the desire to have a [[citizen legislature]] that accomplishes its business in a relatively short, intense annual session, after which the members return to their full-time employment. The Oklahoma legislature, by contrast, has four legislative days per week.

The daily version of the legislative calendar is sometimes called the daily file, agenda or calendar, which lists all the bills that will be considered on a given day. 

The term "legislative calendar" can also refer to the final published compilation of the action on each instrument during a legislative session.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legis.state.la.us/glossary.htm Louisiana State Legislature&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225075018/http://www.legis.state.la.us/glossary.htm |date=2007-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also refer to a list of legislation available to be heard by the Legislature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oksenate.gov/legislation/glossary.html Oklahoma State Senate - Legislation: Glossary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4476">[[Image:Gedimin grav xvii.jpg|thumb|Gediminas, Grand Duke of Lithuania]]

There are 6 surviving transcripts of '''letters of Gediminas''' written in 1323–1324 by Grand Duke [[Gediminas]]. These letters are one of the first surviving documents from the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. Since they were sent to the Western Europe, the pope, merchants, and craftspeople, they were written in [[Latin]].

The first letter was written to [[Pope John XXII]]. Gediminas claimed that the [[Teutonic Knights]] did not act in the interest of the Catholic faith. Instead, they brutally devastated the land. The people were forced into resistance. Gediminas enumerated many crimes and damages done by the knights; for example, he claimed that his predecessor [[Vytenis]] sent a letter to the [[Franciscan]] monks asking for two brothers who could come to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to look after a local church. When the Teutonic Knights learned about the letter, they sent their army and destroyed the church. In the last sentence Gediminas vaguely promised to accept Christianity and obey the pope.

The second letter was written on January 25, 1323 to the German cities of [[Lübeck]], [[Sund, Sweden|Sund]], [[Bremen]], [[Magdeburg]], [[Cologne]] and other cities in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Gediminas explained that the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was very tolerant to the Christians, but remained pagan and did not accept Christianity only because of brutal Teutonic Knights. He told about the first letter sent to the pope and his intentions to baptize in the Catholic rite. Gediminas invited knights, [[squire]]s, merchants, doctors, smiths, wheelwrights, [[shoemaking|cobbler]]s, [[Skinner (profession)|skinners]], millers, and others to come to the Grand Duchy and practice their trade and faith without any restrictions. The peasants were promised tax exemption for ten years. The merchants were also exempt from any tariffs or taxes. This letter is best known because [[Vilnius]], capital of Lithuania, was mentioned in written sources for the first time. Therefore, 1323 is considered to be the official founding year of Vilnius. Gediminas is considered to be the city's founder even though the city existed years before Gediminas' reign. Also, Vilnius is unambiguously mentioned as the capital city. His invitation notably included German Jews as well as Christians, and its issuance is closely linked to the establishment of the [[Litvaks|Jewish community in Lithuania]].

The third letter addressed to Lübeck, [[Rostock]], Sund, [[Greifswald]], [[Stetin]], [[Gotland]] cities was written on May 26, 1323. In essence it repeated the second letter. It asked for various craftspeople (the list of crafts was expanded) to come to Lithuania and practice their trade. It said that there were three churches in the duchy: two Franciscan (in Vilnius and in [[Navahradak]]) and one [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]. Everyone was free to use them.

The fourth and the fifth letters were also written on May 26, 1323 and were addressed to the Franciscan and Dominican Orders. Gediminas, in anticipation of his baptism, invited priests and monks to come to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. He also asked to spread the word to craftspeople that they were welcome in Lithuania. In the letter to the Dominicans, Gediminas mentioned that his seal was burned by the Teutonic Knights.

The last surviving letter was written on September 22, 1324 and was addressed to the bishop of [[Tartu]], Erzel, ruler of [[Tallinn]] land, and Council of [[Riga]]. It reported that the Teutonic Knights violated a peace treaty signed earlier. The Knights attacked border regions, killed residents, and took all valuables. Many messengers were captured and killed. Gediminas asked for help enforcing the treaty.

{{Marxism|Philosophy}}

'''Marxist philosophy'''  or  '''Marxist theory''' are works in [[philosophy]] that are strongly influenced by [[Karl Marx]]'s [[Historical materialism|materialist]] approach to [[theory]], or works written by [[Marxist]]s. Marxist philosophy may be broadly divided into [[Western Marxism]], which drew out of various sources, and the official [[philosophy in the Soviet Union]], which enforced a rigid reading of Marx called [[dialectical materialism]], in particular during the 1930s.
Marxist philosophy is not a strictly defined sub-field of philosophy, because the diverse influence of Marxist theory has extended into fields as varied as [[aesthetics]], [[ethics]], [[ontology]], [[epistemology]], [[theoretical psychology]] and [[philosophy of science]], as well as its obvious influence on [[political philosophy]] and the [[philosophy of history]]. The key characteristics of Marxism in philosophy are its materialism and its commitment to political practice as the end goal of all thought.

Marxist theorist [[Louis Althusser]], for example, defined philosophy as "[[class struggle]] in theory", thus radically separating himself from those who claimed philosophers could adopt a "[[God's eye view]]" as a purely neutral judge.

==Marxism and philosophy==
The philosopher [[Étienne Balibar]] wrote in 1996 that "there is no Marxist philosophy and there never will be; on the other hand, Marx is more important for philosophy than ever before."&lt;ref&gt;[[Étienne Balibar]], 1993. ''La philosophie de Marx'', [[La Découverte]], Repères (English edition, ''The Philosophy of Marx''. Verso, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; So even the existence of Marxist philosophy is debatable (the answer may depend on what is meant by "philosophy," a complicated question in itself). Balibar's remark is intended to explain the significance of the final line of [[Karl Marx|Karl Marx's]] 11 ''[[Theses on Feuerbach]]'' (1845), which can be read as an epitaph for philosophy: "The philosophers have only ''interpreted'' the world, in various ways; the point is to ''change'' it".

If this claim (which Marx originally intended as a criticism of [[German Idealism]] and the more moderate [[Young Hegelian]]s) is still more or less the case in the 21st century, as many [[Marxist]]s {{Who|date=May 2011}} would claim, then Marxist theory is in fact the practical continuation of the philosophical tradition, while much of philosophy is still politically irrelevant. Many critics{{Who|date=May 2011}}, both philosophers outside Marxism and some Marxist philosophers, feel that this is too quick a dismissal of the post-Marxian philosophical tradition.

Much sophisticated and important thought has taken place after the writing of Marx and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]]; much or perhaps even all of it has been influenced, subtly or overtly, by Marxism. Simply dismissing all philosophy as sophistry might condemn Marxism to a simplistic [[empiricism]] or [[economism]], crippling it in practice and making it comically simplistic at the level of theory.

Nonetheless, the force of Marx's opposition to [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegelian]] [[idealism]] and to any "philosophy" divorced from [[politics|political]] practice remains powerful even to a contemporary reader. Marxist and Marx-influenced 20th century theory, such as (to name a few random examples) the [[Critical theory (Frankfurt School)|critical theory of the Frankfurt School]], the political writing of [[Antonio Gramsci]], and the [[neo-Marxism]] of [[Fredric Jameson]], must take Marx's condemnation of philosophy into account, but many such thinkers also feel a strong need to remedy the perceived theoretical problems with [[orthodox Marxism]].

Such problems might include a too-simple [[economic determinism]], an untenable theory of [[ideology]] as "[[false consciousness]]," or a simplistic model of state power rather than [[hegemony]]. So Marxist philosophy must continue to take account of advances in the theory of politics developed after Marx, but it must also be wary of a descent into [[theoreticism]] or the temptations of [[idealism]].

Étienne Balibar claimed that if one philosopher could be called a "Marxist philosopher", that one would doubtlessly be [[Louis Althusser]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Althusser proposed a 'new definition' of philosophy as "class struggle in theory"... marxism had proper signification (and original "problematic") ''only'' insofar as it was the theory of ''the'' tendency towards communism, and ''in view'' of its realization. The criteria of acceptation or rejectal of a 'marxist' proposition was always the same, whether it was presented as 'epistemological' or as 'philosophical': it was in the act of rendering intelligible a ''communist policy'', or not." (''Ecrits pour Althusser'', 1991, p.98). &lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, "Althusser never ceased to put in question the ''images of communism'' that Marxist theory and ideology carried on: but he did it in the name of communism itself." Althusser thus criticized the [[Sociocultural evolution|evolutionist]] image which made of communism an ultimate stage of history, as well as the apocalyptic images which made it a "society of transparence", "without contradiction" nor ideology. Balibar observes that, in the end, Althusser enjoined the most sober definition of communism, exposed by Marx in ''[[The German Ideology]]'': ''Communism is "not a state of the future, but the real movement which destroys the existing state of being.".''

== The Philosophy of Marx ==
[[File:G.W.F. Hegel (by Sichling, after Sebbers).jpg|thumb|200px|[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] was an important figure in the development of Marxism.]]

There are endless interpretations of the "philosophy of Marx", from the interior of the Marxist movement as well as in its exterior. Although some have separated Marx's works between a "[[young Marx]]" (in particular the ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]'') and a "mature Marx" or also by separating it into purely philosophical works, economics works and political and historical interventions, Étienne Balibar (1993) has pointed out that Marx's works can be divided into "economic works" (''[[Das Kapital]]'', 1867), "philosophical works" and "historical works" (''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte]]'', the 1871 ''[[The Civil War in France|Civil War in France]]'' which concerned the [[Paris Commune]] and acclaimed it as the first "[[dictatorship of the proletariat]]", etc.)

Marx's philosophy is thus inextricably linked to his [[critique of political economy]] and to his historical interventions in the [[workers' movement]], such as the 1875 ''[[Critique of the Gotha Program]]'' or ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', written with Engels (who was observing the [[Chartist movement]]) a year before the [[Revolutions of 1848]]. Both after the defeat of the French socialist movement during [[French coup of 1851|Louis Napoleon Bonaparte's 1851 coup]] and then after the crushing of the 1871 Paris Commune, Marx's thought transformed itself.

Marxism's philosophical roots were thus commonly explained as derived from three sources: English [[political economy]], French [[republicanism]] and [[Radicalization|radicalism]], and German idealist philosophy. Although this "three sources" model is an oversimplification, it still has some measure of truth.

On the other hand, [[Costanzo Preve]] (1990) has assigned four "masters" to Marx: [[Epicurus]] (to whom he dedicated his thesis, ''Difference of natural philosophy between [[Democritus]] and Epicurus'', 1841) for his materialism and theory of [[clinamen]] which opened up a realm of [[liberty]]; [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], from which come his idea of [[egalitarian]] [[democracy]]; [[Adam Smith]], from whom came the idea that the grounds of [[property]] is [[Manual labour|labour]]; and finally [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].

"Vulgar Marxism" (or codified [[dialectical materialism]]) was seen as little other than a variety of [[economic determinism]], with the alleged determination of the [[ideology|ideological]] [[base and superstructure|superstructure]] by the economical [[infrastructure]]. This [[positivism|positivist]] reading, which mostly based itself on Engels' latter writings in an attempt to theorize "[[scientific socialism]]" (an expression coined by Engels) has been challenged by Marxist theorists, such as Lukacs, Gramsci, Althusser or, more recently, Étienne Balibar.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

=== Hegel ===
{{See also|Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel}}
Marx developed a comprehensive, theoretical understanding of political reality early in his intellectual and activist career by means of a critical adoption and radicalization of the categories of 18th and 19th century German Idealist thought.  Of particular importance is Hegel's appropriation of Aristotle's organicist and essentialist categories in the light of Kant's transcendental turn.&lt;ref name="Meikle"&gt;Meikle, ''Essentialism in the Thought of Karl Marx'', Open Court Publishing Company (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}}

Marx builds on four contributions Hegel makes to our philosophical understanding.  They are: (1) the replacement of mechanism and atomism with Aristotelean categories of organicism and essentialism, (2) the idea that world history progresses through stages, (3) the difference between natural and historical (dialectical) change, and (4) the idea that dialectical change proceeds through contradictions in the thing itself.

'''(1) Aristotelian Organicism and Essentialism'''

(a) Hegel adopts the position that chance is not the basis of phenomena and that events are governed by laws.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|31}}  Some have falsely attributed to Hegel the position that phenomena are governed by transcendent, supersensible ideas that ground them.  On the contrary, Hegel argues for the organic unity between universal and particular.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|31}}  Particulars are not mere token types of universals; rather, they relate to each other as a part relates to a whole.  This latter has import for Marx's own conception of law and necessity.

(b) In rejecting the idea that laws merely describe or independently ground phenomena, Hegel revives the Aristotlean position that law or principle is something implicit in a thing, a potentiality which is not actual but which is in the process of becoming actual.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|31}} This means that if we want to know the principle governing something, we have to observe its typical life-process and figure out its characteristic behavior.  Observing an acorn on its own, we can never deduce that it is an oak tree.  To figure out what the acorn is - and also what the oak tree is - we have to observe the line of development from one to the other.

(c) The phenomena of history arise from a whole with an essence which undergoes transformation of form and which has an end or telos.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|32}} For Hegel, the essence of humanity is freedom, and the telos of that essence is the actualization of that freedom.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|32}} Like Aristotle, Hegel believes the essence of a thing is revealed in the entire, typical process of development of that thing.  Looked at purely formally, human society has a natural line of development in accordance with its essence just like any other living thing.  This process of development appears as a succession of stages of world history.

'''(2) The Stages of World History'''

Human history passes through several stages, in each of which is materialized a higher level of human consciousness of freedom.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|32}} Each stage also has its own principle or law according to which it develops and lives in accordance with this freedom.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|32}} Yet the law is not free-standing.  It is delivered by means of the actions of men which spring from their needs, passions, and interests.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|32}} Teleology, according to Hegel, is not opposed to the efficient causation provided by passion; on the contrary, the latter is the vehicle realizing the former.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|32}} Hegel consistently lays more stress on passion than on the more historically specifiable interests of men.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|32}} Marx will reverse this priority.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|32}}

'''(3) The Difference Between Natural and Historical Change'''

Hegel distinguishes as Aristotle did not between the application of organic, essentialist categories to the realm of human history and the realm of organic nature.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|33}} According to Hegel, human history strives toward perfectibility, but nature does not.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|34}} Marx deepens and expands this idea into the claim that humankind itself can adapt society to its own purposes rather than adapting themselves to it.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|34}}

Natural and historical change, according to Hegel, have two different kinds of essences.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|34}} Organic natural entities develop through a straightforward process, relatively simple to comprehend at least in outline.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|34}} Historical development, however, is a more complex process.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|35}} Its specific difference is its "dialectical" character.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|35}} The process of natural development occurs in a relatively straight line from the germ to the fully realized being and back to the germ again.  Some accident from the outside might come along to interrupt this process of development, but if left to its own devices, it proceeds in a relatively straightforward manner.

Society's historical development is internally more complex.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|35}} The transaction from potentiality to actuality is mediated by consciousness and will.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|35}} The essence realized in the development of human society is freedom, but freedom is precisely that ability to negate the smooth line of development and go off in novel, hitherto unforeseen directions.  As humankind's essence reveals itself, that revelation is at the same time the subversion of itself.  Spirit is constantly at war with itself.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|35}} This appears as the contradictions constituting the essence of Spirit.

'''(4) Contradiction'''

In the development of a natural thing, there is by and large no contradiction between the process of development and the way that development must appear.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|36}} So the transition from an acorn, to an oak, to an acorn again occurs in a relatively uninterrupted flow of the acorn back to itself again.  When change in the essence takes place, as it does in the process of evolution, we can understand the change mostly in mechanical terms using principles of genetics and natural selection.

The historical process, however, never attempts to preserve an essence in the first place.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|36}} Rather, it develops an essence through successive forms.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|36}} This means that at any moment on the path of historical change, there is a contradiction between what exists and what is in the process of coming-to-be.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|36}} The realization of a natural thing like a tree is a process that by and large points back toward itself: every step of the process takes place in order to reproduce the genus.  In the historical process, however, what exists, what is actual, is imperfect.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|37}} It is inimical to the potential.  What is trying to come into existence - freedom - inherently negates everything preceding it and everything existing, since no actual existing human institution can possibly embody pure human freedom.  So the actual is both itself and its opposite (as potential).&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|37}} And this potential (freedom) is never inert but constantly exerts an impulse toward change.&lt;ref name="Meikle"/&gt;{{rp|37}}

=== The rupture with German Idealism and the Young Hegelians ===
{{Main|German Idealism|Young Hegelians}}
Marx did not study directly with Hegel, but after Hegel died Marx studied under one of Hegel's pupils, [[Bruno Bauer]], a leader of the circle of Young Hegelians to whom Marx attached himself. However, Marx and Engels came to disagree with Bruno Bauer and the rest of the Young Hegelians about socialism and also about the usage of Hegel's dialectic. Having achieved his thesis on the ''Difference of natural philosophy between [[Democritus]] and [[Epicurus]]'' in 1841, the young Marx progressively broke away with the [[Prussia]]n [[university]] and its teachings impregnated by German Idealism ([[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] and Hegel).

Along with Engels, who observed the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], he cut away with the environment in which he grew up and encountered the [[proletariat]] in France and Germany. He then wrote a scathing criticism of the Young Hegelians in two books, ''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]'' (1845), and ''The German Ideology'' (1845), in which he criticized not only Bauer but also [[Max Stirner]]'s ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'' (1844), considered as one of the founding book of [[individualist anarchism]]. Max Stirner claimed that all ideals were inherently [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienating]], and that replacing God with Humanity, as did [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] in ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' (1841), was not sufficient. According to Stirner, any ideals, God, Humanity, the [[nationalism|Nation]], or even the [[Revolution]] alienated the "Ego". Marx also criticized [[Proudhon]], who had become famous with his cry "[[Property is theft!]]", in ''[[The Poverty of Philosophy]]'' (1845).

Marx's early writings are thus a response towards Hegel, German Idealism and a break with the rest of the Young Hegelians. Marx, "stood Hegel on his head," in his own view of his role, by turning the idealistic dialectic into a materialistic one, in proposing that material circumstances shape ideas, instead of the other way around. In this, Marx was following the lead of Feuerbach. His [[Marx's theory of alienation|theory of alienation]], developed in the ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]'' (published in 1932), inspired itself from Feuerbach's critique of the alienation of Man in God through the [[objectivation]] of all his inherent characteristics (thus man projected on God all qualities which are in fact man's own quality which defines the "[[human nature]]").

But Marx also criticized Feuerbach for being insufficiently materialistic, as Stirner himself had pointed out, and explained that the alienation described by the Young Hegelians was in fact the result of the structure of the economy itself. Furthermore, he [[Marx's theory of human nature|criticized Feuerbach's conception of human nature]] in his sixth thesis on Feuerbach as an abstract "kind" which incarnated itself in each singular individual: "Feuerbach resolves the essence of [[religion]] into the essence of man (''menschliche Wesen'', human nature). But the essence of man is no abstraction inherent in each single individual. In reality, it is the ensemble of the social relations."

Thereupon, instead of founding itself on the singular, concrete individual [[subject (philosophy)|subject]], as did classic philosophy, including [[contractualism]] ([[Hobbes]], [[John Locke]] and [[Rousseau]]) but also [[political economy]], Marx began with the totality of social relations: labour, language and all which constitute our human existence. He claimed that [[individualism]] was the result of [[commodity fetishism]] or alienation. Some critics have claimed that meant that Marx enforced a strict [[social determinism]] which destroyed the possibility of [[free will]].

==== Criticisms of the "human rights" ====
In the same way, following [[Gracchus Babeuf|Babeuf]], considered as one of the founder of communism during the [[French Revolution]], he criticized the 1789 ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'' as a "bourgeois declaration" of the rights of the "egoistic individual", ultimately based on the "right to private property", which [[economism]] deduced from its own implicit "philosophy of the subject", which asserts the preeminence of an individual and [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]] subject over social relations. On the other hand, Marx also criticized [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]]'s [[utilitarianism]].

Alongside [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], and [[Emile Durkheim|Durkheim]], Marx thus takes a place amongst the 19th century philosophers who criticized this pre-eminence of the subject and its [[consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/durkheim/ ; See section on "The Individual and Society."&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Marx saw [[consciousness as political]]. According to Marx, the recognition of these individual rights was the result of the universal extension of market relations to all of society and to all of the world, first through the [[primitive accumulation of capital]] (including the first period of European [[colonialism]]) and then through the [[globalization]] of the capitalist sphere. Such individual rights were the symmetric of the "right for the labourer" to "freely" sell his [[labor force]] on the marketplace through juridical contracts, and worked in the same time as an ideological means to discompose the collective grouping of producers required by the [[Industrial Revolution]]: thus, in the same time that the Industrial Era requires masses to concentrate themselves in [[factory|factories]] and in [[urbanization|cities]], the individualist, "bourgeois" ideology separated themselves as competing [[homo economicus]].

Marx's critique of the ideology of the human rights thus departs from the [[counterrevolutionary]] critique by [[Edmund Burke]], who dismissed the "rights of Man" in favour of the "rights of the individual": it is not grounded on an opposition to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]'s [[Universality (philosophy)|universalism]] and [[humanism|humanist]] project on behalf of the right of [[tradition]], as in Burke's case, but rather on the claim that the ideology of economism and the ideology of the human rights are the reverse sides of the same coin. However, as Étienne Balibar  puts it, "the accent put on those contradictions can not not ring out on the signification of 'human rights', since these therefore appears ''both'' as the language in which [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] masks itself and as the one in which the exploited class struggle express itself: more than a truth or an illusion, it is therefore a ''stake''".&lt;ref&gt;[[Étienne Balibar]], ''The Philosophy of Marx'', 1993, p.74 original edition&lt;/ref&gt; ''Das Kapital'' ironizes on the "pompous catalogue of the human rights" in comparison to the "modest ''Magna Charta'' of a day work limited by law":
{{quote|The creation of a normal working-day is, therefore, the product of a protracted civil war, more or less dissembled, between the capitalist class and the working-class... It must be acknowledged that our labourer comes out of the process of production other than he entered. In the market he stood as owner of the commodity "labour-power" face to face with other owners of commodities, dealer against dealer. The contract by which he sold to the capitalist his labour-power proved, so to say, in black and white that he disposed of himself freely. The bargain concluded, it is discovered that he was no "free agent," that the time for which he is free to sell his labour-power is the time for which he is forced to sell it, that in fact the vampire will not lose its hold on him "so long as there is a muscle, a nerve, a drop of blood to be exploited." For "protection" against "the serpent of their agonies," the labourers must put their heads together, and, as a class, compel the passing of a law, an all-powerful social barrier that shall prevent the very workers from selling, by voluntary contract with capital, themselves and their families into slavery and death. In place of the pompous catalogue of the "inalienable rights of man" comes the modest Magna Charta of a legally limited working-day, which shall make clear "when the time which the worker sells is ended, and when his own begins.'' Quantum mutatus ab illo!''[How changed from what he/it was!]"&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''Das Kapital, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch10.htm#S7 chapter X, section 7]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
But the communist revolution does not end with the negation of individual liberty and equality ("[[collectivism]]"&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Dumont (anthropologist)|Louis Dumont]] argued that Marx represented exacerbated [[individualism]] instead of [[holism]] as the popular interpretation of Marxism as "collectivism" would have it&lt;/ref&gt;), but with the "negation of the negation": "individual property" in the capitalist regime is in fact the "expropriation of the immediate producers." "Self-earned private property, that is based, so to say, on the fusing together of the isolated, independent laboring-individual with the conditions of his labor, is supplanted by capitalistic private property, which rests on exploitation of the nominally free labor of others, i.e., on wage-labor... The capitalist mode of appropriation, the result of the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]], produces capitalist private property. This is the first negation of individual private property, as founded on the labor of the proprietor. But capitalist production begets, with the inexorability of a law of Nature, its own negation. It is the negation of negation. This does not re-establish private property for the producer, but gives him individual property based on the acquisition of the capitalist era: i.e., on co-operation and the possession in common of the land and of the means of production.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''Das Kapital'', [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch32.htm chapter XXXII, section 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Criticisms of Feuerbach ====
{{Main|Ludwig Feuerbach|Marx's theory of alienation}}
What distinguished Marx from Feuerbach was his view of Feuerbach's [[humanism]] as excessively abstract, and so no less ahistorical and idealist than what it purported to replace, namely the reified notion of God found in institutional Christianity that legitimized the repressive power of the Prussian state. Instead, Marx aspired to give [[ontological]] priority to what he called the "real life process" of real human beings, as he and Engels said in ''The German Ideology'' (1846):

&lt;blockquote&gt;In direct contrast to German philosophy, which descends from heaven to earth, here we ascend from earth to heaven. That is to say, we do not set out from what men say, imagine, conceive, nor from men as narrated, thought of, imagined, conceived, in order to arrive at men in the flesh. We set out from real, active men, and on the basis of their real life process we demonstrate the development of the ideological reflexes and echoes of this life process. The phantoms formed in the human brain are also, necessarily, sublimates of their material life process, which is empirically verifiable and bound to material premises. Morality, religion, metaphysics, all the rest of ideology and their corresponding forms of consciousness, thus no longer retain the semblance of independence. They have no history, no development; but men, developing their material production and their material intercourse, alter, along with this, their real existence, their thinking, and the products of their thinking. Life is not determined by consciousness, but consciousness by life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also, in his ''[[Theses on Feuerbach]]'' (1845), in which the young Marx broke with Feuerbach's idealism, he writes that "the philosophers have only described the world, in various ways, the point is to change it," and his materialist approach allows for and empowers such change. This opposition between various subjective interpretations given by philosophers, which may be, in a sense, compared with ''[[Weltanschauung]]'' designed to legitimize the current state of affairs, and effective transformation of the world through ''[[praxis (process)|praxis]]'', which combines theory and practice in a materialist way, is what distinguish "Marxist philosophers" with the rest of philosophers.

Indeed, Marx's break with German Idealism involves a new definition of philosophy; Louis Althusser, founder of "[[Structural Marxism]]" in the 1960s, would define it as "[[class struggle]] in theory". Marx's movement away from university philosophy and towards the [[workers' movement]] is thus inextricably linked to his rupture with his earlier writings, which pushed Marxist commentators to speak of a "young Marx" and a "mature Marx", although the nature of this cut poses problems.

A year before the [[Revolutions of 1848]], Marx and Engels thus wrote ''The Communist Manifesto'', which was prepared to an imminent revolution, and ended with the famous cry: "[[Workers of the world, unite!|Proletarians of all countries, unite!]]". However, Marx's thought changed again following [[Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s [[French coup of December 1851|December 2, 1851 coup]], which put an end to the [[French Second Republic]] and created the [[French Second Empire|Second Empire]] which would last until the 1870 [[Franco-Prussian War]].

Marx thereby modified his theory of alienation exposed in the ''Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844'' and would later arrive to his theory of [[commodity fetishism]], exposed in the first chapter of the first book of ''Das Kapital'' (1867). This abandonment of the early theory of alienation would be amply discussed, and several Marxist theorists, including [[Marxist humanist]]s such as the [[Praxis School]], would return to it. Others, such as Althusser, would claim that the "[[Louis Althusser#The 'Epistemological Break'|epistemological break]]" between the "young Marx" and the "mature Marx" was such that no comparisons could be done between both works, marking a shift to a "scientific theory" of society.

In 1844-5, when Marx was starting to settle his account with Hegel and the Young Hegelians in his writings, he critiqued the Young Hegelians for limiting the horizon of their critique to religion and not taking up the critique of the state and civil society as paramount. Indeed, in 1844, by the look of Marx's writings in that period (most famous of which is the "[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]", a text that most explicitly elaborated his [[Marx's theory of alienation|theory of alienation]]), Marx's thinking could have taken at least three possible courses: the study of law, religion, and the state; the study of natural philosophy; and the study of [[political economy]].

He chose the last as the predominant focus of his studies for the rest of his life, largely on account of his previous experience as the editor of the newspaper ''[[Rheinische Zeitung]]'' on whose pages he fought for freedom of expression against Prussian censorship and made a rather idealist, legal defense for the Moselle peasants' customary [[commons|right of collecting wood]] in the forest (this right was at the point of being criminalized and privatized by the state). It was Marx's inability to penetrate beneath the legal and polemical surface of the latter issue to its materialist, economic, and social roots that prompted him to critically study political economy.

==== Historical materialism ====
{{Main|Historical materialism|Dialectical materialism}}
Marx summarized the materialistic aspect of his theory of history, otherwise known as [[historical materialism]] (this term was coined by Engels and popularised by [[Karl Kautsky]] and [[Georgi Plekhanov]]), in the 1859 preface to ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the social production of their existence, men inevitably enter into definite relations, which are independent of their will, namely [[relations of production]] appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material [[forces of production]]. The totality of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which arises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness. The [[mode of production]] of material life conditions the general process of social, political and intellectual life. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but their social existence that determines their consciousness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this brief popularization of his ideas, Marx emphasized that social development sprang from the inherent contradictions within material life and the social [[base and superstructure|superstructure]]. This notion is often understood as a simple historical narrative: primitive communism had developed into slave states. Slave states had developed into feudal societies. Those societies in turn became capitalist states, and those states would be overthrown by the self-conscious portion of their working-class, or proletariat, creating the conditions for socialism and, ultimately, a higher form of communism than that with which the whole process began. Marx illustrated his ideas most prominently by the development of capitalism from [[feudalism]], and by the prediction of the development of socialism from [[capitalism]].

The base-superstructure and [[stadial history|stadialist]] formulations in the 1859 preface took on canonical status in the subsequent development of orthodox Marxism, in particular in [[dialectical materialism]] (''diamat'', as it was [[philosophy in the Soviet Union|known in the Soviet Union]]). They also gave way to a vulgar Marxism as plain [[economic determinism]] (or [[economism]]), which has been criticized by various [[Marxist theorists]]. "Vulgar Marxism" was seen as little other than a variety of [[economic determinism]], with the alleged determination of the [[ideology|ideological]] [[base and superstructure|superstructure]] by the economical [[infrastructure]]. However, this [[positivism|positivist]] reading, which mostly based itself on Engels' latter writings in an attempt to theorize "[[scientific socialism]]" (an expression coined by Engels) has been challenged by Marxist theorists, such as Antonio Gramsci or Althusser.

Some believe that Marx regarded them merely as a shorthand summary of his huge ongoing work-in-progress (which was only published posthumously over a hundred years later as ''[[Grundrisse]]''). These sprawling, voluminous notebooks that Marx put together for his research on political economy, particularly those materials associated with the study of "primitive communism" and pre-capitalist communal production, in fact, show a more radical turning "Hegel on his head" than heretofore acknowledged by most mainstream Marxists and Marxiologists.

In lieu of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] belief in historical progress and stages espoused by [[Hegel]] (often in a [[racism|racist]], [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] manner, as in his ''Lectures on the Philosophy of History''), Marx pursues in these research notes a decidedly empirical approach to analyzing historical changes and different modes of production, emphasizing without forcing them into a [[teleology|teleological]] paradigm the rich varieties of communal productions throughout the world and the critical importance of collective working-class antagonism in the development of capitalism.

Moreover, Marx's rejection of the necessity of bourgeois revolution and appreciation of the [[obschina]], the communal land system, in Russia in his letter to [[Vera Zasulich]]; respect for the egalitarian culture of North African Muslim commoners found in his letters from [[Algeria]]; and sympathetic and searching investigation of the global commons and indigenous cultures and practices in his notebooks, including the ''Ethnological Notebooks'' that he kept during his last years, all point to a historical Marx who was continuously developing his ideas until his deathbed and does not fit into any pre-existing ideological straitjacket.

==Differences within Marxist philosophy==
Some varieties of Marxist philosophy are strongly influenced by  Hegel, emphasizing totality and even [[teleology]]: for example, the work of [[Georg Lukács]], whose influence extends to contemporary thinkers like [[Fredric Jameson]]. Others consider "totality" merely another version of Hegel's "spirit," and thus condemn it as a crippling, secret idealism.

[[Theodor Adorno]], a leading philosopher of the [[Frankfurt School]], who was strongly influenced by Hegel, tried to take a middle path between these extremes: Adorno contradicted Hegel's motto "the true is the whole" with his new version, "the whole is the false," but he wished to preserve [[critical theory]] as a negative, oppositional version of the utopia described by Hegel's "spirit."  Adorno believed in totality and human potential as ends to be striven for, but not as certainties.

The status of [[humanism]] in Marxist thought has been quite contentious. Many Marxists, especially Hegelian Marxists and also those committed to political programs (such as many [[Communist Party|Communist]] Parties), have been strongly humanist. These humanist Marxists believe that Marxism describes the true potential of human beings, and that this potential can be fulfilled in collective freedom after the Communist revolution has removed capitalism's constraints and subjugations of humanity. A particular version of the humanism within the marxism is represented by the school of [[Lev Vygotsky]] and his school in [[theoretical psychology]] ([[Alexis Leontiev]], [[Laszlo Garai]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.staff.u-szeged.hu/~garai/Interview%20with%20Laszlo%20Garai.htm Interview with Laszlo Garai on the Activity Theory of Alexis Leontiev and his own Theory of Social Identity as referred to the meta-theory of Lev Vygotsky. Journal of Russian and East European Psychology, vol. 50, no. 1, January–February 2012, pp. 50–64]&lt;/ref&gt;). The [[Praxis school]] based its theory on the writings of the young Marx, emphasizing the humanist and dialectical aspects thereof.

However, other Marxists, especially those influenced by Louis Althusser, are just as strongly [[anti-humanist]]. Anti-humanist Marxists believe that ideas like "humanity," "freedom," and "human potential" are pure ideology, or theoretical versions of the bourgeois economic order. They feel that such concepts can only condemn Marxism to theoretical self-contradictions which may also hurt it politically.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6237">'''Maternalism''' is the viewpoint that incorporates a common idea of [[femininity]] and applies it as a support for women’s involvement in society.

==History==
Maternalism emerged in the late 19th Century, as a companion to [[progressive reform]]. The [[theology]] followed the idea that women had in-born qualities based on their maternalistic instincts. These inborn qualities qualified women to operate outside the home. Women of this time argued that women were uniquely qualified for certain jobs and places in the [[political sphere]] based on their domestic abilities and child-rearing qualities.
This political mindset continued into the 20th century, influencing government reform and females in the [[workplace]].&lt;ref name="Muncy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Muncy|first1=Robyn|title=Creating a Female Dominion in Reform, 1890-1935|date=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780195089240}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mink"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mink|first1=Gwendolyn|title=The wages of motherhood : inequality in the welfare state, 1917-1942|date=1996|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY|isbn=978-0801495342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maternalistic professionals, particularly medical doctors, do not dictate to people what to do. They guide their clients gently and give them autonomy without making them feel totally alone or unsupported. Maternalistic people allow people to make decisions, even if they end up being mistakes in the long run.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/elizabeth-horn/maternalism-in-medicine_b_6566736.html Maternalism in Medicine] at Huffington Post&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

===Progressive reform===
[[Social settlement]]s, founded mainly by middle class women, became popular in urban environments in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries. They provided [[public housing]] and resources to working-class people and newly arrived [[immigrant]]s. Middle class women who ran these settlements worked with immigrants for progressive reform, such as the regulation of [[workers' compensation]] and [[child labor]] laws. Major settlements included [[Hull House]] in Chicago and [[Toynbee Hall]] in New York City.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=2016|chapter=Social settlement|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/social-settlement|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Female Professions===
Acceptable female work during this time included school teachers and nursing. In 1910,
5%-6% of Doctors were female;
1% of Lawyers were female;
1% of Clergy were female.
Women achieved greater success in creating female oriented jobs than breaking into male dominated jobs during this time, by creating professions designed around their domestic and maternal qualities.&lt;ref name="Muncy"/&gt; [[Home Economics]] emerged in the 1890s at MIT and the University of Chicago. Women studied science and used experiments to influence politics. Female-led labs studied ways to create cleaner water and better American sewers.
[[Public Health Nursing]] was created as an alternative to traditional nursing. This allowed women to have their own private practices and to not have to work under men. However, most women served communities who couldn’t pay, which limited their resources and income. [[Social work]] primarily operated in social settlements, serving immigrant women and children. Since many of their clients could not pay, social workers were key players in pushing for progressive reform.&lt;ref name="Muncy"/&gt;

==Major Players==
[[Ellen Swallow Richards]] was a chemist who graduated from Uc Madera in california and founded Home Economics. Richards set up labs at Universities across the country aimed at sanitation and teaching women the sciences. Richards was a key player in maternalist politics as she applied her scientific knowledge to domestic issues in politics, pushing for good nutrition and sanitation.&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ellen H. Swallow Richards|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/ellen-h-swallow-richards|website=Science History Institute |accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lugenia Burns Hope]] was one of the first professional social workers. In 1908 in Atlanta Georgia she founded the Neighborhood Union, which aimed to mobilize and enfranchise poor black neighborhoods in the city.&lt;ref name="Cardoza-Oquendo"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cardoza-Oquendo|first1=Juan|title=Lugenia Burns Hope|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/lugenia-burns-hope-1871-1947|website=New Georgia Encyclopedia|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jane Addams]] co-founded Hull House in Chicago in 1889.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; A strong proponent for maternalist politics and progressive reform, she started many initiatives such as clean food and clean drinking water, which gained momentum in the social movement.&lt;ref name="Muncy"/&gt;

==Critique==
Maternalism has been criticized on the grounds that it keeps women out of male dominated professions.  It also reinforces a normalized idea of femininity, without considering the fluidity of gender.&lt;ref name="Larsen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Larsen|first1=Eirinn|title=Gender and the welfare state: Maternalism - a new historical concept?|date=1996|publisher=University of Bergen, Norway|url=http://www.ub.uib.no/elpub/1996/h/506002/eirinn/eirinn.html|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same way that advertisers had used images of strong working women to encourage women to enter the workforce in support of the war effort, advertisers after the war presented images of maternalism to pressure women to leave the workforce and return to their homes, so that positions could be filled by men returning from wartime. Women were told that their nurturing abilities would be better served waiting on their husbands and children.&lt;ref name="Weigand"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weigand|first1=Kate|title=Red feminism : American communism and the making of women's liberation|date=2002|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, Md. ; London|isbn=978-0801871115|pages=46–47|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2S-a6fBuNsEC&amp;pg=PA46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19377">{{History of Greece}}
The '''National Schism''' ({{lang-el|Εθνικός Διχασμός}}, ''Ethnikos Dikhasmos'', sometimes called '''The Great Division''') was a series of disagreements between [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I]] and [[Prime Minister]] [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] regarding the foreign policy of [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] in the period of 1910–1922 of which the tipping point was whether Greece should enter [[World War I]]. Venizelos was in support of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and wanted Greece to join the war on their side, while the pro-[[German Empire|German]] King wanted Greece to remain neutral, which would favor the plans of the [[Central Powers]].

The disagreement had wider implications, since it would also affect the character and role of the king in the state. The dismissal of Venizelos by the King resulted in a deep personal rift between the two and in subsequent events their followers divided into two radically opposed political camps affecting the wider Greek society.

With the contrary actions of Venizelos permitting the landing of Allied forces in [[Thessaloniki]] and the unconditional surrender of a military fort in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] to German-Bulgarian forces by the king, the disagreements of the two men started to take the form of [[civil war]]. In August 1916, followers of Venizelos set up a provisional state in Northern Greece, with Entente support, with the aim of reclaiming the lost regions in Macedonia, effectively splitting Greece into two entities. After intense diplomatic negotiations and [[Noemvriana|an armed confrontation]] in [[Athens]] between Allied and royalist forces the king abdicated on 11 June 1917, and his second son [[Alexander of Greece|Alexander]] took his place.

Venizelos returned to Athens on 29 May 1917 and Greece, now unified, officially [[Greece in World War I|joined the war]] on the side of the Allies, emerging victorious and securing new territory by the [[Treaty of Sèvres]]. The bitter effects of this division were the main features of Greek political life until the 1940s, and contributed to Greece's defeat in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Greco-Turkish War]], the collapse of the [[Second Hellenic Republic]] and the establishment of the dictatorial [[Metaxas Regime]].

==Source of the conflict==
{{Details |Goudi coup}}

The main cause of the conflict was the dispute between Venizelos and King Constantine over power in Greece, in which the development of true representation had been slow since the creation of the state. Up till the 1870s and the King's acceptance of the principle that the leader of the [[majority party]] in Parliament should be given the mandate to form a government, the formation of political groupings around a leader who could govern if this pleased the King meant that the supposedly [[parliamentary government]] was actually at the monarch's discretion.{{Sfn | Koliopoulos | 2002 | p = 53}}

Many reformists and liberals viewed meddling by the monarchy in politics as deleterious. The negative public attitude towards the monarchy was strengthened by the defeat of the Greek army, headed by Constantine (then the [[Crown Prince]]), in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War of 1897]]. Many of these hopes for reform were also shared by young officers in the [[Hellenic Army]], who felt humiliated by the defeat, and who were influenced by [[republicanism]].

A "[[Military League]]" was formed, and on 15 August 1909, they issued a [[pronunciamiento]] at the Goudi barracks in Athens. The movement, which demanded reforms in government and military affairs, was widely supported by the public; [[King George I of Greece|King George]] was forced to give in to the military's demands. He appointed [[Kyriakoulis Mavromichalis]] as Prime Minister and accepted the dismissal of the Princes from the military.

However, it soon became apparent that the leadership of the League was not able to govern the country, and they looked for an experienced political leader, who would also preferably be anti-monarchist and not tainted by the "old-partyism" of the old system. The officers found such a man in the person of [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], a prominent [[Crete|Cretan]] politician, whose clashes with [[Prince George of Greece|Prince George]], the island's [[regent]], seemed to confirm his anti-monarchist and republican credentials.

With Venizelos' arrival, the League was sidelined, and the energetic and relatively young politician soon dominated Greek political life. His government carried out a large number of overdue reforms, including the creation of a revised [[Greek Constitution of 1911|constitution]]. However, he also established a close relationship with the King, resisted calls to transform the revisionary assembly into a constitutional one, and even reinstated the Princes in their positions in the army, with Crown Prince Constantine as its Inspector-General.

===Balkan Wars (1912–13)===
{{Further |Balkan Wars|Greece in the Balkan Wars}}
With the outbreak of the [[Balkan Wars]], Constantine was immediately appointed again as [[commander-in-chief]], and the successes of the army in the field, especially in the [[Second Balkan War]] against the [[Bulgaria]]ns, helped many forget his record in 1897. Constantine, now king, was being hailed as "laurel-crowned" and "Bulgar-slayer". It was however during this war that the first tension between Constantine and Venizelos surfaced, in a dispute over the army's course following the victory at [[Battle of Sarantaporo|Sarantaporo]]. Constantine wanted to march due north, towards [[Monastir, Macedonia|Monastir]], while Venizelos was anxious that the army should turn east, towards the strategically important city and harbor of [[Thessaloniki]].

The anxiety of Venizelos was doubled by the fact that the Bulgarians had also set their eyes on the city, the most important in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], and were sending their own troops towards it. Eventually Venizelos prevailed, and the Greeks captured the city only a few hours before the arrival of the Bulgarians. This episode was not publicised at the time, and in the aftermath of the Wars, the two men, King and Prime Minister, both wildly popular, were seen as making up a formidable partnership at the helm of the Greek state.

==Beginning of the conflict==
[[File:Constantineiofgreece.jpg|right|thumb|180px|King Constantine I in German Field Marshal's uniform. He judged that Greece's interests were best served by remaining neutral in the First World War.]]

As the [[World War I|Great War]] began, the Greek authorities had to choose between [[Neutral country|neutrality]] and aligning themselves with the [[Triple Entente|Allied forces]]. Outright participation in the war on the side of the [[Central Powers]] was not an option, both because of Greece's vulnerability to the [[Royal Navy]] and because, from early on (October 1914), Greece's traditional enemy, the [[Ottoman Empire]], had joined in on Germany's side. Hence, neutrality was the course favored by most pro-German Greeks, including the senior, German-educated, leadership of the General Staff, who had great influence over the King.

King Constantine's German affiliations were exaggerated in the Entente's propaganda during the war. It is true that [[Sophia of Prussia|Queen Sofia]] was the sister of the German [[Kaiser]], [[William II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], and Constantine himself had been educated in Germany and admired German culture. On the other hand he was descended on his father's side from the Glucksbergs of Denmark and on his mother's side from the Romanovs of Russia, spoke perfect English, was a frequent visitor to England and had relatives there. 

Greece had an ongoing mutual defense pact with [[Serbia]], a member of the [[Triple Entente|Allied forces]], who were asking for support after they were invaded by [[Austria-Hungary]] (see [[Serbian Campaign (World War I)]]).
However, Constantine believed it was in the greater interests of Greece to remain neutral. His considerable military experience and knowledge made him especially conscious of the threat to Greece from Bulgaria's powerful military in the event that the Hellenic Army was engaged in a war with Austria-Hungary. The Prime Minister, Venizelos, was strongly in favor of joining the Entente, as he believed that Greece would gain new lands and fulfill the [[Megali Idea]].

In January 1915, in an attempt to convince the Greeks to side with them, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] offered Greece post-war concessions in [[Asia Minor]] (currently part of Turkey). Venizelos felt this was very much in Greece's interests and attempted to force a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] through the Greek parliament to join the Allies. He also adivsed King Constantine to convene the [[Crown Council of Greece|Crown Council]], which he did. It met twice, on [[Crown Council of Greece meeting of 18 February 1915|February 18]] and on [[Crown Council of Greece meeing of 20 February 1915|February 20]]. In these meetings, Venizelos presented his case for joining the Entente, a course of action which was opposed by opposition leader Theotokis, but Rallis supported. Staunch opposition by the King, Army generals (including the General Staff and [[Ioannis Metaxas]]) and their supporters, forced Venizelos to resign shortly afterwards (on March, 6).

==The clash and schism of Greece==

[[File:Ελευθέριος Βενιζέλος.jpg|thumb|left|Eleftherios Venizelos, the Greek Prime Minister, believed that Greece's interests were best served by entering the war on the side of the Allies.]]
The resignation caused political dissension in Greece, a diplomatic battle between the King and Venizelos' supporters forced a [[Greek legislative election, May 1915|general election in June 1915]]. These elections were won by Venizelos' [[Liberal Party (Greece)|Liberal Party]] and he resumed his post as Prime Minister, however Constantine refused to ratify the appointment of the new government until August.

During this time the [[Serbia]]n-[[Bulgaria]]n conflict deepened until Bulgaria declared war on Serbia, which posed an immediate threat to the newly gained province of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], including the strategically important port of [[Thessaloniki]].
Venizelos asked Constantine for permission to formalize a defense treaty with Serbia in the interests of protecting the Greek border from direct Bulgarian attack. Constantine agreed but only on the condition that Greece was actually attacked. After his inability to sway Constantine to act against Bulgaria, Venizelos took a new route by allowing [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] and French troops to land in Thessaloniki, Macedonia in aid of Serbia, after their failed operation at [[Gallipoli]]. This caused disarray in the Greek government and Venizelos took advantage of this by forcing through a parliamentary motion (with a 37-vote margin) to declare war on Bulgaria.

The invitation to the Allies by Venizelos enraged the King. The dispute between the Greek Prime Minister and the King reached its height shortly after and the King invoked the Greek [[constitution]]al right that gave the monarch the right to dismiss a government. In December 1915 Constantine forced Venizelos to resign for a second time and dissolved the Liberal-dominated parliament, calling a [[Greek legislative election, December 1915|new election]]. Venizelos left [[Athens]] and moved back to his native [[Crete]].

The Liberals boycotted this second election, which undermined the new [[Monarchism|Royalist]] government's position, as it was seen as a government directly appointed by the King, disregarding popular opinion. The tension between the two parties grew gradually over the course of the following year with both sides taking a more radical and divisive approach to the situation. Public opinion was not nearly as clearly divided during this period. When French and British forces landed in [[Thessaloniki]] (as invited by Venizelos earlier) against Constantine's wishes the Greek people supported the King's view that the Allies had violated the country's sovereignty. However, later on, when the [[Central Powers]] took control of eastern Macedonia in May 1916, the public took similar outrage at the King's inability to defend Greek territory.

[[File:French troops in Athens, 1916.png|thumb|French troops in Athens, with the Acropolis in the background, after the ''Noemvriana''.]]

August 30, 1916, saw a [[coup]] against the Royalist government by ''[[Movement of National Defence|Ethniki Amyna]]'' (Εθνική Άμυνα, ''National Defence''), a secret pro-Venizelist military organization based in Thessaloniki. The coup succeeded to the extent that a second provisional government of Greece was formed by the group in Thessaloniki. With the backing of the Entente, Venizelos returned to the Greek mainland from [[Crete]] to lead the new provisional government at the head of a [[triumvirate]]. He declared: "we are not against the King, but against the Bulgarians". Towards the end of 1916 France and Britain, after failing to persuade the royalist government to enter the war too, officially recognized the ''Ethniki Amyna'' government as the lawful government of Greece.

In retaliation against ''Ethniki Amyna'' a royalist [[paramilitary]] unit called the "Reservists" (Επίστρατοι) was formed. Led by Colonel [[Ioannis Metaxas]] (one of Constantine's closest aides and a future dictator of Greece) the group targeted Venizelist people in [[Athens]] and nearby areas, culminating in the ''[[Noemvriana]]'', the "November events", which were ignited by an armed confrontation between Greek reservists and French marines.

Ιn retaliation, the Venizelos National Defence Government and the Entente instituted a naval blockade, seized the royalist fleet and demanded the partial disarmament of the royalist forces and their withdrawal to the [[Peloponnese]]. 

The monarchists blamed Venizelos for having the idea of the blockade. It lasted 106 days in total, during which time no goods were allowed to enter or leave royalist-controlled ports that were under the control of the Athens government. This was to set a precedent for much of the future conflict in Greece.

==Greece joins the war==
{{Details |Macedonian front}}

The Venizelist-Entente blockade eventually succeeded in its aim. In June 1917, after threats to bombard Athens if the King remained, Constantine left Greece leaving the Crown to his second son [[Alexander of Greece|Alexander]]. Venizelos took control of the government and pledged Greek support to the Entente. In July the country officially declared war on the Central Powers. During the remaining 18 months of the war 10 divisions of the Greek army fought alongside the [[Triple Entente|Allied forces]] against Bulgarian and German forces in Macedonia and Bulgaria. During the conflict Greek forces participated in many victorious battles losing approximately 5,000 troops.

==Consequences==

The act of entering the war and the preceding events resulted in a deep political and social division in post-World War I Greece. The country's foremost political formations, the Venizelist Liberals and the Royalists, already involved in a long and bitter rivalry over pre-war politics, reached a state of outright hatred towards each other. Both parties viewed the other's actions during the [[World War I|First World War]] as politically illegitimate and treasonous.

This enmity inevitably spread throughout Greek society, creating a deep rift that contributed decisively to the [[Asia Minor Disaster]] and resulted in continued political and military unrest in the interwar years during the troubled [[Second Hellenic Republic]]. The National Schism was also one of the principal causes that led to the collapse of the Republic and the institution of the dictatorial [[4th of August Regime]] in 1936.

The division between Royalists and Venizelists even came to the United States and elsewhere with the Greek immigrants of that generation: immigrants favouring the two political camps would settle in nearby but carefully separated communities in American cities, often centred on competing Greek Orthodox parishes. In some cases, the animosity and mistrust between such parishes has survived into the 21st century, long after the original political disagreement was forgotten.

'''Political science''' is a [[social science]] which deals with systems of governance, and the analysis of [[politics|political]] activities, political thoughts, and political behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/political-science%20Oxford%20Dictionary:%20political%20science Oxford Dictionary: political science]{{dead link|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It deals extensively with the theory and practice of politics which is commonly thought of as determining of the distribution of [[Power (social and political)|power]] and resources. Political scientists "see themselves engaged in revealing the relationships underlying political events and conditions, and from these revelations they attempt to construct general principles about the way the world of politics works."&lt;ref&gt;[http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/political-science/ Political Science]. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (22 February 1999). Retrieved on 27 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political science -- occasionally called politicology -- comprises numerous subfields, including [[comparative politics]], [[political economy]], [[international relations]], [[political theory]], [[public administration]], [[public policy]], and [[political methodology]].  Furthermore, political science is related to, and draws upon, the fields of [[economics]], [[Legal education|law]], [[sociology]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[geography]], [[psychology]]/[[psychiatry]], and [[anthropology]].

Comparative politics is the science of comparison and teaching of different types of [[constitutions]], political actors, legislature and associated fields, all of them from an intrastate perspective. [[International relations]] deals with the interaction between [[nation-state]]s as well as intergovernmental and transnational organizations. Political theory is more concerned with contributions of various classical and contemporary thinkers and philosophers.

Political science is methodologically diverse and appropriates many methods originating in [[social research]]. Approaches include [[positivism]], [[Verstehen|interpretivism]], [[rational choice theory]], [[behaviouralism]], [[structuralism]], [[post-structuralism]], [[Philosophical realism|realism]], [[Historical institutionalism|institutionalism]], and pluralism. Political science, as one of the [[social science]]s, uses methods and techniques that relate to the kinds of inquiries sought: primary sources such as historical documents and official records, secondary sources such as scholarly journal articles, [[sample survey|survey]] research, [[Statistics|statistical analysis]], [[case studies]], experimental research, and model building.

==Overview==
Political scientists study matters concerning the allocation and transfer of [[Power (social and political)|power]] in [[decision making]], the roles and systems of governance including [[governments]] and [[international organizations]], political behaviour and [[public policies]]. They measure the success of [[governance]] and specific policies by examining many factors, including [[Economic stability|stability]], [[justice]], [[material wealth]],  [[peace]] and [[public health]]. Some political scientists seek to advance [[positive (social sciences)|positive]] (attempt to describe how things are, as opposed to how they should be) theses by analysing politics. Others advance [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] theses, by making specific policy recommendations.

Political scientists provide the frameworks from which journalists, special interest groups, politicians, and the [[Constituency|electorate]] analyse issues. According to Chaturvedy,
{{quote|Political scientists may serve as advisers to specific politicians, or even run for office as politicians themselves. Political scientists can be found working in governments, in political parties or as civil servants. They may be involved with [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) or political movements. In a variety of capacities, people educated and trained in political science can add value and expertise to [[corporation]]s. Private enterprises such as [[think tank]]s, research institutes, polling and [[public relations]] firms often employ political scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaturvedy|first1=J. C.|title=Political Governance: Political theory|publisher=Isha Books|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kzV4V59udu8C&amp;pg=PA4 |accessdate=28 October 2014|isbn=9788182053175|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the United States, political scientists known as "[[American politics (political science)|Americanists]]" look at a variety of data including [[United States Constitution|constitutional development]], [[elections]], [[public opinion]], and [[public policy]] such as [[Social Security reform]], [[foreign policy]], [[US Congress]]ional committees, and the [[United States Supreme Court|US Supreme Court]]&amp;nbsp;— to name only a few issues.

Because political science is essentially a study of [[human behaviour]], in all aspects of [[politics]], observations in controlled environments are often challenging to reproduce or duplicate, though [[experiment]]al methods are increasingly common (see [[experimental political science]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Druckman|editor1-first=James|editor2-first=Donald|editor2-last=Green|editor3-first=James|editor3-last=Kuklinski|editor4-first=Arthur|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Lupia|year=2011|title=Cambridge Handbook of Experimental Political Science|location=New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-17455-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing this difficulty, former [[American Political Science Association]] President [[Lawrence Lowell]] once said "We are limited by the impossibility of experiment. Politics is an observational, not an experimental science."&lt;ref&gt;Lowell, A. Lawrence. 1910. "The Physiology of Politics." ''American Political Science Review'' 4: 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, political scientists have historically observed political elites, institutions, and individual or group behaviour in order to identify patterns, draw generalizations, and build theories of politics.

Like all social sciences, political science faces the difficulty of observing human actors that can only be partially observed and who have the capacity for making conscious choices unlike other subjects such as non-human organisms in [[biology]] or inanimate objects as in [[physics]]. Despite the complexities, contemporary political science has progressed by adopting a variety of methods and theoretical approaches to understanding politics and methodological pluralism is a defining feature of contemporary political science.

The advent of political science as a university discipline was marked by the creation of university departments and chairs with the title of political science arising in the late 19th century. In fact, the designation "political scientist" is typically for those with a doctorate in the field, but can also apply to those with a master's in the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor|title=How to Become a Political Scientist|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/political-scientists.htm#tab-4|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integrating political studies of the past into a unified discipline is ongoing, and the history of political science has provided a rich field for the growth of both [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] and [[positive (social sciences)|positive]] political science, with each part of the discipline sharing some historical predecessors. The American Political Science Association and the ''[[American Political Science Review]]'' were founded in 1903 and 1906, respectively, in an effort to distinguish the study of politics from economics and other social phenomena.  To date, the &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apsanet.org/apsr|title=American Political Science Association &gt; PUBLICATIONS &gt; About APSA Journals &gt; American Political Science Review|website=www.apsanet.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;American Political Science Review is the leading journal in Political Science research. 

===Behavioural revolution and new institutionalism===

In the 1950s and the 1960s, a behavioural revolution stressing the systematic and rigorously scientific study of individual and group behaviour swept the discipline. A focus on studying political behaviour, rather than institutions or interpretation of legal texts, characterized early behavioural political science, including work by [[Robert Dahl]], [[Philip Converse]], and in the collaboration between sociologist [[Paul Lazarsfeld]] and public opinion scholar [[Bernard Berelson]].

The late 1960s and early 1970s witnessed a take off in the use of deductive, [[game theory|game theoretic]] formal modelling techniques aimed at generating a more analytical corpus of knowledge in the discipline. This period saw a surge of research that borrowed theory and methods from economics to study political institutions, such as the United States Congress, as well as political behaviour, such as voting. [[William H. Riker]] and his colleagues and students at the [[University of Rochester]] were the main proponents of this shift.

Despite considerable research progress in the discipline based on all the kinds of scholarship discussed above, it has been observed that progress toward systematic theory has been modest and uneven.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Quaile Hill, "In Search of General Theory," Journal of Politics 74(October 2012), 917-931.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anticipating of crises===

The theory of political transitions,&lt;ref&gt;Acemoglu D., Robinson J.A. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2677820 "A theory of political transitions."] American Economic Review. 2001 Sep 1:938-963.&lt;/ref&gt; and the methods of their analysis and anticipating of crises,&lt;ref&gt;McClelland C.A. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2600146 "The Anticipation of International Crises: Prospects for Theory and Research."] International Studies Quarterly, Vol. 21, No. 1, Special Issue on International Crisis:Progress and Prospects for Applied Forecasting and Management (March 1977), pp. 15-38&lt;/ref&gt; form an important part of political science. Several general indicators of crises and methods were proposed for anticipating critical transitions.&lt;ref&gt;Scheffer M., Carpenter S.R., Lenton T.M., Bascompte J., Brock W., Dakos V., Van De Koppel J., Van De Leemput I.A., Levin S.A., Van Nes E.H., Pascual M. [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6105/344 "Anticipating critical transitions."] Science. 2012 Oct 19;338(6105):344-348.&lt;/ref&gt; Among them, a statistical indicator of crisis, simultaneous increase of [[variance]] and [[correlations]] in large groups, was proposed for crises anticipation and successfully used in various areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gorban|first1=A.N.|last2=Smirnova|first2=E.V.|last3=Tyukina|first3=T. A.|title=Correlations, risk and crisis: From physiology to finance|journal=Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications|date=August 2010|volume=389|issue=16|pages=3193–3217|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222687003|doi=10.1016/j.physa.2010.03.035|arxiv=0905.0129|bibcode=2010PhyA..389.3193G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its applicability for early diagnosis of political crises was demonstrated by the analysis of the prolonged stress period preceding the 2014 [[Ukrainian crisis|Ukrainian economic and political crisis]]. There was a simultaneous increase in the total correlation between the 19 major public fears in the Ukrainian society (by about 64%) and also in their statistical dispersion (by 29%) during the pre-crisis years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rybnikov|first1=S.R.|last2=Rybnikova|first2=N.A.|last3=Portnov|first3=B.A.|title=Public fears in Ukrainian society: Are crises predictable?|journal=Psychology &amp; Developing Societies|date=March 2017|volume=29|issue=1|pages=98–123|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315918065|doi=10.1177/0971333616689398}}&lt;/ref&gt; A feature shared by certain major revolutions is that they were not predicted. The theory of apparent inevitability of crises and revolutions was also developed.&lt;ref&gt;Kuran T. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30025019 "Sparks and prairie fires: A theory of unanticipated political revolution."] Public Choice, Vol. 61, No. 1 (April 1989), pp. 41–74&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political science in the Soviet Union===
In the [[Soviet Union]], political studies were carried out under the guise of some other disciplines like theory of state and [[law]], [[area studies]], [[international relations]], studies of labor movement, "critique of bourgeois theories", etc. Soviet scholars were represented at the [[International Political Science Association]] (IPSA) since 1955 (since 1960 by the Soviet Association of Political and State Studies).

In 1979, the 11th World Congress of IPSA took place in [[Moscow]]. Until the late years of the Soviet Union, political science as a field was subjected to tight control of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and was thus subjected to distrust. Anti-communists accused political scientists of being "false" scientists and of having served the old regime.&lt;ref name="Reference"&gt;Political Science in Russia: Institutionalization of the Discipline and Development of the Professional Community&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the Soviet Union, two of the major institutions dealing with political science, the Institute of Contemporary Social Theories and the Institute of International Affairs, were disbanded, and most of their members were left without jobs. These institutes were victims of the first wave of [[anticommunist]] opinion and ideological attacks. Today, the Russian Political Science Association unites professional political scientists from all around Russia.

===Recent developments===
In 2000, the [[Perestroika Movement]] in political science was introduced as a reaction against what supporters of the movement called the mathematicization of political science. Those who identified with the movement argued for a plurality of methodologies and approaches in political science and for more relevance of the discipline to those outside of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=veelUVVHg8MC|title=Perestroika!: The Raucous Rebellion in Political Science|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300130201|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Evolutionary psychology]] theories argue that humans have evolved a highly developed set of psychological mechanisms for dealing with politics. However, these mechanisms evolved for dealing with the small group politics that characterized the ancestral environment and not the much larger political structures in today's world. This is argued to explain many important features and systematic [[cognitive bias]]es of current politics.&lt;ref name=AEP&gt;Michael Bang Petersen. "The evolutionary psychology of mass politics".

==Political science education==

Political science, possibly like the social sciences as a whole, "as a discipline lives on the fault line between the 'two cultures' in the academy, the [[sciences]] and the [[humanities]]."&lt;ref name=Stoner&gt;{{cite web|last=Stoner |first=J. R. |url=http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/4/5/5/8/p245585_index.html |title=Political Science and Political Education |publisher=Paper presented at the annual meeting of the APSA Teaching and Learning Conference ([[American Political Science Association|APSA]]), San Jose Marriott, [[San Jose, California]] |date=22 February 2008 |quote=... although one might allege the same for social science as a whole, political scientists receive funding from and play an active role in both the [[National Science Foundation]] and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] [in the United States]. |accessdate=19 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130234044/http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/4/5/5/8/p245585_index.html |archivedate=30 November 2009 }} &lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p245585_index.html&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in some American colleges where there is no separate [[College of Arts and Sciences|School
 or College of Arts and Sciences]] per se, political science may be a separate department housed as part of a division or school of Humanities or [[Liberal Arts]].&lt;ref name=Marist&gt;See, e.g., the department of [http://www.marist.edu/liberalarts/polsci/ Political Science] at [[Marist College]], part of a Division of Humanities before that division became the School of Liberal Arts (c. 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas classical [[political philosophy]] is primarily defined by a concern for [[Greece|Hellenic]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thought, political scientists are also marked by a great concern for "[[modernity]]" and the contemporary [[nation state]], along with the study of classical thought, and as such share a greater deal of terminology with [[sociologists]] (e.g. [[structure and agency]]).

Most [[United States]] [[Higher education in the United States|colleges and universities]] offer B.A. programs in political science. M.A. or M.A.T. and Ph.D. or Ed.D. programs are common at larger universities. The term ''political science'' is more popular in [[North America]] than elsewhere; other institutions, especially those outside the United States, see political science as part of a broader discipline of ''political studies,'' ''politics,'' or ''government.'' While ''political science'' implies use of the [[scientific method]], ''political studies'' implies a broader approach, although the naming of degree courses does not necessarily reflect their content.&lt;ref&gt;''Politics'' is the term used to refer to this field by [[Brandeis University]]; [[Cornell College]]; [[University of California, Santa Cruz]]; [[Hendrix College]]; [[Lake Forest College]]; [[Monash University]]; [[Mount Holyoke College]]; [[New York University]]; [[Occidental College]]; [[Princeton University]]; [[Ursinus College]]; [[Washington and Lee University]]; and [[Zeppelin University]]. ''Government'' is the term used for this field by [[Bowdoin College]]; [[Colby College]]; [[Cornell University]]; [[Dartmouth College]]; [[Georgetown University]]; [[Harvard University]]; [[Smith College]]; [[Wesleyan University]]; the [[College of William and Mary]]; the [[University of Sydney]]; the [[University of Texas at Austin]]; the [[University of Ulster]]; the [[University of Essex]]; [[Victoria University of Wellington]], which has both a "School of Government" and a separate "Political Science and International Relations Programme"; and the [[London School of Economics|London School of Economics and Political Science]]. ''Politics and government'' is the term used by the [[University of Puget Sound]]. ''Government and politics'' is used by the [[University of Maryland, College Park]].&lt;/ref&gt; Separate degree granting programs in international relations and [[public policy]] are not uncommon at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Master's level programs in political science are common when political scientists engage in [[public administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vernardakis |first=George |title=Graduate education in government |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rd3DDiQm3M8C&amp;pg=PA77 |page=77 |year=1998 |publisher=University Press of America |isbn=978-0-7618-1171-8 |quote=...existing practices at Harvard University, the University of California at Berkeley, and the University of Michigan.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The national honor society for college and university students of government and politics in the United States is [[Pi Sigma Alpha]].

===Cognate fields===
Most political scientists work broadly in one or more of the following five areas:
* [[Comparative politics]], including [[area studies]]
* [[International relations]]
* [[Political philosophy]] or political theory
* [[Public administration]]
* [[Public law]]

Some political science departments also classify [[methodology]] as well as scholarship on the domestic politics of a particular country as distinct fields. In the United States, [[American political science|American politics]] is often treated as a separate subfield.

In contrast to this traditional classification, some academic departments organize scholarship into thematic categories, including political philosophy, [[Theories of political behavior|political behaviour]] (including [[public opinion]], [[collective action]], and [[Identity (social science)|identity]]), and political institutions (including [[legislature]]s and [[international organization]]s). Political science conferences and journals often emphasize scholarship in more specific categories. The American Political Science Association, for example, has 42 organized sections that address various methods and topics of political inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apsanet.org/content_4596.cfm APSA Organized Sections | APSA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Add sections here on each subfield --&gt;

==History==
{{main article|History of political science}}

As a social science, contemporary political science started to take shape in the latter half of the 19th century. At that time it began to separate itself from political philosophy, which traces its roots back to the works of [[Aristotle]], and [[Plato]] which were written nearly 2,500 years ago. The term "political science" was not always distinguished from political philosophy, and the modern discipline has a clear set of antecedents including also moral philosophy, political economy, political theology, history, and other fields concerned with normative determinations of what ought to be and with deducing the characteristics and functions of the ideal state.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7504">The '''political science of religion''' (also referred to as politicology of religion or politology of religion) is one of the youngest disciplines in the [[political science]]s that deals with a study of influence that [[religion]] has on [[politics]] and vice versa with a focus on the relationship between the subjects ([[Actor (policy debate)|actors]]) in politics in the narrow sense: [[government]], [[political parties]], [[pressure group]]s, and [[religious communities]]. It was established in the last decades of the twentieth century.

==Research areas==
The basic research areas of the political science of religion are:
* All aspects of [[religion|religious]] teachings and practices that have direct political contents and messages, such as religious understanding of government, [[Power (sociology)|power]], political [[authority]], [[State (polity)|state]], political organizing, [[war]], [[peace]], etc.;
* All aspects of religious behavior and practice that don’t have direct political contents and messages but do have direct political consequences, such as building of [[Religious architecture|religious edifices]], [[pilgrimage]]s, etc.;
* Attitudes and positions of political subjects in the narrow sense towards religion and religious communities, such as that of [[political party|political parties]] and pressure groups towards religion and religious communities;
* Everything within apparently completely [[secular]] public behavior with no religious motives that causes religious consequences, such as an economic [[monopoly]] achieved by a religious group within a multi-confessional society – it cannot but cause political consequences.

These fields of research are in constant development. The newest area of research in political science of religion is on the subject of religion and international relations.

==History==
The political science of religion or politology of religion was established as an [[academic discipline]] in 1993 at the Faculty of Political Science of the [[University of Belgrade]], [[Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fpn.bg.ac.rs/eng/pages/p_id1/o_p.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210043816/http://www.fpn.bg.ac.rs/eng/pages/p_id1/o_p.html |archivedate=2010-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The  founder of this discipline is Dr Miroljub Jevtic; http://www.fpn.bg.ac.rs/en/undergraduate-studies/political-department/third-year/ . In 2006, [[Georgetown University]] established the [[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] as one of the first American university research centers devoted to issues surrounding the political science of religion.

The ''Politics and Religion Journal'' was founded by the Center for Study of Religion and Religious Tolerance in [[Belgrade, Serbia]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politicsandreligionjournal.com/english/english.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028171212/http://www.politicsandreligionjournal.com/english/english.htm |archivedate=2008-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its ''spiritus movens'' and [[editor in chief]] is [[Miroljub Jevtić]], professor at the Faculty of Political Science, University of Belgrade, Serbia. The journal ''Politics and Religion'', produced by Cambridge Journals, published its first volume in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayJournal?jid=RAP Politics and Religion]&lt;/ref&gt;

The political science of religion is studied at almost all universities and political science departments in the United States. The [[American Political Science Association]] has a religion and politics section.&lt;ref&gt;[https://connect.apsanet.org/s11/home/ “Religion and Politics”]&lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of '''politics and technology''' covers concepts, mechanisms, personalities, efforts, and [[social movement]]s including but not necessarily limited to the [[Internet]] and other [[Information technology|information and communication technologies]] (ICTs).

A growing body of scholarship has begun to explore how Internet technologies are influencing [[political communication]] and [[Participation (decision making)|participation]], especially in terms of what is known as the [[public sphere]].

One of the most influential and transformational information and communication technologies is the [[mobile phone]] or [[smartphone]], which can include: talk, text messaging, [[Internet]] and [[World Wide Web|Web]] access, [[electronic mail]], [[faxing]], pictures, video, and a wide variety of [[Mobile app|apps]]. Mobile devices are proving to increase political participation and are now even being portrayed as a voting gadget in even the [[least developed countries]]. Increased availability of this [[technology]] and subsequent access to the public sphere has enhanced the ability of individuals and groups to bring attention to and organize around specialized issues.&lt;ref&gt;Creeber, Glen. Digital Cultures: [understanding New Media]. Maidenhead: Open Univ., 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, [[social media]] has emerged to become one of the main areas of influence for [[politics]], where millions of users are able to learn about politicians' policies and statements, interact with political leaders, organize, and voice their own opinions on political matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Politics and the Twitter revolution : how tweets influence the relationship between political leaders and the public|last2=Bichard|first2=Shannon|date=2012|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=9780739165010|location=Lanham, MD|page=1|pages=|last1=Parmelee|first1=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The digital public sphere ==
The idea of the [[public sphere]] has generally come to be understood as the open social spaces and [[public space]]s in which private citizens interact and share information and ideas relevant to the society. These can include, for example, town halls, public squares, markets, coffee shops, or what ancient Greeks called [[agora]]s. Many scholars have argued that these spaces are vitally important for creating and maintaining an active and informed public in a democratic society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/24669015|title=Free spaces : the sources of democratic change in America|last=Evans|first=Sara M.|last2=Boyte|first2=Harry C.|date=1992|publisher=University of Chicago Press|others=|year=|isbn=978-0226222578|edition= 2nd|location=Chicago|pages=|oclc=24669015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jürgen Habermas]]' book  ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere|The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere – An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society]]'', he defines the public sphere as "a realm of social life in which public opinion can be formed."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/18327374|title=The structural transformation of the public sphere : an inquiry into a category of bourgeois society|last=Jürgen|first=Habermas|publisher=|year=1962|isbn=978-0262081801|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=|oclc=18327374}}&lt;/ref&gt; In principle, the public sphere should be open to all citizens, and free from influence from governments or private businesses. Habermas goes on to argue that:&lt;blockquote href="Digital rights"&gt;"A portion of the public sphere is constituted in every conversation in which private persons come together to form a public. They are then acting neither as business or professional people conducting their private affairs, nor as legal consociates subject to the legal regulations of a state bureaucracy and obligated to obedience. Citizens act as a public when they deal with matters of general interest without being subject to coercion; thus with the guarantee that they may assemble and unite freely, and express and publicize their opinions freely."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Howard Rheingold]] argues that, "There is an intimate connection between informal conversations, the kind that take place in communities... and the ability of large social groups to govern themselves without monarchs or dictators.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44162557|title=The virtual community : homesteading on the electronic frontier|last=Howard.|first=Rheingold,|date=2000|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0262681216|edition= Rev. |location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=44162557}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rheingold and others&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dahlgren|first=Peter|date=2006|title=The Internet, Public Spheres, and Political Communication: Dispersion and Deliberation|journal=Political Communication|volume=22|issue=2|pages=147–162|doi=10.1080/10584600590933160}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also gone on to argue that virtual spaces created through the [[Internet]] and related [[Information and communications technology|information and communications technologies]] have led to the emergence of a new type of digital public sphere. Some scholars have conceptualized this alternately as a virtual public sphere&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Papacharissi|first=Zizi|date=2002|title=The virtual sphere|journal=New Media &amp; Society|language=en|volume=4|issue=1|pages=9–27|doi=10.1177/14614440222226244|issn=1461-4448}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a networked public sphere,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shirky|first=Clay|date=2011|title=The Political Power of Social Media: Technology, the Public Sphere, and Political Change|jstor=25800379|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=90|issue=1|pages=28–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/961312425|title=Twitter and tear gas : the power and fragility of networked protest|last=Zeynep|first=Tufekci|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=9780300215120|location=New Haven|pages=|oclc=961312425}}&lt;/ref&gt; while still others have similarly described what they call a networked society&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/855022865|title=Communication power|last=Castells|first=Manuel|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780191510434|edition= 2nd|location=Oxford|pages=|oclc=855022865}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/795757037|title=Networks of outrage and hope: social movements in the Internet age|last=Castells|first=Manuel|date=|publisher=Polity|year=2015|isbn=9780745662855|edition= 2nd|location=Cambridge|pages=|oclc=795757037}}&lt;/ref&gt; or networked publics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/283798198|title=Networked Publics|last=Varnelis|first=Kazys|date=|publisher=MIT Press|others=Annenberg Center for Communication (University of Southern California)|year=2008|isbn=9780262285483|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=|oclc=283798198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, these new virtual spaces can be used in much the same way as traditional, offline spaces; that is, as a "free space"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48943689|title=Democratic phoenix : reinventing political activism|last=Pippa|first=Norris|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=978-0521811774|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=|oclc=48943689}}&lt;/ref&gt; to discuss and debate ideas of public importance. Just as the public sphere is a combination of "every conversation in which private persons come together to form a public"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the digital public sphere also comprises all forms of [[new media]], such as [[chat room]]s, website comment sections, and [[social media]], in which private citizens engage in discourse as a public. Virtual spaces may overlap or interact with offline spaces as well, forming what has been called "hybrid networks".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lim|first=Merlyna|date=2015|title=A CyberUrban Space Odyssey: The Spatiality of Contemporary Social Movements|url=https://www.academia.edu/16240525|journal=New Geographies|language=en|volume=7|pages=117–123|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars argue that social media affords increasing opportunities for political discourse and mobilization within the digital public sphere.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loader|first=Brian D.|last2=Mercea|first2=Dan|date=2011|title=Networking Democracy? Social media innovations and participatory politics|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|volume=14|issue=6|pages=757–769|doi=10.1080/1369118X.2011.592648}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that increased use of social media correlates with increases in certain types of political engagement and [[Participation (decision making)|participation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boulianne|first=Shelly|date=|year=2015|title=Social media use and participation: a meta-analysis of current research|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|volume=18|issue=5|pages=524–538|doi=10.1080/1369118X.2015.1008542}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kahne|first=Joseph|last2=Bowyer|first2=Benjamin|date=2018|title=The Political Significance of Social Media Activity and Social Networks|journal=Political Communication|volume=35|issue=3|pages=470-493|doi=10.1080/10584609.2018.1426662}}&lt;/ref&gt; The digital public sphere thus has the potential to enliven democratic culture&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/227016731|title=Viral spiral : how the commoners built a digital republic of their own|last=David.|first=Bollier,|date=2008|publisher=New Press|isbn=978-1595583963|location=New York|oclc=227016731}}&lt;/ref&gt; and enhance the ability of citizens to challenge the political and economic power of governments and corporations&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; such as through online [[protest]]s, [[activism]] campaigns, and [[social movement]]s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/639573767|title=Digitally enabled social change : activism in the Internet age|last=Earl|first=Jennifer|last2=Kimport|first2=Katrina|date=|publisher=MIT Press|others=|year=2011|isbn=9780262015103|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=|oclc=639573767}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have also highlighted, alongside [[economic globalization]], the role of Internet technologies to reach across national borders to contribute to a growing transnational public sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.press.umich.edu/11707|title=Globalizations and Social Movements|date=2000|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472097210|editor-last=Guidry|editor-first=John|location=Ann Arbor, MI|language=en|doi=10.3998/mpub.11707|editor-last2=Kennedy|editor-first2=Michael|editor-last3=Zald|editor-first3=Mayer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51817597|title=Transnational activism in Asia : problems of power and democracy|last=Piper|first=Nicola|last2=Uhlin|first2=Anders|date=|publisher=Routledge|others=|year=2004|isbn=978-0415315135|location=London|pages=|oclc=51817597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticisms ===

==== Social exclusion ====
The traditional, offline public sphere has been criticized for not being as inclusive in practice as it is in theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/23650367|title=Habermas and the public sphere|last=|first=|publisher=MIT Press|others=|year=1992|isbn=978-0262031837|editor-last=Calhoun|editor-first=Craig J.|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=|oclc=23650367}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Feminist scholars like [[Nancy Fraser]] have argued that the public sphere has historically not been as open or accessible to [[Social exclusion|disadvantaged or marginalized groups]] in a society, such as women or people of color; therefore, such groups are forced to form their own separate public spheres, which she refers to as a [[Counterpublic|counter-public]] or ''subaltern counter public''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fraser|first=Nancy|date=1990|title=Rethinking the Public Sphere: A Contribution to the Critique of Actually Existing Democracy|jstor=466240|journal=Social Text|issue=25/26|pages=56–80|doi=10.2307/466240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars contend that online spaces are more open and thus may help to increase inclusive political participation from marginalized groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schlosberg|first=David|last2=Dryzek|first2=John S.|date=2002|title=Digital Democracy: Authentic or Virtual?|jstor=26162195|journal=Organization &amp; Environment|volume=15|issue=3|pages=332–335}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, [[Anonymity|anonymous]] online spaces should allow all individuals to speak with an equal voice to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deseriis|first=M.|date=2013|title=Is Anonymous a New Form of Luddism?: A Comparative Analysis of Industrial Machine Breaking, Computer Hacking, and Related Rhetorical Strategies|journal=Radical History Review|language=en|volume=2013|issue=117|pages=33–48|doi=10.1215/01636545-2210437|issn=0163-6545}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other have pointed out that many contemporary online spaces are not anonymous, such as [[Facebook]]. Avatars and social media profiles often portray an individual's offline identity, which can lead to practices of online discrimination and exclusion which mirror offline inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/214085023|title=Digitizing race : visual cultures of the Internet|last=Lisa|first=Nakamura|date=2008|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=|isbn=9780816653775|location=Minneapolis|pages=|oclc=214085023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now, more and more historically disadvantaged or marginalized groups are also using Internet technology to carve out new online spaces for their own "networked counterpublics" such as through the use of [[hashtag]]s like #Ferguson and [[Black Lives Matter|#BlackLivesMatter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Sarah J.|last2=Foucault Welles|first2=Brooke|date=2015|title=Hijacking #myNYPD: Social Media Dissent and Networked Counterpublics|journal=Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=65|issue=6|pages=932–952|doi=10.1111/jcom.12185|issn=0021-9916}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Sarah J.|last2=Foucault Welles|first2=Brooke|date=2016|title=#Ferguson is everywhere: initiators in emerging counterpublic networks|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|volume=19|issue=3|pages=397–418|doi=10.1080/1369118X.2015.1106571}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The digital divide ====
Another factor which affects access to the digital public sphere is the [[digital divide]], which refers to how people from [[Least Developed Countries|less developed countries]] tend to have less access to [[Information and communications technology|information and communications technologies]] compared to those from more [[Developed country|developed countries]]. For example, the most developed regions of the world, such as North America and Western Europe, have the highest [[Global Internet usage|Internet penetration rates]] at over 80% each, while the least developed countries such as in Africa and South Asia have less than 30% each.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/269329/penetration-rate-of-the-internet-by-region/|title=Global regional internet penetration rate 2017 {{!}} Statistic|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the reduced cost and increasing availability of mobile devices such as [[smartphone]]s throughout less developed regions is helping to reduce this disparity at an exponential rate. In just two years, between 2013 and 2015, the number of Internet users in developing nations has risen by 9%, according to the [[Pew Research Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2016/02/22/smartphone-ownership-and-internet-usage-continues-to-climb-in-emerging-economies/|title=Smartphone Ownership and Internet Usage Continues to Climb in Emerging Economies|date=2016-02-22|work=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project|access-date=2018-07-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has shown, though, that even within more developed countries like the United States, the digital divide continues to persist between upper and lower socioeconomic classes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/broadband-adoption-rates-and-gaps-in-u-s-metropolitan-areas/|title=Broadband adoption rates and gaps in U.S. metropolitan areas|last=Tomer|first=Adie|date=2015|work=Brookings|access-date=2018-07-01|last2=Kane|first2=Jospeh|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and between different education levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/05/some-americans-dont-use-the-internet-who-are-they/|title=11% of Americans don’t use the internet. Who are they?|date=2018-03-05|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2018-07-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, scholars like [[Mark Warschauer]] argue that it is not just access to technology that matters, but the knowledge of how to put that technology to use in meaningful ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50028800|title=Technology and social inclusion : rethinking the digital divide|last=Mark.|first=Warschauer,|date=2003|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0262232241|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=50028800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Popular Unity was founded on 21 August 2015 by 25 parliamentarians formerly affiliated to the [[Syriza|Coalition of the Radical Left]] (Syriza),{{r|bbc21aug}} as a reaction to [[Prime Minister of Greece|Prime Minister]] [[Alexis Tsipras]]' handling of the [[Greek government-debt crisis|Greek bailout agreement of 2015]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5702">{{Hegelianism}}
The '''Right Hegelians''' ({{lang-de|Rechtshegelianer}}), '''Old Hegelians''' (''Althegelianer''), or '''the Hegelian Right''' (''die Hegelsche Rechte''), were those followers of [[Germany|German]] philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] in the early 19th century who took his philosophy in a politically and religiously [[conservative]] direction.  They are typically contrasted with the [[Young Hegelians]], who interpreted Hegel's [[political philosophy]] to support innovations in politics or religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2026775|journal= The Journal of Philosophy|date=1987 |title= The Discourse of Modernity: Hegel and Habermas|last=Dallmayr|first=Fred|volume=84|pages=682–692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Hegel's [[historicism]] holds that both ideas and institutions can only be understood by understanding their history.  Throughout his life, Hegel said he was an [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] [[Lutheran]]. He devoted considerable attention to [[the Absolute]], his term for the infinite Spirit responsible for the totality of reality—something like God, though not the God of classical theism. This Spirit comes to fullest expression in the historical reality of the modern state. In his ''Philosophy of Right'', Hegel writes that:

{{quotation|The [[Sovereign state|State]] is absolutely rational inasmuch as it is the actuality of the substantial will which it possesses in the particular self-consciousness once that consciousness has been raised to consciousness of its universality. This substantial unity is an absolute unmoved end in itself, in which freedom comes into its supreme right. On the other hand this final end has supreme right against the individual, whose supreme duty is to be a member of the State.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Hegel, Georg H. W. 1821. Philosophy of Right. Trad. S. W. Dyde, 2008. Cosimo, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aNa9-h-RGTMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=snippet&amp;q=state%20end%20individual&amp;f=false Google Print, p. 133]&lt;/ref&gt;|''Philosophy of Right'', "The State", p. 258}}

The Hegelian right expanded this conception of [[statism]], seizing on it as an affirmation of establishment politics and orthodox religion.  Hegel's historicism could be read to affirm the historical inevitability of modern institutions; a [[nation]] was an [[Ideal (ethics)|Ideal]], existing in Hegelian [[idealism]] above and about the people who constituted it.  To argue for political change was to attack the Ideal of the national state.  The Right Hegelians believed that advanced [[Europe]]an societies, as they existed in the first half of the nineteenth century, were the summit of all social development, the product of the historical [[dialectic]] that had existed thus far.  Most praised the Prussian state, which enjoyed an extensive [[civil service]] system, good universities, [[industrialization]], and high [[employment]], as the acme of progress and the incarnation of the ''[[Zeitgeist]]''.

Many of the members of the Hegelian right went on to have distinguished careers in public academia or the Lutheran Church.  As a school, they were closely associated with the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]], and held many of the chairs of philosophy and theology there.  Generally, the philosophers of the Hegelian right have been neglected; their fame, if not their reputations, has been eclipsed by the [[Young Hegelians]], including [[Bruno Bauer]] and [[Karl Marx]]. They left their mark chiefly in theology.  Their efforts did not have the intended effect of bolstering a sense of the inevitability of faith as a product of history; rather, they pioneered the introduction of [[higher criticism]] by demonstrating the influence of an era on the development of Christianity.

Philosophers within the camp of the Hegelian right include:

* [[Johann Philipp Gabler]]
* [[Hermann Friedrich Wilhelm Hinrichs]]
* [[Karl Daub]]
* [[Heinrich Leo]]
* [[Leopold von Henning]]
* [[Heinrich Gustav Hotho]]

Other thinkers or historians who may be included among the Hegelian right, with some reservations, include:

* [[Johann Karl Friedrich Rosenkranz]]
* [[Eduard Gans]]
* [[Karl Ludwig Michelet]]
* [[Philip Marheineke]]
* [[Wilhelm Vatke]]
* [[Johann Eduard Erdmann]]
* [[Eduard Zeller]]
* [[Albert Schwegler]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4339">{{Chinese Legalism}}
{{unreferenced|date=July 2010}}
The '''School of Diplomacy''' ({{zh|t={{linktext|縱|横|家}}|s={{linktext|纵|横|家}}|p=Zōng héng Jiā}}), or the '''School of Vertical and Horizontal Alliances''' was a political and diplomatic [[clique]] during the [[Warring States period]] of [[History of China|Chinese history]] (476-220 BCE). According to the ''[[Book of Han]]'', the school was one of the [[Nine Schools of Thought]] ({{zh|t=九流|s=九流|p=Jiŭ Liú}}).

According to the ''[[Han Fei Zi]]'', a contemporary work on [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalist Philosophy]], supporters of "Vertical Alliance" encourage the weak multitude to attack the one strong side whilst the Horizontal Alliance promote the one strong side attacking the weak multitude. They are all fickle and capricious, change sides frequently and are unable to decide who their master is. Both [[Su Qin]] of the Vertical Alliance clique and [[Zhang Yi (Warring States period)|Zhang Yi]] of the Horizontal Alliance clique issue many plans and schemes that are politically subjective.'

The origins of the terms "Vertical" and "Horizontal" are geographic and are based on either a North-South axis (i.e. vertical) or an East-West axis (i.e. horizontal). Thus the six states allied on the North-South axis were known as the "Vertical Alliance" whilst those on the East-West axis aligned with the [[Qin (state)|State of Qin]] were termed the "Horizontal Alliance".

"Zong" indicates the "He Zong", or Vertical Alliance, the "weak multitude against the one strong side", made up of the six states of [[Qi (state)|Qi]], [[Chu (state)|Chu]], [[Yan (state)|Yan]], [[Han (state)|Han]], [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]] and [[Wei (state)|Wei]] united against [[Qin (state)|Qin]]. "Heng" indicates the "Lian Heng", or Horizontal Alliance, the "one strong side to smash the weak multitude", thus illustrating the different diplomatic policies of the two sides.

The School of Diplomacy was one of the nine styles of the ten Schools of Thought of the [[Warring States period]] and starts with an objective point of view to reach the required goal. The school’s adherents were always an active group on the political stage during the [[Warring States period]]. Moreover, they played a decisive role and were described as extremely powerful and capable, constantly struggling to manipulate the situation.

Originated by ''[[Guiguzi]]'', the School of Diplomacy’s main adherents were [[Su Qin]], [[Zhang Yi (strategist)|Zhang Yi]] (Su’s disciple), Gan Mao, Sima Cuo, [[Yue Yi]], Fan Sui, Cai Ze, Zou Ji, Mao Sui, [[Li Yiji]] and Kuai Tong as detailed in the ''[[Zhan Guo Ce|Annals of the Warring States]]''.

The few principal written records of the School of Diplomacy that exist today are the thirteenth chapter of the ''Book of Gui'' or ''[[Guiguzi]]'', the thirty-third chapter of ''[[Zhan Guo Ce|Annals of the Warring States]]'' (not about the School of Diplomacy’s followers but primarily the words and actions of its advisors as well as actual combat case studies), the thirty-first chapter of ''Su Zi'' and the tenth chapter of ''Zhang Zi''. The seventh chapter of the "Benjing Yifu" appendix to the ''[[Guiguzi]]'' describes the mental and moral cultivation methods used by the School of Diplomacy; the "Benjing" covers the ideas behind the basic guiding principles whilst the "Yinfu" consists of very mysterious concealed writings. The reader can comprehend these but is unable to discover their essential meaning. &lt;!--所谓悠然心会妙处难与君说是也 not translated as I cannot determine the meaning --&gt; The ''[[Guiguzi]]'' is a book of theory that is complete in every detail and very subtly written, making its ideas hard to express. More importantly the work requires study and use in order to understand the nuances of its meaning. The ''[[Zhan Guo Ce|Annals of the Warring States]]'' is a well-written rhetorical compendium the words and actions of the strategists of the School of Diplomacy who were all resourceful, intelligent, aware of the actual situation and gifted in the use of language.

'''Social control''' is a [[concept]] within the [[Discipline (academia)|disciplines]] of the [[social sciences]].&lt;ref name="M. Innes"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6yXo5ARzFaMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Understanding+Social+Control:+Crime+and+Social+Order+in+Late+Modernity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAGoVChMI5JDpgL75xgIVS-0UCh0FRg_z#v=onepage&amp;q=Understanding%20Social%20Control%3A%20Crime%20and%20Social%20Order%20in%20Late%20Modernity&amp;f=false|author=M.

[[Sociology|Sociologists]] identify two basic forms of social control:
# ''Informal means of control'' – [[Internalisation (sociology)|Internalization]] of [[norm (sociology)|norm]]s and [[value (ethics)|value]]s by a process known as [[socialization]], which is "the process by which an individual, born with behavioral potentialities of enormously wide range, is led to develop actual behavior which is confined to the narrower range of what is acceptable for him by the [[Social group|group standards]]."&lt;ref&gt;Lindzey, Gardner (Ed), (1954).

# ''Formal means of social control'' – External [[sanctions (law)|sanctions]] enforced by government to prevent the establishment of [[Lawlessness|chaos]] or [[anomie]] in society. Some theorists, such as [[Émile Durkheim]], refer to this form of control as [[regulation]].

As briefly defined above, the means to enforce social control can be either informal or formal.&lt;ref name=Poore&gt;Poore, S.

Social control is considered one of the foundations of [[Social order|order within society]].&lt;ref name="E.A.

==Definition of the concept==
Roodenburg identifies the concept of social control as a classical concept.&lt;ref name="H. Roodenburg"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YZ1Ty4dxHQ8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=social+control&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiW2-HgnrTJAhWJHxoKHU9XDgcQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=social%20control&amp;f=false|author=H. Roodenburg|title=text|publisher=published by Ohio State University Press 2004, {{ISBN|0814209688}} |accessdate=2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the concept of social control has been around since the formation of organized sociology, the meaning has been altered over time. Originally, the concept simply referred to society's ability to [[Regulation|regulate itself]].&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sociological Theory and Social Control|author=Morris Janowitz|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=81|number=1|date=Jul 1975|pages=82–108|publisher=The University of Chicago Press Article|jstor=2777055|doi=10.1086/226035}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 1930s, the term took on its more modern meaning of an individual's conversion to [[conformity]].&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; Academics began to study [[Social control theory]] as a separate field in the early 20th century.

The concept of social control is related to the notion of [[social order]], a concept identified as existing in the following areas of society:&lt;ref name="M. Innes"/&gt;
{{bulleted list|The [[Education|education system]]|[[Policing]] and the [[law]]|[[Psychiatry]]|[[Social work]]|The [[welfare state]]|The [[Management|working environment]]}}

==Informal==

===Social values===
Social values present in individuals are products of informal social control, exercised implicitly by a society through particular [[customs]], [[social norm|norms]], and [[mores]]. Individuals internalize the values of their society, whether conscious or not of the indoctrination. [[Traditional values|Traditional society]] relies mostly on informal social control embedded in its customary [[culture]] to socialize its members.

===Sanctions===
Informal sanctions may include [[shame]], [[Appeal to ridicule|ridicule]], [[sarcasm]], [[criticism]], and disapproval, which can cause an individual to stray towards the social norms of the society. In extreme cases sanctions may include social [[discrimination]] and [[social exclusion|exclusion]]. Informal social control usually has more effect on individuals because the social values become [[internalized]], thus becoming an aspect of the individual's [[Personality psychology|personality]].

Informal sanctions check '[[deviant]]' behavior.  An example of a negative sanction comes from a scene in the Pink Floyd film ''[[The Wall]]'', whereby the young protagonist is ridiculed and verbally [[abuse]]d by a high school teacher for writing poetry in a mathematics class. Another example from the movie ''[[About a Boy (film)|About a Boy]]'', when a young boy hesitates to jump from a high springboard and is ridiculed for his fear. Though he eventually jumps, his behavior is controlled by shame.&lt;ref&gt;Holland G., Skinner B. F. ''The Analysis of behaviour (The autoinstructing program)''. McGraw-Hill N. Y., 1961, Lesson 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reward and punishment===
{{see also|Mesolimbic pathway|Reward system}}

Informal controls reward or [[Punishment|punish]] acceptable or unacceptable behavior (i.e., [[deviance (sociology)|deviance]]) and are varied from individual to individual, group to group, and society to society. For example, at a [[Women's Institutes (British)|Women's Institute]] meeting, a disapproving look might convey the message that it is inappropriate to flirt with the minister. In a [[Organized crime|criminal gang]], on the other hand, a stronger sanction applies in the case of someone threatening to inform to the police of illegal activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Theoretical bias within the modern media===
Theorists such as [[Noam Chomsky]] have argued that [[systemic bias]] exists in the modern media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Powerful ideological, economic and religious [[lobbyists]] have often used school systems and centralized electronic communications to influence [[public opinion]].

==Formal==

===Historically===
Social control developed together with civilization, as a rational measure against the uncontrollable forces of nature, which [[tribe|tribal]] organisations were at prey to, within archaic tribal societies.&lt;ref name="D.S. McIntosh "&gt;{{cite book |jstor=1952567|author=D.S. McIntosh |title=DOI: 10.2307/1952567 (p.619)|publisher=published by The American Political Science Review  September 1963 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[divine right of kings|Rulers]] have [[Legitimation|legitimately]] used [[torture]] as a means of [[mind control]]  as well as [[murder]], [[imprisonment]] and [[exile]] to remove from public space anyone the state authorities deemed undesirable.

In the [[Age of Enlightenment]], harsh penalties for [[crimes]] and [[civil disobedience]] were criticized by [[List of civil rights leaders|philosophers]] such as [[Cesare Beccaria]] and [[Jeremy Bentham]], whose work inspired [[reform movement]]s. These movements eventually led to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948, which informs most western [[jurisdictions]] and the similar [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]] in 1990.

The word ''[[crime]]''  became part of the [[vocabulary]] of the [[English language]] via [[Old French]], during the [[Middle Ages]], and within the [[Middle English]] of the language.&lt;ref name="B. Hanawalt, D. Wallace"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1pIdd74zfZ4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=social+control&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-9M7dyLXJAhWJ2hoKHehcChg4ChDoAQgnMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=social%20control&amp;f=false|author= B.

In history, [[religion]] provided a moral influence on the community and each person, providing an internal [[locus of control]] oriented toward a [[morality]], so that each person was empowered to have a degree of control over themselves within society. As [[Auguste Comte]] instituted sociology ([[The Course in Positive Philosophy|1830-1842]]), already certain thinkers predicted the discontinuation of a perceived ''false consciousness'' intrinsic to religious belief.  Nevertheless, within the twentieth century, social scientists presumed that religion was still a principal factor of social control.&lt;ref name="R. Stark, W.S. Bainbridge"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eVt4yqoeP0YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=social+control&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiSmpfmu7XJAhWLcBoKHSBoCMAQ6AEIRzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=social%20control&amp;f=false|author=R.

Comte, and those who preceded him, were breathing the air of a [[revolution]] in the latter part of the eighteenth century ([[French Revolution]]) to bring about a so-called  enlightened way of being in society, which brought about a new [[liberty]] for the individual, without the constraints of an over-seeing [[aristocracy]].&lt;ref&gt;G.S.

In the context social control through penal and correctional services, the ''rehabilatative ideal'' (Francis Allen 1964) is a key idea that formed within the 20th century—the first principle of which is that behavior is first caused by things that happened before ("Human behaviour is a product of antecedent causes").&lt;ref name="T.G. Blomberg, K.

===Techniques===
[[Law]] is a technique used for the purposes of social control.&lt;ref name="Roscoe Pound"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1sCffAYNpu0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=social+control&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiSmpfmu7XJAhWLcBoKHSBoCMAQ6AEIQTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=social%20control&amp;f=false|author=R.

Historically, homosexuality has been criminalised. In modern times, this is no longer an offence and this is due to shifts in society's values. Howerever, there are still laws regarding age of consent and incest, as these are still deemed as issues in society that require means of control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palgraveconnect.com/pc/doifinder/10.1057/9781137476159.0009|title=Roffee, James (2015).

A mechanism of social control occurs through the use of selective incentives.&lt;ref&gt;B. Janky, K.

Oberschall, in his work, identifies three elements to the pragmatics of social control as they exist in our current society. These are, confrontational control, such as  [[riot control]] and [[crowd control]], preventative measures to deter non-normal behaviors, which is legislation outlining expected boundaries for behavior,  and measures complementary to preventative measures, which amount to punishment of criminal offences.&lt;ref name="Anthony Oberschall"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JT8761v8-x4C&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=social+control+riot+control&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAmoVChMIxrnl-tD5xgIVATwUCh3RJQJZ#v=onepage&amp;q=social%20control%20riot%20control&amp;f=false|author=Anthony Oberschall|title=Social Movements: Ideologies, Interests, and Identities|publisher=Transaction Publishers 1995, 402 pages, {{ISBN|1412834368}}|accessdate=2015-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cities can implement park exclusion orders (prohibiting individuals from frequenting some or all of the parks in a city for an extended period due to a previous infraction), trespass laws (privatizing areas generally thought of as public so police can to choose which individuals to interrogate), and off-limit orders (Stay Out of Drug Areas (SODA) and Stay Out of Areas of Prostitution (SOAP) that obstruct access to these spaces). These are just a few of the new social control techniques cities use to displace certain individuals to the margins of society.&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; Several common themes are apparent in each of these control mechanisms. The first is the ability to spatially constrain individuals in their own city. Defying any of the above statutes is a criminal offense resulting in possible incarceration.&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; Though not all individuals subjected to an exclusion order obey it, these individuals are, at the very least, spatially hindered through decreased mobility and freedom throughout the city.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt; This spatial constrain on individuals leads to disruption and interference in their lives. Homeless individuals generally frequent parks since the area provides benches for sleeping, public washrooms, occasional public services, and an overall sense of security by being near others in similar conditions. Privatizing areas such as libraries, public transportation systems, college campuses, and commercial establishments that are generally public gives the police permission to remove individuals as they see fit, even if the individual has ethical intent in the space. Off-limit orders attempting to keep drug addicts, prostitutes, and others out of concentrated areas of drug and sex crimes commonly restricts these individuals' ability to seek social services beneficial to rehabilitation, since these services are often located within the SODA and SOAP territories.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt;

====Broken windows theory in the United States====
In the United States, early societies were able to easily expel individuals deemed undesirable from public space through [[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] laws and other forms of banishment. In the 1960s and 1970s, however, these exclusion orders were denounced as unconstitutional in America&lt;ref name="nine"&gt;Herbert, Steve and Katherine Beckett. 2009. Zoning out disorder: Assessing contemporary practices of urban social control. ''Studies in Law, Politics, and Society''. 47: 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt; and consequently were rejected by the US Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;Beckett, Katherine and Steve Herbert. 2008. Dealing with disorder: Social control in the post-industrial city. ''Theoretical Criminology''. 12: 5-30.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of [[broken windows theory]] in the 1980s transformed the concepts cities used to form policies, to circumvent the previous issue of unconstitutionality.&lt;ref&gt;Harcourt, Bernard and Jens Ludwig. 2005. Broken windows: New evidence from New York City and a five-city [[social experiment]]. ''The University of Chicago Law Review''. 73: 271-320.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the theory, the environment of a particular space signals its health to the public, including to potential vandals. By maintaining an organized environment, individuals are dissuaded from causing disarray in that particular location. However, environments filled with disorder, such as broken windows or graffiti, indicate an inability for the neighborhood to supervise itself, therefore leading to an increase in criminal activity.&lt;ref name="tented"&gt;Ranasinghe, Prashan. 2010. Public disorder and its relation to the community-civility-consumption triad: A case study on the uses and users of contemporary urban public space. ''Urban Studies''. 48: 1925-1943.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of focusing on the built environment, policies substantiated by the Broken Windows Theory overwhelmingly emphasize undesirable human behavior as the environmental disorder prompting further crime.&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; The civility laws, originating in the late 1980s and early 1990s, provide an example of the usage of this latter aspect of the Broken Windows Theory as legitimization for discriminating against individuals considered disorderly in order to increase the sense of security in urban spaces.&lt;ref name="nine" /&gt; These civility laws effectively criminalize activities considered undesirable, such as sitting or lying on sidewalks, sleeping in parks, urinating or [[drinking in public]], and begging,&lt;ref name="ten"&gt;Beckett, Katherine and Steve Herbert. 2010. Penal boundaries: Banishment and the expansion of punishment. ''Law and Social Inquiry''. 35: 1-38.&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to force the individuals doing these and other activities to relocate to the margins of society.&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; Not surprisingly then, [[criminalization of homelessness|these restrictions disproportionally affect the homeless]].&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt;

Individuals are deemed undesirable in urban space because they do not fit into [[norm (social)|social norms]], which causes unease for many residents of certain neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;England, Marcia. Stay out of drug areas: Drugs, othering, and regulation of public space in Seattle, Washington. ''Space and Polity''. 12: 197-213.&lt;/ref&gt; This fear has been deepened by the Broken Windows Theory and exploited in policies seeking to remove undesirables from visible areas of society.&lt;ref name="tented" /&gt; In the [[post-industrial society|post-industrial city]], concerned primarily with retail, tourism, and the service sector,&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; the increasing pressure to create the image of a livable and orderly city has no doubt aided in the most recent forms of social control.&lt;ref name="nine" /&gt; These new techniques involve even more intense attempts to spatially expel certain individuals from urban space since the police are entrusted with considerably more power to investigate individuals, based on suspicion rather than on definite evidence of illicit actions.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt;

==Recent developments==
In the decades leading up to the end of the 1980s, an increased prevalence of the [[Individualism|individual]] as a feature within society led to many new [[List of psychotherapies|therapies]], suggesting the use of therapy as a means of social control (Conrad &amp; Scheider, 1980: Mechanic 1989).&lt;ref&gt;A.V.

A '''term of office''' is the length of time a person serves in a particular [[elected office]]. In many jurisdictions there is a defined limit on how long terms of office may be before the officeholder must be subject to [[re-election]]. Some jurisdictions exercise [[term limits]], setting a maximum number of terms an individual may hold in a particular office.

==United Kingdom==
Being the origin of the [[Westminster system]], aspects of the [[United Kingdom]]'s system of government are replicated in many other countries.
===Monarch===
The [[Monarch of the United Kingdom|monarch]] serves as head of state until his or her death or [[abdication]].

===House of Commons===
{{seealso|House of Commons of the United Kingdom}}
In the [[United Kingdom]] Members of Parliament (MPs) in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] are elected for the duration of the parliament. Following [[Dissolution of the Parliament of the United Kingdom|dissolution]] of the Parliament, a [[General elections (UK)|general election]] is held which consists of simultaneous elections for all seats. For most MPs this means that their terms of office are identical to the duration of the Parliament, though an individual's term may be cut short by death or [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resignation]]. An MP elected in a [[UK Parliamentary by-elections|by-election]] mid-way through a Parliament, regardless of how long they have occupied the seat, is not exempt from facing [[re-election]] at the next general election.

The [[Septennial Act 1715]] provided that a Parliament expired seven years after it had been summoned; this maximum period was reduced to five years by the [[Parliament Act 1911]]. Prior to the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]] parliaments had no minimum duration. Parliaments could be dissolved early by the monarch at the [[Prime Minister]]'s request. Early dissolutions occurred when the make-up of Parliament made forming government impossible (as occurred in [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|1974]]), or, more commonly, when the incumbent government reasoned an early general election would improve their re-election chances (e.g. [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001]]). The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 mandated that Parliaments should last their full five years. Early dissolution is still possible, but under much more limited circumstances.

Because the [[government of the United Kingdom|government]] and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] are effectively [[Indirect election|indirectly elected]] through the Commons, the terms of Parliaments and MPs do not directly apply to offices of government, though in practice these are affected by changes in Parliament. While, strictly speaking, a Prime Minister whose incumbency spans multiple Parliaments only serves one, unbroken, term of office, some writers may refer to the different Parliaments as separate terms.&lt;ref name="Thatcher 3terms"&gt;{{cite web|title=Margaret Thatcher|url=http://www.biography.com/people/margaret-thatcher-9504796|website=Biography.com|accessdate=5 February 2016|quote="During her three terms…"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===House of Lords===
[[Hereditary peer]]s and [[life peers]] retain membership of the [[House of Lords]] for life, though members can resign or be expelled. [[Lords Spiritual]] hold membership of the House of Lords until the end of their time as bishops, though a senior bishop may be made a life peer upon the end of their bishopric (e.g. [[George Carey]], made ''Baron Carey of Clifton'' the day after he ceased being [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]).
===Devolved administrations===
The [[devolution|devolved administrations]] in [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] are variations on the system of government used at [[Westminster]].

The office of the leader of the devolved administrations has no numeric term limit imposed upon it. However, in the case of the [[Scottish Government]] and the [[Welsh Assembly Government]] there are fixed terms for which the [[legislatures]] can sit. This is imposed at four years. Elections may be held before this time but only if no administration can be formed, which has not happened yet.
===Other elected offices===
Offices of [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local government]] other regional elected officials follow similar rules to the national offices discussed above, with persons elected to fixed terms of a few years.

==United States==

===Federal===
{{main|Federal government of the United States}}
In the [[United States]], the [[president of the United States]] is elected indirectly through the [[United States Electoral College]] to a four-year term, with a [[term limit]] of two terms (totaling eight years) or a maximum of ten years if the president acted as president for two years or less in a term where another was elected as president, imposed by the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution]], ratified in 1951.

The [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] serves four-year terms. [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representatives]] serve two-year terms. [[United States Senate|U.S. Senators]] serve six-year terms. 

[[Federal judges]] have different terms in office. [[Article I and Article III tribunals|Article I judges]]; such as those that sit on the [[United States bankruptcy court]]s, [[United States Tax Court]], and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces]], and certain other [[United States federal courts|federal courts]] and other forms of [[United States administrative law|adjudicative bodies]] serve limited terms: The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces for 15 years, bankruptcy courts for 14. However, the majority of the federal judiciary; Article III judges, such as those of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], [[United States court of appeals|courts of appeal]], and [[United States district court|federal district courts]]; serve for life.

===State and territories===
{{main|State governments of the United States}}
The terms of office for officials in state governments varies according to the provisions of [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]] and [[state law]].

The term for [[state governor]]s is four years in all states but [[Vermont]] and [[New Hampshire]]; the [[Governor of Vermont|Vermont]] and [[Governor of New Hampshire|New Hampshire governors]] serve for two years.

The [[National Conference of State Legislatures]] reported in January 2007 that among [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] [http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090429232858/http://www.ncsl.org/programs/legismgt/about/numoflegis.htm]:
*44 states had terms of office for the [[lower house]] of the state legislature (often termed the state House of Representatives) at two years. Five ([[Alabama House of Representatives|Alabama]], [[Louisiana House of Representatives|Louisiana]], [[Maryland House of Delegates|Maryland]], [[Mississippi House of Representatives|Mississippi]], and [[North Dakota House of Representatives|North Dakota]]) had terms of office at four years. (The [[Nebraska Legislature]] is an exception and has a [[Unicameralism|unicameral legislature]] with members elected for four years.)
*37 states had terms of office for the [[upper house]] of the state legislature (often termed the state Senate) at four years. Twelve ([[Arizona Senate|Arizona]], [[Connecticut Senate|Connecticut]], [[Georgia State Senate|Georgia]], [[Idaho Senate|Idaho]], [[Maine Senate|Maine]], [[Massachusetts Senate|Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire Senate|New Hampshire]], [[New York State Senate|New York]], [[North Carolina Senate|North Carolina]], [[Rhode Island Senate|Rhode Island]], [[South Dakota Senate|South Dakota]], [[Vermont Senate|Vermont]]) had terms of office at two years.

Among [[territories of the United States]]:
*In the [[American Samoa Fono]], members of the [[American Samoa House of Representatives|House]] serve two-year terms while members of the [[American Samoa Senate|Senate]] serve six-year terms.
*Members of both chambers of the [[Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico]] have four-year terms.
*Members of both chambers of the [[Northern Mariana Islands Commonwealth Legislature]] have two-year terms.
*The [[Legislature of Guam]] and [[Legislature of the Virgin Islands]] are unicameral and Senators have two-year terms.

Members of [[Council of the District of Columbia]] serve a four-year term.

==Canada==
As a former British territory following the [[Westminster System]], there are many similarities with the United Kingdom, although with some variations based on local customs, the federal system of government and the absentee monarch.
===Monarch===
Being a [[Commonwealth realm]], Canada shares a [[Monarchy of Canada|monarch]] with the United Kingdom and 14 other countries, who serves as head of state of all 16 realms until their death or abdication.

===Viceroys===
The [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] is appointed by the monarch as his/her personal representative on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]], and serves [[At Her Majesty's Pleasure|for an indefinite term]], though the normal convention is 5 years. Similarly, the [[Lieutenant Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant Governors]], who represent the monarch at the provincial level, are appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister (usually also with consultation of the relevant provincial [[Premier (Canada)|premier]]), and generally also serve 5 year terms by convention. The territories have [[Commissioner#Canadian territories|Commissioners]], who are not representatives of the monarch, but are instead appointed by and represent the [[Queen-in-Council|Governor-in-Council]] (i.e. the [[Cabinet of Canada|federal cabinet]]), and conventionally serve for about 5 years.

===House of Commons===
{{seealso|House of Commons of Canada}}

Similar to the United Kingdom, MPs serve for the duration of the Parliament. They may resign before the end of a Parliament or be elected in [[By-election|by-elections]] during the middle of a Parliament.

Under the [[Constitution Act, 1867]], a Parliament may last for a maximum of 5 years from the most recent election before expiring, although all Parliaments to date have been dissolved before they could expire. Bill C-16, introduced in the [[39th Canadian Parliament|39th Parliament]], provided for fixed election dates every 4 years on the third Monday in October, beginning in 2009. However, the Prime Minister may still advise the Governor General to dissolve Parliament at any time. 

As in the United Kingdom, the cabinet and head of government are indirectly elected based on the composition of the House of Commons, they are not technically affected by the terms of legislators or Parliaments. In practice however, the terms of government office holders are affected by changes in the House of Commons, and those who serve for multiple consecutive Parliaments are generally considered to have served a single term. The term of a government generally ends when it is defeated on a confidence matter or the governing party fails to gain enough seats in a general election.

===Senate===

Senators are appointed to the [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senate]] to represent a province by the Governor General of Canada on the advice of the Prime Minister, and serve until the mandatory retirement age of 75. Senators appointed before the passage of the [[British North America Act, 1965]] served for life. Senators may also resign from office or be expelled from the Senate.

===Provincial and Territorial Legislatures===
{{seealso|Legislative assemblies of Canadian provinces and territories}}

Provincial legislatures and the legislature of the Yukon function very similarly to the federal House of Commons. MLAs (called MPPs in [[Ontario]], MNAs in [[Quebec]], and MHAs in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]) serve for the duration of the legislature, though they may resign before the legislature is dissolved or be elected in by-elections between general elections. The legislatures of the [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]] operate using a [[Consensus government in Canada|consensus]] model, but are similar otherwise. The premiers and their cabinets are selected in the same way as in the House of Commons, and like at the federal level, the term of a provincial government can be ended by defeat in a general election or the loss of the legislature's confidence.

All provincial legislatures except that of [[Nova Scotia]] have fixed-term election legislation in place, as does the legislature of the Northwest Territories. Premiers may also advise Lieutenant Governors to dissolve legislatures at any time before the prescribed election date.

Numbers in years unless stated otherwise. Note that some countries where [[fixed-term election]]s are uncommon, the legislature is almost always dissolved earlier than its expiry date. "[[Life tenure|Until removed from office]]" refers to offices that don't have fixed terms; in these cases, the officeholder(s) may serve indefinitely until death, abdication, resignation, retirement, or forcible removal from office (such as [[impeachment]]).

In cases where the [[head of government]] is a different person from the head of state, its term of office is identical to the chamber that elected it (the legislature if it is unicameral, or most usually the [[lower house]] if it is bicameral), unless it doesn't survive a [[vote of no confidence]].

{{Tony Blair sidebar}}
The '''timeline for the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]] leadership elections of 2007''' is a timeline of events relating to the final years of [[Tony Blair]]'s tenure as leader of the party and Prime Minister and the leadership elections to find replacements for him and Deputy Prime Minister [[John Prescott]], from his announcement that he would not lead Labour into a fourth General Election, concluding with [[Gordon Brown]] becoming Prime Minister.

==Initial signals that Blair's leadership was to end==
{{see also|2004 in the United Kingdom|2005 in the United Kingdom}}
On 30 September 2004, [[Tony Blair]] said he would not seek a fourth term as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. Labour went on to win a third successive term at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|May 2005 General Election]] with a decreased majority of 66, with Blair pledging to serve another full term.

Labour and Blair subsequently had a surge in popularity at the time of [[Timeline of the 2005 London bombings|terrorist bombings of London]] of July 2005, but by the Spring of 2006 were facing significant difficulties, most notably with scandals over failures by the [[Home Office]] to deport illegal immigrants and national campaigns by many political parties and think tanks saying that the United Kingdom was being overrun by immigrants. Worries over the potential increase of support for the [[British National Party]] during the [[UK local elections, 2006|2006 Local Election]] campaign saw many Labour backbenchers and activists begin to demand a timetable from Blair for his departure, with many suggesting that it should be sooner rather than later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk_politics/2006/election_2006/default.stm | title =Election 2006 | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=23 April 2007 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speculation over the timing of Blair's resignation had been amplified by a variety of politicians and newspapers making their own predictions.  On 6 September 2006, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' reported that Blair would announce a timetable on 31 May 2007, with his replacement to take office by the end of July,&lt;ref name="The Sun"&gt;{{cite news| url =http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2006410396,00.html | title =Blair tells aides he quits May 31 | author =George Pascoe-Watson | date =6 September 2006 | work =[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 21 April [[The Guardian]] reported that the Brown camp were working on the assumption that Blair would announce the candidacy open on 9 May 2007, the day after power-sharing was due to start in [[Northern Ireland]], following which the new Labour leader would be elected on 15 July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labourleadership/story/0,,2062309,00.html?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=11| title = Brown shows his hand to stifle challenge from left| date =21 April 2007 | work =[[The Guardian]] | location=London | first=David | last=Hencke | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Talk of [[David Miliband]], [[Alan Milburn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labourleadership/story/0,,2077454,00.html | title =Blair backs Brown as chancellor launches campaign | author = Deborah Summers and agencies| date =11 May 2007 | work =[[The Guardian]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Clarke]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/04/23/nbrown23.xml

==Demands for Tony Blair to announce a resignation timetable==
{{see also|2006 in the United Kingdom}}
On 15 July 2006, [[John McDonnell (politician)|John McDonnell]] became the first Labour MP to announce an intention to stand for the leadership when Blair resigned.

On 5 September 2006, 17 Labour [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s signed a letter asking Blair to resign, accompanied by press reports alleging that up to 80 MPs were willing to sign. Later, senior party members stated that [[Tony Blair]] would not be Prime Minister at the next Labour Party conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5318354.stm | title =PM gone within year, allies say | date =6 September 2006 | publisher =[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 6 September, [[Tom Watson (Labour politician)|Tom Watson]], one of the MPs who signed the letter, resigned as [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Junior Defence Minister]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5321296.stm | title =In full: MPs call for Blair to go | date =6 September 2006 | publisher =[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; along with seven [[Parliamentary Private Secretary|Parliamentary Private Secretaries]]: [[Khalid Mahmood (politician, born 1961)|Khalid Mahmood]], [[Wayne David]], [[Ian Lucas]], [[Mark Tami]], [[Chris Mole]], [[David Wright (politician)|David Wright]] and [[Iain Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5320760.stm | title =In full: Resignation letters | date =6 September 2006 | publisher =[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 September, [[Jack Straw]] stated that he expected the Prime Minister to announce a timetable for his departure in May 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5322094.stm | title =I will quit within a year – Blair | date =7 September 2006 | publisher =[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Blair announced that the September 2006 Labour Party Conference and [[Trades Union Congress|TUC]] Conference would be the last he would attend as party leader, despite which he was [[Heckler|heckled]] at the [[Trades Union Congress]] on 12 September by members calling for him to resign immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5336884.stm | title =Blair's 'brutal truth' to unions | date =12 September 2006 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 September, John Hutton became the first serving Cabinet Minister to say that [[Gordon Brown]] should face a serious challenger for Labour's leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/5372832.stm | title =Hutton call to 'challenge' Brown | date=23 September 2006 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Labour Party (UK) Conference#2006 Manchester|2006 Labour Party Conference]] on 25 September, Brown announced his candidacy for the leadership,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5376760.stm | title =Brown sets out leadership vision |date=25 September 2006| publisher =[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; while three days later at the same conference [[John Prescott]] announced that he would stand down when Blair resigned as Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5386428.stm | title =Prescott tells Labour: I'm sorry | date = 28 September 2006| publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the debate on [[State Opening of Parliament|The Queen's Speech]] on 15 November, Blair said [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] leader [[David Cameron]] was a "[[flyweight]] against a [[heavyweight]]" at the next general election, widely interpreted as implicit support for Brown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061115/debtext/61115-0005.htm | title =House of Commons Hansard ("Debates") 15 Nov 2006 : Column 27 | date =15 November 2006 | work=Hansard }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaigning commences==
In January 2007, Brown outlined a number of his potential policies for Britain, mentioning citizen responsibility, education, efforts to solve problems in Africa and "a new style of politics" as his priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6238565.stm | title =Brown outlines patriotic vision | date =7 January 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6259131.stm | title =Brown outlines vision for Britain | date =13 January 2007 |publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 January, he spoke of "a new world order" while on a tour of India, and announced backing for India's bid for a place as a permanent member on the [[UN Security Council]], and on many other international bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6269653.stm | title =Brown backs stronger India role | date =17 January 2007 | work [[BBC News]]= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 March, at 12:30&amp;nbsp;pm, he delivered the budget for the 2007–08 financial year, his last budget as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]].

On 16 January, Blair declared his intention to attend a summit of EU leaders as Prime Minister on 21–22 June 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labourleadership/story/0,,1991702,00.html | title =Of course I will stay till June, says Blair | date =16 January 2007 | agency =[[Press Association]] | work =[[The Guardian]] | location=London | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 28 January stated that he was "not finished yet", and intended to complete the public sector reforms he had started, as well as leading Labour into local and devolved Elections on 3 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6307541.stm | title =I am not finished yet, says Blair | date =28 January 2007 | publisher =[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 January, [[left-wing]] MP [[John McDonnell (politician)|John McDonnell]] claimed that support for his leadership challenge had grown to within striking distance of the necessary backing. Michael Meacher, former [[Minister of State|Minister of State for the Environment]] in the [[Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions|DETR]] and its successor [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|Defra]] announced that he was also seeking nominations from MPs and was considering standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labourleadership/story/0,,1992396,00.html | title =Labour rebel claims growing support for leadership bid | author =Hélène Mulholland | date =17 January 2007 | work =[[The Guardian]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 February he became the third Labour MP to announce his intention to stand for the leadership, although critics in the media expressed doubt over the extent of backbench support for either challenger at this point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labourleadership/story/0,,2019175,00.html | title =Left without direction | date =22 February 2007 | publisher =[[BBC News]] | location=London | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 March, [[Jack Straw]] casually declined to run for the leadership after reports that someone had placed a £500 bet on his winning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/article2318734.ece | title =Brown squeezes public sector pay to prepare for Tory battle | author =Colin Brown | date =2 March 2007 | work =[[The Independent]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 March, the Labour Party NEC met to decide on rules for the upcoming leadership elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
| url = http://www.labour.org.uk/nec_reports| title = Labour NEC Reports | date = 20 March 2007| work = [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] website }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 April, Brown met US President [[George W. Bush]] for the first time, in a reportedly amicable discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601102&amp;sid=aN9kLwDL3F3 | title =Gordon Brown 'Got on Very Well' With Bush in First Meeting  | date =15 April 2007 | publisher =[[Bloomberg L.P.]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 April he encouraged rivals to "bring it on", in response to numerous reports suggesting that he would face three or four contenders for the leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/topstories/tm_headline=gang-of-four--&amp;method=full&amp;objectid=18910619&amp;siteid=89520-name_page.html | title=Chancellor tells likely rivals to 'feel free' to stand against him | author =Oonagh Blackman | date =16 April 2007 | work =[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Miliband]] declared on 17 April that he would not be a candidate for the Labour leadership or [[Deputy Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Deputy leadership]], and had not wavered in his position on that issue in the past three years. He subsequently announced his support for Brown in any leadership election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6580589.stm | title= Miliband promises to back Brown | date =22 April 2007| publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 April, ''[[The Independent]]'' reported that many of Blair's closest allies were eager to unite the Blair and Brown camps and prevent any challenge to Gordon Brown from dividing the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/article2465958.ece| title =  Blairites: Clarke challenge could split party| date =20 April 2007 | work =[[The Independent]] | location=London | first1=Colin | last1=Brown | first2=Andrew | last2=Grice | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that 217 MPs had already signed up to back Gordon Brown's leadership. There were also reports that even among the undecided, many were keen to prevent the progress of Michael Meacher and John McDonnell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labourleadership/story/0,,2062309,00.html| title = Brown shows his hand to stifle challenge from left| date =21 April 2007 | work =[[The Guardian]] | location=London | first=David | last=Hencke | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 April, [[Michael Meacher]] and [[John McDonnell (politician)|John McDonnell]] agreed that whichever had fewer supporters the day after Blair resigned as Labour leader would step aside, to allow the other a stronger chance to secure the support of the 45 MPs necessary to qualify for the ballot paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6598683.stm | title=Left rivals unite to target Brown| date=27 April 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 May, Blair announced that he would announce his resignation as Labour leader the following week, following which he expected a campaign of about seven weeks. He also announced his support for Brown to succeed him as Labour leader and Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6610623.stm | title =Brown to be PM 'in weeks' – Blair| publisher=[[BBC News]] | date =1 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 May, the day after Blair and Brown's tenth anniversary as Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer, elections were held for [[UK local elections, 2007|English and Scottish Local Government]], [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007|the Scottish Parliament]] and [[Welsh Assembly election, 2007|the Welsh Assembly]]. Labour faced mixed results, making gains in some areas, with slightly higher support than the previous year in the Local Elections and fairly minimal losses in the devolved elections, remaining the largest party in Wales and having one less seat than the SNP in Scotland, while losing many English council seats, mainly to the Conservative Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk_politics/2007/election_2007/default.stm | title = Election 2007 | date =4 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 May, [[Charles Clarke]] changed his position towards Brown, praising him publicly and denying that he was poised to challenge for the Labour leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.politics.co.uk/news/features/labour-leadership/clarke-rules-out-leadership-with-praise-brown-$472810.htm  | title = Clarke rules out leadership with praise for Brown | date =3 May 2007 | publisher=Politics.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[The Times]]'' the following day, he claimed that he could get a sufficient number of nominations to stand for the Labour leadership, but that the Labour Party did not "have the appetite" for such a contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6627153.stm  | title = Clarke 'will not challenge Brown' | date =4 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; John Reid and John Hutton also announced their support for Brown, Reid going on to announce that he would be stepping down as Home Secretary upon the departure of Blair and Prescott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/politics.cfm?id=700982007 | archive-url =https://archive.is/20120713205606/http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/politics.cfm?id=700982007 | dead-url =yes | archive-date =13 July 2012 | title =Reid gives Brown clear run to No 10 | date =6 May 2007 | work =[[Scotland on Sunday]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6629877.stm  | title = Reid to quit as home secretary | date =6 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the ''[[News of the World]]'' on 6 May, Blair said that while [[David Cameron]] had learned the tactics of opposition, Labour could still win the next General Election and that Brown had shown sound judgement in his steering of the economy, which was the way to win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/blair_0605.shtml  | title = Tony Blair Writes Exclusively for the News of the World | author=Tony Blair | date =6 May 2007 | work =[[News of the World]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 May, in the last Prime Minister's Questions before Blair announced the vacancy for the Labour leadership, [[David Cameron]] described the Labour government as "like [[Living Dead|The Living Dead]]". Blair ignored Cameron's taunts regarding the possible chaos caused by interim arrangements for election of a new Labour leader and the upcoming resignation of John Reid from the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6638569.stm | title =PMQs: The living dead clash | date = 9 May 2007| publisher=[[BBC News]]| first=Nick | last=Assinder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tony Blair asks Labour NEC to seek a new leader==
On 10 May Blair announced to the [[Sedgefield (UK Parliament constituency)|Sedgefield]] Labour Party that he would stand down as Prime Minister on 27 June 2007, and that he would be requesting Labour's NEC to seek a new party leader. Shortly afterwards, [[John Prescott]] announced that he would stand down as Deputy Prime Minister on the same day and that he had written to the NEC to announce his resignation as party Deputy Leader. Labour's NEC met on 13 May to finalise a timetable for the handover, confirming that Blair would remain leader until a new leader was elected, and giving any potential candidates three active Parliament days in which to submit their papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6639945.stm | title =Blair will stand down on 27 June | date =10 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6642805.stm | title =Prescott to quit as deputy leader | date =10 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6633989.stm | title =Q&amp;A: Blair's exit plans | date =11 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown, Michael Meacher and John McDonnell held a joint policy debate in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://news.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=738472007 | title =Campaigning Brown offers vision of NHS | date =12 May 2007 | work =[[The Scotsman]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 May, [[John McDonnell (politician)|John McDonnell]] and [[Michael Meacher]] delayed a decision over which one should run, describing their respective levels of support as "too close to call".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6642331.stm | title =Brown rivals delay bid decision | date =10 May 2007 | work=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interviewed by ''[[Red Pepper (magazine)|Red Pepper]]'', John McDonnell stated that he could and would not support Michael Meacher, since he had voted with [[New Labour]] on many issues, and that it was a matter of them sitting down together to compare how many votes they had and decide a way forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.tni.org/detail_page.phtml?act_id=16809 | title =Challenging Brown from the Left? Meacher and McDonnell interviewed | author = Oscar Reyes | date =11 May 2007 | work =[[Red Pepper (magazine)|Red Pepper]] | publisher = [[Transnational Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 May [[Michael Meacher]] declared that he would not be a candidate in the Labour leadership election, since he did not have enough MPs support to get onto the ballot paper, going on to say he would be backing [[John McDonnell (politician)|John McDonnell]] to get a left-wing candidate onto the ballot paper, though the possibility of this was still in doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6652651.stm | title =Johnson doubts Brown challenger | date =15 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 May, [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]] [[Peter Hain]] and [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]] [[Harriet Harman]] both announced that they had more than the minimum necessary number of nominations to appear on the Ballot paper for the Deputy Leadership Election, claiming 47 and 44 nominations respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://politics.guardian.co.uk/deputyleader/story/0,,2076881,00.html | title =Hain and Harman claim places on deputy ballot | date =10 May 2007 | work =[[The Guardian]] | location=London | first=David | last=Hencke | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership elections==
As nominations opened on 15 May it became clear that Brown was well past the minimum requirement of nominations, with the support of around 282 MPs, while John McDonnell had only 27 nominations, still well short of the 45 required. In the Deputy Leadership Race, Harriet Harman, Hazel Blears, Peter Hain and Alan Johnson all had more than the minimum required nominations, with [[Jon Cruddas]] having 44 nominations and Hilary Benn 34.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/UKNews1/idUKL1464496220070515 | title =McDonnell short for leadership race | date =15 May 2007 | agency =[[Reuters]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 May John McDonnell alleged that many of Brown's supporters were using wrecking tactics to ensure that the decision did not proceed to a ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labourleadership/story/0,,2081121,00.html | title=Brown trying to prevent contest, claims McDonnell | date =16 May 2007 | work =[[The Guardian]] | location=London | first=Hélène | last=Mulholland | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day Brown secured 308 nominations, to John McDonnell's 29; although nominations were to be open for another day there were insufficient undeclared MPs remaining for anyone except Gordon Brown to be on the ballot, meaning he need only attend [[husting]]s and wait to be declared leader by the NEC. At this stage John McDonnell conceded defeat. In the Deputy Leadership Race, Jon Cruddas and Hilary Benn secured the required nominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6660565.stm | title =Brown will enter No 10 unopposed | date =16 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6663653.stm | title =Deputy hopefuls make their case | date =16 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nominations closed on 17 May, with Brown having secured 313 nominations compared to John McDonnell's 29. [[Harriet Harman]] (65 nominations), [[Hazel Blears]] (49 nominations), [[Peter Hain]] (51 nominations), [[Alan Johnson]] (73 nominations), [[Jon Cruddas]] (49 nominations) and [[Hilary Benn]] (47 nominations) all qualified to appear on the Deputy leadership ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6457597.stm | title =Labour leader election timetable | date =9 May 2007 | publisher =[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.labour.org.uk/leadership/nominations_close_-_1230_thursday_17_may | title =Labour leadership, close of nominations | date =17 May 2007 | work =[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] website | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070921050327/http://www.labour.org.uk/leadership/nominations_close_-_1230_thursday_17_may | archivedate =21 September 2007 | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the husting at the [[University of Warwick]] on 20 May, Brown was heckled regarding the [[Iraq War|2003 War in Iraq]]. He replied by saying that although there had been mistakes, it had been the right thing to do. Candidates for the Deputy Leadership election were asked which factors they considered important to the next General Election. Jon Cruddas named the issue of insecurity at work; Hilary Benn said that more housing was needed; Peter Hain described inequality as "the biggest challenge we face as a government"; Alan Johnson focused on social mobility; Hazel Blears mentioned education and employment opportunities; Harriet Harman said that Labour needed to "win back the trust and the confidence of the British people" and emphasised the importance of policy implementation. Blears, Harman and Benn all focused on the importance of party unity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.labour.org.uk/leadership/hustings | title =Leadership Contest hustings | work =[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] website }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6673719.stm | title =Iraq decision was right – Brown | date=20 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Bradford husting on 27 May, [[Jan Wilson]], leader of [[Sheffield City Council]], told Gordon Brown that the shadow of Iraq hung over the party and that Brown had had an easy time on it during the leadership campaign. Brown said he was happy to discuss the decision to remove the Ba'athist regime, but that his priority now was to focus on the next steps, with numbers of UK troops decreasing and UK forces taking an "overwatch role".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6696993.stm | title =Brown warned on 'shadow' of Iraq | date=27 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the BAME ([[Black people|black]], [[British Asian|Asian]] and [[Minority group|minority ethnic]]) husting in [[Leicester]] on 30 May, Deputy Leadership candidates were split on the question of whether there should be all-ethnic minority shortlists; Hazel Blears, Jon Cruddas and Peter Hain all backed the idea, to increase numbers of Black and Asian MPs. Alan Johnson said that shortlists could reflect a need for more ethnic minority MPs, but that he was not sure that all-minority shortlists were the answer, and Hilary Benn said that he was not persuaded of the case for such shortlists either. [[Harriet Harman]] made no comment on the issue, except to say that there needed to be more MPs from ethnic minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6706499.stm | title =MP shortlists divide candidates | date=31 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 June, ballot papers were sent out to Labour MPs, Labour MEPs, Labour Party members and members of affiliated unions for the position of Deputy Leader of the Labour Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6457597.stm | title = Labour leader election timetable| date =14 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Cardiff]] husting on 9 June, Brown described the Conservatives as caught between "what they think they should say" and "what they really believe". He accused them of being obsessed with [[Grammar school]]s, and said that parts of the Conservative Party wanted to scrap the [[National Health Service|NHS]].  He associated himself with decisions taken over the war in Iraq again, saying again that although mistakes had been made it had been the right thing to do. He also pledged that if necessary he would find more money to prevent job losses at [[Remploy]], a provider of jobs for the disabled, and that promises made at the G8 summit to tackle [[poverty in Africa]] would be kept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6737257.stm | title =Brown taunts Tories over grammars | date=9 June 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Oxford]] Youth husting (for people under the age of 27) on 10 June, Gordon Brown said that Labour must modernise and reform again to further involve young people in decision making, including the use of online facilities such as MySpace. Hilary Benn was critical of [[Bob Geldof]] and defended the settlement of the recent G8 Summit in Germany, while Hazel Blears focused on anti-social behaviour. Peter Hain accused [[Home Secretary]] John Reid of "fanning up" the previous week's debate over possible introduction of new stop and search powers for police, saying "I don't believe in macho posturing on law and order and terrorism". Harriet Harman said that she felt the law needed changing to ensure that the government was informed if terrorist suspects en route to other countries faced the possibility of torture on arrival, and Jon Cruddas focused heavily on allegations of [[Extraordinary rendition|special rendition]] of terrorist suspects to [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]].  Alan Johnson stated the need for testing in schools to assess how well schools and individual pupils were doing; Jon Cruddas agreed but said he felt that it had gone too far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6738823.stm | title =Brown says Labour must modernise | date=10 June 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Deputy Leadership Ballot closed at 17:00 UTC+1 on 22 June. Brown was declared leader at a special conference on 24 June, while in an election on the [[Instant-runoff voting|Alternative Vote]] system, [[Harriet Harman]] won the Deputy Leadership by 50.4% to [[Alan Johnson]]'s 49.6% after preferences were re-distributed, Jon Cruddas coming narrowly third. Harman had been behind until the last round of redistributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6234692.stm | title =Harman wins deputy leader contest | date=24 June 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://politics.guardian.co.uk/deputyleader/story/0,,1974851,00.html | title = Deputy leadership contest: the rules explained| author =Hélène Mulholland | date =18 December 2006 | work = [[The Guardian]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transition to Prime Minister Gordon Brown==
[[Tony Blair]] tendered his resignation as Prime Minister to the Queen on 27 June 2007 and [[Gordon Brown]] was asked by the Queen to form a new government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6245682.stm | title =Brown is UK's new prime minister | publisher =BBC News | date=27 June 2007 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Blair with [[John Prescott]], Brown opted to keep his new deputy, [[Harriet Harman]], out of the position of [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]].

'''Timothy Daniel Sullivan''' (July 23, 1862 – August 31, 1913) was a New York politician who controlled [[Manhattan]]'s [[Bowery, Manhattan|Bowery]] and [[Lower East Side]] districts as a prominent leader within [[Tammany Hall]]. He was euphemistically known as "Dry Dollar", as the "Big Feller", and, later, as "Big Tim" (because of his physical stature). He amassed a large fortune as a businessman running vaudeville and legitimate theaters, as well as nickelodeons, race tracks and athletic clubs. Sullivan in 1911 pushed through the legislature the [[Sullivan Act]], an early [[gun control]] measure. He was a strong supporter of [[organized labor]] and [[women's suffrage]].  The newspapers depicted Big Tim as the spider in the center of the web, overstating his criminal activities and his control over gambling in the city.  Welch says that, "assigning the role of vice lord to Sullivan gave Tammany's enemies a weapon to be wielded in every municipal election between 1886 and 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Richard F, Welch,  ''King of the Bowery '' p 107&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Larry Mulligan and Timothy Sullivan.jpg|left|thumb|Larry Mulligan and Tim Sullivan (right)]] 
He was born in the slum of [[Five Points, Manhattan|Five Points]] to Daniel O. Sullivan and his wife Catherine Connelly (or Conley), immigrants from [[Kenmare]], [[County Kerry]], Ireland. His father, a Union veteran of the [[American Civil War]], died of Typhus in October 1867 at age thirty-six, leaving his wife to care for their four children. Three years later, Catherine Sullivan married again  to an alcoholic laborer of Irish descent named Lawrence Mulligan, having six children by him.&lt;ref&gt;Records, Mulligan, Lawrence &amp; Catherine, Transfiguration Church, 29 Mott Street, New York City, May 1869. See also:  Schedule 1, "Inhabitants in the 6th District, 6th Ward in the County of New York," p. 11. Census, New York City 1870, 6th Ward.&lt;/ref&gt;

At age eight, Tim Sullivan began shining shoes and selling newspapers on [[Park Row (Manhattan)|Park Row]] in lower [[Manhattan]]. By his mid-twenties, he was the part or full owner of six saloons, which was the career of choice for aspiring politicians. Sullivan attracted the attention of local politicians, notably [[Thomas "Fatty" Walsh]], a prominent [[Tammany Hall]] ward leader and father of stage actress [[Blanche Walsh]].

In 1886, Sullivan married Helen Fitzgerald. He gradually began building one of the most powerful [[political machine]]s, which would control virtually all jobs and vice below 14th Street in Manhattan. His base was his headquarters at 207 Bowery. By 1892, Tammany Hall leader [[Richard Croker]] appointed Sullivan leader of his assembly district of the [[Lower East Side]].

==Political career==
Sullivan was a member of the [[New York State Assembly]] (New York Co., 2nd D.) in [[110th New York State Legislature|1887]], [[111th New York State Legislature|1888]], [[112th New York State Legislature|1889]], [[113th New York State Legislature|1890]], [[114th New York State Legislature|1891]], [[115th New York State Legislature|1892]] and [[116th New York State Legislature|1893]].

He was a member of the [[New York State Senate]] from 1894 to 1902, sitting in the [[117th New York State Legislature|117th]], [[118th New York State Legislature|118th]] (both 9th D.), [[119th New York State Legislature|119th]], [[120th New York State Legislature|120th]], [[121st New York State Legislature|121st]], [[122nd New York State Legislature|122nd]], [[123rd New York State Legislature|123rd]], [[124th New York State Legislature|124th]] and [[125th New York State Legislature]]s (all seven 11th D.).

He was elected as a Democrat to the [[58th United States Congress|58th]] and [[59th United States Congress]]es, holding office from March 4, 1903, until his resignation on July 27, 1906. According to some accounts, Sullivan was dissatisfied with the graft and anonymity of Washington political life, prompting his resignation. he was quoted as saying, "There's nothing in this Congressman business.  They know 'em in Washington.  The people down there use 'em as hitchin'-posts.  Every time they see a Congressman on the streets they tie their horses to him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=MacNeil |first=Neil|date=1963 |title= Forge of Democracy: The House of Representatives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3AmJAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22timothy%22+%22sullivan%22+%22every+time+they+see+a+congressman%22&amp;dq=%22timothy%22+%22sullivan%22+%22every+time+they+see+a+congressman%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIxomRh56TxwIVCz8-Ch1sGw6v |location=New York, NY |publisher=David McKay Company |page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was again a member of the State Senate (12th D.) from 1909 to 1912, sitting in the [[132nd New York State Legislature|132nd]], [[133rd New York State Legislature|133rd]], [[134th New York State Legislature|134th]] and [[135th New York State Legislature]]s. In November 1912, he was elected to the [[63rd United States Congress]] but, due to ill health, did not take his seat, and died a few months into his term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Carlebach |first=Michael |date=2011 |title=Bain's New York: The City in News Pictures 1900-1925 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Rr2lvoFsAQC&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=%22timothy%22+%22sullivan%22+%22congress%22+%221912%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBWoVChMIo9rXkp-TxwIVxRw-Ch39-wC2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22timothy%22%20%22sullivan%22%20%22congress%22%20%221912%22&amp;f=false |location=Mineola, NY |publisher=Dover Publications, Inc. |page=179 |isbn=978-0-4864-7858-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It could be said that Sullivan was one of the earliest political reformers, since he was aligned with women's rights activist [[Frances Perkins]] and sponsored legislation limiting the maximum number of hours women were forced to work, improving the conditions of stable and delivery horses and the [[Sullivan Law]], city [[gun control]] legislation.&lt;ref&gt;3Chapter 195, "An Act to Amend the [New York State] Penal Law in Relation to the Sale and Carrying of Dangerous Weapons." May 1911. See also: "Suffragists Cheer Big Tim Sullivan..." New York Times, March 31, 1912. C6. For a listing of Sullivan's legislative activity, see: New York Legislative Index, 1909-1912. (New York State Library, Albany)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise to power in Tammany Hall==

Attendance averaged 9,000 patrons a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/21704|title=Dewey Theatre|work=Cinema Treasures|accessdate=March 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]Despite his political and criminal activities, Sullivan was undeniably a successful businessman involved in [[real estate]], theatrical ventures (at one point partnering with [[Marcus Loew]]), boxing and horseracing.&lt;ref&gt;For background about Sullivan's theatrical interests see: {{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4742765/sullivan_and_krauss_to_open_dewey/|title=Plan for a 'Dewey Theatre'|work=New York Times|date=July 1, 1898|page=7|accessdate=March 25, 2016|via=newspapers.com}} {{cite web|url=http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2018/New%20York%20NY%20Morning%20Telegraph/New%20York%20NY%20Morning%20Telegraph%201903/New%20York%20NY%20Morning%20Telegraph%201903%20-%200405.pdf|title=For a New Theatre in Second Avenue|work=[New York] Morning Telegraph|date=January 26, 1903|page=7|accessdate=June 23, 2013}} {{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4742554/sullivan_rto_open_the_eagle_theatre_in/|title=Sullivan's New Theatre|newspaper='New York Times|date=October 22, 1903|p=9|accessdate=March 26, 2016|via=newspapers.com}} ''Variety'', March 13, 1914, 5; ''Variety'', March 27, 1914, 5; ''Variety'', April 3, 1914, 1; ''Variety'', December 14, 1907, p. 10.

(Westport, CT. 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with various other Sullivans, Big Tim also branched out into popular amusement venues such as [[Dreamland (amusement park)|Dreamland]] in Coney Island, where he installed a distant relative, Dennis, as the political leader.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis, ("Flatnose Denny) was a brother of U.S. Rep. Christopher D. Sullivan. The former, a one-time police detective, was murdered on the Coney Island boardwalk in June 1922, see "Dinnie" Sullivan Slain by Blackjack, New York Times, 21 June 1922, 1. For additional information on the Sullivan clan, see: "Little Tim Dead at Forty." New York Times, December 23, 1909. 1. See also: "Sullivan is Last of a Famous Line, New York Times, August 3, 1937; "Sullivans and Tammany." New York Times, August 6, 1942. Editorial&lt;/ref&gt;  Sullivan, whose control extended to illegal [[boxing|prizefights]] through the [[National Athletic Club]], influenced the [[New York State Legislature]] to legalize boxing in 1896 before ring deaths and other scandals caused the law's repeal four years later.

Among other laws he helped pass was the [[Sullivan Act]], a state law that required a permit to carry or own a concealed weapon, which eventually became law on May 29, 1911.  Upon first passage, the Sullivan Act required licenses for New Yorkers to possess firearms small enough to be concealed. Possession of such firearms without a license was a misdemeanor, and carrying them was a felony. However, with many residents unable to afford the $3 registration fee issued by the corrupt New York Police Department, his bodyguards could be legally armed while using the law against their political opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Czitrom, Dan. Underworld and Underdogs: Big Tim Sullivan and Metropolitan Politics in New York, 1889-1913. Journal of American History. 78.2. (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

He was extremely popular among his constituents.  In the hot summer months, [[tenement]] dwellers would be feted to steamboat excursions and picnics to College Point in Queens or New Jersey. In the winter months, the Sullivan machine doled out food, coal and clothing to his constituents. On the anniversary of his mother's birthday, February 6, Sullivan dispensed shoes to needy tenement dwellers. The annual Christmas Dinners were a particularly notable event covered in all of the city papers.&lt;ref&gt;"Fed by Senator Sullivan: Three Thousand Bowery Lodging House Men his Guests." New York Times, December 26, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he had a loyal following, his involvement in organized crime and political protection of street gangs and vice districts would remain a source of controversy throughout his career.

==Electoral fraud==
Sullivan was an expert in using electoral fraud to retain his power. In a quid pro quo arrangement, constituents voted the way that they were instructed. In return, they were the recipients of Tammany largesse which included coal in the winter, clambakes and outings in the summer, jobs on the city payroll and all-around assistance. In 1892 when his pct went 395 to 4 for [[Grover Cleveland]] over [[Benjamin Harrison]] in the presidential election he said, "Harrison got one...more vote than I expected, but I'll find that feller!" His most common tactic, with no voter ID, was to use "repeaters." Here's how he described it, "When you've voted'em with their whiskers on you take'em to a barber and scrap off the chin-fringe. Then you vote'em again with side lilacs and a mustache. Then to a barber again, off comes the sides and you vote'em a third time with the mustache. If that ain't enough, and the box can stand a few more ballots, clean off the mustache and vote'em plain face. That makes every one of 'em good for four votes." (Rothstein by David Pietrusza. Pgs 53-55.)

==Involvement in criminal activity==
During the turn of the century, he would develop contacts with many influential figures including [[Monk Eastman]], [[Paul Kelly (criminal)|Paul Kelly]], [[Arnold Rothstein]] and disgraced NYPD Lieutenant [[Charles Becker]], who was able to attain the latter a high-ranking position on the New York police force in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Logan, Andy. Against the Evidence: The Becker-Rosenthal Affair. London: Weidenfeld, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

A close associate of [[Charles Francis Murphy]], who succeeded the exiled [[Richard Croker]] as head of Tammany Hall in May 1902, the two forced corrupt police chief [[William Stephen Devery]] out of Tammany's Executive Committee as part of Murphy's campaign to eliminate any direct links between vice districts and Tammany Hall.

However, Sullivan was allowed to keep his [[kickbacks]] from the Lower East Side and [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]] as a means of keeping him from becoming Murphy's political rival (he had used his considerable political influence from keeping Croker's reform group, the ''Committee of Five'', out of the Bowery only two years before). In exchange, Sullivan would have to furnish gang leaders [[Monk Eastman]] and [[Paul Kelly (criminal)|Paul Kelly]], amongst others, to commit [[election fraud]] on behalf of Tammany Hall.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', September 17, 1903, p. 8; ''New York Times'', September 20, 1903, 1. See also: Humbert s. Nelli. The Business of Crime: Italian and Syndicate Crime in the United States. New York, 1976. 101-140&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, it was widely known that Sullivan and his subordinates were active in a number of illegal activities including prostitution, gambling and extortion. A number of these revelations came to light in the New York State [[Lexow Committee]] hearings as well as through the investigations of the Rev. [[Charles Henry Parkhurst]].&lt;ref&gt;Clarence Lexow, Report and Proceedings of the Senate Committee Appointed to Investigate the Police Department of the City of New York, 5 vols. Albany, 1895.

==Later years==
Suffering from [[tertiary syphilis]] during his later years, his health continued to deteriorate until he was judged mentally incompetent and finally committed to a sanitarium in 1912. According to the Incompetency hearings, Sullivan elicited paranoid [[delusions]], believed he was being spied upon and his food was being poisoned.&lt;ref&gt;New York State Supreme Court, "In the Matter of the Application for the Appointment of a Committee of the Person and Property of Timothy D. Sullivan." January 24, 1913&lt;/ref&gt;  On January 12, 1913, the New York Sun reported in a prominent page two article that he was mourned after being committed, "beyond cure" (without naming illness), suffering from "religious mania".

After nearly a year, he managed to escape from his brother's house after eluding nurses on the early morning of August 31 (although other accounts claim he had escaped from orderlies after an all-night card game). Within a few hours, his body was found on the tracks in the Eastchester area of the Bronx, New York.

Sullivan's family did not report him missing for more than ten days, and his body was brought, and held, at the local Fordham morgue. Finally, after a fortnight, Sullivan was classified as a vagrant and scheduled for burial in [[Potter's field|Potter's Field]] despite his tailored clothing and "TDS" diamond monogrammed cufflinks.

Just before removal, his body was finally recognized by Police Officer Peter Purfield, who was assigned to the morgue detail. ([[The New York Times]] later speculated that Sullivan might have been killed and placed on the tracks. In fact, the engineer of the train that struck Sullivan stated that he thought the body was already deceased. And, adding to the speculation of foul play, Thomas Reigelmann, the [[Bronx]] coroner and Tammany political appointee who signed the death certificate, failed to recognize the body of his longtime friend despite the lack of trauma to the decedent's face.)&lt;ref&gt;''New York World'', "Says Blackjack May have Killed Big Tim Sullivan," November 18, 1914, 1; ''New York Times'', September 10, 1913, 1; ''New York Times'', September 11, 1913, 4; ''New York Times'', September 14, 1913, 1; ''New York World'', September 10, 1913, 3. "Bureau to Identify Bodies Will be Established as a Result of Sullivan Case." ''New York Times''. September 27, 1913&lt;/ref&gt;

Sullivan's wake was held at his clubhouse, located at 207 [[Bowery]] and over 25,000&amp;nbsp;people turned out for his funeral at [[St. Patrick's Old Cathedral, New York]] on Mott Street.  He was interred in [[Calvary Cemetery, Queens]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;Records of Calvary and Allied Cemeteries, Woodside, NY. Section 9, Plot 197, Graves 1-9.  See also: [http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/sullivan8.html#R9M0JEFW0] and [https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/12804274], keyword: Sullivan, Timothy D.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next seven or eight years, there was a protracted battle over Sullivan's estate, which, by some estimates, ranged as high as $2.5&amp;nbsp;million.  After creditors were satisfied, the bulk of the assets went to Sullivan's full siblings, Patrick H., Mary Anne, and half-brother, Lawrence Mulligan.  (For several years after Big Tim's death, Patrick H. Sullivan attempted to maintain his late brother's political and criminal clout. However, he proved to be an ineffectual leader and requitted himself from politics to pursue real estate ventures).&lt;ref&gt;"Depose (P.H.) Sullivan as Bowery Leader."  ''New York Times'', February 16, 1916. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sullivan had one child with his wife Helen, a daughter who died in infancy.
He did, however, father at least six illegitimate children, many with actresses affiliated with his theatrical ventures, two of whom were [[Christie MacDonald]] and [[Elsie Janis]].&lt;ref&gt;Aida Sullivan, rumored to be Big Tim's natural daughter, was formally adopted by the Sullivans from the New York Foundling Hospital in 1894. She ultimately received a $50,000 life insurance policy from the Sullivan estate. See: "Says She Will Sue: Miss Sullivan Asserts Big Tim Made a Will Providing for Her."  ''New York Times'', September 18, 1913, 2.  Sullivan's had another daughter, Margaret Catherine, born to Margaret A. Holland, who received a $50,000 life insurance policy from his estate. See, New York World, December 10, 1913, 1; New York Tribune, December 10, 1913&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
He was portrayed by [[Joseph Sullivan (actor)|Joseph Sullivan]] in the 1914 [[silent film]] ''The Life of Big Tim Sullivan; Or, From Newsboy to Senator'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://imdb.com/title/tt0004222/ IMDB]&lt;/ref&gt;  one of the earliest people to be the subject of a [[biographical film]]. He was also a main character in Kevin Baker's novel ''[[Dreamland (Kevin Baker)|Dreamland]]'', about life in turn-of-the-century New York, set in part in the [[Coney Island]] amusement park of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of Big Tim Sullivan; Or, From Newsboy to Senator''. Gotham Film Co., 1914. Sullivan left no diaries and very few private letters. Autobiographical materials comes largely through his own statements in the press of his era.&lt;/ref&gt;

On film himself, Sullivan appeared in a silent short ''Actors' Fund Field Day'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0239211/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ''Actors' Fund Field Day''; IMDb.com]&lt;/ref&gt; a 1910 short film denoting  an actors' fundraising. Sullivan more than likely knew many of the persons in the film.

'''Voter suppression''' is a strategy to influence the outcome of an [[election]] by discouraging or preventing specific groups of people from [[voting]]. It is distinguished from [[political campaigning]] in that campaigning attempts to change likely voting behavior by changing the opinions of potential voters through persuasion and organization. Voter suppression, instead, attempts to reduce the number of voters who might vote against a candidate or proposition.

The tactics of voter suppression range from minor changes to make voting less convenient,  to physically intimidating and even physically attacking prospective voters, which is illegal. Voter suppression can be effective if a significant number of voters are intimidated or disenfranchised.&lt;ref name="Powers"&gt;{{cite news | last = Powers | first = Scott |author2=David Damron | title =Analysis: 201,000 in Florida didn't vote because of long lines | newspaper = [[Orlando Sentinel]] | location = Orlando, FL | date = January 29, 2013 | url =http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2013-01-29/business/os-voter-lines-statewide-20130118_1_long-lines-sentinel-analysis-state-ken-detzner | accessdate = 2016-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Shelby v. Holder]]'' that voting laws had resulted in voter suppression and discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/voting-rights-act-harry-reid-senate-93344.html|title=Harry Reid: Senate 'will act' on Voting Rights Act|last=Van Dongen|first=Rachel|date=25 June 2013|accessdate=5 July 2013|newspaper=Politico|author2=Everett, Burgess}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Australia===
In Australia, it is mandatory for citizens to enroll to vote and it is their responsibility to update their enrollment when they change their address. Even so, it is estimated that about 6% of eligible Australian voters are not enrolled, or are enrolled incorrectly. These are disproportionately younger voters, many of whom might neglect to enroll when they attain [[voting age]].

In 2006, the [[Howard Government]] legislated to close the electoral roll much earlier once an election was called. While previously, voters had been allowed seven days of grace after an election had been called to arrange or update their enrollment, new voters were now allowed only until 8:00 pm on the day that the electoral [[Writ of election|writ]] was issued to lodge their enrollment form, while those who needed to update their addresses were allowed three days. In Australia, the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] effectively has the right to determine the date of the election, so long as constitutional rules regarding the maximum term of the parliament are adhered to. This measure was therefore likely to result in many newer voters being precluded from voting in the first election for which they were eligible because the time to arrange their enrollment once an election is called had been greatly reduced.

The measure was widely seen as an attempt at voter suppression aimed at younger voters,&lt;ref&gt;Orr, Graeme [http://inside.org.au/court-by-surprise-the-high-court-upholds-voting-rights/ "Court by surprise: the High Court upholds voting rights"], 6 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; who surveys had shown are more likely than the general population to vote for the then opposition, the [[Australian Labor Party]], or the [[Australian Greens|Greens]].&lt;ref&gt;Brooker, Ron [http://resources.news.com.au/files/2011/07/22/1226099/942923-aus-file-young-voters.pdf "Youth Federal Election Voting Intentions: A Statistical and Graphical Analysis of Newspoll Quarterly Data 1996–2010"], The Whitlam Institute, June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Government denied that they were trying to suppress some voters, insisting that the purpose of the reform was to smooth the administration of elections and to reduce the possibility of electoral fraud. This was in spite of the fact that the [[Australian Electoral Commission]] had requested no such reform, there was no evidence of significant electoral fraud and that the Australian Electoral Commission had been dealing with hundreds of thousands of late enrollments without significant problems for decades.

In July 2010, the [[Left-wing politics|left-leaning]] lobby group [[GetUp!]] launched a challenge to this law. The [[High Court of Australia]] expedited the hearing so that a ruling could be made in time for the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 federal election]]. The majority ruling struck down early closing of the roll, reinstating the old rule allowing voters seven days grace to arrange or update their enrollment.

Australian citizens of the ages 16 or 17 can enroll online&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aec.gov.au/enrol/ enroll online]&lt;/ref&gt; so that when they turn 18 they are able to vote.

=== Canada ===
Shortly before the [[Canadian federal election, 2011|Canadian 2011 Federal Election]], vote suppression tactics were [[2011 Canadian federal election voter suppression scandal|exercised by issuing robocalls and live calls to notify voters]] that their polling station had changed. The locations offered by these messages were intentionally false, often to lead voters several hours from the correct stations, and often identified themselves illegally as coming from [[Elections Canada]].&lt;ref name="canconrobocall"&gt;{{cite news
  | title =Robocalls complaints came 3 days before 2011 election

  | accessdate = 2012-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In litigation brought by [[The Council of Canadians]], a federal court found that such fraud had occurred and had probably been perpetrated by someone with access to the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]]'s voter database, including its information about voter preferences.&lt;ref name="MacCharles"&gt;{{cite news | last = MacCharles| first = Tonda| title = Robocalls: Widespread but ‘thinly scattered’ vote suppression didn’t affect election, judge rules| newspaper = [[Toronto Star]] | date = May 23, 2013 | url = https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2013/05/23/robocalls_widespread_but_thinly_scattered_vote_suppression_didnt_affect_election_judge_rules.html | accessdate = 2013-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The court stated that the evidence did not prove that the Conservative Party or its successful candidates were directly involved.&lt;ref name="MacCharles"/&gt;  It did, however, criticize the Conservative Party for making “little effort to assist with the investigation”.&lt;ref name="MacCharles"/&gt;  The court did not annul the result in any of six [[Electoral district (Canada)|ridings]] where the fraud had occurred, because it concluded that the number of votes affected had been too small to affect the outcome.&lt;ref name="MacCharles"/&gt;

===United Kingdom===
[[Lutfur Rahman (politician)|Lutfur Rahman]] was the [[directly elected mayor of Tower Hamlets]], in London until he was removed from office for breaching electoral rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tower Hamlets election fraud mayor Lutfur Rahman removed from office|work=[[BBC News]]|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-32428648|date=23 April 2015|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His supporters allegedly intimidated voters at polling stations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/23/tower-hamlets-mayor-lutfur-rahman-found-guilty-of-electoral&lt;/ref&gt;

Current proposals by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] to require one of several forms of expensive photo-ID in order to vote are likely to reduce the turnout of young and poor voters more likely to vote Labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news||title=Electoral Reform Society letter calls the move 'disproportionate'|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/06/voter-id-trials-risk-disenfranchising-vulnerable-people|date=6 March 2018|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main article|Voter suppression in the United States}}
In the [[United States]], elections are administered locally, and forms of voter suppression vary among jurisdictions. At the founding of the country, the right to vote in most states was limited to property-owning white males.&lt;ref name="Carroll2003"&gt;Bret Carroll.

In 2013, discriminatory [[voter ID laws]] arose following the Supreme Court's decision to strike down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, which some argue amount to voter suppression among African-Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Childress|first1=Sarah|title=With Voting Rights Act Out, States Push Voter ID Laws|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/with-voting-rights-act-out-states-push-voter-id-laws/|work=FRONTLINE|publisher=PBS|date=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Childress|first1=Sarah|title=Supreme Court Strikes Blow to Voting Rights Act: What's Next?|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/supreme-court-strikes-blow-to-voting-rights-act-whats-next/|work=FRONTLINE|publisher=PBS|date=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, federal judges have overturned voting restrictions in several states on the grounds that they were intentionally discriminatory. In North Carolina, Republican lawmakers requested data on various voting practices, broken down by race. They then passed laws that restricted voting and registration in five different ways, all of which disproportionately affected African Americans. Among other things, they cut back on early voting.&lt;ref name="wpnc"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=July 29, 2016 |title=Appeals court strikes down North Carolina’s voter-ID law |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/appeals-court-strikes-down-north-carolinas-voter-id-law/2016/07/29/810b5844-4f72-11e6-aa14-e0c1087f7583_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the North Carolina GOP sent out a press release celebrating the decline in early voting by African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=NBC News |date=November 7, 2017 |title=Black Turnout Down in North Carolina After Cuts to Early Voting |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/2016-election-day/black-turnout-down-north-carolina-after-cuts-early-voting-n679051}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Mother Jones |date=November 7, 2016 |title=North Carolina GOP Brags About How Few Black People Were Able to Vote Early |url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/11/north-carolina-gop-brags-about-how-few-black-people-were-able-vote-early/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Texas, a voter ID law requiring a driver's license, passport, military identification, or gun permit, was repeatedly found to be intentionally discriminatory. The state's election laws could be put back under the control of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). Under Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions]], however, the DOJ has expressed support for Texas's ID law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=The Atlantic |date=August 24, 2017 |title=A Court Strikes Down Texas's Voter ID Law For the Fifth Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sessions was accused by [[Coretta Scott King]] in 1986 of trying to suppress the black vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=January 10, 2017 |title=Read the letter Coretta Scott King wrote opposing Sessions’s 1986 federal nomination |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/01/10/read-the-letter-coretta-scott-king-wrote-opposing-sessionss-1986-federal-nomination/}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar ID law in North Dakota, which would have disenfranchised large numbers of Native Americans, was also overturned.&lt;ref name="nprvote"&gt;{{cite web |website=NPR |date=August 2, 2016 |title=As November Approaches, Courts Deal Series Of Blows To Voter ID Laws |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/08/02/488392765/as-november-approaches-courts-deal-series-of-blows-to-voter-id-laws}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Wisconsin, a federal judge found that the state's restrictive voter ID law led to "real incidents of disenfranchisement, which undermine rather than enhance confidence in elections, particularly in minority communities"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hyp.is/Mrc_rAC9EeiVTFMDt_YwQA/elections.wi.gov/sites/default/files/news/petersonruling_pdf_14890.pdf|title=Case: 3:15-cv-00324-jdp Document #: 234 In the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=January 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and, given that there was no evidence of widespread voter impersonation in Wisconsin, found that the law was "a cure worse than the disease." In addition to imposing strict voter ID requirements, the law cut back on early voting, required people to live in a ward for at least 28 days before voting, and prohibited emailing absentee ballots to voters.&lt;ref name="nprvote" /&gt;

Other controversial measures include shutting down [[Department of Motor Vehicles]] (DMV) offices in minority neighborhoods, making it more difficult for residents to obtain voter IDs;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=CNN |title=DOT launches investigation in Alabama over DMV closures |date=December 9, 2015 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/09/politics/alabama-dmv-closures-voting-rights/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Esquire |title=The State of Alabama Has Fully Lost Its Mind |date=April 12, 2017 |url=http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/news/a54465/alabama-bentley-resign-church-police/}}&lt;/ref&gt; shutting down polling places in minority neighborhoods;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=The Nation |title=There Are 868 Fewer Places to Vote in 2016 Because the Supreme Court Gutted the Voting Rights Act |date=November 4, 2016 |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/there-are-868-fewer-places-to-vote-in-2016-because-the-supreme-court-gutted-the-voting-rights-act/}}&lt;/ref&gt; systematically depriving precincts in minority neighborhoods of the resources they need to operate efficiently, such as poll workers and voting machines;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times |title=Long Lines at Minority Polling Places |date=September 24, 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/opinion/long-lines-at-minority-polling-places.html?_r=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and purging voters from the rolls shortly before an election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times |title=Ruling Preserves Voting Rights for Thousands in North Carolina |date=November 4, 2016 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/05/us/north-carolina-voting-rights.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, voter fraud is cited as a justification for such laws even when the incidence of voter fraud is low. In Iowa, lawmakers passed a strict voter ID law with the potential to disenfranchise 260,000 voters. Out of 1.6 million votes cast in Iowa in 2016, there were only 10 allegations of voter fraud; none were cases of impersonation that a voter ID law could have prevented.  Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate, the architect of the bill, admitted, "We've not experienced widespread voter fraud in Iowa."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=The Nation |title=Iowa’s New Voter-ID Law Would Have Disenfranchised My Grandmother |date=April 13, 2017 |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/iowas-new-voter-id-law-would-have-disenfranchised-my-grandmother/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, President Donald Trump established the [[Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity]], purportedly for the purpose of preventing voter fraud. Critics have suggested its true purpose is voter suppression. The commission is led by Kansas attorney general [[Kris Kobach]], a staunch advocate of strict voter ID laws and a proponent of the Crosscheck system. Crosscheck is a national database designed to check for voters who are registered in more than one state by comparing names and dates of birth. Researchers at Stanford University, the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard University, and Microsoft found that for every legitimate instance of double registration it finds, Crosscheck's algorithm returns approximately 200 false positives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=June 30, 2017 |title=How Trump’s nationwide voter data request could lead to voter suppression |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/06/30/how-trumps-nationwide-voter-data-request-could-lead-to-voter-suppression/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kobach has been repeatedly sued by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) for trying to restrict voting rights in Kansas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 13, 2017 |title=The Man Behind Trump’s Voter-Fraud Obsession |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/13/magazine/the-man-behind-trumps-voter-fraud-obsession.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news| url= https://theintercept.com/2016/10/27/voter-suppression-is-the-real-election-scandal/ |title=Voter Suppression is the Real Election Scandal| work=[[The Intercept]]|date= October 27, 2016| author=Speri, Alice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1072">A '''voting bloc''' is a group of [[voting|voters]] that are strongly motivated by a specific common concern or group of concerns to the point that such specific concerns tend to dominate their voting patterns, causing them to vote together in [[election]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bloc&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Beliefnet]] identifies 12 main religious blocs in [[American politics]], including e.g. the "Religious Right", whose concerns are dominated by [[Religion and politics in the United States |religious]] and sociocultural issues and "White Bread Protestants", who, while also conservative, tend to care more about economic issues.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.beliefnet.com/News/Politics/2004/10/The-Twelve-Tribes-Of-American-Politics.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  The result is that each of these groups votes [[wikt:en bloc|en bloc]] in elections.
