'''17th century philosophy''' is generally regarded as seeing the start of [[modern philosophy]], and the shaking off of the medieval approach, especially [[scholasticism]]. It succeeded the [[Renaissance]] and preceded the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. It is often considered to be part of [[early modern philosophy]].

==History==
The period is usually taken to start in the seventeenth century with the work of [[René Descartes]], who set much of the agenda as well as much of the methodology for those who came after him.  The period is typified in Europe by the great system-builders &amp;mdash;  philosophers who present unified systems of [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], [[logic]], and [[ethics]], and often [[politics]] and the physical sciences too. [[Immanuel Kant]] classified his predecessors into two schools: the [[Rationalism|rationalists]] and the [[Empiricism|empiricists]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/k/kantmeta.htm#H1 "Immanuel Kant: Metaphysics"] ([[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]])&lt;/ref&gt; and [[early modern philosophy]] is often characterised in terms of a conflict between these schools.

The three main rationalists are normally taken to have been [[Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], and [[Gottfried Leibniz]]. Building upon their English predecessors [[Francis Bacon]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]], the three main empiricists were [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]], and [[David Hume]].  The former were distinguished by the belief that, in principle (though not in practice), all knowledge can be gained by the power of our reason alone; the latter rejected this, believing that all knowledge has to come through the senses, from experience.  Thus the rationalists took [[mathematics]] as their model for knowledge, and the empiricists took the [[physical sciences]]. 

This period also saw the birth of some of the classics of [[political philosophy]], especially [[Thomas Hobbes]]' ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes)|Leviathan]]'', and [[John Locke]]'s ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''.

The seventeenth century in Europe saw the culmination of the slow process of detachment of philosophy from [[theology]].  Thus, while philosophers still talked about &amp;ndash; and even offered arguments for the existence of &amp;ndash; a [[deity]], this was done in the service of philosophical argument and thought.  (In the [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the "Age of Reason", [[18th-century philosophy]] was to go still further, leaving theology and [[religion]] behind altogether.)

'''Abstract object theory''' is a branch of [[metaphysics]] regarding [[Abstract and concrete|abstract objects]]. Originally devised by metaphysicist [[Edward Zalta]] in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mally.stanford.edu/theory.html|title= The Theory of Abstract Objects|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= February 10, 1999|work= |publisher= |accessdate=March 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the theory was an expansion of [[mathematical Platonism]].

''Abstract Objects: An Introduction to Axiomatic Metaphysics'' (1983) is the title of a publication by Edward Zalta that outlines abstract object theory.&lt;ref&gt;Zalta, Edward N. [https://books.google.com/books?id=voCSP6k3FCcC ''Abstract Objects: An Introduction to Axiomatic Metaphysics'']. D. Reidel Publishing Company. 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

On Zalta's account, there are two modes of [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predication]]: some objects (the ordinary concrete ones around us, like tables and chairs) "exemplify" properties, while others ([[abstract object]]s like numbers, and what others would call "non-existent objects", like the round square, and the mountain made entirely of gold) merely "encode" them.&lt;ref&gt;Edward N. Zalta, ''Abstract Objects,'' 33.&lt;/ref&gt;  While the objects that exemplify properties are discovered through traditional empirical means, a simple set of axioms allows us to know about objects that encode properties.&lt;ref&gt;Edward N. Zalta, ''Abstract Objects,'' 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  For every set of properties, there is exactly one object that encodes exactly that set of properties and no others.&lt;ref&gt;Edward N. Zalta, ''Abstract Objects'', 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  This allows for a formalized [[ontology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="649">In [[philosophy]] and [[logic]], '''accidental necessity''', often stated in its [[Latin]] form, ''necessitas per accidens'', refers to the necessity attributed to the past by certain views of time. It is a controversial concept: its supporters argue that it has intuitive validity while others contest it creates a contradiction in terms by positing such a thing as a "contingent necessity." It is especially important in contemporary discussions of logical and theological [[fatalism]].

An agathist accepts that [[evil]] and misfortune will ultimately happen, but that the eventual outcome leads towards the good.&lt;ref&gt;''There's A Word for It!

==In theology==
Agathism is offered as an [[apologetic]] in [[theodicy]] to address the problem of reconciling a benevolent [[God]] with the [[existence of evil]] in the world. A form of agathism is found in [[Muslim]] thought and in some [[Christian]] beliefs. The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] believes that even the punishment of a [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] in [[hell]] is not eternal, but that the wicked perish.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} In [[theology|theologies]] which hold human history to be a narrative authored by God, agathism forms the basis for the development of [[Messianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Tischner on Agathology&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Axiological Impressions in The Controversy Over the Existence of Man&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Tischner Institute Journal of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Armchair theorizing''', '''armchair philosophizing''', or '''armchair scholarship''' is an approach to providing new developments in a field that does not involve the collection of new information but, rather, a careful analysis or synthesis of existent scholarship, especially frivolously or superficially so.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{Harvcoltxt|Nadel|1956|p=173}}, who defines ''armchair anthropology''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Commentary and analysis ==
Different disciplines place different weight on purely theoretical research. Some [[anthropology|anthropologists]] argue that purely theoretical anthropological research is outdated and that [[ethnography|ethnographic fieldwork]] should be a necessary part of anthropological research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ingold|2007|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some commentators argue that [[economic theory|economic theories]] are designed to explain and predict economic phenomena, which requires analysis and synthesis, and not necessarily collection, of data.  [[Leland B. Yeager]] even argues that economists can legitimately extrapolate from their own personal observations to design new theories.  In this sense, Yeager sees armchair theorizing as something better than the "mere sterile juggling of arbitrary assumptions" saying that "it can have a sound empirical basis."&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0254/is_5_60/ai_82469376/pg_9 Henry George and Austrian economics - History of Thought], ''[[The American Journal of Economics and Sociology]]'', Dec, 2001  by [[Leland B. Yeager]]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
While armchair scholarship contrasts with the [[scientific method]], which inherently involves the active investigation of the nature through data collection, armchair philosophers and theorizers can assist in formulating theories that explain observations; these theories can then be tested with further scientific investigation. While the methods of the armchair philosopher are different from those of the scientist, they can complement each other to produce new insights and discover necessary truths, whether they are empirical or theoretical.

'''Associationism''' is the idea that mental processes operate by the [[Association (psychology)|association]] of one mental state with its successor states.

==History==

The idea is first recorded in [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], especially with regard to the succession of memories. Members of the principally British "''Associationist School''", including [[John Locke]], [[David Hume]], [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]], [[Joseph Priestley]], [[James Mill]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Alexander Bain]], and [[Ivan Pavlov]], asserted that the principle applied to all or most mental processes.&lt;ref name="Boring"&gt;Boring, E. G. (1950) "A History of Experimental Psychology" New York, Appleton-Century-Crofts&lt;/ref&gt; Later members of the school developed very specific principles elaborating how associations worked and even a physiological mechanism bearing no resemblance to modern [[neurophysiology]].&lt;ref&gt;Pavlov, I.P. (1927, 1960) "Conditioned Reflexes" New York, Oxford (1927) Dover (1960)&lt;/ref&gt;  For a fuller explanation of the intellectual history of associationism and the "Associationist School", see ''[[Association of Ideas]]''.

Some of the ideas of the Associationist School anticipated the principles of [[Classical conditioning|conditioning]] and its use in [[behaviourism|behavioral psychology]].&lt;ref name="Boring"/&gt;

[[File:Mesa Redonda en Frankfurt.jpg|thumb|Carlos Pérez Soto in a seminar in Germany, which was organized by [[medico international]]]]
'''Carlos Pérez Soto''' (born October 6, 1954 in [[Santiago de Chile]]) is a Chilean teacher of [[physics]], lecturer at various universities and a social sciences researcher, author of works of a broad thematic spectrum: [[philosophy of science]] and [[epistemology]], [[political philosophy]] and [[Marxism]], [[history of dance]], [[anti-psychiatry]].

== Biography ==

In 1972 he joined the Faculty of Education at the [[University of Chile]] for the career of Pedagogy in Physics. In 1979, he obtained the state degree of a (qualified) Teacher of Physics, which is his only formal academic degree. Although he began his studies in the heyday of the student movement's political participation during the government of [[Salvador Allende]], he spent most of his life as a student during the years of the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|Chilean military dictatorship]].

Between 1975 and 1999 he worked as a secondary school teacher of physics in schools and colleges of Santiago.

[[File:Fenomenologia 1.jpg|thumb|left|Carlos Pérez Soto teaches a class on [[Hegel]]'s ''Phenomenology of Spirit'']]

In 1984, he began teaching in higher education at the Institute of Arts and Social Sciences, which gathered intellectuals who opposed Pinochet's dictatorship and which in 1991 became the University known until today as [[University of Art and Social Sciences|ARCIS]]. He continued as a university professor, teaching epistemology and philosophy of science in psychology departments, first at the [[Diego Portales University]] and later at the [[University of Chile]]. In the late 80's he was already well known among students and scholars for his critical approach, his Marxist analysis and concrete policy proposals. In this context, he received invitations to give lectures and conferences at numerous Chilean universities so that the following years were characterized by an intense teaching activity.

In the last decade he has taught regular courses and elective seminars at the [[University of Chile]] (Faculty of Law),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.derecho.uchile.cl/pregrado/secretaria-de-estudios/53916/ciencias-del-derecho-curriculum  Academic curriculum at the website of the University of Chile]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://web.derecho.uchile.cl/autoridades/curriculum/profesores/c_derecho/c_perez.htm# |title=On Carlos Pérez Soto at the web site of the Faculty of Law |access-date=2014-07-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323045122/http://web.derecho.uchile.cl/autoridades/curriculum/profesores/c_derecho/c_perez.htm# |archive-date=2014-03-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Catholic University of Valparaiso]] (School of Psychology), the [[Andrés Bello National University]] (School of Sociology), at [[University of Santiago, Chile|University of Santiago]] (Department of Philosophy), [[Academy of Christian Humanism University]] (Dance School) and at the [[Finis Terrae University]] (School of Theatre).

In the late 90's he also started giving some seminars and conferences outside Chile, at the [[Autonomous University of Barcelona]] on Hegel (1997) and Marxism (1999), as well as in Cali, at the [[University of Valle|Universidad del Valle]] on epistemology and dialectics (1998).&lt;ref&gt;[http://pioneros.puj.edu.co/lecturas/interesados/FILOSOFIA%20CIENCIA.pdf  Texto de seminario en Cali] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323033746/http://pioneros.puj.edu.co/lecturas/interesados/FILOSOFIA%20CIENCIA.pdf |date=March 23, 2014 }}, formato PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tumba de Hegel.jpg|thumb| Pérez Soto by Hegel's tomb in [[Berlin]]]]

At the ARCIS University, where he has focused his academic work, besides teaching in regular courses at the School of Psychology, (Psychological Theories and Systems) and the School of Sociology (Epistemology; Classics of social thought - Marx, Science, Technology and society), Philosophy (Philosophy of Science), Political Science (Theory of power and the state) and Pedagogy of Dance (Dance History), he served as senior researcher at the Center for Social Research as well as Coordinator of Academic Informatics.

As a Marxist intellectual he has been interviewed with some frequency by the leftist press,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.puntofinal.cl/676/cambio.php Entrevista en Revista Punto final] diciembre de 2008&lt;/ref&gt; mainly because he has made relevant theoretical contributions to the political discussion. In the context of the student movement of 2011 and 2012, he actively participated providing analysis and proposals for the transformation of the Chilean educational model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://humanidades.uach.cl/2012/11/14/carlos-perez-dictara-charla-magistral-sobre-educacion/ Clase magistral] en la [[Universidad Austral de Chile]] sobre la transformación del modelo educativo] 15 de noviembre de 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
His class analysis of the kind of society that is set under the neoliberal economic model has attracted the interest of international organizations for him to lecture on this subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://radio.uchile.cl/2013/10/07/40-anos-de-modelo-neoliberal-en-chile  Nota en el Diario Universidad de Chile]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticias.uarcis.cl/index.php/cs-sociales/academicas/3373-docente-carlos-perez-dicto-conferencias-en-alemania-sobre-40-anos-de-neoliberalismo-en-chile Carlos Pérez dictó charlas en Alemania sobre 40 años de neoliberalismo en Chile] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323051620/http://noticias.uarcis.cl/index.php/cs-sociales/academicas/3373-docente-carlos-perez-dicto-conferencias-en-alemania-sobre-40-anos-de-neoliberalismo-en-chile |date=March 23, 2014 }} Boletín de noticias de la Universidad Arcis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medico.de/themen/aktion/konferenzen/dokumente/chile-im-wandel/4478/ Seminario de [[medico international]]] 16 de septiembre de 2013 (en alemán)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://faitesvotrejeu.blogsport.de/2013/09/11/donnerstag-12-september-2013-19-uhr-von-chile-lernen-neoliberalismus-und-protest/ ''Aprender de Chile: Neoliberalismo y protesta''] Foro en Frankfurt,12 de septiembre de 2013 (en alemán)&lt;/ref&gt;

Even among scholars of [[Hegel]] and of the reception of Hegel and [[Marx]] at the [[Frankfurt School]], particularly by [[Herbert Marcuse]], Carlos Perez is a regular speaker at international meetings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emol.com/noticias/magazine/2003/10/03/125010/conferencia-internacional-adorno-100-anos-en-el-goethe-institut.html Conferencia internacional, "Adorno, 100 años", en el Goethe-Institut] El Mercurio, 3 de octubre de 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2008/02/04/index.php?section=opinion&amp;article=002a2cor Anuncio del curso “Hegel y las ciencias sociales” ] Universidad autónoma de México, febrero de 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the vast educational activity in regular and elective courses at the universities, there is a number of free biannual seminars, which he has been giving since 2009 about the ''Phenomenology of the Spirit'' of Hegel, on Marxism and [[Psychoanalysis]], Critical Theory of Law, History of Marxism, [[Carl Sagan]]: Introduction to the current natural philosophy.

Since 2009 he also teaches as a professor of epistemology in several graduate programs (masters and doctorate) at the university Andrés Bello&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postgradounab.cl/academico/carlos-perez/  Presentación de Pérez Soto] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323062217/http://www.postgradounab.cl/academico/carlos-perez/# |date=2014-03-23 }} en un programa de postgrado de la Universidad Andrés Bello&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Art and Social Sciences|ARCIS University]], addressing in his classes and seminars the critical reflection on methodological aspects of the social sciences.

Since 2013 he has decided to publish his books under a Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND (which allows you to copy and distribute the texts freely and at no costs, provided that the source is mentioned; the works can't be altered or used for commercial purposes).

== Theoretical contribution and main ideas ==

In epistemology, he has developed a historical and dialectical analysis of the concept of science, more precisely:

* The development of the idea that the scientific method should be considered as a logic for the legitimation of the scientific community; 
* the proposal for a rational reconstruction of the history of philosophy of science from which it is possible to criticize the claim to truth that follows the scientific method; 
* the development of a historical concept of science based on a Marxist critique of the epistemological anarchism of Paul Feyerabend; 
* the formulation of a critique of the prevailing public subjectivity of the middle classes starting from a historical and social concept of modern psychology.

From a political point of view, Carlos Pérez places his theoretical approach and proposals for the political practice in the "Hegelian Marxism", a stance which, as he points out, could be constituted within the philosophical foundations for the purpose of the emergence of a new type of Marxism. Here the following contributions stand out:
* The idea that the bureaucracy should be considered a social class in the Marxist sense of the term; 
* the formulation of a Marxist critique of the ruling regime in socialist countries, based on the concept of bureaucracy as a class; 
* conducting a review of the processes of objective bureaucratization occurred in advanced capitalism; 
* the proposal of the reconstruction of Marxist theory based on a materialist reading of Hegel's philosophy.

His proposals for a new anti-psychiatry are also a political program. They focus on a profound critique of the psychiatric practices, on the need for an unmedicalization and de-privatization of the symptoms, in order to return the problems to the scope of their actual causes, origins and perpetuation: the social sphere. Among other differences with the anti-psychiatry postulates of the twentieth century ( [[Ronald David Laing|Laing]], [[David Cooper (psychiatrist)|Cooper]] or [[Franco Basaglia|Basaglia]]), the "new" anti-psychiatry that Perez Soto promotes is one that also overcomes the paternalistic aspects of the psychiatric house as a "shelter", going beyond the logic of organizing a more humane or better quality psychiatric care, paving the way for an anti-psychiatry which arises from the persons themselves that are affected. Apart from a summary and historical connection of the different moments of critical psychiatry and anti-psychiatry, two specific contributions of Carlos Perez stand out:
* The development of a critique of the medicalization processes of behavioral disturbances; 
* the proposal of distinctions to criticize the medicalization and commodification of modern medicine.

The following contributions in the field of art and dance are important: 
* His proposal of a theoretically founded reconstruction of modern dance history in its European tradition and throughout the twentieth century; 
* his proposal of technical style distinctions in contemporary dance; 
* his proposals or theoretical distinctions regarding the political art, political use of art and particular politics of the art guild itself.

With his second book ''Comentar obras de danza'' (Discussing Works of Dance), he ended his excursion through the history of dance. As he explains, because he wants to return to the core of his developments. 
{{cita|I usually write about Marxism, that's the center of all my thoughts. From there I ventured into epistemology and philosophy of science, critical psychology and anti-psychiatry. From now on I will probably write more about the Hegelian philosophy, to which I have devoted many years of study. Except in the most general subjects of aesthetics and art history, this book marks for me the end of a period, and a farewell.

'''Chee Soo''' (born '''Clifford Soo''', also known as '''Clifford Gibbs''', 4 June 1919 – 29 August 1994) was an author of books about the philosophy of [[Taoism]] and in particular [[Lee-style t'ai chi ch'uan]], [[Qigong]], [[Ch'ang Ming]], [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] and [[Feng Shou]] 'Hand of the Wind' [[Kung Fu]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born on 4 June 1919 in All Souls, [[Marylebone]], London, Chee Soo was the son of Ah Chee Soo, a Chinese seaman and a pastry chef at the Westminster restaurant. His English mother was Beatrice Annie Alice Gibbs. They lived in Westminster. Although he enlisted in the [[British Army]] under the name Clifford Gibbs, his mother's maiden name, in later life he took his father's name and was known as Chee Soo. In a 1977 [[LBC]] radio interview Chee Soo described meeting a Chinese Martial Arts teacher from [[Shandong]] called [[Chan Kam Lee]] in Hyde Park when he was fourteen years old. Chee Soo said he was invited to Chan Lee's class in the summer of 1934, and this was the beginning of his martial arts training. Chee Soo said that Chan Kam Lee adopted him as a nephew, and taught him the arts whenever his work and time permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bufvc.ac.uk/tvandradio/lbc/index.php/segment/0010200177004 |title=Clifford Chee talks to Brian Hayes · British Universities Film &amp; Video Council |website=Bufvc.ac.uk |accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military career===
In 1937 Chee Soo joined the 2nd Battalion of the [[2nd Royal Tank Regiment|Royal Tank Regiment]] part of the 7th Armoured division known as the [[British 7th Armoured Division|Desert rats]]. During the Second World War, he was promoted to Lance-Corporal and Corporal in 1941, then to "Acting Serjeant" in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forces-war-records.co.uk/namesearch/?FirstName=Clifford&amp;Surname=Gibbs&amp;RecordType=Ww2&amp;RecordDateStartYear=1939&amp;RecordDateEndYear=1945 |accessdate=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Military Medal]] after the [[Battle of Beda Fomm]] in Libya in February 1941, part of [[Operation Compass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seahorsearts.co.uk/images/history/chee_soo_military_medal.png |format=PNG |title=4 Armd Bds, 7 Arm Div., Gibbs, Clifford |publisher=Seahorses.co.uk |accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his regiment were transferred to Burma he was captured by the Japanese on 19 April 1942 during the [[Battle of Yenangyaung]] and forced to work on the [[Burma Railway|Death Railway]] as a [[Prisoner of war|POW]] where he contracted Malaria, he was later classified as a war crimes witness:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In 1939 the Second World War broke out, and Chee Soo did his share of fighting as a Tank Commander in the Second Battalion of the Royal Tank Corps, in France, in North Africa — where he won the Military Medal, and in Burma where, after a hectic battle, he was finally taken prisoner by the Japanese. He went through many periods of beatings, torture, starvation and very hard work as a member of a working party in the mountains between India and Burma. Finally, three years later, as the Japanese started to retreat from the advancing Allies, he managed to escape into the Shan Mountains of West Burma and made his way over very rugged terrain and through many jungles, till finally one month afterwards he was able to make contact with the Allies again. Three months after recuperation and treatment (for he then weighed only 84 lbs), he was flown back to England, where he was able to enjoy a long leave with his wife. After that, he was discharged from the forces and took a course in book-keeping, stock control, commercial history and sales promotion.
Chee Soo claimed that he managed to make contact with Chan Lee again after the war was finished, and the class in Holborn was restarted. In 1950, Chee Soo formed his own class in Manor Road School, West Ham, East London.&lt;ref&gt;Taoist Ways of Healing by Chee Soo page 139 (published by HarperCollins 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The author [[Rupert Croft-Cooke]] who was Chee's friend from 1938 provides us with some biographical details of this period in Chee Soo's life in his book 'The Dogs of Peace'.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Clifford Gibbs had got his rather grand name from Dr Barnardo's Homes, for he had been reared in one of these, the son of a Chinese father and English mother, neither of whom he had ever seen. I had known him before the war and was as proud as he was of the Military Medal he had earned as a Corporal in the Royal Armoured Corps in North Africa. He had been sent to Burma and taken prisoner by the Japanese, and suffered unspeakable tortures and humiliations because of his race, separated as he was from his fellow British. He had survived and, inwardly as inscrutable as a Conrad character, a little like Wang in Victory, he had married a blonde English girl and had an exquisite baby daughter whose godfather I became at a Sunday afternoon service in an East End Anglican church.
Clifford, who went about life methodically, was severely industrious and found the means of saving for his family even in those days of grudging wages. But he had a humorous cheerful side to his character and enlivened my flat during his weekly visits between office hours and his return to Durban Street, E.15. He was an expert wrestler and had earned the Judo black belt. Only from the depths of his character emerged sometimes the exotic or oriental; in speech and manner he was very much an Englishman, and it was strange to hear from his curved lips words that might have been used by any London ex-soldier. I am glad to have had his friendship throughout those years.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rupert Croft-Cooke]] – ''The Dogs of Peace'', W.H.Allen and Co 1973 {{ISBN|0-491-00864-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Teaching the Taoist Arts===
Chee Soo said that after the death of his teacher Chan Kam Lee, he went on to become the President of the International Taoist Society {{Citation needed|reason=This claim is sourced only from Chee Soo himself, and needs backing up with independent sources that don't originate from Chee Soo, his writings, or coverage based on them. Assuming that such a prominent International society existed, there would be records that could be cited, so it's not unreasonable to ask for them.|date=March 2017}} and taught a variety of martial arts ranging from self-defence techniques to healing and spiritual disciplines based on Chinese Medicine, ch'i kung and meditation.

Chee Soo's daughter Lavinia Soo-Warr adds that Chee Soo began learning [[Judo]] and [[Kendo]] in London after World War 2, and followed this up with training in [[Aikido]] with [[Kenshiro Abbe]] after his arrival in London in 1955. This history states that Chee Soo "switched back to the Chinese arts", possibly influenced by his negative experiences as a Japanese prisoner-of-war during WW2. Lavinia states that Chee Soo began teaching a small group in Dunstable in "Ch'i Shu". This is probably the Aikido-influenced system which Chee Soo demonstrates and is called "Qi Shu" or "Chinese Aikido" in contemporary Movietone footage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vintage footage of Chee Soo Doing Qi Shu (Chinese Aikido)| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glhigfam4X4 | access-date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history says that later "as the Chi'Shu and Kung Fu systems became more popular, he introduced Taijiquan and the Chang Ming Diet", which suggests that Chee Soo was not teaching Tai Chi up to this point. Lavinia's history says that Chee Soo changed his teachings fundamentally "at least three times" during his teaching career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Factual History of Chee Soo (English name, Clifford Gibbs) and Li Style Taijiquan| first=Lavinia | last=Soo-Warr | url=http://www.peterwarr.co.uk/wu-kung/articles-lavinia.asp | access-date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Chee Soo, Chan Lee died in the winter of 1953–4 off the coast of China, near Canton, when the ship he was travelling in sank in a severe storm, and he was asked to take over the leadership of the association.&lt;ref&gt;Taoist Ways of Healing by Chee Soo pages 139–140 (published by HarperCollins 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the association has grown in The British Isles, Australia, South Africa, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Mauritius and New Zealand.

Chee Soo taught 'The Eight Strands of the Brocade', comprising :
*Ch'ang Ming 	—	Taoist long life health diet therapy
*Ts'ao Yao 	—    	Taoist herbal therapy
*Anmo          	—    	Taoist massage
*Tao Yin         –    	Taoist respiration therapy
*Tien Chen	—    	Taoist Acupressure (Spot Pressing)
*Chen Tuan	—    	Taoist diagnosis techniques
*Chili Nung	—    	(The way of occlusion)

There are two associations which are affiliated to the Chinese Cultural Arts Association and the International Wu Shu Association.&lt;ref&gt;Taoist Ways of Healing by Chee Soo pages 139–140 (published by HarperCollins 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese Cultural Arts Association teach :
*T'ai chi ch'uan	—	The Supreme Ultimate
*K'ai Men	—	(Taoist Yoga or the Taoist form of Ch'i Kung)
*I Fu Shou	—	(Sticky Hands)
*Li Kung	        —	(Taoist development of Li energy)
*Mo Kun	        —	(Taoist Wand for Li energy control)
*Mo Hsiang 	—	(Taoist Meditation)
*T'ai Chi Dance 
*T'ai Chi Stick
*T'ai Chi Sword

The International Wu Shu Association teach:
*Feng Shou 	—	(‘Hand of the Wind' Kung fu, very soft, very gentle, and very fast, and suitable for women and men of all ages &lt;ref&gt;Taoist Ways of Healing by Chee Soo pages 139–140 (published by HarperCollins 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;).
*Chi Shu		—	(A form of self defence with throws &amp; breakfalls similar to [[Aikido]], which Chee Soo studied after World War 2 )
*Tao Shu (Sword)
*Kan Shu (Stick/Spear)&lt;ref&gt;Taoist Ways of Healing by Chee Soo pages 139–140 (published by HarperCollins 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chee avengers.jpg|thumb|Chee Soo, Diana Rigg and Film Stunt arranger Ray Austin worked together on "The Avengers" cult TV series]]
Chee Soo was also involved as a fight choreographer with the cult TV series [[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]] during the 1960s as is evidenced by publicity photographs of him with [[Ray Austin (director)|Ray Austin]] (himself a Black Belt third dan Kung Fu Master and pupil of Soo's) and [[Diana Rigg]] probably taken around 1967. He brought Kung Fu before a western audience years before Bruce Lee had even been heard of.&lt;br /&gt;
The [[Guinness world record]] site states that "In 1965, Dame Diana Rigg (UK) became the first western actress to perform kung fu on Television when the combat choreographers Ray Austin (UK) and Chee Soo (UK/China) worked elements of the martial art into her fight scenes on The Avengers. Certificate presentation was done on [[The New Paul O'Grady Show]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-6000/first-western-actress-to-perform-kung-fu-on-television/ |title=First western actress to perform kung fu on television |publisher=Guinness World Records |date=1 May 2008 |accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s he ran a Chinese Health and Herbal clinic in London.&lt;ref&gt;Chinese Art of T'ai Chi Ch'uan – Gordon and Cremonesi 1976 page 1&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a British [[Movietone News]] documentary filmed on 21 May 1970 at Guildford in Surrey – UK, Chee Soo had over 2000 students studying [[Wushu (term)|Wu Shu]] in Britain as part of the British Wu Shu Association, and was one of only three men outside of Beijing qualified to teach Wu Shu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.movietone.com/N_search.cfm?ActionFlag=back2ResultsView&amp;start=1&amp;pageStart=1&amp;totalRecords=1&amp;V_DateType=1&amp;V_DECADE=1929&amp;V_FromYear=1928&amp;V_QualifySubject=&amp;V_storyNumber=95962&amp;V_TermsToOmit=&amp;V_ToYear=1980&amp;V_searchType=1&amp;V_MainSubject=&amp;V_Year=1928&amp;V_resultsPerPage=10 | title=Chinese Martial Arts | publisher=movietone.com | id=Story number: 95962 | date=21 May 1970 | accessdate=23 March 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928101121/http://www.movietone.com/N_search.cfm?ActionFlag=back2ResultsView&amp;start=1&amp;pageStart=1&amp;totalRecords=1&amp;V_DateType=1&amp;V_DECADE=1929&amp;V_FromYear=1928&amp;V_QualifySubject=&amp;V_storyNumber=95962&amp;V_TermsToOmit=&amp;V_ToYear=1980&amp;V_searchType=1&amp;V_MainSubject=&amp;V_Year=1928&amp;V_resultsPerPage=10 | archivedate=28 September 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chee Soo appeared in a [[BBC]] [[Nationwide (TV programme)|Nationwide]] TV interview on 21 September 1973 where he demonstrated Kung fu self-defence techniques and inner power live in the studio with presenter [[Bob Wellings]]. Chee Soo talked about the history of Kung Fu and the difference between Northern and Southern kung fu styles in China and how it differs from Karate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seahorsearts.co.uk/images/history/BBC%20TV%20interview%20Nationwide%201973.PNG |format=PNG |title=Nationwide |publisher=Seahorses.co.uk |accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 Chee Soo was filmed by the BBC at his Feng shou kung fu class in Seymour Hall in London and subsequently appeared in a documentary broadcast for schools entitled '''Scene:Looking for a fight'''. His soft style kung fu self-defence class was contrasted with boxing and hard style kung fu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seahorsearts.co.uk/images/history/BBC%20TV%20Looking%20for%20a%20fight%201975.PNG |format=PNG |title=Scene Looking for a Fight |publisher=Seahorses.co.uk |accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 he was interviewed by [[Brian Hayes (broadcaster)|Brian Hayes]] on [[LBC]] radio and talked about Lee style T'ai Chi Ch'uan, meeting his teacher Chan Kam Lee and [[Reincarnation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bufvc.ac.uk/tvandradio/lbc/index.php/segment/0010200177004 |title=Clifford Chee talks to Brian Hayes · British Universities Film &amp; Video Council |website=Bufvc.ac.uk |accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writings===
According to an interview with Marilyn Soo who is Chee Soo's widow, during the 1980s he moved to Coventry and spent his time writing and teaching courses in Lee-style t'ai chi ch'uan and Feng Shou Kung Fu at the Alderman Callow School in Coventry (now called [[The Westwood Academy]]) and other locations around Britain, as well as visiting some of his students overseas in places like Australia and around Europe. Chee Soo was the author of five books published during his lifetime and one book published posthumously about Taoist philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Tao of My Thoughts pages 127–150&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in Ebbw Vale on 29 August 1994 as a result of an [[Abdominal aortic aneurysm|abdominal aneurism]] caused by [[Deep vein thrombosis]] probably aggravated by several [[Deep vein thrombosis#Travelers|long haul plane flights]] during the previous two years.&lt;ref&gt;Tao of My Thoughts page 147&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3641">'''Chemism''' refers to forces of attraction or adhesion between entities.  It has uses in chemistry and philosophy.

==Chemistry==
In the past, chemism referred to intramolecular forces between atoms, or more generally, any forces acting on atoms and molecules.&lt;ref&gt;''The principles of theoretical chemistry, with special reference to the constitution of chemical compounds'' (1887).  Remsen, Ira,, Philadelphia, Lea Brothers &amp; Co. pg, 83 (archived version [https://archive.org/details/cu31924002984676 here])&lt;/ref&gt;  It is now typically superseded by more precise terms such as [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen interaction]].

==Philosophy==
The concept of chemism has been referred to in many of the various disciplines that constitute philosophical practice. Some of the include:

*The use of the term in philosophy references the activities of chemism in chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Clark.  ''Hegel's logic: between dialectic and history'', Northwestern University Press, Chicago. 1996. (p. 260)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Chemism is a term in [[Hegelianism|Hegelian philosophy]] that stands for the ''"mutual attraction, interpenetration, and neutralisation of independent individuals which unite to form a whole."'' Hegel posits that the concept of "Objectivity" contains the "three forms of Mechanism, Chemism , and Teleology":

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"The object of mechanical type is the immediate and undifferentiated object. No doubt it contains difference, but the different pieces stand, as it were, without affinity to each other, and their connection is only extraneous. In chemism, on the contrary, the object exhibits an essential tendency to differentiation, in such a way that the objects are what they are only by their relation to each other: this tendency to difference constitutes their quality. The third type of objectivity, the teleological relation, is the unity of mechanism and chemism. Design, like the mechanical object, is a self-contained totality, enriched however by the principle of differentiation which came to the fore in chemism, and thus referring itself to the object that stands over against it. Finally, it is the realisation of design which forms the transition to the Idea."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kern-ep.de/Internet/Hegels_Logik/object.htm|title=Hegel, The Notion, Part B. The Object|first=|last=Hegel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*In his ''Science of Logic'', [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]  develops a succession of different forms of mechanism, which end up engendering a process called "chemism". Chemism is obviously a term that lends itself to chemical relationships in physical reality. Hegel, however, is using the term "chemism" logically, and therefore it can be applied to things that you do not study in chemistry class but you might study in German literature, reading Goethe's ''Elective Affinities,'' or in psychological studies dealing with a chemistry between individuals:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Chemism constitutes in objectivity as a whole, the moment of judgment, of the difference that has become objective, and of the process. Since it already begins with determinateness and positedness and the chemical object is at the same time an objective totality, its immediate course is simple and is completely determined by its presupposition."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Condition of possibility''' (''Bedingungen der Möglichkeit'') is a [[philosophic]]al [[concept]] made popular by [[Immanuel Kant]].

A condition of possibility is a necessary framework for the possible appearance of a given list of entities. It is often used in contrast to the unilateral [[causality]] concept, or even to the notion of [[interaction]]. For example, consider a cube made by an artisan. All cubes are three-dimensional. If an object is three-dimensional, then it is an extended object. But extension is an impossibility without space. Therefore, space is a condition of possibility because it is a necessary condition for the existence of cubes to be possible. Note, however, that [[space]] did not cause the cube, but that the artisan did, and that the cube and space are distinct entities, so space isn’t part of the definition of cube.

{{cns|text=[[Gilles Deleuze]] presented it as a dichotomy in contradistinction to the classical [[phenomenon]]/[[noumenon]] dichotomy.|date=March 2016}} From [[Plato]] to [[Descartes]], what was presented by the senses was deemed illusory and {{clarify|text=denigrated|date=March 2016}}. It was believed that the perceptions ought to be overcome to grasp the [[thing-in-itself]], the essential essence, also known as Plato’s [[allegory of the cave]]. With Kant comes a transition in philosophy from this dichotomy to the dichotomy of the {{cfy|reason=technical term?|text=apparition|date=March 2016}}/{{cfy|reason=technical term?|text=conditions-of-appearance|date=March 2016}}. There is no longer any higher essence behind the {{cfy|reason=technical term?|text=apparition|date=March 2016}}. It is what it is, a brute fact, and what one must now examine is the conditions that are necessary for its appearance. Immanuel Kant does just this in the [[The Critique of Pure Reason#Transcendental Aesthetic|Transcendental Aesthetic]], when he examines the necessary conditions for the [[analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic]] ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' cognition of [[mathematics]]. But Kant ''was'' {{clarify|text=a transition|reason=unclear; technical term?|date=March 2016}}, so he still maintains the phenomenon/noumenon dichotomy, but the noumenon has already been relegated unknowable and to be ignored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webdeleuze.com/php/texte.php?cle=58&amp;groupe=Kant&amp;langue=1 Deleuze: Kant: 14 March 1978.] (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] would come to adapt it in a [[historical]] sense through the concept of "[[episteme]]":

&lt;blockquote&gt; what I am attempting to bring to light is the epistemological field, the ''épistémè'' in which knowledge, envisaged apart from all criteria having reference to its rational value or to its objective forms, grounds its positivity and thereby manifests a history which is not that of its growing perfection, but rather that of its conditions of possibility; in this account, what should appear are those configurations within the space of knowledge which have given rise to the diverse forms of empirical science. Such an enterprise is not so much a history, in the traditional meaning of that word, as an ‘archaeology’.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Michel | last = Foucault | title = The Order of Things | year = 2002 | page = xxiii-xxiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1920">The term '''cosmotheology''', along with the term "[[ontotheology]]", was invented by [[Immanuel Kant]] "in order to distinguish between two competing types of "[[transcendental theology]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomson |first=Iain Donald |authorlink=Iain Thomson |title=Heidegger on Ontotheology.

Kant defined the relationship between ontotheology and cosmostheology as follows: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Transcendental theology aims either at inferring the existence of a Supreme Being from a general experience, without any closer reference to the world to which this experience belongs, and in this case it is called cosmotheology; or it endeavours to cognize the existence of such a being, through mere conceptions, without the aid of experience, and is then termed ontotheology."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', [https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;q=%22Transcendental+theology+aims+either+at+inferring+the+existence+of+a+Supreme+Being+from+a+general+experience,+without+any+closer+reference+to+the+world+to+which+this+experience+belongs,+and+in+this+case%22%22it+is+called+cosmotheology;+or+it+endeavours+to+cognize+the+existence+of+such+a+being,+through+mere+conceptions,+without+the+aid+of+experience,+and+is+then+termed+Ontotheology%22 Section VII: Critique of all Theology based upon Speculative Principles of Reason].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Defensivism''' is a philosophical standpoint related in spirit to the [[Non-aggression principle]]. It is also a midway point between other combat-based philosophies, that of [[Just War]] and [[Pacifism]]. 

The standpoint of Defensivism is that only Defensive actions are moral. You may move to someone's aid as long as they are in immediate danger, or protect yourself from immediate harm. 

To a country, it holds that a military force may never leave its home country's own borders except to move to the aid of someone else (and in such a situation, that they may only protect sites from harm that they are specifically invited to, with no aggressive action taken whatsoever). 

Any form of preemptive strike, any type of capture, revenge, or any situation where one would fire the first actual shot or throw the first actual blow is against the Defensivist standpoint. Also, any form of combative action must cease the moment the opposition stops fighting, withdraws, gives up, or ceases aggressive action. 

Generally, Defensivism only allows the taking of life when the life that would be taken is actively threatening another life.

'''Early modern philosophy''' (also '''classical modern philosophy''')&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Tlumak, ''Classical Modern Philosophy: A Contemporary Introduction'', Routledge, 2006, p. xi: "[''Classical Modern Philosophy''] is a guide through the systems of the seven brilliant seventeenth- and eighteenth-century European philosophers most regularly taught in college Modern Philosophy courses".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schacht"&gt;[[Richard Schacht]], ''Classical Modern Philosophers: Descartes to Kant'', Routledge, 2013, p. 1: "Seven men have come to stand out from all of their counterparts in what has come to be known as the 'modern' period in the history of philosophy (i.e., the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries): Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume and Kant".&lt;/ref&gt; is a period in the [[history of philosophy]] at the beginning or overlapping with the period known as [[modern philosophy]].

==Overview==
The [[early modern period]] in history is roughly 1500–1789,&lt;ref&gt;[[Marshall Berman]]. 1982. ''[[All That Is Solid Melts into Air]]: The Experience of Modernity''. New York: Simon and Schuster. {{ISBN|0-671-24602-X}}. London: Verso. pp. 16–17. {{ISBN|0-86091-785-1}}. Paperback reprint New York: Viking Penguin, 1988. {{ISBN|0-14-010962-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but the label "early modern philosophy" is usually used to refer to a more specific period of time.

In the narrowest sense, the term is used to refer principally to the [[17th-century philosophy|philosophy of the 17th century]], posited to have begun with [[René Descartes]]; to have included [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Baruch Spinoza]]; and to have ended with [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] and [[Isaac Newton]]. Many stretch this period to [[18th-century philosophy]] (the [[Age of Enlightenment]]), thus including [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]], and [[David Hume]].&lt;ref name="Schacht"/&gt;

The term is sometimes used more broadly and early modern philosophy is considered to have begun in the 16th century&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Leiter]] (ed.), ''The Future for Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 44 n. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]]; to have also included [[Michel Eyquem de Montaigne]], [[Francis Bacon]], [[Giambattista Vico]], [[Voltaire]] and [[Thomas Paine]]; and to have ended at the latest in 1804 with the death of [[Immanuel Kant]].  Considered in this way, the period spans from [[Renaissance philosophy]] to the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

'''Ecotechnics''' is defined as the '[[techne]]' of bodies. Ecotechnics thinks of the body as a technology which makes possible the inclusion of a whole new range of bodies. This gives people more agency and [[biopower]] over their own use of their bodies. This makes it usable for [[queer theory]] and [[disability studies]]. The term is then also central in Sullivan's and Murray's collection of essays ''Queering the Technologisation of Bodies''. It is built on [[Bernard Stiegler]]'s work that sees the body and technology as a double process: the technology and the body are informed by each other. [[Derrida]] who extends on both Jean-Luc Nancy and Stiegler's ideas argues that the 'proper body' implicates interconnections of technical additions. Ecotechnics goes against the [[essentialist]] and binary notion of the body as a technological object which positions it within [[post-structuralism]]. The body can only be understood within its environment and this environment is a technical one.

The term '''eikasía''' ({{lang-grc|εἰκασία}}), meaning  imagination in Greek, was used by [[Plato]] to refer to a human way of dealing with appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swif.uniba.it/lei/foldop/foldoc.cgi?eikasia |title=eikasia |work=FOLDOC |accessdate=2006-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620035437/http://www.swif.uniba.it/lei/foldop/foldoc.cgi?eikasia |archivedate=2006-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the inability to perceive whether a [[perception]] is an [[image]] of something else. It therefore prevents us from perceiving that a [[dream]] or [[memory]] or a reflection in a [[mirror]] is not [[reality]] as such.

It is apart of [[Analogy of the divided line|Plato's Analogy of the Divided Line]].

'''''Fides quaerens intellectum''''' means "faith seeking understanding" or "faith seeking intelligence". It is the [[Theology|theological]] method stressed by [[Augustine]] (354–430) and [[Anselm of Canterbury]] ({{circa|1033}}&amp;nbsp;– 1109) in which one begins with belief in [[faith]] and on the basis of that faith moves on to further understanding of Christian truth.&lt;ref&gt; Donald K. McKim, Westminster Dictionary of Theological Terms (Louisville: Westminster John Knox Press, 1996), 104&lt;/ref&gt; 
Anselm uses this expression for the first time in his [[Proslogion]] (II–IV). It articulates the close relationship between faith and [[Reason|human reason]]. This is the key to Anselm's theological thought and [[Philosophy|philosophical]] thinking. He would understand all things in faith. It means to understand intellectually what we already believe. Chronologically, faith precedes understanding, like when small children first trust their parents and believe what they state, and just later on, when they grow up, they want to examine and understand the reality by themselves. But, logically, intellect precedes faith, because we trust other people, at least in principle, only provisionally, but our aim is a direct personal knowledge. In the words of Anselm of Canterbury : "Neque enim quaero intelligere ut credam, sed credo ut intelligam" ("I do not seek to understand in order that I may believe, but rather, I believe in order that I may understand").

[[File:Abm2.jpg|thumb|300px|A photo showing a boy jumping into a body of water. It is widely believed that humans make decisions (e.g. jumping in the water) based on free will.]]

'''Free will''' is the ability to [[Choice|choose]] between different possible courses of [[Action (philosophy)|action]] unimpeded.&lt;ref&gt;Omoregie, J. (2015).
 Freewill: The degree of freedom within. UK: Author House | {{ISBN|9781504987516}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hegeler, Edward C. (1910). ''The Monist'', Vol. 20. Open Court. p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

Free will is closely linked to the concepts of [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]], [[praise]], [[Culpability|guilt]], [[sin]], and other judgements which apply only to actions that are freely chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/area.12339|title = Demonic geographies| journal=Area| volume=49| issue=4| pages=503–509|year = 2017|last1 = Simandan|first1 = Dragos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumeister, R.F 2014. pp. 1-52"&gt;Baumeister, R.F. and Monroe, A.E., 2014.

Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also connected with the concepts of [[Advice (opinion)|advice]], [[persuasion]], [[deliberation]], and [[Prohibitionism|prohibition]]. Traditionally, only actions that are freely [[Will (philosophy)|will]]ed are seen as deserving credit or blame. There are numerous different concerns about threats to the possibility of free will, varying by how exactly it is conceived, which is a matter of some debate.

Some conceive free will to be the capacity to make choices in which the outcome has not been determined by past events. [[Determinism]] suggests that only one course of events is possible, which is inconsistent with the existence of free will thus conceived.&lt;ref name="Baumeister, R.F 2014. pp. 1-52"/&gt; This problem has been identified in [[ancient Greek philosophy]]&lt;ref name=bobzien1998determinism /&gt; and remains a major focus of philosophical debate. This view that conceives free will to be incompatible with determinism is called ''[[incompatibilism]]'' and encompasses both [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|metaphysical libertarianism]], the claim that determinism is false and thus free will is at least possible, and [[hard determinism]], the claim that determinism is true and thus free will is not possible. It also encompasses [[hard incompatibilism]], which holds not only determinism but also its negation to be incompatible with free will and thus free will to be impossible whatever the case may be regarding determinism.

In contrast, ''[[compatibilism|compatibilists]]'' hold that free will ''is'' compatible with determinism. Some compatibilists even hold that determinism is ''necessary'' for free will, arguing that choice involves preference for one course of action over another, requiring a sense of ''how'' choices will turn out.&lt;ref name=Carnap&gt;An argument by [[Rudolph Carnap]] described by: {{cite book |title=Research In Psychology: Methods and Design |author=C.

Classical compatibilists considered free will nothing more than freedom of action, considering one free of will simply if, ''had'' one counterfactually wanted to do otherwise, one ''could'' have done otherwise without physical impediment. Contemporary compatibilists instead identify free will as a psychological capacity, such as to direct one's behavior in a way responsive to reason, and there are still further different conceptions of free will, each with their own concerns, sharing only the common feature of not finding the possibility of determinism a threat to the possibility of free will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/compatibilism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first1=Michael|last1=McKenna|first2=D.

The underlying questions are whether we have control over our actions, and if so, what sort of control, and to what extent. These questions predate the early Greek [[Stoicism|stoics]] (for example, [[Chrysippus]]), and some modern philosophers lament the lack of progress over all these centuries.&lt;ref name=Nagel&gt;

It is difficult to reconcile the intuitive evidence that conscious decisions are causally effective with the view that the physical world can be explained to operate perfectly by [[physical law]].&lt;ref name="Velmans2002"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=9 |issue=11 |pages=2–29 |author=Max Velmans |title=How Could Conscious Experiences Affect Brains? |url=http://cogprints.org/2750/ |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict between intuitively felt freedom and natural law arises when either [[causal closure]] or [[physical determinism]] ([[nomological determinism]]) is asserted. With causal closure, no physical event has a cause outside the physical domain, and with physical determinism, the future is determined entirely by preceding events (cause and effect).

The puzzle of reconciling 'free will' with a deterministic universe is known as the ''problem of free will'' or sometimes referred to as the ''dilemma of determinism''.&lt;ref name=WJames&gt;{{cite book |title=The Will to believe, and other essays in popular philosophy |author=William James |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2Tw28d-85wC&amp;pg=PA145 |pages=145 ''ff'' |chapter=The dilemma of determinism |publisher=Longmans, Green |year=1896}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dilemma leads to a [[morality|moral]] dilemma as well: the question of how to assign [[moral responsibility|responsibility]] for actions if they are caused entirely by past events.&lt;ref name=Bargh&gt;

A different approach to the dilemma is that of [[incompatibilism|incompatibilists]], namely, that if the world is deterministic, then our feeling that we are free to choose an action is simply an [[hard determinism|illusion]]. [[Metaphysical libertarianism]] is the form of incompatibilism which posits that [[determinism]] is false and free will is possible (at least some people have free will).&lt;ref name="stanfordcompatibilism" /&gt; This view is associated with [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|non-materialist]] constructions,&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt; including both traditional [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Substance or Cartesian dualism|dualism]], as well as models supporting more minimal criteria; such as the ability to consciously veto an action or competing desire.&lt;ref name="Libet 2003"&gt;Libet, (2003). "Can Conscious Experience affect brain Activity?", ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 10, nr. 12, pp. 24–28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RKane1" /&gt; Yet even with [[indeterminism|physical indeterminism]], arguments have been made against libertarianism in that it is difficult to assign ''Origination'' (responsibility for "free" indeterministic choices).

Free will here is predominately treated with respect to [[physical determinism]] in the strict sense of [[nomological determinism]], although other forms of determinism are also relevant to free will.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismarguments /&gt; For example, logical and [[theological determinism|theological]] determinism challenge metaphysical libertarianism with ideas of [[destiny]] and [[fate]], and [[biological determinism|biological]], [[cultural determinism|cultural]] and [[psychological determinism|psychological]] determinism feed the development of compatibilist models. Separate classes of [[compatibilism]] and [[incompatibilism]] may even be formed to represent these.&lt;ref name="stanfordforeknowledge"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Zagzebski |first=Linda |editor=Edward N.

Below are the classic arguments bearing upon the dilemma and its underpinnings.

===Incompatibilism===
{{Main|Incompatibilism}}
Incompatibilism is the position that free will and determinism are logically incompatible, and that the major question regarding whether or not people have free will is thus whether or not their actions are determined. "Hard determinists", such as [[Baron d'Holbach|d'Holbach]], are those incompatibilists who accept determinism and reject free will. In contrast, "[[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|metaphysical libertarians]]", such as [[Thomas Reid]], [[Peter van Inwagen]], and [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]], are those incompatibilists who accept free will and deny determinism, holding the view that some form of indeterminism is true.&lt;ref name="Wagen"&gt;van Invagen, P. (1983) ''An Essay on Free Will''. Oxford: [[Clarendon Press]]. {{ISBN|0-19-824924-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another view is that of hard incompatibilists, which state that free will is incompatible with both [[determinism]] and [[indeterminism]].&lt;ref name="Derk1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pereboom, D. |year=2003 |title=Living without Free Will |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9sKZ1rAO2BwC&amp;printsec=frontcover |isbn=0521791987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional arguments for incompatibilism are based on an "[[intuition pump]]": if a person is like other mechanical things that are determined in their behavior such as a wind-up toy, a billiard ball, a puppet, or a robot, then people must not have free will.&lt;ref name="Wagen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fischer | first1 = J.M. | year = 1983 | title = Incompatibilism | url = | journal = Philosophical Studies | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 121–37 | doi = 10.1007/BF01112527 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has been rejected by compatibilists such as Daniel Dennett on the grounds that, even if humans have something in common with these things, it remains possible and plausible that we are different from such objects in important ways.&lt;ref name="DD1"/&gt;

Another argument for incompatibilism is that of the "causal chain". Incompatibilism is key to the idealist theory of free will. Most incompatibilists reject the idea that freedom of action consists simply in "voluntary" behavior. They insist, rather, that free will means that man must be the "ultimate" or "originating" cause of his actions. He must be ''[[causa sui]]'', in the traditional phrase. Being responsible for one's choices is the first cause of those choices, where first cause means that there is no antecedent cause of that cause. The argument, then, is that if man has free will, then man is the ultimate cause of his actions. If determinism is true, then all of man's choices are caused by events and facts outside his control. So, if everything man does is caused by events and facts outside his control, then he cannot be the ultimate cause of his actions. Therefore, he cannot have free will.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, R. (1996) ''The Significance of Free Will'', Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-512656-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, C. A. (1957) ''On Selfhood and Godhood'', London: George Allen and Unwin. {{ISBN|0-415-29624-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, J. P. (1943) ''Being and Nothingness'', reprint 1993. New York: Washington Square Press. Sartre also provides a psychological version of the argument by claiming that if man's actions are not his own, he would be in ''bad faith''.&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has also been challenged by various compatibilist philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, R.M. (1994) ''The Metaphysics of Free Will'', Oxford:Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bok, H. (1998) ''Freedom and Responsibility'', Princeton:Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-01566-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third argument for incompatibilism was formulated by [[Carl Ginet]] in the 1960s and has received much attention in the modern literature. The simplified argument runs along these lines: if determinism is true, then we have no control over the events of the past that determined our present state and no control over the laws of nature. Since we can have no control over these matters, we also can have no control over the ''consequences'' of them. Since our present choices and acts, under determinism, are the necessary consequences of the past and the laws of nature, then we have no control over them and, hence, no free will. This is called the ''consequence argument''.&lt;ref&gt;Ginet, C. (1966) "Might We Have No Choice?" In Lehrer, 1966: 87–104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ving"&gt;Van Inwagen, P. and Zimmerman, D. (1998) ''Metaphysics: The Big Questions''. Oxford: Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; Peter van Inwagen remarks that C.D. Broad had a version of the consequence argument as early as the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Inwagen, P. (n.d.) [http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/HowThinkFW.doc "How to think about free will"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911064556/http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/HowThinkFW.doc |date=2008-09-11 }}, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The difficulty of this argument for some compatibilists lies in the fact that it entails the impossibility that one could have chosen other than one has. For example, if Jane is a compatibilist and she has just sat down on the sofa, then she is committed to the claim that she could have remained standing, if she had so desired. But it [[Logical consequence|follows from]] the consequence argument that, if Jane had remained standing, she would have either generated a contradiction, violated the laws of nature or changed the past. Hence, compatibilists are committed to the existence of "incredible abilities", according to Ginet and van Inwagen. One response to this argument is that it equivocates on the notions of abilities and necessities, or that the free will evoked to make any given choice is really an illusion and the choice had been made all along, oblivious to its "decider".&lt;ref name="Ving"/&gt; [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] suggests that compatibilists are only committed to the ability to do something otherwise if ''different circumstances'' had actually obtained in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1755-2567.1981.tb00473.x | last1 = Lewis | first1 = D. | year = 2008| title = Are We Free to Break the Laws? | url = | journal = Theoria | volume = 47 | issue = 3| pages = 113–21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using ''T'', ''F'' for "true" and "false" and ''?'' for undecided, there are exactly nine positions regarding determinism/free will that consist of any two of these three possibilities:&lt;ref name=Strawson&gt;

''Incompatibilism'' may occupy any of the nine positions except (5), (8) or (3), which last corresponds to ''soft determinism''. Position (1) is ''hard determinism'', and position (2) is ''libertarianism''. The position (1) of hard determinism adds to the table the contention that ''D'' implies ''FW'' is untrue, and the position (2) of libertarianism adds the contention that ''FW'' implies ''D'' is untrue. Position (9) may be called ''hard incompatibilism'' if one interprets ''?'' as meaning both concepts are of dubious value. ''Compatibilism'' itself may occupy any of the nine positions, that is, there is no logical contradiction between determinism and free will, and either or both may be true or false in principle. However, the most common meaning attached to ''compatibilism'' is that some form of determinism is true and yet we have some form of free will, position (3).&lt;ref name=FischerFour2009&gt;{{cite book |pages=44 ''ff'' |author= Fischer, John Martin |title=Four Views on Free Will (Great Debates in Philosophy) |isbn=1405134860 |year=2009 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |chapter=Chapter 2: Compatibilism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Toppledominos.jpg|thumb|A [[domino effect|domino's movement]] is [[Determinism|determined]] completely by laws of physics.]]
[[Alexander Rosenberg|Alex Rosenberg]] makes an extrapolation of physical determinism as inferred on the macroscopic scale by the behaviour of a set of dominoes to neural activity in the brain where; "If the brain is nothing but a complex physical object whose states are as much governed by physical laws as any other physical object, then what goes on in our heads is as fixed and determined by prior events as what goes on when one domino topples another in a long row of them."&lt;ref name=Rosenberg&gt;

====Hard determinism====
{{main|Hard determinism}}
[[File:FreeWillTaxonomy4.svg|thumb|A simplified [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of philosophical positions regarding free will and determinism.]]

Determinism can be divided into causal, logical and theological determinism.&lt;ref name="Parkinson2012"&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia|author=G. H. R. Parkinson|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IqbJnEYKpW4C|accessdate=26 December 2012|date=12 October 2012|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-00323-0|title=determinism|pages=891–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corresponding to each of these different meanings, there arises a different problem for free will.&lt;ref name="Viv"&gt;Vihvelin, Kadri, "Arguments for Incompatibilism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2003 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2003/entries/incompatibilism-arguments/ ((online))]&lt;/ref&gt; Hard determinism is the claim that [[determinism]] is true, and that it is [[incompatibilism|incompatible with free will]], so free will does not exist. Although hard determinism generally refers to [[nomological determinism]] (see causal determinism below), it can include all forms of determinism that necessitate the future in its entirety.&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010 /&gt; Relevant forms of determinism include:
;[[Causal determinism]]: The idea that everything is caused by prior conditions, making it impossible for anything else to happen.&lt;ref name=stanfordmoralresponsibility /&gt; In its most common form, [[nomological determinism|nomological (or scientific) determinism]], future events are necessitated by past and present events combined with the laws of nature. Such determinism is sometimes illustrated by the [[thought experiment]] of [[Laplace's demon]]. Imagine an entity that knows all facts about the past and the present, and knows all natural laws that govern the universe. If the laws of nature were determinate, then such an entity would be able to use this knowledge to foresee the future, down to the smallest detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-4975.1993.tb00266.x | last1 = Suppes | first1 = P. | year = 1993 | title = The Transcendental Character of Determinism | url = | journal = Midwest Studies in Philosophy | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 242–57 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=determinism&gt;
The view of ''scientific determinism'' goes back to [[Pierre Simon Laplace|Laplace]]: "We ought to regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its antecedent state." For further discussion see {{cite book |title=The Philosophy of Science: An Encyclopedia. N–Z, Indeks, Volume 1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=od68ge7aF6wC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;lpg=PA197 |pages= 197 ''ff'' |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2006 |chapter=Determinism |isbn=0415939275 |editors=Sahotra Sarkar, Jessica Pfeifer, Justin Garson |author=John T Roberts}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Logical determinism]]: The notion that all [[proposition]]s, whether about the past, present or future, are either true or false. The problem of free will, in this context, is the problem of how choices can be free, given that what one does in the future is already determined as true or false in the present.&lt;ref name="Viv"/&gt;
;[[Theological determinism]]: The idea that the future is already determined, either by a [[creator deity]] decreeing or [[omniscience|knowing]] its outcome in advance.&lt;ref name = "FischerGod1989"&gt;Fischer, John Martin (1989) ''God, Foreknowledge and Freedom''. Stanford, CA: [[Stanford University Press]]. {{ISBN|1-55786-857-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Watt"&gt;Watt, Montgomery (1948) ''Free-Will and Predestination in Early Islam''. London: Luzac &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of free will, in this context, is the problem of how our actions can be free if there is a being who has determined them for us in advance, or if they are already set in time.

Other forms of determinism are more relevant to compatibilism, such as [[biological determinism]], the idea that all behaviors, beliefs, and desires are fixed by our genetic endowment and our biochemical makeup, the latter of which is affected by both genes and environment, [[cultural determinism]] and [[psychological determinism]].&lt;ref name="Viv"/&gt; Combinations and syntheses of determinist theses, such as bio-environmental determinism, are even more common.

Suggestions have been made that hard determinism need not maintain strict determinism, where something near to, like that informally known as [[determinism|adequate determinism]], is perhaps more relevant.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismarguments&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Vihvelin |first=Kadri |editor=Edward N.

====Metaphysical libertarianism====
{{Main|Libertarianism (metaphysics)}}
[[File:FreewillConceptsBasedUponPhilosophyOfMindCausationViews.svg|thumb|Various definitions of free will that have been proposed for Metaphysical Libertarianism (agent/substance causal,&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories/&gt; centered accounts,&lt;ref name="Kane2005" /&gt; and efforts of will theory&lt;ref name="RKane1" /&gt;), along with examples of other common free will positions (Compatibilism,&lt;ref name="Velmans2002"/&gt; Hard Determinism,&lt;ref&gt;Paul Henri Thiry, Baron d'Holbach, ''System of Nature; or, the Laws of the Moral and Physical World'' (London, 1797), Vol. 1, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; and Hard Incompatibilism&lt;ref name="Derk1"/&gt;). Red circles represent mental states; blue circles represent physical states; arrows describe causal interaction.]]

[[libertarianism (metaphysics)|Metaphysical libertarianism]] is one philosophical view point under that of incompatibilism. Libertarianism holds onto a concept of free will that requires that the [[agency (philosophy)|agent]] be able to take more than one possible course of action under a given set of circumstances.

Accounts of libertarianism subdivide into non-physical theories and physical or naturalistic theories. Non-physical theories hold that the events in the brain that lead to the performance of actions do not have an entirely physical explanation, which requires that the world is not closed under physics. This includes [[interactionist dualism]], which claims that some non-physical [[mind]], will, or [[soul]] overrides physical [[causality]]. Physical determinism implies there is only one possible future and is therefore not compatible with libertarian free will. As consequent of incompatibilism, metaphysical libertarian explanations that do not involve dispensing with [[physicalism]] require physical indeterminism, such as probabilistic subatomic particle behavior&amp;nbsp;– theory unknown to many of the early writers on free will. Incompatibilist theories can be categorised based on the type of indeterminism they require; uncaused events, non-deterministically caused events, and agent/substance-caused events.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Randolph |first=Clarke |editor=Edward N. Zalta | title=Incompatibilist (Nondeterministic) Theories of Free Will | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| edition=Fall 2008 | year=2008 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/incompatibilism-theories}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-causal theories====
Non-causal accounts of incompatibilist free will do not require a free action to be caused by either an agent or a physical event. They either rely upon a world that is not causally closed, or physical indeterminism. Non-causal accounts often claim that each intentional action requires a choice or volition&amp;nbsp;– a willing, trying, or endeavoring on behalf of the agent (such as the cognitive component of lifting one's arm).&lt;ref name=LumerNannini2007&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christoph Lumer|author2=Sandro Nannini|title=Intentionality, Deliberation and Autonomy: The Action-Theoretic Basis of Practical Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4LzldxvSk4kC|accessdate=27 December 2012|date=30 November 2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-6058-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McCann1998&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh McCann|title=The Works of Agency: On Human Action, Will, and Freedom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a7HZT-MrFvwC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1998|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8583-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such intentional actions are interpreted as free actions. It has been suggested, however, that such acting cannot be said to exercise control over anything in particular. According to non-causal accounts, the causation by the agent cannot be analysed in terms of causation by mental states or events, including desire, belief, intention of something in particular, but rather is considered a matter of spontaneity and creativity. The exercise of intent in such intentional actions is not that which determines their freedom&amp;nbsp;– intentional actions are rather self-generating. The "actish feel" of some intentional actions do not "constitute that event's activeness, or the agent's exercise of active control", rather they "might be brought about by direct stimulation of someone's brain, in the absence of any relevant desire or intention on the part of that person".&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories /&gt; Another question raised by such non-causal theory, is how an agent acts upon reason, if the said intentional actions are spontaneous.

Some non-causal explanations involve invoking [[panpsychism]], the theory that a quality of [[mind]] is associated with all particles, and pervades the entire universe, in both animate and inanimate entities.

====Event-causal theories====

Event-causal accounts of incompatibilist free will typically rely upon physicalist models of mind (like those of the compatibilist), yet they presuppose physical indeterminism, in which certain indeterministic events are said to be caused by the agent. A number of event-causal accounts of free will have been created, referenced here as ''deliberative indeterminism'', ''centred accounts'', and ''efforts of will theory''.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories /&gt; The first two accounts do not require free will to be a fundamental constituent of the universe. Ordinary randomness is appealed to as supplying the "elbow room" that libertarians believe necessary. A first common objection to event-causal accounts is that the indeterminism could be destructive and could therefore diminish control by the agent rather than provide it (related to the problem of origination). A second common objection to these models is that it is questionable whether such indeterminism could add any value to deliberation over that which is already present in a deterministic world.

''Deliberative indeterminism'' asserts that the indeterminism is confined to an earlier stage in the decision process.&lt;ref name=Ekstrom2000&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Waddell Ekstrom|title=Free Will: A Philosophical Study|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oaOpa7qlz3kC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=2000|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-8133-9093-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mele2006&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfred R.

The selection process is deterministic, although it may be based on earlier preferences established by the same process. Deliberative indeterminism has been referenced by [[Daniel Dennett]]&lt;ref name="Dennett1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Clement Dennett|title=Brainstorms: Philosophical Essays on Mind and Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xwObaAZEwoC|accessdate=27 December 2012|date=13 July 1981|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-54037-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Martin Fischer]].&lt;ref name="L.

''Centred accounts'' propose that for any given decision between two possibilities, the strength of reason will be considered for each option, yet there is still a probability the weaker candidate will be chosen.&lt;ref name=Kane2005&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Kane|title=Free Will|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9BRiQgAACAAJ|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-514970-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Balaguer1999&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mark Balaguer |title=Libertarianism as a Scientifically Reputable View |journal= Philosophical Studies |volume=93 |issue=2 |pages=189–211 |year=1999 |doi=10.1023/a:1004218827363}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nozick1981&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Nozick|title=Philosophical Explanations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N4zH86WogYwC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1981|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-66479-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sorabji1980&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Sorabji|title=Necessity, Cause, and Blame: Perspectives on Aristotle's Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-8tmAAAACAAJ|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1980|publisher=Duckworth|isbn=978-0-7156-1549-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Inwagen1983&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Van Inwagen|title=An Essay on Free Will|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=of1sJaUSdcYC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1983|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-824924-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wiggins1973&gt;{{cite book|author=Ted Honderich|title=Essays on Freedom of Action:Towards a Reasonable Libertarianism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qY9AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1973|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|isbn=978-0-7100-7392-1|pages=33–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Searle2001&gt;{{cite book|author=John R.

''Efforts of will theory'' is related to the role of will power in decision making. It suggests that the indeterminacy of agent volition processes could map to the indeterminacy of certain physical events&amp;nbsp;– and the outcomes of these events could therefore be considered caused by the agent. Models of [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] have been constructed in which it is seen as a particular kind of complex, high-level process with an element of physical indeterminism. An example of this approach is that of [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]], where he hypothesizes that "in each case, the indeterminism is functioning as a hindrance or obstacle to her realizing one of her purposes&amp;nbsp;– a hindrance or obstacle in the form of resistance within her will which must be overcome by effort."&lt;ref name="RKane1"&gt;{{Cite book| title=Four Views on Free Will (Libertarianism)| last=Kane| first=Robert|author2=John Martin Fischer |author3=Derk Pereboom |author4=Manuel Vargas | year=2007| publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Oxford UK| page=39| isbn=1-4051-3486-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Robert Kane such "ultimate responsibility" is a required condition for free will.&lt;ref name="Kane1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Kane|title=The Significance of Free Will|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hhuyeYKsWAkC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510550-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important factor in such a theory is that the agent cannot be reduced to physical neuronal events, but rather mental processes are said to provide an equally valid account of the determination of outcome as their physical processes (see [[non-reductive physicalism]]).

Although at the time [[quantum mechanics]] (and physical [[Quantum indeterminacy|indeterminism]]) was only in the initial stages of acceptance, in his book [[Miracles (book)|''Miracles: A preliminary study'']] C.S. Lewis stated the logical possibility that if the physical world were proved indeterministic this would provide an entry point to describe an action of a non-physical entity on physical reality.&lt;ref name="CSLewis1"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Lewis, C.S. | title=Miracles | year=1947| page=24| isbn=0-688-17369-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indeterminism|Indeterministic]] physical models (particularly those involving [[quantum indeterminacy]]) introduce random occurrences at an atomic or subatomic level. These events might affect brain activity, and could seemingly allow [[Incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] free will if the apparent indeterminacy of some mental processes (for instance, subjective perceptions of control in conscious [[Volition (psychology)|volition]]) map to the underlying indeterminacy of the physical construct. This relationship, however, requires a causative role over probabilities that is questionable,&lt;ref name=quantum&gt;{{cite book |title=Four Views on Free Will (Great Debates in Philosophy) |chapter=Libertarianism |author= Kane, Robert|page=9 |quote=It would seem that undetermined events in the brain or body would occur ''spontaneously'' and would be more likely to ''undermine'' our freedom rather than ''enhance'' it. |isbn=1405134860 |year=2007 |publisher= Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is far from established that brain activity responsible for human action can be affected by such events. Secondarily, these incompatibilist models are dependent upon the relationship between action and conscious volition, as studied in the [[neuroscience of free will]]. It is evident that observation may disturb the outcome of the observation itself, rendering limited our ability to identify causality.&lt;ref name=Bohr1&gt;{{cite web |author=Niels Bohr |title= The Atomic Theory and the Fundamental Principles underlying the Description of Nature; ''Based on a lecture to the Scandinavian Meeting of Natural Scientists and published in Danish in Fysisk Tidsskrift in 1929.

Firstly, it is difficult to establish the reason for any given choice by the agent, which suggests they may be random or determined by ''luck'' (without an underlying basis for the free will decision). Secondly, it has been questioned whether physical events can be caused by an external substance or mind&amp;nbsp;– a common problem associated with [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|interactionalist dualism]].

====Hard incompatibilism====
Hard incompatibilism is the idea that free will cannot exist, whether the world is deterministic or not. [[Derk Pereboom (philosopher)|Derk Pereboom]] has defended hard incompatibilism, identifying a variety of positions where free will is irrelevant to indeterminism/determinism, among them the following:
:#Determinism (D) is true, D does not imply we lack free will (F), but in fact we do lack F.
:#D is true, D does not imply we lack F, but in fact we don't know if we have F.
:#D is true, and we do have F.
:#D is true, we have F, and F implies D.
:#D is unproven, but we have F.
:#D isn't true, we do have F, and would have F even if D were true.
:#D isn't true, we don't have F, but F is compatible with D.
::::::Derk Pereboom, ''Living without Free Will'',&lt;ref name="Derk1"/&gt; p. xvi.
Pereboom calls positions 3 and 4 ''soft determinism'', position 1 a form of ''hard determinism'', position 6 a form of ''classical libertarianism'', and any position that includes having F as ''compatibilism''.

[[John Locke]] denied that the phrase "free will" made any sense (compare with [[theological noncognitivism]], a similar stance on the [[existence of God]]). He also took the view that the truth of determinism was irrelevant. He believed that the defining feature of voluntary behavior was that individuals have the ability to ''postpone'' a decision long enough to reflect or deliberate upon the consequences of a choice: "... the will in truth, signifies nothing but a power, or ability, to prefer or choose".&lt;ref&gt;Locke, J. (1689). ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding'' (1998, ed). Book II, Chap. XXI, Sec. 17. Penguin Classics, Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary philosopher [[Galen Strawson]] agrees with Locke that the truth or falsity of determinism is irrelevant to the
problem.&lt;ref name="GStraw"&gt;Strawson, G. (1998, 2004). "Free will". In E. Craig (ed.), ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. London: Routledge. Retrieved August 17, 2006, [http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014 ((online))] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825055350/http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014 |date=2007-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the notion of free will leads to an infinite regress and is therefore senseless.
According to Strawson, if one is responsible for what one does in a given situation, then one must be responsible for the way one is in certain mental respects. But it is impossible for one to be responsible for the way one is in any respect. This is because to be responsible in some situation ''S'', one must have been responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''. To be responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;'', one must have been responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;'', and so on. At some point in the chain, there must have been an act of origination of a new causal chain. But this is impossible. Man cannot create himself or his mental states ''[[ex nihilo]]''. This argument entails that free will itself is absurd, but not that it is incompatible with determinism. Strawson calls his own view "pessimism" but it can be classified as [[hard incompatibilism]].&lt;ref name="GStraw"/&gt;

=====High-level determinism and free will=====
======Causal determinism======
{{Main|Determinism}}

Causal determinism is the concept that [[Event (philosophy)|events]] within a given [[paradigm]] are bound by [[causality]] in such a way that any state (of an object or event) is completely determined by prior states. Causal determinism proposes that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrences stretching back to the origin of the universe. Causal determinists believe that there is nothing uncaused or [[Causa sui|self-caused]]. The most common form of causal determinism is nomological determinism (or scientific determinism), the notion that the past and the present dictate the future entirely and necessarily by rigid natural laws, that every occurrence results inevitably from prior events. [[Quantum mechanics]] poses a serious challenge to this view.

Fundamental debate continues over whether the physical universe is likely to be [[causal determinism|deterministic]]. Although the scientific method cannot be used to rule out [[indeterminism]] with respect to violations of [[causal closure]], it can be used to identify indeterminism in natural law. [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics]] at present are both [[deterministic system|deterministic]] and [[indeterminism|indeterministic]], and are being constrained by ongoing experimentation.&lt;ref name=GroblacherPaterek2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Groblacher|first1=Simon|last2=Paterek|first2=Tomasz|last3=Kaltenbaek|first3=Rainer|last4=Brukner|first4=Caslav|last5=Zukowski|first5=Marek|last6=Aspelmeyer|first6=Markus|last7=Zeilinger|first7=Anton|title=An experimental test of non-local realism|journal=Nature|volume=446|issue=7138|year=2007|pages=871–75|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/nature05677|pmid=17443179|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.2529|arxiv=0704.2529|bibcode=2007Natur.446..871G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Destiny and fate======
{{Main|Destiny}}

Destiny or fate is a predetermined course of events. It may be conceived as a predetermined future, whether in general or of an individual. It is a concept based on the belief that there is a fixed natural order to the cosmos.

Although often used interchangeably, the words "fate" and "destiny" have distinct connotations.

[[Fate]] generally implies there is a set course that cannot be deviated from, and over which one has no control. Fate is related to [[determinism]], but makes no specific claim of physical determinism. Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be fated externally (see for instance [[theological determinism]]). Destiny likewise is related to determinism, but makes no specific claim of physical determinism. Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be destined to occur.

[[Destiny]] implies there is a set course that cannot be deviated from, but does not of itself make any claim with respect to the setting of that course (i.e., it does not necessarily conflict with [[incompatibilist]] free will). Free will if existent could be the mechanism by which that destined outcome is chosen (determined to represent destiny).&lt;ref name="Blackwell2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben C. Blackwell|title=Christosis: Pauline Soteriology in Light of Deification in Irenaeus and Cyril of Alexandria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDZxSq9nx4IC|accessdate=8 December 2012|date=21 December 2011|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|isbn=978-3-16-151672-6|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Logical determinism======
{{See also|B-theory of time}}
Discussion regarding destiny does not necessitate the existence of supernatural powers. Logical [[determinism]] or determinateness is the notion that all propositions, whether about the past, present, or future, are either true or false. This creates a unique problem for free will given that propositions about the future already have a truth value in the present (that is it is already determined as either true or false), and is referred to as the [[problem of future contingents]].

======Omniscience======
{{Main|Omniscience}}

[[Omniscience]] is the capacity to know everything that there is to know (included in which are all future events), and is a property often attributed to a creator deity. Omniscience implies the existence of destiny. Some authors have claimed that free will cannot coexist with omniscience. One argument asserts that an omniscient creator not only implies destiny but a form of high level [[predeterminism]] such as hard [[theological determinism]] or [[predestination]]&amp;nbsp;– that they have independently fixed all events and outcomes in the universe in advance. In such a case, even if an individual could have influence over their lower level physical system, their choices in regard to this cannot be their own, as is the case with libertarian free will. Omniscience features as an [[incompatible-properties argument]] for the existence of [[God]], known as the [[argument from free will]], and is closely related to other such arguments, for example the incompatibility of [[omnipotence]] with a good creator deity (i.e. if a deity knew what they were going to choose, then they are responsible for letting them choose it).

=====Predeterminism=====

{{See also|Predestination}}

[[Predeterminism]] is the idea that all events are determined in advance.&lt;ref name="McKewan"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=McKewan |first=Jaclyn |editor=H.

Predeterminism is frequently taken to mean that human actions cannot interfere with (or have no bearing on) the outcomes of a pre-determined course of events, and that one's destiny was established externally (for example, exclusively by a creator deity). The concept of predeterminism is often argued by invoking [[causal determinism]], implying that there is an unbroken [[chain of prior occurrences]] stretching back to the origin of the universe. In the case of predeterminism, this chain of events has been pre-established, and human actions cannot interfere with the outcomes of this pre-established chain. Predeterminism can be used to mean such pre-established causal determinism, in which case it is categorised as a specific type of [[determinism]].&lt;ref name="McKewan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/notes-determinism.html |title=Some Varieties of Free Will and Determinism |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=10 September 2009 &lt;!-- date found by checking page's source code where format of date given as m.d.y --&gt;|work=Philosophy 302: Ethics |publisher=philosophy.lander.edu |accessdate=19 December 2012| quote=Predeterminism: the philosophical and theological view that combines God with determinism.

The term predeterminism suggests not just a determining of all events, but the prior and deliberately conscious determining of all events (therefore done, presumably, by a conscious being). While determinism usually refers to a naturalistically explainable causality of events, predeterminism seems by definition to suggest a person or a "someone" who is controlling or planning the causality of events before they occur and who then perhaps resides beyond the natural, causal universe. [[Predestination]] asserts that a supremely powerful being has indeed fixed all events and outcomes in the universe in advance, and is a famous doctrine of the [[Calvinists]] in [[Christian]] theology. Predestination is often considered a form of hard [[theological determinism]].

Predeterminism has therefore been compared to [[fatalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sherman, H. |title=Marx and determinism |quote=Many religions of the world have considered that the path of history is predetermined by God or Fate. On this basis, many believe that what will happen will happen, and they accept their destiny with fatalism. |journal=Journal of Economic Issues |pages=61–71 |year=1981 |jstor=4224996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fatalism is the idea that everything is fated to happen, so that humans have no control over their future.

====Theological determinism====

{{Main|Theological determinism}}

[[Theological determinism]] is a form of [[determinism]] stating that all events that happen are pre-ordained, or [[predestination|predestined]] to happen, by a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[deity]], or that they are destined to occur given its [[omniscience]]. Two forms of theological determinism exist, here referenced as strong and weak theological determinism.&lt;ref name=JordanTate2004&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anne Lockyer Jordan|author2=Anne Lockyer Jordan Neil Lockyer Edwin Tate|author3=Neil Lockyer|author4=Edwin Tate|title=Philosophy of Religion for A Level OCR Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uBVuNip8qjkC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=25 June 2004|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=978-0-7487-8078-5|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first one, strong theological determinism, is based on the concept of a [[creator deity]] dictating all events in history: "everything that happens has been predestined to happen by an omniscient, omnipotent divinity."&lt;ref name=Iannone2001&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Pabl Iannone|title=Dictionary of World Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7wBmBO3vpE4C|accessdate=22 December 2012|year=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-17995-9|page=194|chapter=determinism}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The second form, weak theological determinism, is based on the concept of divine foreknowledge&amp;nbsp;– "because [[God]]'s omniscience is perfect, what God knows about the future will inevitably happen, which means, consequently, that the future is already fixed."&lt;ref name=Huyssteen2003&gt;{{cite book|author=Wentzel Van Huyssteen|title=Encyclopedia of science and religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HIcYAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=22 December 2012|volume=1|year=2003|publisher=Macmillan Reference|isbn=978-0-02-865705-9|page=217|chapter=theological determinism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There exist slight variations on the above categorisation. Some claim that theological determinism requires [[predestination]] of all events and outcomes by the divinity (that is, they do not classify the weaker version as 'theological determinism' unless libertarian free will is assumed to be denied as a consequence), or that the weaker version does not constitute 'theological determinism' at all.&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010&gt;{{cite book|author=Raymond J. VanArragon|title=Key Terms in Philosophy of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JyTohO1AMzwC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=21 October 2010|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4411-3867-5|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theological determinism can also be seen as a form of [[causal determinism]], in which the antecedent conditions are the nature and will of God.&lt;ref name=stanfordmoralresponsibility&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Eshleman |first=Andrew |editor=Edward N. Zalta | title=Moral Responsibility | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| edition=Winter 2009 | year=2009 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2010/entries/determinism-causal}}&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to free will and the classification of theological compatibilism/incompatibilism below, "theological determinism is the thesis that God exists and has infallible knowledge of all true propositions including propositions about our future actions," more minimal criteria designed to encapsulate all forms of theological determinism.&lt;ref name="stanfordincompatibilismarguments"/&gt;

[[File:TheologicalDeterminismXFreeWill.svg|thumb|A simplified [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of philosophical positions regarding free will and theological determinism.&lt;ref name="stanfordforeknowledge" /&gt;]]
There are various implications for [[metaphysical libertarianism|metaphysical libertarian]] free will as consequent of theological determinism and its philosophical interpretation.
* Strong theological determinism is not compatible with metaphysical libertarian free will, and is a form of ''hard theological determinism'' (equivalent to theological fatalism below). It claims that free will does not exist, and ''God'' has absolute control over a person's actions. Hard theological determinism is similar in implication to [[hard determinism]], although it does not invalidate [[compatibilism|compatibilist]] free will.&lt;ref name=stanfordforeknowledge /&gt; Hard theological determinism is a form of theological incompatibilism (see figure, top left).
* Weak theological determinism is either compatible or incompatible with metaphysical libertarian free will depending upon one's philosophical interpretation of [[omniscience]]&amp;nbsp;– and as such is interpreted as either a form of hard theological determinism (known as [[theological fatalism]]), or as ''soft theological determinism'' (terminology used for clarity only). Soft theological determinism claims that humans have free will to choose their actions, holding that God, while [[omniscience|knowing their actions before they happen]], does not affect the outcome. God's providence is "compatible" with voluntary choice. Soft theological determinism is known as theological compatibilism (see figure, top right). A rejection of theological determinism (or [[omniscience|divine foreknowledge]]) is classified as theological incompatibilism also (see figure, bottom), and is relevant to a more general discussion of free will.&lt;ref name="stanfordforeknowledge"/&gt;

The basic argument for theological fatalism in the case of weak theological determinism is as follows:
# Assume divine foreknowledge or [[omniscience]]
# [[infallibility|Infallible]] foreknowledge implies destiny (it is known for certain what one will do)
# Destiny eliminates alternate possibility (one cannot do otherwise)
# Assert incompatibility with metaphysical libertarian free will

This argument is very often accepted as a basis for theological incompatibilism: denying either libertarian free will or divine foreknowledge (omniscience) and therefore theological determinism. On the other hand, theological compatibilism must attempt to find problems with it. The formal version of the argument rests on a number of premises, many of which have received some degree of contention. Theological compatibilist responses have included:
* Deny the truth value of [[Problem of future contingents|future contingents]], as proposed for example by [[Aristotle]] (although this denies foreknowledge and therefore theological determinism).
* Assert differences in non-temporal knowledge (space-time independence), an approach taken for example by [[Boethius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Boethius | title=The Consolation of Philosophy | chapter=Book V, Prose vi}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Aquinas, St. Thomas | title=Summa Theologica | chapter=Ia, q. 14, art 13.}} See [[Summa Theologica]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[C.S. Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=C.S. Lewis | title=Mere Christianity | publisher=Touchstone:New York | year=1980 | page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Deny the Principle of [[Alternative Possibilities|Alternate Possibilities]]: "If you cannot do otherwise when you do an act, you do not act freely." For example, a human observer could in principle have a machine that could detect what will happen in the future, but the existence of this machine or their use of it has no influence on the outcomes of events.&lt;ref name=zagzebski1991&gt;{{cite book|author=Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski|title=The Dilemma of Freedom and Foreknowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0v9nLMBtGYcC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=25 April 1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510763-0|chapter=chapter 6, section 2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the definition of [[compatibilism]] and [[incompatibilism]], the literature often fails to distinguish between physical determinism and higher level forms of determinism (predeterminism, theological determinism, etc.) As such, hard determinism with respect to theological determinism (or "Hard Theological Determinism" above) might be classified as hard incompatibilism with respect to physical determinism (if no claim was made regarding the internal causality or determinism of the universe), or even compatibilism (if freedom from the constraint of determinism was not considered necessary for free will), if not hard determinism itself. By the same principle, metaphysical libertarianism (a form of incompatibilism with respect to physical determinism) might be classified as compatibilism with respect to theological determinism (if it was assumed such free will events were pre-ordained and therefore were destined to occur, but of which whose outcomes were not "predestined" or determined by God). If hard theological determinism is accepted (if it was assumed instead that such outcomes were predestined by God), then metaphysical libertarianism is not, however, possible, and would require reclassification (as hard incompatibilism for example, given that the universe is still assumed to be indeterministic&amp;nbsp;– although the classification of hard determinism is technically valid also).&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010 /&gt;

=====Mind-body problem=====
{{Main|Mind–body problem}}
{{See also|Philosophy of mind|Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Monism|Physicalism}}
[[File:Frans Hals - Portret van René Descartes.jpg|thumb|upright|[[René Descartes]]]]

The idea of ''free will'' is one aspect of the [[Mind–body problem|mind-body problem]], that is, consideration of the relation between [[mind]] (for example, consciousness, memory, and judgment) and body (for example, the [[human brain]] and [[nervous system]]). [[Philosophy of Mind|Philosophical models of mind]] are divided into [[Physicalism|physical]] and non-physical expositions.

[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Substance dualism|Cartesian dualism]] holds that the mind is a nonphysical substance, the seat of consciousness and intelligence, and is not identical with physical states of the brain or body. It is suggested that although the two worlds do interact, each retains some measure of autonomy. Under cartesian dualism external mind is responsible for bodily action, although unconscious brain activity is often caused by external events (for example, the instantaneous reaction to being burned).&lt;ref name=Peruzzi&gt;See for example: {{cite book |title=Mind and Causality |chapter=Chapter 5: Mental causation and intentionality in a mind naturalizing theory |author=Sandro Nannini |editor=Alberto Peruzzi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zYEPifPTQK4C&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA77 |pages=69 ''ff'' |isbn=1588114759 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartesian dualism implies that the physical world is not deterministic&amp;nbsp;– and in which external mind controls (at least some) physical events, providing an interpretation of [[incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] free will. Stemming from Cartesian dualism, a formulation sometimes called ''[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Interactionism|interactionalist dualism]]'' suggests a two-way interaction, that some physical events cause some mental acts and some mental acts cause some physical events. One modern vision of the possible separation of mind and body is the [[Popper's three worlds|"three-world" formulation]] of [[Karl Popper|Popper]].&lt;ref name=Popper&gt;{{cite book |title=All Life is Problem Solving |chapter=Notes of a realist on the body-mind problem |author=Karl Raimund Popper |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pa3cZYwdq28C&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23 |pages=23 ''ff'' |isbn=0415174864 |year=1999 |publisher=Psychology Press |quote=The body-mind relationship...includes the problem of man's position in the physical world...'World 1'. The world of conscious human processes I shall call 'World 2', and the world of the objective creations of the human mind I shall call 'World 3'. |edition=A lecture given in Mannheim, 8 May 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartesian dualism and Popper's three worlds are two forms of what is called [[epistemological pluralism]], that is the notion that different epistemological methodologies are necessary to attain a full description of the world. Other forms of epistemological pluralist dualism include [[psychophysical parallelism]] and [[epiphenomenalism]]. Epistemological pluralism is one view in which the mind-body problem is ''not'' reducible to the concepts of the natural sciences.

A contrasting approach is called [[physicalism]]. Physicalism is a [[philosophical theory]] holding that everything that [[existence|exists]] is no more extensive than its [[physical properties]]; that is, that there are no non-physical substances (for example physically independent minds). Physicalism can be reductive or non-reductive. [[Reductive physicalism]] is grounded in the idea that everything in the world can actually be reduced analytically to its fundamental physical, or material, basis. Alternatively, [[non-reductive physicalism]] asserts that mental properties form a separate ontological class to physical properties: that mental states (such as [[qualia]]) are not ontologically reducible to physical states. Although one might suppose that mental states and neurological states are different in kind, that does not rule out the possibility that mental states are correlated with neurological states. In one such construction, [[anomalous monism]], mental events [[Supervenience|''supervene'']] on physical events, describing the [[emergence]] of mental properties correlated with physical properties&amp;nbsp;– implying causal reducibility. Non-reductive physicalism is therefore often categorised as [[property dualism]] rather than [[monism]], yet other types of property dualism do not adhere to the causal reducibility of mental states (see epiphenomenalism).

[[Incompatibilism]] requires a distinction between the mental and the physical, being a commentary on the incompatibility of (determined) physical reality and one's presumably distinct experience of will. Secondarily, [[metaphysical libertarianism|metaphysical libertarian]] free will must assert influence on physical reality, and where mind is responsible for such influence (as opposed to ordinary system randomness), it must be distinct from body to accomplish this. Both substance and property dualism offer such a distinction, and those particular models thereof that are not causally inert with respect to the physical world provide a basis for illustrating incompatibilist free will (i.e. interactionalist dualism and non-reductive physicalism).

It has been noted that the [[Physical law|laws of physics]] have yet to resolve the [[hard problem of consciousness]]:&lt;ref name=Kalat&gt;

===Compatibilism===
{{Main|Compatibilism}}
[[File:Thomas Hobbes (portrait).jpg|upright|thumb|[[Thomas Hobbes]] was a classical compatibilist.]]

Compatibilists maintain that determinism is compatible with free will. They believe freedom can be present or absent in a situation for reasons that have nothing to do with metaphysics. For instance, [[courts of law]] make judgments about whether individuals are acting under their own free will under certain circumstances without bringing in metaphysics. Similarly, [[political liberty]] is a non-metaphysical concept.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Likewise, some compatibilists define free will as freedom to act according to one's determined motives without hindrance from other individuals. So for example Aristotle in his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Susan Sauve Meyer, ''Aristotle on Moral Responsibility.'', Oxford 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and the Stoic Chrysippus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susanne Bobzien|Bobzien, Susanne]], ''Freedom and Determinism in Stoic Philosophy'', Oxford 1998, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast, the [[incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] positions are concerned with a sort of "metaphysically free will", which compatibilists claim has never been coherently defined. Compatibilists argue that determinism does not matter; though they disagree among themselves about what, in turn, ''does'' matter. To be a compatibilist, one need not endorse any particular conception of free will, but only deny that determinism is at odds with free will.&lt;ref name="CompSEP"&gt;McKenna, Michael, "Compatibilism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2004 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.),[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2004/entries/compatibilism/ ((online))]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are various impediments to exercising one's choices, free will does not imply freedom of action. Freedom of choice (freedom to select one's will) is logically separate from freedom to ''implement'' that choice (freedom to enact one's will), although not all writers observe this distinction.&lt;ref name="OConnor"/&gt; Nonetheless, some philosophers have defined free will as the absence of various impediments. Some "modern compatibilists", such as [[Harry Frankfurt]] and [[Daniel Dennett]], argue free will is simply freely choosing to do what constraints allow one to do. In other words, a coerced agent's choices can still be free if such coercion coincides with the agent's personal intentions and desires.&lt;ref name="DD1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett, D. |year=1984 |title= Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting |publisher= Bradford Books |isbn=0-262-54042-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P4NtNzOKxycC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Frankfurt&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.2307/2024717 | last1=Frankfurt |first1= H. | year=1971 | pages=5–20 |title= Freedom of the Will and the Concept of the Person | issue=1 | volume=68 |journal=Journal of Philosophy |jstor= 2024717 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as lack of physical restraint====
Most "classical compatibilists", such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], claim that a person is acting on the person's own will only when it is the desire of that person to do the act, and also possible for the person to be able to do otherwise, ''if the person had decided to''. Hobbes sometimes attributes such compatibilist freedom to each individual and not to some abstract notion of ''will'', asserting, for example, that "no liberty can be inferred to the will, desire, or inclination, but the liberty of the man; which consisteth in this, that he finds no stop, in doing what he has the will, desire, or inclination to doe{{sic}}&lt;!-- sic, that is how Hobbes wrote it; don't change to "do". --&gt;."&lt;ref name="Hobbes"&gt;Hobbes, T. (1651) ''Leviathan'' [http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=585&amp;search=%22finds+no+stop%22&amp;chapter=89860&amp;layout=html#a_2025807 Chapter XXI.: "Of the liberty of subjects"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511122711/http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=585&amp;search=%22finds+no+stop%22&amp;chapter=89860&amp;layout=html |date=2011-05-11 }} (1968 edition). London: Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt; In articulating this crucial proviso, [[David Hume]] writes, "this hypothetical liberty is universally allowed to belong to every one who is not a prisoner and in chains."&lt;ref name="Hume"&gt;Hume, D. (1740). ''A Treatise of Human Nature'' Section VIII.: "[http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=341&amp;search=%22prisoner+chains%22&amp;chapter=61966&amp;layout=html#a_606067 Of liberty and necessity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511122708/http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=341&amp;search=%22prisoner+chains%22&amp;chapter=61966&amp;layout=html |date=2011-05-11 }}" (1967 edition). [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford. {{ISBN|0-87220-230-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Voltaire]], in his ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique]]'', claimed that "Liberty then is only and can be only the power to do what one will." He asked, "would you have everything at the pleasure of a million blind caprices?" For him, free will or liberty is "only the power of acting, what is this power? It is the effect of the constitution and present state of our organs."

====Free will as a psychological state====
Compatibilism often regards the agent free as virtue of their reason. Some explanations of free will focus on the internal causality of the mind with respect to higher-order brain processing&amp;nbsp;– the interaction between conscious and unconscious brain activity.&lt;ref name=Baumeister&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford Handbook of Human Action |chapter=Chapter 23: Free Willpower: A limited resource theory of volition, choice and self-regulation |author1=Roy F Baumeister |author2=Matthew T Galliot |author3=Dianne M Tice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFP1AZYlNmcC&amp;pg=PA487&amp;lpg=PA487 |pages=487 ''ff'' |editor1=Ezequiel Morsella |editor2=John A.

{{cite book |title=Oxford Handbook of Human Action |chapter=Chapter 23: Free Willpower: A limited resource theory of volition, choice and self-regulation |author1=Roy F Baumeister |author2=Matthew T Galliot |author3=Dianne M Tice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFP1AZYlNmcC&amp;pg=PA487&amp;lpg=PA487 |pages= 487 ''ff'' |editors=Ezequiel Morsella, John A.

Our findings suggest that the traditional folk notions of willpower and character strength have some legitimate basis in genuine phenomena.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Compatibilist free will has also been attributed to our natural [[sense of agency]], where one must believe they are an agent in order to function and develop a [[theory of mind]].&lt;ref name="Smilansky2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Saul Smilansky|title=Free Will and Illusion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPUTQq7CUfwC|accessdate=6 February 2013|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-825018-0|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gallagher | first1 = S. | year = 2000 | title = Philosophical conceptions of the self: implications for cognitive science | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 14–21 | doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(99)01417-5| pmid = 10637618 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of levels of decision is presented in a different manner by Frankfurt.&lt;ref name=Frankfurt/&gt; Frankfurt argues for a version of compatibilism called the "hierarchical mesh". The idea is that an individual can have conflicting desires at a first-order level and also have a desire about the various first-order desires (a second-order desire) to the effect that one of the desires prevails over the others. A person's will is identified with their effective first-order desire, that is, the one they act on, and this will is free if it was the desire the person wanted to act upon, that is, the person's second-order desire was effective. So, for example, there are "wanton addicts", "unwilling addicts" and "willing addicts". All three groups may have the conflicting first-order desires to want to take the drug they are addicted to and to not want to take it.

The first group, ''wanton addicts'', have no second-order desire not to take the drug. The second group, "unwilling addicts", have a second-order desire not to take the drug, while the third group, "willing addicts", have a second-order desire to take it. According to Frankfurt, the members of the first group are devoid of will and therefore are no longer persons. The members of the second group freely desire not to take the drug, but their will is overcome by the addiction. Finally, the members of the third group willingly take the drug they are addicted to. Frankfurt's theory can ramify to any number of levels. Critics of the theory point out that there is no certainty that conflicts will not arise even at the higher-order levels of desire and preference.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, D. (1982). ''Free Will''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that Frankfurt offers no adequate explanation of how the various levels in the hierarchy mesh together.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, John Martin, and Mark Ravizza. (1998). ''Responsibility and Control: An Essay on Moral Responsibility''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as unpredictability====
In ''[[Elbow Room (book)|Elbow Room]]'', Dennett presents an argument for a compatibilist theory of free will, which he further elaborated in the book ''[[Freedom Evolves]]''.&lt;ref name="DD2"&gt;Dennett, D. (2003) ''Freedom Evolves''. Viking Books. {{ISBN|0-670-03186-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic reasoning is that, if one excludes God, an infinitely powerful [[demon]], and other such possibilities, then because of [[chaos theory|chaos]] and epistemic limits on the precision of our knowledge of the current state of the world, the future is ill-defined for all finite beings. The only well-defined things are "expectations". The ability to do "otherwise" only makes sense when dealing with these expectations, and not with some unknown and unknowable future.

According to Dennett, because individuals have the ability to act differently from what anyone expects, free will can exist.&lt;ref name="DD2"/&gt; Incompatibilists claim the problem with this idea is that we may be mere "automata responding in predictable ways to stimuli in our environment". Therefore, all of our actions are controlled by forces outside ourselves, or by random chance.&lt;ref name="Kaney"&gt;Kane, R. ''The Oxford Handbook to Free Will''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-513336-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More sophisticated analyses of compatibilist free will have been offered, as have other critiques.&lt;ref name="CompSEP"/&gt;

In the philosophy of [[decision theory]], a fundamental question is: From the standpoint of statistical outcomes, to what extent do the choices of a conscious being have the ability to influence the future? [[Newcomb's paradox]] and other philosophical problems pose questions about free will and predictable outcomes of choices.

====The physical mind====
{{See also|Neuroscience of free will}}

[[Compatibilist]] models of free will often consider deterministic relationships as discoverable in the physical world (including the brain). Cognitive [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]&lt;ref name=naturalism&gt;A key exponent of this view was [[Willard van Orman Quine]]. See {{cite web |title=Willard van Orman Quine |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/quine/ |author=Hylton, Peter |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2010 Edition) |editor= Edward N. Zalta |date=Apr 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[physicalism|physicalist]] approach to studying human [[cognition]] and [[consciousness]] in which the mind is simply part of nature, perhaps merely a feature of many very complex self-programming feedback systems (for example, [[neural networks]] and [[Cognitive robotics|cognitive robots]]), and so must be studied by the methods of empirical science, such as the [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral]] and [[cognitive science]]s (''i.e.'' [[neuroscience]] and [[cognitive psychology]]).&lt;ref name=Peruzzi/&gt;&lt;ref name=physicalism&gt;

A thoughtful list of careful distinctions regarding the application of empirical science to these issues is found in {{cite web |author=Stoljar, Daniel |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2009/entries/physicalism/#12 |title=Physicalism: §12 – Physicalism and the physicalist world picture |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2009 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |date=Sep 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive naturalism stresses the role of neurological sciences. Overall brain health, [[substance dependence]], [[Long-term depression|depression]], and various [[personality disorders]] clearly influence mental activity, and their impact upon [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] is also important.&lt;ref name=Baumeister /&gt; For example, an [[substance abuse|addict]] may experience a conscious desire to escape addiction, but be unable to do so. The "will" is disconnected from the freedom to act. This situation is related to an abnormal production and distribution of [[dopamine]] in the brain.&lt;ref name=Volkow&gt;
{{cite book |title=Science In Medicine: The JCI Textbook Of Molecular Medicine |chapter=The addicted human brain: insights from imaging studies |author1=Nora D Volkow |author2=Joanna S Fowler |author3=Gene-Jack Wang |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ykvt1S9n8V0C&amp;pg=PA1061 |pages=1061 ''ff'' |isbn=0763750832 |year=2007 |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |editor1=Andrew R Marks |editor2=Ushma S Neill }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The neuroscience of free will places restrictions on both compatibilist and incompatibilist free will conceptions.

Compatibilist models adhere to models of mind in which mental activity (such as deliberation) can be reduced to physical activity without any change in physical outcome. Although compatibilism is generally aligned to (or is at least compatible with) physicalism, some compatibilist models describe the natural occurrences of deterministic deliberation in the brain in terms of the first person perspective of the conscious agent performing the deliberation.&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt; Such an approach has been considered a form of identity dualism. A description of "how conscious experience might affect brains" has been provided in which "the experience of conscious free will is the first-person perspective of the neural correlates of choosing."&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt;

Recently{{when|date=August 2018}} [[Claudio Costa (philosopher)|Claudio Costa]] developed a neocompatibilist theory based on the causal theory of action that is complementary to classical compatibilism. According to him, physical, psychological and rational restrictions can interfer at different levels of the causal chain that would naturally lead to action. Corrrespondingly, there can be physical restrictions to the body, psychological restrictions to the decision, and rational restrictions to the formation of reasons (desires plus beliefs) that should lead to what we would call a reasonable action. The last two are usually called "restrictions of free will". The restriction at the level of reasons is particularly important, since it can be motivated by external reasons that are insufficiently conscious to the agent. One example was the collective suicide led by [[Jim Jones]]. The suicidal agents were not conscious that their free will have been manipulated by external, even if ungrounded, reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Claudio Costa [http://www.example''Lines of Thought: Rethinking Philosophical Assumptions''] CSP, 2014, Ch. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other views===
Some philosophers' views are difficult to categorize as either compatibilist or incompatibilist, hard determinist or libertarian. For example, [[Ted Honderich]] holds the view that "determinism is true, compatibilism and incompatibilism are both false" and the real problem lies elsewhere. Honderich maintains that determinism is true because quantum phenomena are not events or things that can be located in space and time, but are [[Abstract object|abstract]] entities. Further, even if they were micro-level events, they do not seem to have any relevance to how the world is at the macroscopic level. He maintains that incompatibilism is false because, even if indeterminism is true, incompatibilists have not provided, and cannot provide, an adequate account of origination. He rejects compatibilism because it, like incompatibilism, assumes a single, fundamental notion of freedom. There are really two notions of freedom: voluntary action and origination. Both notions are required to explain freedom of will and responsibility. Both determinism and indeterminism are threats to such freedom. To abandon these notions of freedom would be to abandon moral responsibility. On the one side, we have our intuitions; on the other, the scientific facts. The "new" problem is how to resolve this conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Honderich, T. (2001). "Determinism as True, Compatibilism and Incompatibilism as Both False and the Real Problem" in ''The Free Will Handbook'', edited by Robert Kane of the University of Texas. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as an illusion====
[[File:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|upright|Spinoza thought that there is no free will.]]
:"Experience teaches us no less clearly than reason, that men believe themselves free, simply because they are conscious of their actions, and unconscious of the causes whereby those actions are determined." [[Baruch Spinoza]], ''Ethics''&lt;ref name=Spinoza&gt;{{cite book |author= Benedict de Spinoza |year=2008 |chapter= Part III: On the origin and nature of the emotions; Postulates (Proposition II, Note) |editor= R.H.M.

David Hume discussed the possibility that the entire debate about free will is nothing more than a merely "verbal" issue. He suggested that it might be accounted for by "a false sensation or seeming experience" (a ''velleity''), which is associated with many of our actions when we perform them. On reflection, we realize that they were necessary and determined all along.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D. (1765). ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', Indianapolis: Hacket Publishing Co. Second edition. 1993. {{ISBN|0-87220-230-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schopenhauer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] claimed that phenomena have no free will but the will as [[Noumena|noumenon]], is free.]]
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] put the puzzle of free will and moral responsibility in these terms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone believes himself, ''a priori'', perfectly free&amp;nbsp;– even in his individual actions, and thinks that at every moment he can commence another manner of life. ... But ''a posteriori'', through experience, he finds to his astonishment that he is not free, but subjected to necessity, that in spite of all his resolutions and reflections he does not change his conduct, and that from the beginning of his life to the end of it, he must carry out the very character which he himself condemns...&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur, ''The Wisdom of Life'', p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In his essay ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', Schopenhauer stated, "You can do what you will, but in any given moment of your life you can ''will'' only one definite thing and absolutely nothing other than that one thing."&lt;ref&gt;[[Schopenhauer]], Arthur, ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', Oxford: Basil Blackwell {{ISBN|0-631-14552-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schopenhauer, [[phenomena]] do not have free will. However, [[Will (philosophy)|will]] [urging, craving, striving, wanting, and desiring] as [[Noumena|noumenon]] is free.

====Free will as "moral imagination"====
[[Rudolf Steiner]], who collaborated in a complete edition of Arthur Schopenhauer's work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arthur Schopenhauers sämtliche Werke in zwölf Bänden. Mit Einleitung von Dr. Rudolf Steiner, Stuttgart: Verlag der J.G. Cotta'schen Buchhandlung Nachfolger, o.J. (1894–96)|first=Rudolf|last=Steiner|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~kafka/k_s_bibII.html |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote ''The [[Philosophy of Freedom]]'', which focuses on the problem of free will. Steiner (1861–1925) initially divides this into the two aspects of freedom: ''freedom of thought'' and ''freedom of action''. The controllable and uncontrollable aspects of decision making thereby are made logically separable, as pointed out in the introduction. This separation of ''will'' from ''action'' has a very long history, going back at least as far as [[Stoicism]] and the teachings of [[Chrysippus]] (279–206 BCE), who separated external ''antecedent'' causes from the internal disposition receiving this cause.&lt;ref name=Chrysippus&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9lRD6feR3hEC&amp;pg=PA529 |page=529 |chapter=Chapter VI: The Chyrsippean notion of fate: soft determinism |author=Keimpe Algra |isbn=0521250285 |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner then argues that inner freedom is achieved when we integrate our sensory impressions, which reflect the outer appearance of the world, with our thoughts, which lend coherence to these impressions and thereby disclose to us an understandable world. Acknowledging the many influences on our choices, he nevertheless point out that they do not preclude freedom unless we fail to recognise them. Steiner argues that outer freedom is attained by permeating our deeds with ''moral imagination.” “Moral” in this case refers to action that is willed, while “imagination” refers to the mental capacity to envision conditions that do not already hold. Both of these functions are necessarily conditions for freedom. Steiner aims to show that these two aspects of inner and outer freedom are integral to one another, and that true freedom is only achieved when they are united.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, R. (1964). Rudolf Steiner Press, London, 1964, 1970, 1972, 1979, 230 pp., translated from the 12th German edition of 1962 by Michael Wilson. [http://www.rsarchive.org/Books/GA004/ ((online))]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as a pragmatically useful concept====
[[William James]]' views were ambivalent. While he believed in free will on "ethical grounds", he did not believe that there was evidence for it on scientific grounds, nor did his own introspections support it.&lt;ref&gt;See Bricklin, Jonathan, "A Variety of Religious Experience: William James and the Non-Reality of Free Will", in Libet (1999), ''The Volitional Brain: Toward a Neuroscience of Free Will'' (Thorverton UK: Imprint Academic).&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately he believed that the problem of free will was a metaphysical issue and, therefore, could not be settled by science. Moreover, he did not accept incompatibilism as formulated below; he did not believe that the indeterminism of human actions was a prerequisite of moral responsibility. In his work ''[[Pragmatism]]'', he wrote that "instinct and utility between them can safely be trusted to carry on the social business of punishment and praise" regardless of metaphysical theories.&lt;ref name="JW"&gt;James, W. (1907) ''Pragmatism'' (1979 edition). Cambridge, MA: [[Harvard University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; He did believe that indeterminism is important as a "doctrine of relief"&amp;nbsp;– it allows for the view that, although the world may be in many respects a bad place, it may, through individuals' actions, become a better one. Determinism, he argued, undermines [[meliorism]]&amp;nbsp;– the idea that progress is a real concept leading to improvement in the world.&lt;ref name="JW"/&gt;

====Free will and views of causality====
{{See also|Principle of sufficient reason}}

In 1739, [[David Hume]] in his ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' approached free will via the notion of causality. It was his position that causality was a mental construct used to explain the repeated association of events, and that one must examine more closely the relation between things ''regularly succeeding'' one another (descriptions of regularity in nature) and things that ''result'' in other things (things that cause or necessitate other things).&lt;ref name=Kane&gt;
{{cite book |title=The significance of free will |author=Robert Kane |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dBlXH3FtwJIC&amp;pg=PA226 |page= 226 |chapter=Notes to pages 74–81, note 22 |isbn=0195126564 |year=1998 |edition=Paperback}}
&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hume, 'causation' is on weak grounds: "Once we realise that 'A must bring about B' is tantamount merely to 'Due to their constant conjunction, we are psychologically certain that B will follow A,' then we are left with a very weak notion of necessity."&lt;ref name=Lorkowski&gt;{{cite web |author=CM Lorkowski |date=November 7, 2010 |title=David Hume: Causation |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hume-cau/ |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This empiricist view was often denied by trying to prove the so-called [[apriority]] of causal law (i.e. that it precedes all experience and is rooted in the construction of the perceivable world):
* [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s proof in ''Critique of Pure Reason'' (which referenced time and time ordering of causes and effects)&lt;ref&gt;Kant argued that, in order that human life is not just a "dream" (a random or projected by subjects juxtaposition of moments), the temporality of event A as before or after B must submit to a rule. An established order then implies the existence of some necessary conditions and causes, that is: sufficient bases (a so-called sufficient reason is the coincidence of all the necessary conditions). Without established causality, both [[Transcendental apperception|in subject]] and in the external world, the passing of time would be impossible, because it is essentially directional. See [[s:Critique of Pure Reason/Volume 1/Division 1#B. SECOND ANALOGY. Principle of the Succession of Time According to the Law of Causality. All changes take place according to the law of the connection of Cause and Effect.|online text of his proof]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s proof from ''The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason'' (which referenced the so-called intellectuality of representations, that is, in other words, objects and [[qualia]] perceived with senses)&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, who by the way continued and simplified Kant's system, argued (among others basing on optical illusions and the "initial processing") that it is the intellect or even the brain what generates the image of the world out of something else, by ''concluding from effects, e.g. optical, about appropriate causes'', e.g. concrete physical objects. Intellect in his works is strictly connected with recognizing causes and effects and associating them, it is somewhat close to the contemporary view of [[cerebral cortex]] and formation of associations. The intellectuality of all perception implied then of course that causality is rooted in the world, precedes and enables experience. See [[s:Page:On the Fourfold Root, and On the Will in Nature.djvu/90|online text of his proof]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1780s [[Immanuel Kant]] suggested at a minimum our decision processes with moral implications lie outside the reach of everyday causality, and lie outside the rules governing material objects.&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;

Freeman introduces what he calls "circular causality" to "allow for the contribution of self-organizing dynamics", the "formation of macroscopic population dynamics that shapes the patterns of activity of the contributing individuals", applicable to "interactions between neurons and neural masses ... and between the behaving animal and its environment".&lt;ref name=Freeman&gt;{{cite book |title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |editor1=Susan Pockett |editor2=WP Banks |editor3=Shaun Gallagher |chapter=Consciousness, intentionality and causality |author=Freeman, Walter J. |publisher=MIT Press |year =2009 |isbn=0262512572 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5CaTnNksgkC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88 |page=88| quote=Circular causality departs so strongly from the classical tenets of necessity, invariance, and precise temporal order that the only reason to call it that is to satisfy the human habitual need for causes....

====Free will according to Thomas Aquinas====

Thirteenth century philosopher [[Thomas Aquinas]] viewed humans as pre-programmed (by virtue of being human) to seek certain goals, but able to choose between routes to achieve these goals (our Aristotelian [[telos (philosophy)|telos]]). His view has been associated with both compatibilism and libertarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 2| issue = 2| page = 74| last = Staley| first = Kevin M.| title = Aquinas: Compatibilist or Libertarian| journal = The Saint Anselm Journal| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 2005| url = http://www.anselm.edu/Documents/Institute%20for%20Saint%20Anselm%20Studies/Abstracts/4.5.3.2h_22Staley.pdf| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151221073832/http://www.anselm.edu/Documents/Institute%20for%20Saint%20Anselm%20Studies/Abstracts/4.5.3.2h_22Staley.pdf| archivedate = 2015-12-21| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Hartung| first = Christopher| title = Thomas Aquinas on Free Will| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = May 2013| publisher = University of Delaware| url = http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/12979}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In facing choices, he argued that humans are governed by ''intellect'', ''will'', and ''passions''. The will is "the primary mover of all the powers of the soul ... and it is also the efficient cause of motion in the body."&lt;ref name=Stump&gt;

A discussion of the roles of will, intellect and passions in Aquinas' teachings is found in {{cite book |title=Aquinas, ''Arguments of the philosophers series'' |author= Stump, Eleonore|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1GvL3eKhoM8C&amp;pg=PA278&amp;lpg=PA278 |pages=278 ''ff'' |isbn=0415029600 |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge (Psychology Press) |chapter= Intellect and will}}

&lt;/ref&gt; Choice falls into five stages: (i) intellectual consideration of whether an objective is desirable, (ii) intellectual consideration of means of attaining the objective, (iii) will arrives at an intent to pursue the objective, (iv) will and intellect jointly decide upon choice of means (v) will elects execution.&lt;ref name=OConnor0&gt;{{cite web |author=Timothy O'Connor |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/freewill/ |title= Free Will |work= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition) |editor= Edward N.

Furthermore, there are always external constraints on the range of options we can meaningfully try to undertake. As the presence or absence of these conditions and constraints are not (usually) our responsibility, it is plausible that the central loci of our responsibility are our choices, or "willings".}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free will enters as follows: Free will is an "appetitive power", that is, not a cognitive power of intellect (the term "appetite" from Aquinas's definition "includes all forms of internal inclination").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01656a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Appetite |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1907-03-01 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states that judgment "concludes and terminates counsel. Now counsel is terminated, first, by the judgment of reason; secondly, by the acceptation of the appetite [that is, the free-will]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1083.htm |title=Summa Theologica: Free-will (Prima Pars, Q. 83) |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A compatibilist interpretation of Aquinas's view is defended thus: "Free-will is the cause of its own movement, because by his free-will man moves himself to act. But it does not of necessity belong to liberty that what is free should be the first cause of itself, as neither for one thing to be cause of another need it be the first cause. God, therefore, is the first cause, Who moves causes both natural and voluntary. And just as by moving natural causes He does not prevent their acts being natural, so by moving voluntary causes He does not deprive their actions of being voluntary: but rather is He the cause of this very thing in them; for He operates in each thing according to its own nature."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa Theologiae'', Q83 A1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Further discussion of this compatibilistic theory can be found in Thomas' ''Summa contra gentiles'', Book III about Providence, c. 88–91 (260–67), where it is postulated that everything has its cause and it is again and again in detail referred also to all individual choices of man etc., even refuting opposite views. [http://dhspriory.org/thomas/ContraGentiles3b.htm#88 Here the online text of the Summa]. In order to avoid, at least in concept, the absolution of man of any guilt he then notes the contingency of all that takes place, i.e. lack of ''direct'' necessity from God strictly with regard to a concrete ("contingent") act. A typical choice was not separately ordained to be so-and-so by God; St. Thomas says the choice is not necessary, but in fact that apparently means it was ''contingent'' with regard to God and the law of nature (as a specific case that could have not existed in other circumstances), and ''necessary'' with regard to its direct previous cause in will and intellect. (The contingency, or fortuity, is even intuitive under modern [[chaos theory]], where one can try to show that more and more developed products appearing in the evolution of a universe or, simpler, an automaton are [[chaos theory|chaotic]] with regard to its principles.)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as a pseudo-problem====

Historically, most of the philosophical effort invested in resolving the dilemma has taken the form of close examination of definitions and ambiguities in the concepts designated by "free", "freedom", "will", "choice" and so forth. Defining 'free will' often revolves around the meaning of phrases like [https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22ability+to+do+otherwise%22+%22free+will%22&amp;gws_rd=ssl "ability to do otherwise"] or [https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22alternative+possibilities%22+%22free+will%22&amp;gws_rd=ssl "alternative possibilities"]. This emphasis upon words has led some philosophers to claim the problem is merely verbal and thus a pseudo-problem.&lt;ref name=Deery&gt;
{{cite book |title=The Philosophy of Free Will: Essential Readings from the Contemporary Debates |author1=Paul Russell |author2=Oisin Deery |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CLyi7nmzr28C&amp;pg=PA5 |page=5 |chapter=I. The free will problem – real or illusory |isbn=9780199733392 |year=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press }}
&lt;/ref&gt; In response, others point out the complexity of decision making and the importance of nuances in the terminology.

===History of free will===

The problem of free will has been identified in [[ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosophical]] literature. The notion of compatibilist free will has been attributed to both [[Aristotle]] (fourth century BCE) and [[Epictetus]] (1st century CE); "it was the fact that nothing hindered us from doing or choosing something that made us have control over them".&lt;ref name=bobzien1998determinism&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| last = Bobzien| first = Susanne| title = Determinism and freedom in Stoic philosophy| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 1998| url = https://books.google.com/?id=7kmTeOjHIqkC&amp;pg=PR12|quote="...Aristotle and Epictetus: In the latter authors it was the fact that nothing hindered us from doing or choosing something that made us have control over them. In Alexander's account, the terms are understood differently: what makes us have control over things is the fact that we are causally undetermined in our decision and thus can freely decide between doing/choosing or not doing/choosing them."| isbn = 9780198237945}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Bobzien| first = Susanne| title = Did Epicurus discover the free-will problem?| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 2000| url = http://philpapers.org/rec/BOBDED}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Susanne Bobzien]], the notion of incompatibilist free will is perhaps first identified in the works of [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] (third century CE); "what makes us have control over things is the fact that we are causally undetermined in our decision and thus can freely decide between doing/choosing or not doing/choosing them".

The term "free will" (''liberum arbitrium'') was introduced by Christian philosophy (4th century CE). It has traditionally meant (until the Enlightenment proposed its own meanings) lack of necessity in human will,&lt;ref&gt;A. Schopenhauer, ''On the Freedom of the Will'', c. 1, "What is freedom?"&lt;/ref&gt; so that "the will is free" meant "the will does not have to be such as it is". This requirement was universally embraced by both incompatibilists and compatibilists.&lt;ref&gt;Hence the notion of contingency appeared as the very opposition of necessity, so that wherever a thing is considered dependent or relies upon another thing, it is contingent and thus not necessary.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific approaches==

Science has contributed to the free will problem in at least three ways. First, physics has addressed the question whether nature is deterministic, which is viewed as crucial by incompatibilists (compatibilists, however, view it as irrelevant). Second, although free will can be defined in various ways, all of them involve aspects of the way people make decisions and initiate actions, which have been studied extensively by neuroscientists. Some of the experimental observations are widely viewed as implying that free will does not exist or is an illusion (but many philosophers see this as a misunderstanding). Third, psychologists have studied the beliefs that the majority of ordinary people hold about free will and its role in assigning moral responsibility.

===Quantum physics===
Early scientific thought often portrayed the universe as deterministic&amp;nbsp;– for example in the thought of [[Democritus]] or the [[Cārvāka]]ns&amp;nbsp;– and some thinkers claimed that the simple process of gathering sufficient [[physical information|information]] would allow them to predict future events with perfect accuracy. Modern science, on the other hand, is a mixture of deterministic and [[stochastic]] theories.&lt;ref&gt;Boniolo, G. and Vidali, P. (1999) ''Filosofia della Scienza'', Milan: Mondadori. {{ISBN|88-424-9359-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quantum mechanics]] predicts events only in terms of probabilities, casting doubt on whether the universe is deterministic at all, although evolution of the universal state vector is completely deterministic. Current physical theories cannot resolve the question of whether determinism is true of the world, being very far from a potential [[Theory of Everything]], and open to many different [[Interpretation of quantum mechanics|interpretations]].&lt;ref name="stanfordcausaldeterminism"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Carl |last=Hoefer |title=Causal Determinism |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=2008-04-01 |accessdate=2008-11-01 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Is the Universe Deterministic? |first=Vlatko |last=Vedral |volume=192 |issue=2578 |date=2006-11-18 |journal=New Scientist |quote=Physics is simply unable to resolve the question of free will, although, if anything, it probably leans towards determinism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming that an indeterministic interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct, one may still object that such indeterminism is for all practical purposes confined to microscopic phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytho/dfwVariousHonderichKanebook.htm |author=Honderich, E.|title= Determinism as True, Compatibilism and Incompatibilism as Both False, and the Real Problem |publisher=Ucl.ac.uk |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not always the case: many macroscopic phenomena are based on quantum effects. For instance, some [[hardware random number generator]]s work by amplifying quantum effects into practically usable signals. A more significant question is whether the indeterminism of quantum mechanics allows for the traditional idea of free will (based on a perception of free will). If a person's action is, however, only a result of complete quantum randomness, and mental processes as experienced have no influence on the probabilistic outcomes (such as volition),&lt;ref name="RKane1"/&gt; According to many interpretations, non-determinism enables free will to exist,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/quantum-physics-free-will/&lt;/ref&gt; while others assert the opposite (because the action was not controllable by the physical being who claims to possess the free will).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/features/2000/lujan1.html |title=Infidels. "Metaphysical Freedom" |publisher=Infidels.org |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetics===
Like physicists, [[biology|biologists]] have frequently addressed questions related to free will. One of the most heated debates in biology is that of "[[nature versus nurture]]", concerning the relative importance of genetics and biology as compared to culture and environment in human behavior.&lt;ref name="Pin"&gt;Pinel, P. J. (1990) ''Biopsychology''. Prentice Hall Inc. {{ISBN|88-15-07174-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view of many researchers is that many human behaviors can be explained in terms of humans' brains, genes, and evolutionary histories.&lt;ref&gt;DeFries, J.C., McGuffin, P., McClearn, G.E., Plomin, R. (2000) ''Behavioral Genetics'' 4th ed. W H Freeman &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris, D. (1967) ''The Naked Ape''. New York:McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|0-385-33430-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawk"&gt;Dawkins, R. (1976) ''The Selfish Gene''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|88-04-39318-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This point of view raises the fear that such attribution makes it impossible to hold others responsible for their actions. [[Steven Pinker]]'s view is that fear of determinism in the context of "genetics" and "evolution" is a mistake, that it is "a confusion of ''explanation'' with ''exculpation''". Responsibility does not require that behavior be uncaused, as long as behavior responds to praise and blame.&lt;ref name="Pink"&gt;Pinker, S. (2002) ''The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature''. London: Penguin. p. 179 {{ISBN|0-14-200334-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it is not certain that environmental determination is any less threatening to free will than genetic determination.&lt;ref name="Lew"&gt;Lewontin, R. (2000). ''It Ain't Necessarily So: The Dream of the Human Genome and other Illusions''. New York: NYREV Inc. {{ISBN|88-420-6418-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroscience and Neurophilosophy===
{{Main|Neurophilosophy|Neuroscience of free will}}
{{see also|Neurostimulation}}

It has become possible to study the living [[Human brain|brain]], and researchers can now watch the brain's decision-making process at work. A seminal experiment in this field was conducted by [[Benjamin Libet]] in the 1980s, in which he asked each subject to choose a random moment to flick their wrist while he measured the associated activity in their brain; in particular, the build-up of electrical signal called the [[readiness potential]] (after German [[Bereitschaftspotential]], which was discovered by [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]], 1965. Hirnpotentialänderungen bei Willkürbewegungen und passiven Bewegungen des Menschen: Bereitschaftspotential und reafferente Potentiale. Pflügers Arch 284: 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt;) Although it was well known that the readiness potential reliably preceded the physical action, Libet asked whether it could be recorded before the conscious intention to move. To determine when subjects felt the intention to move, he asked them to watch the second hand of a clock. After making a movement, the volunteer reported the time on the clock when they first felt the conscious intention to move; this became known as Libet's W time.&lt;ref name="LGW" /&gt;

Libet found that the ''unconscious'' brain activity of the readiness potential leading up to subjects' movements began approximately half a second before the subject was aware of a conscious intention to move.&lt;ref name="LGW"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0140525X00044903 | last1 = Libet | first1 = B. | year = 1985 | title = Unconscious cerebral initiative and the role of conscious will in voluntary action | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 529–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These studies of the timing between actions and the conscious decision bear upon the role of the brain in understanding free will. A subject's declaration of intention to move a finger appears ''after'' the brain has begun to implement the action, suggesting to some that unconsciously the brain has made the decision ''before'' the conscious mental act to do so. Some believe the implication is that free will was not involved in the decision and is an illusion. The first of these experiments reported the brain registered activity related to the move about 0.2 s before movement onset.&lt;ref name=Libet&gt;

The bearing of these results upon notions of free will appears complex.&lt;ref name=Strother&gt;{{cite journal|title=The conscious experience of action and intention |author1=Lars Strother |author2=Sukhvinder Singh Obhi |journal=Exp Brain Res |volume=198 |year=2009 |pages=535–39 |doi=10.1007/s00221-009-1946-7 |url=http://publish.uwo.ca/~lstroth/StrotherObhi_EBR_2009.pdf |issue=4 |pmid=19641911 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217013640/http://publish.uwo.ca/~lstroth/StrotherObhi_EBR_2009.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Rosenbaum&gt;A brief discussion of possible interpretation of these results is found in {{cite book |title=Human Motor Control |page=86 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MsFmds_ACBwC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86 |isbn=0123742269 |year=2009 |edition=2nd |publisher=Academic Press |author=David A. Rosenbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that placing the question of free will in the context of motor control is too narrow. The objection is that the time scales involved in motor control are very short, and motor control involves a great deal of unconscious action, with much physical movement entirely unconscious. On that basis "... free will cannot be squeezed into time frames of 150–350 ms; free will is a longer term phenomenon" and free will is a higher level activity that "cannot be captured in a description of neural activity or of muscle activation...."&lt;ref name=Gallagher&gt;{{cite book |title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |author= Gallagher, Shaun|chapter=Chapter 6: Where's the action?

More studies have since been conducted, including some that try to:
* support Libet's original findings
* suggest that the cancelling or "veto" of an action may first arise subconsciously as well
* explain the underlying brain structures involved
* suggest models that explain the relationship between conscious intention and action

[[Benjamin Libet]]'s results are quoted&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Wegner|Wegner D.]], 2002. The Illusion of Conscious Will. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; in favor of epiphenomenalism, but he believes subjects still have a "conscious veto", since the readiness potential does not invariably lead to an action. In ''[[Freedom Evolves]]'', [[Daniel Dennett]] argues that a no-free-will conclusion is based on dubious assumptions about the location of consciousness, as well as questioning the accuracy and interpretation of Libet's results. [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] underlined that absence of conscious will during the early Bereitschaftspotential (termed BP1) is not a proof of the non-existence of free will, as also unconscious agendas may be free and non-deterministic. According to their suggestion, man has relative freedom, i.e. freedom in degrees, that can be in- or decreased through deliberate choices that involve both conscious and unconscious (panencephalic) processes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]], 2012. ''The will and its brain – an appraisal of reasoned free will''. University Press of America, Lanham, MD, {{ISBN|978-0-7618-5862-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have argued that data such as the [[Bereitschaftspotential]] undermine epiphenomenalism for the same reason, that such experiments rely on a subject reporting the point in time at which a conscious experience occurs, thus relying on the subject to be able to consciously perform an action. That ability would seem to be at odds with early epiphenomenalism, which according to Huxley is the broad claim that consciousness is "completely without any power… as the steam-whistle which accompanies the work of a locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery".&lt;ref name="Flanagan1992"&gt;{{cite book |first=O.J. |last=Flanagan |year=1992 |title=Consciousness Reconsidered |series=Bradford Books |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-56077-1 |lccn=lc92010057 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yFOqQgAACAAJ |page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been shown that in several brain-related conditions, individuals cannot entirely control their own actions, though the existence of such conditions does not directly refute the existence of free will. Neuroscientific studies are valuable tools in developing models of how humans experience free will.

For example, people with [[Tourette syndrome]] and related [[tic disorder]]s make involuntary movements and utterances (called [[tic]]s) despite the fact that they would prefer not to do so when it is socially inappropriate. Tics are described as semi-voluntary or ''unvoluntary'',&lt;ref name=TSADef&gt;Tourette Syndrome Association. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050322170245/http://www.tsa-usa.org/research/definitions.html Definitions and Classification of Tic Disorders.]. Retrieved 19 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; because they are not strictly ''involuntary'': they may be experienced as a ''voluntary'' response to an unwanted, premonitory urge. Tics are experienced as irresistible and must eventually be expressed.&lt;ref name=TSADef/&gt; People with Tourette syndrome are sometimes able to suppress their tics for limited periods, but doing so often results in an explosion of tics afterward. The control exerted (from seconds to hours at a time) may merely postpone and exacerbate the ultimate expression of the tic.&lt;ref name=Zinner&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zinner | first1 = S.H. | year = 2000 | title = Tourette disorder | url = | journal = Pediatric Review | volume = 21 | issue = 11| pmid = 11077021 | pages = 372–83 | doi=10.1542/pir.21-11-372| doi-broken-date = 2018-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[alien hand syndrome]], the afflicted individual's [[limb (anatomy)|limb]] will produce unintentional movements without the will of the person. The affected limb effectively demonstrates 'a will of its own.' The [[sense of agency]] does not emerge in conjunction with the overt appearance of the purposeful act even though the sense of ownership in relationship to the body part is maintained. This phenomenon corresponds with an impairment in the premotor mechanism manifested temporally by the appearance of the readiness potential (see section on the Neuroscience of Free Will above) recordable on the scalp several hundred milliseconds before the overt appearance of a spontaneous willed movement. Using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] with specialized multivariate analyses to study the temporal dimension in the activation of the cortical network associated with voluntary movement in human subjects, an anterior-to-posterior sequential activation process beginning in the supplementary motor area on the medial surface of the frontal lobe and progressing to the primary motor cortex and then to parietal cortex has been observed.&lt;ref name=Kayser&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/hbm.20771 | last1 = Kayser | first1 = A.S. | last2 = Sun | first2 = F.T. | last3 = D'Esposito | first3 = M. | year = 2009 | title = A comparison of Granger causality and coherency in fMRI-based analysis of the motor system | url = | journal = Human Brain Mapping | volume = 30 | issue = 11| pages = 3475–94 | pmid = 19387980 | pmc = 2767459 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sense of agency]] thus appears to normally emerge in conjunction with this orderly sequential network activation incorporating premotor association cortices together with primary motor cortex. In particular, the supplementary motor complex on the medial surface of the frontal lobe appears to activate prior to primary motor cortex presumably in associated with a preparatory pre-movement process. In a recent study using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]], alien movements were characterized by a relatively isolated activation of the primary motor cortex contralateral to the alien hand, while voluntary movements of the same body part included the natural activation of motor association cortex associated with the premotor process.&lt;ref name=Assal&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/ana.21173 | last1 = Assal | first1 = F. | last2 = Schwartz | first2 = S. | last3 = Vuilleumier | first3 = P. | year = 2007 | title = Moving with or without will: Functional neural correlates of alien hand syndrome | url = | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 62 | issue = 3| pages = 301–06 | pmid = 17638304 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The clinical definition requires "feeling that one limb is foreign or has a ''will of its own,'' together with observable involuntary motor activity" (emphasis in original).&lt;ref name=Doody&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.55.9.806 | last1 = Doody | first1 = RS | last2 = Jankovic | first2 = J. | year = 1992 | title = The alien hand and related signs | url = | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 55 | issue = 9| pages = 806–10 | pmid = 1402972 | pmc = 1015106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This syndrome is often a result of damage to the [[corpus callosum]], either when it is severed to treat intractable [[epilepsy]] or due to a [[stroke]].

In addition, one of the most important ("first rank") diagnostic symptoms of [[schizophrenia]] is the patient's delusion of being controlled by an external force.&lt;ref name=Schneider&gt;Schneider, K. (1959). ''Clinical Psychopathology.''

This is sometimes likened to being a robot controlled by someone else. Although the neural mechanisms of schizophrenia are not yet clear, one influential hypothesis is that there is a breakdown in brain systems that compare motor commands with the feedback received from the body (known as [[proprioception]]), leading to attendant [[hallucination]]s and [[delusions of control]].&lt;ref name=frith&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0165-0173(99)00052-1 | last1 = Frith | first1 = CD | last2 = Blakemore | first2 = S | last3 = Wolpert | first3 = DM | title = Explaining the symptoms of schizophrenia: abnormalities in the awareness of action | journal = Brain Research.

===Experimental psychology===
{{See also|Cognitive science|Cognitive psychology|Neuroscience}}
[[Experimental psychology]]'s contributions to the free will debate have come primarily through social psychologist [[Daniel Wegner]]'s work on conscious will. In his book, ''The Illusion of Conscious Will''&lt;ref name = "WegnerBook"&gt;Wegner, D.M. (2002). ''The illusion of conscious will.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Wegner summarizes what he believes is [[empirical evidence]] supporting the view that human perception of conscious control is an illusion. Wegner summarizes some empirical evidence that may suggest that the perception of conscious control is open to modification (or even manipulation). Wegner observes that one event is inferred to have caused a second event when two requirements are met:
# The first event immediately precedes the second event, and
# The first event is consistent with having caused the second event.
For example, if a person hears an explosion and sees a tree fall down that person is likely to infer that the explosion caused the tree to fall over. However, if the explosion occurs after the tree falls down (that is, the first requirement is not met), or rather than an explosion, the person hears the ring of a telephone (that is, the second requirement is not met), then that person is not likely to infer that either noise caused the tree to fall down.

Wegner has applied this principle to the inferences people make about their own conscious will. People typically experience a thought that is consistent with a behavior, and then they observe themselves performing this behavior. As a result, people infer that their thoughts must have caused the observed behavior. However, Wegner has been able to manipulate people's thoughts and behaviors so as to conform to or violate the two requirements for causal inference.&lt;ref name="WegnerBook"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.54.7.480 | last1 = Wegner | first1 = D.M. | last2 = Wheatley | first2 = T. | year = 1999 | title = Apparent mental causation: sources of the experience of will | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 54 | issue = 7| pages = 480–91 | pmid=10424155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through such work, Wegner has been able to show that people often experience conscious will over behaviors that they have not, in fact, caused&amp;nbsp;– and conversely, that people can be led to experience a lack of will over behaviors they did cause. For instance, [[priming (psychology)|priming]] subjects with information about an effect increases the probability that a person falsely believes is the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Emily Pronin]] has argued that the subjective experience of free will is supported by the [[introspection illusion]]. This is the tendency for people to trust the reliability of their own introspections while distrusting the introspections of other people. The theory implies that people will more readily attribute free will to themselves rather than others. This prediction has been confirmed by three of Pronin and Kugler's experiments. When college students were asked about personal decisions in their own and their roommate's lives, they regarded their own choices as less predictable. Staff at a restaurant described their co-workers' lives as more determined (having fewer future possibilities) than their own lives. When weighing up the influence of different factors on behavior, students gave desires and intentions the strongest weight for their own behavior, but rated personality traits as most predictive of other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pronin|first=Emily|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, Vol. 41|editor=Mark P. Zanna|chapter=The Introspection Illusion |volume=41|publisher=Academic Press|pages=42–43|year=2009|isbn=978-0-12-374472-2|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)00401-2|ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists have shown that reducing a person's belief in free will makes them less helpful and more aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = RF | last2 = Masicampo | first2 = EJ | last3 = Dewall | first3 = CN | year = 2009 | title = Prosocial benefits of feeling free: disbelief in free will increases aggression and reduces helpfulness | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 35 | issue = 2| pages = 260–68 | doi = 10.1177/0146167208327217 | pmid = 19141628 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may occur because the subject loses a sense of [[self-efficacy]].

Caveats have, however, been identified in studying a subject's awareness of mental events, in that the process of introspection itself may alter the experience.&lt;ref name=Pockett&gt;{{cite book|title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |chapter=The neuroscience of movement |author=Susan Pockett |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5CaTnNksgkC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19 |page=19 |editor1=Susan Pockett |editor2=WP Banks |editor3=Shaun Gallagher |publisher=MIT Press |year =2009 |isbn=0262512572|quote=...it is important to be clear about exactly what experience one wants one's subjects to introspect. Of course, explaining to subjects exactly what the experimenter wants them to experience can bring its own problems–...instructions to attend to a particular internally generated experience can easily alter both the timing and the content of that experience and even whether or not it is consciously experienced at all.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J.B. Miles]] contradicts the idea that free will has prosocial benefits, recognizing that many distinguished minds have already brought up the negative effects that such a belief would ensure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miles | first1 = J.B. | year = 2011 | title = 'Irresponsible and a Disservice': The integrity of social psychology turns on the free will dilemma | url = | journal = British Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 2| pages = 205–18 | doi = 10.1111/j.2044-8309.2011.02077.x | pmid = 22074173 | pmc = 3757306 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The explanation for the commonality of this mix-up is a lack of knowledge regarding the free will debate in psychological research. Miles analyzed the methods of popular studies and concluded that such research purported to be examining associations between behavior and disbelief in free will are actually examining the associations between behavior and belief in fatalism. While evidence of the negative effects of a belief in fatalism is legitimate, the research fails to study the effects of belief on free will which they claim to discuss. This occurrence is due to an incorrect understanding and implication that fatalism accompanies determinism. Fatalism is distinguished by the idea that decisions lack effect on the future because everything is determined. Conversely, determinism is the belief that everything operates under cause and effect; every action determines a reaction. Determinism, therefore emphasizes the importance and responsibility one has in decision making as every choice will have an accompanying effect. Seeing this flaw throughout commonly cited research, Miles presents countering research which includes “evidence that the myth of free choice encourages immoral, unjust, prejudiced, and anti-intellectual behaviour.” Miles suggests that while both extremes of fatalism and belief in free will result in negative social outcomes, determinism serves to encourage intentional, prosocial decision making. Ultimately, the point of this research is to encourage accurate knowledge of the free will debate when conducting and evaluating such studies in experimental psychology.

Regardless of the validity of, or benefit of, belief in free will, it may be beneficial to understand where the idea comes from. One contribution is randomness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ebert | first1 = J.P. | last2 = Wegner | first2 = D.M. | year = 2011 | title = March 1). Mistaking randomness for free will | url = | journal = Consciousness and Cognition | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 965–71 | doi = 10.1016/j.concog.2010.12.012 | pmid = 21367624 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is established that randomness is not the only factor in the perception of the free will, it has been shown that randomness can be mistaken as free will due to its indeterminacy. This misconception applies both when considering oneself and others. Another contribution is choice.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, G., Baumeister, R.F., &amp; Wong, K.F. (2014, July 30). Free will is about choosing: The link between choice and the belief in free will. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 55, 239–45. {{doi|10.1016/j.jesp.2014.07.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been demonstrated that people's belief in free will increases if presented with a simple level of choice. The specificity of the amount of choice is important, as too little or too great a degree of choice may negatively influence belief. It is also likely that the associative relationship between level of choice and perception of free will is influentially bidirectional. It is also possible that one's desire for control, or other basic motivational patterns, act as a third variable.

===Believing in free will{{anchor|Believing in free will}}===
In recent years, free will belief in individuals has been analysed with respect to traits in social behaviour. In general the concept of free will researched to date in this context has been that of the incompatibilist, or more specifically, the libertarian, that is freedom from determinism.

====What people believe====
Whether people naturally adhere to an incompatibilist model of free will has been questioned in the research. Eddy Nahmias has found that incompatibilism is not intuitive&amp;nbsp;– it was not adhered to, in that determinism does not negate belief in moral responsibility (based on an empirical study of people's responses to moral dilemmas under a deterministic model of reality).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nahmias|first=Eddy|author2=Stephen G Morris|author3=Thomas Nadelhoffer|author4=Jason Turner|date=2006-07-01|title=Is Incompatibilism Intuitive?|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|volume=73|issue=1|pages=28–53|doi=10.1111/j.1933-1592.2006.tb00603.x|issn=1933-1592|citeseerx=10.1.1.364.1083}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2011-04-29--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Cokely has found that incompatibilism is intuitive&amp;nbsp;– it was naturally adhered to, in that determinism does indeed negate belief in moral responsibility in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feltz|first=Adam|author2=Edward T.

Studies indicate that peoples' belief in free will is inconsistent. Emily Pronin and Matthew Kugler found that people believe they have more free will than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1012046108| pmid = 21149703| volume = 107| issue = 52| pages = 22469–74| last = Pronin| first = Emily|author2=Matthew B.

Studies also reveal a correlation between the likelihood of accepting a deterministic model of mind and personality type. For example, Adam Feltz and Edward Cokely found that people of an extrovert personality type are more likely to dissociate belief in determinism from belief in moral responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feltz|first=Adam|author2=Edward T.

[[Roy Baumeister]] and colleagues reviewed literature on the psychological effects of a belief (or disbelief) in free will. The first part of their analysis (which the only relevant part to this section) was not meant to discover the types of free will that actually exist. The researchers instead sought to identify what people believe, how many people believed it, and the effects of those beliefs. Baumeister found that most people tend to believe in a sort of "naive compatibilistic free will".&lt;ref name=BAC&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R. | last2 = Crescioni | first2 = A.W. | last3 = Alquist | first3 = J. | year = 2009 | title = Free will as advanced action control for human social life and culture | url = | journal = Neuroethics | volume =4| issue = | pages =1–11| doi = 10.1007/s12152-010-9058-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paulhus, D.L. and Margesson.

Taking into account all these personal variables existing in the debates over free will, Manuel Vargas has generally assumed that in fact “there is nearly always an unremarked upon elephant that lurks in rooms where philosophers discuss free will”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vargas|first=Manuel|date=2004|title=Libertarianism and Skepticism about Free Will|journal=Philosophical Topics|volume=32|issue=1|pages=403–426|doi=10.5840/philtopics2004321/210|issn=0276-2080}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he particularly pointed to the role of (i)religion in motivating and sustaining various accounts of free will. As he put,&lt;blockquote&gt;My guess is that we would learn that a disproportionate number—perhaps even most—libertarians are religious and, especially, Christian. I suspect we would also learn that the overwhelming majority of compatibilists are atheist or agnostic. (I do not have a guess about the religious predilections of the various stripes of skeptical incompatibilists.) Even so, it may not be obvious why the religious beliefs of particular philosophers should matter. We could think that the arguments of the various partisans in free will debates should be judged on their merits, irrespective of whether or not they have religious motivation. However, systematically ignoring the role of religion can remove important considerations from view, considerations that affect how we think about, argue, and evaluate the various philosophical possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;For example, by a detailed analysis of the writings and work of Arthur Eddington and Arthur Holy Compton in the English speaking world of the late 1920s and 1930s, one analysis clearly revealed not only a strong intrinsic religious motivation and specific conservative worldview concerns behind their own work on free will, but also similar personal, political and ideological factors, only of the opposite sign, in their opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Kožnjak|first=Boris|title=The Earliest Missionaries of 'Quantum Free Will': A Socio-Historical Analysis|volume=6|date=2018|work=Free Will &amp; Action|pages=131–154|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-99295-2_10|isbn=9783319992945|series=Historical-Analytical Studies on Nature, Mind and Action}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Among philosophers====
A recent 2009 survey has shown that compatibilism is quite a popular stance among those who specialize in philosophy (59%). Belief in libertarianism amounted to 14%, while a lack of belief in free will equaled 12%. More than a half of surveyed people were US Americans.&lt;ref&gt;D. Bourget, D.J. Chalmers: ''What do philosophers believe?''. Philosophical Studies (3): 1–36 (2013). [http://philpapers.org/archive/BOUWDP.pdf Online text here]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Among evolutionary biologists====
79 percent of evolutionary biologists said that they believe in free-will according to a survey conducted in 2007, only 14 percent chose no free will, and 7 percent did not answer the question.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory W. Graffin and William B. Provine, “Evolution, Religion, and Free Will,” American Scientist 95 (July–August 2007), 294–97; results of Cornell Evolution Project survey,

====Effects of the belief itself====
{{see also|Self-efficacy}}

{{Quotebox|align=right|width=40%|quoted=1|quote= An alternative explanation builds on the idea that subjects tend to confuse determinism with fatalism... What happens then when agents’ self-efficacy is undermined? It is not that their basic desires and drives are defeated. It is rather, I suggest, that they become skeptical that they can control those desires; and in the face of that skepticism, they fail to apply the effort that is needed even to try. If they were tempted to behave badly, then coming to believe in fatalism makes them less likely to resist that temptation.|source=—Richard Holton&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt;}}
Baumeister and colleagues found that provoking disbelief in free will seems to cause various negative effects. The authors concluded, in their paper, that it is belief in [[determinism]] that causes those negative effects.&lt;ref name=BAC/&gt; This may not be a very justified conclusion, however.&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt; First of all, free will can at least refer to either [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian (indeterministic) free will]] or [[Compatibilism|compatibilistic (deterministic) free will]]. Having participants read articles that simply "disprove free will" is unlikely to increase their understanding of determinism, or the compatibilistic free will that it still permits.&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt;

In other words, "provoking disbelief in free will" probably causes a belief in [[fatalism]]. As discussed earlier in this article, compatibilistic free will is illustrated by statements like ''"my choices have causes, and an effect&amp;nbsp;– so I affect my future"'', whereas fatalism is more like ''"my choices have causes, but no effect&amp;nbsp;– I am powerless"''. Fatalism, then, may be what threatens people's sense of [[self-efficacy]]. Lay people should not confuse fatalism with determinism, and yet even professional philosophers occasionally confuse the two. It is thus likely that the negative consequences below can be accounted for by participants developing a belief in ''fatalism'' when experiments attack belief in "free will".&lt;ref name=Holton&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holton | first1 = Richard | year = 2011 | title = Response to 'Free Will as Advanced Action Control for Human Social Life and Culture' by Roy F.

Alquist | url = | journal = Neuroethics | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 13–16 | doi = 10.1007/s12152-009-9046-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To test the effects of belief in determinism, future studies would need to provide articles that do not simply "attack free will", but instead focus on explaining determinism and compatibilism. Some studies have been conducted indicating that people react strongly to the way in which mental determinism is described, when reconciling it with moral responsibility. Eddy Nahmias has noted that when people's actions are framed with respect to their beliefs and desires (rather than their neurological underpinnings), they are more likely to dissociate determinism from moral responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nahmias|first=Eddy|author2=D.

Various social behavioural traits have been correlated with the belief in deterministic models of mind, some of which involved the experimental subjection of individuals to libertarian and deterministic perspectives.

After researchers provoked volunteers to disbelieve in free will, participants lied, cheated, and stole more. Kathleen Vohs has found that those whose belief in free will had been eroded were more likely to cheat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02045.x| volume = 19| issue = 1| pages = 49–54| last = Vohs| first = Kathleen D.|author2=Jonathan W.

Baumeister and colleagues also note that volunteers disbelieving in free will are less capable of [[counterfactual thinking]].&lt;ref name=BAC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alquist, J.L., M. Daly, T. Stillman, and R.F. Baumeister, (2009). [Belief in determinism decreases counterfactual thinking].

Along similar lines, Tyler Stillman has found that belief in free will predicts better job performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1177/1948550609351600| volume = 1| issue = 1| pages = 43–50| last = Stillman| first = Tyler F.|author2=Roy F.

==Eastern philosophy==

===Hindu philosophy===
{{see also|Free will in theology#Hinduism}}
The six orthodox ([[astik]]a) schools of thought in [[Hindu philosophy]] do not agree with each other entirely on the question of free will. For the [[Samkhya]], for instance, matter is without any freedom, and soul lacks any ability to control the unfolding of matter. The only real freedom (''kaivalya'') consists in realizing the ultimate separateness of matter and self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fapXqp-JSL0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=kaivalya|title=The ascetic self: subjectivity, memory and tradition |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-60401-7|page=73|last=Flood|first=Gavin|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Yoga]] school, only [[Ishvara]] is truly free, and its freedom is also distinct from all feelings, thoughts, actions, or wills, and is thus not at all a freedom of will. The metaphysics of the [[Nyaya]] and [[Vaisheshika]] schools strongly suggest a belief in determinism, but do not seem to make explicit claims about determinism or free will.&lt;ref name="koller"&gt;Koller, J. (2007) ''Asian Philosophies''. 5th ed. Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-092385-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A quotation from [[Swami Vivekananda]], a [[Vedanta|Vedantist]], offers a good example of the worry about free will in the Hindu tradition.
{{quote|text=Therefore we see at once that there cannot be any such thing as free-will; the very words are a contradiction, because will is what we know, and everything that we know is within our universe, and everything within our universe is moulded by conditions of time, space and causality. ... To acquire freedom we have to get beyond the limitations of this universe; it cannot be found here.&lt;ref name = "viveka"/&gt;}}
However, the preceding quote has often been misinterpreted as Vivekananda implying that everything is predetermined. What Vivekananda actually meant by lack of free will was that the will was not "free" because it was heavily influenced by the law of cause and effect&amp;nbsp;– "The will is not free, it is a phenomenon bound by cause and effect, but there is something behind the will which is free."&lt;ref name = "viveka"&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda]] (1907) {{cite web |url=http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_5/sayings_and_utterances.htm |title=Sayings and utterances |publisher=ramakrishnavivekananda.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vivekananda never said things were absolutely determined and placed emphasis on the power of conscious choice to alter one's past [[Karma in Hinduism|karma]]: "It is the coward and the fool who says this is his [[Destiny|fate]]. But it is the strong man who stands up and says I will make my own fate."&lt;ref name = "viveka"/&gt;

===Buddhist philosophy===
[[Buddhism]] accepts both freedom and determinism (or something similar to it), but in spite of its focus towards the human agency, rejects the western concept of a total agent from external sources.&lt;ref name="Gier"&gt;Gier, Nicholas and Kjellberg, Paul. "Buddhism and the Freedom of the Will: Pali and Mahayanist Responses" in Freedom and Determinism. Campbell, Joseph Keim; O'Rourke, Michael; and Shier, David. 2004. MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]], "There is free action, there is retribution, but I see no agent that passes out from one set of momentary elements into another one, except the [connection] of those elements."&lt;ref name="Gier"/&gt; Buddhists believe in neither absolute free will, nor determinism. It preaches a middle doctrine, named ''[[pratitya-samutpada]]'' in [[Sanskrit]], often translated as "inter-dependent arising". This theory is also called "Conditioned Genesis" or "[[Dependent Origination]]". It teaches that every volition is a conditioned action as a result of ignorance. In part, it states that free will is inherently conditioned and not "free" to begin with. It is also part of the theory of [[karma in Buddhism]]. The concept of karma in Buddhism is different from the notion of karma in Hinduism. In Buddhism, the idea of karma is much less deterministic. The Buddhist notion of karma is primarily focused on the cause and effect of moral actions in this life, while in Hinduism the concept of karma is more often connected with determining one's [[destiny]] in future lives.

In Buddhism it is taught that the idea of absolute freedom of choice (that is that any human being could be completely free to make any choice) is unwise, because it denies the reality of one's physical needs and circumstances. Equally incorrect is the idea that humans have no choice in life or that their lives are pre-determined. To deny freedom would be to deny the efforts of Buddhists to make moral progress (through our capacity to freely choose compassionate action). ''Pubbekatahetuvada'', the belief that all happiness and suffering arise from previous actions, is considered a wrong view according to Buddhist doctrines. Because Buddhists also reject [[agency (philosophy)|agenthood]], the traditional compatibilist strategies are closed to them as well. Instead, the Buddhist philosophical strategy is to examine the metaphysics of causality. Ancient India had many heated arguments about the nature of causality with [[Jain]]s, [[Nyaya|Nyayists]], [[Samkhya|Samkhyists]], [[Cārvāka]]ns, and Buddhists all taking slightly different lines. In many ways, the Buddhist position is closer to a theory of "conditionality" than a theory of "causality", especially as it is expounded by [[Nagarjuna]] in the ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]''.&lt;ref name="Gier"/&gt;

==In theology==
{{Main|Free will in theology}}

=== Christianity ===
[[File:Antonio Rodríguez - Saint Augustine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|Augustine's view of free will and predestination would go on to have a profound impact on Christian theology]]

The notions of free will and predestination are heavily debated among Christians. Free will in the Christian sense is the ability to choose between good or evil. Among Catholics, there are those holding to [[Thomism]], adopted from what [[Thomas Aquinas]] put forth in the ''[[Summa Theologica]].'' There are also some holding to [[Molinism]] which was put forth by Jesuit priest [[Luis de Molina]]. Among Protestants there is [[Arminianism]], held primarily by [[Methodist]] and some [[Baptist]], and formulated by Dutch theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]]; and there is also [[Calvinism]] held by most in the [[Reformed]] tradition which was formulated by the French Reformed theologian, [[John Calvin]]. John Calvin was heavily influenced by [[Augustine of Hippo]] views on predestination put forth in his work ''On the Predestination of the Saints.'' [[Martin Luther]] seems to hold views on predestination similar to Calvinism in his ''[[On the Bondage of the Will]],'' thus rejecting free will. In condemnation of Calvin and Luther views, the Council of Trent declared that "the free will of man, moved and excited by God, can by its consent co-operate with God, Who excites and invites its action; and that it can thereby dispose and prepare itself to obtain the grace of justification. The will can resist grace if it chooses. It is not like a lifeless thing, which remains purely passive. Weakened and diminished by Adam's fall, free will is yet not destroyed in the race (Sess. VI, cap. i and v)."

[[Paul the Apostle]] discusses Predestination in some of his Epistles.

"''For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the first-born among many brethren; and whom He predestined, these He also called; and whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.''” —[[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 8:29–30

“''He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will.''” —[[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 1:5

The exact meaning of these verses has been debated by Christian theologians throughout history.

=== Judaism ===
[[File:Flickr - USCapitol - Maimonides (1135-1204).jpg|thumb|right|[[Bas relief]] of Maimonides in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]].]]
[[Maimonides]] reasoned that human beings have free will (at least in the context of choosing to do good or evil).  Without free will, the demands of [[Nevi'im#Latter Prophets|the prophets]] would have been meaningless, there would be no need for the [[Torah]], and justice could not be administered.  In Maimonides's view, human free will is granted by God as part of the universe's design.&lt;ref&gt;Rambam Teshuvah 5:4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islam ===

In [[Islam]] the theological issue is not usually how to reconcile free will with God's foreknowledge, but with God's ''jabr'', or divine commanding power. [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari|al-Ash'ari]] developed an "acquisition" or "dual-agency" form of compatibilism, in which human free will and divine ''jabr'' were both asserted, and which became a cornerstone of the dominant [[Ash'ari]] position.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Montgomery Watt|Watt, Montgomery]]. Free-Will and Predestination in Early Islam. Luzac &amp; Co.: London 1948; [[Harry Austryn Wolfson|Wolfson, Harry]]. The Philosophy of Kalam, Harvard University Press 1976&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Shia]] Islam, Ash'aris understanding of a higher balance toward [[predestination]] is challenged by most theologians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/mananddestiny/3.htm |title=Man and His Destiny |publisher=Al-islam.org |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free will, according to Islamic doctrine is the main factor for man's accountability in his/her actions throughout life. Actions taken by people exercising free will are counted on the [[Day of Judgement]] because they are their own; however, the free will happens with the permission of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tosun|first=Ender|title=Guide to Understanding Islam|year=2012|location=Istanbul|isbn=978-605-631-981-5|url=http://www.islamicinformationcenter.info/understandingislam.pdf|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Others ===

The philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] claimed that divine omnipotence cannot be separated from divine goodness.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Timothy P. (1998) "Arminian edification: Kierkegaard on grace and free will" in ''Cambridge Companion to Kierkegaard'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; As a truly omnipotent and good being, God could create beings with true freedom over God. Furthermore, God would voluntarily do so because "the greatest good ... which can be done for a being, greater than anything else that one can do for it, is to be truly free."&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. (1848) ''Journals and Papers'', vol. III. Reprinted in Indiana University Press, Bloomington, 1967–78.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alvin Plantinga]]'s "[[Plantinga's free will defense|free will defense]]" is a contemporary expansion of this theme, adding how God, free will, and [[problem of evil|evil]] are consistent.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, J.L. (1955) "Evil and Omnipotence", ''Mind'', new series, vol. 64, pp. 200–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some philosophers follow [[William of Ockham]] in holding that necessity and possibility are defined with respect to a given point in time and a given matrix of empirical circumstances, and so something that is merely possible from the perspective of one observer may be necessary from the perspective of an omniscient.&lt;ref name="ockham"&gt;Ockham, William. Predestination, God's Knowledge, and Future Contingents, early 14th century, trans. Marilyn McCord Adams and [[Norman Kretzmann]] 1982, Hackett, esp pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers follow [[Philo of Alexandria]], a philosopher known for his [[homocentrism]], in holding that free will is a feature of a human's [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], and thus that non-human [[animal]]s lack free will.&lt;ref&gt;[[H. A. Wolfson]], ''Philo'', 1947 Harvard University Press; Religious Philosophy, 1961 Harvard University Press; and "St. Augustine and the Pelagian Controversy" in Religious Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of inquiry==
Henology stands in contradistinction to several other philosophical disciplines. The term "henology" refers to the discipline that centers around The One, as in the philosophies of [[Plato]] and [[Plotinus]]. It is sometimes used in contradistinction to disciplines that treat [[Being]] as its starting point (as in [[Aristotle]] and [[Avicenna]]) and also to those that seek to understand [[Knowledge]] and [[Truth]] (as in [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[René Descartes|Descartes]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wyller|first1=Egil A.|title=Henologische Perspektiven II: zu Ehren Egil A.

'''Idealistic pluralism''' is a philosophical position that suggests while an individual's understanding of the world might be limited to only the ideas within his or her mind, it can be known in this way by more than one mind.

Idealistic pluralism rejects the idea of [[solipsism]], which would be an [[idealistic monism]].  In the philosophy of [[George Berkeley]], an idealistic pluralism is found in his assertion that many minds (each knowing the world though their own representations) exist, separate from each other, and from God.

'''Incarnational humanism''' is a brand of [[humanism]] which affirms the value and essential goodness of human reason and [[human culture|culture]]. Developed in a [[Christian]] framework, incarnational humanism asserts a unification of the [[secular]] and the [[sacred]] with the goal of a common humanity. This unification is fully realized in the participatory nature of [[Christianity|Christian]] [[sacrament]]s, particularly the [[Eucharist]]. The recognition of this goal requires a necessary difference between the [[church (Christian)|church]] and the world, where both "spheres are unified in their service of humanity."

'''Inductionism''' is the [[Philosophy of science|scientific philosophy]] where laws are "[[induction (philosophy)|induced]]" from sets of data.  As an example, one might measure the strength of electrical forces at varying distances from charges and induce the [[inverse square law]] of [[electrostatics]].

}} (Definition)&lt;/ref&gt; Socially, “intellectualism” negatively connotes: single-mindedness of purpose (“too much attention to thinking”) and emotional coldness (“the absence of affection and feeling”).&lt;ref name="HighBeam" /&gt;&lt;ref name="encarta" /&gt;

==Ancient moral intellectualism==
In the view of [[Socrates]] (c. 470 – 399 BC), intellectualism allows that “one will do what is right or best just as soon as one truly understands what is right or best”; that [[virtue]] is a purely intellectual matter, since virtue and [[knowledge]] are familial relatives, which a person accrues and improves with dedication to [[reason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |df          = 
}} (Definition and note on Socrates)&lt;/ref&gt; So defined, [[Socratic intellectualism]] became a key philosophic doctrine of [[Stoicism]]. The apparent, problematic consequences of this view are “Socratic paradoxes”, such as the view that there is no [[weakness of will]] — that no one knowingly does, or seeks to do, evil (moral wrong); that anyone who does, or seeks to do, moral wrong does so involuntarily; and that virtue is knowledge, that there are not many virtues, but that all virtues are one.

Contemporary philosophers dispute that Socrates’s conceptions of knowing truth, and of ethical conduct, can be equated with modern, post–[[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] conceptions of knowledge and of rational intellectualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=No one errs willingly: the meaning of socratic intellectualism | author=Heda Segvic | url=http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-924226-7.pdf | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930151328/http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-924226-7.pdf | archivedate=2011-09-30 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, [[Michel Foucault]] demonstrated, with detailed historical study, that in [[Classical Antiquity]] (800 BC – AD 1000), “knowing the truth” is akin to “spiritual knowledge”, in the contemporarily understanding of the concept. Hence, without exclusively concerning the rational intellect, spiritual knowledge is integral to the broader principle of “caring for the self”.

Typically, such care of the self-involved specific [[ascetic]] exercises meant to ensure that not only was knowledge of truth memorized, but learned, and then integrated to the self, in the course of transforming oneself into a [[Value (ethics)|good]] person. Therefore, to understand truth meant “intellectual knowledge” requiring one’s integration to the (universal) truth, and [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authentically]] living it in one’s speech, heart, and conduct. Achieving that difficult task required continual care of the self, but also meant being someone who embodies truth, and so can readily practice the [[Rhetoric|Classical]]-era rhetorical device of [[parrhesia]]: “to speak candidly, and to ask forgiveness for so speaking”; and, by extension, practice the [[Morality|moral]] obligation to speak the truth for the common good, even at personal risk.&lt;ref&gt;Gros, Frederic (ed.)(2005) ''Michel Foucault: The Hermeneutics of the Subject'', Lectures at the College de France 1981–1982. Picador: New York&lt;/ref&gt; This ancient, Socratic moral philosophic perspective contradicts the contemporary understanding of truth and knowledge as [[Reason|rational]] undertakings.

==Medieval theological intellectualism&lt;!--'Medieval theological intellectualism' redirects here; linked from 'Averroes', 'Thomas Aquinas', and 'Meister Eckhart'--&gt;==
'''Medieval theological intellectualism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is a doctrine of divine action, wherein the faculty of [[intellect]] precedes, and is superior to, the faculty of the [[Will (philosophy)|will]] (''voluntas intellectum sequitur''). As such, Intellectualism is contrasted with [[Voluntarism (philosophy)|voluntarism]], which proposes the Will as superior to the intellect, and to the emotions; hence, the stance that “according to intellectualism, choices of the Will result from that which the intellect recognizes as good; the will, itself, is determined. For voluntarism, by contrast, it is the Will which identifies which objects are good, and the Will, itself, is indetermined”.&lt;ref name=IEP&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.iep.utm.edu/v/voluntar.htm | title = Voluntarism| publisher = Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; From that philosophical perspective and historical context, the Spanish [[Islam|Muslim]] polymath [[Averroës]] (1126–1198) in the 12th century, the Italian Christian theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274), and the German Christian theologian [[Meister Eckhart]] (1260–1327) in the 13th century, are recognised intellectualists.&lt;ref name=IEP/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah Hackett, ''A Companion to Meister Eckhart'', BRILL, 2012, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1106">'''League of peace''' ([[Latin]]: '''''foedus pacificum''''') is an expression coined by [[Immanuel Kant]] in his work "[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch]]". The league of peace should be distinguished from a [[peace treaty]] (''pactum pacis'') because a peace treaty prevents or terminates only one war, while the league of peace seeks to end all wars forever. This league does not hold any power of the state, but only exists for "the maintenance and security of the freedom of the state and of other states in league with it, without there being any need for them to submit to civil laws and their compulsion, as men in a state of nature must submit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/kant/kant1.htm|title=Immanuel Kant Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch 1795|accessdate=2007-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dualism-vs-Monism.png|thumb|right|350px|Different approaches toward resolving the mind–body problem]]

The '''mind–body problem''' is a philosophical problem concerning the relationship between thought and consciousness in the human mind and the brain as part of the physical body. It is distinct from the question of how mind and body function chemically and physiologically since that question presupposes an interactionist account of mind-body relations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/descmind/#H4|title=Rene Descartes: The Mind-Body Distinction|date=|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=|issn=2161-0002|quote=The real distinction of mind and body based on their completely diverse natures is the root of the famous mind-body problem: how can these two substances with completely different natures causally interact so as to give rise to a human being capable of having voluntary bodily motions and sensations?|last1=Skirry|first1=Justin|accessdate=20 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119144904/http://www.iep.utm.edu/descmind/#H4|archivedate=19 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This question arises when mind and body are considered as distinct, based on the premise that the mind and the body are fundamentally different in nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The problem was addressed by [[René Descartes]] in the 17th century, resulting in [[Cartesian dualism]], and by pre-[[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] philosophers,&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{cite book |editor1=RC Olby |editor2=GN Cantor |editor3=JR Christie |editor4=MJS Hodges |title=Companion to the History of Modern Science |publisher=Taylor and Francis |year=1996 |pages=702–11 |isbn=0415145783 |chapter=The mind–body problem |url=http://human-nature.com/rmyoung/papers/pap102h.html |author=Robert M.

A variety of approaches have been proposed. Most are either [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]] or [[Monism|monist]]. Dualism maintains a rigid distinction between the realms of mind and matter. [[Monism]] maintains that there is only one unifying reality, substance or essence in terms of which everything can be explained.

Each of these categories contain numerous variants. The two main forms of dualism are [[substance dualism]], which holds that the mind is formed of a distinct type of substance not governed by the laws of physics, and [[property dualism]], which holds that mental properties involving conscious experience are fundamental properties, alongside the fundamental properties identified by a completed physics. The three main forms of monism are [[physicalism]], which holds that the mind consists of matter organized in a particular way; [[idealism]], which holds that only thought truly exists and matter is merely an illusion; and [[neutral monism]], which holds that both mind and matter are aspects of a distinct essence that is itself identical to neither of them. [[Psychophysical parallelism]] is a third possible alternative regarding the relation between mind and body, between interaction (dualism) and one-sided action (monism).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Parallelism, Psychophysical |volume=20 |page=762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several philosophical perspectives have been developed which reject the mind–body dichotomy. The [[historical materialism]] of [[Karl Marx]] and subsequent writers, itself a form of physicalism, held that consciousness was engendered by the material contingencies of one's environment.&lt;ref&gt;K. Marx, A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1977, with some notes by R. Rojas.&lt;/ref&gt; An explicit rejection of the dichotomy is found in French [[structuralism]], and is a position that generally characterized post-war [[Continental philosophy]].&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;{{cite book |title=The Body and Society: Explorations in Social Theory |author=Bryan S.

The absence of an empirically identifiable meeting point between the non-physical mind (if there is such a thing) and its physical extension has proven problematic to dualism, and many modern philosophers of mind maintain that the mind is not something separate from the body.&lt;ref name="Kim1"&gt;{{cite book

An ancient model of the mind known as the Five-Aggregate Model explains the mind as continuously changing sense impressions and mental phenomena.&lt;ref name=Aggregates&gt;{{cite journal |author=Karunamuni N.D. |title=The Five-Aggregate Model of the Mind |journal=SAGE open |volume=5 |issue=2 |date=May 2015 |url=http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/spsgo/5/2/2158244015583860.full.pdf |doi=10.1177/2158244015583860 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921004343/http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/spsgo/5/2/2158244015583860.full.pdf |archivedate=2016-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering this model, it is possible to understand that it is the constantly changing sense impressions and mental phenomena (i.e., the mind) that experiences/analyzes all external phenomena in the world as well as all internal phenomena including the body anatomy, the nervous system as well as the organ brain. This conceptualization leads to two levels of analyses: (i) analyses conducted from a third-person perspective on how the brain works, and (ii) analyzing the moment-to-moment manifestation of an individual’s mind-stream (analyses conducted from a first-person perspective). Considering the latter, the manifestation of the mind-stream is described as happening in every person all the time, even in a scientist who analyses various phenomena in the world, including analyzing and hypothesizing about the organ brain.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt;

==Mind–body interaction and mental causation==
Philosophers David L. Robb and John F. Heil introduce mental causation in terms of the mind–body problem of interaction:
{{quote|Mind–body interaction has a central place in our pretheoretic conception of agency. Indeed, mental causation often figures explicitly in formulations of the mind–body problem. Some philosophers insist that the very notion of psychological explanation turns on the intelligibility of mental causation. If your mind and its states, such as your beliefs and desires, were causally isolated from your bodily behavior, then what goes on in your mind could not explain what you do. If psychological explanation goes, so do the closely related notions of agency and moral responsibility. Clearly, a good deal rides on a satisfactory solution to the problem of mental causation [and] there is more than one way in which puzzles about the mind's "causal relevance" to behavior (and to the physical world more generally) can arise.

[René Descartes] set the agenda for subsequent discussions of the mind–body relation. According to Descartes, minds and bodies are distinct kinds of "substance". Bodies, he held, are spatially extended substances, incapable of feeling or thought; minds, in contrast, are unextended, thinking, feeling substances. If minds and bodies are radically different kinds of substance, however, it is not easy to see how they "could" causally interact. [[Elisabeth of the Palatinate|Princess Elizabeth of Bohemia]] puts it forcefully to him in a 1643 letter:
&lt;blockquote&gt;how the human soul can determine the movement of the animal spirits in the body so as to perform voluntary acts—being as it is merely a conscious substance. For the determination of movement seems always to come about from the moving body's being propelled—to depend on the kind of impulse it gets from what sets it in motion, or again, on the nature and shape of this latter thing's surface. Now the first two conditions involve contact, and the third involves that the impelling thing has extension; but you utterly exclude extension from your notion of soul, and contact seems to me incompatible with a thing's being immaterial...&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Elizabeth is expressing the prevailing mechanistic view as to how causation of bodies works. Causal relations countenanced by contemporary physics can take several forms, not all of which are of the push–pull variety.&lt;ref name="sep-mental-causation"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=David |last=Robb |first2=John |last2=Heil |editor=Edward N.

Contemporary [[neurophilosopher]] Georg Northoff suggests that mental causation is compatible with classical formal and final causality.&lt;ref name=Northoff&gt;{{cite book |title=Philosophy of the Brain: The Brain Problem |author=Georg Northoff |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJq4QDixIg0C&amp;pg=PT148&amp;lpg=PT148 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |isbn=1588114171 |year=2004 |edition=Volume 52 of Advances in Consciousness Research |pages=137–139 |quote=The restriction of causality to 'efficient causality' lead to the neglect of 'goal-orientation' since it was no longer necessary within [that] framework. Not considering 'goal-orientation' resulted in the neglect of 'embedment' and the consequential presupposition of 'isolation' with separation between brain, body, and environment. Neglecting 'embedment' lead to the equation of perception/action with sensory impression/movement which could be well accounted for by 'efficient causality'. Accordingly, since dominated by 'efficient causality', qualia and intentionality, as related to perception/action rather than to sensory impression/movement, were excluded from science and consequently regarded [as] purely philosophical problems. Analogous to 'final causes', 'formal causes' were eliminated as well. 'Efficient causality' is not compatible with 'embedded coding' [which] is necessarily tied with 'formal causality' and 'final causality'... Finally, the possibility of mental causation remains incompatible with 'efficient causality'. It can, however, be properly described by 'formal and final causality'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologist, theoretical neuroscientist and philosopher, [[Walter Jackson Freeman III|Walter J. Freeman]], suggests that explaining mind–body interaction in terms of "circular causation" is more relevant than linear causation.&lt;ref name=Pockett&gt;{{cite book |title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |editor1=Susan Pockett |editor2=WP Banks |editor3=Shaun Gallagher |chapter=Consciousness, intentionality and causality |author=Walter J Freeman |publisher=MIT Press |year =2009 |isbn=0262512572 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5CaTnNksgkC&amp;pg=PA4 |pages=4–5, 88–90 |quote=Walter Freeman, with his usual originality, suggest that we may be looking at the whole thing in completely the wrong way when we ask whether consciousness causes or is caused by neural activity. He suggests that circular causation is a more relevant concept in this regard than linear causation. Consciousness and neural activity are certainly interdependent, but it is impossible in principle to say that either causes the other. Thus the whole concept of consciousness as agent is simply a misreading of the true situation.}} Through my readings in physics and philosophy, I learned the concept of circular causality, which invokes hierarchical interactions of immense numbers of semiautonomous elements such as neurons, which form nonlinear systems. These exchanges lead to the formation of macroscopic population dynamics that shapes the pattern of activity of the contributing individuals. Circular causality departs so strongly from the classical tenets of necessity, invariance, and precise temporal order that the only reason to call it that is to satisfy the human habitual need for causes. The most subtle shift is the disappearance of agency, which is equivalent to loss of Aristotle's efficient cause. The very strong appeal of agency to explain events may come from the subjective experience of cause and effect that develops early in human life, before the acquisition of language .the question I raise here is whether brains share this property with other material objects in the world. The answer I propose is that assignment of cause and effect to one's self and to others having self-awareness is entirely appropriate, but that investing insensate objects with causation is comparable to investing them with teleology and soul.
The further question is: Does it matter whether or not causality is assigned to objects? The answer is "Very much." Several examples are given of scientific errors attributed to thinking in terms of linear causality. The most important, with wide ramifications, is the assumption of universal determinacy, by which the causes of human behavior are limited to environmental and genetic factors, and the causal power of self-determination is excluded from scientific consideration.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[neuroscience]], much has been learned about correlations between brain activity and subjective, conscious experiences. Many suggest that neuroscience will ultimately explain consciousness:
"...consciousness is a biological process that will eventually be explained in terms of molecular signaling pathways used by interacting populations of nerve cells..."&lt;ref name=Kandel&gt;{{cite book |pages= 9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PFnRwWXzypgC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9 |author=Eric R.

{{quote|Cognitive science today gets increasingly interested in the embodiment of human perception, thinking, and action. Abstract information processing models are no longer accepted as satisfactory accounts of the human mind. Interest has shifted to interactions between the material human body and its surroundings and to the way in which such interactions shape the mind. Proponents of this approach have expressed the hope that it will ultimately dissolve the Cartesian divide between the immaterial mind and the material existence of human beings (Damasio, 1994; Gallagher, 2005). A topic that seems particularly promising for providing a bridge across the mind–body cleavage is the study of bodily actions, which are neither reflexive reactions to external stimuli nor indications of mental states, which have only arbitrary relationships to the motor features of the action (e.g., pressing a button for making a choice response). The shape, timing, and effects of such actions are inseparable from their meaning. One might say that they are loaded with mental content, which cannot be appreciated other than by studying their material features. Imitation, communicative gesturing, and tool use are examples of these kinds of actions.&lt;ref name="Goldenberg2008"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Morsella, E. |editor2=Bargh, J.A. |editor3=Gollwitzer, P.M. |first=Georg |last=Goldenberg |year=2008 |title=Oxford Handbook of Human Action |chapter=Chapter 7, How the Mind Moves the Body: Lessons From Apraxia |series=Social Cognition and Social Neuroscience |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=9780195309980 |lccn=2008004997 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFP1AZYlNmcC&amp;pg=PA136 |page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Georg Goldenberg|"How the Mind Moves the Body: Lessons From Apraxia" in ''Oxford Handbook of Human Action''}}

Beginning with the macromolecules of DNA and RNA, the author shows how, step-by-step, animal life moved from the simple ability to respond to frequently recurring environmental conditions to much more powerful ways of beating the odds, ways of using patterns of past experience to predict the future in never-before-encountered situations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To be conscious ''of'' something, the brain must be in a relatively high state of arousal (sometimes called ''vigilance''), whether awake or in [[REM sleep]]. Brain arousal level fluctuates in a [[circadian rhythm]] but these natural cycles may be influenced by lack of sleep, alcohol and other drugs, physical exertion, etc. Arousal can be measured behaviorally by the signal amplitude required to trigger a given reaction (for example, the sound level that causes a subject to turn and look toward the source). High arousal states involve conscious states that feature specific perceptual content, planning and recollection or even fantasy. Clinicians use scoring systems such as the [[Glasgow Coma Scale]] to assess the level of arousal in patients with ''impaired states of consciousness'' such as the [[coma|comatose state]], the [[persistent vegetative state]], and the [[minimally conscious state]]. Here, "state" refers to different amounts of externalized, physical consciousness: ranging from a total absence in coma, persistent vegetative state and [[general anesthesia]], to a fluctuating, minimally conscious state, such as sleep walking and [[epileptic]] seizure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Schiff |first=Nicholas D. |date=November 2004 |contribution=The neurology of impaired consciousness: Challenges for cognitive neuroscience. |editor-last=Gazzaniga |editor-first=Michael S. |editor-link=Michael Gazzaniga |edition=3rd |title=The Cognitive Neurosciences |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0-262-07254-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many nuclei with distinct chemical signatures in the [[thalamus]], [[midbrain]] and [[pons]] must function for a subject to be in a sufficient state of brain arousal to experience anything at all. These nuclei therefore belong to the enabling factors for consciousness. Conversely it is likely that the specific content of any particular conscious sensation is mediated by particular neurons in the cortex and their associated satellite structures, including the [[amygdala]], [[thalamus]], [[claustrum]] and the [[basal ganglia]].

==Historical background==
The following is a very brief account of some contributions to the mind–body problem.

===The Buddha===
{{See also|Gautama Buddha|Buddhism and the body|Pratītyasamutpāda}}

The Buddha (480–400 B.C.E), founder of [[Buddhism]], described the mind and the body as depending on each other in a way that two sheaves of reeds were to stand leaning against one another&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.067.than.html Nalakalapiyo Sutta: Sheaves of Reeds] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503051913/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.067.than.html |date=2016-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and taught that the world consists of mind and matter which work together, interdependently. Buddhist teachings describe the mind as manifesting from moment to moment, one thought moment at a time as a fast flowing stream.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt; The components that make up the mind are known as the five aggregates (i.e., material form, feelings, perception, volition, and sensory consciousness), which arise and pass away continuously. The arising and passing of these aggregates in the present moment is described as being influenced by five causal laws: biological laws, psychological laws, physical laws, volitional laws, and universal laws.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt; The Buddhist practice of [[mindfulness]] involves attending to this constantly changing mind-stream.

Ultimately, the Buddha's philosophy is that both mind and forms are conditionally arising qualities of an ever-changing universe in which, when [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvāna]] is attained, all phenomenal experience ceases to exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.045.than.html Rohitassa Sutta: To Rohitassa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512204617/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.045.than.html |date=2011-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[anatta|anattā]] doctrine of the Buddha, the conceptual self is a mere mental construct of an individual entity and is basically an impermanent illusion, sustained by form, sensation, perception, thought and consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/study/khandha.html The Five Aggregates: A Study Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020917193707/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/study/khandha.html |date=1899-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha argued that mentally clinging to any views will result in delusion and stress,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.002.than.html Sabbasava Sutta: All the Fermentations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625214552/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.002.than.html |date=1899-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; since, according to the Buddha, a real self (conceptual self, being the basis of standpoints and views) cannot be found when the mind has clarity.

===Plato===
{{See also|Plato|Theory of forms}}
[[Plato]] (429–347 B.C.E.) believed that the material world is a shadow of a higher reality that consists of concepts he called Forms. According to Plato, objects in our everyday world "participate in" these Forms, which confer identity and meaning to material objects. For example, a circle drawn in the sand would be a circle only because it participates in the concept of an ideal circle that exists somewhere in the world of Forms. He argued that, as the body is from the material world, the soul is from the world of Forms and is thus immortal. He believed the soul was temporarily united with the body and would only be separated at death, when it would return to the world of [[Theory of forms|Forms]]. Since the soul does not exist in time and space, as the body does, it can access universal truths. For Plato, ideas (or Forms) are the true reality, and are experienced by the soul. The body is for Plato empty in that it can not access the [[theory of forms|abstract reality]] of the world; it can only experience shadows. This is determined by Plato's essentially [[Rationalism|rationalistic]] [[epistemology]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Aristotle===
{{Main|Aristotle}}
For [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) ''mind'' is a faculty of the ''soul''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gendlin|2012b|page=121–122}}&lt;div align=left&gt;432a1-2&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=right&gt;'''Hence''' the soul is '''as''' the hand is; '''for&lt;br&gt;the hand is a tool of tools''', and&lt;br&gt;'''the nous is a form of forms'''&lt;br&gt;(ὥστε ἡ ψυχὴ ὥσπερ ἡ χείρ ἐστιν· καὶ γὰρ η χεὶρ ὄργανόν&lt;br&gt;ἐστιν ὀργάνων)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt; Aristotle now lets this aspect of nous and hand define a new term which he does not use anywhere else, so far as I know.  The hand is “a tool of tools.” The nous is a “form of forms.” The hand and the soul are unique in this respect.  Let us see further what this means.&lt;br&gt;
Aristotle seems to say that the nous is a form, but on closer inspection we find that it is not, or at least not the usual kind.  Nous is a maker of forms.  A “form of forms” is like a tool of tools, like a living body’s organ that makes tools. Nous is certainly not itself the sort of form that it makes.  The hand is not a made tool (it would have to be made by yet another hand).&lt;br&gt;'''In Greek “tool” and “organ” are the same word.  So we see: ”In the phrase “tool of tools” the first use of the word stands for a living organ, the second for an artificially made tool.''' In II-4 he says “all natural bodies are tools (organs) of the soul’s,” (both as food and as material from which to make tools).  In English we would say that the '''hand is the organ of tools.'''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hicks|1907|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/aristotledeanima005947mbp#page/n629/mode/2up p. 542]}}&lt;br&gt; '''431b230&amp;ndash;432a14.''' To sum up: the soul is in a manner the universe of things, which is made up of things sensible and things intelligible: and knowledge is in a manner identical with its object, the intelligible; sense with its object, the sensible. This statement calls for further explanation. Sense and knowledge, whether potential or actual, are distributed over things potential or actual, as the case may be. In the soul, again, the sensitive faculty and the cognitive faculty are potentially their respective objects. These objects must therefore exist in the soul, not indeed as concrete wholes, form and matter combined, which is impossible: it must be the ''forms'' of things which exist in the soul. Thus within the soul intellect is the form of forms, i.e. of intelligible forms, and sense the form of sensibles, precisely as in the body the hand is the instrument of instruments, i.e. the instrument by which other instruments are acquired.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the soul, he said:
{{quote|It is not necessary to ask whether soul and body are one, just as it is not necessary to ask whether the wax and its shape are one, nor generally whether the matter of each thing and that of which it is the matter are one. For even if one and being are spoken of in several ways, what is properly so spoken of is the actuality.| ''De Anima'' ii 1, 412b6–9|}}

In the end, Aristotle saw the relation between soul and body as uncomplicated, in the same way that it is uncomplicated that a cubical shape is a property of a toy building block. The soul is a property exhibited by the body, one among many. Moreover, Aristotle proposed that when the body perishes, so does the soul, just as the shape of a building block disappears with destruction of the block.&lt;ref name=Shields&gt;{{cite web |author=Shields, Christopher |title=Aristotle's Psychology |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2011 Edition)|editor=Edward N. Zalta |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2011/entries/aristotle-psychology/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences of Eastern monotheistic religions===
{{main|Dualistic cosmology|Gnosticism}}
In [[religious philosophy]] of Eastern monotheism, dualism denotes a [[binary opposition]] of an idea that contains two essential parts. The first formal concept of a "mind-body" split may be found in the ''"[[divinity]] - [[secularity]]"'' dualism of the ancient Persian religion of [[Zoroastrianism]] around the mid-fifth century BC. [[Gnosticism]] is a modern name for a variety of ancient dualistic ideas inspired by [[Judaism]] popular in the first and second century AD.  These ideas later seem to have been incorporated into  [[Galen]]'s ''"tripartite soul"''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/galen.html Researchgate:Galen and the tripartite soul] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531173126/http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/galen.html |date=2017-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that led into both the Christian sentiments &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/galen.html Early Christian writings:Galen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531173126/http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/galen.html |date=2017-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; expressed in the later [[Augustinian theodicy]] and [[Avicenna]]’s  [[Platonism in Islamic Philosophy]].

===Thomas Aquinas===
{{Main|Thomas Aquinas}}
Like [[Aristotle]], [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274) believed that the mind and the body are one, like the seal and the wax are one, and it is therefore pointless to ask whether they are one.  However, (referring to "mind" as "the soul") he asserted that the soul persists after the death of the body in spite of their unity, calling the soul "this particular thing".  Since his view was primarily theological rather than philosophical, it is impossible to fit it neatly within either the category of [[physicalist]] or [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McInerny |first1=Ralph |last2=O'Callaghan |first2=John |title=Saint Thomas Aquinas |journal=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=Summer 2018 |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2018/entries/aquinas/ |accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descartes===
{{Main|René Descartes}}
[[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) believed that mind exerted control over the brain ''via'' the [[pineal gland]]:
{{quote|My view is that this gland is the principal seat of the soul, and the place in which all our thoughts are formed.&lt;ref name=Lokhorst&gt;{{cite web |title=Descartes and the Pineal Gland |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/pineal-gland/ |author=Lokhorst, Gert-Jan |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |date=Nov 5, 2008}} Lokhorst quotes Descartes in his ''Treatise of Man''&lt;/ref&gt;|René Descartes|''Treatise of Man''}}{{quote|[The] mechanism of our body is so constructed that simply by this gland's being moved in any way by the soul or by any other cause, it drives the surrounding spirits towards the pores of the brain, which direct them through the nerves to the muscles; and in this way the gland makes the spirits move the limbs.&lt;ref name=Lokhorst1&gt;{{cite web |title=Descartes and the Pineal Gland |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/pineal-gland/ |author=Lokhorst, Gert-Jan |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |date=Nov 5, 2008}} Lokhorst quotes Descartes in his ''Passions of the Soul''&lt;/ref&gt;|René Descartes|''Passions of the Soul''}}

His posited relation between mind and body is called [[Cartesian dualism]] or [[substance dualism]]. He held that ''mind'' was distinct from ''matter'', but could influence matter. How such an interaction could be exerted remains a contentious issue.

===Kant===
{{Main|Immanuel Kant}}
For [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] (1724–1804) beyond ''mind'' and ''matter'' there exists a world of ''a priori'' forms, which are seen as necessary preconditions for understanding. Some of these forms, space and time being examples, today seem to be pre-programmed in the brain.
{{quote|...whatever it is that impinges on us from the mind-independent world does not come located in a spatial or a temporal matrix,...The mind has two pure forms of intuition built into it to allow it to... organize this 'manifold of raw intuition'.&lt;ref name=Brook&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Andrew Brook|Brook, Andrew]] |title=Kant's View of the Mind and Consciousness of Self|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2011 Edition)|editor=Edward N. Zalta (ed.)|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/kant-mind/ |date=October 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Andrew Brook]] |''Kant's view of the mind and consciousness of self: Transcendental aesthetic''}}
Kant views the mind–body interaction as taking place through forces that may be of different kinds for mind and body.&lt;ref name=Watkins&gt;{{cite book |author=Eric Watkins |page=108 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XIIsaGoHshoC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108 |chapter=Causality in context |title=Kant and the Metaphysics of Causality |isbn=0521543614 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Huxley===
{{Main|Thomas Huxley}}
For [[Thomas Huxley|Huxley]] (1825–1895) the conscious mind was a by-product of the brain that has no influence upon the brain, a so-called [[Epiphenomenalism|epiphenomenon]].
{{quote|On the epiphenomenalist view, mental events play no causal role. Huxley, who held the view, compared mental events to a steam whistle that contributes nothing to the work of a locomotive.&lt;ref name=Robinson2&gt;{{cite web |author=Robinson, William, |title=Epiphenomenalism |work= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2012 Edition)|editor=Edward N. Zalta|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2012/entries/epiphenomenalism/|date=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;|William Robinson|''Epiphenomenalism''}}

===Whitehead===
{{Main|Alfred North Whitehead}}
[[Alfred North Whitehead|A. N. Whitehead]] advocated a sophisticated form of [[panpsychism]] that has been called by [[David Ray Griffin]] ''[[Panpsychism#Panexperientialism|panexperientialism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Ronny Desmet and [[Michel Weber]] (edited by), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279940/Whitehead._The_Algebra_of_Metaphysics Whitehead. The Algebra of Metaphysics. Applied Process Metaphysics Summer Institute Memorandum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727230542/http://www.academia.edu/279940/Whitehead._The_Algebra_of_Metaphysics |date=2017-07-27 }}'', Louvain-la-Neuve, Éditions Chromatika, 2010 ({{ISBN|978-2-930517-08-7}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popper===
{{Main|Karl Popper}}
For [[Karl Popper|Popper]] (1902–1994) there are ''three'' aspects of the mind–body problem: the worlds of matter, mind, and of the creations of the mind, such as [[mathematics]]. In his view, the third-world creations of the mind could be interpreted by the second-world mind and used to affect the first-world of matter. An example might be [[radio]], an example of the interpretation of the third-world (Maxwell's [[electromagnetic theory]]) by the second-world mind to suggest modifications of the external first world.
{{quote|The body–mind problem is the question of whether and how our thought processes in World 2 are bound up with brain events in World 1. ...I would argue that the first and oldest of these attempted solutions is the only one that deserves to be taken seriously [namely]: World 2 and World 1 interact, so that when someone reads a book or listens to a lecture, brain events occur that ''act'' upon the World 2 of the reader's or listener's thoughts; and conversely, when a mathematician follows a proof, his World 2 ''acts'' upon his brain and thus upon World 1. This, then, is the thesis of body–mind interaction.&lt;ref name=Popper&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;|Karl Popper|''Notes of a realist on the body–mind problem''}}

===Searle===
{{Main|John Searle}}
For [[John Rogers Searle|Searle]] (b. 1932) the mind–body problem is a [[false dichotomy]]; that is, mind is a perfectly ordinary aspect of the brain.  
{{quote|According to Searle then, there is no more a mind–body problem than there is a macro–micro economics problem. They are different levels of description of the same set of phenomena. [...] But Searle is careful to maintain that the mental – the domain of qualitative experience and understanding – is autonomous and has no counterpart on the microlevel; any redescription of these macroscopic features amounts to a kind of evisceration, ...&lt;ref name=Searle&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28933">'''Modern Stoicism'''  is an intellectual and popular movement in the late 20th and early 21st century which attempts to revive the [[Stoicism|Stoic philosophy]] in the modern setting. It  is not to be confused with [[Neostoicism]], an analogous phenomenon in the 17th century. The term "Modern Stoicism" covers both the revival of interest in the Stoic philosophy and the philosophical efforts to adjust
Ancient Stoicism to the language and conceptual framework of the present.  'The rise of Modern Stoicism' has received attention in the international media since around November 2012 when the first Annual Stoic Week event was organized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Joe Gelonesi|title=The rise of Modern Stoicism|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/philosopherszone/modern-day-stoicism/5896364|accessdate=20 July 2017|work=ABC - Australian Broadcasting Corporation|agency=ABC - Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=November 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
=== Philosophically ===
Modern Stoicism has developed in the context of the 20th-century surge of interest in virtue ethics in general. "The [...] work by philosophers like [[Philippa Foot]], [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], and [[Martha Nussbaum]], among others, have brought back virtue ethics as a viable alternative to the dominant [[Kantian ethics|Kantian]]-[[Deontological ethics|deontological]] and [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]]-[[Consequentialism|consequentialist]] approaches."&lt;ref name=PigliucciIEP&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/stoicism/ |title=Stoicism |last=Pigliucci |first=Massimo|date=December 14, 2016 |website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Stoicism draws a lot from the late 20th and early 21st century spike in publications of scholarly works on ancient Stoics. Beyond that, “the Modern Stoicism movement traces its roots to the work of Dr Albert Ellis, who developed Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy,&lt;ref name=Ellis&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rebtnetwork.org/ |title=REBT Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Aaron T. Beck,&lt;ref name=Beck&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_T._Beck/ |title=Arron T Beck |website=Wiki}}&lt;/ref&gt;  who is regarded by many as the father to early versions of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. [[Viktor Frankl]] also found stoicism useful while he was imprisoned in a [[Nazi concentration camp]] during [[World War II]]; he later developed his theory known as [[logotherapy]]. &lt;ref name=PigliucciIEP/&gt;

One major premise of Modern Stoicism can be expressed as, in [[Lawrence C. Becker|Lawrence Becker]]'s words, "it is interesting to try to imagine what might have happened if Stoicism had had a continuous twenty-three-hundred-year history; if Stoics had had to confront Bacon and Descartes, Newton and Locke, Hobbes and Bentham, Hume and Kant, Darwin and Marx."&lt;ref name=Becker/&gt; Or, as Massimo Pigliucci puts it more concisely, "it is worth considering what it means to 'be a Stoic' in the 21st century."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/02/how-to-be-a-stoic/?_r=0|title=How To Be A Stoic?|last=Pigliucci|first=Massimo|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major modern work that spelled out the key premises of Modern Stoicism is, arguably, ''A New Stoicism''&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; by Lawrence Becker, first published in 1997.&lt;ref name="PigliucciIEP" /&gt; For other important books, see the notable books section below.

===Psychology and psychotherapy===
Stoic philosophy was the original philosophical inspiration for modern [[cognitive psychotherapy]], particularly as mediated by Dr Albert Ellis' Rational-Emotive Behaviour Therapy (REBT), the major precursor of [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|CBT]].  The original cognitive therapy treatment manual for depression by Aaron T. Beck et al. states, "The philosophical origins of cognitive therapy can be traced back to the Stoic philosophers".&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Rush, Shaw, &amp; Emery  (1979)  Cognitive Therapy of Depression, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  A well-known quotation from ''The Handbook'' of Epictetus was taught to most clients during the initial session of traditional REBT by Ellis and his followers: "It's not the events that upset us, but our judgments about the events."  This subsequently became a common element in the "socialization" phase of many other approaches to CBT. The question of Stoicism's influence on modern psychotherapy, particularly REBT and CBT, was described in detail in ''The Philosophy of Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy'' (2010) by Donald Robertson.&lt;ref name="Robertson_2010"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Robertson, D | title=The Philosophy of Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy: Stoicism as Rational and Cognitive Psychotherapy| year=2010| publisher=Karnac| location=London| isbn=978-1-85575-756-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XsOFyJaR5vEC&amp;lpg}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, several early 20th century psychotherapists were influenced by stoicism, most notably the "rational persuasion" school founded by the Swiss neurologist and psychotherapist [[Paul Charles Dubois|Paul DuBois]], who drew heavily on Stoicism in his clinical work and encouraged his clients to study passages from Seneca as homework assignments.

=== As a popular movement ===
It is characteristic of the Modern Stoicism movement that it is global and that it relies heavily on the social media and online communities. As E.O. Scott puts it "Modern Stoicism is really a “Web 2.0” phenomenon."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ericsiggyscott.wordpress.com/2016/11/30/a-quick-map-of-the-online-stoic-community/|title=A Quick Map of the Online Stoic Community|last=Scott|first=E.O.|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the key sites is the Modern Stoicism website, which harbors the Stoicism Today blog and hosts the Annual Stoic Week (online) and Stoicon (offline) events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2014/12/05/meet-real-stoics-taking-psychology-back-3rd-century-bc-287901.html|title=Meet the Real Stoics Taking Psychology Back to the 3rd Century BC|first=Timothy Willis On 12/1/14 at 7:33|last=AM|date=1 December 2014|website=Newsweek}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important place is the New Stoa, which was founded in May 1996 and is arguably the first lasting stoic community on the internet. Three key podcasts talking about Stoicism applied to modern thought are the ''Stoic Solutions Podcast'' hosted by Justin Vacula&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://justinvacula.com|title=Stoic Solutions Podcast - Practical Wisdom for Everyday Life|website=Stoic Solutions Podcast|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;, ''The Practical Stoic Podcast'' hosted by Simon Drew &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://practicalstoicpodcast.podbean.com|title=The Practical Stoic Podcast with Simon Drew|last=Development|first=PodBean|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Steve Karafit's ''The Sunday Stoic'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sundaystoic.wixsite.com/home|title=Home {{!}} Sunday Stoic|work=Home {{!}} Sunday Stoic|access-date=2018-05-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also a number of personal blogs exploring stoicism, some of them run by notable stoic scholars (e.g. Massimo Pigliucci, William Irvine or John Sellars) and some by therapists who explore stoic applications (e.g. Donald Robertson). In addition, articles on Stoicism have appeared on popular websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/stoicism-lessons-life-death-2017-6|title=7 insights from the ancient philosophy of Marcus Aurelius that will change the way you think about life, death, and time|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-02-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-shammas/want-happiness-become-a-p_b_3759317.html|title=Want Happiness?

According to E.O.Scott, "arguably the most important and influential gathering place for Modern Stoics [online]"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; is the "stoicism group" on Facebook of ~27 000 people (as of July 19, 2017). The analogous Reddit group has amassed ~96 400 users (as of June 11, 2018). Beyond the Anglophone there is the “Sztuka życia według stoików” site run by Piotr Stankiewicz, "Stoicyzm Uliczny" run by Marcin Fabjański and Centrum Praktyki Stoickiej run by Tomasz Mazur and others.

Applications of Modern Stoicism are reported across industries. According to "Forbes," Modern Stoic thought "hold[s] fascinating promise for business and government leaders tackling global problems in a turbulent, post-recession slump."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/carriesheffield/2013/12/01/want-an-unconquerable-mind-try-stoic-philosophy/#7b97cceb750c|title=Want an Unconquerable Mind? Try Stoic Philosophy|last=Sheffield|first=Carrie|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, two Stoic academics, Kai Whiting and Leonidas Konstantakos, have warned against using "life-hack Stoicism" or "Silicon Valley Stoicism", as the primary means of understanding Stoic philosophy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2018/04/17/life-hack-stoicism-is-it-worth-it/|title=Life-Hack Stoicism—Is It Worth It?|last=Whiting|first=Kai|date=2018-04-17|work=The Partially Examined Life Philosophy Podcast|access-date=2018-04-26|last2=Konstantakos|first2=Leonidas|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Subsequently, they discussed on a popular Stoic blog, Stoicism's role in advocating for change in society, including when it comes to standing against gender-based discrimination in the workplace &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dailystoic.com/stoicism-beyond-the-self/|title=Taking Stoicism Beyond the Self: The Power To Change Society|last=Whiting|first=Kai|last2=Konstankos|first2=Leonidas|date=5 May 2018|website=The Daily Stoic|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Similarities of Modern Stoicism and Third Wave [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|CBT]] have been suggested as well, and its potency in treating depression has been studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/wellbeing/10146546/Anxious-Depressed-Try-Greek-philosophy.html|title=Anxious?

== Key concepts ==
=== Problems with the appeal to nature ===
Presumably, the single most difficult challenge that Modern Stoicism faces is its relationship to the core principle of Ancient Stoicism, that is to the principle of “following nature.” In a word, the Ancient Stoics put forward it was unquestionable that in order to live a good life, one needed to live consistently with nature. According to the Ancient Stoics, nature was by definition good and everything which was conformable to nature was deemed good. Moreover, the Ancient Stoics had a teleological outlook on the world, that is, they held that everything in the universe was purposefully and rationally organized to a good end.

However, this view is much more difficult to uphold in the present day. As Becker puts it, “science presented significant challenges to our [Stoic] metaphysical views.”&lt;ref name="Becker"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A New Stoicism|last=Becker|first=Lawrence|publisher=Princetion University Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} The notion of the rational organization of the world seems much more doubtful in the 21st century than it, presumably, was two millennia ago. “When we face the universe,” Becker writes, “we confront its indifference to us and our own insignificance to it. It takes no apparent notice of us, has no role other than Extra for us to play, no aim for us to follow.”&lt;ref name=Becker/&gt;{{rp|11}} Even more pressing questions are raised when we face our own human realm, with the long and still expanding record of genocide and atrocity and the manslaughter that followed. These are major challenges for the ancient Stoic view of the world as a rational and essentially good being.

We happen upon an analogous problem if we narrow down our interest to human nature (as contrasted to the nature of the universe as a whole). In other words, the idea of “following our human nature” also raises serious questions. As Becker describes it, “it is ‘natural’ to find these [defining] traits in human character and conduct, but it is equally natural to find a significant number of exceptions. As a result, none of these characteristics fits into the most familiar forms of ethical argument from human nature, e.g. (a) that humans are by nature X, and that Y is contrary to X, hence, that Y is contrary to human nature; or (b) that X is what defines the unique function (the essence) of a human being, thus to flourish as a human being is to excel at X."&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; In this vein, “following human nature” yields no specific guidelines for conduct either. All told, this is one of the central problems for Modern Stoicism: that in the 21st century it is far more difficult to ground our ethical framework in “nature,” be it universal, cosmic nature, or to special human nature.

=== Following nature as following the facts ===
Becker acknowledges this problem and even goes to the point of asserting that “stoic ethics would be much better off without its ‘follow nature’ slogan."&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; Yet, he reflects that the stoics are, “however, too deeply branded with it to renounce it now. The best we can do is reinterpret it.”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt;

The reinterpretation he proposes is this. “Following nature means following the facts. It means getting the facts about the physical and social world we inhabit, and the facts about our situation in it [...] before we deliberate about normative matters. It means facing those facts - accepting them for exactly what they are, no more and no less - before we draw normative conclusions from them. It means doing ethics from the facts constructing normative propositions a posteriori. It means adjusting those normative propositions to fit changes in the facts, and accepting those adjustments for exactly what they are, no more and no less. And it means living within the facts - within the realm of actual rather than hypothetical norm.”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt;

This process of “getting the facts about the [...] world”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; happens in some measure (but not exclusively) through science. In Becker’s words, “The biological, behavioral, and social sciences contribute to ethics in three important ways: they offer a wealth of material that can be used in the naturalistic arguments [...], they offer explanatory theories (e.g. from evolutionary biology) that help separate relatively fixed traits from transient or malleable ones and they offer powerful, elaborate analyses of learning, rationality, and rational choice."&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; Ethical reasoning of a stoic “cannot begin until all relevant description, representation, and prediction are in hand, [...] – until, let us say, the empirical work is done.”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; This empirical work may be obtained by the scientific method and thus the principle of “following facts” can be (in some contexts) read as “not contradicting science” (not to be confused with simple “following science,” which would be reductive and misleading).

=== Virtue, agency, happiness ===
Becker organizes his reading of stoic ethics around the concept of agency. “The Development of Virtue [happens through] the Perfection of Agency,”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; or through the “ideal agency”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; as he calls it. In other words, this can be described as the belief in the “inherent primacy of virtue in terms of maximization of one’s agency.”&lt;ref name=PigliucciIEP/&gt; This agency is understood in terms of “a balance of control and stability”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; and is executed all-things-considered, i.e. upon having obtained the most detailed information about the facts as available.

Happiness, in this view, is also explained and achieved through agency. “We hold,” this is Becker again, “that happiness as understood by mature and fit agents is a property of whole lives, not of transient mental states. We hold that it is achievable only through a proper balance of stability and control in the exercise of agency.”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; And, “this sort of happiness with one’s life also appears to be a psychological consequence of healthy agency [...] The life of a stoic sage is filled with such happiness, as a consequence of virtue."&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt;

=== Degrees of virtue ===
In Becker’s version of Stoicism, several dogmas of Ancients Stoics are questioned or challenged. For example, the traditional stoic all-or-nothing understanding of virtue is questioned (to some extent). In the original, Orthodox Stoicism one was either a perfect sage or no sage at all, there was no “middle ground,” or “in between.” The Ancient Stoic virtue admits of no degrees. And yet, Becker lays ground for a softer, more nuanced approach. “You can drown,” he writes, “face down on the calm surface of the sea as surely as at the bottom. [...] We [i.e. the Modern Stoics] follow later colleagues in thinking that these doctrines are untenable.”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt;

=== Aspirations for universality ===
Another dogma of the Ancient Stoics that is sometimes questioned in Modern Stoicism is the idea that the gateways of stoic philosophy are open to everyone and that living a stoic life is definitely the best option for every human being. E.g. in Becker’s ''New Stoicism'' suggests that “acting appropriately, as understood here, is a special kind of optimization project – one that it is logically possible to reject. (Which people with compulsive, obsessive, or addictive personalities may in fact reject.) [Modern Stoic] claim is, only healthy agents, at least those well along the road to fitness in their deliberative powers, cannot plausibly reject it.”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt;

=== Stoicism versus Aristotle ===
Another example of possible discrepancies between the Modern Stoic approach and Ancient Stoicism is the question of whether a certain amount of external goods is required for a good life. In the Orthodox Stoic view there are absolutely no entry conditions to living a stoic life. One can become a sage no matter the circumstances: be it poverty, illness, physical adversity and so on. This issue has been traditionally the bone of contention between the stoics (who held the mentioned position) and the followers of Aristotle (who held that a certain amount of external goods is necessary for development of virtue). In this context, Becker’s words are quite non-orthodox coming from the stoic position. He writes that  “it is [...] plausible to conclude, however, that there is an identifiable kernel of bodily and psychological health that is a necessary condition of all further development. If this kernel is damaged, so is the capacity to develop agency.”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt;

=== Dichotomy of control ===
A very important concept of Traditional Stoicism is the distinction between things within one’s power and not within our power. While this concept is embraced fully by many Modern Stoics, some reinterpret it. Becker, for instance, points out that the whole idea of the dichotomy is in fact a major oversimplification. As he puts it, “[the] distinction between things that are within our control, or ‘up to us,’ and those who are not [...] [is] misleading.”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; Instead, he proposes to read it along the lines of “it is wise to calibrate the strength, depth, and dissemination of our attachments to the fragility and transience of the objects involved.”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt;

On the other hand, William Irvine goes even further and undermines the central premise of the dichotomy, i.e. that the distinction between things “in our power” and “not in our power” is sharp and that there is no third option. In other words, Irvine suggests the possibility of turning the “dichotomy of control” into a “trichotomy of control.” Irvine argues “We can restate Epictetus’s dichotomy as follows: There are things over which we have complete control and things over which we have no control at all. As well as suggesting "the dichotomy is a false dichotomy, since it ignores the existence of things over which we have some but not complete control.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Guide to the Good Life. The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy|last=Irvine|first=William|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pigliucci describes it as follows: “some things are up to us (chiefly, our judgments and actions), some things are not up to us (major historical events, natural phenomena), but on a number of other things we have partial control. Irvine recasts the third category in terms of internalized goals, which makes more sense of the original dichotomy.”&lt;ref name=PigliucciIEP/&gt;

=== The question of ascesis and renunciation ===
There is also no unity in evaluating the ascetic elements in stoicism and in defining the sage’s attitude towards the ordinary pleasures of life. Becker mentions “the confusion, both among stoics and their critics” and the “false notion that the stoic ideal is a life devoid of the ordinary pleasures of sex, food, drink, music, wealth, fame, friends, and so on”&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; (according to Becker this confusion happens because “stoics have occasionally claimed that, for the sage, ''eudaiomonia'' somehow replaces ordinary happiness”.&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; In this vein, Stankiewicz argued against the “ascetic misinterpretation,” saying that “stoicism is not asceticism and a stoic is not a monk. In fact, it is the school of The Pale Epicureans that is closer to the ideal of abstemiousness. The stoic proposal is far broader and it extends far beyond the narrow passage of the ascetic way.”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stoicism Today: Selected Writings vol. II|last=Ussher [ed.]|first=Patrick|publisher=Stoicism Today|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, “we [the Modern Stoics] must face the lushness, diversity and – yes! – sensuality of life and we have to live and thrive inside this world, accepting it as it is. Unlike a monk, a stoic doesn’t dodge the myriad of different aspects of the earthly and sensual life.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

On the other hand, Kevin Patrick refutes this argument, ridiculing it as “hedonic stoicism” and saying that the mentioned position “falls into the more common trap and misinterpretation, that since externals are indifferent to us, we should go ahead and indulge in all of those things for which we have a proclivity.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; “Modern Stoics,” he concludes, “ought to be stoics.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Irvine takes a more modest stance and he proposes a program of “voluntary discomfort.” As he describes it: “By undertaking acts of voluntary discomfort – by, for example, choosing to be cold and hungry when we could be warm and well fed – we harden ourselves against misfortunes that might befell us in the future. If all we know is comfort, we might be traumatized when we are forced to experience pain or discomfort, as we someday almost surely will. In other words, voluntary discomfort can be thought of as a kind of vaccine: By exposing ourselves to a small amount of a weakened virus now, we create in ourselves an immunity that will protect us from a debilitating illness in the future.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''Oxford Franciscan school''' was the name given to a group of [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] philosophers that, in the context of the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]], gave special contribution to the development of [[science]] and [[scientific method]]ology during the [[High Middle Ages]]. This group includes such names as [[Robert Grosseteste]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Duns Scotus]] and [[William of Ockham]] as well as [[Thomas of York (Franciscan)|Thomas of York]], [[John Peckham]], and [[Richard of Middleton]].

[[Robert Grosseteste]], was the founder of the [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] [[Franciscan]] school. He was the first scholastic philosophers to fully understand [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] vision of the dual path of [[scientific reasoning]]. Concluding from particular observations into a universal law, and then back again: from universal laws to prediction of particulars. Grosseteste called this "resolution and composition". Further, Grosseteste said that both paths should be verified through experimentation in order to verify the principles. These ideas established a tradition that carried forward to [[Padua]] and [[Galileo Galilei]] in the 17th century.

Under the tuition of Grosseteste and inspired by the writings of [[Arab]] [[alchemy|alchemists]] who had preserved and built upon [[Aristotle]]'s portrait of [[Induction (philosophy)|induction]], Bacon described a repeating cycle of ''observation'', ''hypothesis'', ''experimentation'', and the need for independent ''verification''. He recorded the manner in which he conducted his experiments in precise detail so that others could reproduce and independently test his results — a cornerstone of the [[scientific method]], and a continuation of the work of researchers like [[Al Battani|Albatenius]].

'''Philosophy of Architecture''' is a branch of [[philosophy of art]], dealing with aesthetic value of [[architecture]], its [[semantics]] and relations with development of [[culture]].

==History ==

=== Early history ===

[[Plato]], whose influence on architecture is widely documented (e.g., 'idealism', 'neo-Platonic' architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hendrix | first=John Shannon | authorlink=John Shannon Hendrix | date=1999 | title=Neoplatonic Philosophy and Roman Baroque Architecture | journal=The European Studies Journal | publisher=University of Northern Iowa | volume=16 | issue=1 |pages=31–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;), may be counted as part of a classical geometric model of cosmology, the popularity of which could be attributed to earlier thinkers such as [[Pythagoras]]. In early history, philosophers distinguished architecture ('technion') from building ('demiorgos'), attributing the former to mental traits, and the latter to the divine or natural. It was only with Socratic irony that the name craftsman could become representative of a religious deity. The presence of some degree of formalism ala Platonism continues to be an important trait in distinguishing one architectural style from another, and thus in distinguishing the philosophy of a style.

Due to the nature of critique, the philosophy of architecture is an outgrowth of the [[philosophy of art]], which began to be expressed in books on architecture and history of architecture during the latter half of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Harries p. 29"&gt;{{ cite journal | author=Harries K. | title= Philosophy and the Task of Architecture | journal=Journal of Architectural Education | volume=40 | issue=2 | date=Winter 1987 | pages=29 | doi=10.2307/1424928}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that, largely because of its reliance on technology and engineering, architecture was seen as incompatible, or beneath, the proper subject areas of classical aesthetics as delimited by, notably, [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]], with their ideal of "pure art."&lt;ref name="Harries p. 29" /&gt;

=== Modern period ===

[[File:Panopticon.jpg|thumb | Panopticon. Drawing by [[Jeremy Bentham]] in 1791.]]
As it was noted by [[Michel Foucault]], the architecture is able to set the life of society, and therefore it is particularly important for understanding of the person's values and culture. In "[[Discipline and Punish]]" Foucault analized contemporary culture through architecture project of principally new prison [[Panopticon]]. The point of this project by [[Jeremy Bentham]] was to create a special transparent environment for prisoners, where everyone would be under constant surveillance. Although the project was not realized, Bentham's thought deeply influenced ideology of prisons, changing social practices of punishment. Simultaneously with its main conclusions Foucault reached other goal - his instrumental use of architecture in cultural studies showed the potential of this philosophical theme.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

However, philosophy of architecture as a full-fledged part of the Philosophy of Art, would not have been possible without the [[Avant-garde]]`s shift of the aesthetic paradigm. Art, set in the conditions of [[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction|mechanical reproduction of the image]], was forced to look for new ways. Around the same time architectural styles of [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivism]] and [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]] find way to justify new, totally engineering aesthetics. Side of the architecture, which had been considered a shame (as a sign of its connection with the pragmatic needs of man and society), became a major advantage, central part of new system of aesthetic values. [[Cubism]] and [[Futurism]] set aesthetic, full of mechanized, slaughtered, brutal forms, what was very close to the same engineering ideal. All this created more than favorable environment to change status of architecture in our system of art, as well as our understanding of art by itself.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

=== Postmodernism ===
[[File:Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village crop.jpg| thumb | 450pks | Photography "[[Stuyvesant Town - Peter Cooper Village]]," according to Martin R.&lt;ref name="Martin R."&gt;Martin R. "Architecture's Image Problem. Have We Ever Been Postmodern." ''Grey Room,'' No. 22 (Winter, 2006), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; it is an architectural work, which may serve as one of the first manifestations of postmodernism]]
Architecture assumed much more significant role after establishing of the phenomenon of [[Postmodernism]]. According to R. Martin "it remains surprising how many influential accounts of cultural postmodernism make reference to architecture."&lt;ref name="Martin R." /&gt;
Some scholars go so far as to claim that the entire post-modernism comes from the practice of architecture, and the rejection of "[[Art Nouveau|style of Modern]]" as an architectural style, and by so architects terminologically formulated postmodernism. Thus, F. Jameson writes that "it is in the realm of architecture, however, that modifications in aesthetic production are most dramatically visible, and that their theoretical problems have been most centrally raised and articulated (...) it was indeed from architectural debates that my own conception of post-modernism (...) initially began to emerge."&lt;ref&gt;Jameson F. Postmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism. 2003. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; As it was noted by researchers, "Barthes and Eco, taking their cue from Russian Formalism, see norm breaking as the mark of the aesthetic (sc., the aesthetic code). Art is characteristically inventive in its capacity to have signs do duty as signifier of further meanings in a potentially endless play upon convention as well as within it or on its margin."&lt;ref name="Donougho M 1987 p. 65"&gt;Donougho M. The Language of Architecture // Journal of Aesthetic Education, Vol. 21, No. 3 (Autumn, 1987), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; So important to postmodern writers like [[Barthes, Roland|R. Bart]] and [[Eco, Umberto|U. Eco]], saw architecture as a source of revolutionary innovations in art.&lt;ref name="Donougho M 1987 p. 65"/&gt;
[[File:The Luxor From Airport.jpg| thumb | 450pks | Photo of casino "Luxor", an example of architecture of "Las Vegas", which formed the basis for post-modernist manifesto of [[Robert Venturi]] and has played a key role in the development of post-modernism according to F. Jameson]]F. Jameson believes that there is a special relationship between postmodernism and American architecture, in which the birth of a national architecture coincided, in his opinion, with the emergence of the terminology or even the reality of postmodernism.&lt;ref&gt;Jameson F. Postmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism. 2003. p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all researchers agree with his post-modern "architectural origins," so [[Andreas Huyssen]], suggests that the conceptual frame of postmodernism has been defined within certain movements of literature. However, this researcher also notes the special role of architecture in the development of post-modernism. Martin describes, that "Huyssen credits architecture with helping to disseminate the term postmodernism, originally from literature, into the expanded aesthetic sphere during the 1970s."&lt;ref name="Martin R." /&gt; [[Jean-François Lyotard|Lyotard]] contends that postmodern architects have nothing in common with true Postmodernism &lt;ref name="Martin R." /&gt; and, as Lyotard states it in his article, ''Answering the Question: What Is Postmodernism?'': "under the name of postmodernism, architects are getting rid of the Bauhaus project, throwing out the baby of experimentation with the bathwater of functionalism."&lt;ref&gt;Lyotard J.-F. Answering the Question: What Is Postmodernism? // Lyotard J.-F. The Posmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge. 1984. p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

A special figure for the philosophy of architecture can be considered the architect [[Robert Venturi]], whose books may have played a no lesser role in the development of [[postmodernism]], than his stylistic experiments in architecture. R. Venturi first lead attention of architects to [[pop-art]]. In his rejection of architectural modernism Venturi  gave rise to the new cultural setting. By this Venturi showed a deep connection between civilization and architectural forms.&lt;ref&gt;Martin R. Architecture's Image Problem. Have We Ever Been Postmodern // Grey Room, No. 22 (Winter, 2006), pp. 9-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wittgenstein and philosophy of architecture ==
[[File:Wittgenstein haus.jpg|thumb|300px|A photo of Wittgenstein House]]
The [[Wittgenstein House]] is considered one of the most important examples of interactions between philosophy and architecture. Built by renowned [[Austria]]n philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], the house has been the subject of extensive research about the relationship between its stylistic features, Wittgenstein's personality, and his philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Himmelfarb G.

The '''philosophy of copyright''' considers philosophical issues linked to [[copyright]] [[policy]], and other [[jurisprudence|jurisprudential]] problems that arise in legal systems' interpretation and application of copyright law.

One debate concerns the purpose of copyright.  Some take the approach of looking for coherent ''justifications'' of established copyright systems, while others start with general ethical theories, such as [[utilitarianism]] and try to analyse policy through that lens.  Another approach denies the meaningfulness of any ethical justification for existing copyright law, viewing it simply as a result (and perhaps an undesirable result) of political processes.

Another widely debated issue is the relationship between [[copyrights]] and other forms of "[[intellectual property]]", and material property.  Most scholars of copyright agree that it can be called a kind of [[property]], because it involves the [[exclusive right|exclusion]] of others from something.  But there is disagreement about the extent to which that fact should allow the transportation of other beliefs and intuitions about material possessions.

There are many other [[philosophy|philosophical]] questions which arise in the jurisprudence of copyright.  They include such problems as determining when one work is "derived" from another, or deciding when information has been placed in a "tangible" or "material" form.

==Justifications for copyright==

Legal scholars often approach copyright in search of a coherent ethical justification for its existence and character.  This approach may seem to be backwards—it might make more sense to start with an objective and then examine the law against it—but it is widely practised.  Thus, the [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] or ethical theories that might naively be regarded as tests for copyright law to pass are often called "justifications" of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vaver|first=David|title=Intellectual Property Law: Copyright, Patents, Trade-Marks|year=2011|publisher=Irwin Law|location=Toronto|isbn=978-1-55221-007-9|pages=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justifications for copyright can generally be approximated into two groups: deontological or consequentialist. Deontological justifications for copyright seek to justify copyright as a matter of rights or duty; they seek to assert a justification for copyright (or intellectual property more generally) on the basis that it is morally correct to do so. Contrariwise, consequentialist theories of copyright seek to justify or criticise copyright protection based on the consequences of that protection, by asserting or providing evidence that the protection of copyright produces some desirable effect. Examples of such theories include incentives theories that view intellectual property as a necessary way of incentivising the creation of new creative works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dutfield|first=Graham|last2=Suthersanen|first2=Uma|title=Global intellectual property law|year=2008|publisher=Edward Elgar|location=Cheltenham, UK|isbn=978-1-84720-364-9|pages=51–52, 75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural rights===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
[[Natural rights]] are linked to the logic{{clarify|date=June 2013}} of [[property]]. [[John Locke]] is often cited as an authority, although it is not clear that Locke actually viewed copyright as a natural right.{{clarify|date=June 2013}} {{citation needed span|text=[[Personality rights]] are the basis of German copyright law.This position regards copyrightable works to be extensions of the author's personality. The author is given certain powers to control those works on account of his or her connection to them.|date=June 2013}}

===Morality===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2013}}
Proponents of copyright and patent laws believe that morality supports their stance.

=== Economics ===
{{Disputed section|date=June 2013}}
Many economists{{who|date=June 2013}} believe that, {{citation needed span|text=in the absence of intellectual property protections such as [[copyright]] and [[patents]], various types of intangible assets would be under-produced{{according to whom|date=June 2013}}, because there would be [[free-rider problem|insufficient incentives]] for commercial organisations to produce them.|date=June 2013}}  From this perspective, the objective of [[copyright law]] is primarily to balance the public benefits{{how|date=June 2013}} that can arise from the widespread circulation, use and reuse of a copyright work with the need to provide protection, incentive and reward to the creator or owner of the copyright by granting a limited{{clarify|date=June 2013}} [[monopoly]] to exploit the copyright to that body or individual.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Lilley (July 2006) Inside the Creative Industries - Copyright on the ground, [[ippr]],[http://www.ippr.org.uk/publicationsandreports/publication.asp?id=483] {{Unreliable source?|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2013}}

===Consequentialist theories===
Consequentialist theories of copyright hold that we should have the laws that will produce the 'best' results for society.  The most common consequentialist position is [[utilitarianism]], which defines the 'best' situations to be those in which people are in total as happy or fulfilled as possible.  Economists' analyses of copyright tend to follow this philosophical approach.

A related class of theories is called [[instrumentalism]]; it holds that copyright law must exist for clear, coherent and necessary purposes, without being so strict as to require that it maximise some kind of 'goodness' in its outcome.

Some copyright scholars believe that, regardless of contemporary advances in technology, copyright remains the fundamental way by which authors, sculptors, artists, musicians and others can fund the creation of new works, and that without a significant period of legal protection of their future income, many valuable books and artworks would not be created.&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt; They argue that the public interest is best served by repeated extension of copyright terms to encompass multiple generations beyond the copyright holder's life, as this increases the present value of the copyright, encouraging the creation for new works and making additional investments in older works (for example, the restoration of old movies) economically viable.&lt;ref name=Scott&gt;{{cite journal| author = Scott M. Martin | date = September 24, 2002 | title = The Mythology of the Public Domain: Exploring the Myths Behind Attacks on the Duration of Copyright Protection | journal = Loyola of Los Angeles Law Review | volume = 36| issue = 1| page = 280| publisher = Loyola Law Review| issn = 1533-5860 | url = http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2343&amp;context=llr| format = PDF| accessdate = 2007-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Authors' heirs continue to profit if copyrights are enforced post-death and this provides a substantial incentive for continued  fresh work even as authors age.&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt;

The modern, market-driven copyright system provides authors with independent financing (through royalties). Without a feasible way to recoup investments of creative time through copyright, there would be little economic incentive to produce and works would need to be motivated by a desire for fame from already affluent authors or those able to obtain patronage (with associated constraints on independence). Proponents of copyright dispute that copyright erodes precepts for creators to be able to build on published expression pointing to concepts such as [[Scènes à faire]] and [[Idea-expression divide]]. Copyright only protects the artist's expression of his/her work and not the ideas, systems, or factual information conveyed in it&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vaver|first=David|title=Intellectual Property Law: Copyright, Patents, Trade-Marks|year=2011|publisher=Irwin Law|location=Toronto|isbn=978-1-55221-007-9|pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus artists are free to get ideas from copyrighted works.&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt;

Defenders of the present system of strong copyrights argue that it has been largely successful in financing the creation and distribution of a wide variety of works, especially those requiring significant labor and capital. Moderate scholars seem to support that view while recognizing the need for exceptions and limitations, such as the [[fair use]] doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vaver|first=David|title=Intellectual Property Law: Copyright, Patents, Trade-Marks|year=2011|publisher=Irwin Law|location=Toronto|isbn=978-1-55221-007-9|page=673}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, a substantial portion of the current U.S. Copyright Act (sections 107–120) is devoted to such exceptions and limitations.

====Consequentialism in the United States====

[[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]] of the [[United States Constitution]] authorizes [[United States Congress|Congress]] to "''promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries''".

Many authors thought that this wording would actually require U.S. copyright laws to serve the purpose of "promoting the progress of science and useful arts". {{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In the US in 2003 controversial changes implemented by the [[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act]] extending the length of copyright under [[U.S. copyright law]] by 20 years were challenged in the [[United States Supreme Court]]. However, the Court, in the case called [[Eldred v. Ashcroft]], held, ''inter alia'', that in placing existing and future copyrights in parity in the CTEA, Congress acted within its authority and did not transgress constitutional limitations. Other jurisdictions have enacted legislation to provide for similar extensions of the copyright term.

== Opposition to copyright ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Copyright]] --&gt;
{{main article|Anti-copyright}}
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2008}}
[[File:Pro piracy demonstration.jpg|thumb|Anti-copyright demonstration in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], 2006.]]
Critics of copyright as a whole fall broadly into two categories: Those who assert that the very concept of copyright has never benefited society, and has always served simply to enrich a few at the expense of creativity; and those who assert that the existing copyright regime must be reformed to maintain its relevance in the new [[Information society]]. The [[French copyright law|French ''droit d'auteur'']] ("Rights of the Author"), which influenced the 1886 [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]], must also be noted as a significant alternative to the usual Anglo-Saxon concept of copyright.

Among the latter group, there are also some who continue to agree with copyright as a way to grant authors rights, but feel that it "outlives its welcome" by granting copyright for too long (e.g., far beyond the lifetime of the author), and is therefore of little direct benefit to him or her.  The prolongation of copyright term is commonly attributed to effective corporate [[lobbying]], based on a desire for the continuance of a profitable monopoly. In the US, this is often phrased as a conspiracy to 'control the Mouse' (meaning [[Mickey Mouse]], a [[trademark]]ed character controlled by the Disney Company whose early works would have moved into the public domain save for such an extension).

To many critics, the general problem is that the current (international) copyright system undermines its own goal.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The concepts of the [[public domain]] and the intrinsic freedom of information are necessary precepts for creators to be able to build on published expression.  But these are gradually being eroded, as copyright terms are repeatedly extended to last beyond the lifetime of the audience which experienced and knows of the original work.

Another effect of the repeated extension of copyright term is that current authors are shielded from competition from a wide public domain: by the time current works enter the public domain, they will almost always have become obsolete. This reduces the risk of commoditization of topical non-fiction. Out-of-copyright publishing, such as classic literature where margins are very low, generally offers only the best of each genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Karjala|first=Dennis|title=About Copyright Term Extension|url=http://www.law.asu.edu/HomePages/Karjala/OpposingCopyrightExtension/what.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030827220623/http://www.law.asu.edu/homepages/karjala/opposingcopyrightextension/what.html|archivedate=2003-08-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Luck|first=Randolph|title=Letter to Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan, opposing copyright term extension in the 104th Congress, June 28th 1996|url=http://homepages.law.asu.edu/~dkarjala/OpposingCopyrightExtension/letters/Luck%27sMusic01.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition to current copyright practice also relates to the non-observance of the principal requirement of the original Queen Anne Act, which specified that for a work to obtain copyright a copy had to be deposited in a library of record, so that unlimited copies could be made when the copyright expired. This was observed for many years but was later successfully opposed by the motion picture industry, which refused to provide copies of their films, resulting in the loss of many early films. Civilization experiences a similar loss of ancient documents from being held in private collections until they rot.

The recent success of [[free software]] projects such as [[Linux|GNU/Linux]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], and the [[Apache web server]] has demonstrated that quality works can be created even in the absence of a copyright-enforced monopoly rent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.cio.com/consultant/report2214.html&lt;/ref&gt;  These products use copyright to enforce their license terms, which are designed to ensure the free nature of the work, rather than securing exclusive rights for the holder for monetary gain. Such licenses include [[copyleft]], [[free software license|free software]], and [[open source license]]s.

Even in more traditional forms such as prose, some authors, such as [[Cory Doctorow]], retain the copyright to their work but license it for free distribution (for example under a [[Creative Commons license]]).  This has the benefit of providing a structured scheme under which authors can loosen some of the barriers that copyright imposes on others, allowing them to partially contribute the work to the community (in the form of giving a general grant on copying, reproduction, use or adaptation subject to certain conditions) while retaining other exclusive rights they hold in it.

Copyright can also be used to stifle political criticism. For example, in the US the contents of talk shows and similar programs are covered by copyright. [[Robert Greenwald]], a director of ''Uncovered: The Whole Truth About the Iraq War'' documentary was refused the right to use a clip of a [[George W. Bush]] interview from [[NBC]]'s ''Meet the Press''. Although the fair use provisions of statute and common law may apply in such cases, the risks of loss in court should there be a lawsuit and pressure from insurance companies, who regard use of almost anything (e.g., three words forming the opening of a song,) without permission as too risky, usually precludes use of materials without explicit permission, and so without a license fee.

Copyright is also conceived by some&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Electronic Frontier Foundation|url=https://www.eff.org/work}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be an artificial barrier in that "expressions" could be freely exchanged between individuals and groups if there were no copyright or other legal restrictions preventing. Such people believe that as the [[State (polity)|state]] does not necessarily possess the [[moral authority]] to enact copyright laws, individuals may vary in their observation of such laws. Others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Copyright Alliance|url=http://www.copyrightalliance.org/issues}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Motion Picture Association of America|url=http://www.mpaa.org/contentprotection/copyright-info}}&lt;/ref&gt; disagree, believing that copyright (which in the United States system, for instance, arises from provisions in the U.S. Constitution), has made and continues to make a valuable even essential contribution to the creation and dissemination of works. They also point out the social dangers inherent in the view that each individual is entitled to judge the "moral authority" of laws and to observe them or not according to individual judgments.

==Modern challenges to copyright==
{{globalize|section|USA|date=March 2017}}
Copyright concepts are under challenge in the modern era, primarily from the increasing use of [[peer-to-peer file sharing]]. Major copyright holders, such as the major [[record labels]] and the [[major film studios|movie industry]], blame the ease of copying for their decreasing profits. Alternative explanations have been put forward, such as poor product content and excessive license charges.

In the United States [[public interest]] groups, major corporations and the like, are entering the public education system to teach the curriculum from their perspectives. The lobbying group for the [[MPAA]] provide a curriculum entitled ''What's the Diff?''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediainfocenter.org/story.asp?story_id=61684893 What's the Diff?]&lt;/ref&gt; taught by a group of volunteers called Junior Achievement. The [[Business Software Alliance]] also has their own curriculum program called ''Play it Cybersafe'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playitcybersafe.com Play it Cybersafe]&lt;/ref&gt; which is distributed to school children through a magazine called ''[[The Weekly Reader]]''. The American Librarian Association released their own curriculum for librarians that was distributed in the winter of 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ala.org The American Librarian Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Placide Frans Tempels''' (18 February 1906 &amp;ndash; 9 October 1977) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Franciscan]] [[missionary]] in the [[Belgian Congo|Congo]] who became famous for his book ''[[Bantu Philosophy]]''.

==Life==
Tempels was born in [[Berlaar]], [[Belgium]].  Born Frans Tempels, he took the name "Placide" on his entry into a [[Franciscan]] [[seminary]] in 1924.  After his ordination to the [[Catholic priesthood|priesthood]] in 1930 he taught for a short time in Belgium before being posted to the [[Belgian Congo]] (now the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]) in 1933.  He stayed there for twenty-nine years, broken by only two short stays back in Belgium.  In April 1962 he returned to live in a Franciscan [[monastery]] in Berlaar, where he died in 1977.

==''Bantu Philosophy''==
{{Main|Bantu Philosophy}}

Though neither [[Africa]]n nor a [[philosopher]], Tempels had a huge influence on [[African philosophy]] through the publication in 1945 of his book ''La philosophie bantoue'' (published in [[English language|English]] translation in 1959) as ''Bantu Philosophy'').

'''Polanyi’s paradox''', named in honour of the British-Hungarian philosopher [[Michael Polanyi]], is the theory that human knowledge of how the world functions and capability are, to a large extent, beyond our explicit understanding. The theory was articulated by Michael Polanyi in his book ''The Tacit Dimension'' in 1966, but it was economist [[David Autor]] that named it as Polanyi’s paradox in his 2014 research paper on “Polanyi’s Paradox and the Shape of Employment Growth”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Autor|first=David|title=Polanyi's Paradox and the Shape of Employment Growth|url=http://www.nber.org.ezproxy1.library.usyd.edu.au/papers/w20485.pdf|pages=1–48|year=2014|series=NBER Working Paper Series|place=Cambridge, MA|publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Summarised in the slogan ‘We can know more than we can tell’, Polanyi’s paradox is mainly to explain the cognitive phenomenon that there exist many tasks which we, human beings, understand intuitively how to perform but cannot verbalize the rules or procedures behind it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This "self-ignorance" is common to many human activities, from driving a car in traffic to face recognition.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; As Polanyi argues, humans are relying on their [[tacit knowledge]], which is difficult to adequately express by verbal means, when engaging these tasks.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Tacit Dimension|last=Polanyi|first=Michael|publisher=University of Chicago Press|others=|year=May 2009|isbn=9780226672984|location=Chicago|pages=1–26|oclc=262429494}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polanyi's paradox has been widely considered a major obstacle in the fields of AI and automation, since the absence of consciously accessible knowledge creates tremendous difficulty in programming.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Origins ==
British-Hungarian philosopher Michael Polanyi regularly studied the causes behind human ability to acquire knowledge that they cannot explain through logical deduction. In his work ''The Tacit Dimension'' (1966)'','' Polanyi explored the 'tacit' dimension to human knowledge and developed the concept of "tacit knowledge", as opposed to the term "[[explicit knowledge]]".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Tacit knowledge]] can be defined as knowledge people learn from experiences and internalize unconsciously, which is therefore difficult to articulate and codify it in a tangible form. Explicit knowledge, the opposite of tacit knowledge, is knowledge that can be readily verbalized and formalized.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Tacit knowledge is largely acquired through [[implicit learning]], the process by which information is learned independently of the subjects' awareness. For example, native speakers tacitly acquire their language in early childhood without consciously studying specific grammar rules (explicit knowledge), but with extensive exposure to television and day-to-day communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reber|first=Arthur|date=September 1989|title=Implicit Learning and Tacit Knowledge|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arthur_Reber/publication/232481584_Implicit_learning_of_tacit_knowledge/links/0a85e533465dd6c4ef000000.pdf|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|volume=118|pages=219–235|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, people can only limitedly transfer their tacit knowledge through close interactions (sharing experiences with one another or observing others' behaviors). A certain level of trust needs to be established between individuals to capture tacit knowledge.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ganga Rejuvenation : Governance Challenges and Policy Options|last=Asanarong|first=Thanathorn|last2=Jeon|first2=Sowon|last3=Ren|first3=Yuanlin|last4=Yeo|first4=Christopher|date=18 December 2018|publisher=World Scientific|others=Wu Xun, Robert James Wasson, Ora-Orn Poocharoen|isbn=9789814704588|location=New Jersey|pages=349|chapter=Creating a Knowledge Management Culture for Ganga River|oclc=1013819475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tacit knowledge comprises a range of conceptual and sensory information that is featured with strong personal subjectivity. It is implicitly reflected in human actions; as argued by Polanyi, "tacit knowledge dwells in our awareness".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; People's skills, experiences, insight, creativity and judgement all fall into this dimension.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|last=Chugh|first=Ritesh|title=Do Australian Universities Encourage Tacit Knowledge Transfer|url=https://www.academia.edu/19661139|journal=Proceedings of the 7th International Joint Conference on Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management|pages=128–135|year=2015|place=Lisbon, PT}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tacit knowledge can also be described as ''know-how,'' distinguishing from ''know-that'' or ''facts.''&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Before Polanyi, Gilbert Ryle published a paper in 1945 drawing the distinction between ''knowing-that (knowledge of proposition)'' and ''knowing-how.'' According to Ryle, this ''know-how'' knowledge is the instinctive and intrinsic knowledge ingrained in the individual's human capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ryle|first=Gilbert|date=1945|title=Knowing How and Knowing That: The Presidential Address|journal=Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society|volume=46|pages=1–16|jstor=4544405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since tacit knowledge cannot be stated in propositional or formal form, Polanyi concludes such inability in articulation in the slogan ‘We can know more than we can tell’.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Daily activities based on tacit knowledge include recognizing a face, driving a car, riding a bike, writing a persuasive paragraph, developing a hypothesis to explain a poorly understood phenomenon.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Take facial recognition as an illustration: we can recognize our acquaintance's face out of a million others while we are not conscious about the knowledge of his face. It would be difficult for us to describe the precise arrangement of his eyes, nose and mouth, since we memorize the face unconsciously.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

As a prelude to ''The Tacit Dimension'', in his book ''Personal Knowledge'' (1958), Polanyi claims that all knowing is personal, emphasizing the profound effects of personal feelings and commitments on the practice of science and knowledge. Arguing against the then dominant Empiricists view that minds and experiences are reducible to sense data and collections of rules, he advocates a [[Postpositivism|post-positivist]] approach that recognizes human knowledge is often beyond their explicit expression. Any attempt to specify tacit knowing only leads to self-evident axioms that cannot tell us why we should accept them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Personal Knowledge : Towards a Post-critical Philosophy|last=Polanyi|first=Michael,|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|others=|year=1974|isbn=978-0226672885|edition=  |location=Chicago|pages=|oclc=880960082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications ==
Polanyi's observation has deep implications in the AI field since the paradox he identified that "our tacit knowledge of how the world works often exceeds our explicit understanding" accounts for many of the challenges for computerization and automation over the past five decades.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Automation requires high levels of exactness to inform the computer what is supposed to be done while tacit knowledge cannot be conveyed in a propositional form. Therefore, machines cannot provide successful outcomes in many cases: they have explicit knowledge (raw data) but nevertheless, do not know how to use such knowledge to understand the task as whole.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This discrepancy between human reasoning and AI learning algorithms makes it difficult to automate tasks that demand common sense, flexibility, adaptability and judgment — human intuitive knowledge.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Android Dreams: the Past, Present and Future of Artificial Intelligence|last=Walsh|first=Toby|publisher=C Hurst &amp; Co Publishers Ltd|date=September 7, 2017|isbn=9781849048712|location=London|pages=89–97|oclc=985805795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MIT economist David Autor is one of the leading sceptics who doubt the prospects for machine intelligence. Despite the exponential growth in computational resources and the relentless pace of automation since the 1990s, Autor argues, Polanyi's paradox impedes modern algorithms to replace human labor in a range of skilled jobs. The extent of machine substitution of human labor, therefore, has been overestimated by journalists and expert commentators.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although contemporary computer science strives for prevailing over Polanyi's paradox, the ever-changing, unstructured nature of some activities currently presents intimidating challenges for automation. Despite years of time and billions of investment spent on the development of [[self-driving car]]s and cleaning robots, these machine learning systems continue to struggle with their low adaptability and interpretability, from self-driving cars' inability to make an unexpected detour to cleaning robots' vulnerability to unmonitored pets or kids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Humans as a Service : the Promise and Perils of Work in the Gig Economy|last=Prassl|first=Jeremias|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2018|isbn=9780198797012|edition=  |location=Oxford|pages=138–139|oclc=1005117556}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, to let self-driving cars function optimally, we have to change current road infrastructure significantly, minimizing the need for human capabilities in the whole driving process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/01/15/5-confounding-questions-that-hold-the-key-to-the-future-of-driverless-cars/|title=5 Confounding Questions that Hold the Key to the Future of Driverless Cars|last=Badger|first=Emily|date=January 15, 2015|website=Washington Post|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasing [[Job polarisation|occupational polarisation]] in the past few decades —the growth of both high-paid, high-skill abstract jobs and lower-paid, low-skill manual jobs — has been a manifestation of Polanyi's paradox. According to Autor, there are two types of tasks proven stubbornly challenging for artificial intelligence (AI): abstract tasks that require problem-solving capabilities, intuition, creativity and persuasion on the one hand, and manual tasks demanding situational adaptability, visual recognition, language understanding, and in-person interactions on the other. Abstract tasks are characteristic of professional, managerial, and technical occupations, while service and laborer occupations involve many manual tasks (e.g. cleaning, lifting and throwing). These jobs tend to be complemented by machines rather than substituted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

By contrast, as the price of computing power declines, computers extensively substitute for routine tasks that can be codified into clear sets of instructions, resulting in a dramatical decline in employment of routine task-&amp;shy;intensive jobs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This polarization has resulted in a shrinking middle class across industrialized economies since many middle-income occupations in sales, office and administrative work and repetitive production work are task-&amp;shy;intensive. Moreover, the subsequent growth in income inequality and wealth disparity has recently emerged as a major socio-economic issue in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vardi|first=Moshe|date=February 2015|title=Is Information Technology Destroying the Middle Class?|url=https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/2/182648-is-information-technology-destroying-the-middle-class/fulltext|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=58|pages=5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Some technological optimists argue that recent advances in [[machine learning]] have overcome Polanyi's paradox. Instead of relaying on programmer’s algorithms to instruct them in human knowledge, computer systems are now able to learn tacit rules from context, abundant data, and applied statistics on their own. Since machines can infer the tacit knowledge that human beings draw upon from examples without human assistance, they are no longer limited by those rules tacitly applied but not explicitly understood by humans.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Citation|last=Susskind|first=Daniel|title=Re-Thinking the Capabilities of Machines in Economics|url=https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/materials/papers/15127/825-susskind-capabilities-of-machines.pdf|pages=1–14|year=2017|series=University of Oxford Department of Economics Discussion Paper Series|place=Oxford, OX}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lee Sedol (B) vs AlphaGo (W) - Game 1.jpg|thumb|Lee Sedol (B) vs AlphaGo (W) - Game 1]]
[[AlphaGo]] program built by the Google subsidiary [[DeepMind]] is a great example of how advances in AI have allowed mindless machines to perform tasks based on tacit knowledge outstandingly. In the 2016 tournament of the strategy game Go, DeepMind’s AlphaGo program successfully defeated one of the world’s top GO players, [[Lee Sedol|Lee Se-dol]], four games to one. DeepMind team employed an approach known as [[deep learning]] to build human-type judgment into AI systems; therefore, they can figure out complex winning strategies by seeing vast examples of Go matches.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/opinion/where-computers-defeat-humans-and-where-they-cant.html|title=Where Computers Defeat Humans, and Where They Can’t|last=McAfee|first=Andrew|date=16 March 2016|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-10-04|last2=Brynjolfsson|first2=Erik|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, as Carr argues, the assumption that computers need to be able to reproduce tacit knowledge applied by humans to perform complicated tasks is essentially doubtable. When performing demanding tasks, it is not necessary for systems and machines to reflect the rules that human beings follow at all. The requirement is to replicate our outcomes for practical purposes, rather than our means.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Glass Cage: Automation and Us|last=Carr|first=Nicholas|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|date=September 29, 2014|isbn=9780393240764|edition=  First|location=New York|pages=11–12|oclc=870098283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jerry Kaplan]], a Silicon Valley entrepreneur and AI expert, also illustrates this point in his book ''Humans Need Not Apply'' by discussing four resources and capabilities required to accomplish any given task: awareness, energy, reasoning and means. Humans' biological system (the brain-body complex) naturally integrates all these four properties, while in the electronic domain machines nowadays are given these abilities by accelerating developments in robotics, machine learning, and perception powering systems. For example, sensory data provided by a wide network of sensors enable AI to perceive various aspects of the environment and respond instantly in chaotic and complex real-world situations (awareness); orders and signals for actuating devices can be centralised and managed in [[Computer cluster|server clusters]] or on the 'cloud' (reasoning).&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Humans Need Not Apply : a Guide to Wealth and Work in the Age of Artificial Intelligence|last=Kaplan|first=Jerry|publisher=Yale University Press|date=August 4, 2015|isbn=9780300223576|location=New Haven|pages=41–43, 145|oclc=907143085}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaplan's argument directly supports the proposition that Polanyi's paradox can no longer impede further levels of automation, whether in performing routine jobs or manual jobs. As Kaplan puts it, "Automation is blind to the colour of your collar."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

One example confirms Kaplan's argument is the introduction of Cloud AutoML, an automated system that could help every business design AI software, by Google Brain AI research group in 2017. The learning algorithms of AutoML automates the process of building machine-learning models that can take on a particular task, aiming to democratize AI to the largest possible community of developers and businesses. According to Google’s CEO, Cloud AutoML has taken over some of the work of programmers (which is, in the words of Autor, "abstract task") and thereby offered one solution to the shortage in machine-learning experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/607894/why-googles-ceo-is-excited-about-automating-artificial-intelligence/|title=Google’s CEO is excited about seeing AI take over some work of his AI experts|last=Simonite|first=Tom|date=May 17, 2017|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-10-30|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moravec's paradox ===

[[Moravec's paradox|Moravec’s paradox]] is very closed related to Polanyi's paradox, which claims that compared with sophisticated tasks demanding high-level reasoning, it is harder for computers to master low-level physical and cognitive skills that are natural and easy for humans to perform.

Robotics experts have, therefore, discovered that machines are difficult to master the skills of even the least-trained manual worker, since these jobs require perception and mobility (tacit knowledge).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In the words of the cognitive scientist Steven Pinker from his book ''[[The Language Instinct]],'' "The main lesson of thirty-five years of AI research is that the hard problems are easy and the easy problems are hard."&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Language|last=Pinker|first=Steven|publisher=William Morrow and Company|year=1994|isbn=978-0688121419|location=New York|pages=|oclc=28723210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corresponding to David Autor's discussion on jobs polarization, Pinker maintains that the appearance of the new generation's intelligent machines would place stock analysts, petrochemical engineers and parole board members in danger of being replaced.

=== Moore's Law ===
[[Moore's Law]] is the observation articulated by [[Gordon Moore]] in 1965 that the number of transistors that could be fitted onto an integrated circuit doubles every two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Gordon|date=April 19, 1965|title=Cramming More Components onto Integrated Circuits|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/jproc.2010.2044436|journal=Electronics|volume=38|issue=8|pages=114–117|doi=|issn=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore's law has significantly contributed to the advancement of machine learning and AI. The larger and larger capacity of a chip allows for the advent of extremely small data-collecting devices, which could be placed on any intelligent machine. Innovations resulted from the exponentially growing power of computer chips include mobile apps, video games, spreadsheets, and accurate weather forecasts.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601441/moores-law-is-dead-now-what/|title=The Foundation of the Computing Industry’s Innovation is Faltering.

Moore’s Law changes the way people are valued. As machines can do more and more tasks for free, people become correspondingly expensive. On the other hand, Moore's Law to some extents erases the line between an ordinary person and a skilled person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/829937196|title=Who Owns the Future?|last=Lanier|first=Jaron|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2013|isbn=9781451654967|edition= First Simon &amp; Schuster hardcover |location=New York|pages=|oclc=829937196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Pragmaticism'''" is a term used by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] for his pragmatic philosophy starting in 1905, in order [[stipulative definition|to distance himself and it]] from [[pragmatism]], the original name, which had been used in a manner he did not approve of in the "literary journals". Peirce in 1905 announced his coinage "pragmaticism", saying that it was "ugly enough to be safe from kidnappers" (''Collected Papers'' (CP) 5.414). Today, outside of philosophy, "pragmatism" is often taken to refer to a compromise of aims or principles, even a ruthless search for mercenary advantage. Peirce gave other or more specific reasons for the distinction in a surviving draft letter that year and in later writings. Peirce's pragmatism, that is, pragmaticism, differed in Peirce's view from other pragmatisms by its commitments to the spirit of strict logic, the immutability of truth, the reality of infinity, and the difference between (1) actively willing to control thought, to doubt, to weigh reasons, and (2) willing not to exert the will, willing to believe.&lt;ref name=NA&gt;Peirce (1908), "[[s:A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God|A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God]]", ''Hibbert Journal'' v. 7, CP 6.452-485, EP 2:434-450, and elsewhere. See the discussion of pragmatism toward the end. Depending on the edition, it may appear in Section V or in an "additament" afterward.&lt;/ref&gt; In his view his pragmatism is, strictly speaking, not itself a whole philosophy, but instead a general method for the clarification of ideas. He first publicly formulated his pragmatism as an aspect of scientific logic along with [[Founders of statistics|principles of statistics]] and modes of inference in his "[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#illus|Illustrations of the Logic of Science]]" series of articles in 1877-8.

==Pragmatic maxim==

Whether one chooses to call it "[[pragmatism]]" or "pragmaticism"—and Peirce himself was not always consistent about it even after the notorious renaming—his conception of pragmatic philosophy is based on one or another version of the so-called "[[pragmatic maxim]]".  Here is one of his more emphatic statements of it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Pragmaticism was originally enounced in the form of a maxim, as follows:  Consider what effects, that might ''conceivably'' have practical bearings, you ''conceive'' the objects of your ''conception'' to have.  Then, your ''conception'' of those effects is the whole of your ''conception'' of the object (CP 5.438).&lt;ref&gt;See p. 481 in Peirce, C.&amp;nbsp;S. (1905), "Issues of Pragmaticism", The ''Monist'', vol. 15, pp. 481-499, ''Google Books'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=j6oLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA481-IA20 Eprint], ''Internet Archive'' [https://archive.org/details/monistquart15hegeuoft Eprint]. Reprinted ''Collected Papers'' (CP) v. 5, paragraphs 438-463, see 438, and in ''Charles S. Peirce: Selected Writings'', pp. 203-226.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 1909 ''[[Century Dictionary]] Supplement'', the entry for pragmaticism, written, it now appears, by John Dewey,&lt;ref&gt;Peirce had primary responsibility in the ''Century Dictionary'' for terms in logic, philosophy and other fields, see B:139. "Pragmatism" and presumably "pragmaticism" were among the words in Peirce's charge in the ''Century Dictionary'' - see under "[http://www.pep.uqam.ca/listsofwords.pep?l=P P] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002082422/http://www.pep.uqam.ca/listsofwords.pep?l=P |date=2011-10-02 }}" in the list of words at [http://www.pep.uqam.ca/short.pep PEP-UQÀM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706211228/http://www.pep.uqam.ca/short.pep |date=2011-07-06 }}, the Peirce Edition Project's branch at Université du Québec à Montréal (UQÀM), which is working on [[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#W|Writings]] v. 7: Peirce's work on the ''Century Dictionary''. However, [[Joseph Morton Ransdell|Joseph M. Ransdell]] reported that PEP-UQÀM's director François Latraverse informed him that [[John Dewey]] actually wrote the ''Supplement''s definitions of "pragmatic", "pragmatism", etc. See [http://article.gmane.org/gmane.science.philosophy.peirce/6 Ransdell's 2006 January 13 post] to peirce-l.&lt;/ref&gt; was

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''pragmaticism''' (prag-mat'''′''' i-sizm), ''&lt;abbr title=noun&gt;n.&lt;/abbr&gt;'' [''pragmatic'' + ''ism''.] A special and limited form of pragmatism, in which the pragmatism is restricted to the determining of the meaning of concepts (particularly of philosophic concepts) by consideration of the experimental differences in the conduct of life which would conceivably result from the affirmation or denial of the meaning in question. &lt;blockquote style="margin-top:0;font-size:94%"&gt;He [the writer] framed the theory that a conception, that is, the rational purport of a word or other expression, lies exclusively in its conceivable bearing upon the conduct of life.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. To serve the precise purpose of expressing the original definition, he begs to announce the birth of the word "''pragmaticism''." &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''C.&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp;Peirce'', in The Monist, April, 1905, p.&amp;nbsp;166. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Pragmatism's origin==

Pragmatism as a philosophical movement originated in 1872 in discussions in [[The Metaphysical Club]] among Peirce, [[William James]], [[Chauncey Wright]], [[John Fiske (philosopher)|John Fiske]], [[Francis Ellingwood Abbot]], [[Nicholas St. John Green]], and [[Joseph Bangs Warner]].  The first use in print of the name ''pragmatism'' appears to have been in 1898 by James, who credited Peirce with having coined the name during the early 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;As Brent (B:86) points out, in a letter November 10, 1900 (CP 8:253) to James, Peirce wrote:{{quote|Now, however, I have a particular occasion to write. Baldwin, arrived at J in his dictionary, suddenly calls on me to do the rest of the logic, in the utmost haste, and various questions of terminology come up. &lt;br&gt;Who originated the term ''pragmatism'', I or you? Where did it first appear in print? What do you understand by it?}}
to which James replied (CP 8:253 footnote 8) on a post card dated November 26, 1900, Widener Library (Cambridge, Massachusetts) VB2a:{{quote|You invented 'pragmatism' for which I gave you full credit in a lecture entitled 'Philosophical conceptions and practical results' of which I sent you 2 (unacknowledged) copies a couple of years ago.}}
As Brent also points out (B:88), Peirce — or as Peirce scholars recently say, Dewey ([[#Dewey|see above]]) — in the 1909 ''[[Century Dictionary]] Supplement'' [[s:The Century Dictionary/Volume 12/P|definition of pragmatism]] (''Wikisource''), wrote: {{quote|In an article for "The Monist" for 1905, Mr. Peirce says that he "has used it continually in philosophical conversation since, perhaps, the mid-seventies." The term was publicly introduced in print by Professor William James in 1898 in an address upon "Philosophical Conceptions and Practical Realities," in which authorship of the term and of the method is credited to Mr. Peirce.}}
James, William (1898), "Philosophical Conceptions and Practical Results", delivered before the Philosophical Union of the University of California at Berkeley, August 26, 1898, and first printed in the ''University Chronicle'' 1, September 1898, pp. 287-310. ''Internet Archive'' [https://archive.org/stream/philosophicalcon00jameuoft#page/n4/mode/1up Eprint]. On [https://archive.org/stream/philosophicalcon00jameuoft#page/290/mode/1up p. 290]:: {{quote|I refer to Mr. Charles S. Peirce, with whose very existence as a philosopher I dare say many of you are unacquainted. He is one of the most original of contemporary thinkers; and the principle of practicalism or pragmatism, as he called it, when I first heard him enunciate it at Cambridge in the early 70s is the clue or compass by following which I find myself more and more confirmed in believing we may keep our feet upon the proper trail.}}
James credited Peirce again the 1901-1902 Gifford Lectures that were published as ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'' (p. 444), and then in the 1906 lectures that were published in 1907 as ''[[s:Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking|Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking]]'', see Lecture 2, fourth paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt;

James, among others, regarded Peirce's 1877-8 "Illustrations of the Logic of Science" series, especially "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]" (1878) as [[pragmatism]]'s foundation.&lt;ref&gt;See James (1897), ''Will to Believe'' (which James dedicated to Peirce), see p. 124 and footnote via ''Google Books'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=wRMXL4uYEegC&amp;pg=PA124 Eprint]: {{quote|Indeed, it may be said that if two apparently different definitions of the reality before us should have identical consequences, those two definitions would really be identical definitions, made delusively to appear different merely by the different verbiage in which they are expressed.¹&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;¹ See the admirably original "Illustrations of the Logic of Science," by C. S. Peirce, especially the second paper, "How to make our Thoughts clear," {{sic}} in the Popular Science Monthly for January, 1878.}} See also James's 1907 ''[[s:Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking|Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking]]'', Lecture 2, fourth paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce (CP 5.11-12), like James&lt;ref&gt;James, William (1907) ''[[s:Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking|Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; saw pragmatism as embodying familiar attitudes, in philosophy and elsewhere, elaborated into a new deliberate method of thinking and resolving dilemmas. Peirce differed from James and the early [[John Dewey]], in some of their tangential enthusiasms, in being decidedly more rationalistic and realistic, in several senses of those terms, throughout the preponderance of his own philosophical moods.

In a 1906 manuscript,&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S., "The Founding of Pragmatism", manuscript written 1906, published in ''The Hound &amp; Horn: A Harvard Miscellany'' v. II, n. 3, April–June 1929, pp. 282–5, see 283–4, reprinted 1934 as "Historical Affinities and Genesis" in ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]]'' v. 5, paragraphs 11–13, see 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce wrote that, in the Metaphysical Club decades earlier, Nicholas St. John Green&lt;blockquote&gt;often urged the importance of applying [[Alexander Bain|Bain]]'s definition of belief, as "that upon which a man is prepared to act." From this definition, pragmatism is scarce more than a corollary; so that I am disposed to think of him as the grandfather of pragmatism.&lt;/blockquote&gt; James and Peirce, inspired by crucial links among belief, conduct, and [[disposition]], agreed with Green. [[John Shook]] has said, "Chauncey Wright also deserves considerable credit, for as both Peirce and James recall, it was Wright who demanded a phenomenalist and [[Fallibilism|fallibilist]] [[empiricism]] as a vital alternative to rationalistic speculation."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Shook|Shook, John]] (undated), "The Metaphysical Club", the ''Pragmatism Cybrary''. [http://www.pragmatism.org/research/metaphysical_club.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt;

Pragmatism is regarded as a distinctively [[United States|American]] philosophy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} As advocated by James, [[John Dewey]], [[F. C. S. Schiller]], [[George Herbert Mead]], and others, it has proved durable and popular. But Peirce did not seize on this fact to enhance his reputation, and even coined the word "pragmaticism" to distinguish his philosophical position.

==Clarification of ideas in inquiry==

Pragmatism starts with the idea that belief is that upon which one is prepared to act. Peirce's pragmatism is about conceptions of objects. His pragmatism is a method for fruitfully sorting out conceptual confusions caused, for example, by distinctions that make (sometimes needful) formal yet not practical differences. It equates any conception of an object with a conception of that object's effects to a general extent of those conceived effects' conceivable implications for informed practice. Those conceivable practical implications are the conception's meaning. The meaning is the consequent form of conduct or practice that would be implied by accepting the conception as true. Peirce's pragmaticism, in the strict sense, is about the conceptual elucidation of conceptions into such meanings — about how to make our ideas clear. Making them true, in the sense of proving and bearing them out in fruitful practice, goes beyond that. A conception's truth is its correspondence to the real, to that which would be found by investigation taken far enough. A conception's actual confirmation (if it occurs) is neither its meaning nor its truth ''per se'', but an actual upshot.

In "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]",&lt;ref&gt;See also "The Logic of Relatives," The ''Monist'', Vol. 7, 1897, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=pa0LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA161 161]-217 (via ''Google Books''). Reprinted in CP, v. 3, paragraphs 456-552.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce discusses three grades of clearness of conception: &lt;br&gt;
:1. Clearness of a conception familiar and readily used even if unanalyzed and undeveloped.
:2. Clearness of a conception in virtue of clearness of its definition's parts, in virtue of which logicians called an idea ''distinct'', that is, clarified by analysis of just what elements make the given idea applicable. Elsewhere, echoing Kant, Peirce calls such a definition "nominal" (CP 5.553).
:3. Clearness in virtue of clearness of conceivable practical implications of the object's effects as conceived of, such as can lead to fruitful reasoning, especially on difficult problems. Here he introduces that which he later called the [[pragmatic maxim]].

By way of example of how to clarify conceptions, he addressed conceptions about truth and the real as questions of the [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Presuppositions of logic|presuppositions of reasoning]] in general. To reason is to presuppose (and at least to hope), as a principle of the reasoner's self-regulation, that the truth is independent of our vagaries of opinion and is discoverable. In clearness's second grade (the "nominal" grade), he defines truth as the correspondence of a sign (in particular, a proposition) to its object, and the real as the object (be it a possibility or quality, or an actuality or brute fact, or a necessity or norm or law) to which a true sign corresponds, such that truth and the real are independent of that which you or I or any actual, definite [[Community of inquiry|community of inquirers]] think. After that needful but confined step, next in clearness's third grade (the pragmatic, practice-oriented grade) he defines truth — not as actual consensus, such that to inquire would be to poll the experts — but as that which ''would'' be reached, sooner or later but still inevitably, by research taken far enough, such that the real does depend on that ideal final opinion—a dependence to which he appeals in theoretical arguments elsewhere, for instance for the long-run validity of the rule of induction.&lt;ref name=Induction&gt;"That the rule of induction will hold good in the long run may be deduced from the principle that reality is only the object of the final opinion to which sufficient investigation would lead", in Peirce, C.&amp;nbsp;S. (1878 April), "The Probability of Induction", p. 718 (''Internet Archive'' ''[https://archive.org/stream/popscimonthly12yoummiss#page/728/mode/1up Eprint]) ''in ''Popular Science Monthly'', v. 12, pp. 705-18. Reprinted (''Chance, Love, and Logic'', pp. 82-105), (CP 2.669-93), (''Philosophical Writings of Peirce'', pp. 174-89), (W 3:290-305), (EP 1:155-69).&lt;/ref&gt; (Peirce held that one cannot have absolute theoretical assurance of having actually reached the truth, and later said that the confession of inaccuracy and one-sidedness is an essential ingredient of a true abstract statement.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1902), "''Logical''" in "Truth and Falsity and Error", ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology'' v. 2, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dc8YAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA718#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Truth%20is%20that%20concordance%22 p. 718]. Reprinted CP v. 5, paragraphs 565-566.&lt;/ref&gt;) Peirce argues that even to argue against the independence and discoverability of truth and the real is to presuppose that there is, about that very question under argument, a truth with just such independence and discoverability. For more on Peirce's theory of truth, see the Peirce section in [[Pragmatic theory of truth#Peirce|Pragmatic theory of truth]]. Peirce's discussions and definitions of truth have influenced several epistemic truth theorists and been used as foil for [[deflationary theory of truth|deflationary]] and [[correspondence theory of truth|correspondence]] theories of truth.

Peirce said that a conception's meaning consists in "[[Pragmatic maxim#2|all general modes of rational conduct]]" implied by "acceptance" of the conception—that is, if one were to accept, first of all, the conception as true, then what could one conceive to be consequent general modes of rational conduct by all who accept the conception as true?—the whole of such consequent general modes is the whole meaning. His pragmatism, since a conception is general, does not equate a conception's meaning, its intellectual purport, with any definite set of actual consequences or upshots corroborating or undermining the conception or its worth, nor does it equate its meaning, much less its truth (if it is true), with the conceived or actual benefit or cost of the conception itself, like a meme (or, say, propaganda), outside the perspective of its being true in what it purports. If it is true, its truth is not transitory but instead immutable and independent of actual trends of opinion. His pragmatism also bears no resemblance to "vulgar" pragmatism, which misleadingly connotes a ruthless and [[Machiavelli]]an search for mercenary or political advantage. Rather, Peirce's pragmatic maxim is the heart of his pragmatism as a method of experimentational mental [[Pragmatic maxim#6|reflection]]&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1902), CP 5.13 note 1&lt;/ref&gt; arriving at conceptions in terms of conceivable confirmatory and disconfirmatory circumstances—a method hospitable to the generation of explanatory hypotheses, and conducive to the employment and improvement of verification&lt;ref&gt;See CP 1.34 [http://www.textlog.de/4220.html Eprint] (in "The Spirit of Scholasticism"), where Peirce attributes the success of modern science not so much to a novel interest in verification as to the improvement of verification.&lt;/ref&gt; to test the truth of putative knowledge.

Peirce's pragmatism, as method and theory of ''definitions and the clearness of ideas'', is a department within his theory of inquiry,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.cspeirce.com/homepage/ransdell.htm Joseph Ransdell]'s comments and his tabular list of titles of Peirce's proposed list of memoirs in 1902 for his Carnegie application, [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/intro/l75intro.htm Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt; which he variously called "Methodeutic" and "Philosophical or Speculative Rhetoric". He applied his pragmatism as a method throughout his work.

Peirce called his pragmatism "the logic of [[Abductive reasoning|abduction]]",&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1903), "Pragmatism — The Logic of Abduction", CP v. 5, paragraphs 195-205, especially paragraph 196. [http://www.textlog.de/7663.html Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; that is, the logic of inference to explanatory hypotheses. As a method conducive to hypotheses as well as predictions and testing, pragmatism leads beyond the usual duo of foundational alternatives, namely:

:* [[Deductive reasoning|Deduction]] from self-evident truths, or ''[[rationalism]]'';

:* [[Inductive reasoning|Induction]] from experiential phenomena, or ''[[empiricism]]''.

His approach is distinct from [[foundationalism]], empiricist or otherwise, as well as from [[coherentism]], by the following three dimensions:

:* Active process of theory generation, with no prior assurance of truth;

:* Subsequent application of the contingent theory in order to clarify its logical and practical implications;

:* Testing and evaluation of the provisional theory's utility for the ''[[anticipation]]'' of future experience, and that in dual senses of the word: ''[[prediction]]'' and ''control''. Peirce's appreciation of these three dimensions serves to flesh out a [[physiognomy]] of inquiry far more solid than the flatter image of inductive generalization ''simpliciter'', which is merely the relabeling of phenomenological patterns.  Peirce's pragmatism was the first time the [[scientific method]] was proposed as an [[epistemology]] for philosophical questions.

A theory that proves itself more successful than its rivals in predicting and controlling our world is said to be nearer the truth. This is an operational notion of truth employed by scientists.

In "[http://www.peirce.org/writings/p107.html The Fixation of Belief]", Peirce characterized inquiry in general not as the pursuit of truth ''per se'' but as the struggle to settle disturbances or conflicts of belief, irritating, inhibitory doubts, belief being that on which one is willing to act. That let Peirce frame scientific inquiry not only as a special kind of inquiry in a broader spectrum, but also, like inquiry generally, as based on actual doubts, not mere verbal doubts (such as [[hyperbolic doubt]]), which he held to be fruitless, and it let him also frame it, by the same stroke, as requiring that proof rest on propositions free from actual doubt, rather than on ultimate and absolutely indubitable propositions. He outlined four methods, ordered from least to most successful in achieving a secure fixation of belief:
# The method of tenacity (policy of sticking to initial belief) — which brings comforts and decisiveness, but leads to trying to ignore contrary information and others' views, as if truth were intrinsically private, not public. The method goes against the social impulse and easily falters since one may well fail to avoid noticing when another's opinion is as good as one's own initial opinion. Its successes can be brilliant but tend to be transitory.
# The method of authority — which overcomes disagreements but sometimes brutally. Its successes can be majestic and long-lasting, but it cannot regulate people thoroughly enough to suppress doubts indefinitely, especially when people learn about other societies present and past.
# The method of the ''a priori'' — which promotes conformity less brutally but fosters opinions as something like tastes, arising in conversation and comparisons of perspectives in terms of "what is agreeable to reason." Thereby it depends on fashion in paradigms and goes in circles over time. It is more intellectual and respectable but, like the first two methods, sustains accidental and capricious beliefs, destining some minds to doubt it.
# The method of science — the only one whereby inquiry can, by its own account, go wrong ([[fallibilism]]), and purposely tests itself and criticizes, corrects, and improves itself.

Peirce held that, in practical affairs, slow and stumbling ratiocination is often dangerously inferior to instinct and traditional sentiment, and that the scientific method is best suited to theoretical research,&lt;ref&gt;"Philosophy and the Conduct of Life", 1898, Lecture 1 of the Cambridge (MA) Conferences Lectures, published CP 1.616-48 in part and in ''Reasoning and the Logic of Things'', Ketner (ed., intro.) and Putnam (intro., comm.), 105-22, reprinted in EP 2:27-41.&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn should not be bound to the other methods and to practical ends; reason's "first rule" is that, in order to learn, one must desire to learn and, as a corollary, must not block the way of inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1899), "F.R.L." [First Rule of Logic], CP v. 1, paragraphs 135-40. [http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/frl_99.htm Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt; What recommends the scientific method of inquiry above all others is that it is deliberately designed to arrive, eventually, at the ultimately most secure beliefs, upon which the most successful practices can eventually be based. Starting from the idea that people seek not truth ''per se'' but instead to subdue irritating, inhibitory doubt, Peirce shows how, through the struggle, some can come to submit to truth, seek as truth the guidance of potential practice correctly to its given goal, and wed themselves to the scientific method.

==Pragmaticism's name==

[[Image:Wm james.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William James]]&lt;br&gt;1842–1910]] [[Image:FCSSchiller Slosson1917.jpg|thumb|upright|[[F. C. S. Schiller]]&lt;br&gt;1863–1937]]  It is sometimes stated that James' and other philosophers' use of the word ''pragmatism'' so dismayed Peirce that he renamed his own variant ''pragmaticism''. [[Susan Haack]] has disagreed,&lt;ref&gt;1998, ''Manifesto of a Passionate Moderate'', Chicago IL: University of Chicago Press, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; pointing out the context in which Peirce publicly introduced the latter term in 1905. Haack's excerpt of Peirce begins below at the words "But at present...," and continues with some ellipses. The fuller excerpt below supports her case further:
{{quote|[The] word "pragmatism" has gained general recognition in a generalised sense that seems to argue power of growth and vitality. The famed psychologist, [[William James|James]], first took it up, seeing that his "radical empiricism" substantially answered to the writer's definition of pragmatism, albeit with a certain difference in the point of view. Next, the admirably clear and brilliant thinker, Mr. [[F. C. S. Schiller|Ferdinand C. S. Schiller]], casting about for a more attractive name for the "anthropomorphism" of his ''Riddle of the Sphinx'', lit, in that most remarkable paper of his on ''Axioms as Postulates'', upon the same designation "pragmatism," which in its original sense was in generic agreement with his own doctrine, for which he has since found the more appropriate specification "humanism," while he still retains "pragmatism" in a somewhat wider sense. So far all went happily. But at present, the word begins to be met with occasionally in the literary journals, where it gets abused in the merciless way that words have to expect when they fall into literary clutches. Sometimes the manners of the British have effloresced in scolding at the word as ill-chosen, —ill-chosen, that is, to express some meaning that it was rather designed to exclude. So then, the writer, finding his bantling "pragmatism" so promoted, feels that it is time to kiss his child good-by and relinquish it to its higher destiny; while to serve the precise purpose of expressing the original definition, he begs to announce the birth of the word "pragmaticism", which is ugly enough to be safe from kidnappers.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, on p [https://books.google.com/books?id=j6oLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA165 p. 165]-166 in "What Pragmatism Is", ''The Monist'', v. XV, n. 2, April 1905, pp. 161-81, reprinted CP 5.411-37, see 5.414.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Then, in a surviving draft letter to Calderoni, dated by the CP editors as ''circa'' that same year 1905, Peirce said regarding his above-quoted discussion:
{{quote|In the April number of the ''Monist'' I proposed that the word 'pragmatism' should hereafter be used somewhat loosely to signify affiliation with [[F. C. S. Schiller|Schiller]], [[William James|James]], [[John Dewey|Dewey]], [[Josiah Royce|Royce]], and the rest of us, while the particular doctrine which I invented the word to denote, which is your first kind of pragmatism, should be called 'pragmaticism.' The extra syllable will indicate the narrower meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Signor Calderoni (c. 1905), CP 8.205. See under [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/pragmaticism.html Pragmaticism] in the CDPT.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Indeed in the ''Monist'' article Peirce had said that the coinage "pragmaticism" was intended "to serve the precise purpose of expressing the original definition". Of course this does not mean that Peirce regarded his fellow pragmatist philosophers as word-kidnappers. To the contrary he had said, regarding James's and Schiller's uses of the word "pragmatism": "So far, all went happily." So it would seem that Peirce intended the coinage "pragmaticism" for two distinguishable purposes: (1) protection from literary journals and word-kidnappers, and (2) reference strictly to his own form of pragmatism, as opposed even to other pragmatisms that had not moved him to the new name. In the letter to Calderoni, Peirce did not reject all significant affiliation with fellow pragmatists, and instead said "the rest of us". Nor did he reject all such affiliation in later discussions.

However, in the following year 1906, in a manuscript "A Sketch of Logical Critics",&lt;ref&gt;''Essential Peirce'' v. 2, pp. 451-62, see pp. 457-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce wrote:
{{quote|I have always fathered my pragmati&lt;/em&gt;ci&lt;/em&gt;sm (as I have called it since James and Schiller made the word [pragmatism] imply "the will to believe," the mutability of truth, the soundness of Zeno's refutation of motion, and pluralism generally), upon Kant, Berkeley, and Leibniz....}}
(Peirce proceeded to criticize J.&amp;nbsp;S. Mill but acknowledged probable aid from Mill's ''Examination''.)

Then, in 1908, in his article "[[s:A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God|A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God]]",&lt;ref name=NA/&gt; mentioning both James and the journalist, pragmatist, and literary author [[Giovanni Papini]], Peirce wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1871, in a Metaphysical Club in Cambridge, Mass., I used to preach this principle as a sort of logical gospel, representing the unformulated method followed by Berkeley, and in conversation about it I called it "Pragmatism." In December 1877 and January 1878 I set forth the doctrine in the ''Popular Science Monthly'', and the two parts&lt;ref&gt;Peirce refers to "[[s:The Fixation of Belief|The Fixation of Belief]]" and "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]".&lt;/ref&gt; of my essay were printed in French in the ''Revue Philosophique'', volumes vi. and vii. Of course, the doctrine attracted no particular attention, for, as I had remarked in my opening sentence, very few people care for logic. But in 1897 Professor James remodelled the matter, and transmogrified it into a doctrine of philosophy, some parts of which I highly approved, while other and more prominent parts I regarded, and still regard, as opposed to sound logic. About the time Professor Papini discovered, to the delight of the Pragmatist school, that this doctrine was incapable of definition,&lt;ref&gt;See for example "What Pragmatism Is Like", a translation published in October 1907 in ''Popular Science Monthly'' v. 71, pp. 351–8. ''Google Books'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=DKkWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA351 Eprint]. The original Italian: "Introduzione al pragmatismo", ''Leonardo'' series 3, ''anno'' 5, n. 1, February 1907, pp. 26-37, ''Google Books'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=DublAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA26 Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; which would certainly seem to distinguish it from every other doctrine in whatever branch of science, I was coming to the conclusion that my poor little maxim should be called by another name; and accordingly, in April 1905, I renamed it ''Pragmaticism''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Peirce proceeded in "A Neglected Argument" to express both deep satisfaction and deep dismay with his fellow pragmatists. He singled [[F. C. S. Schiller]] out by name and was vague about which among the others he most particularly referred to. Peirce wrote "It seems to me a pity they should allow a philosophy so instinct with life to become infected with seeds of death...."
{|
|-
| vAlign=top | Peirce remained allied with them about:
* the reality of generals and habits, to be understood, as are [[hypostatic abstraction]]s, in terms of potential concrete effects even if unactualized;
* the falsity of necessitarianism;
* the character of consciousness as only "visceral or other external sensation".
| vAlign=top | but was dismayed with their "angry hatred of strict logic" and saw seeds of philosophical death in:
* their view that "truth is mutable";
* their view that infinity is unreal; and
* "such confusions of thought as of active willing (willing to control thought, to doubt, and to weigh reasons) with willing not to exert the will (willing to believe)".
|}
There has been some controversy over Peirce's relation to other pragmatists over the years and over the question of what is owed to Peirce, with visible crests in titles such as literary essayist [[Edward Dahlberg]]'s "Cutpurse Philosopher"&lt;ref&gt;In ''Alms for Oblivion'', University of Minnesota Press, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; about James, in which Dahlberg claimed that Peirce had "tombstone reticences" about making accusations, and Kenneth Laine Ketner's and [[Walker Percy]]'s ''A Thief of Peirce'',&lt;ref&gt;University Press of Mississippi, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; in which Percy described himself as "a thief of Peirce" (page 130). Meanwhile, Schiller, James's wife Alice, and James's son Henry James III believed that James had a habit of overstating his intellectual debts to others such as Peirce.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Gerald E., ''William James: His Life and Thought'', Yale University Press, 2001. See pp. 491-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another manuscript "A Sketch of Logical Critic" dated by the CP editors as 1911,&lt;ref&gt;An excerpt of it appears as "Achilles and the Tortoise" in CP 6.177-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce discussed one of [[Zeno's paradoxes]], that of Achilles and the Tortoise, in terms of James's and others' difficulties with it. Peirce therein expressed regret at having used a "contemptuous" manner about such difficulties in his 1903 Harvard lectures on pragmatism (which James had arranged), and said of James, who had died in August 1910: "Nobody has a better right to testify to the morality of his attitude toward his own thoughts than I, who knew and loved him for forty-nine or fifty years. But owing to his almost unexampled incapacity for mathematical thought, combined with intense hatred for logic — probably for its pedantry, its insistence on minute exactitude — the ''gêne'' of its barbarous formulations, etc. rendered him an easy victim to Zeno and the Achilles....",&lt;ref&gt;From CP 6.182.&lt;/ref&gt; called James "about as perfect a lover of truth as it is possible for a man to be...."&lt;ref&gt;From CP 6.183.&lt;/ref&gt; and said: "In speaking, then, of William James as I do, I am saying the most that I could of any man's intellectual morality; and with him this was but one of a whole diadem of virtues."&lt;ref&gt;From CP 6.184.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3903">'''The preface paradox''', or '''the paradox of the preface''',&lt;ref&gt;Makinson, D. C., ''Paradox of the Preface'', Analysis 25 (1965) 205-207. [http://david.c.makinson.googlepages.com/MakinsonPrefaceParadox1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced by [[David Makinson]] in 1965. Similar to the [[lottery paradox]], it presents an argument according to which it can be rational to accept mutually incompatible beliefs.  While the preface paradox ''nullifies'' a claim contrary to one's belief, it is opposite to [[Moore's paradox]] which ''asserts'' a claim contrary to one's belief.

== Overview ==

The argument runs along these lines:

It is customary for authors of academic books to include in the preface of their books statements such as "any errors that remain are my sole responsibility."  Occasionally they go further and actually claim there are errors in the books, with statements such as "the errors that are found herein are mine alone." 

(1) Such an author has written a book that contains many assertions, and has factually checked each one carefully, submitted it to reviewers for comment, etc.  Thus, he has reason to believe that each assertion he has made is true. 

(2) However, he knows, having learned from experience, that, despite his best efforts, there are very likely undetected errors in his book. So he also has good reason to believe that there is at least one assertion in his book that is not true.

Thus, he has good reason, from (1), to rationally believe that each statement in his book is true, while at the same time he has good reason, from (2), to rationally believe that the book contains at least one error.  Thus he can rationally believe that the book both does and does not contain at least one error.

== Attempted solutions ==

In [[Classical logic|classical]] [[deductive logic]], a set of statements is inconsistent if it contains a contradiction. The paradox then arises from the contradiction of the author's belief that all of the statements in his book are correct (1) with his belief that at least one of them is not correct (2). To resolve the paradox, one can attack either the contradiction between statements (1) and (2), or the inconsistency of their conjunction.

Probabilistic perspective may restate the statements in other terms, thus resolving the paradox by making them non-contradictory.&lt;ref&gt;Lacey, A. R., ''The Paradox of the Preface'', Philos. Sci., 53 (1986), pp. 246–258&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New, C., ''A Note on the Paradox of the Preface'', The Philosophical Quarterly, vol. 28 (1978), pages 341-344&lt;/ref&gt; Even if the author is 99 % sure each single statement in his book is true (1), there can still be so many statements in the book that the aggregate probability of some of them being false (2) is very high as well. Since the principles of [[rational acceptance]] allows the author to accept a very likely statement as true, he may rationally chose to believe in (1). Same principles may make him [[Rationality|rationally believe]] also in (2).

Another way to resolve the paradox is to reject the inconsistency of both (1) and (2) being true at the same time. This is done by rejecting the [[conjunction principle]], i. e. that belief (or rational belief) in various propositions entails a belief (or rational belief) in their conjunction.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, John N..(1987). ''The Preface Paradox Dissolved'', Theoria, 53(2-3), 121-140.&lt;/ref&gt; Most philosophers intuitively believe the principle to be true, but some (e. g.  [[Henry E. Kyburg, Jr.|Kyburg]]) intuitively believe it to be false.&lt;ref&gt;Kyburg, H. E., ''Conjunctivitis'', reprinted in Epistemology and Inference, pp. 232-254. (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to Kyburg's solution to the [[lottery paradox]].

But all past truths are necessary truths. Therefore, it is not possible that the battle will be fought]]
'''Future contingent propositions''' (or simply, '''future contingents''') are statements about states of affairs in the future that are ''[[contingency (philosophy)|contingent]]:'' neither [[necessarily true]] nor necessarily false.

The '''problem of future contingents''' seems to have been first discussed by [[Aristotle]] in chapter 9 of his ''[[On Interpretation]]'' (''De Interpretatione''), using the famous sea-battle example.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothea Frede, The sea-battle reconsidered, ''Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy'' 1985, pp. 31-87.&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly a generation later, [[Diodorus Cronus]] from the [[Megarian school of philosophy]] stated a version of the problem in his notorious ''[[Diodorus Cronus#Master argument|master argument]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=dialectical-school |title=Dialectical School |last=Bobzien |first=Susanne |author-link=Susanne Bobzien}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem was later discussed by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]].

The problem can be expressed as follows. Suppose that a sea-battle will not be fought tomorrow.  Then it was also true yesterday (and the week before, and last year) that it will not be fought, since any true statement about what will be the case in the future was also true in the past.  But all past truths are now necessary truths; therefore it is now necessarily true in the past, prior and up to the original statement "A sea battle will not be fought tomorrow", that the battle will not be fought, and thus the statement that it will be fought is necessarily false.  Therefore, it is not possible that the battle will be fought.  In general, if something will not be the case, it is not possible for it to be the case. "For a man may predict an event ten thousand years beforehand, and another may predict the reverse; that which was truly predicted at the moment in the past will of necessity take place in the fullness of time" (''De Int.'' 18b35).

This conflicts with the idea of our own [[free will|free choice]]: that we have the power to determine or control the course of events in the future, which seems impossible if what happens, or does not happen, is ''necessarily'' going to happen, or not happen.  As Aristotle says, if so there would be no need "to deliberate or to take trouble, on the supposition that if we should adopt a certain course, a certain result would follow, while, if we did not, the result would not follow".

== Aristotle's solution ==

Aristotle solved the problem by asserting that the [[principle of bivalence]] found its [[wikt:exception|exception]] in this paradox of the sea battles: in this specific case, what is impossible is that both alternatives can be possible at the same time: either there ''will'' be a battle, or there won't. Both options can't be simultaneously taken. Today, they are neither true nor false; but if one is true, then the other becomes false. According to Aristotle, it is impossible to say today if the proposition is correct: we must wait for the contingent realization (or not) of the battle, logic realizes itself afterwards:
:''One of the two propositions in such instances must be true and the other false, but we cannot say determinately that this or that is false, but must leave the alternative undecided. One may indeed be more likely to be true than the other, but it cannot be either actually true or actually false. It is therefore plain that it is not necessary that of an affirmation and a denial, one should be true and the other false. For in the case of that which exists potentially, but not actually, the rule which applies to that which exists actually does not hold good.'' ([https://web.archive.org/web/20060614234051/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/interpretation/ §9])

For Diodorus, the future battle was either [[wikt:impossible|impossible]] or [[wikt:necessary|necessary]]. Aristotle added a third term, [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingency]], which saves logic while in the same time leaving place for indetermination in reality. What is necessary is not that there will or that there won't be a battle tomorrow, but the dichotomy itself is necessary:
:''A sea-fight must either take place tomorrow or not, but it is not necessary that it should take place tomorrow, neither is it necessary that it should not take place, yet it is necessary that it either should or should not take place tomorrow. ([[De Interpretatione]]'',  [https://web.archive.org/web/20060614234051/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/interpretation/ 9, 19 a 30.])

Thus, the event always comes in the form of the future, undetermined event; logic always comes afterwards. [[Hegel]] would say the same thing by claiming that wisdom came at dusk. For Aristotle, this is also a practical, [[ethic]]al question: to pretend that the future is determined would have unacceptable consequences for man.

== Leibniz ==

[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] gave another response to the paradox in [https://web.archive.org/web/20050318032746/http://www.anselm.edu/homepage/dbanach/Leibniz-Discourse.htm#VI §6] of ''[[Discourse on Metaphysics]]'': "That God does nothing which is not orderly, and that it is not even possible to conceive of events which are not regular." Thus, even a [[miracle]], the Event by excellence, does not break the regular order of things. What is seen as irregular is only a default of perspective, but does not appear so in relation to universal order. Possibility exceeds human logics. Leibniz encounters this paradox because according to him:
:''Thus the quality of king, which belonged to Alexander the Great, an abstraction from the subject, is not sufficiently determined to constitute an individual, and does not contain the other qualities of the same subject, nor everything which the idea of this prince includes. God, however, seeing the individual concept, or [[haecceity]], of Alexander, sees there at the same time the basis and the reason of all the predicates which can be truly uttered regarding him; for instance that he will conquer Darius and Porus, even to the point of knowing a priori (and not by experience) whether he died a natural death or by poison,- facts which we can learn only through history. When we carefully consider the connection of things we see also the possibility of saying that there was always in the soul of Alexander marks of all that had happened to him and evidences of all that would happen to him and traces even of everything which occurs in the universe, although God alone could recognize them all.'' ([https://web.archive.org/web/20050318032746/http://www.anselm.edu/homepage/dbanach/Leibniz-Discourse.htm#VIII §8])
If everything that happens to Alexander derives from the haecceity of Alexander, then [[fatalism]] threatens Leibniz's construction:
:''We have said that the concept of an individual substance includes once for all everything which can ever happen to it and that in considering this concept one will be able to see everything which can truly be said concerning the individual, just as we are able to see in the nature of a circle all the properties which can be derived from it. But does it not seem that in this way the difference between contingent and necessary truths will be destroyed, that there will be no place for human liberty, and that an absolute fatality will rule as well over all our actions as over all the rest of the events of the world? To this I reply that a distinction must be made between that which is certain and that which is necessary.'' ([https://web.archive.org/web/20050318032746/http://www.anselm.edu/homepage/dbanach/Leibniz-Discourse.htm#VI §13])
Against Aristotle's separation between the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and the [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]], Leibniz states:
:"Thus the content of the subject must always include that of the predicate in such a way that if one understands perfectly the concept of the subject, he will know that the predicate appertains to it also." ([https://web.archive.org/web/20050318032746/http://www.anselm.edu/homepage/dbanach/Leibniz-Discourse.htm#VIII §8])
The predicate (what happens to Alexander) must be completely included in the subject (Alexander) "if one understands perfectly the concept of the subject". Leibniz henceforth distinguishes two types of necessity: necessary necessity and contingent necessity, or universal necessity vs singular necessity. Universal necessity concerns universal truths, while singular necessity concerns something necessary that ''could'' not be (it is thus a "contingent necessity"). Leibniz hereby uses the concept of [[compossible]] worlds. According to Leibniz, contingent acts such as "Caesar crossing the Rubicon" or "Adam eating the apple" are necessary: that is, they are singular necessities, contingents and accidentals, but which concerns the [[principle of sufficient reason]]. Furthermore, this leads Leibniz to conceive of the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] not as a universal, but as a singular: it is true that "Caesar crosses the Rubicon", but it is true only of ''this'' Caesar at this ''time'', not of any dictator nor of Caesar at any time (§8, 9, 13). Thus Leibniz conceives of [[Substance theory|substance]] as plural: there is a plurality of singular substances, which he calls [[Monad (philosophy)|monads]]. Leibniz hence creates a [[concept]] of the [[individual]] as such, and attributes to it events. There is a universal necessity, which is universally applicable, and a singular necessity, which applies to each singular substance, or event. There is one proper noun for each singular event: Leibniz creates a logic of singularity, which Aristotle thought impossible (he considered that there could only be knowledge of generality).

== 20th century ==
One of the early motivations for the study of [[many-valued logic]]s has been precisely this issue. In the early 20th century, the Polish formal logician [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] proposed three truth-values: the true, the false and the ''as-yet-undetermined''. This approach was later developed by  [[Arend Heyting]] and [[L. E. J. Brouwer]];&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Tomassi|title=Logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TUVQr6InyNYC&amp;pg=PA124|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-16696-6|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; see [[Łukasiewicz logic]].

Issues such as this have also been addressed in various [[temporal logic]]s, where one can assert that "''Eventually'', either there will be a sea battle tomorrow, or there won't be." (Which is true if "tomorrow" eventually occurs.)

===The modal fallacy===
{{Main|Modal fallacy}}
By asserting “''A sea-fight must either take place tomorrow or not, but it is not necessary that it should take place tomorrow, neither is it necessary that it should not take place, yet it is necessary that it either should or should not take place tomorrow.''” Aristotle is simply claiming “necessarily (a or not-a)”, which is correct.

However, the next step in Aristotle’s reasoning seems to be {{dubious|date=October 2016}}: “If a is the case, then necessarily, a is the case”. This is known as '''the modal fallacy'''.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Swartz, [https://www.sfu.ca/~swartz/modal_fallacy.htm The Modal Fallacy]&lt;/ref&gt; 


Expressed in another way:
:(i)	If a proposition is true, then it cannot be false.
:(ii)	If a proposition cannot be false, then it is necessarily true.
:(iii)	Therefore if a proposition is true, it is necessarily true.

That is, there are no contingent propositions. Every proposition is either necessarily true or necessarily false.
The fallacy arises in the ambiguity of the first premise. If we interpret it close to the English, we get:

:(iv)	P [[logical consequence|entails]] it is not possible that not-P
:(v)	It is not possible that not-P entails it is necessary that P
:(vi)	Therefore, P entails it is necessary that P

However, if we recognize that the original English expression (i) is potentially misleading, that it assigns a necessity to what is simply nothing more than a necessary condition, then we get instead as our premises:

:(vii)	It is not possible that (P and not P)
:(viii)	(It is not possible that not P) entails (it is necessary that P)

From these latter two premises, one '''cannot''' validly infer the conclusion:

:(ix)    P entails it is necessary that P

The step-by-step mechanism of process thinking is a prominent part of cognitive behavioral thinking, which was developed by psychiatrist [[Aaron Beck]].&lt;ref name="Burke" /&gt; In the 1960s, Beck developed [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|a therapy]] which relies on the idea that thoughts affect feelings, and that good mental habits are systematically built up one step at a time.&lt;ref&gt;Layard, Richard and David M.

Nick Saban formulated process thinking as it pertains to [[American football]] with the help of [[psychiatry]] [[professor]] Lionel Rosen while Saban was the head coach at [[Michigan State University]].&lt;ref name="GQ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Observer"&gt;Holiday, Ryan [http://observer.com/2015/12/heres-the-strategy-elite-athletes-follow-to-perform-at-the-highest-level/ Here’s the Strategy Elite Athletes Follow to Perform at the Highest Level] ''New York Observer''.

Rosen emphasized that the average football play lasts only seven seconds so coaches and players should concentrate only on those seconds, take a rest between plays, then do it all over again.&lt;ref name="Burke" /&gt;

During his time with [[Louisiana State University|LSU]], the [[Miami Dolphins]], and later the [[University of Alabama]], Saban refined this systematic approach and extended it to include all aspects of managing a football program, which he calls "the process."&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Monte [https://www.forbes.com/sites/monteburke/2015/08/04/9-leadership-lessons-from-nick-saban/2/ 9 Leadership Lessons From Nick Saban] ''Forbes''. January 5, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; A key element of Saban's process, often stylized "The Process", is clearly defined expectations for his players not only on the field, but also academically and personally (including a dress code), which are monitored year-round.&lt;ref name="GQ" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Keefe, Brian [http://fortune.com/2012/09/07/leadership-lessons-from-alabama-football-coach-nick-saban/ Leadership lessons from Alabama football coach Nick Saban] ''Fortune''.

'''''Projet de communauté philosophe''''' (translated as '''''Project for a Philosophical Community''''') is a book written by the [[French people|French]] philosopher [[Victor d'Hupay]], published in 1777.

== Review == 
This book can be seen as a cornerstone in the history of [[communism]], as it describes for the first time how "communists" (people living in a "[[commune]]") should understand this philosophy. 
In this work, the author advises to 'share all economic and material products between inhabitants of the "commune", so that all may benefit from everybody's work'.&lt;ref name="Jean-Pierre Cassely, 2016"&gt;Cassely, 2016 : ''Aix insolite et secrète'' JonGlez {{pp.|192-193}} ([http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb45058387v references from the Bibliothèque nationale de France])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Restif de la Bretonne]], a contemporary and friend of d'Hupay, thus describes him as a "communist" in a 1785 publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hupay.fr/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131191812/http://www.hupay.fr/ |archivedate=2017-01-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grandjonc Jacques, 1983"&gt;Grandjonc Jacques,1983: ''Quelques dates à propos des termes communiste et communisme'' In: Mots, n°7, Octobre 1983 {{p.|146}} ([http://www.persee.fr/doc/mots_0243-6450_1983_num_7_1_1122 reference on the Persée library])&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was partly written in d'Hupay's own [[bastide]] in [[Meyreuil]], near [[Aix-en-Provence]], where he was determined to set his own commune and live by the communist philosophy, with neighbours and friends.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hupay.fr/pages/vie-d-hupay.html&lt;/ref&gt;

There is currently only one known public copy of this original edition, which is kept at the Diderot Library in [[Lyon]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcat.org/title/projet-de-communaute-philosophe/oclc/491640865&amp;referer=brief_results&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Representative Men''''' is a collection of seven lectures by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], published as a book of [[essay|essays]] in 1850. The first essay discusses the [[great man theory|role played by "great men" in society]], and the remaining six each extol the virtues of one of six men deemed by Emerson to be great:
* [[Plato]] ("the Philosopher")
* [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] ("the Mystic")
* [[Michel de Montaigne]] ("the Skeptic")
* [[William Shakespeare]] ("the Poet")
* [[Napoleon]] ("the Man of the World")
* [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] ("the Writer")

The '''Society for Women in Philosophy''' was created in 1972 to support and promote women in philosophy. Since that time the Society for Women in Philosophy or "SWIP" has expanded to many branches around the world, including in the US, Canada, Ireland, the UK, the Netherlands, Flanders, and Germany. SWIP organizations worldwide hold meetings and lectures that aim to support women in philosophy; some, such as SWIPshop, focus exclusively on feminist philosophy, while others, such as SWIP-Analytic, focus on women philosophers working in other areas.&lt;ref name="uh.edu"&gt;SWIP Website http://www.uh.edu/~cfreelan/SWIP/hist.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://swipanalytic.commons.gc.cuny.edu/about/ About - SWIP-Analytic Workshop Series&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nyswip.tumblr.com/ New York Society for Women in Philosophy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the founding members of the Society for Women in Philosophy was [[Alison Jaggar]], who was also one of the first people to introduce feminist concerns into philosophy.&lt;ref name=apacsw&gt;{{cite web|last=DeSautels|first=Peggy|title=Alison Jaggar: April 2013|url=http://www.apaonlinecsw.org/home/woman_philosopher/alisonjaggarapril2013|work=Highlighted Philosophers|publisher=American Philosophical Association|accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, one philosopher is named the Distinguished Woman Philosopher of the Year by the Society for Women in Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2013/03/call-for-nominations-distinguished-woman-philosopher-2013-kukla.html Leiter Reports: A Philosophy Blog: Call for Nominations: Distinguished Woman Philosopher 2013 (Kukla)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archive==

Some SWIP archive records were originally housed in the Sophia Smith Collection at the [[Smith College]] library (started in 1982 by Kathy Pyne Parsons Addelson following the 10th anniversary of SWIP). The official SWIP Archive will now be permanently housed in the Feminist Theory Archive, Pembroke Center, [[Brown University]]. The new SWIP home is the product of the efforts of the Feminist Philosophy Archive Project created in June 2013 and ending in July 2014. The main goal of the FPA Project team, composed of philosophers Joan Callahan, Ann Garry, Alison Jaggar, Sandra Harding, Christina Rawls, and Samantha Noll, was to locate and organize the best possible professional archive for over four decades of SWIP records to be preserved. As of December 2014, the American Philosophical Association awarded the Feminist Theory Archive, SWIP, and the FPAP organizing team financial assistance to aid in the processing and preservation of SWIP materials donated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = SWIP Donor Information | url = http://www.brown.edu/research/pembroke-center/archives/feminist-theory-archives/swip-donor-information | publisher = [[Brown University]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==

In the 1980s, while a graduate student at the [[City University of New York Graduate Center]], Mary Ellen Waithe, now professor of philosophy and interim director of Women's Studies at [[Cleveland State University]], "came upon a reference to a work by Aegidius Menagius, Historia Mullierum Philosopharum, published in 1690 and 1692. [Waithe] had never heard of any women philosophers prior to the 20th century with the exceptions of Queen Christina of Sweden, known as Descartes' student, and Hildegard von Bingen, who lived in the 12th century." &lt;ref name="amazon.com"&gt;A History of Women Philosophers: Ancient Women Philosophers 600 B.C. - 500 A.D. https://www.amazon.com/History-Women-Philosophers-Ancient-B-C/dp/9024733685&lt;/ref&gt; After she obtained a copy of this book, she discovered that "many of the women [Menagius] listed as philosophers were astronomers, astrologers, gynecologists, or simply relatives of male philosophers. Nevertheless, the list of women alleged to have been philosophers was impressive." &lt;ref name="amazon.com"/&gt; At this point, she decided to "create a team of experts to collaborate with...I placed a notice in the SWIP (Society for Women in Philosophy) Newsletter and received a half-dozen responses from philosophers".&lt;ref name="amazon.com"/&gt; This collaborative project led to the publication of the four-volume ''A History of Women Philosophers'', published 1987-1995, which includes the following sections:

* Volume 1, ''Ancient Women Philosophers'' (1987) 600 BC-500 AD, Aspasia of Miletus, Diotima of Mantinea, Julia Domna, Makrina, and Hypatia of Alexandria.&lt;ref name="amazon.com"/&gt;

At the 2002 conference for Canadian Society for Women in Philosophy, Dr. [[Nancy Tuana]] asserted the evolutionary theory that the clitoris is unnecessary in reproduction and therefore it has been "historically ignored," mainly because of "a fear of pleasure. It is pleasure separated from reproduction. That's the fear". She reasoned that this fear is the cause of the ignorance that veils female sexuality.&lt;ref name="Cairney"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cairney|first=Richard|title=Exploring female sexuality|publisher=ExpressNews|date=October 21, 2002|accessdate=December 21, 2011|url=http://www.expressnews.ualberta.ca/article.cfm?id=3201|archivedate=December 21, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221175533/http://www.archives.expressnews.ualberta.ca/article/2002/10/3201.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The received view, advanced by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] suggests that [[muscle contraction|muscular contractions]] associated with orgasms pull sperm from the vagina to the [[cervix]], where it is in a better position to reach the egg.

'''Synchronicity''' ({{lang-de|Synchronizität}}) is a concept, first introduced by [[Analytical psychology|analytical psychologist]] [[Carl Jung]], which holds that events are "meaningful coincidences" if they occur with no [[Causality|causal relationship]] yet seem to be meaningfully related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Cosmos and Psyche |last=Tarnas |first=Richard |year= 2006 |publisher=Penguin Group  |location=New York|isbn=0-670-03292-1 |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his career, Jung furnished several different definitions of it.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard D. Beitman (2009) "Coincidence Studies: A Freudian Perspective..."&lt;/ref&gt; Jung defined synchronicity as an "acausal connecting (togetherness) principle," "meaningful coincidence", and "acausal parallelism." He introduced the concept as early as the 1920s but gave a full statement of it only in 1951 in an [[Eranos]] lecture.&lt;ref&gt;Casement, Ann, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0g8chpSOI3AC&amp;printsec=frontcover "Who Owns Jung?"], Karnac Books, 2007. {{ISBN|1-85575-403-7}}. Cf. page 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952 Jung published a paper "Synchronizität als ein Prinzip akausaler Zusammenhänge" (Synchronicity&amp;nbsp;– An Acausal Connecting Principle)&lt;ref name=Synchronicity&gt;{{cite book |author=Jung, Carl G.|title=Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle|year=1993|publisher=Bollingen Foundation|location=Bollingen, Switzerland|origyear=1952 |isbn=978-0-691-01794-5}} Since included in his ''Collected Works'' volume 8.&lt;/ref&gt; in a volume which also contained a related study by the physicist and Nobel laureate [[Wolfgang Pauli]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essex.ac.uk/centres/psycho/publications/RMpapers.htm|title=Religion, Science, and Synchronicity|author=Roderick Main|year=2000|work=Harvest: Journal for Jungian Studies|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208041508/http://www.essex.ac.uk/centres/psycho/publications/RMpapers.htm|archivedate=2006-12-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was sometimes critical of Jung's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Metanexus Institute]] Charlene P. E. Burns (2011) [http://www.metanexus.net/essay/wolfgang-pauli-carl-jung-and-acausal-connecting-principle-case-study-transdisciplinarity Wolfgang Pauli, Carl Jung, and the Acausal Connecting Principle: A Case Study in Transdisciplinarity]&lt;/ref&gt; Jung's belief was that, just as events may be connected by causality, they may also be connected by [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]. Events connected by meaning need not have an explanation in terms of causality, which does not generally contradict the [[Axiom of Causality]].

Jung used the concept in arguing for the existence of the [[paranormal]].&lt;ref name=Roderick /&gt; A believer in the paranormal, [[Arthur Koestler]] wrote extensively on synchronicity in his 1972 book ''[[The Roots of Coincidence]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Koestler, Arthur (1973). ''The Roots of Coincidence''. Vintage. {{ISBN|0-394-71934-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of synchronicity as extending beyond mere coincidence (as well as the paranormal generally) is widely rejected in the academic and scientific community.

==Description==
[[File:Schéma synchronicité in English.png|thumb|400px|Diagram illustrating Carl Jung's concept of synchronicity]]
Jung coined the word "synchronicity" to describe "temporally coincident occurrences of acausal events." In his book ''[[Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle]]'', Jung wrote:&lt;ref name="Jung 1973 8"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jung |first=Carl |edition=first Princeton/Bollingen paperback|date=1973 |title=Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle |page=8|location=Princeton, New Jersey |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-15050-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation| How are we to recognize acausal combinations of events, since it is obviously impossible to examine all chance happenings for their causality? The answer to this is that acausal events may be expected most readily where, on closer reflection, a causal connection appears to be inconceivable.}}

In the introduction to his book, ''Jung on Synchronicity and the Paranormal'', Roderick Main wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Main|first1=Roderick|title=Jung on Synchronicity and the Paranormal|date=1997|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|The culmination of Jung's lifelong engagement with the paranormal is his theory of synchronicity, the view that the structure of reality includes a principle of acausal connection which manifests itself most conspicuously in the form of meaningful coincidences. Difficult, flawed, prone to misrepresentation, this theory none the less remains one of the most suggestive attempts yet made to bring the [[paranormal]] within the bounds of intelligibility.  It has been found relevant by psychotherapists, parapsychologists, researchers of spiritual experience and a growing number of non-specialists. Indeed, Jung's writings in this area form an excellent general introduction to the whole field of the paranormal.}}

In his book ''Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle'', Jung wrote:&lt;ref name="Jung 1973 8"/&gt;
{{quotation|...it is impossible, with our present resources, to explain [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]], or the fact of meaningful coincidence, as a phenomenon of energy. This makes an end of the causal explanation as well, for "effect" cannot be understood as anything except a phenomenon of energy. Therefore it cannot be a question of cause and effect, but of a falling together in time, a kind of simultaneity. Because of this quality of simultaneity, I have picked on the term "synchronicity" to designate a hypothetical factor equal in rank to causality as a principle of explanation.}}

Synchronicity was a principle which, Jung felt, gave conclusive evidence for his concepts of [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]] and the [[collective unconscious]].&lt;ref&gt;Jung defined the collective unconscious as akin to instincts in ''Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious''.&lt;/ref&gt; It described a governing dynamic which underlies the whole of human experience and history — social, emotional, psychological, and spiritual. The emergence of the synchronistic [[paradigm]] was a significant move away from [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualism]] towards an underlying philosophy of [[double-aspect theory]]. Some argue this shift was essential to bringing theoretical coherence to Jung's earlier work.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, R.S. (2014). Evolving Attitudes. ''International Journal of Jungian Studies'', 6.3, 243–253.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In ''Synchronicity'' in the final two pages of the Conclusion, Jung stated that not all coincidences are meaningful and further explained the creative causes of this [[phenomenon]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Even at Jung's presentation of his work on synchronicity in 1951 at an [[Eranos]] lecture, his ideas on synchronicity were evolving.  On Feb. 25, 1953, in a letter to Carl Seelig, the Swiss author and journalist who wrote a biography of Albert Einstein, Jung wrote, "Professor Einstein was my guest on several occasions at dinner. . . These were very early days when Einstein was developing his first theory of relativity [and] It was he who first started me on thinking about a possible relativity of time as well as space, and their psychic conditionality. More than 30 years later the stimulus led to my relation with the physicist professor W. Pauli and to my thesis of psychic synchronicity."&lt;ref name=Synchronicity /&gt; 

Following discussions with both [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Wolfgang Pauli]], Jung believed there were parallels between synchronicity and aspects of [[relativity theory]] and [[quantum mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Igor V. Limar |title=Carl G. Jung’s Synchronicity and Quantum Entanglement: Schrödinger’s Cat ‘Wanders’ Between Chromosomes |url=http://www.neuroquantology.com/index.php/journal/article/view/376  |journal=NeuroQuantology |volume= 09 |page=313 |year=2011 |archiveurl = https://www.academia.edu/1248055/Carl_G._Jung_s_Synchronicity_and_Quantum_Entanglement_Schrodinger_s_Cat_Wanders_Between_Chromosomes |archivedate = 2011-06-30| issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=December 2018}} 

Jung believed life was not a series of random events but rather an expression of a deeper order, which he and Pauli referred to as ''[[Unus mundus]]''. This deeper order led to the insights that a person was both embedded in a universal wholeness and that the realisation of this was more than just an intellectual exercise, but also had elements of a spiritual awakening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Main|first1=Roderick|title=Revelations of Chance: Synchronicity as Spiritual Experience|date=2007|publisher=The State University of New York Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the religious perspective, synchronicity shares similar characteristics of an "intervention of grace". Jung also believed that in a person's life, synchronicity served a role similar to that of dreams, with the purpose of shifting a person's egocentric conscious thinking to greater wholeness.

==Examples==
[[File:Cetonia-aurata.jpg|thumb|''[[Cetonia aurata]]'']]
In his book ''Synchronicity'' Jung tells the following story as an example of a synchronistic event:
{{Quote|text=My example concerns a young woman patient who, in spite of efforts made on both sides, proved to be psychologically inaccessible. The difficulty lay in the fact that she always knew better about everything. Her excellent education had provided her with a weapon ideally suited to this purpose, namely a highly polished Cartesian rationalism with an impeccably "geometrical" idea of reality. After several fruitless attempts to sweeten her rationalism with a somewhat more human understanding, I had to confine myself to the hope that something unexpected and irrational would turn up, something that would burst the intellectual retort into which she had sealed herself. Well, I was sitting opposite her one day, with my back to the window, listening to her flow of rhetoric. She had an impressive dream the night before, in which someone had given her a golden scarab — a costly piece of jewellery. While she was still telling me this dream, I heard something behind me gently tapping on the window. I turned round and saw that it was a fairly large flying insect that was knocking against the window-pane from outside in the obvious effort to get into the dark room. This seemed to me very strange. I opened the window immediately and caught the insect in the air as it flew in. It was a scarabaeid beetle, or common rose-chafer (''Cetonia aurata''), whose gold-green colour most nearly resembles that of a golden scarab. I handed the beetle to my patient with the words, "Here is your scarab." This experience punctured the desired hole in her rationalism and broke the ice of her intellectual resistance. The treatment could now be continued with satisfactory results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jung |first=C.G. |title=Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle|year=1969 |publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey |isbn=978-0-691-15050-5 |pages=109–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The French writer [[Émile Deschamps]] claims in his memoirs that, in 1805, he was treated to some plum pudding by a stranger named Monsieur de Fontgibu. Ten years later, the writer encountered plum pudding on the menu of a Paris restaurant and wanted to order some, but the waiter told him that the last dish had already been served to another customer, who turned out to be de Fontgibu. Many years later, in 1832, Deschamps was at a dinner and once again ordered plum pudding. He recalled the earlier incident and told his friends that only de Fontgibu was missing to make the setting complete – and in the same instant, the now-senile de Fontgibu entered the room, having got the wrong address.&lt;ref&gt;Emile Deschamps, Oeuvres completes : Tomes I–VI, Reimpr. de l'ed. de Paris 1872–74&lt;/ref&gt;

Jung wrote, after describing some examples, "When coincidences pile up in this way, one cannot help being impressed by them – for the greater the number of terms in such a series, or the more unusual its character, the more improbable it becomes."&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung  Jung on Synchronicity and the Paranormal, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wolfgang Pauli young.jpg|left|thumb|Wolfgang Pauli]]In his book ''Thirty Years That Shook Physics – The Story of Quantum Theory'' (1966), George Gamow writes about [[Wolfgang Pauli]], who was apparently considered a person particularly associated with synchronicity events. Gamow whimsically refers to the "[[Pauli effect]]", a mysterious phenomenon which is not understood on a purely materialistic basis, and probably never will be. The following anecdote is told:
{{Quotation|It is well known that theoretical physicists cannot handle experimental equipment; it breaks whenever they touch it. Pauli was such a good theoretical physicist that something usually broke in the lab whenever he merely stepped across the threshold. A mysterious event that did not seem at first to be connected with Pauli's presence once occurred in Professor J. Franck's laboratory in Göttingen. Early one afternoon, without apparent cause, a complicated apparatus for the study of atomic phenomena collapsed. Franck wrote humorously about this to Pauli at his Zürich address and, after some delay, received an answer in an envelope with a Danish stamp. Pauli wrote that he had gone to visit Bohr and at the time of the mishap in Franck's laboratory his train was stopped for a few minutes at the Göttingen railroad station. You may believe this anecdote or not, but there are many other observations concerning the reality of the Pauli Effect! &lt;ref&gt;Thirty Years That Shook Physics – The Story of Quantum Theory, George Gamow, p. 64, Doubleday &amp; Co. Inc. New York, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Relationship with causality==
[[Causality]], when defined expansively (as for instance in the "mystic psychology" book ''[[The Kybalion]]'', or in the [[plato]]nic [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]-style [[Axiom of Causality]]), states that "nothing can happen without being caused." Such an understanding of causality may be incompatible with synchronicity. Other definitions of causality (for example, the [[David Hume#Causation|neo-Humean]] definition) are concerned only with the relation of cause to effect. As such, they are compatible with synchronicity. There are also opinions which hold that, where there is no external observable cause, the cause can be internal.&lt;ref&gt;Psychologies of Mind: The Collected Papers of [[John Maze]], edited by Rachael Henry&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also pointed out that, since Jung took into consideration only the narrow definition of causality – only the [[Four causes#Efficient cause|efficient cause]] – his notion of "''acausality''" is also narrow and so is not applicable to [[Four causes#Final cause|final]] and [[Four causes#Formal cause|formal]] causes as understood in [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] or [[Thomism|Thomist]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;James Arraj (1996) ''The Mystery of Matter: Nonlocality, Morphic Resonance, Synchronicity and the Philosophy of Nature of St. Thomas Aquinas, [http://www.innerexplorations.com/catchmeta/mys8.htm ch. 8. Synchronicity and Formal Causality]''&lt;/ref&gt; The final causality is inherent&lt;ref&gt;Victor Mansfield, (1995), ''Synchronicity, Science and Soul-Making: Understanding Jungian Synchronicity Through Physics, Buddhism, and Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; in synchronicity (because it leads to [[individuation]]) or synchronicity can be a kind of replacement for final causality; however, such [[finalism]] or [[teleology]] is considered to be outside the domain of modern science.

==Explanations==

===Religion===

Many people believe that the Universe or God causes synchronicities. Among the general public, divine intervention is the most widely accepted explanation for meaningful coincidences.&lt;ref name=Roderick&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rushnell|first1=S.|title=When God winks|date=2006|publisher=Atria Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Mathematics===

Jung and his followers (e.g., Marie-Louise von Franz) share in common the belief that numbers are the archetypes of order, and the major participants in synchronicity creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Number and Time: Reflections Leading toward a Unification of Depth Psychology and Physics. |last=Von Franz |first=M.L. |year= 1974 |publisher=Northwestern University Press|}}&lt;/ref&gt;This hypothesis has implications that are relevant to some of the “chaotic” phenomena in nonlinear dynamics. [[Dynamical systems theory]] has provided a new context from which to speculate about synchronicity because it gives predictions about the transitions between emergent states of order and nonlocality.&lt;ref&gt;Hogenson, G. B. (2005). The self, the symbolic and synchronicity: Virtual realities and the emergence of the psyche. ''Journal of Analytical Psychology'', 50, 271–284. https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0021-8774.2005.00531.x&lt;/ref&gt; This view, however, is not part of mainstream mathematical thought.

===Quantum Physics===

According to a certain view, synchronicity serves as a way of making sense of or describing some aspects of quantum mechanics. It argues that quantum experiments demonstrate that, at least in the microworld of subatomic particles, there is an instantaneous connection between particles no matter how far away they are from one another. Known as quantum non-locality or [[Quantum_entanglement|entanglement]], the proponents of this view argue that this points to a unified field that precedes physical reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Mind, Matter and Quantum Mechanics.|last=Stapp |first=H.P. |year= 2015 |publisher=Springer Verlag  |location=Berlin, Heidelberg|}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with archetypal reasoning, the proponents argue that two events can correspond to each other (e.g. particle with particle, or person with person) in a meaningful way. 

Synchronicity can also be seen in [[David Bohm]]'s theory of [[implicate order]]. According to Bohm's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Wholeness and the implicate order.|last=Bohm |first=David |year= 1980 |publisher=Routledge   |location=London, UK|}}&lt;/ref&gt; theory, there are three major realms of existence: the explicate (unfolded) order, the implicate (enfolded) order, and a source or ground beyond both. The flowing movement of the whole can thus be understood as a process of continuous enfolding and unfolding of order or structure. From moment to moment there is a rhythmic pulse between implicate and explicate realities. Therefore, synchronicity would literally take place as the bridge between implicate and explicate orders, whose complementary nature define the undivided totality.

===Probability theory===

Mainstream mathematics argues that statistics and probability theory (exemplified in, e.g., [[Littlewood's law]] or the [[law of truly large numbers]]) suffice to explain any purported synchronistic events as mere [[coincidence]]s.&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;John Navin, interview with [[David Hand (statistician)|David Hand]], (2014), [https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnnavin/2014/02/18/why-coincidences-miracles-and-rare-events-happen-every-day/3/ Why Coincidences, Miracles And Rare Events Happen Every Day], [[Forbes]].com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Lane &amp; Andrea Diem Lane, 2010, [http://www.integralworld.net/lane15.html DESULTORY DECUSSATION Where Littlewood’s Law of Miracles meets Jung’s Synchronicity], www.integralworld.net&lt;/ref&gt; The law of large numbers, for instance, states that in large enough populations, any strange event is arbitrarily likely to happen by mere chance. However, some proponents of synchronicity question whether it is even sensible in principle to try to evaluate synchronicity statistically. Jung himself and von Franz argued that statistics work precisely by ignoring what is unique about the individual case, whereas synchronicity tries to investigate that uniqueness.  

Among some psychologists, Jung's works, such as ''The Interpretation of Nature and the Psyche'', were received as problematic. Fritz Levi, in his 1952 review in ''Neue Schweizer Rundschau'' (New Swiss Observations), critiqued Jung's theory of synchronicity as vague in determinability of synchronistic events, saying that Jung never specifically explained his rejection of "magic causality" to which such an acausal principle as synchronicity would be related. He also questioned the theory's usefulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Bishop|first = Paul|title = Synchronicity and Intellectual Intuition in Kant, Swedenborg, and Jung| publisher = The Edwin Mellen Press
|year = 2000| pages = 59–62| isbn = 0-7734-7593-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychology===

In [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]], [[confirmation bias]] is a tendency to search for or interpret new information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions, and avoids information and interpretations that contradict prior beliefs. It is a type of [[cognitive bias]] and represents an error of [[inductive inference]], or is a form of [[selection bias]] toward confirmation of the hypothesis under study, or disconfirmation of an alternative hypothesis. Confirmation bias is of interest in the teaching of [[critical thinking]], as the skill is misused if rigorous critical scrutiny is applied only to evidence that challenges a preconceived idea, but not to evidence that supports it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/timvangelder/publications-1/heads-i-win-tails-you-lose-desire-s-hold-over-reason/HeadsIWin.pdf Tim van Gelder, "Heads I win, tails you lose": A Foray Into the Psychology of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, in psychology and sociology, the term [[apophenia]] is used for the mistaken detection of a pattern or meaning in random or meaningless data.&lt;ref&gt;Brugger, Peter. "From Haunted Brain to Haunted Science: A Cognitive Neuroscience View of Paranormal and Pseudoscientific Thought", ''Hauntings and Poltergeists: Multidisciplinary Perspectives'', edited by J. Houran and R. Lange (North Carolina: [[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland &amp; Company, Inc. Publishers]], 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Skeptics, such as Robert Todd Carroll of the Skeptic's Dictionary, argue that the perception of synchronicity is better explained as apophenia. Primates use pattern detection in their form of intelligence,&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03201828 Pattern recognition of behavioral events in the nonhuman primate]&lt;/ref&gt; and this can lead to erroneous identification of non-existent patterns. A famous example of this is the fact that human face recognition is so robust, and based on such a basic archetype (essentially two dots and a line contained in a circle), that human beings are very prone to identify faces in random data all through their environment, like the "man in the moon", or faces in wood grain, an example of the visual form of apophenia known as [[pareidolia]].&lt;ref name="faces"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/13/health/psychology/13face.html|title=Facial Recognition – Brain – Faces, Faces Everywhere|publisher=New York Times|first=Elizabeth | last=Svoboda | date= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[Charles Tart]] sees danger in synchronistic thinking: 'This danger is the temptation to mental laziness. [...] it would be very tempting to say, "Well, it's synchronistic, it's forever beyond my understanding," and so (prematurely) give up trying to find a causal explanation.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Tart]],  [http://www.roma1.infn.it/rog/group/frasca/b/synchtart.html Causality and Synchronicity – Steps Toward Clarification], (1981), [[Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research]], vol. 75, pp. 121–141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anyway, synchronicity cannot be attained to by mere intellectual means. It is an autonomous phenomenon that is not invented by the intellect, but rather, experienced. synchronicity is a self produced image spontaneously blossoming from the psyche as a whole that simultaneously reflects and effects what is going on within the very psyche that produced it. It has also been argued that [[Analytical psychology|Jungian psychology's]] theory of synchronicity is equivalent to intellectual [[Intuition (psychology)|intuition]].&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, pp. 17–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>Hansen, Chad. (1983). (see above). There are no articles in Chinese, so the nouns must be read as collectives, mass nouns or plurals. The argument is about the use of terms hence belongs to the school of names. It is not about the color of horses.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13196">'''When A White Horse Is Not A Horse''' ({{zh|c=白馬非馬|p=''Báimǎ fēi mǎ''|w=''Pai-ma fei ma''|l=white horse not horse}}), also known as the '''White Horse Dialogue''' ({{zh|c=白馬論|p=''Báimǎ Lùn''|w=''Pai-ma Lun''|l=white horse discourse}}), is a famous paradox in [[Chinese philosophy]]. [[Gongsun Long]] wrote this circa 300 BC dialectic analysis of the question 'Is "white horse not horse" permissibly assertible?'.

==The original text==
[[File:Cabalo044eue.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Is it a horse?]]
The White Horse Dialogue (''Baima Lun'') constitutes chapter 2 of the [[eponymous]] ''Gongsun Longzi'' "Master Gongsun Long", who was counted among the "[[School of Names]]" (aka "Logicians" or "Dialecticians") in the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]]. Most of Gongsun's writings have been lost and the received ''Gongsun Longzi'' text only contains 6 of the supposedly 14 original chapters. Parts of the text are dislocated and some commentators and translators rearrange them for clarity. The dialogue is between two unnamed speakers.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Is "{{zh|c=白馬非馬|p=''Báimǎ fēi mǎ''|l=white horse not horse}}" assertible?&lt;br /&gt;

Advocate: It is.&lt;br /&gt;

Objector: How?&lt;br /&gt;

Advocate: "Horse" is that by means of which one names the shape. "White" is that by means of which one names the color. What names the color is not what names the shape. Hence, one may "white horse not horse."&lt;br /&gt;

Objector: If there are white horses, one cannot say that there are no horses. If one cannot say that there are no horses, doesn't that mean that there are horses? For there to be white horses is for there to be horses. How could it be that the white ones are not horses?&lt;br /&gt;

Advocate: If one wants horses, that extends to yellow or black horses. But if one wants white horses, that does not extend to a yellow or black horses. Suppose that white horses were horses. Then what one wants [in the two cases] would be the same. If what one wants were the same, then 'white' would not differ from 'horse.' If what one wants does not differ, then how is it that yellow or black horses are acceptable in one case and unacceptable in the other case? It is clear that acceptable and unacceptable are mutually contrary. Hence, yellow and black horses are the same, one can respond that there are horses, but one cannot respond that there are white horses. Thus, it is evident that white horses are not horses.&lt;ref name="readings"&gt;[[Gongsun Long]]zi. (2005). {{Google books|5PL9hSUiVEoC|''Readings in Classical Chinese Philosophy,'' pp. 364–365|page=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This dialogue continues with deliberations over colored and colorless horses and whether "white" and "horse" can be separated from "white horse".

Other ''Gongsun longzi'' chapters discuss ''Baima''-related concepts of ''jian'' [[Wikt:堅|堅]] "hard; hardness" and ''bai'' [[Wikt:白|白]] "white; whiteness", ''ming'' [[Wikt:名|名]] "name; term" and ''shi'' [[Wikt:實|實]] "solid; true, actual; fact, reality", and abstract ''zhi'' [[Wikt:指|指]] "finger; pointing; designation; [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]]" like "whiteness" and concrete ''wu'' [[Wikt:物|物]] "thing; object; [[particular]]" like a "white horse".

==Difficulties of interpretation==
The Chinese of "a white horse is not a horse" is ''bai ma fei ma'' 白馬非馬, whose meaning hinges upon the [[Negation (rhetoric)|negative]] ''fei'' [[Wikt:非|非]] "not, is not; no, negative; oppose; wrong". The Classical construction "A ''fei'' B" "A非B" can ambiguously mean either "A is not a member of the class B" or "A is not identical to B".&lt;ref name="Graham-studies334"&gt;Graham, Angus Charles. (1990). {{google books|TD43k809CT8C|''Studies in Chinese Philosophy and Philosophical Literature,'' p. 334.|page=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interpreting this [[equivocation]] fallacy, [[A.C. Graham]] says this "white horse" vs. "horse" paradox plays upon the ambiguity of whether "is" means:
# "Is a member of the [[Class (philosophy)|class]] (x)"
# "Is identical to  (x)"&lt;ref name="Graham-studies334"/&gt;

In other words, the expression "a white horse is not a horse" is ambiguous between "a white horse is not identical with a horse" (true, because "white horse" is more specific than "horse"), and "a white horse is not a member of the set of horses" (obviously false). The Advocate in the dialogue is asserting that "a white horse is not [identical with] a horse," while the Objector is interpreting the Advocate's statement as "a white horse is not [a member of the group of] horses."

An illustration of the alternative uses of "fei" may be found in the widely known "Happiness of Fish" dialogue in ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' (17, tr. Watson 1968:188-9). Huizi says "You're not a fish [子非魚] &amp;mdash; how do you know what fish enjoy?" (denying that Zhuangzi is a member of the class of fish) and Zhuangzi replies "You're not I [子非我], so how do you know I don't know what fish enjoy?" (denying that the individuals Huizi and Zhuangzi are identical).

Beyond the inherent semantic ambiguities of ''Baima fei ma'', the first line obscurely asks ''ke hu'' [[Wikt:可|可]][[Wikt:乎|乎]] "Can it be that …?". This dialogue could be an attempted proof that a white horse is not a horse, or a question if such a statement is possible, or both. [[Bryan W. Van Norden]] suggests that "the Advocate is only arguing that 'a white horse is not a horse' ''could'' be true, given a certain interpretation. He might acknowledge that, in another interpretation, 'a white horse ''is'' a horse.' "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Norden|first1=Bryan|title=Introduction to Classical Chinese Philosophy|date=2011|publisher=Hackett Publishing Company|location=Indianapolis|isbn=9781603844680|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative interpretation is offered in [[Feng Youlan]]'s ''History of Chinese Philosophy ''(translated in 1952 by [[Derk Bodde]]):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Strictly speaking, names or terms are divided into those that are abstract and those that are concrete. The abstract term denotes the universal, the concrete term the particular. The particular is the denotation, and the universal the connotation, of the term. In western inflected languages there is no difficulty in distinguishing between the particular ('white' or 'horse') and the abstract ('whiteness' or 'horseness'). In Chinese, however, owing to the fact that the written characters are ideographic and pictorial and lack all inflection, there is no possible way, as far as the form of individual words is concerned, of distinguishing between abstract and concrete terms. Thus in Chinese the word designating a particular horse and that designating the universal, 'horseness,' are written and pronounced in the same way. Similarly with other terms, so that such words as 'horse' and 'white', being used to designate both the concrete particular and the abstract universal, thus hold two values.&lt;ref&gt;Fung Yu-lan. (1953). ''A History of Chinese Philosophy,'' p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, there are no contemporary histories of Chinese philosophy that subscribe to [[Feng Youlan]]'s interpretation. Other philosophers and sinologists who have analyzed the dialogue include Graham,&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Angus Charles. (1989). ''Disputers of the Tao: Philosophical Argument in Ancient China,'' pp.75-95;  Graham, (1990). {{Google books|TD43k809CT8C|''Studies,'' pp. 125–216.|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hansen,&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Chad. 1976. "Mass Nouns and 'A White Horse Is Not a Horse'", ''[[Philosophy East and West]],'' 26.2:189-209; Hansen, Chad. (1983). ''Language and Logic in Ancient China,'' p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Harbsmeier,&lt;ref&gt;Harbsmeier, Christoph. (1998). "Language and Logic in Traditional China". Volume 7, Part I of ''Science and Civilisation in China,'' pp. 298–321.&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson,&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Kirill Ole. 1995. "When a 'White Horse' Is Not a 'Horse'", ''Philosophy East and West'' 45.4:481-499.&lt;/ref&gt; and Van Norden.&lt;ref name="readings"/&gt;

==Historic influence==
In the Chinese philosophical tradition, the ''Baima Lun'''s significance is evident from how many [[Chinese classic texts]] directly or indirectly discuss it. The ''[[Liezi]]'', which lists and criticizes the paradoxes of Gongsun Long as "perversions of reason and sense", explains "'A white horse is not a horse', because the name diverges from the shape."&lt;ref name="Graham-studies80"&gt;Graham, {{Google books|TD43k809CT8C|p. 80.|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' chapters (17 and 33) mock Gongsun Long, and another (2) combines his ''zhi'' 指 "attribute" and ''ma'' 馬 "horse" notions in the same context.
&lt;blockquote&gt;To use an attribute to show that attributes are not attributes is not as good as using a nonattribute to show that attributes are not attributes. To use a horse to show that a horse is not a horse is not as good as using a non-horse to show that a horse is not a horse, Heaven and earth are one attribute; the ten thousand things are one horse.&lt;ref&gt;Zhuangzi. (2003). {{Google books|IKLsWSbCAWQC|''Zhuangzi: basic writings,'' p. 35.|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Mengzi'' (6A4) notes that ''bai'' 白 "white" has different connotations whether we are using it to refer to a graying person (who is worthy of respect because of his age) or a white horse (which should be treated like any other animal):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Mencius said, 'There is no difference between our pronouncing a white horse to be white and our pronouncing a white man to be white. But is there no difference between the regard with which we acknowledge the age of an old horse and that with which we acknowledge the age of an old man? And what is it which is called righteousness? The fact of a man's being old? Or the fact of our giving honour to his age?'&lt;ref&gt;Legge, James. (1895). {{Google books|4L0TAAAAYAAJ|''The Chinese Classics: a Translation;'' Part 2, ''The Works of Mencius,'' p. 398.|page=398}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Other early "A white horse is not a horse" references are found in the ''[[Hanfeizi]]'' (32), ''[[Mozi]]'' (11B), and ''[[Zhanguoce]]'' (4).
