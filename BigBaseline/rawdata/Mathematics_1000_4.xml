An '''actuary''' is a business professional who deals with the measurement and management of [[risk]] and uncertainty {{harv|BeAnActuary|2011a}}. The name of the corresponding field is [[actuarial science]]. These risks can affect both sides of the [[balance sheet]] and require [[investment management|asset management]], [[liability (financial accounting)|liability]] management, and valuation skills {{harv|BeAnActuary|2011b}}. Actuaries provide assessments of financial security systems, with a focus on their complexity, their mathematics, and their mechanisms {{harv|Trowbridge|1989|p=7}}.

While the concept of insurance dates to antiquity ({{harvnb|Johnston|1903|loc=§475–§476}}, {{harvnb|Loan|1992}}, {{harvnb|Lewin|2007|loc=pp. 3–4}}), the concepts needed to scientifically measure and mitigate risks have their origins in the 17th century studies of probability and annuities {{harv|Heywood|1985}}. Actuaries of the 21st century require analytical skills, business knowledge, and an understanding of human behavior and information systems to design and manage programs that control risk {{harv|BeAnActuary|2011c}}. The [[Actuarial credentialing and exams|actual steps]] needed to become an actuary are usually country-specific; however, almost all processes share a rigorous schooling or examination structure and take many years to complete ({{harvnb|Feldblum|2001|p=6}}, {{harvnb|Institute and Faculty of Actuaries|2014}}).

The profession has consistently been ranked as one of the most desirable {{harv|Riley|2013}}. In various studies, being an actuary was ranked number one or two multiple times since 2010 ({{harvnb|Thomas|2012}}, {{harvnb|Weber|2013}}, {{harvnb|CareerCast|2015}}).

==Responsibilities==
&lt;!-- BLS 2015(all tabs) and GAD 2015 for UK blurb: start --&gt;Actuaries use skills primarily in mathematics, particularly [[calculus]]-based [[probability]] and [[mathematical statistics]], but also [[economics]], [[computer science]], finance, and business. For this reason, actuaries are essential to the insurance and reinsurance industries, either as staff employees or as consultants; to other businesses, including sponsors of pension plans; and to government agencies such as the [[Government Actuary's Department]] in the United Kingdom or the [[Social Security Administration]] in the United States of America. Actuaries assemble and analyze data to estimate the probability and likely cost of the occurrence of an event such as death, sickness, injury, disability, or loss of property. Actuaries also address financial questions, including those involving the level of pension contributions required to produce a certain retirement income and the way in which a company should invest resources to maximize its return on investments in light of potential risk. Using their broad knowledge, actuaries help design and price insurance policies, pension plans, and other financial strategies in a manner that will help ensure that the plans are maintained on a sound financial basis ({{harvnb|Bureau of Labor Statistics|2015}}, {{harvnb|Government Actuary's Department|2015}})&lt;!-- BLS 2015(all tabs) and GAD 2015 for UK blurb: end --&gt;.

===Disciplines===
Most traditional actuarial disciplines fall into two main categories: life and non-life.

Life actuaries, which include health and [[pension]] actuaries, primarily deal with [[Mortality rate|mortality]] risk, [[morbidity]] risk, and investment risk. Products prominent in their work include [[life insurance]], [[Life annuity|annuities]], pensions, short and long term [[disability insurance]], health insurance, [[health savings account]]s, and [[long-term care]] insurance {{harv|Bureau of Labor Statistics|2015}}. In addition to these risks, social insurance programs are influenced by public opinion, politics, budget constraints, changing [[demographics]], and other factors such as [[medical technology]], [[inflation]], and [[Cost-of-living index|cost of living]] considerations ({{harvnb|GAO|1980}}, {{harvnb|GAO|2008}}).

&lt;!-- Sourced to AIA: start--&gt;Non-life actuaries, also known as property and casualty or general insurance actuaries, deal with both physical and legal risks that affect people or their property. Products prominent in their work include [[auto insurance]], [[home insurance|homeowners insurance]], commercial property insurance, [[workers' compensation]], [[malpractice]] insurance, [[Product liability|product liability insurance]], [[marine insurance]], [[terrorism insurance]], and other types of [[liability insurance]] {{harv|AIA|2014}}&lt;!-- Sourced to AIA: end--&gt;.

Actuaries are also called upon for their expertise in [[enterprise risk management]] {{harv|Bureau of Labor Statistics|2015}}. This can involve [[dynamic financial analysis]], [[stress testing#Financial sector|stress testing]], the formulation of corporate risk policy, and the setting up and running of corporate risk departments {{harv|Institute and Faculty of Actuaries|2011b}}. Actuaries are also involved in other areas of the [[financial services]] industry, such as analysing [[securities offering]]s or [[market research]] {{harv|Bureau of Labor Statistics|2015}}.

===Traditional employment===
On both the life and casualty sides, the classical function of actuaries is to calculate premiums and [[Insurance#Indemnification|reserves]] for insurance policies covering various risks {{harv|Institute and Faculty of Actuaries|2014|pp. = 12–14}}. On the casualty side, this analysis often involves quantifying the probability of a loss event, called the frequency, and the size of that loss event, called the severity. The amount of time that occurs before the loss event is important, as the insurer will not have to pay anything until after the event has occurred. On the life side, the analysis often involves quantifying how much a potential sum of money or a financial liability will be worth at different points in the future. Since neither of these kinds of analysis are purely deterministic processes, stochastic models are often used to determine frequency and severity [[frequency distribution|distributions]] and the [[parameter]]s of these distributions. Forecasting interest yields and currency movements also plays a role in determining future costs, especially on the life side {{harv|Tolley|Hickman|Lew|2012}}.

Actuaries do not always attempt to predict aggregate future events. Often, their work may relate to determining the cost of financial liabilities that have already occurred, called [[Retrocession (Insurance)|retrospective reinsurance]], or the development or re-pricing of new products.

Actuaries also design and maintain products and systems. They are involved in financial reporting of companies' assets and liabilities. They must communicate complex concepts to clients who may not share their language or depth of knowledge. Actuaries work under a code of ethics that covers their communications and work products {{harv|ASB|2013}}.

===Non-traditional employment===
As an outgrowth of their more traditional roles, actuaries also work in the fields of risk management and [[enterprise risk management]] for both financial and non-financial corporations {{harv|D'Arcy|2005}}. Actuaries in traditional roles study and use the tools and data previously in the domain of finance {{harv|Feldblum|2001|p=8}}. The [[Basel II]] accord for financial institutions (2004), and its analogue, the [[Solvency II]] accord for insurance companies (to come into effect in 2016), require institutions to account for [[operational risk]] separately, and in addition to, [[credit risk|credit]], [[Actuarial reserves|reserve]], [[asset]], and [[insolvency]] risk. Actuarial skills are well suited to this environment because of their training in analyzing various forms of risk, and judging the potential for upside gain, as well as downside loss associated with these forms of risk {{harv|D'Arcy|2005}}.

&lt;!-- First two are from Mungan, last two are from Stefan --&gt;Actuaries are also involved in [[investment]] advice and [[asset management]], and can be general business managers and [[chief financial officer]]s&amp;nbsp;({{harvnb|Mungan|2002}}, {{harvnb|Stefan|2010}}). They analyze business prospects with their financial skills in valuing or discounting risky future cash flows, and apply their pricing expertise from insurance to other lines of business. For example, insurance [[securitization]] requires both actuarial and finance skills {{harv|Krutov|2006}}. Actuaries also act as [[expert witness]]es by applying their analysis in court trials to estimate the economic value of losses such as lost profits or lost wages {{harv|Wagner|2006}}.

==History==
[[File:Nathaniel Bowditch (1773-1838), American mathematician and actuary.jpeg|thumb|right|alt=A black and white picture of Nathaniel Bowditch, an eighteenth century American actuary|Mathematician [[Nathaniel Bowditch]] was one of America's first insurance actuaries.]]

===Need for insurance===
The basic requirements of communal interests gave rise to risk sharing since the dawn of civilization. For example, people who lived their entire lives in a camp had the risk of fire, which would leave their band or family without shelter. After [[barter (economics)|barter]] came into existence, more complex risks emerged and new forms of risk manifested. Merchants embarking on trade journeys bore the risk of losing goods entrusted to them, their own possessions, or even their lives. Intermediaries developed to warehouse and trade goods, which exposed them to [[financial risk]]. The primary providers in extended families or households ran the risk of premature death, disability or infirmity, which could leave their dependents to starve. [[Credit (finance)|Credit]] procurement was difficult if the creditor worried about repayment in the event of the borrower's death or infirmity. Alternatively, people sometimes lived too long from a financial perspective, exhausting their savings, if any, or becoming a burden on others in the extended family or society {{harv|Lewin|2007|p=3}}.

===Early attempts===
In the ancient world there was not always room for the sick, suffering, disabled, aged, or the poor—these were often not part of the [[Collective consciousness|cultural consciousness]] of societies {{harv|Perkins|1995}}. Early methods of protection, aside from the normal support of the extended family, involved charity; religious organizations or neighbors would collect for the destitute and needy. By the middle of the 3rd century, 1,500 suffering people were being supported by charitable operations in [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] {{harv|Perkins|1995}}. Charitable protection remains an active form of support in the modern era {{harv|GivingUSA|2009}}, but receiving charity is uncertain and is often accompanied by [[social stigma]]. Elementary [[mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]] agreements and pensions did arise in antiquity {{harv|Thucydides}}. Early in the [[Roman Empire|Roman empire]], associations were formed to meet the expenses of burial, cremation, and monuments—precursors to [[Burial society|burial insurance]] and [[Friendly society|friendly societies]]. A small sum was paid into a communal fund on a weekly basis, and upon the death of a member, the fund would cover the expenses of rites and burial. These societies sometimes sold shares in the building of [[Columbarium|columbāria]], or burial vaults, owned by the fund {{harv|Johnston|1903|loc=§475–§476}}. Other early examples of mutual [[surety]] and [[Life insurance|assurance]] pacts can be traced back to various forms of fellowship within the Saxon clans of England and their Germanic forebears, and to Celtic society {{harv|Loan|1992}}.

Non-life insurance started as a hedge against loss of cargo during sea travel. Anecdotal reports of such guarantees occur in the writings of [[Demosthenes]], who lived in the 4th century BCE {{harv|Lewin|2007|pp=3–4}}. The earliest records of an official non-life insurance policy come from [[Sicily]], where there is record of a 14th-century contract to insure a shipment of wheat {{harv|Sweeting|2011|p=14}}. In 1350, Lenardo Cattaneo assumed "all risks from act of God, or of man, and from perils of the sea" that may occur to a shipment of wheat from Sicily to Tunis up to a maximum of 300 [[Florin (Italian coin)|florin]]s. For this he was paid a premium of 18% {{harv|Lewin|2007|p=4}}.

===Development of theory===
[[File:Excerpt from CDC 2003 Table 1.pdf|thumb|right|alt=A table of numbers; the first page of the U.S. 2003 mortality table.|2003 U.S. mortality ([[life table|life]]) table, Table 1, Page 1]]
&lt;!-- Sourced to Heywood: start --&gt;During the 17th century, a more scientific basis for [[risk management]] was being developed. In 1662, a London [[draper]] named [[John Graunt]] showed that there were predictable patterns of longevity and death in a defined group, or [[Cohort (statistics)|cohort]], of people, despite the uncertainty about the future longevity or mortality of any one individual. This study became the basis for the original [[life table]]. Combining this idea with that of [[compound interest]] and [[annuity]] valuation, it became possible to set up an insurance scheme to provide life insurance or pensions for a group of people, and to calculate with some degree of accuracy each member's necessary contributions to a common fund, assuming a fixed rate of interest. The first person to correctly calculate these values was [[Edmond Halley]] {{harv|Heywood|1985}}&lt;!-- Sourced to Heywood: end --&gt;. In his work, Halley demonstrated a method of using his life table to calculate the premium someone of a given age should pay to purchase a life-annuity {{harv|Halley|1693}}.

===Early actuaries===
&lt;!-- Ogborn 1956 p. 235: start --&gt;[[James Dodson (mathematician)|James Dodson]]'s pioneering work on the [[Whole life insurance#Level premium system|level premium system]] led to the formation of the Society for Equitable Assurances on Lives and Survivorship (now commonly known as [[The Equitable Life Assurance Society|Equitable Life]]) in London in 1762. This was the first life insurance company to use premium rates that were calculated scientifically for long-term life policies, using Dodson's work. After Dodson's death in 1757, [[Edward Rowe Mores]] took over the leadership of the group that eventually became the Society for Equitable Assurances. It was he who specified that the chief official should be called an ''actuary'' {{harv|Ogborn|1956|p=235}}&lt;!-- Ogborn 1956 p. 235: end --&gt;. Previously, the use of the term had been restricted to an official who recorded the decisions, or ''acts'', of ecclesiastical courts, in ancient times originally the secretary of the [[Roman senate]], responsible for compiling the ''[[Acta Senatus]]'' {{harv|Ogborn|1956|p=233}}. Other companies that did not originally use such mathematical and scientific methods most often failed or were forced to adopt the methods pioneered by Equitable {{harv|Bühlmann|1997|p=166}}.

===Development of the modern profession===
{{main|Actuarial science}}
[[File:Alliance for Health Reform briefing on the individual health insurance market (34370998252).jpg|thumb|upright|Actuary speaking at a health care event]]
In the 18th and 19th centuries, computational complexity was limited to manual calculations. The actual calculations required to compute fair insurance premiums are complex. The actuaries of that time developed methods to construct easily used tables, using sophisticated approximations called [[Actuarial science#Technological advances|commutation function]]s, to facilitate timely, accurate, manual calculations of premiums {{harv|Slud|2006}}. Over time, actuarial organizations were founded to support and further both actuaries and actuarial science, and to protect the public interest by ensuring competency and ethical standards {{harv|Hickman|2004|p=4}}. Since calculations were cumbersome, actuarial shortcuts were commonplace.

Non-life actuaries followed in the footsteps of their life compatriots in the early 20th century. In the United States, the 1920 revision to workers' compensation rates took over two months of around-the-clock work by day and night teams of actuaries {{harv|Michelbacher|1920|pp=224, 230}}. In the 1930s and 1940s, rigorous mathematical foundations for [[stochastic process]]es were developed {{harv|Bühlmann|1997|p=168}}. Actuaries began to forecast losses using models of random events instead of [[Deterministic system|deterministic methods]]. Computers further revolutionized the actuarial profession. From pencil-and-paper to punchcards to microcomputers, the modeling and forecasting ability of the actuary has grown exponentially {{harv|MacGinnitie|1980|pp=50–51}}.

Another modern development is the convergence of modern [[finance theory|financial theory]] with actuarial science {{harv|Bühlmann|1997|pp=169–171}}. In the early 20th century, actuaries were developing techniques that can be found in modern financial theory, but for various historical reasons, these developments did not achieve much recognition {{harv|Whelan|2002}}. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a distinct effort for actuaries to combine financial theory and stochastic methods into their established models {{harv|D'Arcy|1989}}. In the 21st century, the profession, both in practice and in the educational syllabi of many actuarial organizations, combines tables, loss models, stochastic methods, and financial theory {{harv|Feldblum|2001|pp=8–9}}, but is still not completely aligned with modern [[financial economics]] {{harv|Bader|Gold|2003}}.

==Remuneration and ranking==
As there are relatively few actuaries in the world compared to other professions, actuaries are in high demand, and are highly paid for the services they render ({{harvnb|Hennessy|2003}}, {{harvnb|Kurtz|2013}}). {{As of|2016}}, in the United States, newly credentialed actuaries on average earn around $100,000 per year, while more experienced actuaries can earn over $150,000 per year {{harv|Ezra Penland|2016}}. Similarly, {{as of|2014|alt=a 2014}} survey in the United Kingdom indicated a starting salary for a newly credentialed actuary of about [[Pound sterling|£]]50,000; actuaries with more experience can earn well in excess of £100,000 {{harv|Crail|2014}}.

&lt;!-- Following all sourced to Riley --&gt;The actuarial profession has been consistently ranked for decades as one of the most desirable. Actuaries work comparatively reasonable hours, in comfortable conditions, without the need for physical exertion that may lead to injury, are well paid, and the profession consistently has a good hiring outlook {{harv|Riley|2013}}.&lt;!-- End sourcing to Riley --&gt; Not only has the overall profession ranked highly, but it also is considered one of the best professions for women {{harv|Shavin|2014}}, and one of the best recession-proof professions {{harv|Kiviat|2008}}. In the United States, the profession was rated as the best profession by CareerCast, which uses five key criteria to rank jobs—environment, income, employment outlook, physical demands, and stress, in 2010 {{harv|Needleman|2010}}, 2013 {{harv|Weber|2013}}, and 2015 {{harv|CareerCast|2015}}. In other years, it remained in the top 10 ({{harvnb|Thomas|2012}}, {{harvnb|CareerCast|2014}}, {{harvnb|CareerCast|2016}}). In the United Kingdom {{harv|Ugwumadu|2013}}, and around the world {{harv|ESSEC|2014}}, actuaries continue to be highly ranked as a profession.

==Credentialing and exams==
{{Main|Actuarial credentialing and exams}}
Becoming a fully credentialed actuary requires passing a rigorous series of professional examinations, usually taking several years. In some countries, such as Denmark, most study takes place in a university setting {{harv|Norberg|1990|p=407}}. In others, such as the US, most study takes place during employment through a series of examinations ({{harvnb|SOA|2018}}, {{harvnb|CAS|2018}}). In the UK, and countries based on its process, there is a hybrid university-exam structure {{harv|Institute and Faculty of Actuaries|2011a}}.

===Exam support===
As these qualifying exams are extremely rigorous, support is usually available to people progressing through the exams. Often, employers provide paid on-the-job study time and paid attendance at seminars designed for the exams {{harv|BeAnActuary|2011d}}. Also, many companies that employ actuaries have automatic pay raises or promotions when exams are passed. As a result, actuarial students have strong incentives for devoting adequate study time during off-work hours. A common rule of thumb for exam students is that, for the Society of Actuaries examinations, roughly 400&amp;nbsp;hours of study time are necessary for each four-hour exam {{harv|Sieger|1998}}. Thus, thousands of hours of study time should be anticipated over several years, assuming no failures {{harv|Feldblum|2001|p=6}}.

===Pass marks and pass rates===
Historically, the actuarial profession has been reluctant to specify the pass marks for its examinations ({{harvnb|Muckart|2010}}, {{harvnb|Prevosto|2000}}). To address concerns that there are pre-existing pass/fail quotas, a former Chairman of the Board of Examiners of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries stated, "Although students find it hard to believe, the Board of Examiners does not have fail quotas to achieve. Accordingly pass rates are free to vary (and do). They are determined by the quality of the candidates sitting the examination and in particular how well prepared they are. Fitness to pass is the criterion, not whether you can achieve a mark in the top 40% of candidates sitting." {{harv|Muckart|2010}}. In 2000, the [[Casualty Actuarial Society]] (CAS) decided to start releasing pass marks for the exams it offers {{harv|Prevosto|2000}}. The CAS's policy is also not to grade to specific pass ratios; the CAS board affirmed in 2001 that "the CAS shall use no predetermined pass ratio as a guideline for setting the pass mark for any examination. If the CAS determines that 70% of all candidates have demonstrated sufficient grasp of the syllabus material, then those 70% should pass. Similarly, if the CAS determines that only 30% of all candidates have demonstrated sufficient grasp of the syllabus material, then only those 30% should pass."{{harv|CAS|2001}}.

==Fictional actuaries==
{{main|Fictional actuaries}}
Actuaries have appeared in works of fiction including literature, theater, television, and film. &lt;!-- Sourced to Coleman --&gt;At times, they have been portrayed as "math-obsessed, socially disconnected individuals with shockingly bad comb-overs", which has resulted in a mixed response amongst actuaries themselves {{harv|Coleman|2003}}.

If the members had provided places for the disposal of their bodies after death, they now provided for the necessary funeral expenses by paying into the common fund weekly a small fixed sum, easily within the reach of the poorest of them. When a member died, a stated sum was drawn from the treasury for his funeral&amp;nbsp;... If the purpose of the society was the building of a columbārium, the cost was first determined and the sum total divided into what we should call shares (sortēs virīlēs), each member taking as many as he could afford and paying their value into the treasury.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4262">In [[physics]] and [[mathematics]], an '''ansatz''' ({{IPAc-en|'|ae|n|s|ae|t|s}}; {{IPA-de|ˈʔanzats|lang}}, meaning: "initial placement of a tool at a work piece", plural '''ansätze''' {{IPAc-en|'|ae|n|s|ɛ|t|s|ə}}; {{IPA-de|ˈʔanzɛtsə|lang}} or '''ansatzes''') is an educated guess&lt;ref name="Gershenfeld 1999"&gt;In his book on "The Nature of Mathematical Modelling", Neil Gershenfeld introduces ''ansatz'', with interpretation "a trial answer", to be an important technique for solving differential equations. Gershenfeld 1999, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; that is verified later by its results.

==Use==
An ansatz is the establishment of the starting equation(s), the theorem(s), or the value(s) describing a mathematical or physical problem or solution. It can take into consideration [[Boundary value problem|boundary conditions]].  After an ansatz has been established (constituting nothing more than an assumption), the equations are solved for the general function of interest (constituting a confirmation of the assumption).

==Examples==
Given a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of experimental data that looks to be [[Cluster analysis|clustered]] about a line, a linear ansatz could be made to find the [[parameter]]s of the line by a [[least squares]] curve fit. [[Calculus of variations|Variational]] [[approximation]] methods use ansätze and then fit the parameters.

Another example could be the mass, energy, and entropy balance equations that, considered simultaneous for purposes of the elementary operations of [[linear algebra]], are the ''ansatz'' to most basic problems of [[thermodynamics]].

Another example of an ansatz is to suppose the solutions of a homogeneous linear [[differential equation]] and [[difference equation]] to have, respectively, exponential and power form. More generally, one can guess a particular solution of a system of equations and test such an ansatz by direct substitution of the solution in the system of equations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2899">As a novel type of semi-discrete [[dynamical systems]], '''Boolean delay equations (BDEs)''' are models with Boolean-valued variables that evolve in continuous time.  Since at the present time, most phenomena are too complex to be modeled by [[partial differential equations]] (as continuous infinite-dimensional systems), BDEs are intended as a ([[heuristic]]) first step on the challenging road to further understanding and [[scientific model|modeling]] them.  For instance, one can mention complex problems in [[fluid dynamics]], [[climate]] dynamics, solid-earth [[geophysics]], and many problems elsewhere in [[natural sciences]] where much of the discourse is still [[wikt:conceptual|conceptual]].

==Hopes and promises==
Although in recent centuries, [[differential equation]]s (both ordinary and partial) have extensively served as [[quantitative property|quantitative]] models of vast categories of problems, by the recent greedy and rapid burst of complexities everywhere, the gap between [[quantitative property|quantitative]] and [[qualitative property|qualitative]] modeling and [[reasoning]] techniques is widening.  BDEs offer a formal [[mathematical]] language that is promising to help bridge that gap.

The '''Canon Palmtronic LE-80M''' is an early hand-held [[calculator]]. It was manufactured by [[Canon (company)|Canon inc]]. Unlike other models which used a processing chip manufactured by [[Texas Instruments]] the LE-80M used a [[Hitachi]] HD3553 chip.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.datamath.org/Related/Canon/LE-80M.htm|title=DATAMATH|website=www.datamath.org|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;    When first released in 1973, it retailed for $138.45.&lt;ref Name="Kiplinger "&gt;{{cite book |title= Kiplinger's Personal Finance; Vol. 27, No. 7|last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1973|publisher= Kiplinger Washington Editors, Inc.|location= |id= 528-9729|page= 41|pages= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=OQYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cocker's Decimal Arithmetick''''' is a [[grammar school]] [[mathematics]] textbook written by [[Edward Cocker]] (1631–1676) and published posthumously by John Hawkins in 1684.&lt;ref name=yeldham&gt;{{cite book | last=Yeldham | first=Florence | title=The Teaching of Arithmetic Through Four Hundred Years (1535-1935) | pages=75, 80–83, 85 | location=London | publisher=George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd. | year=1936 | oclc=152432557}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Decimal Arithmetick'' along with companion volume, ''[[Cocker's Arithmetick]]'' published in 1677, were used in schools in the United Kingdom for more than 150 years.

The concept of decimal fractions and the advantages of using them in calculations were well known, but a wide variety of different notations were in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Jeff Miller | title=Earliest Uses of Symbols for Fractions | url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/fractions.html| work=Jeff Miller's Mathword | date=28 April 2008 | accessdate=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; After surveying various notations, ''Decimal Arithmetick'' recommends the [[decimal point]] notation introduced by [[John Napier]]:

:''A decimal fraction being written ... by having a point or prick prefixed before it ... being written according to the first direction, I conceive they may be most fit for calculation.''&lt;ref name=yeldham/&gt;

''Decimal Arithmetick'' gives instructions for calculations involving decimals, methods of extracting roots, and an overview of the concept of logarithms. There are many worked examples, some of which involve solid geometry or the calculation of interest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1411">In [[mathematics]], '''corank''' is complementary to the concept of the rank of a mathematical object, and may refer to the dimension of the left [[Nullspace|nullspace of a matrix]], the dimension of the [[cokernel]] of a linear transformation of a vector space, or the number of elements of a [[Matroid rank|matroid minus its rank]]. 

== Left nullspace of a matrix ==
The corank of an &lt;math&gt;m\times n&lt;/math&gt; [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] is &lt;math&gt;m-r&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] of the matrix. Equivalently, by the [[fundamental theorem of linear algebra]], it is the dimension of the left nullspace of the matrix.

== Cokernel of a linear transformation ==
Generalizing matrices to [[linear transformation]]s of [[vector space]]s, the corank of a linear transformation is the dimension of the [[cokernel]] of the transformation, which is the quotient of the [[codomain]] by the image of the transformation.

== Matroid ==
For a [[matroid]] with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; elements and [[matroid rank]] &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, the corank or nullity of the matroid is &lt;math&gt;n-r&lt;/math&gt;. In the case of [[linear matroid]]s this coincides with the matrix corank. In the case of [[graphic matroid]]s the corank is also known as the [[circuit rank]] or cyclomatic number.

'''''De divina proportione''''' (''On the Divine Proportion'') is a book on [[mathematics]] written by [[Luca Pacioli]] and illustrated by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], composed around 1498 in [[Milan]] and first printed in 1509.&lt;ref name="StAnd"/&gt; Its subject was mathematical proportions (the title refers to the [[golden ratio]]) and their applications to geometry, visual art through [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], and architecture. The clarity of the written material and Leonardo's excellent diagrams helped the book to achieve an impact beyond mathematical circles, popularizing contemporary geometric concepts and images.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/pacioli.html|title=Luca Pacioli's Polyhedra|first=George W.|last=Hart|website=Virtual Polyhedra|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Y&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.math.ubc.ca/~hoek/Teaching/Golden/Divina.html|publisher = [[University of British Columbia]]|title = The Rose and the Nautilus|last = Hoechsmann|first = Klaus Hoechsmann|date = 1 April 2001|accessdate = 15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents of the book==
{{further information|Mathematics and art}}

[[File:Divina proportione.png|thumb|250px| Woodcut illustrating proportions of the human face. Note that despite the label in the image, the lines drawn relate to Vitruvius' system of integers and do not correspond in any way to the golden ratio.]]
The book consists of three separate manuscripts,&lt;ref name="StAnd"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Pacioli.html|title = Luca Pacioli|website = School of Mathematics and Statistics|publisher = [[University of St Andrews]]|last = O'Connor|first = J J|last2 = Robertson|first2 = E F|date = July 1999|accessdate = 15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Pacioli worked on between 1496 and 1498.

===''Compendio divina proportione''===
The first part, ''Compendio divina proportione'' (''Compendium on the Divine Proportion''), studies the [[golden ratio]] from a mathematical perspective (following the relevant work of [[Euclid]]) and explores its applications to various arts, in seventy-one chapters.&lt;ref name="StAnd"/&gt; It also contains a discourse on the [[Regular polyhedra|regular]] and [[semiregular polyhedra]],&lt;ref name=E/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=J F|last=Field|title=Rediscovering the Archimedean polyhedra: Piero della Francesca, Luca Pacioli, Leonardo da Vinci, Albrecht Dürer, Daniele Barbaro, and Johannes Kepler|journal=Arch. Hist. Exact Sci.|volume=50|number=3-4|year=1997|pages=241–289}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a discussion of the use of [[geometric perspective]] by painters such as [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Melozzo da Forlì]] and [[Marco Palmezzano]].

===''Trattato dell'architettura''===
The second part, ''Trattato dell'architettura'' (''Treatise on Architecture''), discusses the ideas of [[Vitruvius]] (from his ''[[De architectura]]'') on the application of [[mathematics and architecture|mathematics to architecture]] in twenty chapters. The text compares the proportions of the human body to those of artificial structures, with examples from classical [[Greco-Roman world#Architecture|Greco-Roman architecture]].

===''Libellus in tres partiales divisus''===
The third part, ''Libellus in tres partiales divisus'' (''Book divided into three parts''), is mainly an Italian translation of [[Piero della Francesca]]'s Latin writings ''On [the] Five Regular Solids'' ("''De quinque corporibus regularibus''")&lt;ref name="StAnd"/&gt; and mathematical examples.&lt;ref name=E&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ww3.ac-poitiers.fr/arts_p/b@lise14/pageshtm/page_4.htm |title=La Divine Proportion de Luca Pacioli |language=French |publisher=Académie de Poitiers |last=Gardes |first=Michel |date=20 June 2001 |accessdate=15 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150127090823/http://ww3.ac-poitiers.fr/arts_p/b%40lise14/pageshtm/page_4.htm |archivedate=27 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1550 [[Giorgio Vasari]] wrote a biography of della Francesca, in which he accused Pacioli of plagiarism and claimed that he stole della Francesca's work on perspective, on arithmetic and on geometry.&lt;ref name="StAnd"/&gt;

===Illustrations===
[[File:Leonardo polyhedra.png|thumb|250px| The first printed illustration of a [[rhombicuboctahedron]], by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].]]
After these three parts are appended two sections of illustrations, the first showing twenty-three capital letters drawn with a ruler and compass by Pacioli and the second with some sixty illustrations in [[woodcut]] after drawings by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].&lt;ref name=X&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/drawings_and_prints/divina_proportione_leonardo_da_vinci/objectview.aspx?collID=9&amp;OID=90003660|website = The Collection Online|publisher = Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York|title = Divina proportione, after Leonardo da Vinci|accessdate = 15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonardo drew the illustrations of the regular solids while he lived with and took mathematics lessons from Pacioli. Leonardo's drawings are probably the first illustrations of skeletonic solids which allowed an easy distinction between front and back.

==History==
Pacioli produced three manuscripts of the treatise by different scribes. He gave the first copy with a dedication to the Duke of Milan, [[Ludovico il Moro]]; this manuscript is now preserved in Switzerland at the [[Bibliothèque Publique et Universitaire (Geneva)|Bibliothèque de Genève]] in [[Geneva]]. A second copy was donated to [[Galeazzo da Sanseverino]] and now rests at the [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]] in Milan. The third, which has gone missing, was given to [[Pier Soderini]], the [[Gonfaloniere of Justice|Gonfaloniere]] of [[Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=PACIOLI, Luca|encyclopedia=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani|language=Italian|volume=80|year=2014|last=Di Teodoro|first=Francesco Paolo|publisher=Treccani|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/luca-pacioli_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29/|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 June 1509 the first printed edition was published in Venice by [[Paganino Paganini]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=PAGANINI, Paganino|encyclopedia=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani|language=Italian|volume=80|year=2014|last=Nuovo|first=Angela|publisher=Treccani|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/paganino-paganini_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29/|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has since been reprinted several times.

[[File:Fra Luca Pacioli Letter M 1509.png|thumb|250px| Architectural letter 'M']]
The book was displayed as part of an exhibition in Milan between October 2005 and October 2006 together with the [[Codex Atlanticus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.leonardo3.net/leonardo/atlantico/manoscritti_eng.htm|title = The Virtual Codex Atlanticus|website = Leonardo3|accessdate = 15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "M" logo used by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York is adapted from one in ''De divina proportione''.&lt;ref name=T&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://store.metmuseum.org/magnets-bookmarks+novelties/renaissance-m-bookmark/invt/10086668/|website = The Met Store|publisher = Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York|title = Renaissance 'M' Bookmark|accessdate = 15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[physics]] and [[mathematics]], the '''dimension''' of a [[mathematical space]] (or object) is informally defined as the minimum number of [[coordinates]] needed to specify any [[Point (geometry)|point]] within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=4 |title=Curious About Astronomy |publisher=Curious.astro.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111191053/http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=4 |archivedate=2014-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Dimension.html |title=MathWorld: Dimension |publisher=Mathworld.wolfram.com |date=2014-02-27 |accessdate=2014-03-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325220941/http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Dimension.html |archivedate=2014-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a [[Line (geometry)|line]] has a dimension of one because only one coordinate is needed to specify a point on it{{spndash}}for example, the point at 5 on a number line. A [[Surface (topology)|surface]] such as a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] or the surface of a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] or [[sphere]] has a [[two-dimensional space|dimension of two]] because two coordinates are needed to specify a point on it{{spndash}}for example, both a [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] are required to locate a point on the surface of a sphere. The inside of a [[cube]], a cylinder or a sphere is [[three-dimensional]] because three coordinates are needed to locate a point within these spaces.

In [[classical mechanics]], [[space]] and [[time]] are different categories and refer to [[absolute space and time]]. That conception of the world is a [[four-dimensional space]] but not the one that was found necessary to describe [[electromagnetism]]. The four dimensions of [[spacetime]] consist of [[event (relativity)|event]]s that are not absolutely defined spatially and temporally, but rather are known relative to the motion of an [[observer (special relativity)|observer]]. [[Minkowski space]] first approximates the universe without [[gravity]]; the [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s of [[general relativity]] describe spacetime with matter and gravity. Ten dimensions are used to describe [[string theory]], eleven dimensions can describe [[supergravity]] and [[M-theory]], and the state-space of [[quantum mechanics]] is an infinite-dimensional [[function space]].

The concept of dimension is not restricted to physical objects. '''{{vanchor|High-dimensional space|N-dimensional space|n dimensional space}}s''' frequently occur in mathematics and the sciences. They may be [[parameter space]]s or [[Configuration space (mathematics)|configuration space]]s such as in [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] or [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]; these are abstract [[space (mathematics)|space]]s, independent of the physical [[space]] we live in.

== In mathematics ==

In mathematics, the dimension of an object is, roughly speaking, the number of [[degrees of freedom]] of a point that moves on this object. In other words, the dimension is the number of independent [[parameter]]s or [[coordinates]] that are needed for defining the position of a point that is constrained to be on the object. For example, the dimension of a point is zero; the dimension of a [[line (geometry)|line]] is one, as a point can move on a line in only one direction (or its opposite); the dimension of a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] is two, etc.

The dimension is an intrinsic property of an object, in the sense that it is independent of the dimension of the space in which the object is or can be embedded. For example, a [[curve]], such as a [[circle]] is of dimension one, because the position of a point on a curve is determined by its signed distance along the curve to a fixed point on the curve. This is independent from the fact that a curve cannot be embedded in a [[Euclidean space]] of dimension lower than two, unless if it is a line.

The dimension of [[Euclidean space|Euclidean {{math|''n''}}-space]] {{math|'''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; }}is {{math|''n''}}. When trying to generalize to other types of spaces, one is faced with the question "what makes {{math|'''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; }} {{math|''n''}}-dimensional?" One answer is that to cover a fixed [[Ball (mathematics)|ball]] in {{math|'''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; }} by small balls of radius {{math|''ε''}}, one needs on the order of {{math|''ε''&lt;sup&gt;−''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} such small balls. This observation leads to the definition of the [[Minkowski dimension]] and its more sophisticated variant, the [[Hausdorff dimension]], but there are also other answers to that question. For example, the boundary of a ball in {{math|'''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; }} looks locally like {{math|'''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sup&gt; }} and this leads to the notion of the [[inductive dimension]]. While these notions agree on {{math|'''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, they turn out to be different when one looks at more general spaces.

A [[tesseract]] is an example of a four-dimensional object. Whereas outside mathematics the use of the term "dimension" is as in: "A tesseract ''has four dimensions''", mathematicians usually express this as: "The tesseract ''has dimension 4''", or: "The dimension of the tesseract ''is'' 4".

Although the notion of higher dimensions goes back to [[René Descartes]], substantial development of a higher-dimensional geometry only began in the 19th century, via the work of [[Arthur Cayley]], [[William Rowan Hamilton]], [[Ludwig Schläfli]] and [[Bernhard Riemann]]. Riemann's 1854 [[Habilitationsschrift]], Schläfli's 1852 ''Theorie der vielfachen Kontinuität'', and Hamilton's discovery of the [[quaternion]]s and [[John T. Graves]]' discovery of the [[octonion]]s in 1843 marked the beginning of higher-dimensional geometry.

The rest of this section examines some of the more important mathematical definitions of dimension.

===Vector spaces===
{{main|Dimension (vector space)}}
The dimension of a [[vector space]] is the number of vectors in any [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for the space, i.e. the number of coordinates necessary to specify any vector. This notion of dimension (the [[cardinality]] of a basis) is often referred to as the ''Hamel dimension'' or ''algebraic dimension'' to distinguish it from other notions of dimension.  

For the non-[[free module|free]] case, this generalizes to the notion of the [[length of a module]].

===Manifolds===
&lt;!--Linked from [[Ball (mathematics)]]--&gt;
The uniquely defined dimension of every [[Connectedness|connected]] topological [[manifold]] can be calculated. A connected topological manifold is [[Local property|locally]] [[homeomorphic]] to Euclidean {{math|''n''}}-space, in which the number {{math|''n''}} is the manifold's dimension.

For connected [[differentiable manifold]]s, the dimension is also the dimension of the [[Tangent space|tangent vector space]] at any point.

In [[geometric topology]], the theory of manifolds is characterized by the way dimensions 1 and 2 are relatively elementary, the '''high-dimensional''' cases {{nowrap|{{math|''n'' &gt; 4}}}} are simplified by having extra space in which to "work"; and the cases {{math|''n'' &amp;#61; 3}} and {{math|4}} are in some senses the most difficult. This state of affairs was highly marked in the various cases of the [[Poincaré conjecture]], where four different proof methods are applied.

====Complex dimension====

The dimension of a manifold depends on the base field with respect to which Euclidean space is defined.  While analysis usually assumes a manifold to be over the [[real numbers]], it is sometimes useful in the study of [[complex manifold]]s and [[dimension of an algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]] to work over the [[complex numbers]] instead. A complex number (''x'' + ''iy'') has a [[real part]] ''x'' and an [[imaginary part]] ''y'', where x and y are both real numbers; hence, the complex dimension is half the real dimension.  

Conversely, in algebraically unconstrained contexts, a single complex coordinate system may be applied to an object having two real dimensions.  For example, an ordinary two-dimensional [[sphere|spherical surface]], when given a complex metric, becomes a [[Riemann sphere]] of one complex dimension.&lt;ref&gt;Yau, S-T and Nadis, S.; ''The Shape of Inner Space'', Basic Books, 2010, Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Varieties===
{{main|Dimension of an algebraic variety}}
The dimension of an [[algebraic variety]] may be defined in various equivalent ways. The most intuitive way is probably the dimension of the [[tangent space]] at any [[Regular point of an algebraic variety]]. Another intuitive way is to define the dimension as the number of [[hyperplane]]s that are needed in order to have an intersection with the variety that is reduced to a finite number of points (dimension zero). This definition is based on the fact that the intersection of a variety with a hyperplane reduces the dimension by one unless if the hyperplane contains the variety.

An [[algebraic set]] being a finite union of algebraic varieties, its dimension is the maximum of the dimensions of its components. It is equal to the maximal length of the chains &lt;math&gt;V_0\subsetneq V_1\subsetneq \ldots \subsetneq V_d&lt;/math&gt; of sub-varieties of the given algebraic set (the length of such a chain is the number of "&lt;math&gt;\subsetneq&lt;/math&gt;").

Each variety can be considered as an [[stack (mathematics)|algebraic stack]], and its dimension as variety agrees with its dimension as stack. There are however many stacks which do not correspond to varieties, and some of these have negative dimension. Specifically, if ''V'' is a variety of dimension ''m'' and ''G'' is an [[algebraic group]] of dimension ''n'' [[group action|acting on ''V'']], then the [[quotient stack]] [''V''/''G''] has dimension ''m''&amp;minus;''n''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Fantechi|first=Barbara|chapter=Stacks for everybody|title=European Congress of Mathematics Volume I|volume=201|pages=349–359|series=Progr. Math.|publisher=Birkhäuser|year=2001|chapter-url=http://www.mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de/~rehmann/ECM/cdrom/3ecm/pdfs/pant3/fantechi.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060117052957/http://www.mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de/~rehmann/ECM/cdrom/3ecm/pdfs/pant3/fantechi.pdf|archivedate=2006-01-17|df=}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Krull dimension===
The [[Krull dimension]] of a [[commutative ring]] is the maximal length of chains of [[prime ideal]]s in it, a chain of length ''n'' being a sequence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}_0\subsetneq \mathcal{P}_1\subsetneq \ldots \subsetneq\mathcal{P}_n &lt;/math&gt; of prime ideals related by inclusion. It is strongly related to the dimension of an algebraic variety, because of the natural correspondence between sub-varieties and prime ideals of the ring of the polynomials on the variety.

For an [[algebra over a field]], the dimension as [[vector space]] is finite if and only if its Krull dimension is 0.

===Topological spaces===

For any [[normal topological space]] {{math|''X''}}, the [[Lebesgue covering dimension]] of {{math|''X''}} is defined to be ''n'' if ''n'' is the smallest [[integer]] for which the following holds: any [[open cover]] has an open refinement (a second open cover where each element is a subset of an element in the first cover) such that no point is included in more than {{math|''n'' + 1}} elements. In this case dim {{math|''X'' {{=}} ''n''}}. For {{math|''X''}} a manifold, this coincides with the dimension mentioned above. If no such integer {{math|''n''}} exists, then the dimension of {{math|''X''}} is said to be infinite, and one writes dim {{math|''X'' {{=}} ∞}}. Moreover, {{math|''X''}} has dimension −1, i.e. dim {{math|''X'' {{=}} −1}} if and only if {{math|''X''}} is empty. This definition of covering dimension can be extended from the class of normal spaces to all [[Tychonoff space]]s merely by replacing the term "open" in the definition by the term "'''functionally open'''".

An [[inductive dimension]] may be defined [[Mathematical induction|inductively]] as follows. Consider a [[Isolated point|discrete set]] of points (such as a finite collection of points) to be 0-dimensional. By dragging a 0-dimensional object in some direction, one obtains a 1-dimensional object. By dragging a 1-dimensional object in a ''new direction'', one obtains a 2-dimensional object. In general one obtains an ({{math|''n'' + 1}})-dimensional object by dragging an {{math|''n''}}-dimensional object in a ''new'' direction.  The inductive dimension of a topological space may refer to the ''small inductive dimension'' or the ''large inductive dimension'', and is based on the analogy that {{nowrap|({{math|''n'' + 1}})-dimensional}} balls have {{math|''n''}}-dimensional [[boundary (topology)|boundaries]], permitting an inductive definition based on the dimension of the boundaries of open sets.

Similarly, for the class of [[CW complexes]], the dimension of an object is the largest {{mvar|n}} for which the [[n-skeleton|{{mvar|n}}-skeleton]] is nontrivial.  Intuitively, this can be described as follows: if the original space can be [[homotopy|continuously deformed]] into a collection of [[simplex|higher-dimensional triangles]] joined at their faces with a complicated surface, then the dimension of the object is the dimension of those triangles.{{cite needed|date=June 2018}}

===Hausdorff dimension===
The [[Hausdorff dimension]] is useful for studying structurally complicated sets, especially [[fractal]]s. The Hausdorff dimension is defined for all [[metric space]]s and, unlike the dimensions considered above, can also have non-integer real values.&lt;ref name="Hausdorff dimension"&gt;[http://math.bu.edu/DYSYS/chaos-game/node6.html Fractal Dimension] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027003440/http://math.bu.edu/DYSYS/chaos-game/node6.html |date=2006-10-27 }}, Boston University Department of Mathematics and Statistics&lt;/ref&gt; The [[box-counting dimension|box dimension]] or [[Minkowski dimension]] is a variant of the same idea. In general, there exist more definitions of [[fractal dimension]]s that work for highly irregular sets and attain non-integer positive real values. Fractals have been found useful to describe many natural objects and phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor2-first=Shlomo |editor2-last=Havlin |editor1-first=Armin |editor1-last=Bunde |editor2-link=Shlomo Havlin |title=Fractals and Disordered Systems |year=1991 |publisher=Springer }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor2-first=Shlomo |editor2-last=Havlin |editor1-first=Armin |editor1-last=Bunde |editor2-link=Shlomo Havlin |title= Fractals in Science |year=1994 |publisher=Springer }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2015}}

===Hilbert spaces===
Every [[Hilbert space]] admits an [[orthonormal basis]], and any two such bases for a particular space have the same [[cardinality]]. This cardinality is called the dimension of the Hilbert space. This dimension is finite if and only if the space's [[Hamel dimension]] is finite, and in this case the two dimensions coincide.

== In physics ==

===Spatial dimensions===
Classical physics theories describe three [[physical dimension]]s: from a particular point in [[space]], the basic directions in which we can move are up/down, left/right, and forward/backward. Movement in any other direction can be expressed in terms of just these three. Moving down is the same as moving up a negative distance. Moving diagonally upward and forward is just as the name of the direction implies; ''i.e.'', moving in a [[linear combination]] of up and forward. In its simplest form: a line describes one dimension, a plane describes two dimensions, and a cube describes three dimensions. (See [[Space]] and [[Cartesian coordinate system]].)

===Time&lt;!--'Temporal dimension' and 'Temporal dimensions' redirect here--&gt;===
A '''temporal dimension'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is a dimension of time. Time is often referred to as the "[[Spacetime|fourth dimension]]" for this reason, but that is not to imply that it is a spatial dimension. A temporal dimension is one way to measure physical change. It is perceived differently from the three spatial dimensions in that there is only one of it, and that we cannot move freely in time but subjectively move [[Arrow of time|in one direction]].

The equations used in physics to model reality do not treat time in the same way that humans commonly perceive it. The equations of [[classical mechanics]] are [[T-symmetry|symmetric with respect to time]], and equations of quantum mechanics are typically symmetric if both time and other quantities (such as [[C-symmetry|charge]] and [[Parity (physics)|parity]]) are reversed. In these models, the perception of time flowing in one direction is an artifact of the [[laws of thermodynamics]] (we perceive time as flowing in the direction of increasing [[entropy]]).

The best-known treatment of time as a dimension is [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[special relativity]] (and extended to [[general relativity]]), which treats perceived space and time as components of a four-dimensional [[manifold]], known as [[spacetime]], and in the special, flat case as [[Minkowski space]].

===Additional dimensions===

In physics, three dimensions of space and one of time is the accepted norm. However, there are theories that attempt to unify the four [[fundamental forces]] by introducing [[extra dimensions]]. Most notably, [[superstring theory]] requires [[10 spacetime dimensions]], and originates from a more fundamental [[M-theory|11-dimensional]] theory tentatively called [[M-theory]] which subsumes five previously distinct superstring theories. To date, no experimental or observational evidence is available to support the existence of these extra dimensions. If extra dimensions exist, they must be hidden from us by some physical mechanism. One well-studied possibility is that the extra dimensions may be "curled up" at such tiny scales as to be effectively invisible to current experiments. Limits on the size and other properties of extra dimensions are set by particle experiments{{clarify|date=October 2014}} such as those at the [[Large Hadron Collider]].&lt;ref name="arxiv.org"&gt;CMS Collaboration, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.3375 "Search for Microscopic Black Hole Signatures at the Large Hadron Collider"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810063016/https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.3375 |date=2017-08-10 }} (arxiv.org)&lt;/ref&gt;

At the level of [[quantum field theory]], [[Kaluza–Klein theory]] unifies [[gravity]] with [[Gauge theory|gauge]] interactions, based on the realization that gravity propagating in small, compact extra dimensions is equivalent to gauge interactions at long distances. In particular when the geometry of the extra dimensions is trivial, it reproduces [[electromagnetism]]. However at sufficiently high energies or short distances, this setup still suffers from the same pathologies that famously obstruct direct attempts to describe [[quantum gravity]]. Therefore, these models still require a [[UV completion]], of the kind that string theory is intended to provide. In particular, superstring theory requires six compact dimensions forming a [[Calabi–Yau manifold]]. Thus Kaluza-Klein theory may be considered either as an incomplete description on its own, or as a subset of string theory model building.
 
In addition to small and curled up extra dimensions, there may be extra dimensions that instead aren't apparent because the matter associated with our visible universe is localized on a {{nowrap|(3 + 1)-dimensional}} subspace. Thus the extra dimensions need not be small and compact but may be [[large extra dimensions]]. [[D-brane]]s are dynamical extended objects of various dimensionalities predicted by string theory that could play this role. They have the property that open string excitations, which are associated with gauge interactions, are confined to the [[brane]] by their endpoints, whereas the closed strings that mediate the gravitational interaction are free to propagate into the whole spacetime, or "the bulk". This could be related to why gravity is exponentially weaker than the other forces, as it effectively dilutes itself as it propagates into a higher-dimensional volume.

Some aspects of brane physics have been applied to [[Brane cosmology|cosmology]]. For example, brane gas cosmology&lt;ref&gt;Brandenberger, R., Vafa, C., [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1989NuPhB.316..391B Superstrings in the early universe]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott Watson, [http://www-astro-theory.fnal.gov/Conferences/cosmo02/poster/watson.pdf Brane Gas Cosmology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027144123/http://www-astro-theory.fnal.gov/Conferences/cosmo02/poster/watson.pdf |date=2014-10-27 }} (pdf).&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to explain why there are three dimensions of space using topological and thermodynamic considerations. According to this idea it would be because three is the largest number of spatial dimensions where strings can generically intersect. If initially there are lots of windings of strings around compact dimensions, space could only expand to macroscopic sizes once these windings are eliminated, which requires oppositely wound strings to find each other and annihilate. But strings can only find each other to annihilate at a meaningful rate in three dimensions, so it follows that only three dimensions of space are allowed to grow large given this kind of initial configuration.

Extra dimensions are said to be [[Universal extra dimension|universal]] if all fields are equally free to propagate within them.

== Networks and dimension ==

Some complex [[Network science|network]]s are characterized by [[fractal dimension]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Song |first=Chaoming|  author2link=Shlomo Havlin  |title=Self-similarity of complex networks |journal=Nature |year=2005 |volume=433  |doi=10.1038/nature03248 |pmid=15674285|arxiv=cond-mat/0503078v1 |bibcode=2005Natur.433..392S |last2=Havlin |first2=Shlomo |last3=Makse |first3=Hernán A. |issue=7024|pages=392-395}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of dimension can be generalized to include networks embedded in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Dimension of spatially embedded networks |journal=Nature Physics |year=2011 |bibcode=2011NatPh...7..481D|doi=10.1038/nphys1932 |last=Daqing |first=Li |last2=Kosmidis |first2=Kosmas |last3=Bunde |first3=Armin |last4=Havlin |first4=Shlomo |author4link=Shlomo Havlin|volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=481 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dimension characterize their spatial constraints.

== In literature ==
{{main|Fourth dimension in literature}}

[[Science fiction]] texts often mention the concept of "dimension" when referring to [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel or alternate universe]]s or other imagined [[Plane (esotericism)|planes of existence]]. This usage is derived from the idea that to travel to parallel/alternate universes/planes of existence one must travel in a direction/dimension besides the standard ones. In effect, the other universes/planes are just a small distance away from our own, but the distance is in a fourth (or higher) spatial (or non-spatial) dimension, not the standard ones.

One of the most heralded science fiction stories regarding true geometric dimensionality, and often recommended as a starting point for those just starting to investigate such matters, is the 1884 novella ''[[Flatland]]'' by Edwin A. Abbott. Isaac Asimov, in his foreword to the Signet Classics 1984 edition, described ''Flatland'' as "The best introduction one can find into the manner of perceiving dimensions."

The idea of other dimensions was incorporated into many early science fiction stories, appearing prominently, for example, in [[Miles J. Breuer]]'s ''The Appendix and the Spectacles'' (1928) and [[Murray Leinster]]'s ''The Fifth-Dimension Catapult'' (1931); and appeared irregularly in science fiction by the 1940s.  Classic stories involving other dimensions include [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[—And He Built a Crooked House]]'' (1941), in which a California architect designs a house based on a three-dimensional projection of a tesseract; and [[Alan E. Nourse]]'s ''Tiger by the Tail'' and ''The Universe Between'' (both 1951). Another reference is [[Madeleine L'Engle]]'s novel ''[[A Wrinkle In Time]]'' (1962), which uses the fifth dimension as a way for "tesseracting the universe" or "folding" space in order to move across it quickly. The fourth and fifth dimensions were also a key component of the book ''[[The Boy Who Reversed Himself]]'' by [[William Sleator]].

== In philosophy ==

[[Immanuel Kant]], in 1783, wrote: "That everywhere space (which is not itself the boundary of another space) has three dimensions and that space in general cannot have more dimensions is based on the proposition that not more than three lines can intersect at right angles in one point. This proposition cannot at all be shown from concepts, but rests immediately on intuition and indeed on pure intuition ''a priori'' because it is apodictically (demonstrably) certain."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics That Will Be Able to Present Itself as a Science|Prolegomena]]'', § 12&lt;/ref&gt;

"Space has Four Dimensions" is a short story published in 1846 by German philosopher and [[Experimental psychology|experimental psychologist]] [[Gustav Fechner]] under the [[pseudonym]] "Dr. Mises". The protagonist in the tale is a shadow who is aware of and able to communicate with other shadows, but who is trapped on a two-dimensional surface. According to Fechner, this "shadow-man" would conceive of the third dimension as being one of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Banchoff |first=Thomas F. |journal=Interdisciplinary Science Reviews |title=From Flatland to Hypergraphics: Interacting with Higher Dimensions |year=1990 |url=http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/~banchoff/ISR/ISR.html |doi=10.1179/030801890789797239 |volume=15 |issue=4 |page=364 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414023125/http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/~banchoff/ISR/ISR.html |archivedate=2013-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The story bears a strong similarity to the "[[Allegory of the Cave]]" presented in [[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' ([[Circa|c.]] 380&amp;nbsp;BC).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="56812">A person's '''Erdős–Bacon number''' is the sum of one's [[Erdős number]]—which measures the "collaborative distance" in authoring academic papers between that person and Hungarian mathematician [[Paul Erdős]]—and one's [[Bacon number]]—which represents the number of links, through roles in films, by which the individual is separated from American actor [[Kevin Bacon]].&lt;ref name=Singh2002&gt;{{cite news |first=Simon |last=Singh |authorlink=Simon Singh |title=And the winner tonight is |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/4768389/And-the-winner-tonight-is.html |work=The Telegraph |date=May 1, 2002 |accessdate=September 26, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112081753/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/4768389/And-the-winner-tonight-is.html |archivedate=November 12, 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USAToday20070814&gt;{{cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/printedition/life/20070814/bl_cover14_side.art.htm |title=There's not much separating her from Bacon, Erdos |work=[[USA Today]] |date=August 14, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104060408/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/printedition/life/20070814/bl_cover14_side.art.htm |archivedate=November 4, 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lower the number, the closer a person is to Erdős and Bacon, which reflects a [[small world phenomenon]] in academia and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/30835 |year=1998 |last1=Collins |first1=James J. |last2=Chow |first2=Carson C. |journal=Nature |volume=393 |issue=6684 |pages=409–10 |pmid=9623993 |title=It's a small world|bibcode=1998Natur.393..409C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The combined Erdős/Bacon [sic]&lt;!-- was originally written with a slash --&gt; number was introduced by mathematicians Tim Hsu and David Grabiner sometime before late-January 1999, when they pointed out that [[Daniel Kleitman]] has a combined number of 3: a Bacon number of 2 and Erdős number of 1.&lt;ref name="enp1999"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acs.oakland.edu/~grossman/Erdoshp.html |title=The Erdös Number Project |first=Jerry |last=Grossman |date=January 27, 1999 |publisher=Oakland University |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990203155656/http://www.acs.oakland.edu/~grossman/Erdoshp.html |archivedate=1999-02-03}}. Current version at {{cite web |url=http://www.oakland.edu/enp |title=The Erdös Number Project |publisher=Oakland University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To have a defined Erdős–Bacon number, it is necessary to have both appeared in a film and co-authored an academic paper, although this in and of itself is not sufficient.
&lt;!--Paul Erdős has an Erdős–Bacon number of 3, having a Bacon number of 3 and an Erdős number of 0.

The symmetries of three-dimensional space can be classified into two infinite families—the [[Cyclic group|cyclic]] and [[Dihedral group|dihedral]] symmetries of ''n''-sided polygons—and five exceptional types of symmetry, namely the symmetry groups of the Platonic solids.]]
Many branches of mathematics study objects of a given type and prove a [[classification theorem]]. A common theme is that the classification results in a number of series of objects and a finite number of exceptions that do not fit into any series. These are known as '''exceptional objects'''. Frequently these exceptional objects play a further and important role in the subject. Furthermore, the exceptional objects in one branch of mathematics are often related to the exceptional objects in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stillwell|first=John|date=1998|title=Exceptional Objects|jstor=2589218|journal=[[The American Mathematical Monthly]]|volume=105|issue=9|pages=850–858|doi=10.2307/2589218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite arXiv|arxiv=1505.06742|first=Yang-Hui|last=He|first2=John|last2=McKay|author-link2=John McKay (mathematician)|title=Sporadic and Exceptional|date=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plus.maths.org/content/os/issue33/features/baez/index|title=Ubiquitous octonions|last=Joyce|first=Helen|date=1 January 2005|website=Plus Magazine|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related phenomenon is [[exceptional isomorphism]], when two series are in general different, but agree for some small values.

== Regular polytopes ==
{{Main|Regular polytope}}
The prototypical examples of exceptional objects arise in the classification of [[regular polytope]]s. In two dimensions there is a series of [[regular polygon|regular ''n''-gons]] for ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;3. In every dimension above 2 we find analogues of the cube, tetrahedron and octahedron. In three dimensions we find two more regular polyhedra — the [[dodecahedron]] (12-hedron) and the [[icosahedron]] (20-hedron) — making five [[Platonic solids]]. In four dimensions we have a total of six [[Convex regular 4-polytope|regular polytopes]] including the [[120-cell]], the [[600-cell]] and the [[24-cell]]. There are no other regular polytopes; in higher dimensions the only regular polytopes are of the [[hypercube]], [[simplex]], [[orthoplex]] series.  In all dimensions combined, there are therefore three series and five exceptional polytopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/platonic.html|title=Platonic Solids in All Dimensions|last=Baez|first=John C.|date=12 November 2006|website=math.ucr.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pattern is similar if non-convex polytopes are included.  In two dimensions there is a [[regular star polygon]] for every [[rational number]] ''p''/''q''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2.  In three dimensions there are four [[Kepler–Poinsot polyhedron|Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra]], and in four dimensions ten [[Schläfli–Hess polychoron|Schläfli–Hess polychora]]; in higher dimensions there are no non-convex regular figures.

These can be generalized to [[tessellation]]s of other spaces, especially [[Uniform tiling|uniform tessellations]], notably tilings of Euclidean space ([[honeycomb (geometry)|honeycombs]]), which have exceptional objects, and tilings of hyperbolic space. There are various exceptional objects in dimension below 6, but in dimension 6 and above the only regular polyhedra/tilings/hyperbolic tilings are the simplex, hypercube, cross-polytope, and hypercube lattice.

=== Schwarz triangles ===

|}

Related to tilings and the regular polyhedra, there are exceptional [[Schwarz triangle]]s (triangles that tile the sphere, or more generally Euclidean plane or hyperbolic plane via their [[triangle group]] of reflections in their edges), particularly the [[Möbius triangle]]s. In the sphere there are 3 Möbius triangles (and 1 1-parameter family), corresponding to the 3 exceptional Platonic solid groups, while in the Euclidean plane there are 3 Möbius triangles, corresponding to the 3 special triangles: 60-60-60 ([[equilateral triangle|equilateral]]), [[45-45-90]] (isosceles right), and [[30-60-90]]. There are additional exceptional Schwarz triangles in the sphere and Euclidean plane. By contrast, in the hyperbolic plane there is a 3-parameter family of Möbius triangles, and none exceptional.

== Finite simple groups ==
{{Main|Sporadic group}}
[[File:SporadicGroups.svg|thumb|The relations between the sporadic groups, most being related to the monster.]]

The finite simple groups have been [[Classification of finite simple groups|classified]] into a number of series as well as 26 [[sporadic groups]]. Of these, 20 are subgroups or subquotients of the [[monster group]], referred to as the "Happy Family", while 6 are not, and are referred to as "[[Pariah group|pariahs]]".

Several of the sporadic groups are related to the [[Leech lattice]], most notably the Conway group Co&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, which is the automorphism group of the Leech lattice, quotiented out by its center.

== Division algebras ==

There are only three finite-dimensional associative [[division algebras]] over the reals — the [[real numbers]], the [[complex numbers]] and the [[quaternions]]. The only non-associative division algebra is the algebra of [[octonions]]. The octonions are connected to a wide variety of exceptional objects. For example, the exceptional formally real [[Jordan algebra]] is the [[Albert algebra]] of 3 by 3 self-adjoint matrices over the octonions.

== Simple Lie groups ==

The [[simple Lie group]]s form a number of series ([[classical Lie group]]s) labelled A, B, C and D. In addition there are the exceptional groups [[G2 (mathematics)|G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] (the automorphism group of the octonions), [[F4 (mathematics)|F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[E6 (mathematics)|E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[E7 (mathematics)|E&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[E8 (mathematics)|E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]]. These last four groups can be viewed as the symmetry groups of projective planes over '''O''', '''C'''⊗'''O''', '''H'''⊗'''O''' and '''O'''⊗'''O''' respectively, where '''O''' is the octonions and the tensor products are over the reals.

The classification of Lie groups corresponds to the classification of [[root systems]] and thus the exceptional Lie groups correspond to exceptional root systems and exceptional [[Dynkin diagram]]s.

== Supersymmetric algebras ==
There are a few exceptional objects with [[supersymmetry]]. The classification of [[superalgebra]]s by [[Victor Kac|Kac]] and Tierry-Mieg indicates that the [[Lie superalgebra]]s '''G(3)''' in 31 dimensions and '''F(4)''' in 40 dimensions, and the Jordan superalgebras '''K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''K&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;''', are examples of exceptional objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kac|first=V. G.|date=1977-01-01|title=Classification of simple z-graded lie superalgebras and simple jordan superalgebras|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00927877708822224|journal=Communications in Algebra|volume=5|issue=13|pages=1375–1400|doi=10.1080/00927877708822224|issn=0092-7872}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0016126|title=Group Theoretical Methods in Physics|last=Thierry-Mieg|first=Jean|date=1984|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|pages=94–98|language=en|doi=10.1007/bfb0016126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unimodular lattices ==

Up to isometry there is only one even [[unimodular lattice]] in 15 dimensions or less &amp;mdash; the [[E8 lattice|E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; lattice]]. Up to dimension [[24 (number)|24]] there is only one even unimodular lattice without [[root system|roots]], the [[Leech lattice]]. Three of the sporadic simple groups were discovered by Conway while investigating the automorphism group of the Leech lattice. For example, [[Conway group|Co&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]] is the automorphism group itself modulo ±1. The groups [[Conway group|Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Conway group|Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], as well as a number of other sporadic groups, arise as stabilisers of various subsets of the Leech lattice.

== Codes ==

Some [[Error-correcting code|codes]] also stand out as exceptional objects, in particular the perfect binary Golay code which is closely related to the Leech lattice. The [[Mathieu group]] &lt;math&gt;M_{24}&lt;/math&gt;, one of the sporadic simple groups, is the group of automorphisms of the [[binary Golay code|extended binary Golay code]], and four more of the sporadic simple groups arise as various types of stabilizer subgroup of &lt;math&gt;M_{24}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Block designs ==

An exceptional [[block design]] is the [[Steiner system]] S(5,8,24) whose automorphism group is the sporadic simple [[Mathieu group]] &lt;math&gt;M_{24}&lt;/math&gt;.

The codewords of the [[binary Golay code|extended binary Golay code]] have a length of 24 bits and have weights 0, 8, 12, 16, or 24. This code can correct up to three errors. So every 24-bit word with weight 5 can be corrected to a codeword with weight 8. The bits of a 24-bit word can be thought of as specifying the possible subsets of a 24 element set. So the extended binary Golay code gives a unique 8 element subset for each 5 element subset. In fact, it defines S(5,8,24).

== Outer automorphisms ==
Certain families of groups generically have a certain [[outer automorphism group]], but in particular cases they have other, exceptional outer automorphisms.

Among families of finite simple groups, the only example is in the [[automorphisms of the symmetric and alternating groups]]: for &lt;math&gt;n \geq 3, n \neq 6&lt;/math&gt; the [[alternating group]] &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; has one outer automorphism (corresponding to conjugation by an odd element of &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;) and the [[symmetric group]] &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; has no outer automorphisms. However, for &lt;math&gt;n=6,&lt;/math&gt; there is an [[Automorphisms of the symmetric and alternating groups#exceptional outer automorphism|exceptional outer automorphism]] of &lt;math&gt;S_6&lt;/math&gt; (of order 2), and correspondingly, the outer automorphism group of &lt;math&gt;A_6&lt;/math&gt; is not &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; (the group of order 2) but rather &lt;math&gt;C_2 \times C_2&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Klein four-group]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2015/08/a_wrinkle_in_the_mathematical.html|title=A Wrinkle in the Mathematical Universe|last=Baez|first=John C.|date=17 August 2015|website=[[nLab|The n-Category Café]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://brauer.maths.qmul.ac.uk/Atlas/v3/alt/A6/|title=ATLAS: Alternating group A6, Linear group L2(9), Symplectic group S4(2)', Mathieu group M10'|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Atlas of Finite Groups|Atlas of Finite Group Representations]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lYMAg_Sj7hUC|title=The Finite Simple Groups|last=Wilson|first=Robert|date=2009-12-14|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=|isbn=9781848009875|location=|pages=19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If one instead considers A&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; as the (isomorphic) [[projective special linear group]] PSL(2,9), then the outer automorphism is not exceptional; thus the exceptionalness can be seen as due to the [[exceptional isomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;A_6 \cong \operatorname{PSL}(2,9).&lt;/math&gt; This exceptional outer automorphism is realized inside of the Mathieu group M&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and similarly, M&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; acts on a set of 12 elements in 2 different ways.

Among [[Lie groups]], the [[spin group]] Spin(8) has an exceptionally large outer automorphism group (namely &lt;math&gt;S_3&lt;/math&gt;), which corresponds to the exceptional symmetries of the [[Dynkin diagram]] D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. This phenomenon is referred to as ''[[triality]].''

The exceptional symmetry of the D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; diagram also gives rise to the [[Steinberg group (Lie theory)|Steinberg groups]].

{{Main|Kervaire invariant}}
The [[Kervaire invariant]] is an invariant of a (4''k''+2)-dimensional manifold that measures whether the manifold could be [[Surgery theory|surgically]] converted into a sphere. This invariant evaluates to 0 if the manifold can be converted to a sphere, and 1 otherwise. More specifically, the Kervaire invariant applies to a [[framed manifold]], that is, to a manifold equipped with an [[embedding]] into [[Euclidean space]] and a trivialization of the [[normal bundle]]. The Kervaire invariant problem is the problem of determining in which dimensions the Kervaire invariant can be nonzero. For differentiable manifolds, this can happen in dimensions 2, 6, 14, 30, 62, and possibly 126, and in no other dimensions. The final case of dimension 126 remains open.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.simonsfoundation.org/mathematics-and-physical-science/mathematicians-solve-45-year-old-kervaire-invariant-puzzle/|title=Mathematicians Solve 45-Year-Old Kervaire Invariant Puzzle|last=Klarreich|first=Erica|date=20 July 2009|website=[[Simons Foundation]]|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arXiv|arxiv=1104.4523|first=Haynes|last=Miller|title=Kervaire Invariant One [after M.

Ravenel]|date=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These five or six framed [[cobordism class]]es of manifolds having Kervaire invariant 1 are exceptional objects related to [[exotic sphere]]s. The first three cases are related to the complex numbers, quaternions and octonions respectively: a manifold of Kervaire invariant 1 can be constructed as the product of two spheres, with its exotic framing determined by the normed division algebra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ranicki|first=Andrew|date=2011|title=Commentary on "On the parallelizability of the spheres" by R.

Due to similarities of dimensions, it is conjectured that the remaining cases (dimensions 30, 62 and 126) are related to the [[Rosenfeld projective plane]]s, which are defined over algebras constructed from the octonions. Specifically, it has been conjectured that there is a construction that takes these projective planes and produces a manifold with nonzero Kervaire invariant in two dimensions lower, but this remains unconfirmed.

== Symmetric quantum measurements ==

In [[quantum information science|quantum information theory]], there exist structures known as [[SIC-POVM]]s or SICs, which correspond to maximal sets of complex [[equiangular lines]]. Some of the known SICs&amp;mdash;those in vector spaces of 2 and 3 dimensions, as well as certain solutions in 8 dimensions&amp;mdash;are considered exceptional objects and called "sporadic SICs". They differ from the other known SICs in ways that involve their symmetry groups, the [[Galois theory]] of the numerical values of their vector components, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Appleby|first=Marcus|last2=Flammia|first2=Steven|last3=McConnell|first3=Gary|last4=Yard|first4=Jon|date=2017-08-01|title=SICs and Algebraic Number Theory|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10701-017-0090-7|journal=Foundations of Physics|language=en|volume=47|issue=8|pages=1042–1059|arxiv=1701.05200|doi=10.1007/s10701-017-0090-7|issn=0015-9018|via=|bibcode=2017FoPh...47.1042A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sporadic SICs in dimension 8 are related to the integral octonions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stacey|first=Blake C.|date=2017-08-01|title=Sporadic SICs and the Normed Division Algebras|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10701-017-0087-2|journal=Foundations of Physics|language=en|volume=47|issue=8|pages=1060–1064|arxiv=1605.01426|doi=10.1007/s10701-017-0087-2|issn=0015-9018|via=|bibcode=2017FoPh...47.1060S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Connections ==
Numerous connections have been observed between some, though not all, of these exceptional objects. Most common are objects related to [[8 (number)|8]] and [[24 (number)|24]] dimensions, noting that 24&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;8&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;3.  By contrast, the [[pariah group]]s stand apart, as the name suggests.

=== 8 and 24 dimensions ===
Exceptional objects related to the number 8 include the following.
* The octonions are 8-dimensional.
* The [[E8 lattice|E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; lattice]] can be realized as the integral octonions (up to a scale factor).
* The exceptional Lie groups can be seen as symmetries of the octonions and structures derived from the octonions;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week106.html|title=This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics: Week106|last=Baez|first=John C.|date=23 July 1997|website=math.ucr.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; further, the E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; algebra is related to the E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; lattice, as the notation implies (the lattice is generated by the root system of the algebra).
* Triality occurs for Spin(8), which also connects to 8&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;3 &amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;24.
Likewise, exceptional objects related to the number 24 include the following.
* The Leech lattice is 24-dimensional.
* Most sporadic simple groups can be related to the Leech lattice, or more broadly the Monster.
* The exceptional [[Jordan algebra]] has a representation in terms of 24&amp;times;24 real matrices together with the Jordan product rule.

These objects are connected to various other phenomena in math which may be considered surprising but not themselves "exceptional". For example, in [[algebraic topology]], 8-fold real [[Bott periodicity]] can be seen as coming from the octonions. In the theory of [[modular forms]], the 24-dimensional nature of the Leech lattice underlies the presence of 24 in the formulas for the [[Dedekind eta function]] and the [[modular discriminant]], which connection is deepened by [[Monstrous moonshine]], a development that related modular functions to the Monster group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borcherds|first=Richard E.|author-link=Richard Borcherds|date=1998|title=What is Moonshine?|url=http://www.emis.ams.org/journals/DMJDMV/xvol-icm/Fields/Borcherds.MAN.html|journal=Documenta Mathematica|volume=ICM 1|pages=607&amp;ndash;615|arxiv=math/9809110|via=|bibcode=1998math......9110B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physics ===
In [[string theory]] and superstring theory we often find that particular dimensions are singled out as a result of exceptional algebraic phenomena. For example, [[bosonic string theory]] requires a spacetime of dimension 26 which is directly related to the presence of 24 in the [[Dedekind eta function]]. Similarly, the possible dimensions of [[supergravity]] are related to the dimensions of the [[division algebras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baez|first=John C.|last2=Huerta|first2=John|date=October 2011|title=Division algebras and supersymmetry II|url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.atmp/1349879112|journal=Advances in Theoretical and Mathematical Physics|language=EN|volume=15|issue=5|pages=1373–1410|arxiv=1003.3436|issn=1095-0761|via=|doi=10.4310/atmp.2011.v15.n5.a4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monstrous moonshine ===

Many of the exceptional objects in mathematics and physics have been found to be connected to each other. Developments such as the [[Monstrous moonshine]] conjectures show how, for example, the [[Monster group]] is connected to [[string theory]]. The theory of [[modular forms]] shows how the algebra E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; is connected to the Monster group. (In fact, well before the proof of the Monstrous moonshine conjecture, the [[J-invariant|elliptic ''j''-function]] was discovered to encode the representations of E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kac|first=V.G|title=An elucidation of "Infinite-Dimensional Algebras … and the very strange formula."

Below is a [[mind map]] showing how some of the exceptional objects in mathematics and mathematical physics are related.

[[File:Exceptionalmindmap2.png|600px]]

The connections can partly be explained by thinking of the algebras as a tower of lattice [[vertex operator algebra]]s. It just so happens that the vertex algebras at the bottom are so simple that they are isomorphic to familiar non-vertex algebras. Thus the connections can be seen simply as the consequence of some lattices being sub-lattices of others.

=== Supersymmetries ===
The [[Jordan superalgebra]]s are a parallel set of exceptional objects with [[supersymmetry]]. These are the [[Lie superalgebra]]s which are related to Lorentzian lattices. This subject is less explored, and the connections between the objects are less well established. There are new conjectures parallel to the [[Monstrous moonshine]] conjectures for these super-objects, involving different sporadic groups.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

== Unexceptional objects ==

=== Pathologies ===
{{See also|Pathological (mathematics)}}
"Exceptional" object is reserved for objects that are unusual, meaning rare, the exception, not for ''unexpected'' or ''non-standard'' objects. These unexpected-but-typical (or common) phenomena are generally referred to as [[Pathological (mathematics)|pathological]], such as [[nowhere differentiable function]]s, or "exotic", as in [[exotic sphere]]s — there are exotic spheres in arbitrarily high dimension (not only a finite set of exceptions), and in many dimensions most (differential structures on) spheres are exotic.

=== Extremal objects ===
Exceptional objects must be distinguished from ''extremal'' objects: those that fall in a family and are the most extreme example by some measure are of interest, but not unusual in the way exceptional objects are. For example, the [[golden ratio]] ''φ'' has the simplest [[continued fraction]] approximation, and accordingly is most difficult to [[Diophantine approximation|approximate by rationals]]; however, it is but one of infinitely many such quadratic numbers (continued fractions).

Similarly, the (2,3,7) [[Schwarz triangle]] is the smallest hyperbolic Schwarz triangle, and the associated [[(2,3,7) triangle group]] is of particular interest, being the universal [[Hurwitz group]], and thus being associated with the [[Hurwitz curve]]s, the maximally symmetric algebraic curves. However, it falls in a family of such triangles ((2,4,7), (2,3,8), (3,3,7), etc.), and while the smallest, is not exceptional or unlike the others.

The term '''fractal expressionism''' was coined by physicist-artist Richard Taylor and co-authors to distinguish fractal art generated directly by artists from fractal art generated using mathematics and/or computers.&lt;ref&gt;R.P.Taylor, A.P. Micolich and D. Jonas, Fractal Expressionism, Physics World, 25, October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Fractals are patterns that repeat at increasingly fine scales and are prevalent in natural scenery (examples include clouds, rivers, and mountains).&lt;ref&gt;Mandelbrot, BB, The Fractal Geometry of Nature, WH Freedman, New York, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Fractal expressionism implies a direct expression of nature's patterns in an art work.

== Jackson Pollock's poured paintings ==

The initial studies of fractal expressionism focused on the poured paintings by the American artist [[Jackson Pollock]] (1912-1956), whose work has traditionally been associated with the [[Abstract expressionism|abstract expressionist movement]].&lt;ref name="taylor1999nature"&gt;[Taylor, Richard P., Adam P. Micolich, and David Jonas. "Fractal Analysis of Pollock's Drip Paintings." Nature 399.6735 (1999): 422. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="taylor1999physicsworld"&gt;["Fractals Determine Date of Paintings." Physics World 04 June 1999: n. pag. Web. &lt;http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/1999/jun/04/fractals-determine-date-of-paintings&gt;.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Richard P., Adam P. Micolich, and David Jonas. "Fractal Analysis of Pollock's Drip Paintings." Nature 399.6735 (1999): 422. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Pollock’s patterns had previously been referred to as “natural” and “organic”, inviting speculation by author John Briggs in 1992 that Pollock's work featured fractals.&lt;ref&gt;John Briggs, Fractals, Touchstone Publishers, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Taylor built a pendulum device called the Pollockizer which painted fractal patterns bearing a similarity to Pollock’s work.&lt;ref&gt;R.P.Taylor, A.P. Micolich and D. Jonas, Fractal Expressionism, Physics World, 25, October 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Computer analysis of Pollock's work published by Taylor et al.  in a 1999 Nature article found that Pollock's painted patterns have characteristics that match those displayed by nature's fractals (specifically, they demonstrate a statistical [[self-similarity]] quantified by a non-integer dimension over a magnification range of 1.5-2 orders of magnitude).  This analysis supported clues (see below) that Pollock's patterns are fractal and reflect "the fingerprint of nature".&lt;ref name="taylor1999nature" /&gt;

Taylor noted several similarities between Pollock's painting style and the processes used by nature to construct its landscapes.  For instance, he cites Pollock's propensity to revisit paintings that he had not adjusted in several weeks as being comparable to cyclic processes in nature, such as the seasons or the tides.&lt;ref name="artbook"&gt;[Taylor, Richard. "Fractal Expressionism—Where Art Meets Science." Art and Complexity. Ed. John Casti and Anders Karlqvist. 1st ed. Greenwich: JAI, 2003. 117-44. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Taylor observed several visual similarities between the patterns produced by nature and those produced by Pollock as he painted.  He points out that Pollock abandoned the use of a traditional frame for his paintings, preferring instead to roll out his canvas on the floor; this, Taylor asserts, is more compatible with how nature works than traditional painting techniques because the patterns in nature's scenery are not artificially bounded.&lt;ref name="artbook" /&gt;

The perceived similarities between the processes and patterns involved in Pollock's paintings and those of nature compelled Taylor to posit that the same "basic trademark" of nature's pattern construction also appears in Pollock's work.&lt;ref name="artbook" /&gt;  Since some natural fractals are generated by a process known as "chaos",&lt;ref name="chaosbook"&gt;[Cvitanovic´, Predrag, Roberto Artuso, Ronnie Mainieri, and Gábor Vattay. Chaos: Classical and Quantum. Copenhagen: Niels Bohr Institute, 2016. ChaosBook.org. Web.]&lt;/ref&gt; including fractals in human physiology,&lt;ref&gt;J.B. Bassingthwaighte et al, Fractal Physiology, Oxford University press, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor believed that Pollock's painting process might also have been chaotic, and could therefore leave behind a fractal pattern.  Taylor's hypothesis seems to be reflected in Pollock's statement "I am nature", which he made when asked if nature was a source of inspiration for his work.&lt;ref name="krasner"&gt;Krasner, Lee. "Lee Krasner Oral History." Interview by Dorothy Seckler. Archives of American Art. Smithsonian, 19 May 2005. Web. 30 Dec. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, Pollock is also quoted as stating "No chaos, damn it",  in response to a Time magazine article that referred to his paintings as "chaotic".&lt;ref name="nochaos"&gt;[Karmel, Pepe, ed. Jackson Pollock: Key Interviews, Articles and Reviews. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2000. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt;   However, chaos theory was not understood until after Pollock's death, so he could not have been referring to the chaotic systems in nature but rather its common usage to mean disorder. In the famous film footage of [[Hans Namuth]],&lt;ref name="[https://www.sfmoma.org/watch/jackson-pollock-paintings-have-a-life-of-their-own/ sfmoma]"&gt;[Jackson Pollock: Paintings Have a Life of Their Own. Perf. Jackson Pollock. SFMOMA. SFMOMA, n.d. Web. &lt;https://www.sfmoma.org/watch/jackson-pollock-paintings-have-a-life-of-their-own/&gt;.]&lt;/ref&gt; Pollock says his paintings are no accident, and that he was able to control the flow of paint onto the canvas.

Taylor points to two aspects of Pollock's painting process that have the potential to introduce fractal patterns. The first is Pollock's motion as he moved around the canvas, which Taylor hypothesized followed a Levy flight, a type of chaotic motion that is known to leave behind a fractal pattern.&lt;ref name="artbook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mandelbrot"&gt;[Mandelbrot, Benoit B. The Fractal Geometry of Nature. San Francisco: W.H. Freeman, 1982. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt;  More specifically, a number of studies have shown that the motions associated with human balance have fractal characteristics. The second source of chaos could be introduced through Pollock's pouring technique.  Falling fluid has the capability of changing from a non-chaotic to a chaotic flow, meaning that Pollock could have introduced a chaotic flow of paint as he dripped it onto the canvas.&lt;ref name="artbook" /&gt; Although the fractal characteristics of human balance and falling liquid are generated on Pollock's painting time and length scales, physicist [[Predrag Cvitanovic]] notes that it would be quite an artistic challenge to control them: such parameters "are in no sense observable and measurable on the length-scales and time-scales dominated by chaotic dynamics".{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Since Taylor's initial Pollock analysis in 1999, more than ten research groups have used various forms of fractal analysis to successfully quantify Pollock’s work.&lt;ref&gt;J.R. Mureika, C.C.

Lee, S 2007"/&gt; Mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot (who invented the term fractal) and art theorist Francis O’Connor (the chief Pollock scholar) are well known advocates of fractal expressionism.&lt;ref name="J. Rehmeyer, 2007"&gt;J. Rehmeyer, “Fractal or Fake?”, ScienceNews, vol. 171, 122-123, (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see o'conner's website&lt;/ref&gt;

== The relationship between fractal expressionism and fractal fluency ==

Fractal expressionism is related to fractal fluency&lt;ref&gt;23 Taylor, RP, and Spehar B, Fractal Fleuncy: An Intimate Relationship Between the Brain and Processing of Fractal Stimuli, In: The Fractal Geometry of the Brain. New York: Springer; 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; because the latter provides an appealing motivation for why artists such as Pollock might aspire to Fractal Expressionism.  Fractal fluency is a neuroscience model that proposes that, through exposure to nature’s fractal scenery, people’s visual systems have adapted to efficiently process fractals with ease. This adaptation occurs at many stages of the visual system, from the way people’s eyes move to which regions of the brain get activated. Fluency puts the viewer in a ‘comfort zone’ so inducing an aesthetic experience. Neuroscience experiments have shown that Pollock’s paintings induce the same positive physiological responses in the observer as nature’s fractals and mathematical fractals.&lt;ref name="R.P. Taylor, B. Spehar 2011"&gt;R.P. Taylor, B. Spehar, P. Van Donkelaar and C.M. Hagerhall, “Perceptual and Physiological Responses to Jackson Pollock’s Fractals,” Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, vol. 5 1- 13 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of fractal fluency and the associated aesthetics, other artists might be expected to display fractal expressionism. One year before Taylor’s publication, mathematician Richard Voss quantified Chinese art using fractal analysis.&lt;ref name="R. Voss 1998"&gt;R. Voss, Fractal Image Encoding and Analysis, Springer, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, other groups have used computer analysis to identify fractal content in a number of Western and Eastern artists,&lt;ref name="C. Redies, J 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="D.J. Field, 2008"/&gt; most recently in Pollock’s colleague Willem De Kooning’s work.&lt;ref&gt;A. Forsythe et al, Journal of Neurophysiology, vol. 31, 1, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the above analyzed works, symbolic representations of fractals can be found in cultures across the continents spanning several centuries, including Roman, Egyptian, Aztec, Incan and Mayan civilizations. They frequently predate patterns named after the mathematicians who subsequently developed their visual characteristics. For example, although von Koch is famous for developing The Koch Curve in 1904, a similar shape featuring repeating triangles was first used to depict waves in friezes by Hellenic artists (300 B.C.E.). In the 13th century, repetition of triangles in Cosmati Mosaics generated a shape later known in mathematics as The Sierpinski Triangle (named after Sierpinski’s 1915 pattern). Triangular repetitions are also found in the 12th century pulpit of The Ravello Cathedral in Italy. The lavish artwork within The Book of Kells (circa 800 C.E.) and the sculpted arabesques in The Jain Dilwara Temple in Mount Abu, India (1031 C.E.) also both reveal stunning examples of exact fractals. The artistic works of Leonardo da Vinci and Katsushika Hokusai serve as more recent examples from Europe and Asia, each reproducing the recurring patterns that they saw in nature. Da Vinci’s sketch of turbulence in water, The Deluge (1571–1518), was composed of small swirls within larger swirls of water. In The Great Wave off Kanagawa (1830–1833), Hokusai portrayed a wave crashing on a shore with small waves on top of a large wave. Other woodcuts from the same period also feature repeating patterns at several size scales: The Ghost of Kohada Koheiji shows fissures in a skull and The Falls At Mt. Kurokami features branching channels in a waterfall.

== The use of fractals to authenticate art and the associated controversy ==

Voss's 1998 study of Chinese art was the first demonstration of using fractal analysis to distinguish between the works of different artists.&lt;ref name="R. Voss 1998"/&gt; Following Taylor's 1999 Pollock publication, Art conservator Jim Coddington proposed that fractal analysis should be explored as a technique to help authenticate Pollock paintings. In 2005, Taylor and colleagues published a fractal analysis of 14 authentic and 37 imitation Pollocks suggesting that, when combined with other techniques, fractal analysis might be useful for authenticating Pollock's work.&lt;ref&gt;R.P. Taylor et al, “Authenticating Pollock Paintings Using Fractal Geometry”, Pattern Recognition Letters, vol. 28, 695-702 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same year, The Pollock-Krasner Foundation requested a fractal analysis to be used for the first time in an authenticity dispute,&lt;ref&gt;A Abbott, Fractals and art: In the hands of a master, Nature 439, 648-650 (9 February 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  The analysis identified “significant deviations from Pollock’s characteristics.” Taylor cautioned that the results should be “coupled with other important information such as provenance, connoisseurship and materials analysis.” Two years later, materials scientists showed that pigments on the paintings dated from after Pollock’s death.
 
In 2006, the use of fractals to authenticate Pollocks stirred controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Jones-Smith et al, “Fractal Analysis: Revisiting Pollock’s Paintings”Nature, Brief Communication Arising, vol. 444, E9-10, (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="R.P. Taylor 2006"&gt;R.P. Taylor et al, “Fractal Analysis: Revisiting Pollock’s Paintings” Nature, Brief Communication Arising, vol. 444, E10-11, (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="J. Rehmeyer, 2007"/&gt; This controversy was triggered by physicists Katherine Jones-Smith and Harsh Mathur who claimed that the fractal characteristics identified by Taylor et al. are also present in crude sketches made in [[Adobe Photoshop]],&lt;ref name="kate2006nature"&gt;[Jones-Smith, Katherine. "Revisiting Pollock's Drip Paintings." Nature 444.7119 (2006): E9-E10. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt; and deliberately fraudulent poured paintings made by other artists&lt;ref name="kate2006nature" /&gt;&lt;ref name="physrevE"&gt;[ Jones-Smith, Katherine, Harsh Mathur, and Lawrence M. Krauss. "Drip paintings and fractal analysis." Physical Review E 79.4 (2009): 046111. ]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, according to Jones-Smith and Mathur, labeling Pollock's paintings as "fractal" is meaningless, because the same characteristics are found in other non-fractal images. However, Taylor's rebuttal published in Nature&lt;ref name="R.P. Taylor 2006"/&gt; showed that Taylor's group's fractal analysis could distinguish between Pollock paintings and the crude sketches, and identified further limitations in Jones-Smith and Mathur's analysis.

Jones-Smith and Mathur raised a valid concern applicable to all forms of fractal expressionism: are art works too small for the painted patterns to repeat over sufficient magnifications to assume the visual characteristics of fractals? In the case of Pollock paintings, the largest range used by Taylor et al. to determine each fractal parameter in a Pollock painting is less than two orders of magnitude in magnification. Nature's fractals repeat over limited magnification ranges (typically just over one order of magnitude), prompting scientists to debate what range is required to reliably establish fractal behavior.&lt;ref name="Ave/Man"&gt;[Avnir, David, Ofer Biham, Daniel M. Lidar, and Ofer Malcai. "Is the Geometry of Nature Fractal?" Science 279.5347 (1998): 39-40. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt; Mandelbrot refused to include a required magnification range in his definition of fractals and instead noted that it is the range necessary to generate the properties associated with fractal repetition. In the case of Pollock's work, this would be the magnification range necessary for the patterns to generate the fractal aesthetics. Neuroscience experiments have shown that this magnification range is less than two orders and that Pollock’s paintings do indeed induce the same physiological responses as nature’s fractals and mathematical fractals&lt;ref name="R.P. Taylor, B. Spehar 2011"/&gt; Mandelbrot concluded "I do believe that Pollocks are fractal."&lt;ref name="J. Rehmeyer, 2007"/&gt;

At the time of the controversy, Coddington summarized as follows: “Fractal geometry has begun to play an important role in the authentication of the work of Jackson Pollock. We believe such analyses are necessary for pushing the field forward.”&lt;ref&gt;(J. Coddington et al, Proceedings SPIE, vol. 6810, 68100F 1-12, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent results, In 2015, by computer scientist Lior Shamir showed that, when combined with other pattern parameters, fractal analysis can be used to distinguish between real and imitation Pollocks with 93% accuracy. He found that the fractal parameters were the most powerful contributors to the detection accuracy&lt;ref&gt;L.

* ''K'' is closed under [[isomorphism]];
* ''K'' is closed under taking induced substructures;
* ''K'' has only countably many members up to isomorphism;

The '''hekat''' or '''heqat''' (transcribed ''HqA.t'') was an [[ancient Egyptian weights and measures|ancient Egyptian volume unit]] used to measure grain, bread, and beer. 
It equals 4.8&amp;nbsp;[[litre]]s in today's measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-06/afot-ajh060412.php|title=Ancient jugs hold the secret to practical mathematics in Biblical times|website=EurekAlert!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Until the New Kingdom (NK), the hekat was one tenth of a khar, later one sixteenth; while the New Kingdom ''oipe'' (transcribed ''ip.t'') contained 4&amp;nbsp;hekat. It was sub-divided into other units &amp;ndash; some for  medical prescriptions &amp;ndash; the   ''hin'' (1/10), ''dja'' (1/64) and ''ro'' (1/320). The ''dja'' was recently evaluated by Tanja Pommerening in 2002 to 1/64 of a hekat (75 cc) in the MK, and 1/64 of an oipe (1/16 of a hekat, or 300 cc) in the NK, meaning that the ''dja'' was denoted by Horus-Eye imagery. It has been suggested by Pommerening that the NK change came about related to the oipe replacing the hekat as the Pharaonic volume control unit in official lists.

Hana Vymazalova evaluated the hekat unit in 2002 within the [[Akhmim Wooden Tablet]] by showing that five answers were returned to (64/64) when multiplied by the divisors 3, 7, 10, 11 and 13. The [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus|RMP]] also divided a hekat unity (64/64) by prime and composite numbers ''n'' when 1/64&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;64. The binary quotient used [[Eye of Horus#In arithmetic|Eye of Horus]] numbers. The remainder scaled [[Egyptian fraction]]s to 1/320 units named ro. Quotients and unscaled remainders were obtained for the dja, ro and other units when the divisor ''n'' was greater than 64. For example, one the 1/320&amp;nbsp;ro unit was written by Ahmes by solving 320/n&amp;nbsp;ro. Gillings cites 29 examples of two-part statements converted to one-part statements in RMP 82. Ahmes recorded the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 case by showing (64/64)/3&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;21/64&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1/192 (a modern statement) as written as(16&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)/64&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5/3&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;1/320 =&amp;nbsp;1/4&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1/16&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1/64&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;2/3ro (two-part ancient statement). Two-part statements were also converted by Ahmes to an unscaled hin unit by writing&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;1/3&amp;nbsp;hin.

The hekat measurement unit, and its [[double entry accounting system]], was found beyond the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]]. Another text was the [[Ebers Papyrus]], the best known medical text. The hekat unit was defined, in terms of its volume size, in the [[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus]] by MMP #10, by approximating ''[[&amp;pi;]]'' to around 3.16. The approximation of ''&amp;pi;'' was achieved by squaring a circle, increasingly (i.e. for the denominator in terms of setats: 9, 18, 36, 72, and 81, Gillings, page 141) until the vulgar fraction 256/81 was reached, the only relationship that was used in the Egyptian Middle Kingdom. The MMP scribe found the surface area of a basket equal to: (8d/9)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; =&amp;nbsp;64d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/81, within a cylinder relationship to the hekat. MMP 10 data meant that ''d''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 defined ''&amp;pi;'' for use in hekat volumes as&amp;nbsp;256/81. The 256/81 approximation was also used by [[Ahmes]] and other scribes. The [[ancient Egyptian weights and measures]] discussion further shows that the hekat was 1/30 of a royal cubit&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, an analysis that needs to double checked, against the ''d''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 suggestion, which means that ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, a suggestion that does make sense. One royal cubit of the [[Ancient Egyptian weights and measures]] =&amp;nbsp;523.5&amp;nbsp;millimeters. ((523.5&amp;nbsp;mm)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;30 =&amp;nbsp;4.78221176&amp;nbsp;liters.

The area of study known as the '''history of mathematics''' is primarily an investigation into the origin of discoveries in [[mathematics]] and, to a lesser extent, an investigation into the [[History of mathematical notation|mathematical methods and notation of the past]]. Before the [[modern age]] and the worldwide spread of knowledge, written examples of new mathematical developments have come to light only in a few locales. From 3000 BC the [[Mesopotamian]] states of [[Sumer]], [[Akkad (region)|Akkad]] and [[Assyria]], together with [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Ebla]] began using [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]] and [[geometry]] for purposes of taxation, commerce, trade and also in the field of [[astronomy]] and to formulate [[calendars]] and record time.

The most ancient mathematical texts available are from [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] - ''[[Plimpton 322]]'' ([[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonian]] c. 1900 BC),&lt;ref&gt;J. Friberg, "Methods and traditions of Babylonian mathematics. Plimpton 322, Pythagorean triples, and the Babylonian triangle parameter equations", Historia Mathematica, 8, 1981, pp. 277–318.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]]'' ([[Egyptian mathematics|Egyptian]] c. 2000–1800 BC)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | edition = 2 | publisher = [[Dover Publications]] | last = Neugebauer | first = Otto | author-link = Otto E. Neugebauer | title = The Exact Sciences in Antiquity | origyear = 1957 | year = 1969 | isbn = 978-0486223322 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JVhTtVA2zr8C}} Chap. IV "Egyptian Mathematics and Astronomy", pp. 71–96.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus]]'' (Egyptian c. 1890 BC). All of these texts mention the so-called [[Pythagorean triple]]s and so, by inference, the [[Pythagorean theorem]], seems to be the most ancient and widespread mathematical development after basic arithmetic and geometry.

The study of mathematics as a "demonstrative discipline" begins in the 6th century BC with the [[Pythagoreans]], who coined the term "mathematics" from the ancient [[Greek language|Greek]] ''μάθημα'' (''mathema''), meaning "subject of instruction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Heath|title=A Manual of Greek Mathematics|journal=Nature|volume=128|issue=3235|page=5|bibcode=1931Natur.128..739T|year=1931|doi=10.1038/128739a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greek mathematics]] greatly refined the methods (especially through the introduction of deductive reasoning and [[mathematical rigor]] in [[mathematical proof|proofs]]) and expanded the subject matter of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Thomas L. Heath, ''A Manual of Greek Mathematics'', Dover, 1963, p. 1: "In the case of mathematics, it is the Greek contribution which it is most essential to know, for it was the Greeks who first made mathematics a science."&lt;/ref&gt; Although they made virtually no contributions to [[theoretical mathematics]], the [[ancient Romans]] used [[applied mathematics]] in [[surveying]], [[structural engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[bookkeeping]], creation of [[Lunar calendar|lunar]] and [[solar calendar]]s, and even [[Roman art|arts and crafts]]. [[Chinese mathematics]] made early contributions, including a [[place value system]] and the first use of [[negative numbers]].&lt;ref&gt;George Gheverghese Joseph, ''The Crest of the Peacock: Non-European Roots of Mathematics'', Penguin Books, London, 1991, pp. 140–48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georges Ifrah, ''Universalgeschichte der Zahlen'', Campus, Frankfurt/New York, 1986, pp. 428–37&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]] and the rules for the use of its operations, in use throughout the world today evolved over the course of the first millennium AD in [[Indian mathematics|India]] and were transmitted to the [[Western world]] via [[Islamic mathematics]] through the work of [[Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kaplan, "The Nothing That Is: A Natural History of Zero", Allen Lane/The Penguin Press, London, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The ingenious method of expressing every possible number using a set of ten symbols (each symbol having a place value and an absolute value) emerged in India. The idea seems so simple nowadays that its significance and profound importance is no longer appreciated. Its simplicity lies in the way it facilitated calculation and placed arithmetic foremost amongst useful inventions. the importance of this invention is more readily appreciated when one considers that it was beyond the two greatest men of Antiquity, Archimedes and Apollonius." – Pierre Simon Laplace http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Indian_numerals.html&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic mathematics, in turn, developed and expanded the mathematics known to these civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adolf Yushkevich|A.P. Juschkewitsch]], "Geschichte der Mathematik im Mittelalter", Teubner, Leipzig, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporaneous with but independent of these traditions were the mathematics developed by the [[Maya civilization]] of [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]], where the concept of [[zero]] was given a standard symbol in [[Maya numerals]].

Many Greek and Arabic texts on mathematics were [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]] from the 12th century onward, leading to further development of mathematics in [[Middle Ages|Medieval Europe]]. From ancient times through the [[Postclassical age|Middle Ages]], periods of mathematical discovery were often followed by centuries of stagnation. Beginning in [[Renaissance]] [[Italy]] in the 15th century, new mathematical developments, interacting with new scientific discoveries, were made at an [[exponential growth|increasing pace]] that continues through the present day. This includes the groundbreaking work of both [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in the development of infinitesimal [[calculus]] during the course of the 17th century. At the end of the 19th century the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] was founded and continues to spearhead advances in the field.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The origins of mathematical thought lie in the concepts of [[number]], [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]], and [[Configuration (geometry)|form]].&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Origins p. 3"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Origins" p. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern studies of animal cognition have shown that these concepts are not unique to humans. Such concepts would have been part of everyday life in hunter-gatherer societies. The idea of the "number" concept evolving gradually over time is supported by the existence of languages which preserve the distinction between "one", "two", and "many", but not of numbers larger than two.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Origins p. 3"/&gt;

[[Babylonia]]n mathematics refers to any mathematics of the peoples of [[Mesopotamia]] (modern [[Iraq]]) from the days of the early [[Sumer]]ians through the [[Hellenistic period]] almost to the dawn of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Mesopotamia" p. 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Babylonian mathematical work comes from two widely separated periods: The first few hundred years of the second millennium BC (Old Babylonian period), and the last few centuries of the first millennium BC ([[Seleucid]] period).&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 26"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Mesopotamia" p. 26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is named Babylonian mathematics due to the central role of [[Babylon]] as a place of study. Later under the [[Caliphate|Arab Empire]], Mesopotamia, especially [[Baghdad]], once again became an important center of study for [[Islamic mathematics]].

[[File:Geometry problem-Sb 13088-IMG 0593-white.jpg|thumb|Geometry problem on a clay tablet belonging to a school for scribes; [[Susa]], first half of the 2nd millennium BCE]]
In contrast to the sparsity of sources in [[Egyptian mathematics]], our knowledge of Babylonian mathematics is derived from more than 400 clay tablets unearthed since the 1850s.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 25"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Mesopotamia" p. 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written in [[Cuneiform script]], tablets were inscribed whilst the clay was moist, and baked hard in an oven or by the heat of the sun. Some of these appear to be graded homework.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 41"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Mesopotamia" p. 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest evidence of written mathematics dates back to the ancient [[Sumer]]ians, who built the earliest civilization in Mesopotamia. They developed a complex system of [[metrology]] from 3000 BC. From around 2500 BC onwards, the Sumerians wrote [[multiplication table]]s on clay tablets and dealt with [[geometry|geometrical]] exercises and [[Division (mathematics)|division]] problems. The earliest traces of the Babylonian numerals also date back to this period.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan J. Melville (2003).

Babylonian mathematics were written using a [[sexagesimal]] (base-60) [[numeral system]].&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 25"/&gt; From this derives the modern day usage of 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 360 (60 x 6) degrees in a circle, as well as the use of seconds and minutes of arc to denote fractions of a degree. It is likely the sexagesimal system was chosen because 60 can be evenly divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20 and 30.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 25"/&gt; Also, unlike the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, the Babylonians had a true place-value system, where digits written in the left column represented larger values, much as in the [[decimal]] system.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 26"/&gt; The power of the Babylonian notational system lay in that it could be used to represent fractions as easily as whole numbers; thus multiplying two numbers that contained fractions was no different than multiplying integers, similar to our modern notation.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 26"/&gt; The notational system of the Babylonians was the best of any civilization until the [[Renaissance]],&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 27"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Mesopotamia" p. 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its power allowed it to achieve remarkable computation accuracy and power; for example, the Babylonian tablet [[YBC 7289]] gives an approximation of {{radic|2}} accurate to five decimal places.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 27"/&gt; The Babylonians lacked, however, an equivalent of the decimal point, and so the place value of a symbol often had to be inferred from the context.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 26"/&gt; By the Seleucid period, the Babylonians had developed a zero symbol as a placeholder for empty positions; however it was only used for intermediate positions.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 26"/&gt; This zero sign does not appear in terminal positions, thus the Babylonians came close but did not develop a true place value system.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 26"/&gt;

Other topics covered by Babylonian mathematics include fractions, algebra, quadratic and cubic equations, and the calculation of [[Regular number|regular]] [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] [[Twin prime|pairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Aaboe | last = Aaboe | first = Asger | title = Episodes from the Early History of Mathematics | year = 1998 | publisher = Random House | location = New York | pages = 30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tablets also include multiplication tables and methods for solving [[linear equation|linear]], [[quadratic equation]]s and [[cubic equation]]s, a remarkable achievement for the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Mesopotamia" p. 33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tablets from the Old Babylonian period also contain the earliest known statement of the [[Pythagorean theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Mesopotamia" p. 39}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as with Egyptian mathematics, Babylonian mathematics shows no awareness of the difference between exact and approximate solutions, or the solvability of a problem, and most importantly, no explicit statement of the need for [[mathematical proof|proofs]] or logical principles.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 41"/&gt;

[[Egypt]]ian mathematics refers to mathematics written in the [[Egyptian language]]. From the [[Hellenistic period]], [[Greek language|Greek]] replaced Egyptian as the written language of [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] scholars. Mathematical study in [[Egypt]] later continued under the [[Caliphate|Arab Empire]] as part of [[Islamic mathematics]], when [[Arabic]] became the written language of Egyptian scholars.

The most extensive Egyptian mathematical text is the [[Rhind papyrus]] (sometimes also called the Ahmes Papyrus after its author), dated to c. 1650 BC but likely a copy of an older document from the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] of about 2000–1800 BC.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Egypt p. 11"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Egypt" p. 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an instruction manual for students in arithmetic and geometry. In addition to giving area formulas and methods for multiplication, division and working with unit fractions, it also contains evidence of other mathematical knowledge,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath340/kmath340.htm Egyptian Unit Fractions] at MathPages&lt;/ref&gt; including [[composite number|composite]] and [[prime number]]s; [[arithmetic mean|arithmetic]], [[geometric mean|geometric]] and [[harmonic mean]]s; and simplistic understandings of both the [[Sieve of Eratosthenes]] and [[Perfect number|perfect number theory]] (namely, that of the number 6).&lt;ref&gt;[&lt;!-- http://mathpages.com/home/rhind.htm --&gt;http://mathpages.com/home/kmath340/kmath340.htm Egyptian Unit Fractions]&lt;/ref&gt; It also shows how to solve first order [[linear equation]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/HistTopics/Egyptian_papyri.html Egyptian Papyri&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[arithmetic series|arithmetic]] and [[geometric series]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/Ancient-Africa/mad_ancient_egypt_algebra.html#areithmetic%20series Egyptian Algebra – Mathematicians of the African Diaspora&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another significant Egyptian mathematical text is the [[Moscow papyrus]], also from the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] period, dated to c. 1890 BC.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Egypt p. 19"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Egypt" p. 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of what are today called ''word problems'' or ''story problems'', which were apparently intended as entertainment. One problem is considered to be of particular importance because it gives a method for finding the volume of a [[frustum]] (truncated pyramid).

Finally, the [[Berlin Papyrus 6619]] (c. 1800 BC) shows that ancient Egyptians could solve a second-order [[algebraic equation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/Ancient-Africa/mad_ancient_egyptpapyrus.html#berlin Egyptian Mathematical Papyri – Mathematicians of the African Diaspora&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Greek mathematics}}
[[File:Pythagorean.svg|thumb|left|The [[Pythagorean theorem]]. The [[Pythagoreans]] are generally credited with the first proof of the theorem.]]
Greek mathematics refers to the mathematics written in the [[Greek language]] from the time of [[Thales of Miletus]] (~600 BC) to the closure of the [[Platonic Academy|Academy of Athens]] in 529 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Eves, ''An Introduction to the History of Mathematics'', Saunders, 1990, {{ISBN|0030295580}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek mathematicians lived in cities spread over the entire Eastern Mediterranean, from Italy to North Africa, but were united by culture and language. Greek mathematics of the period following [[Alexander the Great]] is sometimes called [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Age of Plato and Aristotle" p. 99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek mathematics was much more sophisticated than the mathematics that had been developed by earlier cultures. All surviving records of pre-Greek mathematics show the use of inductive reasoning, that is, repeated observations used to establish rules of thumb. Greek mathematicians, by contrast, used deductive reasoning. The Greeks used logic to derive conclusions from definitions and axioms, and used [[mathematical rigor]] to [[mathematical proof|prove]] them.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Bernal, "Animadversions on the Origins of Western Science", pp. 72–83 in Michael H. Shank, ed., ''The Scientific Enterprise in Antiquity and the Middle Ages'', (Chicago: University of Chicago Press) 2000, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek mathematics is thought to have begun with [[Thales of Miletus]] (c. 624–c.546 BC) and [[Pythagoras of Samos]] (c. 582–c. 507 BC). Although the extent of the influence is disputed, they were probably inspired by [[Egyptian mathematics|Egyptian]] and [[Babylonian mathematics]]. According to legend, Pythagoras traveled to Egypt to learn mathematics, geometry, and astronomy from Egyptian priests.

Thales used [[geometry]] to solve problems such as calculating the height of [[pyramids]] and the distance of ships from the shore. He is credited with the first use of deductive reasoning applied to geometry, by deriving four corollaries to [[Thales' Theorem]]. As a result, he has been hailed as the first true mathematician and the first known individual to whom a mathematical discovery has been attributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Ionia and the Pythagoreans" p. 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pythagoras established the [[Pythagoreans|Pythagorean School]], whose doctrine it was that mathematics ruled the universe and whose motto was "All is number".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Ionia and the Pythagoreans" p. 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the Pythagoreans who coined the term "mathematics", and with whom the study of mathematics for its own sake begins. The Pythagoreans are credited with the first proof of the [[Pythagorean theorem]],&lt;ref&gt;Eves, Howard, An Introduction to the History of Mathematics, Saunders, 1990, {{ISBN|0030295580}}.&lt;/ref&gt; though the statement of the theorem has a long history, and with the proof of the existence of [[irrational numbers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Discovery of Incommensurability by Hippasus of Metapontum|author=Kurt Von Fritz|journal=The Annals of Mathematics|year=1945|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Pentagram and the Discovery of an Irrational Number|journal=The Two-Year College Mathematics Journal|author=James R. Choike|year=1980|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was preceded by the [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonians]] and the [[Chinese mathematics|Chinese]],&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt; the [[Neopythagorean]] mathematician [[Nicomachus]] (60–120 AD) provided one of the earliest [[Greco-Roman]] [[multiplication table]]s, whereas the oldest extant Greek multiplication table is found on a wax tablet dated to the 1st century AD (now found in the [[British Museum]]).&lt;ref&gt;David E. Smith (1958), ''History of Mathematics, Volume I: General Survey of the History of Elementary Mathematics'', New York: Dover Publications (a reprint of the 1951 publication), {{ISBN|0486204294}}, pp. 58, 129.&lt;/ref&gt; The association of the Neopythagoreans with the Western invention of the multiplication table is evident in its later [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] name: the ''mensa Pythagorica''.&lt;ref&gt;David E. Smith (1958), ''History of Mathematics, Volume I: General Survey of the History of Elementary Mathematics'', New York: Dover Publications (a reprint of the 1951 publication), {{ISBN|0486204294}}, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]] (428/427 BC – 348/347 BC) is important in the history of mathematics for inspiring and guiding others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Age of Plato and Aristotle" p. 86}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Platonic Academy]], in [[Athens]], became the mathematical center of the world in the 4th century BC, and it was from this school that the leading mathematicians of the day, such as [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]], came.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=The Age of Plato and Aristotle p. 88"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Age of Plato and Aristotle" p. 88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plato also discussed the foundations of mathematics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Calian |first=George F. |year=2014 |url=http://www.nec.ro/pdfs/publications/odobleja/2013-2014/FLORIN%20GEORGE%20CALIAN.pdf |title=One, Two, Three… A Discussion on the Generation of Numbers |publisher=New Europe College |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015233836/http://www.nec.ro/pdfs/publications/odobleja/2013-2014/FLORIN%20GEORGE%20CALIAN.pdf |archivedate=2015-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; clarified some of the definitions (e.g. that of a line as "breadthless length"), and reorganized the assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Age of Plato and Aristotle" p. 87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[mathematical analysis|analytic method]] is ascribed to Plato, while a formula for obtaining Pythagorean triples bears his name.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=The Age of Plato and Aristotle p. 88"/&gt;

[[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] (408–c. 355 BC) developed the [[method of exhaustion]], a precursor of modern [[Integral|integration]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Age of Plato and Aristotle" p. 92}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a theory of ratios that avoided the problem of [[incommensurable magnitudes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Age of Plato and Aristotle" p. 93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former allowed the calculations of areas and volumes of curvilinear figures,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Age of Plato and Aristotle" p. 91}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the latter enabled subsequent geometers to make significant advances in geometry. Though he made no specific technical mathematical discoveries, [[Aristotle]] (384–c. 322 BC) contributed significantly to the development of mathematics by laying the foundations of [[logic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Age of Plato and Aristotle" p. 98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 3rd century BC, the premier center of mathematical education and research was the [[Musaeum]] of [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Euclid of Alexandria" p. 100}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was there that [[Euclid]] (c. 300 BC) taught, and wrote the ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', widely considered the most successful and influential textbook of all time.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Euclid of Alexandria p. 119"/&gt; The ''Elements'' introduced [[mathematical rigor]] through the [[axiomatic method]] and is the earliest example of the format still used in mathematics today, that of definition, axiom, theorem, and proof. Although most of the contents of the ''Elements'' were already known, Euclid arranged them into a single, coherent logical framework.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Euclid of Alexandria p. 104"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Euclid of Alexandria" p. 104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Elements'' was known to all educated people in the West until the middle of the 20th century and its contents are still taught in geometry classes today.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Eves, ''An Introduction to the History of Mathematics'', Saunders, 1990, {{ISBN|0030295580}} p. 141: "No work, except [[The Bible]], has been more widely used...."&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the familiar theorems of [[Euclidean geometry]], the ''Elements'' was meant as an introductory textbook to all mathematical subjects of the time, such as [[number theory]], [[algebra]] and [[solid geometry]],&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=Euclid of Alexandria p. 104"/&gt; including proofs that the square root of two is irrational and that there are infinitely many prime numbers. Euclid also [[Euclid#Other works|wrote extensively]] on other subjects, such as [[conic sections]], [[optics]], [[spherical geometry]], and mechanics, but only half of his writings survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Euclid of Alexandria" p. 102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Archimedes pi.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Archimedes used the [[method of exhaustion]] to approximate the value of [[pi]].]]
[[Archimedes]] (c. 287–212 BC) of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], widely considered the greatest mathematician of antiquity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Archimedes of Syracuse" p. 120}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the [[method of exhaustion]] to calculate the [[area]] under the arc of a [[parabola]] with the [[Series (mathematics)|summation of an infinite series]], in a manner not too dissimilar from modern calculus.&lt;ref name="Boyer1991"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Archimedes of Syracuse" p. 130}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also showed one could use the method of exhaustion to calculate the value of [[pi|π]] with as much precision as desired, and obtained the most accurate value of π then known, {{nowrap|3{{sfrac|10|71}} &lt; π &lt; 3{{sfrac|10|70}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Archimedes of Syracuse" p. 126}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied the [[Archimedes spiral|spiral]] bearing his name, obtained formulas for the [[volume]]s of [[surface of revolution|surfaces of revolution]] (paraboloid, ellipsoid, hyperboloid),&lt;ref name="Boyer1991" /&gt; and an ingenious method of [[exponentiation]] for expressing very large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Archimedes of Syracuse" p. 125}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he is also known for his contributions to physics and several advanced mechanical devices, Archimedes himself placed far greater value on the products of his thought and general mathematical principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Archimedes of Syracuse" p. 121}}&lt;/ref&gt; He regarded as his greatest achievement his finding of the surface area and volume of a sphere, which he obtained by proving these are 2/3 the surface area and volume of a cylinder circumscribing the sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Archimedes of Syracuse" p. 137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Conic sections 2.png|thumb|right|upright=1.25|[[Apollonius of Perga]] made significant advances in the study of [[conic sections]].]]
[[Apollonius of Perga]] (c. 262–190 BC) made significant advances to the study of [[conic sections]], showing that one can obtain all three varieties of conic section by varying the angle of the plane that cuts a double-napped cone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Apollonius of Perga" p. 145}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also coined the terminology in use today for conic sections, namely [[parabola]] ("place beside" or "comparison"), "ellipse" ("deficiency"), and "hyperbola" ("a throw beyond").&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Apollonius of Perga" p. 146}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work ''Conics'' is one of the best known and preserved mathematical works from antiquity, and in it he derives many theorems concerning conic sections that would prove invaluable to later mathematicians and astronomers studying planetary motion, such as Isaac Newton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Apollonius of Perga" p. 152}}&lt;/ref&gt; While neither Apollonius nor any other Greek mathematicians made the leap to coordinate geometry, Apollonius' treatment of curves is in some ways similar to the modern treatment, and some of his work seems to anticipate the development of analytical geometry by Descartes some 1800 years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Apollonius of Perga" p. 156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time, [[Eratosthenes of Cyrene]] (c. 276–194 BC) devised the [[Sieve of Eratosthenes]] for finding [[prime numbers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration" p. 161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 3rd century BC is generally regarded as the "Golden Age" of Greek mathematics, with advances in pure mathematics henceforth in relative decline.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration" p. 175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in the centuries that followed significant advances were made in applied mathematics, most notably [[trigonometry]], largely to address the needs of astronomers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; [[Hipparchus of Nicaea]] (c. 190–120 BC) is considered the founder of trigonometry for compiling the first known trigonometric table, and to him is also due the systematic use of the 360 degree circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration" p. 162}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heron of Alexandria]] (c. 10–70 AD) is credited with [[Heron's formula]] for finding the area of a scalene triangle and with being the first to recognize the possibility of negative numbers possessing square roots.&lt;ref&gt;S.C.

AD 90–168), a landmark astronomical treatise whose trigonometric tables would be used by astronomers for the next thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration" p. 164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ptolemy is also credited with [[Ptolemy's theorem]] for deriving trigonometric quantities, and the most accurate value of π outside of China until the medieval period, 3.1416.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration" p. 168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Diophantus-cover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Title page of the 1621 edition of Diophantus' ''Arithmetica'', translated into [[Latin]] by [[Claude Gaspard Bachet de Méziriac]].]]
Following a period of stagnation after Ptolemy, the period between 250 and 350 AD is sometimes referred to as the "Silver Age" of Greek mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics" p. 178}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, [[Diophantus]] made significant advances in [[algebra]], particularly [[indeterminate equation|indeterminate analysis]], which is also known as "Diophantine analysis".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics" p. 180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of [[Diophantine equations]] and [[Diophantine approximations]] is a significant area of research to this day. His main work was the ''Arithmetica'', a collection of 150 algebraic problems dealing with exact solutions to determinate and [[indeterminate equation]]s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics" p. 181}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Arithmetica'' had a significant influence on later mathematicians, such as [[Pierre de Fermat]], who arrived at his famous [[Fermat's Last Theorem|Last Theorem]] after trying to generalize a problem he had read in the ''Arithmetica'' (that of dividing a square into two squares).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics" p. 183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diophantus also made significant advances in notation, the ''Arithmetica'' being the first instance of algebraic symbolism and syncopation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

[[File:Hagia Sophia Mars 2013.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Haghia Sophia]] was designed by mathematicians [[Anthemius of Tralles]] and [[Isidore of Miletus]].]]
Among the last great Greek mathematicians is [[Pappus of Alexandria]] (4th  century AD).  He is known for his [[Pappus's hexagon theorem|hexagon theorem]] and [[Pappus's centroid theorem|centroid theorem]], as well as the [[Pappus configuration]] and [[Pappus graph]]. His ''Collection'' is a major source of knowledge on Greek mathematics as most of it has survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics" pp. 183–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pappus is considered the last major innovator in Greek mathematics, with subsequent work consisting mostly of commentaries on earlier work.

The first woman mathematician recorded by history was [[Hypatia]] of Alexandria (AD 350–415). She succeeded her father ([[Theon of Alexandria]]) as Librarian at the Great Library{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} and wrote many works on applied mathematics. Because of a political dispute, the [[Christianity in the Roman Empire|Christian community]] in Alexandria had her stripped publicly and executed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/halsall/source/hypatia.asp Medieval Sourcebook: Socrates Scholasticus: The Murder of Hypatia (late 4th Cent.) from Ecclesiastical History, Bk VI: Chap. 15]&lt;/ref&gt; Her death is sometimes taken as the end of the era of the Alexandrian Greek mathematics, although work did continue in Athens for another century with figures such as [[Proclus]], [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]] and [[Eutocius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics" pp. 190–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Proclus and Simplicius were more philosophers than mathematicians, their commentaries on earlier works are valuable sources on Greek mathematics.  The closure of the neo-Platonic [[Platonic Academy|Academy of Athens]] by the emperor [[Justinian]] in 529 AD is traditionally held as marking the end of the era of Greek mathematics, although the Greek tradition continued unbroken in the [[Byzantine empire]] with mathematicians such as [[Anthemius of Tralles]] and [[Isidore of Miletus]], the architects of the [[Haghia Sophia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics" p. 193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, Byzantine mathematics consisted mostly of commentaries, with little in the way of innovation, and the centers of mathematical innovation were to be found elsewhere by this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics" p. 194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using calculation, Romans were adept at both instigating and detecting financial [[fraud]], as well as [[List of Roman taxes|managing taxes]] for the [[treasury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Cuomo|2001|p=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Siculus Flaccus]], one of the Roman ''[[gromatici]]'' (i.e. land surveyor), wrote the ''Categories of Fields'', which aided Roman surveyors in measuring the [[surface area]]s of allotted lands and territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Cuomo|2001|pp=207–08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from managing trade and taxes, the Romans also regularly applied mathematics to solve problems in [[Roman engineering|engineering]], including the erection of [[Roman architecture|architecture]] such as [[Roman bridge|bridges]], [[Roman roads|road-building]], and [[Roman military engineering|preparation for military campaigns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Goodman|2016|pp=119–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman art|Arts and crafts]] such as [[Roman mosaic]]s, inspired by previous [[Mosaics of Delos|Greek designs]], created illusionist geometric patterns and rich, detailed scenes that required precise measurements for each [[tessera]] tile, the [[opus tessellatum]] pieces on average measuring eight millimeters square and the finer [[opus vermiculatum]] pieces having an average surface of four millimeters square.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Tang|2005|pp=14–15, 45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Joyce|1979|p=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of the [[Roman calendar]] also necessitated basic mathematics. The first calendar allegedly dates back to 8th century BC during the [[Roman Kingdom]] and included 356 days plus a [[leap year]] every other year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Gullberg|1997|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the [[lunar calendar]] of the Republican era contained 355 days, roughly ten-and-one-fourth days shorter than the [[solar year]], a discrepancy that was solved by adding an extra month into the calendar after the 23rd of February.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Gullberg|1997|pp=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This calendar was supplanted by the [[Julian calendar]], a [[solar calendar]] organized by [[Julius Caesar]] (100–44 BC) and devised by [[Sosigenes of Alexandria]] to include a [[leap day]] every four years in a 365-day cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Gullberg|1997|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This calendar, which contained an error of 11 minutes and 14 seconds, was later corrected by the [[Gregorian calendar]] organized by [[Pope Gregory XIII]] ({{reign|1572|1585}}), virtually the same solar calendar used in modern times as the international standard calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Gullberg|1997|pp=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At roughly the same time, [[Science and technology of the Han dynasty|the Han Chinese]] and the Romans both invented the wheeled [[odometer]] device for measuring [[distance]]s traveled, the Roman model first described by the Roman civil engineer and architect [[Vitruvius]] (c. 80 BC - c. 15 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Needham|Wang|2000|pp=281–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device was used at least until the reign of emperor [[Commodus]] ({{reign|177|192 AD}}), but its design seems to have been lost until experiments were made during the 15th century in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Needham|Wang|2000|p=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps relying on similar gear-work and [[Roman technology|technology]] found in the [[Antikythera mechanism]], the odometer of Vitruvius featured chariot wheels measuring 4 feet (1.2 m) in diameter turning four-hundred times in one [[Roman mile]] (roughly 4590&amp;nbsp;ft/1400 m). With each revolution, a pin-and-axle device engaged a 400-tooth [[cogwheel]] that turned a second gear responsible for dropping pebbles into a box, each pebble representing one mile traversed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Sleeswyk|1981|pp=188–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chounumerals.svg|thumb|left|[[Counting rod numerals]]]]
Of particular note is the use in Chinese mathematics of a decimal positional notation system, the so-called "rod numerals" in which distinct ciphers were used for numbers between 1 and 10, and additional ciphers for powers of ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Katz|2007|pp=194–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the number 123 would be written using the symbol for "1", followed by the symbol for "100", then the symbol for "2" followed by the symbol for "10", followed by the symbol for "3". This was the most advanced number system in the world at the time, apparently in use several centuries before the common era and well before the development of the Indian numeral system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="China and India" p. 198}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Counting rods|Rod numerals]] allowed the representation of numbers as large as desired and allowed calculations to be carried out on the ''[[suanpan|suan pan]]'', or Chinese abacus. The date of the invention of the ''suan pan'' is not certain, but the earliest written mention dates from AD 190, in [[Xu Yue]]'s ''Supplementary Notes on the Art of Figures''.

The oldest existent work on [[geometry]] in China comes from the philosophical [[Mohism|Mohist]] canon c. 330 BC, compiled by the followers of [[Mozi]] (470–390 BC). The ''Mo Jing'' described various aspects of many fields associated with physical science, and provided a small number of geometrical theorems as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Needham|Wang|1995|pp=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also defined the concepts of [[circumference]], [[diameter]], [[radius]], and [[volume]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Needham|Wang|1995|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:九章算術.gif|thumb|upright|right|''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'', one of the earliest surviving mathematical texts from [[China]] (2nd century AD).]]
In 212 BC, the Emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]] commanded all books in the [[Qin Empire]] other than officially sanctioned ones be burned. This decree was not universally obeyed, but as a consequence of this order little is known about ancient Chinese mathematics before this date. After the [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|book burning]] of 212 BC, the [[Han dynasty]] (202 BC–220 AD) produced works of mathematics which presumably expanded on works that are now lost. The most important of these is ''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'', the full title of which appeared by AD 179, but existed in part under other titles beforehand. It consists of 246 word problems involving agriculture, business, employment of geometry to figure height spans and dimension ratios for [[Chinese pagoda]] towers, engineering, [[surveying]], and includes material on [[right triangle]]s.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=China and India p. 196"/&gt; It created mathematical proof for the [[Pythagorean theorem]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Needham|Wang|1995|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a mathematical formula for [[Gaussian elimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Straffin|1998|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatise also provides values of [[π]],&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=China and India p. 196"/&gt; which Chinese mathematicians originally approximated as 3 until [[Liu Xin (scholar)|Liu Xin]] (d. 23 AD) provided a figure of 3.1457 and subsequently [[Zhang Heng]] (78–139) approximated pi as 3.1724,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Needham|Wang|1995|pp=99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as 3.162 by taking the [[square root]] of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Berggren|Borwein|Borwein|2004|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Crespigny|2007|p=1050}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liu Hui]] commented on the ''Nine Chapters'' in the 3rd century AD and [[Liu Hui's π algorithm|gave a value of π]] accurate to 5 decimal places (i.e. 3.14159).&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=China and India p. 202"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="China and India" p. 202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Needham|Wang|1995|pp=100–01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though more of a matter of computational stamina than theoretical insight, in the 5th century AD [[Zu Chongzhi]] computed [[Milü|the value of π]] to seven decimal places (i.e. 3.141592), which remained the most accurate value of π for almost the next 1000 years.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=China and India p. 202"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Berggren|Borwein|Borwein|2004|pp=20, 24–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also established a method which would later be called [[Cavalieri's principle]] to find the volume of a [[sphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The high-water mark of Chinese mathematics occurred in the 13th century during the latter half of the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279), with the development of Chinese algebra. The most important text from that period is the ''[[Jade Mirror of the Four Unknowns|Precious Mirror of the Four Elements]]'' by [[Zhu Shijie]] (1249–1314), dealing with the solution of simultaneous higher order algebraic equations using a method similar to [[Horner's method]].&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=China and India p. 202"/&gt; The ''Precious Mirror'' also contains a diagram of [[Pascal's triangle]] with coefficients of binomial expansions through the eighth power, though both appear in Chinese works as early as 1100.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=China and India p. 205"&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="China and India" p. 205}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese also made use of the complex combinatorial diagram known as the [[magic square]] and [[Magic circle (mathematics)|magic circles]], described in ancient times and perfected by [[Yang Hui]] (AD 1238–1298).&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=China and India p. 205" /&gt;

Even after European mathematics began to flourish during the [[Renaissance]], European and Chinese mathematics were separate traditions, with significant Chinese mathematical output in decline from the 13th century onwards. [[Jesuit]] missionaries such as [[Matteo Ricci]] carried mathematical ideas back and forth between the two cultures from the 16th to 18th centuries, though at this point far more mathematical ideas were entering China than leaving.&lt;ref name="Boyer 1991 loc=China and India p. 205"/&gt;

[[Japanese mathematics]], [[Korean numerals|Korean mathematics]], and [[Vietnamese numerals|Vietnamese mathematics]] are traditionally viewed as stemming from Chinese mathematics and belonging to the [[Confucian]]-based [[East Asian cultural sphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Volkov|2009|pp=153–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korean and Japanese mathematics were heavily influenced by the algebraic works produced during China's Song dynasty, whereas Vietnamese mathematics was heavily indebted to popular works of China's [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Volkov|2009|pp=154–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, although Vietnamese mathematical treatises were written in either [[Chinese characters|Chinese]] or the native Vietnamese [[Chữ Nôm]] script, all of them followed the Chinese format of presenting a collection of problems with [[algorithm]]s for solving them, followed by numerical answers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Volkov|2009|pp=156–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematics in Vietnam and Korea were mostly associated with the professional court bureaucracy of [[History of astronomy|mathematicians and astronomers]], whereas in Japan it was more prevalent in the realm of [[private school]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Volkov|2009|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest civilization on the Indian subcontinent is the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (mature phase: 2600 to 1900 BC) that flourished in the [[Indus river]] basin.

The next significant mathematical documents from India after the ''Sulba Sutras'' are the ''Siddhantas'', astronomical treatises from the 4th and 5th centuries AD ([[Gupta period]]) showing strong Hellenistic influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="China and India" p. 208}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are significant in that they contain the first instance of trigonometric relations based on the half-chord, as is the case in modern trigonometry, rather than the full chord, as was the case in Ptolemaic trigonometry.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="China and India" p. 209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through a series of translation errors, the words "sine" and "cosine" derive from the Sanskrit "jiya" and "kojiya".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Around 500 AD, [[Aryabhata]] wrote the ''[[Aryabhatiya]]'', a slim volume, written in verse, intended to supplement the rules of calculation used in astronomy and mathematical mensuration, though with no feeling for logic or deductive methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="China and India" p. 210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though about half of the entries are wrong, it is in the ''Aryabhatiya'' that the decimal place-value system first appears.

In the 7th century, [[Brahmagupta]] identified the [[Brahmagupta theorem]], [[Brahmagupta's identity]] and [[Brahmagupta's formula]], and for the first time, in ''[[Brahmasphutasiddhanta|Brahma-sphuta-siddhanta]]'', he lucidly explained the use of [[0 (number)|zero]] as both a placeholder and [[decimal digit]], and explained the [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]].&lt;ref name="Boyer Siddhanta"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyer|authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer|title=History of Mathematics|year=1991|chapter=The Arabic Hegemony|page=226|quote=By 766 we learn that an astronomical-mathematical work, known to the Arabs as the ''Sindhind'', was brought to Baghdad from India.

A few years later, perhaps about 775, this ''Siddhanata'' was translated into Arabic, and it was not long afterwards (ca. 780) that Ptolemy's astrological ''[[Tetrabiblos]]'' was translated into Arabic from the Greek.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was from a translation of this Indian text on mathematics (c. 770) that Islamic mathematicians were introduced to this numeral system, which they adapted as [[Arabic numerals]]. Islamic scholars carried knowledge of this number system to Europe by the 12th century, and it has now displaced all older number systems throughout the world. Various symbol sets are used to represent numbers in the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, all of which evolved from the [[Brahmi numeral]]s. Each of the roughly dozen major scripts of India has its own numeral glyphs. In the 10th century, [[Halayudha]]'s commentary on [[Pingala]]'s work contains a study of the [[Fibonacci sequence]] and [[Pascal's triangle]], and describes the formation of a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

In the 12th century, [[Bhāskara II]]&lt;ref&gt;Plofker 2009 182–207&lt;/ref&gt; lived in southern India and wrote extensively on all then known branches of mathematics. His work contains mathematical objects equivalent or approximately equivalent to infinitesimals, derivatives, [[Mean value theorem|the mean value theorem]] and the derivative of the sine function. To what extent he anticipated the invention of calculus is a controversial subject among historians of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Plofker 2009 pp. 197–98; George Gheverghese Joseph, ''The Crest of the Peacock: Non-European Roots of Mathematics'', Penguin Books, London, 1991 pp. 298–300; Takao Hayashi, ''Indian Mathematics'', pp. 118–30 in ''Companion History of the History and Philosophy of the Mathematical Sciences'', ed.

In the 14th century, [[Madhava of Sangamagrama]], the founder of the so-called [[Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics|Kerala School of Mathematics]], found the [[Leibniz formula for pi|Madhava–Leibniz series]], and, using 21 terms, computed the value of π as 3.14159265359. Madhava also found [[Gregory's series|the Madhava-Gregory series]] to determine the arctangent, the Madhava-Newton power series to determine sine and cosine and [[Taylor series|the Taylor approximation]] for sine and cosine functions.&lt;ref&gt;Plofker 2009 pp. 217–53&lt;/ref&gt; In the 16th century, [[Jyesthadeva]] consolidated many of the Kerala School's developments and theorems in the ''Yukti-bhāṣā''.&lt;ref&gt;P.P. Divakaran, ''The first textbook of calculus: Yukti-bhāṣā'', ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'' 35, 2007, pp. 417–33.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Kerala School did not formulate a systematic theory of [[derivative|differentiation]] and [[integral|integration]], nor is there any direct evidence of their results being transmitted outside Kerala.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Pingree | first = David | author-link = David Pingree | title = Hellenophilia versus the History of Science | journal = Isis | volume = 83 | issue = 4 | page = 562 |date=December 1992  | jstor = 234257 | doi = 10.1086/356288 | quote = One example I can give you relates to the Indian Mādhava's demonstration, in about 1400 A.D., of the infinite power series of trigonometrical functions using geometrical and algebraic arguments.

This claim and Mādhava's achievements were ignored by Western historians, presumably at first because they could not admit that an Indian discovered the calculus, but later because no one read anymore the ''Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society'', in which Whish's article was published. The matter resurfaced in the 1950s, and now we have the Sanskrit texts properly edited, and we understand the clever way that Mādhava derived the series ''without'' the calculus; but many historians still find it impossible to conceive of the problem and its solution in terms of anything other than the calculus and proclaim that the calculus is what Mādhava found. In this case the elegance and brilliance of Mādhava's mathematics are being distorted as they are buried under the current mathematical solution to a problem to which he discovered an alternate and powerful solution.| bibcode = 1992Isis...83..554P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Bressoud | first = David | author-link = David Bressoud | title = Was Calculus Invented in India? | journal = College Mathematics Journal | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–13 | year = 2002 | month = | doi=10.2307/1558972| jstor = 1558972 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Plofker | first = Kim | author-link = Kim Plofker | title = The 'Error' in the Indian "Taylor Series Approximation" to the Sine | journal = Historia Mathematica | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | page = 293 |date=November 2001 | doi = 10.1006/hmat.2001.2331 | quote =It is not unusual to encounter in discussions of Indian mathematics such assertions as that 'the concept of differentiation was understood [in India] from the time of Manjula (... in the 10th century)' [Joseph 1991, 300], or that 'we may consider Madhava to have been the founder of mathematical analysis' (Joseph 1991, 293), or that Bhaskara II may claim to be 'the precursor of Newton and Leibniz in the discovery of the principle of the differential calculus' (Bag 1979, 294)....

[[File:Image-Al-Kitāb al-muḫtaṣar fī ḥisāb al-ğabr wa-l-muqābala.jpg|thumb|Page from ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing]]'' by [[Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]] (c.&amp;nbsp;AD 820)]]
The [[Caliphate|Islamic Empire]] established across [[Persia]], the [[Middle East]], [[Central Asia]], [[North Africa]], [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], and in parts of [[History of India|India]] in the 8th century made significant contributions towards mathematics. Although most Islamic texts on mathematics were written in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], most of them were not written by [[Arab]]s, since much like the status of Greek in the Hellenistic world, Arabic was used as the written language of non-Arab scholars throughout the Islamic world at the time. [[Persian people|Persians]] contributed to the world of Mathematics alongside Arabs.

In the 9th century, the [[Persian people|Persian]] mathematician [[Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]] wrote several important books on the Hindu–Arabic numerals and on methods for solving equations. His book ''On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals'', written about 825, along with the work of [[Al-Kindi]], were instrumental in spreading [[Indian mathematics]] and [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system|Indian numerals]] to the West. The word ''[[algorithm]]'' is derived from the Latinization of his name, Algoritmi, and the word ''[[algebra]]'' from the title of one of his works, ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing|Al-Kitāb al-mukhtaṣar fī hīsāb al-ğabr wa’l-muqābala]]'' (''The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing''). He gave an exhaustive explanation for the algebraic solution of quadratic equations with positive roots,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Arabic Hegemony" p. 230}} "The six cases of equations given above exhaust all possibilities for linear and quadratic equations having positive root. So systematic and exhaustive was al-Khwārizmī's exposition that his readers must have had little difficulty in mastering the solutions."&lt;/ref&gt; and he was the first to teach algebra in an [[Elementary algebra|elementary form]] and for its own sake.&lt;ref&gt;Gandz and Saloman (1936), ''The sources of Khwarizmi's algebra'', Osiris i, pp. 263–77: "In a sense, Khwarizmi is more entitled to be called "the father of algebra" than Diophantus because Khwarizmi is the first to teach algebra in an elementary form and for its own sake, Diophantus is primarily concerned with the theory of numbers".&lt;/ref&gt; He also discussed the fundamental method of "[[Reduction (mathematics)|reduction]]" and "balancing", referring to the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation, that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation. This is the operation which al-Khwārizmī originally described as ''al-jabr''.&lt;ref name=Boyer-229&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Arabic Hegemony" p. 229}} "It is not certain just what the terms ''al-jabr'' and ''muqabalah'' mean, but the usual interpretation is similar to that implied in the translation above. The word ''al-jabr'' presumably meant something like "restoration" or "completion" and seems to refer to the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation; the word ''muqabalah'' is said to refer to "reduction" or "balancing" – that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation."&lt;/ref&gt; His algebra was also no longer concerned "with a series of problems to be resolved, but an [[Expository writing|exposition]] which starts with primitive terms in which the combinations must give all possible prototypes for equations, which henceforward explicitly constitute the true object of study." He also studied an equation for its own sake and "in a generic manner, insofar as it does not simply emerge in the course of solving a problem, but is specifically called on to define an infinite class of problems."&lt;ref name=Rashed-Armstrong&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Rashed | first1=R. | last2=Armstrong | first2=Angela | year=1994 | title=The Development of Arabic Mathematics | publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | isbn=978-0792325659 | oclc=29181926 | pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Egypt, [[Abu Kamil]] extended algebra to the set of [[irrational numbers]], accepting square roots and fourth roots as solutions and coefficients to quadratic equations. He also developed techniques used to solve three non-linear simultaneous equations with three unknown variables. One unique feature of his works was trying to find all the possible solutions to some of his problems, including one where he found 2676 solutions.&lt;ref name="HSTM"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | publisher = Springer|  pages = 4–5| last = Sesiano| first = Jacques| title = Abū Kāmil | encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia of the history of science, technology, and medicine in non-western cultures| year= 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; His works formed an important foundation for the development of algebra and influenced later mathematicians, such as al-Karaji and Fibonacci.

Further developments in algebra were made by [[Al-Karaji]] in his treatise ''al-Fakhri'', where he extends the methodology to incorporate integer powers and integer roots of unknown quantities. Something close to a [[Mathematical proof|proof]] by [[mathematical induction]] appears in a book written by Al-Karaji around 1000 AD, who used it to prove the [[binomial theorem]], [[Pascal's triangle]], and the sum of [[integral]] [[Cube (algebra)|cubes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Katz|1998|loc=pp. 255–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[historian]] of mathematics, F. Woepcke,&lt;ref&gt;F. Woepcke (1853). ''Extrait du Fakhri, traité d'Algèbre par Abou Bekr Mohammed Ben Alhacan Alkarkhi''. [[Paris]].&lt;/ref&gt; praised Al-Karaji for being "the first who introduced the [[theory]] of [[algebra]]ic [[calculus]]." Also in the 10th century, [[Abul Wafa]] translated the works of [[Diophantus]] into Arabic. [[Ibn al-Haytham]] was the first mathematician to derive the formula for the sum of the fourth powers, using a method that is readily generalizable for determining the general formula for the sum of any integral powers. He performed an integration in order to find the volume of a [[paraboloid]], and was able to generalize his result for the integrals of [[polynomial]]s up to the [[Quartic polynomial|fourth degree]]. He thus came close to finding a general formula for the [[integral]]s of polynomials, but he was not concerned with any polynomials higher than the fourth degree.&lt;ref name=Katz&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Katz | first1 = Victor J. | year = 1995 | title = Ideas of Calculus in Islam and India | url = | journal = Mathematics Magazine | volume = 68 | issue = 3| pages = 163–74 | doi=10.2307/2691411| jstor = 2691411 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 11th century, [[Omar Khayyam]] wrote ''Discussions of the Difficulties in Euclid'', a book about what he perceived as flaws in [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']], especially the [[parallel postulate]]. He was also the first to find the general geometric solution to [[cubic equation]]s. He was also very influential in [[calendar reform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alam|first=S|year=2015|title=Mathematics for All and Forever|url=http://www.iisrr.in/mainsite/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IISRR-IJR-1-Mathematics-for-All-...-Syed-Samsul-Alam.pdf|journal=Indian Institute of Social Reform &amp; Research International Journal of Research|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 13th century, [[Nasir al-Din Tusi]] (Nasireddin) made advances in [[spherical trigonometry]]. He also wrote influential work on [[Euclid]]'s [[parallel postulate]]. In the 15th century, [[Ghiyath al-Kashi]] computed the value of [[π]] to the 16th decimal place. Kashi also had an algorithm for calculating ''n''th roots, which was a special case of the methods given many centuries later by [[Paolo Ruffini|Ruffini]] and [[William George Horner|Horner]].

Other achievements of Muslim mathematicians during this period include the addition of the [[decimal point]] notation to the [[Arabic numerals]], the discovery of all the modern [[trigonometric function]]s besides the sine, [[al-Kindi]]'s introduction of [[cryptanalysis]] and [[frequency analysis]], the development of [[analytic geometry]] by [[Ibn al-Haytham]], the beginning of [[algebraic geometry]] by [[Omar Khayyam]] and the development of an [[Mathematical notation|algebraic notation]] by [[Abū al-Hasan ibn Alī al-Qalasādī|al-Qalasādī]].&lt;ref name=Qalasadi&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Al-Qalasadi|title= Abu'l Hasan ibn Ali al Qalasadi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Safavid Empire]] from the 15th century, the development of Islamic mathematics became stagnant.

== Maya ==
[[File:Maya Hieroglyphs Fig 40.jpg|thumb|The [[Maya numerals]] for numbers 1 through 19, written in the [[Maya script]]]]
In the [[Pre-Columbian Americas]], the [[Maya civilization]] that flourished in [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]] during the 1st millennium AD developed a unique tradition of mathematics that, due to its geographic isolation, was entirely independent of existing European, Egyptian, and Asian mathematics.&lt;ref name="Goodman 2016 p121"&gt;{{Harv|Goodman|2016|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maya numerals]] utilized a [[Radix|base]] of 20, the [[vigesimal]] system, instead of a base of ten that forms the basis of the [[decimal]] system used by most modern cultures.&lt;ref name="Goodman 2016 p121"/&gt; The Mayas used mathematics to create the [[Maya calendar]] as well as to predict astronomical phenomena in their native [[Maya astronomy]].&lt;ref name="Goodman 2016 p121"/&gt; While the concept of [[zero]] had to be inferred in the mathematics of many contemporary cultures, the Mayas developed a standard symbol for it.&lt;ref name="Goodman 2016 p121"/&gt;

{{see also|Latin translations of the 12th century}}

Medieval European interest in mathematics was driven by concerns quite different from those of modern mathematicians. One driving element was the belief that mathematics provided the key to understanding the created order of nature, frequently justified by [[Plato]]'s ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' and the biblical passage (in the ''[[Book of Wisdom]]'') that God had ''ordered all things in measure, and number, and weight''.&lt;ref&gt;''Wisdom'', 11:21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Boethius]] provided a place for mathematics in the curriculum in the 6th century when he coined the term ''[[quadrivium]]'' to describe the study of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music. He wrote ''De institutione arithmetica'', a free translation from the Greek of [[Nicomachus]]'s ''Introduction to Arithmetic''; ''De institutione musica'', also derived from Greek sources; and a series of excerpts from [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''. His works were theoretical, rather than practical, and were the basis of mathematical study until the recovery of Greek and Arabic mathematical works.&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, John (1981) "The ''De Institutione Arithmetica'' and the ''De Institutione Musica''", pp. 135–54 in Margaret Gibson, ed., ''Boethius: His Life, Thought, and Influence,'' (Oxford: Basil Blackwell).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Folkerts, Menso, ''"Boethius" Geometrie II'', (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 12th century, European scholars traveled to Spain and Sicily [[Latin translations of the 12th century|seeking scientific Arabic texts]], including [[al-Khwārizmī]]'s ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing]]'', translated into Latin by [[Robert of Chester]], and the complete text of [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']], translated in various versions by [[Adelard of Bath]], [[Herman of Carinthia]], and [[Gerard of Cremona]].&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Thérèse d'Alverny, "Translations and Translators", pp. 421–62 in Robert L. Benson and Giles Constable, ''Renaissance and Renewal in the Twelfth Century'', (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guy Beaujouan, "The Transformation of the Quadrivium", pp. 463–87 in Robert L. Benson and Giles Constable, ''Renaissance and Renewal in the Twelfth Century'', (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;  These and other new sources sparked a renewal of mathematics.

Leonardo of Pisa, now known as [[Fibonacci]], serendipitously learned about the [[Hindu–Arabic numerals]] on a trip to what is now [[Béjaïa]], [[Algeria]] with his merchant father.  (Europe was still using [[Roman numerals]].)  There, he observed a system of [[arithmetic]] (specifically [[algorism]]) which due to the [[positional notation]] of Hindu–Arabic numerals was much more efficient and greatly facilitated commerce.  Leonardo wrote ''[[Liber Abaci]]'' in 1202 (updated in 1254) introducing the technique to Europe and beginning a long period of popularizing it.  The book also brought to Europe what is now known as the [[Fibonacci sequence]] (known to Indian mathematicians for hundreds of years before that) which was used as an unremarkable example within the text.

The 14th century saw the development of new mathematical concepts to investigate a wide range of problems.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Edward and John E. Murdoch (1987), eds., ''Mathematics and Its Applications to Science and Natural Philosophy in the Middle Ages,'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) {{ISBN|052132260X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One important contribution was development of mathematics of local motion.

[[Thomas Bradwardine]] proposed that speed (V) increases in arithmetic proportion as the ratio of force (F) to resistance (R) increases in geometric proportion. Bradwardine expressed this by a series of specific examples, but although the logarithm had not yet been conceived, we can express his conclusion anachronistically by writing:
V = log (F/R).&lt;ref&gt;Clagett, Marshall (1961) ''The Science of Mechanics in the Middle Ages,'' (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press), pp. 421–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Bradwardine's analysis is an example of transferring a mathematical technique used by [[al-Kindi]] and [[Arnald of Villanova]] to quantify the nature of compound medicines to a different physical problem.&lt;ref&gt;Murdoch, John E. (1969) "''Mathesis in Philosophiam Scholasticam Introducta:'' The Rise and Development of the Application of Mathematics in Fourteenth Century Philosophy and Theology", in ''Arts libéraux et philosophie au Moyen Âge'' (Montréal: Institut d'Études Médiévales), at pp. 224–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oresme.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nicole Oresme]] (1323–1382), shown in this contemporary [[illuminated manuscript]] with an [[armillary sphere]] in the foreground, was the first to offer a mathematical proof for the [[divergent series|divergence]] of the [[harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Math Book: From Pythagoras to the 57th Dimension, 250 Milestones in the History of Mathematics|first=Clifford A.|last=Pickover|authorlink=Clifford A.

His results were lost for several centuries, and the result was proved again by Italian mathematician [[Pietro Mengoli]] in 1647 and by Swiss mathematician [[Johann Bernoulli]] in 1687.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
One of the 14th-century [[Oxford Calculators]], [[William Heytesbury]], lacking [[differential calculus]] and the concept of [[Limit of a function|limits]], proposed to measure instantaneous speed "by the path that '''would''' be described by [a body] '''if'''... it were moved uniformly at the same degree of speed with which it is moved in that given instant".&lt;ref&gt;Clagett, Marshall (1961) ''The Science of Mechanics in the Middle Ages,'' (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press), pp. 210, 214–15, 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heytesbury and others mathematically determined the distance covered by a body undergoing uniformly accelerated motion (today solved by [[Integral|integration]]), stating that "a moving body uniformly acquiring or losing that increment [of speed] will traverse in some given time a [distance] completely equal to that which it would traverse if it were moving continuously through the same time with the mean degree [of speed]".&lt;ref&gt;Clagett, Marshall (1961) ''The Science of Mechanics in the Middle Ages,'' (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press), p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicole Oresme]] at the [[University of Paris]] and the Italian [[Giovanni di Casali]] independently provided graphical demonstrations of this relationship, asserting that the area under the line depicting the constant acceleration, represented the total distance traveled.&lt;ref&gt;Clagett, Marshall (1961) ''The Science of Mechanics in the Middle Ages,'' (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press), pp. 332–45, 382–91.&lt;/ref&gt; In a later mathematical commentary on Euclid's ''Elements'', Oresme made a more detailed general analysis in which he demonstrated that a body will acquire in each successive increment of time an increment of any quality that increases as the odd numbers. Since Euclid had demonstrated the sum of the odd numbers are the square numbers, the total quality acquired by the body increases as the square of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Oresme, "Questions on the ''Geometry'' of Euclid" Q. 14, pp. 560–65, in Marshall Clagett, ed., ''Nicole Oresme and the Medieval Geometry of Qualities and Motions,'' (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1968).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Renaissance ==
{{further|Mathematics and art}}
During the [[Renaissance]], the development of mathematics and of [[accounting]] were intertwined.&lt;ref&gt;Heeffer, Albrecht: ''On the curious historical coincidence of algebra and double-entry bookkeeping'', Foundations of the Formal Sciences, [[Ghent University]], November 2009, p. 7 [http://logica.ugent.be/albrecht/thesis/FOTFS2008-Heeffer.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no direct relationship between algebra and accounting, the teaching of the subjects and the books published often intended for the children of merchants who were sent to reckoning schools (in [[Flanders]] and [[Germany]]) or [[abacus school]]s (known as ''abbaco'' in Italy), where they learned the skills useful for trade and commerce. There is probably no need for algebra in performing [[bookkeeping]] operations, but for complex bartering operations or the calculation of [[compound interest]], a basic knowledge of arithmetic was mandatory and knowledge of algebra was very useful.

[[Piero della Francesca]] (c. 1415–1492) wrote books on [[solid geometry]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]], including ''[[De Prospectiva Pingendi]] (On Perspective for Painting)'', ''Trattato d’Abaco (Abacus Treatise)'', and ''De corporibus regularibus (Regular Solids)''.&lt;ref&gt;della Francesca, Piero.

Mancini, Rome, (1916).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pacioli.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Portrait of Luca Pacioli]]'', a painting traditionally attributed to [[Jacopo de' Barbari]], 1495, ([[Museo di Capodimonte]]).]]
[[Luca Pacioli]]'s ''[[Summa de arithmetica|Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalità]]'' (Italian: "Review of [[Arithmetic]], [[Geometry]], [[Ratio]] and [[Proportionality (mathematics)|Proportion]]") was first printed and published in [[Venice]] in 1494. It included a 27-page [[treatise]] on [[bookkeeping]], ''"Particularis de Computis et Scripturis"'' (Italian: "Details of Calculation and Recording"). It was written primarily for, and sold mainly to, merchants who used the book as a reference text, as a source of pleasure from the [[mathematical puzzles]] it contained, and to aid the education of their sons.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Sangster, Greg Stoner &amp; Patricia McCarthy: [http://eprints.mdx.ac.uk/3201/1/final_final_proof_Market_paper_050308.pdf "The market for Luca Pacioli’s Summa Arithmetica"] (Accounting, Business &amp; Financial History Conference, Cardiff, September 2007) pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Summa Arithmetica'', Pacioli introduced symbols for [[plus and minus]] for the first time in a printed book, symbols that became standard notation in Italian Renaissance mathematics. ''Summa Arithmetica'' was also the first known book printed in Italy to contain [[algebra]]. Pacioli obtained many of his ideas from Piero Della Francesca whom he plagiarized.

In Italy, during the first half of the 16th century, [[Scipione del Ferro]] and [[Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia]] discovered solutions for [[cubic equation]]s. [[Gerolamo Cardano]] published them in his 1545 book ''[[Ars Magna (Gerolamo Cardano)|Ars Magna]]'', together with a solution for the [[quartic equation]]s, discovered by his student [[Lodovico Ferrari]]. In 1572 [[Rafael Bombelli]] published his ''L'Algebra'' in which he showed how to deal with the [[imaginary number|imaginary quantities]] that could appear in Cardano's formula for solving cubic equations.

[[Simon Stevin]]'s book ''De Thiende'' ('the art of tenths'), first published in Dutch in 1585, contained the first systematic treatment of [[decimal notation]], which influenced all later work on the [[real number system]].

Driven by the demands of navigation and the growing need for accurate maps of large areas, [[trigonometry]] grew to be a major branch of mathematics. [[Bartholomaeus Pitiscus]] was the first to use the word, publishing his ''Trigonometria'' in 1595. Regiomontanus's table of sines and cosines was published in 1533.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Grattan-Guinness | first = Ivor | year = 1997 | title = The Rainbow of Mathematics: A History of the Mathematical Sciences | publisher = W.W.

During the Renaissance the desire of artists to represent the natural world realistically, together with the rediscovered philosophy of the Greeks, led artists to study mathematics. They were also the engineers and architects of that time, and so had need of mathematics in any case. The art of painting in perspective, and the developments in geometry that involved, were studied intensely.&lt;ref name="Kline"&gt;

==Mathematics during the Scientific Revolution==
===17th century===
[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernhard Christoph Francke.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]].]]
The 17th century saw an unprecedented increase of mathematical and scientific ideas across Europe. [[Galileo]] observed the moons of Jupiter in orbit about that planet, using a telescope based on a toy imported from Holland. [[Tycho Brahe]] had gathered an enormous quantity of mathematical data describing the positions of the planets in the sky. By his position as Brahe's assistant, [[Johannes Kepler]] was first exposed to and seriously interacted with the topic of planetary motion. Kepler's calculations were made simpler by the contemporaneous invention of [[logarithm]]s by [[John Napier]] and [[Jost Bürgi]]. Kepler succeeded in formulating mathematical laws of planetary motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[analytic geometry]] developed by [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) allowed those orbits to be plotted on a graph, in [[Cartesian coordinates]].

Building on earlier work by many predecessors, [[Isaac Newton]] discovered the laws of physics explaining [[Kepler's Laws]], and brought together the concepts now known as [[calculus]]. Independently, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], who is arguably one of the most important mathematicians of the 17th century, developed calculus and much of the calculus notation still in use today. Science and mathematics had become an international endeavor, which would soon spread over the entire world.&lt;ref&gt;Eves, Howard, An Introduction to the History of Mathematics, Saunders, 1990, {{ISBN|0030295580}}, p. 379, "...the concepts of calculus...(are) so far reaching and have exercised such an impact on the modern world that it is perhaps correct to say that without some knowledge of them a person today can scarcely claim to be well educated."&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the application of mathematics to the studies of the heavens, [[applied mathematics]] began to expand into new areas, with the correspondence of [[Pierre de Fermat]] and [[Blaise Pascal]]. Pascal and Fermat set the groundwork for the investigations of [[probability theory]] and the corresponding rules of [[combinatorics]] in their discussions over a game of [[gambling]]. Pascal, with his [[Pascal's Wager|wager]], attempted to use the newly developing probability theory to argue for a life devoted to religion, on the grounds that even if the probability of success was small, the rewards were infinite. In some sense, this foreshadowed the development of [[utility theory]] in the 18th–19th century.

=== 18th century ===
[[File:Leonhard Euler.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Leonhard Euler]] by [[Emanuel Handmann]].]]

The most influential mathematician of the 18th century was arguably [[Leonhard Euler]]. His contributions range from founding the study of [[graph theory]] with the [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg]] problem to standardizing many modern mathematical terms and notations. For example, he named the square root of minus 1 with the symbol [[Imaginary unit|&lt;span style="font-family:times new Roman;"&gt;''i''&lt;/span&gt;]], and he popularized the use of the Greek letter &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; to stand for the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. He made numerous contributions to the study of topology, graph theory, calculus, combinatorics, and complex analysis, as evidenced by the multitude of theorems and notations named for him.

Other important European mathematicians of the 18th century included [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], who did pioneering work in number theory, algebra, differential calculus, and the calculus of variations, and [[Laplace]] who, in the age of [[Napoleon]], did important work on the foundations of [[celestial mechanics]] and on [[statistics]].

[[Image:Carl Friedrich Gauss.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]].]]
Throughout the 19th century mathematics became increasingly abstract. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (1777–1855) epitomizes this trend. He did revolutionary work on [[function (mathematics)|functions]] of [[complex variable]]s, in [[geometry]], and on the convergence of [[series (mathematics)|series]], leaving aside his many contributions to science. He also gave the first satisfactory proofs of the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] and of the [[quadratic reciprocity law]].

[[Image:noneuclid.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Behavior of lines with a common perpendicular in each of the three types of geometry]]
This century saw the development of the two forms of [[non-Euclidean geometry]], where the [[parallel postulate]] of [[Euclidean geometry]] no longer holds.
The Russian mathematician [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky]] and his rival, the Hungarian mathematician [[János Bolyai]], independently defined and studied [[hyperbolic geometry]], where uniqueness of parallels no longer holds. In this geometry the sum of angles in a triangle add up to less than 180°. [[Elliptic geometry]] was developed later in the 19th century by the German mathematician [[Bernhard Riemann]]; here no parallel can be found and the angles in a triangle add up to more than 180°. Riemann also developed [[Riemannian geometry]], which unifies and vastly generalizes the three types of geometry, and he defined the concept of a [[manifold]], which generalizes the ideas of [[curve]]s and [[Surface (topology)|surfaces]].

The 19th century saw the beginning of a great deal of [[abstract algebra]]. [[Hermann Grassmann]] in Germany gave a first version of [[vector space]]s, [[William Rowan Hamilton]] in Ireland developed [[noncommutative algebra]]. The British mathematician [[George Boole]] devised an algebra that soon evolved into what is now called [[Boolean algebra]], in which the only numbers were 0 and 1. Boolean algebra is the starting point of [[mathematical logic]] and has important applications in [[computer science]].

[[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]], [[Bernhard Riemann]], and [[Karl Weierstrass]] reformulated the calculus in a more rigorous fashion.

Also, for the first time, the limits of mathematics were explored. [[Niels Henrik Abel]], a Norwegian, and [[Évariste Galois]], a Frenchman, proved that there is no general algebraic method for solving polynomial equations of degree greater than four ([[Abel–Ruffini theorem]]). Other 19th-century mathematicians utilized this in their proofs that straightedge and compass alone are not sufficient to [[trisect an arbitrary angle]], to construct the side of a cube twice the volume of a given cube, nor to construct a square equal in area to a given circle. Mathematicians had vainly attempted to solve all of these problems since the time of the ancient Greeks. On the other hand, the limitation of three [[dimension]]s in geometry was surpassed in the 19th century through considerations of [[parameter space]] and [[hypercomplex number]]s.

Abel and Galois's investigations into the solutions of various polynomial equations laid the groundwork for further developments of [[group theory]], and the associated fields of [[abstract algebra]]. In the 20th century physicists and other scientists have seen group theory as the ideal way to study [[symmetry]].

In the later 19th century, [[Georg Cantor]] established the first foundations of [[set theory]], which enabled the rigorous treatment of the notion of infinity and has become the common language of nearly all mathematics. Cantor's set theory, and the rise of [[mathematical logic]] in the hands of [[Peano]], [[L.E.J. Brouwer]], [[David Hilbert]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and [[A.N. Whitehead]], initiated a long running debate on the [[foundations of mathematics]].

The 19th century saw the founding of a number of national mathematical societies: the [[London Mathematical Society]] in 1865, the [[Société Mathématique de France]] in 1872, the [[Circolo Matematico di Palermo]] in 1884, the [[Edinburgh Mathematical Society]] in 1883, and the [[American Mathematical Society]] in 1888. The first international, special-interest society, the [[Quaternion Society]], was formed in 1899, in the context of a [[hyperbolic quaternion#Historical review|vector controversy]].

In 1897, Hensel introduced [[p-adic number]]s.

=== 20th century === &lt;!-- Hibert's problems, foundational crisis, Bourbaki --&gt;
The 20th century saw mathematics become a major profession. Every year, thousands of new Ph.D.s in mathematics were awarded, and jobs were available in both teaching and industry. An effort to catalogue the areas and applications of mathematics was undertaken in [[Klein's encyclopedia]].

In a 1900 speech to the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]], [[David Hilbert]] set out a list of [[Hilbert's problems|23 unsolved problems in mathematics]]. These problems, spanning many areas of mathematics, formed a central focus for much of 20th-century mathematics. Today, 10 have been solved, 7 are partially solved, and 2 are still open. The remaining 4 are too loosely formulated to be stated as solved or not.

[[Image:Four Colour Map Example.svg|thumb|left|upright|A map illustrating the [[Four Color Theorem]]]]
Notable historical conjectures were finally proven. In 1976, [[Wolfgang Haken]] and [[Kenneth Appel]] proved the [[four color theorem]], controversial at the time for the use of a computer to do so. [[Andrew Wiles]], building on the work of others, proved [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] in 1995. [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] and [[Kurt Gödel]] proved that the [[continuum hypothesis]] is [[logical independence|independent]] of (could neither be proved nor disproved from) the [[ZFC|standard axioms of set theory]]. In 1998 [[Thomas Callister Hales]] proved the [[Kepler conjecture]].

Mathematical collaborations of unprecedented size and scope took place. An example is the [[classification of finite simple groups]] (also called the "enormous theorem"), whose proof between 1955 and 1983 required 500-odd journal articles by about 100 authors, and filling tens of thousands of pages. A group of French mathematicians, including [[Jean Dieudonné]] and [[André Weil]], publishing under the [[pseudonym]] "[[Nicolas Bourbaki]]", attempted to exposit all of known mathematics as a coherent rigorous whole. The resulting several dozen volumes has had a controversial influence on mathematical education.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Mashaal, 2006. ''Bourbaki: A Secret Society of Mathematicians''. [[American Mathematical Society]]. {{ISBN|0821839675|978-0821839676}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Relativistic precession.svg|thumb|Newtonian (red) vs. Einsteinian orbit (blue) of a lone planet orbiting a star, with [[General relativity#Orbital effects and the relativity of direction|relativistic precession of apsides]]]]
[[Differential geometry]] came into its own when [[Einstein]] used it in [[general relativity]]. Entirely new areas of mathematics such as [[mathematical logic]], [[topology]], and [[John von Neumann]]'s [[game theory]] changed the kinds of questions that could be answered by mathematical methods. All kinds of [[Mathematical structure|structures]] were abstracted using axioms and given names like [[metric space]]s, [[topological space]]s etc. As mathematicians do, the concept of an abstract structure was itself abstracted and led to [[category theory]]. [[Grothendieck]] and [[Jean-Pierre Serre|Serre]] recast [[algebraic geometry]] using [[Sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf theory]]. Large advances were made in the qualitative study of [[dynamical systems theory|dynamical systems]] that [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] had begun in the 1890s.
[[Measure theory]] was developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Applications of measures include the [[Lebesgue integral]], [[Kolmogorov]]'s axiomatisation of [[probability theory]], and [[ergodic theory]]. [[Knot theory]] greatly expanded. [[Quantum mechanics]] led to the development of [[functional analysis]]. Other new areas include [[Laurent Schwartz]]'s [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution theory]], [[Fixed-point theorem|fixed point theory]], [[singularity theory]] and [[René Thom]]'s [[catastrophe theory]], [[model theory]], and [[Benoit Mandelbrot|Mandelbrot]]'s [[fractals]]. [[Lie theory]] with its [[Lie group]]s and [[Lie algebra]]s became one of the major areas of study.

[[Non-standard analysis]], introduced by [[Abraham Robinson]], rehabilitated the [[infinitesimal]] approach to calculus, which had fallen into disrepute in favour of the theory of [[Limit of a function|limits]], by extending the field of real numbers to the [[Hyperreal number]]s which include infinitesimal and infinite quantities. An even larger number system, the [[surreal number]]s were discovered by [[John Horton Conway]] in connection with [[combinatorial game]]s.

The development and continual improvement of [[computer]]s, at first mechanical analog machines and then digital electronic machines, allowed [[industry]] to deal with larger and larger amounts of data to facilitate mass production and distribution and communication, and new areas of mathematics were developed to deal with this: [[Alan Turing]]'s [[computability theory]]; [[Computational complexity theory|complexity theory]]; [[Derrick Henry Lehmer]]'s use of [[ENIAC]] to further number theory and the [[Lucas-Lehmer test]]; [[Rózsa Péter]]'s [[recursive function theory]]; [[Claude Shannon]]'s [[information theory]]; [[signal processing]]; [[data analysis]]; [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]] and other areas of [[operations research]]. In the preceding centuries much mathematical focus was on [[calculus]] and continuous functions, but the rise of computing and communication networks led to an increasing importance of [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] concepts and the expansion of [[combinatorics]] including [[graph theory]]. The speed and data processing abilities of computers also enabled the handling of mathematical problems that were too time-consuming to deal with by pencil and paper calculations, leading to areas such as [[numerical analysis]] and [[symbolic computation]]. Some of the most important methods and [[algorithm]]s of the 20th century are: the [[simplex algorithm]], the [[Fast Fourier Transform]], [[error-correcting code]]s, the [[Kalman filter]] from [[control theory]] and the [[RSA algorithm]] of [[public-key cryptography]].

At the same time, deep insights were made about the limitations to mathematics. In 1929 and 1930, it was proved the truth or falsity of all statements formulated about the [[natural number]]s plus one of addition and multiplication, was [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]], i.e. could be determined by some algorithm. In 1931, [[Kurt Gödel]] found that this was not the case for the natural numbers plus both addition and multiplication; this system, known as [[Peano arithmetic]], was in fact [[incompleteness theorem|incompletable]]. (Peano arithmetic is adequate for a good deal of [[number theory]], including the notion of [[prime number]].) A consequence of Gödel's two [[incompleteness theorem]]s is that in any mathematical system that includes Peano arithmetic (including all of [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[geometry]]), truth necessarily outruns proof, i.e. there are true statements that [[Incompleteness theorem|cannot be proved]] within the system. Hence mathematics cannot be reduced to mathematical logic, and [[David Hilbert]]'s dream of making all of mathematics complete and consistent needed to be reformulated.

[[Image:GammaAbsSmallPlot.png|thumb|right|The [[absolute value]] of the Gamma function on the complex plane.]]
One of the more colorful figures in 20th-century mathematics was [[Srinivasa Aiyangar Ramanujan]] (1887–1920), an Indian [[autodidact]] who conjectured or proved over 3000 theorems, including properties of [[highly composite number]]s, the [[partition function (number theory)|partition function]] and its [[asymptotics]], and [[Ramanujan theta function|mock theta functions]]. He also made major investigations in the areas of [[gamma function]]s, [[modular form]]s, [[divergent series]], [[General hypergeometric function|hypergeometric series]] and [[prime number]] theory.

[[Paul Erdős]] published more papers than any other mathematician in history, working with hundreds of collaborators. Mathematicians have a game equivalent to the [[Kevin Bacon Game]], which leads to the [[Erdős number]] of a mathematician. This describes the "collaborative distance" between a person and Paul Erdős, as measured by joint authorship of mathematical papers.

[[Emmy Noether]] has been described by many as the most important woman in the history of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|authorlink=Pavel Alexandrov|last=Alexandrov|first=Pavel S.|chapter=In Memory of Emmy Noether | title = Emmy Noether: A Tribute to Her Life and Work|editor1-first =James W | editor1-last = Brewer | editor2-first = Martha K | editor2-last = Smith | place = New York | publisher= Marcel Dekker | year= 1981 | isbn = 978-0824715502 |pages= 99–111}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She studied the theories of [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]], and [[algebra over a field|algebras]].

As in most areas of study, the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization: by the end of the century there were hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] was dozens of pages long.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classifications2000.pdf Mathematics Subject Classification 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; More and more [[mathematical journal]]s were published and, by the end of the century, the development of the [[World Wide Web]] led to online publishing.

=== 21st century ===
{{See also|List of unsolved problems in mathematics#Problems solved since 1995}}
In 2000, the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] announced the seven [[Millennium Prize Problems]], and in 2003 the [[Poincaré conjecture]] was solved by [[Grigori Perelman]] (who declined to accept an award, as he was critical of the mathematics establishment).

Most mathematical journals now have online versions as well as print versions, and many online-only journals are launched. There is an increasing drive towards [[Open access (publishing)|open access publishing]], first popularized by the [[arXiv]].

In [[mathematics]] and [[computer programming]], '''index notation''' is used to specify the elements of an array of numbers. The formalism of how indices are used varies according to the subject.  In particular, there are different methods for referring to the elements of a list, a vector, or a matrix, depending on whether one is writing a formal mathematical paper for publication, or when one is writing a [[computer program]].

==Index notation in mathematics==

{{Main|Ricci calculus|tensor}}

It is frequently helpful in mathematics to refer to the elements of an array using subscripts. The subscripts can be [[integer]]s or [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]]. The array takes the form of [[tensors]] in general, since these can be treated as multi-dimensional arrays. Special (and more familiar) cases are [[vector (geometry)|vectors]] (1d arrays) and [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] (2d arrays).

The following is only an introduction to the concept: index notation is used in more detail in mathematics (particularly in the representation and manipulation of [[tensor#Operations|tensor operations]]). See the main article for further details.

===One-dimensional arrays (vectors)===

{{main|Vector (mathematics and physics)}}

A vector treated as an array of numbers by writing as a [[row vector]] or [[column vector]] (whichever is used depends on convenience or context):

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix}
    a_1 \\
    a_2 \\
    \vdots \\
    a_n  
  \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix}
    a_1 &amp; a_2 &amp; \cdots &amp; a_n \\ 
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Index notation allows indication of the elements of the array by simply writing ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', where the index ''i'' is known to run from 1 to ''n''.&lt;ref&gt;An introduction to Tensor Analysis: For Engineers and Applied Scientists, J.R. Tyldesley, Longman, 1975, {{ISBN|0-582-44355-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, given the vector:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix}
  10 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 &amp; 6 &amp; 3 &amp; 5 \\ 
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

then some entries are

:&lt;math&gt;a_1 = 10,\, a_2 = 8,\, \cdots,\, a_6 = 5 &lt;/math&gt;.

The notation can be applied to [[vectors in mathematics and physics]]. The following [[vector equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{c}&lt;/math&gt;

can also be written in terms of the elements of the vector (aka components), that is

:&lt;math&gt; a_i + b_i = c_i &lt;/math&gt;

where the indices take a given range of values. This expression represents a set of equations, one for each index. If the vectors each have ''n'' elements, meaning ''i'' = 1,2...''n'', then the equations are explicitly

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  a_1 + b_1 &amp;= c_1 \\
  a_2 + b_2 &amp;= c_2 \\
            &amp;\ \ \vdots \\
  a_n + b_n &amp;= c_n
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, index notation serves as an efficient shorthand for
#representing the general structure to an equation,
#while applicable to individual components.

===Two-dimensional arrays===
[[File:Matrix.svg|thumb|247px|right|Elements of matrix '''A''' are described with two subscripts or indices.]]
{{main|matrix (mathematics)}}
{{see also|Dyadics}}

More than one index is used to describe arrays of numbers, in two or more dimensions, such as the elements of a matrix, (see also image to right);

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix}
  a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{1n} \\
  a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{2n} \\
  \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
  a_{m1} &amp; a_{m2} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{mn} \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The entry of a matrix '''A''' is written using two indices, say ''i'' and ''j'', with or without commas to separate the indices: ''a&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''a&lt;sub&gt;i,j&lt;/sub&gt;'', where the first subscript is the row number and the second is the column number. [[Multiplication|Juxtaposition]] is also used as notation for multiplication; this may be a source of confusion. For example, if

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix}
  9 &amp; 8 &amp; 6 \\
  1 &amp; 2 &amp; 7 \\
  4 &amp; 9 &amp; 2 \\
  6 &amp; 0 &amp; 5 
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

then some entries are

:&lt;math&gt;a_{11} = 9,\, a_{12} = 8,\, a_{21} = 1,\, \cdots,\, a_{23} = 7,\, \cdots &lt;/math&gt;.

For indices larger than 9, the comma-based notation may be superior (e.g., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3,12&lt;/sub&gt; instead of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;312&lt;/sub&gt;).

[[Matrix equation]]s are written similarly to vector equations, such as

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B} = \mathbf{C} &lt;/math&gt;

in terms of the elements of the matrices (aka components)

:&lt;math&gt; A_{ij} + B_{ij} = C_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;

for all values of ''i'' and ''j''. Again this expression represents a set of equations, one for each index. If the matrices each have ''m'' rows and ''n'' columns, meaning {{nowrap|''i'' {{=}} 1, 2, …, ''m''}} and {{nowrap|''j'' {{=}} 1, 2, …, ''n''}}, then there are ''mn'' equations.

===Multi-dimensional arrays===

{{main|tensors}}
{{see also|classical treatment of tensors}}

The notation allows a clear generalization to multi-dimensional arrays of elements: tensors. For example,

:&lt;math&gt; A_{i_1 i_2 \cdots } + B_{i_1 i_2 \cdots} = C_{i_1 i_2 \cdots} &lt;/math&gt;

representing a set of many equations.

In tensor analysis, superscripts are used instead of subscripts to distinguish covariant from contravariant entities, see [[covariance and contravariance of vectors]] and [[raising and lowering indices]].

==Index notation in computing==
In several programming languages, index notation is a way of addressing elements of an array. This method is used since it is closest to how it is implemented in [[assembly language]] whereby the address of the first element is used as a base, and a multiple (the index) of the element size is used to address inside the array.

For example, if an array of integers is stored in a region of the computer's memory starting at the memory cell with address 3000 (the [[base address]]), and each integer occupies four cells (bytes), then the elements of this array are at memory locations 0x3000, 0x3004, 0x3008, …, 0x3000 + 4(''n'' − 1). In general, the address of the ''i''th element of an array with [[base address]] ''b'' and element size ''s'' is {{nowrap|''b'' + ''is''}}.

==C implementation details==
In the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]], we can write the above as {{code|*(base + i)}} (pointer form) or {{code|base[i]}} (array indexing form), which is exactly equivalent because the C standard defines the array indexing form as a transformation to pointer form. Coincidentally, since pointer addition is commutative, this allows for obscure expressions such as {{code|3[base]}} which is equivalent to {{code|base[3]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Programming with C++, J. Hubbard, Schaum’s Outlines, McGraw Hill (USA), 1996, {{ISBN|0-07-114328-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multidimensional arrays===
Things become more interesting when we consider arrays with more than one index, for example, a two-dimensional table. We have three possibilities:
* make the two-dimensional array one-dimensional by computing a single index from the two
* consider a one-dimensional array where each element is another one-dimensional array, i.e. an array of arrays
* use additional storage to hold the array of addresses of each row of the original array, and store the rows of the original array as separate one-dimensional arrays
In C, all three methods can be used. When the first method is used, the programmer decides how the elements of the array are laid out in the computer's memory, and provides the formulas to compute the location of each element. The second method is used when the number of elements in each row is the same and known at the time the program is written. The programmer declares the array to have, say, three columns by writing e.g. {{code|elementtype tablename[][3];}}. One then refers to a particular element of the array by writing {{code|tablename[first index][second index]}}.  The compiler computes the total number of memory cells occupied by each row, uses the first index to find the address of the desired row, and then uses the second index to find the address of the desired element in the row. When the third method is used, the programmer declares the table to be an array of pointers, like in {{code|elementtype *tablename[];}}. When the programmer subsequently specifies a particular element {{code|tablename[first index][second index]}}, the compiler generates instructions to look up the address of the row specified by the first index, and use this address as the base when computing the address of the element specified by the second index.

===Example===
This function multiplies two 3x3 floating point matrices together.
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
 void mult3x3f(float result[][3], const float A[][3], const float B[][3])
 {
   int i, j, k;
   for (i = 0; i &lt; 3; ++i) {
     for (j = 0; j &lt; 3; ++j) {
       result[i][j] = 0;
       for (k = 0; k &lt; 3; ++k)
         result[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
     }
   }
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

==In other languages==
In other programming languages such as Pascal, indices may start at 1, so indexing in a block of memory can be changed to fit a start-at-1 addressing scheme by a simple linear transformation - in this scheme, the memory location of the ''i''th element with [[base address]] ''b'' and element size ''s'' is {{nowrap|''b'' + (''i'' − 1)''s''}}.

'''Large numbers''' are numbers that are significantly larger than those ordinarily used in everyday life, for instance in simple counting or in monetary transactions. The term typically refers to large positive [[integer]]s, or more generally, large positive [[real number]]s, but it may also be used in other contexts.

Very large numbers often occur in fields such as [[mathematics]], [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], [[cryptography]], and [[statistical mechanics]]. Sometimes people refer to numbers as being "astronomically large". However, it is easy to mathematically define numbers that are much larger even than those used in astronomy.

== Using scientific notation to handle large and small numbers ==
{{See also|scientific notation|logarithmic scale|orders of magnitude}}

[[Scientific notation]] was created to handle the wide range of values that occur in scientific study.  1.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, for example, means one [[1000000000 (number)|billion]], a 1 followed by nine zeros: 1 000 000 000, and 1.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; means one billionth, or 0.000 000 001.  Writing 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; instead of nine zeros saves readers the effort and hazard of counting a long series of zeros to see how large the number is.

== Large numbers in the everyday world ==
{{references|date=October 2017}}
Examples of large numbers describing everyday real-world objects are:
* The number of [[bit]]s on a computer [[hard disk]] ({{as of|2010|lc=true}}, typically about 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;, 500–1000&amp;nbsp;[[gigabyte|GB]])&lt;!-- if you think this is wrong, read the numbers again, carefully. These are bits, not bytes. --&gt;
* The estimated number of [[atom]]s in the observable universe (10&lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt;) 
* Earth's mass consist of about (4x10&lt;sup&gt;51&lt;/sup&gt;) [[nucleon]]s 
* The number of [[Cell (biology)|cells]] in the human body (more than 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;)
* The number of [[Neuron|neuronal connections]] in the human brain (estimated at 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;)
* The lower bound on the game-tree complexity of chess, also known as the "[[Shannon number]]" (estimated at around 10&lt;sup&gt;120&lt;/sup&gt;)
* The [[Avogadro constant]], the number of "elementary entities" (usually atoms or molecules) in one [[Mole (unit)|mole]]; the number of atoms in 12&amp;nbsp;grams of [[carbon-12]]; (approximately 6.022 × 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;)

== Astronomically large numbers ==
Other large numbers, as regards length and time, are found in [[astronomy]] and [[cosmology]]. For example, the current [[Big Bang model]] suggests that the universe is 13.8&amp;nbsp;billion years (4.355 × 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; seconds) old, and that the [[observable universe]] is 93&amp;nbsp;billion [[light years]] across (8.8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; metres), and contains about 5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; stars, organized into around 125&amp;nbsp;billion (1.25 × 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;) galaxies, according to  Hubble Space Telescope observations. There are about 10&lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt; atoms in the [[observable universe]], by rough estimation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universetoday.com/36302/atoms-in-the-universe/#gsc.tab=0 Atoms in the Universe]. Universe Today. 30-07-2009. Retrieved 02-03-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Don Page (physicist)|Don Page]], physicist at the University of Alberta, Canada, the longest finite time that has so far been explicitly calculated by any physicist is

::::&lt;math&gt;10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{1.1}}}}} \mbox{ years}&lt;/math&gt;

which corresponds to the scale of an estimated [[Poincaré recurrence theorem|Poincaré recurrence time]] for the quantum state of a hypothetical box containing a black hole with the estimated mass of the entire universe, observable or not, assuming a certain [[inflation (cosmology)|inflationary]] model with an [[inflaton]] whose mass is 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; [[Planck mass]]es.&lt;ref name=page95&gt;Information Loss in Black Holes and/or Conscious Beings?, Don N. Page, ''Heat Kernel Techniques and Quantum Gravity'' (1995), S. A. Fulling (ed), p. 461. Discourses in Mathematics and its Applications, No. 4, Texas A&amp;M University Department of Mathematics. {{arxiv|hep-th/9411193}}. {{isbn|0-9630728-3-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpx.de/fp/Fun/Googolplex/GetAGoogol.html How to Get A Googolplex]&lt;/ref&gt; This time assumes a statistical model subject to Poincaré recurrence. A much simplified way of thinking about this time is in a model where the universe's history [[Loschmidt's paradox|repeats itself]] arbitrarily many times due to [[Ergodic hypothesis|properties of statistical mechanics]]; this is the time scale when it will first be somewhat similar (for a reasonable choice of "similar") to its current state again.

[[Combinatorial]] processes rapidly generate even larger numbers. The [[factorial]] function, which defines the number of [[permutation]]s on a set of fixed objects, grows very rapidly with the number of objects. [[Stirling's formula]] gives a precise asymptotic expression for this rate of growth.

Combinatorial processes generate very large numbers in [[statistical mechanics]]. These numbers are so large that they are typically only referred to using their [[logarithm]]s.

[[Gödel number]]s, and similar numbers used to represent bit-strings in [[algorithmic information theory]], are very large, even for mathematical statements of reasonable length. However, some [[pathological (mathematics)|pathological]] numbers are even larger than the Gödel numbers of typical mathematical propositions.

Logician [[Harvey Friedman]] has done work related to very large numbers, such as with [[Kruskal's tree theorem]] and the [[Robertson–Seymour theorem]].

== Computers and computational complexity ==
{{Original research|section|date=September 2009}}

Between 1980 and 2000, personal computer hard disk sizes increased from about 10 megabytes (10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; bytes) to over 100 gigabytes (10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; bytes).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.numbersleuth.org/trends/the-amazing-history-of-information-storage-how-small-has-become-beautiful/|title = History of Information Storage|date = August 30, 2012|accessdate = October 9, 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 100-gigabyte disk could store the favorite color of all of Earth's seven billion inhabitants without using data compression (storing 14 bytes times 7 billion inhabitants would equal 98 GB used). But what about a dictionary-on-disk storing all possible passwords containing up to 40 characters? Assuming each character equals one byte, there are about 2&lt;sup&gt;320&lt;/sup&gt; such passwords, which is about 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;96&lt;/sup&gt;. In his paper ''Computational capacity of the universe'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lloyd | first = Seth | authorlink = Seth Lloyd | year = 2002 | title = Computational capacity of the universe | journal = Phys. Rev. Lett. | volume = 88 | pages = 237901 | arxiv = quant-ph/0110141 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.88.237901 | pmid = 12059399 | issue = 23 | bibcode=2002PhRvL..88w7901L}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seth Lloyd]] points out that if every particle in the universe could be used as part of a huge computer, it could store only about 10&lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt; bits, less than one millionth of the size such a dictionary would require.  However, storing information on hard disk and computing it are very different functions. On the one hand storage currently has limitations as stated, but computational speed is a different matter. It is quite conceivable {{By whom|date=February 2013}} that the stated limitations regarding storage have no bearing on the limitations of actual computational capacity, {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} especially if the current research into quantum computers results in a "quantum leap" (but see ''[[holographic principle]]'').

Still, computers can easily be programmed to start creating and displaying all possible 40-character passwords one at a time. Such a program could be left to run indefinitely. Assuming a modern PC could output 1&amp;nbsp;billion strings per second, it would take one billionth of 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;96&lt;/sup&gt; seconds, or 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;87&lt;/sup&gt; seconds to complete its task, which is about 6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;79&lt;/sup&gt; years. By contrast, the universe is estimated to be 13.8&amp;nbsp;billion (1.38 × 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;) years old. Computers will presumably continue to get faster, but the same paper mentioned before estimates that the entire universe functioning as a giant computer could have performed no more than 10&lt;sup&gt;120&lt;/sup&gt; operations since the [[Big Bang]]. This is trillions of times more computation than is required for displaying all 40-character passwords, but computing all ''50'' character passwords would outstrip the estimated computational potential of the entire universe.

Problems like this [[exponential growth|grow exponentially]] in the number of computations they require, and they are one reason why exponentially difficult problems are called "intractable" in computer science: for even small numbers like the 40 or 50 characters described earlier, the number of computations required exceeds even theoretical limits {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} on mankind's computing power. The [[P = NP problem|traditional division]] between "easy" and "hard" problems is thus drawn between programs that do and do not require exponentially increasing resources to execute.

Such limits are an advantage in [[cryptography]], since any [[cipher]]-breaking technique that requires more than, say, the 10&lt;sup&gt;120&lt;/sup&gt; operations mentioned before will never be feasible.  Such ciphers must be broken by finding efficient techniques unknown to the cipher's designer. Likewise, much of the research throughout all branches of [[computer science]] focuses on finding efficient solutions to problems that work with far fewer resources than are required by a [[naïve solution]]. For example, one way of finding the [[greatest common divisor]] between two 1000-digit numbers is to compute all their factors by trial division. This will take up to 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;500&lt;/sup&gt; division operations, far too large to contemplate. But the [[Euclidean algorithm]], using a much more efficient technique, takes only a fraction of a second to compute the GCD for even huge numbers such as these.

As a general rule, then, PCs in 2005 can perform 2&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt; calculations in a few minutes. {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} A few thousand PCs working for a few years could solve a problem requiring 2&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt; calculations, but no amount of traditional computing power will solve a problem requiring 2&lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt; operations (which is about what would be required to brute-force the encryption keys in 128-bit [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] commonly used in web browsers, assuming the underlying ciphers remain secure). Limits on computer storage are comparable. {{quantify|date=February 2013}} [[Quantum computing]] might allow certain problems that require an exponential amount of calculations to become feasible. However, it has practical and theoretical challenges that may never be overcome, such as the mass production of [[qubit]]s, the fundamental building block of quantum computing.

*&lt;math&gt;10^{10}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;small&gt;(10,000,000,000)&lt;/small&gt;, called "ten&amp;nbsp;billion" in the [[Long and short scales|short scale]] or "ten&amp;nbsp;milliard" in the long scale.

*[[googol]] = &lt;math&gt;10^{100}.&lt;/math&gt;
*[[centillion]] = &lt;math&gt;10^{303}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;10^{600}&lt;/math&gt;, depending on number naming system
*The largest known [[Smith number]] = (10&lt;sup&gt;1031&lt;/sup&gt;−1) × (10&lt;sup&gt;4594&lt;/sup&gt; + 3{{e|2297}} + 1)&lt;sup&gt;1476&lt;/sup&gt; {{e|3913210}}

*[[googolplex]] = &lt;math&gt;10^{\text{googol}}=10^{10^{100}}&lt;/math&gt;
*[[Skewes' number]]s: the first is approximately &lt;math&gt;10^{10^{10^{34}}}&lt;/math&gt;, the second &lt;math&gt;10^{10^{10^{964}}}&lt;/math&gt;
*[[Graham's number]], larger than what can be represented even using power towers. However, it can be represented using [[Knuth's up-arrow notation]].
The total amount of printed material in the world is roughly 1.6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; bits{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}; therefore the contents can be represented by a number somewhere in the range 0 to roughly &lt;math&gt;2^{1.6 \times 10^{18}}\approx 10^{4.8 \times 10^{17}}&lt;/math&gt;
*[[googolplexian]]=&lt;math&gt;10^{\text{googolplex}}=10^{10^{\text{googol}}}=10^{10^{10^{100}}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Compare:
*&lt;math&gt;1.1^{1.1^{1.1^{1000}}} \approx 10^{10^{1.02\times10^{40}}}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;1000^{1000^{1000}}\approx 10^{10^{3000.48}}&lt;/math&gt;
The first number is much larger than the second, due to the larger height of the power tower, and in spite of the small numbers 1.1. In comparing the magnitude of each successive exponent in the last number with &lt;math&gt;10^{10^{10}}&lt;/math&gt;, we find a difference in the magnitude of effect on the final exponent.

Given a strictly increasing integer sequence/function &lt;math&gt;f_0(n)&lt;/math&gt; (''n''≥1) we can produce a faster-growing sequence &lt;math&gt;f_1(n) = f_0^n(n)&lt;/math&gt; (where the superscript ''n'' denotes the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; [[functional power]]). This can be repeated any number of times by letting &lt;math&gt;f_k(n) = f_{k-1}^n(n)&lt;/math&gt;, each sequence growing much faster than the one before it. Then we could define &lt;math&gt;f_\omega(n) = f_n(n)&lt;/math&gt;, which grows much faster than any &lt;math&gt;f_k&lt;/math&gt; for finite ''k'' (here ω is the first infinite [[ordinal number]], representing the limit of all finite numbers k).  This is the basis for the [[fast-growing hierarchy]] of functions, in which the indexing subscript is extended to ever-larger ordinals.

For example, starting with  ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') = ''n'' + 1:

* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'') = ''n'' + ''n'' = 2''n''
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'') = 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''n'' &gt; (2 ↑) ''n'' for n ≥ 2 (using [[Knuth up-arrow notation]])
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'') &gt; (2 ↑)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ''n'' ≥ 2 ↑&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ''n'' for ''n'' ≥ 2.
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') &gt; 2 ↑&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; ''n'' for ''n'' ≥ 2, ''k'' &lt; ω.
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') &gt; 2 ↑&lt;sup&gt;''n'' – 1&lt;/sup&gt; ''n'' &gt; 2 ↑&lt;sup&gt;''n'' − 2&lt;/sup&gt; (''n'' + 3) − 3 = ''A''(''n'', ''n'') for ''n'' ≥ 2, where ''A'' is the [[Ackermann function]] (of which ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; is a unary version).
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ω+1&lt;/sub&gt;(64) &gt; ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;(6) &gt; [[Graham's number#Definition|Graham's number]] (= ''g''&lt;sub&gt;64&lt;/sub&gt; in the sequence defined by ''g''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 4, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = 3 ↑&lt;sup&gt;''g''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 3).
**This follows by noting ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') &gt; 2 ↑&lt;sup&gt;''n'' – 1&lt;/sup&gt; ''n'' &gt; 3 ↑&lt;sup&gt;''n'' – 2&lt;/sup&gt; 3 + 2, and hence ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;(''g''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; + 2) &gt; ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt; + 2.
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') &gt; 2 ↑&lt;sup&gt;''n'' – 1&lt;/sup&gt; ''n'' =  (2 → ''n'' → ''n''-1)  =  (2 → ''n'' → ''n''-1 → 1) (using [[Conway chained arrow notation]])
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ω+1&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'') &gt; (2 → ''n'' → ''n''-1 → 2) (because if ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') = X → ''n'' → ''k'' then X → ''n'' → ''k''+1 = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(1))
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ω+''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') &gt; (2 → ''n'' → ''n''-1 → ''k''+1) &gt; (''n'' → ''n'' → ''k'')
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ω2&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ω+''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') &gt; (''n'' → ''n'' → ''n'') = (''n'' → ''n'' → ''n''→ 1)
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ω2+''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') &gt; (''n'' → ''n'' → ''n'' → ''k'')
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ω3&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') &gt; (''n'' → ''n'' → ''n'' → ''n'')
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;ω''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') &gt; (''n'' → ''n'' → ... → ''n'' → ''n'') (Chain of ''k''+1 ''n'''s)

== Standardized system of writing very large numbers ==

A standardized way of writing very large numbers allows them to be easily sorted in increasing order, and one can get a good idea of how much larger a number is than another one.

To compare numbers in scientific notation, say 5×10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and 2×10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, compare the exponents first, in this case 5 &gt; 4, so 2×10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; 5×10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. If the exponents are equal, the ''mantissa'' (or coefficient) should be compared, thus 5×10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; 2×10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; because 5 &gt; 2.

[[Tetration]] with base 10 gives the sequence &lt;math&gt;10 \uparrow \uparrow n=10 \to n \to 2=(10\uparrow)^n 1&lt;/math&gt;, the power towers of numbers 10, where &lt;math&gt;(10\uparrow)^n&lt;/math&gt; denotes a [[functional power]] of the function &lt;math&gt;f(n)=10^n&lt;/math&gt; (the function also expressed by the suffix "-plex" as in [[googolplex]], see [[Names of large numbers#The googol family|the Googol family]]).

These are very round numbers, each representing an [[order of magnitude]] in a generalized sense. A crude way of specifying how large a number is, is specifying between which two numbers in this sequence it is.

More accurately, numbers in between can be expressed in the form &lt;math&gt;(10\uparrow)^n a&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., with a power tower of 10s and a number at the top, possibly in scientific notation, e.g. &lt;math&gt;10^{10^{10^{10^{10^{4.829}}}}}&lt;/math&gt;, a number between &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow 5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow 6&lt;/math&gt; (note that &lt;math&gt;10 \uparrow\uparrow n &lt; (10\uparrow)^n a &lt; 10 \uparrow\uparrow (n+1)&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; 1 &lt; a &lt; 10&lt;/math&gt;). (See also [[Tetration#Extension to real heights|extension of tetration to real heights]].)

Thus googolplex is &lt;math&gt;10^{10^{100}} = (10\uparrow)^2 100 = (10\uparrow)^3 2&lt;/math&gt;

Another example:
:&lt;math&gt;2 \uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 4 = 
  \begin{matrix}
   \underbrace{2_{}^{2^{{}^{.\,^{.\,^{.\,^2}}}}}}\\
   \qquad\quad\ \ \ 65,536\mbox{ copies of }2  \end{matrix}
  \approx (10\uparrow)^{65,531}(6.0 \times 10^{19,728}) \approx (10\uparrow)^{65,533} 4.3
&lt;/math&gt; (between &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow 65,533&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow 65,534&lt;/math&gt;)

Thus the "order of magnitude" of a number (on a larger scale than usually meant), can be characterized by the number of times (''n'') one has to take the &lt;math&gt;log_{10}&lt;/math&gt; to get a number between 1 and 10. Thus, the number is between &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow (n+1)&lt;/math&gt;. As explained, a more accurate description of a number also specifies the value of this number between 1 and 10, or the previous number (taking the logarithm one time less) between 10 and 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;, or the next, between 0 and 1.

Note that
:&lt;math&gt;10^{(10\uparrow)^{n}x}=(10\uparrow)^{n}10^x&lt;/math&gt;
I.e., if a number ''x'' is too large for a representation &lt;math&gt;(10\uparrow)^{n}x&lt;/math&gt; we can make the power tower one higher, replacing ''x'' by log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;''x'', or find ''x'' from the lower-tower representation of the log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; of the whole number. If the power tower would contain one or more numbers different from 10, the two approaches would lead to different results, corresponding to the fact that extending the power tower with a 10 at the bottom is then not the same as extending it with a 10 at the top (but, of course, similar remarks apply if the whole power tower consists of copies of the same number, different from 10).

If the height of the tower is large, the various representations for large numbers can be applied to the height itself. If the height is given only approximately,  giving a value at the top does not make sense, so we can use the double-arrow notation, e.g. &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow(7.21\times 10^8)&lt;/math&gt;. If the value after the double arrow is a very large number itself, the above can recursively be applied to that value.

Examples:
:&lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow 10^{\,\!10^{10^{3.81\times 10^{17}}}}&lt;/math&gt; (between &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 3&lt;/math&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow 10\uparrow\uparrow (10\uparrow)^{497}(9.73\times 10^{32})=(10\uparrow\uparrow)^{2} (10\uparrow)^{497}(9.73\times 10^{32})&lt;/math&gt; (between &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 5&lt;/math&gt;)

Similarly to the above, if the exponent of &lt;math&gt;(10\uparrow)&lt;/math&gt; is not exactly given then giving a value at the right does not make sense, and we can, instead of using the power notation of &lt;math&gt;(10\uparrow)&lt;/math&gt;, add 1 to the exponent of &lt;math&gt;(10\uparrow\uparrow)&lt;/math&gt;, so we get e.g. &lt;math&gt;(10\uparrow\uparrow)^{3} (2.8\times 10^{12})&lt;/math&gt;.

If the exponent of &lt;math&gt;(10\uparrow \uparrow)&lt;/math&gt; is large, the various representations for large numbers can be applied to this exponent itself. If this exponent is not exactly given then, again, giving a value at the right does not make sense, and we can, instead of using the power notation of &lt;math&gt;(10\uparrow \uparrow)&lt;/math&gt;, use the triple arrow operator, e.g. &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow(7.3\times 10^{6})&lt;/math&gt;.

If the right-hand argument of the triple arrow operator is large the above applies to it, so we have e.g. &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow(10\uparrow\uparrow)^{2} (10\uparrow)^{497}(9.73\times 10^{32})&lt;/math&gt; (between &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 5&lt;/math&gt;). This can be done recursively, so we can have a power of the triple arrow operator.

We can proceed with operators with higher numbers of arrows, written &lt;math&gt;\uparrow^n&lt;/math&gt;.

Compare this notation with the [[hyper operator]] and the [[Conway chained arrow notation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;a\uparrow^n b&lt;/math&gt; = ( ''a'' → ''b'' → ''n'' ) = hyper(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;''b'')
An advantage of the first is that when considered as function of ''b'', there is a natural notation for powers of this function (just like when writing out the ''n'' arrows): &lt;math&gt;(a\uparrow^n)^k b&lt;/math&gt;. For example:

:&lt;math&gt;(10\uparrow^2)^3 b&lt;/math&gt; = ( 10 → ( 10 → ( 10 → ''b'' → 2 ) → 2 ) → 2 )
and only in special cases the long nested chain notation is reduced; for ''b'' = 1 we get:
:&lt;math&gt;10\uparrow^3 3 = (10\uparrow^2)^3 1&lt;/math&gt; = ( 10 → 3 → 3 )

Since the ''b'' can also be very large, in general we write a number with a sequence of powers &lt;math&gt;(10 \uparrow^n)^{k_n}&lt;/math&gt; with decreasing values of ''n'' (with exactly given integer exponents &lt;math&gt;{k_n}&lt;/math&gt;) with at the end a number in ordinary scientific notation. Whenever a &lt;math&gt;{k_n}&lt;/math&gt; is too large to be given exactly, the value of &lt;math&gt;{k_{n+1}}&lt;/math&gt; is increased by 1 and everything to the right of &lt;math&gt;({n+1})^{k_{n+1}}&lt;/math&gt; is rewritten.

For describing numbers approximately, deviations from the decreasing order of values of ''n'' are not needed. For example, &lt;math&gt;10 \uparrow (10 \uparrow \uparrow)^5 a=(10 \uparrow \uparrow)^6 a&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;10 \uparrow (10 \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow 3)=10 \uparrow \uparrow (10 \uparrow \uparrow 10 + 1)\approx 10 \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow 3&lt;/math&gt;. Thus we have the somewhat counterintuitive result that a number ''x'' can be so large that, in a way, ''x'' and 10&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; are "almost equal" (for arithmetic of large numbers see also below).

If the superscript of the upward arrow is large, the various representations for large numbers can be applied to this superscript itself. If this superscript is not exactly given then there is no point in raising the operator to a particular power or to adjust the value on which it acts. We can simply use a standard value at the right, say 10, and the expression reduces to &lt;math&gt;10 \uparrow^n 10=(10 \to 10 \to n)&lt;/math&gt; with an approximate ''n''. For such numbers the advantage of using the upward arrow notation no longer applies, and we can also use the chain notation.

The above can be applied recursively for this ''n'', so we get the notation &lt;math&gt;\uparrow^n&lt;/math&gt; in the superscript of the first arrow, etc., or we have a nested chain notation, e.g.:

:(10 → 10 → (10 → 10 → &lt;math&gt;3 \times 10^5&lt;/math&gt;) ) = &lt;math&gt;10 \uparrow ^{10 \uparrow ^{3 \times 10^5} 10} 10 &lt;/math&gt;

If the number of levels gets too large to be convenient, a notation is used where this number of levels is written down as a number (like using the superscript of the arrow instead of writing many arrows). Introducing a function &lt;math&gt;f(n)=10 \uparrow^{n} 10&lt;/math&gt; = (10 → 10 → ''n''), these levels become functional powers of ''f'', allowing us to write a number in the form &lt;math&gt;f^m(n)&lt;/math&gt; where ''m'' is given exactly and n is an integer which may or may not be given exactly (for the example: &lt;math&gt;f^2(3 \times 10^5)&lt;/math&gt;. If ''n'' is large we can use any of the above for expressing it. The "roundest" of these numbers are those of the form ''f''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;(1) = (10→10→''m''→2). For example, &lt;math&gt;(10 \to 10 \to 3\to 2) = 10 \uparrow ^{10 \uparrow ^{10^{10}} 10} 10 &lt;/math&gt;

Compare the definition of [[Graham's number]]: it uses numbers 3 instead of 10 and has 64 arrow levels and the number 4 at the top; thus &lt;math&gt; G &lt; 3\rightarrow 3\rightarrow 65\rightarrow 2 &lt;(10 \to 10 \to 65\to 2)=f^{65}(1)&lt;/math&gt;, but also &lt;math&gt; G &lt; f^{64}(4)&lt;f^{65}(1)&lt;/math&gt;.

If ''m'' in &lt;math&gt;f^m(n)&lt;/math&gt; is too large to give exactly we can use a fixed ''n'', e.g. ''n'' = 1, and apply the above recursively to ''m'', i.e., the number of levels of upward arrows is itself represented in the superscripted upward-arrow notation, etc. Using the functional power notation of ''f'' this gives multiple levels of ''f''. Introducing a function &lt;math&gt;g(n)=f^{n}(1)&lt;/math&gt; these levels become functional powers of ''g'', allowing us to write a number in the form &lt;math&gt;g^m(n)&lt;/math&gt; where ''m'' is given exactly and n is an integer which may or may not be given exactly. We have (10→10→''m''→3) = ''g''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;(1). If ''n'' is large we can use any of the above for expressing it. Similarly we can introduce a function ''h'', etc. If we need many such functions we can better number them instead of using a new letter every time, e.g. as a subscript, so we get numbers of the form &lt;math&gt;f_k^m(n)&lt;/math&gt; where ''k'' and ''m'' are given exactly and n is an integer which may or may not be given exactly. Using ''k''=1 for the ''f'' above, ''k''=2 for ''g'', etc., we have (10→10→''n''→''k'') = &lt;math&gt;f_k(n)=f_{k-1}^n(1)&lt;/math&gt;. If ''n'' is large we can use any of the above for expressing it. Thus we get a nesting of forms &lt;math&gt;{f_k}^{m_k}&lt;/math&gt; where going inward the ''k'' decreases, and with as inner argument a sequence of powers &lt;math&gt;(10 \uparrow^n)^{p_n}&lt;/math&gt; with decreasing values of ''n'' (where all these numbers are exactly given integers) with at the end a number in ordinary scientific notation.

When ''k'' is too large to be given exactly, the number concerned can be expressed as &lt;math&gt;{f_n}(10)&lt;/math&gt;=(10→10→10→''n'') with an approximate ''n''. Note that the process of going from the sequence &lt;math&gt;10^{n}&lt;/math&gt;=(10→''n'') to the sequence &lt;math&gt;10 \uparrow^n 10&lt;/math&gt;=(10→10→''n'') is very similar to going from the latter to the sequence &lt;math&gt;{f_n}(10)&lt;/math&gt;=(10→10→10→''n''): it is the general process of adding an element 10 to the chain in the chain notation; this process can be repeated again (see also the previous section). Numbering the subsequent versions of this function a number can be described using functions &lt;math&gt;{f_{qk}}^{m_{qk}}&lt;/math&gt;, nested in [[lexicographical order]] with ''q'' the most significant number, but with decreasing order for ''q'' and for ''k''; as inner argument we have a sequence of powers &lt;math&gt;(10 \uparrow^n)^{p_n}&lt;/math&gt; with decreasing values of ''n'' (where all these numbers are exactly given integers) with at the end a number in ordinary scientific notation.

For a number too large to write down in the Conway chained arrow notation we can describe how large it is by the length of that chain, for example only using elements 10 in the chain; in other words, we specify its position in the sequence 10, 10→10, 10→10→10, .. If even the position in the sequence is a large number we can apply the same techniques again for that.

== Comparison of base values ==
The following illustrates the effect of a base different from 10, base 100. It also illustrates representations of numbers, and the arithmetic.

&lt;math&gt;100^{12}=10^{24}&lt;/math&gt;, with base 10 the exponent is doubled.

&lt;math&gt;100^{100^{12}}=10^{2*10^{24}}&lt;/math&gt;, ditto.

&lt;math&gt;100^{100^{100^{12}}} \approx 10^{10^{2*10^{24}+0.30103}}&lt;/math&gt;, the highest exponent is very little more than doubled (increased by log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;2).

*&lt;math&gt;100\uparrow\uparrow 2=10^ {200} &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;100\uparrow\uparrow 3=10^ {2 \times 10^ {200}}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;100\uparrow\uparrow 4=(10\uparrow)^2 (2 \times 10^ {200}+0.3)=(10\uparrow)^2 (2\times 10^ {200})=(10\uparrow)^3 200.3=(10\uparrow)^4 2.3&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;100\uparrow\uparrow n=(10\uparrow)^{n-2} (2 \times 10^ {200})=(10\uparrow)^{n-1} 200.3=(10\uparrow)^{n}2.3&lt;10\uparrow\uparrow (n+1)&lt;/math&gt; (thus if ''n'' is large it seems fair to say that &lt;math&gt;100\uparrow\uparrow n&lt;/math&gt; is "approximately equal to" &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow n&lt;/math&gt;)
*&lt;math&gt;100\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 2=(10\uparrow)^{98} (2 \times 10^ {200})=(10\uparrow)^{100} 2.3&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;100\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 3=10\uparrow\uparrow(10\uparrow)^{98} (2 \times 10^ {200})=10\uparrow\uparrow(10\uparrow)^{100} 2.3&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;100\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow n=(10\uparrow\uparrow)^{n-2}(10\uparrow)^{98} (2 \times 10^ {200})=(10\uparrow\uparrow)^{n-2}(10\uparrow)^{100} 2.3&lt;10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow (n+1)&lt;/math&gt; (compare &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow n=(10\uparrow\uparrow)^{n-2}(10\uparrow)^{10}1&lt;10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow (n+1)&lt;/math&gt;; thus if ''n'' is large it seems fair to say that &lt;math&gt;100\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow n&lt;/math&gt; is "approximately equal to" &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow n&lt;/math&gt;)
*&lt;math&gt;100\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 2=(10\uparrow\uparrow)^{98}(10\uparrow)^{100} 2.3&lt;/math&gt; (compare &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 2=(10\uparrow\uparrow)^{8}(10\uparrow)^{10}1&lt;/math&gt;)
*&lt;math&gt;100\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 3=10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow(10\uparrow\uparrow)^{98}(10\uparrow)^{100} 2.3&lt;/math&gt; (compare &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 3=10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow(10\uparrow\uparrow)^{8}(10\uparrow)^{10}1&lt;/math&gt;)
*&lt;math&gt;100\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow n=(10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow)^{n-2}(10\uparrow\uparrow)^{98}(10\uparrow)^{100} 2.3&lt;/math&gt; (compare &lt;math&gt;10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow n=(10\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow)^{n-2}(10\uparrow\uparrow)^{8}(10\uparrow)^{10}1&lt;/math&gt;; if ''n'' is large this is "approximately" equal)

== Accuracy ==

Note that for a number &lt;math&gt;10^n&lt;/math&gt;, one unit change in ''n'' changes the result by a factor 10. In a number like &lt;math&gt;10^{\,\!6.2 \times 10^3}&lt;/math&gt;, with the 6.2 the result of proper rounding using significant figures, the true value of the exponent may be 50 less or 50 more. Hence the result may be a factor &lt;math&gt;10^{50}&lt;/math&gt; too large or too small. This seems like extremely poor accuracy, but for such a large number it may be considered fair (a large error in a large number may be "relatively small" and therefore acceptable).

=== Accuracy for very large numbers ===

In the case of an approximation of an extremely large number, the relative error may be large, yet there may still be a sense in which we want to consider the numbers as "close in magnitude". For example, consider

:&lt;math&gt;10^{10}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;10^9&lt;/math&gt;

The relative error is

:&lt;math&gt;1 - \frac{10^9}{10^{10}} = 1 - \frac{1}{10} = 90\%&lt;/math&gt;

a large relative error. However, we can also consider the relative error in the [[logarithms]]; in this case, the logarithms (to base 10) are 10 and 9, so the relative error in the logarithms is only 10%.

The point is that [[exponential function]]s magnify relative errors greatly – if ''a'' and ''b'' have a small relative error,

:&lt;math&gt;10^a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;10^b&lt;/math&gt;

the relative error is larger, and

:&lt;math&gt;10^{10^a}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;10^{10^b}&lt;/math&gt;

will have even larger relative error. The question then becomes: on which level of iterated logarithms do we wish to compare two numbers? There is a sense in which we may want to consider

:&lt;math&gt;10^{10^{10}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;10^{10^9}&lt;/math&gt;

to be "close in magnitude". The relative error between these two numbers is large, and the relative error between their logarithms is still large; however, the relative error in their second-iterated logarithms is small:

:&lt;math&gt;\log_{10}(\log_{10}(10^{10^{10}})) = 10&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\log_{10}(\log_{10}(10^{10^9})) = 9&lt;/math&gt;

Such comparisons of iterated logarithms are common, e.g., in [[analytic number theory]].

===Approximate arithmetic for very large numbers===

There are some general rules relating to the usual arithmetic operations performed on very large numbers:

*The sum and the product of two very large numbers are both "approximately" equal to the larger one.
*&lt;math&gt;(10^a)^{\,\!10^b}=10^{a 10^b}=10^{10^{b+\log _{10} a}}&lt;/math&gt;
Hence:
*A very large number raised to a very large power is "approximately" equal to the larger of the following two values: the first value and 10 to the power the second. For example, for very large n we have &lt;math&gt;n^n\approx 10^n&lt;/math&gt; (see e.g. [[Steinhaus-Moser notation#Mega|the computation of mega]]) and also &lt;math&gt;2^n\approx 10^n&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;2\uparrow\uparrow 65536 \approx 10\uparrow\uparrow 65533&lt;/math&gt;, see [[Knuth's up-arrow notation#Tables of values|table]].

== Large numbers in some noncomputable sequences ==

The [[busy beaver]] function Σ is an example of a function which grows faster than any [[Computability theory (computer science)|computable]] function. Its value for even relatively small input is huge. The  values of Σ(''n'') for ''n'' = 1, 2, 3, 4 are 1, 4, 6, 13 {{OEIS|id=A028444}}. Σ(5) is not known but is definitely ≥ 4098. Σ(6) is at least 3.5×10&lt;sup&gt;18267&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Infinite numbers ==
{{Main article|cardinal number}}
{{See also|large cardinal|Mahlo cardinal|totally indescribable cardinal}}
Although all the numbers discussed above are very large, they are all still decidedly [[finite set|finite]].  Certain fields of mathematics define [[Infinity|infinite]] and [[transfinite number]]s. For example, [[aleph-null]] is the [[cardinality]] of the [[infinite set]] of [[natural number]]s, and [[aleph-one]] is the next greatest cardinal number. &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[cardinality of the continuum|cardinality of the reals]].  The proposition that &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c} = \aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; is known as the [[continuum hypothesis]].

== Notations ==
Some notations for extremely large numbers:
*[[Knuth's up-arrow notation]]/[[hyperoperator]]s/[[Ackermann function]], including [[tetration]]
*[[Conway chained arrow notation]]
*[[Steinhaus-Moser notation]]; apart from the method of construction of large numbers, this also involves a graphical notation  with [[polygon]]s. Alternative notations, like a more conventional function notation, can also be used with the same functions.
*[[Bird's array notation]]
These notations are essentially functions of integer variables, which increase very rapidly with those integers. Ever-faster-increasing functions can easily be constructed recursively by applying these functions with large integers as argument.

A function with a vertical asymptote is not helpful in defining a very large number, although the function increases very rapidly: one has to define an argument very close to the asymptote, i.e. use a very small number, and constructing that is equivalent to constructing a very large number, e.g. the reciprocal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1160">In the [[philosophy of mathematics]], specifically the philosophical foundations of [[set theory]], '''limitation of size''' is a concept developed by [[Philip Jourdain]] and/or [[Georg Cantor]] to avoid [[Cantor's paradox]]. It identifies certain "inconsistent multiplicities", in Cantor's terminology, that cannot be [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] because they are "too large". In modern terminology these are called [[class (set theory)|proper classes]].

==Use==
The [[axiom of limitation of size]] is an axiom in some versions of [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]] or [[Morse–Kelley set theory]]. This axiom says that any class which is not "too large" is a set, and a set cannot be "too large". "Too large" is defined as being large enough that the class of all sets can be mapped one-to-one into it.

This is a list of some of the more commonly known problems that are [[NP-complete]] when expressed as [[decision problem]]s. As there are hundreds of such problems known, this list is in no way comprehensive. Many problems of this type can be found in {{harvtxt|Garey|Johnson|1979}}.

==Graphs and hypergraphs==
[[Graph theory|Graphs]] occur frequently in everyday applications. Examples include biological or social networks, which contain hundreds, thousands and even billions of nodes in some cases (e.g. [[Facebook]] or [[LinkedIn]]).

In mathematics, the [[definite integral]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)\, dx&lt;/math&gt;

is the area of the region in the ''xy''-plane bounded by the graph of ''f'', the ''x''-axis, and the lines ''x'' = ''a'' and ''x'' = ''b'', such that area above the ''x''-axis adds to the total, and that below the ''x''-axis subtracts from the total.

The [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] establishes the relationship between indefinite and definite integrals and introduces a technique for evaluating definite integrals.

If the interval is infinite the definite integral is called an ''improper integral'' and defined by using appropriate limiting procedures. for example:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^\infty f(x)\, dx=\lim_{b\to\infty}\left[\int_a^b f(x)\, dx\right]&lt;/math&gt;

A constant, such pi, that may be defined by the integral of an algebraic function over an algebraic domain is known as a [[Ring of periods|period]].

The following is a list of the most common definite [[Integral]]s. For a list of [[indefinite integral]]s see ''[[List of integrals|List of indefinite integrals]]''

[[Image:Knot table.svg|thumb|350px|right|A table of all [[prime knot]]s with seven [[Crossing number (knot theory)|crossings]] or fewer (not including mirror images).]]

This article contains a '''list of [[knot (mathematics)|mathematical knots]] and [[link (knot theory)|links]]'''. See also [[list of knots]], [[list of geometric topology topics]].

==Knots==
===Prime knots===
{{See also|List of prime knots}}
*0₁ knot/[[Unknot]] - a simple un-knotted closed loop
*3₁ knot/[[Trefoil knot]] - (2,3)-torus knot, the two loose ends of a common overhand knot joined together
*4₁ knot/[[Figure-eight knot (mathematics)]] - a prime knot with a crossing number four
*5₁ knot/[[Cinquefoil knot]], (5,2)-torus knot, Solomon's seal knot, pentafoil knot - a prime knot with crossing number five which can be arranged as a pentagram
*5₂ knot/[[Three-twist knot]] - the twist knot with three-half twists
*6₁ knot/[[Stevedore knot (mathematics)]] - a prime knot with crossing number six, it can also be described as a twist knot with four twists
*[[6₂ knot]] - a prime knot with crossing number six
*[[6₃ knot]] - a prime knot with crossing number six
*[[7₁ knot]], septafoil knot, (7,2)-torus knot - a prime knot with crossing number seven, which can be arranged as a {7,2} star polygon
*[[7₄ knot]], "endless knot"
*[[Carrick mat|8&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; knot]], "carrick mat"
*10₁₆₁/[[Perko pair]]
*12n242/[[(−2,3,7) pretzel knot]]
*(''p'',&amp;nbsp;''q'')-[[torus knot]] - a special kind of knot that lies on the surface of an unknotted torus in R&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

===Composite===
*[[Square knot (mathematics)]] - a composite knot obtained by taking the connected sum of a trefoil knot with its reflection
*[[Granny knot (mathematics)]] - a composite knot obtained by taking the connected sum of two identical trefoil knots

==Links==
*0{{sup sub|2|1}} link/[[Unlink]] - equivalent under ambient isotopy to finitely many disjoint circles in the plane
*2{{sup sub|2|1}} link/[[Hopf link]] - the simplest nontrivial link with more than one component; it consists of two circles linked together exactly once (L2a1)
*4{{sup sub|2|1}} link/[[Solomon's knot]] (a two component "link" rather than a one component "knot") - a traditional decorative motif used since ancient times (L4a1)
*5{{sup sub|2|1}} link/[[Whitehead link]] - two projections of the unknot: one circular loop and one figure eight-shaped loop intertwined such that they are inseparable and neither loses its form (L5a1)
*[[Brunnian link]] - a nontrivial link that becomes trivial if any component is removed
*6{{sup sub|3|2}} link/[[Borromean rings]] - three topological circles which are linked and form a Brunnian link (L6a4)
*[[L10a140 link]] - presumably the simplest non-Borromean Brunnian link
*[[Pretzel link]] -  a [[Montesinos link]] with integer tangles

[[File:Mobius Strip.jpg|thumb|upright|Large [[Möbius strip]] with traveling arrow]]
'''''Mathematica: A World of Numbers… and Beyond''''' is a [[kinetic art|kinetic]] and static exhibition of mathematical concepts designed by [[Charles and Ray Eames]], originally debuted at the [[California Museum of Science and Industry]] in 1961. Duplicates have since been made, and they (as well as the original) have been moved to other institutions.

==History==
[[File:Multiplication Machine.jpg|thumb|left|Multiplication machine]]
[[File:The Pseudosphere.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pseudosphere]] model]]
In March, 1961 a new science  wing at the [[California Museum of Science and Industry]]&lt;ref name="CMS"&gt;Called the [[California Science Center]] since 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; in Los Angeles opened. The [[IBM|IBM Corporation]] had been asked by the Museum to make a contribution; IBM in turn asked the famous California designer team of [[Charles and Ray Eames|Charles Eames]] and his wife [[Charles and Ray Eames|Ray Eames]] to come up with a good proposal. The result was that the Eames Office was commissioned by IBM to design an interactive exhibition called ''Mathematica: A World of Numbers... and Beyond''.&lt;ref name="rights"&gt;The physical component of the exhibit was owned by the museum, it was financially supported by IBM, and the Eames Office retained the artistic property rights.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first of many exhibitions designed by the Eames Office.

The {{convert|3000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} exhibition stayed at the Museum until January 1998, making it the longest running of any corporate sponsored museum exhibition.&lt;ref name=DBoom&gt;{{cite web|title=mathematica: a world of numbers... |url=http://www.designboom.com/eng/funclub/mathematica.html |work=DesignBoom |publisher=designboom.com |accessdate=14 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221224931/http://www.designboom.com/eng/funclub/mathematica.html |archivedate=21 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it is the only one of the dozens of exhibitions designed by the Office of Charles and Ray Eames that is still extant. This original ''Mathematica'' exhibition was reassembled for display at the Alyce de Roulet Williamson Gallery at [[Art Center College of Design]] in [[Pasadena, California]], July 30 through October 1, 2000. It is now owned by and on display at the [[New York Hall of Science]], though it now lacks the overhead plaques with quotations from mathematicians that were part of the original installation.&lt;ref name=Nysci&gt;{{cite web|title=Mathematica|url=http://nysci.org/mathematica/|publisher=New York Hall of Science|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duplicates===
In November, 1961 an exact duplicate was made for Chicago's [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]], where it was shown until late 1980. From there it was sold and relocated to the [[Museum of Science (Boston)|Museum of Science]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], where it is permanently on display. In January 2014, the exhibit temporarily closed to undergo a much-needed year-long refurbishment, and reopened in a new location at the Museum of Science in April 2015. The Boston installation bears the closest resemblance to the original Eames design, including numerous overhead plaques featuring historic quotations from famous mathematicians.&lt;ref name=MOSBoston&gt;{{cite web|title=Mathematica|url=http://www.mos.org/exhibits/mathematica|work=Museum of Science|publisher=The Museum of Science, Boston|accessdate=2015-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the refurbishment, a graphic panel was added to supplement the History Wall timeline to recognize the contributions of both men and women mathematicians of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.  

Another copy was made for the IBM Pavilion at the [[1964 New York World's Fair|1964/1965 New York World's Fair]].&lt;ref name="NY Exhibit"&gt;Mathematician [[Moon Duchin]] mentions the ''Mathematica'' exhibit at the World's Fair on page 28 of her paper "The Sexual Politics of Genius", University of Chicago [http://mduchin.math.tufts.edu/genius.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, it was briefly on display in [[Manhattan]], and was then installed in the [[Pacific Science Center]] in [[Seattle]] where it stayed until 1980. It was briefly re-installed in New York City at the 590 Madison Ave IBM Headquarters Building, before being moved to [[SciTrek]] in [[Atlanta]], but that organization was shut down in 2004 due to funding cuts. The exhibit was then shipped to [[Petaluma, California]] to Lucia Eames, the daughter of the original designers. {{asof|2015}}, the exhibit has been acquired by the [[Henry Ford Museum]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]].&lt;ref name="Ford"&gt;{{cite web|title=Henry Ford museum acquires Eames’ Mathematica exhibit|url=https://www.liveauctioneers.com/news/top-news/museums/henry-ford-museum-acquires-eames-mathematica-exhibit/|website=Auction Central News|publisher=LiveAuctioneers|accessdate=2018-03-06|date=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibits==
Some of the displays are minimally interactive, in that they start to operate at the push of a button. Other displays are motorized and run continuously, or operate automatically on a fixed cycle as long as power is supplied. The moving display elements combine with noise made by balls falling through the probability machine, to fill the exhibit space with an atmosphere of continuous activity.

* Large-scale [[bean machine]] showing the [[binomial distribution]] as an approximation of the [[normal distribution]] in [[probability theory]]
* [[Moebius strip]] with a motorized red arrow that can trace a complete circuit of the one-sided surface
* A curved funnel-shaped surface modeling a [[gravitational well]] using [[ball bearing]]s orbiting in ellipses

In addition, large placards hang from the ceiling, carrying interesting quotations from famous mathematicians. Some installations have omitted this feature, although it was an integral part of the original exhibition.

==''Men of Modern Mathematics'' poster==
In 1966, five years after the opening of the Mathematica Exhibit, IBM published a {{convert|2|x|12|ft|m|adj=on}} [[timeline]] poster, titled ''Men of Modern Mathematics''. It was based on the items displayed on the exhibit's History Wall, and free copies were distributed to schools.  The timeline covered the period from 1000 AD to approximately 1950 AD, and the poster featured biographical and historical items, along with numerous pictures showing progress in various areas of science, including architecture. The mathematical items in this chart were prepared by Professor [[Raymond Redheffer]]&lt;ref name="redheffer"&gt;Redheffer died in 2005, and the online memorial {{cite web|url=http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/inmemoriam/raymondredheffer.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327032756/http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/inmemoriam/raymondredheffer.htm |archivedate=2009-03-27 |df= }} at UCLA points out that even though he was an accomplished mathematician and lecturer, he was probably most famous for his work on the IBM chart.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[University of California Los Angeles|UCLA]]. Long after the chart was distributed, mathematics departments around the world have proudly displayed this chart on their walls.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the link given in the footnote on Redheffer&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, IBM Corporation released a free [[iPad]] application, ''Minds of Modern Mathematics'', based on the poster but updated to the present, including expanded coverage of [[List of women in mathematics|women mathematician]]s. The app was developed by IBM with the assistance of the Eames Office.&lt;ref name=iPadApp&gt;{{cite web|title=Free iPad App from IBM and Eames Office, Reinvents Iconic '60s-Era Infographic on History of Math|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/37247.wss|work=IBM News Room|publisher=IBM Corporation|accessdate=14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=iPadMail&gt;{{cite web|last=Thornhill|first=Ted|title=1,000 years of maths... via an app: IBM creates a (very long) iPad timeline history of geeks' favourite subject|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2127248/IBMs-iPad-timeline-history-1-000-years-mathematics.html|work=Mail Online|publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd.|accessdate=14 May 2012|date=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{asof|2018|03}}, the app has not been updated to run on current versions of [[iOS]], which only support 64-bit code.

[[File:Pythagorean proof (1).svg|300px|right|thumb|An example of "beauty in method"—a simple and elegant proof of the [[Pythagorean theorem]].]]

'''Mathematical beauty''' describes the notion that some [[mathematician]]s may derive [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] pleasure from their work, and from [[mathematics]] in general. They express this pleasure by describing mathematics (or, at least, some aspect of mathematics) as ''beautiful''. Mathematicians describe mathematics as an [[art]] form or, at a minimum, as a [[creativity|creative activity]]. Comparisons are often made with [[music]] and [[poetry]].

[[Bertrand Russell]] expressed his sense of mathematical beauty in these words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty—a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show. The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than Man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|authorlink=Bertrand Russell|title=Mysticism and Logic: And Other Essays|publisher=[[Longman]]|year=1919|page=60|chapter=The Study of Mathematics|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zwMQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=Mathematics+rightly+viewed+possesses+not+only+truth+but+supreme+beauty+a+beauty+cold+and+austere+like+that+of+sculpture+without+appeal+to+any+part+of+our+weaker+nature+without+the+gorgeous+trappings+inauthor:Russell|accessdate=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Paul Erdős]] expressed his views on the [[ineffability]] of mathematics when he said, "Why are numbers beautiful? It's like asking why is [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]] beautiful. If you don't see why, someone can't tell you. I ''know'' numbers are beautiful. If they aren't beautiful, nothing is".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Devlin|first=Keith|title=The Math Gene: How Mathematical Thinking Evolved And Why Numbers Are Like Gossip|publisher=[[Basic Books]]|year=2000|page=140|chapter=Do Mathematicians Have Different Brains?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AJdmfYEaLG4C|accessdate=2008-08-22|isbn=978-0-465-01619-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beauty in method==
Mathematicians describe an especially pleasing method of [[Mathematical proof|proof]] as ''[[Elegance|elegant]]''. Depending on context, this may mean:

* A proof that uses a minimum of additional assumptions or previous results.
* A proof that is unusually succinct.
* A proof that derives a result in a surprising way (e.g., from an apparently unrelated [[theorem]] or collection of theorems).
* A proof that is based on new and original insights.
* A method of proof that can be easily generalized to solve a family of similar problems.

In the search for an elegant proof, mathematicians often look for different independent ways to prove a result—the first proof that is found may not be the best. The theorem for which the greatest number of different proofs have been discovered is possibly the [[Pythagorean theorem]], with hundreds of proofs having been published.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elisha Scott Loomis]] published over 360 proofs in his book Pythagorean Proposition ({{isbn|0-873-53036-5}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Another theorem that has been proved in many different ways is the theorem of [[quadratic reciprocity]]—[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] alone published eight different proofs of this theorem.

Conversely, results that are logically correct but involve laborious calculations, over-elaborate methods, very conventional approaches, or that rely on a large number of particularly powerful [[axiom]]s or previous results are not usually considered to be elegant, and may be called ''ugly'' or ''clumsy''.

==Beauty in results==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Fermat's last theorem]] --&gt;
[[File:EulerIdentity2.svg|thumb|right|Starting at ''e''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1, travelling at the velocity ''i'' relative to one's position for the length of time π, and adding 1, one arrives at 0. (The diagram is an [[Argand diagram]])]]
Some mathematicians{{sfnp|Rota|1997|p=173}} see beauty in mathematical results that establish connections between two areas of mathematics that at first sight appear to be unrelated. These results are often described as ''deep''.

While it is difficult to find universal agreement on whether a result is deep, some examples are often cited. One is [[Euler's identity]]:&lt;ref name=Gallagher2014&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallagher|first=James|title=Mathematics: Why the brain sees maths as beauty|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-26151062|accessdate=13 February 2014|newspaper=BBC News online|date=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math display=block&gt;\displaystyle e^{i \pi} +1 = 0\, .&lt;/math&gt;

This is a special case of [[Euler's formula]], which the physicist [[Richard Feynman]] called "our jewel" and "the most remarkable formula in mathematics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard P.|last= Feynman|title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics |volume=I|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1977|isbn=0-201-02010-6|pages=22–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern examples include the [[modularity theorem]], which establishes an important connection between [[elliptic curve]]s and [[modular form]]s (work on which led to the awarding of the [[Wolf Prize]] to [[Andrew Wiles]] and [[Robert Langlands]]), and "[[monstrous moonshine]]", which connects the [[Monster group]] to [[modular function]]s via [[string theory]] for which [[Richard Borcherds]] was awarded the [[Fields Medal]].

Other examples of deep results include unexpected insights into mathematical structures. For example, Gauss's [[Theorema Egregium]] is a deep theorem which relates a local phenomenon ([[curvature]]) to a global phenomenon ([[area]]) in a surprising way. In particular, the area of a triangle on a curved surface is proportional to the excess of the triangle and the proportionality is curvature. Another example is the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] (and its vector versions including [[Green's theorem]] and [[Stokes' theorem]]).

The opposite of ''deep'' is ''trivial''. A trivial theorem may be a result that can be derived in an obvious and straightforward way from other known results, or which applies only to a specific set of particular objects such as the [[empty set]]. Sometimes, however, a statement of a theorem can be original enough to be considered deep, even though its proof is fairly obvious.

In his ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]'', [[G. H. Hardy|Hardy]] suggests that a beautiful proof or result possesses "inevitability", "unexpectedness", and "economy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A Mathematician's Apology|author=Hardy, G.H. | chapter = 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gian-Carlo Rota|Rota]], however, disagrees with unexpectedness as a sufficient condition for beauty and proposes a counterexample:
{{quote|A great many theorems of mathematics, when first published, appear to be surprising; thus for example some twenty years ago [from 1977] the proof of the existence of [[Exotic sphere|non-equivalent differentiable structures]] on spheres of high dimension was thought to be surprising, but it did not occur to anyone to call such a fact beautiful, then or now.{{sfnp|Rota|1997|p=172}} }}
Perhaps ironically, Monastyrsky writes:
{{quote|It is very difficult to find an analogous invention in the past to [[Milnor]]'s beautiful construction of the different differential structures on the seven-dimensional sphere... The original proof of Milnor was not very constructive, but later E. Briscorn showed that these differential structures can be described in an extremely explicit and beautiful form.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last = Monastyrsky|title=Some Trends in Modern Mathematics and the Fields Medal|year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This disagreement illustrates both the subjective nature of mathematical beauty and its connection with mathematical results: in this case, not only the existence of exotic spheres, but also a particular realization of them.

==Beauty in experience==
[[File:Compound of five cubes.png|thumb|222px|A "cold and austere beauty" has been attributed to the [[compound of five cubes]]]]
{{tone|section|date=March 2013}}
Interest in [[pure mathematics]] separate from [[Empirical research|empirical]] study has been part of the experience [[History of mathematics|of various civilizations]], including that of the [[Greek mathematics|ancient Greeks]], who "did mathematics for the beauty of it".&lt;ref&gt;Lang, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The aesthetic pleasure that [[mathematical physicist]]s tend to experience in Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]] has been attributed (by [[Paul Dirac]], among others) to its "great mathematical beauty".&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekhar, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; The beauty of mathematics is experienced when the [[reality|physical reality]] of objects are represented by [[mathematical models]]. [[Group theory]], developed in the early 1800s for the sole purpose of solving [[polynomial]] equations, became a fruitful way of categorizing [[elementary particle]]s—the building blocks of matter. Similarly, the study of [[knot theory|knots]] provides important insights into [[string theory]] and [[loop quantum gravity]].

Some believe that in order to appreciate mathematics, one must engage in doing mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=George|title=Mathematics Is Not a Spectator Sport|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|year=2005|chapter=Preface|isbn=0-387-25528-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=psFwdN6V6icC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;lpg=PR7&amp;dq=there+is+nothing+in+the+world+of+mathematics+that+corresponds+to+an+audience+in+a+concert+hall,+where+the+passive+listen+to+the+active.+Happily,+mathematicians+are+all+doers,+not+spectators.|accessdate=2008-08-22|quote="...there is nothing in the world of mathematics that corresponds to an audience in a concert hall, where the passive listen to the active. Happily, mathematicians are all ''doers'', not spectators.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are some teachers that encourage [[student engagement]] by teaching mathematics in a kinesthetic way (see [[kinesthetic learning]]). For example, [[Math Circle]] is an afterschool enrichment program where students do mathematics through games and activities; in a general Math Circle lesson, students use pattern finding, observation, and exploration to make their own mathematical discoveries. For example, mathematical beauty arises in a Math Circle activity on [[symmetry]] designed for 2nd and 3rd graders. In this activity, students create their own snowflakes by folding a square piece of paper and cutting out designs of their choice along the edges of the folded paper. When the paper is unfolded, a symmetrical design reveals itself. In a day to day elementary school mathematics class, symmetry can be presented as such in an artistic manner where students see aesthetically pleasing results in mathematics.

Some teachers prefer to use [[mathematical manipulatives]] to present mathematics in an aesthetically pleasing way. Examples of a manipulative include [[algebra tiles]], [[cuisenaire rods]], and [[pattern blocks]]. For example, one can teach the method of [[completing the square]] by using algebra tiles. Cuisenaire rods can be used to teach fractions, and pattern blocks can be used to teach geometry. Using mathematical manipulatives helps students gain a conceptual understanding that might not be seen immediately in written mathematical formulas.&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, E. (1989). Effects of Manipulative Materials in Mathematics Instruction. Journal for Research in Mathematics Education, 20, 498–505.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another example involves [[origami]]. Origami, the art of paper folding, has aesthetic qualities and many mathematical connections. One can study the [[mathematics of paper folding]] by observing the [[crease pattern]] on unfolded origami pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Hull, Thomas. "Project Origami: Activities for Exploring Mathematics". Taylor &amp; Francis, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Combinatorics]] (the study of counting) has artistic representations that some find mathematically beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;Brualdi, Richard. "Introductory Combinatorics." Pearson, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many visual examples that illustrate combinatorial concepts. Here are some topics and objects seen in combinatorics courses with visual representations:
* [[Four color theorem]]
* [[Young tableau]]
* [[Permutohedron]]
* [[Graph theory]]
* [[Partition of a set]]

==Beauty and philosophy==
Some mathematicians are of the opinion that the doing of mathematics is closer to discovery than invention, for example:
{{quote|There is no scientific discoverer, no poet, no painter, no musician, who will not tell you that he found ready made his discovery or poem or picture – that it came to him from outside, and that he did not consciously create it from within.
|[[William Kingdon Clifford]], from a lecture to the Royal Institution titled "Some of the conditions of mental development"}}
These mathematicians believe that the detailed and precise results of mathematics may be reasonably taken to be true without any dependence on the universe in which we live. For example, they would argue that the theory of the [[natural numbers]] is fundamentally valid, in a way that does not require any specific context. Some mathematicians have extrapolated this viewpoint that mathematical beauty is truth further, in some cases becoming [[mysticism]].

[[Pythagoras#Mathematics|Pythagorean mathematicians]] believed in the literal reality of numbers. The discovery of the existence of [[irrational number]]s was a shock to them, since they considered the existence of numbers not expressible as the ratio of two natural numbers to be a flaw in nature (the Pythagorean [[world view]] did not contemplate the [[Limit of a sequence|limits of infinite sequences]] of ratios of natural numbers—the modern notion of a [[real number]]). From a modern perspective, their mystical approach to numbers may be viewed as [[numerology]].

In [[Plato]]'s philosophy there were two worlds, the physical one in which we live and another abstract world which contained unchanging truth, including mathematics. He believed that the physical world was a mere reflection of the more perfect abstract world.

[[Hungary|Hungarian]] mathematician [[Paul Erdős]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Schechter, Bruce | title=My brain is open: The mathematical journeys of Paul Erdős | publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | location=New York | year=2000 | pages=70–71 | isbn = 0-684-85980-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; spoke of an imaginary book, in which God has written down all the most beautiful mathematical proofs. When Erdős wanted to express particular appreciation of a proof, he would exclaim "This one's from The Book!"

Twentieth-century French philosopher [[Alain Badiou]] claims that [[ontology]] is mathematics. Badiou also believes in deep connections between mathematics, poetry and philosophy.

In some cases, natural philosophers and other scientists who have made extensive use of mathematics have made leaps of inference between beauty and physical truth in ways that turned out to be erroneous. For example, at one stage in his life, [[Johannes Kepler]] believed that the proportions of the orbits of the then-known planets in the [[Solar System]] have been arranged by [[God]] to correspond to a concentric arrangement of the five [[Platonic solid]]s, each orbit lying on the [[Circumscribed sphere|circumsphere]] of one [[polyhedron]] and the [[Inscribed sphere|insphere]] of another. As there are exactly five Platonic solids, Kepler's hypothesis could only accommodate six planetary orbits and was disproved by the subsequent discovery of [[Uranus]].

==Beauty and mathematical information theory==
In the 1970s, [[Abraham Moles]] and [[Frieder Nake]] analyzed links between beauty, [[information processing]], and [[information theory]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Moles: ''Théorie de l'information et perception esthétique'', Paris, Denoël, 1973 ([[Information Theory]] and aesthetical perception)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F Nake (1974). Ästhetik als Informationsverarbeitung. ([[Aesthetics]] as information processing). Grundlagen und Anwendungen der Informatik im Bereich ästhetischer Produktion und Kritik. Springer, 1974, {{isbn|3-211-81216-4}}, {{isbn|978-3-211-81216-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] formulated a mathematical theory of observer-dependent subjective beauty based on [[algorithmic information theory]]: the most beautiful objects among subjectively comparable objects have short [[algorithmic information theory|algorithmic]] descriptions (i.e., [[Kolmogorov complexity]]) relative to what the observer already knows.&lt;ref&gt;J. Schmidhuber. [[Low-complexity art]]. [[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]], Journal of the International Society for the Arts, Sciences, and Technology ([[Leonardo, The International Society of the Arts, Sciences and Technology|Leonardo/ISAST]]), 30(2):97–103, 1997. {{doi|10.2307/1576418}}. {{JSTOR|1576418}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Schmidhuber. Papers on the theory of beauty and [[low-complexity art]] since 1994: http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/beauty.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Schmidhuber. Simple Algorithmic Principles of Discovery, Subjective Beauty, Selective Attention, Curiosity &amp; Creativity. Proc. 10th Intl. Conf. on Discovery Science (DS 2007) pp. 26–38, LNAI 4755, Springer, 2007. Also in Proc. 18th Intl. Conf. on Algorithmic Learning Theory (ALT 2007) p. 32, LNAI 4754, Springer, 2007. Joint invited lecture for DS 2007 and ALT 2007, Sendai, Japan, 2007. {{arXiv|0709.0674}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Schmidhuber explicitly distinguishes between beautiful and interesting. The latter corresponds to the [[first derivative]] of subjectively perceived beauty:
the observer continually tries to improve the [[predictability]] and [[Data compression|compressibility]] of the observations by discovering regularities such as repetitions and [[symmetries]] and [[fractal]] [[self-similarity]]. Whenever the observer's learning process (possibly a predictive artificial [[neural network]]) leads to improved data compression such that the observation sequence can be described by fewer [[bit]]s than before, the temporary interestingness of the data corresponds to the compression progress, and is proportional to the observer's internal curiosity reward.&lt;ref&gt;.J. Schmidhuber. Curious model-building control systems. International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, Singapore, vol 2, 1458–1463.

==Mathematics and the arts==
 {{Main|Mathematics and art|Mathematics and music|Mathematics and architecture}}

===Music===
Examples of the use of mathematics in music include the [[stochastic music]] of [[Iannis Xenakis]], [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci]] in [[Tool (band)|Tool]]'s [[Lateralus (song)|Lateralus]], counterpoint of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[polyrhythm]]ic structures (as in [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]''), the [[Metric modulation]] of [[Elliott Carter]], [[permutation]] theory in [[serialism]] beginning with [[Arnold Schoenberg]], and application of Shepard tones in [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]'s ''[[Hymnen]]''.

===Visual arts===
[[File:Della Pittura Alberti perspective pillars on grid.jpg|thumb|Diagram from [[Leon Battista Alberti]]'s 1435 ''[[Della Pittura]]'', with pillars in [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] on a grid]]

Examples of the use of mathematics in the visual arts include applications of [[chaos theory]] and [[fractal]] [[geometry]] to [[digital art|computer-generated art]], [[symmetry]] studies of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[projective geometry|projective geometries]] in development of the [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] theory of [[Renaissance]] art, [[grid (page layout)|grids]] in [[Op art]], optical geometry in the [[camera obscura]] of [[Giambattista della Porta]], and multiple perspective in analytic [[cubism]] and [[futurism]].

The Dutch graphic designer [[M. C. Escher]] created mathematically inspired [[woodcut]]s, [[lithograph]]s, and [[mezzotint]]s. These feature impossible constructions, explorations of [[infinity]], [[architecture]], visual [[paradox]]es and [[tessellation]]s. British constructionist artist [[John Ernest]] created reliefs and paintings inspired by group theory.&lt;ref&gt;John Ernest's use of mathematics and especially group theory in his art works is analysed in ''John Ernest, A Mathematical Artist'' by Paul Ernest in ''Philosophy of Mathematics Education Journal'', No. 24 Dec. 2009 (Special Issue on Mathematics and Art): http://people.exeter.ac.uk/PErnest/pome24/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other British artists of the constructionist and systems schools also draw on mathematics models and structures as a source of inspiration, including [[Anthony Hill (artist)|Anthony Hill]] and [[Peter Lowe (artist)|Peter Lowe]]. Computer-generated art is based on mathematical [[algorithm]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3190">{{other uses of|folk theorem|Folk theorem (disambiguation)}}

As the term is understood by [[mathematician]]s, '''folk mathematics''' or '''mathematical folklore''' is the body of theorems, definitions, proofs, or mathematical facts or techniques that circulate among mathematicians by word of mouth but have not appeared in print, either in books or in scholarly journals. Knowledge of folklore is the coin of the realm of academic mathematics.{{OR|date=July 2016}}

Quite important at times for researchers are '''folk theorems''', which are results known, at least to experts in a field, and considered to have established status, but not published in complete form. Sometimes these are only alluded to in the public literature. 
An example is a book of exercises, described on the back cover:
{{quote|This book contains almost 350 exercises in the basics of [[ring theory]]. The problems form the "folklore" of ring theory, and the solutions are given in as much detail as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Grigore Calugareau &amp; Peter Hamburg (1998) ''Exercises in Basic Ring Theory'', Kluwer,[{{isbn|0792349180}}]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another distinct category is '''wellknowable''' mathematics, a term introduced by [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]]. This consists of matters that are known and factual, but not in active circulation in relation with current research. Both of these concepts are attempts to describe the actual context in which research work is done.

Some people, principally non-mathematicians, use the term ''folk mathematics'' to refer to the [[informal mathematics]] studied in many ethno-cultural studies of mathematics.

==Stories, sayings and jokes==
{{See also|Mathematical joke}}
{{Wikiquote|Mathematics}}
{{Wikiquote|Mathematicians}}
Mathematical folklore may also refer to unusual (and possibly apocryphal) stories or jokes involving mathematicians or mathematics that are told verbally in mathematics departments. Compilations include tales collected in [[G. H. Hardy]]'s ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]'' and {{Harv|Krantz|2002}}; examples include:
*[[Galileo]] dropping weights from the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]].
*An apple falling on [[Isaac Newton]]'s head to inspire his theory of gravitation.
*The drinking, duel and early death of [[Galois]].
*[[Richard Feynman]] cracking safes in the Manhattan Project.
*[[Alfréd Rényi]]'s definition of a mathematician: "a device for turning coffee into theorems".
*The "[[turtles all the way down]]" story told by [[Stephen Hawking]].
*[[Fermat]]'s [[Fermat's Last Theorem#Fermat's conjecture|lost simple proof]].
*The unwieldy proof and associated controversies of the [[Four Color Theorem]].

A '''mathematical instrument''' is a tool or device used in the study or practice of [[mathematics]]. In [[geometry]], construction of various proofs was done using only a [[compass (drafting)|compass]] and [[straightedge]]; arguments in these proofs relied only on idealized properties of these instruments and literal construction was regarded as only an approximation. In [[applied mathematics]], mathematical instruments were used for measuring angles and distances, in [[astronomy]], [[navigation]], [[surveying]] and in the measurement of time.&lt;ref name=GLT98&gt;Gerard L'Estrange Turner ''Scientific Instruments, 1500-1900: An Introduction'' ( University of California Press, 1998) {{isbn|0520217284}} page 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Astrolabe (PSF).png|thumb|right| The [[astrolabe]] was an early mathematical instrument used in astronomy and navigation.]]
Instruments such as the [[astrolabe]], the [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]], and others were used to measure and accurately record the relative positions and movements of planets and other celestial objects. The [[sextant]] and other related instruments were essential for navigation at sea.  

Most instruments are used within the field of [[geometry]], including the [[ruler]], [[Caliper#Divider caliper|dividers]], [[protractor]], [[set square]], compass, [[ellipsograph]], [[T-square]] and [[opisometer]].  Others are used in [[arithmetic]] (for example the [[abacus]], [[slide rule]] and [[calculator]]) or in [[algebra]] (the [[integraph]]). In astronomy, many have said the pyramids (along with Stonehenge) were actually instruments used for tracking the stars over long periods or for the annual planting seasons.

==In schools==
The [[Oxford Set of Mathematical Instruments]] is a set of instruments used by generations of school children in the United Kingdom and around the world in mathematics and geometry lessons. It includes two set squares, a 180° protractor, a 15&amp;nbsp;cm ruler, a metal compass, a 9&amp;nbsp;cm pencil, a pencil sharpener, an eraser and a 10mm stencil.

'''Mathematical knowledge management (MKM)''' is the study of how society can effectively make use of the vast and growing literature on [[mathematics]]. It studies approaches such as [[database]]s of mathematical knowledge, automated processing of formulae and the use of [[semantic web|semantic information]], and [[artificial intelligence]]. Mathematics is particularly suited to a systematic study of automated knowledge processing due to the high degree of interconnectedness between different areas of mathematics.

Greek and Chinese perspectives |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
'''Mathematical practice''' comprises the working practices of professional [[mathematician]]s: selecting [[theorem]]s to prove, using informal notations to persuade themselves and others that various steps in the final proof are convincing, and seeking [[peer review]] and [[publication]], as opposed to the end result of [[mathematical proof|proven]] and published [[theorem]]s.

[[Philip Kitcher]] has proposed a more formal definition of a mathematical practice, as a quintuple. His intention was primarily to document mathematical practice through its historical changes.&lt;ref name="Ernest1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ernest|first=Paul|title=Social Constructivism as a Philosophy of Mathematics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TYeEjbRSAvQC&amp;pg=PA139|accessdate=19 September 2018|year=1998|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791435885|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical tradition==
{{unsourced|section|date=October 2018}}

The evolution of mathematical practice was slow, and some contributors to modern mathematics did not follow even the practice of their time.  For example, [[Pierre de Fermat]] was infamous for withholding his proofs, but nonetheless had a vast reputation for correct assertions of results.

One motivation to study mathematical practice is that, despite much work in the 20th century, some still feel that the [[foundations of mathematics]] remain unclear and ambiguous. One proposed remedy is to shift focus to some degree onto 'what is meant by a proof', and other such questions of method.

If mathematics has been informally used throughout history, in numerous cultures and continents, then it could be argued that "mathematical practice" is the practice, or use, of mathematics in everyday life.  One definition of mathematical practice, as described above, is the "working practices of professional mathematicians."  However, another definition, more in keeping with the predominant usage of mathematics, is that mathematical practice is the everyday practice, or use, of math.  Whether one is estimating the total cost of their groceries, calculating miles per gallon, or figuring out how many minutes on the treadmill that chocolate éclair will require, math as used by most people relies less on proof than on practicality (i. e., does it answer the question?).

==Teaching practice==
[[Mathematical teaching]] usually requires the use of several important teaching [[pedagogy|pedagogies]] or components.  Most [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE]], [[A-Level]] and [[undergraduate]] mathematics require the following components: 
# [[Textbook]]s or lecture notes which display the mathematical material to be covered/taught within the context of the teaching of mathematics.  This requires that the mathematical content being taught at the (say) undergraduate level is of a well documented and widely accepted nature that has been unanimously verified as being correct and meaningful within a mathematical context.
# Workbooks.  Usually, in order to ensure that students have an opportunity to learn and test the material that they have learnt, workbooks or question papers enable mathematical understanding to be tested.  It is not unknown for exam papers to draw upon questions from such test papers, or to require [[prerequisite]] knowledge of such test papers for mathematical progression.
# Exam papers and standardised (and preferably apolitical) testing methods.  Often, within countries such as the US, the UK (and, in all likelihood, China) there are standardised qualifications, examinations and workbooks that form the concrete teaching materials needed for secondary-school and pre-university courses (for example, within the UK, all students are required to sit or take Scottish Highers/Advanced Highers, A-levels or their equivalent in order to ensure that a certain minimal level of mathematical competence in a wide variety of topics has been obtained).  Note, however, that at the undergraduate, [[post-graduate]] and [[doctoral]] levels within these countries, there need not be any standardised process via which mathematicians of differing ability levels can be tested or examined. Other common test formats within the UK and beyond include the [[British Mathematical Olympiad|BMO]] (which is a multiple-choice test competition paper used in order to determine the best candidates that are to represent countries within the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]]).

Mathematicians seek and use [[patterns]]&lt;ref name=future/&gt;&lt;ref name=devlin/&gt; to formulate new [[conjecture]]s; they resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by [[mathematical proof]]. When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, then mathematical reasoning can provide insight or predictions about nature. Through the use of [[abstraction (mathematics)|abstraction]] and [[logic]], mathematics developed from [[counting]], [[calculation]], [[measurement]], and the systematic study of the [[shape]]s and [[motion (physics)|motions]] of physical objects. Practical mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as [[History of Mathematics|written records]] exist. The research required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry.

[[Logic|Rigorous arguments]] first appeared in [[Greek mathematics]], most notably in [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''. Since the pioneering work of [[Giuseppe Peano]] (1858–1932), [[David Hilbert]] (1862–1943), and others [[Foundations of mathematics|on axiomatic systems in the late 19th&amp;nbsp;century]], it has become customary to view mathematical research as establishing [[truth]] by [[Mathematical rigor|rigorous]] [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] from appropriately chosen [[axiom]]s and [[definition]]s. Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the [[Renaissance]], when mathematical innovations interacting with new [[timeline of scientific discoveries|scientific discoveries]] led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Eves, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematics is essential in many fields, including [[natural science]], engineering, medicine, finance and the [[social sciences]]. [[Applied mathematics]] has led to entirely new mathematical disciplines, such as statistics and [[game theory]]. Mathematicians engage in [[pure mathematics]], or mathematics for its own sake, without having any application in mind. Practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wigner1960 /&gt;

[[File:Bakhshali numerals 2.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The numerals used in the [[Bakhshali manuscript]], dated between the 2nd century BCE and the 2nd century CE.]]
The history of mathematics can be seen as an ever-increasing series of [[abstraction (mathematics)|abstractions]]. The first abstraction, which is shared by many animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Abstract representations of numbers in the animal and human brain |journal=Trends in Neurosciences |volume=21 |issue=8 |date=Aug 1998 |pages=355–61 |doi=10.1016/S0166-2236(98)01263-6 |pmid=9720604 |ref=harv |last1=Dehaene |first1=Stanislas |last2=Dehaene-Lambertz |first2=Ghislaine |last3=Cohen |first3=Laurent}}&lt;/ref&gt; was probably that of numbers: the realization that a collection of two apples and a collection of two oranges (for example) have something in common, namely quantity of their members.

As evidenced by [[tally sticks|tallies]] found on bone, in addition to recognizing how to [[counting|count]] physical objects, [[prehistoric]] peoples may have also recognized how to count abstract quantities, like time&amp;nbsp;– days, seasons, years.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Raymond L. Wilder, ''Evolution of Mathematical Concepts; an Elementary Study'', ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence for more complex mathematics does not appear until around 3000&amp;nbsp;[[Before Christ|BC]], when the [[Babylonia]]ns and Egyptians began using [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]] and [[geometry]] for taxation and other financial calculations, for building and construction, and for [[astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Kline 1990, Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The most ancient mathematical texts from [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] are from 2000–1800 BC. Many early texts mention [[Pythagorean triple]]s and so, by inference, the [[Pythagorean theorem]] seems to be the most ancient and widespread mathematical development after basic arithmetic and geometry. It is in [[Babylonian mathematics]] that [[elementary arithmetic]] ([[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]] and [[division (mathematics)|division]]) first appear in the archaeological record. The Babylonians also possessed a place-value system, and used a [[sexagesimal]] numeral system, still in use today for measuring angles and time.{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc="Mesopotamia" p. 24–27}}

Beginning in the 6th century BC with the [[Pythagoreans]], the [[Ancient Greeks]] began a systematic study of mathematics as a subject in its own right with [[Greek mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heath |first=Thomas Little |url=https://books.google.com/?id=drnY3Vjix3kC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=A History of Greek Mathematics: From Thales to Euclid |location=New York |publisher=Dover Publications |date=1981 |orig-year=originally published 1921 |isbn=978-0-486-24073-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 300 BC, [[Euclid]] introduced the [[axiomatic method]] still used in mathematics today, consisting of definition, axiom, theorem, and proof. His textbook ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' is widely considered the most successful and influential textbook of all time.{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc="Euclid of Alexandria" p. 119}} The greatest mathematician of antiquity is often held to be [[Archimedes]] (c. 287–212 BC) of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]].{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc="Archimedes of Syracuse" p. 120}} He developed formulas for calculating the surface area and volume of [[solids of revolution]] and used the [[method of exhaustion]] to calculate the [[area]] under the arc of a [[parabola]] with the [[Series (mathematics)|summation of an infinite series]], in a manner not too dissimilar from modern calculus.{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc="Archimedes of Syracuse" p. 130}} Other notable achievements of Greek mathematics are [[conic sections]] ([[Apollonius of Perga]], 3rd century BC),{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc="Apollonius of Perga" p. 145}} [[trigonometry]] ([[Hipparchus of Nicaea]] (2nd century BC),{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc= "Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration" p. 162}} and the beginnings of algebra ([[Diophantus]], 3rd century AD).{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc= "Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics" p. 180}}

The [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]] and the rules for the use of its operations, in use throughout the world today, evolved over the course of the first millennium AD in [[Indian mathematics|India]] and were transmitted to the [[Western world]] via [[Islamic mathematics]]. Other notable developments of Indian mathematics include the modern definition of [[sine]] and [[cosine]], and an early form of [[infinite series]].

During the [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age of Islam]], especially during the 9th and 10th&amp;nbsp;centuries, mathematics saw many important innovations building on Greek mathematics. The most notable achievement of [[Islamic mathematics]] was the development of [[algebra]]. Other notable achievements of the Islamic period are advances in [[spherical trigonometry]] and the addition of the [[decimal point]] to the Arabic numeral system. Many notable mathematicians from this period were Persian, such as [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi|Al-Khwarismi]], [[Omar Khayyam]] and [[Sharaf al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī]]. 

During the [[early modern period]], mathematics began to develop at an accelerating pace in [[Western Europe]]. The development of [[calculus]] by Newton and Leibniz in the 17th century revolutionized mathematics. [[Leonhard Euler]] was the most notable mathematician of the 18th century, contributing numerous theorems and discoveries. Perhaps the foremost mathematician of the 19th century was the German mathematician [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], who made numerous contributions to fields such as [[algebra]], [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], [[differential geometry and topology|differential geometry]], [[matrix theory]],[[number theory]], and [[statistics]]. In the early 20th century, [[Kurt Gödel]] transformed mathematics by publishing his [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorems]], which show that any axiomatic system that is consistent will contain unprovable propositions.

Mathematics has since been greatly extended, and there has been a fruitful interaction between mathematics and science, to the benefit of both. Mathematical discoveries continue to be made today. According to Mikhail B. Sevryuk, in the January&amp;nbsp;2006 issue of the ''[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]]'', "The number of papers and books included in the ''[[Mathematical Reviews]]'' database since 1940 (the first year of operation of MR) is now more than 1.9&amp;nbsp;million, and more than 75&amp;nbsp;thousand items are added to the database each year. The overwhelming majority of works in this ocean contain new mathematical [[theorem]]s and their [[mathematical proof|proofs]]."{{sfn|Sevryuk|2006|pp=101–09}}

===Etymology===
The word ''mathematics'' comes from [[Ancient Greek]] μάθημα (''máthēma''), meaning "that which is learnt",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=mathematic |publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mathematic&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307093926/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=mathematic&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |archivedate=March 7, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; "what one gets to know", hence also "study" and "science". The word for "mathematics" came to have the narrower and more technical meaning "mathematical study" even in Classical times.&lt;ref&gt;Both senses can be found in Plato. {{LSJ|maqhmatiko/s|μαθηματική|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its adjective is {{lang|grc|μαθηματικός}} (''mathēmatikós''), meaning "related to learning" or "studious", which likewise further came to mean "mathematical". In particular, {{lang|grc|μαθηματικὴ τέχνη}} (''mathēmatikḗ tékhnē''), {{lang-la|ars mathematica}}, meant "the mathematical art".

Similarly, one of the two main schools of thought in [[Pythagoreanism]] was known as the ''mathēmatikoi'' (μαθηματικοί)—which at the time meant "teachers" rather than "mathematicians" in the modern sense.

In Latin, and in English until around 1700, the term ''mathematics'' more commonly meant "astrology" (or sometimes "astronomy") rather than "mathematics"; the meaning gradually changed to its present one from about 1500 to 1800. This has resulted in several mistranslations. For example, [[Saint Augustine]]'s warning that Christians should beware of ''mathematici'', meaning astrologers, is sometimes mistranslated as a condemnation of mathematicians.&lt;ref name="Boas"&gt;{{cite book | title=Lion Hunting and Other Mathematical Pursuits: A Collection of Mathematics, Verse, and Stories by the Late Ralph P. Boas, Jr | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Boas, Ralph | authorlink=Ralph P. Boas Jr. | year=1995 | orig-year=1991 | page=257 | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f-EWj5WtQHgC&amp;pg=PA257 | chapter=What Augustine Didn't Say About Mathematicians}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The apparent plural form in English, like the French plural form {{lang|fr|les mathématiques}} (and the less commonly used singular derivative {{lang|fr|la mathématique}}), goes back to the Latin neuter plural {{lang|la|mathematica}} ([[Cicero]]), based on the Greek plural {{lang|el|τὰ μαθηματικά}} (''ta mathēmatiká''), used by [[Aristotle]] (384–322&amp;nbsp;BC), and meaning roughly "all things mathematical"; although it is plausible that English borrowed only the adjective ''mathematic(al)'' and formed the noun ''mathematics'' anew, after the pattern of ''[[physics]]'' and ''[[metaphysics]]'', which were inherited from Greek.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology]]'', ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', ''sub'' "mathematics", "mathematic", "mathematics"&lt;/ref&gt; In English, the noun ''mathematics'' takes a singular verb. It is often shortened to ''maths'' or, in North America, ''math''.&lt;ref name=maths&gt;[http://oed.com/view/Entry/114982 "maths, ''n.''"] and [http://oed.com/view/Entry/114962 "math, ''n.3''"].

==Definitions of mathematics==

[[File:Fibonacci.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leonardo Fibonacci]], the Italian mathematician who introduced the [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]] invented between the 1st and 4th&amp;nbsp;centuries by Indian mathematicians, to the Western World]]
Mathematics has [[definitions of mathematics|no generally accepted definition]].&lt;ref name=Mura/&gt;&lt;ref name=Runge/&gt; [[Aristotle]] defined mathematics as "the science of quantity", and this definition prevailed until the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Franklin"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mbn35b2ghgkC&amp;pg=PA104#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Philosophy of Mathematics |last=Franklin |first=James |date=2009-07-08 |isbn=9780080930589 |page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564–1642) said, "The universe cannot be read until we have learned the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is written. It is written in mathematical language, and the letters are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures, without which means it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word. Without these, one is wandering about in a dark labyrinth."&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus du Sautoy]], ''[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00sr3fm A Brief History of Mathematics: 1. Newton and Leibniz] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121206092629/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00sr3fm |date=December 6, 2012 }}'', [[BBC Radio 4]], September 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (1777–1855) referred to mathematics as "the Queen of the Sciences".&lt;ref name="Waltershausen"&gt;Waltershausen, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Peirce]] (1809–1880) called mathematics "the science that draws necessary conclusions".&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; David Hilbert said of mathematics: "We are not speaking here of arbitrariness in any sense. Mathematics is not like a game whose tasks are determined by arbitrarily stipulated rules. Rather, it is a conceptual system possessing internal necessity that can only be so and by no means otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;Hilbert, D. (1919–20), Natur und Mathematisches Erkennen: Vorlesungen, gehalten 1919–1920 in Göttingen. Nach der Ausarbeitung von Paul Bernays (Edited and with an English introduction by David E. Rowe), p. 14, Basel, Birkhäuser (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Einstein]] (1879–1955) stated that "as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality."&lt;ref name=certain/&gt;

Starting in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, when the study of mathematics increased in rigor and began to address abstract topics such as [[group theory]] and [[projective geometry]], which have no clear-cut relation to quantity and measurement, mathematicians and philosophers began to propose a variety of new definitions.&lt;ref name="Cajori"&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Mathematics |publisher=American Mathematical Society (1991 reprint) |author=Cajori, Florian |authorlink=Florian Cajori |year=1893 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mGJRjIC9fZgC&amp;pg=PA285 285–86] |isbn=978-0-8218-2102-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these definitions emphasize the deductive character of much of mathematics, some emphasize its abstractness, some emphasize certain topics within mathematics.

Three leading types of definition of mathematics are called [[logicist]], [[intuitionist]], and [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalist]], each reflecting a different philosophical school of thought.&lt;ref name=Snapper&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/2689412 |title=The Three Crises in Mathematics: Logicism, Intuitionism, and Formalism |journal=Mathematics Magazine |date=September 1979 |first=Ernst |last=Snapper |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=207–16 |id= |jstor=2689412 |ref=harv|bibcode=1975MathM..48...12G }}&lt;/ref&gt; All have severe problems, none has widespread acceptance, and no reconciliation seems possible.&lt;ref name=Snapper/&gt;

An early definition of mathematics in terms of logic was [[Benjamin Peirce]]'s "the science that draws necessary conclusions" (1870).&lt;ref name="Peirce"&gt;{{cite book |title=Linear Associative Algebra |author=Peirce, Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Peirce |year=1882 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=De0GAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906135700/https://books.google.com/books?id=De0GAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=September 6, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] advanced the philosophical program known as [[logicism]], and attempted to prove that all mathematical concepts, statements, and principles can be defined and proved entirely in terms of [[symbolic logic]]. A logicist definition of mathematics is Russell's "All Mathematics is Symbolic Logic" (1903).&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kj0a_aV2mxIC&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=5|title=The Principles of Mathematics|year=1903|last1=Russell|first1=Bertrand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intuitionist]] definitions, developing from the philosophy of mathematician [[L. E. J. Brouwer]], identify mathematics with certain mental phenomena. An example of an intuitionist definition is "Mathematics is the mental activity which consists in carrying out constructs one after the other."&lt;ref name=Snapper/&gt; A peculiarity of intuitionism is that it rejects some mathematical ideas considered valid according to other definitions. In particular, while other philosophies of mathematics allow objects that can be proved to exist even though they cannot be constructed, intuitionism allows only mathematical objects that one can actually construct.

[[Formalism (mathematics)|Formalist]] definitions identify mathematics with its symbols and the rules for operating on them. [[Haskell Curry]] defined mathematics simply as "the science of formal systems".&lt;ref name="Curry"&gt;{{cite book |title=Outlines of a Formalist Philosophy of Mathematics |publisher=Elsevier |author=Curry, Haskell |authorlink=Haskell Curry |year=1951 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tZHrBQgp1bkC 56] |isbn=978-0-444-53368-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[formal system]] is a set of symbols, or ''tokens'', and some ''rules'' telling how the tokens may be combined into ''formulas''. In formal systems, the word ''axiom'' has a special meaning, different from the ordinary meaning of "a self-evident truth". In formal systems, an axiom is a combination of tokens that is included in a given formal system without needing to be derived using the rules of the system.

===Mathematics as science===
[[File:Carl Friedrich Gauss.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], known as the prince of mathematicians]]
The German mathematician [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] referred to mathematics as "the Queen of the Sciences".&lt;ref name="Waltershausen"/&gt; More recently, [[Marcus du Sautoy]] has called mathematics "the Queen of Science&amp;nbsp;... the main driving force behind scientific discovery".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Nicolas Bourbaki |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00stcgv |access-date=26 October 2017 |series=A Brief History of Mathematics |first=Marcus |last=du Sautoy |station=BBC Radio 4 |date=25 June 2010 |time=min. 12:50 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216050402/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00stcgv |archivedate=December 16, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the original Latin ''Regina Scientiarum'', as well as in German ''Königin der Wissenschaften'', the word corresponding to ''science'' means a "field of knowledge", and this was the original meaning of "science" in English, also; mathematics is in this sense a field of knowledge. The specialization restricting the meaning of "science" to ''[[natural science]]'' follows the rise of [[Baconian method|Baconian science]], which contrasted "natural science" to [[scholasticism]], the [[Organon|Aristotelean method]] of inquiring from [[first principles]]. The role of empirical experimentation and observation is negligible in mathematics, compared to natural sciences such as [[biology]], [[chemistry]], or [[physics]]. [[Albert Einstein]] stated that "as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality."&lt;ref name=certain&gt;Einstein, p. 28. The quote is Einstein's answer to the question: "How can it be that mathematics, being after all a product of human thought which is independent of experience, is so admirably appropriate to the objects of reality?" This question was inspired by [[Eugene Wigner]]'s paper "[[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences]]".&lt;/ref&gt;

Many philosophers believe that mathematics is not experimentally [[falsifiability|falsifiable]], and thus not a science according to the definition of [[Karl Popper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Out of Their Minds: The Lives and Discoveries of 15 Great Computer Scientists |author1=Shasha, Dennis Elliot |author2=Lazere, Cathy A. |publisher=Springer |year=1998 |page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 1930s [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] convinced many mathematicians{{Who|date=January 2011}} that mathematics cannot be reduced to logic alone, and Karl Popper concluded that "most mathematical theories are, like those of [[physics]] and [[biology]], [[hypothesis|hypothetico]]-[[deductive]]: pure mathematics therefore turns out to be much closer to the natural sciences whose hypotheses are conjectures, than it seemed even recently."&lt;ref&gt;Popper 1995, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Other thinkers, notably [[Imre Lakatos]], have applied a version of [[falsificationism]] to mathematics itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Imre Lakatos]] (1976), ''[[Proofs and Refutations]]''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hps.elte.hu/~kutrovatz/LakatosEng.pdf |title=Gábor Kutrovátz, "Imre Lakatos's Philosophy of Mathematics" |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative view is that certain scientific fields (such as [[theoretical physics]]) are mathematics with axioms that are intended to correspond to reality. Mathematics shares much in common with many fields in the physical sciences, notably the [[deductive reasoning|exploration of the logical consequences]] of assumptions. [[Intuition (knowledge)|Intuition]] and experimentation also play a role in the formulation of [[conjecture]]s in both mathematics and the (other) sciences. [[Experimental mathematics]] continues to grow in importance within mathematics, and computation and simulation are playing an increasing role in both the sciences and mathematics.

The opinions of mathematicians on this matter are varied. Many mathematicians&lt;ref&gt;See, for example [[Bertrand Russell]]'s statement "Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty ..." in his ''History of Western Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; feel that to call their area a science is to downplay the importance of its aesthetic side, and its history in the traditional seven [[liberal arts]]; others{{Who|date=August 2009}} feel that to ignore its connection to the sciences is to turn a blind eye to the fact that the interface between mathematics and its applications in science and engineering has driven much development in mathematics. One way this difference of viewpoint plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematics is ''created'' (as in art) or ''discovered'' (as in science). It is common to see universities divided into sections that include a division of ''Science and Mathematics'', indicating that the fields are seen as being allied but that they do not coincide. In practice, mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists at the gross level but separated at finer levels. This is one of many issues considered in the [[philosophy of mathematics]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Mathematics arises from many different kinds of problems. At first these were found in commerce, [[land measurement]], architecture and later [[astronomy]]; today, all sciences suggest problems studied by mathematicians, and many problems arise within mathematics itself. For example, the [[physicist]] [[Richard Feynman]] invented the [[path integral formulation]] of [[quantum mechanics]] using a combination of mathematical reasoning and physical insight, and today's [[string theory]], a still-developing scientific theory which attempts to unify the four [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental forces of nature]], continues to inspire new mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Feynman Integral and Feynman's Operational Calculus |journal=Physics Today |volume=54 |issue=8 |page=48 |author=Meinhard E.

Some mathematics is relevant only in the area that inspired it, and is applied to solve further problems in that area. But often mathematics inspired by one area proves useful in many areas, and joins the general stock of mathematical concepts. A distinction is often made between [[pure mathematics]] and [[applied mathematics]]. However pure mathematics topics often turn out to have applications, e.g. [[number theory]] in [[cryptography]]. This remarkable fact, that even the "purest" mathematics often turns out to have practical applications, is what [[Eugene Wigner]] has called "[[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences|the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics]]".&lt;ref name=wigner1960&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wigner |first=Eugene |year=1960 |title=The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html |journal=[[Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics]] |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=1–14 |doi=10.1002/cpa.3160130102 |ref=harv |bibcode=1960CPAM...13....1W |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228152633/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html |archivedate=February 28, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As in most areas of study, the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization: there are now hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the latest [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] runs to 46&amp;nbsp;pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classification2010.pdf |title=Mathematics Subject Classification 2010 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514091144/http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classification2010.pdf |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several areas of applied mathematics have merged with related traditions outside of mathematics and become disciplines in their own right, including statistics, [[operations research]], and [[computer science]].

For those who are mathematically inclined, there is often a definite aesthetic aspect to much of mathematics. Many mathematicians talk about the ''elegance'' of mathematics, its intrinsic [[aesthetics]] and inner beauty. [[Simplicity]] and generality are valued. There is beauty in a simple and elegant [[proof (mathematics)|proof]], such as [[Euclid]]'s proof that there are infinitely many [[prime number]]s, and in an elegant [[numerical method]] that speeds calculation, such as the [[fast Fourier transform]]. [[G. H. Hardy]] in ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]'' expressed the belief that these aesthetic considerations are, in themselves, sufficient to justify the study of pure mathematics. He identified criteria such as significance, unexpectedness, inevitability, and economy as factors that contribute to a mathematical aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Mathematician's Apology |author=Hardy, G. H. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1940 |isbn=978-0-521-42706-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematicians often strive to find proofs that are particularly elegant, proofs from "The Book" of God according to [[Paul Erdős]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Proof and Other Dilemmas: Mathematics and Philosophy |author1=Gold, Bonnie|author1-link=Bonnie Gold |author2=Simons, Rogers A. |publisher=MAA |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Proofs from ''The Book'' |last1=Aigner |first1=Martin |last2=Ziegler |first2=Günter&amp;nbsp;M. |authorlink2=Günter M. Ziegler |publisher=Springer |year=2001 |isbn=978-3-540-40460-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of [[recreational mathematics]] is another sign of the pleasure many find in solving mathematical questions.

==Notation, language, and rigor==
{{main|Mathematical notation}}
[[File:Leonhard Euler 2.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Leonhard Euler]], who created and popularized much of the mathematical notation used today]]

Most of the mathematical notation in use today was not invented until the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathsym.html |title=Earliest Uses of Various Mathematical Symbols |publisher= |accessdate=September 14, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220073955/http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathsym.html |archivedate=February 20, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before that, mathematics was written out in words, limiting mathematical discovery.&lt;ref&gt;Kline, p. 140, on [[Diophantus]]; p. 261, on [[Franciscus Vieta|Vieta]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] (1707–1783) was responsible for many of the notations in use today. Modern notation makes mathematics much easier for the professional, but beginners often find it daunting. According to [[Barbara Oakley]], this can be attributed to the fact that mathematical ideas are both more ''abstract'' and more ''encrypted'' than those of natural language.&lt;ref&gt;Oakley 2014, p. 16: "Focused problem solving in math and science is often more effortful than focused-mode thinking involving language and people. This may be because humans haven't evolved over the millennia to manipulate mathematical ideas, which are frequently more abstractly encrypted than those of conventional language."&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike natural language, where people can often equate a word (such as ''cow'') with the physical object it corresponds to, mathematical symbols are abstract, lacking any physical analog.&lt;ref&gt;Oakley 2014, p. 16: "What do I mean by abstractness? You can point to a real live ''cow'' chewing its cud in a pasture and equate it with the letters ''c–o–w'' on the page. But you can't point to a real live ''plus sign'' that the symbol '+' is modeled after – the idea underlying the plus sign is more ''abstract''."&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematical symbols are also more highly encrypted than regular words, meaning a single symbol can encode a number of different operations or ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Oakley 2014, p. 16: "By ''encryptedness'', I mean that one symbol can stand for a number of different operations or ideas, just as the multiplication sign symbolizes repeated addition."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Language of mathematics|Mathematical language]] can be difficult to understand for beginners because even common terms, such as ''or'' and ''only'', have a more precise meaning than they have in everyday speech, and other terms such as ''[[open set|open]]'' and ''[[Field (mathematics)|field]]'' refer to specific mathematical ideas, not covered by their laymen's meanings. Mathematical language also includes many technical terms such as ''[[homeomorphism]]'' and ''[[Integral|integrable]]'' that have no meaning outside of mathematics. Additionally, shorthand phrases such as ''iff'' for "[[if and only if]]" belong to [[mathematical jargon]]. There is a reason for special notation and technical vocabulary: mathematics requires more precision than everyday speech. Mathematicians refer to this precision of language and logic as "rigor".

[[Mathematical proof]] is fundamentally a matter of [[rigor]]. Mathematicians want their theorems to follow from axioms by means of systematic reasoning. This is to avoid mistaken "[[theorem]]s", based on fallible intuitions, of which many instances have occurred in the history of the subject.{{efn|See ''[[false proof]]'' for simple examples of what can go wrong in a formal proof.}} The level of rigor expected in mathematics has varied over time: the Greeks expected detailed arguments, but at the time of [[Isaac Newton]] the methods employed were less rigorous. Problems inherent in the definitions used by Newton would lead to a resurgence of careful analysis and formal proof in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century. Misunderstanding the rigor is a cause for some of the common misconceptions of mathematics&lt;!--This part needs improvement |&gt;&gt;--&gt;. Today, mathematicians continue to argue among themselves about [[computer-assisted proof]]s. Since large computations are hard to verify, such proofs may not be sufficiently rigorous.&lt;ref&gt;Ivars Peterson, ''The Mathematical Tourist'', Freeman, 1988, {{isbn|0-7167-1953-3}}. p. 4 "A few complain that the computer program can't be verified properly", (in reference to the Haken–Apple proof of the Four Color Theorem).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Axiom]]s in traditional thought were "self-evident truths", but that conception is problematic.&lt;ref&gt;"The method of 'postulating' what we want has many advantages; they are the same as the advantages of theft over honest toil." [[Bertrand Russell]] (1919), ''Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy'', New York and London, [http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Quotations/Russell.html p. 71.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620162751/http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Quotations/Russell.html |date=June 20, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At a formal level, an axiom is just a string of symbols, which has an intrinsic meaning only in the context of all derivable formulas of an [[axiomatic system]]. It was the goal of [[Hilbert's program]] to put all of mathematics on a firm axiomatic basis, but according to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] every (sufficiently powerful) axiomatic system has [[independence (mathematical logic)|undecidable]] formulas; and so a final [[axiomatization]] of mathematics is impossible. Nonetheless mathematics is often imagined to be (as far as its formal content) nothing but [[set theory]] in some axiomatization, in the sense that every mathematical statement or proof could be cast into formulas within set theory.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Suppes, ''Axiomatic Set Theory'', Dover, 1972, {{isbn|0-486-61630-4}}. p. 1, "Among the many branches of modern mathematics set theory occupies a unique place: with a few rare exceptions the entities which are studied and analyzed in mathematics may be regarded as certain particular sets or classes of objects."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fields of mathematics==
{{see also|Areas of mathematics|Glossary of areas of mathematics}}
[[File:Abacus 6.png|right|thumb|An [[abacus]], a simple calculating tool used since ancient times]]
Mathematics can, broadly speaking, be subdivided into the study of quantity, structure, space, and change (i.e. [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]], [[geometry]], and [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]). In addition to these main concerns, there are also subdivisions dedicated to exploring links from the heart of mathematics to other fields: to [[mathematical logic|logic]], to [[set theory]] ([[foundations of mathematics|foundations]]), to the empirical mathematics of the various sciences ([[applied mathematics]]), and more recently to the rigorous study of [[uncertainty]]. While some areas might seem unrelated, the [[Langlands program]] has found connections between areas previously thought unconnected, such as [[Galois groups]], [[Riemann surface]]s and [[number theory]].

===Foundations and philosophy===
In order to clarify the [[foundations of mathematics]], the fields of [[mathematical logic]] and [[set theory]] were developed. Mathematical logic includes the mathematical study of [[logic]] and the applications of formal logic to other areas of mathematics; set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies [[set (mathematics)|sets]] or collections of objects. [[Category theory]], which deals in an abstract way with [[mathematical structure]]s and relationships between them, is still in development. The phrase "crisis of foundations" describes the search for a rigorous foundation for mathematics that took place from approximately 1900 to 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Luke Howard Hodgkin &amp; Luke Hodgkin, ''A History of Mathematics'', Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Some disagreement about the foundations of mathematics continues to the present day. The crisis of foundations was stimulated by a number of controversies at the time, including the [[controversy over Cantor's theory|controversy over Cantor's set theory]] and the [[Brouwer–Hilbert controversy]].

Mathematical logic is concerned with setting mathematics within a rigorous [[axiom]]atic framework, and studying the implications of such a framework. As such, it is home to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] which (informally) imply that any effective [[formal system]] that contains basic arithmetic, if ''sound'' (meaning that all theorems that can be proved are true), is necessarily ''incomplete'' (meaning that there are true theorems which cannot be proved ''in that system''). Whatever finite collection of number-theoretical axioms is taken as a foundation, Gödel showed how to construct a formal statement that is a true number-theoretical fact, but which does not follow from those axioms. Therefore, no formal system is a complete axiomatization of full number theory. Modern logic is divided into [[recursion theory]], [[model theory]], and [[proof theory]], and is closely linked to [[theoretical computer science]],{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} as well as to [[category theory]]. In the context of recursion theory, the impossibility of a full axiomatization of number theory can also be formally demonstrated as a [[MRDP theorem#Further applications|consequence of the MRDP theorem]].

[[Theoretical computer science]] includes [[computability theory (computation)|computability theory]], [[computational complexity theory]], and [[information theory]]. Computability theory examines the limitations of various theoretical models of the computer, including the most well-known model&amp;nbsp;– the [[Turing machine]]. Complexity theory is the study of tractability by computer; some problems, although theoretically solvable by computer, are so expensive in terms of time or space that solving them is likely to remain practically unfeasible, even with the rapid advancement of computer hardware. A famous problem is the "[[P = NP problem|{{nowrap|'''P''' {{=}} '''NP'''?}}]]" problem, one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5Qj76uCbF?url=http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/ Clay Mathematics Institute], P=NP, claymath.org&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, information theory is concerned with the amount of data that can be stored on a given medium, and hence deals with concepts such as [[data compression|compression]] and [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]].

===Pure mathematics===
====Quantity====
{{Main|Arithmetic}}
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]--&gt;
The study of quantity starts with numbers, first the familiar [[natural number]]s and [[integer]]s ("whole numbers") and arithmetical operations on them, which are characterized in [[arithmetic]]. The deeper properties of integers are studied in [[number theory]], from which come such popular results as [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]. The [[twin prime]] conjecture and [[Goldbach's conjecture]] are two unsolved problems in number theory.

As the number system is further developed, the integers are recognized as a [[subset]] of the [[rational number]]s ("[[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]]"). These, in turn, are contained within the [[real number]]s, which are used to represent [[Continuous function|continuous]] quantities. Real numbers are generalized to [[complex number]]s. These are the first steps of a hierarchy of numbers that goes on to include [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s. Consideration of the natural numbers also leads to the [[transfinite number]]s, which formalize the concept of "[[infinity]]". According to the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] all solutions of equations in one unknown with complex coefficients are complex numbers, regardless of degree. Another area of study is the size of sets, which is described with the [[cardinal number]]s. These include the [[aleph number]]s, which allow meaningful comparison of the size of infinitely large sets.

|-

|}

====Structure====
{{Main|Algebra}}
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]--&gt;
Many mathematical objects, such as [[set (mathematics)|sets]] of numbers and [[function (mathematics)|functions]], exhibit internal structure as a consequence of [[operation (mathematics)|operations]] or [[relation (mathematics)|relations]] that are defined on the set. Mathematics then studies properties of those sets that can be expressed in terms of that structure; for instance [[number theory]] studies properties of the set of [[integer]]s that can be expressed in terms of [[arithmetic]] operations. Moreover, it frequently happens that different such structured sets (or [[mathematical structure|structures]]) exhibit similar properties, which makes it possible, by a further step of [[abstraction]], to state [[axiom]]s for a class of structures, and then study at once the whole class of structures satisfying these axioms. Thus one can study [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]] and other abstract systems; together such studies (for structures defined by algebraic operations) constitute the domain of [[abstract algebra]].

By its great generality, abstract algebra can often be applied to seemingly unrelated problems; for instance a number of ancient problems concerning [[compass and straightedge constructions]] were finally solved using [[Galois theory]], which involves field theory and group theory. Another example of an algebraic theory is [[linear algebra]], which is the general study of [[vector space]]s, whose elements called [[vector (geometric)|vectors]] have both quantity and direction, and can be used to model (relations between) points in space. This is one example of the phenomenon that the originally unrelated areas of [[geometry]] and [[algebra]] have very strong interactions in modern mathematics. [[Combinatorics]] studies ways of enumerating the number of objects that fit a given structure.

|}

====Space====
{{Main|Geometry}}
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]--&gt;
The study of space originates with [[geometry]]&amp;nbsp;– in particular, [[Euclidean geometry]], which combines space and numbers, and encompasses the well-known [[Pythagorean theorem]]. [[Trigonometry]] is the branch of mathematics that deals with relationships between the sides and the angles of triangles and with the trigonometric functions. The modern study of space generalizes these ideas to include higher-dimensional geometry, [[non-Euclidean geometries]] (which play a central role in [[general relativity]]) and [[topology]]. Quantity and space both play a role in [[analytic geometry]], [[differential geometry]], and [[algebraic geometry]]. [[Convex geometry|Convex]] and [[discrete geometry]] were developed to solve problems in [[geometry of numbers|number theory]] and [[functional analysis]] but now are pursued with an eye on applications in [[convex optimization|optimization]] and [[computational geometry|computer science]]. Within differential geometry are the concepts of [[fiber bundles]] and calculus on [[manifold]]s, in particular, [[vector calculus|vector]] and [[tensor calculus]]. Within algebraic geometry is the description of geometric objects as solution sets of [[polynomial]] equations, combining the concepts of quantity and space, and also the study of [[topological groups]], which combine structure and space. [[Lie group]]s are used to study space, structure, and change. [[Topology]] in all its many ramifications may have been the greatest growth area in 20th-century mathematics; it includes [[point-set topology]], [[set-theoretic topology]], [[algebraic topology]] and [[differential topology]]. In particular, instances of modern-day topology are [[metrizability theory]], [[axiomatic set theory]], [[homotopy theory]], and [[Morse theory]]. Topology also includes the now solved [[Poincaré conjecture]], and the still unsolved areas of the [[Hodge conjecture]]. Other results in geometry and topology, including the [[four color theorem]] and [[Kepler conjecture]], have been proved only with the help of computers.

====Change====
{{Main|Calculus}}
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]--&gt;
Understanding and describing change is a common theme in the [[natural science]]s, and [[calculus]] was developed as a powerful tool to investigate it. [[Function (mathematics)|Functions]] arise here, as a central concept describing a changing quantity. The rigorous study of [[real number]]s and functions of a real variable is known as [[real analysis]], with [[complex analysis]] the equivalent field for the [[complex number]]s. [[Functional analysis]] focuses attention on (typically infinite-dimensional) [[Space#Mathematics|spaces]] of functions. One of many applications of functional analysis is [[quantum mechanics]]. Many problems lead naturally to relationships between a quantity and its rate of change, and these are studied as [[differential equation]]s. Many phenomena in nature can be described by [[dynamical system]]s; [[chaos theory]] makes precise the ways in which many of these systems exhibit unpredictable yet still [[deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]] behavior.

===Applied mathematics===
{{Main|Applied mathematics}}
[[Applied mathematics]] concerns itself with mathematical methods that are typically used in science, engineering, business, and industry. Thus, "applied mathematics" is a [[mathematical science]] with specialized knowledge. The term ''applied mathematics'' also describes the professional specialty in which mathematicians work on practical problems; as a profession focused on practical problems, ''applied mathematics'' focuses on the "formulation, study, and use of mathematical models" in science, engineering, and other areas of mathematical practice.

In the past, practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories, which then became the subject of study in pure mathematics, where mathematics is developed primarily for its own sake. Thus, the activity of applied mathematics is vitally connected with research in [[pure mathematics]].

====Statistics and other decision sciences====
{{Main|Statistics}}
Applied mathematics has significant overlap with the discipline of statistics, whose theory is formulated mathematically, especially with [[probability theory]]. Statisticians (working as part of a research project) "create data that makes sense" with [[random sampling]] and with randomized [[design of experiments|experiments]];&lt;ref&gt;[[C.R. Rao|Rao, C.R.]] (1997) ''Statistics and Truth: Putting Chance to Work'', World Scientific. {{isbn|981-02-3111-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the design of a statistical sample or experiment specifies the analysis of the data (before the data be available). When reconsidering data from experiments and samples or when analyzing data from [[observational study|observational studies]], statisticians "make sense of the data" using the art of [[statistical model|modelling]] and the theory of [[statistical inference|inference]]&amp;nbsp;– with [[model selection]] and [[estimation theory|estimation]]; the estimated models and consequential [[Scientific method#Predictions from the hypothesis|predictions]] should be [[statistical hypothesis testing|tested]] on [[Scientific method#Evaluation and improvement|new data]].{{efn|Like other mathematical sciences such as [[physics]] and [[computer science]], statistics is an autonomous discipline rather than a branch of applied mathematics. Like research physicists and computer scientists, research statisticians are mathematical scientists. Many statisticians have a degree in mathematics, and some statisticians are also mathematicians.}}

[[Statistical theory]] studies [[statistical decision theory|decision problems]] such as minimizing the [[risk]] ([[expected loss]]) of a statistical action, such as using a [[statistical method|procedure]] in, for example, [[parameter estimation]], [[hypothesis testing]], and [[selection algorithm|selecting the best]]. In these traditional areas of [[mathematical statistics]], a statistical-decision problem is formulated by minimizing an [[objective function]], like expected loss or [[cost]], under specific constraints: For example, designing a survey often involves minimizing the cost of estimating a population mean with a given level of confidence.&lt;ref name="RaoOpt"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Arthanari |editor1-first=T.S. |editor2-last=Dodge |editor2-first=Yadolah |editor2-link=Yadolah Dodge |last=Rao |first=C.R. |authorlink=C.R.

====Computational mathematics====
[[Computational mathematics]] proposes and studies methods for solving [[mathematical problem]]s that are typically too large for human numerical capacity. [[Numerical analysis]] studies methods for problems in [[analysis (mathematics)|analysis]] using [[functional analysis]] and [[approximation theory]]; numerical analysis includes the study of [[approximation]] and [[discretization]] broadly with special concern for [[rounding error]]s. Numerical analysis and, more broadly, scientific computing also study non-analytic topics of mathematical science, especially [[algorithm]]ic [[numerical linear algebra|matrix]] and [[graph theory]]. Other areas of computational mathematics include [[computer algebra]] and [[symbolic computation]].

==Mathematical awards==
Arguably the most prestigious award in mathematics is the [[Fields Medal]],{{sfn|Monastyrsky|2001|p=1|ps=: "The Fields Medal is now indisputably the best known and most influential award in mathematics."}}{{sfn|Riehm|2002|pp=778–82}} established in 1936 and awarded every four years (except around World War II) to as many as four individuals. The Fields Medal is often considered a mathematical equivalent to the Nobel Prize.

The [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]], instituted in 1978, recognizes lifetime achievement, and another major international award, the [[Abel Prize]], was instituted in 2003. The [[Chern Medal]] was introduced in 2010 to recognize lifetime achievement. These accolades are awarded in recognition of a particular body of work, which may be innovational, or provide a solution to an outstanding problem in an established field.

A famous list of 23 [[open problem]]s, called "[[Hilbert's problems]]", was compiled in 1900 by German mathematician [[David Hilbert]]. This list achieved great celebrity among mathematicians, and at least nine of the problems have now been solved. A new list of seven important problems, titled the "[[Millennium Prize Problems]]", was published in 2000. Only one of them, the [[Riemann hypothesis]], duplicates one of Hilbert's problems. A solution to any of these problems carries a $1&amp;nbsp;million reward.

The '''philosophy of mathematics''' is the [[Branch (academia)|branch]] of [[philosophy]] that studies the assumptions, foundations, and implications of [[mathematics]], and purports to provide a viewpoint of the nature and [[methodology]] of mathematics, and to understand the place of mathematics in people's lives. The logical and structural nature of mathematics itself makes this study both broad and unique among its philosophical counterparts.

==History==
The origin of mathematics is subject to argument. Whether the birth of mathematics was a random happening or induced by necessity duly contingent upon other subjects, say for example physics, is still a matter of prolific debates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is mathematics discovered or invented?|url=http://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/education/research/centres/stem/publications/pmej/pome12/article2.htm|website=University of Exeter|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Math: Discovered, Invented, or Both?|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/blogs/physics/2015/04/great-math-mystery/|website=pbs.org|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many thinkers have contributed their ideas concerning the nature of mathematics. Today, some{{Who|date=July 2012}} philosophers of mathematics aim to give accounts of this form of inquiry and its products as they stand, while others emphasize a role for themselves that goes beyond simple interpretation to critical analysis. There are traditions of mathematical philosophy in both [[History of Western philosophy|Western philosophy]] and [[Eastern philosophy]]. Western philosophies of mathematics go as far back as [[Pythagoras]], who described the theory "everything is mathematics" ([[mathematicism]]), [[Plato]], who paraphrased Pythagoras, and studied the [[ontology|ontological status]] of mathematical objects, and [[Aristotle]], who studied [[logic]] and issues related to [[infinity]] (actual versus potential).

[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosophy on mathematics was strongly influenced by their study of [[geometry]]. For example, at one time, the Greeks held the opinion that 1 (one) was not a [[number]], but rather a unit of arbitrary length. A number was defined as a multitude. Therefore, 3, for example, represented a certain multitude of units, and was thus not "truly" a number. At another point, a similar argument was made that 2 was not a number but a fundamental notion of a pair. These views come from the heavily geometric straight-edge-and-compass viewpoint of the Greeks: just as lines drawn in a geometric problem are measured in proportion to the first arbitrarily drawn line, so too are the numbers on a number line measured in proportion to the arbitrary first "number" or "one".{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

These earlier Greek ideas of numbers were later upended by the discovery of the [[irrational number|irrationality]] of the square root of two. [[Hippasus]], a disciple of [[Pythagoras]], showed that the diagonal of a unit square was incommensurable with its (unit-length) edge: in other words he proved there was no existing (rational) number that accurately depicts the proportion of the diagonal of the unit square to its edge. This caused a significant re-evaluation of Greek philosophy of mathematics. According to legend, fellow Pythagoreans were so traumatized by this discovery that they murdered Hippasus to stop him from spreading his heretical idea. [[Simon Stevin]] was one of the first in Europe to challenge Greek ideas in the 16th&amp;nbsp;century. Beginning with [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], the focus shifted strongly to the relationship between mathematics and logic. This perspective dominated the philosophy of mathematics through the time of [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]] and of [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], but was brought into question by developments in the late 19th and early 20th&amp;nbsp;centuries.

===Contemporary philosophy===
A perennial issue in the philosophy of mathematics concerns the relationship between logic and mathematics at their joint foundations. While 20th-century philosophers continued to ask the questions mentioned at  the outset of this article, the philosophy of mathematics in the 20th century was characterized by a predominant interest in [[formal logic]], [[set theory]], and foundational issues.

It is a profound puzzle that on the one hand mathematical truths seem to have a compelling inevitability, but on the other hand the source of their "truthfulness" remains elusive. Investigations into this issue are known as the [[foundations of mathematics]] program.

At the start of the 20th century, philosophers of mathematics were already beginning to divide into various schools of thought about all these questions, broadly distinguished by their pictures of mathematical [[epistemology]] and [[ontology]]. Three schools, [[formalism (mathematics)|formalism]], [[intuitionism]], and [[logicism]], emerged at this time, partly in response to the increasingly widespread worry that mathematics as it stood, and [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] in particular, did not live up to the standards of [[certainty]] and [[rigor]] that had been taken for granted. Each school addressed the issues that came to the fore at that time, either attempting to resolve them or claiming that mathematics is not entitled to its status as our most trusted knowledge.

Surprising and counter-intuitive developments in formal logic and set theory early in the 20th&amp;nbsp;century led to new questions concerning what was traditionally called the ''foundations of mathematics''. As the century unfolded, the initial focus of concern expanded to an open exploration of the fundamental axioms of mathematics, the axiomatic approach having been taken for granted since the time of [[Euclid]] around 300&amp;nbsp;BCE as the natural basis for mathematics. Notions of [[axiom]], [[proposition]] and [[mathematical proof|proof]], as well as the notion of a proposition being true of a mathematical object (see [[Assignment (mathematical logic)]]), were formalized, allowing them to be treated mathematically. The [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|Zermelo–Fraenkel]] axioms for set theory were formulated which provided a conceptual framework in which much mathematical discourse would be interpreted. In mathematics, as in physics, new and unexpected ideas had arisen and significant changes were coming. With [[Gödel numbering]], propositions could be interpreted as referring to themselves or other propositions, enabling inquiry into the [[consistency proof|consistency]] of mathematical theories. This reflective critique in which the theory under review "becomes itself the object of a mathematical study" led [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] to call such study ''[[metamathematics]]'' or ''[[proof theory]]''.&lt;ref name="Kleene 1971"&gt;{{cite book

At the middle of the century, a new mathematical theory was created by [[Samuel Eilenberg]] and [[Saunders Mac Lane]], known as [[category theory]], and it became a new contender for the natural language of mathematical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Saunders Mac Lane|Mac Lane, Saunders]] (1998), ''[[Categories for the Working Mathematician]]'', 2nd edition, Springer-Verlag, New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; As the 20th&amp;nbsp;century progressed, however, philosophical opinions diverged as to just how well-founded were the questions about foundations that were raised at the century's beginning. [[Hilary Putnam]] summed up one common view of the situation in the last third of the century by saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When philosophy discovers something wrong with science, sometimes science has to be changed—[[Russell's paradox]] comes to mind, as does [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]]'s attack on the actual [[infinitesimal]]—but more often it is philosophy that has to be changed. I do not think that the difficulties that philosophy finds with classical mathematics today are genuine difficulties; and I think that the philosophical interpretations of mathematics that we are being offered on every hand are wrong, and that "philosophical interpretation" is just what mathematics doesn't need.&lt;ref&gt;*Putnam, Hilary (1967), "Mathematics Without Foundations", ''Journal of Philosophy'' 64/1, 5-22. Reprinted, pp.&amp;nbsp;168–184 in W.D. Hart (ed., 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|169–170}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Philosophy of mathematics today proceeds along several different lines of inquiry, by philosophers of mathematics, logicians, and mathematicians, and there are many schools of thought on the subject. The schools are addressed separately in the next section, and their assumptions explained.

==Major themes==
===Mathematical realism&lt;!--'Mathematical realism' redirects here--&gt;===
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2007}}
'''Mathematical realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, like [[Metaphysical realism|realism]] in general, holds that mathematical entities exist independently of the human [[mind]]. Thus humans do not invent mathematics, but rather discover it, and any other intelligent beings in the universe would presumably do the same. In this point of view, there is really one sort of mathematics that can be discovered; [[triangle]]s, for example, are real entities, not the creations of the human mind.

Many working mathematicians have been mathematical realists; they see themselves as discoverers of naturally occurring objects. Examples include [[Paul Erdős]] and [[Kurt Gödel]]. Gödel believed in an objective mathematical reality that could be perceived in a manner analogous to sense perception. Certain principles (e.g., for any two objects, there is a collection of objects consisting of precisely those two objects) could be directly seen to be true, but the [[continuum hypothesis]] conjecture might prove undecidable just on the basis of such principles. Gödel suggested that quasi-empirical methodology could be used to provide sufficient evidence to be able to reasonably assume such a conjecture.

Within realism, there are distinctions depending on what sort of existence one takes mathematical entities to have, and how we know about them. Major forms of mathematical realism include [[Philosophy of mathematics#Platonism|Platonism]].

===Mathematical anti-realism&lt;!--'Mathematical anti-realism' redirects here--&gt;===
{{also|Post rem structuralism}}
'''Mathematical anti-realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; generally holds that mathematical statements have truth-values, but that they do not do so by [[correspondence theory of truth|corresponding]] to a special realm of immaterial or non-empirical entities. Major forms of mathematical anti-realism include [[Philosophy of mathematics#Formalism|formalism]] and [[Philosophy of mathematics#Fictionalism|fictionalism]].

==Contemporary schools of thought==
===Platonism&lt;!--'Mathematical Platonism', 'Full-blooded Platonism', 'Set-theoretic realism', 'set-theoretic Platonism', 'naturalized Platonism', and 'Platonized naturalism' redirect here--&gt;===
{{main|Platonism}}
{{also|Modern Platonism}}
'''Mathematical Platonism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is the form of realism that suggests that mathematical entities are abstract, have no spatiotemporal or causal properties, and are eternal and unchanging. This is often claimed to be the view most people have of numbers. The term ''Platonism'' is used because such a view is seen to parallel [[Plato]]'s [[Theory of Forms]] and a "World of Ideas" (Greek: ''eidos'' (εἶδος)) described in Plato's [[allegory of the cave]]: the everyday world can only imperfectly approximate an unchanging, ultimate reality. Both Plato's cave and Platonism have meaningful, not just superficial connections, because Plato's ideas were preceded and probably influenced by the hugely popular ''[[Pythagoreans]]'' of ancient Greece, who believed that the world was, quite literally, generated by [[number]]s.

A major question considered in mathematical Platonism is: Precisely where and how do the mathematical entities exist, and how do we know about them? Is there a world, completely separate from our physical one, that is occupied by the mathematical entities? How can we gain access to this separate world and discover truths about the entities? One proposed answer is the [[Ultimate Ensemble]], a theory that postulates that all structures that exist mathematically also exist physically in their own universe.

[[Kurt Gödel]]'s Platonism&lt;ref name=SEP-P&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism/ Platonism in Metaphysics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; postulates a special kind of mathematical intuition that lets us perceive mathematical objects directly. (This view bears resemblances to many things [[Husserl]] said about mathematics, and supports [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s idea that mathematics is [[Analytic-synthetic distinction#Conceptual containment|synthetic]] ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''.) [[Philip J. Davis|Davis]] and [[Reuben Hersh|Hersh]] have suggested in their 1999 book ''The Mathematical Experience'' that most mathematicians act as though they are Platonists, even though, if pressed to defend the position carefully, they may retreat to [[Philosophy of mathematics#Formalism|formalism]].

'''Full-blooded Platonism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is a modern variation of Platonism, which is in reaction to the fact that different sets of mathematical entities can be proven to exist depending on the axioms and inference rules employed (for instance, the law of the [[excluded middle]], and the [[axiom of choice]]). It holds that all mathematical entities exist, however they may be provable, even if they cannot all be derived from a single consistent set of axioms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism-mathematics/ "Platonism in the Philosophy of Mathematics", (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Set-theoretic realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (also '''set-theoretic Platonism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;[[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]] (ed.), ''Companion Encyclopedia of the History and Philosophy of the Mathematical Sciences'', Routledge, 2002, p. 681.&lt;/ref&gt; a position defended by [[Penelope Maddy]], is the view that [[set theory]] is about a single universe of sets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism-mathematics/ Naturalism in the Philosophy of Mathematics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; This position (which is also known as '''naturalized Platonism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; because it is a [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalized]] version of mathematical Platonism) has been criticized by Mark Balaguer on the basis of [[Paul Benacerraf]]'s [[Benacerraf's epistemological problem|epistemological problem]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Balaguer, "Against (Maddian) naturalized Platonism", ''Philosophia Mathematica'' 2 (1994), 97–108.&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar view, termed '''Platonized naturalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, was later defended by the [[Stanford–Edmonton School]]: according to this view, a more traditional kind of Platonism is consistent with [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]; the more traditional kind of Platonism they defend is distinguished by general principles that assert the existence of [[Abstract object theory|abstract object]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Linsky, B., and [[Edward N. Zalta|Zalta, E.]], 1995, "Naturalized Platonism vs. Platonized Naturalism", ''The Journal of Philosophy'', '''92'''(10): 525–555.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mathematicism===
{{main|Mathematicism}}
[[Max Tegmark]]'s [[mathematical universe hypothesis]] (or [[mathematicism]]) goes further than Platonism in asserting that not only do all mathematical objects exist, but nothing else does. Tegmark's sole postulate is: ''All structures that exist mathematically also exist physically''. That is, in the sense that "in those [worlds] complex enough to contain self-aware substructures [they] will subjectively perceive themselves as existing in a physically 'real' world".&lt;ref name="Tegmark2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tegmark |first=Max |date=February 2008 |title=The Mathematical Universe |journal=Foundations of Physics |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=101–150 |doi=10.1007/s10701-007-9186-9 |arxiv=0704.0646 |bibcode=2008FoPh...38..101T}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tegmark (1998), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logicism===
{{main|Logicism}}
[[Logicism]] is the thesis that mathematics is reducible to logic, and hence nothing but a part of logic.&lt;ref name=Carnap&gt;[[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap, Rudolf]] (1931), "Die logizistische Grundlegung der Mathematik", ''Erkenntnis'' 2, 91-121. Republished, "The Logicist Foundations of Mathematics", E. Putnam and G.J. Massey (trans.), in Benacerraf and Putnam (1964). Reprinted, pp.&amp;nbsp;41–52 in Benacerraf and Putnam (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|41}} Logicists hold that mathematics can be known ''a priori'', but suggest that our knowledge of mathematics is just part of our knowledge of logic in general, and is thus [[analytic proposition|analytic]], not requiring any special faculty of mathematical intuition. In this view, [[logic]] is the proper foundation of mathematics, and all mathematical statements are necessary [[logical truth]]s.

[[Rudolf Carnap]] (1931) presents the logicist thesis in two parts:&lt;ref name=Carnap/&gt;
#The ''concepts'' of mathematics can be derived from logical concepts through explicit definitions.
#The ''theorems'' of mathematics can be derived from logical axioms through purely logical deduction.

Gottlob Frege was the founder of logicism. In his seminal ''Die Grundgesetze der Arithmetik'' (''Basic Laws of Arithmetic'') he built up [[arithmetic]] from a system of logic with a general principle of comprehension, which he called "Basic Law V" (for concepts ''F'' and ''G'', the extension of ''F'' equals the extension of ''G'' if and only if for all objects ''a'', ''Fa'' equals ''Ga''), a principle that he took to be acceptable as part of logic.

Frege's construction was flawed. Russell discovered that Basic Law V is inconsistent (this is [[Russell's paradox]]). Frege abandoned his logicist program soon after this, but it was continued by Russell and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]]. They attributed the paradox to "vicious circularity" and built up what they called [[ramified type theory]] to deal with it. In this system, they were eventually able to build up much of modern mathematics but in an altered, and excessively complex form (for example, there were different natural numbers in each type, and there were infinitely many types). They also had to make several compromises in order to develop so much of mathematics, such as an "[[axiom of reducibility]]". Even Russell said that this axiom did not really belong to logic.

Modern logicists (like [[Bob Hale (philosopher)|Bob Hale]], [[Crispin Wright]], and perhaps others) have returned to a program closer to Frege's. They have abandoned Basic Law V in favor of abstraction principles such as [[Hume's principle]] (the number of objects falling under the concept ''F'' equals the number of objects falling under the concept ''G'' if and only if the extension of ''F'' and the extension of ''G'' can be put into [[bijection|one-to-one correspondence]]). Frege required Basic Law V to be able to give an explicit definition of the numbers, but all the properties of numbers can be derived from Hume's principle. This would not have been enough for Frege because (to paraphrase him) it does not exclude the possibility that the number 3 is in fact Julius Caesar. In addition, many of the weakened principles that they have had to adopt to replace Basic Law V no longer seem so obviously analytic, and thus purely logical.

===Formalism===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
{{Main article|Formalism (philosophy of mathematics)}}
Formalism holds that mathematical statements may be thought of as statements about the consequences of certain string manipulation rules. For example, in the "game" of [[Euclidean geometry]] (which is seen as consisting of some strings called "axioms", and some "rules of inference" to generate new strings from given ones), one can prove that the [[Pythagorean theorem]] holds (that is, one can generate the string corresponding to the Pythagorean theorem). According to formalism, mathematical truths are not about numbers and sets and triangles and the like—in fact, they are not "about" anything at all.

Another version of formalism is often known as [[deductivism]]. In deductivism, the Pythagorean theorem is not an absolute truth, but a relative one: ''if'' one assigns meaning to the strings in such a way that the rules of the game become true (i.e., true statements are assigned to the axioms and the rules of inference are truth-preserving), ''then'' one must accept the theorem, or, rather, the interpretation one has given it must be a true statement. The same is held to be true for all other mathematical statements. Thus, formalism need not mean that mathematics is nothing more than a meaningless symbolic game. It is usually hoped that there exists some interpretation in which the rules of the game hold. (Compare this position to [[structuralism (philosophy of mathematics)|structuralism]].) But it does allow the working mathematician to continue in his or her work and leave such problems to the philosopher or scientist. Many formalists would say that in practice, the axiom systems to be studied will be suggested by the demands of science or other areas of mathematics.

[[File:Hilbert.jpg|thumb|[[David Hilbert]]]]
A major early proponent of formalism was [[David Hilbert]], whose [[Hilbert's program|program]] was intended to be a [[Gödel's completeness theorem|complete]] and [[consistency proof|consistent]] axiomatization of all of mathematics. Hilbert aimed to show the consistency of mathematical systems from the assumption that the "finitary arithmetic" (a subsystem of the usual [[arithmetic]] of the positive [[integers]], chosen to be philosophically uncontroversial) was consistent. Hilbert's goals of creating a system of mathematics that is both complete and consistent were seriously undermined by the second of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]]s, which states that sufficiently expressive consistent axiom systems can never prove their own consistency. Since any such axiom system would contain the finitary arithmetic as a subsystem, Gödel's theorem implied that it would be impossible to prove the system's consistency relative to that (since it would then prove its own consistency, which Gödel had shown was impossible). Thus, in order to show that any axiomatic system of mathematics is in fact consistent, one needs to first assume the consistency of a system of mathematics that is in a sense stronger than the system to be proven consistent.

Hilbert was initially a deductivist, but, as may be clear from above, he considered certain metamathematical methods to yield intrinsically meaningful results and was a realist with respect to the finitary arithmetic. Later, he held the opinion that there was no other meaningful mathematics whatsoever, regardless of interpretation.

Other formalists, such as [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Alfred Tarski]], and [[Haskell Curry]], considered mathematics to be the investigation of [[formal system|formal axiom systems]]. [[Mathematical logic]]ians study formal systems but are just as often realists as they are formalists.

Formalists are relatively tolerant and inviting to new approaches to logic, non-standard number systems, new set theories etc. The more games we study, the better. However, in all three of these examples, motivation is drawn from existing mathematical or philosophical concerns. The "games" are usually not arbitrary.

The main critique of formalism is that the actual mathematical ideas that occupy mathematicians are far removed from the string manipulation games mentioned above. Formalism is thus silent on the question of which axiom systems ought to be studied, as none is more meaningful than another from a formalistic point of view.

Recently, some{{Who|date=July 2012}} formalist mathematicians have proposed that all of our ''formal'' mathematical knowledge should be systematically encoded in [[machine-readable medium|computer-readable]] formats, so as to facilitate [[proof checking|automated proof checking]] of mathematical proofs and the use of [[proof assistant|interactive theorem proving]] in the development of mathematical theories and computer software. Because of their close connection with [[computer science]], this idea is also advocated by mathematical intuitionists and constructivists in the "computability" tradition—see [[QED project]] for a general overview.

===Conventionalism===
{{main|Conventionalism|Preintuitionism}}
The French [[mathematician]] [[Henri Poincaré]] was among the first to articulate a [[conventionalist]] view. Poincaré's use of [[non-Euclidean geometries]] in his work on differential equations convinced him that [[Euclidean geometry]] should not be regarded as ''a priori'' truth. He held that [[axioms]] in geometry should be chosen for the results they produce, not for their apparent coherence with human intuitions about the physical world.

===Intuitionism===
{{Main article|Mathematical intuitionism}}
In mathematics, intuitionism is a program of methodological reform whose motto is that "there are no non-experienced mathematical truths" ([[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|L.E.J. Brouwer]]). From this springboard, intuitionists seek to reconstruct what they consider to be the corrigible portion of mathematics in accordance with Kantian concepts of being, becoming, intuition, and knowledge. Brouwer, the founder of the movement, held that mathematical objects arise from the ''a priori'' forms of the volitions that inform the perception of empirical objects.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Audi|Audi, Robert]] (1999), ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 1995. 2nd edition. Page 542.&lt;/ref&gt;

A major force behind intuitionism was [[L.E.J. Brouwer]], who rejected the usefulness of formalized logic of any sort for mathematics. His student [[Arend Heyting]] postulated an [[intuitionistic logic]], different from the classical [[Aristotelian logic]]; this logic does not contain the [[law of the excluded middle]] and therefore frowns upon [[Reductio ad absurdum|proofs by contradiction]]. The [[axiom of choice]] is also rejected in most intuitionistic set theories, though in some versions it is accepted. Important work was later done by [[Errett Bishop]], who managed to prove versions of the most important theorems in [[real analysis]] within this framework.

In intuitionism, the term "explicit construction" is not cleanly defined, and that has led to criticisms. Attempts have been made to use the concepts of [[Turing machine]] or [[computable function]] to fill this gap, leading to the claim that only questions regarding the behavior of finite [[algorithm]]s are meaningful and should be investigated in mathematics. This has led to the study of the [[computable number]]s, first introduced by [[Alan Turing]]. Not surprisingly, then, this approach to mathematics is sometimes associated with theoretical [[computer science]].

====Constructivism====
{{Main article|Constructivism (philosophy of mathematics)}}
Like intuitionism, constructivism involves the regulative principle that only mathematical entities which can be explicitly constructed in a certain sense should be admitted to mathematical discourse. In this view, mathematics is an exercise of the human intuition, not a game played with meaningless symbols. Instead, it is about entities that we can create directly through mental activity. In addition, some adherents of these schools reject non-constructive proofs, such as a proof by contradiction.

====Finitism====
{{main|Finitism}}
[[Finitism]] is an extreme form of [[mathematical constructivism|constructivism]], according to which a mathematical object does not exist unless it can be constructed from [[natural number]]s in a [[finite set|finite]] number of steps. In her book ''Philosophy of Set Theory'', [[Mary Tiles]] characterized those who allow [[countably infinite]] objects as classical finitists, and those who deny even countably infinite objects as strict finitists.

The most famous proponent of finitism was [[Leopold Kronecker]],&lt;ref&gt;From an 1886 lecture at the 'Berliner Naturforscher-Versammlung', according to [[H. M. Weber]]'s memorial article, as quoted and translated in {{cite web
|url=http://www.cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/2000-February/003820.html
|title=FOM: What were Kronecker's f.o.m.?
|accessdate=2008-07-19
|author=Gonzalez Cabillon, Julio
|date=2000-02-03}}
Gonzalez gives as the sources for the memorial article, the following: Weber, H: "Leopold Kronecker", ''Jahresberichte der Deutschen Mathematiker Vereinigung'', vol ii (1893), pp. 5-31. Cf. page 19. See also ''Mathematische Annalen'' vol. xliii (1893), pp. 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt; who said:
{{quote|God created the natural numbers, all else is the work of man.}}

[[Ultrafinitism]] is an even more extreme version of finitism, which rejects not only infinities but finite quantities that cannot feasibly be constructed with available resources. Another variant of finitism is Euclidean arithmetic, a system developed by [[John Penn Mayberry]] in his book ''The Foundations of Mathematics in the Theory of Sets''.&lt;ref name="Mayberry 2001"&gt;{{cite book |first=J.P. |last=Mayberry |authorlink=John Penn Mayberry |title=The Foundations of Mathematics in the Theory of Sets |year=2001 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayberry's system is Aristotelian in general inspiration and, despite his strong rejection of any role for operationalism or feasibility in the foundations of mathematics, comes to somewhat similar conclusions, such as, for instance, that super-exponentiation is not a legitimate finitary function.

===Structuralism===
{{Main article|Mathematical structuralism}}
[[Mathematical structuralism|Structuralism]] is a position holding that mathematical theories describe structures, and that mathematical objects are exhaustively defined by their ''places'' in such structures, consequently having no [[intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)|intrinsic properties]]. For instance, it would maintain that all that needs to be known about the number 1 is that it is the first whole number after 0. Likewise all the other whole numbers are defined by their places in a structure, the [[number line]]. Other examples of mathematical objects might include [[line (geometry)|lines]] and [[plane (geometry)|planes]] in geometry, or elements and operations in [[abstract algebra]].

Structuralism is an [[epistemologically]] [[realism (philosophy)|realistic]] view in that it holds that mathematical statements have an objective truth value. However, its central claim only relates to what ''kind'' of entity a mathematical object is, not to what kind of ''existence'' mathematical objects or structures have (not, in other words, to their [[ontology]]). The kind of existence mathematical objects have would clearly be dependent on that of the structures in which they are embedded; different sub-varieties of structuralism make different ontological claims in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=James |title=Philosophy of Mathematics |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-415-96047-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''ante rem'' structuralism ("before the thing") has a similar ontology to [[Mathematical Platonism|Platonism]].  Structures are held to have a real but abstract and immaterial existence. As such, it faces the standard epistemological problem of explaining the interaction between such abstract structures and flesh-and-blood mathematicians (see [[Benacerraf's identification problem]]).

The ''in re'' structuralism ("in the thing") is the equivalent of [[Philosophy of mathematics#Aristotelian realism|Aristotelean realism]]. Structures are held to exist inasmuch as some concrete system exemplifies them. This incurs the usual issues that some perfectly legitimate structures might accidentally happen not to exist, and that a finite physical world might not be "big" enough to accommodate some otherwise legitimate structures.

The ''post rem'' structuralism ("after the thing") is [[anti-realism|anti-realist]] about structures in a way that parallels [[nominalism]]. Like nominalism, the ''post rem'' approach denies the existence of abstract mathematical objects with properties other than their place in a relational structure.  According to this view mathematical ''systems'' exist, and have structural features in common. If something is true of a structure, it will be true of all systems exemplifying the structure. However, it is merely instrumental to talk of structures being "held in common" between systems: they in fact have no independent existence.

===Embodied mind theories===
[[Embodied mind]] theories hold that mathematical thought is a natural outgrowth of the human cognitive apparatus which finds itself in our physical universe. For example, the abstract concept of [[number]] springs from the experience of counting discrete objects. It is held that mathematics is not universal and does not exist in any real sense, other than in human brains. Humans construct, but do not discover, mathematics.

With this view, the physical universe can thus be seen as the ultimate foundation of mathematics: it guided the evolution of the brain and later determined which questions this brain would find worthy of investigation. However, the human mind has no special claim on reality or approaches to it built out of math. If such constructs as [[Euler's identity]] are true then they are true as a map of the human mind and [[cognition]].

Embodied mind theorists thus explain the effectiveness of mathematics—mathematics was constructed by the brain in order to be effective in this universe.

The most accessible, famous, and infamous treatment of this perspective is ''[[Where Mathematics Comes From]]'', by [[George Lakoff]] and [[Rafael E. Núñez]]. In addition, mathematician [[Keith Devlin]] has investigated similar concepts with his book ''[[The Math Instinct]]'', as has neuroscientist [[Stanislas Dehaene]] with his book ''The Number Sense''. For more on the philosophical ideas that inspired this perspective, see [[cognitive science of mathematics]].

====Aristotelian realism&lt;!--linked from 'Structuralism (philosophy of mathematics)'--&gt;====
{{main article|Aristotle's theory of universals}}
{{also|In re structuralism|Immanent realism}}
Aristotelian realism holds that mathematics studies properties such as symmetry, continuity and order that can be literally realized in the physical world (or in any other world there might be). It contrasts with Platonism in holding that the objects of mathematics, such as numbers, do not exist in an "abstract" world but can be physically realized. For example, the number 4 is realized in the relation between a heap of parrots and the universal "being a parrot" that divides the heap into so many parrots.&lt;ref name=Franklin&gt;Franklin, James (2014), "[http://us.macmillan.com/anaristotelianrealistphilosophyofmathematics/JamesFranklin An Aristotelian Realist Philosophy of Mathematics]", Palgrave Macmillan, Basingstoke; Franklin, James (2011), "[http://www.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/studianeoaristotelica.pdf Aristotelianism in the philosophy of mathematics]," ''Studia Neoaristotelica'' 8, 3-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotelian realism is defended by [[James Franklin (philosopher)|James Franklin]] and the [http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/structmath.html Sydney School] in the philosophy of mathematics and is close to the view of [[Penelope Maddy]] that when an egg carton is opened, a set of three eggs is perceived (that is, a mathematical entity realized in the physical world).&lt;ref name=Maddy&gt;[[Penelope Maddy|Maddy, Penelope]] (1990), ''Realism in Mathematics'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; A problem for Aristotelian realism is what account to give of higher infinities, which may not be realizable in the physical world.

The Euclidean arithmetic developed by [[John Penn Mayberry]] in his book ''The Foundations of Mathematics in the Theory of Sets''.&lt;ref name="Mayberry 2001"/&gt; also falls into the Aristotelian realist tradition. Mayberry, following Euclid, considers numbers to be simply "definite multitudes of units" realized in nature—such as "the members of the London Symphony Orchestra" or "the trees in Birnam wood". Whether or not there are definite multitudes of units for which Euclid's Common Notion 5 (the Whole is greater than the Part) fails and which would consequently be reckoned as infinite is for Mayberry essentially a question about Nature and does not entail any transcendental suppositions.

====Psychologism====
{{main|Psychologism}}
{{also|Anti-psychologism}}

[[Psychologism]] in the philosophy of mathematics is the position that [[mathematical]] [[concept]]s and/or truths are grounded in, derived from or explained by psychological facts (or laws).

[[John Stuart Mill]] seems to have been an advocate of a type of logical psychologism, as were many 19th-century German logicians such as [[Christoph von Sigwart|Sigwart]] and [[Johann Eduard Erdmann|Erdmann]] as well as a number of [[psychologists]], past and present: for example, [[Gustave Le Bon]]. Psychologism was famously criticized by [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]] in his ''The Foundations of Arithmetic'', and many of his works and essays, including his review of [[Husserl]]'s ''[[Philosophy of Arithmetic]]''. Edmund Husserl, in the first volume of his ''[[Logical Investigations (Husserl)|Logical Investigations]]'', called "The Prolegomena of Pure Logic", criticized psychologism thoroughly and sought to distance himself from it. The "Prolegomena" is considered a more concise, fair, and thorough refutation of psychologism than the criticisms made by Frege, and also it is considered today by many as being a memorable refutation for its decisive blow to psychologism. Psychologism was also criticized by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]].

====Empiricism====
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
{{main|Quasi-empiricism in mathematics}}
Mathematical empiricism is a form of realism that denies that mathematics can be known ''a priori'' at all. It says that we discover mathematical facts by [[empirical evidence|empirical research]], just like facts in any of the other sciences. It is not one of the classical three positions advocated in the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century, but primarily arose in the middle of the century. However, an important early proponent of a view like this was [[John Stuart Mill]]. Mill's view was widely criticized, because, according to critics, such as A.J. Ayer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ayer |first1=Alfred Jules |title=Language, Truth, &amp; Logic |date=1952 |publisher=Dover Publications, Inc. |location=New York |isbn=978-0-486-20010-1 |page=74 ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; it makes statements like {{nowrap|"2 + 2 {{=}} 4"}} come out as uncertain, contingent truths, which we can only learn by observing instances of two pairs coming together and forming a quartet.

Contemporary mathematical empiricism, formulated by [[W. V. O. Quine]] and [[Hilary Putnam]], is primarily supported by the [[#Indispensability argument for realism|indispensability argument]]: mathematics is indispensable to all empirical sciences, and if we want to believe in the reality of the phenomena described by the sciences, we ought also believe in the reality of those entities required for this description. That is, since physics needs to talk about [[electron]]s to say why light bulbs behave as they do, then electrons must [[existence|exist]]. Since physics needs to talk about numbers in offering any of its explanations, then numbers must exist. In keeping with Quine and Putnam's overall philosophies, this is a naturalistic argument. It argues for the existence of mathematical entities as the best explanation for experience, thus stripping mathematics of being distinct from the other sciences.

Putnam strongly rejected the term "[[Platonist]]" as implying an over-specific [[ontology]] that was not necessary to [[mathematical practice]] in any real sense. He advocated a form of "pure realism" that rejected mystical notions of [[truth]] and accepted much [[quasi-empiricism in mathematics]]. This grew from the increasingly popular assertion in the late 20th century that no one [[foundation of mathematics]] could be ever proven to exist. It is also sometimes called "postmodernism in mathematics" although that term is considered overloaded by some and insulting by others. Quasi-empiricism argues that in doing their research, mathematicians test hypotheses as well as prove theorems. A mathematical argument can transmit falsity from the conclusion to the premises just as well as it can transmit truth from the premises to the conclusion. Putnam has argued that any theory of mathematical realism would include quasi-empirical methods. He proposed that an alien species doing mathematics might well rely on quasi-empirical methods primarily, being willing often to forgo rigorous and axiomatic proofs, and still be doing mathematics—at perhaps a somewhat greater risk of failure of their calculations. He gave a detailed argument for this in ''New Directions''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Tymoczko|Tymoczko, Thomas]] (1998), ''New Directions in the Philosophy of Mathematics''. {{isbn|978-0691034980}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Quasi-empiricism was also developed by [[Imre Lakatos]].

The most important criticism of empirical views of mathematics is approximately the same as that raised against Mill. If mathematics is just as empirical as the other sciences, then this suggests that its results are just as fallible as theirs, and just as contingent. In Mill's case the [[empirical evidence|empirical justification]] comes directly, while in Quine's case it comes indirectly, through the coherence of our scientific theory as a whole, i.e. [[consilience]] after [[E.O. Wilson]]. Quine suggests that mathematics seems completely certain because the role it plays in our web of belief is extraordinarily central, and that it would be extremely difficult for us to revise it, though not impossible.

For a philosophy of mathematics that attempts to overcome some of the shortcomings of Quine and Gödel's approaches by taking aspects of each see [[Penelope Maddy]]'s ''Realism in Mathematics''. Another example of a realist theory is the [[Philosophy of mathematics#Embodied mind theories|embodied mind theory]]. 

For experimental evidence suggesting that human infants can do elementary arithmetic, see [[Brian Butterworth]].

===Fictionalism&lt;!--'Mathematical fictionalism' redirects here--&gt;===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
{{also|Fictionalism}}
'''Mathematical fictionalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; was brought to fame in 1980 when [[Hartry Field]] published ''Science Without Numbers'', which rejected and in fact reversed Quine's indispensability argument. Where Quine suggested that mathematics was indispensable for our best scientific theories, and therefore should be accepted as a body of truths talking about independently existing entities, Field suggested that mathematics was dispensable, and therefore should be considered as a body of falsehoods not talking about anything real. He did this by giving a complete axiomatization of [[Newtonian mechanics]] with no reference to numbers or functions at all. He started with the "betweenness" of [[Hilbert's axioms]] to characterize space without coordinatizing it, and then added extra relations between points to do the work formerly done by [[vector field]]s. Hilbert's geometry is mathematical, because it talks about abstract points, but in Field's theory, these points are the concrete points of physical space, so no special mathematical objects at all are needed.

Having shown how to do science without using numbers, Field proceeded to rehabilitate mathematics as a kind of [[useful fiction]]. He showed that mathematical physics is a [[conservative extension]] of his non-mathematical physics (that is, every physical fact provable in mathematical physics is already provable from Field's system), so that mathematics is a reliable process whose physical applications are all true, even though its own statements are false. Thus, when doing mathematics, we can see ourselves as telling a sort of story, talking as if numbers existed. For Field, a statement like {{nowrap|"2 + 2 {{=}} 4"}} is just as fictitious as "[[Sherlock Holmes]] lived at 221B Baker Street"—but both are true according to the relevant fictions.

By this account, there are no metaphysical or epistemological problems special to mathematics. The only worries left are the general worries about non-mathematical physics, and about [[fiction]] in general. Field's approach has been very influential, but is widely rejected. This is in part because of the requirement of strong fragments of [[second-order logic]] to carry out his reduction, and because the statement of conservativity seems to require [[quantification (logic)|quantification]] over abstract models or deductions.

===Social constructivism===
{{main|Social constructivism}}
[[Social constructivism]] see mathematics primarily as a [[social construct]], as a product of culture, subject to correction and change. Like the other sciences, mathematics is viewed as an empirical endeavor whose results are constantly evaluated and may be discarded. However, while on an empiricist view the evaluation is some sort of comparison with "reality", social constructivists emphasize that the direction of mathematical research is dictated by the fashions of the social group performing it or by the needs of the society financing it. However, although such external forces may change the direction of some mathematical research, there are strong internal constraints—the mathematical traditions, methods, problems, meanings and values into which mathematicians are enculturated—that work to conserve the historically-defined discipline.

This runs counter to the traditional beliefs of working mathematicians, that mathematics is somehow pure or objective. But social constructivists argue that mathematics is in fact grounded by much uncertainty: as [[mathematical practice]] evolves, the status of previous mathematics is cast into doubt, and is corrected to the degree it is required or desired by the current mathematical community. This can be seen in the development of analysis from reexamination of the calculus of Leibniz and Newton. They argue further that finished mathematics is often accorded too much status, and [[mathematical folklore|folk mathematics]] not enough, due to an overemphasis on axiomatic proof and peer review as practices. However, this might be seen as merely saying that rigorously proven results are overemphasized, and then "look how chaotic and uncertain the rest of it all is!"

The social nature of mathematics is highlighted in its [[subculture]]s. Major discoveries can be made in one branch of mathematics and be relevant to another, yet the relationship goes undiscovered for lack of social contact between mathematicians. Social constructivists argue each speciality forms its own [[epistemic community]] and often has great difficulty communicating, or motivating the investigation of [[unifying conjecture]]s that might relate different areas of mathematics. Social constructivists see the process of "doing mathematics" as actually creating the meaning, while social realists see a deficiency either of human capacity to abstractify, or of human's [[cognitive bias]], or of mathematicians' [[collective intelligence]] as preventing the comprehension of a real universe of mathematical objects. Social constructivists sometimes reject the search for foundations of mathematics as bound to fail, as pointless or even meaningless.

Contributions to this school have been made by [[Imre Lakatos]] and [[Thomas Tymoczko]], although it is not clear that either would endorse the title.{{Clarify|date=August 2010}} More recently [[Paul Ernest]] has explicitly formulated a social constructivist philosophy of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Paul |last=Ernest |url=http://www.people.ex.ac.uk/PErnest/pome12/article2.htm |title=Is Mathematics Discovered or Invented? |publisher=University of Exeter |date= |accessdate=2008-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some consider the work of [[Paul Erdős]] as a whole to have advanced this view (although he personally rejected it) because of his uniquely broad collaborations, which prompted others to see and study "mathematics as a social activity", e.g., via the [[Erdős number]]. [[Reuben Hersh]] has also promoted the social view of mathematics, calling it a "humanistic" approach,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |first=Reuben |last=Hersh |interviewer=John Brockman |url=http://edge.org/documents/archive/edge5.html |title=What Kind of a Thing is a Number? |publisher=Edge Foundation |date=February 10, 1997 |accessdate=2008-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to but not quite the same as that associated with Alvin White;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Humanism and Mathematics Education |work=Math Forum |url=http://mathforum.org/mathed/humanistic.math.html |publisher=Humanistic Mathematics Network Journal |date= |accessdate=2008-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of Hersh's co-authors, [[Philip J. Davis]], has expressed sympathy for the social view as well.

A criticism of this approach is that it is trivial, based on the trivial observation that mathematics is a human activity. To observe that rigorous proof comes only after unrigorous conjecture, experimentation and speculation is true, but it is trivial and no-one would deny this. So it's a bit of a stretch to characterize a philosophy of mathematics in this way, on something trivially true. The calculus of Leibniz and Newton was reexamined by mathematicians such as Weierstrass in order to rigorously prove the theorems thereof. There is nothing special or interesting about this, as it fits in with the more general trend of unrigorous ideas which are later made rigorous. There needs to be a clear distinction between the objects of study of mathematics and the study of the objects of study of mathematics. The former doesn't seem to change a great deal;{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} the latter is forever in flux. The latter is what the social theory is about, and the former is what Platonism ''et al.'' are about.

However, this criticism is rejected by supporters of the [[social constructivist]] perspective because it misses the point that the very objects of mathematics are social constructs. These objects, it asserts, are primarily [[semiotic]] objects existing in the sphere of human culture, sustained by social practices (after [[Wittgenstein]]) that utilize physically embodied signs and give rise to intrapersonal (mental) constructs. Social constructivists view the reification of the sphere of human culture into a [[Platonism|Platonic]] realm, or some other heaven-like domain of existence beyond the physical world, a long-standing [[category error]].

===Beyond the traditional schools===
====Unreasonable effectiveness====
Rather than focus on narrow debates about the true nature of mathematical [[truth]], or even on practices unique to mathematicians such as the [[mathematical proof|proof]], a growing movement from the 1960s to the 1990s began to question the idea of seeking foundations or finding any one right answer to why mathematics works. The starting point for this was [[Eugene Wigner]]'s famous 1960 paper ''[[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences]]'', in which he argued that the happy coincidence of mathematics and physics being so well matched seemed to be unreasonable and hard to explain.

====Popper's two senses&lt;!--Linked from 'Karl Popper'--&gt;====
Realist and constructivist theories are normally taken to be contraries. However, [[Karl Popper]]&lt;ref&gt;Popper, Karl Raimund (1946) Aristotelian Society Supplementary Volume XX.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that a number statement such as {{nowrap|"2 apples + 2 apples {{=}} 4 apples"}} can be taken in two senses. In one sense it is irrefutable and logically true. In the second sense it is factually true and falsifiable. Another way of putting this is to say that a single number statement can express two propositions: one of which can be explained on constructivist lines; the other on realist lines.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Frank Hutson (1996) "[[s:Arithmetic and Reality: A Development of Popper's Ideas|Arithmetic and Reality: A Development of Popper's Ideas]]". City University of Hong Kong. Republished in Philosophy of Mathematics Education Journal No. 26 (December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philosophy of language====
{{main article|Language of mathematics}}
Innovations in the philosophy of language during the 20th century renewed interest in whether mathematics is, as is often said, the ''language'' of science. Although some mathematicians and philosophers would accept the statement "[[mathematics as a language|mathematics is a language]]", linguists believe that the implications of such a statement must be considered. For example, the tools of [[linguistics]] are not generally applied to the symbol systems of mathematics, that is, mathematics is studied in a markedly different way from other languages. If mathematics is a language, it is a different type of language from [[natural languages]]. Indeed, because of the need for clarity and specificity, the language of mathematics is far more constrained than natural languages studied by linguists. However, the methods developed by Frege and Tarski for the study of mathematical language have been extended greatly by Tarski's student [[Richard Montague]] and other linguists working in [[formal semantics (linguistics)|formal semantics]] to show that the distinction between mathematical language and natural language may not be as great as it seems.

Mohan Ganesalingam has analysed mathematical language using tools from formal linguistics.&lt;ref name="ganesalingam"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ganesalingam |first1=Mohan |title=The Language of Mathematics: A Linguistic and Philosophical Investigation |date=2013 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-642-37011-3 |url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-37012-0 |accessdate=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ganesalingam notes that some features of natural language are not necessary when analysing mathematical language (such as [[grammatical tense|tense]]), but many of the same analytical tools can be used (such as [[context-free grammar]]s). One important difference is that mathematical objects have clearly defined [[type (mathematics)|types]], which can be explicitly defined in a text: "Effectively, we are allowed to introduce a word in one part of a sentence, and declare its [[part of speech]] in another; and this operation has no analogue in natural language."&lt;ref name="ganesalingam" /&gt;{{rp|251}}

==Arguments==
===Indispensability argument for realism&lt;!--linked from 'Hilary Putnam' and 'Willard Van Orman Quine'--&gt;===
This argument, associated with [[Willard Quine]] and [[Hilary Putnam]], is considered by [[Stephen Yablo]] to be one of the most challenging arguments in favor of the acceptance of the existence of abstract mathematical entities, such as numbers and sets.&lt;ref name="Ya"&gt;{{cite web |author=Yablo, S. |title=A Paradox of Existence |url=http://www.mit.edu/%7Eyablo/apex.html#fn1 |date=November 8, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form of the argument is as follows.
#One must have [[ontological]] commitments to ''all'' entities that are indispensable to the best scientific theories, and to those entities ''only'' (commonly referred to as "all and only").
#Mathematical entities are indispensable to the best scientific theories. Therefore,
#One must have ontological commitments to mathematical entities.&lt;ref name="MMM"&gt;Putnam, H. ''Mathematics, Matter and Method. Philosophical Papers, vol. 1''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1975. 2nd. ed., 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

The justification for the first premise is the most controversial. Both Putnam and Quine invoke [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] to justify the exclusion of all non-scientific entities, and hence to defend the "only" part of "all and only". The assertion that "all" entities postulated in scientific theories, including numbers, should be accepted as real is justified by [[confirmation holism]]. Since theories are not confirmed in a piecemeal fashion, but as a whole, there is no justification for excluding any of the entities referred to in well-confirmed theories. This puts the [[nominalism|nominalist]] who wishes to exclude the existence of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] and [[non-Euclidean geometry]], but to include the existence of [[quark]]s and other undetectable entities of physics, for example, in a difficult position.&lt;ref name="MMM"/&gt;

===Epistemic argument against realism===
The [[anti-realist]] "[[epistemic]] argument" against Platonism has been made by [[Paul Benacerraf]] and [[Hartry Field]]. Platonism posits that mathematical objects are ''[[abstract object|abstract]]'' entities. By general agreement, abstract entities cannot interact [[causal]]ly with concrete, physical entities ("the truth-values of our mathematical assertions depend on facts involving Platonic entities that reside in a realm outside of space-time"&lt;ref&gt;Field, Hartry, 1989, ''Realism, Mathematics, and Modality'', Oxford: Blackwell, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;). Whilst our knowledge of concrete, physical objects is based on our ability to [[perception|perceive]] them, and therefore to causally interact with them, there is no parallel account of how mathematicians come to have knowledge of abstract objects.&lt;ref&gt;"Since abstract objects are outside the nexus of causes and effects, and thus perceptually inaccessible, they cannot be known through their effects on us" — Katz, J. ''Realistic Rationalism'', 2000, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophynow.org/issue81/ ''Philosophy Now'': "Mathematical Knowledge: A dilemma"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207095054/http://philosophynow.org/issue81 |date=2011-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism-mathematics/#EpiAcc Standard Encyclopaedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; Another way of making the point is that if the Platonic world were to disappear, it would make no difference to the ability of mathematicians to generate [[mathematical proof|proofs]], etc., which is already fully accountable in terms of physical processes in their brains.

Field developed his views into [[Philosophy of mathematics#Fictionalism|fictionalism]]. Benacerraf also developed the philosophy of [[mathematical structuralism]], according to which there are no mathematical objects. Nonetheless, some versions of structuralism are compatible with some versions of realism.

The argument hinges on the idea that a satisfactory [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] account of thought processes in terms of brain processes can be given for mathematical reasoning along with everything else. One line of defense is to maintain that this is false, so that mathematical reasoning uses some special [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] that involves contact with the Platonic realm. A modern form of this argument is given by [[Sir Roger Penrose]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?TheEmperorsNewMind Review of [[The Emperor's New Mind]] ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another line of defense is to maintain that abstract objects are relevant to mathematical reasoning in a way that is non-causal, and not analogous to perception. This argument is developed by [[Jerrold Katz]] in his 2000 book ''[[Realistic rationalism|Realistic Rationalism]]''.

A more radical defense is denial of physical reality, i.e. the [[mathematical universe hypothesis]]. In that case, a mathematician's knowledge of mathematics is one mathematical object making contact with another.

==Aesthetics==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
Many practicing mathematicians have been drawn to their subject because of a sense of [[mathematical beauty|beauty]] they perceive in it. One sometimes hears the sentiment that mathematicians would like to leave philosophy to the philosophers and get back to mathematics—where, presumably, the beauty lies.

In his work on the [[divine proportion]], H.E. Huntley relates the feeling of reading and understanding someone else's proof of a theorem of mathematics to that of a viewer of a masterpiece of art—the reader of a proof has a similar sense of exhilaration at understanding as the original author of the proof, much as, he argues, the viewer of a masterpiece has a sense of exhilaration similar to the original painter or sculptor. Indeed, one can study mathematical and scientific writings as [[literature]].

[[Philip J. Davis]] and [[Reuben Hersh]] have commented that the sense of mathematical beauty is universal amongst practicing mathematicians. By way of example, they provide two proofs of the irrationality of [[square root of 2|{{math|{{sqrt|2}}|}}]]. The first is the traditional proof by [[contradiction]], ascribed to [[Euclid]]; the second is a more direct proof involving the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] that, they argue, gets to the heart of the issue. Davis and Hersh argue that mathematicians find the second proof more aesthetically appealing because it gets closer to the nature of the problem.

[[Paul Erdős]] was well known for his notion of a hypothetical "Book" containing the most elegant or beautiful mathematical proofs. There is not universal agreement that a result has one "most elegant" proof; [[Gregory Chaitin]] has argued against this idea.

Philosophers have sometimes criticized mathematicians' sense of beauty or elegance as being, at best, vaguely stated. By the same token, however, philosophers of mathematics have sought to characterize what makes one proof more desirable than another when both are logically sound.

Another aspect of aesthetics concerning mathematics is mathematicians' views towards the possible uses of mathematics for purposes deemed unethical or inappropriate. The best-known exposition of this view occurs in [[G.H. Hardy]]'s book ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]'', in which Hardy argues that pure mathematics is superior in beauty to [[applied mathematics]] precisely because it cannot be used for war and similar ends.

In [[mathematics]], a '''plane''' is a flat, two-[[dimension]]al [[surface (topology)|surface]] that extends infinitely far. A plane is the [[two-dimensional space|two-dimensional analogue]] of a [[point (geometry)|point]] (zero dimensions), a [[line (geometry)|line]] (one dimension) and [[three-dimensional space]]. Planes can arise as subspaces of some higher-dimensional space, as with a room's walls extended infinitely far, or they may enjoy an independent existence in their own right, as in the setting of [[Euclidean geometry]].

When working exclusively in two-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], the definite article is used, so, ''the'' plane refers to the whole space. Many fundamental tasks in mathematics, [[geometry]], [[trigonometry]], [[graph theory]], and [[graph of a function|graphing]] are performed in a two-dimensional space, or, in other words, in the plane.

==Euclidean geometry==
{{Main|Euclidean geometry}}

[[Euclid]] set forth the first great landmark of mathematical thought, an axiomatic treatment of geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eves|1963|loc= pg. 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He selected a small core of undefined terms (called ''common notions'') and postulates (or [[axiom]]s) which he then used to prove various geometrical statements. Although the plane in its modern sense is not directly given a definition anywhere in the ''Elements'', it may be thought of as part of the common notions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
|last= Joyce
|first= D. E.
|title= Euclid's Elements, Book I, Definition 7
|publisher= Clark University
|year= 1996
|url= http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookI/defI7.html
|accessdate= 8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Euclid never used numbers to measure length, angle, or area. In this way the Euclidean plane is not quite the same as the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] plane.
&lt;!--In higher-dimensional Euclidean space, a plane inside this space can be uniquely determined by any of the following sets of objects:

*three [[non-collinear points]] (i.e. not lying on the same [[line (mathematics)|line]])
*a line and a point not on the line
*two distinct intersecting lines --&gt;

[[File:Planes parallel.svg|thumb|right|150px|Three parallel planes.]]
&lt;!--In 3 dimensional Euclidean space, planes, like [[line (geometry)|line]]s, can be [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] or intersecting. Lines drawn on two parallel planes will either be parallel or [[skew lines|skew]] but will not intersect. Intersecting planes may be [[perpendicular]] or may form any number of other angles. In Euclidean spaces of more than 3 dimensions, it is possible to have two planes that intersect in a single point.--&gt;

A plane is a [[ruled surface]].

==Planes embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space==
This section is solely concerned with planes embedded in three dimensions: specifically, in [[Cartesian product|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]].

===Determination by contained points and lines===
In a Euclidean space of any number of dimensions, a plane is uniquely determined by any of the following:
*Three non-[[collinear]] points (points not on a single line).
*A line and a point not on that line.
*Two distinct but intersecting lines.
*Two [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] lines.

===Properties===
The following statements hold in three-dimensional Euclidean space but not in higher dimensions, though they have higher-dimensional analogues:

*Two distinct planes are either parallel or they intersect in a [[line (geometry)|line]].
*A line is either parallel to a plane, intersects it at a single point, or is contained in the plane.
*Two distinct lines [[perpendicular]] to the same plane must be parallel to each other.
*Two distinct planes perpendicular to the same line must be parallel to each other.

===Point-normal form and general form of the equation of a plane===
In a manner analogous to the way lines in a two-dimensional space are described using a point-slope form for their equations, planes in a three dimensional space have a natural description using a point in the plane and a vector orthogonal to it (the [[normal vector]]) to indicate its "inclination".

Specifically, let {{math|'''''r'''''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} be the position vector of some point {{math|1=''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, and let {{math|1='''''n''''' = (''a'', ''b'', ''c'')}} be a nonzero vector. The plane determined by the point {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the vector {{mvar|'''n'''}} consists of those points {{math|''P''}}, with position vector {{mvar|'''r'''}}, such that the vector drawn from {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} to {{math|''P''}} is perpendicular to {{mvar|'''n'''}}. Recalling that two vectors are perpendicular if and only if their dot product is zero, it follows that the desired plane can be described as the set of all points {{mvar|'''r'''}} such that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n} \cdot (\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_0)=0.&lt;/math&gt;
(The dot here means a [[dot product|dot (scalar) product]].)
Expanded this becomes
:&lt;math&gt; a (x-x_0)+ b(y-y_0)+ c(z-z_0)=0,&lt;/math&gt;
which is the ''point-normal'' form of the equation of a plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anton|1994|loc=p. 155}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is just a [[linear equation]]
:&lt;math&gt; ax + by + cz + d = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt; d = -(ax_0 + by_0 + cz_0).&lt;/math&gt;
Conversely, it is easily shown that if {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c''}} and {{math|''d''}} are constants and {{math|''a'', ''b''}}, and {{math|''c''}} are not all zero, then the graph of the equation
::&lt;math&gt; ax + by + cz + d = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
is a plane having the vector {{math|1='''''n''''' = (''a'', ''b'', ''c'')}} as a normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anton|1994|loc=p. 156}}&lt;/ref&gt; This familiar equation for a plane is called the ''general form'' of the equation of the plane.&lt;ref name=Weisstein2009&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus for example a [[regression equation]] of the form {{math|1=''y'' = ''d'' + ''ax'' + ''cz''}} (with {{math|1=''b'' = −1}}) establishes a best-fit plane in three-dimensional space when there are two explanatory variables.

===Describing a plane with a point and two vectors lying on it===
Alternatively, a plane may be described parametrically as the set of all points of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf r = \mathbf {r}_0 + s \mathbf{v} + t \mathbf{w},&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:PlaneR.jpg|thumb|Vector description of a plane]]
where ''s'' and ''t'' range over all real numbers, '''{{math|v}}''' and {{math|'''w'''}} are given [[linear independence|linearly independent]] [[vector (geometry)|vectors]] defining the plane, and {{math|'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the vector representing the position of an arbitrary (but fixed) point on the plane. The vectors '''{{math|v}}''' and {{math|'''w'''}} can be visualized as vectors starting at {{math|'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} and pointing in different directions along the plane. Note that '''{{math|v}}''' and {{math|'''w'''}} can be [[perpendicular]], but cannot be parallel.

===Describing a plane through three points===
Let {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;{{=}}(x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{=}}(x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, and {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{{=}}(x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, z&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}} be non-collinear points.

====Method 1====
The plane passing through {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be described as the set of all points (x,y,z) that satisfy the following [[determinant]] equations:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix}
x - x_1 &amp; y - y_1 &amp; z - z_1 \\
x_2 - x_1 &amp; y_2 - y_1&amp; z_2 - z_1 \\
x_3 - x_1 &amp; y_3 - y_1 &amp; z_3 - z_1
\end{vmatrix} =\begin{vmatrix}
x - x_1 &amp; y - y_1 &amp; z - z_1 \\
x - x_2 &amp; y - y_2 &amp; z - z_2 \\
x - x_3 &amp; y - y_3 &amp; z - z_3
\end{vmatrix} = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

====Method 2====
To describe the plane by an equation of the form &lt;math&gt; ax + by + cz + d = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, solve the following system of equations:
:&lt;math&gt;\, ax_1 + by_1 + cz_1 + d = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\, ax_2 + by_2 + cz_2 + d = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\, ax_3 + by_3 + cz_3 + d = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This system can be solved using [[Cramer's rule]] and basic matrix manipulations. Let
: &lt;math&gt;D = \begin{vmatrix}
x_1 &amp; y_1 &amp; z_1 \\
x_2 &amp; y_2 &amp; z_2 \\
x_3 &amp; y_3 &amp; z_3
\end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

If ''D'' is non-zero (so for planes not through the origin) the values for ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' can be calculated as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{-d}{D} \begin{vmatrix}
1 &amp; y_1 &amp; z_1 \\
1 &amp; y_2 &amp; z_2 \\
1 &amp; y_3 &amp; z_3
\end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b = \frac{-d}{D} \begin{vmatrix}
x_1 &amp; 1 &amp; z_1 \\
x_2 &amp; 1 &amp; z_2 \\
x_3 &amp; 1 &amp; z_3
\end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c = \frac{-d}{D} \begin{vmatrix}
x_1 &amp; y_1 &amp; 1 \\
x_2 &amp; y_2 &amp; 1 \\
x_3 &amp; y_3 &amp; 1
\end{vmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

These equations are parametric in ''d''. Setting ''d'' equal to any non-zero number and substituting it into these equations will yield one solution set.

====Method 3====
This plane can also be described by the "[[plane_(geometry)#Point-normal_form_and_general_form_of_the_equation_of_a_plane|point and a normal vector]]" prescription above. A suitable normal vector is given by the [[cross product]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf n = ( \mathbf p_2 - \mathbf p_1 ) \times ( \mathbf p_3 - \mathbf p_1 ), &lt;/math&gt;
and the point {{math|'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be taken to be any of the given points {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}},{{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} or {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}&lt;ref name=PaulsPlanes&gt;{{citation
|last= Dawkins
|first= Paul
|title= Calculus III
|chapter= Equations of Planes
|chapterurl= http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcIII/EqnsOfPlanes.aspx
}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or any other point in the plane).

===Distance from a point to a plane===
{{Main|Distance from a point to a plane}}
For a plane &lt;math&gt;\Pi : ax + by + cz + d = 0&lt;/math&gt; and a point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf p_1 = (x_1,y_1,z_1) &lt;/math&gt; not necessarily lying on the plane, the shortest distance from &lt;math&gt;\mathbf p_1&lt;/math&gt; to the plane is
:&lt;math&gt; D = \frac{\left | a x_1 + b y_1 + c z_1+d \right |}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}}. &lt;/math&gt;

It follows that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf p_1&lt;/math&gt; lies in the plane [[if and only if]] ''D=0''.

If &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}=1&lt;/math&gt; meaning that ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' are normalized&lt;ref&gt;To normalize arbitrary coefficients, divide each of ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' and ''d'' by &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}&lt;/math&gt; (which can not be 0). The "new" coefficients are now normalized and the following formula is valid for the "new" coefficients.&lt;/ref&gt; then the equation becomes
:&lt;math&gt; D = \ | a x_1 + b y_1 + c z_1+d |.&lt;/math&gt;

Another vector form for the equation of a plane, known as the [[Hesse normal form]] relies on the parameter ''D''. This form is:&lt;ref name=Weisstein2009/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{r} - D_0 = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt; is a unit normal vector to the plane, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; a position vector of a point of the plane and ''D''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; the distance of the plane from the origin.

The general formula for higher dimensions can be quickly arrived at using [[vector notation]]. Let the [[hyperplane]] have equation &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{n} \cdot (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_0) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, where the &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[normal vector]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_0 = (x_{10},x_{20},\dots,x_{N0})&lt;/math&gt; is a [[position vector]] to a point in the [[hyperplane]]. We desire the perpendicular distance to the point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_1 = (x_{11},x_{21},\dots,x_{N1})&lt;/math&gt;. The [[hyperplane]] may also be represented by the scalar equation &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^N a_i x_i = -a_0&lt;/math&gt;, for constants &lt;math&gt;\{a_i\}&lt;/math&gt;. Likewise, a corresponding &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt; may be represented as &lt;math&gt;(a_1,a_2, \dots, a_N)&lt;/math&gt;. We desire the [[scalar projection]] of the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_0&lt;/math&gt; in the direction of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt;. Noting that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{r}_0 = \mathbf{r}_0 \cdot \mathbf{n} = -a_0&lt;/math&gt; (as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_0&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the equation of the [[hyperplane]]) we have
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
D &amp;= \frac{|(\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_0) \cdot \mathbf{n}|}{|\mathbf{n}|} \\
&amp;= \frac{|\mathbf{r}_1\cdot \mathbf{n} - \mathbf{r}_0 \cdot \mathbf{n}|}{|\mathbf{n}|} \\
&amp;= \frac{|\mathbf{r}_1\cdot \mathbf{n} + a_0|}{|\mathbf{n}|} \\
&amp;= \frac{|a_1x_{11} + a_2x_{21} + \dots + a_Nx_{N1} + a_0|}{\sqrt{a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \dots + a_N^2}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;.

===Line of intersection between two planes===
The line of intersection between two planes &lt;math&gt;\Pi_1 : \mathbf {n}_1 \cdot \mathbf r = h_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi_2 : \mathbf {n}_2 \cdot \mathbf r = h_2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf {n}_i&lt;/math&gt; are normalized is given by
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf {r} = (c_1 \mathbf {n}_1 + c_2 \mathbf {n}_2) + \lambda (\mathbf {n}_1 \times \mathbf {n}_2) &lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt; c_1 = \frac{ h_1 - h_2(\mathbf {n}_1 \cdot \mathbf {n}_2) }{ 1 - (\mathbf {n}_1 \cdot \mathbf {n}_2)^2 } &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; c_2 = \frac{ h_2 - h_1(\mathbf {n}_1 \cdot \mathbf {n}_2) }{ 1 - (\mathbf {n}_1 \cdot \mathbf {n}_2)^2 }.&lt;/math&gt;

This is found by noticing that the line must be perpendicular to both plane normals, and so parallel to their cross product &lt;math&gt;\mathbf {n}_1 \times \mathbf {n}_2&lt;/math&gt; (this cross product is zero if and only if the planes are parallel, and are therefore non-intersecting or entirely coincident).

The remainder of the expression is arrived at by finding an arbitrary point on the line. To do so, consider that any point in space may be written as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r = c_1\mathbf {n}_1 + c_2\mathbf {n}_2 + \lambda(\mathbf {n}_1 \times \mathbf {n}_2)&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;\{ \mathbf {n}_1, \mathbf {n}_2, (\mathbf {n}_1 \times \mathbf {n}_2) \}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]]. We wish to find a point which is on both planes (i.e. on their intersection), so insert this equation into each of the equations of the planes to get two simultaneous equations which can be solved for &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt;.

If we further assume that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf {n}_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf {n}_2&lt;/math&gt; are [[orthonormal]] then the closest point on the line of intersection to the origin is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r_0 = h_1\mathbf {n}_1 + h_2\mathbf {n}_2&lt;/math&gt;. If that is not the case, then a more complex procedure must be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Plane-PlaneIntersection.html Plane-Plane Intersection - from Wolfram MathWorld]. Mathworld.wolfram.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dihedral angle===
{{See also|Dihedral angle}}
Given two intersecting planes described by &lt;math&gt;\Pi_1 : a_1 x + b_1 y + c_1 z + d_1 = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi_2 : a_2 x + b_2 y + c_2 z + d_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;, the [[dihedral angle]] between them is defined to be the angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; between their normal directions:
:&lt;math&gt;\cos\alpha = \frac{\hat n_1\cdot \hat n_2}{|\hat n_1||\hat n_2|} = \frac{a_1 a_2 + b_1 b_2 + c_1 c_2}{\sqrt{a_1^2+b_1^2+c_1^2}\sqrt{a_2^2+b_2^2+c_2^2}}. &lt;/math&gt;

==Planes in various areas of mathematics==
In addition to its familiar [[geometric]] structure, with [[isomorphism]]s that are [[isometry|isometries]] with respect to the usual inner product, the plane may be viewed at various other levels of [[abstraction (mathematics)|abstraction]]. Each level of abstraction corresponds to a specific [[category (mathematics)|category]].

At one extreme, all geometrical and [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] concepts may be dropped to leave the [[topological]] plane, which may be thought of as an idealized [[homotopy|homotopically]] trivial infinite rubber sheet, which retains a notion of proximity, but has no distances. The topological plane has a concept of a linear path, but no concept of a straight line. The topological plane, or its equivalent the open disc, is the basic topological neighborhood used to construct [[surface (topology)|surface]]s (or 2-manifolds) classified in [[low-dimensional topology]]. Isomorphisms of the topological plane are all [[continuous function|continuous]] [[bijection]]s. The topological plane is the natural context for the branch of [[graph theory]] that deals with [[planar graphs]], and results such as the [[four color theorem]].

The plane may also be viewed as an [[affine space]], whose isomorphisms are combinations of translations and non-singular linear maps. From this viewpoint there are no distances, but [[collinearity]] and ratios of distances on any line are preserved.

[[Differential geometry]] views a plane as a 2-dimensional real [[manifold]], a topological plane which is provided with a [[differential structure]]. Again in this case, there is no notion of distance, but there is now a concept of smoothness of maps, for example a [[differentiable function|differentiable]] or [[smooth function|smooth]] path (depending on the type of differential structure applied). The isomorphisms in this case are bijections with the chosen degree of differentiability.

In the opposite direction of abstraction, we may apply a compatible field structure to the geometric plane, giving rise to the [[complex plane]] and the major area of [[complex analysis]]. The complex field has only two isomorphisms that leave the real line fixed, the identity and [[complex conjugation|conjugation]].

In the same way as in the real case, the plane may also be viewed as the simplest, one-dimensional (over the complex numbers) [[complex manifold]], sometimes called the complex line. However, this viewpoint contrasts sharply with the case of the plane as a 2-dimensional real manifold. The isomorphisms are all [[conformal map|conformal]] bijections of the complex plane, but the only possibilities are maps that correspond to the composition of a multiplication by a complex number and a translation.

In addition, the Euclidean geometry (which has zero [[curvature]] everywhere) is not the only geometry that the plane may have. The plane may be given a [[spherical geometry]] by using the [[stereographic projection]]. This can be thought of as placing a sphere on the plane (just like a ball on the floor), removing the top point, and projecting the sphere onto the plane from this point). This is one of the projections that may be used in making a flat map of part of the Earth's surface. The resulting geometry has constant positive curvature.

Alternatively, the plane can also be given a metric which gives it constant negative curvature giving the [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]]. The latter possibility finds an application in the theory of [[special relativity]] in the simplified case where there are two spatial dimensions and one time dimension. (The hyperbolic plane is a [[timelike]] [[hypersurface]] in three-dimensional [[Minkowski space]].)

==Topological and differential geometric notions==
The [[one-point compactification]] of the plane is homeomorphic to a [[sphere]] (see [[stereographic projection]]); the open disk is homeomorphic to a sphere with the "north pole" missing; adding that point completes the (compact) sphere. The result of this compactification is a [[manifold]] referred to as the [[Riemann sphere]] or the [[complex numbers|complex]] [[projective line]]. The projection from the Euclidean plane to a sphere without a point is a [[diffeomorphism]] and even a [[conformal map]].

The plane itself is homeomorphic (and diffeomorphic) to an open [[disk (mathematics)|disk]]. For the [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]] such diffeomorphism is conformal, but for the Euclidean plane it is not.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6083">'''Psychologism''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] position, according to which [[psychology]] plays a central role in grounding or explaining some other, non-psychological type of fact or law.

==Overview==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines ''psychologism'' as: "The view or doctrine that a theory of psychology or ideas forms the basis of an account of metaphysics, epistemology, or meaning; (sometimes) spec. the explanation or derivation of mathematical or logical laws in terms of psychological facts."&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologism in [[epistemology]], the idea that its problems "can be solved satisfactorily by the psychological study of the development of mental processes", was argued in [[John Locke]]'s ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', Psychologism.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of psychologism are logical psychologism and mathematical psychologism. Logical psychologism is a position in [[logic]] (or the philosophy of logic) according to which [[Classical logic|logical laws]] and [[mathematics|mathematical]] laws are grounded in, derived from, explained or exhausted by psychological facts or laws. Psychologism in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] is the position that mathematical concepts and/or truths are grounded in, derived from or explained by psychological facts or laws.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shaun Gallagher|Gallagher, S.]], ''Phenomenology'' ([[New York City|New York]]: [[Palgrave Macmillan]], 2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=c7sYDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 20].&lt;/ref&gt;

The word was coined by [[Johann Eduard Erdmann]] as ''Psychologismus'', being translated into English as ''psychologism''.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ''[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/psychologism/ Psychologism]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Kusch|Kusch, M.]], ''Psychologism: The Sociology of Philosophical Knowledge'' (London &amp; New York: [[Routledge]], 1995), [https://books.google.com/books?id=JJuIAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA101#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 101].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Stuart Mill]] was accused by [[Edmund Husserl]] of being an advocate of a type of logical psychologism, although this may not have been the case.&lt;ref&gt;Skorupski, JM., [https://books.google.com/books?id=ghesAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=psychologism+mill&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GWNsVPvSHNf3aorHgdgD&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=psychologism%20mill&amp;f=false ''Mill (Arguments of the Philosophers)''], Routledge, 2010, pp. 127-128.&lt;/ref&gt; So were many nineteenth-century German philosophers such as [[Christoph von Sigwart]], [[Benno Erdmann]],  [[Theodor Lipps]], [[Gerardus Heymans]], [[Wilhelm Jerusalem]], and {{Interlanguage link multi|Theodor Elsenhans|de}},&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/psychologism/#ExaPsyRea Psychologism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy): "Examples of Psychologistic Reasoning"]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a number of psychologists, past and present (e.g., [[Wilhelm Wundt]]&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt; and [[Gustave Le Bon]]&lt;ref&gt;Jerzy Szacki, ''History of Sociological Thought'', Greenwood Press, 1979, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Psychologism was notably criticized by [[Gottlob Frege]] in his [[anti-psychologistic]] work ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'', and many of his works and essays, including his review of Husserl's ''[[Philosophy of Arithmetic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Haddock, G. E. R., ''A Critical Introduction to the Philosophy of Gottlob Frege'' ([[London]] and [[New York City|New York]]: [[Routledge]], 2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=wsi1CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110&amp;redir_esc=y&amp;hl=pl#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 110].&lt;/ref&gt; Husserl, in the first volume of his ''[[Logical Investigations (Husserl)|Logical Investigations]]'', called "The Prolegomena of Pure Logic", criticized psychologism thoroughly and sought to distance himself from it. Frege's arguments were largely ignored, while Husserl's were widely discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kusch |first=Martin |authorlink= |date=November 7, 2011 |coauthors= |title=Psychologism |publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |location= |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/psychologism/ |doi= |id= |accessdate=Nov 19, 2014 |ref=harvnb }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Psychologism and Behaviorism", [[Ned Block]] takes psychologism as the position that "whether behavior is intelligent behavior depends on the character of the internal information processing that produces it." This is in contrast to a behavioral view which would state that intelligence can be ascribed to a being solely via observing its behavior. This latter type of behavioral view is strongly associated with the [[Turing test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11545">'''Structural induction''' is a [[proof method]] that is used in [[mathematical logic]] (e.g., in the proof of [[Ultraproduct#Łoś' theorem|Łoś' theorem]]), [[computer science]], [[graph theory]], and some other mathematical fields.  It is a generalization of [[mathematical induction|mathematical induction over natural numbers]], and can be further generalized to arbitrary [[Noetherian induction]].  '''Structural recursion''' is a [[recursion]] method bearing the same relationship to structural induction as ordinary recursion bears to ordinary [[mathematical induction]].

Structural induction is used to prove that some proposition ''P''(''x'') holds [[for all]] ''x'' of some sort of [[recursive definition|recursively defined]] structure, such as
[[First-order logic#Formulas|formulas]], [[List (computer science)|list]]s, or [[Tree (graph theory)|tree]]s.  A [[well-founded]] [[partial order]] is defined on the structures ("subformula" for formulas, "sublist" for lists, and "subtree" for trees).  The structural induction proof is a proof that the proposition holds for all the [[minimal element|minimal]] structures, and that if it holds for the immediate substructures of a certain structure ''S'', then it must hold for ''S'' also. (Formally speaking, this then satisfies the premises of an axiom of [[well-founded induction]], which asserts that these two conditions are sufficient for the proposition to hold for all ''x''.)

A structurally recursive function uses the same idea to define a recursive function: "base cases" handle each minimal structure and a rule for recursion.  Structural recursion is usually proved correct by structural induction; in particularly easy cases, the inductive step is often left out.  The ''length'' and ++ functions in the example below are structurally recursive.

For example, if the structures are lists, one usually introduces the partial order '&lt;' in which ''L'' &lt; ''M'' whenever list ''L'' is the tail of list ''M''.  Under this ordering, the empty list [] is the unique minimal element.  A structural induction proof of some proposition {{math|''P''(''l'')}} then consists of two parts:  A proof that ''P''([]) is true, and a proof that if ''P''(''L'') is true for some list ''L'', and if ''L'' is the tail of list ''M'', then ''P''(''M'') must also be true.

Eventually, there may exist more than one base case, and/or more than one inductive case, depending on how the function or structure was constructed. In those cases, a structural induction proof of some proposition {{math|''P''(''l'')}} then consists of: 
{{ordered list|list_style_type=upper-alpha

|a proof that ''P''(''BC'') is true for each base case ''BC'', and 
|a proof that if {{math|''P''(''I'')}} is true for some instance {{mvar|I}}, and ''M'' can be obtained from {{mvar|I}} by applying any one recursive rule once, then ''P''(''M'') must also be true.}}

==Examples==

[[File:Waldburg Ahnentafel.jpg|thumb|Ancient ancestor tree, showing 31 persons in 5 generations.]]
An [[family tree|ancestor tree]] is a commonly known data structure, showing the parents, grandparents, etc. of a person as far as known (see picture for an example). It is recursively defined:
* in the simplest case, an ancestor tree shows just one person (if nothing is known about their parents);
* alternatively, an ancestor tree shows one person and, connected by branches, the two ancestor subtrees of their parents (using for brevity of proof the simplifying assumption that if one of them is known, both are).

As an example, the property "An ancestor tree extending over ''g'' generations shows at most {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''g''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}} persons" can be proven by structural induction as follows:
* In the simplest case, the tree shows just one person and hence one generation; the property is true for such a tree, since {{math|1 ≤ 2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}}.
* Alternatively, the tree shows one person and their parents' trees. Since each of the latter is a substructure of the whole tree, it can be assumed to satisfy the property to be proven (a.k.a. the ''induction hypothesis''). That is, {{math|''p'' ≤ 2&lt;sup&gt;''g''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}} and {{math|''q'' ≤ 2&lt;sup&gt;''h''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}} can be assumed, where ''g'' and ''h'' denotes the number of generations the father's and the mother's subtree extends over, respectively, and ''p'' and ''q'' denote the numbers of persons they show.
** In case {{math|''g''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''h''}}, the whole tree extends over {{math|1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''h''}} generations and shows {{math|1=''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''q''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1}} persons, and {{math|1=''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''q''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 ≤ (2&lt;sup&gt;''g''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1) + (2&lt;sup&gt;''h''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 ≤&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''h''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''h''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 = 2&lt;sup&gt;1+''h''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}}, i.e. the whole tree satisfies the property.
** In case {{math|1=''h''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''g''}}, the whole tree extends over {{math|1=1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''g''}} generations and shows {{math|''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''q''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 ≤&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''g''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}} persons by similar reasoning, i.e. the whole tree satisfies the property in this case also.
Hence, by structural induction, each ancestor tree satisfies the property.

As another, more formal example, consider the following property of lists:

     length (L ++ M) = length L + length M          [EQ]

Here ++ denotes the list concatenation operation, and L and M are lists.

In order to prove this, we need definitions for length and for the concatenation operation. Let (h:t) denote a list whose head (first element) is ''h'' and whose tail (list of remaining elements) is ''t'', and let [] denote the empty list. The definitions for length and the concatenation operation are:

     length []     = 0                  [LEN1]
     length (h:t)  = 1 + length t       [LEN2]

     []    ++ list = list               [APP1]
     (h:t) ++ list = h : (t ++ list)    [APP2]

Our proposition {{math|1=''P''(''l'')}} is that  EQ is true for all lists ''M'' when ''L'' is {{mvar|l}}.  We want to show that {{math|1=''P''(''l'')}} is true for all lists {{mvar|l}}.    We will prove this by structural induction on lists.

First we will prove that ''P''([]) is true; that is, EQ is true for all lists ''M'' when ''L'' happens to be the empty list []. Consider EQ:

       length (L ++ M)  = length ([] ++ M)
                        = length M                     (by APP1)
                        = 0 + length M
                        = length [] + length M         (by LEN1)
                        = length L  + length M

So this part of the theorem is proved; EQ is true for all ''M'', when ''L'' is [], because the left-hand side and the right-hand side  are equal.

Next, consider any nonempty list {{mvar|I}}. Since {{mvar|I}} is nonempty, it has a head item, x, and a tail list, xs, so we can express it as (x:xs).  The induction hypothesis is that EQ is true for all values of ''M'' when ''L'' is ''xs'':

     length (xs ++ M) = length xs + length M    (hypothesis)

We would like to show that if this is the case, then EQ is also true for all values of ''M'' when {{math|1=''L'' = ''I''}} = (x:xs). We proceed as before:

     length L  + length M      = length (x:xs) + length M
                               = 1 + length xs + length M     (by LEN2)
                               = 1 + length (xs ++ M)         (by hypothesis)
                               = length (x: (xs ++ M))        (by LEN2)
                               = length ((x:xs) ++ M)         (by APP2)
                               = length (L ++ M)

Thus, from structural induction, we obtain that P(L) is true for all lists L.

==Well-ordering==

Just as standard [[mathematical induction]] is equivalent to the [[well-ordering principle]], structural induction is also equivalent to a well-ordering principle.  If the set of all structures of a certain kind admits a well-founded partial order, then every nonempty subset must have a minimal element.  (This is the definition of "[[well-founded]]".)  The significance of the lemma in this context is that it allows us to deduce that if there are any counterexamples to the theorem we want to prove, then there must be a minimal counterexample.  If we can show the existence of the minimal counterexample implies an even smaller counterexample, we have a contradiction (since the minimal counterexample isn't minimal) and so the set of counterexamples must be empty.

As an example of this type of argument, consider the set of all [[binary tree]]s.  We will show that the number of leaves in a full binary tree is one more than the number of interior nodes.  Suppose there is a counterexample; then there must exist one with the minimal possible number of interior nodes.  This counterexample, ''C'', has ''n'' interior nodes and {{mvar|l}} leaves, where {{math|1=''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 ≠&amp;nbsp;''l''}}.   Moreover, ''C'' must be nontrivial, because the trivial tree has {{math|1=''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0}} and {{math|1=''l''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1}} and is therefore not a counterexample. ''C'' therefore has at least one leaf whose parent node is an interior node.  Delete this leaf and its parent from the tree, promoting the leaf's sibling node to the position formerly occupied by its parent.  This  reduces both ''n'' and {{mvar|l}} by 1, so the new tree also has {{math|1=''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 ≠&amp;nbsp;''l''}} and is therefore a smaller counterexample.  But by hypothesis, ''C'' was already the smallest counterexample; therefore, the supposition that there were any counterexamples to begin with must have been false.  The  partial ordering implied by 'smaller' here is the one that says that ''S'' &lt; ''T'' whenever ''S'' has fewer nodes than ''T''.

'''''Summa de arithmetica, geometria, proportioni et proportionalita''''' (''Summary of arithmetic, geometry, proportions and proportionality'') is a book on [[mathematics]] written by [[Luca Pacioli]] and first published in 1494. It contains a comprehensive summary of [[The Renaissance|Renaissance]] mathematics, including practical arithmetic, basic [[algebra]], basic [[geometry]] and [[accounting]], written in [[Italian language|Italian]] for use as a textbook.

The ''Summa'' is the first printed work on algebra in a [[vernacular]] language, and it contains the first published description of the [[double-entry bookkeeping system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Mathematical Treasures - Pacioli's Summa|last=Swetz|first=Frank J|last2=Katz|first2=Victor J|publisher=[[Mathematical Association of America]]|work=Loci|date=January 2011|url=http://www.maa.org/publications/periodicals/convergence/mathematical-treasures-paciolis-summa|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It set a new standard for writing and argumentation about algebra,&lt;ref name="argument"&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Heeffer|first=Albrecht|title=From Problem Solving to Argumentation: Pacioli’s Appropriation of Abbacus Algebra|publisher=[[Ghent University]]|url=http://logica.ugent.be/albrecht/thesis/Argumentation2.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its impact upon the subsequent development and standardization of professional accounting methods was so great that Pacioli is sometimes referred to as the "father of accounting."&lt;ref name="AAA"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Luca Pacioli: The Father of Accounting|last=Smith|first=L Murphy|date=2011|publisher=[[American Accounting Association]]|url=http://aaahq.org/southwest/pacioli.htm|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The ''Summa de arithmetica'' as originally printed consists of ten chapters on a series of mathematical topics, collectively covering essentially all of Renaissance mathematics. The first seven chapters form a summary of arithmetic in 222 pages. The eighth chapter explains contemporary algebra in 78 pages. The ninth chapter discusses various topics relevant to business and trade, including [[barter]], [[bills of exchange]], weights and measures and [[bookkeeping]], in 150 pages. The tenth and final chapter describes practical geometry (including basic [[trigonometry]]) in 151 pages.&lt;ref name="MARKET"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sangster|first=Alan|last2=Stoner|first2=Gregory N|last3=McCarthy|first3=Patricia|title=THE MARKET FOR LUCA PACIOLI’S ''SUMMA ARITHMETICA''|journal=Accounting Historians Journal|volume=35|number=1|date=June 2008|pages=111–134|url=http://eprints.mdx.ac.uk/3201/1/final_final_proof_Market_paper_050308.pdf|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was dedicated to [[Guidobaldo da Montefeltro]], Duke of [[Urbino]], a patron of the arts whom Pacioli had met in Rome some years earlier.

The book's mathematical content draws heavily on the traditions of the [[abacus school]]s of contemporary northern Italy, where the children of merchants and the middle class studied arithmetic on the model established by [[Fibonacci]]'s ''[[Liber Abaci]]''. The emphasis of this tradition was on facility with computation, using the [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]], developed through exposure to numerous example problems and case studies drawn principally from business and trade. Pacioli's work likewise teaches through examples, but it also develops arguments for the validity of its solutions through reference to general principles, axioms and logical proof. In this way the ''Summa'' begins to reintegrate the logical methods of classical Greek geometry into the medieval discipline of algebra.&lt;ref name="history of thought"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Pacioli, Luca|encyclopedia=Il Contributo italiano alla storia del Pensiero – Scienze|language=Italian|year=2013|last=Napolitani|first=Pier Daniele|publisher=Treccani|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/luca-pacioli_%28Il-Contributo-italiano-alla-storia-del-Pensiero:-Scienze%29/|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bookkeeping and finance===
Within the chapter on business, a section entitled ''Particularis de computis et scripturis'' (''Details of calculation and recording'') describes the accounting methods then in use among northern-Italian merchants, including [[double-entry bookkeeping system|double-entry bookkeeping]], [[trial balance]]s, [[balance sheet]]s and various other tools still employed by professional accountants. The business chapter also introduces the [[rule of 72]] for predicting an investment's [[future value]], anticipating the development of the [[logarithm]] by more than century.&lt;ref name="paccioliLog"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Pacioli_logarithm.html|publisher=[[University of St Andrews]]|website=MacTutor|title=A Napierian logarithm before Napier|last=O'Connor|first=John J|last2=Robertson|first2=Edmund F|date=March 2006|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These techniques did not originate with Pacioli, who merely recorded and explained the established best practices of contemporary businesspeople in his region; still, the ''Summa'''s role in standardizing and disseminating professional bookkeeping methods has earned Pacioli a reputation as the "father of accounting."&lt;ref name="AAA"/&gt; 

==History and impact==
[[Image:Pacioli summa stamp.jpg|thumb|1994 Italian 750-lira postage stamp commemorating the 500th anniversary of the ''Summa'''s publication]]
''Summa de arithmetica'' was composed over a period of decades through Pacioli's work as a professor of mathematics, and was probably intended as a textbook and reference work for students of mathematics and business, especially among the mercantile middle class of northern Italy.&lt;ref name="MARKET"/&gt; The book was originally published in [[Venice]] in 1494 by [[Paganino Paganini]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=PAGANINI, Paganino|encyclopedia=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani|language=Italian|volume=80|year=2014|last=Nuovo|first=Angela|publisher=Treccani|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/paganino-paganini_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29/|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an identical second edition printed in 1523 in Toscolano.

While the ''Summa'' contained little or no original mathematical work by Pacioli, it was the most comprehensive mathematical text ever published at the time. Its thoroughness and clarity (and the lack of any other similar work available in print) made it a basic point of reference for European mathematicians through the sixteenth century and beyond.&lt;ref name="history of thought"/&gt; The reputation the ''Summa'' earned Pacioli as a mathematician and intellectual inspired [[Ludovico Sforza]], Duke of [[Milan]], to invite him to serve as a mathematical lecturer in the ducal court, where Pacioli befriended and collaborated with [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

The book also marks the beginning of a movement in sixteenth-century algebra toward the use of logical argumentation and [[theorem]]s in the study of algebra, following the model of classical Greek geometry established by [[Euclid]].&lt;ref name="argument"/&gt; It includes the first printed example of a set of [[plus and minus signs]] that were to become standard in Italian Renaissance mathematics: 'p' with a tilde above (p̄) for "plus" and 'm' with a tilde (m̄) for minus.&lt;ref name="MARKET"/&gt; Pacioli's (incorrect) assertion in the ''Summa'' that there was no general solution to [[cubic equation]]s helped to popularize the problem among contemporary mathematicians, contributing to its eventual solution by [[Scipione del Ferro]].

In 1994 Italy issued a 750-[[Italian lira|lira]] [[postage stamp]] honoring the 500th anniversary of the ''Summa'''s publication, depicting Pacioli surrounded by mathematical and geometric implements. The image on the stamp was inspired by the ''[[Portrait of Luca Pacioli]]'', and contains many of the same elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Sovietesque Disappearance of Pacioli’s Rhombicuboctahedron|author=John F.

The tables below list all of the [[divisor]]s of the numbers 1 to 1000.

A '''divisor''' of an [[integer]] ''n'' is an integer ''m'', for which ''n''/''m'' is again an integer (which is necessarily also a divisor of ''n''). For example, 3 is a divisor of 21, since 21/7&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 (and 7 is also a divisor of 21).

If ''m'' is a divisor of ''n'' then so is &amp;minus;''m''. The tables below only list positive divisors.

== Key to the tables ==

*[[Divisor function | ''d''(''n'')]] is the number of positive divisors of ''n'', including 1 and ''n'' itself
*[[Divisor function | σ(''n'')]] is the sum of the positive divisors of ''n'', including 1 and ''n'' itself
*[[Divisor function | ''s''(''n'')]] is the sum of the [[proper divisors]] of ''n'', which does not include ''n'' itself; that is,  ''s''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;σ(''n'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''n''
*a [[perfect number]] equals the sum of its proper divisors; that is, ''s''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''
*a [[deficient number]] is greater than the sum of its proper divisors; that is, ''s''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''n''
*an [[abundant number]] is lesser than the sum of its proper divisors; that is, ''s''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''
*a [[prime number]] has only 1 and itself as divisors; that is, ''d''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2.  Prime numbers are always deficient as ''s''(''n'')=1
*a [[sublime number]] has a perfect number of divisors, that is ''d''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''perfect number'', and whose divisors add up to another perfect number, that is σ(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''perfect number''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2218">In mathematics, a '''uniqueness theorem''' is a [[theorem]] proving that certain conditions determine a unique solution. Examples of uniqueness theorems include:

* [[Alexandrov's uniqueness theorem]] of three-dimensional polyhedra
* [[Black hole uniqueness theorem]]
* [[Cauchy–Kowalevski theorem]] is the main local [[existence theorem|existence]] and uniqueness theorem for [[analytic function|analytic]] [[partial differential equation]]s associated with [[Cauchy problem|Cauchy initial value problem]]s.
* [[Cauchy–Kowalevski theorem#Cauchy–Kowalevski–Kashiwara theorem|Cauchy–Kowalevski–Kashiwara theorem]] is a wide generalization of the Cauchy–Kowalevski theorem for systems of linear partial differential equations with analytic coefficients.
* [[Fundamental theorem of arithmetic]], the uniqueness of prime factorization.
* [[Holmgren's uniqueness theorem]] for linear partial differential equations with real analytic coefficients.
* [[Picard–Lindelöf theorem]], the uniqueness of solutions to first-order differential equations.
* [[Thompson uniqueness theorem]] in finite group theory
* [[Uniqueness theorem for Poisson's equation]]
* [[Electromagnetism uniqueness theorem]] for the solution of Maxwell's equation
* [[Uniqueness case]] in finite group theory
A theorem, also called a unicity theorem, stating the uniqueness of a mathematical object, which usually means that there is only one object fulfilling given properties, or that all objects of a given class are equivalent (i.e., they can be represented by the same model). This is often expressed by saying that the object is uniquely determined by a certain set of data. The word unique is sometimes replaced by essentially unique, whenever one wants to stress that the uniqueness is only referred to the underlying structure, whereas the form may vary in all ways that do not affect the mathematical content.

A uniqueness theorem / proof is, at least within mathematics of differential equations, often combined with an existence theorem / proof to a combined existence and uniqueness theorem.

{{lowercase title}}
The '''van Genuchten–Gupta model''' is an inverted [[Sigmoid function|S-curve]] applicable to [[crop yield]] and [[soil salinity]] relations.&lt;ref&gt;M. Th. van Genuchten and S.K. Gupta, 1993. '''USDA-ARS, U.S. Salinity Laboratory 4500 Glenwood Drive, Riverside, California, USA, 92501.''' ''A reassessment of the Crop Tolerance Response Function.'' Journal of the Indian Society of Soil Science, Vol. 41, No. 4, pp 730–737.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Van Genugten-Gupta model.png|thumb|300px|Van Genuchten-Gupta model for crop response to soil salinity.]]

==Equation==

The mathematical expression is:

: Y = Ym &lt;big&gt;/&lt;/big&gt; [ 1 + {C / C&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;} &lt;sup&gt;&lt;big&gt;P&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; ]

where Y = yield, Ym = maximum yield of the model, C = salt concentration of the soil, C&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = C value at 50% yield, P = an exponent to be found by [[optimization]] and maximizing the model's [[goodness of fit]] to the data.

In the figure: Ym = 3.1, C&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 12.4, P = 3.75

==Alternative 1==
[[File:S-curve model.png|thumb|300px|Logistic S-curve model for the relation between crop yield and soil salinity]]

As an alternative, the '''[[Logistic function|logistic S-function]]''' can be used.

The mathematical expression is:

: Y&lt;big&gt;^&lt;/big&gt; = 1 &lt;big&gt;/&lt;/big&gt; { 1 + &lt;big&gt;e&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;big&gt; (A.X&lt;big&gt;&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/big&gt; + B)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; }

where:

: Y&lt;big&gt;^&lt;/big&gt; = (Y - Yn) &lt;big&gt;/&lt;/big&gt; (Ym - Yn)

with Y =Yield, Yn = minimum Y, Ym = maximum Y, X = salt concentration of the soil, while A, B and C are constants to be determined by [[optimization]] and maximizing the model's [[goodness of fit]] to the data.

If the minimum Yn=0 then the expression can be simplified to:

: Y = Ym &lt;big&gt;/&lt;/big&gt; { 1 + &lt;big&gt;e&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;big&gt; (A.X&lt;big&gt;&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/big&gt; + B)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; }

In the figure: Ym = 3.43, Yn = 0.47, A = 0.112, B = -3.16, C = 1.42.

==Alternative 2==
[[File:Cubic regression.png|thumb|300px|Cubic regression to find the relation between crop yield and soil salinity]]

The third degree or '''[[Polynomial regression|cubic regression]]''' also offers a useful alternative.

The equation reads:

: Y = A.X&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + B.X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + C.X + D

with Y =Yield, X = salt concentration of the soil, while A, B, C and D are constants to be determined by the regression.

In the figure: A = 0.0017, B = 0.0604, C=0.3874, D = 2.3788. These values were calculated with [[Microsoft Excel]]

The curvature is more pronounced than in the other models.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2756">{{redirect|WLOG|the radio station|WLOG (FM)}}'''Without loss of generality''' (often abbreviated to '''WOLOG''', '''WLOG''' or '''w.l.o.g.'''; less commonly stated as '''without any loss of generality''' or '''with no loss of generality''') is a frequently used expression in [[mathematics]]. The term is used before an assumption in a proof which narrows the premise to some special case; it implies that the proof for that case can be easily applied to all others, or that all other cases are equivalent or similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Gary|last1=Chartrand|author1-link=Gary Chartrand|first2=Albert D.|last2=Polimeni|first3=Ping|last3=Zhang|author3-link=Ping Zhang (graph theorist)|title=Mathematical Proofs / A Transition to Advanced Mathematics|edition=2nd|publisher=Pearson/Addison Wesley|year=2008|isbn=0-321-39053-9|pages=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, given a proof of the conclusion in the special case, it is [[Trivial (mathematics)|trivial]] to adapt it to prove the conclusion in all other cases.

This is often enabled by the presence of [[symmetry]]. For example, if some property ''P''(''x'',''y'') of [[real number]]s is known to be symmetrical in ''x'' and ''y'', namely that ''P''(''x'',''y'') is equivalent to ''P''(''y'',''x''), then in proving that ''P''(''x'',''y'') holds for every ''x'' and ''y'', we may assume "without loss of generality" that ''x'' ≤ ''y''. There is then no loss of generality in that assumption: once the case ''x'' ≤ ''y'' [[Material conditional|⇒]] ''P''(''x'',''y'') has been proved, the other case follows by ''y'' ≤ ''x'' ⇒&lt;ref&gt;from the just proved implication by interchanging ''x'' and ''y''&lt;/ref&gt; ''P''(''y'',''x'') ⇒&lt;ref&gt;by symmetry of ''P''&lt;/ref&gt; ''P''(''x'',''y''); hence, ''P''(''x'',''y'') holds in all cases.

== Example ==

Consider the following [[theorem]] (which is a case of the [[pigeonhole principle]]):

{{quote|If three objects are each painted either red or blue, then there must be at least two objects of the same color.}} 

A proof: 
{{quote|Assume without loss of generality that the first object is red. If either of the other two objects is red, we are finished; if not, the other two objects must both be blue and we are still finished.}}

This works because exactly the same reasoning (with "red" and "blue" interchanged) could be applied if the alternative assumption were made, namely that the first object is blue.
