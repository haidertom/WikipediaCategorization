      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9183">In [[mathematics]], various typographical forms of [[bracket]]s are frequently used in [[mathematical notation]] such as [[parentheses]] (&amp;nbsp;), [[square brackets]] [&amp;nbsp;], braces {&amp;nbsp;}, and [[angle brackets]] ⟨&amp;nbsp;⟩.  Generally such bracketing denotes some form of grouping: in evaluating an expression containing a bracketed sub-expression, the operators in the sub-expression take precedence over those surrounding it. Additionally, there are several  uses and meanings for the various brackets.

Historically, other notations, such as the [[vinculum (symbol)|vinculum]], were similarly used for grouping; in present-day use, these notations all have specific meanings. The earliest use of brackets to indicate aggregation (i.e. grouping) was suggested in 1608 by [[Christopher Clavius]] and in 1629 by [[Albert Girard]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Cajori]], Florian 1980. ''A history of mathematics''. New York: Chelsea Publishing, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbols for representing angle brackets==
A variety of different symbols are used to represent angle brackets. In e-mail and other [[ASCII]] text it is common to use the less-than (&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;) and greater-than (&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) signs to represent angle brackets, because ASCII does not include angle brackets.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The New Hacker's Dictionary|first=Eric S.|last=Raymond|authorlink=Eric S. Raymond|publisher=MIT Press|year=1996|isbn=9780262680929|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g80P_4v4QbIC&amp;pg=PA41}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Unicode]] has three pairs of dedicated characters:
* {{unichar|27E8|MATHEMATICAL LEFT ANGLE BRACKET}} and {{unichar|27E9|MATHEMATICAL RIGHT ANGLE BRACKET}}
* {{unichar|3008|LEFT ANGLE BRACKET}} and {{unichar|3009|RIGHT ANGLE BRACKET}}, used in Chinese punctuation
* {{unichar|2329|LEFT-POINTING ANGLE BRACKET}} and {{unichar|232A|RIGHT-POINTING ANGLE BRACKET}}, which are deprecated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2300.pdf||title=Miscellaneous Technical|publisher=unicode.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[LaTeX]] the markup is &lt;code&gt;\langle&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;\rangle&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\langle\ \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

==Algebra==
{{See|1=Associative property|2=Bracketing (linguistics)|3=Dyck language}}

In [[elementary algebra]] parentheses, ( ), are used to specify the [[order of operations]]. Terms inside the bracket are evaluated first; hence 2×(3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4) is 14 and 10 ÷ 5(1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0) is 2 and 8 ÷ 4(2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0) is 1 and (2×3)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4 is 10. This notation is extended to cover more general [[algebra]] involving variables: for example &lt;math&gt;(x+y)\times(x-y)&lt;/math&gt;. Square brackets are also often used in place of a second set of parentheses when they are nested, to provide a visual distinction.

Also in [[mathematical expression]]s in general, parentheses are used to indicate grouping (that is, which parts belong together) when necessary to avoid ambiguities, or for the sake of clarity. For example, in the formula (εη)&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; = ε&lt;sub&gt;''Cod η&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;/sub&gt;η&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, used in the definition of composition of two [[natural transformation]]s, the parentheses around εη serve to indicate that the indexing by ''X'' is applied to the composition εη, and not just its last component η.

==Functions==
The arguments to a [[function (mathematics)|function]] are frequently surrounded by brackets: &lt;math&gt;f(x) &lt;/math&gt;. It is common to omit the parentheses around the argument when there is little chance of ambiguity, thus: &lt;math&gt;\sin x&lt;/math&gt;.

==Coordinates and vectors==

In the [[cartesian coordinate system]] brackets are used to specify the coordinates of a point: (2,3) denotes the point with ''x''-coordinate 2 and ''y''-coordinate 3. 

The [[inner product]] of two vectors is commonly written as &lt;math&gt; \langle a, b\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, but the notation (''a'', ''b'') is also used.

==Intervals==
{{main|Interval (mathematics)}}
Both parentheses, ( ), and square brackets, [ ], can also be used to denote an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]].  The notation &lt;math&gt;[a, c)&lt;/math&gt; is used to indicate an interval from a to c that is inclusive of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; but exclusive of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;. That is, &lt;math&gt;[5, 12)&lt;/math&gt; would be the set of all real numbers between 5 and 12, including 5 but not 12. The numbers may come as close as they like to 12, including 11.999 and so forth (with any [[finite set|finite]] number of 9s), but 12.0 is not included. In some European countries, the notation &lt;math&gt;[5,12[&lt;/math&gt; is also used for this.

The endpoint adjoining the square bracket is known as ''closed'', while the endpoint adjoining the parenthesis is known as ''open''. If both types of brackets are the same, the entire interval may be referred to as ''closed'' or ''open'' as appropriate. Whenever [[infinity]] or negative infinity is used as an endpoint in the case of intervals on the real number line, it is always considered ''open'' and adjoined to a parenthesis. The endpoint can be closed when considering intervals on the [[extended real number line]].

==Sets and groups==
Braces { } are used to identify the elements of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]]: {''a'',''b'',''c''} denotes a set of three elements. 

Angle brackets are used in [[group theory]] to write [[group presentation]]s, and to denote the [[group generators|subgroup generated]] by a collection of elements.

==Matrices==
An explicitly given [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] is commonly written between large round or square brackets:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; -1 \\
2 &amp; 3 \end{pmatrix}
\quad\quad\begin{bmatrix}
c &amp; d \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Derivatives==
The notation
:&lt;math&gt;f^{(n)}(x)&lt;/math&gt;
stands for the ''n''-th derivative of function ''f'', applied to argument ''x''. So, for example, if &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \exp(\lambda x)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f^{(n)}(x) = \lambda^n\exp(\lambda x)&lt;/math&gt;. This is to be contrasted with &lt;math&gt;f^n(x) = f(f(\ldots(f(x))\ldots))&lt;/math&gt;, the ''n''-fold application of ''f'' to argument ''x''.

==Falling and rising factorial==

The notation (''x'')&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is used to denote the ''[[falling factorial]]'', an ''n''-th degree [[polynomial]] defined by
:&lt;math&gt;(x)_n=x(x-1)(x-2)\cdots(x-n+1)=\frac{x!}{(x-n)!}.&lt;/math&gt;

Confusingly, the same notation may be encountered as representing the ''rising factorial'', also called "[[Pochhammer symbol]]". Another notation for the same is ''x''&lt;sup&gt;(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;. It can be defined by
:&lt;math&gt;x^{(n)}=x(x+1)(x+2)\cdots(x+n-1)=\frac{(x+n-1)!}{(x-1)!}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Quantum mechanics==
In [[quantum mechanics]], angle brackets are also used as part of [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]]'s formalism, [[bra–ket notation]], to note vectors from the [[dual space]]s of the bra&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\left\langle A\right|&lt;/math&gt; and the ket&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\left|B\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. 

In statistical mechanics, angle brackets denote ensemble or time average.

==Polynomial rings==
Square brackets are used to denote the variable in [[polynomial ring]]s. For example, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}[x]&lt;/math&gt; is the polynomial ring with the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; variable and [[real number]] coefficients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stewart|first=Ian|title=Concepts of Modern Mathematics|year=1995|publisher=Dover Publications|page=90|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=PcqiXD_BxA4C&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lie bracket and commutator==
In [[group theory]] and [[ring theory]], square brackets are used to denote the [[commutator]].  In group theory, the commutator &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''g'',''h''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is commonly defined as ''g''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;''h''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;''gh''.  In ring theory, the commutator &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''a'',''b''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is defined as ''ab'' &amp;minus; ''ba''.  Furthermore, in  theory, braces are used to denote the [[commutator|anticommutator]] where {''a'',''b''} is defined as ''ab'' + ''ba''.  

The '''Lie bracket''' of a [[Lie algebra]] is a [[binary operation]]  denoted by &lt;math&gt;[\cdot,\cdot]:\mathfrak{g}\times\mathfrak{g}\to\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;. By using the commutator as a Lie bracket, every associative algebra can be turned into a Lie algebra. There are many different forms of '''Lie bracket''', in particular the [[Lie derivative]] and the [[Jacobi–Lie bracket]].

==Floor/ceiling functions and fractional part==

Square brackets, as in {{math|1=&amp;#91;[[Pi|π]]&amp;#93; = 3}}, are sometimes used to denote the [[floor function]], which [[rounding|rounds]] a real number down to the next integer. However the floor and ceiling functions are usually typeset with left and right square brackets where only the lower (for floor function) or upper (for ceiling function) horizontal bars are displayed, as in {{math|1=⌊π⌋ = 3}} or {{math|1=⌈π⌉ = 4}}.

Braces, as in {{math|1={π} &lt; &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;}}, may denote the [[fractional part]] of a real number.

In [[quantum mechanics]], '''bra–ket notation''' is a standard notation for describing [[quantum state]]s. It can also be used to denote abstract [[vector space|vectors]] and [[linear functional]]s in [[mathematics]]. The notation uses [[angle bracket]]s (the ⟨ and ⟩ symbols) and a [[vertical bar]] (the | symbol), to denote the [[scalar product]] of vectors or the action of a linear functional on a vector in a complex vector space.  The scalar product or action is written as

:&lt;math&gt;\langle\phi{\mid}\psi\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

The right part is called the '''ket''' {{IPAc-en|k|ɛ|t}}; it is a [[vector space|vector]], typically represented as a [[column vector]] and written 

:&lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

The left part is called the '''bra''', {{IPAc-en|b|r|ɑː}}; it is the [[Hermitian conjugate]] of the ket with the same label, typically represented as a [[row vector]] and is written

:&lt;math&gt;\langle\phi|.&lt;/math&gt;

A combination of bras, kets, and operators is interpreted using [[matrix multiplication]]. A bra and a ket with the same label are [[Hermitian conjugate]]s of each other.

Bra-ket notation was introduced in 1939 by [[Paul Dirac]]&lt;ref name="Dirac"&gt;{{harvnb|Dirac|1939}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shankar|1994|loc=Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also known as the '''Dirac notation'''.  

The bra-ket notation has a precursor in [[Hermann Grassmann]]'s use of the notation &lt;math&gt;[\phi{\mid}\psi]&lt;/math&gt;for his inner products nearly 100 years earlier.&lt;ref name="Grassmann"&gt;{{harvnb|Grassmann|1862}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
Bra–ket notation is a notation for [[linear algebra]], particularly focused on vectors, [[inner product]]s, [[linear operator]]s, [[Hermitian conjugation]], and the [[dual space]], for both finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional [[complex vector space]]s. It is specifically designed to ease the types of calculations that frequently come up in [[quantum mechanics]].

Its use in quantum mechanics is quite widespread. Many phenomena that are explained using quantum mechanics are usually explained using bra–ket notation.

In simple cases, a ket {{math|{{ket|''m''}}}} can be described as a [[column vector]], a bra with the same label {{math|{{bra|''m''}}}} is its [[conjugate transpose]] (which is a row vector), and writing bras, kets, and linear operators next to each other implies [[matrix multiplication]].&lt;ref name="Bra-Ket Notation Trivializes Matrix Multiplication"&gt;[http://algassert.com/post/1629 Gidney, Craig (2017). Bra–Ket Notation Trivializes Matrix Multiplication]&lt;/ref&gt; However, kets may also exist in uncountably-infinite-dimensional vector spaces, such that they cannot be literally written as a column vector. Also, writing a column vector as a list of numbers requires picking a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]], whereas one can write "{{math|{{ket|''m''}}}}" without committing to any particular basis. This is helpful because quantum mechanics calculations involve frequently switching between different bases (e.g. position basis, momentum basis, energy eigenbasis, etc.), so it is better to have the basis vectors (if any) written out explicitly.  In some situations involving two important basis vectors they will be referred to simply as "{{math|{{ket|''-''}}}}" and "{{math|{{ket|''+''}}}}".

The standard mathematical notation for the [[inner product]], preferred as well by some physicists, expresses exactly the same thing as the bra–ket notation,

:&lt;math&gt;(\phi,\psi) = \langle\phi{\mid}\psi\rangle = \bigl(\langle\phi|\bigr) \,  \bigl(|\psi\rangle\bigr),&lt;/math&gt;

Bras and kets can also be configured in other ways, such as the [[outer product]]

:&lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle\langle\phi|&lt;/math&gt;

which can also be represented as a matrix multiplication (i.e., a column vector times a row vector equals a matrix).

If the ket is an element of a vector space, the bra is technically an element of its [[dual space]]—see [[Riesz representation theorem]].

==Vector spaces==

===Vectors vs kets===

In mathematics, the term "vector" is used to refer generally to any element of any vector space. In physics, however, the term "vector" is much more specific: "Vector" refers almost exclusively to quantities like [[displacement (vector)|displacement]] or [[velocity]], which have three components that relate directly to the three dimensions of the real world. Such vectors are typically denoted with over arrows ({{math|{{vec|''r''}}}}) or boldface ({{math|'''r'''}}).

In quantum mechanics, a [[quantum state]] is typically represented as an element of an abstract complex vector space—for example the infinite-dimensional vector space of all possible [[wavefunction]]s (functions mapping each point of 3D space to a complex number). Since the term "vector" is already used for something else (see previous paragraph), it is very common to refer to these elements of abstract complex vector spaces as "kets", and to write them using ket notation.

===Ket notation===

Ket notation, invented by Dirac, uses vertical bars and angular brackets: {{math|{{ket|''A''}}}}. When this notation is used, these quantities are called "kets", and {{math|{{ket|''A''}}}} is read as "ket-A".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Quantum Mechanics Demystified |first=D. |last=McMahon |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2006 |isbn=0-07-145546-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These kets can be manipulated using the usual rules of linear algebra, for example:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
|A \rangle &amp;= |B\rangle + |C\rangle \\
|C \rangle &amp;= (-1+2i)|D \rangle \\
|D \rangle &amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} |x\rangle \, \mathrm{d}x \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Note how any symbols, letters, numbers, or even words—whatever serves as a convenient label—can be used as the label inside a ket. For example, the last line above involves infinitely many different kets, one for each real number {{math|''x''}}. In other words, the symbol "{{math|{{ket|''A''}}}}" has a specific and universal mathematical meaning, while just the "{{math|''A''}}" by itself does not. For example, {{math|{{ket|1}} + {{ket|2}}}} might or might not be equal to {{math|{{ket|3}}}}. Nevertheless, for convenience, there is usually some logical scheme behind the labels inside kets, such as the common practice of labeling [[stationary state|energy eigenkets]] in quantum mechanics through a listing of their [[quantum number]]s.

===Inner products and bras===
{{main article|Inner product}}
An [[inner product]] is a generalization of the [[dot product]]. The inner product of two vectors is a scalar. In neutral notation (notation dedicated to the inner product ''only''), this might be written {{math|(''A'', ''B'')}}, where {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} are elements of the abstract vector space, i.e. both are ''kets''.

Bra–ket notation uses a specific notation for inner products:

:&lt;math&gt; (A, B) = \langle A | B \rangle = \text{the inner product of ket } | A \rangle \text{ with ket } | B \rangle&lt;/math&gt;

Bra–ket notation splits this inner product (also called a "bracket") into two pieces, the "bra" and the "ket":

:&lt;math&gt; \langle A | B \rangle = \bigl( \langle A | \bigr) \, \bigl( | B \rangle \bigr)&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|{{bra|''A''}}}} is called a bra, read as "bra-A", and {{math|{{ket|''B''}}}} is a ket as above.

The purpose of "splitting" the inner product into a bra and a ket is that ''both'' the bra {{math|{{bra|''A''}}}} and the ket {{math|{{ket|''B''}}}} are meaningful ''on their own'', and can be used in other contexts besides within an inner product. There are two main ways to think about the meanings of separate bras and kets. Accordingly, the interpretation of the expression {{math|{{bra-ket|''A''|''B''}}}} has a second interpretation, namely that of the action of a [[linear functional]] per below.

====Bras and kets as row and column vectors====
For a finite-dimensional vector space, using a fixed [[orthonormal basis]], the inner product can be written as a [[matrix multiplication]] of a row vector with a column vector:
:&lt;math&gt; \langle A | B \rangle \doteq A_1^* B_1 + A_2^* B_2 + \cdots + A_N^* B_N =
\begin{pmatrix} A_1^* &amp; A_2^* &amp; \cdots &amp; A_N^* \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} B_1 \\ B_2 \\ \vdots \\ B_N \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
Based on this, the bras and kets can be defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \langle A | &amp;\doteq \begin{pmatrix} A_1^* &amp; A_2^* &amp; \cdots &amp; A_N^* \end{pmatrix} \\
| B \rangle &amp;\doteq \begin{pmatrix} B_1 \\ B_2 \\ \vdots \\ B_N \end{pmatrix} \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and then it is understood that a bra next to a ket implies [[matrix multiplication]].

The [[conjugate transpose]] (also called ''Hermitian conjugate'') of a bra is the corresponding ket and vice versa:
:&lt;math&gt;\langle A |^\dagger = |A \rangle, \quad |A \rangle^\dagger = \langle A |&lt;/math&gt;
because if one starts with the bra
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} A_1^* &amp; A_2^* &amp; \cdots &amp; A_N^* \end{pmatrix} \,,&lt;/math&gt;
then performs a [[complex conjugation]], and then a [[matrix transpose]], one ends up with the ket
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} A_1 \\ A_2 \\ \vdots \\ A_N \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

====Bras as linear functionals====
{{main article|Dual space|Riesz representation theorem}}
A more abstract definition, which is equivalent but more easily generalized to infinite-dimensional spaces, is to say that bras are [[linear functional]]s on the space of kets, i.e. linear transformations that input a ket and output a complex number. The bra linear functionals are defined to be consistent with the inner product. Thus, if {{math|{{bra|''A''}}}} is the linear functional corresponding to {{math|{{ket|''A''}}}} under the [[Riesz representation theorem]], then

:&lt;math&gt;\langle A | B \rangle = \langle A|\bigl(|B\rangle\bigr)\,,&lt;/math&gt;

i.e. it produces ''the same'' complex number as the inner product does. The terminology for the right hand side is though ''not'' inner product, which always involves two ''kets''. Confusing this is harmless, since the same number is produced in the end.

In mathematics terminology, the [[vector space]] of bras is the [[dual space]] to the vector space of kets, and corresponding bras and kets are related by the [[Riesz representation theorem]].

=== Non-normalizable states and non-Hilbert spaces ===

Bra–ket notation can be used even if the vector space is not a [[Hilbert space]].

In quantum mechanics, it is common practice to write down kets which have infinite [[norm (mathematics)|norm]], i.e. non-[[normalizable wavefunction]]s. Examples include states whose [[wavefunction]]s are [[Dirac delta function]]s or infinite [[plane wave]]s. These do not, technically, belong to the [[Hilbert space]] itself. However, the definition of "Hilbert space" can be broadened to accommodate these states (see the [[Gelfand–Naimark–Segal construction]] or [[rigged Hilbert space]]s). The bra–ket notation continues to work in an analogous way in this broader context.

[[Banach space]]s are a different generalization of Hilbert spaces. In a Banach space {{math|{{mathcal|B}}}}, the vectors may be notated by kets and the continuous [[linear functional]]s by bras. Over any vector space without [[topology]], we may also notate the vectors by kets and the linear functionals by bras. In these more general contexts, the bracket does not have the meaning of an inner product, because the Riesz representation theorem does not apply.

==Usage in quantum mechanics==

The mathematical structure of [[quantum mechanics]] is based in large part on [[linear algebra]]:
*[[Wave function]]s and other [[quantum state]]s can be represented as vectors in a complex [[Hilbert space]]. (The exact structure of this Hilbert space depends on the situation.) In bra–ket notation, for example, an electron might be in the "state" {{math|{{ket|''ψ''}}}}. (Technically, the quantum states are ''[[ray (geometry)|ray]]s'' of vectors in the Hilbert space, as {{math|''c''{{ket|''ψ''}}}} corresponds to the same state for any nonzero complex number {{math|''c''}}.)
*[[Quantum superposition]]s can be described as vector sums of the constituent states. For example, an electron in the state {{math|{{ket|1}} + ''i'' {{ket|2}}}} is in a quantum superposition of the states {{math|{{ket|1}}}} and {{math|{{ket|2}}}}.
*[[Measurement in quantum mechanics|Measurements]] are associated with [[linear operator]]s (called [[observable]]s) on the Hilbert space of quantum states.
*Dynamics are also described by linear operators on the Hilbert space. For example, in the [[Schrödinger picture]], there is a linear [[time evolution]] operator {{math|''U''}} with the property that if an electron is in state {{math|{{ket|''ψ''}}}} right now, at a later time it will be in the state {{math|''U''{{ket|''ψ''}}}}, the same {{math|''U''}} for every possible {{math|{{ket|''ψ''}}}}.
*[[Normalizable wave function|Wave function normalization]] is scaling a wave function so that its [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] is 1.

Since virtually every calculation in quantum mechanics involves vectors and linear operators, it can involve, and often does involve, bra–ket notation. A few examples follow:

===Spinless position–space wave function===
  {{multiple image
   | left
   | footer    = Components of complex vectors plotted against index number; discrete {{math|''k''}} and continuous {{math|''x''}}. Two particular components out of infinitely many are highlighted.

   | width2    = 230
   | image2    = Continuous complex vector components.svg
   | caption2  = Continuous components {{math|''ψ''(''x'')}} of a complex vector {{math|{{ket|''ψ''}} {{=}} ∫ d''x'' ''ψ''(''x''){{ket|''x''}}}}, which belongs to an ''uncountably infinite''-dimensional [[Hilbert space]]; there are infinitely many {{math|''x''}} values and basis vectors {{math|{{ket|''x''}}}}.
  }}

The Hilbert space of a [[spin (physics)|spin]]-0 point particle is spanned by a "position [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]]" {{math|{ {{ket|'''r'''}} &lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}, where the label {{math|'''r'''}} extends over the set of all points in [[position space]]. This label is the eigenvalue of the position operator acting on such a basis state, &lt;math&gt; \hat{\mathbf{r}}|\mathbf{r}\rangle =   \mathbf{r}|\mathbf{r}\rangle &lt;/math&gt;.  Since there are an [[uncountably infinite]] number of vector components in the basis, this is an uncountably infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. The dimensions of the Hilbert space (usually infinite) and position space (usually 1, 2 or 3) are not to be conflated.

Starting from any ket {{math|{{ket|Ψ}}}} in this Hilbert space,  one may ''define'' a complex scalar function of {{math|'''r'''}}, known as a [[wavefunction]],
:&lt;math&gt;\Psi(\mathbf{r}) \ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ \lang \mathbf{r}|\Psi\rang \,.&lt;/math&gt;

On the left-hand side, {{math|Ψ('''r''')}} is a function mapping any point in space to a complex number; on the right-hand side, {{math|{{ket|Ψ}} {{=}} ∫ d&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''r''' Ψ('''r''') {{ket|'''r'''}}}} is a ket consisting of a superposition of kets with relative coefficients specified by that function.

It is then customary to define linear operators acting on wavefunctions in terms of linear operators acting on kets, by
:&lt;math&gt;A \Psi(\mathbf{r}) \ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ \lang \mathbf{r}|A|\Psi\rang \,.&lt;/math&gt;

For instance, the [[momentum]] operator {{math|'''p'''}} has the following form,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} \Psi(\mathbf{r}) \ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ \lang \mathbf{r} |\mathbf{p}|\Psi\rang = - i \hbar \nabla \Psi(\mathbf{r}) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

One occasionally encounters an expression such as
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla |\Psi\rang \,,&lt;/math&gt;
though this is something of an [[abuse of notation]]. The differential operator must be understood to be an abstract operator, acting on kets, that has the effect of differentiating wavefunctions once the expression is projected into the position basis,
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \lang\mathbf{r}|\Psi\rang \,,&lt;/math&gt;
even though, in the momentum basis, the operator amounts to a mere multiplication operator (by {{math|''iħ'''''p'''}}).

===Overlap of states===
In quantum mechanics the expression {{math|{{bra-ket|''φ''|''ψ''}}}} is typically interpreted as the [[probability amplitude]] for the state {{math|''ψ''}} to [[wavefunction collapse|collapse]] into the state {{math|''φ''}}. Mathematically, this means the coefficient for the projection of {{math|''ψ''}} onto {{math|''φ''}}.  It is also described as the projection of state {{math|''ψ''}} onto state {{math|''φ''}}.

===Changing basis for a spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} particle===
A stationary [[spin-½|spin-{{sfrac|1|2}}]] particle has a two-dimensional Hilbert space. One [[orthonormal basis]] is:
:&lt;math&gt;|{\uparrow}_z \rangle \,, \; |{\downarrow}_z \rangle&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|{{ket|↑&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;}}}} is the state with a definite value of the [[angular momentum operator|spin operator {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''}}]] equal to +{{sfrac|1|2}} and  {{math|{{ket|↓&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;}}}} is the state with a definite value of the [[angular momentum operator|spin operator {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''}}]] equal to −{{sfrac|1|2}}.

Since these are a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]], ''any'' [[quantum state]] of the particle can be expressed as a [[linear combination]] (i.e., [[quantum superposition]]) of these two states:
:&lt;math&gt;|\psi \rangle = a_{\psi} |{\uparrow}_z \rangle + b_{\psi} |{\downarrow}_z \rangle&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''a&lt;sub&gt;ψ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''b&lt;sub&gt;ψ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are complex numbers.

A ''different'' basis for the same Hilbert space is:
:&lt;math&gt;|{\uparrow}_x \rangle \,, \; |{\downarrow}_x \rangle&lt;/math&gt;
defined in terms of {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''}} rather than {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

Again, ''any'' state of the particle can be expressed as a linear combination of these two:
:&lt;math&gt;|\psi \rangle = c_{\psi} |{\uparrow}_x \rangle + d_{\psi} |{\downarrow}_x \rangle&lt;/math&gt;

In vector form, you might write
:&lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle \doteq \begin{pmatrix} a_\psi \\ b_\psi \end{pmatrix} \quad \text{or} \quad |\psi\rangle \doteq \begin{pmatrix} c_\psi \\ d_\psi \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;
depending on which basis you are using. In other words, the "coordinates" of a vector depend on the basis used.

There is a mathematical relationship between {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;ψ&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;ψ&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;ψ&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''d''&lt;sub&gt;ψ&lt;/sub&gt;}}; see [[change of basis]].

===Misleading uses===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}

There are a few conventions and abuses of notation that are generally accepted by the physics community, but which might confuse the non-initiated.

It is common to use the same symbol for ''labels'' and ''constants'' in the same equation. For example, {{math|''α̂'' {{ket|''α''}} {{=}} ''α'' {{ket|''α''}}}}, where the symbol {{math|''α''}} is used '''simultaneously''' as the ''name of the operator'' {{math|''α̂''}}, its ''eigenvector'' {{math|{{ket|''α''}}}} and the associated ''eigenvalue'' {{math|''α''}}.

Something similar occurs in component notation of vectors. While {{math|''Ψ''}} (uppercase) is traditionally associated with wavefunctions, {{math|''ψ''}} (lowercase) may be used to denote a ''label'', a ''wave function'' or ''complex constant'' in the same context, usually differentiated only by a subscript.

The main abuses are including operations inside the vector labels. This is done for a fast notation of scaling vectors. E.g. if the vector {{math|{{ket|''α''}}}} is scaled by {{sqrt|2}}, it might be denoted by {{math|{{ket|''α''/{{sqrt|2}}}}}}, which makes no sense since {{math|''α''}} is a label, not a function or a number, so you can't perform operations on it.

This is especially common when denoting vectors as tensor products, where part of the labels are moved '''outside''' the designed slot, e.g. {{math|{{ket|''α''}} {{=}} {{ket|''α''/{{sqrt|2}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} ⊗ {{ket|''α''/{{sqrt|2}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}}}. Here part of the labeling that should state that all three vectors are different was moved outside the kets, as subscripts 1 and 2. And a further abuse occurs, since {{math|''α''}} is meant to refer to the norm of the first vector—which is a ''label'' denoting a ''value''.

==Linear operators==
{{see also|Linear operator}}

===Linear operators acting on kets===

A [[linear operator]] is a map that inputs a ket and outputs a ket. (In order to be called "linear", it is required to have [[linear operator|certain properties]].) In other words, if {{math|'''''A'''''}} is a linear operator and {{math|{{ket|''ψ''}}}} is a ket, then {{math|'''''A'''''{{ket|''ψ''}}}} is another ket.

In an {{math|''N''}}-dimensional Hilbert space, {{math|{{ket|''ψ''}}}} can be written as an {{math|''N'' × 1}} [[column vector]], and then {{math|'''''A'''''}} is an {{math|''N'' × ''N''}} matrix with complex entries. The ket {{math|'''''A'''''{{ket|''ψ''}}}} can be computed by normal [[matrix multiplication]].

Linear operators are ubiquitous in the theory of quantum mechanics. For example, observable physical quantities are represented by [[self-adjoint operator]]s, such as [[energy]] or [[momentum]], whereas transformative processes are represented by [[unitary operator|unitary]] linear operators such as rotation or the progression of time.

===Linear operators acting on bras===

Operators can also be viewed as acting on bras ''from the right hand side''. Specifically, if {{math|'''''A'''''}} is a linear operator and {{math|{{bra|''φ''}}}} is a bra, then {{math|{{bra|''φ''}}'''''A'''''}} is another bra defined by the rule

:&lt;math&gt;\bigl(\langle\phi|\boldsymbol{A}\bigr) |\psi\rangle = \langle\phi| \bigl(\boldsymbol{A}|\psi\rangle\bigr) \,,&lt;/math&gt;

(in other words, a [[function composition]]). This expression is commonly written as (cf. [[energy inner product]])

:&lt;math&gt;\langle\phi|\boldsymbol{A}|\psi\rangle \,.&lt;/math&gt;

In an {{math|''N''}}-dimensional Hilbert space, {{math|{{bra|''φ''}}}} can be written as a {{math|1 × ''N''}} [[row vector]], and {{math|'''''A'''''}} (as in the previous section) is an {{math|''N'' × ''N''}} matrix. Then the bra {{math|{{bra|''φ''}}'''''A'''''}} can be computed by normal [[matrix multiplication]].

If the same state vector appears on both bra and ket side,
:&lt;math&gt;\langle\psi|\boldsymbol{A}|\psi\rangle \,,&lt;/math&gt;
then this expression gives the [[expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expectation value]], or mean or average value, of the observable represented by operator {{math|'''''A'''''}} for the physical system in the state {{math|{{ket|''ψ''}}}}.

===Outer products===

A convenient way to define linear operators on a Hilbert space {{math|{{mathcal|H}}}} is given by the [[outer product]]: if {{math|{{bra|''ϕ''}}}} is a bra and {{math|{{ket|''ψ''}}}} is a ket, the outer product
:&lt;math&gt; |\phi\rang \, \lang \psi| &lt;/math&gt;
denotes the [[finite-rank operator|rank-one operator]] with the rule 
:&lt;math&gt; \bigl(|\phi\rang \lang \psi|\bigr)(x) = \lang \psi | x \rang |\phi \rang&lt;/math&gt;.

For a finite-dimensional vector space, the outer product can be understood as simple matrix multiplication:
:&lt;math&gt; |\phi \rangle \, \langle \psi | \doteq 
\begin{pmatrix} \phi_1 \\ \phi_2 \\ \vdots \\ \phi_N \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} \psi_1^* &amp; \psi_2^* &amp; \cdots &amp; \psi_N^* \end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix}
\phi_1 \psi_1^* &amp; \phi_1 \psi_2^* &amp; \cdots &amp; \phi_1 \psi_N^* \\
\phi_2 \psi_1^* &amp; \phi_2 \psi_2^* &amp; \cdots &amp; \phi_2 \psi_N^* \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
\phi_N \psi_1^* &amp; \phi_N \psi_2^* &amp; \cdots &amp; \phi_N \psi_N^* \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
The outer product is an {{math|''N'' × ''N''}} matrix, as expected for a linear operator.

One of the uses of the outer product is to construct [[projection operator]]s. Given a ket {{math|{{ket|''ψ''}}}} of norm 1, the orthogonal projection onto the [[Linear subspace|subspace]] spanned by {{math|{{ket|''ψ''}}}} is
:&lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle \, \langle\psi| \,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Hermitian conjugate operator===
{{main article|Hermitian conjugate}}
Just as kets and bras can be transformed into each other (making {{math|{{ket|''ψ''}}}} into {{math|{{bra|''ψ''}}}}), the element from the dual space corresponding to {{math|''A''{{ket|''ψ''}}}} is {{math|{{bra|''ψ''}}''A''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;}},  where {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;}} denotes the [[Hermitian conjugate]] (or adjoint) of the operator {{math|''A''}}. In other words,
:&lt;math&gt; |\phi\rangle = A |\psi\rangle \quad \text{if and only if} \quad \langle\phi| = \langle \psi | A^\dagger \,.&lt;/math&gt;

If {{math|''A''}} is expressed as an {{math|''N'' × ''N''}} matrix, then {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;}} is its [[conjugate transpose]].

[[Self-adjoint]] operators, where {{math|''A'' {{=}} ''A''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;}}, play an important role in quantum mechanics; for example, an [[observable]] is always described by a self-adjoint operator. If {{mvar|A}} is a self-adjoint operator, then {{math|{{bra|''ψ''}}''A''{{ket|''ψ''}}}} is always a real number (not complex). This implies that [[Expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expectation values]] of observables are real.

==Properties==
Bra–ket notation was designed to facilitate the formal manipulation of linear-algebraic expressions. Some of the properties that allow this manipulation are listed herein. In what follows, {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} denote arbitrary [[complex number]]s, {{math|''c''*}} denotes the [[complex conjugate]] of {{math|''c''}}, {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} denote arbitrary linear operators, and these properties are to hold for any choice of bras and kets.

===Linearity===
* Since bras are linear functionals,

::&lt;math&gt;\langle\phi| \bigl( c_1|\psi_1\rangle + c_2|\psi_2\rangle \bigr) = c_1\langle\phi|\psi_1\rangle + c_2\langle\phi|\psi_2\rangle \,. &lt;/math&gt;

* By the definition of addition and scalar multiplication of linear functionals in the [[dual space]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://bohr.physics.berkeley.edu/classes/221/1112/notes/hilbert.pdf Lecture notes by Robert Littlejohn], eqns 12 and 13&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\bigl(c_1 \langle\phi_1| + c_2 \langle\phi_2|\bigr) |\psi\rangle = c_1 \langle\phi_1|\psi\rangle + c_2 \langle\phi_2|\psi\rangle \,. &lt;/math&gt;

===Associativity===
Given any expression involving complex numbers, bras, kets, inner products, outer products, and/or linear operators (but not addition), written in bra–ket notation, the parenthetical groupings do not matter (i.e., the [[associative property]] holds). For example:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\lang \psi| \bigl(A |\phi\rang\bigr) = \bigl(\lang \psi|A\bigr)|\phi\rang \, &amp;\stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \, \lang \psi | A | \phi \rang \\
\bigl(A|\psi\rang\bigr)\lang \phi| = A\bigl(|\psi\rang \lang \phi|\bigr) \, &amp;\stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \, A | \psi \rang \lang \phi |
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and so forth. The expressions on the right (with no parentheses whatsoever) are allowed to be written unambiguously ''because'' of the equalities on the left. Note that the associative property does ''not'' hold for expressions that include nonlinear operators, such as the [[antilinear]] [[T-symmetry|time reversal operator]] in physics.

===Hermitian conjugation===
Bra–ket notation makes it particularly easy to compute the Hermitian conjugate (also called ''dagger'', and denoted {{math|†}}) of expressions. The formal rules are:
* The Hermitian conjugate of a bra is the corresponding ket, and vice versa.
* The Hermitian conjugate of a complex number is its complex conjugate.
* The Hermitian conjugate of the Hermitian conjugate of anything (linear operators, bras, kets, numbers) is itself—i.e.,
::&lt;math&gt;\left(x^\dagger\right)^\dagger=x \,.&lt;/math&gt;
* Given any combination of complex numbers, bras, kets, inner products, outer products, and/or linear operators, written in bra–ket notation, its Hermitian conjugate can be computed by reversing the order of the components, and taking the Hermitian conjugate of each.

These rules are sufficient to formally write the Hermitian conjugate of any such expression; some examples are as follows:
* Kets:
::&lt;math&gt;
\bigl(c_1|\psi_1\rangle + c_2|\psi_2\rangle\bigr)^\dagger = c_1^* \langle\psi_1| + c_2^* \langle\psi_2| \,.
&lt;/math&gt;
* Inner products:
::&lt;math&gt;\langle \phi | \psi \rangle^* = \langle \psi|\phi\rangle \,.&lt;/math&gt;

:Note that {{math|{{bra-ket|''φ''|''ψ''}}}} is a scalar, so the Hermitian conjugate is just the complex conjugate, i.e.
::&lt;math&gt;\bigl(\langle \phi | \psi \rangle\bigr)^\dagger = \langle \phi | \psi \rangle^*&lt;/math&gt;
* Matrix elements:
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\langle \phi| A | \psi \rangle^* &amp;= \left\langle \psi \left| A^\dagger \right|\phi \right\rangle \\
\left\langle \phi\left| A^\dagger B^\dagger \right| \psi \right\rangle^* &amp;= \langle \psi | BA |\phi \rangle \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
* Outer products:
::&lt;math&gt;\Big(\bigl(c_1|\phi_1\rangle\langle \psi_1|\bigr) + \bigl(c_2|\phi_2\rangle\langle\psi_2|\bigr)\Big)^\dagger = \bigl(c_1^* |\psi_1\rangle\langle \phi_1|\bigr) + \bigl(c_2^*|\psi_2\rangle\langle\phi_2|\bigr) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

==Composite bras and kets==
Two Hilbert spaces {{math|''V''}} and {{math|''W''}} may form a third space {{math|''V'' ⊗ ''W''}} by a [[tensor product]]. In quantum mechanics, this is used for describing composite systems. If a system is composed of two subsystems described in {{math|''V''}} and {{math|''W''}} respectively, then the Hilbert space of the entire system is the tensor product of the two spaces. (The exception to this is if the subsystems are actually [[identical particles]]. In that case, the situation is a little more complicated.)

If {{math|{{ket|''ψ''}}}} is a ket in {{math|''V''}} and {{math|{{ket|''φ''}}}} is a ket in {{math|''W''}}, the direct product of the two kets is a ket in {{math|''V'' ⊗ ''W''}}. This is written in various notations:
:&lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle|\phi\rangle \,,\quad |\psi\rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle\,,\quad|\psi \phi\rangle\,,\quad|\psi ,\phi\rangle\,.&lt;/math&gt;

See [[quantum entanglement#Quantum mechanical framework|quantum entanglement]] and the [[EPR paradox#Mathematical formulation|EPR paradox]] for applications of this product.

==The unit operator==
Consider a complete [[orthonormal]] system (''[[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]]''),
:&lt;math&gt;\{ e_i \ | \ i \in \mathbb{N} \} \,,&lt;/math&gt;
for a Hilbert space {{math|''H''}}, with respect to the norm from an inner product {{math|{{angbr|·,·}}}}. 

From basic [[functional analysis]], it is  known that any ket {{math|{{ket|''ψ''}}}} can also be written as
:&lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle = \sum_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \langle e_i | \psi \rangle | e_i \rangle,&lt;/math&gt;
with {{math|{{bra-ket|·|·}}}} the inner product on the Hilbert space.

From the commutativity of kets with (complex) scalars, it follows that
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i \in \mathbb{N}} | e_i \rangle \langle e_i | = 1\!\! 1&lt;/math&gt;
must be the ''identity operator'', which sends each vector to itself. 

This, then,  can be inserted in any expression without affecting its value; for example
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\langle v | w \rangle &amp;= \langle v | \left( \sum_{i \in \mathbb{N}} | e_i \rangle \langle e_i| \right) | w \rangle \\
                      &amp;= \langle v | \left( \sum_{i \in \mathbb{N}} | e_i \rangle \langle e_i| \right) \left( \sum_{j \in \mathbb{N}} | e_j \rangle \langle e_j |\right)| w \rangle \\
&amp;= \langle v | e_i \rangle \langle e_i | e_j \rangle \langle e_j | w \rangle \,, 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where, in the last identity, the [[Einstein summation convention]] has been used.

In [[quantum mechanics]], it often occurs that little or no information about the inner product {{math|{{bra-ket|''ψ''|''φ''}}}} of two arbitrary (state) kets is present, while it is still possible to say something about the expansion coefficients {{math|{{bra-ket|''ψ''|''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} {{=}} {{bra-ket|''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''|''ψ''}}*}} and {{math|{{bra-ket|''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''|''φ''}}}} of those vectors with respect to a specific (orthonormalized) basis. In this case, it is particularly useful to insert the unit operator into the bracket one time or more.

For more information, see [[Resolution of the identity]], 
*   &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {{math|1 {{=}} ∫ d''x'' {{ket|''x''}}{{bra|''x''}} {{=}} ∫ d''p'' {{ket|''p''}}{{bra|''p''}}}},  where  {{math| {{ket|''p''}} {{=}} ∫ d''x'' ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''ixp''/''ħ''&lt;/sup&gt;{{ket|''x''}}/{{sqrt|2''πħ''}}}}.  

Since {{math|{{bra-ket|''x''′|''x''}} {{=}} ''δ''(''x'' − ''x''′)}}, plane waves follow, {{math|{{bra-ket|''x''|''p''}} {{=}} ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''ixp''/''ħ''&lt;/sup&gt;/{{sqrt|2''πħ''}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;In his book (1958), Ch. III.20, Dirac defines the ''standard ket'' which, up to a normalization,  is the translationally invariant momentum eigenstate &lt;math&gt;|\varpi\rangle=\lim_{p\to 0} |p\rangle&lt;/math&gt; in the momentum representation, i.e.,  &lt;math&gt;\hat{p}|\varpi\rangle=0&lt;/math&gt;. Consequently, the corresponding wavefunction is a constant,   &lt;math&gt; \langle x|\varpi\rangle  \sqrt{2\pi \hbar}=1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;|x\rangle= \delta(\hat{x}-x) |\varpi\rangle  \sqrt{2\pi \hbar}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, when all matrix elements of an operator such as 
:&lt;math&gt; \langle x|   A |y\rangle   &lt;/math&gt;
are available,
this resolution serves to reconstitute the full operator,
:&lt;math&gt; \int dx dy ~~ |x\rangle \langle x|   A |y\rangle \langle y | =  A ~.   &lt;/math&gt;

== Notation used by mathematicians ==

The object physicists are considering when using bra–ket notation is a [[Hilbert space]] (a [[Complete metric space|complete]] [[inner product space]]).

Let {{math|{{mathcal|H}}}} be a Hilbert space and {{math|''h'' ∈ {{mathcal|H}}}} a vector in {{math|{{mathcal|H}}}}. What physicists would denote by {{math|{{ket|''h''}}}} is the vector itself. That is,

:&lt;math&gt; |h\rangle\in \mathcal{H} &lt;/math&gt;.

Let {{math|{{mathcal|H}}*}} be the [[dual space]] of {{math|{{mathcal|H}}}}. This is the space of linear functionals on {{math|{{mathcal|H}}}}. The isomorphism {{math|''Φ'' : {{mathcal|H}} → {{mathcal|H}}*}} is defined by {{math|''Φ''(''h'') {{=}} ''φ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, where for every {{math|''g'' ∈ {{mathcal|H}}}} we define
:&lt;math&gt; \phi_h(g) = \mbox{IP}(h,g) = (h,g) = \langle h,g \rangle = \langle h|g \rangle &lt;/math&gt;,
where {{math|IP(·,·)}}, {{math|(·,·)}}, {{math|{{angbr|·,·}}}} and {{math|{{bra-ket|·|·}}}} are just different notations for expressing an inner product between two elements in a Hilbert space (or for the first three, in any inner product space). Notational confusion arises when identifying {{math|''φ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''g''}} with {{math|{{bra|''h''}}}} and {{math|{{ket|''g''}}}} respectively. This is because of literal symbolic substitutions. Let {{math|''φ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''H'' {{=}} {{bra|''h''}}}} and let {{math|''g'' {{=}} G {{=}} {{ket|''g''}}}}. This gives

:&lt;math&gt; \phi_h(g) = H(g) = H(G)=\langle h|(G) = \langle h|\bigl(|g\rangle\bigr) \,. &lt;/math&gt;

One ignores the parentheses and removes the double bars. Some properties of this notation are convenient since we are dealing with linear operators and composition acts like a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] multiplication.

Moreover, mathematicians usually write the dual entity not at the first place, as the physicists do, but at the second one, and they usually use not an [[asterisk]] but an overline (which the physicists reserve for averages and the [[Dirac_equation#Conservation_of_probability_current|Dirac spinor adjoint]]) to denote [[complex conjugate]] numbers; i.e., for scalar products mathematicians usually write
:&lt;math&gt;(\phi ,\psi )=\int \phi (x)\cdot \overline{\psi(x)}\, \mathrm{d}x \,,&lt;/math&gt;
whereas physicists would write for the same quantity
:&lt;math&gt; \langle\psi |\phi \rangle=\int \mathrm{d}x\,\psi^*(x)\cdot\phi(x)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Anagram canonical svg.svg|thumb|Algorithmic [[anagram]] test using [[multiset]]s as canonical forms: The strings "&lt;tt&gt;madam curie&lt;/tt&gt;" and "&lt;tt&gt;radium came&lt;/tt&gt;" are given as [[C (programming language)|C]] arrays. Each one is converted into a canonical form by sorting. Since both sorted strings literally agree, the original strings were anagrams of each other.]]
In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], a '''canonical''', '''normal''', or '''standard'''  '''form''' of a [[mathematical object]] is a standard way of presenting that object as a [[mathematical expression]]. The distinction between "canonical" and "normal" forms varies by subfield. In most fields, a canonical form specifies a ''unique'' representation for every object, while a normal form simply specifies its form, without the requirement of uniqueness.

The canonical form of a [[positive integer]] in [[decimal representation]] is a finite sequence of digits that does not begin with zero.

More generally, for a class of objects on which an [[equivalence relation]] is defined, a '''canonical form''' consists in the choice of a specific object in each class. For example, [[Jordan normal form]] is a canonical form for [[matrix similarity]], and the [[row echelon form]] is a canonical form, when one considers as equivalent a matrix and its left product by an [[invertible matrix]].

In computer science, and more specifically in [[computer algebra]], when representing mathematical objects in a computer, there are usually many different ways to represent the same object. In this context, a '''canonical form''' is a representation such that every object has a unique representation. Thus, the equality of two objects can easily be tested by testing the equality of their canonical forms. However canonical forms frequently depend on arbitrary choices (like ordering the variables), and this introduces difficulties for testing the equality of two objects resulting on independent computations. Therefore, in computer algebra, ''normal form'' is a weaker notion: A '''normal form''' is a representation such that zero is uniquely represented. This allows testing for equality by putting the difference of two objects in normal form.

'''Canonical form''' can also mean a [[differential form]] that is defined in a natural (canonical) way.

In computer science, data that has more than one possible representation can often be canonicalized into a completely unique representation called its '''canonical form'''.  Putting something into canonical form is [[canonicalization]].&lt;ref&gt;The term 'canonization' is sometimes incorrectly used for this.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Suppose we have some set ''S'' of objects, with an [[equivalence relation]] ''R''. A '''canonical form''' is given by designating some objects of ''S'' to be "in canonical form", such that every object under consideration is equivalent to exactly one object in canonical form. In other words, the canonical forms in ''S'' represent the equivalence classes, once and only once. To test whether two objects are equivalent, it then suffices to test their canonical forms for equality.
A canonical form thus provides a [[classification theorem]] and more, in that it not just classifies every class, but gives a distinguished (canonical) representative.

Formally, a canonicalization with respect to an equivalence relation ''R'' on a set ''S'' is a mapping ''c'':''S''→''S'' such that for all ''s'', ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''S'':
# ''c''(''s'') = ''c''(''c''(''s'')) &amp;nbsp; ([[idempotence]]),
# ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''R'' ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if ''c''(''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''c''(''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;nbsp; (decisiveness), and 
# ''s'' ''R'' ''c''(''s'') &amp;nbsp; (representativeness). 
Property 3 is redundant, it follows by applying 2 to 1.

In practical terms, one wants to be able to recognize the canonical forms. There is also a practical, algorithmic question to consider: how to pass from a given object ''s'' in ''S'' to its canonical form ''s''*? Canonical forms are generally used to make operating with equivalence classes more effective. For example, in [[modular arithmetic]], the canonical form for a residue class is usually taken as the least non-negative integer in it. Operations on classes are carried out by combining these representatives and then reducing the result to its least non-negative residue.
The uniqueness requirement is sometimes relaxed, allowing the forms to be unique up to some finer equivalence relation, like allowing reordering of terms (if there is no natural ordering on terms).

A canonical form may simply be a convention, or a deep theorem.

For example, polynomials are conventionally written with the terms in descending powers: it is more usual to write ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x'' + 30 than ''x'' + 30 + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, although the two forms define the same polynomial. By contrast, the existence of [[Jordan canonical form]] for a matrix is a deep theorem.

==Examples==
Note: in this section, "[[up to]]" some equivalence relation E means that the canonical form is not unique in general, but that if one object has two different canonical forms, they are E-equivalent.

In the untyped lambda calculus, e.g., the term &lt;math&gt;(\lambda x.(x x) \; \lambda x.(x x))&lt;/math&gt; doesn't have a normal form. In the typed lambda calculus, every well-formed term can be rewritten to its normal form.

===Graph theory===
{{main article|Graph canonization}}
In [[graph theory]], a branch of mathematics, '''graph canonization''' is the problem finding a canonical form of a given graph ''G''. A canonical form is a [[Graph labeling|labeled graph]] Canon(''G'') that is [[graph isomorphism|isomorphic]] to ''G'', such that every graph that is isomorphic to ''G'' has the same canonical form as ''G''. Thus, from a solution to the graph canonization problem, one could also solve the problem of [[graph isomorphism]]: to test whether two graphs ''G'' and ''H'' are isomorphic, compute their canonical forms Canon(''G'') and Canon(''H''), and test whether these two canonical forms are identical.

===Differential forms===
Canonical [[differential form]]s include the [[canonical one-form]] and [[canonical symplectic form]], important in the study of [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] and [[symplectic manifold]]s.

=== Computing ===
In [[computing]], the reduction of data to any kind of canonical form is commonly called ''data normalization''.

For instance, [[database normalization]] is the process of organizing the [[Field (computer science)|fields]] and [[Table (database)|table]]s of a [[relational database]] to minimize [[Data redundancy|redundancy]] and dependency. 

In the field of [[software security]], a common [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]] is unchecked [[malicious input]]. The mitigation for this problem is proper [[input validation]]. Before input validation may be performed, the input must be normalized, i.e., eliminating encoding (for instance [[Character encodings in HTML|HTML encoding]]) and reducing the input data to a single common [[character set]].

Other forms of data, typically associated with [[signal processing]] (including [[Audio signal processing|audio]] and [[Image processing|imaging]]) or [[machine learning]], can be normalized in order to provide a limited range of values.

[[Image:pure screw.svg|thumb|A [[screw axis]].  Mozzi–Chasles' theorem says that every [[Euclidean motion]] is a [[screw displacement]] along some screw axis.]]In [[kinematics]], '''Chasles' theorem''', or '''Mozzi–Chasles' theorem''', says that the most general rigid body displacement can be produced by a [[translation (mathematics)|translation]] along a line (called its [[screw axis]] or Mozzi axis) followed (or preceded) by a [[rotation]] about an axis parallel to that line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Kumar | first=V. |title = MEAM 520 notes: The theorems of Euler and Chasles |url= http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~meam520/notes02/EulerChasles4.pdf | publisher= University of Pennsylvania | accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Heard | first=William B.| year=2006 | title=Rigid Body Mechanics | publisher=Wiley | page= 42 | isbn=3-527-40620-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The proof that a spatial displacement can be decomposed into a rotation and slide around and along a line is attributed to the astronomer and mathematician [[Giulio Mozzi]] (1763), in fact the screw axis is traditionally called '''asse di Mozzi''' in Italy. However, most textbooks refer to a subsequent similar work by [[Michel Chasles]] dating 1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Chasles | first=M. | year=1830 | title=Note sur les propriétés générales du système de deux corps semblables entr'eux | journal=Bulletin des Sciences Mathématiques, Astronomiques, Physiques et Chemiques | volume=14 | pages=321–326 | language=French | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ERcAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA321 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--date given in article is 5 Feb 1831--&gt; Several other scholars contemporaries of M. Chasles obtained the same or similar results around that time, including G. Giorgini, Cauchy, Poinsot, Poisson and Rodrigues.  An account of the 1763 proof by Giulio Mozzi and some of its history can be found here.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book | last=Mozzi | first=Giulio | year=1763 | title=Discorso matematico sopra il rotamento momentaneo dei corpi | publisher=Stamperia di Donato Campo | place=Napoli | url=https://archive.org/stream/discorsomatemat00mozzgoog#page/n5/mode/2up | language=Italian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ceccarelli  | first=Marco | year=2000 | title=Screw axis defined by Giulio Mozzi in 1763 and early studies on helicoidal motion | journal=Mechanism and Machine Theory | volume=35 | pages=761–770 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proof==
Mozzi considers a rigid body undergoing first a rotation about an axis passing through the center of mass and then a translation of displacement D in an arbitrary direction. Any rigid motion can be accomplished in this way due to a theorem by Euler on the existence of an axis of rotation. 
The displacement D of the center of mass can be decomposed into components parallel and perpendicular to the axis. The perpendicular (and parallel) component acts on all points of the rigid body but Mozzi shows that for some points the previous rotation acted exactly with an opposite displacement, so those points are translated parallel to the axis of rotation. These points lie on the Mozzi axis through which the rigid motion can be accomplished through a screw motion.

Another elementary proof of Mozzi–Chasles' theorem was given by [[E. T. Whittaker]] in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;[[E. T. Whittaker]] (1904) {{Google books|epH1hCB7N2MC|A Treatise on Analytical Dynamics of Particles and Rigid Bodies| page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suppose ''A'' is to be transformed into ''B''. Whittaker suggests that line ''AK'' be selected parallel to the axis of the given rotation, with ''K'' the foot of a perpendicular from ''B''. The appropriate screw displacement is about an axis parallel to ''AK'' such that ''K'' is moved to ''B''. The method corresponds to [[Euclidean plane isometry]] where a composition of rotation and translation can be replaced by rotation about an [[Euclidean plane isometry#Isometries in the complex plane|appropriate center]]. In Whittaker's terms, "A rotation about any axis is equivalent to a rotation through the same angle about any axis parallel to it, together with a simple translation in a direction perpendicular to the axis."

He puts on (the circular site) four (bricks) running eastwards 1; two behind running crosswise (from south to north), and two (such) in front. Now the four which he puts on running eastwards are the body; and as to there being four of these, it is because this body (of ours) consists, of four parts 2.

The new polyhedra are shown as maps on the surface of the cube so the topological changes are more apparent. Vertices are marked in all forms with circles.]]
In geometry, '''Conway polyhedron notation''', invented by [[John Horton Conway]] and promoted by [[George W. Hart]], is used to describe [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] based on a seed polyhedron modified by various prefix [[operation (mathematics)|operation]]s.&lt;ref name="SoT"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Horton Conway|author2=Heidi Burgiel|author3=Chaim Goodman-Strass| title=The Symmetries of Things|year=2008|isbn=978-1-56881-220-5|chapter= Chapter 21: Naming the Archimedean and Catalan polyhedra and Tilings}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{mathworld|id=ConwayPolyhedronNotation|title=Conway Polyhedron Notation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conway and Hart extended the idea of using operators, like [[Truncation (geometry)|truncation]] as defined by [[Kepler]], to build related polyhedra of the same symmetry. For example, ''tC'' represents a [[truncated cube]], and ''taC'', parsed as {{tmath|t(aC)}}, is a [[truncated cuboctahedron]]. The simplest operator [[Dual polyhedron|dual]] swaps vertex and face elements; e.g., a dual cube is an octahedron: ''dC''=''O''. Applied in a series, these operators allow many higher order polyhedra to be generated. Conway defined the operators ''abdegjkmost'', while Hart added ''r'' and ''p''.&lt;ref name="Hart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/conway_notation.html|author=George W. Hart|title=Conway Notation for Polyhedra|website=Virtual Polyhedra|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conway's basic operations are sufficient to generate the [[Archimedean solid|Archimedean]] and [[Catalan solid]]s from the Platonic solids. Some basic operations can be made as composites of others. Later implementations named further operators, sometimes referred to as "extended" operators.&lt;ref name="Antiprism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antiprism.com/programs/conway.html|author=Adrian Rossiter|title=conway - Conway Notation transformations|website=Antiprism Polyhedron Modelling Software}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levskaya"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://levskaya.github.io/polyhedronisme/|author=Anselm Levskaya|title=polyHédronisme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, it is difficult to predict the resulting appearance of the composite of two or more operations from a given seed polyhedron. For instance, ambo applied twice is the expand operation: ''aa'' = ''e'', while a truncation after ambo produces [[bevel]]: ''ta'' = ''b''. Many basic questions about Conway operators remain open, for instance, how many operators of a given "size" exist.&lt;ref name=Brinkmann&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2017|title=Goldberg, Fuller, Caspar, Klug and Coxeter and a general approach to local symmetry-preserving operations|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|volume=473|issue=2206|pages=20170267|arxiv=1705.02848|last1=Brinkmann|first1=G.|last2=Goetschalckx|first2=P.|last3=Schein|first3=S.|doi=10.1098/rspa.2017.0267|bibcode=2017RSPSA.47370267B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operators ==
In Conway's notation, operations on polyhedra are applied like functions, from right to left. For example, a [[cuboctahedron]] is an ''ambo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/conway_notation.html |title=Conway Notation for Polyhedra| website=Virtual Polyhedra| date=1998| first=George| last=Hart}} (See fourth row in table, "a = ambo".)&lt;/ref&gt; cube'', i.e. {{tmath|1=a(C) = aC}}, and a [[truncated cuboctahedron]] is {{tmath|1=t(a(C)) = t(aC) = taC}}. Repeated application of an operator can be denoted with an exponent: ''j&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' = ''o''. In general, Conway operators are not [[commutative]]. The resulting polyhedron has a fixed topology (vertices, edges, faces), while exact geometry is not specified: it can be thought of as one of many [[graph embedding|embeddings]] of a [[polyhedral graph]] on the sphere. Often the polyhedron is put into [[Canonical polyhedron|canonical form]].

Individual operators can be visualized in terms of "chambers", as below. Each white chamber is a rotated version of the others. For [[achiral]] operators, the red chambers are a reflection of the white chambers. Achiral and [[chiral]] operators are also called local symmetry-preserving operations (LSP) and local operations that preserve orientation-preserving symmetries (LOPSP), respectively, although the exact definition is a little more restrictive.&lt;ref name="Brinkmann" /&gt;

The relationship between the number of vertices, edges, and faces of the seed and the polyhedron created by the operations listed in this article can be expressed as a matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}_x&lt;/math&gt;. When ''x'' is the operator, &lt;math&gt;v,e,f&lt;/math&gt; are the vertices, edges, and faces of the seed (respectively), and &lt;math&gt;v',e',f'&lt;/math&gt; are the vertices, edges, and faces of the result, then 

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}_x \begin{bmatrix} v \\ e \\ f \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} v' \\ e' \\ f' \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

The matrix for the composition of two operators is just the product of the matrixes for the two operators. Distinct operators may have the same matrix, for example, ''p'' and ''l''. The edge count of the result is an integer multiple ''d'' of that of the seed: this is called the inflation rate, or the edge factor.&lt;ref name="Brinkmann" /&gt;

The simplest operators, the [[identity operator]] ''S'' and the [[Dual polyhedron|dual operator]] ''d'', have simple matrix forms:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}_S = \begin{bmatrix}
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
  0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
  \end{bmatrix} = \mathbf{I}_3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}_d = \begin{bmatrix}
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
  0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
  \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
Two dual operators cancel out; ''dd'' = ''S'', and the square of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}_d&lt;/math&gt; is the [[identity matrix]]. When applied to other operators, the dual operator corresponds to horizontal and vertical reflections of the matrix. Operators can be grouped into groups of four (or fewer if some forms are the same) by identifying the operators ''x'', ''xd'' (operator of dual), ''dx'' (dual of operator), and ''dxd'' (conjugate of operator). In this article, only the matrix for ''x'' is given, since the others are simple reflections.

Hart introduced the reflection operator ''r'', that gives the mirror image of the polyhedron.{{cn|date=October 2018 &lt;!--Hart 1998?--&gt;}} This is not strictly a LOPSP, since it does not preserve orientation (it reverses it). ''r'' has no effect on achiral seeds, and ''rr'' returns the original seed. An overline can be used to indicate the other chiral form of an operator, like {{overline|''s''}} = ''rsr''. ''r'' does not affect the matrix.

An operation is irreducible if it cannot be expressed as a composition of operators aside from ''d'' and ''r''. The majority of Conway's original operators are irreducible: the exceptions are ''e'', ''b'', ''o'', and ''m''.

Some open questions about Conway operators include:&lt;ref name="Brinkmann" /&gt;
* Are there two non-equivalent series of operations, not related by ''d'' or ''r'', that create the same polyhedron from the same seed?
* How many Conway operators exist for a given inflation rate?
* Can an algorithm be developed to generate all the Conway operators for a given inflation rate?
* Can an algorithm be developed to decompose a given polyhedron into a series of operations on a smaller seed?

== Original operations ==
Strictly, seed (''S''), needle (''n''), and zip (''z'') were not included by Conway, but they are related to original Conway operations by duality so are included here.

From here on, operations are visualized on cube seeds, drawn on the surface of that cube. Blue faces cross edges of the seed, and pink faces lie over vertices of the seed. There is some flexibility in the exact placement of vertices, especially with chiral operators.

== Seeds ==
Any polyhedron can serve as a seed, as long as the operations can be executed on it. Common seeds have been assigned a letter.
The [[Platonic solid]]s are represented by the first letter of their name ([[Tetrahedron|'''T'''etrahedron]], [[Octahedron|'''O'''ctahedron]], [[Cube|'''C'''ube]], [[Icosahedron|'''I'''cosahedron]], [[Dodecahedron|'''D'''odecahedron]]); the [[prism (geometry)|'''p'''rism]]s ('''P'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) for ''n''-gonal forms; [[antiprism|'''a'''ntiprisms]] ('''A'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;); [[Cupola (geometry)|c'''u'''polae]] ('''U'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;); [[anticupola]]e ('''V'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;); and [[pyramid (geometry)|p'''y'''ramid]]s ('''Y'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;). Any [[Johnson solid|'''J'''ohnson solid]] can be referenced as '''J'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, for ''n''=1..92.

All of the five regular polyhedra can be generated from prismatic generators with zero to two operators:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.mi.sanu.ac.rs/vismath/zefiro2008/__generation_of_icosahedron_by_5tetrahedra.htm|title=Generation of an icosahedron by the intersection of five tetrahedra: geometrical and crystallographic features of the intermediate polyhedra|author=Livio Zefiro|journal=Vismath|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{div col end}}

The regular Euclidean tilings can also be used as seeds:
* Q = Quadrille = [[Square tiling]]
* H = Hextille  = [[Hexagonal tiling]] = dΔ
* Δ = Deltille = [[Triangular tiling]] = dH

== Extended operations ==
These are operations created after Conway's original set. Note that many more operations exist than have been named; just because an operation is not here does not mean it does not exist (or is not an LSP or LOPSP). To simplify, only irreducible operators are 
included in this list: others can be created by composing operators together.

==Indexed extended operations==
A number of operators can be grouped together by some criteria, or have their behavior modified by an index.&lt;ref name="Antiprism" /&gt; These are written as an operator with a subscript: ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''.

===Augmentation===
[[Augmentation (geometry)|Augmentation]] operations retain original edges. They may be applied to any independent subset of faces, or may be converted into a ''join''-form by removing the original edges. Conway notation supports an optional index to these operators: 0 for the join-form, or 3 or higher for how many sides affected faces have. For example, ''k''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''Y''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;=O: taking a square-based pyramid and gluing another pyramid to the square base gives an octahedron.

The truncate operator ''t'' also has an index form ''t&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', indicating that only vertices of a certain degree are truncated. It is equivalent to ''dk&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;d''.

Some of the extended operators can be created in special cases with ''k&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''t&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' operators. For example, a [[chamfered cube]], ''cC'', can be constructed as ''t''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''daC'', as a [[rhombic dodecahedron]], ''daC'' or ''jC'', with its degree-4 vertices truncated. A lofted cube, ''lC'' is the same as ''t''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''kC''. A quinto-dodecahedron, ''qD'' can be constructed as ''t''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;''daaD'' or ''t''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;''deD'' or ''t''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;''oD'', a [[deltoidal hexecontahedron]], ''deD'' or ''oD'', with its degree-5 vertices truncated.

===Meta/Bevel===
Meta adds vertices at the center and along the edges, while bevel adds faces at the center, seed vertices, and along the edges. The index is how many vertices or faces are added along the edges. Meta (in its non-indexed form) is also called [[cantitruncation]] or [[omnitruncation]]. Note that 0 here does not mean the same as for augmentation operations: it means zero vertices (or faces) are added along the edges.&lt;ref name="Antiprism" /&gt;

This construction can be extended to any face by identifying the chambers of the triangle or square (the "master polygon").&lt;ref name="Brinkmann" /&gt; Operators in the triangular family can be used to produce the [[Goldberg polyhedra]] and [[geodesic polyhedra]]: see [[List of geodesic polyhedra and Goldberg polyhedra]] for formulas.

The two families are the triangular GC family, ''c&lt;sub&gt;a,b&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''u&lt;sub&gt;a,b&lt;/sub&gt;'', and the quadrilateral GC family, ''e&lt;sub&gt;a,b&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''o&lt;sub&gt;a,b&lt;/sub&gt;''. Both the GC families are indexed by two integers &lt;math&gt;a \ge 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;. They possess many nice qualities:
* The indexes of the families have a relationship with certain [[Euclidean domain]]s over the complex numbers: the [[Eisenstein integers]] for the triangular GC family, and the [[Gaussian integers]] for the quadrilateral GC family.
* Operators in the ''x'' and ''dxd'' columns within the same family commute with each other.

The operators are divided into three classes (examples are written in terms of ''c'' but apply to all 4 operators):
* Class I: {{tmath|1=b=0}}. Achiral, preserves original edges. Can be written with the zero index suppressed, e.g. ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''a'',0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''c&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''.
* Class II: {{tmath|1=a=b}}. Also achiral. Can be decomposed as ''c&lt;sub&gt;a,a&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''c&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;c''&lt;sub&gt;1,1&lt;/sub&gt;
* Class III: All other operators. These are chiral, and ''c&lt;sub&gt;a,b&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''c&lt;sub&gt;b,a&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the chiral pairs of each other.

Of the original Conway operations, the only ones that do not fall into the GC family are ''g'' and ''s'' (gyro and snub). Meta and bevel (''m'' and ''b'') can be expressed in terms of one operator from the triangular family and one from the quadrilateral family.

===Archimedean and Catalan solids===
Conway's original set of operators can create all of the [[Archimedean solids]] and [[Catalan solids]], using the [[Platonic solids]] as seeds. (Note that the ''r'' operator is not necessary to create both chiral forms.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="964">'''Echo removal''' is the process of removing [[echo]] and [[reverberation]] artifacts from audio signals. The reverberation is typically modeled as the [[convolution]] of a (sometimes time-varying) [[impulse response]] with a hypothetical clean input signal, where both the clean input signal (which is to be recovered) and the impulse response are unknown. This is an example of an [[inverse problem]]. In almost all cases, there is insufficient information in the input signal to uniquely determine a plausible original image, making it an [[ill-posed problem]]. This is generally solved by the use of a [[regularization (physics)|regularization]] term to attempt to eliminate implausible solutions.

This problem is analogous to [[deblurring]] in the image processing domain.

The '''hekat''' or '''heqat''' (transcribed ''HqA.t'') was an [[ancient Egyptian weights and measures|ancient Egyptian volume unit]] used to measure grain, bread, and beer. 
It equals 4.8&amp;nbsp;[[litre]]s in today's measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-06/afot-ajh060412.php|title=Ancient jugs hold the secret to practical mathematics in Biblical times|website=EurekAlert!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Until the New Kingdom (NK), the hekat was one tenth of a khar, later one sixteenth; while the New Kingdom ''oipe'' (transcribed ''ip.t'') contained 4&amp;nbsp;hekat. It was sub-divided into other units &amp;ndash; some for  medical prescriptions &amp;ndash; the   ''hin'' (1/10), ''dja'' (1/64) and ''ro'' (1/320). The ''dja'' was recently evaluated by Tanja Pommerening in 2002 to 1/64 of a hekat (75 cc) in the MK, and 1/64 of an oipe (1/16 of a hekat, or 300 cc) in the NK, meaning that the ''dja'' was denoted by Horus-Eye imagery. It has been suggested by Pommerening that the NK change came about related to the oipe replacing the hekat as the Pharaonic volume control unit in official lists.

Hana Vymazalova evaluated the hekat unit in 2002 within the [[Akhmim Wooden Tablet]] by showing that five answers were returned to (64/64) when multiplied by the divisors 3, 7, 10, 11 and 13. The [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus|RMP]] also divided a hekat unity (64/64) by prime and composite numbers ''n'' when 1/64&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;64. The binary quotient used [[Eye of Horus#In arithmetic|Eye of Horus]] numbers. The remainder scaled [[Egyptian fraction]]s to 1/320 units named ro. Quotients and unscaled remainders were obtained for the dja, ro and other units when the divisor ''n'' was greater than 64. For example, one the 1/320&amp;nbsp;ro unit was written by Ahmes by solving 320/n&amp;nbsp;ro. Gillings cites 29 examples of two-part statements converted to one-part statements in RMP 82. Ahmes recorded the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 case by showing (64/64)/3&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;21/64&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1/192 (a modern statement) as written as(16&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)/64&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5/3&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;1/320 =&amp;nbsp;1/4&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1/16&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1/64&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;2/3ro (two-part ancient statement). Two-part statements were also converted by Ahmes to an unscaled hin unit by writing&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;1/3&amp;nbsp;hin.

The hekat measurement unit, and its [[double entry accounting system]], was found beyond the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]]. Another text was the [[Ebers Papyrus]], the best known medical text. The hekat unit was defined, in terms of its volume size, in the [[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus]] by MMP #10, by approximating ''[[&amp;pi;]]'' to around 3.16. The approximation of ''&amp;pi;'' was achieved by squaring a circle, increasingly (i.e. for the denominator in terms of setats: 9, 18, 36, 72, and 81, Gillings, page 141) until the vulgar fraction 256/81 was reached, the only relationship that was used in the Egyptian Middle Kingdom. The MMP scribe found the surface area of a basket equal to: (8d/9)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; =&amp;nbsp;64d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/81, within a cylinder relationship to the hekat. MMP 10 data meant that ''d''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 defined ''&amp;pi;'' for use in hekat volumes as&amp;nbsp;256/81. The 256/81 approximation was also used by [[Ahmes]] and other scribes. The [[ancient Egyptian weights and measures]] discussion further shows that the hekat was 1/30 of a royal cubit&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, an analysis that needs to double checked, against the ''d''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 suggestion, which means that ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, a suggestion that does make sense. One royal cubit of the [[Ancient Egyptian weights and measures]] =&amp;nbsp;523.5&amp;nbsp;millimeters. ((523.5&amp;nbsp;mm)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;30 =&amp;nbsp;4.78221176&amp;nbsp;liters.

Something that is '''impredicative''', in [[mathematics]], [[logic]] and [[philosophy of mathematics]], is a [[self reference|self-referencing]] [[definition]]. Roughly speaking, a definition is impredicative if it invokes (mentions or quantifies over) the set being defined, or (more commonly) another set that contains the thing being defined. There is no generally accepted precise definition of what it means to be predicative or impredicative. Authors have given different but related definitions.

The opposite of impredicativity is predicativity, which essentially entails building [[Stratification (mathematics)|stratified]] (or ramified) theories where quantification over lower levels results in variables of some new type, distinguished from the lower types that the variable ranges over. A prototypical example is [[intuitionistic type theory]], which retains ramification so as to discard impredicativity.

[[Russell's paradox]] is a famous example of an impredicative construction—namely the set of all sets that do not contain themselves. The [[paradox]] is that such a set cannot exist: If it would exist, the question could be  asked whether it contains itself or not — if it does then by definition it should not, and if it does not then by definition it should.

The [[greatest lower bound]] of a set {{math|{{var|X}}}}, {{math|glb({{var|X}})}}, also has an impredicative definition: {{math|1={{var|y}} = glb({{var|X}})}} if and only if for all elements {{math|{{var|x}}}} of {{math|{{var|X}}}}, {{math|{{var|y}}}} is less than or equal to {{math|{{var|x}}}}, and any {{math|{{var|z}}}} less than or equal to all elements of {{math|{{var|X}}}} is less than or equal to {{math|{{var|y}}}}. This definition quantifies over the set (potentially [[infinite set|infinite]], depending on the order in question) whose members are the lower bounds of {{math|{{var|X}}}}, one of which being the glb itself. Hence '''predicativism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; would reject this definition.&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:42–43&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

The terms "predicative" and "impredicative" were introduced by {{harvtxt|Russell|1907}}, though the meaning has changed a little since then. 

[[Solomon Feferman]] provides a historical review of predicativity, connecting it to current outstanding research problems.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon Feferman, "[https://math.stanford.edu/~feferman/papers/predicativity.pdf Predicativity]" (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[vicious circle principle]] was suggested by [[Henri Poincaré]] (1905-6, 1908)&lt;ref&gt;dates derived from Kleene 1952:42&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bertrand Russell]] in the wake of the paradoxes as a requirement on legitimate set specifications. Sets that do not meet the requirement are called ''impredicative''.

The first modern paradox appeared with [[Cesare Burali-Forti]]'s 1897 ''A question on transfinite numbers''&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort's commentary before Burali-Forti's (1897) ''A question on transfinite numbers'' in van Heijenoort 1967:104; see also his commentary before Georg Cantor's (1899) ''Letter to Dedekind'' in van Heijenoort 1967:113&lt;/ref&gt; and would become known as the [[Burali-Forti paradox]]. Cantor had apparently discovered the same paradox in his (Cantor's) "naive" set theory and this become known as [[Cantor's paradox]]. Russell's awareness of the problem originated in June 1901&lt;ref&gt;Commentary by van Heijenoort before Bertrand Russell's ''Lettern to Frege'' in van Heijenoort 1967:124&lt;/ref&gt; with his reading of [[Frege]]'s treatise of mathematical logic, his 1879 ''[[Begriffsschrift]]''; the offending sentence in Frege is the following:
{{quote|On the other hand, it may be also be that the argument is determinate and the function indeterminate.&lt;ref&gt;Gottlob Frege (1879) ''Begriffsschrift'' in van Heijenoort 1967:23&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In other words, given {{math|{{var|f}}({{var|a}})}} the function {{math|{{var|f}}}} is the variable and {{math|{{var|a}}}} is the invariant part. So why not substitute the value {{math|{{var|f}}({{var|a}})}} for {{math|{{var|f}}}} itself? Russell promptly wrote Frege a letter pointing out that:
{{quote|You state ... that a function too, can act as the indeterminate element. This I formerly believed, but now this view seems doubtful to me because of the following contradiction. Let {{math|{{var|w}}}} be the predicate: to be a predicate that cannot be predicated of itself. Can {{math|{{var|w}}}} be predicated of itself? From each answer its opposite follows. There we must conclude that {{math|{{var|w}}}} is not a predicate. Likewise, there is no class (as a totality) of those classes which each taken as a totality, do not belong to themselves. From this I conclude that under certain circumstances a definable collection does not form a totality.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell's 1902 ''Letter to Frege'' in van Heijenoort 1967:124-125&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Frege promptly wrote back to Russell acknowledging the problem:
{{quote|Your discovery of the contradiction caused me the greatest surprise and, I would almost say, consternation, since it has shaken the basis on which I intended to build arithmetic.&lt;ref&gt;Gottlob Frege's (1902) ''Letter to Russell'' in van Hiejenoort 1967:127&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While the problem had adverse personal consequences for both men (both had works at the printers that had to be emended), van Heijenoort observes that "The paradox shook the logicians' world, and the rumbles are still felt today. ... Russell's paradox, which uses the bare notions of set and element, falls squarely in the field of logic. The paradox was first published by Russell in ''The principles of mathematics'' (1903) and is discussed there in great detail ...".&lt;ref&gt;Van Heijenoort's commentary before Bertrand Russell's (1902) ''Letter to Frege'' 1967:124&lt;/ref&gt; Russell, after six years of false starts, would eventually answer the matter with his 1908 theory of types by "propounding his ''[[axiom of reducibility]]''. It says that any function is coextensive with what he calls a ''predicative'' function: a function in which the types of apparent variables run no higher than the types of the arguments".&lt;ref&gt;Willard V. Quine's commentary before Bertrand Russell's 1908 ''Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types''&lt;/ref&gt; But this "axiom" was met with resistance from all quarters.

The rejection of impredicatively defined mathematical objects (while accepting the [[natural number]]s as classically understood) leads to the position in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] known as predicativism, advocated by [[Henri Poincaré]] and [[Hermann Weyl]] in his ''Das Kontinuum''. Poincaré and Weyl argued that impredicative definitions are problematic only when one or more underlying sets are infinite.

[[Ernst Zermelo]] in his 1908 "A new proof of the possibility of a well-ordering"{{full citation needed|date=October 2016}} presents an entire section "b. ''Objection concerning nonpredicative definition''" where he argued against "Poincaré (1906, p.&amp;nbsp;307) [who states that] a definition is 'predicative' and logically admissible only if it ''excludes'' all objects that are dependent upon the notion defined, that is, that can in any way be determined by it".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:190&lt;/ref&gt; He gives two examples of impredicative definitions &amp;ndash; (i) the notion of [[Dedekind chain]]s and (ii) "in analysis wherever the maximum or minimum of a previously defined "completed" set of numbers {{math|{{var|Z}}}} is used for further inferences. This happens, for example, in the well-known Cauchy proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra, and up to now it has not occurred to anyone to regard this as something illogical".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:190–191&lt;/ref&gt; He ends his section with the following observation: "A definition may very well rely upon notions that are equivalent to the one being defined; indeed, in every definition ''definiens'' and ''definiendum'' are equivalent notions, and the strict observance of Poincaré's demand would make every definition, hence all of science, impossible".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:191&lt;/ref&gt;

Zermelo's example of minimum and maximum of a previously defined "completed" set of numbers reappears in Kleene 1952:42-42 where Kleene uses the example of [[Least upper bound]] in his discussion of impredicative definitions; Kleene does not resolve this problem. In the next paragraphs he discusses Weyl's attempt in his 1918 ''Das Kontinuum'' (''The Continuum'') to eliminate impredicative definitions and his failure to retain the "theorem that an arbitrary non-empty set {{math|M}} of real numbers having an upper bound has a least upper bound (cf. also Weyl 1919)".&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:43&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank P. Ramsey|Ramsey]] argued that "impredicative" definitions can be harmless: for instance, the definition of "tallest person in the room" is impredicative, since it depends on a set of things of which it is an element, namely the set of all persons in the room. Concerning mathematics, an example of an impredicative definition is the smallest number in a set, which is formally defined as: {{math|1={{var|y}} = min({{var|X}})}} if and only if for all elements {{math|{{var|x}}}} of {{math|{{var|X}}}}, {{math|{{var|y}}}} is less than or equal to {{math|{{var|x}}}}, and {{math|{{var|y}}}} is in {{math|{{var|X}}}}.

Burgess (2005) discusses predicative and impredicative theories at some length, in the context of [[Frege]]'s logic, [[Peano arithmetic]], [[second order arithmetic]], and [[axiomatic set theory]].

(ibid). Weyl in his 1918 ("Das Kontinuum") attempted to derive as much of analysis as was possible without the use of impredicative definitions, "but not the theorem that an arbitrary non-empty set M of real numbers having an upper bound has a least upper bound (CF. also Weyl 1919)" (p.&amp;nbsp;43).

In [[mathematics]], an '''index set''' is a set whose members label (or index) members of another set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weisstein|first=Eric|title=Index Set|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/IndexSet.html|work=Wolfram MathWorld|publisher=Wolfram Research|accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Munkres|first=James R.|title=Topology|volume= 2|location=Upper Saddle River|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, if the elements of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''A'' may be ''indexed'' or ''labeled'' by means of the elements of a set ''J'', then ''J'' is an index set.  The indexing consists of a [[surjective function]] from ''J'' onto ''A'' and the indexed collection is typically called an ''[[indexed family|(indexed) family]]'', often written as {''A''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''j''∈''J''&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Examples==

*An [[enumeration]] of a set {{math|''S''}} gives an index set &lt;math&gt;J \sub \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, where {{math|''f'' : ''J'' → ''S''}} is the particular enumeration of {{math|''S''}}.
*Any [[countably infinite]] set can be indexed by the set of [[natural numbers]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.
*For &lt;math&gt;r \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[indicator function]] on {{math|''r''}} is the function &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_r\colon \mathbb{R} \rarr \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt; given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_r (x) := \begin{cases} 0, &amp; \mbox{if }  x \ne r  \\ 1,  &amp; \mbox{if } x = r. \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

The set of all the &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{1}_r&lt;/math&gt; functions &lt;!--(which happens to be a [[basis]] for the [[vector space]] of all functions on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;)--&gt; is an [[uncountable set]] indexed by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Other uses==
In [[computational complexity theory]] and [[cryptography]], an index set is a set for which there exists an algorithm &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; that can sample the set efficiently; e.g., on input &lt;math&gt;1^n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; can efficiently select a poly(n)-bit long element from the set.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Endlessly interlaced pentagons and some translations.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|A [[Wallpaper group|wallpaper]] is '''invariant''' under an infinite number of&amp;nbsp;[[Translation (geometry)|translations]], members of a [[Group (mathematics)|group]], of which the [[Binary operation|operation]] denoted by &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; is the [[function composition]].]]
In [[mathematics]], an '''invariant''' is a property, held by a class of mathematical objects, which remains unchanged when [[Transformation (function)|transformations]] of a certain type are applied to the objects. The particular class of objects and type of transformations are usually indicated by the context in which the term is used. For example, the area of a triangle is an invariant with respect to [[isometry|isometries]] of the Euclidean plane. The phrases "invariant under" and "invariant to" a transformation are both used. More generally, an invariant with respect to an [[equivalence relation]] is a property that is constant on each equivalence class. 

Invariants are used in diverse areas of mathematics such as [[geometry]], [[topology]], [[algebra]] and [[discrete mathematics]]. Some important classes of transformations are defined by an invariant they leave unchanged, for example [[conformal map]]s are defined as transformations of the plane that preserve angles. The discovery of invariants is an important step in the process of classifying mathematical objects.

== Examples ==
A simple example of invariance is expressed in our ability to [[counting|count]]. For a [[finite set]] of objects of any kind, there is a number to which we always arrive, regardless of the [[total order|order]] in which we count the objects in the set. The quantity&amp;mdash;a [[cardinal number]]&amp;mdash;is associated with the set, and is invariant under the process of counting.

An [[List of mathematical identities|identity]] is an equation that remains true for all values of its variables. There are also [[List of inequalities|inequalities]] that remain true when the values of their variables change.

The [[distance]] between two points on a [[number line]] is not changed by [[addition|adding]] the same quantity to both numbers. On the other hand, [[multiplication]] does not have this same property as addition, so distance is not invariant under multiplication.

[[Angle]]s and [[ratio]]s of distances are invariant under [[Scaling (geometry)|scalings]], [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]s, [[Translation (geometry)|translation]]s and [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]s. These transformations produce [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] shapes, which is the basis of [[trigonometry]]. In contrast, angles and ratios are not invariant under non-uniform scaling (such as stretching). The sum of a triangle's interior angles (180°) is invariant under all the above operations.  As another example, all circles are similar: they can be transformed into each other and the ratio of the [[circumference]] to the [[diameter]] is invariant (denoted by the Greek letter [[pi]]).

Some more complicated examples:
* The [[real part]] and the [[absolute value]] of a [[complex number]] are invariant under [[complex conjugation]].
* The degree of a polynomial is invariant under linear change of variables.
* The dimension and homology groups of a topological object are invariant under [[homeomorphism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Fraleigh|1976|pp=166–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The number of [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]] of a [[dynamical system]] is invariant under many mathematical operations.
* Euclidean distance is invariant under [[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal transformations]].
* Euclidean [[area]] is invariant under a [[linear map]] with [[determinant]] 1 (see [[2 × 2 real matrices#Equi-areal mapping|Equi-areal maps]]).
* Some invariants of [[projective transformation]]s:  [[collinearity]] of three or more points, [[concurrent lines|concurrency]] of three or more lines, [[conic section]]s, the [[cross-ratio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kay|1969|pp=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[determinant]], [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]], and [[eigenvectors]] and [[eigenvalues]] of a square matrix are invariant under changes of basis. In a word, the [[spectrum of a matrix]] is invariant to the change of basis.
* [[Invariants of tensors]].
* The [[singular-value decomposition|singular values]] of a matrix are invariant under orthogonal transformations.
* [[Lebesgue measure]] is invariant under translations.
* The [[variance]] of a [[probability distribution]] is invariant under translations of the [[real number|real]] line; hence the variance of a [[random variable]] is unchanged by the addition of a constant to it.
* The [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]] of a transformation are the elements in the domain invariant under the transformation. They may, depending on the application, be called [[symmetry|symmetric]] with respect to that transformation. For example, objects with [[translational symmetry]] are invariant under certain translations.
*The integral &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\int_M K\,d\mu}&lt;/math&gt; of the Gaussian curvature ''K'' of a 2-dimensional Riemannian manifold (''M'',''g'') is invariant under changes of the [[Riemannian metric]] ''g''.  This is the [[Gauss–Bonnet theorem]].

===MU puzzle===
The [[MU puzzle]]&lt;ref&gt;

Here: Chapter I.&lt;/ref&gt; is a good example of a logical problem where determining an invariant is of use for an [[impossibility proof]]. 
The puzzle asks one to start with the word MI and transform it into the word MU using in each step one of the following transformation rules:

# If a string ends with an I, a U may be appended (''x''I → ''x''IU)
# The string after the M may be completely duplicated (M''x'' → M''xx'')
# Any three consecutive I's (III) may be replaced with a single U (''x''III''y'' → ''x''U''y'')
# Any two consecutive U's may be removed (''x''UU''y'' → ''xy'')

An example derivation (superscripts indicating the applied rules) is
:MI →&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; MII →&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; MIIII →&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; MUI →&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; MUIUI →&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; MUIUIU →&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; MUIUIUUIUIU →&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; MUIUIIUIU → ...

Is it possible to convert MI into MU using these four transformation rules only?

One could spend many hours applying these transformation rules to strings. However, it might be quicker to find a [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|property]] that is invariant to all rules (i.e. that isn't changed by any of them), and demonstrates that getting to MU is impossible. Logically looking at the puzzle, the only way to get rid of any I's is to have three consecutive I's in the string. This makes the following invariant interesting to consider: 

:''The number of I's in the string is not a multiple of 3''.

This is an invariant to the problem if for each of the transformation rules the following holds: if the invariant held before applying the rule, it will also hold after applying it. If we look at the net effect of applying the rules on the number of I's and U's we can see this actually is the case for all rules:

| style="text-align: center;" |  4 || style="text-align: right;" | +0 || style="text-align: right;" | −2 || Number of I's is unchanged. If the invariant held, it still does.
|}

The table above shows clearly that the invariant holds for each of the possible transformation rules, which basically means that whichever rule we pick, at whatever state, if the number of I's was not a multiple of three before applying the rule, it won't be afterwards either.

Given that there is a single I in the starting string MI, and one is not a multiple of three, it's impossible to go from MI to MU as zero is a multiple of three.

==Invariant set==

A subset ''S'' of the domain ''U'' of a mapping ''T'': ''U'' → ''U''  is an '''invariant set''' under the mapping when &lt;math&gt;x \in S \Rightarrow T(x) \in S.&lt;/math&gt; Note that the [[element (mathematics)|elements]] of ''S'' are not [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed]], but rather the set ''S'' is fixed in the [[power set]] of ''U''. (Some authors use the terminology ''setwise invariant''&lt;ref name="Simon"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barry Simon|title=Representations of Finite and Compact Groups|publisher=American Mathematical Soc.|isbn=978-0-8218-7196-6|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; vs. ''pointwise invariant''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Judith Cederberg|title=A Course in Modern Geometries|year=1989|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4757-3831-5|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish between these cases.)
For example, a [[circle]] is an invariant subset of the plane under a [[rotation]] about the circle’s center. Further, a [[conical surface]] is invariant as a set under a [[Homothetic transformation|homothety]] of space.

An invariant set of an operation ''T'' is also said to be '''stable under''' ''T''. For example, the [[normal subgroup]]s that are so important in [[group theory]] are those [[subgroup]]s that are stable under the [[inner automorphism]]s of the ambient group.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Fraleigh|1976|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Herstein|1964|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|McCoy|1968|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other examples occur in [[linear algebra]]. Suppose a [[linear transformation]] ''T'' has an [[eigenvector]] '''v'''. Then the line through 0 and '''v''' is an invariant set under ''T''. The eigenvectors span an [[invariant subspace]] which is stable under ''T''.

When ''T'' is a [[screw displacement]], the [[screw axis]] is an invariant line, though if the [[pitch (screw)|pitch]] is non-zero, ''T'' has no fixed points.

== Formal statement ==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2010}}
The notion of invariance is formalized in three different ways in mathematics: via [[group action]]s, presentations, and deformation.

=== Unchanged under group action ===
Firstly, if one has a group ''G'' acting on a mathematical object (or set of objects) ''X,'' then one may ask which points ''x'' are unchanged, "invariant" under the group action, or under an element ''g'' of the group.

Very frequently one will have a group acting on a set ''X'' and ask which objects in an ''associated'' set ''F''(''X'') are invariant. For example, rotation in the plane about a point leaves the point about which it rotates invariant, while translation in the plane does not leave any points invariant, but does leave all lines parallel to the direction of translation invariant as lines. Formally, define the set of lines in the plane ''P'' as ''L''(''P''); then a rigid motion of the plane takes lines to lines – the group of rigid motions acts on the set of lines – and one may ask which lines are unchanged by an action.

More importantly, one may define a ''function'' on a set, such as "radius of a circle in the plane" and then ask if this function is invariant under a group action, such as rigid motions.

Dual to the notion of invariants are ''[[coinvariant]]s,'' also known as ''orbits,'' which formalizes the notion of [[congruence relation|congruence]]: objects which can be taken to each other by a group action. For example, under the group of rigid motions of the plane, the perimeter of a triangle is an invariant, while the set of triangles congruent to a given triangle is a coinvariant.

These are connected as follows: invariants are constant on coinvariants (for example, congruent triangles have the same perimeter), while two objects which agree in the value of one invariant may or may not be congruent (two triangles with the same perimeter need not be congruent). In [[classification problem (mathematics)|classification problem]]s, one seeks to find a [[complete set of invariants]], such that if two objects have the same values for this set of invariants, they are congruent.

For example, triangles such that all three sides are equal are congruent under rigid motions, via [[Congruence (geometry)#Congruence of triangles|SSS congruence]], and thus the lengths of all three sides form a complete set of invariants for triangles. The three angle measures of a triangle are also invariant under rigid motions, but do not form a complete set as incongruent triangles can share the same angle measures. However, if one allows scaling in addition to rigid motions, then the [[Similarity (geometry)#Similar triangles|AAA similarity criterion]] shows that this is a complete set of invariants.

=== Independent of presentation ===
Secondly, a function may be defined in terms of some presentation or decomposition of a mathematical object; for instance, the [[Euler characteristic]] of a [[cell complex]] is defined as the alternating sum of the number of cells in each dimension. One may forget the cell complex structure and look only at the underlying topological space (the manifold) – as different cell complexes give the same underlying manifold, one may ask if the function is ''independent'' of choice of ''presentation,'' in which case it is an ''intrinsically'' defined invariant. This is the case for the Euler characteristic, and a general method for defining and computing invariants is to define them for a given presentation and then show that they are independent of the choice of presentation. Note that there is no notion of a group action in this sense.

The most common examples are:
* The [[Differentiable manifold#Definition|presentation of a manifold]] in terms of coordinate charts – invariants must be unchanged under [[change of coordinates]].
* Various [[manifold decomposition]]s, as discussed for Euler characteristic.
* Invariants of a [[presentation of a group]].

=== Unchanged under perturbation ===
Thirdly, if one is studying an object which varies in a family, as is common in [[algebraic geometry]] and [[differential geometry]], one may ask if the property is unchanged under perturbation – if an object is constant on families or invariant under change of metric, for instance.

==Invariants in computer science==
{{For|other uses of the word "invariant" in computer science|invariant (disambiguation)}}
In [[computer science]], one can encounter invariants that can be relied upon to be true during the execution of a program, or during some portion of it. It is a [[logical assertion]] that is always held to be true during a certain phase of execution. For example, a [[loop invariant]] is a condition that is true at the beginning and end of every execution of a loop.

Invariants are especially useful when reasoning about whether a computer program is correct. The theory of [[optimizing compiler]]s, the methodology of [[design by contract]], and [[formal methods]] for determining [[program correctness]], all rely heavily on invariants.

Programmers often use [[Assertion (computing)|assertions]] in their code to make invariants explicit. Some [[object oriented]] [[programming language]]s have a special syntax for specifying [[class invariant]]s.
===Automatic invariant detection in imperative programs===

[[Abstract interpretation]] tools can compute simple invariants of given imperative computer programs. The kind of properties that can be found depend on the [[Abstract_interpretation#Examples_of_abstract_domains|abstract domains]] used. Typical example properties are single integer variable ranges like &lt;code&gt;0&lt;=x&lt;1024&lt;/code&gt;, relations between several variables like &lt;code&gt;0&lt;=i-j&lt;2*n-1&lt;/code&gt;, and modulus information like &lt;code&gt;y%4==0&lt;/code&gt;. Academic research prototypes also consider simple properties of pointer structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first1=A.|last1=Bouajjani|first2=C.|last2=Drǎgoi|first3=C.|last3=Enea|first4=A.|last4=Rezine|first5=M.|last5=Sighireanu|title=Invariant Synthesis for Programs Manipulating Lists with Unbounded Data|booktitle=Proc. CAV|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More sophisticated invariants generally have to be provided manually.
In particular, when verifying an imperative program using [[Hoare logic|the Hoare calculus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; a loop invariant has to be provided manually for each loop in the program, which is one of the reasons this is generally impractical for most programs.

In the context of the above [[MU puzzle]] example, there is currently no general automated tool that can detect that a derivation, "MI →...→ MU", is impossible only from rules 1-4. However, once the abstraction from the string to the number of its "I"s has been made by hand, leading e.g. to the following C program, an abstract interpretation tool will be able to detect that &lt;code&gt;ICount%3&lt;/code&gt; can't be 0 and hence the "while"-loop will never terminate.

&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
void MUPuzzle(void) {
    volatile int RandomRule;
    int ICount=1, UCount=0;
    while (ICount%3!=0)                            // non-terminating loop
        switch(RandomRule) {
        case 1:                UCount+=1;   break;
        case 2:   ICount*=2;   UCount*=2;   break;
        case 3:   ICount-=3;   UCount+=1;   break;
        case 4:                UCount-=2;   break;
        }                                          // computed invariant: ICount%3==1||ICount%3==2
}
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Inverse problem|Inverse modeling]] is a mathematical technique where the objective is to determine the physical properties of the subsurface of an earth region that has produced a given [[seismogram]]. Cooke and Schneider (1983)&lt;ref name="Cook1983"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cooke|first=D. A.|author2=Schneider W. A. |title=Generalized linear inversion of reflection seismic data|journal=Geophysics|date=June 1983|volume=48|issue=6|pages=665–676|doi=10.1190/1.1441497}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined it as calculation of the earth’s structure and physical [[parameters]] from some set of observed [[seismic]] data. The underlying assumption in this method is that the collected seismic data are from an earth structure that matches the cross-section computed from the inversion [[algorithm]].&lt;ref name="Pica1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pica|first=A.|author2=Diet J. P. |author3=Tarantola A. |title=Nonlinear inversion of seismic reflection data in a laterally invariant medium|journal=Geophysics|date=March 1990|volume=55|issue=3|pages=284–292|doi=10.1190/1.1442836}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some common earth properties that are inverted for include acoustic velocity, [[Formation (stratigraphy)|formation]] and fluid [[Density|densities]], [[acoustic impedance]], [[Poisson's ratio]], formation compressibility, shear rigidity, [[porosity]], and fluid saturation.

The method has long been useful for geophysicists and can be categorized into two broad types:&lt;ref name="Earthworks"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Francis|first=A.M.|title=Understanding Stochastic and Seismic Inversion|journal=First Break|date=November 2006|volume=24|issue=11|doi=10.3997/1365-2397.2006026}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deterministic algorithm|Deterministic]] and [[stochastic]] inversion. Deterministic inversion methods are based on comparison of the output from an earth model with the observed field data and continuously updating the earth model parameters to minimize a function, which is usually some form of difference between model output and field observation. As such, this method of inversion to which linear inversion falls under is posed as an minimization problem and the accepted earth model is the set of model parameters that minimizes the [[objective function]] in producing a numerical seismogram which best compares with collected field seismic data.

On the other hand, stochastic inversion methods are used to generate constrained models as used in [[reservoir]] flow simulation, using geostatistical tools like [[kriging]]. As opposed to deterministic inversion methods which produce a single set of model parameters, stochastic methods generate a suite of alternate earth model parameters which all obey the model constraint. However, the two methods are related as the results of deterministic models is the average of all the possible non-unique solutions of stochastic methods.&lt;ref name="Earthworks"/&gt; Since seismic linear inversion is a deterministic inversion method, the stochastic method will not be discussed beyond this point.

== Linear inversion ==

The [[Deterministic algorithm|deterministic]] nature of [[Inverse problem|linear inversion]] requires a [[Function (mathematics)|functional]] relationship which models, in terms of the earth model [[parameters]], the seismic variable to be inverted. This functional relationship is some mathematical model derived from the fundamental laws of physics and is more often called a forward model. The aim of the technique is to minimize a function which is dependent on the difference between the convolution of the forward model with a source [[wavelet]] and the field collected [[seismic trace]]. As in the field of optimization, this function to be minimized is called the [[objective function]] and in convectional inverse modeling, is simply the difference between the convolved forward model and the seismic trace. As earlier mentioned, different types of variables can be inverted for but for clarity, these variables will be referred to as the [[Wave impedance|impedance]] series of the earth model. In the following subsections we will describe in more detail, in the context of linear inversion as a minimization problem, the different components that are necessary to invert seismic data.

=== Forward model ===

The centerpiece of seismic linear inversion is the forward model which models the generation of the experimental data collected.&lt;ref name="Cook1983"/&gt; According to Wiggins (1972),&lt;ref name="wiggns1972"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wiggins|first=Ralph|title=The general linear inverse problem: Implication of surface waves and free oscillations for Earth structure|journal=Reviews of Geophysics|date=February 1972|volume=10|issue=1|pages=251–285|doi=10.1029/RG010i001p00251}}&lt;/ref&gt; it provides a functional (computational) relationship between the model parameters and calculated values for the observed traces. Depending on the seismic data collected, this model may vary from the classical [[wave equation]]s for predicting [[particle displacement]] or fluid pressure for sound wave propagation through rock or fluids, to some variants of these classical equations. For example, the forward model in Tarantola (1984)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tarantola|first=A.|title=Linearized and inversion of seismic reflection-data|journal=Geophysical Prospecting|year=1984|volume=32|issue=6|pages=908–1015|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2478.1984.tb00751.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the wave equation for pressure variation in a liquid media during seismic wave propagation while by assuming constant velocity layers with plane interfaces, Kanasewich and Chiu (1985)&lt;ref name="kan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kanasewich|first=E. R.|author2=Chiu S. K. L |title=Least squares inversion of spatial seismic refraction data|journal=Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America|date=June 1985|volume=75|issue=3|pages=865–880|url=http://bssa.geoscienceworld.org/content/75/3/865.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the brachistotrone model of John Bernoulli for travel time of a [[Ray (geometry)|ray]] along a path. In Cooke and Schneider (1983),&lt;ref name="Cook1983"/&gt; the model is a synthetic trace generation algorithm expressed as in Eqn. 3, where R(t) is generated in the Z-domain by recursive formula. In whatever form the forward model appears, it is important that it not only predicts the collected field data, but also models how the data is generated. Thus, the forward model by Cooke and Schneider (1983)&lt;ref name="Cook1983"/&gt; can only be used to invert CMP data since the model invariably assumes no spreading loss by mimicking the response of a laterally [[homogeneous]] earth to a plane-wave source

&lt;ol start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;t=\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{\big[(x_i-x_{i-1})^2+(y_i-y_{i-1})^2+(z_i-z_{i-1})^2\big]^{\frac{1}{2}}}{v_i}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/li&gt;

where t is ray travel time, x, y, z are depth coordinates and vi is the constant velocity between interfaces i − 1 and i.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left[\frac{1}{K(\vec{r})}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}-\nabla\cdot\big(\frac{1}{\rho(\vec{r}\big)}\nabla)\right] U(\vec{r},t)= s(\vec{r},t)
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;K(\vec{r})&lt;/math&gt; represent bulk modulus, &lt;math&gt;\rho(\vec{r})&lt;/math&gt; density, &lt;math&gt;s(\vec{r},t)&lt;/math&gt; the source of acoustic waves, and &lt;math&gt;U(\vec{r},t)&lt;/math&gt;  the pressure variation.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;s(t)=w(t)*R(t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

where ''s''(''t'') = synthetic trace, ''w''(''t'') = source wavelet, and ''R''(''t'') = reflectivity function.

===Objective function===

An important numerical process in inverse modeling is to minimize the objective function, which is a function defined in terms of the difference between the collected field seismic data and the numerically computed seismic data. Classical objective functions include the sum of squared deviations between experimental and numerical data, as in the [[least squares]] methods, the sum of the [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of the difference between field and numerical data, or some variant of these definitions. Irrespective of the definition used, numerical solution of the inverse problem is obtained as earth model that minimize the objective function.

In addition to the objective function, other constraints like known model parameters and known layer interfaces in some regions of the earth are also incorporated in the inverse modeling procedure. These constraints, according to Francis 2006,&lt;ref name="Earthworks"/&gt; help to reduce non-uniqueness of the inversion solution by providing a priori information that is not contained in the inverted data while Cooke and Schneider (1983)&lt;ref name="Cook1983"/&gt; reports their useful in controlling noise and when working in a geophysically well-known area.

===Mathematical analysis of generalized linear inversion procedure===

The objective of mathematical analysis of inverse modeling is to cast the generalized linear inverse problem into a simple [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] algebra by considering all the components described in previous sections. viz; forward model, objective function etc. Generally, the numerically generated seismic data are non-linear functions of the earth model parameters. To remove the non-linearity and create a platform for application of [[linear algebra]] concepts, the forward model is [[Linearization|linearized]] by expansion using a [[Taylor series]] as carried out below. For more details see Wiggins (1972),&lt;ref name="wiggns1972"/&gt; Cooke and Schneider (1983).&lt;ref name="Cook1983"/&gt;

Consider a set of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; seismic field observations &lt;math&gt;F_j&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;j = 1, \ldots, m&lt;/math&gt; and a set of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; earth model parameters &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; to be inverted for, for &lt;math&gt;i=1,\ldots, n&lt;/math&gt;. The field observations can be represented in either &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}\,(\vec{p})&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;F_j\,(p_i)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\vec{p}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}\,(\vec{p})&lt;/math&gt; are vectorial representations of model parameters and the field observations as a function of earth parameters. Similarly, for &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; representing guesses of model parameters, &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}\,(\vec{q})&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of numerical computed seismic data using the forward model of Sec. 1.3. Taylor's series expansion of &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}\,(\vec{p})&lt;/math&gt; about &lt;math&gt;\vec{q}&lt;/math&gt; is given below.

&lt;ol start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}\,(\vec{p}) = \vec{F}\,(\vec{q})+(\vec{p}-\vec{q})\frac{\partial \vec{F}\,(\vec{q})}{\partial \vec{p}}+(\vec{p}-\vec{q})^2\frac{\partial^2 \vec{F}\,(\vec{q})}{\partial \vec{p}^2} +O(\vec{p}-\vec{q})^3&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

On linearization by dropping the non-linear terms (terms with (p⃗ − ⃗q) of order 2 and above), the equation becomes

&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}\,(\vec{p}) - \vec{F}\,(\vec{q})=(\vec{p}-\vec{q})\frac{\partial \vec{F}\,(\vec{q})}{\partial \vec{p}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Considering that &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; components and &lt;math&gt;\vec{p}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{q}&lt;/math&gt; have &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; components, the discrete form of Eqn. 5 results in a system of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; [[linear equation]]s in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; variables whose matrix form is shown below.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Delta \vec{F} = \mathbf{A}\,\Delta\vec{p}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Delta\vec{F} = \begin{bmatrix}F_1(\vec{p})-F_1(\vec{q})\\\vdots\\F_m(\vec{p})-F_m(\vec{q})\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Delta\vec{p} = \vec{p}-\vec{q} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
p_1-q_1\\
\vdots	\\
p_n-q_n
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial F_1(\vec{q})}{\partial p_1} &amp; \frac{\partial F_1(\vec{q})}{\partial p_2} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial F_1(\vec{q})}{\partial p_n} \\
\frac{\partial F_2(\vec{q})}{\partial p_1} &amp; \cdots &amp;  \frac{\partial F_2(\vec{q})}{\partial p_{n-1}} &amp; \frac{\partial F_2(\vec{q})}{\partial p_n} \\
\vdots	&amp;  \frac{\partial F_j(\vec{q})}{\partial p_i} &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
\frac{\partial F_m(\vec{q})}{\partial p_1} &amp; \frac{\partial F_m(\vec{q})}{\partial p_2} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial F_m(\vec{q})}{\partial p_n} \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Delta \vec{F}&lt;/math&gt; is called the difference [[vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] in Cooke and Schneider (1983).&lt;ref name="Cook1983"/&gt; It has a size of &lt;math&gt;m\times 1&lt;/math&gt; and its components are the difference between the observed trace and the numerically computed seismic data. &lt;math&gt;\Delta\vec{p}&lt;/math&gt; is the corrector vector of size &lt;math&gt;n\times 1&lt;/math&gt;, while &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is called the sensitivity matrix. It has a size of &lt;math&gt;m\times n&lt;/math&gt; and its comments are such that each column is the [[partial derivative]] of a component of the forward function with respect to one of the unknown earth model parameters. Similarly, each row is the partial derivative of a component of the numerically computed seismic trace with respect to all unknown model parameters.

===Solution algorithm===

&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}\,(\vec{q})&lt;/math&gt; is computed from the forward model, while &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}\,(\vec{p})&lt;/math&gt; is the experimental data. Thus,&lt;math&gt;\Delta \vec{F}&lt;/math&gt; is a known quality. On the other hand, &lt;math&gt;\Delta\vec{p}&lt;/math&gt; is unknown and is obtained by solution of Eqn. 10. This equation is theoretically solvable only when &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is invertible, that is, if it is a square matrix so that the number of observations &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of unknown earth parameters. If this is the case, the unknown corrector vector &lt;math&gt;\Delta\vec{p}&lt;/math&gt;, is solved for as shown below, using any of the classical direct or iterative solvers for solution of a set of linear equations.

&lt;ol start="10"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Delta \vec{p} = \mathbf{A}^{-1}\,\Delta\vec{F}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

In most [[seismic inversion]] applications, there are more observations than the number of earth parameters to be inverted for, i.e. &lt;math&gt;m&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, leading to a system of equations that is mathematically over-determined. As a result, Eqn. 10 is not theoretically solvable and an exact solution is not obtainable.&lt;ref name="kan"/&gt; An estimate of the corrector vector is obtained using the least squares procedure to find the corrector vector &lt;math&gt;\Delta \vec{p}&lt;/math&gt; that minimizes &lt;math&gt;\vec{e}\,^T \vec{e}&lt;/math&gt;, which is the sum of the squares of the error, &lt;math&gt;\vec{e}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="kan"/&gt;

The error&lt;math&gt;\vec{e}&lt;/math&gt; is given by

 &lt;ol start="11"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec{e} = \Delta\vec{F}-\mathbf{A}\,\Delta \vec{p}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

In the least squares procedure, the corrector vector that minimizes &lt;math&gt;\vec{e}\,^T\vec{e}&lt;/math&gt; is obtained as below.

&lt;ol start="12"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf{A}\,\Delta \vec{p} &amp;=\Delta\vec{F}\\
\mathbf{A}^T\mathbf{A}\,\Delta \vec{p}  &amp;= \mathbf{A}^T\Delta\vec{F}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Thus,

&lt;ol start="13"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\Delta \vec{p}  = (\mathbf{A}^T\mathbf{A})^{-1}\,\mathbf{A}^T\Delta\vec{F}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

From the above discussions, the objective function is defined as either the &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt; norm of &lt;math&gt;\Delta \vec{p}&lt;/math&gt; given by
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=0}^n|\Delta p_j|&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=0}^n|\Delta p_j|^2&lt;/math&gt; or of &lt;math&gt;\Delta \vec{F}&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^m|\Delta F_i|&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^m|\Delta F_i|^2&lt;/math&gt;.

The generalized procedure for inverting any experimental seismic data for &lt;math&gt;m = n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;m &gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, using the mathematical theory for inverse modeling, as described above, is shown in Fig. 1 and described as follows.

An initial guess of the model impedance is provided to initiate the inversion process. The forward model uses this initial guess to compute a synthetic seismic data which is subtracted from the observed seismic data to calculate the difference vector.

# An initial guess of the model impedance &lt;math&gt;\vec{q}&lt;/math&gt; is provided to initiate the inversion process.
# A synthetic seismic data &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}(\vec{q})&lt;/math&gt; is computed by the forward model, using the model impedance above.
# The difference vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}(\vec{p})-\vec{F}(\vec{q})&lt;/math&gt; is computed as the difference between experimental and synthetic seismic data.
# The sensitivity matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is computed at this value of the impedance profile.
# Using &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; and the difference vector from 3 above, the corrector vector &lt;math&gt;\Delta \vec{p}&lt;/math&gt; is calculated. A new impedance profile is obtained as &lt;ol start="14"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec{p}=\vec{q}+\Delta \vec{p}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
# The &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt; norm of the computed corrector vector is compared with a provided tolerance value. If the computed norm is less than the tolerance, the numerical procedure is concluded and the inverted impedance profile for the earth region is given by &lt;math&gt;\vec{p}&lt;/math&gt; from Eqn. 14. On the other hand, if the norm is greater than the tolerance, iterations through steps 2-6 are repeated but with an updated impedance profile as computed from Eqn. 14. Fig. 2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cooke|first=D|author2=Cant J. |title=Model-based seismic inversion: Comparing deterministic and probabilistic approaches|journal=CSEG Recorder|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows a typical example of impedance profile updating during successive iteration process. According to Cooke and Schneider (1983),&lt;ref name="Cook1983"/&gt; use of the corrected guess from Eqn. 14 as the new initial guess during iteration reduces the error.

==Parameterization of the earth model space==

Irrespective of the variable to be inverted for, the earth’s impedance is a continuous function of depth (or time in seismic data) and for numerical linear inversion technique to be applicable for this continuous physical model, the continuous properties have to be discretized and/or sampled at discrete intervals along the depth of the earth model. Thus, the total depth over which model properties are to be determined is a necessary starting point for the discretization. Commonly, as shown in Fig. 3, this properties are sampled at close discrete intervals over this depth to ensure high resolution of impedance variation along the earth’s depth. The impedance values inverted from the [[algorithm]] represents the average value in the discrete interval.

Considering that inverse modeling problem is only theoretically solvable when the number of discrete intervals for sampling the properties is equal to the number of observation in the trace to be inverted, a high-resolution sampling will lead to a large matrix which will be very expensive to invert. Furthermore, the matrix may be singular for dependent equations, the inversion can be unstable in the presence of noise and the system may be under-constrained if parameters other than the primary variables inverted for, are desired. In relation to parameters desired, other than impedance, Cooke and Schneider (1983)&lt;ref name="Cook1983"/&gt; gives them to include source wavelet and scale factor.

Finally, by treating constraints as known impedance values in some layers or discrete intervals, the number of unknown impedance values to be solved for are reduced, leading to greater accuracy in the results of the inversion algorithm.

==Inversion examples==

===Temperature inversion from Marescot (2010)&lt;ref name="m"/&gt;===

We start with an example to invert for earth parameter values from temperature depth distribution in a given earth region. Although this example does not directly relate to [[seismic inversion]] since no traveling acoustic waves are involved, it nonetheless introduces practical application of the inversion technique in a manner easy to comprehend, before moving on to seismic applications. In this example, the temperature of the earth is measured at discrete locations in a well bore by placing temperature sensors in the target depths. By assuming a forward model of linear distribution of temperature with depth, two parameters are inverted for from the temperature depth measurements.

The forward model is given by
&lt;ol start="15"&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}(\vec{q}) = \vec{T} = a+bz&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\vec{q} = [a,b]&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the dimension of &lt;math&gt;\vec{q}&lt;/math&gt; is 2 i.e. the number of parameters inverted for is 2.

The objective of this inversion algorithm is to find &lt;math&gt;\vec{p}&lt;/math&gt;, which is the value of &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; that minimizes the difference between the observed temperature distribution and those obtained using the forward model of Eqn. 15. Considering the dimension of the forward model or the number of temperature observations to be &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, the components of the forward model is written as

&lt;ol start="16"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
T_1&amp;=a+bz_1		\\
T_2&amp;=a+bz_2	\\
\vdots	\\
T_{n-1}&amp;=a+bz_{n-1}		\\
T_n&amp;=a+bz_n	\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

so that &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}(\vec{q}) = T&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; z_1  \\
1 &amp; z_2  \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots	\\
1 &amp; z_{n-1}  \\
1 &amp; z_n  \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

We present results from Marescot (2010)&lt;ref name="m"&gt;{{cite web|last=Marescot|first=Laurent|title=Introduction to Inversion in Geophysics|url=http://www.tomoquest.com|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the case of &lt;math&gt;n = 2&lt;/math&gt; for which the observed temperature values at depths were &lt;math&gt;T_1 = 19 ^{\circ}C&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;z=2m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_2=22^{\circ}C&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;z=8m&lt;/math&gt;. These experimental data were inverted to obtain earth parameter values of &lt;math&gt;a = 0.5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b=18^{\circ}C&lt;/math&gt;. For a more general case with large number of temperature observations, Fig. 4 shows the final linear forward model obtained from using the inverted values of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. The figure shows a good match between experimental and numerical data.

===Wave travel time inversion from Marescot (2010)&lt;ref name="m"/&gt;===

This examples inverts for earth layer [[velocity]] from recorded seismic wave travel times. Fig. 5 shows the initial velocity guesses and the travel times recorded from the field, while Fig. 6a shows the inverted [[heterogeneous]] velocity model, which is the solution of the inversion algorithm obtained after 30 [[iteration]]s. As seen in Fig. 6b, there is good comparison between the final travel times obtained from the forward model using the inverted velocity and the field record travel times. Using these solutions, the ray path was reconstructed and is shown to be highly tortuous through the earth model as shown in Fig. 7.

===Seismic trace inversion from Cooke and Schneider (1983)===

This example, taken from Cooke and Schneider (1983),&lt;ref name="Cook1983"/&gt; shows inversion of a CMP seismic trace for earth model impedance (product of density and velocity) profile. The seismic trace inverted is shown in Fig. 8 while Fig. 9a shows the inverted impedance profile with the input initial impedance used for the inversion algorithm. Also recorded alongside the seismic trace is an impedance log of the earth region as shown in Fig. 9b. The figures show good comparison between the recorded impedance log and the numerical inverted impedance from the seismic trace.

* [[Limit point]], a set ''S'' in a topological space ''X'' is a point ''x'' (which is in X, but not necessarily in S) that can be approximated by points of ''S'', since every neighbourhood of ''x'' with respect to the topology on ''X'' also contains a point of ''S'' other than ''x'' itself
** [[Accumulation point]] (or [[cluster point]]), a point {{nowrap|''x'' &amp;isin; ''X''}} of a [[sequence]] (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''N'''&lt;/sub&gt; for which there are, for every neighbourhood ''V'' of ''x'', infinitely many natural numbers ''n'' such that ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''V''

A '''Macroscopic traffic flow model''' is a [[mathematical model|mathematical]] [[traffic model]] that formulates the relationships among [[traffic flow]] characteristics like [[density]], [[Traffic flow|flow]], mean speed of a traffic stream, etc.. Such models are conventionally arrived at by integrating [[microscopic traffic flow models]] and converting the single-entity level characteristics to comparable system level characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00205-015-0843-4 | doi=10.1007/s00205-015-0843-4 | volume=217 | issue=3 | title=Rigorous Derivation of Nonlinear Scalar Conservation Laws from Follow-the-Leader Type Models via Many Particle Limit | journal=Archive for Rational Mechanics and Analysis | pages=831–871| year=2015 | last1=Di Francesco | first1=M. | last2=Rosini | first2=M.D. | arxiv=1404.7062 | bibcode=2015ArRMA.217..831D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The method of modeling traffic flow at macroscopic level originated under an assumption that traffic streams as a whole are comparable to [[fluid flow|fluid streams]]. The first major step in macroscopic modeling of traffic was taken by Lighthill and Whitham in 1955, when they indexed the comparability of ‘traffic flow on long crowded roads’ with ‘flood movements in long rivers’. A year later, Richards (1956) complemented the idea with the introduction of ‘[[shock-wave]]s on the highway’, completing the so-called LWR model. 
Macroscopic modeling may be primarily classified according to the type of traffic as homogeneous and heterogeneous, and further with respect to the order of the mathematical model.

'''Maekawa's theorem''' is a [[theorem]] in the [[mathematics of paper folding]] named after [[Jun Maekawa]]. It relates to flat-foldable [[origami]] [[crease pattern]]s and states that at every [[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]], the numbers of valley and mountain folds always differ by two in either direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Kasahara|first1=K.|last2=Takahama|first2=T.|title=Origami for the Connoisseur|publisher=Japan Publications|location=New York|year=1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The same result was also discovered by Jacques Justin&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Justin|first=J.|title=Mathematics of origami, part 9|journal=British Origami|date=June 1986|pages=28–30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and, even earlier, by S. Murata.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Parity and coloring==
One consequence of Maekawa's theorem is that the total number of folds at each vertex must be an [[even number]]. This implies (via a form of [[Dual graph|planar graph duality]] between [[Eulerian graph]]s and [[bipartite graph]]s) that, for any flat-foldable crease pattern, it is always possible to [[graph coloring|color]] the regions between the creases with two colors, such that each crease separates regions of differing colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Related results==
Maekawa's theorem does not completely characterize the flat-foldable vertices, because it only takes into account the numbers of folds of each type, and not their angles.
[[Kawasaki's theorem]] gives a complementary condition on the angles between the folds at a vertex (regardless of which folds are mountain folds and which are valley folds) that is also necessary for a vertex to be flat-foldable.

"'''Math Suks'''" is a song by [[Jimmy Buffett]], from the [[album]] ''[[Beach House on the Moon]]'' ([[1999 in music|1999]]).

The lyrics tell of the author's frustration as a [[mathematics|math]] student. According to the lyrics, the inspiration for the song and title came from a candid interview on TV:

:''I got so bored with my homework''
:''I turned on the TV''
:''The beauty contest winners were all smiling through their teeth"
:''They asked the new Miss America "Hey babe, can you add up all those bucks?"''
:''She looked puzzled then just said, "Math Suks!"''

However, in later interviews Jimmy said that the inspiration actually came from [[graffiti]] on a bridge in [[Key West]] [[Florida]].&lt;ref name="scimag"&gt;{{cite web | title = Irreverent Song Upsets Math Teachers | author = Dana Mackenzie | url = http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/1999/603/5 (outdated link) | accessdate = November 2008 | date = June 3, 1999 | publisher = American Association for the Advancement of Science }} (updated link: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/284/5421/1763.2.full)&lt;/ref&gt;

Consistent with its stated theme, the song lyrics are largely an emotional [[catharsis]];  mathematical terms are used only in a very superficial way. Presumably for that reason, the song seems to have little appeal to mathematicians, and even less to mathematics teachers &lt;ref name="scimag"/&gt; (unlike other songs that make fun at mathematics, such as [[Tom Lehrer]]'s "[[Lobachevsky (song)|Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky]]" and "[[New Math (song)|New Math]]").  The song was in fact promptly condemned by the [[United States|US]] [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]] and the [[National Education Association]] for its alleged negative effect on children's education.&lt;ref name="scimag"/&gt;  [[Jon Stewart]] also criticized the song on ''[[The Daily Show]]'' during a segment called "Math Is Quite Pleasant".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/mon-may-24-1999/math-is-quite-pleasant]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mathematical fiction''' is a genre of creative fictional work in which mathematics and mathematicians play important roles. The form and the medium of the works are not important. The genre may include short stories, novels or plays; comic books; films, videos, or audios. One of the earliest, and much studied, work of this genre is [[Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions]], an 1884 satirical novella by the English schoolmaster [[Edwin Abbott Abbott]]. Mathematical fiction may have existed since ancient times, but it was recently rediscovered as a genre of literature; since then there has been a growing body of literature in this genre, and the genre has attracted a growing body of readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Janice Padula|title=Mathematical fiction for  senior students and undergraduates: Novels, plays, and film|journal=Australian Senior Mathematics Journal|volume=20|issue=2|pages=36–44|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ744036.pdf|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Darren Glass|title=MAA REview of The Shape of Content: Creative Writing in Mathematics and Science|url=http://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/the-shape-of-content-creative-writing-in-mathematics-and-science|publisher=Mathematical Association of America|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Abbot's Flatland spawned a sequel in the 21st century: a novel titled ''[[Flatterland]]'', authored by [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] and published in 2001.

==A database of mathematical fiction==
Alex Kasman, a Professor of Mathematics at [[College of Charleston]], who maintains a database of works that could possibly be included in this genre, has a broader definition for the genre: Any work "containing mathematics or mathematicians" has been treated as mathematical fiction. Accordingly, ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' by [[Jonathan Swift]], ''[[War and Peace]]'' by [[Lev Tolstoy]], ''[[Mrs. Warren's Profession]]'' by [[George Bernard Shaw]], and several similar literary works appear in Kasman's database because these works contain references to mathematics or mathematicians, even though mathematics and mathematicians are not important in their plots. According to this broader approach, the oldest extant work of mathematical fiction is ''[[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]'', a comedy by the Ancient Greek playwright [[Aristophanes]] performed in 414 BCE. Kasman's database has a list of more than one thousand items of diverse categories like literature, comic books and films.&lt;ref name="Kasman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alex Kasman|title=Mathematical Fiction|url=http://kasmana.people.cofc.edu/MATHFICT/|publisher=Alex Kasman|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mathematical Fiction Website Achieves Milestone|url=http://www.ams.org/gnews#!news_id=1171|publisher=American Mathematical Society|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maya Sharma|title=Stories for Mathematicians: The Mathematical Fiction Homepage|url=http://blogs.ams.org/mathgradblog/2012/09/30/stories-mathematicians-mathematical-fiction-homepage/#sthash.cLdHW0QU.dpbs|website=AMS Blogs|publisher=American Mathematical Society|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mathematics and art''' are related in a variety of ways. [[Mathematics]] has itself been described as an [[art]] [[mathematical beauty|motivated by beauty]]. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as [[Music and mathematics|music]], [[dance]], [[painting]], [[Mathematics and architecture|architecture]], [[sculpture]], and [[Mathematics and fiber arts|textiles]]. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.

Mathematics and art have a long historical relationship. [[List of mathematical artists|Artists have used mathematics]] since the 4th century BC when the Greek [[sculpture|sculptor]] [[Polykleitos]] wrote his ''Canon'', prescribing proportions based on the ratio 1:{{radic|2}} for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the [[golden ratio]] in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian [[Renaissance]], [[Luca Pacioli]] wrote the influential treatise ''[[De Divina Proportione]]'' (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, [[Piero della Francesca]], developed [[Euclid]]'s ideas on [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] in treatises such as ''De Prospectiva Pingendi'', and in his paintings. The engraver [[Albrecht Dürer]] made many references to mathematics in his work ''[[Melencolia I]]''. In modern times, the [[graphic artist]] [[M. C. Escher]] made intensive use of [[tessellation]] and [[hyperbolic geometry]], with the help of the mathematician [[H. S. M. Coxeter]], while the [[De Stijl]] movement led by [[Theo van Doesburg]] and [[Piet Mondrian]] explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as [[quilting]], [[knitting]], [[cross-stitch]], [[crochet]], [[embroidery]], [[weaving]], [[Turkish carpet|Turkish]] and other [[carpet]]-making, as well as [[kilim]]. In [[Islamic art]], symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian [[girih]] and Moroccan [[zellige]] tilework, [[Mughal architecture|Mughal]] [[jali]] pierced stone screens, and widespread [[muqarnas]] vaulting.

Mathematics has directly influenced art with conceptual tools such as [[linear perspective]], the analysis of [[symmetry]], and mathematical objects such as [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] and the [[Möbius strip]]. [[Magnus Wenninger]] creates colourful [[stellation|stellated polyhedra]], originally as models for teaching. Mathematical concepts such as [[recursion]] and logical paradox can be seen in paintings by [[Rene Magritte]] and in engravings by M. C. Escher. [[Computer art]] often makes use of [[fractal]]s including the [[Mandelbrot set]], and sometimes explores other mathematical objects such as [[cellular automata]]. Controversially, the artist [[David Hockney]] has argued that artists from the Renaissance onwards made use of the [[camera lucida]] to draw precise representations of scenes; the architect Philip Steadman similarly argued that [[Vermeer]] used the [[camera obscura]] in his distinctively observed paintings.

Other relationships include the algorithmic analysis of artworks by [[X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy]], the finding that traditional [[batik]]s from different regions of [[Java]] have distinct [[fractal dimension]]s, and stimuli to mathematics research, especially [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]'s theory of perspective, which eventually led to [[Girard Desargues]]'s [[projective geometry]]. A persistent view, based ultimately on the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] notion of harmony in music, holds that everything was arranged by Number, that God is the geometer of the world, and that therefore the world's [[sacred geometry|geometry is sacred]], as seen in artworks such as [[William Blake]]'s ''[[The Ancient of Days]]''.

==Origins: from Ancient Greece to the Renaissance==

{{Anchor|Polykleitos}}

===Polykleitos's ''Canon'' and ''symmetria''===
[[File:Doryphoros MAN Napoli Inv6011-2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Roman copy in marble of ''[[Doryphoros]]'', originally a bronze by [[Polykleitos]]]]
{{further information|Polykleitos}}

[[Polykleitos]] the elder (c.450–420 BC) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[sculptor]] from the school of [[Argos]], and a contemporary of [[Phidias]]. His works and statues consisted mainly of bronze and were of athletes. According to the philosopher and mathematician [[Xenocrates]], Polykleitos is ranked as one of the most important sculptors of [[Classical antiquity]] for his work on the ''[[Doryphorus]]'' and the statue of [[Hera]] in the [[Heraion of Argos]].&lt;ref name=Stewart&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stewart |first1=Andrew |title=Polykleitos of Argos," One Hundred Greek Sculptors: Their Careers and Extant Works |journal=[[Journal of Hellenic Studies]] |date=November 1978 |volume=98 |pages=122–131 |doi=10.2307/630196|jstor=630196}}&lt;/ref&gt; While his sculptures may not be as famous as those of Phidias, they are much admired. In the ''Canon'' of Polykleitos, a treatise he wrote designed to document the "perfect" [[anatomy|anatomical]] proportions of the male nude, Polykleitos gives us a mathematical approach towards sculpturing the human body.&lt;ref name=Stewart/&gt;

Polykleitos uses the [[distal phalanges|distal phalanx]] of the [[little finger]] as the basic module for determining the proportions of the human body.&lt;ref name=Tobin&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tobin, Richard |title=The ''Canon'' of Polykleitos |journal=[[American Journal of Archaeology]] |volume=79 |issue=4 |date=October 1975 |pages=307–321 |doi=10.2307/503064}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polykleitos multiplies the length of the distal phalanx by the [[square root of two]] ({{radic|2}}) to get the distance of the [[intermediate phalanges|second phalanges]] and multiplies the length again by {{radic|2}} to get the length of the [[proximal phalanges|third phalanges]]. Next, he takes the [[finger]] length and multiplies that by {{radic|2}} to get the length of the palm from the base of the finger to the [[ulna]]. This [[geometric series]] of measurements progresses until Polykleitos has formed the arm, chest, body, and so on.&lt;ref name=Lawton&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lawton |first1=Arthur J. |title=Pattern, Tradition and Innovation in Vernacular Architecture |journal=Past |date=2013 |volume=36 |url=http://www.pioneeramerica.org/past2013/past2013artlawton.html |quote=The base figure is a square the length and width of the distal phalange of the little finger. Its diagonals rotated to one side transform the square to a 1 : {{radic|2}} root rectangle. In Figure 5 this rectangular figure marks the width and length of the adjacent medial phalange. Rotating the medial diagonal proportions the proximal phalange and similarly from there to the wrist, from wrist to elbow and from elbow to shoulder top. Each new step advances the diagonal's pivot point.|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the ''Canon'' of Polykleitos is immense in [[Classical Greek]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], and [[Renaissance]] sculpture, many sculptors following Polykleitos's prescription. While none of Polykleitos's original works survive, Roman copies demonstrate his ideal of physical perfection and mathematical precision. Some scholars argue that [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] thought influenced the ''Canon'' of Polykleitos.&lt;ref name=Raven&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Raven |first1=J. E. |title=Polyclitus and Pythagoreanism |journal=[[Classical Quarterly]] |date=1951 |volume=1|issue=3–4 |pages=147– |doi=10.1017/s0009838800004122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Canon'' applies the basic mathematical concepts of Greek geometry, such as the ratio, proportion, and ''symmetria'' (Greek for "harmonious proportions") and turns it into a system capable of describing the human form through a series of continuous [[geometric series|geometric progressions]].&lt;ref name=Tobin/&gt;

===Perspective and proportion===
{{main article|Perspective (graphical)}}

[[File:Brunelleschi's perspective experiment.jpg|thumb|[[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]]'s experiment with [[linear perspective]]]]

In classical times, rather than making distant figures smaller with [[linear perspective]], painters sized objects and figures according to their thematic importance. In the Middle Ages, some artists used [[reverse perspective]] for special emphasis. The Muslim mathematician [[Alhazen]] (Ibn al-Haytham) described a theory of optics in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' in 1021, but never applied it to art.&lt;ref name=StAndrews/&gt; The [[Renaissance]] saw a rebirth of [[Classical Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] culture and ideas, among them the study of mathematics to understand [[nature]] and the [[arts]]. Two major motives drove artists in the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance towards mathematics. First, painters needed to figure out how to depict three-dimensional scenes on a two-dimensional canvas. Second, philosophers and artists alike were convinced that mathematics was the true essence of the physical world and that the entire universe, including the arts, could be explained in geometric terms.&lt;ref name=Emmer&gt;{{cite book |editor=Emmer, Michelle |title=The Visual Mind II |publisher=MIT Press |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-262-05048-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rudiments of perspective arrived with [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]] (1266/7 – 1337), who attempted to draw in perspective using an algebraic method to determine the placement of distant lines. In 1415, the Italian [[architect]] [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] and his friend [[Leon Battista Alberti]] demonstrated the geometrical method of applying perspective in Florence, using [[similar triangles]] as formulated by Euclid, to find the apparent height of distant objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Vasari, Giorgio |authorlink=Giorgio Vasari |date=1550 |title=[[Lives of the Artists]] |publisher=Torrentino |page=Chapter on Brunelleschi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alberti |first1=Leon Battista |last2=Spencer |first2=John R. |title=On Painting |date=1956 |publisher=Yale University Press |origyear=1435|url=http://www.noteaccess.com/Texts/Alberti/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brunelleschi's own perspective paintings are lost, but [[Masaccio]]'s painting of the Holy Trinity shows his principles at work.&lt;ref name=StAndrews/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Field |first1=J. V. |title=The Invention of Infinity: Mathematics and Art in the Renaissance |date=1997 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-852394-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Witcombe |first1=Christopher L.

The Italian painter [[Paolo Uccello]] (1397–1475) was fascinated by perspective, as shown in his paintings of ''[[The Battle of San Romano]]'' (c. 1435–1460): broken lances lie conveniently along perspective lines.&lt;ref name="Hart"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/art.html |title=Polyhedra in Art |author=Hart, George W. |authorlink=George W.

The jousting combatants engage on a battlefield littered with broken lances that have fallen in a near-grid pattern and are aimed toward a vanishing point somewhere in the distance.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painter [[Piero della Francesca]] (c.1415–1492) exemplified this new shift in Italian Renaissance thinking. He was an expert [[mathematician]] and [[geometer]], writing books on [[solid geometry]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], including ''[[De Prospectiva Pingendi]] (On Perspective for Painting)'', ''Trattato d'Abaco (Abacus Treatise)'', and ''De corporibus regularibus (On Regular Solids)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=della Francesca, Piero |title=De Prospectiva Pingendi |editor=G. Nicco Fasola |location=Florence |year=1942 |origyear=c. 1474}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=della Francesca, Piero |title=Trattato d'Abaco |editor=G. Arrighi |location=Pisa |year=1970 |origyear=Fifteenth century}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=della Francesca, Piero |title=L'opera "De corporibus regularibus" di Pietro Franceschi detto della Francesca usurpata da Fra Luca Pacioli |editor=G. Mancini |year=1916}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Vasari]] in his ''[[Lives of the Painters]]'' calls Piero the "greatest geometer of his time, or perhaps of any time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Vasari, G. |title=Le Opere, volume 2 |editor=G. Milanesi |date=1878 |page=490}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piero's interest in perspective can be seen in his paintings including the [[Polyptych of Perugia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zuffi |first=Stefano  |title=Piero della Francesca |publisher=L'Unità – Mondadori Arte |year=1991 |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''San Agostino altarpiece'' and ''[[The Flagellation of Christ]]''. His work on geometry influenced later mathematicians and artists including [[Luca Pacioli]] in his ''De Divina Proportione'' and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Piero studied classical mathematics and the works of [[Archimedes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Heath, T.L. |title=The Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elements |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1908 |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was taught commercial arithmetic in "abacus schools"; his writings are formatted like abacus school textbooks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Grendler, P. |title=What Piero Learned in School: Fifteenth-Century Vernacular Education |work=Piero della Francesca and His Legacy |editor=M.A. Lavin |publisher=University Press of New England |year=1995 |pages=161–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps including Leonardo Pisano ([[Fibonacci]])'s 1202 ''[[Liber Abaci]]''. [[Linear perspective]] was just being introduced into the artistic world. Alberti explained in his 1435 ''[[De pictura]]'': "light rays travel in straight lines from points in the observed scene to the eye, forming a kind of [[pyramid]] with the eye as vertex." A painting constructed with linear perspective is a [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-section]] of that pyramid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Alberti, Leon Battista |title=On Painting |editor= Kemp, Martin |author2=Grayson, Cecil (trans.) |publisher=Penguin Classics |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''De Prospectiva Pingendi'', Piero transforms his empirical observations of the way aspects of a figure change with point of view into mathematical proofs. His treatise starts in the vein of Euclid: he defines the point as "the tiniest thing that is possible for the eye to comprehend".{{efn|In Piero's Italian: "una cosa tanto picholina quanto e possible ad ochio comprendere".}}&lt;ref name=Emmer/&gt; He uses [[deductive logic]] to lead the reader to the perspective representation of a three-dimensional body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Peterson, Mark |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/rschwart/mac/Italian/geometry.shtml |title=The Geometry of Piero della Francesca |quote=In Book I, after some elementary constructions to introduce the idea of the apparent size of an object being actually its angle subtended at the eye, and referring to Euclid's Elements Books I and VI, and Euclid's Optics, he turns, in Proposition 13, to the representation of a square lying flat on the ground in front of the viewer. What should the artist actually draw? After this, objects are constructed in the square (tilings, for example, to represent a tiled floor), and corresponding objects are constructed in perspective; in Book II prisms are erected over these planar objects, to represent houses, columns, etc.; but the basis of the method is the original square, from which everything else follows.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist [[David Hockney]] [[Hockney-Falco thesis|argued]] in his book ''[[Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters]]'' that artists started using a [[camera lucida]] from the 1420s, resulting in a sudden change in precision and realism, and that this practice was continued by major artists including [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], [[Jan van Eyck|Van Eyck]], and [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hockney |first=David |title=Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters |year=2006 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |isbn=978-0-500-28638-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics disagree on whether Hockney was correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Van Riper |first1=Frank |title=Hockney's 'Lucid' Bomb At the Art Establishment |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/photo/essays/vanRiper/030220.htm |publisher=The Washington Post |accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Marr |first1=Andrew |title=What the eye didn't see |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/oct/07/featuresreview.review1 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=4 September 2015 |date=7 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the architect Philip Steadman argued controversially&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Janson |first1=Jonathan |title=An Interview with Philip Steadman |url=http://www.essentialvermeer.com/interviews_newsletter/steadman_interview.html#.VeqxKJdUWHg |publisher=Essential Vermeer |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=25 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Vermeer]] had used a different device, the [[camera obscura]], to help him create his distinctively observed paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steadman |first1=Philip |title=Vermeer's Camera: Uncovering the Truth Behind the Masterpieces |date=2002 |publisher=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-280302-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1509, [[Luca Pacioli]] (c. 1447–1517) published ''[[De divina proportione]]'' on [[mathematical]] and [[artistic]] [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]], including in the human face. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) illustrated the text with woodcuts of regular solids while he studied under Pacioli in the 1490s. Leonardo's drawings are probably the first illustrations of skeletonic solids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/pacioli.html |title=Luca Pacioli's Polyhedra |author=Hart, George |authorlink=George W. Hart |accessdate=13 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These, such as the [[rhombicuboctahedron]], were among the first to be drawn to demonstrate perspective by being overlaid on top of each other. The work discusses perspective in the works of [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Melozzo da Forlì]], and [[Marco Palmezzano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Morris |first1=Roderick Conway |title=Palmezzano's Renaissance:From shadows, painter emerges |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/27/arts/27iht-conway.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=22 July 2015 |date=27 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Da Vinci studied Pacioli's ''Summa'', from which he copied tables of proportions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/math5.geometry/unit14/unit14.html |author=Calter, Paul |title=Geometry and Art Unit 1 |publisher=[[Dartmouth College]] |accessdate=13 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' and ''[[The Last Supper]]'', Da Vinci's work incorporated linear perspective with a [[vanishing point]] to provide apparent depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Brizio, Anna Maria |title=Leonardo the Artist |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Last Supper]]'' is constructed in a tight ratio of 12:6:4:3, as is [[Raphael]]'s ''[[The School of Athens]]'', which includes Pythagoras with a tablet of ideal ratios, sacred to the Pythagoreans.&lt;ref name="Ladwein2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ladwein |first=Michael |title=Leonardo Da Vinci, the Last Supper: A Cosmic Drama and an Act of Redemption |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wMFem_x1M04C&amp;pg=PA62 |year=2006 |publisher=Temple Lodge Publishing |isbn=978-1-902636-75-7|pages=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Turner, Richard A. |title=Inventing Leonardo |publisher=Alfred A.

As early as the 15th century, [[curvilinear perspective]] found its way into paintings by artists interested in image distortions. [[Jan van Eyck]]'s 1434 ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' contains a convex mirror with reflections of the people in the scene,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Criminisi, A. |author2=Kempz, M. |author3=Kang, S.

Three-dimensional space can be represented convincingly in art, as in [[technical drawing]], by means other than perspective. [[Oblique projection]]s, including cavalier perspective (used by French military artists to depict fortifications in the 18th century), were used continuously and ubiquitously by Chinese artists from the first or second centuries until the 18th century. The Chinese acquired the technique from India, which acquired it from Ancient Rome. Oblique projection is seen in Japanese art, such as in the [[Ukiyo-e]] paintings of [[Torii Kiyonaga]] (1752–1815).&lt;ref name=Cucker269&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=269–278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

an irrational number which is approximately 1.325. According to the architect [[Richard Padovan]], this has characteristic ratios {{sfrac|3|4}} and {{sfrac|1|7}}, which govern the limits of human perception in relating one physical size to another.

===Planar symmetries===

[[Planar symmetry|Planar symmetries]] have for millennia been exploited in artworks such as [[carpet]]s, lattices, textiles and tilings.&lt;ref name=Cucker89/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lerner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ellison/&gt;&lt;ref name=Castera/&gt;

Many traditional rugs, whether pile carpets or flatweave [[kilim]]s, are divided into a central field and a framing border; both can have symmetries, though in handwoven carpets these are often slightly broken by small details, variations of pattern and shifts in colour introduced by the weaver.&lt;ref name=Cucker89&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=89–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; In kilims from [[Anatolia]], the [[motif (textile arts)|motifs]] used are themselves usually symmetrical. The general layout, too, is usually present, with arrangements such as stripes, stripes alternating with rows of motifs, and packed arrays of roughly hexagonal motifs. The field is commonly laid out as a wallpaper with a [[wallpaper group]] such as pmm, while the border may be laid out as a frieze of [[frieze group]] pm11, pmm2 or pma2. Turkish and Central Asian kilims often have three or more borders in different frieze groups. Weavers certainly had the intention of symmetry, without explicit knowledge of its mathematics.&lt;ref name=Cucker89/&gt;
The mathematician and architectural theorist [[Nikos Salingaros]] suggests that the "powerful presence"&lt;ref name=Salingaros/&gt; (aesthetic effect) of a "great carpet"&lt;ref name=Salingaros/&gt; such as the best Konya two-medallion carpets of the 17th century is created by mathematical techniques related to the theories of the architect [[Christopher Alexander]]. These techniques include making opposites couple; opposing colour values; differentiating areas geometrically, whether by using complementary shapes or balancing the directionality of sharp angles; providing small-scale complexity (from the knot level upwards) and both small- and large-scale symmetry; repeating elements at a hierarchy of different scales (with a ratio of about 2.7 from each level to the next). Salingaros argues that "all successful carpets satisfy at least nine of the above ten rules", and suggests that it might be possible to create a metric from these rules.&lt;ref name=Salingaros&gt;{{cite journal |author=Salingaros, Nikos |title=The 'life' of a carpet: an application of the Alexander rules |url=http://zeta.math.utsa.edu/~yxk833/life.carpet.html |journal=8th International Conference on Oriental Carpets |location=Philadelphia |date=November 1996}} Reprinted in {{cite book |editor1-last=Eiland |editor1-first=M. |editor2-last=Pinner |editor2-first=M. |title=Oriental Carpet and Textile Studies V |date=1998 |publisher=Conference on Oriental Carpets |location=Danville, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islamic art]] [[Islamic geometric patterns|exploits symmetries]] in many of its artforms, notably in [[girih tiles|girih]] tilings. These are formed using a set of five tile shapes, namely a regular decagon, an elongated hexagon, a bow tie, a rhombus, and a regular pentagon. All the sides of these tiles have the same length; and all their angles are multiples of 36° (π/5 [[radian]]s), offering fivefold and tenfold symmetries. The tiles are decorated with [[strapwork]] lines (girih), generally more visible than the tile boundaries. In 2007, the physicists [[Peter Lu]] and [[Paul Steinhardt]]  argued that girih resembled [[quasicrystalline]] [[Penrose tiling]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lu, Peter J. |author2=Steinhardt, Paul J. |year=2007 |title=Decagonal and Quasi-crystalline Tilings in Medieval Islamic Architecture |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=315 |pages=1106–1110 |doi=10.1126/science.1135491 |pmid=17322056 |issue=5815 |bibcode=2007Sci...315.1106L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elaborate geometric [[zellige]] tilework is a distinctive element in [[Morocco|Moroccan]] architecture.&lt;ref name=Castera&gt;{{cite book |last1=Castera |first1=Jean Marc |last2=Peuriot |first2=Francoise |title=Arabesques.

===Polyhedra===
[[File:Leonardo polyhedra.png|thumb|The first printed illustration of a [[rhombicuboctahedron]], by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], published in ''[[De Divina Proportione]]'', 1509]]

The [[Platonic solid]]s and other [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] are a recurring theme in Western art. They are found, for instance, in a marble mosaic featuring the [[small stellated dodecahedron]], attributed to Paolo Uccello, in the floor of the [[San Marco di Venezia|San Marco Basilica]] in Venice;&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; in Leonardo da Vinci's diagrams of regular polyhedra drawn as illustrations for [[Luca Pacioli]]'s 1509 book ''The Divine Proportion'';&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; as a glass [[rhombicuboctahedron]] in Jacopo de Barbari's portrait of Pacioli, painted in 1495;&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; in the truncated polyhedron (and various other mathematical objects) in [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s engraving [[Melencolia I]];&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; and in [[Salvador Dalí]]'s painting ''The Last Supper'' in which Christ and his disciples are pictured inside a giant [[dodecahedron]].

[[Albrecht Dürer]] (1471–1528) was a [[German people|German]] [[Renaissance]] [[printmaker]] who made important contributions to polyhedral literature in his 1525 book, ''Underweysung der Messung (Education on Measurement)'', meant to teach the subjects of [[linear perspective]], [[geometry]] in [[architecture]], [[Platonic solids]], and [[regular polygons]]. Dürer was likely influenced by the works of [[Luca Pacioli]] and [[Piero della Francesca]] during his trips to [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Panofsky, E. |title=The Life and Art of Albrecht Durer |publisher=Princeton |year=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the examples of perspective in ''Underweysung der Messung'' are underdeveloped and contain inaccuracies, there is a detailed discussion of polyhedra. Dürer is also the first to introduce in text the idea of [[Net (polyhedron)|polyhedral nets]], polyhedra unfolded to lie flat for printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hart, George W. |url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/durer.html |title=Dürer's Polyhedra |accessdate=13 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dürer published another influential book on [[human proportions]] called ''Vier Bücher von Menschlicher Proportion (Four Books on Human Proportion)'' in 1528.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dürer |first1=Albrecht |title=Hierinn sind begriffen vier Bucher von menschlicher Proportion|url=https://archive.org/details/hierinnsindbegri00dure |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=24 June 2015 |location=Nurenberg |date=1528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fractal dimensions===

[[File:Batik pedalaman - parang klithik.JPG|thumb|[[Batik]]s from [[Surakarta]], Java, like this ''parang klithik'' sword pattern, have a [[fractal dimension]] between 1.2 and 1.5.]]

Traditional Indonesian wax-resist [[batik]] designs on cloth combine [[representation (arts)|representational]] motifs (such as floral and vegetal elements) with abstract and somewhat chaotic elements, including imprecision in applying the wax resist, and random variation introduced by cracking of the wax. Batik designs have a [[fractal dimension]] between 1 and 2, varying in different regional styles. For example, the batik of [[Cirebon]] has a fractal dimension of 1.1; the batiks of [[Yogyakarta]] and [[Surakarta]] (Solo) in Central [[Java]] have a fractal dimension of 1.2 to 1.5; and the batiks of [[Rembang Regency|Lasem]] on the north coast of Java and of [[Tasikmalaya]] in West Java have a fractal dimension between 1.5 and 1.7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lukman |first1=Muhamad |last2=Hariadi |first2=Yun |last3=Destiarmand |first3=Achmad Haldani |title=Batik Fractal : Traditional Art to Modern Complexity |journal=Proceeding Generative Art X, Milan, Italy |date=2007 |url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/36748400/32.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1474897246&amp;Signature=kXmu3pdTrpZ1pkw8CLV3GHNR%2FVs%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DBatik_Fractal_Traditional_Art_to_Modern.pdf |accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[drip painting]] works of the modern artist [[Jackson Pollock]] are similarly distinctive in their fractal dimension. His 1948 ''Number 14'' has a coastline-like dimension of 1.45, while his later paintings had successively higher fractal dimensions and accordingly more elaborate patterns. One of his last works, ''Blue Poles'', took six months to create, and has the fractal dimension of 1.72.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ouellette |first1=Jennifer |title=Pollock's Fractals |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2001/nov/featpollock |accessdate=26 September 2016 |agency=Discover Magazine |date=November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A complex relationship==
The astronomer [[Galileo Galilei]] in his ''[[Il Saggiatore]]'' wrote that "[The universe] is written in [[patterns in nature|the language of mathematics]], and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometric figures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Galilei, Galileo |authorlink=Galileo Galilei |title=The Assayer |year=1623}}, as translated in {{cite book |author=Drake, Stillman |authorlink=Stillman Drake  |year=1957 |title=Discoveries and Opinions of Galileo |publisher=Doubleday |pages=237–238 |isbn=0-385-09239-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists who strive and seek to study nature must first, in Galileo's view, fully understand mathematics. Mathematicians, conversely, have sought to interpret and analyse art through the lens of geometry and rationality. The mathematician Felipe Cucker suggests that mathematics, and especially geometry, is a source of rules for "rule-driven artistic creation", though not the only one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the many strands of the resulting complex relationship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; are described below.

[[File:Ghhardy@72.jpg|thumb|upright|The mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]] defined a set of criteria for [[mathematical beauty]].]]

===Mathematics as an art===
{{main article|Mathematical beauty}}

The mathematician Jerry P. King describes mathematics as an art, stating that "the keys to mathematics are beauty and elegance and not dullness and technicality", and that beauty is the motivating force for mathematical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Jerry P. |title=The Art of Mathematics |date=1992 |publisher=Fawcett Columbine |isbn=0-449-90835-6 |pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; King cites the mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]]'s 1940 essay ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]''. In it, Hardy discusses why he finds two theorems of [[classical antiquity|classical times]] as first rate, namely [[Euclid]]'s proof there are infinitely many [[prime number]]s, and the proof that the square root of 2 is [[irrational number|irrational]]. King evaluates this last against Hardy's criteria for [[mathematical beauty|mathematical elegance]]: "''seriousness, depth, generality, unexpectedness, inevitability'', and ''economy''" (King's italics), and describes the proof as "aesthetically pleasing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Jerry P. |title=The Art of Mathematics |date=1992 |publisher=Fawcett Columbine |isbn=0-449-90835-6 |pages=135–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hungarian mathematician [[Paul Erdős]] agreed that mathematics possessed beauty but considered the reasons beyond explanation: "Why are numbers beautiful? It's like asking why is [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]] beautiful. If you don't see why, someone can't tell you. I ''know'' numbers are beautiful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Devlin |first=Keith |title=The Math Gene: How Mathematical Thinking Evolved And Why Numbers Are Like Gossip |publisher=Basic Books |year=2000 |page=140 |chapter=Do Mathematicians Have Different Brains? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AJdmfYEaLG4C |isbn=978-0-465-01619-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist [[Richard Wright]] argues that mathematical objects that can be constructed can be seen either "as processes to simulate phenomena" or as works of "[[computer art]]". He considers the nature of mathematical thought, observing that [[fractals]] were known to mathematicians for a century before they were recognised as such. Wright concludes by stating that it is appropriate to subject mathematical objects to any methods used to "come to terms with cultural artifacts like art, the tension between objectivity and subjectivity, their metaphorical meanings and the character of representational systems." He gives as instances an image from the [[Mandelbrot set]], an image generated by a [[cellular automaton]] algorithm, and a [[rendering (computer graphics)|computer-rendered]] image, and discusses, with reference to the [[Turing test]], whether [[algorithm]]ic products can be art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wright |first1=Richard |title=Some Issues in the Development of Computer Art as a Mathematical Art Form |journal=[[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]] |date=1988 |volume=1 |issue=Electronic Art, supplemental issue |pages=103–110 |doi=10.2307/1557919 |jstor=1557919}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sasho Kalajdzievski's ''Math and Art: An Introduction to Visual Mathematics'' takes a similar approach, looking at suitably visual mathematics topics such as tilings, fractals and hyperbolic geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kalajdzievski |first1=Sasho |title=Math and Art: An Introduction to Visual Mathematics |date=2008 |publisher=Chapman and Hall |isbn=978-1-58488-913-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Maurice Princet joined us often&amp;nbsp;... it was as an artist that he conceptualized mathematics, as an aesthetician that he invoked ''n''-dimensional continuums. He loved to get the artists interested in the [[Schlegel diagram|new views on space]] that had been opened up by [[Victor Schlegel|Schlegel]] and some others.

[[File:Objet mathematique by Man Ray.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Enneper surface]]s as [[Dadaism]]: [[Man Ray]]'s 1934 ''Objet mathematique'']]
Man Ray photographed some of the mathematical models in the [[Institut Henri Poincaré]] in Paris, including ''Objet mathematique'' (Mathematical object). He noted that this represented [[Enneper surface]]s with constant [[negative curvature]], derived from the [[pseudo-sphere]]. This mathematical foundation was important to him, as it allowed him to deny that the object was "abstract", instead claiming that it was as real as the urinal that Duchamp made into a work of art. Man Ray admitted that the object's [Enneper surface] formula "meant nothing to me, but the forms themselves were as varied and authentic as any in nature." He used his photographs of the mathematical models as figures in his series he did on [[Shakespeare]]'s plays, such as his 1934 painting ''Antony and Cleopatra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tubbs |first1=Robert |title=Mathematics in 20th-Century Literature and Art |date=2014 |publisher=Johns Hopkins |isbn=978-1-4214-1380-8 |pages=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The art reporter Jonathan Keats, writing in ''ForbesLife'', argues that Man Ray photographed "the elliptic paraboloids and conic points in the same sensual light as his pictures of [[Kiki de Montparnasse]]", and "ingeniously repurposes the cool calculations of mathematics to reveal the topology of desire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Keats |first1=Jonathon |title=See How Man Ray Made Elliptic Paraboloids Erotic At This Phillips Collection Photography Exhibit |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathonkeats/2015/02/13/see-how-man-ray-made-elliptic-paraboloids-sexy-at-this-phillips-collection-photography-exhibit/ |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=10 September 2015 |date=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twentieth century sculptors such as [[Henry Moore]], [[Barbara Hepworth]] and [[Naum Gabo]] took inspiration from mathematical models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gamwell |first1=Lynn |title=Mathematics and Art: A Cultural History |date=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=311–312 |isbn=978-0-691-16528-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore wrote of his 1938 ''Stringed Mother and Child'': "Undoubtedly the source of my stringed figures was the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]]&amp;nbsp;...

The artists [[Theo van Doesburg]] and [[Piet Mondrian]] founded the [[De Stijl]] movement, which they wanted to "establish a visual vocabulary {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} elementary geometrical forms comprehensible by all and adaptable to any discipline".&lt;ref name=tate&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/d/de-stijl |title=De Stijl |accessdate=11 September 2015 |work=Tate Glossary |publisher=The Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Curl |first=James Stevens |title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture |year=2006 |edition=Second |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-860678-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of their artworks visibly consist of ruled squares and triangles, sometimes also with circles. De Stijl artists worked in painting, furniture, interior design and architecture.&lt;ref name=tate/&gt; After the breakup of De Stijl, Van Doesburg founded the [[Avant-garde]] [[Art Concret]] movement, describing his 1929–1930 ''[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Theo_van_Doesburg_218.jpg Arithmetic Composition]'', a series of four black squares on the diagonal of a squared background, as "a structure that can be controlled, a ''definite'' surface without chance elements or individual caprice", yet "not lacking in spirit, not lacking the universal and not&amp;nbsp;... empty as there is ''everything'' which fits the internal rhythm". The art critic Gladys Fabre observes that two progressions are at work in the painting, namely the growing black squares and the alternating backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tubbs, Robert |title=Mathematics in Twentieth-Century Literature and Art: Content, Form, Meaning  |year=2014 |publisher=JHU Press |pages=44–47 |isbn=978-1-4214-1402-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematics of [[tessellation]], polyhedra, shaping of space, and self-reference provided the graphic artist [[M. C. Escher]] (1898—1972) with a lifetime's worth of materials for his woodcuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/ggescher/ggescher-main1.html |title=Tour: M.C.

Escher used irregular polygons when tiling the plane and often used reflections, [[glide reflection]]s, and [[Translation (geometry)|translations]] to obtain further patterns. Many of his works contain impossible constructions, made using geometrical objects which set up a contradiction between perspective projection and three dimensions, but are pleasant to the human sight. Escher's ''[[Ascending and Descending]]'' is based on the "[[Penrose stairs|impossible staircase]]" created by the medical scientist [[Lionel Penrose]] and his son the mathematician [[Roger Penrose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Penrose |first1=L.S. |last2=Penrose |first2=R. |title=Impossible objects: A special type of visual illusion |journal=[[British Journal of Psychology]] |year=1958 |volume=49 |pages=31–33 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1958.tb00634.x |pmid=13536303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kirousis |first1=Lefteris M. |last2=Papadimitriou |first2=Christos H. |author2-link=Christos Papadimitriou |title=The complexity of recognizing polyhedral scenes |doi=10.1109/sfcs.1985.59 |pages=175–185 |work=[[Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science|26th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science]] (FOCS 1985) |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooper |first=Martin |contribution=Tractability of Drawing Interpretation |doi=10.1007/978-1-84800-229-6_9 |isbn=978-1-84800-229-6 |pages=217–230 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |title=Line Drawing Interpretation |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Escher's many tessellation drawings were inspired by conversations with the mathematician [[H. S. M. Coxeter]] on [[hyperbolic geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Roberts, Siobhan |authorlink=Siobhan Roberts|work=King of Infinite Space: Donald Coxeter, the Man Who Saved Geometry |page=Chapter 11 |title='Coxetering' with M.C. Escher |publisher=Walker |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Escher was especially interested in five specific polyhedra, which appear many times in his work. The [[Platonic solids]]—tetrahedrons, cubes, octahedrons, dodecahedrons, and icosahedrons—are especially prominent in ''Order and Chaos'' and ''Four Regular Solids''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Escher, M.C. |title=The World of MC Escher |publisher=Random House |date=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stellated figures often reside within another figure which further distorts the viewing angle and conformation of the polyhedrons and provides a multifaceted perspective artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Escher, M.C. |author2=Vermeulen, M.W. |author3=Ford, K. |title=Escher on Escher: Exploring the Infinite |year=1989 |publisher=HN Abrams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The visual intricacy of mathematical structures such as tessellations and polyhedra have inspired a variety of mathematical artworks. [[Stewart Coffin]] makes polyhedral puzzles in rare and beautiful woods; [[George W. Hart]] works on the theory of [[polyhedra]] and sculpts objects inspired by them; [[Magnus Wenninger]] makes "especially beautiful" models of [[List of Wenninger polyhedron models|complex stellated polyhedra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Malkevitch |first1=Joseph |title=Mathematics and Art. 5.

The distorted perspectives of [[anamorphosis]] have been explored in art since the sixteenth century, when [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] incorporated a severely distorted skull in his 1533 painting ''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]''. Many artists since then, including Escher, have make use of anamorphic tricks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Marcolli, Matilde |authorlink=Matilde Marcolli |title=The notion of Space in Mathematics through the lens of Modern Art |publisher=Century Books |date=July 2016 |url=http://www.its.caltech.edu/~matilde/SpaceMathArticle.pdf |pages=23–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematics of [[topology]] has inspired several artists in modern times. The sculptor [[John Robinson (sculptor)|John Robinson]] (1935–2007) created works such as ''Gordian Knot'' and ''Bands of Friendship'', displaying [[knot theory]] in polished bronze.&lt;ref name=Emmer/&gt; Other works by Robinson explore the topology of [[torus]]es.

Modelling is far from the only possible way to illustrate mathematical concepts. Giotto's ''[[Stefaneschi Triptych]]'', 1320, illustrates [[recursion]] in the form of ''[[mise en abyme]]''; the central panel of the triptych contains, lower left, the kneeling figure of Cardinal Stefaneschi, holding up the triptych as an offering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Giotto di Bondone and assistants: Stefaneschi triptych |url=http://mv.vatican.va/3_EN/pages/PIN/PIN_Sala02_03.html |publisher=The Vatican |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giorgio Chirico]]'s [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] paintings such as his 1917 ''Great Metaphysical Interior'' explore the question of levels of representation in art by depicting paintings within his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gamwell |first1=Lynn |title=Mathematics and Art: A Cultural History |date=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=337–338 |isbn=978-0-691-16528-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art can exemplify logical paradoxes, as in some paintings by the [[surrealist]] [[René Magritte]], which can be read as [[semiotic]] jokes about confusion between levels. In ''[[The Human Condition (painting)|La condition humaine]]'' (1933), Magritte depicts an easel (on the real canvas), seamlessly supporting a view through a window which is framed by "real" curtains in the painting. Similarly, Escher's ''[[Print Gallery (M. C. Escher)|Print Gallery]]'' (1956) is a print which depicts a distorted city which contains a gallery which [[recursive]]ly contains the picture, and so ''[[ad infinitum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cooper |first1=Jonathan |title=Art and Mathematics |url=http://www.doctordada.com/art/art-and-mathematics/ |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=5 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magritte made use of spheres and cuboids to distort reality in a different way, painting them alongside an assortment of houses in his 1931 ''Mental Arithmetic'' as if they were children's building blocks, but house-sized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hofstadter |first1=Douglas R. |authorlink=Douglas Hofstadter |title=Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid |titlelink=Gödel, Escher, Bach |date=1980 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-14-028920-6 |page=627}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' observed that the "eerie toytown image" prophesied [[Modernism]]'s usurpation of "cosy traditional forms", but also plays with the human tendency to seek [[patterns in nature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hall |first1=James |title=René Magritte: The Pleasure Principle – exhibition |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jun/10/rene-magritte-pleasure-principle-exhibition |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=10 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salvador Dalí's last painting, ''[[The Swallow's Tail]]'' (1983), was part of a series inspired by [[René Thom]]'s [[catastrophe theory]].&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Elliott |editor1-last=Ades |editor1-first=Dawn |title=Dali |date=2004 |publisher=Bompiani Arte |location=Milan |pages=418–421}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish painter and sculptor [[Pablo Palazuelo]] (1916–2007) focused on the investigation of form. He developed a style that he described as the geometry of life and the geometry of all nature. Consisting of simple geometric shapes with detailed patterning and coloring, in works such as ''Angular I'' and ''Automnes'', Palazuelo expressed himself in geometric transformations.&lt;ref name=Emmer/&gt;

Artists, however, do not necessarily take geometry literally. As [[Douglas Hofstadter]] writes in his 1980 reflection on human thought, ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', by way of (among other things) the mathematics of art: "The difference between an Escher drawing and [[non-Euclidean geometry]] is that in the latter, comprehensible interpretations can be found for the undefined terms, resulting in a comprehensible total system, whereas for the former, the end result is not reconcilable with one's conception of the world, no matter how long one stares at the pictures." Hofstadter discusses the seemingly [[paradox]]ical lithograph ''Print Gallery'' by M. C. Escher; it depicts a seaside town containing an art gallery which seems to contain a painting of the seaside town, there being a "strange loop, or tangled hierarchy" to the levels of reality in the image. The artist himself, Hofstadter observes, is not seen; his reality and his relation to the lithograph are not paradoxical.&lt;ref name=GEB&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hofstadter |first1=Douglas R. |authorlink=Douglas Hofstadter |title=Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid |titlelink=Gödel, Escher, Bach |date=1980 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-394-74502-2 |pages=98–99, 690–717}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image's central void has also attracted the interest of mathematicians Bart de Smit and [[Hendrik Lenstra]], who propose that it could contain a [[Droste effect]] copy of itself, rotated and shrunk; this would be a further illustration of recursion beyond that noted by Hofstadter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=de Smit |first=B. |title=The Mathematical Structure of Escher's Print Gallery |year=2003 |journal=[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]] |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=446–451}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LenstraWebsite&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lenstra |first1=Hendrik |last2=De Smit |first2=Bart |title=Applying mathematics to Escher's Print Gallery |url=http://escherdroste.math.leidenuniv.nl/index.php?menu=intro |publisher=Leiden University |accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysis of art history===

Algorithmic analysis of images of artworks, for example using [[X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy]], can reveal information about art. Such techniques can uncover images in layers of paint later covered over by an artist; help art historians to visualize an artwork before it cracked or faded; help to tell a copy from an original, or distinguish the brushstroke style of a master from those of his apprentices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stanek |first1=Becca |title=Van Gogh and the Algorithm: How Math Can Save Art |url=http://time.com/2884058/math-art-van-gogh-duke/ |publisher=Time Magazine |accessdate=4 September 2015 |date=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sipics |first1=Michelle |title=The Van Gogh Project: Art Meets Mathematics in Ongoing International Study |url=https://www.siam.org/news/news.php?id=1568 |publisher=Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics |accessdate=4 September 2015 |date=18 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is highly unlikely, therefore, that Pollock consciously understood the fractals he was painting. Nevertheless, his introduction of fractals was deliberate. For example, the colour of the anchor layer was chosen to produce the sharpest contrast against the canvas background and this layer also occupies more canvas space than the other layers, suggesting that Pollock wanted this highly fractal anchor layer to visually dominate the painting. Furthermore, after the paintings were completed, he would dock the canvas to remove regions near the canvas edge where the pattern density was less uniform. |doi=10.1088/2058-7058/12/10/21 |volume=12 |pages=25–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Max Ernst painted [[Lissajous figures]] directly by swinging a punctured bucket of paint over a canvas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.herts.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0013/12307/WPIAAD_vol2_king.pdf |title=From Max Ernst to Ernst Mach: epistemology in art and science. |last=King |first=M. |date=2002 |accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The computer scientist [[Neil Dodgson]] investigated whether [[Bridget Riley]]'s stripe paintings could be characterised mathematically, concluding that while separation distance could "provide some characterisation" and global [[entropy]] worked on some paintings, [[autocorrelation]] failed as Riley's patterns were irregular. Local entropy worked best, and correlated well with the description given by the art critic Robert Kudielka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dodgson |first1=N. A. |title=Mathematical characterisation of Bridget Riley's stripe paintings |journal=[[Journal of Mathematics and the Arts]] |date=2012 |volume=5 |pages=1–21 |url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~nad10/pubs/jma12.pdf |quote=over the course [of] the early 1980s, Riley's patterns moved from more regular to more random (as characterised by global entropy), without losing their rhythmic structure (as characterised by local entropy).

The American mathematician [[George Birkhoff]]'s 1933 ''Aesthetic Measure'' proposes a quantitative metric of the [[Aesthetics|aesthetic quality]] of an artwork. It does not attempt to measure the connotations of a work, such as what a painting might mean, but is limited to the "elements of order" of a polygonal figure. Birkhoff first combines (as a sum) five such elements: whether there is a vertical axis of symmetry; whether there is optical equilibrium; how many rotational symmetries it has; how wallpaper-like the figure is; and whether there are unsatisfactory features such as having two vertices too close together. This metric, ''O'', takes a value between −3 and 7. The second metric, ''C'', counts elements of the figure, which for a polygon is the number of different straight lines containing at least one of its sides. Birkhoff then defines his aesthetic measure of an object's beauty as ''O/C''. This can be interpreted as a balance between the pleasure looking at the object gives, and the amount of effort needed to take it in. Birkhoff's proposal has been criticized in various ways, not least for trying to put beauty in a formula, but he never claimed to have done that.&lt;ref name=Cucker116&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=116–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stimuli to mathematical research===

{{further information|Projective geometry|Mathematics of paper folding}}

Art has sometimes stimulated the development of mathematics, as when Brunelleschi's theory of perspective in architecture and painting started a cycle of research that led to the work of [[Brook Taylor]] and [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] on the mathematical foundations of perspective drawing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Treibergs |first1=Andrejs |title=The Geometry of Perspective Drawing on the Computer |url=http://www.math.utah.edu/~treiberg/Perspect/Perspect.htm |publisher=University of Utah |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=24 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately to the mathematics of [[projective geometry]] of [[Girard Desargues]] and [[Jean-Victor Poncelet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gamwell |first1=Lynn |title=Mathematics and Art: A Cultural History |date=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=xviii |isbn=978-0-691-16528-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fraser spiral.svg|thumb|upright|The [[Fraser spiral illusion]], named for Sir James Fraser who discovered it in 1908.]]

[[Optical illusion]]s such as the [[Fraser spiral illusion|Fraser spiral]] strikingly demonstrate limitations in human visual perception, creating what the [[art historian]] [[Ernst Gombrich]] called a "baffling trick." The black and white ropes that appear to form [[spiral]]s are in fact [[concentric circle]]s. The mid-twentieth century [[Op art|Op art or optical art]] style of painting and graphics exploited such effects to create the impression of movement and flashing or vibrating patterns seen in the work of artists such as [[Bridget Riley]]&lt;!--slight overlink seems sensible here--&gt;, Spyros Horemis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=163–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Victor Vasarely]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gamwell |first1=Lynn |title=Mathematics and Art: A Cultural History |date=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=406–410 |isbn=978-0-691-16528-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sacred geometry===
{{further information|Sacred geometry|Mathematics and music}}

A strand of art from Ancient Greece onwards sees God as the geometer of the world, and the world's geometry therefore as sacred. The belief that God created the universe according to a geometric plan has ancient origins. [[Plutarch]] attributed the belief to [[Plato]], writing that "Plato said God geometrizes continually" (''Convivialium disputationum'', liber 8,2). This image has influenced Western thought ever since. The Platonic concept derived in its turn from a [[Pythagoras|Pythagorean]] notion of harmony in music, where the notes were spaced in perfect proportions, corresponding to the lengths of the lyre's strings; indeed, the Pythagoreans held that everything was arranged by Number. In the same way, in Platonic thought, the [[Platonic solid|regular or Platonic solids]] dictate the proportions found in nature, and in art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ghyka |first1=Matila |title=The Geometry of Art and Life |date=2003 |publisher=Dover |isbn=978-0-486-23542-4 |pages=ix–xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lawlor |first1=Robert |title=Sacred Geometry: Philosophy and Practice |date=1982 |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |isbn=978-0-500-81030-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Mediaeval manuscript illustration may refer to a verse in the Old Testament: "When he established the heavens I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the deep" (Proverbs 8:27), showing God drawing out the universe with a pair of compasses.&lt;ref name=Calter&gt;{{cite web |last1=Calter |first1=Paul |title=Celestial Themes in Art &amp; Architecture |url=https://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/math5.geometry/unit10/unit10.html |publisher=Dartmouth College |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1596, the mathematical astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]] modelled the universe as a set of nested Platonic solids, determining the relative sizes of the orbits of the planets.&lt;ref name=Calter/&gt; [[William Blake]]'s ''Ancient of Days'' and his painting of the physicist [[Isaac Newton]], naked and drawing with a compass, attempt to depict the contrast between the mathematically perfect spiritual world and the imperfect physical world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Thought of a Thought – Edgar Allan Poe |url=http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath522/kmath522.htm |publisher=MathPages |accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in a different way does [[Salvador Dalí]]'s 1954 ''[[Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)]]'', which depicts the cross as a [[hypercube]], representing the divine perspective with four dimensions rather than the usual three.&lt;ref name=CorpusHypercubus /&gt; In Dali's ''[[The Sacrament of the Last Supper]]'' (1955) Christ and his disciples are pictured inside a giant [[dodecahedron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Livio |first1=Mario |authorlink=Mario Livio |title=The golden ratio and aesthetics |url=https://plus.maths.org/content/golden-ratio-and-aesthetics |accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Music theory]]''' has no [[axiomatic]] foundation in modern [[mathematics]], yet the basis of musical [[sound]] can be described mathematically (in [[acoustics]]) and exhibits "a remarkable array of number properties".&lt;ref&gt;[[Reginald Smith Brindle]], ''The New Music'', Oxford University Press, 1987, pp 42-3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elements of music]] such as its [[Musical form|form]], [[rhythm]] and [[Meter (music)|metre]], the [[pitch (music)|pitches]] of its [[Musical note|notes]] and the [[Tempo (music)|tempo]] of its [[Pulse (music)|pulse]] can be related to the [[Chronometry|measurement of time]] and [[frequency]], offering ready [[Analogical models|analogies]] in [[geometry]].   

The attempt to structure and communicate new ways of composing and hearing music has led to musical applications of [[set theory]], [[abstract algebra]] and [[number theory]]. Some composers have incorporated the [[golden ratio]] and [[Fibonacci numbers]] into their work.&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Smith Brindle, ''The New Music'', Oxford University Press, 1987, Chapter 6 ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eric - Math and Music: Harmonious Connections |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/recordDetail?accno=ED388615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Though ancient Chinese, Indians, Egyptians and Mesopotamians are known to have studied the mathematical principles of sound,&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Smith Brindle, ''The New Music'', Oxford University Press, 1987, p 42&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] (in particular [[Philolaus]] and [[Archytas]])&lt;ref name="purwins"&gt;{{cite book|title=Profiles of Pitch Classes Circularity of Relative Pitch and Key-Experiments, Models, Computational Music Analysis, and Perspectives|pages=22-24|year=2005|url=http://ccrma.stanford.edu/~purwins/purwinsPhD.pdf|last1=Purwins | first1=Hendrik}}&lt;/ref&gt; of ancient Greece were the first researchers known to have investigated the expression of [[musical scale]]s in terms of numerical [[ratio]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Plato (trans. Desmond Lee) ''The Republic'', Harmondsworth Penguin 1974, page 340, note.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly the ratios of small integers. Their central doctrine was that "all nature consists of [[harmony]] arising out of numbers".&lt;ref&gt;Sir James Jeans, ''Science and Music'', Dover 1968, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time of [[Plato]], harmony was considered a fundamental branch of [[physics]], now known as [[musical acoustics]]. Early [[Indian music scale|Indian]] and [[Chinese musicology|Chinese]] theorists show similar approaches: all sought to show that the mathematical laws of [[harmonic]]s and [[rhythm]]s were fundamental not only to our understanding of the world but to human well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Alain Danielou, ''Introduction to the Study of Musical Scales'', Mushiram Manoharlal 1999, Chapter 1 ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Confucius]], like Pythagoras, regarded the small numbers 1,2,3,4 as the source of all perfection.&lt;ref&gt;Sir James Jeans, ''Science and Music'', Dover 1968, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time, rhythm and meter==

Without the boundaries of rhythmic structure – a fundamental equal and regular arrangement of [[Pulse (music)|pulse]] [[Repetition (music)|repetition]], [[Beat (music)|accent]], [[Phrase (music)|phrase]] and duration – music would not be possible.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Whittall, in ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', OUP, 2002, Article: ''Rhythm''&lt;/ref&gt; Modern musical use of terms like [[Meter (music)|meter]] and [[bar (music)|measure]] also reflects the historical importance of music, along with astronomy, in the development of counting, arithmetic and the exact measurement of time and [[Frequency|periodicity]] that is fundamental to physics.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The elements of musical form often build strict proportions or hypermetric structures (powers of the numbers 2 and 3).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Александр Виноград, Многообразие проявлений музыкального метра (LAP Lambert Academic Publishing, 2013)|url=https://www.morebooks.de/store/gb/book/%D0%9C%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%8F%D0%B2%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D0%BC%D1%83%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE-%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0/isbn/978-3-659-48005-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical form==
{{Main|Musical form}}
Musical form is the plan by which a short piece of music is extended. The term "plan" is also used in architecture, to which musical form is often compared. Like the architect, the composer must take into account the function for which the work is intended and the means available, practicing economy and making use of repetition and order.&lt;ref&gt;Imogen Holst, ''The ABC of Music'', Oxford 1963, p.100&lt;/ref&gt; The common types of form known as [[Binary form|binary]] and [[Ternary form|ternary]] ("twofold" and "threefold") once again demonstrate the importance of small integral values to the intelligibility and appeal of music.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Frequency and harmony==
[[Image:Chladini.Diagrams.for.Quadratic.Plates.svg|thumb|220px|Chladni figures produced by sound vibrations in fine powder on a square plate. ([[Ernst Chladni]], ''Acoustics'', 1802)]]
A [[musical scale]] is a discrete set of [[pitch (music)|pitch]]es used in making or describing music. The most important scale in the Western tradition is the [[diatonic scale]] but many others have been used and proposed in various historical eras and parts of the world. Each pitch corresponds to a particular frequency, expressed in hertz (Hz), sometimes referred to as cycles per second (c.p.s.). A scale has an interval of repetition, normally the [[octave]]. The [[octave]] of any pitch refers to a frequency exactly twice that of the given pitch.

Succeeding superoctaves are pitches found at frequencies four, eight, sixteen times, and so on, of the fundamental frequency. Pitches at frequencies of half, a quarter, an eighth and so on of the fundamental are called suboctaves. There is no case in musical harmony where, if a given pitch be considered accordant, that its octaves are considered otherwise. Therefore, any note and its octaves will generally be found similarly named in musical systems (e.g. all will be called '''doh''' or '''A''' or '''Sa''', as the case may be).

When expressed as a frequency bandwidth an octave '''A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''' spans from 110&amp;nbsp;Hz to 220&amp;nbsp;Hz (span=110&amp;nbsp;Hz). The next octave will span from 220&amp;nbsp;Hz to 440&amp;nbsp;Hz (span=220&amp;nbsp;Hz). The third octave spans from 440&amp;nbsp;Hz to 880&amp;nbsp;Hz (span=440&amp;nbsp;Hz) and so on. Each successive octave spans twice the frequency range of the previous octave.

[[Image:4Octaves.and.Frequencies.svg|thumb|500px|center|The exponential nature of octaves when measured on a linear frequency scale.]]
[[Image:4Octaves.and.Frequencies.Ears.svg|thumb|500px|center|This diagram presents octaves as they appear in the sense of musical intervals, equally spaced.]]

Because we are often interested in the relations or [[ratio]]s between the pitches (known as [[Interval (music)|intervals]]) rather than the precise pitches themselves in describing a scale, it is usual to refer to all the scale pitches in terms of their ratio from a particular pitch, which is given the value of one (often written '''1/1'''), generally a note which functions as the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] of the scale. For interval size comparison, [[cent (music)|cent]]s are often used.

==Tuning systems==
{{Main|Musical tuning|Musical temperament}}

There are two main families of tuning systems: [[equal temperament]] and [[just tuning]]. Equal temperament scales are built by dividing an octave into intervals which are equal on a [[logarithmic scale]], which results in perfectly evenly divided scales, but with ratios of frequencies which are [[irrational number]]s. Just scales are built by multiplying frequencies by [[rational number]]s, which results in simple ratios between frequencies, but with scale divisions that are uneven.

One major difference between equal temperament tunings and just tunings is differences in [[Beat (acoustics)|acoustical beat]] when two notes are sounded together, which affects the subjective experience of [[consonance and dissonance]]. Both of these systems, and the vast majority of music in general, have scales that repeat on the interval of every [[octave]], which is defined as frequency ratio of 2:1. In other words, every time the frequency is doubled, the given scale repeats.

Below are [[Ogg Vorbis]] files demonstrating the difference between just intonation and equal temperament. You may need to play the samples several times before you can pick the difference.
*[[Media:Comparison 550Hz - 554Hz.ogg|Two sine waves played consecutively]] – this sample has half-step at 550&amp;nbsp;Hz (C{{music|#}} in the just intonation scale), followed by a half-step at 554.37&amp;nbsp;Hz (C{{music|#}} in the equal temperament scale).
*[[Media:Major third comparison.ogg|Same two notes, set against an A440 pedal]] – this sample consists of a "[[Dyad (music)|dyad]]". The lower note is a constant A (440&amp;nbsp;Hz in either scale), the upper note is a C{{music|#}} in the equal-tempered scale for the first 1", and a C{{music|#}} in the just intonation scale for the last 1". [[Beat (acoustics)|Phase]] differences make it easier to pick the transition than in the previous sample.

===Just tunings===
[[5-limit tuning]], the most common form of [[just intonation]], is a system of tuning using tones that are [[regular number]] [[harmonic]]s of a single [[fundamental frequency]]. This was one of the scales [[Johannes Kepler]] presented in his [[Harmonices Mundi]] (1619) in connection with planetary motion. The same scale was given in transposed form by Scottish mathematician and musical theorist, Alexander Malcolm, in 1721 in his 'Treatise of Musick: Speculative, Practical and Historical',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/treatiseofmusick00malc|title=A treatise of musick, speculative, practical and historical|first1=Alexander|last1=Malcolm|first2=Mr (Joseph)|last2=Mitchell|date=25 May 2018|publisher=Edinburgh : Printed for the author|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by theorist [[Jose Wuerschmidt]] in the 20th century. A form of it is used in the music of northern India.

American composer [[Terry Riley]] also made use of the inverted form of it in his "Harp of New Albion". Just intonation gives superior results when there is little or no [[chord progression]]: voices and other instruments gravitate to just intonation whenever possible. However, it gives two different whole tone intervals (9:8 and 10:9) because a fixed tuned instrument, such as a piano, cannot change key.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Montagu, in ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', OUP 2002, Article: ''just intonation''.&lt;/ref&gt; To calculate the frequency of a note in a scale given in terms of ratios, the frequency ratio is multiplied by the tonic frequency. For instance, with a tonic of [[A440 (pitch standard)|A4]] (A natural above middle C), the frequency is 440&amp;nbsp;[[hertz|Hz]], and a justly tuned fifth above it (E5) is simply 440×(3:2) = 660&amp;nbsp;Hz.

[[Pythagorean tuning]] is tuning based only on the perfect consonances, the (perfect) octave, perfect fifth, and perfect fourth. Thus the major third is considered not a third but a ditone, literally "two tones", and is (9:8)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 81:64, rather than the independent and harmonic just 5:4 = 80:64 directly below. A whole tone is a secondary interval, being derived from two perfect fifths, (3:2)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 9:8.

The just major third, 5:4 and minor third, 6:5, are a [[syntonic comma]], 81:80, apart from their Pythagorean equivalents 81:64 and 32:27 respectively. According to [[Carl Dahlhaus|Carl]] {{harvtxt|Dahlhaus|1990|p=187}}, "the dependent third conforms to the Pythagorean, the independent third to the harmonic tuning of intervals."

Western [[common practice period|common practice music]] usually cannot be played in just intonation but requires a systematically tempered scale. The tempering can involve either the irregularities of [[well temperament]] or be constructed as a [[regular tuning and temperament|regular temperament]], either some form of [[equal temperament]] or some other regular meantone, but in all cases will involve the fundamental features of [[meantone temperament]]. For example, the root of chord '''ii''', if tuned to a fifth above the dominant, would be a major whole tone (9:8) above the tonic. If tuned a just minor third (6:5) below a just subdominant degree of 4:3, however, the interval from the tonic would equal a minor whole tone (10:9). Meantone temperament reduces the difference between 9:8 and 10:9. Their ratio, (9:8)/(10:9) = 81:80, is treated as a unison. The interval 81:80, called the [[syntonic comma]] or comma of Didymus, is the key comma of meantone temperament.

===Equal temperament tunings===
In [[equal temperament]], the octave is divided into equal parts on the logarithmic scale. While it is possible to construct equal temperament scale with any number of notes (for example, the 24-tone [[Arab tone system]]), the most common number is 12, which makes up the equal-temperament [[chromatic scale]]. In western music, a division into twelve intervals is commonly assumed unless it is specified otherwise.

For the chromatic scale, the octave is divided into twelve equal parts, each semitone (half-step) is an interval of the [[twelfth root of two]] so that twelve of these equal half steps add up to exactly an octave. With fretted instruments it is very useful to use equal temperament so that the frets align evenly across the strings. In the European music tradition, equal temperament was used for lute and guitar music far earlier than for other instruments, such as [[musical keyboard]]s. Because of this historical force, twelve-tone equal temperament is now the dominant intonation system in the Western, and much of the non-Western, world.

Equally tempered scales have been used and instruments built using various other numbers of equal intervals. The [[19 equal temperament]], first proposed and used by [[Guillaume Costeley]] in the 16th century, uses 19 equally spaced tones, offering better major thirds and far better minor thirds than normal 12-semitone equal temperament at the cost of a flatter fifth. The overall effect is one of greater consonance. [[Quarter tone|Twenty-four equal temperament]], with twenty-four equally spaced tones, is widespread in the pedagogy and [[Arabic maqam#Notation|notation]] of [[Arabic music]]. However, in theory and practice, the intonation of Arabic music conforms to [[Rational number|rational ratios]], as opposed to the [[Irrational number|irrational ratios]] of equally tempered systems.&lt;ref name="Touma 1996 22–24"&gt;{{cite book|last=Touma|first=Habib Hassan|title=The Music of the Arabs|year=1996|publisher=Amadeus Press|location=Portland, OR|isbn=0-931340-88-8|pages=22–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While any analog to the equally tempered [[quarter tone]] is entirely absent from Arabic intonation systems, analogs to a three-quarter tone, or [[neutral second]], frequently occur. These neutral seconds, however, vary slightly in their ratios dependent on [[Arabic maqam|maqam]], as well as geography. Indeed, Arabic music historian [[Habib Hassan Touma]] has written that "the breadth of deviation of this musical step is a crucial ingredient in the peculiar flavor of Arabian music. To temper the scale by dividing the octave into twenty-four quarter-tones of equal size would be to surrender one of the most characteristic elements of this musical culture."&lt;ref name="Touma 1996 22–24"/&gt;

==Connections to mathematics==
===Set theory===
{{Main|Set theory (music)}}
Musical set theory uses the language of mathematical [[set theory]] in an elementary way to organize musical objects and describe their relationships. To analyze the structure of a piece of (typically atonal) music using musical set theory, one usually starts with a set of tones, which could form motives or chords. By applying simple operations such as [[transposition (music)|transposition]] and [[Melodic inversion|inversion]], one can discover deep structures in the music. Operations such as transposition and inversion are called [[isometries]] because they preserve the intervals between tones in a set.

===Abstract algebra===
{{Main|Abstract algebra}}
Expanding on the methods of musical set theory, some theorists have used abstract algebra to analyze music. For example, the pitch classes in an equally tempered octave form an [[abelian group]] with 12 elements. It is possible to describe [[just intonation]] in terms of a [[free abelian group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Algebra of Tonal Functions. |url=http://sonantometry.blogspot.com/2007_05_01_archive.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harmonic Limit|url=https://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Harmonic+Limit||}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transformational theory]] is a branch of music theory developed by [[David Lewin]]. The theory allows for great generality because it emphasizes transformations between musical objects, rather than the musical objects themselves.

Theorists have also proposed musical applications of more sophisticated algebraic concepts. The theory of regular temperaments has been extensively developed with a wide range of sophisticated mathematics, for example by associating each regular temperament with a rational point on a [[Grassmannian]].

The [[chromatic scale]] has a free and transitive action of the [[cyclic group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/12\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, with the action being defined via [[transposition (music)|transposition]] of notes. So the chromatic scale can be thought of as a [[torsor]] for the group &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/12\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Real and complex analysis===
Real and complex analysis have also been made use of, for instance by applying the theory of the [[Riemann zeta function]] to the study of equal divisions of the octave.[https://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/The+Riemann+Zeta+Function+and+Tuning]

:''See also [[Naive set theory]] for the mathematical topic.''
[[File:NaiveSetTheory.jpg|thumb|First edition]]
'''''Naive Set Theory''''' is a [[mathematics]] textbook by [[Paul Halmos]] providing an undergraduate introduction to [[set theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Review of ''Naive Set Theory'' by H. Mirkil (April 1961), ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'' 68 (4): 392, {{doi|10.2307/2311615}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally published by ''Van Nostrand'' in 1960,&lt;ref name="Rieger"/&gt; it was reprinted in the [[Springer-Verlag]] [[Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics]] series in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{MR|0453532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the title states that it is naive, which is usually taken to mean without [[axiom]]s, the book does introduce all the axioms of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC set theory]] (except the [[Axiom of Foundation]]), and gives correct and rigorous definitions for basic objects.&lt;ref name="Rieger"&gt;Review of ''Naive Set Theory'', L. Rieger, {{MR|0114756}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Review of ''Naive Set Theory'', Alfons Borgers (July 1969), ''[[Journal of Symbolic Logic]]'' 34 (2): 308, {{doi|10.2307/2271138}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Where it differs from a "true" [[axiomatic set theory]] book is its character: there are no discussions of axiomatic minutiae, and there is next to nothing about advanced topics like [[large cardinal]]s. Instead, it tries to be intelligible to someone who has never thought about set theory before.

Halmos later stated that it was the fastest book he wrote, taking about six months, and that the book "wrote itself".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Paul Halmos: celebrating 50 years of mathematics | editor1-first=John H.|editor1-last=Ewing | editor2-first=Frederick W.|editor2-last=Gehring | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | year=1991 | isbn=0-387-97509-8 |at=Interview of Halmos with Donald J. Albers, p.&amp;nbsp;16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xnv5fXu1vFoC&amp;pg=PA16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Absence of the Axiom of Foundation==
As noted above, the book omits the [[Axiom of Foundation]].  Halmos repeatedly dances around the issue of whether or not a set can contain itself.
*p. 1: "a set may also be an element of some ''other'' set" (emphasis added)
*p. 3: "is &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; ∈ &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; ever true?  It is certainly not true of any reasonable set that anyone has ever seen."
*p. 6: "&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; ∈ &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; ... unlikely, but not obviously impossible"
But Halmos does let us prove that there are certain sets that cannot contain themselves.
*p. 44: Halmos lets us prove that &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; ∉ &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;.  For if &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; ∈ &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; − {&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;} would still be a successor set, because &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; ≠ ∅ and &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is not the successor of any natural number.  But &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is not a subset of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; − {&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;}, contradicting the definition of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; as a subset of every successor set.
*p. 47: Halmos proves the lemma that "no natural number is a subset of any of its elements."  This lets us prove that no natural number can contain itself.  For if &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; ∈ &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a natural number, then &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; ⊂ &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; ∈ &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, which contradicts the lemma.
*p. 75: "An ''ordinal number'' is defined as a well ordered set &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;s(\xi) = \xi&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;; here &lt;math&gt;s(\xi)&lt;/math&gt; is, as before, the initial segment &lt;math&gt;\{\eta&lt;/math&gt; ∈ &lt;math&gt;\alpha:&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; &lt; &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;}."  The well ordering is defined as follows: if &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; are elements of an ordinal number &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; &lt; &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; means &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; ∈ &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; (pp. 75-76).  By his choice of the symbol &lt; instead of ≤, Halmos implies that the well ordering &lt; is strict (pp. 55-56).  This definition of &lt; makes it impossible to have &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; ∈ &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; is an element of an ordinal number.  That's because &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; ∈ &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; means &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; &lt; &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;, which implies &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; ≠ &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; (because &lt; is strict), which is impossible.
*p. 75: the above definition of an ordinal number also makes it impossible to have &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; ∈ &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is an ordinal number.  That's because &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; ∈ &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; = s(&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;).  This gives us &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; ∈ &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; = s(&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;) = &lt;math&gt;\{\eta&lt;/math&gt; ∈ &lt;math&gt;\alpha:&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; &lt; &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;}, which implies &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; &lt; &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, which implies &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; ≠ &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; (because &lt; is strict), which is impossible.

==Errata==
*p. 73, line 19: "for each z in X" should be "for each a in X".
*p. 75, line 3: "if and only if x ∈ F(n)" should be "if and only if x = {b: S(n, b)}".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5970">In [[science]], a '''parameter space''' is the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all possible combinations of values for all the different [[parameter]]s contained in a particular [[mathematical model]]. The ranges of values of the parameters may form the axes of a [[Plot (graphics)|plot]], and particular outcomes of the model may be plotted against these axes to illustrate how different regions of the parameter space produce different types of behaviour in the model.

Often the parameters are inputs of a [[function (mathematics)|function]], in which case the technical term for the parameter space is [[domain of a function]].

Parameter spaces are particularly useful for describing families of [[probability distribution]]s that depend on parameters. More generally in science, the term parameter space is used to describe experimental variables. For example, the concept has been used in the science of [[soccer]] in the article "Parameter space for successful soccer kicks." In the study, "Success rates are determined through the use of four-dimensional parameter space volumes."&lt;ref&gt;Brandon G. Cook &amp; John Eric Goff (2006) [http://stacks.iop.org/EJP/27/865 Parameter Space for Successful Soccer Kicks] [[European Journal of Physics]] 27:865.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of [[statistics]], parameter spaces form the background for [[parameter estimation]].
As Ross describes in his book:&lt;ref&gt;Gavin J.S. Ross (1990) ''Nonlinear Estimation'', page 94, [[Springer-Verlag]]&lt;/ref&gt;
:Parameter space is a subset of p-dimensional space consisting of the set of values of &amp;Theta; which are allowable in a particular model. The values may sometimes be constrained, say to the positive quadrant or the unit square, or in case of symmetry, to the triangular region where, say &lt;math&gt;\Theta_1 \le \Theta_2.&lt;/math&gt;

The idea of intentionally truncating the parameter space has also been advanced elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[[Constance van Eeden|Van Eeden, C.]] (2006)[https://books.google.com/books?id=m-MePzncfyAC&amp;pg=PA3 ''Restricted parameter space estimation problems: admissibility and minimaxity properties''], Springer {{ISBN|0-387-33747-4}} (p. 2)  "Gains in the minimax value can be very substantial when the parameter space is bounded."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
* A simple model of health deterioration after developing [[lung cancer]] could include the two parameters gender&lt;ref name=one&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gasperino |first=J. |author2=Rom, W. N. |year=2004 |title=Gender and lung cancer |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525730411701863 |journal=Clinical Lung Cancer |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=353–359 |doi= 10.3816/CLC.2004.n.013|pmid= |bibcode=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and smoker/non-smoker, in which case the parameter space is the following set of four possibilities: {{math|{(Male, Smoker), (Male, Non-smoker), (Female, Smoker), (Female, Non-smoker)} }}.
* The [[logistic map]] &lt;math&gt; x_{n+1} = r x_n (1-x_n) &lt;/math&gt; has one parameter, ''r'', which can take any positive value. The parameter space is therefore [[positive real numbers]]. 
:For some values of ''r'', this function ends up cycling round a few values, or fixed on one value. These long-term values can be plotted against ''r'' in a [[bifurcation diagram]] to show the different behaviours of the function for different values of ''r''.

* In a [[sine wave]] model &lt;math&gt;y(t) = A \cdot \sin(\omega t + \phi),&lt;/math&gt; the parameters are [[amplitude]] ''A'' &gt; 0, [[angular frequency]] ω &gt; 0, and [[phase (waves)|phase]] φ ∈ S&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus the parameter space is &lt;math&gt;R^+ \times R^+ \times S^1 .&lt;/math&gt;

* In [[complex dynamics]], the parameter space is the [[complex plane]] '''C''' = { ''z'' = ''x'' + ''y'' i : x, y ∈ '''R''' }, where i&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = &amp;minus;1.

:The famous [[Mandelbrot set]] is a [[subset]] of this parameter space, consisting of the points in the complex plane which give a  [[bounded set]] of numbers when a particular [[iterated function]] is repeatedly applied from that starting point. The remaining points, which are not in the set, give an unbounded set of numbers (they tend to infinity) when this function is repeatedly applied from that starting point.

==History==
Parameter space contributed to the liberation of [[geometry]] from the confines of [[three-dimensional space]]. For instance, the parameter space of [[sphere (geometry)|spheres]] in three dimensions, has four dimensions—three for the sphere center and another for the radius.  According to [[Dirk Struik]], it was the book ''Neue Geometrie des Raumes'' (1849) by [[Julius Plücker]] that showed
:...geometry need not solely be based on points as basic elements. Lines, planes, circles, spheres can all be used as the elements (''Raumelemente'') on which a geometry can be based. This fertile conception threw new light on both synthetic and algebraic geometry and created new forms of duality. The number of dimensions of a particular form of geometry could now be any positive number, depending on the number of parameters necessary to define the "element".&lt;ref name=DS&gt;[[Dirk Struik]] (1967) ''A Concise History of Mathematics'', 3rd edition, [[Dover Books]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|165}}
The requirement for higher dimensions is illustrated by [[Plücker coordinates|Plücker's line geometry]]. Struik writes
:[Plücker's] geometry of lines in three-space could be considered as a four-dimensional geometry, or, as [[Felix Klein|Klein]] has stressed, as the geometry of a four-dimensional [[quadric]] in a five-dimensional space.&lt;ref name=DS/&gt;{{rp|168}}
Thus the [[Klein quadric]] describes the parameters of lines in space.

{{Platonism}}
'''Platonic idealism''' usually refers to [[Plato]]'s [[theory of forms]] or doctrine of ideas.

==Overview==
Some commentators hold that Plato argued that [[truth]] is an abstraction. In other words, we are urged to believe that [[Plato]]'s theory of ideals is an [[abstraction]], divorced from the so-called external world, of modern European philosophy, despite the fact Plato taught that ideals are ultimately real, and different from non-ideal things—indeed, he argued for a distinction between the ideal and non-ideal realm.

These commentators speak thus: for example, a particular tree, with a branch or two missing, possibly alive, possibly dead, and with the initials of two lovers carved into its bark, is distinct from the abstract form of Tree-ness.&lt;ref name=caps/&gt; A Tree&lt;ref name=caps/&gt; is the ideal that each of us holds that allows us to identify the imperfect reflections of trees all around us.

Plato gives the [[The divided line of Plato| divided line]] as an outline of this theory.  At the top of the line, the [[Form of the Good]]&lt;ref name="caps"&gt;
  In the field of philosophy, it has been customary to capitalize
  words that are concept names, such as "Search for Truth" (or
  "Goodness" or "Man"). Common ideals are Truth, Kindness, and
  Beauty. Such capitalization is not common in science, and
  hence, concepts such as "accuracy" and "gravity" are not often
  capitalized in scientific writing, but could be
  capitalized in philosophical papers.
&lt;/ref&gt;
is found, directing everything underneath.

Some contemporary linguistic philosophers construe "Platonism" to mean the proposition that [[universals]] exist independently of particulars (a universal is anything that can be predicated of a particular).

Platonism is an ancient school of [[philosophy]], founded by Plato; at the beginning, this school had a physical existence at a site just outside the walls of [[History of Athens|Athens]] called the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]], as well as the intellectual unity of a shared approach to philosophizing.

Platonism is usually divided into three periods:

# Early [[Platonism]]
# [[Middle Platonism]]
# [[Neoplatonism]]

Plato's students used the [[Hypomnema|hypomnemata]] as the foundation to his philosophical approach to [[knowledge]]. The hypomnemata constituted a material memory of things read, heard, or thought, thus offering these as an accumulated treasure for rereading and later meditation. For the Neoplatonist they also formed a raw material for the writing of more systematic treatises in which were given arguments and means by which to struggle against some defect (such as anger, envy, gossip, flattery) or to overcome some difficult circumstance (such as a mourning, an exile, downfall, disgrace).

Platonism is considered to be, in mathematics departments the world over, the predominant [[philosophy of mathematics]], especially regarding the [[foundations of mathematics]].

One statement of this philosophy is the thesis that mathematics is not created but discovered.
A lucid statement of this is found in an essay written by the British mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]] in defense of pure mathematics. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanscientist.org/article/in-defense-of-pure-mathematics|title=In Defense of Pure Mathematics|date=2017-02-06|work=American Scientist|access-date=2018-06-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Mathematician_s_Apology.html?id=beImvXUGD-MC|title=A Mathematician's Apology|last=Hardy|first=G. H.|date=1992-01-31|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521427067|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The absence in this thesis of clear distinction between mathematical and non-mathematical "creation" leaves open the inference that it applies to allegedly creative endeavors in art, music, and literature.

It is unknown if Plato's ideas of [[idealism]] have some earlier origin, but Plato held [[Pythagoras]] in high regard, and Pythagoras as well as his followers in the movement known as [[Pythagoreanism]] claimed the world was literally built up from numbers, an abstract, absolute form.

The term ''Polish notation'' is sometimes taken (as the opposite of ''infix notation'') to also include reverse Polish notation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Data structures and other objects using Java |edition=3rd |author-first=Michael |author-last=Main |publisher=[[Pearson PLC]] [[Addison-Wesley]] |date=2006 |isbn=978-0-321-37525-4 |page=334 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tok_AQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Polish notation is used as a syntax for mathematical expressions by [[programming language]] [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]]s, it is readily parsed into [[abstract syntax tree]]s and can, in fact, define a [[Bijection|one-to-one representation]] for the same. Because of this, [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] ([[#Implementations|see below]]) and related programming languages define their entire syntax in terms of prefix notation (and others use postfix notation).

A quotation from a paper by [[Jan Łukasiewicz]], ''Remarks on Nicod's Axiom and on "Generalizing Deduction"'', page 180, states how the notation was invented:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I came upon the idea of a parenthesis-free notation in 1924. I used that notation for the first time in my article Łukasiewicz(1), p. 610, footnote.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The reference cited by Łukasiewicz is apparently a lithographed report in [[Polish language|Polish]]. The referring paper by Łukasiewicz ''Remarks on Nicod's Axiom and on "Generalizing Deduction"'' was reviewed by [[Henry Pogorzelski|Henry A. Pogorzelski]] in the ''Journal of Symbolic Logic'' in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Pogorzelski, Henry A., [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2269644 "Reviewed work(s): Remarks on Nicod's Axiom and on "Generalizing Deduction" by Jan Łukasiewicz; Jerzy Słupecki; Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe"], ''The Journal of Symbolic Logic'', Vol. 30, No. 3 (September 1965), pp. 376–377. The original paper by Łukasiewicz was published in [[Warsaw]] in 1961 in a volume edited by Jerzy Słupecki.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heinrich Behmann]], editor in 1924 of the article of [[Moses Schönfinkel]]&lt;ref&gt;"Über die Bausteine der mathematischen Logik", ''Mathematische Annalen'' '''92''', pages 305-316. Translated by Stefan Bauer-Mengelberg as "On the building blocks of mathematical logic" in [[Jean van Heijenoort]], 1967. ''A Source Book in Mathematical Logic, 1879-1931''. [[Harvard University Press]]: 355-66.&lt;/ref&gt; already had the idea of eliminating parentheses in logic formulas.

[[Alonzo Church]] mentions this notation in his classic book on [[mathematical logic]] as worthy of remark in notational systems even contrasted to [[Alfred North Whitehead|Alfred Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]]'s logical notational exposition and work in [[Principia Mathematica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-first=Alonzo |author-last=Church |title=Introduction to Mathematical Logic |location=Princeton, New Jersey, USA |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |date=1944 |page=38 |quote=[…] Worthy of remark is the parenthesis-free notation of Jan Łukasiewicz. In this the letters N, A, C, E, K are used in the roles of negation, disjunction, implication, equivalence, conjunction respectively. […]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Łukasiewicz's 1951 book, ''Aristotle's Syllogistic from the Standpoint of Modern Formal Logic'', he mentions that the principle of his notation was to write the [[Function symbol|functor]]s before the [[Argument of a function|argument]]s to avoid brackets and that he had employed his notation in his logical papers since 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Łukasiewicz, (1951) ''Aristotle's Syllogistic from the Standpoint of Modern Formal Logic'', Chapter IV "Aristotle's System in Symbolic Form" (section on "Explanation of the Symbolism"), p. 78 and on.&lt;/ref&gt; He then goes on to cite, as an example, a 1930 paper he wrote with [[Alfred Tarski]] on the [[Propositional calculus|sentential calculus]].&lt;ref&gt;Łukasiewicz, Jan; Tarski, Alfred, "Untersuchungen über den Aussagenkalkül" ["Investigations into the sentential calculus"], ''Comptes Rendus des Séances de la Société des Sciences et des Lettres de Varsovie'', Vol. 23 (1930) Cl. III, pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

[…]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polish notation has since found a place in [[computer science]].

==Explanation==
The expression for adding the numbers 1 and 2 is written in Polish notation as {{nowrap|+ 1 2}} (pre-fix), rather than as {{nowrap|1 + 2}} (in-fix). In more complex expressions, the operators still precede their operands, but the operands may themselves be expressions including again operators and their operands. For instance, the expression that would be written in conventional infix notation as
: {{nowrap|(5 − 6) × 7}}
can be written in Polish notation as
: {{nowrap|× (− 5 6) 7}}
Assuming a given [[arity]] of all involved operators (here the "−" denotes the binary operation of subtraction, not the unary function of sign-change), any well formed prefix representation thereof is unambiguous, and brackets within the prefix expression are unnecessary. As such, the above expression can be further simplified to
: {{nowrap|× − 5 6 7}}

The processing of the product is deferred until its two operands are available (i.e., 5 minus 6, and 7). As with ''any'' notation, the innermost expressions are evaluated first, but in Polish notation this "innermost-ness" can be conveyed by the sequence of operators and operands rather than by bracketing.

In the conventional infix notation parentheses are required to override the standard [[Order of operations|precedence rules]], since, referring to the above example, moving them
: {{nowrap|5 − (6 × 7)}}
or removing them
: {{nowrap|5 − 6 × 7}}
changes the meaning and the result of the expression. This version is written in Polish notation as
: {{nowrap|− 5 × 6 7}}.

When dealing with non-commutative operations, like division or subtraction, it is necessary to coordinate the sequential arrangement of the operands with the definition of how the operator takes its arguments, i.e., from left to right.  For example, {{nowrap|÷ 10 5}}, with 10 left to 5, has the meaning of 10 ÷ 5 (read as "divide 10 by 5"), or {{nowrap|- 7 6}}, with 7 left to 6, has the meaning of 7 - 6 (read as "subtract from 7 the operand 6").

==Evaluation algorithm==
Prefix/postfix notation is especially popular for its innate ability to express the intended order of operations without the need for parentheses and other precedence rules, as are usually employed with [[infix notation]]. Instead, the notation uniquely indicates which operator to evaluate first. The operators are assumed to have a fixed [[arity]] each, and all necessary operands are assumed to be explicitly given. A valid prefix expression always starts with an operator and ends with an operand. Evaluation can either proceed from left to right, or in the opposite direction. Starting at the left, the input string, consisting of tokens denoting operators or operands, is pushed token for token on a [[Stack (abstract data type)|stack]], until the top entries of the stack contain the number of operands that fits to the top most operator (immediately beneath). This group of tokens at the stacktop (the last stacked operator and the according number of operands) is replaced by the result of executing the operator on these/this operand(s). Then the processing of the input continues in this manner. The rightmost operand in a valid prefix expression thus empties the stack, except for the result of evaluating the whole expression. When starting at the right, the pushing of tokens is performed similarly, just the evaluation is triggered by an operator, finding the appropriate number of operands that fits its arity already at the stacktop. Now the leftmost token of a valid prefix expression must be an operator, fitting to the number of operands in the stack, which again yields the result. As can be seen from the description, a [[Deterministic pushdown automaton|push-down store]] with no capability of arbitrary stack inspection suffices to implement this [[parsing]].

The above sketched stack manipulation works –with mirrored input– also for expressions in [[reverse Polish notation]].

==Polish notation for logic==
The table below shows the core of [[Jan Łukasiewicz]]'s notation for [[sentential logic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Volume 8 |author-first=Edward |author-last=Craig |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |date=1998 |isbn=9780415073103 |page=496 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mxpFwcAplaAC&amp;pg=PA496}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some letters in the Polish notation table stand for particular words in [[Polish language|Polish]], as shown:

Note that the quantifiers ranged over propositional values in Łukasiewicz's work on many-valued logics.

[[Józef Maria Bocheński|Bocheński]] introduced a system of Polish notation that names all 16 binary [[logical connective|connectives]] of classical propositional logic. For classical propositional logic, it is a compatible extension of the notation of Łukasiewicz. But the notations are incompatible in the sense that Bocheński uses L and M (for nonimplication and converse nonimplication) in propositional logic and Łukasiewicz uses L and M in modal logic.&lt;ref&gt;Bocheński, Józef Maria (1959). A Precis of Mathematical Logic, translated by Otto Bird from the French and German editions, D. Reidel: Dordrecht, Holland.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementations==
Prefix notation has seen wide application in [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] [[s-expressions]], where the brackets are required since the operators in the language are themselves data ([[first-class function]]s). Lisp functions may also be [[Variadic function|variadic]]. The [[Tcl]] programming language, much like Lisp also uses Polish notation through the mathop library. The Ambi&lt;ref&gt;https://code.google.com/p/ambi/&lt;/ref&gt; programming language uses Polish notation for arithmetic operations and program construction.

Postfix notation is used in many [[stack-oriented programming language]]s like [[PostScript]] and [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]]. [[CoffeeScript]] syntax also allows functions to be called using prefix notation, while still supporting the unary postfix syntax common in other languages.

The number of return values of an expression equals the difference between the number of operands in an expression and the total arity of the operators minus the total number of return values of the operators.

Polish notation, usually in postfix form, is the chosen notation of certain [[calculator]]s, notably from [[HP calculators|Hewlett-Packard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://h20331.www2.hp.com/Hpsub/downloads/35_02_RPN_Mode.pdf |title=HP calculators {{!}} '''HP 35s''' RPN Mode |publisher=[[Hewlett-Packard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a lower level, postfix operators are used by some [[stack machines]] such as the [[Burroughs large systems]].

{{numeral systems}}
'''Positional notation''' or '''place-value notation''' is a method of representing or encoding [[number]]s. Positional notation is distinguished from other notations (such as [[Roman numerals]]) for its use of the same symbol for the different [[orders of magnitude]] (for example, the "ones place", "tens place", "hundreds place"). This greatly simplified [[arithmetic]], leading to the rapid spread of the notation across the world.

With the use of a [[radix point]] (decimal point in base-10), the notation can be extended to include [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]s and the numeric expansions of [[real number]]s.

The [[Babylonian Numerals|Babylonian numeral system]], base-60, was the first positional system developed, and its influence is present today in the way time and angles are counted in tallies related to 60, like 60 minutes in an hour, 360 degrees in a circle. The [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]], [[decimal representation|base-10]], is the most commonly used system in the world today for most calculations. The [[binary number|binary numeral system]], base-2, is straightforwardly implemented in [[digital electronics|digital electronic circuitry]] and used by almost all computer systems and electronics for calculations and representations.

==History==
[[File:abacus 6.png|thumb|[[Suanpan]] (the number represented in the picture is 6,302,715,408)]]
Today, the base-10 ([[decimal]]) system, which is likely motivated by counting with the ten [[finger]]s, is ubiquitous. Other bases have been used in the past, and some continue to be used today. For example, the [[Babylonian numerals|Babylonian numeral system]], credited as the first positional numeral system, was [[base-60]], but it lacked a real 0 value. Zero was indicated by a space between sexagesimal numerals. By 300&amp;nbsp;BC, a punctuation symbol (two slanted wedges) was co-opted as a [[Free variables and bound variables|placeholder]] in the same system. In a tablet unearthed at [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]] (dating from about 700&amp;nbsp;BC), the scribe Bêl-bân-aplu wrote his zeros with three hooks, rather than two slanted wedges.&lt;ref name="multiref1"&gt;Kaplan, Robert. (2000). ''The Nothing That Is: A Natural History of Zero''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The Babylonian placeholder was not a true zero because it was not used alone. Nor was it used at the end of a number. Thus numbers like 2 and 120 (2×60), 3 and 180 (3×60), 4 and 240 (4×60), looked the same because the larger numbers lacked a final sexagesimal placeholder. Only context could differentiate them.

The polymath [[Archimedes]] (ca. 287–212 BC) invented a decimal positional system in his [[The Sand Reckoner|Sand Reckoner]] which was based on 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Greek numerals"&gt;[http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Greek_numbers.html Greek numerals]&lt;/ref&gt; and later led the German mathematician [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] to lament what heights science would have already reached in his days if Archimedes had fully realized the potential of his ingenious discovery.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Menninger (mathematics)|Menninger, Karl]]: ''Zahlwort und Ziffer. Eine Kulturgeschichte der Zahl'', Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht, 3rd. ed., 1979, {{isbn|3-525-40725-4}}, pp. 150-153&lt;/ref&gt;

Before positional notation became standard, simple additive systems ([[sign-value notation]]) such as [[Roman numerals]] were used, and accountants in ancient Rome and during the Middle Ages used the [[abacus]] or stone counters to do arithmetic.&lt;ref&gt;Ifrah, page 187&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chounumerals.svg|thumb|right|280px|The world's earliest positional decimal system&lt;br&gt; Upper row vertical form&lt;br&gt; Lower row horizontal form]]
[[Counting rods]] and most [[abacus]]es have been used to represent numbers in a positional numeral system. With counting rods or abacus to perform arithmetic operations, the writing of the starting, intermediate and final values of a calculation could easily be done with a simple additive system in each position or column. This approach required no memorization of tables (as does positional notation) and could produce practical results quickly. For four centuries (from the 13th to the 16th) there was strong disagreement between those who believed in adopting the positional system in writing numbers and those who wanted to stay with the additive-system-plus-abacus. Although electronic calculators have largely replaced the abacus, the latter continues to be used in Japan and other Asian countries.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

After the [[French Revolution]] (1789-1799), the new French government promoted the extension of the decimal system.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of those pro-decimal efforts—such as [[decimal time]] and the [[decimal calendar]]—were unsuccessful.
Other French pro-decimal efforts—currency [[decimalisation]] and the [[metrication]] of weights and measures—spread widely out of France to almost the whole world.

=== History of positional fractions ===
{{Main|Decimal}}

J. Lennart Berggren notes that positional decimal fractions were used for the first time by Arab mathematician [[Abu'l-Hasan al-Uqlidisi]] as early as the 10th century.&lt;ref name=Berggren&gt;{{cite book | first=J. Lennart | last=Berggren | title=The Mathematics of Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, India, and Islam: A Sourcebook | chapter=Mathematics in Medieval Islam | publisher=Princeton University Press | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-691-11485-9 | page=518 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish mathematician [[Immanuel Bonfils]] used decimal fractions around 1350, anticipating [[Simon Stevin]], but did not develop any notation to represent them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Solomon Gandz|Gandz, S.]]: The invention of the decimal fractions and the application of the exponential calculus by Immanuel Bonfils of Tarascon (c. 1350), Isis 25 (1936), 16–45.&lt;/ref&gt; The Persian mathematician [[Jamshīd al-Kāshī]] claimed to have discovered decimal fractions himself in the 15th century.&lt;ref name=Berggren /&gt;[[Al Khwarizmi]] introduced fractions to Islamic countries in the early 9th century; his fraction presentation was an exact copy of traditional Chinese mathematical fractions from [[Sunzi Suanjing]].&lt;ref name=Lam&gt;[[Lam Lay Yong]], "The Development of Hindu-Arabic and Traditional Chinese Arithmetic", ''Chinese Science'', 1996 p38, Kurt Vogel notation&lt;/ref&gt; This form of fraction with numerator on top and denominator at bottom without a horizontal bar was also used by 10th century [[Abu'l-Hasan al-Uqlidisi]] and 15th century [[Jamshīd al-Kāshī]]'s work "Arithmetic Key".&lt;ref name=Lam/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lam Lay Yong]], "A Chinese Genesis, Rewriting the history of our numeral system", ''Archive for History of Exact Science'' 38: 101–108.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;div style="float: right;"&gt;[[File:Stevin-decimal notation.svg]]&lt;/div&gt;
A forerunner of modern European decimal notation was introduced by [[Simon Stevin]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref name=van&gt;{{Cite book | author = [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|B. L. van der Waerden]] | year = 1985 | title = A History of Algebra. From Khwarizmi to Emmy Noether | publisher = Springer-Verlag | place = Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
A key argument against the positional system was its susceptibility to easy [[cheque fraud|fraud]] by simply putting a number at the beginning or end of a quantity, thereby changing (e.g.) 100 into 5100, or 100 into 1000. Modern [[cheque]]s require a natural language spelling of an amount, as well as the decimal amount itself, to prevent such fraud. For the same reason the Chinese also use natural language numerals, for example 100 is written as 壹佰, which can never be forged into 壹仟(1000) or 伍仟壹佰(5100).

Many of the advantages claimed for the metric system could be realized by any consistent positional notation.
[[Duodecimal#Advocacy and "dozenalism"|Dozenal advocates]] say dozenal has several advantages over decimal, although the [[switching cost]] appears to be high.

===Base of the numeral system===
In [[numeral system|mathematical numeral systems]] the base or radix is usually the number of unique [[Numerical digit|digits]], including zero, that a positional numeral system uses to represent numbers.  For example, for the decimal system the radix is 10, because it uses the 10 digits from 0 through 9. When a number "hits" 9, the next number will not be another different symbol, but a "1" followed by a "0". In binary, the radix is 2, since after it hits "1", instead of "2" or another written symbol, it jumps straight to "10", followed by "11" and "100".

The highest symbol of a positional numeral system usually has the value one less than the value of the base of that numeral system. The standard positional numeral systems differ from one another only in the base they use.

The base is an integer that is greater than 1 (or less than negative 1), since a radix of zero would not have any digits, and a radix of 1 would only have the zero digit. Negative bases are rarely used. In a system with a negative radix, numbers may have many different possible representations.

(In certain [[non-standard positional numeral systems]], including [[bijective numeration]], the definition of the base or the allowed digits deviates from the above.)

In base-10 (decimal) positional notation, there are 10 [[decimal digit]]s and the number
:&lt;math&gt;2506 = (2 \times 10^3) + (5 \times 10^2) + (0 \times 10^1) + (6 \times 10^0)&lt;/math&gt;.
In base-16 ([[hexadecimal]]), there are 16 hexadecimal digits (0–9 and A–F) and the number
:&lt;math&gt;171\mathrm{B} = (1 \times 16^3) + (7 \times 16^2) + (1 \times 16^1) + (\mathrm{B} \times 16^0) &lt;/math&gt; (where B represents the number eleven as a single symbol)

In general, in base-''b'', there are ''b'' digits and the number
:&lt;math&gt;a_3 a_2 a_1 a_0 = (a_3 \times b^3) + (a_2 \times b^2) + (a_1 \times b^1) + (a_0 \times b^0) &lt;/math&gt; (Note that &lt;math&gt;a_3 a_2 a_1 a_0&lt;/math&gt; represents a sequence of digits, not [[multiplication]])

===Notation===
When describing base in [[mathematical notation]], the letter ''b'' is generally used as a [[symbol]] for this concept, so, for a [[Binary numeral system|binary]] system, ''b'' [[equality (mathematics)|equals]] 2. Another common way of expressing the base is writing it as a '''decimal''' subscript after the number that is being represented (this notation is used in this article). 1111011&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; implies that the number 1111011 is a base-2 number, equal to 123&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; (a [[decimal notation]] representation), 173&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; ([[octal]]) and 7B&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; ([[hexadecimal]]). In books and articles, when using initially the written abbreviations of number bases, the base is not subsequently printed: it is assumed that binary 1111011 is the same as 1111011&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The base ''b'' may also be indicated by the phrase "base-''b''". So binary numbers are "base-2"; octal numbers are "base-8"; decimal numbers are "base-10"; and so on.

To a given radix ''b'' the set of digits {0, 1, ..., ''b''−2, ''b''−1} is called the standard set of digits. Thus, binary numbers have digits {0, 1}; decimal numbers have digits {{nowrap|{0, 1, 2, ..., 8, 9};}} and so on. Therefore, the following are notational errors: 52&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 2&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 1A&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;. (In all cases, one or more digits is not in the set of allowed digits for the given base.)

===Exponentiation===
Positional numeral systems work using [[exponentiation]] of the base. A digit's value is the digit multiplied by the value of its place. Place values are the number of the base raised to the ''n''th power, where ''n'' is the number of other digits between a given digit and the [[radix point]]. If a given digit is on the left hand side of the radix point (i.e. its value is an [[integer]]) then ''n'' is positive or zero; if the digit is on the right hand side of the radix point (i.e., its value is fractional) then ''n'' is negative.

As an example of usage, the number 465 in its respective base ''b'' (which must be at least base 7 because the highest digit in it is 6) is equal to:
:&lt;math&gt;4\times b^2 + 6\times b^1 + 5\times b^0&lt;/math&gt;

If the number 465 was in base-10, then it would equal:
:&lt;math&gt;4\times 10^2 + 6\times 10^1 + 5\times 10^0 = 4\times 100 + 6\times 10 + 5\times 1 = 465&lt;/math&gt;
(465&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; = 465&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;)

If however, the number were in base 7, then it would equal:
:&lt;math&gt;4\times 7^2 + 6\times 7^1 + 5\times 7^0 = 4\times 49 + 6\times 7 + 5\times 1 = 243&lt;/math&gt;
(465&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; = 243&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;)

10&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''b'' for any base ''b'', since 10&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1×''b''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + 0×''b''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;. For example, 10&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 2; 10&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 3; 10&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; = 16&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;. Note that the last "16" is indicated to be in base 10. The base makes no difference for one-digit numerals.

This concept can be demonstrated using a diagram. One object represents one unit. When the number of objects is equal to or greater than the base ''b'', then a group of objects is created with ''b'' objects.  When the number of these groups exceeds ''b'', then a group of these groups of objects is created with ''b'' groups of ''b'' objects; and so on. Thus the same number in different bases will have different values:

 241 in base 5:
    2 groups of 5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (25)           4 groups of 5          1 group of 1
    ooooo    ooooo
    ooooo    ooooo                ooooo   ooooo
    ooooo    ooooo         +                         +         o
    ooooo    ooooo                ooooo   ooooo
    ooooo    ooooo

 241 in base 8:
    2 groups of 8&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (64)          4 groups of 8          1 group of 1
  oooooooo  oooooooo
  oooooooo  oooooooo
  oooooooo  oooooooo         oooooooo   oooooooo
  oooooooo  oooooooo    +                            +        o
  oooooooo  oooooooo
  oooooooo  oooooooo         oooooooo   oooooooo
  oooooooo  oooooooo
  oooooooo  oooooooo

The notation can be further augmented by allowing a leading minus sign. This allows the representation of negative numbers. For a given base, every representation corresponds to exactly one [[real number]] and every real number has at least one representation. The representations of rational numbers are those representations that are finite, use the bar notation, or end with an infinitely repeating cycle of digits.

===Digits and numerals===
A ''digit'' is what is used as a position in place-value notation, and a ''numeral'' is one or more digits. Today's most common digits are the [[Arabic numerals|decimal digits]] "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", and "9". The distinction between a digit and a numeral is most pronounced in the context of a number base.

A non-zero ''numeral'' with more than one digit position will mean a different number in a different number base, but in general, the ''digits'' will mean the same.&lt;ref&gt;The digit will retain its meaning in other number bases, in general, because a higher number base would normally be a notational extension of the lower number base in any systematic organization. In the [[mathematical science]]s there is virtually only one positional-notation numeral system for each base below 10, and this extends with few, if insignificant, variations on the choice of alphabetic digits for those bases above 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The base-8 numeral 23&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; contains two digits, "2" and "3", and with a base number (subscripted) "8", means 19. In our notation here, the subscript "&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;" of the numeral 23&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; is part of the numeral, but this may not always be the case. Imagine the numeral "23" as having [[#Non-standard positional numeral systems|an ambiguous base]] number. Then "23" could likely be any base, base-4 through base-60. In base-4 "23" means 11, and in base-60 it means the number 123. The numeral "23" then, in this case, corresponds to the set of numbers {11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, '''23''', ..., 121, 123} while its digits "2" and "3" always retain their original meaning: the "2" means "two of", and the "3" three.

In certain applications when a numeral with a fixed number of positions needs to represent a greater number, a higher number-base with more digits per position can be used. A three-digit, decimal numeral can represent only up to '''999'''. But if the number-base is increased to 11, say, by adding the digit "A", then the same three positions, maximized to "AAA", can represent a number as great as '''1330'''. We could increase the number base again and assign "B" to 11, and so on (but there is also a possible encryption between number and digit in the number-digit-numeral hierarchy). A three-digit numeral "ZZZ" in base-60 could mean '''{{val|215999}}'''. If we use the entire collection of our [[alphanumerics]] we could ultimately serve a base-''62'' numeral system, but we remove two digits, uppercase "I" and uppercase "O", to reduce confusion with digits "1" and "0".&lt;ref&gt;We do ''not'' usually remove the ''lowercase'' digits "l" and lowercase "o", for in most fonts they are discernible from the digits "1" and "0".&lt;/ref&gt;
We are left with a base-60, or sexagesimal numeral system utilizing 60 of the 62 standard alphanumerics. (But see ''[[#Sexagesimal system|Sexagesimal system]]'' below.) In general, the number of possible values that can be represented by a &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; digit number in base &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;r^d&lt;/math&gt;.

The common numeral systems in computer science are binary (radix 2), octal (radix 8), and hexadecimal (radix 16). In [[Binary numeral system|binary]] only digits "0" and "1" are in the numerals. In the [[octal]] numerals, are the eight digits 0–7. [[Hexadecimal|Hex]] is 0–9 A–F, where the ten numerics retain their usual meaning, and the alphabetics correspond to values 10–15, for a total of sixteen digits. The numeral "10" is binary numeral "2", octal numeral "8", or hexadecimal numeral "16".

===Radix point===
{{main|Radix point}}
The notation can be extended into the negative exponents of the base ''b''. Thereby the so-called radix point, mostly ».«, is used as separator of the positions with non-negative from those with negative exponent.

Numbers that are not [[integer]]s use places beyond the [[radix point]]. For every position behind this point (and thus after the units digit), the exponent ''n'' of the power ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; decreases by 1 and the power approaches 0. For example, the number 2.35 is equal to:
:&lt;math&gt;2\times 10^0 + 3\times 10^{-1} + 5\times 10^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Sign===
{{main|Sign (mathematics)}}
If the base and all the digits in the set of digits are non-negative, negative numbers cannot be expressed. To overcome this, a [[Negative number|minus sign]], here »-«, is added to the numeral system. In the usual notation it is prepended to the string of digits representing the otherwise non-negative number.

===Base conversion===
&lt;!-- This section is the target of a redirect --&gt;
{{expand section|date=March 2017}}
The conversion to a base &lt;math&gt;b_2&lt;/math&gt; of an integer {{math|''n''}} represented in base &lt;math&gt;b_1&lt;/math&gt; can be done by a succession of [[Euclidean division]]s by &lt;math&gt;b_2:&lt;/math&gt; the right-most digit in base &lt;math&gt;b_2&lt;/math&gt; is the remainder of the division of {{math|''n''}} by &lt;math&gt;b_2;&lt;/math&gt; the second right-most digit is the remainder of the division of the quotient by &lt;math&gt;b_2,&lt;/math&gt; and so on. More precisely, the {{math|''k''}}th digit from the right is the remainder of the division by &lt;math&gt;b_2&lt;/math&gt; of the  {{math|(''k''−1)}}th quotient.

For example: converting A10B&lt;sub&gt;Hex&lt;/sub&gt; to decimal (41227):
 0xA10B/10 = 0x101A R: 7 (ones place)
 0x101A/10 = 0x19C  R: 2 (tens place)
  0x19C/10 = 0x29   R: 2 (hundreds place)
   0x29/10 = 0x4    R: 1  ...
    0x4/10 = 0x0    R: 4

When converting to a larger base (such as from binary to decimal), the remainder represents &lt;math&gt;b_2&lt;/math&gt; as a single digit, using digits from &lt;math&gt;b_1&lt;/math&gt;. For example: converting 0b11111001 (binary) to 249 (decimal):
 0b11111001/10 = 0b11000 R: 0b1001 (0b1001 = "9" for ones place)
    0b11000/10 = 0b10    R: 0b100  (0b100 =  "4" for tens)
       0b10/10 = 0b0     R: 0b10   (0b10 =   "2" for hundreds)

===Terminating fractions===
The numbers which have a finite representation form the [[semiring]]
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\N_0}{b^{\N_0}} := \left\{mb^{-\nu}\mid m\in \N_0 \wedge \nu\in \N_0 \right\} .&lt;/math&gt;
More explicitly, if &lt;math&gt;p_1^{\nu_1} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_n^{\nu_n} := b&lt;/math&gt; is a [[factorization]] of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; into the primes &lt;math&gt;p_1, \ldots ,p_n \in \mathbb P&lt;/math&gt; with exponents {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;\nu_1, \ldots ,\nu_n \in \N&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;The exact size of the &lt;math&gt;\nu_1, \ldots ,\nu_n&lt;/math&gt; does not matter. They only have to be &amp;ge; 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}} then with the non-empty set of denominators &lt;math&gt; S := \{ p_1, \ldots, p_n \} &lt;/math&gt;
we have
:&lt;math&gt; \Z_S := \left\{x \in \Q \left | \, \exists \mu_i \in \Z : x \prod_{i=1}^n {p_i}^{\mu_i} \in \Z \right . \right\} = b^{\Z} \, \Z = {\langle S\rangle}^{-1}\Z &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\langle S\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the group generated by the &lt;math&gt;p\in S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; {\langle S\rangle}^{-1}\Z &lt;/math&gt; is the so-called [[Localization (algebra)#Localization of a ring|localization]] of &lt;math&gt;\Z&lt;/math&gt; with respect to {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.}}

The [[Fraction (mathematics)|denominator]] of an element of &lt;math&gt; \Z_S &lt;/math&gt; contains if reduced to lowest terms only prime factors out of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.
This [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] of all terminating fractions to base &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is [[Dense set|dense]] in the field of [[rational number]]s &lt;math&gt;\Q&lt;/math&gt;. Its [[Complete metric space|completion]] for the usual (Archimedean) metric is the same as for &lt;math&gt;\Q&lt;/math&gt;, namely the real numbers &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt;. So, if &lt;math&gt; S = \{ p\} &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; \Z_{\{ p\}} &lt;/math&gt; has not to be confused with &lt;math&gt;\Z_{(p)} &lt;/math&gt;, the [[discrete valuation ring]] for the [[prime number|prime]] &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, which is equal to &lt;math&gt;\Z_{T} &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; T = \mathbb P \setminus \{ p\} &lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; divides &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt; b^{\Z} \, \Z \subseteq c^{\Z} \, \Z.&lt;/math&gt;

===Infinite representations===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
The representation of non-integers can be extended to allow an infinite string of digits beyond the point. For example, 1.12112111211112&amp;nbsp;... base-3 represents the sum of the infinite [[series (mathematics)|series]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{l}
1\times 3^{0\,\,\,} + {}\\
1\times 3^{-1\,\,} + 2\times 3^{-2\,\,\,} + {}\\
1\times 3^{-3\,\,} + 1\times 3^{-4\,\,\,} + 2\times 3^{-5\,\,\,} + {}\\
1\times 3^{-6\,\,} + 1\times 3^{-7\,\,\,} + 1\times 3^{-8\,\,\,} + 2\times 3^{-9\,\,\,} + {}\\
1\times 3^{-10} + 1\times 3^{-11} + 1\times 3^{-12} + 1\times 3^{-13} + 2\times 3^{-14} + \cdots
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

Since a complete infinite string of digits cannot be explicitly written, the trailing ellipsis (...) designates the omitted digits, which may or may not follow a pattern of some kind. One common pattern is when a finite sequence of digits repeats infinitely. This is designated by drawing a [[Vinculum (symbol)|vinculum]] across the repeating block:
:&lt;math&gt;2.42\overline{314}_5 = 2.42314314314314314\dots_5&lt;/math&gt;

For base-10 it is called a [[recurring decimal]] or repeating decimal.

An [[irrational number]] has an infinite non-repeating representation in all integer bases. Whether a [[rational number]] has a finite representation or requires an infinite repeating representation depends on the base. For example, one third can be represented by:
:&lt;math&gt;0.1_3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;0.\overline3_{10} = 0.3333333\dots_{10}&lt;/math&gt;
::or, with the base implied:
::&lt;math&gt;0.\overline3 = 0.3333333\dots&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;0.\overline{01}_2 = 0.010101\dots_2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;0.2_6&lt;/math&gt;

For integers ''p'' and ''q'' with [[greatest common divisor|''gcd'']](''p'', ''q'') = 1, the [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] ''p''/''q'' has a finite representation in base ''b'' if and only if each [[prime factor]] of ''q'' is also a prime factor of ''b''.

For a given base, any number that can be represented by a finite number of digits (without using the bar notation) will have multiple representations, including one or two infinite representations:
:1. A finite or infinite number of zeroes can be appended:
::&lt;math&gt;3.46_7 = 3.460_7 = 3.460000_7 = 3.46\overline0_7&lt;/math&gt;
:2. The last non-zero digit can be reduced by one and an infinite string of digits, each corresponding to one less than the base, are appended (or replace any following zero digits):
::&lt;math&gt;3.46_7 = 3.45\overline6_7&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;1_{10} = 0.\overline9_{10}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;220_5 = 214.\overline4_5&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==

===Decimal system===
{{Main|Decimal representation}}
In the [[decimal]] (base-10) [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]], each position starting from the right is a higher power of 10. The first position represents [[1 E0|10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;]] (1), the second position [[1 E1|10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]] (10), the third position [[1 E2|10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] ({{nowrap|10 × 10}} or 100), the fourth position [[1000 (number)|10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]] ({{nowrap|10 × 10 × 10}} or 1000), and so on.

[[Decimal|Fraction]]al values are indicated by a [[Decimal separator|separator]], which can vary in different locations. Usually this separator is a period or [[full stop]], or a [[comma (punctuation)|comma]]. Digits to the right of it are multiplied by 10 raised to a negative power or exponent. The first position to the right of the separator indicates [[1 E-1|10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;]] (0.1), the second position [[1 E-2|10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;]] (0.01), and so on for each successive position.

As an example, the number 2674 in a base-10 numeral system is:
:(2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) + (6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) + (7 × 10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) + (4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;)

or
:(2 × 1000) + (6 × 100) + (7 × 10) + (4 × 1).

===Sexagesimal system===
The [[sexagesimal]] or base-60 system was used for the integral and fractional portions of [[Babylonian numerals]] and other mesopotamian systems, by [[Hellenistic]] astronomers using [[Greek numerals]] for the fractional portion only, and is still used for modern time and angles, but only for minutes and seconds. However, not all of these uses were positional.

Modern time separates each position by a colon or point. For example, the time might be 10:25:59 (10 hours 25 minutes 59 seconds). Angles use similar notation. For example, an angle might be 10°25'59" (10 [[degree (angle)|degree]]s 25 [[minute (angle)|minute]]s 59 [[second (angle)|second]]s). In both cases, only minutes and seconds use sexagesimal notation—angular degrees can be larger than 59 (one rotation around a circle is 360°, two rotations are 720°, etc.), and both time and angles use decimal fractions of a second. This contrasts with the numbers used by Hellenistic and [[Renaissance]] astronomers, who used [[third (angle)|third]]s, [[fourth (angle)|fourth]]s, etc. for finer increments. Where we might write 10°25'59.392", they would have written 10°25′59″23‴31⁗12&amp;prime;&amp;prime;&amp;prime;&amp;prime;&amp;prime; or 10°25&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;59&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;23&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;31&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;12&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;.

Using a digit set of digits with upper and lowercase letters allows short notation for sexagesimal numbers, e.g. 10:25:59 becomes 'ARz' (by omitting I and O, but not i and o), which is useful for use in URLs, etc., but it is not very intelligible to humans.

In the 1930s, [[Otto Neugebauer]] introduced a modern notational system for Babylonian and Hellenistic numbers that substitutes modern decimal notation from 0 to 59 in each position, while using a semicolon (;) to separate the integral and fractional portions of the number and using a comma (,) to separate the positions within each portion. For example, the mean [[synodic month]] used by both Babylonian and Hellenistic astronomers and still used in the [[Hebrew calendar]] is 29;31,50,8,20 days, and the angle used in the example above would be written 10;25,59,23,31,12 degrees.

===Computing===
In [[computing]], the [[Binary numeral system|binary]] (base-2), octal (base-8) and [[hexadecimal]] (base-16) bases are most commonly used. Computers, at the most basic level, deal only with sequences of conventional zeroes and ones, thus it is easier in this sense to deal with powers of two. The hexadecimal system is used as "shorthand" for binary—every 4 binary digits (bits) relate to one and only one hexadecimal digit. In hexadecimal, the six digits after 9 are denoted by A, B, C, D, E, and F (and sometimes a, b, c, d, e, and f).

The [[octal]] numbering system is also used as another way to represent binary numbers. In this case the base is 8 and therefore only digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are used. When converting from binary to octal every 3 bits relate to one and only one octal digit.

Hexadecimal, decimal, octal, and a wide variety of other bases have been used for [[binary-to-text encoding]], implementations of [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic]], and other applications.

''For a list of bases and their applications, see [[list of numeral systems]].''

===Other bases in human language===
Base-12 systems ([[duodecimal]] or dozenal) have been popular because multiplication and division are easier than in base-10, with addition and subtraction being just as easy. Twelve is a useful base because it has many [[divisor|factors]]. It is the smallest common multiple of one, two, three, four and six. There is still a special word for "dozen" in English, and by analogy with the word for 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''hundred'', commerce developed a word for 12&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''gross''. The standard 12-hour clock and common use of 12 in English units emphasize the utility of the base. In addition, prior to its conversion to decimal, the old British currency [[Pound Sterling]] (GBP) ''partially'' used base-12; there were 12 pence (d) in a shilling (s), 20 shillings in a pound (£), and therefore 240 pence in a pound. Hence the term LSD or, more properly, [[£sd]].

The [[Maya civilization]] and other civilizations of [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]] used base-20 ([[vigesimal]]), as did several North American tribes (two being in southern California). Evidence of base-20 counting systems is also found in the languages of central and western [[Africa]].

Remnants of a [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] base-20 system also exist in French, as seen today in the names of the numbers from 60 through 99. For example, sixty-five is ''soixante-cinq'' (literally, "sixty [and] five"), while seventy-five is ''soixante-quinze'' (literally, "sixty [and] fifteen"). Furthermore, for any number between 80 and 99, the "tens-column" number is expressed as a multiple of twenty. For example, eighty-two is ''quatre-vingt-deux'' (literally, four twenty[s] [and] two), while ninety-two is ''quatre-vingt-douze'' (literally, four twenty[s] [and] twelve). In Old French, forty was expressed as two twenties and sixty was three twenties, so that fifty-three was expressed as two twenties [and] thirteen, and so on.

In English the same base-20 counting appears in the use of "[[20 (number)|scores]]".  Although mostly historical it is occasionally used colloquially.  Verse 10 of Pslam 90 in the King James Version of the Bible starts: "The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow".  The Gettysburg Address starts: "Four score and seven years ago".

The [[Irish language]] also used base-20 in the past, twenty being ''fichid'', forty ''dhá fhichid'', sixty ''trí fhichid'' and eighty ''ceithre fhichid''. A remnant of this system may be seen in the modern word for 40, ''daoichead''.

The [[Welsh language]] continues to use a [[vigesimal|base-20]] [[Welsh language#Counting system|counting system]], particularly for the age of people, dates and in common phrases. 15 is also important, with 16–19 being "one on 15", "two on 15" etc. 18 is normally "two nines". A decimal system is commonly used.

[[Danish language#Numerals|Danish numerals]] display a similar [[vigesimal|base-20]] structure.

The Maori language of New Zealand also has evidence of an underlying base-20 system as seen in the terms ''Te Hokowhitu a Tu'' referring to a war party (literally "the seven 20s of Tu") and ''Tama-hokotahi'', referring to a great warrior ("the one man equal to 20").

[[Binary numeral system|The binary system]] was used in the Egyptian Old Kingdom, 3000&amp;nbsp;BC to 2050&amp;nbsp;BC. It was cursive by rounding off rational numbers smaller than 1 to {{nowrap|1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 + 1/64}}, with a 1/64 term thrown away (the system was called the [[Eye of Horus#Mathematics|Eye of Horus]]).

A number of [[Australian Aboriginal languages]] employ binary or binary-like counting systems. For example, in [[Kala Lagaw Ya]], the numbers one through six are ''urapon'', ''ukasar'', ''ukasar-urapon'', ''ukasar-ukasar'', ''ukasar-ukasar-urapon'', ''ukasar-ukasar-ukasar''.

North and Central American natives used base-4 ([[Quaternary numeral system|quaternary]]) to represent the four cardinal directions. Mesoamericans tended to add a second base-5 system to create a modified base-20 system.

A base-5 system ([[quinary]]) has been used in many cultures for counting. Plainly it is based on the number of digits on a human hand. It may also be regarded as a sub-base of other bases, such as base-10, base-20, and base-60.

A base-8 system ([[octal]]) was devised by the [[Yuki tribe]] of Northern California, who used the spaces between the fingers to count, corresponding to the digits one through eight.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|page=38|title=Pi in the sky: counting, thinking, and being|first=John D.|last=Barrow|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1992|isbn=9780198539568}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also linguistic evidence which suggests that the Bronze Age [[Proto-Indo European]]s (from whom most European and Indic languages descend) might have replaced a base-8 system (or a system which could only count up to 8) with a base-10 system. The evidence is that the word for 9, ''newm'', is suggested by some to derive from the word for "new", ''newo-'', suggesting that the number 9 had been recently invented and called the "new number".&lt;ref&gt;(Mallory &amp; Adams 1997) [[Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many ancient counting systems use five as a primary base, almost surely coming from the number of fingers on a person's hand. Often these systems are supplemented with a secondary base, sometimes ten, sometimes twenty. In some [[African languages]] the word for five is the same as "hand" or "fist" ([[Dyola language]] of [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Banda languages|Banda language]] of [[Central Africa]]). Counting continues by adding 1, 2, 3, or 4 to combinations of 5, until the secondary base is reached. In the case of twenty, this word often means "man complete". This system is referred to as ''quinquavigesimal''. It is found in many languages of the [[Sudan]] region.

The [[Telefol language]], spoken in [[Papua New Guinea]], is notable for possessing a base-27 numeral system.

==Non-standard positional numeral systems==
{{Main|Non-standard positional numeral systems}}
Interesting properties exist when the base is not fixed or positive and when the digit symbol sets denote negative values. There are many more variations. These systems are of practical and theoretic value to computer scientists.

[[Balanced ternary]] uses a base of 3 but the digit set is {{mset|{{overline|1}},0,1}} instead of {0,1,2}. The "{{overline|1}}" has an equivalent value of −1. The negation of a number is easily formed by switching the {{overline|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;}} on the 1s. This system can be used to solve the [[balance problem]], which requires finding a minimal set of known counter-weights to determine an unknown weight. Weights of 1, 3, 9, ... 3&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; known units can be used to determine any unknown weight up to 1 + 3 + ... + 3&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; units. A weight can be used on either side of the balance or not at all. Weights used on the balance pan with the unknown weight are designated with {{overline|1}}, with 1 if used on the empty pan, and with 0 if not used. If an unknown weight ''W'' is balanced with 3 (3&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) on its pan and 1 and 27 (3&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; and 3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) on the other, then its weight in decimal is 25 or 10{{overline|1}}1 in balanced base-3. 
:{{math|10{{overline|1}}1&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 1 × 3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 0 × 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 × 3&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 × 3&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 25.}}

The [[factorial number system]] uses a varying radix, giving [[factorial]]s as place values; they are related to [[Chinese remainder theorem]] and [[residue number system]] enumerations. This system effectively enumerates permutations. A derivative of this uses the [[Towers of Hanoi]] puzzle configuration as a counting system. The configuration of the towers can be put into 1-to-1 correspondence with the decimal count of the step at which the configuration occurs and vice versa.

==Non-positional positions==
Each position does not need to be positional itself. Babylonian sexagesimal numerals were positional, but in each position were groups of two kinds of wedges representing ones and tens (a narrow vertical wedge ( | ) and an open left pointing wedge (&lt;))—up to 14 symbols per position (5 tens (&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;) and 9 ones ( ||||||||| ) grouped into one or two near squares containing up to three tiers of symbols, or a place holder (\\) for the lack of a position).&lt;ref&gt;Ifrah, pages 326, 379&lt;/ref&gt; Hellenistic astronomers used one or two alphabetic Greek numerals for each position (one chosen from 5 letters representing 10–50 and/or one chosen from 9 letters representing 1–9, or a [[Greek numerals#Hellenistic zero|zero symbol]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ifrah, pages 261-264&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mathematics of [[chaotic dynamical system]]s, in the '''Pyragas method''' of stabilizing a [[periodic orbit]], an appropriate continuous controlling signal is injected into the system, whose intensity is nearly zero as the system evolves close to the desired periodic orbit but increases when it drifts away from the desired orbit. Both the Pyragas and OGY ([[Edward Ott|Ott]], [[Celso Grebogi|Grebogi]] and [[James A. Yorke|Yorke]]) methods are part of a general class of methods called "closed loop" or "feedback" methods which can be applied based on knowledge of the system obtained through solely observing the behavior of the system as a whole over a suitable period of time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chaos1.la.asu.edu/~yclai/papers/Physics_Report.pdf S. Boccaletti et al.(2000) ''The Control of Chaos: Theory and Applications'', Physics Reports 329, 103-197] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304104213/http://chaos1.la.asu.edu/~yclai/papers/Physics_Report.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pyragas.pfi.lt/pdffiles/1992/pla92.pdf Continuous control of chaos via self-controlling feedback]&lt;/ref&gt;.
The method was proposed by Lithuanian physicist {{Ill|Kęstutis Pyragas|lt}}.

Porph. ''V.P.'' 9) that he left Samos to escape the tyranny of Polycrates at the age of forty, we may put his birth round about 570 BC, or a few years earlier. The length of his life was variously estimated in antiquity, but it is agreed that he lived to a fairly ripe old age, and most probably he died at about seventy-five or eighty." [[William Keith Chambers Guthrie]], (1978), ''A history of Greek philosophy, Volume 1: The earlier Presocratics and the Pythagoreans'', p. 173. Cambridge University Press}} was an [[Ionians|Ionian]] [[Ancient Greeks|Greek]] [[Greek philosophy|philosopher]] and the eponymous founder of the [[Pythagoreanism]] movement.&lt;!-- Please do NOT add "mathematician". Despite the famous theorem that now bears his name, scholars dispute whether the historical Pythagoras was involved in mathematics at all. Please read the rest of the lead and the "Attributed discoveries" section for further information. Thank you. --&gt; His political and religious teachings were well known in [[Magna Graecia]] and influenced the philosophies of [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and, through them, [[Western philosophy]]. Knowledge of his life is clouded by legend, but he appears to have been the son of Mnesarchus, a [[Seal carving|seal engraver]] on the island of [[Samos]]. Modern scholars disagree regarding Pythagoras's education and influences, but they do agree that, around 530 BC, he travelled to [[Crotone|Croton]], where he founded a school in which initiates were sworn to secrecy and lived a [[Communalism|communal]], [[asceticism|ascetic]] lifestyle. This lifestyle entailed a number of dietary prohibitions, traditionally said to have included [[vegetarianism]], although modern scholars doubt that he ever advocated for complete vegetarianism.

The teaching most securely identified with Pythagoras is ''[[metempsychosis]]'', or the "transmigration of souls", which holds that every [[soul]] is [[immortality|immortal]] and, upon death, [[reincarnation|enters into a new body]]. He may have also devised the doctrine of ''[[musica universalis]]'', which holds that the [[Classical planet|planets]] move according to [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[equation]]s and thus resonate to produce an inaudible [[symphony]] of music. Scholars debate whether Pythagoras developed the [[Numerology|numerological]] and musical teachings attributed to him, or if those teachings were developed by his later followers, particularly [[Philolaus|Philolaus of Croton]]. Following Croton's decisive victory over [[Sybaris]] in around 510 BC, Pythagoras's followers came into conflict with supporters of [[Greek democracy|democracy]] and Pythagorean meeting houses were burned. Pythagoras may have been killed during this persecution, or escaped to [[Metapontum]], where he eventually died.

In antiquity, Pythagoras was credited with many mathematical and scientific discoveries, including the [[Pythagorean theorem]], [[Pythagorean tuning]], the [[Platonic solids|five regular solids]], the [[Proportionality (mathematics)|Theory of Proportions]], the [[Spherical Earth|sphericity of the Earth]], and the identity of the [[Phosphorus (morning star)|morning]] and [[Hesperus|evening stars]] as the planet [[Venus]]. It was said that he was the first man to call himself a philosopher ("lover of wisdom"){{efn|[[Cicero]], ''[[Tusculan Disputations]]'', 5.3.8–9 (citing [[Heraclides Ponticus]] fr. 88 Wehrli), [[Diogenes Laërtius]] 1.12, 8.8, [[Iamblichus]] ''VP'' 58. Burkert attempted to discredit this ancient tradition, but it has been defended by C.J. De Vogel, ''Pythagoras and Early Pythagoreanism'' (1966), pp. 97–102, and C. Riedweg, ''Pythagoras: His Life, Teaching, And Influence'' (2005), p. 92.}} and that he was the first to divide the globe into [[Geographical zone|five climatic zones]]. Classical historians debate whether Pythagoras made these discoveries, and many of the accomplishments credited to him likely originated earlier or were made by his colleagues or successors. Some accounts mention that the philosophy associated with Pythagoras was related to mathematics and that numbers were important, but it is debated to what extent, if at all, he actually contributed to mathematics or [[natural philosophy]].

Pythagoras influenced Plato, whose [[Socratic dialogue|dialogues]], especially his ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', exhibit Pythagorean teachings. Pythagorean ideas on mathematical perfection also impacted [[ancient Greek art]]. His teachings underwent a major revival in the first century BC among [[Middle Platonism|Middle Platonists]], coinciding with the rise of [[Neopythagoreanism]]. Pythagoras continued to be regarded as a great philosopher throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and his philosophy had a major impact on scientists such as [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], [[Johannes Kepler]], and [[Isaac Newton]]. Pythagorean symbolism was used throughout early modern [[Western esotericism|European esotericism]] and his teachings as portrayed in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' influenced the modern vegetarian movement.

==Biographical sources==

No authentic writings of Pythagoras have survived,{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=11}}{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=796}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=4}} and almost nothing is known for certain about his life.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=3–5}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=21–23}}{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=29}} The earliest sources on Pythagoras's life are brief, ambiguous, and often [[satire|satirical]].{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=2}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=4}}{{sfn|Burkert|1985|page=299}} The earliest source on Pythagoras's teachings is a satirical poem probably written after his death by [[Xenophanes of Colophon]], who had been one of his contemporaries.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=12}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=62}} In the poem, Xenophanes describes Pythagoras interceding on behalf of a [[dog]] that is being beaten, professing to recognize in its cries the voice of a departed friend.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 36&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=12}}{{sfn|Burkert|1985|page=299}}{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=31}} [[Alcmaeon of Croton]], a doctor who lived in Croton at around the same time Pythagoras lived there,{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=12}} incorporates many Pythagorean teachings into his writings{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=12–13}} and alludes to having possibly known Pythagoras personally.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=12–13}} The poet [[Heraclitus of Ephesus]], who was born across a few miles of sea away from Samos and may have lived within Pythagoras's lifetime,{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=13}} mocked Pythagoras as a clever charlatan,{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=2}}{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=13}} remarking that "Pythagoras, son of Mnesarchus, practiced inquiry more than any other man, and selecting from these writings he manufactured a wisdom for himself—much learning, artful knavery."{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=13}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=2}}

The Greek poets [[Ion of Chios]] ({{circa|480|421&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=on}}) and [[Empedocles of Acragas]] ({{circa|493|432&amp;nbsp;BC}}) both express admiration for Pythagoras in their poems.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=14–15}} The first concise description of Pythagoras comes from the historian [[Herodotus of Halicarnassus]] ({{circa|484|420&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=no}}),{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=16}} who describes him as "not the most insignificant" of Greek sages&lt;ref&gt;4. 95. &lt;/ref&gt; and states that Pythagoras taught his followers how to attain [[immortality]].{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=16}} The writings attributed to the Pythagorean philosopher [[Philolaus|Philolaus of Croton]], who lived in the late fifth century BC, are the earliest texts to describe the numerological and musical theories that were later ascribed to Pythagoras.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=88}} The [[Ancient Athens|Athenian]] [[rhetoric]]ian [[Isocrates]] (436–338 BC) was the first to describe Pythagoras as having visited Egypt.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=16}} [[Aristotle]] wrote a treatise ''On the Pythagoreans'', which is no longer extant.&lt;ref&gt;He alludes to it himself, ''Met.'' i. 5. p. 986. 12, ed. Bekker.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of it may be preserved in the ''[[Protrepticus (Aristotle)|Protrepticus]]''. Aristotle's disciples [[Dicaearchus]], [[Aristoxenus]], and [[Heraclides Ponticus]] also wrote on the same subject.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=109}}

Most of the major sources on Pythagoras's life are from the [[Ancient Greece#Roman Greece|Roman period]],{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}} by which point, according to the German classicist [[Walter Burkert]], "the history of Pythagoreanism was already... the laborious reconstruction of something lost and gone."{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=109}} Three [[Biography#Historical biography|lives]] of Pythagoras have survived from late antiquity,{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=29}} all of which are filled primarily with myths and legends.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=9}}{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=29}} The earliest and most respectable of these is the one from [[Diogenes Laërtius]]'s ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]''.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=9}} The two later lives were written by the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]] philosophers [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] and [[Iamblichus]]{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=9}} and were partially intended as polemics against the [[rise of Christianity]].{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=9}} The later sources are much lengthier than the earlier ones,{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}} and even more fantastic in their descriptions of Pythagoras's achievements.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=9}} Porphyry and Iamblichus used material from the lost writings of Aristotle's disciples{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=109}} and material taken from these sources is generally considered to be the most reliable.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=109}}

[[Herodotus]], [[Isocrates]], and other early writers agree that Pythagoras was the son of Mnesarchus{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=6}}{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=16}} and that he was born on the Greek island of [[Samos]] in the eastern [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]].{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=6}}{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=11}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=12}}{{sfn|Kenny|2004|page=9}} His father is said to have been a gem-engraver or a wealthy merchant,&lt;ref&gt;Clemens von Alexandria: ''Stromata'' I 62, 2–3, cit. {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=teoyAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=neanthes%20of%20cyzicus%20pythagoras%20tyre&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Iamblichus and the Foundations of Late Platonism|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Brill|year=2012|editor1=Eugene V.

Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iamblichus]] tells the story that the Pythia prophesied to her while she was pregnant with him that she would give birth to a man supremely beautiful, wise, and beneficial to humankind.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=59}} As to the date of his birth, [[Aristoxenus]] stated that Pythagoras left Samos in the reign of [[Polycrates]], at the age of 40, which would give a date of birth around 570 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 9&lt;/ref&gt;

During Pythagoras's formative years, Samos was a thriving cultural hub known for its feats of advanced architectural engineering, including the building of the [[Tunnel of Eupalinos]], and for its riotous festival culture.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=45–47}} It was a major center of trade in the Aegean where traders brought goods from the [[Near East]].{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=11}} According to Christiane L. Joost-Gaugier, these traders almost certainly brought with them Near Eastern ideas and traditions.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=11}} Pythagoras's early life also coincided with the flowering of early Ionian [[natural philosophy]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=44–45}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=6}} He was a contemporary of the philosophers [[Anaximander]], [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], and the historian [[Hecataeus of Miletus|Hecataeus]], all of whom lived in [[Miletus]], across the sea from Samos.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=44–45}}

===Alleged travels===

Pythagoras is traditionally thought to have received most of his education in the Near East.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=7}} Modern scholarship has shown that the culture of [[Archaic Greece]] was heavily influenced by those of Near Eastern cultures.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=7}} Like many other important Greek thinkers, Pythagoras was said to have studied in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=7–8}}{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=16}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=22–23}} By the time of Isocrates in the fourth century BC, Pythagoras's alleged studies in Egypt were already taken as fact.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=59}}{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=16}} The writer [[Antiphon (writer)|Antiphon]], who may have lived during the Hellenistic Era, claimed in his lost work ''On Men of Outstanding Merit'', used as a source by Porphyry, that Pythagoras learned to speak [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] from the [[Pharaoh]] [[Amasis II]] himself, that he studied with the Egyptian priests at [[Thebes, Egypt|Diospolis]] (Thebes), and that he was the only foreigner ever to be granted the privilege of taking part in their worship.&lt;ref name="Porphyry6"&gt;Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 6.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=7}} The [[Middle Platonist]] biographer [[Plutarch]] ({{circa|46|120&amp;nbsp;AD|lk=on}}) writes in his treatise ''[[Moralia|On Isis and Osiris]]'' that, during his visit to Egypt, Pythagoras received instruction from the Egyptian priest Oenuphis of [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] (meanwhile [[Solon]] received lectures from a [[Sonchis of Sais]]).&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Isis_and_Osiris*/A.html On Isis And Osiris]'', ch. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Christian theologian]] [[Clement of Alexandria]] ({{circa|150|215&amp;nbsp;AD|lk=no}}), "Pythagoras was a disciple of Soches, an Egyptian archprophet, as well as [[Plato]] of Sechnuphis of [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]]."{{sfn|Press|2003|page=83}} Some ancient writers claimed, that Pythagoras learned geometry and the doctrine of metempsychosis from the Egyptians.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=7–8}}&lt;ref&gt;cf. Antiphon. ap. Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 7; Isocrates, ''Busiris'', 28–9; Cicero, ''de Finibus'', v. 27; Strabo, xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ancient writers, however, claimed that Pythagoras had learned these teachings from the [[Magi]] in [[Persia]] or even from [[Zoroaster]] himself.&lt;ref name="DiogenesLaërtiusviii.1,3"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 1, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} Diogenes Laërtius asserts that Pythagoras later visited [[Crete]], where he went to the [[Mount Ida|Cave of Ida]] with [[Epimenides]].&lt;ref name="DiogenesLaërtiusviii.1,3"/&gt; The [[Phoenicia]]ns are reputed to have taught Pythagoras [[arithmetic]] and the [[Chaldea]]ns to have taught him astronomy.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} By the third century BC, Pythagoras was already reported to have studied under the [[Jews]] as well.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} Contradicting all these reports, the novelist [[Antonius Diogenes]], writing in the second century BC, reports that Pythagoras discovered all his doctrines himself by [[Dream interpretation|interpreting dreams]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} The third-century AD [[Sophist]] [[Philostratus]] claims that, in addition to the Egyptians, Pythagoras also studied under [[Hinduism|Hindu]] sages in [[India]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}} Iamblichus expands this list even further by claiming that Pythagoras also studied with the [[Celts]] and [[Iberians]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=8}}

Of the various Greek sages claimed to have taught Pythagoras, [[Pherecydes of Syros]] is mentioned most often.&lt;ref&gt;Aristoxenus and others in Diogenes Laërtius, i. 118, 119; Cicero, ''de Div.'' i. 49&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}} Similar miracle stories were told about both Pythagoras and Pherecydes, including one in which the hero predicts a shipwreck, one in which he predicts the conquest of a city, and one in which he drinks from a well and predicts a shipwreck.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}} [[Apollonius Paradoxographus]], a paradoxographer who may have lived in the second century BC, identified Pythagoras's [[Thaumaturgy|thaumaturgic]] ideas as a result of Pherecydes's influence.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}} Another story, which may be traced to the Neopythagorean philosopher [[Nicomachus]], tells that, when Pherecydes was old and dying on the island of [[Delos]], Pythagoras returned to care for him and pay his respects.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}} [[Duris of Samos|Duris]], the historian and tyrant of Samos, is reported to have patriotically boasted of an epitaph supposedly penned by Pherecydes which declared that Pythagoras's wisdom exceeded his own.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}} On the grounds of all these references connecting Pythagoras with Pherecydes, Riedweg concludes that there may well be some historical foundation to the tradition that Pherecydes was Pythagoras's teacher.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}} Pythagoras and Pherecydes also appear to have shared similar views on the soul and the teaching of metempsychosis.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=9}}

Before 520 BC, on one of his visits to Egypt or Greece, Pythagoras might have met [[Thales of Miletus]], who would have been around fifty-four years older than him.

Porphyry repeats an account from [[Antiphon]], who reported that, while he was still on Samos, Pythagoras founded a school known as the "semicircle".{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=10}}{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=64}} Here, Samians debated matters of public concern.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=10}}{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=64}} Supposedly, the school became so renowned that the brightest minds in all of Greece came to Samos to hear Pythagoras teach.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=10}} Pythagoras himself dwelled in a secret cave, where he studied in private and occasionally held discourses with a few of his close friends.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=10}}{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=64}} Christoph Riedweg, a German scholar of early Pythagoreanism, states that it is entirely possible Pythagoras may have taught on Samos,{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=10}} but cautions that Antiphon's account, which makes reference to a specific building that was still in use during his own time, appears to be motivated by Samian patriotic interest.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=10}}

Around 530 BC, when Pythagoras was around forty years old, he left Samos.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=6}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=11}}{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=11}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=5}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=22}} His later admirers claimed that he left because he disagreed with the [[Tyrant#Historical forms|tyranny]] of [[Polycrates]] in Samos,&lt;ref name=Boyer /&gt;{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=11}} Riedweg notes that this explanation closely aligns with Nicomachus's emphasis on Pythagoras's purported love of freedom, but that Pythagoras's enemies portrayed him as having a proclivity towards tyranny.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=11}} Other accounts claim that Pythagoras left Samos because he was so overburdened with public duties in Samos, because of the high estimation in which he was held by his fellow-citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, ''Vit.

Diogenes Laërtius states that Pythagoras "did not indulge in the pleasures of love"{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=58}} and that he cautioned others to only have sex "whenever you are willing to be weaker than yourself".{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} According to Porphyry, Pythagoras married [[Theano (philosopher)|Theano]], a lady of [[Crete]] and the daughter of Pythenax{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} and had several children with her.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} Porphyry writes that Pythagoras had two sons named [[Telauges]] and [[Arignote]],{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} and a daughter named Myia,{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} who "took precedence among the maidens in Croton and, when a wife, among married women."{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} Iamblichus mentions none of these children{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} and instead only mentions a son named Mnesarchus after his grandfather.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} This son was raised by Pythagoras's appointed successor Aristaeus and eventually took over the school when Aristaeus was too old to continue running it.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}}

The wrestler [[Milo of Croton]] was said to have been a close associate of Pythagoras{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=5–6, 59, 73}} and was credited with having saved the philosopher's life when a roof was about to collapse.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=5–6, 59, 73}} This association may been the result of confusion with a different man named Pythagoras, who was an athletics trainer.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=10}} Diogenes Laërtius records Milo's wife's name as Myia.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} Iamblichus mentions Theano as the wife of Brontinus of Croton.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} Diogenes Laërtius states that the same Theano was Pythagoras's pupil{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} and that Pythagoras's wife Theano was her daughter.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} Diogenes Laërtius also records that works supposedly written by Theano were still extant during his own lifetime{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} and quotes several opinions attributed to her.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} These writings are now known to be [[pseudepigraphica]]l.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}}

===Death===
Pythagoras's emphasis on dedication and asceticism are credited with aiding in Croton's decisive victory over the neighboring colony of [[Sybaris]] in 510 BC.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=6–7}} After the victory, some prominent citizens of Croton proposed a [[Greek democracy|democratic constitution]], which the Pythagoreans rejected.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=6–7}} The supporters of democracy, headed by [[Cylon of Croton|Cylon]] and [[Ninon of Croton|Ninon]], the former of whom is said to have been irritated by his exclusion from Pythagoras's brotherhood, roused the populace against them.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=19}} Followers of Cylon and Ninon attacked the Pythagoreans during one of their meetings, either in the house of Milo or in some other meeting-place.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=7}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=19–20}} Accounts of the attack are often contradictory and many probably confused it with later anti-Pythagorean rebellions.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=19}} The building was apparently set on fire,{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=7}} and many of the assembled members perished;{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=7}} only the younger and more active members managed to escape.&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 255–259; Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 54–57; Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 39; comp. Plutarch, ''de Gen. Socr.'' p. 583&lt;/ref&gt;

Sources disagree regarding whether Pythagoras was present when the attack occurred and, if he was, whether or not he managed to escape.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=106}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=19–20}} In some accounts, Pythagoras was not at the meeting when the Pythagoreans were attacked because he was on Delos tending to the dying Pherecydes.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=19–20}} According to another account from Dicaearchus, Pythagoras was at the meeting and managed to escape,{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=20}} leading a small group of followers to the nearby city of [[Locris]], where they pleaded for sanctuary, but were denied.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=20}} They reached the city of [[Metapontum]], where they took shelter in the temple of the [[Muses]] and died there of starvation after forty days without food.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=20}}{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=106}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=7}}{{sfn|Grant|1989|page=278}} Another tale recorded by Porphyry claims that, as Pythagoras's enemies were burning the house, his devoted students laid down on the ground to make a path for him to escape by walking over their bodies across the flames like a bridge.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=20}} Pythagoras managed to escape, but was so despondent at the deaths of his beloved students that he committed suicide.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=20}} A different legend reported by both Diogenes Laërtius and Iamblichus states that Pythagoras almost managed to escape, but that he came to a bean field and refused to run through it, since doing so would violate his teachings, so he stopped instead and was killed.{{sfn|Simoons|1998|pages=225–228}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=20}} This story seems to have originated from the writer Neanthes, who told it about later Pythagoreans, not about Pythagoras himself.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=20}}

Although the exact details of Pythagoras's teachings are uncertain,{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=106–109}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=5–6}} it is possible to reconstruct a general outline of his main ideas.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=106–109}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=9–11}} Aristotle writes at length about the teachings of the Pythagoreans,{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=29–30}}{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=31}} but without mentioning Pythagoras directly.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=29–30}}{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=31}} One of Pythagoras's main doctrines appears to have been ''[[metempsychosis]]'',{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=11}}{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=232}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=5}}{{sfn|Burkert|1985|pages=300–301}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=24–25}}{{sfn|Copleston|2003|pages=30–31}} the belief that all [[soul]]s are immortal and that, after death, a soul is transferred into a new body.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=11}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=24–25}} This teaching is referenced by Xenophanes, Ion of Chios, and Herodotus.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 36, comp. Aristotle, ''de Anima'', i. 3; Herodotus, ii. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=11}} Nothing whatsoever, however, is known about the nature or mechanism by which Pythagoras believed metempsychosis to occur.{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=25}}

[[Empedocles]] alludes in one of his poems that Pythagoras may have claimed to possess the ability to recall his former incarnations.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=12}} Diogenes Laërtius reports an account from [[Heraclides Ponticus]] that Pythagoras told people that he had lived four previous lives that he could remember in detail.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|pages=164–167}}&lt;ref&gt;Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 26; Pausanias, ii. 17; Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 5; Horace, ''Od.'' i. 28,1. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these lives was as [[Aethalides]] the son of [[Hermes]], who granted him the ability to remember all his past incarnations.{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|pages=164–165}} Next, he was incarnated as [[Euphorbus]], a minor hero from the [[Trojan War]] briefly mentioned in the ''[[Iliad]]''.{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|pages=165–166}} He then became the philosopher [[Hermotimus of Clazomenae|Hermotimus]],{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=167}} who recognized the shield of Euphorbus in the temple of Apollo.{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=167}} His final incarnation was as Pyrrhus, a fisherman from [[Delos]].{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=167}} One of his past lives, as reported by [[Dicaearchus]], was as a beautiful courtesan.&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius, iv. 11&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|page=232}}

===Mysticism===
Another belief attributed to Pythagoras was that of the "[[Musica universalis|harmony of the spheres]]",{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=29–30}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=38–39}} which maintained that the planets and stars move according to mathematical equations, which correspond to musical notes and thus produce an inaudible symphony.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=29–30}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=38–39}} According to Porphyry, Pythagoras taught that the seven [[Muse]]s were actually the [[Classical planet|seven planets]] singing together.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=30}} In his philosophical dialogue [[Protrepticus (Aristotle)|''Protrepticus'']], [[Aristotle]] has his literary double say:

{{quote|When Pythagoras was asked [why humans exist], he said, "to observe the heavens," and he used to claim that he himself was an observer of nature, and it was for the sake of this that he had passed over into life.&lt;ref name=HutchinsonJohnson&gt;{{cite web|author1=D.

Pythagoras was said to have practiced [[divination]] and [[prophecy]].&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''de Divin.'' i. 3, 46; Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 29.&lt;/ref&gt; In the visits to various places in Greece—[[Delos]], [[Sparta]], [[Phlius]], [[Crete]], etc.—which are ascribed to him, he usually appears either in his religious or priestly guise, or else as a lawgiver.&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, ''Vit.

According to Aristotle, the Pythagoreans used mathematics for solely mystical reasons, devoid of practical application.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=467–468}} They believed that all things were made of numbers.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=265}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=27}} The number one (the [[Monad (philosophy)|monad]]) represented the origin of all things{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=23}} and the number two (the [[Dyad (Greek philosophy)|dyad]]) represented matter.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=23}} The number three was an "ideal number" because it had a beginning, middle, and end{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=170–172}} and was the smallest number of points that could be used to define a plane triangle, which they revered as a symbol of the god [[Apollo]].{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=170–172}} The number four signified the [[Seasons|four seasons]] and the [[Classical element|four elements]].{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=172}} The number seven was also sacred because it was the number of planets and the number of strings on a lyre,{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=172}} and because Apollo's birthday was celebrated on the seventh day of each month.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=172}} They believed that [[Parity (mathematics)|odd numbers]] were [[masculine]],{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=433}} that even numbers were [[feminine]],{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=433}} and that the number five represented marriage, because it was the sum of two and three.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=467}}{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=170}}

Ten was regarded as the "perfect number"{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=467–468}} and the Pythagoreans honored it by never gathering in groups larger than ten.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=161}} Pythagoras was credited with devising the [[tetractys]], the triangular figure of four rows which add up to the perfect number, ten.{{sfn|Bruhn|2005|pages=65–66}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=28–29}} The Pythagoreans regarded the tetractys as a symbol of utmost mystical importance.{{sfn|Bruhn|2005|pages=65–66}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=29}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=28–29}} Iamblichus, in his ''Life of Pythagoras'', states that the tetractys was "so admirable, and so divinised by those who understood [it]," that Pythagoras's students would swear oaths by it.&lt;ref&gt;Iamblichus, ''Vit.

Modern scholars debate whether these numerological teachings were developed by Pythagoras himself or by the later Pythagorean philosopher [[Philolaus of Croton]].{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=87–88}} In his landmark study ''Lore and Science in Ancient Pythagoreanism'', Walter Burkert argues that Pythagoras was a charismatic political and religious teacher,{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=2–3}} but that the number philosophy attributed to him was really an innovation by Philolaus.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=3}} According to Burkert, Pythagoras never dealt with numbers at all, let alone made any noteworthy contribution to mathematics.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=2–3}} Burkert argues that the only mathematics the Pythagoreans ever actually engaged in was simple, [[Mathematical proof|proofless]] [[arithmetic]],{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=428–433}} but that these arithmetic discoveries did contribute significantly to the beginnings of mathematics.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=465}}

The central figure, probably Pythagoras himself, is turned away from our view towards the sunrise. He has long braids and his long beard is partially visible from the side. Both of his arms are raised into the air. The three men closest to him, two on his left and one on his right, are kneeling and making frantic gestures, possibly weeping. Behind them, an older man plays a harp and two women play lyres. A young man without a beard and an middle-aged man with a beard play lyres as well, while another young man plays the aulos. A man in the foreground at the back of the group kneels prayerfully towards the sunrise.

Scholars Press.; D. J. O'Meara, (1989), ''Pythagoras Revived. Mathematics and Philosophy in Late Antiquity'', pages 35–40.

Two groups existed within early Pythagoreanism: the ''mathematikoi'' ("learners") and the ''akousmatikoi'' ("listeners").{{sfn|Zhmud|2012|pages=2, 16}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=31}} The ''akousmatikoi'' are traditionally identified by scholars as "old believers" in mysticism, numerology, and religious teachings;{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=31}} whereas the ''mathematikoi'' are traditionally identified as a more intellectual, modernist faction who were more rationalist and scientific.{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=31}} Gregory cautions that there was probably not a sharp distinction between them and that many Pythagoreans probably believed the two approaches were compatible.{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=31}} The study of mathematics and music may have been connected to the worship of Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;Aelian, ''Varia Historia'', ii. 26; Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 13; Iamblichus, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 8, 91, 141&lt;/ref&gt; The Pythagoreans believed that music was a purification for the soul, just as medicine was a purification for the body.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=30}} One anecdote of Pythagoras reports that when he encountered some drunken youths trying to break into the home of a virtuous woman, he sang a solemn tune with long [[spondee]]s and the boys' "raging willfulness" was quelled.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=30}} The Pythagoreans also placed particular emphasis on the importance of [[physical exercise]];{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=31}} therapeutic [[dance|dancing]], daily morning walks along [[scenic route]]s, and [[Sport of athletics|athletics]] were major components of the Pythagorean lifestyle.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=31}} Moments of contemplation at the beginning and end of each day were also advised.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=33–34}}

Pythagorean teachings were known as "symbols" (''symbolon''){{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=8}} and members took a vow of silence that they would not reveal these symbols to non-members.&lt;ref&gt;Scholion ad Aristophanes, ''Nub.'' 611; Iamblichus, ''Vit.

New initiates were allegedly not permitted to meet Pythagoras until after they had completed a five-year initiation period,{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=64}} during which they were required to remain silent.{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=64}} Sources indicate that Pythagoras himself was unusually progressive in his attitudes towards women{{sfn|Pomeroy|2013|page=xvi}} and female members of Pythagoras's school appear to have played an active role in its operations.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=8}}{{sfn|Pomeroy|2013|page=xvi}} Iamblichus provides a list of 235 famous Pythagoreans,{{sfn|Pomeroy|2013|page=1}} seventeen of whom are women.{{sfn|Pomeroy|2013|page=1}} In later times, many prominent female philosophers contributed to the development of [[Neopythagoreanism]].{{sfn|Pomeroy|2013|pages=xvi–xvii}}

Pythagoreanism also entailed a number of dietary prohibitions.{{sfn|Copleston|2003|pages=30–31}}{{sfn|Kenny|2004|page=10}}&lt;ref&gt;comp. Porphyry, ''Vit. Pyth.'' 32; Iamblichus, ''Vit.

Within his own lifetime, Pythagoras was already the subject of elaborate [[hagiography|hagiographic]] legends.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=1}} Aristotle described Pythagoras as a wonder-worker and somewhat of a supernatural figure.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=2}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=30–31}} In a fragment, Aristotle writes that Pythagoras had a golden thigh,{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=2}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=30}}{{sfn|Kenny|2004|page=11}} which he publicly exhibited at the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]]{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=2}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=60}} and showed to [[Abaris the Hyperborean]] as proof of his identity as the "Hyperborean Apollo".{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=2}}&lt;ref&gt;Porphyry, ''Vit.

Pythagoras was said to have dressed all in white.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=2}}{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=47}} He is also said to have borne a golden [[wreath]] atop his head{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=2}} and to have worn [[trousers]] after the fashion of the [[Thrace|Thracians]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=2}} Diogenes Laërtius presents Pythagoras as having exercised remarkable [[self-control]];{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=58–59}} he was always cheerful,{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=58–59}} but "abstained wholly from laughter, and from all such indulgences as jests and idle stories".{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=59}} Pythagoras was said to have had extraordinary success in dealing with animals.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=160}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=60}} A fragment from Aristotle records that, when a deadly snake bit Pythagoras, he bit it back and killed it.{{sfn|McKeown|2013|page=155}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=60}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=30}} Both Porphyry and Iamblichus report that Pythagoras once persuaded a bull not to eat beans{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=160}} and that he once convinced a notoriously destructive bear to swear that it would never harm a living thing again, and that the bear kept its word.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=5}}{{sfn|Cornelli|McKirahan|2013|page=160}}

Riedweg suggests that Pythagoras may have personally encouraged these legends,{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=1}} but Gregory states that there is no direct evidence of this.{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=31}} Anti-Pythagorean legends were also circulated.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=60–61}} Diogenes Laërtes retells a story told by Hermippus of Samos, which states that Pythagoras had once gone into an underground room, telling everyone that he was descending to the underworld.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=61}} He stayed in this room for months, while his mother secretly recorded everything that happened during his absence.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=61}} After he returned from this room, Pythagoras recounted everything that had happened while he was gone,{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=61}} convincing everyone that he had really been in the underworld{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=61}} and leading them to trust him with their wives.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=61}}

Although Pythagoras is most famous today for his alleged mathematical discoveries,{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=1–2}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|pages=21–22}} classical historians dispute whether he himself ever actually made any significant contributions to the field.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=428–433}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=2–3}} Many mathematical and scientific discoveries were attributed to Pythagoras, including [[Pythagorean theorem|his famous theorem]],&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 12; Plutarch, ''Non posse suav. vivi sec.

According to a popular legend, after he discovered this theorem, Pythagoras sacrificed an ox, or possibly even a whole ''[[hecatomb]]'', to the gods.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=27}}{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=428}} Cicero rejected this story as spurious{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=27}} because of the much more widely held belief that Pythagoras forbade blood sacrifices.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=27}} Porphyry attempted to explain the story by asserting that the ox was actually made of [[dough]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=27}}

The Pythagorean theorem was known and used by the [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonians]] and [[Indian mathematics|Indians]] centuries before Pythagoras,{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=429, 462}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=27}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=32}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=6–7}} but it is possible that he may have been the first one to introduce it to the Greeks.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=429}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=32}} Some historians of mathematics have even suggested that he&amp;mdash;or his students&amp;mdash;may have constructed the first [[Mathematical proof|proof]].{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=33}} Burkert rejects this suggestion as implausible,{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=429}} noting that Pythagoras was never credited with having proved any theorem in antiquity.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=429}} Furthermore, the manner in which the Babylonians employed Pythagorean numbers implies that they knew that the principle was generally applicable, and knew some kind of proof, which has not yet been found in the (still largely unpublished) [[cuneiform]] sources.{{efn|There are about 100,000 unpublished cuneiform sources in the [[British Museum]] alone.

{{See also|Pythagorean tuning |Pythagorean hammers}} 
According to legend, Pythagoras discovered that musical notes could be translated into mathematical equations when he passed blacksmiths at work one day and heard the sound of their [[Pythagorean hammers|hammers]] clanging against the anvils.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=27–28}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=27}} Thinking that the sounds of the hammers were beautiful and harmonious, except for one,{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=28}} he rushed into the [[blacksmith]] shop and began testing the hammers.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=28}} He then realized that the tune played when the hammer struck was directly proportional to the size of the hammer and therefore concluded that music was mathematical.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=28}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=27}} However, this legend is demonstrably false,{{sfn|Christensen|2002|page=143}}{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=29}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=27}} as these ratios are only relevant to string length (such as the string of a [[monochord]]), and not to hammer weight.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|page=143}}{{sfn|Gregory|2015|page=27}}

===In astronomy===
In ancient times, Pythagoras and his contemporary [[Parmenides|Parmenides of Elea]] were both credited with having been the first to teach that the [[Spherical Earth|Earth was spherical]],{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=306}} the first to divide the globe into [[Geographical zone|five climactic zones]],{{sfn|Burkert|1972|page=306}} and the first to identify the [[Phosphorus (morning star)|morning star]] and the [[Hesperus|evening star]] as the [[Venus|same celestial object]].{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=307–308}} Of the two philosophers, Parmenides has a much stronger claim to having been the first{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=306–308}} and the attribution of these discoveries to Pythagoras seems to have possibly originated from a [[pseudepigrapha]]l poem.{{sfn|Burkert|1972|pages=307–308}} Empedocles, who lived in Magna Graecia shortly after Pythagoras and Parmenides, knew that the earth was spherical.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=53}} By the end of the fifth century BC, this fact was universally accepted among Greek intellectuals.{{sfn|Dicks|1970|page=68}}

{{See also|Timaeus (dialogue)}}

Sizeable Pythagorean communities existed in Magna Graecia, [[Phlius]], and [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] during the early fourth century BC.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=48–49}} Around the same time, the Pythagorean philosopher [[Archytas]] was highly influential on the politics of the city of [[Taranto|Tarentum]] in Magna Graecia.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=39}} According to later tradition, Archytas was elected as ''[[strategos]]'' ("general") seven times, even though others were prohibited from serving more than a year.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=39}} Archytas was also a renowned mathematician and musician.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=39–43}} He was a close friend of Plato{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=39–40}} and he is quoted in Plato's ''Republic''.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=40, 44–45}}&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Republic'' VII, 530d&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle states that the philosophy of Plato was heavily dependent on the teachings of the Pythagoreans.&lt;ref&gt;Metaphysics, 1.6.1 (987a)&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=1}} Cicero repeats this statement, remarking that ''Platonem ferunt didicisse Pythagorea omnia'' ("They say Plato learned all things Pythagorean").&lt;ref&gt;Tusc. Disput. 1.17.39.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Charles H. Kahn, Plato's middle dialogues, including ''[[Meno]]'', ''[[Phaedo]]'', and ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', have a strong "Pythagorean coloring",{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=55}} and his last few dialogues (particularly ''[[Philebus]]'' and ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''){{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=55–62}} are extremely Pythagorean in character.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=55–62}}

According to [[R. M. Hare]], Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' may be partially based on the "tightly organised community of like-minded thinkers" established by Pythagoras at Croton.{{sfn|Hare|1999|pages=117–119}} Additionally, Plato may have borrowed from Pythagoras the idea that mathematics and abstract thought are a secure basis for philosophy, science, and morality.{{sfn|Hare|1999|pages=117–119}} Plato and Pythagoras shared a "mystical approach to the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] and its place in the material world"{{sfn|Hare|1999|pages=117–119}} and it is probable that both were influenced by [[Orphicism|Orphism]].{{sfn|Hare|1999|pages=117–119}} The historian of philosophy [[Frederick Copleston]] states that Plato probably borrowed [[Plato's tripartite theory of soul|his tripartite theory of the soul]] from the Pythagoreans.{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=37}} [[Bertrand Russell]], in his ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'', contends that the influence of Pythagoras on Plato and others was so great that he should be considered the most influential philosopher of all time.{{sfn|Russell|2008|pages=33–37}} He concludes that "I do not know of any other man who has been as influential as he was in the school of thought."{{sfn|Russell|2008|page=37}}

A revival of Pythagorean teachings occurred in the first century BC{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=123–124}} when [[Middle Platonism|Middle Platonist]] philosophers such as [[Eudorus of Alexandria|Eudorus]] and [[Philo of Alexandria]] hailed the rise of a "new" Pythagoreanism in [[Alexandria]].{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=124}} At around the same time, [[Neopythagoreanism]] became prominent.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=125–126}} The first-century AD philosopher [[Apollonius of Tyana]] sought to emulate Pythagoras and live by Pythagorean teachings.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=125}} The later first-century Neopythagorean philosopher [[Moderatus of Gades]] expanded on Pythagorean number philosophy{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=125}} and probably understood the soul as a "kind of mathematical harmony."{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=125}} The Neopythagorean mathematician and musicologist [[Nicomachus]] likewise expanded on Pythagorean numerology and music theory.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=125–126}} [[Numenius of Apamea]] interpreted Plato's teachings in light of Pythagorean doctrines.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=126–127}}

===On art and architecture===
[[File:Giovanni Paolo Panini - Interior of the Pantheon, Rome - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting showing a massive room with a high, domed ceiling. A hole is open at the top of the dome. Columns and statues line the walls.|[[Hadrian]]'s [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in [[Rome]], depicted in this eighteenth-century painting by [[Giovanni Paolo Panini]], was built according to Pythagorean teachings.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=166–181}}]]

Greek sculpture sought to represent the permanent reality behind superficial appearances.{{sfn|Homann-Wedeking|1968|page=63}} Early [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] sculpture represents life in simple forms, and may have been influenced by the earliest Greek natural philosophies.{{efn|"For [[Thales]], the origin was water, and for [[Anaximander]] the infinite ([[apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]]), which must be considered a material form"{{sfn|Homann-Wedeking|1968|page=63}}}} The Greeks generally believed that nature expressed itself in ideal forms and was represented by a type ({{lang|grc|εἶδος}}), which was mathematically calculated.{{sfn|Homann-Wedeking|1968|page=62}}{{sfn|Carpenter|1921|pages=107, 122, 128}} When dimensions changed, architects sought to relay permanence through mathematics.{{sfn|Homann-Wedeking|1968|pages=62–63}}{{sfn|Bowra|1994|page=166}} [[Maurice Bowra]] believes that these ideas influenced the theory of Pythagoras and his students, who believed that "all things are numbers".{{sfn|Bowra|1994|page=166}}

During the sixth century BC, the number philosophy of the Pythagoreans triggered a revolution in Greek sculpture.{{sfn|Homann-Wedeking|1968|pages=62–65}} Greek sculptors and architects attempted to find the mathematical relation ([[aesthetic canon|canon]]) behind aesthetic perfection.{{sfn|Carpenter|1921|pages=107, 122, 128}} Possibly drawing on the ideas of Pythagoras,{{sfn|Carpenter|1921|pages=107, 122, 128}} the sculptor [[Polykleitos]] writes in his ''Canon'' that beauty consists in the proportion, not of the elements (materials), but of the interrelation of parts with one another and with the whole.{{sfn|Carpenter|1921|pages=107, 122, 128}}{{efn|"Each part (finger, palm, arm, etc) transmitted its individual existence to the next, and then to the whole": ''Canon of Polykleitos'', also [[Plotinus]], ''Ennead'' I.vi.i: Nigel Spivey, pp. 290–294.}} In the Greek architectural orders, every element was calculated and constructed by mathematical relations. [[Rhys Carpenter]] states that the ratio 2:1 was "the generative ratio of the [[Doric order]], and in Hellenistic times an ordinary Doric colonnade, beats out a rhythm of notes."{{sfn|Carpenter|1921|pages=107, 122, 128}}

The oldest known building designed according to Pythagorean teachings is the [[Porta Maggiore Basilica]],{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=154}} a subterranean basilica which was built during the reign of the Roman emperor [[Nero]] as a secret place of worship for Pythagoreans.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=154–156}} The basilica was built underground because of the Pythagorean emphasis on secrecy{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=157–158}} and also because of the legend that Pythagoras had sequestered himself in a cave on Samos.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=158}} The basilica's apse is in the east and its atrium in the west out of respect for the rising sun.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=158–159}} It has a narrow entrance leading to a small pool where the initiates could purify themselves.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=159}} The building is also designed according to Pythagorean numerology,{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=159–161}} with each table in the sanctuary providing seats for seven people.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=161}} Three aisles lead to a single altar, symbolizing the three parts of the soul approaching the unity of Apollo.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=161}} The apse depicts a scene of the poetess [[Sappho]] leaping off the [[Lefkada|Leucadian cliffs]], clutching her lyre to her breast, while Apollo stands beneath her, extending his right hand in a gesture of protection,{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=162}} symbolizing Pythagorean teachings about the immortality of the soul.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=162}} The interior of the sanctuary is almost entirely white because the color white was regarded by Pythagoreans as sacred.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=162–164}}

The emperor [[Hadrian]]'s [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in [[Rome]] was also built based on Pythagorean numerology.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=166–181}} The temple's circular plan, central axis, hemispherical [[dome]], and alignment with the four cardinal directions symbolize Pythagorean views on the order of the universe.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=167–168}} The single [[oculus]] at the top of the dome symbolizes the monad and the sun-god Apollo.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=168}} The twenty-eight ribs extending from the oculus symbolize the moon, because twenty-eight was the same number of months on the Pythagorean lunar calendar.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=169–170}} The five coffered rings beneath the ribs represent the marriage of the sun and moon.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=170–172}}

===In early Christianity===
Many early Christians had a deep respect for Pythagoras.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=57–65}} [[Eusebius]] ({{circa}} 260 – {{circa}} 340 AD), bishop of [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]], praises Pythagoras in his ''Against Hierokles'' for his rule of silence, his frugality, his "extraordinary" morality, and his wise teachings.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=57}} In another work, Eusebius compares Pythagoras to [[Moses]].{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=57}} In one of his letter, the [[Church Fathers|Church Father]] [[Jerome]] ({{circa}} 347 – 420 AD) praises Pythagoras for his wisdom{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=57}} and, in another letter, he credits Pythagoras for his belief in the immortality of the soul, which he suggests Christians inherited from him.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=57–58}} [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354 – 430 AD) rejected Pythagoras's teaching of metempsychosis without explicitly naming him, but otherwise expressed admiration for him.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|pages=58–59}} In ''[[On the Trinity]]'', Augustine lauds the fact that Pythagoras was humble enough to call himself a ''philosophos'' or "lover of wisdom" rather than a "sage".{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=59}} In another passage, Augustine defends Pythagoras's reputation, arguing that Pythagoras certainly never taught the doctrine of metempsychosis.{{sfn|Joost-Gaugier|2006|page=59}}

==After antiquity==
===In the Middle Ages===
[[File:Pythagore-chartres.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Medieval carving of a man with long hair and a long beard hunched over a musical instrument he is working on|Pythagoras appears in a relief sculpture on one of the [[archivolts]] over the right door of the west portal at [[Chartres Cathedral]].{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}}]]

During the [[Middle Ages]], Pythagoras was revered as the founder of mathematics and music, two of the [[Seven Liberal Arts]].{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} He appears in numerous medieval depictions, in illuminated manuscripts and in the relief sculptures on the portal of the [[Cathedral of Chartres]].{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} The ''Timaeus'' was the only dialogue of Plato to survive in Latin translation in western Europe,{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} which led [[William of Conches]] (c. 1080-1160) to declare that Plato was Pythagorean.{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} In the 1430s, the Camaldolese friar [[Ambrose Traversari]] translated Diogenes Laërtius's ''Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers'' from Greek into Latin{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} and, in the 1460s, the philosopher [[Marsilio Ficino]] translated Porphyry and Iamblichus's ''Lives of Pythagoras'' into Latin as well,{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} thereby allowing them to be read and studied by western scholars.{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} In 1494, the Greek Neopythagorean scholar [[Constantine Lascaris]] published ''[[The Golden Verses of Pythagoras]]'', translated into Latin, with a printed edition of his ''Grammatica'',{{sfn|Russo|2004|pages=5–87, especially 51–53}} thereby bringing them to a widespread audience.{{sfn|Russo|2004|pages=5–87, especially 51–53}} In 1499, he published the first Renaissance biography of Pythagoras in his work ''Vitae illustrium philosophorum siculorum et calabrorum'', issued in [[Messina]].{{sfn|Russo|2004|pages=5–87, especially 51–53}}

===On modern science===
In his preface to his book ''[[On the Revolution of the Heavenly Spheres]]'' (1543), [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] cites various Pythagoreans as the most important influences on the development of his [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric model]] of the universe,{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=160}} deliberately omitting mention of [[Aristarchus of Samos]], a non-Pythagorean astronomer who had developed a fully heliocentric model in the fourth century BC, in effort to portray his model as fundamentally Pythagorean.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=160}} [[Johannes Kepler]] considered himself to be a Pythagorean.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pages=161–171}}{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}}{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=265}} He believed in the Pythagorean doctrine of ''musica universalis''{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=264–274}} and it was his search for the mathematical equations behind this doctrine that led to his discovery of the [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|laws of planetary motion]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=264–274}} Kepler titled his book on the subject ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'' (''Harmonics of the World''), after the Pythagorean teaching that had inspired him.{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=162}} Near the conclusion of the book, Kepler describes himself falling asleep to the sound of the heavenly music, "warmed by having drunk a generous draught... from the cup of Pythagoras."{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=274}}

[[Isaac Newton]] firmly believed in the Pythagorean teaching of the mathematical harmony and order of the universe.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=279}} Though Newton was notorious for rarely giving others credit for their discoveries,{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=279–280}} he attributed the discovery of the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Law of Universal Gravitation]] to Pythagoras.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=279–280}} [[Albert Einstein]] believed that a scientist may also be "a Platonist or a Pythagorean insofar as he considers the viewpoint of logical simplicity as an indispensable and effective tool of his research."{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=172}} The English philosopher [[Alfred North Whitehead]] argued that "In a sense, Plato and Pythagoras stand nearer to modern physical science than does Aristotle. The two former were mathematicians, whereas Aristotle was the son of a doctor".{{sfn|Whitehead|1953|pages=36–37}} By this measure, Whitehead declared that Einstein and other modern scientists like him are "following the pure Pythagorean tradition."{{sfn|Kahn|2001|page=172}}{{sfn|Whitehead|1953|page=36}}

===On vegetarianism===
[[File:Pythagoras advocating vegetarianism (1618-20); Peter Paul Rubens.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=Painting showing Pythagoras on the far left quizzically stroking his beard as he gazes upon a massive pile of fruits and vegetables. Two followers stand behind him, fully clothed. A man with a greying beard sits at the base of a tree gesturing to the pile of produce. Next to him, a fleshy, nude woman with blonde hair plucks fruits from it. Slightly behind her, two other women, one partially clothed and the other nude but obscured by the tree branch, are also plucking fruits. At the far right end of the painting, two nude, faun-like men with beards and pointed ears hurl more fruits upon the pile.|''Pythagoras Advocating Vegetarianism'' (1618-1630) by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] was inspired by Pythagoras's speech in Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=192}} The painting portrays the Pythagoreans with corpulent bodies, indicating a belief that vegetarianism was healthful and nutritious.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=192}}]]

A fictionalized portrayal of Pythagoras appears in Book XV of [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'',{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=189}} in which he delivers a speech imploring his followers to adhere to a strictly vegetarian diet.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|pages=189–190}} It was through [[Arthur Golding]]'s 1567 English translation of Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'' that Pythagoras was best known to English-speakers throughout the early modern period.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|pages=189–190}} [[John Donne]]'s ''Progress of the Soul'' discusses the implications of the doctrines expounded in the speech{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} and [[Michel de Montaigne]] quoted the speech no less than three times in his treatise "Of Cruelty" to voice his moral objections against the mistreatment of animals.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} [[William Shakespeare]] references the speech in his play ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=282}} [[John Dryden]] included a translation of the scene with Pythagoras in his 1700 work ''[[Fables, Ancient and Modern]]''{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} and [[John Gay]]'s 1726 fable "Pythagoras and the Countryman" reiterates its major themes, linking carnivorism with tyranny.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} [[Lord Chesterfield]] records that his conversion to vegetarianism had been motivated by reading Pythagoras's speech in Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''.{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} Until the word ''vegetarianism'' was coined in the 1840s, vegetarians were referred to in English as "Pythagoreans".{{sfn|Borlik|2011|page=190}} [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] wrote an ode entitled "To the Pythagorean Diet"{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=294}} and [[Leo Tolstoy]] adopted the Pythagorean diet himself.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=294}}

===On Western esotericism===
Early modern [[Western esotericism|European esotericism]] drew heavily on the teachings of Pythagoras.{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} The German [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] scholar [[Johannes Reuchlin]] (1455–1522) synthesized Pythagoreanism with [[Christian theology]] and Jewish [[Kabbalah]],{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=127–128}} arguing that Kabbalah and Pythagoreanism were both inspired by [[Moses|Mosaic]] tradition{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=128}} and that Pythagoras was therefore a kabbalist.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=128}} In his dialogue ''De verbo mirifico'' (1494), Reuchlin compared the Pythagorean tetractys to the [[Ineffability|ineffable]] divine name [[Tetragrammaton|YHWH]],{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|pages=127–128}} ascribing each of the four letters of the tetragrammaton a symbolic meaning according to Pythagorean mystical teachings.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=128}}

[[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]]'s popular and influential three-volume treatise ''[[Three Books of Occult Philosophy|De Occulta Philosophia]]'' cites Pythagoras as a "religious magi"{{sfn|French|2002|page=30}} and indicates that Pythagoras's mystical numerology operates on a [[Allegory in Renaissance literature#Three world theory|supercelestial]] level.{{sfn|French|2002|page=30}} The [[Freemasonry|freemasons]] deliberately modeled their society on the community founded by Pythagoras at Croton.{{sfn|Riedweg|2005|page=133}} [[Rosicrucianism]] used Pythagorean symbolism,{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} as did [[Robert Fludd]] (1574–1637),{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} who believed his own musical writings to have been inspired by Pythagoras.{{sfn|Celenza|2010|page=798}} [[John Dee]] was heavily influenced by Pythagorean ideology,{{sfn|Sherman|1995|page=15}}{{sfn|French|2002|page=30}} particularly the teaching that all things are made of numbers.{{sfn|Sherman|1995|page=15}}{{sfn|French|2002|page=30}} [[Adam Weishaupt]], the founder of the [[Illuminati]], was a strong admirer of Pythagoras{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=284–288}} and, in his book ''Pythagoras'' (1787), he advocated that society should be reformed to be more like Pythagoras's commune at Croton.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=287–288}} [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] incorporated Masonic and Pythagorean symbolism into his opera ''[[The Magic Flute]]''.{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|pages=286–287}} [[Sylvain Maréchal]], in his six-volume 1799 biography ''The Voyages of Pythagoras'', declared that all revolutionaries in all time periods are the "heirs of Pythagoras".{{sfn|Ferguson|2008|page=288}}

===On literature===
[[File:Paradiso Canto 31.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|alt=Engraving showing two small silhouettes standing before a tunnel of innumerably manifold circling angels leading to a bright, beautiful light at the end.|[[Dante Alighieri]]'s description of Heaven in his ''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]'' incorporates Pythagorean numerology.{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=89}}]]

[[Dante Alighieri]] was fascinated by Pythagorean numerology{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=89}} and based his descriptions of [[Hell]], [[Purgatory]], and [[Heaven]] on Pythagorean numbers.{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=89}} Dante wrote that Pythagoras saw Unity as Good and Plurality as Evil{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=90}} and, in ''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]'' XV, 56–57, he declares: "five and six, if understood, ray forth from unity."{{sfn|Haag|2013|pages=90–91}} The number eleven and its multiples are found throughout the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', each book of which has thirty-three [[canto]]s, except for the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', which has thirty-four, the first of which serves as a general introduction.{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} Dante describes the ninth and tenth bolgias in the Eighth Circle of Hell as being twenty-two miles and eleven miles respectively,{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} which correspond to the fraction {{sfrac|22|7}}, which was the Pythagorean approximation of [[pi]].{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven are all described as circular{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} and Dante compares the wonder of [[God in Christianity|God]]'s majesty to the mathematical puzzle of [[squaring the circle]].{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} The number three also features prominently:{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=91}} the ''Divine Comedy'' has three parts{{sfn|Haag|2013|pages=91–92}} and [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]] is associated with the number nine, which is equal to three times three.{{sfn|Haag|2013|page=92}}

The [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalists]] read the ancient ''Lives of Pythagoras'' as guides on how to live a model life.{{sfn|Bregman|2002|page=186}} [[Henry David Thoreau]] was impacted by [[Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist)|Thomas Taylor]]'s translations of Iamblichus's ''Life of Pythagoras'' and [[Stobaeus]]'s ''Pythagoric Sayings''{{sfn|Bregman|2002|page=186}} and his views on nature may have been influenced by the Pythagorean idea of images corresponding to archetypes.{{sfn|Bregman|2002|page=186}} The Pythagorean teaching of ''musica universalis'' is a recurring theme throughout Thoreau's ''[[magnum opus]]'', ''[[Walden]]''.{{sfn|Bregman|2002|page=186}}

The '''quadratic integrate and fire (QIF) model''' is a [[biological neuron model]] and a type of integrate-and-fire neuron which describes [[action potentials]] in neurons. In contrast to physiologically accurate but computationally expensive neuron models like the [[Hodgkin–Huxley model]], the QIF model seeks only to produce [[action potential]]-like patterns and ignores subtleties like gating variables, which play an important role in generating action potentials in a real neuron. However, the QIF model is incredibly easy to implement and compute, and relatively straightforward to study and understand, thus has found ubiquitous use in computational neuroscience {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}.

A quadratic integrate and fire neuron is defined by the [[autonomous differential equation]],

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt} = x^2 + I&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is a real positive constant. Note that a solution to this differential equation is the tangent function, which blows up in finite time. Thus a "spike" is said to have occurred when the solution reaches positive infinity, and the solution is reset to negative infinity.

When implementing this model in computers, a threshold crossing value (&lt;math&gt;V_t&lt;/math&gt;) and a reset value (&lt;math&gt;V_r&lt;/math&gt;) is assigned, so that when the solution rises above the threshold, &lt;math&gt;x(t) \geq V_t&lt;/math&gt;, the solution is immediately reset to &lt;math&gt;V_r&lt;/math&gt;

In [[mathematics]], '''''quadrature''''' is a historical term which means the process of determining [[area]]. This term is still used nowadays in the context of [[differential equation]]s, where "solving an equation by quadrature" means expressing its solution in terms of [[antiderivative|integrals]].

Quadrature problems served as one of the main sources of problems in the development of [[calculus]], and introduce important topics in [[mathematical analysis]].

== History ==
[[File:Geometric mean.svg|thumb|left|220px|&lt;center&gt;Antique method to find the [[geometric mean]]&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Greek mathematics|Mathematicians of ancient Greece]], according to the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] doctrine, understood determination of [[area]] of a figure as the process of geometrically constructing a [[square (geometry)|square]] having the same area  (''squaring''), thus the name ''quadrature'' for this process. The Greek geometers were not always successful (see [[quadrature of the circle]]), but they did carry out quadratures of some figures whose sides were not simply line segments, such as the [[lune of Hippocrates|lunes of Hippocrates]] and  [[The Quadrature of the Parabola|the quadrature of the parabola]]. By Greek tradition, these constructions had to be performed using only a [[Compass and straightedge constructions|compass and straightedge]].

For a quadrature of a [[rectangle]] with the sides ''a'' and ''b'' it is necessary to construct a square with the side &lt;math&gt;x =\sqrt {ab}&lt;/math&gt; (the [[geometric mean]] of ''a'' and ''b''). For this purpose it is possible to use the following: if one draws the circle with diameter made from joining line segments of lengths ''a'' and ''b'', then the height (''BH'' in the diagram) of the line segment drawn perpendicular to the diameter, from the point of their connection to the point where it crosses the circle, equals the geometric mean of ''a'' and ''b''. A similar geometrical construction solves the problems of quadrature of a parallelogram and of a triangle.

[[File:Parabola and inscribed triangle.svg|thumb|200px|&lt;center&gt;The area of a segment of a parabola is 4/3 that of the area of a certain inscribed triangle.&lt;/center&gt;]]
Problems of quadrature for [[curvilinear]] figures are much more difficult. The quadrature of the circle with compass and straightedge was proved in the 19th century to be impossible. Nevertheless, for some figures (for example a lune of Hippocrates) a quadrature can be performed. The quadratures of the surface of a sphere and a [[parabola]] segment discovered by [[Archimedes]] became the highest achievement of analysis in antiquity.
:* The area of the surface of a sphere is equal to four times the area of the circle formed by a [[great circle]] of this sphere.
:* The area of a segment of a parabola determined by a straight line cutting it is 4/3 the area of a triangle inscribed in this segment.
For the proof of these results, Archimedes used the [[method of exhaustion]]&lt;ref name="Katz"&gt;{{cite book|last=Katz|first=Victor J.|title=A History of Mathematics: An Introduction|edition= 2nd|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman|year=1998|isbn=0321016181}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|113}} of [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]].

In medieval Europe, quadrature meant the calculation of area by any method. Most often the [[method of indivisibles]] was used; it was less rigorous than the geometric constructions of the Greeks, but it was simpler and more powerful. With its help, [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Gilles de Roberval]] found the area of a [[cycloid]] arch, [[Grégoire de Saint-Vincent]] investigated the area under a [[hyperbola]] (''Opus Geometricum'', 1647),&lt;ref name="Katz"/&gt;{{rp|491}} and [[Alphonse Antonio de Sarasa]], de Saint-Vincent's pupil and commentator, noted the relation of this area to [[logarithm]]s.&lt;ref name=Katz/&gt;{{rp|492}}&lt;ref&gt;Enrique A. Gonzales-Velasco (2011) ''Journey through Mathematics'', § 2.4 Hyperbolic Logarithms, page 117&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Wallis]] algebrised this method; he wrote in his ''Arithmetica Infinitorum'' (1656) some series which are equivalent to what is now called the [[definite integral]], and he calculated their values. [[Isaac Barrow]] and [[James Gregory (mathematician)|James Gregory]] made further progress: quadratures for some [[algebraic curves]] and [[spiral]]s. [[Christiaan Huygens]] successfully performed a quadrature of the surface area of some [[Solid of revolution|solids of revolution]].

The quadrature of the hyperbola by Saint-Vincent and de Sarasa provided a new [[function(mathematics)|function]], the [[natural logarithm]], of critical importance. With the invention of [[integral calculus]] came a universal method for area calculation. In response, the term ''quadrature'' has become traditional, and instead the modern phrase ''finding the area'' is more commonly used for what is technically the ''computation of a univariate definite integral''.

The '''quasispecies model''' is a description of the process of the Darwinian [[evolution]] of certain [[self-replication|self-replicating]] entities within the framework of [[physical chemistry]]. A quasispecies is a large group or "'''cloud'''" of related [[genotype]]s that exist in an environment of high mutation rate (at stationary state&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eigen|first=Manfred|last2=McCaskill|first2=John|last3=Schuster|first3=Peter|title=Molecular quasi-species|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/j100335a010|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry|language=en|volume=92|issue=24|pages=6881–6891|doi=10.1021/j100335a010|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-002C-84A7-C}}&lt;/ref&gt;), where a large fraction of offspring are expected to contain one or more mutations relative to the parent.  This is in contrast to a [[species]], which from an evolutionary perspective is a more-or-less stable single genotype, most of the offspring of which will be genetically accurate copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Biebricher, C.K &amp; Eigen, M.|chapter=What is a Quasispecies|editor=Esteban Domingo|title=Quasispecies: Concept and Implications for Virology |publisher=Springer|year=2006|isbn=978-3-540-26395-1|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is useful mainly in providing a qualitative understanding of the evolutionary processes of self-replicating macromolecules such as [[RNA]] or [[DNA]] or simple asexual organisms such as [[bacterium|bacteria]] or [[virus]]es (see also [[viral quasispecies]]), and is helpful in explaining something of the early stages of the [[Abiogenesis|origin of life]]. Quantitative predictions based on this model are difficult because the parameters that serve as its input are impossible to obtain from actual biological systems. The quasispecies model was put forward by [[Manfred Eigen]] and [[Peter Schuster]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Eigen M, Schuster P |year=1979 |title=The Hypercycle: A Principle of Natural Self-Organization |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=Berlin |isbn=0-387-09293-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on initial work done by Eigen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eigen |first=Manfred |date=October 1971 |title=Selforganization of matter and the evolution of biological macromolecules |journal=Die Naturwissenschaften |volume=58 |issue=10 |pages=465–523 |doi=10.1007/BF00623322 |pmid=4942363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simplified explanation==

When evolutionary biologists describe competition between species, they generally assume that each species is a single genotype whose descendants are mostly accurate copies.  (Such genotypes are said to have a high reproductive ''fidelity''.)  Evolutionarily, we are interested in the behavior and fitness of that one species or genotype over time.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Some organisms or genotypes, however, may exist in circumstances of low fidelity, where most descendants contain one or more mutations.  A group of such genotypes is constantly changing, so discussions of which single genotype is the most fit become meaningless.  Importantly, if many closely related genotypes are only one mutation away from each other, then genotypes in the group can mutate back and forth into each other.  For example, with one mutation per generation, a child of the sequence AGGT could be AGTT, and a grandchild could be AGGT again.  Thus we can envision a "'''cloud'''" of related genotypes that is rapidly mutating, with sequences going back and forth among different points in the cloud.  Though the proper definition is mathematical, that cloud, roughly speaking, is a quasispecies.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Quasispecies behavior exists for large numbers of individuals existing at a certain (high) range of mutation rates.&lt;ref&gt;Martinez, MA, Martus G, Capel E, Parera M, Franco S, Nevot M (2012) Quasispecies Dynamics of RNA Viruses. In: Viruses: Essential Agents of Life, Springer, Dordrecht, pp. 21-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quasispecies, fitness, and evolutionary selection===
In a species, though reproduction may be mostly accurate, periodic mutations will give rise to one or more competing genotypes.  If a mutation results in greater replication and survival, the mutant genotype may out-compete the parent genotype and come to dominate the species.  Thus, the individual genotypes (or species) may be seen as the units on which selection acts and biologists will often speak of a single genotype's [[fitness (biology)|fitness]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In a quasispecies, however, mutations are ubiquitous and so the fitness of an individual genotype becomes meaningless: if one particular mutation generates a boost in reproductive success, it can't amount to much because that genotype's offspring are unlikely to be accurate copies with the same properties.  Instead, what matters is the ''connectedness'' of the cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Villarreal | first1 = L.P. | last2 = Witzany | first2 = G. | year = 2013 | title = Rethinking quasispecies theory: From fittest type to cooperative consortia | journal = World Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 70–79 | doi = 10.4331/wjbc.v4.i4.79 | pmid = 24340131 | pmc=3856310}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the sequence AGGT has 12 (3+3+3+3) possible single point mutants AGGA, AGGG, and so on.  If 10 of those mutants are viable genotypes that may reproduce (and some of whose offspring or grandchildren may mutate back into AGGT again), we would consider that sequence a well-connected node in the cloud.  If instead only two of those mutants are viable, the rest being lethal mutations, then that sequence is poorly connected and most of its descendants will not reproduce. The analog of fitness for a quasispecies is the tendency of nearby relatives within the cloud to be well-connected, meaning that more of the mutant descendants will be viable and give rise to further descendants within the cloud.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

When the fitness of a single genotype becomes meaningless because of the high rate of mutations, the cloud as a whole or quasispecies becomes the natural unit of selection.

===Application to biological research===

Quasispecies represents the evolution of high-mutation-rate viruses such as [[HIV]] and sometimes single genes or molecules within the genomes of other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holland |last2=et. al. |year= |title=RNA virus populations as quasispecies |journal=Genetic Diversity of RNA Viruses}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Domingo |first1=E. |year=2002 |title=Quasispecies theory in virology |journal=Journal of Virology |volume=76 |pages=463–465 |doi= 10.1128/jvi.76.1.463-465.2002|url=http://jvi.asm.org/content/76/1/463.full|pmc=135734 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilke |year=2005 |title=Quasispecies theory in the context of population genetics |journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology |volume=5 |pages=44 |doi=10.1186/1471-2148-5-44 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/44|pmc=1208876 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Quasispecies models have also been proposed by Jose Fontanari and [[Emmanuel David Tannenbaum]] to model the evolution of sexual reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tannenbaum ED, Fontanari JF |year=2008 |title=A quasispecies approach to the evolution of sexual replication in unicellular organisms |journal=Theory Bioscience |volume=127 |pages=53–65 |doi=10.1007/s12064-008-0023-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quasispecies was also shown in compositional replicators (based on the [[Gard model]] for [[abiogenesis]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gross |first1=R. |last2=Fouxon |first2=I. |last3=Lancet |first3=D. |last4=Markovitch |first4=O. |year=2014 |title=Quasispecies in population of compositional assemblies |journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology |volume=14 |pages=2623 |doi=10.1186/s12862-014-0265-1 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/14/2623/abstract |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102125325/http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/14/2623/abstract |archivedate=January 2, 2015 |pmid=25547629 |pmc=4357159}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also suggested to be applicable to describe cell's replication, which amongst other things requires the maintenance and evolution of the internal composition of the parent and bud.

==Formal background==

The model rests on four assumptions{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}:
# The self-replicating entities can be represented as sequences composed of a small number of building blocks—for example, sequences of RNA consisting of the four bases [[adenine]], [[guanine]], [[cytosine]], and [[uracil]].
# New sequences enter the system solely as the result of a copy process, either correct or erroneous, of other sequences that are already present.
# The substrates, or raw materials, necessary for ongoing replication are always present in sufficient quantity. Excess sequences are washed away in an outgoing flux.
# Sequences may decay into their building blocks. The probability of decay does not depend on the sequences' age; old sequences are just as likely to decay as young sequences.

In the quasispecies model, [[mutation]]s occur through errors made in the process of copying already existing sequences. Further, [[natural selection|selection]] arises because different types of sequences tend to replicate at different rates, which leads to the suppression of sequences that replicate more slowly in favor of sequences that replicate faster. However, the quasispecies model does not predict the ultimate extinction of all but the fastest replicating sequence. Although the sequences that replicate more slowly cannot sustain their abundance level by themselves, they are constantly replenished as sequences that replicate faster mutate into them. At equilibrium, removal of slowly replicating sequences due to decay or outflow is balanced by replenishing, so that even relatively slowly replicating sequences can remain present in finite abundance.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Due to the ongoing production of mutant sequences, selection does not act on single sequences, but on mutational "clouds" of closely related sequences, referred to as ''quasispecies''. In other words, the evolutionary success of a particular sequence depends not only on its own replication rate, but also on the replication rates of the mutant sequences it produces, and on the replication rates of the sequences of which it is a mutant. As a consequence, the sequence that replicates fastest may even disappear completely in selection-mutation equilibrium, in favor of more slowly replicating sequences that are part of a quasispecies with a higher average growth rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schuster P, Swetina J |date=November 1988 |title=Stationary mutant distributions and evolutionary optimization |journal=Bulletin of Mathematical Biology |volume=50 |issue=6  |pages=635–660 |issn=0092-8240 |doi=10.1007/BF02460094 |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |location=Dordrecht |pmid=3219448}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mutational clouds as predicted by the quasispecies model have been observed in RNA viruses and in ''in vitro'' RNA replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Domingo E, Holland JJ |date=October 1997 |title=RNA virus mutations and fitness for survival |journal=Annual Review of Microbiology |volume=51 |pages=151–178  |doi=10.1146/annurev.micro.51.1.151 |pmid=9343347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Burch CL, Chao L |year=2000 |title=Evolvability of an RNA virus is determined by its mutational neighbourhood |journal=Nature |volume=406 |pages=625–628 |doi=10.1038/35020564 |pmid=10949302 |issue=6796}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mutation rate and the general fitness of the molecular sequences and their neighbors is crucial to the formation of a quasispecies. If the mutation rate is zero, there is no exchange by mutation, and each sequence is its own species. If the mutation rate is too high, exceeding what is known as the [[Error threshold (evolution)|error threshold]], the quasispecies will break down and be dispersed over the entire range of available sequences.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Mathematical description==

A simple mathematical model for a quasispecies is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eigen|first=Manfred|last2=McCaskill|first2=John|last3=Schuster|first3=Peter|title=Molecular quasi-species|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/j100335a010|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry|language=en|volume=92|issue=24|pages=6881–6891|doi=10.1021/j100335a010|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-002C-84A7-C}}&lt;/ref&gt; let there be  &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;  possible sequences and let there be &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; organisms with sequence ''i''. Let's say that each of these organisms asexually gives rise to &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; offspring. Some are duplicates of their parent, having sequence ''i'', but some are mutant and have some other sequence. Let the mutation rate &lt;math&gt;q_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; correspond to the [[probability]] that a ''j'' type parent will produce an ''i'' type organism. Then the [[Expected value|expected]] fraction of offspring generated by ''j'' type organisms that would be ''i'' type organisms is &lt;math&gt;w_{ij}=A_j q_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\sum_i q_{ij}=1&lt;/math&gt;.

Then the total number of ''i''-type organisms after the first round of reproduction, given as &lt;math&gt;n'_i&lt;/math&gt;, is

:&lt;math&gt;n'_i=\sum_j w_{ij}n_j&lt;/math&gt;

Sometimes a death rate term &lt;math&gt;D_i&lt;/math&gt; is included so that:

:&lt;math&gt;w_{ij}=A_j q_{ij}-D_i\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to 1 when i=j and is zero otherwise. Note that the ''n-th'' generation can be found by just taking the ''n-th'' power of '''W''' substituting it in place of '''W''' in the above formula.

This is just a [[system of linear equations]]. The usual way to solve such a system is to first [[Diagonalizable matrix|diagonalize]] the '''W''' matrix. Its diagonal entries will be [[eigenvalues]] corresponding to certain linear combinations of certain subsets of sequences which will be [[eigenvectors]] of the '''W''' matrix. These subsets of sequences are the quasispecies.  Assuming that the matrix '''W''' is a [[primitive matrix]] ([[Irreducibility (mathematics)|irreducible]] and [[Perron–Frobenius theorem|aperiodic]]), then after very many generations only the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue will prevail, and it is this quasispecies that will eventually dominate. The components of this eigenvector give the relative abundance of each sequence at equilibrium.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

=== Note about primitive matrices ===

'''W''' being primitive means that for some integer &lt;math&gt; n &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;, that the &lt;math&gt;n^{th} &lt;/math&gt; power of '''W''' is &gt; 0, i.e. all the entries are positive.  If '''W''' is primitive then each type can, through a sequence of mutations (i.e. powers of '''W''') mutate into all the other types after some number of generations. '''W''' is not primitive if it is periodic, where the population can perpetually cycle through different disjoint sets of compositions, or if it is reducible, where the dominant species (or quasispecies) that develops can depend on the initial population, as is the case in the simple example given below.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===Alternative formulations===

The quasispecies formulae may be expressed as a set of linear differential equations. If we consider the difference between the new state &lt;math&gt;n'_i&lt;/math&gt; and the old state &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; to be the state change over one moment of time, then we can state that the time derivative of &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; is given by this difference,   &lt;math&gt;\dot{n}_i = n'_i-n_i&lt;/math&gt; we can write:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{n}_i=\sum_j w_{ij}n_j-n_i&lt;/math&gt;

The quasispecies equations are usually expressed in terms of concentrations &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; where

:&lt;math&gt;x_i\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \frac{n_i}{\sum_j n_j}&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;x'_i\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \frac{n'_i}{\sum_j n'_j}&lt;/math&gt;.

The above equations for the quasispecies then become for the discrete version:

:&lt;math&gt;x'_i = \frac{\sum_j w_{ij}x_j}{\sum_{ij} w_{ij}x_j}&lt;/math&gt;

or, for the continuum version:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_i =\sum_j w_{ij}x_j-x_i\sum_{ij}w_{ij}x_j.&lt;/math&gt;

===Simple example===
The quasispecies concept can be illustrated by a simple system consisting of 4 sequences. Sequences [0,0], [0,1], [1,0], and [1,1] are numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Let's say the [0,0] sequence never mutates and always produces a single offspring. Let's say the other 3 sequences all produce, on average, &lt;math&gt;1-k&lt;/math&gt; replicas of themselves, and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; of each of the other two types, where &lt;math&gt;0\le k\le 1&lt;/math&gt;. The '''W''' matrix is then:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{W}=
\begin{bmatrix}
1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;1-k&amp;k&amp;k\\
0&amp;k&amp;1-k&amp;k\\
0&amp;k&amp;k&amp;1-k
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;.

The diagonalized matrix is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{W'}=
\begin{bmatrix}
1-2k&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;1-2k&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1+k
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;.

And the eigenvectors corresponding to these eigenvalues are:

:{| class="wikitable"
|-
![[Eigenvalue]] !! [[Eigenvector]]
|-
|1-2k || [0,-1,0,1]
|-
| 1-2k || [0,-1,1,0]
|-
| 1 || [1,0,0,0]
|-
| 1+k || [0,1,1,1]
|}

Only the eigenvalue &lt;math&gt;1+k&lt;/math&gt; is more than unity. For the n-th generation, the corresponding eigenvalue will be &lt;math&gt;(1+k)^n&lt;/math&gt; and so will increase without bound as time goes by. This eigenvalue corresponds to the eigenvector [0,1,1,1], which represents the quasispecies consisting of sequences 2, 3, and 4, which will be present in equal numbers after a very long time. Since all population numbers must be positive,  the first two quasispecies are not legitimate. The third quasispecies consists of only the non-mutating sequence 1. It's seen that even though sequence 1 is the most fit in the sense that it reproduces more of itself than any other sequence, the quasispecies consisting of the other three sequences will eventually dominate (assuming that the initial population was not homogeneous of the sequence 1 type).{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26504">'''Rod calculus''' or rod calculation is the mechanical method of [[algorithm]]ic computation with [[counting rods]] in China from the [[Warring States]] to [[Ming dynasty]] before the counting rods were replaced by the more convenient and faster [[abacus]]. Rod calculus played a key role in the development of Chinese mathematics to its height in [[Song Dynasty]] and [[Yuan Dynasty]], culminating in the invention
of [[polynomial equation]]s of up to four unknowns in the work of [[Zhu Shijie]].
[[File:Counting board.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Japanese counting board with grids]]
[[File:Yanghui Yongle Dadian.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Rod calculus facsimile from the [[Yongle encyclopedia]]]]

==Hardware==
The basic equipment for carrying out rod calculus is a bundle of [[counting rods]] and a counting board. The counting rods are usually made of bamboo sticks, about 12&amp;nbsp;cm- 15&amp;nbsp;cm in length, 2mm to 4&amp;nbsp;mm diameter, sometimes from animal bones, or ivory and jade (for well-heeled merchants). A counting board could be a table top, a wooden board with or without grid, on the floor or on sand.

In 1971 Chinese archaeologists unearthed a bundle of well-preserved animal bone counting rods stored in a silk pouch from a tomb in Qian Yang county in Shanxi province, dated back to the first half of [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC – 8AD). In 1975 a bundle of bamboo counting rods was unearthed.

The use of counting rods for rod calculus flourished in the [[Warring States]], although no archaeological artefacts were found earlier than the Western Han Dynasty (the first half of [[Han dynasty]]; however, archaeologists did unearth software artefacts of rod calculus dated back to the [[Warring States]]); since the rod calculus software must have gone along with rod calculus hardware, there is no doubt that rod calculus was already flourishing during the Warring States more than 2,200 years ago.

==Software==
The key software required for rod calculus was a simple 45 phrase positional decimal multiplication table used in China since antiquity, called the [[nine-nine table]], which were learned by heart by pupils, merchants, government officials and mathematicians alike.

==Rod Numerals==

===Displaying Numbers===
[[File:Chounumerals.svg|right|thumb|300px|Two forms of Chinese rod numerals]]
[[File:Rod231.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Representation of the number 231 and possible misleading rod placements.]]
Rod numerals is the only numeric system that uses different placement combination of a single symbol to convey any number or fraction in the Decimal System. For numbers in the units place, every vertical rod represent 1. Two vertical rods represent 2, and so on, until 5 vertical rods, which represents 5. For number between 6 and 9, a [[biquinary]] system is used, in which a horizontal bar on top of the vertical bars represent 5. The first row are the number 1 to 9 in rod numerals, and the second row is the same numbers in horizontal form.

For numbers larger than 9, a [[decimal|decimal system]] is used. Rods placed one place to the left of the units place represent 10 times that number. For the hundreds place, another set of rods is placed to the left which represents 100 times of that number, and so on. As shown in the adjacent image, the number 231 is represented in rod numerals in the top row, with one rod in the units place representing 1, three rods in the tens place representing 30, and two rods in the hundreds place representing 200, with a sum of 231.

When doing calculation, usually there was no grid on the surface. If rod numerals two, three, and one is placed consecutively in the vertical form, there's a possibility of it being mistaken for 51 or 24, as shown in the second and third row of the adjacent image. To avoid confusion, number in consecutive places are placed in alternating vertical and horizontal form, with the units place in vertical form,&lt;ref&gt;Ronan and Needham, The Shorter Science and Civilisation in China, vol 2, Chapter 1, Mathematics&lt;/ref&gt; as shown in the bottom row on the right.

In [[Counting rods|Rod numerals]], zeroes are represented by a space, which serves both as a number and a place holder value. Unlike in [[Arabic numerals]], there is no specific symbol to represent zero. In the adjacent image, the number zero is merely represented with a space.

===Negative and Positive Numbers===
[[Song Dynasty|Song]] mathematicians used red to represent positive numbers and black for [[negative numbers]]. However, another way is to add a slash to the last place to show that the number is negative.&lt;ref&gt;*Ho Peng Yoke， Li， Qi and Shu {{ISBN|0-486-41445-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decimal fraction===
The Mathematical Treatise of Sunzi used decimal fraction metrology. The unit of length was 1 ''chi'',

1 ''chi''=10''cun'',1''cun''=10''fen'',1''fen''=10''li'',1''li''=10''hao'',1''hou''=10''hu''.

1 ''chi''2''cun''3''fen''4''li''5''hao''6''shi''7''hu'' is laid out on counting board as

where [[File:Counting rod v1.png|8px]] is the unit measurement ''chi''.

[[Southern Song dynasty]] mathematicial [[Qin Jiushao]] extended the use of decimal fraction beyond metrology. In his book [[Shu shu Jiuzhang]]

he formally expressed 1.1446154 day as

::::::日

He marked the unit with a word “日”(day) underneath it。&lt;ref&gt;Lam Lay Yong, p87-88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Addition==
[[File:Rod calculus addition.GIF|thumb|right|280px|Rod calculus addition 3748+289=4037]]
Rod calculus works on the principle of addition. Unlike [[Arabic numerals]], digits represented by counting rods have additive properties. The process of addition involves mechanically moving the rods without the need of memorising an [[addition table]]. This is the biggest difference with Arabic numerals, as one cannot mechanically put 1 and 2 together to form 3, or 2 and 3 together to form 5.

The adjacent image presents the steps in adding 3748 to 289:
#Place the [[augend]] 3748 in the first row, and the [[addend]] 289 in the second.
#Calculate from LEFT to RIGHT, from the 2 of 289 first.
#Take away two rod from the bottom add to 7 on top to make 9.
#Move 2 rods from top to bottom 8, carry one to forward to 9, which becomes zero and carries to 3 to make 4, remove 8 from bottom row.
#Move one rod from 8 on top row to 9 on bottom to form a carry one to next rank and add one rod to 2 rods on top row to make 3 rods, top row left 7.
#Result 3748+289=4037

The rods in the augend change throughout the addition, while the rods in the addend at the bottom "disappear".

==Subtraction==
[[File:Rod subtraction.jpg|right|300px]]

===Without Borrowing===
In situation in which no [[Carry (arithmetic)|borrowing]] is needed, one only needs to take the number of rods in the [[subtrahend]] from the [[minuend]]. The result of the calculation is the difference. The adjacent image shows the steps in subtracting 23 from 54.

[[File:Rod subtraction with carry.GIF|left|300px]]

===Borrowing===
In situations in which borrowing is needed such as 4231-789, one need use a more complicated procedure. The steps for this example are shown on the left.
#Place the minuend 4231 on top, the subtrahend 789 on the bottom. Calculate from the left to the right.
#Borrow 1 from the thousands place for a ten in the hundreds place, minus 7 from the row below, the difference 3 is added to the 2 on top to form 5. The 7 on the bottom is subtracted, shown by the space.
#Borrow 1 from the hundreds place, which leaves 4. The 10 in the tens place minus the 8 below results in 2, which is added to the 3 above to form 5. The top row now is 3451, the bottom 9.
#Borrow 1 from the 5 in the tens place on top, which leaves 4. The 1 borrowed from the tens is 10 in the units place, subtracting 9 which results in 1, which are added to the top to form 2. With all rods in the bottom row subtracted, the 3442 in the top row is then, the result of the calculation

==Multiplication==
[[File:Multiplication algorithm.GIF|thumb|left|150px|38x76=2888]]
[[File:Al Uqlidisi multiplication.GIF|thumb|right|150px|al Uqlidis (952 AD)multiplication, a variation of Sunzi multiplication]]
''[[Sunzi Suanjing]]'' described in detail the algorithm of multiplication. On the left are the steps to calculate 38×76:
#Place the [[multiplicand]] on top, the multiplier on bottom. Line up the units place of the multiplier with the highest place of the multiplicand. Leave room in the middle for recording.
#Start calculating from the highest place of the multiplicand (in the example, calculate 30×76, and then 8×76). Using the [[multiplication table]] 3 times 7 is 21. Place 21 in rods in the middle, with 1 aligned with the tens place of the multiplier (on top of 7). Then, 3 times 6 equals 18, place 18 as it is shown in the image. With the 3 in the multiplicand multiplied totally, take the rods off.
#Move the multiplier one place to the right. Change 7 to horizontal form, 6 to vertical.
#8×7 = 56, place 56 in the second row in the middle, with the units place aligned with the digits multiplied in the multiplier. Take 7 out of the multiplier since it has been multiplied.
#8×6 = 48, 4 added to the 6 of the last step makes 10, carry 1 over. Take off 8 of the units place in the multiplicand, and take off 6 in the units place of the multiplier.
#Sum the 2380 and 508 in the middle, which results in 2888: the product.

==Division==

[[File:Division with remainder.GIF|thumb|left|120px|Sunzi division {{nowrap|{{sfrac|309|7}} {{=}} 44{{sfrac|1|7}}}}]]
[[File:AL Khwarizmi division.GIF|thumb|left|120px|al Khwarizmi division of 825AD was identical to Sunzi division algorithm]].

[[File:Kushyar ibn Labban division.GIF|right|thumb|120px|11th century Kushyar ibn Labban division, a replica of Sunzi division]]

The animation on the left shows the steps for calculating {{nowrap|{{sfrac|309|7}} {{=}} 44{{sfrac|1|7}}}}.
#Place the dividend, 309, in the middle row and the divisor, 7, in the bottom row. Leave space for the top row.
#Move the divisor, 7, one place to the left, changing it to horizontal form.
#Using the [[Chinese multiplication table]] and division, 30÷7 equals 4 remainder 2. Place the quotient, 4, in the top row and the remainder, 2, in the middle row.
#Move the divisor one place to the right, changing it to vertical form. 29÷7 equals 4 remainder 1. Place the quotient, 4, on top, leaving the divisor in place. Place the remainder in the middle row in place of the dividend in this step. The result is the quotient is 44 with a remainder of 1

The Sunzi algorithm for division was transmitted in toto by [[al Khwarizmi]] to Islamic country from Indian sources in 825AD. Al Khwarizmi's book was translated into Latin in the 13th century, The Sunzi division algorithm later evolved into [[Galley division]] in Europe. The division algorithm in [[Abu'l-Hasan al-Uqlidisi]]'s 925AD book ''Kitab al-Fusul fi al-Hisab al-Hindi'' and in 11th century [[Kushyar ibn Labban]]'s [[Principles of Hindu Reckoning]] were identical to Sunzu's division algorithm.

[[File:Rod fraction.jpg|right|250px]]

==Fractions==
If there is a remainder in a place value decimal rod calculus division, both the remainder and the divisor must be left in place with one on top of another. In [[Liu Hui]]'s notes to [[Jiuzhang suanshu]] (2nd century BCE), the number on top is called "shi" (实), while the one at bottom is called "fa" (法). In ''[[Sunzi Suanjing]]'', the number on top is called "zi" (子) or "fenzi" (lit., son of fraction), and the one on the bottom is called "mu" (母) or "fenmu" (lit., mother of fraction). Fenzi and Fenmu are also the modern Chinese name for [[numerator]] and [[denominator]], respectively. As shown on the right, 1 is the numerator remainder, 7 is the denominator divisor, formed a fraction {{sfrac|1|7}}. The quotient of the division {{sfrac|309|7}} is 44 + {{sfrac|1|7}}.
Liu Hui's used a lot of calculations with fraction in [[Haidao Suanjing]].

This form of fraction with numerator on top and denominator at bottom without a horizontal bar in between, was transmitted to Arabic country in an 825AD book by [[al Khwarizmi]] via India, and in use by 10th century [[Abu'l-Hasan al-Uqlidisi]] and 15th century [[Jamshīd al-Kāshī]]'s work "Arithematic Key".

===Addition===
[[File:ROD FRACTION ADDITION.GIF|thumb|left|150px|rod calculus fraction addition]]
{{nowrap|{{sfrac|1|3}} + {{sfrac|2|5}}}}

*Put the two numerators 1 and 2 on the left side of counting board, put the two denominators 3 and 5 at the right hand side
*Cross multiply 1 with 5, 2 with 3 to get 5 and 6, replace the numerators with the corresponding cross products.
*Multiply the two denominators 3 × 5 = 15, put at bottom right
*Add the two numerators 5 and 6 = 11 put on top right of counting board.
*Result: {{nowrap|{{sfrac|1|3}} + {{sfrac|2|5}} {{=}} {{sfrac|11|15}}}}

===Subtraction===
[[File:ROD FRACTION SUBTRACTION.GIF|thumb|left|150px|subtraction of two rod numeral fractions]]
{{nowrap|{{sfrac|8|9}} − {{sfrac|1|5}}}}
*Put down the rod numeral for numerators 1 and 8 at left hand side of a counting board
*Put down the rods for denominators 5 and 9 at the right hand side of a counting board
*Cross multiply 1 × 9 = 9, 5 × 8 = 40, replace the corresponding numerators
*Multiply the denominators 5 × 9 = 45, put 45 at the bottom right of counting board, replace the denominator 5
*Subtract 40 − 9 = 31, put on top right.
*Result: {{nowrap|{{sfrac|8|9}} − {{sfrac|1|5}} {{=}} {{sfrac|31|45}}}}

*shi divided by fa: {{nowrap|3{{sfrac|1|3}} × 5{{sfrac|2|5}} {{=}} 18}}

===Highest common factor and fraction reduction===
[[File:Hcf.GIF|thumb|right|200px|highest common factor]]
The algorithm for finding the highest common factor of two numbers and reduction of
fraction was laid out in [[Jiuzhang suanshu]].
The highest common factor is found by successive division with remainders until
the last two remainders are identical.
The animation on the right illustrates the algorithm for finding the highest common factor of {{sfrac|32,450,625|59,056,400}} and reduction of a fraction.

In this case the hcf is 25.

Divide the numerator and denominator by 25. The [[reduced fraction]] is {{sfrac|1,298,025|2,362,256}}.

===Interpolation===
[[File:Diaorifa.GIF|thumb|left|100px|{{pi}} in fraction]]
Calendarist and mathematician [[He Chengtian]] ([[:zh:何承天 (南朝)|何承天]]) used fraction interpolation method, called "harmonisation of the divisor of the day" to obtain a better approximate value than the old one by iteratively adding the numerators and denominators a "weaker" fraction with a "stronger fraction".&lt;ref&gt;Jean claude Martzloff, A History of Chinese Mathematics p281&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zu Chongzhi]]'s legendary {{nowrap|{{pi}} {{=}} {{sfrac|355|113}}}} could be obtained with He Chengtian's method&lt;ref&gt;Wu Wenjun ed Grand Series of History of Chinese Mathematics vol 4 p125&lt;/ref&gt;

==System of linear equations==
[[File:Fangcheng.GIF|thumb|left|400px|system equations]]
Chapter Eight ''Rectangular Arrays of [[Jiuzhang suanshu]] provided an algorithm for solving [[System of linear equations]] by [[method of elimination]]:&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Claude Martzloff, A History of Chinese Mathematics, p249-257&lt;/ref&gt;

Problem 8-1: Suppose we have 3 bundles of top quality cereals, 2 bundles of medium quality cereals, and a bundle of low quality cereal with accumulative weight of 39 dou. We also have 2, 3 and 1 bundles of respective cereals amounting to 34 dou; we also have 1,2 and 3 bundles of respective cereals, totaling 26 dou.

Find the quantity of top, medium, and poor quality cereals.
In algebra, this problem can be expressed in three system equations with three unknowns.

::::3x+2y+z=39
::::2x+3y+z=34
::::x+2y+3z=26

This problem was solved in [[Jiuzhang suanshu]] with counting rods laid out on a counting board in a tabular format similar to a 3x4 matrix:
{| border="0" width="500" align="center" style="border: 5px solid #999; background-color:#FFFFFF"
|-align="center" bgcolor="#EFEFEF"

| [[File:Counting rod h3.png|20px]] [[File:Counting rod v9.png|20px]]
|}
Algorithm:

* Multiply the center column with right column top quality number.
* Repeatedly subtract right column from center column, until the top number of center column =0
* multiply the left column with the value of top row of right column
* Repeatedly subtract right column from left column, until the top number of left column=0
* After applying above elimination algorithm to the reduced center column and left column, the matrix was reduced to triangular shape:
{| border="0" width="500" align="center" style="border: 5px solid #999; background-color:#FFFFFF"
|-align="center" bgcolor="#EFEFEF"
| quality
| left column
| center column

| [[File:Counting rod h3.png|20px]] [[File:Counting rod v9.png|20px]]
|}
The amount of on bundle of low quality cereal =&lt;math&gt;\frac{99}{36}=2 \frac{3}{4}&lt;/math&gt;

From which the amount of one bundle of top and medium quality cereals can be found easily:

One bundle of top quality cereals=9 dou &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;

One bundle of medium cereal=4 dou &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;&gt;

==Extraction of Square root==
Algorithm for extraction of square root was described in [[Jiuzhang suanshu]] and with minor difference in terminology in [[Sunzi Suanjing]].
[[File:Sunzi sqrt.GIF|thumb|left|300px|extraction of square root of 234567 in [[Sunzi Suanjing]]]]
[[File:Labbansqrt.GIF|thumb|right|120px|extraction of sq root by Kushyar ibn Labban]]
The animation shows the algorithm for rod calculus extraction of an approximation of the square root &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{234567}\approx484\tfrac{311}{968}&lt;/math&gt; from the algorithm in chap 2 problem 19 of Sunzi Suanjing:
:''Now there is a square area 234567, find one side of the square''.&lt;ref&gt;Lay Lay Yong, Ang Tian Se, Fleeting Footsteps, p66-73&lt;/ref&gt;

The algorithm is as follows:
* Set up 234567 on the counting board, on the second row from top, named '''shi'''
* Set up a marker 1 at 10000 position at the 4th row named '''xia fa'''
* Estimate the first digit of square root to be counting rod numeral 4, put on the top row ('''shang''') hundreds position,
* Multiply the shang 4 with xiafa 1, put the product 4 on 3rd row named '''fang fa'''
* Multiply '''shang''' with '''fang fa''' deduct the product 4x4=16 from '''shi''': 23-16=7, remain numeral 7.
* double up the '''fang fa''' 4 to become 8, shift one position right, and change the vertical 8 into horizontal 8 after moved right.
* Move '''xia fa''' two position right.
* Estimate second digit of '''shang''' as 8: put numeral 8 at tenth position on top row.
* Multiply '''xia fa''' with the new digit of '''shang''', add to '''fang fa'''
.
* 8 calls 8 =64, subtract 64 from top row numeral "74", leaving one rod at the most significant digit.
* double the last digit of '''fang fa''' 8, add to 80 =96
* Move '''fang fa'''96 one position right, change convention;move '''xia fa''' "1" two position right.
* Estimate 3rd digit of '''shang''' to be 4.
* Multiply new digit of '''shang''' 4 with '''xia fa''' 1, combined with '''fang fa''' to make 964.
* subtract successively 4*9=36,4*6=24,4*4=16 from the '''shi''', leaving 311
* double the last digit 4 of '''fang fa''' into 8 and merge with '''fang fa'''
* result &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{234567}\approx484\tfrac{311}{968}&lt;/math&gt;

North Song dynasty mathematician [[Jia Xian]] developed an [[Jia Xian#Additive multiplicative method of square root extration|additive multiplicative algorithm for square root extraction]], in which he replaced the traditional "doubling" of "fang fa" by adding
'''shang''' digit to '''fang fa''' digit, with same effect.

==Extraction of cubic root==
[[File:Jia Xian cubic root.GIF|thumb|right|300px|Jia Xian's additive multiplicative method of cubic root extraction]]
[[Jiuzhang suanshu]] vol iv "shaoguang" provided algorithm for extraction of cubic root.

〔一九〕今有積一百八十六萬八百六十七尺。問為立方幾何？答曰：一百二十三尺。

problem 19: We have a 1860867 cubic chi, what is the length of a side ? Answer:123 chi.

North Song dynasty mathematician [[Jia Xian]] invented a method similar to simplified form of [[Horner scheme]] for extraction of cubic root.
The animation at right shows Jia Xian's algorithm for solving problem 19 in Jiuzhang suanshu vol 4.

&lt;math&gt;\sqrt[3](1860867)=123&lt;/math&gt;

South Song dynasty mathematician [[Qin Jiushao]] improved Jia Xian's Horner method to solve polynomial equation up to 10th order.
The following is algorithm for solving

==Tian Yuan shu==
[[File:益古第八问.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Tian yuan shu in Li Zhi:[[Yigu yanduan]]]]
Yuan dynasty mathematician [[Li Zhi (mathematician)|Li Zhi]] developed rod calculus into [[Tian yuan shu]]

Example Li Zhi Ceyuan haijing vol II, problem 14 equation of one unknown:

==Polynomial equations of four unknowns==
[[File:Sixianghuiyuan.jpg|thumb|right|400px|facsimile of Zhu Shijie: Jade Mirror of Four Unknowns]]
Mathematician [[Zhu Shijie]] further developed rod calculus to include polynomial equations of 2 to four unknowns.

For example, polynomials of three unknowns:

Equation 1:&lt;math&gt;-y-z-y^2*x-x+xyz=0&lt;/math&gt;

:::::::::::{{v-1}}太{{v-1}}
::::::::::::{{v1}}
::::::::::{{v-1}}{{Rod0}}{{v-1}}

While modern mathematics uses many types of spaces, such as [[Euclidean space]]s, [[linear space]]s, [[topological space]]s, [[Hilbert space]]s, or [[probability space]]s, it does not define the notion of "space" itself.&lt;ref name="carlson"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/177937/difference-between-space-and-mathematical-structure |title=Difference between 'space' and 'mathematical structure'?|first1= Kevin|last1= Carlson|date=August 2, 2012|work=Stack Exchange}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="details"&gt;Similarly, several types of numbers are in use (natural, integral, rational, real, complex); each one has its own definition; but just "number" is not used as a mathematical notion and has no definition.&lt;/ref&gt;

A space consists of selected mathematical objects that are treated as points, and selected relationships between these points. 
The nature of the points can vary widely: for example, the points can be elements of a set, functions on another space, or subspaces of another space. It is the relationships that define the nature of the space. More precisely, isomorphic spaces are considered identical, where an [[isomorphism]] between two spaces is a one-to-one correspondence between their points that preserves the relationships. For example, the relationships between the points of a three-dimensional Euclidean space are uniquely determined by Euclid's axioms,&lt;ref group="details" name=axioms&gt;Reformed [[Euclidean_geometry#Logical_basis|by Hilbert, Tarski and Birkhoff]] in order to avoid hidden assumptions found in [[w:Euclid's Elements|Euclid's Elements]].&lt;/ref&gt; and all three-dimensional Euclidean spaces are considered identical.

Topological notions such as continuity have natural definitions in every Euclidean space. 
However, topology does not distinguish straight lines from curved lines, and the relation between Euclidean and topological spaces is thus "forgetful". Relations of this kind are sketched in Figure 1, and treated in more detail in the Section [[#Types of spaces|"Types of spaces"]]. 

It is not always clear whether a given mathematical object should be considered as a geometric "space", or an  algebraic "structure". A general definition of "structure", proposed by [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]],&lt;ref name="BS"&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1968|loc=Chapter IV}}&lt;/ref&gt; embraces all common types of spaces, provides a general definition of isomorphism, and justifies the transfer of properties between isomorphic structures.

===Before the golden age of geometry===

[[File:Homothety.svg|thumb|275px|Homothety transforms a geometric figure into a similar one by scaling.]]

In ancient Greek mathematics, "space" was a geometric abstraction of the three-dimensional reality observed in everyday life. About 300 BC, [[Euclid]] gave axioms for the properties of space. Euclid built all of mathematics on these geometric foundations, going so far as to define numbers by comparing the lengths of line segments to the length of a chosen reference segment.

The method of coordinates ([[analytic geometry]]) was adopted by [[René Descartes]] in 1637.&lt;ref name="EDM987"&gt;{{harvnb|Itô|1993|loc=page 987}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, geometric theorems were treated as absolute objective truths knowable through intuition and reason, similar to objects of natural science;&lt;ref name=Bb94&gt;{{Cite book | last = Bourbaki | first = Nicolas | author-link=w:Nicolas Bourbaki | title = Elements of the history of mathematics | year = 1994 | publisher = Masson (original), Springer (translation) |isbn=978-3-540-64767-6 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-61693-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}} and axioms were treated as obvious implications of definitions.&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|15}}

Two [[equivalence relation]]s between geometric figures were used: [[Congruence (geometry)|congruence]] and [[Similarity (geometry)|similarity]]. Translations, rotations and reflections transform a figure into congruent figures; [[Homothetic transformation|homotheties]] — into similar figures. For example, all circles are mutually similar, but ellipses are not similar to circles. A third equivalence relation, introduced by [[Gaspard Monge]] in 1795, occurs in [[projective geometry]]: not only ellipses, but also parabolas and hyperbolas, turn into circles under appropriate projective transformations; they all are projectively equivalent figures.

The relation between the two geometries, Euclidean and projective,&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|133}} shows that mathematical objects are not given to us ''with their structure''.&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|21}} Rather, each mathematical theory describes its objects by ''some'' of their properties, precisely those that are put as axioms at the foundations of the theory.&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|20}}

Distances and angles cannot appear in theorems of projective geometry, since these notions are neither mentioned in the axioms of projective geometry nor defined from the notions mentioned there. The question "what is the sum of the three angles of a triangle" is meaningful in Euclidean geometry but meaningless in projective geometry.

A different situation appeared in the 19th century: in some geometries the sum of the three angles of a triangle is well-defined but different from the classical value (180 degrees). Non-Euclidean [[hyperbolic geometry]], introduced by [[Nikolai Lobachevsky]] in 1829 and [[János Bolyai]] in 1832 (and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] in 1816, unpublished)&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|133}} stated that the sum depends on the triangle and is always less than 180 degrees. [[Eugenio Beltrami]] in 1868 and [[Felix Klein]] in 1871 obtained Euclidean "models" of the non-Euclidean hyperbolic geometry, and thereby completely justified this theory as a logical possibility.&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|24}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink1=Jeremy Gray |first1=Jeremy |last1= Gray |date=1989 |title=Ideas of Space: Euclidean, Non-Euclidean and Relativistic |edition=second |publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] |isbn=978-0198539353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This discovery forced the abandonment of the pretensions to the absolute truth of Euclidean geometry. It showed that axioms are not "obvious", nor "implications of definitions". Rather, they are hypotheses. To what extent do they correspond to an experimental reality? This important physical problem no longer has anything to do with mathematics. Even if a "geometry" does not correspond to an experimental reality, its theorems remain no less "mathematical truths".&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|15}}

A Euclidean model of a [[non-Euclidean geometry]] is a choice of some objects existing in Euclidean space and some relations between these objects that satisfy all axioms (and therefore, all theorems) of the non-Euclidean geometry. These Euclidean objects and relations "play" the non-Euclidean geometry like contemporary actors playing an ancient performance. Actors can imitate a situation that never occurred in reality. Relations between the actors on the stage imitate relations between the characters in the play. Likewise, the chosen relations between the chosen objects of the Euclidean model imitate the non-Euclidean relations. It shows that relations between objects are essential in mathematics, while the nature of the objects is not.

===The golden age and afterwards===
The word "geometry" (from Ancient Greek: geo- "earth", -metron "measurement") initially meant a practical way of processing lengths, regions and volumes in the space in which we live, but was then extended widely (as well as the notion of space in question here).

According to Bourbaki,&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|131}} the period between 1795 (''Géométrie descriptive'' of Monge) and 1872 (the [[Erlangen program|"Erlangen programme"]] of Klein) can be called the golden age of geometry.  The original space investigated by Euclid is now called three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. Its axiomatization, started by Euclid 23 centuries ago, was reformed with [[Hilbert's axioms]], [[Tarski's axioms]] and [[Birkhoff's axioms]]. These axiom systems describe the space via [[primitive notion]]s (such as "point", "between", "congruent") constrained by a number of [[axiom]]s.

Analytic geometry made great progress and succeeded in replacing theorems of classical geometry with computations via invariants of transformation groups.&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|134,5}} Since that time, new theorems of classical geometry have been of more interest to amateurs than to professional mathematicians.&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|136}} However, the heritage of classical geometry was not lost. According to Bourbaki,&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|138}} "passed over in its role as an autonomous and living science, classical geometry is thus transfigured into a universal language of contemporary mathematics".

Simultaneously, numbers began to displace geometry as the foundation of mathematics.  For instance, in Richard Dedekind's 1872 essay ''Stetigkeit und irrationale Zahlen'' (''Continuity and irrational numbers''), he asserts that points on a line ought to have the properties of [[Dedekind cut]]s, and that therefore a line was the same thing as the set of real numbers.  Dedekind is careful to note that this is an assumption that is incapable of being proven.  In modern treatments, Dedekind's assertion is often taken to be the definition of a line, thereby reducing geometry to arithmetic.  Three-dimensional Euclidean space is defined to be an affine space whose associated vector space of differences of its elements is equipped with an inner product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Jean |last1=Gallier |title=Geometric Methods and Applications |chapter=Basics of Euclidean geometry |doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-9961-0_6 |isbn=978-1-4419-9960-3 |publisher=Springer |date=2011}} See also [http://ocw.upm.es/algebra/affine-and-projective-geometry-1/class-material OpenCourseWare].&lt;/ref&gt; A definition "from scratch", as in Euclid, is now not often used, since it does not reveal the relation of this space to other spaces. Also, a three-dimensional [[projective space]] is now defined as the space of all one-dimensional subspaces (that is, straight lines through the origin) of a four-dimensional vector space.  This shift in foundations requires a new set of axioms, and if these axioms are adopted, the classical axioms of geometry become theorems.

A space now consists of selected mathematical objects (for instance, functions on another space, or subspaces of another space, or just elements of a set) treated as points, and selected relationships between these points. Therefore, spaces are just mathematical structures of convenience. One may expect that the structures called "spaces" are perceived more geometrically than other mathematical objects, but this is not always true.

According to the famous inaugural lecture given by [[Bernhard Riemann]] in 1854, every mathematical object parametrized by ''n'' real numbers may be treated as a point of the ''n''-dimensional space of all such objects.&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|140}} Contemporary mathematicians follow this idea routinely and find it extremely suggestive to use the terminology of classical geometry nearly everywhere.&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|138}}

[[w:Function (mathematics)|Functions]] are important mathematical objects. Usually they form infinite-dimensional [[function space]]s, as noted already by Riemann&lt;ref name=Bb94/&gt;{{rp|141}} and elaborated in the 20th century by [[functional analysis]].

== Taxonomy of spaces ==

===Three taxonomic ranks===
While each type of spaces has its own definition, the general idea of "space" evades formalization. Some structures are called spaces, other are not, without a formal criterion. Moreover, there is no consensus on the general idea of "structure".
According to Pudlák,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Pavel|last=Pudlák|title=Logical Foundations of Mathematics and Computational Complexity: A Gentle Introduction|year=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-00118-0|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-00119-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Mathematics [...] cannot be explained completely by a single concept such as the mathematical structure. Nevertheless, Bourbaki's structuralist approach is the best that we have."
We will return to Bourbaki's structuralist approach in the last section "Spaces and structures", while  we now outline a possible classification of spaces (and structures) in the spirit of Bourbaki.

We classify spaces on three levels. Given that each mathematical theory describes its objects by some of their properties, the first question to ask is: which properties? This leads to the first (upper) classification level. On the second level, one takes into account answers to especially important questions (among the questions that make sense according to the first level). On the third level of classification, one takes into account answers to all possible questions.

For example, the ''upper-level classification'' distinguishes between Euclidean and [[projective space]]s, since the distance between two points is defined in Euclidean spaces but undefined in projective spaces. 
Another example. The question "what is the sum of the three angles of a triangle" makes sense in a Euclidean space but not in a projective space. In a non-Euclidean space the question makes sense but is answered differently, which is not an upper-level distinction.

Also, the distinction between a Euclidean plane and a Euclidean 3-dimensional space is not an upper-level distinction; the question "what is the dimension" makes sense in both cases.

The ''second-level classification'' distinguishes, for example, between Euclidean and non-Euclidean spaces; between finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional spaces; between compact and non-compact spaces, etc.
In Bourbaki's terms,&lt;ref name="BS" /&gt; the second-level classification is the classification by "species". Unlike biological taxonomy, a space may belong to several species.

The ''third-level classification'' distinguishes, for example, between spaces of different dimension, but does not distinguish between a plane of a three-dimensional Euclidean space, treated as a two-dimensional Euclidean space, and the set of all pairs of real numbers, also treated as a two-dimensional Euclidean space. Likewise it does not distinguish between different Euclidean models of the same non-Euclidean space.
More formally, the third level classifies spaces up to [[isomorphism]]. An isomorphism between two spaces is defined as a one-to-one correspondence between the points of the first space and the points of the second space, that preserves all relations stipulated according to the first level. Mutually isomorphic spaces are thought of as copies of a single space. If one of them belongs to a given species then they all do.

The notion of isomorphism sheds light on the upper-level classification. Given a one-to-one correspondence between two spaces of the same upper-level class, one may ask whether it is an isomorphism or not. This question makes no sense for two spaces of different classes.

An isomorphism to itself is called an automorphism. Automorphisms of a Euclidean space are shifts, rotations, reflections and compositions of these. Euclidean space is homogeneous in the sense that every point can be transformed into every other point by some automorphism.

Euclidean axioms&lt;ref group="details" name=axioms /&gt; leave no freedom; they determine uniquely all geometric properties of the space. More exactly: all three-dimensional Euclidean spaces are mutually isomorphic. In this sense we have "the" three-dimensional Euclidean space. In Bourbaki's terms, the corresponding theory is ''univalent''. In contrast, topological spaces are generally non-isomorphic; their theory is ''multivalent''. A similar idea occurs in mathematical logic: a theory is called categorical if all its models of the same cardinality are mutually isomorphic. According to Bourbaki,&lt;ref name="BSr385"&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1968|loc=page 385}}&lt;/ref&gt; the study of multivalent theories is the most striking feature which distinguishes modern mathematics from classical mathematics.

===Relations between species of spaces===
Topological notions (continuity, convergence, open sets, closed sets etc.) are defined naturally in every Euclidean space. In other words, every Euclidean space is also a topological space. Every isomorphism between two Euclidean spaces is also an isomorphism between the corresponding topological spaces (called "[[homeomorphism]]"), but the converse is wrong: a homeomorphism may distort distances. In Bourbaki's terms,&lt;ref name="BS" /&gt; "topological space" is an ''underlying'' structure of the "Euclidean space" structure. Similar ideas occur in [[category theory]]: the category of Euclidean spaces is a concrete category over the category of topological spaces; the [[Forgetful functor|forgetful]] (or "stripping") [[functor]] maps the former category to the latter category.

A three-dimensional Euclidean space is a special case of a Euclidean space. In Bourbaki's terms,&lt;ref name="BS" /&gt; the species of three-dimensional Euclidean space is ''richer'' than the species of Euclidean space. Likewise, the species of compact topological space is richer than the species of topological space.

[[File:Spaces arrows.svg|thumb|200px|Example relations between species of spaces]]

Such relations between species of spaces may be expressed diagrammatically as shown in Fig. 3. An arrow from A to B means that every {{nowrap|A-space}} is also a {{nowrap|B-space,}} or may be treated as a {{nowrap|B-space,}} or provides a {{nowrap|B-space,}} etc. Treating A and B as classes of spaces one may interpret the arrow as a transition from A to B. (In Bourbaki's terms,&lt;ref name="B-IV.1.6"&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1968|loc=Sect.IV.1.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; "procedure of deduction" of a {{nowrap|B-space}} from a {{nowrap|A-space.}} Not quite a function unless the [[Class (set theory)|classes]] A,B are sets; this nuance does not invalidate the following.) The two arrows on Fig. 3 are not invertible, but for different reasons. 

The transition from "Euclidean" to "topological" is forgetful. Topology distinguishes continuous from discontinuous, but does not distinguish rectilinear from curvilinear. Intuition tells us that the Euclidean structure cannot be restored from the topology. A proof uses an automorphism of the topological space (that is, [[self-homeomorphism]]) that is not an automorphism of the Euclidean space (that is, not a composition of shifts, rotations and reflections). Such transformation turns the given Euclidean structure into a (isomorphic but) different Euclidean structure; both Euclidean structures correspond to a single topological structure.

In contrast, the transition from "3-dim Euclidean" to "Euclidean" is not forgetful; a Euclidean space need not be 3-dimensional, but if it happens to be 3-dimensional, it is full-fledged, no structure is lost. In other words, the latter transition is [[Injective function|injective]] (one-to-one), while the former transition is not injective (many-to-one). We denote injective transitions by an arrow with a barbed tail, "↣" rather than "→".

Both transitions are not [[Surjective function|surjective]], that is, not every B-space results from some A-space. First, a 3-dim Euclidean space is a special (not general) case of a Euclidean space. Second, a topology of a Euclidean space is a special case of topology (for instance, it must be non-compact, and connected, etc). We denote surjective transitions by a two-headed arrow, "↠" rather than "→". See for example Fig. 4; there, the arrow from "real linear topological" to "real linear" is two-headed, since every real linear space admits some (at least one) topology compatible with its linear structure.

Such topology is non-unique in general, but unique when the real linear space is finite-dimensional. For these spaces the transition is both injective and surjective, that is, [[Bijection|bijective]]; see the arrow from "finite-dim real linear topological" to "finite-dim real linear" on Fig. 4. The [[Inverse function|inverse]] transition exists (and could be shown by a second, backward arrow). The two species of structures are thus equivalent. In practice, one makes no distinction between equivalent species of structures.&lt;ref name="B-IV.1.7"&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1968|loc=Sect.IV.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equivalent structures may be treated as a single structure, as shown by a large box on Fig. 4.

The transitions denoted by the arrows obey isomorphisms. That is, two isomorphic {{nowrap|A-spaces}} lead to two isomorphic {{nowrap|B-spaces}}.

The diagram on Fig. 4 is [[Commutative diagram|commutative]]. That is, all directed paths in the diagram with the same start and endpoints lead to the same result. Other diagrams below are also commutative, except for dashed arrows on Fig. 9. The arrow from "topological" to "measurable" is dashed for the reason explained there: "In order to turn a topological space into a measurable space one endows it with a σ-algebra. The σ-algebra of Borel sets is the most popular, but not the only choice." A solid arrow denotes a prevalent, so-called "canonical" transition that suggests itself naturally and is widely used, often implicitly, by default. For example, speaking about a continuous function on a Euclidean space, one need not specify its topology explicitly. In fact, alternative topologies exist and are used sometimes, for example, the [[Fine topology (potential theory)|fine topology]]; but these are always specified explicitly, since they are much less notable that the prevalent topology. A dashed arrow indicates that several transitions are in use and no one is quite prevalent.

==Types of spaces==

===Linear and topological spaces===
[[File:Spaces linear etc.svg|thumb|470px|Relations between mathematical spaces: linear, topological etc]]

Two basic spaces are [[w:linear space|linear spaces]] (also called vector spaces) and [[w:topological space|topological spaces]].

Linear spaces are of [[w:Algebra|algebraic]] nature; there are real linear spaces (over the [[w:field (mathematics)|field]] of [[w:Real number|real numbers]]),
complex linear spaces (over the field of [[w:Complex number|complex numbers]]), and more generally, linear spaces over any field. Every complex linear space is also a real linear space (the latter ''underlies'' the former), since each real number is also a complex number.&lt;ref group="details"&gt;For example, the [[w:complex plane|complex plane]] treated as a one-dimensional complex linear space may be downgraded to a two-dimensional real linear space. In contrast, the real line can be treated as a one-dimensional real linear space but not a complex linear space. See also [[w:Examples of vector spaces#Field extensions|field extensions]].&lt;/ref&gt;
More generally, a vector space over a field also has the structure of a vector space over a subfield of that field.
Linear operations, given in a linear space by definition, lead to such notions as straight lines (and planes, and other linear subspaces); parallel lines; ellipses (and ellipsoids). However, it is impossible to define 
orthogonal (perpendicular) lines, or to single out circles among ellipses, because in a linear space 
there is no structure like a scalar product that could be used for measuring angles. The dimension of a linear space is defined as the maximal number of [[linear independence|linearly independent]] vectors or, equivalently, as the minimal number of vectors that span the space; it may be finite or infinite. Two linear spaces over the same field are isomorphic if and only if they are of the same dimension. A {{nowrap|''n''-dimensional}} complex linear space is also a {{nowrap|2''n''-dimensional}} real linear space.

Topological spaces are of [[Mathematical analysis|analytic]] nature. [[Open set]]s, given in a topological space by definition, lead to such notions as [[continuous function]]s, paths, maps; [[Limit of a sequence|convergent sequences, limits]]; interior, boundary, exterior. However, [[uniform continuity]], [[bounded set]]s, [[Cauchy sequence]]s, [[differentiable function]]s (paths, maps) remain undefined. Isomorphisms between topological spaces are traditionally called homeomorphisms; these are one-to-one correspondences continuous in both directions. The [[open interval]] (0,1) is homeomorphic to the whole [[w:Real line|real line]] (-∞,∞) but not homeomorphic to the [[closed interval]] [0,1], nor to a circle. The surface of a cube is homeomorphic to a sphere (the surface of a ball) but not homeomorphic to a torus. Euclidean spaces of different dimensions are not homeomorphic, which seems evident, but is not easy to prove. The dimension of a topological space is difficult to define; [[inductive dimension]] (based on the observation that the dimension of the boundary of a geometric figure is usually one less than the dimension of the figure itself) and [[Lebesgue covering dimension (mathematics)|Lebesgue covering dimension]] can be used. In the case of a {{nowrap|''n''-dimensional}} Euclidean space, both topological dimensions are equal to ''n''.

Every subset of a topological space is itself a topological space (in contrast, only ''linear'' subsets of a linear space are linear spaces). Arbitrary topological spaces, investigated by [[general topology]] (called also point-set topology) are too diverse for a complete classification up to homeomorphism. [[Compact space|Compact topological spaces]] are an important class of topological spaces ("species" of this "type"). Every continuous function is bounded on such space. The closed interval [0,1] and the [[extended real line]] [-∞,∞] are compact; the open interval (0,1) and the line (-∞,∞) are not. Geometric topology investigates [[Manifold (geometry)|manifolds]] (another "species" of this "type"); these are topological spaces locally homeomorphic to Euclidean spaces (and satisfying a few extra conditions). Low-dimensional manifolds are completely classified up to homeomorphism.

Both the linear and topological structures underly the [[Topological vector space|linear topological space]] (in other words, topological vector space) structure. A linear topological space is both a real or complex linear space and a topological space, such that the linear operations are continuous. So a linear space that is also topological is not in general a linear topological space. 

Every finite-dimensional real or complex linear space is a linear topological space in the sense that it carries one and only one topology that makes it a linear topological space. The two structures, "finite-dimensional real or complex linear space" and "finite-dimensional linear topological space", are thus equivalent, that is, mutually underlying. Accordingly, every invertible linear transformation of a finite-dimensional linear topological space is a homeomorphism. The three notions of dimension (one algebraic and two topological) agree for finite-dimensional real linear spaces. In infinite-dimensional spaces, however, different topologies can conform to a given linear structure, and invertible linear transformations are generally not homeomorphisms.

===Affine and projective spaces===
[[File:Spaces affine etc.svg|thumb|250px|Relations between mathematical spaces: affine, projective etc]]

It is convenient to introduce [[w:Affine space|affine]] and [[w:Projective space|projective spaces]] by means of linear spaces, as follows. A {{nobr|''n''-dimensional}} linear subspace of a {{nobr|(''n''+1)-dimensional}} linear space, being itself a {{nobr|''n''-dimensional}} linear space, is not homogeneous; it contains a special point, the origin. Shifting it by a vector external to it, one obtains a {{nobr|''n''-dimensional}} affine subspace. It is homogeneous. An affine space need not be included into a linear space, but is isomorphic to an affine subspace of a linear space. All {{nobr|''n''-dimensional}} affine spaces are mutually isomorphic. In the words of [[w:John C. Baez|John Baez]], "an affine space is a vector space that's forgotten its origin". In particular, every linear space is also an affine space.

Given an {{nobr|''n''-dimensional}} affine subspace ''A'' in a {{nobr|(''n''+1)-dimensional}} linear space ''L'', a straight line in ''A'' may be defined as the intersection of ''A'' with a {{nobr|two-dimensional}} linear subspace  of ''L'' that intersects ''A'': in other words, with a plane through the origin that is not parallel to ''A''. More generally, a {{nobr|''k''-dimensional}} affine subspace of ''A'' is the intersection of ''A'' with a {{nobr|(''k''+1)-dimensional}} linear subspace of ''L'' that intersects ''A''.

Every point of the affine subspace ''A'' is the intersection of ''A'' with a {{nobr|one-dimensional}} linear subspace of ''L''. However, some {{nobr|one-dimensional}} subspaces of ''L'' are parallel to ''A''; in some sense, they intersect ''A'' at infinity. The set of all {{nobr|one-dimensional}} linear subspaces of a {{nobr|(''n''+1)-dimensional}} linear space is, by definition, a {{nobr|''n''-dimensional}} projective space. And the affine subspace ''A'' is embedded into the projective space as a proper subset. However, the projective space itself is homogeneous. A straight line in the projective space corresponds to a {{nobr|two-dimensional}} linear subspace of the (n+1)-dimensional linear space. More generally, a {{nobr|''k''-dimensional}} projective subspace of the projective space corresponds to a {{nobr|(''k''+1)-dimensional}} linear subspace of the (n+1)-dimensional linear space, and is isomorphic to the {{nobr|''k''-dimensional}} projective space.

Defined this way, affine and projective spaces are of algebraic nature; they can be real, complex, and more generally, over any field.

Every real or complex affine or projective space is also a topological space. An affine space is a non-compact manifold; a projective space is a compact manifold. In a real projective space a straight line is homeomorphic to a circle, therefore compact, in contrast to a straight line in a linear of affine space.

===Metric and uniform spaces===
[[File:Spaces metric etc.svg|thumb|480px|Relations between mathematical spaces: metric, uniform etc]]

Distances between points are defined in a [[w:Metric space|metric space]]. Isomorphisms between metric spaces are called isometries. Every metric space is also a topological space. A topological space is called [[w:Metrizable|metrizable]], if it underlies a metric space. All manifolds are metrizable.

In a metric space, we can define 
bounded sets and Cauchy sequences. A metric space is called [[w:Complete metric space|complete]] if all Cauchy sequences converge. Every incomplete space is isometrically embedded, as a dense subset, into a complete space (the completion). Every compact metric space is complete; the real line is non-compact but complete; the open interval (0,1) is incomplete. 

Every Euclidean space is also a complete metric space. Moreover, all geometric notions immanent to a Euclidean space can be characterized in terms of its metric. For example, the straight segment connecting two given points ''A'' and ''C'' consists of all points ''B'' such that the distance between ''A'' and ''C'' is equal to the sum of two distances, between ''A'' and ''B'' and between ''B'' and ''C''.

The [[w:Hausdorff dimension|Hausdorff dimension]] (related to the number of small balls that cover the given set) applies to metric spaces, and can be non-integer (especially for [[w:Fractal|fractals]]). For a {{nowrap|''n''-dimensional}} Euclidean space, the Hausdorff dimension is equal to ''n''.

[[w:Uniform space|Uniform spaces]] do not introduce distances, but still allow one to use uniform continuity, Cauchy sequences (or [[w:Filter (mathematics)#Cauchy filters|filters]] or [[w:Net (mathematics)#Cauchy nets|nets]]), completeness and completion. Every uniform space is also a topological space. Every ''linear'' topological space (metrizable or not) is also a uniform space, and is complete in finite dimension but generally incomplete in infinite dimension. More generally, every commutative topological group is also a uniform space. A non-commutative topological group, however, carries two uniform structures, one left-invariant, the other right-invariant.

===Normed, Banach, inner product, and Hilbert spaces===
[[File:Spaces Hilbert etc.svg|thumb|360px|Relations between mathematical spaces: normed, Banach etc]]

Vectors in a Euclidean space form a linear space, but each vector &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; has also a length, in other words, norm, &lt;math&gt;\lVert x\rVert&lt;/math&gt;. A real or complex linear space endowed with a norm is a [[w:Normed vector space|normed space]]. Every normed space is both a linear topological space and a metric space. A [[w:Banach space|Banach space]] is a complete normed space. Many spaces of sequences or functions are infinite-dimensional Banach spaces.

The set of all vectors of norm less than one is called the unit ball of a normed space. It is a convex, centrally symmetric set, generally not an ellipsoid; for example, it may be a polygon (in the plane) or. more generally, a polytope (in arbitrary finite dimension). The parallelogram law (called also parallelogram identity) 
:&lt;math&gt; \lVert x-y\rVert^2 + \lVert x+y\rVert^2 = 2 \lVert x\rVert^2 + 2 \lVert y \rVert^2\ ,
&lt;/math&gt; 
generally fails in normed spaces, but holds for vectors in Euclidean spaces, which follows from the fact that the squared Euclidean norm of a vector is its inner product with itself, &lt;math&gt; \lVert x\rVert^2 = (x, x)&lt;/math&gt;.

An [[w:Inner product space|inner product space]] is a real or complex linear space, endowed with a bilinear or respectively sesquilinear form, satisfying some conditions and called an inner product. Every inner product space is also a normed space. A normed space underlies an inner product space if and only if it satisfies the parallelogram law, or equivalently, if its unit ball is an ellipsoid. Angles between vectors are defined in inner product spaces. A [[w:Hilbert space|Hilbert space]] is defined as a complete inner product space. (Some authors insist that it must be complex, others admit also real Hilbert spaces.) Many spaces of sequences or functions are infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Hilbert spaces are very important for [[w:Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lanczos|first1=Cornelius|author-link=w:Cornelius Lanczos|date= 1970|title=Space through the Ages: The Evolution of Geometrical Ideas from Pythagoras to Hilbert and Einstein|page=269|publisher=[[w:Academic Press|Academic Press]]|isbn=978-0124358508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All {{nobr|''n''-dimensional}} real inner product spaces are mutually isomorphic. One may say that the {{nobr|''n''-dimensional}} Euclidean space is the {{nobr|''n''-dimensional}} real inner product space that forgot its origin.

===Smooth and Riemannian manifolds ===
[[File:Spaces smooth etc.svg|thumb|330px|Relations between mathematical spaces: smooth, Riemannian etc]]

[[w:Smooth manifold|Smooth manifolds]] are not called "spaces", but could be. Every smooth manifold is a topological manifold, and can be embedded into a finite-dimensional linear space. Smooth surfaces in a finite-dimensional linear space  are smooth manifolds: for example, the surface of an ellipsoid is a smooth manifold, a polytope is not. Real or complex finite-dimensional linear, affine and projective spaces are also smooth manifolds.

At each one of its points, a smooth path in a smooth manifold has a tangent vector that belongs to the manifold's tangent space at this point. Tangent spaces to an {{nobr|''n''-dimensional}} smooth manifold are {{nobr|''n''-dimensional}} linear spaces. The differential of a smooth function on a smooth manifold provides a linear functional on the tangent space at each point. 

A [[w:Riemannian manifold|Riemannian manifold]], or Riemann space, is a smooth manifold whose tangent spaces are endowed with inner products satisfying some conditions. Euclidean spaces are also Riemann spaces. Smooth surfaces in Euclidean spaces are Riemann spaces. A hyperbolic {{nowrap|non-Euclidean}} space is also a Riemann space. A curve in a Riemann space has a length, and the length of the shortest curve between two points defines a distance, such that the Riemann space is a metric space. The angle between two curves intersecting at a point is the angle between their tangent lines.

Waiving positivity of inner products on tangent spaces, one obtains [[w:Pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-Riemann spaces]], including the Lorentzian spaces that are very important for [[w:General relativity|general relativity]].

===Measurable, measure, and probability spaces===
[[File:Spaces measurable etc.svg|thumb|390px|Relations between mathematical spaces: measurable, measure etc]]

Waiving distances and angles while retaining volumes (of geometric bodies) one reaches [[w:measure theory|measure theory]]. Besides the volume, a measure generalizes the notions of area, length, mass (or charge) distribution, and also probability distribution, according to [[w:Andrey Kolmogorov|Andrey Kolmogorov's]] approach to [[w:probability theory|probability theory]].

A "geometric body" of classical mathematics is much more regular than just a set of points. The boundary of the body is of zero volume. Thus, the volume of the body is the volume of its interior, and the interior can be exhausted by an infinite sequence of cubes. In contrast, the boundary of an arbitrary set of points can be of non-zero volume (an example: the set of all rational points inside a given cube). Measure theory succeeded in extending the notion of volume to a vast class of sets, the so-called [[w:Measurable set|measurable sets]]. Indeed, non-measurable sets almost never occur in applications.

Measurable sets, given in a [[w:Measurable space|measurable space]] by definition, lead to measurable functions and maps. In order to turn a topological space into a measurable space one endows it with a [[w:Sigma-algebra|{{nowrap|σ-algebra.}}]] The {{nowrap|σ-algebra}} of [[w:Borel set|Borel sets]] is the most popular, but not the only choice. ([[w:Baire set|Baire sets]], [[w:Universally measurable set|universally measurable sets]], etc, are also used sometimes.) 
The topology is not uniquely determined by the Borel {{nowrap|σ-algebra;}} for example, the [[w:Norm topology|norm topology]] and the [[w:Weak topology|weak topology]] on a [[w:Separable space|separable]] Hilbert space lead to the same Borel {{nowrap|σ-algebra}}.
Not every {{nowrap|σ-algebra}} is the Borel {{nowrap|σ-algebra}} of some topology.&lt;ref group="details"&gt;
The space &lt;math&gt;2^{\mathbb R}&lt;/math&gt; (equipped with its [[w:Product measure|tensor product]] {{nowrap|σ-algebra)}} has a measurable structure which is not generated by a topology. A slick proof can be found in [http://mathoverflow.net/questions/87838/is-every-sigma-algebra-the-borel-algebra-of-a-topology/87888#87888 this answer] on [[w:MathOverflow|''MathOverflow'']].&lt;/ref&gt;
Actually, a {{nowrap|σ-algebra}} can be generated by a given collection of sets (or functions) irrespective of any topology.  Every subset of a measurable space is itself a measurable space.

Standard measurable spaces (also called [[w:Standard Borel space|standard Borel spaces]]) are especially useful due to some similarity to compact spaces (see [https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Standard_Borel_space EoM]). Every bijective measurable mapping between standard measurable spaces is an isomorphism; that is, the inverse mapping is also measurable. And a mapping between such spaces is measurable if and only if its graph is measurable in the product space. Similarly, every bijective continuous mapping between compact metric spaces is a homeomorphism; that is, the inverse mapping is also continuous. And a mapping between such spaces is continuous if and only if its graph is closed in the product space.

Every Borel set in a Euclidean space (and more generally, in a complete separable metric space), endowed with the Borel {{nowrap|σ-algebra,}} is a standard measurable space. All uncountable standard measurable spaces are mutually isomorphic.

A [[w:Measure space|measure space]] is a measurable space endowed with a measure. A Euclidean space with the [[w:Lebesgue measure|Lebesgue measure]] is a measure space. [[w:Lebesgue integration|Integration theory]] defines integrability and integrals of measurable functions on a measure space.

Sets of measure 0, called null sets, are negligible. Accordingly, a "mod&amp;nbsp;0 isomorphism" is defined as isomorphism between subsets of full measure (that is, with negligible complement).

A [[w:Probability space|probability space]] is a measure space such that the measure of the whole space is equal to 1. The product of any family (finite or not) of probability spaces is a probability space. In contrast, for measure spaces in general, only the product of finitely many spaces is defined. Accordingly, there are many infinite-dimensional probability measures (especially, [[w:Gaussian measure|Gaussian measures]]), but no infinite-dimensional Lebesgue measures.

[[w:Standard probability space|Standard probability spaces]] are [[w:Standard probability space#Using the standardness|especially useful]]. On a standard probability space a conditional expectation may be treated as the integral over the conditional measure ([[w:Standard probability space#Regular conditional probabilities|regular conditional probabilities]], see also [[w:Disintegration theorem|disintegration of measure]]). Given two standard probability spaces, every homomorphism of their [https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Measure_algebra_(measure_theory) measure algebras] is induced by some measure preserving map. Every probability measure on a standard measurable space leads to a standard probability space. The product of a sequence (finite or not) of standard probability spaces is a standard probability space. All non-atomic standard probability spaces are mutually isomorphic mod&amp;nbsp;0; one of them is the interval (0,1) with the Lebesgue measure.

These spaces are less geometric. In particular, the idea of dimension, applicable (in one form or another) to all other spaces, does not apply to measurable, measure and probability spaces.

===Non-commutative geometry===

The theoretical study of calculus, known as [[w:Mathematical analysis|mathematical analysis]], led in the early 20th century to the consideration of linear spaces of real-valued or complex-valued functions.  The earliest examples of these were [[w:Function space|function spaces]], each one adapted to its own class of problems.  These examples shared many common features, and these features were soon abstracted into Hilbert spaces, Banach spaces, and more general topological vector spaces.  These were a powerful toolkit for the solution of a wide range of mathematical problems.

The most detailed information was carried by a class of spaces called [[w:Banach algebra|Banach algebras]].  These are Banach spaces together with a continuous multiplication operation.  An important early example was the Banach algebra of essentially bounded measurable functions on a measure space ''X''.  This set of functions is a Banach space under pointwise addition and scalar multiplication.  With the operation of pointwise multiplication, it becomes a special type of Banach space, one now called a commutative [[w:von Neumann algebra|von Neumann algebra]].  Pointwise multiplication determines a representation of this algebra on the Hilbert space of square integrable functions on ''X''.  An early observation of [[w:John von Neumann|John von Neumann]] was that this correspondence also worked in reverse: Given some mild technical hypotheses, a commutative von Neumann algebra together with a representation on a Hilbert space determines a measure space, and these two constructions (of a von Neumann algebra plus a representation and of a measure space) are mutually inverse.

Von Neumann then proposed that non-commutative von Neumann algebras should have geometric meaning, just as commutative von Neumann algebras do.  Together with [[w:Francis Joseph Murray|Francis Murray]], he produced a classification of von Neumann algebras.  The [[w:direct integral|direct integral]] construction shows how to break any von Neumann algebra into a collection of simpler algebras called ''factors''.  Von Neumann and Murray classified factors into three types.  Type I was nearly identical to the commutative case.  Types II and III exhibited new phenomena.  A type II von Neumann algebra determined a geometry with the peculiar feature that the dimension could be any non-negative real number, not just an integer.  Type III algebras were those that were neither types I nor II, and after several decades of effort, these were proven to be closely related to type II factors.

A slightly different approach to the geometry of function spaces developed at the same time as von Neumann and Murray's work on the classification of factors.  This approach is the theory of {{nowrap|[[w:C*-algebra|C*-algebras]].}}  Here, the motivating example is the {{nowrap|C*-algebra}} &lt;math&gt;C_0(X)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''X'' is a locally compact Hausdorff topological space.  By definition, this is the algebra of continuous complex-valued functions on ''X'' that vanish at infinity (which loosely means that the farther you go from a chosen point, the closer the function gets to zero) with the operations of pointwise addition and multiplication.  The [[w:Gelfand–Naimark theorem|Gelfand–Naimark theorem]] implied that there is a correspondence between commutative {{nowrap|C*-algebras}} and geometric objects: Every commutative {{nowrap|C*-algebra}} is of the form &lt;math&gt;C_0(X)&lt;/math&gt; for some locally compact Hausdorff space ''X''.  Consequently it is possible to study locally compact Hausdorff spaces purely in terms of commutative {{nowrap|C*-algebras.}}  Non-commutative geometry takes this as inspiration for the study of non-commutative {{nowrap|C*-algebras:}} If there were such a thing as a "non-commutative space ''X''," then its &lt;math&gt;C_0(X)&lt;/math&gt; would be a non-commutative {{nowrap|C*-algebra}}; if in addition the Gelfand–Naimark theorem applied to these non-existent objects, then spaces (commutative or not) would be the same as {{nowrap|C*-algebras;}} so, for lack of a direct approach to the definition of a non-commutative space, a non-commutative space is ''defined'' to be a non-commutative {{nowrap|C*-algebra.}}  Many standard geometric tools can be restated in terms of {{nowrap|C*-algebras,}} and this gives geometrically-inspired techniques for studying non-commutative {{nowrap|C*-algebras}}.

Both of these examples are now cases of a field called [[w:noncommutative geometry|non-commutative geometry]].  The specific examples of von Neumann algebras and {{nowrap|C*-algebras}} are known as non-commutative measure theory and non-commutative topology, respectively.  Non-commutative geometry is not merely a pursuit of generality for its own sake and is not just a curiosity.  Non-commutative spaces arise naturally, even inevitably, from some constructions.  For example, consider the non-periodic [[w:Penrose tiling|Penrose tilings]] of the plane by kites and darts.  It is a theorem that, in such a tiling, every finite patch of kites and darts appears infinitely often.  As a consequence, there is no way to distinguish two Penrose tilings by looking at a finite portion.  This makes it impossible to assign the set of all tilings a topology in the traditional sense.  Despite this, the Penrose tilings determine a non-commutative {{nowrap|C*-algebra,}} and consequently they can be studied by the techniques of non-commutative geometry.  Another example, and one of great interest within [[w:differential geometry|differential geometry]], comes from [[w:foliation|foliations]] of manifolds.  These are ways of splitting the manifold up into smaller-dimensional submanifolds called ''leaves'', each of which is locally parallel to others nearby.  The set of all leaves can be made into a topological space.  However, the example of an [[w:irrational rotation|irrational rotation]] shows that this topological space can be inacessible to the techniques of classical measure theory.  However, there is a non-commutative von Neumann algebra associated to the leaf space of a foliation, and once again, this gives an otherwise unintelligible space a good geometric structure.

===Schemes===
[[File:Spaces schemes etc.svg|thumb|470px|Relations between mathematical spaces: schemes, stacks etc]]

[[w:Algebraic geometry|Algebraic geometry]] studies the geometric properties of [[w:polynomial|polynomial]] equations.  Polynomials are a type of function defined from the basic arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication.  Because of this, they are closely tied to algebra. Algebraic geometry offers a way to apply geometric techniques to questions of pure algebra, and vice versa.

Prior to the 1940s, algebraic geometry worked exclusively over the complex numbers, and the most fundamental variety was projective space.  The geometry of projective space is closely related to the theory of [[w:Perspective (geometry)|perspective]], and its algebra is described by [[w:homogeneous polynomial|homogeneous polynomials]].  All other varieties were defined as subsets of projective space.  Projective varieties were subsets defined by a set of homogeneous polynomials.  At each point of the projective variety, all the polynomials in the set were required to equal zero.  The complement of the zero set of a linear polynomial is an affine space, and an affine variety was the intersection of a projective variety with an affine space.

[[w:André Weil|André Weil]] saw that geometric reasoning could sometimes be applied in number-theoretic situations where the spaces in question might be discrete or even finite.  In pursuit of this idea, Weil rewrote the foundations of algebraic geometry, both freeing algebraic geometry from its reliance on complex numbers and introducing ''abstract algebraic varieties'' which were not embedded in projective space.  These are now simply called ''varieties''.

The type of space that underlies most modern algebraic geometry is even more general than Weil's abstract algebraic varieties.  It was introduced by [[w:Alexander Grothendieck|Alexander Grothendieck]] and is called a [[w:scheme (mathematics)|scheme]].  One of the motivations for scheme theory is that polynomials are unusually structured among functions, and algebraic varieties are consequently rigid.  This presents problems when attempting to study degenerate situations.  For example, almost any pair of points on a circle determines a unique line called the secant line, and as the two points move around the circle, the secant line varies continuously.  However, when the two points collide, the secant line degenerates to a tangent line.  The tangent line is unique, but the geometry of this configuration—a single point on a circle—is not expressive enough to determine a unique line.  Studying situations like this requires a theory capable of assigning extra data to degenerate situations.

One of the building blocks of a scheme is a topological space.  Topological spaces have continuous functions, but continuous functions are too general to reflect the underlying algebraic structure of interest. The other ingredient in a scheme, therefore, is a [[w:sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] on the topological space, called the "structure sheaf".  On each open subset of the topological space, the sheaf specifies a collection of functions, called "regular functions".  The topological space and the structure sheaf together are required to satisfy conditions that mean the functions come from algebraic operations.

Like manifolds, schemes are defined as spaces that are locally modeled on a familiar space.  In the case of manifolds, the familiar space is Euclidean space.  For a scheme, the local models are called [[w:affine scheme|affine schemes]].  Affine schemes provide a direct link between algebraic geometry and [[w:commutative algebra|commutative algebra]].  The fundamental objects of study in commutative algebra are [[w:commutative ring|commutative rings]].  If &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a commutative ring, then there is a corresponding affine scheme &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec} R&lt;/math&gt; which translates the algebraic structure of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; into geometry.  Conversely, every affine scheme determines a commutative ring, namely, the ring of global sections of its structure sheaf.  These two operations are mutually inverse, so affine schemes provide a new language with which to study questions in commutative algebra.  By definition, every point in a scheme has an open neighborhood which is an affine scheme.

There are many schemes that are not affine.  In particular,  projective spaces satisfy a condition called [[w:proper morphism|properness]] which is analogous to compactness.  Affine schemes cannot be proper (except in trivial situations like when the scheme has only a single point), and hence no projective space is an affine scheme (except for zero-dimensional projective spaces).  Projective schemes, meaning those that arise as closed subschemes of a projective space, are the single most important family of schemes.{{sfn|Eisenbud|Harris|2000}}

Several generalizations of schemes have been introduced.  [[w:Michael Artin|Michael Artin]] defined an [[w:algebraic space|algebraic space]] as the quotient of a scheme by the [[w:equivalence relation|equivalence relations]] that define [[w:étale morphism|étale morphisms]].  Algebraic spaces retain many of the useful properties of schemes while simultaneously being more flexible.  For instance, the [[w:Keel–Mori theorem|Keel–Mori theorem]] can be used to show that many [[w:moduli space|moduli spaces]] are algebraic spaces.

More general than an algebraic space is a [[w:Deligne–Mumford stack|Deligne–Mumford stack]].  DM stacks are similar to schemes, but they permit singularities that cannot be described solely in terms of polynomials.  They play the same role for schemes that [[w:orbifold|orbifolds]] do for [[w:manifold|manifolds]].  For example, the quotient of the affine plane by a finite [[group (mathematics)|group]] of rotations around the origin yields a Deligne–Mumford stack that is not a scheme or an algebraic space.  Away from the origin, the quotient by the group action identifies finite sets of equally spaced points on a circle.  But at the origin, the circle consists of only a single point, the origin itself, and the group action fixes this point.  In the quotient DM stack, however, this point comes with the extra data of being a quotient.  This kind of refined structure is useful in the theory of moduli spaces, and in fact, it was originally introduced to describe [[w:moduli of algebraic curves|moduli of algebraic curves]].

A further generalization are the [[w:algebraic stack|algebraic stacks]], also called Artin stacks.  DM stacks are limited to quotients by finite group actions.  While this suffices for many problems in moduli theory, it is too restrictive for others, and Artin stacks permit more general quotients.

===Topoi===
[[File:Spaces topoi etc.svg|thumb|480px|Relations between mathematical spaces: locales, topoi etc]]

In Grothendieck's work on the [[w:Weil conjectures|Weil conjectures]], he introduced a new type of topology now called a [[w:Grothendieck topology|Grothendieck topology]].  A topological space (in the ordinary sense) axiomatizes the notion of "nearness," making two points be nearby if and only if they lie in many of the same open sets.  By contrast, a Grothendieck topology axiomatizes the notion of "covering".  A covering of a space is a collection of subspaces that jointly contain all the information of the ambient space.  Since sheaves are defined in terms of coverings, a Grothendieck topology can also be seen as an axiomatization of the theory of sheaves.

Grothendieck's work on his topologies led him to the theory of [[w:topos (mathematics)|topoi]].  In his memoir ''Récoltes et Semailles'', he called them his "most vast conception".&lt;ref&gt;"Si le thème des schémas est comme le coeur de la géométrie nouvelle, le thème du topos en est l’enveloppe, ou la demeure. Il est ce que j’ai conçu de plus vaste, pour saisir avec finesse, par un même langage riche en résonances géométriques, une "essence" commune à des situations des plus éloignées les unes des autres, provenant de telle région ou de telle autre du vaste univers des choses mathématiques." ''Récoltes et Semailles'', page P43.&lt;/ref&gt; A sheaf (either on a topological space or with respect to a Grothendieck topology) is used to express local data.  The [[w:category (mathematics)|category]] of all sheaves carries all possible ways of expressing local data.  Since topological spaces are constructed from points, which are themselves a kind of local data, the category of sheaves can therefore be used as a replacement for the original space.  Grothendieck consequently defined a topos to be a category of sheaves and studied topoi as objects of interest in their own right.  These are now called [[w:Grothendieck topos|Grothendieck topoi]].

Every topological space determines a topos, and vice versa.  There are topological spaces where taking the associated topos loses information, but these are generally considered pathological.  (A necessary and sufficient condition is that the topological space be a [[w:sober space|sober space]].)  Conversely, there are topoi whose associated topological spaces do not capture the original topos.  But, far from being pathological, these topoi can be of great mathematical interest.  For instance, Grothendieck's theory of [[w:étale cohomology|étale cohomology]] (which eventually led to the proof of the Weil conjectures) can be phrased as cohomology in the étale topos of a scheme, and this topos does not come from a topological space.

Topological spaces in fact lead to very special topoi called [[w:locale (mathematics)|locales]].  The set of open subsets of a topological space determines a [[w:lattice (order)|lattice]].  The axioms for a topological space cause these lattices to be [[w:complete Heyting algebra|complete Heyting algebras]].  The theory of locales takes this as its starting point.  A locale is defined to be a complete Heyting algebra, and the elementary properties of topological spaces are re-expressed and reproved in these terms.  The concept of a locale turns out to be more general than a topological space, in that every sober topological space determines a unique locale, but many interesting locales do not come from topological spaces.  Because locales need not have points, the study of locales is somewhat jokingly called [[w:pointless topology|pointless topology]].

Topoi also display deep connections to mathematical logic.  Every Grothendieck topos has a special sheaf called a subobject classifier.  This subobject classifier functions like the set of all possible truth values.  In the topos of sets, the subobject classifier is the set &lt;math&gt;\{0, 1\}&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to "False" and "True".  But in other topoi, the subobject classifier can be much more complicated.  [[w:William Lawvere|Lawvere]] and [[w:Myles Tierney|Tierney]] recognized that axiomatizing the subobject classifier yielded a more general kind of topos, now known as an [[w:elementary topos|elementary topos]], and that elementary topoi were models of [[w:intuitionistic logic|intuitionistic logic]].  In addition to providing a powerful way to apply tools from logic to geometry, this made possible the use of geometric methods in logic.

==Spaces and structures==

According to Kevin Carlson,
:Neither of these words ["space" and "structure"] have a single mathematical definition. The English words can be used in essentially all the same situations, but you often think of a "space" as more geometric and a "structure" as more algebraic. [...] So you could think of "structures" as places we do algebra, and "spaces" as places we do geometry. Then a lot of great mathematics has come from passing from structures to spaces and vice versa, as when we look at the [[w:Fundamental group|fundamental group]] of a topological space or the [[w:Spectrum of a ring|spectrum of a ring]]. But in the end, the distinction is neither hard nor fast and only goes so far: many things are obviously both structures and spaces, some things are not obviously either, and some people might well disagree with everything I've said here.&lt;ref name="carlson" /&gt;

Nevertheless, a general definition of "structure" was proposed by Bourbaki&lt;ref name="BS" /&gt;; it embraces all [[#Types_of_spaces|types of spaces]] mentioned above, (nearly?) all types of mathematical structures used till now, and more. It provides a general definition of isomorphism, and justifies transfer of properties between isomorphic structures. However, it was never used actively in mathematical practice (not even in the mathematical treatises written by Bourbaki himself). Here are the last phrases from a review by Robert Reed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reed|first1=Robert C.|url=https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.rml/1081878080 |title=Leo Corry, ''Modern Algebra and the Rise of Mathematical Structures''|department=Review|journal=Modern Logic|date=2000|volume=8|issue=1–2|pages=182–190}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a book by Leo Corry:
:Corry does not seem to feel that ''any'' formal definition of structure could do justice to the use of the concept in actual mathematical practice [...] Corry's view could be summarized as the belief that 'structure' refers essentially to a way of ''doing'' mathematics, and is therefore a concept probably just as far from being precisely definable as the cultural artifact of mathematics itself.

For more information on mathematical structures see Wikipedia: [[w:Mathematical structure|mathematical structure]], [[w:Equivalent definitions of mathematical structures|equivalent definitions of mathematical structures]], and [[w:Transport of structure|transport of structure]].

The distinction between geometric "spaces" and algebraic "structures" is sometimes clear, sometimes elusive. Clearly, [[w:Group (mathematics)|groups]] are algebraic, while [[w:Euclidean space|Euclidean spaces]] are geometric. [[w:Module (mathematics)|Modules]] over [[w:Ring (mathematics)|rings]] are as algebraic as groups. In particular, when the [[w:Field (mathematics)#Constructing fields from rings|ring appears to be a field]], the [[w:Vector space#Modules|module appears to be a linear space]]; is it algebraic or geometric? In particular, when it is finite-dimensional, over real numbers, and [[w:Inner product space|endowed with inner product]], it [[w:Euclidean space#Euclidean structure|becomes Euclidean space]]; now geometric. The (algebraic?) [[w:Field (mathematics)#Real and complex numbers|field of real numbers]] is the same as the (geometric?) [[w:real line|real line]]. Its [[w:Algebraic closure#Examples|algebraic closure]], the (algebraic?) [[w:Field (mathematics)#Real and complex numbers|field of complex numbers]], is the same as the (geometric?) [[w:Complex plane|complex plane]]. It is first of all "a place we do [[w:Complex analysis|analysis]]" (rather than algebra or geometry).

Every space treated in Section "[[#Types_of_spaces|Types of spaces]]" above, except for "Non-commutative geometry", "Schemes" and "Topoi" subsections, is a set (the "principal base set" of the structure, according to Bourbaki) endowed with some additional structure; elements of the base set are usually called "points" of this space. In contrast, elements of (the base set of) an algebraic structure usually are not called "points".

However, sometimes one uses more than one principal base set. For example, two-dimensional projective geometry may be [[w:Projective geometry#Whitehead's axioms|formalized via two base sets]], the set of points and the set of lines. Moreover, [[w:Duality (projective geometry)|a striking feature of projective planes is the symmetry of the roles played by points and lines]]. A less geometric example: a graph may be [[w:Graph (discrete mathematics)#Graph|formalized via two base sets]], the set of vertices (called also nodes or points) and the set of edges (called also arcs or lines). Generally, [[w:Equivalent definitions of mathematical structures#Transport of structures; isomorphism|finitely many principal base sets and finitely many auxiliary base sets]] are stipulated by Bourbaki.

Many mathematical structures of geometric flavor treated in the "Non-commutative geometry", "Schemes" and "Topoi" subsections above do not stipulate a base set of points. For example, "[[w:Pointless topology|pointless topology]]" (in other words, point-free topology, or locale theory) starts with a single base set whose elements imitate open sets in a topological space (but are not sets of points); see also [[w:Mereotopology|mereotopology]] and [[w:Whitehead's point-free geometry|point-free geometry]].

[[File:Medieval tally sticks.jpg|thumb|320px|right|Medieval English split tally stick ([[Obverse and reverse|front and reverse]] view). The stick is notched and inscribed to record a debt owed to the [[rural dean]] of [[Preston Candover]], Hampshire, of a [[tithe]] of 20[[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|d]] each on 32 sheep, amounting to a total sum of £2 13s. 4d.]]
A '''tally stick''' (or simply '''tally'''&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|tally}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an ancient memory aid device used to record and document numbers, quantities, or even messages. Tally sticks first appear as animal bones carved with notches during the [[Upper Paleolithic]]; a notable example is the [[Ishango Bone]]. Historical reference is made by [[Pliny the Elder]] (AD 23–79) about the best wood to use for tallies, and by [[Marco Polo]] (1254–1324) who mentions the use of the tally in China. Tallies have been used for numerous purposes such as messaging and scheduling, and especially in financial and legal transactions, {{citation needed span|text=to the point of being [[currency]].|date=January 2018}}

==Kinds of tallies==
[[File:SAM PC 1 - Tally sticks 1 - Overview.jpg|thumb|Single and split tallies from the [[Swiss Alps]], 18th to early 20th century ([[Swiss Alpine Museum]])]]
Principally, there are two different kinds of tally sticks: the single tally and the split tally. A common form of the same kind of primitive counting device is seen in various kinds of [[prayer beads]].

===Paleolithic tally sticks===
A number of anthropological artefacts have been conjectured to be tally sticks:

*the [[Ishango bone]] is a [[bone tool]], dated to the [[Upper Paleolithic]] era, around 18,000 to 20,000&amp;nbsp;BC. It is a dark brown length of bone, the [[fibula]] of a baboon. It has a series of [[tally mark]]s carved in three columns running the length of the tool. It was found in 1960 in Belgian Congo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maths.uwa.edu.au/~schultz/3M3/history.html A very brief history of pure mathematics: The Ishango Bone] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721075947/http://www.maths.uwa.edu.au/%7Eschultz/3M3/history.html |date=21 July 2008 }} University of Western Australia School of Mathematics – accessed January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''[[Lebombo Bone]]'' is a [[baboon]]'s [[fibula]] with 29 distinct notches, discovered within the [[Border Cave]] in the [[Lebombo Mountains]] of [[Swaziland]]. 
*The so-called ''Wolf bone'' &lt;small&gt;([[:cs:Vlčí radius|cs]])&lt;/small&gt; is a prehistoric artefact discovered in 1937 in [[Czechoslovakia]] during excavations at [[Dolní Věstonice (archaeology)|Vestonice]], [[Moravia]], led by [[Karel Absolon|Karl Absolon]]. Dated to the [[Aurignacian]], approximately 30,000 years ago, the bone is marked with 55 marks which some believe to be [[tally mark]]s. The head of an ivory [[Venus figurine]] was excavated close to the bone.&lt;ref&gt;*Graham Flegg, ''Numbers: their history and meaning'', Courier Dover Publications, 2002 {{ISBN|978-0-486-42165-0}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beckmann|first1=Petr|title=A History of {{pi}} (PI)|date=1971|publisher=The Golem Press|location=Boulder, Colorado|isbn=978-0-911762-12-9|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Single tally===
The single tally stick was an elongated piece of bone, ivory, wood, or stone which is marked with a system of notches (see: [[Tally marks]]). The single tally stick serves predominantly [[mnemonic]] purposes. Related to the single tally concept are messenger sticks (e.g., Inuit tribes), the knotted cords, ''[[khipu]]s'' or ''quipus'', as used by the [[Inca]]. [[Herodotus]] (c. 485–425 BC) reported  the use of a knotted cord by [[Darius I of Persia]] (c. 521–486 BC).

===Split tally===
The split tally was a technique which became common in medieval Europe, which was constantly short of money (coins) and predominantly illiterate, in order to record bilateral exchange and debts. A stick (squared hazelwood sticks were most common) was marked with a system of notches and then split lengthwise. This way the two halves both record the same notches and each party to the transaction received one half of the marked stick as proof. Later this technique was refined in various ways and became virtually tamper proof. One of the refinements was to make the two halves of the stick of different lengths. The longer part was called ''stock'' and was given to the party which had advanced money (or other items) to the receiver. The shorter portion of the stick was called ''foil'' and was given to the party which had received the funds or goods. Using this technique each of the parties had an identifiable record of the transaction. The natural irregularities in the surfaces of the tallies where they were split would mean that only the original two halves would fit back together perfectly, and so would verify that they were matching halves of the same transaction. If one party tried to unilaterally change the value of his half of the tally stick by adding more notches, the absence of those notches would be apparent on the other party's tally stick. The split tally was accepted as legal proof in medieval courts and the [[Napoleonic Code]] (1804) still makes reference to the tally stick in Article 1333.&lt;ref&gt;

Retrieved 13 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Along the [[Danube]] and in [[Switzerland]] the tally was still used in the 20th century in rural economies.

====Split tally in England====
[[File:TNA gates.JPG|thumb|Entrance gates to the UK [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]], [[Kew]], from Ruskin Avenue. The notched vertical elements were inspired by medieval tally sticks.]]
The most prominent and best recorded use of the split tally stick or "nick-stick"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|year=2003|edition=3|chapter=nick-stick|title-link=Oxford English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shenton|first=Caroline|title=The Day Parliament Burned Down|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780199646708|chapter=Chapter 1: Thursday 16 October 1834, 6am: Mr Hume's Motion for a New House}}&lt;/ref&gt; being used as a form of currency&lt;ref name="BBC_Radio_50_Things"&gt;{{cite web|title=50 Things That Made the Modern Economy|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p053g7qj|website=BBC Radio|publisher=BBC|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was when [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] introduced the tally stick system in medieval England in around 1100. He would accept the tally stick only for taxes, and it was a tool of the [[Exchequer]] for the collection of taxes by local sheriffs (tax farmers "farming the shire"){{citation needed|date=March 2018}} for seven centuries. The split tally of the Exchequer was in continuous use until 1826. In 1834 tally sticks representing six centuries worth of financial records were ordered to be burned in a stove in the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]]. The resulting fire set the chimney ablaze and then spread until [[Burning of Parliament|most of the building was destroyed]].&lt;ref name="BBC_Radio_50_Things" /&gt; This event was described by [[Charles Dickens]] in an 1855 article on administrative reform.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Dickens, "Administrative Reform" (June 27, 1855) Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=bT5WAAAAcAAJ Speeches literary and social by Charles Dickens]'' (1870) pp.133–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The system of tally marks of the Exchequer is described in ''[[Dialogue concerning the exchequer|The Dialogue Concerning the Exchequer]]'' (see external links below) as follows:
{{quote|The manner of cutting is as follows. At the top of the tally a cut is made, the thickness of the palm of the hand, to represent a thousand pounds; then a hundred pounds by a cut the breadth of a thumb; twenty pounds, the breadth of the little finger; a single pound, the width of a swollen barleycorn; a shilling rather narrower; then a penny is marked by a single cut without removing any wood.|}}
The cuts were made the full width of the stick so that, after splitting, the portion kept by the issuer (the ''stock'') exactly matched the piece (the ''foil'') given as a receipt. Each stick had to have the details of the transaction written on it, in ink, to make it a valid record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clanchy|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Clanchy|title=From Memory to Written Record|year=1979|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford, England|isbn=9780631168577|page=125|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Royal tallies (debt of the Crown) also played a role in the formation of the [[Bank of England]] at the end of the 17th century. In 1697, the bank issued £1 million worth of stock in exchange for £800,000 worth of tallies at par and £200,000 in bank notes. This new stock was said to be "engrafted". The government promised not only to pay the Bank interest on the tallies subscribed but to redeem them over a period of years. The "engrafted" stock was then cancelled simultaneously with the redemption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carswell|first1=John|title=The South Sea Bubble|date=1993|publisher=Alan Sutton Publishing Ltd|location=England|isbn=978-0-86299-918-6|page=24|edition=Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tally sticks feature in the design of the entrance gates to [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] at [[Kew]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3581">A '''tetradic''' '''number''', also known as a '''four-way''' '''number''', is a number that remains the same when flipped back to front, flipped front to back, mirrored up-down, or flipped up-down. The only numbers that remain the same which turned up-side-down or mirrored are 0, 1, and 8, so a tetradic number is a [[palindromic number]] containing only 0, 1, and 8 as digits. The first few tetradic numbers are 1, 8, 11, 88, 101, 111, 181, 808, 818, ... ([[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|OEIS]] A006072).&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, N. J. A. Sequences [[oeis:A006072|A006072]]/M4481 in "The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=CRC Concise Encyclopedia of Mathematics|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W.|publisher=CRC Press|year=2002|isbn=978-1420035223|edition=2nd|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TetradicNumber.html|title=Tetradic Number|last=|first=|date=|website=Wolfram MathWorld|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://everything2.com/title/tetradic+number|title=tetradic number|last=|first=|date=January 5, 2002|website=Everthing2|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tetradic numbers are also known as four-way numbers due to the fact that they have four-way [[Symmetry in mathematics|symmetry]] and can flipped back to front, flipped front to back, mirrored up-down, or flipped up-down and always stay the same. The four-way symmetry explains the name, due to [[Numeral prefix|tetra-]] being the Greek prefix for four. Tetradic numbers are both [[Strobogrammatic number|strobogrammatic]] and [[Palindromic number|palindromic]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

If you have a tetradic number, a larger one can always be generated by adding another tetradic number to each end, retaining the symmetry.

== Tetradic primes ==
Tetradic primes are a specific type of tetradic number defined as tetradic numbers that are also [[Prime number|prime numbers]]. The first few tetradic primes are 11, 101, 181, 18181, 1008001, 1180811, 1880881, 1881881, ... ([[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|OEIS]] A068188).&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, N. J. A.

The largest known tetradic prime {{as of|2010|April|lc=on}} is 

: &lt;math&gt;10^{180054} + 8 R_{58567} \cdot 10^{60744} + 1,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R_n&lt;/math&gt; is a [[repunit]]. The prime has 180,055 decimal digits.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2258">A '''traffic model''' is a [[mathematical model]] of real-world [[traffic]], usually, but not restricted to, [[road traffic]]. Traffic modeling draws heavily on theoretical foundations like [[network theory]] and certain theories from physics like the [[kinematic wave]] model. The interesting quantity being modeled and measured is the [[traffic flow]], i.e. the throughput of mobile units (e.g. [[vehicle]]s) per time and transportation medium capacity (e.g. road or lane width). Models can teach researchers and engineers how to ensure an optimal flow with a minimum number of [[traffic jam]]s.

Traffic models often are the basis of a [[traffic simulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mahmud|first1=Khizir|last2=Town|first2=Graham E.|title=A review of computer tools for modeling electric vehicle energy requirements and their impact on power distribution networks|journal=Applied Energy|date=June 2016|volume=172|pages=337–359|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.03.100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
;[[Microscopic traffic flow model]]: Traffic flow is assumed to depend on individual mobile units, i.e. cars, which are explicitly modeled
;[[Macroscopic traffic flow model]]: Only the [[mass action (sociology)|mass action]] or the [[statistical]] properties of a large number of units is analyzed

The '''traveling tournament problem (TTP)''' is an [[mathematical optimization]] problem. The question involves scheduling a series of [[sports team|teams]] such that:
#Each team [[Round-robin tournament|plays every other team]] twice, once at [[home team|home]] and once in the other's stadium.
#No team plays the same opponent in two consecutive weeks.
#No team plays more than three games in a row at home, or three games in a row [[visiting team|on the road]].

A [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] is provided of the travel distances between each team's home city. All teams start and end at their own home city, and the goal is to minimize the total travel distance for every team over the course of the whole [[Season (sports)|season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mat.gsia.cmu.edu/TOURN/ttp_ipcp.pdf|title=Solving the Traveling Tournament Problem|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many papers published on the subject, and a contest exists to find the best solutions for certain specific schedules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mat.gsia.cmu.edu/TOURN/|title=Challenge Traveling Tournament Problems|website=mat.gsia.cmu.edu|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>The previous theorem was wrong as stated, either the interval needs to be [0,1] or the 1/n needed to be scaled. Current version is at least correct, whole article needs cleanup though.</comment>

[[File:Chord graph.png|thumb| A chord (in red) of length 0.3 on a sinusoidal function. The universal chord
theorem guarantees the existence of chords of length 1/''n'' for functions satisfying certain conditions.]]

In [[mathematical analysis]], the '''universal chord theorem''' states that if a function ''f'' is continuous on [''a'',''b''] and satisfies &lt;math&gt; f(a) = f(b) &lt;/math&gt;, then for every [[natural number]] &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, there exists some &lt;math&gt; x \in [a,b] &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; f(x) = f\left(x + \frac{b-a}{n}\right) &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum, J. T. (May, 1971) ''The American Mathematical Monthly'', Vol. 78, No. 5, pp. 509–513&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The theorem was published by [[Paul Lévy (mathematician)|Paul Lévy]] in 1934 as a generalization of [[Rolle's Theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Lévy (mathematician)|Paul Levy]], "Sur une Généralisation du Théorème de Rolle", C. R. Acad. Sci., Paris, 198 (1934) 424–425.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement of the theorem==
Let &lt;math&gt; H(f) = \{ h \in [0, 1] : f(x) = f(x+h) \text{ for some } x \} &lt;/math&gt; denote the '''chord set''' of the function ''f''. If ''f'' is a continuous function and &lt;math&gt; h \in H(f) &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; \frac h n \in H(f)&lt;/math&gt;
for all natural numbers ''n''.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oxtoby|first1=J.C.|title=Horizontal Chord Theorems|journal=The American Mathematical Monthly|date=May 1978|volume=79|pages=468–475|doi=10.2307/2317564}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case of ''n'' = 2==
The case when ''n'' = 2 can be considered an application of the [[Borsuk–Ulam theorem]] to the real line. It says that if &lt;math&gt; f(x) &lt;/math&gt; is continuous on some
interval &lt;math&gt; I = [a,b] &lt;/math&gt; with the condition that &lt;math&gt; f(a) = f(b) &lt;/math&gt;, then there exists some &lt;math&gt; x \in [a,b] &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; f\left(x + \frac{b-a}{2}\right) &lt;/math&gt;. 

In less generality, if &lt;math&gt;  f : [0,1] \rightarrow \R &lt;/math&gt; is [[Continuous function|continuous]] and &lt;math&gt; f(0) = f(1) &lt;/math&gt;, then there exists &lt;math&gt; x \in \left[0,\frac{1}{2}\right]&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies &lt;math&gt; f(x) = f(x+1/2) &lt;/math&gt;.
