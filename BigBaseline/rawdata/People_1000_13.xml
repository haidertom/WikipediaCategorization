'''Africanization''' or '''Africanisation''' (lit., making something African) has been applied in various contexts, notably in geographic and personal naming and in the composition of the civil service e.g. via processes such as [[indigenization]].&lt;ref&gt;African Successes Four Public Managers of Kenyan Rural Development David K. Leonard UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PRESS&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africanization of names==

Africanization has referred to the modification of place names and personal names to reflect an "African" identity. In some cases, changes are not a change of transliteration rather than of the European name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Language in Africa: An Introductory Survey|author=Edgar A. Gregersen|year= 1977|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0-677-04380-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases during the colonial period, African place names were [[Anglicisation|Anglicized]] or [[Francization|Francized]].

===Place names===

====Country names====
Various African countries have undergone name changes during the previous century as the result of consolidations and [[secession]]s, territories gaining [[sovereignty]], and [[regime change]]s.

==Africanization of civil services==

In some countries immediately following their independence, "Africanization" was the name given to [[racial]] policies, [[affirmative action]] intended to increase the number of Africans in [[civil service]] (which had historically been dominated by whites&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ffkFRTj1WIwC&amp;pg=PA406&amp;lpg=PA406&amp;dq=Africanization+of+civil+service&amp;source=web&amp;ots=988fWraWRf&amp;sig=gMOO4OWQKqoqnhUwqSOjMnRiK2o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result Adedeji, Adebayo.

==Localization in African languages==

The term Africanization, abbreviated as the [[numeronym]] "A12n," has been applied to discussion of [[internationalization and localization]] of software and content in [[African languages]].

In [[Greek mythology]], the '''Amazons''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀμαζόνες}}, ''{{transl|grc|Amazónes}}'', singular {{lang|grc|Ἀμαζών}}, ''{{transl|grc|Amazōn}}'') were a tribe of women warriors related to [[Scythians]] and [[Sarmatians]]. [[Apollonius Rhodius]], at [[Argonautica]], mentions that Amazons were the daughters of [[Ares]] and [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]] (a nymph of the Akmonian Wood). They were brutal and aggressive, and their main concern in life was war.&lt;ref name="theoi.com"&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/AresFamily.html Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica, Book 2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2"&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/cla/argo/argo23.htm ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herodotus]] and [[Strabo]] place them on the banks of the [[Thermodon]],&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hh/hh4110.htm Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/rca/rca02.htm THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND]&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Diodorus]] giving the account of Dionysius of Mitylene, who, on his part, drew on Thymoetas, states that before the Amazons of the Thermodon there were, much earlier in time, the Amazons of Libya.&lt;ref name="penelope.uchicago.edu"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3D*.html The Library of History of Diodorus Siculus, Book III, 52]&lt;/ref&gt; These Amazons started from [[Ancient Libya|Libya]], passed through Egypt and Syria, and stopped at the [[Caïcus]] in [[Aeolis]], near which they founded several cities. Later, he says, they established [[Mytilene]] a little way beyond the Caïcus.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; [[Aeschylus]], in [[Prometheus Bound]], places the original home of the Amazons in the country about [[Lake Maeotis]] and they later moved to [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]] on the Thermodon.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND"&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Text/AeschylusPrometheus.html AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homer]] tells that the Amazons were sought and found somewhere near [[Lycia]].&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;

Notable queens of the Amazons are [[Penthesilea]], who participated in the [[Trojan War]], and her sister [[Hippolyta]], whose magical girdle, given to her by her father [[Ares]], was the object of one of the [[labours of Heracles]]. [[Diodorus]] mentions that the Amazons traveled from Libya under Queen [[Myrina (mythology)|Myrina]].&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; Amazon warriors were often depicted in battle with Greek warriors in [[amazonomachy|amazonomachies]] in classical art.

Archaeological discoveries of burial sites with female warriors on the Eurasian steppes suggest that the [[Scythian]] women may have inspired the myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simon|first1=Worrall|title=Amazon Warriors Did Indeed Fight and Die Like Men|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/10/141029-amazons-scythians-hunger-games-herodotus-ice-princess-tattoo-cannabis/|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foreman|first1=Amanda|title=The Amazon Women: Is There Any Truth Behind the Myth?|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/amazon-women-there-any-truth-behind-myth-180950188/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[early modern period]], their name has become a term for female warriors in general. Amazons were said to have founded the cities and temples of Smyrna, Sinope, Cyme, Gryne, Ephesus, Pitania, Magnesia, Clete, Pygela, Latoreria and Amastris; according to legend, the Amazons also invented the [[cavalry]].&lt;ref name="Wonder Woman"&gt;{{Cite book| last1=Steinem | first1=Gloria| last2=Chesler| first2=Phyllis | last3=Feitler | first3=Bea | title= Wonder Woman | publisher= Hole, Rinehart and Winston and Warner Books | date=1972 | isbn = 0-03-005376-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Palaephatus]], who was trying to rationalize the Greek myths in his work ''On Unbelievable Tales'' or ''On Incredible Tales'' ({{lang-grc|Περὶ ἀπίστων ἱστοριῶν}}), stated that the Amazons most probably were men mistaken for women by their enemies because they wore clothing which reached their feet, tied up their hair in headbands and shaved their beards, and also, since they did not exist during his time, most probably they did nοt exist in the past either.&lt;ref&gt;Palaephatus On Unbelievable Tales&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=t4EfiGQwgh4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false On Unbelievable Tales, p. 64]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=a-NmaO-kM2UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Classical Mythology: A Guide to the Mythical World of the Greeks and Romans, p. 9]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The origin of the word is uncertain. It may be derived from an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[ethnonym]] ''*ha-mazan-'' "warriors", a word attested indirectly through a derivation, a denominal verb in [[Hesychius of Alexandria]]'s gloss {{lang|grc|"ἁμαζακάραν· πολεμεῖν. Πέρσαι"}} ("''{{transl|grc|hamazakaran}}'': 'to make war' in Persian"), where it appears together with the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] root ''*kar-'' "make" (from which [[Sanskrit]] ''[[karma]]'' is also derived).&lt;ref&gt;Lagercrantz, ''Xenia Lidéniana'' (1912), 270ff., cited after [[Hjalmar Frisk]], ''Greek Etymological Dictionary'' (1960–1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

It may also be derived from ''{{PIE|*ṇ-mṇ-gw-jon-es}}'' "manless, without husbands" ([[privative a|''a-'' privative]] and a derivation of ''[[Man (word)|*man-]]'' also found in Slavic ''muzh'') has been proposed, an explanation deemed "unlikely" by [[Hjalmar Frisk]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsohn, [[Kuhns Zeitschrift|KZ]] 54, 278ff., cited after [[Hjalmar Frisk]] (1960–1970).&lt;/ref&gt; 19th-century scholarship also connected the term to the ethnonym [[Amazigh]].&lt;ref&gt;Guy Cadogan Rothery, ''The Amazons'' (1910), [http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/ama/ama08.htm ch. 7]: "There have been some authors who trace the word Amazon from this term."&lt;/ref&gt; A further explanation proposes Iranian *''ama-janah'' "virility-killing" as source.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hinge|2005|pp=94–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=The Hittite researcher Friedrich Cornelius assumes that there had been the land Azzi with the capital Chajasa in the area of the Thermodon-Iris Delta on the coast of the Black Sea. He brings its residents in direct relation to the Amazons, namely based on its name (woman of the land Azzi = 'Am'+ 'Azzi' = Amazon) and its customs (matriarchal custom of promiscuous sexual intercourse, even with blood relatives). The location of that land as well as his conclusions are controversial.|author=Gerhard Pollauer&lt;ref name="GP107"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pollauer |first1=Gerhard |title=The Lost History of the Amazons: Recent research findings on the legendary women nation |date=2010 |publisher=Lulu.com |isbn=978-1-4461-9305-1 |page=107 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Z8TAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=isbn%3A9781446193051&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q=intercourse&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Among Classical Greeks, ''amazon'' was given a [[False etymology|folk etymology]] as originating from ''{{transl|grc|a-}}'' ({{lang|grc|ἀ-}}) and ''{{transl|grc|mazos}}'' ({{lang|grc|μαζός}}), "without [[breast]]", connected with an [[etiology|etiological]] tradition once claimed by [[Justin (historian)|Marcus Justinus]] who alleged that Amazons had their right [[mastectomy|breast cut off]] or [[breast ironing|burnt out]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Justin (historian)|Justinus']] "Historiae Phillippicae ex Trogo Pompeio", Liber II, 4: "Virgines (...) armis, equis, venationibus exercebant, inustis infantum dexterioribus mammis, ne sagittarum iactus impediantur; unde dictae Amazones." "They exercised the virgins on weapon-wielding, horse-riding and hunting, and burned the children's right breasts, so that arrow-throwing wouldn't be impeded; and for such reason, they were called Amazons."&lt;/ref&gt; There is no indication of such a practice in ancient works of art,&lt;ref name=Mayor&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-amazons-lives--legends-of-warrior-women-across-the-ancient-world-by-adrienne-mayor-book-review-9799090.html|title=The Amazons: Lives &amp; Legends of Warrior Women Across the Ancient World by Adrienne Mayor, book review|last=Haynes|first=Natalie|date=16 October 2014|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Amazons are always represented with both breasts, although one is frequently covered.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Amazons|volume=1|pages=790–791}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayor"/&gt; Adrienne Mayor suggests the origin of this myth was due to the word's etymology.&lt;ref name=Mayor/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Adrienne Mayor, Start the Week, Radio Four|date= 6 April 2015|time= 21:30 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05plghp|publisher=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greeks also used some [[epithet|descriptive phrases]] for them. Herodotus used the ''Androktones'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδροκτόνες}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀνδροκτόνα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Androktona}}'') ("killers of men")&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt; and ''Androleteirai'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδρολέτειραι}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀνδρολέτειρα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Androleteira}}'') ("destroyers of men, murderesses"),&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; in the [[Iliad]] they are also called ''Antianeirai'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀντιάνειραι}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀντιάνειρα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Antianeira}}'') ("against men") and Aeschylus, in his work ''Prometheus Bound'', used ''styganor'' ({{lang|grc|στυγάνωρ}}) ("those who loathe all men").&lt;ref name="AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND"/&gt;&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0009%3Acard%3D696 Aeschylus, Prometheus Bound]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Amazon Anıtı (2).jpg|thumb|upleft|Amazons monument in [[Samsun]], [[Turkey]].]]

[[Apollonius Rhodius]], at [[Argonautica]], mentions that at Thermodon the Amazons were not gathered together in one city, but scattered over the land, parted into three tribes. In one part dwelt the Themiscyreians ({{lang|grc|Θεμισκύρειαι}}), in another the Lycastians ({{lang|grc|Λυκάστιαι}}), and in another the Chadesians ({{lang|grc|Χαδήσιαι}}).&lt;ref name="ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2, 994-1001"&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/cla/argo/argo23.htm ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2, 994-1001]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other names==

Greeks also used other [[epithet|descriptive phrases]] for them. Herodotus used the ''Androktones'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδροκτόνες}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀνδροκτόνα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Androktonα}}'') ("killers/slayers of men")&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt; and ''Androleteirai'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδρολέτειραι}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀνδρολέτειρα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Androleteira}}'') ("destroyers of men, murderesses"),&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; in the [[Iliad]] they are also called ''Antianeirai'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀντιάνειραι}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀντιάνειρα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Antianeira}}'') ("equivalent to men") and Aeschylus used the ''Styganor'' ({{lang|grc|Στυγάνωρ}}) ("those who loathe all men")&lt;ref name="AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND"/&gt;&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"/&gt; in his work [[Prometheus Bound]].

[[Herodotus]] stated that in the Scythian language they were called ''Oiorpata'', ''oior'' meaning "man", and ''pata'' meaning "to slay".&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt;

==Mythology==
In some versions of the myth, no men were permitted to have sexual encounters or reside in Amazon country; but once a year, in order to prevent their race from dying out, they visited the [[Gargareans]], a neighbouring tribe.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

[[Strabo]], giving credits to [[Metrodorus of Scepsis]] and [[Hypsicrates]], mentions that at his time the Amazons were believed to live on the borders of the [[Gargareans]]. There were two special months in the spring in which they would go up into the neighboring mountain which separates them and the Gargareans. The Gargareans also, in accordance with an ancient custom, would go there to offer sacrifice with the Amazons and also to have intercourse with them for the sake of begetting children. They did this in secrecy and darkness, any Gargareans at random with any Amazon, and after making them pregnant they would send them away. Any females that were born are retained by the Amazons themselves, but the males would be taken to the Gargareans to be brought up; and each Gargarean to whom a child is brought would adopt the child as his own, regarding the child as his son because of his uncertainty.&lt;ref name="uchicago1"/&gt; He also stated that the Gargareans went up from Themiscyra into this region with the Amazons, then, in company with some Thracians and Euboeans who had wandered thus far, waged war against them. They later ended the war against the Amazons and made a compact that they should have dealings with one another only in the matter of children, and that each people should live independent of the other.&lt;ref name="uchicago1"/&gt;
In addition, he states that the right breasts of all Amazons are seared when they are infants, so that they can easily use their right arm for every needed purpose, and especially that of throwing the javelin and use the bow.&lt;ref name="uchicago1"/&gt;
[[File:Otto van Veen - Amazons and Scythians.jpg|thumb|left|320px|''Amazons and Scythians'' by [[Otto van Veen]]]]

Herodotus mentions that when Greeks defeated the Amazons at war, they sailed away carrying in three ships as many Amazons as they had been able to take alive, but out at sea the Amazons attacked the crews and killed them. But the Amazons knew nothing about ships so they were driven about by waves and winds and they were disembarked at the land of the Scythians, there they met first with a troop of horses feeding, they seized them and mounted upon these they plundered the property of the Scythians. The Scythians were not able to understand them because they did not know either their speech or their dress or the race to which they belonged, and they thought that they were men. Scythians fought a battle against them, and after the battle the Scythians got possession of the bodies of the dead, and thus they discovered that they were women. After the battle Scythians sent young men and told them to encamp near the Amazons and to do whatsoever they should do. If the women should come after them, they were not to fight but to retire before them, and when the women stopped, they were to approach near and encamp. This plan was adopted by the Scythians because they desired to have children born from them. When the Amazons perceived that they had not come to do them any harm, they let them alone; and the two camps approached nearer to one another every day: and the young men, like the Amazons, had nothing except their arms and their horses and got their living, as the Amazons did, by hunting and by taking booty. One day a Scythian and an Amazon came close. They could not speak to each other because they were speaking different languages but the Amazon made signs to him with her hand to come. Later the young Scythians and the Amazons joined their camps and lived together, each man having for his wife her with whom he had had dealings at first. The men were not able to learn the language of the Amazons, but the women learned Scythian.&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt;
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - Battle of the Amazons - WGA20302.jpg|thumb|310px|''[[The Battle of the Amazons (Rubens)|Battle of the Amazons]]'' by [[Peter Paul Rubens]]]]

[[Apollonius Rhodius]], at [[Argonautica]], mentions that Amazons were the daughters of [[Ares]] and [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]] (a nymph of the Akmonian Wood). They were brutal and aggressive, and their main concern in life was war.&lt;ref name="theoi.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2"/&gt; According to him, the Amazons were not gathered together in one city, but scattered over the land, parted into three tribes. In one part dwelt the Themiscyreians ({{lang|grc|Θεμισκύρειαι}}), in another the Lycastians ({{lang|grc|Λυκάστιαι}}), and in another the Chadesians ({{lang|grc|Χαδήσιαι}}).&lt;ref name="ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2, 994-1001"/&gt; Also, he mention that on an island, the Queens of the Amazons, Otrere ({{lang|grc|Ὀτρηρή}}) and Antiope ({{lang|grc|Ἀντιόπη}}), built a marble temple of Ares. On this desert island there were ravening birds, which in countless numbers haunt it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/cla/argo/argo17.htm ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2, 380-390]&lt;/ref&gt; The island mentioned is the [[Aretias]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D6%3Achapter%3D13 Pliny the Elder, The Natural History-Book VI-Chapter 13.5]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Argonauts]] passed by Themiscyra on their journey to [[Colchis]].

The King [[Iobates]] sent [[Bellerophon]] against Amazons, hoping that they would kill him, but Bellerophon killed them all.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' vi. 186, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholiast]] ''On [[Lycophron]]'' 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DO.%3Apoem%3D13 Pindar, Olympian 13:89]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amazons appear in [[Greek art]] of the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] and in connection with several Greek legends. The tomb of [[Myrine]] is mentioned in the ''Iliad''; later interpretation made of her an Amazon: according to [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' Book ii.45-46; book iii.52-55&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Diodorus, the Amazons under the rule of Queen Myrina, invaded the lands of the [[Atlantis|Atlantians]]. Amazons defeated the army of the Atlantian city of Cerne, treated the captives savagely, killed all the men, led into slavery the children and women, and razed the city. When the terrible fate of the inhabitants of Cerne became known among the other Atlantians, they were struck with terror, surrendered their cities on terms of capitulation and announced that they would do whatever should be commanded them. Queen Myrina bearing herself honourably towards the Atlantians, established friendship with them and founded a city to bear her name in place of the city of Cerne which had been razed; and in it she settled both the captives and any native who so desired. Atlantians presented her with magnificent presents and by public decree voted to her notable honours, and she in return accepted their courtesy and in addition promised that she would show kindness to their nation. Diodorus also mentions that the Amazons of Queen Myrina used the skins of gigantic snakes, from Libya, to protect themselves at battle. Later Queen Myrine led her Amazons to victory against the [[Gorgons]]. After the battle against the Gorgons, Myrina accorded a funeral to her fallen comrades on three pyres and raised up three great heaps of earth as tombs, which are called "Amazon Mounds" ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀμαζόνων σωρούς}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3D*.html The Library of History of Diodorus Siculus, Book III, 54]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the [[Labours of Hercules|tasks imposed upon Hercules]] by [[Eurystheus]] was to obtain possession of the [[girdle]] of the Amazonian queen [[Hippolyta]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pseudo-Apollodorus]], ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' ii. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' iv. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] xi. 244&lt;/ref&gt; He was accompanied by his friend [[Theseus]], who carried off the princess [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]], sister of Hippolyta, an incident which led to a retaliatory invasion of [[Attica]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' i. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Theseus'' 26-28&lt;/ref&gt; in which Antiope perished fighting by the side of Theseus.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; In some versions, however, Theseus marries Hippolyta and in others, he marries Antiope and she does not die; by this marriage with the Amazon Theseus had a son [[Hippolytus (son of Theseus)|Hippolytus]]. 
In another version of this myth, Theseus made this voyage on his own account, after the time of Heracles.&lt;ref name="uchicago2"/&gt;
The battle between the Athenians and Amazons is often commemorated in an entire genre of art, [[amazonomachy]], in marble [[bas-relief]]s such as from the [[Parthenon]] or the sculptures of the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]].
[[File:Johann Georg Platzer - Thalestris im Lager Alexander des Großen.jpg|left|thumb|300px|''[[Thalestris]], Queen of the Amazons, visits [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'' by [[Johann Georg Platzer]]]]

[[Plutarch]], in his work [[Parallel Lives]]-The Life of Theseus, mentions that Bion said that the Amazons, were naturally friendly to men, and did not fly from Theseus when he touched upon their coasts.&lt;ref name="uchicago2"/&gt;

Amazons attacked the [[Phrygia]]ns, who were assisted by [[Priam]], then a young man.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' iii. 189&lt;/ref&gt; In his later years, however, towards the end of the [[Trojan War]], his old opponents took his side against the Greeks under their queen [[Penthesilea]] "of [[Thrace|Thracian]] birth", who was slain by [[Achilles]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the ''[[Aethiopis]]'', a continuation of the ''Iliad''. The epic, by [[Arctinus of Miletus]], is lost: only references to it survive.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] i. 699&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Justin (historian)|Justin]] ii.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' i. 490&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' v. 11. § 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Philostratus]] ''Her.'' xix. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The god [[Dionysus]] and his entourage fought the amazons at [[Ephesus]], the Amazons fled to [[Samos]], but Dionysus pursued them and at Samos he killed a great number of them on a spot which was, from that occurrence, called Panaema ({{lang|grc|Πάναιμα}}), which means blood-soaked field.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rboWBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Amazons: Lives and Legends of Warrior Women across the Ancient World]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0216%3Asection%3D56 Plutarch, Quaestiones Graecae, Question 56]&lt;/ref&gt; In another myth Dionysus united with the Amazons to fight against [[Cronus]] and the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3E*.html DIODORUS SICULUS LIBRARY OF HISTORY, Book III, 74]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amazons are also said to have undertaken an expedition against the [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|island of Leuke]], at the mouth of the [[Danube]], where the ashes of Achilles had been deposited by [[Thetis]]. The ghost of the dead hero appeared and so terrified the horses, that they threw and trampled upon the invaders, who were forced to retire. [[Pompey]] is said to have found them in the army of [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

They are heard of in the time of Alexander, when some of the king's biographers make mention of Amazon Queen [[Thalestris]] visiting him and becoming a mother by him (the story is known from the ''[[Alexander Romance]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Greek [[Alexander Romance]], [http://www.attalus.org/translate/alexander3c.html#25 3.25-26]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, several other biographers of Alexander dispute the claim, including the highly regarded [[secondary source]], [[Plutarch]]. In his writing he makes mention of a moment when Alexander's secondary naval commander, [[Onesicritus]], was reading the Amazon passage of his Alexander history to King [[Lysimachus]] of [[Thrace]] who was on the original expedition: the king smiled at him and said "And where was I, then?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Alexander'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Alexander*/6-7.html#46 Chapter 46]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman writer [[Virgil]]'s characterization of the [[Volsci]]an warrior maiden [[Camilla (mythology)|Camilla]] in the ''[[Aeneid]]'' borrows heavily from the myth of the Amazons.

[[Jordanes]]' ''[[Getica]]'' ({{circa|560}}), purporting to give the earliest history of the [[Goths]], relates that the Goths' ancestors, descendants of [[Magog (Bible)|Magog]], originally dwelt within Scythia, on the [[Sea of Azov]] between the [[Dnieper]] and [[Don River (Russia)|Don Rivers]]. After a few centuries, following an incident where the Goths' women successfully fended off a raid by a neighboring tribe, while the menfolk were off campaigning against Pharaoh [[Vesosis]], the women formed their own army under [[Marpesia]] and crossed the Don, invading Asia. Her sister [[Lampedo]] remained in Europe to guard the homeland. They procreated with men once a year. These Amazons conquered Armenia, Syria, and all of Asia Minor, even reaching [[Ionia]] and [[Aeolis|Aeolia]], holding this vast territory for 100 years. Jordanes also mentions that they fought with Hercules, and in the Trojan War, and that a smaller contingent of them endured in the Caucasus Mountains until the time of Alexander. He mentions by name the Queens Menalippe, Hippolyta, and Penthesilea.

In the Grottaferrata Version of ''[[Digenes Akritas]]'', the twelfth century medieval epic of Basil, the Greek-Syrian knight of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] frontier, the hero battles with and kills the female warrior Maximo.

* She was descended from some Amazons.
* Taken by Alexander from the Brahmans.&lt;ref&gt;''Digenis Akritas: the Two-Blood Border Lord'', translated by Denison B. Hull, 1972, Ohio University Press, G-vi, 385-387, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several (conflicting) lists of names of Amazons.
* [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]], ''[[Posthomerica]]'' I&lt;/ref&gt; lists the attendant warriors of Penthesilea: "Clonie was there, Polemusa, Derinoe, Evandre, and [[Antandre]], and [[Bremusa]], [[Hippothoe]], dark-eyed Harmothoe, [[Alcibie]], Derimacheia, Antibrote, and Thermodosa glorying with the spear."
* [[Diodorus Siculus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' IV. 16&lt;/ref&gt; lists twelve Amazons who challenged Heracles to single combat during his quest for Hippolyta's girdle and died against him one by one: [[Aella (Amazon)|Aella]], Philippis, Prothoe, Eriboea, [[Celaeno]], Eurybia, [[Phoebe (mythological characters)|Phoebe]], Deianeira, [[Asteria (mythology)|Asteria]], Marpe, Tecmessa, Alcippe. After Alcippe's death, a group attack followed. Diodorus also mentions [[Myrina (mythology)|Myrina]] as a queen of the Amazons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3D*.html The Library of History of Diodorus Siculus, Book III]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another list of Amazons' names is found in [[Hyginus]]' ''Fabulae''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 163&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Hippolyta]], [[Otrera]], [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]] and [[Penthesilea]], it attests the following names: Ocyale, Dioxippe, Iphinome, Xanthe, [[Hippothoe]], Laomache, [[Glauce]], [[Agave (mythology)|Agave]], Theseis, Clymene, Polydora.
* Yet another different set of names is found in [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius Flaccus]]' ''Argonautica'':&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius Flaccus]], ''[http://www.theoi.com/Text/ValeriusFlaccus1.html Argonautica]'', 6. 370-377&lt;/ref&gt; he mentions Euryale, Harpe, Lyce, Menippe and Thoe. Of these Lyce also appears in a fragment preserved in the ''[[Latin Anthology]]'' where she is said to have killed the hero Clonus of [[Moesia]], son of Doryclus, with her javelin.&lt;ref name="Latin Anthology" /&gt;
* [[John Tzetzes]] in ''Posthomerica''&lt;ref&gt;[[Tzetzes]], ''Posthomerica'', 176-183&lt;/ref&gt; enumerates the Amazons who fell at [[Troy]]: Hippothoe, Antianeira, Toxophone, Toxoanassa, Gortyessa, Iodoce, Pharetre, Andro, Ioxeia, Oïstrophe, Androdaïxa, Aspidocharme, Enchesimargos, Cnemis, Thorece, Chalcaor, Eurylophe, Hecate, Anchimache, Andromache the queen. Concerning Antianeira and Andromache, see below; for almost all the other names on the list, this is a unique attestation.
* [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] provides an alternate list of the Amazons who fell against Heracles, describing them as "the most prominent" of their people: Tralla, Isocrateia, Thiba, Palla, Coea (Koia), Coenia (Koinia).&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]], s. v. ''Thibaïs''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eustathius of Thessalonica|Eustathius]] gives the same list minus the last two names.&lt;ref&gt;Eustathius on [[Dionysius Periegetes]], 828&lt;/ref&gt; Both Stephanus and Eustathius write of these Amazons in connection with the placename Thibais, which they report to have been derived from Thiba's name.

Other names of Amazons from various sources include:

* [[Aegea]], queen of the Amazons who was thought by some to have been the [[eponym]] of the [[Aegean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sextus Pompeius Festus]], s. v. ''Aegeum Mare''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ainia, presumably accompanied [[Penthesilea]] to the [[Trojan War]], killed by [[Achilles]]; known only from an Attic terracotta relief fragment.&lt;ref&gt;New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art 42.11.33, c. 600. ''LIMC'', "Achilleus" no. 720*.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ainippe, an Amazon who confronted [[Telamon]] in the battle against Heracles' troops.&lt;ref name="Perseus Digital Library - Description of the Tyrrhenian amphora" /&gt;
* Alce, who was said to have killed the young Oebalus of [[Arcadia]], son of Ida (otherwise unknown), with her spear during the Parthian War.&lt;ref name="Latin Anthology"&gt;''[[Latin Anthology]]'', 392 (''Traiani Imperatoris e Bello Parthico versus decori''), ed. Riese&lt;/ref&gt;
* Amastris, who was believed to be the [[eponym]] of the city previously known as Kromna,&lt;ref&gt;[[Demosthenes]] in [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] s. v.

===Hero cults===
According to ancient sources ([[Plutarch]], [[Theseus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:BiDerPMT15YJ:classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/theseus.html+Amazon+statues+in+Scotussa&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=4 |title=The Internet Classics Archive &amp;#124; Theseus by Plutarch |publisher=Google.com |date=2010-09-02 |accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]), Amazon tombs could be found frequently throughout what was once known as the ancient Greek world. Some are found in [[Megara]], [[Athens]], [[Chaeronea]], [[Chalcis]], [[Thessaly]] at [[Skotousa]], in [[Cynoscephalae (Thessaly)|Cynoscephalae]], and statues of Amazons are all over Greece. [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], quoting [[Ephorus]], mention that the tomb of the amazon Anaea ({{lang|grc|Ἀναία}}) was at the city of [[Söke|Anaea]] ({{lang|grc|Ἄναια}}), which also has this name after the amazon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Mary Bennett| first = Florence | title = Religious Cults Associated With the Amazons| url = http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/rca/rca02.htm| publisher = Forgotten Books |date= December 2007 | isbn = 978-1605063867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At both Chalcis and Athens, [[Plutarch]] tells us that there was an Amazoneum or shrine of Amazons that implied the presence of both tombs and cult. At the entrance of Athens there was a monument to the Amazon [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D2 Pausanias, Description of Greece]&lt;/ref&gt; On the day before the Thesea at Athens there were annual sacrifices to the Amazons. In historical times Greek maidens of [[Ephesus]] performed an annual circular dance with weapons and shields that had been established by [[Hippolyta]] and her Amazons. They had initially set up wooden statues of [[Artemis]], a ''bretas'' ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ({{floruit|{{circa|AD 160}}}}): ''Description of Greece'', Book I: Attica).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/pausanias-bk1.html |title=Ancient History Sourcebook: Pausanias: Description of Greece, Book I: Attica |publisher=Fordham.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In art===
[[File:Gladiatrix relief.jpg|thumb|left|Two [[female gladiator]]s with their names ''Amazonia and Achillea''.]]

In works of art, battles between Amazons and Greeks are placed on the same level as – and often associated with – battles of Greeks and [[centaur]]s. The belief in their existence, however, having been once accepted and introduced into the national poetry and art, it became necessary to surround them as far as possible with the appearance of natural beings. Amazons were therefore depicted in the manner of Scythian or Sarmatian horsemen. Their occupation was hunting and war; their arms the bow, spear, axe, a half shield, nearly in the shape of a crescent, called ''pelta'', and in early art a helmet. The model in the Greek mind had apparently been the goddess [[Athena]]. In later art they approach the model of Artemis, wearing a thin dress, girt high for speed; while on the later painted vases their dress is often peculiarly [[Iran|Persian]] – that is, close-fitting trousers and a high cap called the ''kidaris''. They were usually on horseback but sometimes on foot.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;
This depiction of Amazons demonstrates just how closely, in the Greek mind, the Amazons were linked to the Scythians. Their manner of dress has been noted to bear a striking similarity to the traditional dress of nomadic peoples from the Crimea to Mongolia.&lt;ref name="amaz"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/previous_seasons/case_amazon/clues.html |title=SECRETS OF THE DEAD . Amazon Warrior Women. Clues and Evidence |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amazons were described by Herodotus as wearing trousers and having tall stiff caps.{{cn|date=March 2018}} The double-sided axe was the most emblematic of their weapons.&lt;ref name="Wonder Woman"/&gt; Amazons can also be identified in vase paintings by the fact that they are wearing one earring. The battle between Theseus and the Amazons ([[Amazonomachy]]) is a favourite subject on the friezes of temples (e.g. the reliefs from the frieze of the [[Temple of Apollo at Bassae]], now in the [[British Museum]]), vases and sarcophagus reliefs; at [[Athens]] it was represented on the shield of the statue of [[Athena Parthenos]], on wall-paintings in the [[Theseum]] and in the ''[[Stoa Poikile]]''.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; There were also three standard [[Amazon statue types]].

Later in the [[The Renaissance|Renaissance]], as Amazon myth evolved, artists started to depict warrior women in a new light. [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] was often thought of as an Amazon-like warrior during her reign and was sometimes depicted as such.&lt;!-- really? Examples? --&gt; Though, as explained in ''Divinia Viagro'' by Winfried Schleiner, Celeste T. Wright "has given a detailed account of the bad press Amazons had in the Renaissance (with respect to their unwomanly conduct and Scythian cruelty). She notes that she has not found any Elizabethans comparing the queen directly to an Amazon, and suggests that they might have hesitated to do so because of the association of Amazons with enfranchisement of women, which was considered contemptible."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = "Divina Virago": Queen Elizabeth as an Amazon|jstor = 4173965|journal = Studies in Philology|date = 1978-04-01|pages = 163–180|volume = 75|issue = 2|first = Winfried|last = Schleiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Paul Rubens]] and [[Jan Brueghel the Elder|Jan Brueghel]] depicted the Battle of the Amazons around 1598, showing many attributes of Renaissance-styled paintings. Amazons also appear in the [[Rococo]] period in another painting titled ''Battle of the Amazons'' by [[Johann Georg Platzer]]. As a part of the Romantic period revival, German artist [[Anselm Feuerbach]] painted the Amazons as well. His paintings “engendered all the aspirations of the Romantics: their desire to transcend the boundaries of the ego and of the known world; their interest in the occult in nature and in the soul; their search for a national identity, and the ensuing search for the mythic origins of the Germanic nation; finally, their wish to escape the harsh realities of the present through immersion in an idealized past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = German masters of the nineteenth century : paintings and drawings from the Federal Republic of Germany / The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York :: Metropolitan Museum of Art Publications|url = http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/71300|website = libmma.contentdm.oclc.org|accessdate = 2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

==In historiography==
[[File:S03 06 01 020 image 2552.jpg|thumbnail|Amazon in combat, infl. Polyclitus, Rome. Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]
[[Herodotus]] reported that the Sarmatians were descendants of Amazons and Scythians, and that their wives observed their ancient maternal customs, "frequently hunting on horseback with their husbands; in war taking the field; and wearing the very same dress as the men". Moreover, said Herodotus, "No girl shall wed till she has killed a man in battle". In the story related by Herodotus, a group of Amazons was blown across the [[Sea of Azov|Maeotian Lake]] (the [[Sea of Azov]]) into [[Scythia]] near the cliff region (today's southeastern [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]]). After learning the Scythian language, they agreed to marry Scythian men, on the condition that they not be required to follow the customs of Scythian women. According to Herodotus, this band moved toward the northeast, settling beyond the [[Don River (Russia)|Tanais]] ([[Don River (Russia)|Don]]) river, and became the ancestors of the [[Sarmatians|Sauromatians]]. According to Herodotus, the [[Sarmatians]] fought with the Scythians against [[Darius the Great]] in the 5th century BC.

Hippocrates describes them as: "They have no right breasts...for while they are yet babies their mothers make red-hot a bronze instrument constructed for this very purpose and apply it to the right breast and cauterize it, so that its growth is arrested, and all its strength and bulk are diverted to the right shoulder and right arm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekFeb2011&amp;query=Hipp.%20Aer.%2017&amp;getid=2|title=Perseus Under Philologic: Hipp. Aer. 17|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amazons came to play a role in [[Roman historiography]]. Caesar reminded the Senate of the conquest of large parts of Asia by [[Semiramis]] and the Amazons. Successful Amazon raids against Lycia and Cilicia contrasted with effective resistance by Lydian cavalry against the invaders ([[Strabo]] 5.504; Nicholas Damascenus). [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus]] pays particularly detailed attention to the Amazons. The story of the Amazons as deriving from a Cappadocian colony of two Scythian princes Ylinos and Scolopetos is due to him. [[Pliny the Elder]] records some surprising facts pointing to the valley of the [[Terme River]] as possibly being their home: a mountain named for them (the modern Mason Dagi), as well as a settlement Amazonium; Herodotus (VI.86) first mentions their capital [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]], which Pliny locates near the Terme.&lt;ref&gt;[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]] VI.3.10&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philostratus]] places the Amazons in the [[Taurus Mountains]]. [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]] places them east of [[Tanais]], as neighbouring the [[Alans]]. [[Procopius]] places them in the Caucasus. [[Diodorus Siculus]] (''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' III, chapter 52) mentioned that besides [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] Amazons existed much older race (at that time entirely disappeared) of Amazons from western [[Ancient Libya|Libya]], and retells their mythological story which includes [[Atlantis]] and Greek mythology.

Although Strabo shows skepticism as to their historicity, the Amazons in general continue to be taken as historical throughout Late Antiquity. Several Church Fathers speak of the Amazons as of a real people. [[Gaius Julius Solinus|Solinus]] embraces the account of Pliny. Under [[Aurelianus]], captured [[Goths|Gothic]] women were identified as Amazons ([[Claudian]]us). The account of [[Justin (historian)|Justinus]] was influential, and was used as a source by [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]] who continued to be read during the European Middle Ages. Medieval authors thus continue the tradition of locating the Amazons in the North, [[Adam of Bremen]] placing them at the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Paulus Diaconus]] in the heart of Germania.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. A. Ukert]], ''Die Amazonen'', Abhandlungen der philosophisch-philologischen Classe der Königlich Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften (1849), 63..&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval and Renaissance literature==
[[File:Dahomey amazon1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dahomey Amazons]] were so named by Western observers due to their similarity to the mythical Amazons]]

Amazons continued to be discussed by authors of the European Renaissance, and with the [[Age of Exploration]], they were located in ever more remote areas. In 1542, [[Francisco de Orellana]] reached the [[Amazon River]] (''Amazonas'' in Spanish), naming it after a tribe of warlike women he claimed to have encountered and fought on the [[Nhamundá River]], a tributary of the Amazon.&lt;ref&gt;It has been suggested that what Orellana actually engaged was an especially warlike tribe of Native Americans whose warrior men had long hair and thus appeared to him as women. See Theobaldo Miranda Santos, ''Lendas e mitos do Brasil'' ("Brazil's legends and myths"), Companhia Editora Nacional, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards the whole basin and region of the Amazon (''Amazônia'' in Portuguese, ''Amazonía'' in Spanish) were named after the river. Amazons also figure in the accounts of both [[Christopher Columbus]] and [[Walter Raleigh]].&lt;ref&gt;Ukert (1849), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Famous medieval traveller [[John Mandeville]] mentions them in his book:

{{quote|Beside the land of Chaldea is the land of Amazonia, that is the land of Feminye. And in that realm is all woman and no man; not as some may say, that men may not live there, but for because that the women will not suffer no men amongst them to be their sovereigns.&lt;ref&gt;''The Travels of Sir John Mandeville'', Dover publications, Mineola, New York, 2006, cap. XVII, p. 103-104&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Medieval and Renaissance authors credit the Amazons with the invention of the [[Corded Ware culture|battle-axe]]. This is probably related to the ''[[sagaris]]'', an axe-like weapon associated with both Amazons and Scythian tribes by Greek authors (see also [[Thracian tomb of Aleksandrovo kurgan]]). [[Paulus Hector Mair]] expresses astonishment that such a "manly weapon" should have been invented by a "tribe of women", but he accepts the attribution out of respect for his authority, [[Johannes Aventinus]].

[[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' contains a country of warrior women, ruled by Queen Orontea; the epic describes an origin much like that in Greek myth, in that the women, abandoned by a band of warriors and unfaithful lovers, rallied together to form a nation from which men were severely reduced, to prevent them from regaining power. The Amazons and Queen Hippolyta are also referenced in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'' in "[[The Knight's Tale]]".

==Historical background==
[[Classics|Classicist]] Peter Walcot wrote, "Wherever the Amazons are located by the Greeks, whether it is somewhere along the Black Sea in the distant north-east, or in Libya in the furthest south, it is always beyond the confines of [[Civilization|the civilized world]]. The Amazons exist outside the range of normal human experience."&lt;ref&gt;P. Walcot, "Greek Attitudes towards Women: The Mythological Evidence" ''Greece &amp; Rome''2nd Series 31.1 (April 1984, pp. 37-47) p 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there are various proposals for a historical nucleus of the Amazons of Greek historiography, the most obvious candidates being historical [[Scythia]] and [[Sarmatia]] in line with the account by [[Herodotus]], but some authors prefer a comparison to cultures of Asia Minor or even [[Minoan Crete]].

==Archaeology==
===Scythians and Sarmatians===
Speculation that the idea of Amazons contains a core of reality is based on archaeological findings from burials, pointing to the possibility that some Sarmatian women may have participated in battle. These findings have led scholars to suggest that the Amazonian legend in [[Greek mythology]] may have been "inspired by real warrior women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/diotima/essays/wilde.shtml |title=Lyn Webster Wilde, "Did the Amazons really exist?" '&amp;#39;Diotima'&amp;#39; |publisher=Stoa.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of high-ranking warrior women comes from [[kurgan]]s in southern Ukraine and Russia.
David Anthony notes, "About 20% of [[Scythians|Scythian]]-[[Sarmatian]] 'warrior graves' on the lower [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] and lower [[Volga river|Volga]] contained women dressed for battle similar to how men dress, a phenomenon that probably inspired the Greek tales about the Amazons."&lt;ref name="anthonyd"&gt;{{cite book| last = Anthony| first = David W.| title = The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World| url = https://books.google.com/?id=mTxQmQEACAAJ| year = 2007| publisher = Princeton University Press| isbn = 0-691-05887-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amazone Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2342.jpg|thumb|Mounted Amazon in [[Scythia]]n costume, on an [[Attica|Attic]] red-figure vase, {{circa}}420 BC]]
Up to 25% of military burials were of armed Sarmatian women usually including bows.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/diotima/essays/wilde.shtml |title=Diotima |publisher=Stoa.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian archaeologist Vera Kovalevskaya points out that when Scythian men were away fighting or hunting, nomadic women would have to be able to defend themselves, their animals and pasture-grounds competently. During the time that the Scythians advanced into Asia and achieved near-[[hegemony]] in the Near East, there was a period of twenty-eight years when the men would have been away on campaigns for long periods. During this time the women would not only have had to defend themselves, but to reproduce, and this could well be the origin of the idea that Amazons mated once a year with their neighbours, if Herodotus actually based his accounts on fact.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

Before modern archaeology uncovered some of the Scythian burials of warrior-maidens entombed under [[kurgan]]s in the region of [[Altai Mountains]] and Sarmatia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/9701/abstracts/sarmatians.html "Warrior Women of Eurasia"], Archaeology Magazine (Abstract) Volume 50 Number 1, January/February 1997 Retrieved 7/10/08.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;In a recent excavation of [[Sarmatian]] sites by Dr. Jeannine Davis-Kimball,{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} a tomb was found wherein female warriors were buried.&lt;/ref&gt; giving concrete form at last to the Greek tales, the origin of the Amazon story had been the subject of speculation among classics scholars. In the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']] speculation ranged along the following lines:

{{quote|While some regard the Amazons as a purely mythical people, others assume an historical foundation for them. The deities worshipped by them were [[Ares]] (who is consistently assigned to them as a god of war, and as a god of [[Thrace|Thracian]] and generally northern origin) and [[Artemis]], not the usual Greek goddess of that name, but an Asiatic deity in some respects her equivalent. It is conjectured that the Amazons were originally the temple-servants and priestesses (''hierodulae'') of this goddess; and that the removal of the breast corresponded with the self-mutilation of the god [[Attis]] and the [[galli]], Roman priests of [[Cybele|Rhea Cybele]]. Another theory is that, as the knowledge of geography extended, travellers brought back reports of tribes ruled entirely by women, who carried out the duties which elsewhere were regarded as peculiar to man, in whom alone the rights of nobility and inheritance were vested, and who had the supreme control of affairs. Hence arose the belief in the Amazons as a nation of female warriors, organized and governed entirely by women. According to J. Viirtheim (''De Ajacis'' origine, 1907), the Amazons were of Greek origin [...] It has been suggested that the fact of the conquest of the Amazons being assigned to the two famous heroes of Greek mythology, Heracles and Theseus [...] shows that they were mythical illustrations of the dangers which beset the Greeks on the coasts of Asia Minor; rather perhaps, it may be intended to represent the conflict between the Greek culture of the colonies on the [[Black Sea|Euxine]] and the barbarism of the native inhabitants.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;}}

===Minoan Crete===
[[File:Departure of the Amazons MET DP318355.jpg|thumb|''Departure of the Amazons'', by [[Claude Deruet]], 1620]]

When [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] archeology was still in its infancy, nevertheless, a theory raised in an essay regarding the Amazons contributed by [[Lewis Richard Farnell]] and [[John Myres]] to [[Robert Ranulph Marett]]'s ''Anthropology and the Classics'' (1908),&lt;ref&gt;L.R. Farnell and J.L. Myres, "Herodotus and anthropology" in [[Robert Ranulph Marett|Robert R. Marett]] ''Anthropology and the Classics'' 1908, pp. 138ff.&lt;/ref&gt; placed their possible origins in Minoan civilization, drawing attention to overlooked similarities between the two cultures. According to Myres,&lt;ref&gt;(pp.&amp;nbsp;153 ff)&lt;/ref&gt; the tradition interpreted in the light of evidence furnished by supposed Amazon cults seems to have been very similar and may have even originated in Minoan culture. &lt;!--The following is a "hard sell" for an outdated idea: "The theory that the Amazons originally represented Minoan Crete's women has a strong case based on what [[archeologists]] and historians have been discovering about Minoan culture. Out of all the ancient civilizations which are so far known to archaeologists and historians the Minoans seem to fit most of the aspects that classical Greeks and later scholars have come to associate with the Amazonian culture."--&gt;

==Modern legacy==
[[File:Amazone auf Sondermarke.jpg|thumb|Amazon on a special stamp promoting German horse races in the 1930s.]]
[[File:Juliusz Kossak - Amazonka.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Juliusz Kossak]] "An Amazon"]]
[[Francisco de Orellana]] gave the [[Amazon river]] its name after reporting pitched battles with tribes of female warriors, whom he likened to the Amazons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/place/Amazon-River Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Samsun]] in modern-day [[Turkey]] features a recently constructed "Amazon Village" museum, created to bring attention to the legacy of the Amazons and to generate both academic interest and popular tourism.&lt;ref name="todayszaman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&amp;link=212625 |title=Village of Amazons to be recreated in Samsun park - Today's Zaman, your gateway to Turkish daily news |publisher=Todayszaman.com |date=2010-06-10 |accessdate=2014-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201214800/http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&amp;link=212625 |archivedate=2014-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A festival is also held every year in the [[Terme]] district of [[Samsun Province]] to celebrate the Amazons.&lt;ref name="todayszaman" /&gt;

In Greece, female [[equestrians]] are also called "Amazons" ({{lang-el|Αμαζόνες}}).

Amazons became an important subject of the fine arts around 1900, especially in the work of the Munich painter and sculptor [[Franz Stuck]] (1863-1928). 

In Nazi-Germany open air events called "Nacht der Amazonen" ([[Night of the Amazons]]) were performed at [[Nymphenburg Palace]] in [[Munich]] between 1936 and 1939. These revues with bare-breasted girls presented an allegedly emancipated female role as part of the „new race“ intended to be realized by racial fanatics.

:''This article concerns the two antipopes Benedict XIV, claimants to the [[Papacy]] during the 15th century. Another [[Pope Benedict XIV]], canonically recognized as Pope, reigned in the 18th century.''

'''Benedict XIV''' was the name used by two closely related minor [[antipope]]s of the 15th century. The first, '''Bernard Garnier''' became [[antipope]] in 1424 and died c. 1429.&lt;ref&gt;John Julius Norwich, ''Absolute Monarchs: A History of the Papacy'', (Random House, 2011), 479.&lt;/ref&gt; The second, '''Jean Carrier''', became antipope c. 1430 and apparently left office, whether by death or resignation, by 1437.

Neither of these claimants was supported by more than a very small faction within the Church. They claimed to be the successors to [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]], one of the parties to the great [[Papal Schism]]. In 1417, the [[Council of Constance]] resolved the Schism, proclaiming [[Martin V]] the new Pope and demanding that Benedict XIII renounce his claim. Benedict XIII, however, remained at a castle in [[Peñíscola]] ([[kingdom of Valencia]]) and continued to maintain supporters. He died in 1423, but, the day before his death, he created four cardinals loyal to him, in order to ensure the Avignon line. Three of these cardinals met and elected [[Antipope Clement VIII]]. However, one of Benedict XIII's cardinals, Jean Carrier, disputed the validity of this election. Carrier, acting as the [[College of Cardinals]] by himself, elected Bernard Garnier, who took the name Pope Benedict XIV, instead.&lt;ref&gt;John-Peter Pham, ''Heirs of the Fisherman: Behind the Scenes of Papal Death and Succession'', (Oxford University Press, 2004), 332.&lt;/ref&gt; Carrier was the archdeacon of [[Rodez]], near [[Toulouse]], and Garnier had been the [[sacristan]] of Rodez.

Garnier conducted his office secretly and was known as the "hidden pope": a letter from the [[Count of Armagnac]] to [[Joan of Arc]] indicates that only Carrier knew Benedict XIV's location. Garnier's reign as Benedict XIV ended at his death in 1429 or 1430, although he named four of his own cardinals, one of whom was named Jean Farald.

Following Garnier's death, Jean Carrier elected himself as the new pope, and also styled himself Pope Benedict XIV.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Walsh, ''The Conclave: A Sometimes Secret and Occasionally Bloody History of Papal Elections'', (Canterbury Press, 2003), 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Carrier, however, had been captured and imprisoned by Antipope Clement VIII. Carrier finished his days in captivity in the castle of Foix.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Salembier, [https://archive.org/stream/greatschismwest00saleuoft#page/n365/mode/2up ''The Great Schism of the West''], (Keegan Paul, Trench, Trubner &amp; Co., 1907), 357.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
[[Antipopes in fiction|Some imagine]] that cardinals loyal to him elected a series of increasingly marginal antipopes in 1437 and 1470. For instance, this is the scenario in the 1995 novel ''[[l'Anneau du pêcheur]]'' by the French writer [[Jean Raspail]].&lt;ref&gt;''L'Anneau du pêcheur'', Paris : Albin Michel, 1994. 403 p. {{ISBN|2-226-07590-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeJesus was taken under the impression that she was being dropped off, and trusted Castro because she was friends with his teenage daughter. Because no one witnessed DeJesus's abduction, an [[AMBER Alert]] was not issued, which angered DeJesus's father.

==Captivity==
After Knight's kidnapping, Castro took her upstairs, tied her hands and feet together, and pulled her up using her hands, feet, and neck. He left her there for three days without food. Prosecutors at Castro's sentencing wrote that diaries kept by the women "speak of forced sexual conduct, of being locked in a dark room, of anticipating the next session of abuse, of the dreams of someday escaping and being reunited with family, of being chained to a wall, of being held like a [[prisoner of war]], of missing the lives they once enjoyed, of [[Psychological abuse|emotional abuse]], of his threats to kill, of being treated like an animal, of continuous abuse, and of desiring freedom". The women were kept in locked upstairs bedrooms, where they were forced to use plastic toilets that were "emptied infrequently".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/07/ariel_castro_sentencing_memo_r.html |title=Ariel Castro sentencing memorandum filed by prosecutors |last1=Krouse |first1=Peter |date=July 31, 2013 |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |accessdate=August 6, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130804045034/http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/07/ariel_castro_sentencing_memo_r.html |archivedate=August 4, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were fed one meal a day, and allowed to shower twice a week at most.&lt;ref name=cnn080213&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/01/justice/ohio-cleveland-castro-home |title=Deception, threats and abuse: Captives' hellish life inside Castro's home |last1=Botelho |first1=Greg |date=August 2, 2013 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=August 6, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805195802/http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/01/justice/ohio-cleveland-castro-home |archivedate=August 5, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knight told police that Castro had impregnated her at least five times, and had induced [[miscarriage]]s each time through beatings: hitting with [[dumbbell]]s, punching, and slamming her against walls.

He would alternatively shift back into apologetic comments, saying: "I hope they can find in their hearts to forgive me because we had a lot of harmony going on in that home".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wkyc.com/news/article/308810/45/STATEMENT--Read-Ariel-Castros-final-remarks-in-court |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130806234708/http://www.wkyc.com/news/article/308810/45/STATEMENT--Read-Ariel-Castros-final-remarks-in-court |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 6, 2013 |title=Ariel Castro spoke for 20 minutes in court, read what he said here |date=August 1, 2013 |publisher=WKYC |accessdate=August 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sentencing judge also heard from Knight and family members of Berry and DeJesus. Knight told Castro: "You took eleven years of my life away. I spent eleven years in hell, now your hell is just beginning. I will overcome all that has happened, but you will face hell for eternity. I will live on, you will die a little every day as you think of the eleven years of atrocities that you inflicted on us... I can forgive you, but I will never forget."&lt;ref name=pd130801/&gt;

==Aftermath==
===Survivors===
On July 9, 2013, Knight, Berry, and DeJesus broke their public silence for the first time since their rescue by releasing a video statement thanking the public for their support. An attorney for Berry and DeJesus said the women "still have a strong desire for privacy" and did not wish to speak to the media about their ordeal.&lt;ref name=pd070913&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/07/amanda_berry_gina_dejesus_and_2.html |title=New video: Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight, Cleveland's 3 missing women, thank you for your support |last1=Caniglia |first1=John |date=July 9, 2013 |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |accessdate=July 9, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710092111/http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/07/amanda_berry_gina_dejesus_and_2.html |archivedate=July 10, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/news/local_news/cleveland_metro/transcript-cleveland-kidnapping-victims-say-thank-for-support |title=TRANSCRIPT: Cleveland kidnapping victims say thank you for support |last1=Steer |first1=Jen |date=July 9, 2013 |publisher=newsnet5.com |accessdate=July 9, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130711210648/http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/news/local_news/cleveland_metro/transcript-cleveland-kidnapping-victims-say-thank-for-support |archivedate=July 11, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cleveland Courage Fund, a bank account set up to help the women in their transition to independent life, had collected approximately $1.05&amp;nbsp;million at the time of the video's release.&lt;ref name=pd070913/&gt; Before Berry's disappearance, her grandfather had promised to give her a classic [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]] from the year Berry was born.

===House demolition===

As part of the plea bargain, the house where Castro lived, and where he had held the women captive, was demolished on August 7, 2013. Knight was present and handed out yellow balloons, which she said represented missing children, to the gathered crowd. The balloons were released before DeJesus's aunt began the demolition with a swing of a [[crane (machine)|crane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/cleveland-house-horrors-destroyed-demolition-crews-tear-ariel-castro-home-article-1.1419792 |title=Cleveland house of horrors destroyed — demolition crews tear down Ariel Castro's home |last1=Kemp |first1=Joe |date=August 7, 2013 |newspaper=NY Daily News |accessdate=August 7, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810195725/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/cleveland-house-horrors-destroyed-demolition-crews-tear-ariel-castro-home-article-1.1419792 |archivedate=August 10, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/cleveland-kidnapper-ariel-castros-house-horrors-demolished/story?id=19890927 |title=Cleveland Kidnapper Ariel Castro's 'House of Horrors' Demolished |last1=Ng |first1=Christina |date=August 7, 2013 |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=August 7, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810182609/http://abcnews.go.com/US/cleveland-kidnapper-ariel-castros-house-horrors-demolished/story?id=19890927 |archivedate=August 10, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/news/local_news/oh_cuyahoga/michelle-knight-held-captive-for-decade-by-ariel-castro-hands-out-yellow-balloons-on-seymour-avenue |title=Michelle Knight held captive for decade by Ariel Castro hands out yellow balloons on Seymour Avenue |last1=Seitz |first1=Colleen |date=August 7, 2013 |publisher=newsnet5.com |accessdate=August 7, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810222225/http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/news/local_news/oh_cuyahoga/michelle-knight-held-captive-for-decade-by-ariel-castro-hands-out-yellow-balloons-on-seymour-avenue |archivedate=August 10, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Castro's death ===
On the evening of September 3, 2013, one month into his life sentence, Castro was found hanging with a bed sheet in his detention cell at the [[Correctional Reception Center]] in [[Orient, Ohio]].&lt;ref name="AP suicide"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ohio-man-who-held-3-women-captive-found-dead |title=Cleveland man's suicide brings little sympathy |last1=Sheeran |first1=Thomas J. |last2=Welsh-Huggins |first2=Andrew |date=September 4, 2013 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=October 3, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20131004072333/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ohio-man-who-held-3-women-captive-found-dead |archivedate=October 4, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prison staff performed [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] on Castro before he was taken to the [[Wexner Medical Center at Ohio State University|Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], where he was pronounced dead shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="AP suicide"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Woods|first=Jim|title=Ariel Castro dies in apparent suicide|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/public/2013/09/04/ariel-castro-commits-suicide-in-prison.html|newspaper=The Columbus Dispatch|date=September 4, 2013|accessdate=September 4, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906090516/http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/public/2013/09/04/ariel-castro-commits-suicide-in-prison.html|archivedate=September 6, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/04/justice/ariel-castro-cleveland-kidnapper-death/?hpt=hp_t1 |last1=Mungin |first1=Lateef |last2=Alsup |first2=Dave |publisher=CNN |date=September 4, 2013 |title=Ariel Castro, Cleveland kidnapper, found hanged in prison cell |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6JNhFIjnY?url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/04/justice/ariel-castro-cleveland-kidnapper-death/?hpt=hp_t1 |archivedate=September 4, 2013 |accessdate=September 4, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, [[Franklin County, Ohio|Franklin County]] [[coroner]] Dr. Jan Gorniak announced that a preliminary [[autopsy]] had found the cause of Castro's death to be suicide by hanging.&lt;ref name="usatoday-Eversley"&gt;{{cite news|last=Eversley|first=Melanie|title=The Ohio kidnapper was not on suicide watch, but was checked on every 30 minutes by guards.|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/04/ariel-castro-hung-prison/2761177/|accessdate=September 4, 2013|newspaper=USA Today|date=September 4, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904195004/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/04/ariel-castro-hung-prison/2761177/|archivedate=September 4, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 10, 2013, the [[Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction]] released a report that suggested Castro may have died accidentally from auto-[[erotic asphyxiation]] rather than suicide. Gorniak rejected the possibility, standing by her ruling of suicide. The report also said two prison guards had falsified logs documenting their observation of Castro hours before he was found dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Castro suicide report: Officers falsified reports|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2013/10/10/Ariel-Castro-suicide-report.html|publisher=The Columbus Dispatch|accessdate=October 10, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010150554/http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2013/10/10/Ariel-Castro-suicide-report.html|archivedate=October 10, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castro was not on [[suicide watch]] at the time of his death, but had been subject to routine checks every thirty minutes due to his notoriety.&lt;ref name="AP suicide"/&gt;

A consultant's report was released on December 3, and officially concluded that "all available evidence pointed to suicide, including a shrine-like arrangement of family pictures and a Bible in Castro's cell, an increasing tone of frustration in his prison journal and the reality of spending the rest of his life in prison while subject to constant harassment." The [[Ohio State Highway Patrol]] also reviewed the case and reached the same conclusion.&lt;ref name="suiciderpt"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/03/consultants-ariel-castro-death-suicide/3850515/ |title=Consultants: Kidnapper Ariel Castro's death a suicide |last=Welsh-Huggins |first1=Andrew |date=December 3, 2013 |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=USA Today |accessdate=October 3, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206061146/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/03/consultants-ariel-castro-death-suicide/3850515/ |archivedate=December 6, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the embarrassment of their mentors, and the dismay of Washington, one Batch 10 member, Said al-Shihri, has since re-surfaced as no less than deputy leader of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the movement’s new Yemen-based branch. The group opened up the latest frontier in the war on terror last month, when it claimed to have groomed the so-called Detroit “Underpants Bomber”, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab.

| quote=With its swimming pool, games rooms and therapy courses such as '10 Steps Toward Positive Thinking', it resembles a jihadist's version of a mental health treatment clinic. Yet like any rehab program, it also has its recidivists - and 'batch 10', to which Bawardi belonged, is a case in point.

Five of the fourteen captives in this group repatriated to Saudi captivity on November 9, 2007 were among the eleven former Guantanamo captives to be listed on the 85 men on the [[Saudi list of most wanted suspected terrorists]], published on February 3, 2009.
One of the cohort, [[Said Ali al-Shihri]], became second in command of [[Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]].

According to [[Peter Taylor (journalist)|Peter Taylor]], reporting for the ''BBC'', his team found that the cohort of Saudis repatriated in November 2007 problematic.&lt;ref name=Bbc2010-10-13/&gt;
He reported that many of these captives were not rehabilitated.
He reported that five of the fourteen men in batch 10 escaped to [[Yemen]], and joined jihadists there.
The version of the men's names were [[Mohammed al-Awfi]], [[Said al-Shihri]], [[Yussef al-Shihri]], [[Murtadha Ali Saeed Magram]] and [[Turki Meshawi Zayid al-Assiri]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21730">The '''Belyayev circle''' ({{lang-ru|'''Беляевский кружок'''}}) was a society of Russian musicians who met in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]] between 1885 and 1908, and whose members included [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Alexander Glazunov]], [[Vladimir Stasov]], [[Anatoly Lyadov]], [[Alexander Ossovsky]], [[Witold Maliszewski]], [[Nikolai Tcherepnin]], [[Nikolay Sokolov (composer)|Nikolay Sokolov]], [[Alexander Winkler (composer)|Alexander Winkler]] among others. The circle was named after [[Mitrofan Belyayev]], a [[lumber|timber]] merchant and amateur musician who became a music philanthropist and publisher after hearing the music of the teenage Glazunov.

The Belyayev circle believed in a [[musical nationalism|national]] style of classical music, based on the achievements of the composer group [[The Five (composers)|The Five]] which preceded it. One important difference between composers in the Belyayev circle and their counterparts in the Five was an acceptance in the necessity of Western-styled academic training; this was an attitude passed down by Rimsky-Korsakov, who taught many of the composers in the circle at the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]]. While these composers were more open to Western compositional practices and influences, especially through the music of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], they closely followed many of the compositional practices of the Five to the point of mannerism, especially in their depiction of folkloric subject matter.

The Belyayev circle came to dominate musical life in St. Petersburg. Composers who desired patronage, publication or public performance of their works through Belyayev were compelled to write in a musical style accepted by Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov. There was also peer pressure to compose in this style, as well as a distrust of composers who did not do so. Several composers who believed in the philosophy of the Belyayev circle became professors and heads of music conservatories in Russia, which extended the influence of the group past the physical confines of St. Petersburg and timewise well into the 20th century.

==Belyayev==
{{see also|Mitrofan Belyayev}}
[[File:Belyayev by Repin.jpg|thumb|180px|right|alt=A middle-aged man with medium-length dark hair and a beard, wearing a dark suit, with one hand in his trouser pocket and the other hand on his chin|Portrait of [[Mitrofan Belyayev]] by [[Ilya Repin]]]]

Belyayev was one of a growing number of Russian nouveau-riche industrialists who became patrons of the arts in mid- to late-19th century Russia; their number included Nadezhda von Meck, railway magnate [[Savva Mamontov]] and textile manufacturer [[Pavel Tretyakov]].&lt;ref&gt;Figes, 195–197; Maes, 173–174, 196–197.&lt;/ref&gt; While Nadezhda von Meck insisted on anonymity in her patronage in the tradition of ''[[noblesse oblige]]'', Belyayev, Mamontov and Tretyakov "wanted to contribute conspicuously to public life".&lt;ref name="taruskin49"&gt;Taruskin, 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their cultural and political orientation, they were more likely than the aristocracy to support native talent, and were more inclined to support nationalist artists over cosmopolitan ones.&lt;ref name="taruskin42"/&gt; This was not due to any social or political agenda implicit in the art, but due to the Russianness of the art itself.&lt;ref name="taruskin42"&gt;Taruskin, 42.&lt;/ref&gt; This included the music of the composers Belyayev chose to support.&lt;ref name="taruskin42"/&gt;

An amateur [[viola]] player and [[chamber music]] enthusiast, Belyayev hosted "[[string quartet|quartet]] Fridays" at his home in St. Petersburg. A frequent visitor to these gatherings was Rimsky-Korsakov.&lt;ref&gt;Maes, 172–173.&lt;/ref&gt; Belyayev became a music patron after he had heard the [[Symphony No. 1 (Glazunov)|First Symphony]] by the sixteen-year-old Glazunov, who had been discovered by Balakirev and tutored by Rimsky-Korsakov in musical composition, [[counterpoint]] and orchestration. Not only did Glazunov become a fixture of the "quartet Fridays", but Belyayev also published Glazunov's work and took him on a tour of Western Europe. This tour included a visit to [[Weimar]], [[Germany]] to present the young composer to famed Hungarian composer and pianist [[Franz Liszt]].&lt;ref name="maes192"&gt;Maes, 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon Belyayev became interested in other Russian composers. In 1884 he set up an annual [[Glinka prize]], named after pioneer Russian composer [[Mikhail Glinka]] (1804–1857). In 1885 he founded his own music publishing firm, based in [[Leipzig]], Germany, through which he published works by Glazunov, Rimsky-Korsakov, Lyadov and Borodin at his own expense.&lt;ref name="maes173"/&gt; By publishing in Leipzig, Belyayev could offer the double benefit of higher quality music printing than was available in Russia at the time, plus the protection of international [[copyright]] which Russia did not offer.&lt;ref name="taruskin49"/&gt; At Rimsky-Korsakov's suggestion, Belyayev also founded his own concert series, the [[Russian Symphony Concerts]], open exclusively to Russian composers. Among the works written especially for this series were the three by Rimsky-Korsakov by which he is currently best known in the West—''[[Scheherazade]]'', the ''[[Russian Easter Festival Overture]]'' and ''[[Capriccio espagnol]]''. To select which composers to assist with money, publication or performances from the many who now appealed for help, Belyayev set up an advisory council made up of Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov. They would look through the compositions and appeals submitted and suggest which composers were deserving of patronage and public attention.&lt;ref name="maes173"&gt;Maes, 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The musical scene in St. Petersburg came to be dominated by the Belyayev circle since Rimsky-Korsakov had taught many of its members at the Conservatory there. Since Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov acted in an advisory capacity to the Belyayev enterprises, and thus became channels of Belyayev's largesse,&lt;ref name="taruskin56"/&gt; composers who wished to be part of this circle and who desired Belyayev's patronage had to write in a musical style approved by these three men.&lt;ref name="maes173"/&gt; Because of this stricture, Rimsky-Korsakov's style became the preferred academic style—one that young composers had to follow if they hoped to have any sort of career.&lt;ref name="maes173"&gt;Maes, 173.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the Belyayev circle acted as a compositional [[guild]].&lt;ref name="taruskin56"/&gt; The better pupils from the St. Petersburg Conservatory received initiation by their invitation to the "quartet Fridays", and admission to the circle "guaranteed well remunerated publication by Edition Belieff, Leipzig, and performance in the Russian Symphony Concert programs".&lt;ref name="taruskin56"&gt;Taruskin, 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Belyayev circle "set up an establishment that governed all aspects of musical creation, education and performance".&lt;ref name="taruskin56"/&gt;

==Philosophy==
The Belyayev circle ran counter in its philosophy to the artistic movement and magazine ''[[Mir iskusstva]]'' ({{lang-ru|«Мир иску́сства»}}, ''World of Art''). ''Mir iskusstva'' "identified with the artistic values of the [Russian] aristocracy" in its cosmopolitanism and belief of a universal culture.&lt;ref&gt;Figes, 268–269.&lt;/ref&gt; The composers of the Belyayev circle, like the Five before it, believed in a national, realist form of Russian classical music that should stand apart in its style and characteristics from Western European classical music. In this sense, the Belyayev composers shared similar goals with the [[Abramtsevo Colony]] and [[Russian Revival architecture|Russian Revival]] in the sphere of fine arts. Another way ''Mir iskusstva'' disagreed with the Belyayev circle was that they believed the composers under Belyayev were practicing art for art's sake, much like a social program. This practice ran counter to their belief in focusing on "art as the spiritual expression of the individual's creative genius", as they felt [[Alexander Pushkin]] had done in his poetry and Tchaikovsky in his music.&lt;ref&gt;Figes, 269.&lt;/ref&gt; Alfred Nurok commented in an 1899 review in ''Mir iskusstva'':

{{quote|Mr. Belyayev's [[Gaius Maecenas|Maecenas]] activities bear a very special imprint. His undeniably lavish patronage of Russian music of the newest variety does not, unfortunately, so much facilitate the development of the talents of gifted but as yet unrecognized composers, as it encourages young people who have successfully completed their conservatory course to cultivate productivity come what may, touching little upon the question of their creative abilities. Mr. Belyayev encourages industry above all, and under his [[aegis]] musical composition has assumed the character of a workers' collective (''[[artel]]''), or even a crafts industry.|&lt;ref&gt;As cited in Maes, 173.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Musicologist [[Richard Taruskin]] writes, "Within the Belyayev circle a safe conformism became increasingly the rule".&lt;ref name="taruskin57"&gt;Taruskin, 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Concert programs needed to be filled with new Russian works, and new works had to be published to offer to the music public. It was therefore necessary "to dip rather deep into the pool of available Conservatory trained talent", and the circle became known for the number of less-than-first-rate talents harbored within it.&lt;ref name="taruskin57"/&gt; Critic and composer [[César Cui]], who had been part of the Five along with Rimsky-Korsakov, derisively called these younger composers "clones".&lt;ref name="taruskin57"/&gt; Though there was some snobbism involved in criticism of the Belyayev circle, there was also enough truth in the issue of conformism to cause the circle some embarrassment.&lt;ref name="taruskin57"/&gt;
A contributing factor to this conformism was the gradual academization of composers in the nationalist circle, fueled by Rimsky-Korsakov's efforts in this regard with his students.&lt;ref name="mfw21403"&gt;Frolova-Walker, ''New Grove (2001)'', 21:403.&lt;/ref&gt; An increasing number of these students joined the Belyayev circle; the result was "the emergence of production-line 'Russian style' pieces, polished and correct, but lacking originality".&lt;ref name="mfw21403"/&gt;

==Comparison to the Five==
[[File:Glazunov by Repin.jpg|thumb|alt=A young man with reddish hair wearing a dark suit|Portrait of [[Alexander Glazunov]] by [[Ilya Repin]], 1887]]

The composers who formed the Belyayev circle were nationalistic in their outlook, as were the Five before them. Like the Five, they believed in a uniquely Russian style of classical music that utilized folk music and exotic melodic, harmonic and rhythmic elements, as exemplified by the music of Balakirev, Borodin and Rimsky-Korsakov. Unlike the Five, these composers also believed in the necessity of an academic, Western-based background in composition. The necessity of Western compositional techniques was something that Rimsky-Korsakov had instilled in many of them in his years at the St. Petersburg Conservatory.&lt;ref name="maes192"/&gt; Compared to the "revolutionary" composers in Balakirev's circle, Rimsky-Korsakov found those in the Belyayev circle to be "progressive ... attaching as it did great importance to technical perfection, but ... also broke new paths, though more securely, even if less speedily...."&lt;ref name="rk286"&gt;Rimsky-Korsakov, 286–287.&lt;/ref&gt;

Glazunov's attitude toward outside influences was typical of the Belyayev circle. He studied Tchaikovsky's works and "found much that was new ... that was instructive for us as young musicians. It struck me that Tchaikovsky, who was above all a lyrical and melodic composer, had introduced operatic elements into his symphonies. I admired the thematic material of his works less than the inspired unfolding of his thoughts, his temperament and the constructural perfection."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Lobanova, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Rimsky-Korsakov noted "a tendency toward [[eclecticism]]" among the composers in the Belyayev circle, as well as a "predilection ... for Italian-French music of the time of wig and [[farthingale]] [that is, the eighteenth century], music introduced by Tchaikovsky in his ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|Queen of Spades]]'' and ''[[Iolanthe (Tchaikovsky)|Iolanthe]]''".&lt;ref&gt;Rimsky-Korsakov, 309.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, while the Belyayev circle was more tolerant of outside influence to a certain degree than their predecessors under Balakirev,&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, ''New Grove (1980)'', 7:428.&lt;/ref&gt; they still followed the compositional practices of the Five closely. Maes writes, "The harmonies of [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s coronation scene in ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris]]'', the [[octatonic scale|octatonicism]] of ''[[Mlada (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Mlada]]'' and ''[[Sadko (opera)|Sadko]]'', Balakirev's folk-song stylizations, Rimsky-Korsakov's colorful [[harmony|harmonization]]—all these served as a store of recipes for writing Russian national music. In the portrayal of the national character ... these techniques prevailed over the subjects portrayed".&lt;ref name="maes192"/&gt;

==Folklorism, orientalism, "fantastic" style==
Unlike their predecessors in the Five, composers in the Belyayev circle did not concern themselves greatly with [[fakelore|folklorism]]—the invention or adaptation of [[folklore]] to newly written stories or songs, or to folklore that is reworked and modified for modern tastes. They also did not travel to other parts of Russia to actively search for folk songs, as Balakirev had done. When the Belyayev composers produced folkloric works, "they simply imitated Balakirev's or Rimsky-Korsakov's styles".&lt;ref&gt;Maes, 192–193.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the Belyayev composers, [[Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov]], continued the Five's work in musical [[orientalism]]—the use of exotic melodic, harmonic and rhythmic elements to depict the middle- and far-eastern parts of the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Figes, 390–391; Maes, 80–83.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote three operas set in an oriental background and composed in Balakirev's style—''Ruth'', ''Azra'' and ''Izmena''. The story for the last of these operas "deals with the struggle between Christians and Muslims during the sixteenth-century occupation of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] by the Persians".&lt;ref name="maes193"&gt;Maes, 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Ippolotov-Ivanov is best known in the West for his two sets of ''[[Caucasian Sketches]]'' "an orientalist orchestral work modeled on Balakirev and Borodin".&lt;ref name="maes193"/&gt;

Lyadov wrote in a "fantastic" vein akin to Rimsky-Korsakov's, especially in his tone poems based on Russian fairy tales, ''Baba Yaga'', ''Kikimora'' and ''The Enchanted Lake''.&lt;ref name="maes192"&gt;Maes, 192.&lt;/ref&gt; This style of musical writing was based on extensive use of the [[whole tone scale]] and the [[octatonic scale]] to depict supernatural or magical characters and events, hence the term "fantastic".&lt;ref&gt;Maes, 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt; Though he would break from the Belyayev aesthetic in subsequent works, [[Igor Stravinsky]] wrote his [[Ballet (music)|ballet]] ''[[The Firebird]]'' in a similar musical style.&lt;ref&gt;Maes, 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intolerance of non-compliant composers==
[[File:Young Rachmaninoff 2.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A clean-shaven young man with close-cropped hair, wearing a dark jacket, dress shirt with a high stiff collar and tie, looking toward the viewer with one hand on the side of his head|Sergei Rachmaninoff]]

Despite Rimsky-Korsakov's denial of bias among composers of the Belyayev circle,&lt;ref name="rk286"/&gt; musicologist [[Solomon Volkov]] mentions that they and the Five shared a mutual suspicion of compositions that did not follow its canon.&lt;ref name="volkov350"&gt;Volkov, ''St. Petersburg'', 350.&lt;/ref&gt; This proved especially true of the [[Symphony No. 1 (Rachmaninoff)|First Symphony]] of [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], a Moscow composer and protege of Tchaikovsky. Rimsky-Korsakov, whose own musical preferences in his later years were not overly progressive,&lt;ref&gt;Maes, 180—181.&lt;/ref&gt; may have sounded an advance warning on hearing the symphony in rehearsal when he told Rachmaninoff, "Forgive me, but I do not find this music at all agreeable".&lt;ref&gt;Bertenssohn and Leyva, 71.&lt;/ref&gt; By the reports of many present, the rehearsal that Rimsky-Korsakov had heard, conducted by Glazunov, was both a disaster as a performance and a horrific travesty of the score.&lt;ref name="har76"&gt;Harrison, 76.&lt;/ref&gt; The premiere, held in St. Petersburg on March 28, 1897, went no better. Cui wrote in his review of the work, among other things, "If there were a [[College or university school of music|conservatory]] in [[Hell]], and if one of its talented students were to compose a programme symphony based on the story of the [[Plagues of Egypt|Ten Plagues of Egypt]], and if he were to compose a symphony like Mr. Rachmaninoff's, then he would have fulfilled his task brilliantly and would delight the inhabitants of Hell".&lt;ref&gt;Cui, Ts., "Tretiy russkiy simfonicheskiy kontsert," ''Novosti i birzhevaya gazeta'' (17 March 1897(o.s.), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The symphony was not performed again in Rachmaninoff's lifetime,&lt;ref&gt;Bertenssohn and Leyva, 74.&lt;/ref&gt; and while Rachmaninoff did not destroy or disavow the score, he suffered a psychological collapse that led to a three-year creative hiatus.&lt;ref&gt;Bertenssohn and Leyva, 144–145; Norris, ''Rachmaninoff'', 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernism==
Maes writes that the composers who formed the Belyayev circle have often been described as "important links to, and pathbreakers for" modernist Russian composers such as Stravinsky and [[Sergei Prokofiev]]. This, he asserts, is actually a false assumption which suggests that modernism was the result of a gradual process.&lt;ref name="maes195"&gt;Maes, 195.&lt;/ref&gt; The truth, Maes suggests, was that modernist music in Russia was a much more radical break from the Belyayev circle than many have claimed.&lt;ref name="maes195"/&gt; Rimsky-Korsakov's extensive use of the [[octatonic scale]] and other harmonic experiments "was a gold mine for those bent on a modernist revolution," Maes writes. "However, the renewing force had still to be liberated from the cliches and routines into which the Belyayev aesthetic had been pressed".&lt;ref name="maes195"/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Dmitrij Dmitrijevič Šostakovič (Дми́трий Дми́триевич Шостако́вич).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A young man wearing round-framed glasses, a dark jacket, tie and dress shirt|Dmitri Shostakovich, 1925]]

Bias toward the musical aesthetics practiced by the Belyayev circle would continue at the St. Petersburg Conservatory after Rimsky-Korsakov's retirement in 1906,&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin, 73.&lt;/ref&gt; with his son-in-law [[Maximilian Steinberg]] in charge of composition classes at the Conservatory through the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] would complain about Steinberg's musical conservatism, typified by such phrases as "the inviolable foundations of the ''kuchka''" and the "sacred traditions of Nikolai Andreyevich [Rimsky-Korsakov]".&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Shostakovich to Tatyana Glivenko dated February 26, 1924. As quoted in Fay, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Nor was this traditionalism limited to St. Petersburg. Well into the Soviet era, many other music conservatories remained run by traditionalists such as Ippolitov-Ivanov in Moscow and [[Reinhold Glière]] in [[Petro Tchaikovsky National Music Academy of Ukraine|Kiev]]. Because of these individuals, Maes writes, "the conservatories retained a direct link with the Belyayev aesthetic".&lt;ref&gt;Maes, 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Brat Pack''' is a nickname given to a group of young actors who frequently appeared together in teen-oriented [[:Category:Coming-of-age films|coming-of-age films]] in the 1980s. First mentioned in a 1985 [[New York (magazine)|''New York'']] magazine article, it is now usually defined as the cast members of two specific films released in 1985—''[[The Breakfast Club]]'' and ''[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire]]''—although other actors are sometimes included. The "core" members are considered to be [[Emilio Estevez]], [[Anthony Michael Hall]], [[Rob Lowe]], [[Andrew McCarthy]], [[Demi Moore]], [[Judd Nelson]], [[Molly Ringwald]], and [[Ally Sheedy]].

The term "Brat Pack", a play on the [[Rat Pack]] from the 1950s and 1960s, was first popularized in a 1985 ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine cover story, which described a group of highly successful film stars in their early twenties.&lt;ref name="New York"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://nymag.com/movies/features/49902/ | last=Blum |first=David |authorlink=David Blum |date=June 10, 1985|title=Hollywood's Brat Pack |journal=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |volume= |issue= |pages=40–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Blum]] wrote the article after witnessing several young actors (Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe, and Judd Nelson) being mobbed by groupies at Los Angeles' [[Hard Rock Cafe]].&lt;ref name="Mansour"&gt;Mansour, David.

However, an appearance in one or both of the ensemble casts of [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]]' ''The Breakfast Club'' and [[Joel Schumacher]]'s ''St. Elmo's Fire'' is often considered the prerequisite for being a core Brat Pack member.&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;{{cite news |last=Fine |first=Marshall |title=Remember the Brat Pack?

In 1999, McCarthy said he was never a member of the group: "The media made up this sort of tribe. I don't think I've seen any of these people since we finished ''St. Elmo's Fire''."&lt;ref name="People"&gt;Miller, Samantha and Jewel, Dan. [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20127981,00.html "Brat Race"]. ''People''. April 19, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial ''New York'' article covered a group of actors larger, or more inclusive, than the currently understood meaning of the term "Brat Pack". For example, most of the cast members of ''[[The Outsiders (film)|The Outsiders]]'' were mentioned, including [[Tom Cruise]], [[C. Thomas Howell]], [[Matt Dillon]], [[Patrick Swayze]], and [[Ralph Macchio]], none of whom starred in any other 1980s movies with any "core" Brat Packers, besides [[Patrick Swayze]].&lt;ref name="New York" /&gt; [[Charlie Sheen]] appears in several lists&amp;nbsp;– more for his family relationship to Brat Pack leader Emilio Estevez and his partying than for his collaborative film work with other members.&lt;ref name="The Players" /&gt;

[[James Spader]] and [[Robert Downey, Jr.]] have also been considered members, and performed alongside other Brat Packers: both of them with Andrew McCarthy in ''[[Less Than Zero (film)|Less Than Zero]]'';&lt;ref name="Eighties" /&gt; Spader with McCarthy in ''[[Mannequin (1987 film)|Mannequin]]'' and with McCarthy and Molly Ringwald in ''[[Pretty in Pink]]''; and Downey with Anthony Michael Hall (''[[Weird Science (film)|Weird Science]]'' and ''[[Johnny Be Good]]''; and the cast of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'') and with Molly Ringwald (''[[The Pick-up Artist (film)|The Pick-up Artist]]''). Other actors who have been linked with the group include [[Kevin Bacon]], [[Matthew Broderick]], [[Jon Cryer]], [[John Cusack]], [[Jami Gertz]], [[Mary Stuart Masterson]], [[Sean Penn]], [[Kiefer Sutherland]], and [[Lea Thompson]].&lt;ref name="Mansour" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brat Pack" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brat Pack Site" /&gt; In her autobiography, [[Melissa Gilbert]] connects herself with the Brat Pack, as her social life centered on Estevez and Lowe (both of whom she was engaged to). Through frequent collaborative work, the actor [[Harry Dean Stanton]], then in his late 50s, became a mentor for the group of young actors.&lt;ref name="Year of the brat" /&gt;

==Article==
David Blum's ''New York'' story, titled "Hollywood's Brat Pack", ran on June 10, 1985. It was originally supposed to be just about Emilio Estevez, but one night, Estevez invited Blum to hang out with him, Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson, and others at the Hard Rock Cafe. It was a typical night out for the group, who had gotten close while filming ''St. Elmo's Fire''. That night, Blum decided to change the article's focus to an entire group of young actors at the time. The ''St. Elmo's Fire'' crew members did not like Blum and sensed that he was jealous of the actors' success.&lt;ref&gt;Gora, Susannah (2010). ''You Couldn't Ignore Me If You Tried: The Brat Pack, John Hughes, And Their Impact on a Generation''. Three Rivers Press. pp. 106–119.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the piece ran, the actors all felt betrayed, especially Estevez. The article mentioned people in several films but focused on Estevez, Lowe, and Nelson, and portrayed those three negatively. The "Brat Pack" label, which the actors disliked, stuck for years afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://observer.com/1999/08/actor-andrew-mccarthy-is-bitter-about-brat-pack-past/|title=Actor Andrew McCarthy Is Bitter About Brat Pack Past|date=August 30, 1999|website=Observer|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Reason-Judd-Nelson-Hated-Brat-Pack-Label-86667.html|title=The Reason Judd Nelson Hated The Brat Pack Label|date=October 6, 2015|website=Cinemablend.com|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the article ran, they had been regarded as talented individuals; after the article, all of them were grouped together and regarded as unprofessional. Interviewed for Susannah Gora's 2010 book ''You Couldn't Ignore Me If You Tried: The Brat Pack, John Hughes, And Their Impact on a Generation'', Blum admitted that he should not have written the article.&lt;ref&gt;Gora, Susannah (2010). ''You Couldn't Ignore Me If You Tried''. Three Rivers Press. pp. 117–128, 289–291, 336.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the increased negative attention to them, the actors soon stopped socializing with one another. On the group's camaraderie, Ally Sheedy later said, "[The article] just destroyed it. I had felt truly a part of something, and that guy just blew it to pieces."&lt;ref&gt;Gora, Susannah (2010). ''You Couldn't Ignore Me If You Tried''. Three Rivers Press. p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
During the late 1980s, several of the Brat Pack actors had their careers mildly derailed by problems relating to drugs, alcohol, and in Lowe's case, a sex tape.&lt;ref name="People"/&gt; According to Gora, "Many believe they could have gone on to more serious roles if not for that article. They were talented. But they had professional difficulties, personal difficulties after that."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Craig. [https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2010-02-08-bratpack08_ST_N.htm "John Hughes and the Brat Pack, revisited"]. ''usatoday.com''. February 16, 2010. Retrieved 2011-01-24.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 21st century, the term "Brat Pack" had lost its negative connotation.&lt;ref&gt;Gora, Susannah (2010). ''You Couldn't Ignore Me If You Tried''. Three Rivers Press. p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;

The films themselves have been described as representative of "the socially apathetic, cynical, money-possessed and ideologically barren eighties generation."&lt;ref name="Eighties"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eightiesclub.tripod.com/id299.htm |title=13.

They are considered "among the most influential pop cultural contributions of their time."&lt;ref&gt;Gora, Susannah.

The '''coat of arms of the King of Spain''' is the [[heraldic symbol]] representing the monarch of Spain. The current version of the monarch's coat of arms was adopted in 2014 but is of much older origin. The arms marshal the arms of the former monarchs of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castille]], [[Kingdom of León|León]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], and [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]].

Traditionally, coats of arms did not belong to a nation but to the monarch who would quarter his shield with territorial claims of his dynasty. Formerly, the Spanish monarch's arms were much more complex than they are today. It would feature the arms of the various territories of this dynasty. A simpler version of these arms, known as the ''lesser arms'', would also be used; This lesser arms were another set of arms within the centre of the full arms. During the later part of the Bourbon dynasty this would be quarterly Castille and Leon.

In 1868, during the [[Provisional Government (1868-1871)|provisional government]] that followed the overthrow of Queen [[Isabella II]], an arms of ''national character'' was adopted; This 1868 arms created the present-day arrangement of elements in the shield. The "national arms" and "royal arms" would coexist after the restoration of the monarchy. In 1931, the royal arms was revised to incorporate what had been hitherto the "national arms" into the royal arms and to replace the former lesser arms of the King (i.e. quarterly Castille and Leon). The monarchy would later be abolished later that year.

When don Juan Carlos, grandson of Alfonso XIII (the last king of Spain), was chosen to be the successor of General [[Francisco Franco]], the arms adopted for his use in 1971 as Prince of Spain was quarterly Castille, Leon, Aragon, and Navarre. The heraldic achievement also included the collar of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]], the Cross of Burgundy and the yoke and bundle of arrows formerly used by the [[Catholic Monarchs]]; This would be the same arms he would use as King. Upon Felipe VI's ascension to the throne in 2014, the cross, yoke, and arrows would not be retained in the royal arms.

==Blazon==
The [[blazon]]ing of the coat of arms of the King of Spain is set out in Royal Decree 527/2014, 20 June, an amendment to Title II of Spanish Royal Decree 1511/1977 adopting Flags, Standards, Guidons, Insignia and Emblems Regulation.&lt;ref name="BOE527"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2014/06/21/pdfs/BOE-A-2014-6525.pdf |title=Real Decreto 527/2014, de 20 de junio, por el que se crea el Guión y el Estandarte de Su Majestad el Rey Felipe VI y se modifica el Reglamento de Banderas y Estandartes, Guiones, Insignias y Distintivos, aprobado por Real Decreto 1511/1977, de 21 de enero. |date=20 June 2014 |website= BOE Spanish Official Journal|series= |publisher= |location= |page= |pages= |at= |language= Spanish|trans-title=Royal Decree 527/2014 setting up the Guidon and Standard of HM King Felipe VI and amends Standards, Guidons, Insignia and Emblems Regulation, adopted on Royal Decree 1511/1977|accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coat of arms was adopted when King [[Felipe VI of Spain|Felipe VI]] was enthroned as King of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldo.es/noticias/nacional/2014/06/19/felipe_cuenta_con_escudo_guion_propios_294797_305.html |title=Felipe VI ya cuenta con escudo y guión propios |language=Spanish |trans-title=Felipe VI has his own coat of arms and guidon |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= 2014-06-19|website=www.heraldo.es |publisher= |accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shield is divided into four quarters, blazoned as follows:

*1st, [[gules]] a castle [[Or (heraldry)|or]], triple-embattled and voided gate and windows, with three towers each triple-turreted, of the field, masoned [[sable]] and ajoure [[azure (heraldry)|azure]], which is for [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]];
*2nd, [[argent]] a lion [[rampant]] purpure crowned or, langued and armed, of the second, which is for [[Kingdom of León|León]];
*3rd, or, four pallets gules, which is for [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]];
*4th, gules a cross, saltire and orle of chains linked together or, a centre point vert, which is for [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]];

Argent enté en point, with a pomegranate proper seeded gules, supported, sculpted and leafed in two leaves vert, which is for [[Granada]].

Inescutcheon [[azure (heraldry)|azure]] [[bordure]] gules, three [[fleurs-de-lys]] or, which is for [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon-Anjou]].

All surrounded by the collar of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece|Golden Fleece]] and crowned with a crown of the same metal and precious stones, with eight rosettes, five visible, and eight pearls interspersed, closed at the top by eight diadems also adorned with pearls and surmounted by a cross on a globe, which is the royal crown of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casareal.es/sm_rey/armas-iden-idweb.html Coat of arms of His Majesty the King of Spain]. The Royal Household of the King of Spain. Retrieved 19 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, General [[Francisco Franco]] appointed [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos I]] as his "successor to the Headship of the Spanish state with the title of King" but gave him the new title of [[Prince of Spain]] instead of the traditional title of [[Prince of Asturias]]. From 1971 to 1975, Juan Carlos as Prince of Spain used a coat of arms which was virtually identical to the one later adopted when he became King in 1975. Earlier coat of arms differed only that it featured the royal crown of a Crown Prince of Spain, the King's royal crown has eight half-arches of which five are visible, while the Prince's one has only four half-arches of which three are visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.armada.mde.es/ArmadaPortal/page/Portal/ArmadaEspannola/conocenos_historia/03_bandera_armada--14_miscelania--02_insignias_jefes_estado--05_juan_carlos_i_es ''Spanish Decree 814 of 22nd April 1971''].

Since June 2014, Juan Carlos's son, Felipe VI, has been using the same arms but without the cross of Burgundy, yoke and arrows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casareal.es/EN/FamiliaReal/rey/Paginas/rey_armas.aspx |title=Coat of arms of His Majesty King Juan Carlos |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= 2014-06-19|website=Spanish Royal Household Website |publisher= |accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; King Juan Carlos's arms include a red lion instead of the purple one displayed on the current version&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casareal.es/EN/FamiliaReal/ReyFelipe/Paginas/principe_armas.aspx |language= |title= Coat of arms of His Majesty the King|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= 2014-06-19|website=Spanish Royal Household Website |publisher= |accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''deed of change of name''' is a legal document—used in the United Kingdom, Ireland and some other countries with [[legal system]]s based on English [[common law]]—for an official [[name change]] by a person or family. It is one use of a [[deed poll]].

Some organisations, such as government departments issuing passports and driving licences, may not recognise a name change without documentation, such as a deed or [[statutory declaration]]. However, an official document is not a legal requirement for a valid name change&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/overview&lt;/ref&gt; according to common law.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1994/604/note/made&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal procedure==
===United Kingdom===
In [[England and Wales]], such a deed may be registered in the Central Office of the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales|High Court]]. Deeds so registered are advertised in the ''[[London Gazette]]''. A deed of name change on behalf of a minor must be approved by the [[Judiciary of England and Wales|Senior Master]] on behalf of the [[Master of the Rolls]] who will take into account the child's [[best interests]]. A deed poll can also be used to change a child's name, as long as everyone with parental responsibility for the child consents to it&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Change a child’s name|url=https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/change-a-childs-name|website=GOV.UK|accessdate=31 January 2015|quote=To change the name of a child aged under 16 (sometimes called a ‘minor’) you’ll need either: the agreement of everyone with parental responsibility [or] a court order}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the child does not object to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Changing your name|url=http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/england/relationships_e/relationships_birth_certificates_and_changing_your_name_e/changing_your_name.htm|website=AdviceGuide UK|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Registration of deeds is regulated by the ''Enrolment of Deeds (Change of Name) Regulations 1994'', [[Statutory Instrument|SI]] 1994/604&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legislation.data.gov.uk/cy/uksi/1994/604/made/data.htm?wrap=true |title=Enrolment of Deeds (Change of Name) Regulations 1994 |publisher=HM Government|website=legislation.data.gov.uk |date=4 July 2011 |accessdate=10 December 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; (as amended&lt;ref&gt;[https://deedpolloffice.com/change-name/enrolling/enrolment-regulations/1994 Enrolment of Deeds (Change of Name) Regulations 1994 SI 1994/604 (as amended)]&lt;/ref&gt;)
. Compared to some other European countries, for example Germany, a name change in the UK is easy and virtually unrestricted regarding choice.

Registration of a deed of change of name is not a legal requirement in the United Kingdom. A standard legal document, with stock wording, filled in by the person making the deed poll, and signed in presence of a [[witness]], carries sufficient legal [[authority]] to be recognised. The witness need not be a solicitor but can be anyone over the age of 18 independent of the person changing their name.

The procedure, requirements and law surrounding the issue in [[Northern Ireland]] are similar to those in England and Wales.
In England, Northern Ireland and Wales, a deed of change of name will not change the name on a birth certificate. For instance, when applying for a passport, both the certificate and the deed would need to be presented as documents of identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/614120/Guidance_Booklet_March_2017__ILB_44_03.17_.pdf |title=Applying for a Passport |publisher=HM Passport Office |accessdate=18 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Northern Ireland, for children between the ages of two and eighteen years, only one change of forename(s) and one change of surname may be recorded. In Scotland, it is also possible to record a change of name on the original birth register entry at the General Register Office.  However, only one change of forename and three changes of surname are permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files2/registration/rcn1.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614150953/http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files2/registration/rcn1.pdf |archivedate=14 June 2011 |title=Recording changes of forename(s) and surname(s) in Scotland |publisher=General Register Office for Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republic of Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], a deed poll of change of name ({{lang-ga|Athrú Ainm de réir Gníomhais Aonpháirtí}}) is obtainable from the Central Office of the [[Four Courts]], Dublin at a cost of €30. Like in the UK, there are very few restrictions on name changes. One is that foreign nationals must also obtain a change of name license from the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service. One of Ireland's most noted name changers was the politician [[Seán Dublin Bay Rockall Loftus|Seán Loftus]], who repeatedly added middle names referring to his political views so that they would appear on election ballot papers.

==History==
In ''re Parrott, Cox v Parrott'' [1946] Ch 183,&lt;ref&gt;[https://deedpolloffice.com/change-name/law/case-law/Re-Parrott-Cox-v-Parrott-1946-Ch-183 ''Re'' Parrott, Cox ''v'' Parrott &lt;nowiki&gt;[1946]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Ch 183]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harry Vaisey|Mr Justice Vaisey]] stated that he did not believe that a deed poll could be used to change a person's [[Christian name]] (first name) &amp;ndash; that could be done by only an [[Act of Parliament]]. Deeds that change a person's first name can be registered by the applicant in the Enrolment Books of the Senior Courts of England and Wales, which is located within the Royal Courts of Justice on Strand, London, and they are usually endorsed "Notwithstanding the decision of Mr Justice Vaisey in ''re Parrott, Cox v Parrott'', the applicant wishes the enrolment to proceed".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38766">The '''Eight Tigers''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|八|虎}}|p=Bā Hǔ}}), sometimes referred to as the '''Gang of Eight''' (八党/八黨), were a powerful group of [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]]s (宦官) that controlled the Chinese imperial court during the reign of the [[Ming Dynasty]] [[Zhengde Emperor]] (r. 1505-1521 CE).

Led by [[Liu Jin]], the remaining members of the coterie were [[Ma Yongcheng]] (馬永成), [[Gao Feng (Ming Dynasty)|Gao Feng]] (高鳳), [[Luo Xiang (Ming dynasty)|Luo Xiang]] (羅祥), [[Wei Bin]] (魏彬), [[Qiu Ju (Ming dynasty)|Qiu Ju]] (丘聚), [[Gu Dayong]] (谷大用) and [[Zhang Yong (Ming dynasty)|Zhang Yong]] (張永).

== Background ==

=== Eunuchs in China ===
[[Eunuch]]s are [[Castration|castrated]] men who have often been used as servants in imperial and noble households, due to the belief that they would not be distracted by or a danger to women. Eunuchs were often utilized in the imperial household as [[harem]] guards and attendants. The [[Imperial Chinese harem system|harems]] were considered necessary in order to help produce a male heir, and the eunuchs were trusted protectors.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/34515572|title=East Asia : a new history|last=1919-2012.|first=Murphey, Rhoads,|date=1997|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman, Inc|isbn=0673993507|location=New York|oclc=34515572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the Ming Dynasty, eunuchs had long been a powerful political force in China. In the [[Tang dynasty|Tang Dynasty]], from 821 until the dynasty's end, eunuchs were "the real power holders". They controlled the [[Imperial Guards (Tang dynasty)|Imperial Guard]] and the Palace Secretariat, chose seven out of eight emperors, and possibly killed two emperors.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/643762927|title=A history of East Asia : from the origins of civilization to the twenty-first century|last=1956-|first=Holcombe, Charles,|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521515955|location=New York|oclc=643762927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Ming emperor, [[Hongwu Emperor|Hongwu]] (1328-1398), was worried about the power of eunuchs. He erected a tablet that said, "Eunuchs must have nothing to do with administration", and he worked to disempower them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He warned, "Anyone using eunuchs as his eyes and ears will be blind and deaf". Despite these measures, many of emperors who followed Hongwu were more willing to leave ruling to the eunuchs, and the [[Ming dynasty|Ming Dynasty]] became the peak of eunuch influence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By the end of the 15th century, there were 10,000 eunuchs working in the palace.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hucker|first=Charles O.|date=1958|title=Governmental Organization of The Ming Dynasty|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2718619|journal=Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies|volume=21|pages=1–66|doi=10.2307/2718619}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to close access to the emperor and his wives and [[Concubinage|concubines]], they were often trusted with imperial sons. Oftentimes this trust extended to eunuchs being given command as palace guards, military commanders, or imperial inspectors. They controlled the court's luxury workshops and managed the [[Imperial Chinese Tributary System|tributes]] from the provinces and foreign countries, and they were often made the heads of official missions abroad.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This power gave the eunuchs many chances to become rich through [[Graft (politics)|graft]]. They also eventually controlled the [[Eastern Depot|secret police]], which meant they could control the nation through blackmail and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=明清時代の政治と社会|last=小野|first=和子|publisher=京都大学人文科学研究所 中西印刷株式会社|year=1983|isbn=|location=|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Rise to Power of the Eight Tigers ===
[[Zhengde Emperor|Emperor Zhengde]] ascended to the imperial throne in 1505, aged 14, after the death of [[Hongzhi Emperor|his father]].

From the early days of his rule it was clear that the young emperor distrusted government officials and was partial to eunuchs who took an active role in raising him. The emperor's inner circle consisted of 8 eunuchs who served him when he was still heir apparent and became his personal staff shortly after Zhengde began his reign. Shortly after the emperor's ascension to the throne, the Eight Tigers swiftly took control of important positions not only in the imperial court but in the secret service and the army. In addition to this, they appointed their relatives to influential ranks and roles in the dynasty.

One of the eunuchs, [[Liu Jin]], who would emerge as the leader of the group, was put in charge of palace music in early 1506, putting him in position of control over the emperor's entertainment. He excelled in this role, coming up with ideas for pastimes that proved to be much to the emperor's liking.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge History of China, Vol. 7: The Ming Dynasty, 1368-1644, Part 1|last=Mote|first=Frederick|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1988|isbn=0521243327|location=|pages=403–412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several groups within the imperial elites were alarmed with Liu Jin's promotion and the group's apparent influence over the young ruler, and so they began plotting against the Eight Tigers.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Troubled Empire: China in the Yuan and Ming Dynasties|last=Brook|first=Timothy|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780674046023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three [[Grand Secretariat|grand secretaries]], inherited from the emperor's father and supported by the ministers, demanded the group's execution, while senior eunuchs insisted on banishment as a punishment that the Emperor would be more likely to consider. A joint plan was finally agreed upon and set in motion with a direct petition to the emperor, asking for Liu Jin's execution and banishment of the other members of the group from the imperial court.

Liu Jin was notified of the plot by one of his agents and led seven other eunuchs to ask for mercy before Emperor Zhengde on October 27, 1506.

The emperor heeded their plea, and on the following day it was announced that he would decide upon their fate at his leisure. All but one grand secretaries resigned immediately upon hearing the news and a number of senior officials followed suit.

The plot was averted and most checks on the eunuchs' power eliminated with it.

Liu Jin proceeded to retaliate against those who spoke out against him, leading to a string of dismissals, incidents of torture and imprisonments of a number of high government figures.

In February 1507, twenty-one officials who had protested the dismissal of the senior grand secretaries were beaten and reduced to the status of commoners.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

By the end of 1507 very few in the palace were willing to challenge the reign of terror of Liu Jin, who was known to many at the time as "Emperor Liu",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bandits, Eunuchs and the Son of Heaven: Rebellion and the Economy of Violence in Mid-Ming China|last=Robinson|first=David|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=2001|isbn=0824823915|pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his fellow eunuchs.

== Members ==

===Liu Jin 劉瑾 (1451-1510) ===
[[Liu Jin]] was from the area of [[Xingping]], [[Shaanxi]]. He was born on February 28, 1451 into the Tan family. His original name was Tan Jin. He considered himself very eloquent, so he decided to become a eunuch, as he considered that his best path to success. After becoming a eunuch, he was adopted by another eunuch named Liu, and changed his name to Liu Jin.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/649680414|title=Ming dai huan guan|last=Gongyi.|first=Wen,|last2=温功义.|date=2010|publisher=Zi jin cheng chu ban she|isbn=9787800479236|edition=Di 1 ban|location=Beijing Shi|oclc=649680414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He began working in the imperial palace in the 1480s, where he began to consolidate the group that later became the Eight Tigers.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; In 1492, he was removed from his post at the [[Chenghua Emperor|Chenghua emperor]]'s tomb to serve the new heir apparent, the future Zhengde emperor. Liu became a favorite of his, and he became the head of the bureau of bells and drums after Zhengde's rise to the throne in 1505. From there, Liu Jin gradually gained more power and influence, and became known as the leader of the Eight Tigers.

Most Ming and modern historians regard Liu Jin's rise to power as tyrannic and describe him as "rapacious, cruel, and wily".&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Robinson, David M. ''Banditry and Rebellion in the Capital Region during the Mid-Ming (1450-1525)''. Dissertation, Princeton University, 1995. UMI, 9528935.&lt;/ref&gt; He became the Head of the [[Ming dynasty#Bureaus and offices for the imperial household|Directorate of Ceremonies]], in which role he was notorious for altering rescripts in transit to and from the emperor. This meant he essentially controlled what the emperor knew and what the emperor approved.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Tong, James W. ''Collective Violence in a Premodern Society: Rebellions and Banditry in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644)''. Dissertation, University of Michigan, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he became the chief of the imperial staff, and became known for taking bribes from senior officials.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; For example, he required the thirteen provincial administration officials to pay him 20,000 [[tael]]s of silver when they visited the capital, three times a year.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; He also was very influential in the military. At the height of his power, all military actions had to be approved by him, giving him more power than the generals.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

After the re-establishment of the Western Depot under Gu Dayong, Liu Jin convinced the emperor to create the ''Neixinchang'', or Inner Branch Depot, which would supervise direct dangers to the throne and the emperor's safety. This Depot was made supervisor to the other two, the East and West Depots, thus consolidating Liu Jin's power. The depot persecuted many of the opponents to Liu Jin and his policies. It is estimated that more than one thousand people were killed by the Inner Branch Depot.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

From the money he gained through corruption, he went on to flaunt his glory and wealth by building a palace in his hometown.

During the fall of his reign, officials were sent to detain him and confiscate his belongings. During the house search, the officials found a total of 12,057,800 taels of gold and 259,583,600 taels of silver, as well as gems, false seals, and fans with concealed knives, ostensibly for use in his plot against the emperor.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; He was ordered to be executed by the punishment of [[Lingchi|death by a thousand cuts]]. He was cut 3,357 times over a period of three days.

=== Zhang Yong 張永情 (1470-1532) ===
Zhang Yong, a native of Xincheng, [[Baoding]], is fairly absent in historical records until his time in the Eight Tigers. During Emperor Zhengde's reign, he took control of many important posts and developed a tight bond between him and the Emperor. By doing this, he began to disregard the government's policies and plans. For instance, despite heavy opposition from the [[Ministry of Revenue (imperial China)|Ministry of Revenue]], he successfully acquired some privatised land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=三田村 |first1=泰助 |title=東洋史論叢 : 三田村博士古稀記念 |date=1980 |publisher=立命館大学人文学会 |location=京都}}&lt;/ref&gt; He controlled the [[Eastern Depot]], one of the secret police and intelligence operations that reported to the emperor. He also was given control of the Shen-Chi garrison, which had been established to practice with firearms.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crawford|first=Robert B.|date=1961|title=Eunuch Power in the Ming Dynasty|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4527509|journal=T'oung Pao|volume=49|issue=3|pages=115–148}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1510, Zhang Yong was appointed Supreme Commander of the military and sent to put down the [[Prince of Anhua rebellion|Prince of Anhua's rebellion]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

During Liu Jin's reign, Zhang Yong was his right-hand in the battlefield and at home. He did not get along with Liu Jin, but could not be removed from power due to his military prowess. He conspired with [[Yang Yiqing]] to remove Liu Jin from power,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; and became the most powerful member of the remaining Eight Tiger's after Liu Jin's death.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In October 1511, he asked the emperor to allow him to select 6,000 troops from the Capital Garrison reserves to be specially trained as assault forces for times of crisis. The emperor approved the request due to his need to fight the rebel forces of Liu the Sixth.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In July 1514, Zhang Yong was put in charge of an operation to defend against [[Mongols|Mongol]] invasion.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

However, after Emperor Zhengde's death, his status fell to that of a regular eunuch,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=w1PsYGwQdesC&amp;pg=PP2&amp;lpg=PP2&amp;dq=29+chinese+mysteries+roy+bates&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=63JU_yUuSB&amp;sig=1-KWfC_lGzU8RJyzlzQ9klZZh64&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjo1LD0qezbAhVHQN4KHSyMCq8Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=29%20chinese%20mysteries%20roy%20bates&amp;f=false|title=29 Chinese Mysteries|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9780557006199|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was ordered to retire by the new emperor, [[Jiajing Emperor|Jiajing.]]&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; However, by 1529 he had begun to regain some power, and was made the Grand Secretary of Integrated Divisions. He died shortly after this appointment.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Gao Feng 高鳳 (died 1526) ===
After the fall of Liu Jin, Gao Feng was made one of the new heads of the Directorate of Ceremonies,&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; along with Wei Bin.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Besides this, information on Gao Feng is limited.

=== Ma Yongcheng 馬永成 (1468-1526) ===
Ma Yongcheng was from the [[Bazhou, Hebei|Bazhou]] or [[Wen'an County|Wenan]] area. He grew rich off of the [[Banditry|bandit]] situation, accepting bribes from them so they could gain favor with the emperor.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Ma Yongcheng took control of the Eastern Depot, which operated as a spy and secret police agency during the Ming dynasty.

=== Gu Dayong 谷大用 ===
Gu Dayong is known for his place at the head of the Western Depot, a secret-police style intelligence agency. Emperor Zhengde reopened it in 1506&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; after 25 years of dormancy, with Gu Dayong as its leader, due to his desire to have a more comprehensive intelligence agency. The Western Depot was closed down after Liu Jin's arrest, although Emperor Zhengde still considered Gu Dayong quite favorably.

In August 1511, Gu Dayong was appointed overall superintendent of military affairs, and he led a group of troops south of the capital to fight the rebel forces of the Liu brothers.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; As a reward for defeating the rebellion, his younger and older brothers became earls.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Members of his family assumed important positions and roles inside the dynasty. For instance, Gu Dayong's father was given the right to command the [[Embroidered Uniform Guard]] alongside Zhang Young's father.

He also worked in charitable construction projects in [[Peking]]. In 1508, he donated a large bell to the [[Taoism|Daoist]] [[White Cloud Temple|Baiyunguan]] (White Cloud Temple), which had built a new hall. In 1510 and 1512, he restored the Southern Park's Lingtongmiao, the Yanfasi outside of the city's western gate, and the Huguosi (so that it could house Central Asian monks). He used donations from the emperor and the imperial family to carry out these projects, which seem to have been authorized and requested by the emperor. Gu Dayong also seems to have chosen at least one of his one projects, restoring an old temple in the far [[Western Hills]], turning it into "a bright and glittering precinct".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41368371|title=Peking : temples and city life, 1400-1900|last=Susan.|first=Naquin,|date=2000|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520219910|location=Berkeley|oclc=41368371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of the Zhengde Emperor, he was temporarily honored, before being banished to [[Nanjing|Nanking]], where he died.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Qiu Ju 丘聚 ===
He was in charge of the Eastern Depot, but lost his job after the arrest of Liu Jin. He does not have any of his own records, but is only mentioned sometimes in biographies of the other Eight Tigers.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Besides this, information on Qiu Ju is limited.

=== Wei Bin 魏彬 ===
Wei Bin was given command of the ''san qian ying'' (三千營) garrison, which was made of 3,000 [[Barbarian#China|barbarians]] who had surrendered to the throne.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Wei Bin is also known for building the Hongshangshi. He used divination to find a suitable burial place in Peking's southern suburbs, and built Hongshangshi there in 1514. The land was officially endowed by the emperor, and the temple became known as Sir Wei's Temple. It was famous for its [[Crab Apple|crab-apple]] orchards and other unusual trees.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; After Liu Jin's execution, Wei Bin was made one of the heads of the Directorate of Ceremonial,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; along with Gao Feng.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Wei Bin was made to retire upon the ascension of the Jiajing Emperor.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Luo Xiang 羅祥 ===
There is almost no available information on Luo Xiang, although it is known that he was a member of the Eight Tigers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Ming/personsbahu.html|title=The Eight Tigers 八虎 (www.chinaknowledge.de)|last=Theobald|first=Ulrich|website=www.chinaknowledge.de|language=en|access-date=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political Influence ==

=== The Zhengde Emperor ===
[[File:明武宗.jpg|thumb|The Zhengde Emperor, also known as Emperor Wuzong]]
At the beginning of the Zhengde Emperor's reign, Liu Jin and seven other eunuchs who had served him were added to his personal staff. He ignored the advice of his grand secretaries, who told him to limit the roles of his eunuchs in government. Having been raised by eunuchs, he liked them, and, starting in 1506, he gave them important financial and military roles. He enjoyed spending time with them, practicing riding, archery, wrestling, and music.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Geiss, J. (1988). The Cheng-te reign, 1506–1521. In F. Mote &amp; D. Twitchett (Eds.), ''The Cambridge History of China'' (The Cambridge History of China, pp. 403-439). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. doi:10.1017/CHOL9780521243322.009&lt;/ref&gt; Liu Jin was responsible for palace entertainment, and "provided dancing, wrestling matches, a menagerie of exotic animals, and of course music". He also encouraged the Zhengde Emperor to leave the palace in disguise to explore the streets of [[Peking]], which the emperor grew to love. He was thus disinterested in ruling his own government, so he began to leave matters of state solely to his eunuchs.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Since he didn't want to deal with manners of state, he left most of the empire's affairs to the eunuchs. For instance, he needed money to implement various imperial projects, but did not want to use his personal funds, so he listened to and implemented the ideas of the Eight Tigers, which mostly meant raising new taxes.

Although Zhengde spent all his money and time on palace entertainments, the Eight Tigers never criticized him and always obeyed his wishes, which caused him to trust them greatly. One example of this is when, in 1516, he decided he wanted to leave the imperial palace and move to [[Xuanhua District|Xuanhua]] for a more entertaining life. Since his grand secretaries and many other officials opposed this, he was prevented from doing so. On September 8, 1517, he attempted the move again, instructing Gu Dayong not to let anyone else follow him past the [[Juyong Pass|Juyong pass]] on the way to Xuanhua. Due to Gu Dayong's dutiful execution of this order, the other government officials could do nothing but wait until the emperor got bored with his new life and returned to Peking in 1518.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Zhengde's trust in his eunuchs transcended many attempts to remove the Eight Tigers from power. He gave them [[dragon robe]]s to wear, which symbolized that they were immune to charges for any crimes they might have committed.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; The only real challenge to this trust manifested in the arrest of Liu Jin, who had always been his favorite, and was accomplished only with the help of all the other Eight Tigers.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Policies and Reforms ===
'''Government Control'''

After the failed 1506 petition to remove the Eight Tigers from power, Liu Jin began removing anyone opposed to him from power. In March 1507, he issued an edict that made he and the other Eight Tigers equal in rank and authority to the highest provincial officials, as well as the right to investigate any administrative or judicial matter. All official documents had to be approved by him first before they could be sent to the ministries or grand secretariat. He also broke custom by sentencing officials to punishment by [[cangue]] for minor offenses, namely not acknowledging his authority, which had previously never been used on officials, and only for serious crimes. Liu Jin had control of the imperial administration in both the capital and the provinces by the summer of 1507.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; 
[[File:Dragon robe - Taiping Kingdom History Museum.jpg|thumb|The dragon robe which the Zhengde emperor gifted to the Eight Tigers to wear, even though it had traditionally been a privilege reserved only for royalty&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;]]
The eunuchs were able to expand their roles within the palace to control the rest of the government structure. Many of these positions became available for the Eight Tigers after the governmental purge after the 1506 petition. For instance, the eunuch Director of Ceremonial usually controlled the Western or Eastern Depots, as well as the [[Embroidered Uniform Guard|Embroidered-Uniform guard]], who "exercised almost unlimited police and governmental authority", with a greatly feared prison.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

The Depots, which were intelligence and terror organizations, were run by the Eight Tigers. Qiu Ju ran the [[Eastern Depot]], Gu Dayong ran the Western Depot, and Liu Jin ran the Inner Branch Depot. Many suspects, including Imperial Ministers, censors, soldiers, and civilians, were arrested, beaten heavily, and sometimes killed. The Inner Branch Depot's embroidered-uniform guards conducted much of the beating and torture. Those arrested number in the several thousands.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The Western and Inner Branch Depots were shut down after Liu Jin's arrest for extortion, although the emperor remained fond of Gu Dayong and contemplated reopening the Western Depot. There was too much backlash, however, and it remained closed.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; The Eastern Depot, on the other hand, remained operational for the next few years, under different directors, until its disbandment after Emperor Zhengde's death.

When he was in power, Liu Jin managed to drastically change government structure in the favor of him and his fellow eunuchs, but he was aiming for much more that was never realized. He wanted to create an empire where eunuchs were the superiors of every official in every branch of government, a scale which would have been unprecedented in Chinese history. Most of his radical reforms to this end are not known, because they were rigorously opposed by the civil officials and so were never implemented.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

'''Financial'''

In 1506, Liu Jin was given the task of raising revenue for the emperor. He claimed that the decline in revenues was due to mismanagement and corruption, and decided to run a general investigation and fine the ineffective officials.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Liu Jin implemented many new taxes and worked against corruption and ineffectiveness of government officials. He also became known for accepting large bribes.

For example, in June 1508, Liu ordered grain inventory inspections. He dispatched secretaries and censors around China to see how much fodder and hay had been purchased, as well as if it had been changed for silver or remained in storage in the warehouses. He also targeted abuses by the local elites, punishing ineffectual officials with jail time or heavy fines paid in grain, which was then shipped to the north and west.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In [[Fujian|Fukien]] and [[Sichuan|Szechwan]], Liu Jin added a [[surtax]] on silver mines, event though the officials had reported that there was no more silver in them. Since he gave heavy fines to officials who displeased him, many began to pay him bribes to avoid those fines.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Liu Jin also implemented surveys of the military agricultural colonies, which is what eventually led to the [[Prince of Anhua rebellion]] in 1510.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Resistance to the Eight Tigers ===
'''Early Opposition'''

Censor Jiang Qin objected to Liu Jin driving important officials out of office. Calling Liu Jin "a minor servant", he questioned why the emperor should trust Liu Jin so fully when everyone else hated and feared him. He also stated he would give his head if it meant removing Liu Jin from power. For these statements, Jiang Qin was given 30 lashes and imprisoned. Three days later, he again urged Zhengde to execute Liu Jin, but he was beaten again. Finally, after a final flogging, he died.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

After Liu Jin was appointed the head of the imperial household in June 1506, the grand secretaries were alarmed. They questioned the action but were ignored.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==== Han Wen's 1506 Petition ====
The first real plan to remove Liu Jin from power came from other, senior eunuchs who felt threatened by his influence. They wanted him either banished to [[Nanjing|Nanking]] or executed. On October 27, 1506, Han Wen, the minister of revenue, submitted a petition to the emperor, requesting that he execute the Eight Tigers. The emperor was unwilling to consider this. Minister of personal Hsu Chin warned that the emperor would not change his mind on so drastic a request, but the grand secretaries were resolute, and convinced the senior eunuchs to get the emperor to sign the petition. The court officials agreed to ask the emperor to carry out the sentence on the morning of October 28.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

However, one of Liu Chin's agents in the court told him about the plan. On the night of October 27, the Eight Tigers begged the emperor for mercy. Liu Jin told the emperor that it was all a conspiracy and that the eunuch Director of Ceremonial was cooperating with the grand secretaries to limit the emperor's power. The emperor believed Liu Jin, and removed the conspirators from their posts, designating Liu Jin as Director of Ceremonial. The rest of the Eight Tigers took over several other important eunuch agency and military positions. The deposed senior eunuchs were banished to Nanking, but were assassinated en route.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

On October 28, 1506, the morning the court had agreed would be the end of the Eight Tigers, the officials realized that something was strange when they were all summoned to the morning audience. A senior official announced that the emperor had decided he would decide what to do about the Eight Tigers by himself. Almost all the grand secretaries then resigned, realizing the battle was lost, and Liu Jin accepted the resignations personally.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Liu Jin went on to consolidate his control and exact revenge over those who had opposed him. He framed Han Wen for fraud, and dismissed him on December 13, 1506. In February 1507, the twenty-one senior officials who had protested the removal of the grand secretaries were beaten and given commoner status. From then on, officials who opposed Liu Jin were beaten, tortured, and dismissed.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==== 1508 Anonymous Letter ====
On July 23, 1508, a group of eunuchs submitted an anonymous letter to the emperor about Liu Jin's crimes. Liu Jin thought it must have been written by an official, and began investigating them, arresting all the palace officials. He released them once he discovered a eunuch had written the letter, and then he established a security agency to investigate them. He banished the eunuchs involved to Nanking.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==== The Prince of Anhua Rebellion====
Liu Jin raised the tax rate in [[Shaanxi]], and he had tax delinquents arrested and beaten.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This angered the soldiers in the province. The local prince, [[Prince Anhua]], was already angry about the power of the eunuchs. He believed that they gained their positions through persuasiveness, not through any real helpfulness to the empire.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Therefore, Prince Anhua decided to take the opportunity to rebel. On May 12, 1510, he held a banquet, then had the soldiers come in and kill the officials, officers, and eunuchs in attendance. He then announced he was raising an army to defeat Liu Jin. However, the rebellion only lasted 19 days before he was betrayed by one of his own cavalry commanders. Zhang Yong and [[Yang Yiqing]], who had been dispatched to defeat the rebellion, arrived to escort the prince back to the capital for his execution.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==== Internal Opposition to Liu Jin ====
Liu Jin was not on good terms with Zhang Yong, who could not be removed from his post like Liu Jin's other enemies due to his military prowess. Liu Jin considered himself the dictator of the rest of the Eight Tigers, and often delegated the work he did not want to do to them.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; This attitude caused the rest of the Eight Tigers to resent him as well.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This rift led to the eventual toppling of Liu Jin.

== Fall from Power ==

=== Liu Jin ===
By 1510 the relations between Liu Jin and Zhang Yong have significantly deteriorated. As an inspector of the army Zhang Yong was sent to [[Shaanxi]] to oversee the suppression of the [[Prince of Anhua rebellion]] by the imperial forces. His companion during the travels was [[Yang Yiqing]], the supreme commander of the army, who was once forced out of office by Liu Jin in 1507 and held a grudge against him. Yang Yiquing managed to convince the eunuch that Liu Jin was planning an operation that would put Zhang Yong's life in danger.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He claimed that Liu Jin was planning to assassinate the emperor and put his own grand-nephew on the throne, and that the plan would begin on September 17, 1510.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

On September 13, the emperor held a banquet with the Eight Tigers, and Liu Jin left first. Zhang Yong told the emperor about Liu Jiu's plan, and he and the rest of the Eight Tigers convinced him to send guards to arrest Liu Jin and confiscate his property. The emperor decided he was guilty when he saw Liu Jin's hordes of wealth.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

At his trial, Liu Jin at first tried his normal tactics of controlling those who defied him. He appealed to the people who he claimed he had helped over the years, saying they owed him. When an imperial consort asked why he had so much armor hidden away if not to attack the emperor, he stopped speaking. The emperor was convinced, and Liu Jin was sentenced to [[Lingchi|death by a thousand cuts]]. The execution began on September 27 and lasted for 3 days. His property was taken and used to prop up the emperor's finances.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== After Liu Jin ===
The execution of Liu Jin, which took place in 1510, greatly diminished the ability of the group to influence emperor's decisions. The system built by Liu Jin that bestowed significant authority upon the eunuchs was swiftly dismantled by the government officials after his death.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, the Zhengde emperor continued to entrust the remaining members of the Eight Tigers with authority. He still needed financial security, so he gave the eunuchs the power to take whatever supplies and labor they needed from civil officials,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; in order to make their jobs easier. He appointed Wei Bin and Gao Feng as the new Directors of Ceremonial, and had the rest continue to run the garrisons and surveillance agencies.

After the death of the Zhengde emperor, many of the Eight Tigers were banished.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

== Legacy ==
[[Confucianism|Confucian]] scholars viewed the eunuchs as usurpers, as they rose to power independent of the [[Imperial examination|examination system]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Additionally, the imperial censors, who sometimes criticized powerful eunuchs directly to the emperor, viewed the defeat of Liu Jin as a victory for the strength of China's empire. In 1624, [[Censorate|censor]] Yang Lien implored the emperor to impeach eunuch [[Wei Zhongxian]] in a letter which said that eunuchs must be kept from interfering in anything outside palace life. He mentioned Liu Jin: "Even such arrogant and lawless eunuchs as [[Wang Zhen (eunuch)|Wang Zhen]] and Liu Jin were promptly executed. Thus the dynasty lasted until today".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the histories, written by the Confucian scholars, eunuchs, including the Eight Tigers and especially Liu Jin, are portrayed negatively. Liu Jin is blamed for the outbreak of rebellions at the end of Emperor Zhengde's reign. In the earliest complete narrative of the 1510 rebellion, "Rebellion Quelled at Jianghuai", written in 1513, Wang Ao argued that Liu Jin was responsible for the rebellion, writing, "In the early Zhengde reign, the traitorous eunuch unlawfully seized the power of the sovereign. By [his] cruel punishments and tyranny, [he] poisoned all within the seas. All within the seas was confused and in upheaval. [When] the traitorous eunuch was executed, the masses of bandits/rebels arose". In Jianghai jianqu ji, Zhu Yunming asserted that Liu Jin's abuses pushed the empire to rebellion.

One Ming historian who portrays Liu Jin in a more positive light is Liao Xinyi in "A Brief Study of Liu Jin's 'Change of Established Regulations", in which he argues that the grain inventory inspections were motivated more by the need to supplement the grain of the northern and western borders than by a desire by Liu Jin to extract bribes or revenge.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In the ''Veritable Records of Wuzong'', Liu Jin is again described in a very negative way. There seems to be disagreement on his relation to the rebellions, for while it is agreed that he sometimes worked tirelessly to stop banditry, it is also sometimes claimed that he was personally linked to the bandits and supported them in their rebellions. It is true that rebellions rose along with Liu Jin's fall, but the relationship between those events is unclear.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Nishimura Gensho, the leading Japanese scholar of the 1510 rebellion, attributes the rebellion to the weakness of Emperor Zhengde as his court was overrun by scheming eunuchs. He claims that the extensive intelligence network run by the eunuchs caused the empire to fall into a period of panic, and that the imperial estates uprooted peasants from their land and livelihoods, lending more support to the rebellion.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== The Powerful Eunuch ===
The dragon cloaks worn by the emperor's chosen Eight Tigers came to symbolize great power, which was desirable to young men trying to make a career. The Eight Tigers convinced many young boys and men to become castrated, as they believed that was the path towards a successful life.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

Overall, the Eight Tigers add credence to the many stories told in the classical Chinese histories and in modern scholarship about how much power eunuchs had in imperial China. In a book of classical Chinese tales, the Eight Tigers and their infamy are mentioned several times. A few examples: Liu Jin, as head of the Inner Branch Depot, was powerful enough to demand that officials kneel before him and to order flogging punishments, sometimes until death. The Inner Branch Depot is infamous for arresting people numbering in the several thousands. It also mentions the Eastern Depot, calling it an "imperial terror establishment" and "[[Gestapo]]-like organization".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== References in Culture ==

=== Classical Culture ===
Liu Jin is featured in several plays and novels.

Hang Kai, who was instrumental in Lin Jiu's removal from power, wrote many plays featuring Liu Jin, as they were both from [[Xinping Yi and Dai Autonomous County|Xinping]].

However, the most famous play with Liu Jin, Famensi ([[Famen Temple]]) became popular during the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Dynasty]], its earliest known record in 1845. This classic [[Peking opera|Peking Opera]] included the lines, "My last name is Liu, my first name is Jin… At age seven, I was castrated and entered the imperial palace two years later… I helped Emperor Zhengde ascend the throne". In the play, Liu Jin is a painted-face role (xiahualian), whose face is painted red to indicate Liu Jin's "rough characteristics and compelling power".

Famen Temple tells the story of a famous murder case. The murderers got away, and an innocent man was falsely accused, by Liu Jin ordered the court to be reviewed, which led to the punishment of the perpetrators. Throughout the play, he is decisive, but his decisions are backed up or checked by the [[Empress Zhang (Hongzhi)|Empress Dowager]]. The play thus portrays Liu Jin in a relatively positive light. Famen Temple is a famous classic opera, and was a favorite of [[Empress Dowager Cixi]]. It has a famous video recording from 1950 and a few famous audio recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/china/beijing-english/20170803/281560880882015|title=PressReader.com - Connecting People Through News|website=www.pressreader.com|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least two novels written in the [[Qing dynasty]] feature Liu Jin in a treacherous plot. In ''Bajian qixia wuyi pingmen qianhou zhuan'' and ''Sanmenjie'', Liu Jin lures the emperor from the capital's safety to [[Suzhou]], promising him beautiful women and scenery. Using his connections with three bandit chiefs, who have an army of ten-thousand men based in [[Qingzhou]], [[Shandong]], Liu Jin has the imperial entourage attacked. The emperor is saved by the bravery of a set of fraternal twins.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

'''Jack of the President of the Republic of Poland – Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland''' ({{lang-pl|proporzec Prezydenta Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej – Zwierzchnika Sił Zbrojnych Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej}}) is a [[Maritime flag#Jacks|jack flag]] used in the [[Polish Armed Forces]] to mark the presence and pay respect to the [[President of the Republic of Poland]] who is also ''ex officio'' the [[commander-in-chief]] of the Armed Forces. The jack is raised on [[Polish Navy]] ships when the president is officially on board, as well as on land, if the president is present. The design of the jack is based directly on the [[History of Poland (1918–1939)|pre-war]] [[Banner of Poland|Banner of the Republic of Poland]] which used to be part of presidential insignia.

The jack of the President is defined in the Ordinance of the Minister of National Defense on the Use of Insignia of the Armed Forces of January 26, 1996 with subsequent amendments. The ordinance defines the jack of the President as "a piece of red cloth with the image of the state eagle (i.e. the White Eagle from the [[Coat of Arms of Poland|national coat of arms]]) in the middle, bordered with a ''wężyk generalski''", an ornate wavy line used in the Polish military as a symbol of [[generał|general's]] rank. The [[Hoist (flag)|hoist]] to [[Flag terminology#Description of standard flag parts and terms|fly]] ratio is 5:6. The proportion of the eagle's height to the fly is 3:5.&lt;ref name=ordinance&gt;{{pl icon}} ''Zarządzenie Ministra Obrony Narodowej z dnia 29 stycznia 1996 r. w sprawie szczegółowych zasad używania znaków Sił Zbrojnych Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej oraz ustalenia innych znaków używanych w Siłach Zbrojnych Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej'' ([http://www.abc.com.pl/serwis/mp/1996/0178.htm M.P.96.14.178] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015219/http://www.abc.com.pl/serwis/mp/1996/0178.htm |date=2007-09-30 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==

The presidential jack is used in military ceremonies attended by the commander-in-chief. Celebrations of the Constitution Day, May 3; Polish Armed Forces Day, August 15; and Independence Day, November 11 (see [[Public holidays in Poland]]) are typical occasions. For example, during the grand military parade on August 15, 2007 in [[Warsaw]], President [[Lech Kaczyński]] rode in a convertible jeep preceded by a mounted [[Polish cavalry|cavalry]] officer carrying the presidential jack,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

while a smaller jack was attached to the president's jeep as a car flag. The jack also draped the coffins of President Kaczyński (see [[Death and state funeral of Lech Kaczyński and Maria Kaczyńska]]) and former President-in-exile [[Ryszard Kaczorowski]] after both died in the [[2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash|Smolensk air crash]] of 2010.

[[File:Banner of Poland.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Banner of the Republic on display in the [[Royal Castle in Warsaw]]]]

{{Main article|Banner of Poland}}

A state banner was used in Poland as insignia of the head of state (king, president, etc.) as early as the 11th century CE. Although its design changed with time, it was always a heraldic banner, i.e. one based directly on the national coat of arms: a crowned White Eagle in a red field. In 1919, the [[Sejm]] (lower house of parliament) established the [[Banner of the Republic of Poland]], reserved for use by the head of state &amp;ndash; the State Leader (''[[Naczelnik Państwa]]'') and, later, President of the Republic. In 1927, it was modified to reflect the adoption of a new official rendering of the national coat of arms. At this point the banner was virtually identical to the current design for the presidential jack.&lt;ref name=znamier&gt;{{cite book

After the [[Second World War]], the Banner of the Republic was still used by [[Polish government-in-exile|presidents-in-exile]] while a variant with a crownless eagle was used by Communist authorities at home. Officially abandoned in 1955, the banner continued to be used in practice by the [[Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland|prime minister]] and, during the 1960s, by the [[Polish Council of State|Council of State]], a collective head of state of the time.&lt;ref name=znamier/&gt;

The modern Jack of the President of the Republic of Poland was established by the Minister of National Defense on January 29, 1996 with the sole purpose of flying it on Polish Navy ships while the commander-in-chief is on board.&lt;ref name=ordinance/&gt; On December 14, 2005, the use of the presidential jack was extended to all branches of Polish Armed Forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} ''Zarządzenie Ministra Obrony Narodowej z dnia 14 grudnia 2005 r. zmieniające zarządzenie w sprawie szczegółowych zasad używania znaków Sił Zbrojnych Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej oraz ustalenia innych znaków używanych w Siłach Zbrojnych Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej'' ([http://www.abc.com.pl/serwis/mp/2005/1165.htm M.P.05.82.1165] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033325/http://www.abc.com.pl/serwis/mp/2005/1165.htm |date=2007-09-30 }})&lt;/ref&gt; It was first flown on land during a Constitution Day ceremony at the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw]] on May 3, 2005.

'''Keibu keioiba''' is a mythological or fictional character based on [[Meitei people|Meetei]] folklore. It is a creature having half tiger and half human features, depicted to be transformed from a learned ancient Manipuri physician. He was experimenting his magical skills and powers, and came up with this idea of turning himself into a powerful man with strength of a tiger. He became this creature with the head, limbs and strength of a tiger but failed to remember how to revert to his normal human form, owing to low memory or thinking capacity of a tiger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e-pao.net/epSubPageExtractor.asp?src=manipur.Folks.Folk_Tales.Keibu_Keioiba_By_Nganthoi_Lourembam |title=Keibu Keioiba – Fungawari Singbul |publisher=E-Pao|author=B. Jayantakumar Sharma }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The tale==
This is a story of a kind, dedicated and skilled ancient Manipuri physician, who used to ride on a horse and visit places to heal the suffering ailments. As his knowledge and skill kept on increasing day by day, he kept on wanting to learn more and more. At a time, he was able to do whatever he wanted. He kept on conducting experiments until he decided to turn himself into a tiger one day, for he wanted the power of a tiger.

He taught his wife how to help him turn into a tiger and how to return to his human form. But, as soon as he became the tiger-like creature/ keibu keioiba, he developed the tiger-instinct of roaring and frightening people. So, his wife ran away from him before he could be subjected to return to his human form. Instead, he even tried to kill his wife and ran away in the wild far from home.
When he got hungry, he would come to human villages to steal poultry or fish or livestock, as he never learned how to hunt like a real tiger in the wild. He became the feared and the hated. He began to target humans for food.

He came to a village and took a young girl called Thabaton, who was home alone, left by her seven brothers for work. He was avenged by the brothers and the girl was saved.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e-pao.net/epSubPageExtractor.asp?src=manipur.Folks.Taming_Keibu_Keioiba |title=Taming 'Keibu Keioiba': Translation as Recovery |publisher=E-Pao|author=Sumitra Thoidingjam }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Morale==
The story depicts the never-ending desire of man for getting more which ultimately ruins himself. It teaches a lesson to us about the evil effects of this human nature. We can witness many examples of this today- e.g., global warming because of the never-ending industrial race, world devastation by never ending arms race in world wars, etc.

==Impacts in Manipur or Meetei society==
Almost every Manipuri grow up listening to this folktale from their elders. It is a common story told to kids over many generations.

==Movie/s==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Keibu keioiba movie.jpg|thumb|Keibu keioiba, tigerhead film poster.]] --&gt;
A 2-D Manipuri animated film, titled as "keibu keioiba", has been made, directed by Bhumenjoy konsam, released in 2009, based on the original folktale. The movie has increased awareness of the story to the selfie-generation kids of present Manipur as well as to other communities.&lt;ref&gt;keibu keioiba / tigerhead&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 November 2013 [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] from the [[National Crime Agency#Organisational Structure|Human Trafficking Unit]] arrested two suspects at a residential address in [[Lambeth]], [[South London]]. A 73-year-old ethnic Indian [[Singaporean]] man, Aravindan Balakrishnan, and a 67-year-old [[Tanzanian]]&lt;ref name = "growing up"/&gt; woman, his wife, Chanda Pattni, had been investigated for [[slavery]] and [[domestic servitude]].&lt;ref name="Halliday"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Standard"/&gt; The case centred around the [[Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought]] commune which was led by Balakrishnan. In the early 1980s after a police raid, Balakrishnan decided to move the group's activities underground. Balakrishnan's control over his followers intensified and the commune became a prison to his followers.  On 25 October 2013, three women were rescued from the commune. These were: a 69-year-old [[Malaysians in the United Kingdom|Malaysian]] woman (later revealed to be Aishah Wahab),&lt;ref name="Sawer"/&gt; a 57-year-old [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] woman (Josephine Herivel) and a 30-year-old [[United Kingdom|British]] woman (Katy Morgan-Davies).&lt;ref name="Standard"&gt;{{cite news |title=Women victims 'held for 30 years' |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/panewsfeeds/women-victims-held-for-30-years-8954976.html |publisher=London Evening Standard |date=21 November 2013 |accessdate=21 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Katy Morgan-Davies was born into the sect and hadn't experienced the outside world until her release.

'''Aravindan Balakrishnan''' (known to his followers as "'''Comrade Bala'''") was born in [[Kerala]], [[India]] but migrated to  [[Singapore]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], where his father was a soldier, when he was 10.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ward|first1=Victoria|title=Aravindan Balakrishnan: the Maoist cult leader who used brutal violence and rape to strip women of their dignity|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/12031312/Aravindan-Balakrishnan-the-Maoist-cult-leader-who-used-brutal-violence-and-rape-to-strip-women-of-their-dignity.html|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balakrishnan was a student at [[Raffles Institution]] and later the [[University of Singapore]], where although gaining a reputation as a "quiet chap",&lt;ref name="Reuters-AO"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Reuters|title=UK Maoist cult leader raped followers, enslaved daughter|url=http://www.asiaone.com/world/uk-maoist-cult-leader-raped-followers-enslaved-daughter|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=AsiaOne|date=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; he became increasingly politically active and believed that he would have been imprisoned in Singapore had he openly admitted to being a [[communist]].&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; In 1977, while living in London, His Singaporean citizenship – which he gained in 1960 – was revoked due to his leadership of the [[Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought]], which the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] accused of engaging in "activities which are prejudicial to the security" of Singapore, and denounced him as a radical "closely associated with [[Eurocommunists]]".&lt;ref name="Reuters-AO" /&gt; The authorities claimed that Balakrishnan and others, many of them former Singaporean students he had associated with in London, were plotting to overthrow Singapore's leader, [[Lee Kuan Yew]].&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt;

Despite believing the United Kingdom to be a [[fascist state]] due to its treatment of the people of Singapore during the [[Malayan Emergency]], Balakrishnan emigrated to the UK in 1963 on a [[British Council]] scholarship to study at the [[London School of Economics]], and married his wife Chandra in 1971.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; Over the years he built up a following by giving lectures and staging various [[sit-in]]s and protests. He was a regular attendee at [[London]] demonstrations, where he waved banners depicting the Chinese leader [[Mao Zedong]] and addressed the crowds.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt;

In 1974, Balakrishnan and his "small clique" were expelled from the [[Communist Party of England (Marxist–Leninist)]] on account of "their pursuance of conspiratorial and [[wikt:splittist|splittist]] activities ... spreading [[social fascist]] slanders against the Party and the proletarian movement" and attempting "to put themselves above the discipline of the Party".&lt;ref name="CPE(M-L) statement"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.hightide/cpestatements.htm "Statements of the National Executive Committee, CPE (ML)"], ''The Marxist-Leninist'', 1:1, September 1974, reprinted at marxists.org.

Between 1974 and 1976, his followers attempted to "build revolutionary stable base areas in working-class communities",&lt;ref name="On Building a"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Workers’ Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought|title=On Building a Revolutionary Stable Base Area|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.hightide/stable-base.htm|work=Encyclopedia of Anti-Revisionism On-Line|year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily [[South London]], and worked in ordinary jobs. Balakrishnan discouraged his followers from joining [[trade unions]], describing them as agents of the "imperialist fascist bourgeoisie".&lt;ref name="Smith-Conv"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Evan|title=Inside the paranoid Maoist cults of 1970s Britain|url=http://theconversation.com/inside-the-paranoid-maoist-cults-of-1970s-britain-20739|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=The Conversation|date=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, after the more liberal members of his group drifted away, a cult of around 10 female members formed around him. The collective moved to Brixton in 1976, under the title [[Workers Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought]].&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; Following [[Mao Zedong#Death and aftermath|Mao's death in 1976]], the Institute built the Mao Zedong Memorial Centre at 140 Acre Lane, [[Brixton]], which also functioned as a communist collective of "thirteen comrades", with "13 members living on the premises, half in paid work, six doing full-time revolutionary work, with a strong emphasis on women taking a leading role (apart from leading the Party Committee headed by Bala)".&lt;ref name="On Building a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith-Conv" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=High Tide: The Consolidation of Maoism by the Late 1970’s|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.hightide/|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=Encyclopedia of Anti-Revisionism On-Line}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members were handed a rota of chores and only allowed to go out in pairs, which Balakrishnan claimed was because the area they lived in was "notorious for violence" and "anything could happen".&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ward|first1=Victoria|title=Maoist 'cult' leader denies rape as he claims female commune members competed for his affections|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/12019410/Maoist-cult-leader-denies-rape-as-he-claims-female-commune-members-competed-for-his-affections.html|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=Telegraph|date=26 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a police raid on the Memorial Centre in March 1978, which the group claimed  involved "over 200 police", including officers from the [[Special Patrol Group]], "under the pretext of searching for drugs", the Workers' Institute effectively went underground, with the remaining members being convinced to end all contact with others and maintain an intense level of secrecy.&lt;ref name="Smith-Conv" /&gt; Family members were later branded fascist agents and ostracised,&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; and Balakrishnan and his captives moved to a number of properties during this time as a means for him to escape detection from the authorities.&lt;ref name="Smith-Conv" /&gt; Balakrishnan convinced his followers that everything was controlled by him from the sun, the moon, wind and fires; that he could overthrow governments, control natural disasters, and make people live or die.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; In order to progress his cause, Balakrishnan invented "JACKIE" (an acronym for [[Jehovah]], [[Allah]], [[Christ]], [[Krishna]] and [[Eknath Easwaran|Immortal Easwaran]]) – a type of dangerous, mystical machine that monitored all thought and could control minds.&lt;ref name="Cooke"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cooke|first1=Rachel|title=My 30 years as prisoner of a London cult|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/22/katy-morgan-davies-interview-balakrishnan-cult-brixton-survivor|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=The Guardian|date=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Balakrishnan began sexually abusing two of the women in 1979, often physically beating them and making others watch as he did so. All of the women were beaten and four (not including his wife) were said to have been sexually assaulted or engaged with sexual relations with him.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; Balakrishnan forced the women to swallow his ejaculate as it was "the elixir of life", and claimed the women he sexually abused had been trying to seduce him out of "jealousy" for his lover.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele2" /&gt;

==Victims==
*[[Katy Morgan-Davies]] - born in 1983, she was originally named Prem Maopinduzi Davies. She began calling herself "Rosie" in her teens. She has subsequently changed her name to Katy Morgan-Davies, after the American singer [[Katy Perry]]. She is the biological daughter of Balakrishnan and Sian Davies.&lt;ref name = "growing up"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-b0af7ef5-1031-4e1f-a3ac-b3c21ef0f932|title=Growing up a prisoner in a cult|date=26 January 2017|accessdate=28 January 2017|author=Vanessa Engle|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan-Davies was brought up entirely isolated from the outside world and never went to a nursery, school, dentist or doctor. She was not told who her parents were. The commune members taught her to read and write.&lt;ref name=bbc2&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-b0af7ef5-1031-4e1f-a3ac-b3c21ef0f932&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Sian Davies]] - in the early 1980s, after joining the commune, she had a sexual relationship with Balakrishnan.  On Christmas Eve 1996, Morgan-Davies remembered seeing Davies bound and gagged on the living room for trying to escape. Later, she fell out of a top floor bathroom window and was taken to hospital. In hospital she suffered a rapid decline in her mental health and fell into a coma. She died eight months later.  After the fall, her family were told she had gone to India to do charity work.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} At the time of Davie's death her daughter, Morgan-Davies, did not know she was her mother.

*[[Aishah Wahab]] - a [[Malaysians|Malaysian]] woman who moved to the United Kingdom at the age of 24 to study, joining the group shortly after.&lt;ref name = "growing up"/&gt; Aishah was reportedly so drawn in by Balakrishnan's Marxist rhetoric that she left her fiancé and moved in with the collective.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

*[[Oh Kar Eng]] - nurse from [[Malaysia]] who had followed Balakrishnan from the 1970s. She hit her head on a cupboard in 2001 and suffered a stroke. No medical treatment was allowed by the commune and she died the next day.{{r|bbc}} The police were not informed of the accident. Her family were not told about her cremation, and they were told the commune did not have their ashes when in fact they were in a lockup garage in West Norwood.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

*[[Josephine Herivel]] - known as Josie, was a violinist studying at the [[Royal College of Music]] before she joined the group.&lt;ref name = "growing up"/&gt; Her father, [[John Herivel]] was one of the [[Bletchley Park]] [[codebreakers]] who helped Britain and its allies win [[World War II]]. She is believed to have moved to London in the 1970s and disowned her family after becoming involved with the Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Herivel initiated the escape plan after becoming concerned with Morgan-Davies rapid weight loss (which was due to undiagnosed diabetes). Medical treatment was not permitted by the commune. Herivel secretly phoned a helpline after memorizing the number from a television program. Herivel has denounced the Balakrishnan sentencing, claiming he has been framed by the state.{{r|bbc}}

'''Liath Luachra''', the "'''Gray of Luachair'''", is the name of two characters in the [[Fenian Cycle]] of [[Irish mythology]]. Both appear in ''[[The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn]]'', which details the young life and adventures of the hero [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]].

The first Liath Luachra is one of Fionn's foster mothers who raise him after the death of his father [[Cumhal]] at the hands of [[Goll mac Morna]]. She is a great warrior and a companion of Fionn's aunt, the druidess [[Bodhmall]]; together they raise the boy in secret in the forest of [[Slieve Bloom Mountains|Sliabh Bladhma]]. Eventually Fionn's ever-spreading fame threatens to bring his father's killers to him, and his caretakers send him to find his own way. By this point they have taught him enough that he can survive on his own, and he goes into the king of [[Bantry]]'s service.

The second Liath Luachra is a tall, hideous warrior and a member of the [[Fianna]]. He had been an enemy of Cumhal, and even dealt him the first blow in the battle at which he died. Later Goll mac Morna gave him possession of Cumhal's treasures, and made him the Fianna's official treasurer. His ''corrbolg'' or ''crane bag'' is one of the warrior band's great treasures. Eventually he kills a young warrior named Glonda; Fionn sees the man's mother crying blood over the murder and decides to avenge him. He kills Liath easily and takes his treasure from him. This Liath has a son, [[Conán mac Lia]], who becomes lord of Luchair and a marauder against Fionn and the Fianna. He is eventually reconciled with the group and joins them.

'''Miquela Sousa''', better known as '''Lil Miquela''', is a fictional character created by [[Yung Skeeter|Trevor McFedries]] and Sara Decou as a digital art project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/brud.fyi/|title=Brud (@brud.fyi) • Instagram photos and videos|website=www.instagram.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Billboard"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/international/7964899/virtual-instagram-miquela-controversy-interview|title=Virtual It-Singer Miquela Says 'Controversy Doesn't Mean Anything': Interview|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Highsnobiety"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gorsler|first1=Fabian|title=Meet Lil Miquela: Fashion’s First Virtual Instagram Influencer|url=https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/lil-miquela-virtual-influencer-instagram/?format=amp|website=Highsnobiety|accessdate=1 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HYPEBEAST"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rouse|first1=Isaac|title=Miquela Sousa Is Fashion's First Computer Generated Influencer|url=https://hypebeast.com/2018/2/miquela-sousa-first-computer-generated-fashion-influencer?amp=1|website=HYPEBEAST|accessdate=1 April 2018|language=en|date=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FN"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McDonald|first1=Samantha|title=This Instagram Influencer Is Not Even Human|url=http://footwearnews.com/2018/influencers/technology/miquela-sousa-instagram-virtual-influencer-491637/amp/|website=FN|accessdate=1 April 2018|language=en|date=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miquela is an [[Instagram]] model and music artist claiming to be from [[Downey, California]].

The project began in 2016 as an [[Instagram]] profile. By April 2018, the account had amassed more than a million followers by portraying the lifestyle of an Instagram it-girl over social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/lilmiquela-instagram_uk_57c94056e4b085cf1ecdc0af|title=Instagram's Latest 'It' Model Is Confusing The Hell Out Of Everyone|date=2016-09-02|newspaper=The Huffington Post|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The account also details a fictional narrative which presents Miquela as a sentient robot in conflict with other digital projects created by McFedries and Decou.

In August 2017, Miquela released her first single, "Not Mine".&lt;ref name="billboard.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7898117/miquela-virtual-singer-instagram-not-mine-song-stream|title=Virtual Singer &amp; Internet Star Miquela Shares Debut Single 'Not Mine'|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her pivot into a music has been compared to virtual musicians [[Gorillaz]] and [[Hatsune Miku]].&lt;ref name="Billboard"/&gt;

==Origins==
Miquela’s first Instagram post was made on April 22, 2016. The project garnered both intrigue and criticism for the character's digital appearance with fans and online commenters oscillating between positing that Miquela is an art project or a social experiment carried out by a real unidentified woman. Miquela was rumored to be a marketing gimmick for ''[[The Sims]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} British model Emily Bador was rumored to be Miquela, fans citing the character's abundance of freckles. Bador openly acknowledged the physical similarity.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Online presence==
Miquela has been pictured with a number of celebrities including [[Diplo]], [[How to Dress Well]], killerandasweetthang founder Eileen Kelly, [[Molly Soda]], [[Nile Rogers]], and [[Samantha Urbani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/lilmiquela/|title=*~ MIQUELA ~* (@lilmiquela) • Instagram photos and videos|website=www.instagram.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been interviewed and or profiled in a number of publications including Refinery29, Vogue, Buzzfeed, v-files, Nylon, the Guardian, Business of Fashion, The Cut, and BBC.com.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} As well as by Shane Dawson, YouTube celebrity, in a [https://youtube.com/watch?v=NdNYAiU-SLI phone interview]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=shane|title=CONSPIRACY THEORIES &amp; INTERVIEW WITH LIL MIQUELA|date=2017-09-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdNYAiU-SLI|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;. She appeared on the cover of High Snobiety in April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/lil-miquela-cover-story-issue-16/|title=Meet Lil Miquela, the AI Influencer on the Cover of Our New Print Issue|website=High Snobiety|language=en|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, Miquela did an Instagram takeover for Prada as part of Milan Fashion Week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/prada-instagram-gifs-lil-miquela|title=Prada Launches Instagram GIFs With Help From a Fictional It Girl|work=Vogue|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online narratives===
In April 2018, a trans-media story began to play out on Miquela's Instagram involving [https://www.instagram.com/blawko22 @Blawko22], and [https://www.instagram.com/bermudaisbae/ @BermudaIsBae], two other virtual Instagram accounts who are presented as "sentient robots." The story suggests that two organizations are responsible for the creation of these sentient robots. In the narrative, fictional brand Brud created Miquela and "Blawko22" while competing fictional brand Cain Intelligence created "BermudaIsBae".

On April 17, all of Miquela's Instagram posts were removed. "BermudaIsBae" was purported to have hacked Miquela's account. The two online personas then began posting pictures together as Miquela worked to reclaim the original account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BhuruzXHetm/?taken-by=bermudaisbae|title=Bermuda on Instagram: "More emotional than I thought it would be. Despite it all, there’s only three of us out there and we need to stick together. We talked it…"|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After reclaiming the account, Miquela posted a series of notes saying that she is a robot and claiming sentience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BkjEPEuFdp0/?taken-by=lilmiquela|title=Lil Miquela on Instagram: "So I pull up to the trail and there she is. No rattlesnakes. No hiking. Just a robot sitting on the curb in skinny jeans and wedges.  She said it’s the only way she could get my attention since I haven’t answered her texts since we went to the mall a couple weeks back.  She just wanted to hang out.  So here we are 'hanging out.'"|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BjvhTbylRcD/?taken-by=lilmiquela|title=Lil Miquela on Instagram: "So, Brud programmed my memories, claiming I’m from a place called Downey.  It’s right in-between Los Angeles and Disneyland.  Even though that sounds like a dream to me, I had to come check it out for myself..."|website=Instagram|accessdate=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music career==
Miquela has released several singles since her debut with "Not Mine," including "You Should be Alone," "Over You," and a collaboration with [[Baauer]] titled "Hate Me." Her musical style is characterized by the use of [[auto-tune]] and [[trap music|trap]]-influenced production. Her music has been released on [[YouTube]] and [[Spotify]]. Miquela's sound is purportedly based off of the soundtrack to Sam Raimi's 1981 cult classic, [[Evil Dead]].

These mythological monarchs supposedly ruled Fib, the reigns of these monarchs are mostly legendary and begin in the 7th century BCE with king Fib. The reigns of these monarchs are attributed to the Pictish chronicles, written in the 10th century during the reign of King Kenneth II of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://anthonyadolph.co.uk/the-pictish-king-list/|title=Pictish King List|website=anthonyadolph.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For later monarchs see [[List of Pictish kings|List of Pictish Kings]]. Fib became a puppet state after the reign of the only true king Fib, it was a sub-kingdom from the 7th century BCE until the 9th Century CE (691 BCE - 837/843 CE) when Pictland was united under Kenneth MacAlpin, the last king to rule Pictland before Kenneth was Drest X thus making him the last king of the Fib puppet-state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kjhskj75z.talktalk.net/pictish.html|title=THE PICTISH CHRONICLE|website=www.kjhskj75z.talktalk.net|access-date=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15524">The entries in this tabulation cover some 150 years in the 17th and 18th centuries, when the private residents of [[Covent Garden]] included many people of rank and note. They ranged from [[Peerages in the United Kingdom|marquesses to barons]], foreign ambassadors and members of parliament to physicians, surgeons, antiquaries, artists, authors and dramatists. Some of the later arrivals were auctioneers, such as Christopher Cock and [[Abraham Langford]], who found rich sources for future sales amongst their neighbours.

[[Saint]] '''Lupus of Sens''' (or '''Saint Loup de Sens''') (born c. 573; died c. 623)&lt;ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3D0UAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA716#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Sens |first=Georges |last=Goyau |editor1-last=Herberman |editor1-first=Charles G.|encyclopedia=[[Catholic Encyclopedia|The Catholic Encyclopedia]] |others=Volume 13: Revelation–Simon Stock |publisher=The Encyclopedia Press |location=New York |year=1913 |page=716|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an early French [[bishop of Sens]].

He was the son of Betton, Count of Tonnerre, "[[Blessed Betto]]," a member of the [[royal house]] of the [[Kingdom of Burgundy]].&lt;ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia"/&gt;

==Church in Saint-Loup-de-Naud==

The [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church dedicated to Saint Loup at [[Saint-Loup-de-Naud|Naud]], 8&amp;nbsp;km from [[Provins]] in Champagne in the east of France is distinguished by the outstanding sculptures in the porch of its great doorway, with an ambitious [[iconography|iconographic program]] in which Saint Loup mediates entry into the mystery of the [[Trinity]]. About 980, Sevinus, [[archbishop of Sens]], made a gift to the [[Benedictine order|Benedictine community]] of the [[abbey of Saint-Pierre-le-Vif]] at Sens of four altars ''in villa que dicitus Naudus, in honore sancti lupi consecratum''&amp;mdash;"in the demesne that is called Naud, consecrated in honor of Saint Loup"&amp;mdash;betokening the presence of a shrine already on this site, a priory under the direction of the abbot of Saint-Pierre-le-Vif. Other documents mention [[Saint-Loup-de-Naud]] among the possessions of the abbey at Sens, seat of an archbishop with close political ties to the French Crown, who had Paris within his diocese. Thus, though it lay so close to Provins, a seat of the [[counts of Champagne]] and the abbey church was completed by Henri le Libéral, comte de Champagne, the priory at Saint-Loup-de-Naud looked to Sens for its patronage: a visit from the abbot is documented in 1120. In 1160/61 Hugues de Toucy, Archbishop of Sens, presented to the priory the relic of Saint Loup, brought from the abbey of Sainte-Colombe, to that community's dismay;&lt;ref&gt;William W. Kibler, ed., ''Medieval France: an encyclopedia'', ''s.v.'' "Saint-Loup-de-Naud".&lt;/ref&gt; the sculpted ''portail'' with an iconography comparable to the royal portal at [[Chartres]]&lt;ref&gt;Clark Maines, ''The Western Portals at Saint-Loup-de-Naud'', (New York: Garland) 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; was doubtless undertaken shortly thereafter, when [[pilgrimage]]s brought wealth to the community.

The priory was laid waste by the English in 1432, during the [[Hundred Years' War]] and again by the [[Huguenots]] in 1567, during the [[French Wars of Religion]].

==Other saints Lupus/Loup==

Numerous communes of France are named Saint-Loup;&lt;ref&gt;For a full list of French places with this name, see [[Saint-Loup (disambiguation)|Saint-Loup]]. There is also a Saint-Loup in [[Namur (city)|Namur]], Belgium, and another in Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt; they commemorate several venerable early saints with the Latinized Germanic name of ''Lupus'' ("wolf"): besides Saint Loup de Sens, venerated in [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]], [[Île-de-France]] and [[Picardy]] there are [[Lupus of Troyes|Saint Loup de Troyes]], Saint Loup de [[Bayeux]], one of the early Bishops of Bayeux; and—more locally venerated—Saint Loup de [[Limoges]], Saint Loup de [[Soissons]], and Saint Loup de [[Châlons-en-Champagne]]. A number of the communes called Saint-Loup in the west of France are not easily connected with a specific Saint Loup.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10188">[[File:Magnes the shepherd.jpg|thumb|Illustration of Magnes the shepherd from a 19th-century text]]
'''Magnes the shepherd''', sometimes described as '''Magnes the shepherd boy''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Daily Herald|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/44791889/|page=23|title=Compasses Invented by Chinese|date=November 6, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a mythological figure, possibly based on a real person, who was cited by [[Pliny the Elder]] (23 CE – 79 CE) as discovering [[Natural remanent magnetization|natural magnetism]]. His name, "Magnes", the Latin word for ''[[magnetite]]'', has been attributed as the origin of the Latin [[Root (linguistics)|root]] that has passed into English, giving its speakers the words ''[[magnet]]'', ''[[magnetism]]'', the mentioned ore, and related formulations. Other authorities have attributed the word origin to other sources.

As set out in Pliny's ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'' ("Natural History"), an early [[encyclopedia]] published c. 77&amp;nbsp;CE – c. 79&amp;nbsp;CE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roos|first=Anna Marie|title=The Correspondence of Dr. Martin Lister (1639–1712). Volume One: 1662–1677|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aByoBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87|year=2015|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|location=Leiden, Netherlands|isbn=978-90-04-26332-1|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as translated from the Latin in [[Robert Jacobus Forbes]]' ''Studies in Ancient Technology'', Pliny wrote the following (attributing the source of his information, in turn, to [[Nicander|Nicander of Colophon]]):&lt;ref name ="Forbes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Forbes|first=Robert Jacobus|title=Studies in Ancient Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LbA3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA179|volume=IX|year=1964|publisher=E. J. Brill|location=Leiden, Netherlands|page=179|oclc=180355272}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nicander is our authority that it [magnetite ore] was called Magnes from the man who first discovered it on Mount Ida{{Cref2|note 1}} and he is said to have found it when the nails of his shoes and the ferrule of his staff adhered to it, as he was pasturing his herds.&lt;ref name ="Forbes" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The passage appears at Book XXXVI of ''Naturalis Historia'', covering "The Natural History of Stones", at chapter 25 entitled "The Magnet: Three Remedies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pliny the Elder|translator=John Bostock|translator2=H. T. Riley|title=The Natural History of Pliny|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9zwZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA355|volume=VI|year=1857|publisher=H. G. Bohn|page=355|chapter=The Magnet: Three Remedies|location=London|oclc=615995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Pliny's description is often cited, the story of Magnes the shepherd is postulated by physicist Gillian Turner to be much older, dating from approximately 900 BCE.&lt;ref name="Turner"&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Gillian|title=North Pole, South Pole: The Epic Quest to Solve the Great Mystery of Earth’s Magnetism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UfCC0lAtU_0C&amp;pg=PA6|year=2011|publisher=Awa Press|location=Wellington, NZ|isbn=978-1-61519-132-1|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Any writings Nicander may have made on the subject have since been [[Lost work|lost]].&lt;ref name="Colophon2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicander of Colophon|title=Poems and Poetical Fragments|editors=Translated by A.S.F.

Written in approximately 600 CE, book XVI of ''[[Etymologiae]]'' by [[Isidore of Seville]] tells the same story as Pliny, but places Magnes in India.&lt;ref name="Etymologiae"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Etymologies of Isidore of Seville|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ep502syZv8C&amp;pg=PA319|date=2006|orig-year=source text c. 600 CE|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-45616-6|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is repeated in [[Vincent of Beauvais]]' ''Miroir du Monde'' (c. 1250 CE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Monthly literary register|title=The Monthly magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N2kEAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA571|year=1833|publisher=Charles Tilt|location=London|page=571}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Thomas Nicols' 1652 work, ''Lapidary, or, the History of Pretious Stones'', wherein he describes Magnes as a "shepherd of India, who was wont to keep his flocks about those mountains in India, where there was an abundance of [[lodestone]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicols|first=Thomas|title=Lapidary, or, the History of Pretious Stones: With Cautions for the Undeceiving of All Those that Deal with Pretious Stones|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=udBEAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA196|year=1652|publisher=Thomas Buck|location=Cambridge|page=196|oclc=12968778}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following from Pliny's account, the shepherd's name has been often cited as giving rise to the Latin [[Root (linguistics)|root word]] and etymological source of the English word for magnet and the coterie of its related word forms such as ''magnetite'', ''magnet'', ''magnetism'', ''[[magnesium]]'', ''[[manganese]]'' and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weicker|first=Theodore|title=Merck Report: A Practical Journal of Pharmacy, Materia Medica, and Chemistry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hkI1AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA289|volume=X|year=1901|publisher=Merck &amp; Company|location=New York|page=289|chapter=The Myth of Pliny|oclc=243874912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authorities, including the Roman poet and philosopher [[Lucretius]] ([[circa|c.]] 99&amp;nbsp;BCE – c. 55&amp;nbsp;BCE), have attributed the [[etymology]] of ''magnet'', and progeny, to the name of the [[Lydians|Lydian]] city, [[Magnesia ad Sipylum]] ([[Manisa|Manisa, Turkey]] in modern times), where magnetic ore may have first been discovered or recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deer|first=William Alexander|title=Rock-forming Minerals: Non-silicates|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ASjwAAAAMAAJ|year=1962|publisher=Longmans|location=London|page=69|oclc=174165277}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allom|first1=Thomas|last2=Walsh|first2=Robert |title=Constantinople and the scenery of the seven churches of Asia Minor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dh5fAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA8-IA6|year=1839|publisher=Fisher, son, &amp; Co|location=London|page=10|oclc=332119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other ancient locations have been attributed as the origin, including the Greek province Thracian Magnesia, and the [[Ionia]]n city of [[Magnesia on the Maeander|Magnesia ad Maeandrum]].&lt;ref name="Senning"&gt;{{cite book|last=Senning|first=Alexander|title=Elsevier's Dictionary of Chemoetymology: The Whys and Whences of Chemical Nomenclature and Terminology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fl4sdCYrq3cC&amp;pg=PA240|date=2006|publisher=Elsevier|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-0-08-048881-3|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that the legend of Magnes the shepherd could be the origin of ''magnet'', et al., and the legend itself has been criticized. Pliny's story is characterized in Gillian Turner's book ''North Pole, South Pole: The Epic Quest to Solve the Great Mystery of Earth’s Magnetism'' (2011) as "no doubt embellished by centuries of retelling."&lt;ref name="Turner" /&gt; In the 1896 treatise ''Coil and Current; or the Triumphs of Electricity'', the authors write: &lt;blockquote&gt;'Magnet' is derived from the legend of Magnes, or from the territory of Magnesia. Pliny states that Magnes, the shepherd, discovered it, and the legend told of him is that while carrying a message over Mount Ida he felt his feet clinging to the earth, to the iron ore which lay thickly upon the hill. Hence the name of the Magnet. But Magnesia was a territory whence this native iron was for hundreds of years exported, and the name "Magnet" is, no doubt, due to this place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frith|first1=Henry|author2=W.

[[Image:Le Voyage dans la lune.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Man in the Moon is struck by a spacecraft in the 1902 fantasy film ''[[Le Voyage dans la Lune]]'']]
The '''Man in the Moon''' refers to any of several [[Pareidolia|pareidolic images]] of a human face, head or body that certain traditions recognize in the disc of the [[full moon]]. The images are composed of the dark areas of the [[Lunar mare|lunar ''maria'']], or "seas" and the lighter highlands of the lunar surface.

==Origin==
[[File:Man In The Moon2.png|thumb|right|200px|Possible interpretations of the Man in the Moon]]
There are various explanations for how the Man in the Moon came to be.

A longstanding European tradition holds that the man was banished to the moon for some crime. Christian lore commonly held that he is the man caught gathering sticks on the Sabbath and sentenced by God to death by stoning in the book of Numbers XV.32-36.&lt;ref&gt;Harley, the Rev. Timothy, FRAS (1885). ''[http://www.sacred-texts.com/astro/ml/ml00.htm Moon Lore]'', London; Swan Sonnenschein, Le Bas &amp; Lowry. p.21. Archived at [[Internet Sacred Text Archive]]. Retrieved March 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Germanic cultures thought he was a man caught stealing from a neighbor's hedgerow to repair his own.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} There is a Roman legend that he is a sheep-thief.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

One medieval Christian tradition claims him to be [[Cain]], the Wanderer, forever doomed to circle the Earth. [[Dante]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy#Inferno|Inferno]]''&lt;ref name="Inferno126"&gt;[[Dante]], [[The Divine Comedy]], [[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]], canto 20, [http://dante.dartmouth.edu/search_view.php?query=&amp;cmd=Search&amp;commentary%5B%5D=0&amp;language=any&amp;cantica=1&amp;canto=20&amp;line=126 line 126] and [http://dante.dartmouth.edu/search_view.php?query=&amp;cmd=Search&amp;commentary%5B%5D=0&amp;language=any&amp;cantica=1&amp;canto=20&amp;line=127 127]. The Dante Dartmouth Project contains the original text and centuries of commentary.&lt;/ref&gt; alludes to this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
For now doth Cain with fork of thorns confine
On either hemisphere, touching the wave
Beneath the towers of [[Seville]]. Yesternight
The moon was round.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is mentioned again in his ''[[The Divine Comedy#Paradiso|Paradise]]'':&lt;ref name="Paradise"&gt;Dante, The Divine Comedy, Paradiso, canto 2, [http://dante.dartmouth.edu/search_view.php?query=&amp;cmd=Search&amp;commentary%5B%5D=0&amp;language=any&amp;cantica=3&amp;canto=2&amp;line=51 line 51].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
But tell, I [[pray thee]], whence the gloomy spots
Upon this body, which below on earth
Give rise to talk of Cain in fabling quaint?&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is also a [[Talmud]]ic tradition that the image of [[Jacob]] is engraved on the moon,&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson, Elliot R. "The Face of Jacob in the Moon" in ''The Seductiveness of Jewish Myth: Challenge or Response?'' edited by S. Daniel Breslauer, Albany NY; SUNY Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; although no such mention appears in the [[Torah]].&lt;ref&gt;Harley, the Rev. Timothy, FRAS (1885). ''Moon Lore'', London; Swan Sonnenschein, Le Bas &amp; Lowry. P.21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harley, Timothy (1885). [http://www.sacred-texts.com/astro/ml/ml06.htm "II. THE MAN IN THE MOON."] [[Internet Sacred Text Archive]]. Retrieved March 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Lyly]] says in the prologue to his ''[[Endymion (play)|Endymion]]'' (1591), ''"There liveth none under the sunne, that knows what to make of the man in the moone."''&lt;ref&gt;Child, Clarence Griffin (1894). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=fmAvAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA118 John Lyly and Euphuism]''. Erlangen [etc.]: A. Deichert. p. 118. {{OCLC|1014813258}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Norse mythology]], [[Máni]] is the male personification of the moon who crosses the sky in a horse-drawn carriage. He is continually pursued by the Great Wolf [[Hati Hróðvitnisson|Hati]] who catches him at [[Ragnarök]]. ''Máni'' simply means "Moon".

In [[Chinese mythology]], the goddess [[Chang'e]] is stranded upon the moon after foolishly consuming a double dose of an [[elixir of life|immortality potion]]. In some versions of the myth she is accompanied by Yu Tu, a [[moon rabbit]].&lt;ref&gt;Xueting Christine Ni (2018). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ck9UDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA40 From Kuan Yin to Chairman Mao: The Essential Guide to Chinese Deities]''. Red Wheel/Weiser. pp. 40–43. {{ISBN|1578636256}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Haida mythology]], the figure represents a boy gathering sticks. The boy's father had told him the moon's light would brighten the night, allowing the chore to be completed. Not wanting to gather sticks, the boy complained and ridiculed the moon. As punishment for his disrespect, the boy was taken from Earth and trapped on the moon.&lt;ref&gt;(1899). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=S8U4AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA704 Report of the 68th Meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science 1898]''. 1899. London: Murray. p. 704.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nosracines.ca/e/page.aspx?id=605508 ''The Hydah mission, Queen Charlotte's Islands''] Charles Harrison, [[Church Missionary Society]] c. 1884{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions==
There is a traditional belief that the Man in the Moon enjoyed drinking, especially claret. An old [[ballad]] runs (original spelling):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Our man in the moon drinks clarret,
With powder-beef, turnep, and carret.
If he doth so, why should not you
Drink until the sky looks blew?&lt;ref&gt;''The Man in the Moon drinks Claret'', as it was sung at the Court in Holy-well. ''Bagford Ballads'', ''Folio Collection'' in the [[British Museum]], vol. ii. No. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the English Middle Ages and renaissance, the moon was held to be the god of drunkards, and at least three London taverns were named "The Man in the Moone".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Poole |first=William |contribution=Introduction |title=The Man in the Moone |year=2009 |editor-last=Poole |editor-first=William |pages=13–62 |publisher=Broadview |isbn=978-1-55111-896-3}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The man in the moon is named in an early dated English [[nursery rhyme]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
The man in the moon came tumbling down
And asked his way to [[Norwich]];
He went by the south and burnt his mouth
With supping cold pease porridge.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Examples and occurrence globally==
One tradition sees a figure of a man carrying a wide burden on his back. He is sometimes seen as accompanied by a small dog.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Ben (2010). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=MYasNyKQIxMC&amp;pg=PA143 Foothold in the Heavens: The Seventies]''. Springer Science &amp; Business Media. p. 143. {{ISBN|1441963421}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Various cultures recognise other examples of [[lunar pareidolia]], such as the [[Moon rabbit]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Terri Windling|Windling, Terri]]. "[https://www.webcitation.org/67AkEBAkB?url=http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/rrRabbits.html The Symbolism of Rabbits and Hares]" Retrieved September 1, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Northern Hemisphere, a common Western perception of the face has it that the figure's eyes are [[Mare Imbrium]] and [[Mare Serenitatis]], its nose is [[Sinus Aestuum]], and its open mouth is [[Mare Nubium]] and [[Mare Cognitum]].&lt;ref&gt;Skilling, Tom (January 20, 2017). "[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/weather/ct-wea-0121-asktom-20170120-column.html Ask Tom: What creates the 'man in the moon'? ]". ''Chicago Tribune''. Retrieved September 1, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; This particular human face can also be seen in tropical regions on both sides of the [[equator]]. However, the moon orientation associated with the face is observed less frequently—and eventually not at all—as one moves toward the [[South Pole]].

Conventionalized illustrations of the Man in the Moon seen in Western art often show a very simple face in the full moon, or a human profile in the crescent moon, corresponding to no actual markings.

"The Man in the Moon" can also refer to a mythological character said to live on or in the moon, but who is not necessarily represented by the markings on the face of the moon. An example is [[Yue-Laou]], from [[China|Chinese]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Xueting Christine Ni (2018). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ck9UDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA141 From Kuan Yin to Chairman Mao: The Essential Guide to Chinese Deities]''. Red Wheel/Weiser. p. 141. {{ISBN|1578636256}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Man in the Moone]], by [[Francis Godwin]] is one of the earliest novels thought of as containing several traits prototypical of [[science fiction]].

==Scientific explanation==
The Man in the Moon is made up of various lunar maria (which ones depend on the pareidolic image seen). These vast, flat spots on the Moon are called "maria" or "seas" because, for a long time, astronomers believed they were large bodies of water. They are large areas formed by lava that covered up old craters and then cooled, becoming smooth, [[basalt]] rock.&lt;ref&gt;Harrington, Philip S., and Edward Pascuzzi (1994). ''Astronomy for All Ages: Discovering the Universe through Activities for Children and Adults''. Old Saybrook, CT: Globe Pequot.&lt;/ref&gt;

The near side of the Moon, containing these maria that make up the man, is always facing Earth. This is due to a [[tidal locking]] or synchronous orbit. Thought to have occurred because of the gravitational forces partially caused by the Moon's oblong shape, its rotation has slowed to the point where it rotates exactly once on each trip around the Earth. This causes the near side of the Moon to always turn its face toward Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.caltech.edu/content/looking-man-moon | title=Looking at the Man in the Moon | website=www.caltech.edu | publisher=[[California Institute of Technology]] | accessdate=July 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1226">The '''Masters of Dirc van Delf''' were a group of [[illuminated manuscript|manuscript painters]] active in the [[Netherlands]] between 1400 and around 1410. The name has been appended to several unknown artists who together make up an important [[studio]] of illuminators, one of the first important ones known from fifteenth-century Holland. Their name is derived from the lavish work they did to illustrate devotional texts by [[Dirc van Delf]], court chaplain to [[Albert I, Duke of Bavaria|Albrecht of Bavaria]] from 1389 until 1404 in [[The Hague]]. The studio's artists combined with Dirc to play an important role in the new cultural life of the royal court in the Netherlands.

Paintings by the Masters may be found in the collections of the [[Getty Center|J. Paul Getty Museum]] in [[Los Angeles, California]].

A '''necronym''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words νεκρός, ''nekros'', "dead" and ὄνομα ''ónoma'', "name") is a reference to, or [[name]] of, a person who has [[death|died]].  Many [[culture]]s have [[taboo]]s and [[tradition]]s associated with referring to such a person.  These vary from the extreme of never again speaking the person's real name, often using some [[wikt:circumlocution|circumlocution]] instead, to the opposite extreme of commemorating it incessantly by naming other things or people after the deceased.

For instance, in some cultures it is common for a newborn child to receive the name (a necronym) of a [[family|relative]] who has recently died, while in others to reuse such a name would be considered extremely inappropriate or even forbidden. While this varies from culture to culture, the use of necronyms is quite common.

==Examples==
Composer [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], born in 1770, had a brother named Ludwig Maria who was born in 1769 and lived for only six days. [[Vincent van Gogh]] had a brother of the same name who was born, and died, on March 30, 1852, exactly one year before the painter's birth. The artist [[Salvador Dalí]] was born nine months and ten days after his brother, also named Salvador, died from gastroenteritis at the age of one year and nine months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Believer - What's in a Necronym?|url = http://www.believermag.com/issues/201508/?read=article_vanasco|website = The Believer|date = 2015-08-01|accessdate = 2016-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ashkenazi Jew]]ish culture, it is a custom to name a child after a beloved relative who died as a way of honoring the deceased. Often the child will share the same [[Hebrew name]] as the namesake but not the given name in the vernacular language (e.g. English).

In [[Culture of Japan|Japan]], [[Buddhist]] families usually obtain a necronym, called a ''[[Dharma name|kaimyō]]'', for a deceased relative from a Buddhist priest in exchange for a donation to the temple.  Traditionally, the deceased were thereafter referred to by the necronym, as a sign of pious respect.  This name was often the only one inscribed on [[gravestone]]s in the past, though now it is more common to have the necronym in addition to the given name.

Necronyms were also commonly used during the [[Cold War]] as a means of protecting an [[intelligence officer]]'s true identity. For example, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[KGB]] agent [[Konon Molody]] was only known as Gordon Lonsdale (the true Lonsdale was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] born two years after Molody and died in 1943 when he was 19) in the United States. Molody adopted the name when he was 32, 11 years after the real Lonsdale's death.

The practice of bestowing necronyms has sometimes caused confusion for [[historian]]s. This is primarily because of the two birth certificates or records that could be present at a given time. This confusion often stems from the inability to differentiate the records of each child. One such example is the case of [[Shigechiyo Izumi]] (1865?–1986), accepted in 1986 as the world's oldest man by ''[[Guinness World Records|The Guinness Book of World Records]]'', but who was in fact possibly born in 1880, after one previous brother whose name he assumed upon his death.

According to the legend, a group of settlers led by a figure named Nunong Karugtong crossed the Sierra Madre Mountains from somewhere in what is now Rizal Province in search of better living conditions.  After examining multiple sites in what is now the Municipality of Infanta, they eventually settled on a site near the Bantilan River, where the discovery of a huge Yam root convinced them that the site was ideal for settlement.  This eventually became the site of the settlement which European colonizers would call "Binangonan de Lampon," which in turn would evolve into the Municipality of Infanta.&lt;ref name="infantagov"/&gt;

[[File:Battle of Poitiers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Battle of Poitiers]] 1356. The oriflamme can be seen on the top left.]]

The '''Oriflamme''' (from Latin ''aurea flamma'', "golden flame") was the [[battle standard]] of the [[King of France]] in the Middle Ages. It was originally the sacred banner of the [[Abbey of St. Denis]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xenophongroup.com/montjoie/orifl-fa.htm Oriflamme Society]&lt;/ref&gt; a monastery near Paris. When the oriflamme was raised in battle by the French royalty during the Middle Ages, most notably during the [[Hundred Years War]], no prisoners were to be taken until it was lowered. Through this tactic they hoped to strike fear into the hearts of the enemy, especially the nobles, who could usually expect to be taken alive for ransom during such military encounters.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Southey (1841) '' Joan of Arc: a poem'', Longman et autres. [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TPRAhDvWDrwC&amp;pg=PA280&amp;lpg=PA280&amp;dq=oriflamme+no+quarter+given&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=k7Nfv2vzz-&amp;sig=v2VEcfsGqIA6hlWsT62p_Jgrodg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAmoVChMIo6Du2dmMxwIVBL1yCh38WwSD#v=onepage&amp;q=oriflamme%20no%20quarter%20given&amp;f=false p. 280]&lt;/ref&gt;

In French, the term "''oriflamme''" has come to mean any banner with pointed ends; by association with the form of the original.

==Legendary origin==

 }}
The  Oriflamme was mentioned in the eleventh-century ballad the ''[[Chanson de Roland]]'' (vv. 3093-5) as a royal banner, first called ''Romaine'' and then ''Montjoie''.&lt;ref name=CathEncy/&gt; According to legend, [[Charlemagne]] carried it to the Holy Land in response to a prophecy regarding a knight possessing a golden lance, from which flames would burn and drive out the [[Saracens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Distant Mirror |last=Tuchman |first=Barbara |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1978|publisher=Penguin |location= |isbn=0140054073 |page=148 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the ''lance'' was originally the important object, with the banner simply a decoration, but this changed over time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/oriflamm.htm Heraldica.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Oriflamme was first used by [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]] in 1124 and was last flown in battle at Agincourt in 1415,&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Barber (1984) ''The Penguin guide to medieval Europe'', Penguin Books. [https://books.google.com/books?id=A9MYAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Oriflamme+Agincourt+no+quarter&amp;dq=Oriflamme+Agincourt+no+quarter&amp;pgis=1 p. 224]&lt;/ref&gt; though a version of it remained in the Abbey of St. Denis until the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Complete Book of Heraldry|last=Slater |first=Stephen |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=Hermes House |location= |isbn=1846819601 |page= 30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis VI replaced the earlier banner of Saint Martin with the oriflamme of the Abbey of St. Denis, which floated about the tomb of St. Denis and was said to have been given to the abbey by king Dagobert.
Until the 12th century the standard-bearer was the [[Comte de Vexin]], who, as vowed to St. Denis, was the temporal defender of the abbey. Louis VI, having acquired Vexin, became standard-bearer; as soon as war began, Louis VI received Communion at St. Denis and took the standard from the tomb of the saint to carry it to the combat.

It is recorded as having been carried at the following battles/campaigns:{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

*[[Battle of Poitiers|Poitiers 1356]]

The Oriflamme was lost at least five times during its medieval history; Mons-en-Pévèle,&lt;ref&gt;DeVries, Kelly (2006) : ''Infantry Warfare in the Early Fourteenth Century''.

== Appearance ==
The banner was red or orange-red silk and flown from a gilded lance.&lt;ref&gt;Slater (2002), p.33&lt;/ref&gt; According to legend, its colour stems from it being dipped in the blood of the recently beheaded [[Denis|St. Denis]].

The surviving descriptions of the Oriflamme are in Guillaume le Breton (thirteenth century), in the "Chronicle of Flanders" (fourteenth century), in the "Registra Delphinalia" (1456) and in the inventory of the treasury of St. Denis (1536). They show that the primitive Oriflamme was succeeded in the course of the centuries by newer Oriflammes which bore little resemblance to one another except for their colour.&lt;ref name=CathEncy&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Oriflamme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance on the battlefield ==
When the Oriflamme was displayed on the battlefield it indicated that [[no quarter]]
was to be given, its red colour being symbolic of cruelty and ferocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The laws of War in the late Middle Ages |last=Keen |first=Maurice |authorlink=Maurice Keen |coauthors= |year=1965 |publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul |location= London|isbn= |page= |pages= 105–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the azure ground (from the blue cope of [[Martin of Tours|St. Martin of Tours]]) strewn with gold [[fleur-de-lis]] remained the symbol of royalty until the 15th century, the Oriflamme became the royal battle standard of the King of France, and it was carried at the head of the king's forces when they met another army in battle. In the fifteenth century, the fleur-de-lis on the white flag of [[Joan of Arc]] became the new royal standard replacing both the symbol of royalty and the Oriflamme on the battle field.&lt;ref name=CathEncy/&gt;&lt;!--cited for last sentence--&gt;

==Porte oriflamme==
The bearer of the standard, the ''porte-oriflamme'', became an [[Great Officers of the Crown of France|office]] (like that of [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] or [[Constable of France|Constable]]) and a great honour, as it was an important and very dangerous job to take charge of such a visible symbol in battle.  If things went badly, the bearer was expected to die rather than relinquish his charge.

Froissart vividly describes ''porte-oriflamme'' Geoffroi de Charny's fall at the side of his king at the Battle of Poitiers in this passage:  &lt;blockquote&gt;“There Sir Geoffroi de Charny fought gallantly near the king (note: and his fourteen-year-old son). The whole press and cry of battle were upon him because he was carrying the king’s sovereign banner [the Oriflamme]. He also had before him his own banner, gules, three escutcheons argent. So many English and Gascons came around him from all sides that they cracked open the king’s battle formation and smashed it; there were so many English and Gascons that at least five of these men at arms attacked one [French] gentleman. Sir Geoffroi de Charny was killed with the banner of France in his hand, as other French banners fell to earth.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Jean Froissart; trans Geoffrey Brereton, ''Chronicles'' ( Penguin Books, Harmondsworth, UK, 1978), p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== The Oriflamme in literature ==
The 19th-century poet [[Robert Southey]] refers to the Oriflamme and its reputation in his poem ''Joan of Arc''{{cquote|
:::::"Dark-minded man!"
:The Maid of Orleans answered, "to act well
:Brings with itself an ample recompense.
:I have not reared the oriflamme of death —
:Now God forbid! The banner of the Lord
:Is this; and, come what will, me it behooves,
:Mindful of Him whose minister I am,
:To spare the fallen foe: that gracious God
:Sends me a messenger of mercy forth,
:Sends me to save this ravaged realm of France,
:To England friendly as to all the world;
:Only to those an enemy, whose lust
:Of sway makes them the enemies of man."

A '''people''' is a plurality of [[person]]s considered as a whole, as is the case with an [[ethnic group]] or [[nation]]. Collectively, for example, the contemporary [[Frisians]] and [[Danes]] are two related [[Germanic peoples]], while various [[Middle East]]ern ethnic groups are often linguistically categorized as [[Semitic people]]s.

[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' by [[Eugène Delacroix]]]]

Various [[sovereign state|states]] govern, or claim to govern, in the name of ''the people''. Both the [[Roman Republic]] and the [[Roman Empire]] used the [[Latin]] term ''[[SPQR|Senatus Populusque Romanus]]'', (the Senate and People of Rome). This term was fixed to Roman legionary standards, and even after the [[Roman Emperor]]s achieved a state of total personal [[autarchy]], they continued to wield their power in the name of the Senate and People of Rome.

A [[People's Republic]] is typically a [[Marxism|Marxist]] or [[Socialism|socialist]] [[one-party state]] that claims to govern on behalf of the people even if it in practice often turns out to be a [[dictatorship]]. [[Populism]] is another umbrella term for various political tendencies that claim to represent the people, usually with an implication that they serve the ''common people'' instead of the [[Elitism|elite]].

Chapter One, Article One of the [[Charter of the United Nations]] states that peoples have the right to [[self-determination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter1.shtml |title=Charter of the United Nations: Chapter I: Purposes and Principles |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=22 April 2013 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6YNQicd2P?url=http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter1.shtml |archive-date=8 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In law ==
{{further information|Popular sovereignty}}
In [[criminal law]], in certain jurisdictions, criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of ''the People''. Several U.S. states, including [[California]], [[Illinois]], and [[New York (state)|New York]], use this style.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''[[People v. Anderson|California v. Anderson]]'' 6 Cal. 3d 628; 493 P.2d 880; 100 Cal. Rptr. 152; 1972 Cal. LEXIS 154 (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; Citations outside the jurisdictions in question usually substitute the name of the state for the words "the People" in the case captions.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, ''[[Bluebook|The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation]]'', rule 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Four states&amp;nbsp;— [[Massachusetts]], [[Virginia]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Kentucky]]&amp;nbsp;— refer to themselves as ''the [[Commonwealth]]'' in case captions and legal process.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Commonwealth (United States)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Other states, such as [[Indiana]], typically refer to themselves as ''the State'' in case captions and legal process. Outside the United States, criminal trials in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[Philippines]] are prosecuted in the name of the people of their respective states.

The political theory underlying this format is that criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the [[sovereignty|sovereign]]; thus, in these [[U.S. states]], the "people" are judged to be the sovereign, even as in the [[United Kingdom]] and other dependencies of the [[British monarchy|British Crown]], criminal prosecutions are typically brought in the name of [[the Crown]]. "The people" identifies the entire body of the [[citizen]]s of a jurisdiction invested with political power or gathered for political purposes.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'', 5th ed., "People".&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom''', or the '''Royal Arms''' for short, is the official [[coat of arms]] of the [[British monarch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Symbols/Coatsofarms.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=17 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308050901/https://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Symbols/Coatsofarms.aspx |archivedate=8 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 10, [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/362346/hmg_identity_system_guidelines_2012.pdf Government identity system (2012)]. HM Government. "The Queen is Head of State, and the United Kingdom is governed by Her Majesty’s Government in the name of the Queen.
The royal coat of arms is personal to the Queen and..."&lt;/ref&gt; currently [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. These arms are used by the Queen in her official capacity as monarch of the [[United Kingdom]]. Variants of the Royal Arms are used by other members of the [[British royal family]]; and by the [[British government]] in connection with the administration and government of the country. In [[Scotland]], there exists a separate version of the Royal Arms, a variant of which is used by the [[Scotland Office]]. The arms in [[banner of arms|banner form]] serve as basis for the monarch's official flag, known as the ''[[Royal Standard of the United Kingdom|Royal Standard]]''.

In the standard variant used outside of Scotland, the shield is quartered, depicting in the first and fourth quarters the three passant guardant lions of England; in the second, the rampant lion and double tressure [[fleur-de-lis#Other European monarchs and rulers|flory-counterflory]] of Scotland; and in the third, a [[Clàrsach|harp]] for Ireland.&lt;ref name="Boutell"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brooke-Little |first=J.P., FSA |authorlink=John Brooke-Little |title=Boutell's Heraldry |origyear=1950 |edition=Revised |year=1978 |publisher=Frederick Warne LTD |location=London |isbn=0-7232-2096-4 |pages=205–222}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] is a [[Lion (heraldry)|statant guardant lion]] wearing the [[St Edward's Crown]], himself on another representation of that crown. The [[Dexter and sinister|dexter]] [[supporters|supporter]] is a likewise crowned English lion; the sinister, a Scottish [[unicorn]]. According to legend a free unicorn was considered a very dangerous beast; therefore the heraldic unicorn is chained,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldicsculptor.com/royal%20unicorn.htm|title=Heraldic Sculptor- Accessed 29 April 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as were both supporting unicorns in the [[royal coat of arms of Scotland]].

In the greenery below, a [[thistle]], [[Tudor rose]] and [[shamrock]] are depicted, representing Scotland, England and Ireland respectively. This [[armorial achievement]] comprises the [[motto]], in [[French language|French]], of [[English monarchs]], ''[[Dieu et mon Droit]]'' (God and my Right), which has descended to the present [[royal family]] as well as the [[Order of the Garter#Heraldry|Garter circlet]] which surrounds the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]], inscribed with the [[Order of the Garter|Order]]'s motto, ''[[Honi soit qui mal y pense]]'' (Shame on him who thinks evil).
The official [[blazon]] of the Royal Arms is:

{{quote|''Quarterly, first and fourth Gules three Lions passant gardant in pale Or armed and langued Azure (for England), second quarter Or a Lion rampant within a double tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for Scotland), third quarter Azure a Harp Or stringed Argent (for Ireland), the whole surrounded by the Garter; for a Crest, upon the Royal helm the Imperial Crown Proper, thereon a Lion statant gardant Or imperially crowned Proper; Mantling Or and Ermine; for Supporters, dexter a Lion rampant gardant Or crowned as the Crest, sinister a Unicorn Argent armed, crined and unguled Proper, gorged with a Coronet Or composed of Crosses patées and Fleurs-de-lis a Chain affixed thereto passing between the forelegs and reflexed over the back also Or.

==Uses==
[[File:St Andrew's church - royal arms - geograph.org.uk - 1708484.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Royal Arms as used by the [[House of Stuart]] (these being of William III and Mary II (1688-1694/1702))]]

The Royal Arms as shown above may only be used by the Queen herself. They also appear in courtrooms, since the monarch is deemed to be the fount of judicial authority in the United Kingdom and law courts comprise part of the ancient royal court (thus so named).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Traditions of the courts|url=https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-justice-system/court-traditions/|website=Courts and Tribunals Judiciary|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judges are officially Crown representatives, demonstrated by the display of the Royal Arms behind the judge's bench in all UK courts (with the exceptions of the [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]] in the [[City of London]], where behind the [[Justices of the Peace]] stands a sword upright flanked by the arms of the City and the Crown). In [[Northern Ireland]], the Royal Arms cannot be displayed in courtrooms or on court-house exteriors. There are a few exceptions, with the Royal Arms allowed to be displayed in the courtrooms of the [[Royal Courts of Justice, Belfast|Royal Courts of Justice in Belfast]] and the courts in Armagh, Banbridge, Downpatrick, Magherafelt, or Omagh. They may be shown on the exterior of court buildings that had them in place prior to the 2002 law.&lt;ref&gt;Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 (c.26) 66 [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/26/body/enacted Display of Royal Arms at courts]&lt;/ref&gt;

As the United Kingdom is governed in the monarch's name, the British Government also uses the Royal Arms as a national symbol of the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;Government identity system HM Government&lt;/ref&gt; and, in that capacity, the coat of arms can be seen on several government documents and forms, passports, in the entrance to embassies and consulates, etc. However, when used by the government and not by the monarch personally, the coat of arms is often represented without the helm. This is also the case with the sovereign's Scottish arms, a version of which is used by the [[Scotland Office]].

The Royal Arms have regularly appeared on the coinage produced by the [[Royal Mint]] including, for example, from 1663, the [[Guinea (British coin)|Guinea]] and, from 1983, the [[British one pound coin]].  In 2008, a new series of designs for all seven coins of £1 and below was unveiled by the Royal Mint, every one of which is drawn from the Royal Arms.  The full Royal Arms appear on the one pound coin, and sections appear on each of the other six, such that they can be put together like a puzzle to make another complete representation of the Royal Arms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalmint.com/newdesigns/designsRevealed.aspx The New Designs Revealed&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404064611/http://www.royalmint.com/newdesigns/designsRevealed.aspx|date=4 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monarch grants [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|Royal Warrant]]s to select businesses and tradespeople which supply the Royal Household with goods or services. This entitles those businesses to display the Royal Arms on their packaging and stationery by way of advertising.

It is customary (but not mandatory) for churches throughout the United Kingdom whether in the [[Church of England]] or the [[Church of Scotland]] to display the Royal Arms to show loyalty to the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Treasures of Britain and Treasures of Ireland|edition=1976|publisher=Drive Publications|page=677}} Retrieved 15 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intriguing-history.com/royal-arms-in-church/|title=Royal Arms in church|publisher=Intriguing History|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A banner of the Royal Arms, known as the [[Royal Standard (United Kingdom)|Royal Standard]], is flown from the royal palaces when the monarch is in residence, [[Windsor Castle]] and [[Buckingham Palace]] being her principal abodes; and from public buildings only when the monarch is present. This protocol equally applies to the monarch's principal residences in Scotland (the [[Palace of Holyroodhouse]] and [[Balmoral Castle]]), where the Royal Standard (Scottish version) is flown. When the monarch is not in residence the [[Union Flag]], or in Scotland the ancient [[Royal Standard of Scotland]], is flown.

The widely sold British newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' uses the Hanoverian Royal Arms as a logo, whereas its sister publication, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', displays the current Royal Arms.

The Royal Arms are also displayed in all courts in [[British Columbia]], as well as in other Canadian provinces such as [[Ontario]], where the judges are appointed by Crown authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/index.asp Welcome&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]{{dead link|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal Arms were also displayed by all [[Governor-General of Australia|Viceroys of Australia]] as representation of their Crown authority.

The Royal Arms are also used and displayed in the Supreme Courts of South Australia and Victoria.

The Royal Arms are also the coat of arms for the [[Western Australian Legislative Council]].

The Royal Arms were controversially used by former Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] as her official letterhead from {{circa|1997|lk=yes}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Summers |first2=Ben |last2=Streeter |first=Michael |title=The strange case of Lady Thatcher and Her Majesty's coat of arms |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-strange-case-of-lady-thatcher-and-her-majestys-coat-of-arms-1274739.html |newspaper=The Independent |date=24 March 1997 |accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Royal coat of arms of Scotland}}
Since the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603, a separate version of the Royal Arms has been used in [[Scotland]], giving the Scottish elements pride of place.

The [[shield]] is quartered, depicting in the first and fourth quarters the lion ''rampant'' of Scotland; in the second, the three lions ''passant guardant'' of England; and in the third, the harp of [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]].

The [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] atop the [[Crown of Scotland]] is a red lion, seated and forward facing, itself wearing the Crown of Scotland and holding the two remaining elements of the [[Honours of Scotland]], namely the Sword of State and the Sceptre of Scotland. This was also the crest used in the Royal Arms of the [[Kingdom of Scotland]]. The motto, in [[Scots language|Scots]], appears above the crest, in the tradition of [[Scottish heraldry]], and is an abbreviated form of the full motto: ''[[In My Defens God Me Defend]]''.

The supporters change sides and both appear wearing the crowns of their respective Kingdom. The [[Dexter and sinister|dexter]] [[supporter]] is a crowned and chained unicorn, symbolising Scotland. The [[Dexter and sinister|sinister]] supporter is a crowned lion, symbolising England. Between each supporter and the shield is a lance displaying the flag of their respective Kingdom.

The coat also features both the motto ''[[Nemo me impune lacessit]]'' (No one wounds (touches) me with impunity) and, surrounding the shield, the [[Livery collar|collar]] of the [[Order of the Thistle]]. On the [[Compartment (heraldry)|compartment]] are a number of thistles, Scotland's national flower.

===England, Wales and Northern Ireland===
[[File:St Mary, Stone, Kent - Royal Arms - geograph.org.uk - 1490059.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The current version of the Royal Arms, displayed in the parish church of [[Stone, Kent]].]]
Unlike the [[Acts of Union 1707]] with Scotland, the [[Acts of Union 1800]] with Ireland did not provide for a separate Irish version of the royal arms.{{dubious|1706/7 says "the quartering the Arms, and the Rank and Precedency of the Lyon King of Arms of the Kingdom of Scotland as may best suit the Union, be left to her Majesty" and 1800 says nothing for or against. If the contention is that the 1800 acts have been interpreted as FORBIDDING separate royal arms for Ireland, then that requires specific cites.|date=November 2017}} The [[Arms of Ireland#Achievement|crest of the Kingdom of Ireland]] (''on a wreath Or and Azure, a tower triple-towered of the First, from the portal a hart springing Argent attired and unguled Or'') has had little or no official use since the union. When the [[Irish Free State]] established [[great Seal of the Irish Free State|its own seals]] in the 1930s, the "Fob Seal" used on [[letter of credence|letters of credence]] varied the British arms by having the harp in two quarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://difp.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=2243 |title=Memorandum on external seals |first=Joseph |last=Walshe |authorlink=Joseph Walshe |date=26 October 1937 |work=Documents on Irish Foreign Policy, Vol. V No. 97 |publisher=[[Royal Irish Academy]] |accessdate=20 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The harp quarter of the Royal Arms represents Ireland on both the English and Scottish versions.  Likewise, one English quarter is retained in the Scottish version, and one Scottish quarter is retained in the English version.  Thus, England, Scotland and Ireland are represented in all versions of the Royal Arms since they came under one monarch.
By contrast, there is no representation at all for [[Wales]] in the Royal Arms, as at the Act of Union 1707 Wales was an integral part of the Kingdom of England pursuant to the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542]]; thus, it has been argued Wales is represented in the English coat of arms.  However the argument is somewhat disengenuous as in 1535 the Welsh Dragon was already part of the Tudor Coat of Arms. Upon the accession of the Tudor monarchs, who were themselves of Welsh descent, a Welsh Dragon was used as a supporter on the Royal Arms. This was dropped by their successors, the Scottish House of Stuart, who replaced the Tudors' dragon supporter with the Scottish unicorn
In the 20th century, the [[coat of arms of Wales|arms of the principality of Wales]] were added as an inescutcheon to the [[Coat of arms of the Prince of Wales|coat of arms]] of the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]], and a banner of those arms with a green inescutcheon bearing the prince's crown is flown as his personal standard in Wales.  The so-called [[Prince of Wales's feathers]] are a heraldic badge rather than a coat of arms upon a shield, but they are not Welsh in any case.  They derive, in fact, from the English Princes of Wales (who may owe them to an exploit of [[Edward, the Black Prince]] at the [[Battle of Crécy]]) and carry the motto ''{{lang|de|Ich dien}}'' ([[German language|German]], "I Serve").  In any event, they do not form part of the Royal Arms, as opposed to the heraldic achievement of the Prince of Wales, who drops them upon his accession as King.

==History==

===Kingdoms of England and Scotland===
The current royal arms are a combination of the arms of the former kingdoms that make up the [[United Kingdom]], and can be traced back to the first arms of the kings of England and kings of Scotland. Various alterations occurred over the years as the arms of other realms acquired or claimed by the kings were added to the royal arms. The table below tracks the changes in the royal arms from the original arms of King Richard I of England, and William I, King of Scots.

==Other variants==

===Royal family===
Members of the [[British royal family]] are granted their own personal arms which are based on the Royal Arms. Only children and grandchildren in the male line of the monarch are entitled to arms in this fashion: the arms of children of the monarch are differenced with a three-point [[Label (heraldry)|label]]; grandchildren of the monarch are differenced with a five-point label. An exception is made for the eldest son of the Prince of Wales, who bears a three-point label. Since 1911, the arms of the Prince of Wales also displays an [[inescutcheon]] of the ancient [[Coat of Arms of the Principality of Wales|arms of the Principality of Wales]]. 
Queens consort and the wives of sons of the monarch also have their own personal coat of arms. Typically this will be the arms of their husband impaled with their own personal arms or those of their father, if armigerous. However, the consorts of a Queen regnant are not entitled to use the Royal Arms. Thus [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] has been granted his own personal arms.

Currently the following members of the royal family have their own arms based on the Royal Arms:

[[File:Coat of Arms of the British Government.jpg|thumb|150px|A version used by the [[British Government]] on official websites and departmental insignia.]]

Various versions of the Royal Arms are used by [[Her Majesty's Government]] in the United Kingdom, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] and courts in some parts of the Commonwealth.

HM Government generally uses a simplified version of the Royal Arms with a crown replacing the helm and crest, and with no compartment.&lt;ref&gt;GOV.UK, Departments, agencies and public bodies [https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations]. Retrieved 10 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to Scotland, the [[Scotland Office]] and the [[Advocate General for Scotland]] use the Scottish version, again without the [[Helmet|helm]] or [[crest (heraldry)|crest]], and the same was used as the day-to-day logo of the [[Scottish Executive]] until September 2007, when a [[rebranding]] exercise introduced the name ''[[Scottish Government]]'', together with a revised logo incorporating the [[flag of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170305194010/http://news.gov.scot/news/new-lord-lyon-king-of-arms-appointed |www.gov.scot New Lyon King-of-arms appointed]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scottish Government continues to use the Arms on some official documents.

The simplified Royal Arms also feature:

* on all [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]];
* on the cover of all [[British passport|UK passports]];
* as an inescutcheon on the [[diplomatic flag]]s of British Ambassadors; and
* on all acts of the [[Anguilla House of Assembly]], the [[Sovereign Base Areas]], [[Pitcairn Islands]] and [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] administrations.

Various courts in the Commonwealth also continue to use the Royal Arms:

* The [[Court of Appeal of British Columbia|Court of Appeal]], [[Supreme Court of British Columbia|Supreme Court]] and [[Provincial Court of British Columbia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/court_of_appeal/hearing_list/|title=Court of Appeal - Hearing List|website=www.courts.gov.bc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.provincialcourt.bc.ca/|title=Provincial Court of British Columbia|website=www.provincialcourt.bc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore:
* A version of the crest of the Royal Arms, as used in Scotland, is used by the [[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service]], the [[General Register Office for Scotland]] and the [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland]].
* The crowned shield of the Royal Arms encircled by the Garter is used by the [[Home Office]] and by the [[Parliament of Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/|title=Parliament of Victoria - Home|website=www.parliament.vic.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The crowned shield of the Royal Arms is used by the [[Royal Mint]].
* The Royal Arms with the crest but without the helm is used as the rank insignia for Class 1 Warrant Officers in Her Majesty's Armed Forces.

'''Salome Sellers''' (''née'' '''Sylvester'''; January 1{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}, 1800 &amp;ndash; January 9, 1909) was an American centenarian who was the last known survivor from the [[18th century]].

==Biography==
Salome Sylvester was born in [[Deer Isle, Maine]] (then part of [[Massachusetts]]), the daughter of Edward and Deborah (''née'' Cushman) Sylvester. She grew up on Deer Isle and married Joseph Sellers on 23 December 1830. The couple had six children together, Salome outliving all but her oldest son, William. She was widowed in 1865.

Due to her unusually long life, Salome was often featured in local newspapers and visited by people interested in her long life, something Salome once expressed as, "I've lived too long. I'm only a curiosity now for people to come and stare at".

Salome Sellers died in the same house she and her husband had built in 1830 in Deer Isle, Maine on 9 January 1909, aged 109 years, 8 days. Her house is now known as the [[Salome Sellers House]] and home to the Deer Isle-Stonington Historical Society. There has also been a book written about her life: "An Island Woman: Salome Sylvester Sellers, 1800-1909".

According to the post-1900 publications of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;i.e. the writings of [[C. W. Leadbeater]], [[Annie Besant]], etc., as well as those authors influenced by the theosophical teachings such as [[Alice A. Bailey]], and [[Benjamin Creme]], and the [[Ascended Master Teachings]] of [[Guy Ballard]], [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]],  [[Geraldine Innocente]], [[Joshua David Stone]], and other Ascended Master Teachings / teachers,&lt;/ref&gt; '''Lord Sunat Kumara'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://ascension-research.org/sanat.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luisprada.com/Protected/a_progress_report_on_our_ascension.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; is an "Advanced Being" at the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|Ninth level of initiation]] who is regarded as the 'Lord' or 'Regent' of [[Earth]] and of the [[Human race|humanity]], and is thought to be the head of the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] of Earth who dwells in [[Shamballah]] (also known as 'The City of Enoch').

Shamballah is said by the adherents to the Ascended Master Teachings, to be a floating city manifested on the [[etheric plane]] somewhere above the [[Gobi Desert]] in the borderlands of [[Mongolia]].&lt;ref&gt;(See: '[[Autobiography of a Yogi]]' By [[Yogananda Paramahansa]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[A Tibetan Journey]] By Alexandra David-Neale. 1923.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Great White Brotherhood]] is a spiritual 'fraternity' of Ascended Beings, including Lord Sunat Kumara, long since dedicated to the eventual Salvation of Mankind and the establishment of Divine Law again in this Three-dimensional reality.

According to Elizabeth Van Buren, the Brotherhood once maintained (earthly) headquarters hidden in a remote valley near a sacred lake in old Tibet, until relatively recently, when, possibly due to the surmised threat of Communist China, they withdrew, allegedly through subterranean tunnels to an alternative earthly location in [[Peru]], where they are still reported as having an earth base (circa 1985).&lt;ref&gt;[[Authors Notes: 'The Refuge of the Apocalypse.]] By Elizabeth Van Buren. 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

These authors believe that Lord Sunat Kumara is the founder of the Great White Brotherhood, composed of [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] (called in the Ascended Master Teachings [[Ascended Master]]s) and volunteers from other worlds who have joined together to advance spiritual evolution on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'' Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004. Describes the founding of Shamballah by Sunat Kumara&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanat Kumara in Hinduism==
Sanat Kumara appears as a [[rishi]] in the [[Hindu]] [[religious text]] the [[Chandogya Upanishad]]. A shrine to Sanat Kumara which attracts and unites people of all religions and faiths is situated in the town of [[Kataragama]], [[Sri Lanka]]. In Sanskrit, "Sanat Kumara" is "Eternal Youth" (from [[Sant (religion)|Sanat]] "eternal", Ku "with difficulty" and Mara "mortal"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danijel.org/index.php?id=clanak&amp;articleID=161&amp;pageID=22 O znalcima vraga] — Danijel Turina&lt;/ref&gt;).

The Kumar resides in the most sublime center of our planet, [[Shamballa]], the [[sahasrara]] of the world.  The Kumara has several names, relating to the sahasrara centers of different Systemic Existences: At the Supra-Cosmic plane, he is called ''Sanatana''; at the Cosmic plane, it is ''Subrahmanya''; at the Solar plane, the Kumara is ''Sanaka''; at the Planetary plane, it is ''Sanandana''; and on this planet, it is ''Sanath'' Kumara. So Sanath Kumara is an aspect of Kumara that resides in Shamballa.

Scriptures, especially the [[Mahabharata]], say that it is Sanath Kumara who comes down to help the Divine Plan of Creation, when [[Lord Krishna]] came to be. He was born to Lord Krishna as his son, and he was named [[Pradyumna]]. Sanath Kumara incarnates himself through the Divine Mother [[Rukmini]] as Pradyumna. On completion of his work, He again gets back to his original position and takes to the seat in Shambala as Sanath Kumara. These details are given in the last chapters of [[Mahabharata]].

==Shamballa in Buddhism – home of the King of the World==

''Shambhala'' ([[Wylie transliteration|Tib]]. ''bde 'byung'') in [[Vajrayana Buddhism]] (the religion of [[Tibet]]) is a [[Sanskrit]] term meaning "place of peace/tranquility/happiness". [[Gautama Buddha]] is said by Vajrayana Buddhists to have taught the [[Kalachakra]] [[tantra]] on request of King [[Suchandra]] of Shambhala; the teachings are also said to be preserved in Shamballa.  The [[Stanzas of Dzyan]] from which [[Madame Blavatsky]] claimed to have gotten the information in [[The Secret Doctrine]] are believed by some scholars to have been a mistranslation of words ''Kalachakra tantra'' (''rGyud-sde'' in [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]).&lt;ref&gt;Reigle, David and Nancy ''Blavatsky's Secret Books'' San Diego 1999. {{ISBN|0-913510-76-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shambhala is ruled over by a line of [[Kings of Shambhala]] known as [[Kulika]] or [[Kalki]] Kings (Tib. ''Rigden''), a monarch who upholds the integrity of the ''Kalachakra tantra''. In the teachings of Vajrayana Buddhism, the King of Shamballa is often metaphorically referred to as ''The King of the World''.  Shamballa was thought by the [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]]s to be somewhere north of [[Lake Manasarovar]] and its adjacent [[Mount Kailash|Mount Kailasa]], a [[sacred mountain]] in Tibet where it is thought that all the [[Ley line|dragon current]]s intersect.

==The Defender Lord at Kurama Temple==
The ancient Buddhist temple, [[Kurama-dera]] in [[Japan]], is host to a unique bodhisattva, the "Defender Lord", who is said to come from the planet Venus 6.5 million years ago. He is described as having the appearance of a 16-year-old boy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Sanat Kumara in Theosophy==
{{Theosophy}}
Sanat Kumara  was mentioned briefly  by the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] [[Helena Blavatsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, Helena Petrovna ''The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy'' – Theosophical Publishing House, 1888. Sanat Kumara – Volume I: 89, 457–458; Volume II: pages 106, 140, 319, 584.&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed he belonged to a group of beings, the "Lords of the Flame", whom Christian tradition has presented as [[Lucifer]] and the fallen angels.&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, Helena Petrovna ''The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy'' – Theosophical Publishing House, 1888. Volume II pp 243 ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanat Kumara gained greater prominence when Blavatsky's close-friend and colleague  [[Charles W. Leadbeater]] wrote that Sanat Kumara was the "King" or ''Lord of the World'', and the head of the [[Great White Brotherhood]] of [[Mahatma]]s who had revealed the principles of theosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Pages 296–299&lt;/ref&gt;

Later authors who draw from Theosophical teachings such as [[Alice Bailey]] and [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] have added to the story with further details. He is usually depicted as having the appearance of a 16-year-old boy, said to be the incarnation of the Will of the Logos, and purportedly possesses an unaging body not born of mortal woman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=q6xVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207&amp;dq=sanat+kumara+theosophy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ts3XnQyt-F&amp;sig=IEXRZ-Z1gLLBh6-bQnczyiul1BM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP-I-i6bvKAhXGlh4KHbeKBhk4FBDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sanat%20kumara%20theosophy&amp;f=false First Principles of Theosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Descent of Sanat Kumara and the Lords of the Living Flame from Venus==
C.W. Leadbeater and later adherents of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] such as Alice A. Bailey believe that Sanat Kumara descended from the [[etheric plane]] of the planet [[Venus]] to [[Earth]] 18,500,000 years ago (A.E. Powell gives a figure of 16,500,000 years ago; [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] of [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] does not give a specific date but says it was a minimum of 2,500,000 years ago). In [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], the beings that helped Sanat Kumara organize the expedition from [[Venus]] are called the "Lords of the Flame".  C.W. Leadbeater and [[Annie Besant]] said that Sanat Kumara brought 30 "Lords of the Flame" with him from Venus to help him set up his colony.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Page 299&lt;/ref&gt; In the later version of the story promulgated by [[Guy Ballard]], notable "Lords of the Flame" include [[Gautama Buddha]], and the [[World Teacher]] (the being referred to alternately as [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]] or [[Christ]] by [[Benjamin Creme]]). [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]]'s [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] teaches that Sanat Kumara and the Lords of the Flame also brought [[144,000]] souls with them from Venus. Alice Bailey, on the other hand, gives the number 105 only. The prior incarnation and only incarnation of Maitreya, the Lord of Consciousness, according to some interpretations (not C.W. Leadbeater's), is Gauthama Siddartha Sakyamuni / Lord Buddha; according to these interpretations, he essentially 'overshadowed' the body of Gautama Siddhartha Buddha with Siddhartha's permission.

Sanat Kumara is regarded as the great guru, saviour of Earth. Believers in him see him in all the major religions, as [[Murugan|Skanda]]/[[Kartikkeya]] in [[Hinduism]], [[Brahma]]-'''Sanam Kumar''' in [[Buddhism]], the [[Ancient of Days]] in [[Judeo-Christian]] traditions, and identify him as [[Ahura Mazda]] in [[Zoroastrianism]] (although the last of these claims is contested from a lack of information on the subject). It is also considered that Sanat Kumara is [[Al Khdir]] (green man) known to [[Sufi]] Muslims (according to [[Dakshinamurti]]).

It is maintained in most of these versions of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] that [[Venus]], the 'Planet of Love', is the most spiritually advanced [[planet]] of our [[solar system]]. The beings living on the [[etheric plane]] of [[Venus]] are said to be hundreds of millions of years ahead of us in their spiritual evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, A.E. ''The Solar System'' London: 1930 The Theosophical Publishing House (A Complete Outline of the Theosophical Scheme of Evolution) See chart on Page 33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiritofra.com/EC_etheric_planes.htm Planetary Schemes of Our Solar System According to Theosophy:]&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that the governing council of [[Venus]] – the ''Seven Holy Kumars'' – sent one of themselves, Sanat Kumara, here to guide us.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth &amp; Mark Clare Prophet (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana: 2003 Summit University Press, pages 339–341&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Theosophy, once Sanat Kumara arrived here, he directed the construction of the city of Shamballa on the [[etheric plane]] above the [[Gobi Desert]] to serve as his headquarters. Elizabeth Clare Prophet teaches that Shamballa was built physically on the White Island in the Gobi Sea (now the Gobi Desert), and was only later withdrawn from the physical to the etheric plane.

==City plan of Shamballa==
The main temple of Shamballa is topped with a [[Gold (color)|golden]] dome and is surrounded by seven smaller temples—one for each of the seven rays.  These temples are located on a number of wide [[boulevard]]s resembling the [[Champs-Elysees]].&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth &amp; Mark Clare Prophet, (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Pages 465–470 Shamballa&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Elizabeth Clare Prophet, [[George Washington]] was divinely inspired by the Ascended Masters to choose [[city planner]] [[Pierre L'Enfant]] to create the [[city plan]] of [[Washington DC]] which, it is claimed, he unconsciously modeled on the plan of the city of Shamballa.

==Appellations (titles) of Sanat Kumara==
The most common title attributed to Lord Sanat Kumara in the Theosophical religious tradition is "Lord of the World". [[C.W. Leadbeater]] also states that an important duty of Sanat Kumara is to participate in an elaborate ritual every [[Wesak]] (the Full Moon of May) led by [[Gautama Buddha]], and also participated in by the [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]] (the being Theosophists identify as [[Christ]]), in which [[Spiritual energy|cosmic energy]] is focused from the "Solar Logos" to Earth in order to keep our planet's cosmic energy in balance.  The ritual is said to take place in a ravine in southern [[Tibet]] (the Frontispiece of Leadbeater's book ''The Masters and the Path'' has a picture of the ritual taking place) and, it is stated by Leadbeater, can be viewed by in the [[etheric body]] or in the [[physical body]] by those who have [[third eye|etheric sight]].&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House 1929 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing 1997) – Fold-out picture facing the title page of the book shows a picture of Lord Sananda Buddha performing the Wesak ritual&lt;/ref&gt;

Paradoxically, two other common appellations of Sanat Kumara are two opposite titles: "The Ancient of Days" (because he has been on [[Earth]] millions of years) and "The Youth of Sixteen Summers" (because even though he is millions of years old, he still looks like he is 16 years old).  Another of his titles is "The One Initiator" because it is said by C. W. Leadbeater in the ''Masters and the Path'' that he personally performs the initiation ceremony for anyone who has reached the third level of spiritual [[Initiation (Theosophy)|initiation]].  [[Alice A. Bailey]] indicates the same in her writings.

In the all organizations subscribing to the "''Ascended Master Teachings''", Sanat Kumara is presented  as an [[Ascended master|Ascended Master]]. He is also currently, according to the Ascended Master Teachings, known as the "Regent Lord of the World" in deference to [[Gautama Buddha]] having taken the office of "Lord of the World". (1956).&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K.. ''Law of Life – Book II''. Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications 1989. Describes Sanat Kumara and his role in founding the Brotherhood on Earth and passing the office of "Lord of the World" to Lord Sananda.&lt;/ref&gt; With Sananda Buddha taking on more of the day-to-day administrative tasks of governing the planet, this arrangement allows Sanat Kumara more time for the long-range [[Milky Way Galaxy|galactic]] planning and interstellar diplomacy that is necessary for him to prepare Earth for its eventual admission to what [[Joshua David Stone]] calls the [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Galactic Confederation of Planets|Galactic Confederation of Planets]].

Sanat Kumara's symbol of the authority of his office as ''Lord of the World'' is a {{convert|2|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}}, {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} [[magic wand]] called the ''Rod of Power'' made of the metal [[orichalcum]], with cone-shaped [[diamond]]s on each end.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House 1925 Pages 268–269&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lady Master Venus==
[[The Bridge to Freedom]], [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] and all other "[[Ascended Master Teachings]]" organizations believe that Sanat Kumara has a ''Divine Complement'' (''Twin Flame'') (i.e., a ''celestial wife'') – '''Lady Master Venus'''[http://www.missionstgermain.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/ladymastervenus.jpg]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missionstgermain.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/ladymastervenus.jpg Image of Lady Master Venus shown above is originally from the Church Universal and Triumphant):]&lt;/ref&gt; – the New Age "[[goddess|Goddess of Love]]".&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Annice ''The Masters and Their Retreats '' Summit Lighthouse Library June 2003, Summarizes the beliefs about Sanat Kumara by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, and The Summit Lighthouse&lt;/ref&gt; The Ascended ''Lady Master Venus'' is usually depicted as having the appearance of a 16-year-old girl.  Sanat Kumara is believed to have [[Marriage|married]] Lady Master Venus millions of years ago on Venus before he came to Earth.

==Lady Master Meta==

According to the Ascended Master Teachings, Sanat Kumara and the Lady Master Venus have a daughter named the '''Lady Master Meta''' [http://www.ethericretreats.com/images/meta.jpg] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethericretreats.com/meta.htm Source of (not very clear) Image of the Lady Master Meta—Etheric Retreats website:]&lt;/ref&gt; who they brought with them from Venus.  She is said to have incarnated as an [[Avatar]] in Atlantis (where she served as the [[high priestess]] at the ''Temple of Healing'') and in [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanian Persia]], where she married a [[wikt:mortality|mortal]] and had three children.  In the Ascended Master Teachings, she is revered as the ''Goddess of Healing'' and is the patron deity of [[physician|doctor]]s and [[nurse]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press, pages 227–228 Lady Master Meta&lt;/ref&gt; Since she is [[Immortality|immortal]], possessing a celestial body like Sanat Kumara and the Lady Master Venus, she, like the Lady Master Venus, also has the appearance of a 16-year-old girl.

==Master Cha Ara==

According to the Ascended Master Teachings, the '''Master Cha Ara''' [http://www.worldglobalexpress.com/BofLight/CHA-ARA.JPG ] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldglobalexpress.com/brotherhoodoflight.htm Source of Image of Master Cha Ara – World Global Express Brotherhood of Light:]&lt;/ref&gt;
was originally one of the three children of Lady Master Meta when she incarnated as an Avatar in [[Sassanian empire|Sassanian Persia]].  He became a master [[alchemy|alchemist]] who formulated an [[elixir of immortality]] made from [[Rose|rose petals]], tea leaves from mcleod ganj and other ingredients.  This enabled him to quickly achieve ascended masterhood.  He uses small amounts of the elixir to heal people.  He is the protector of all [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]].  He works with [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]] to bring about the New Age in the West [[Americas]].  Lady Master Meta’s husband and her other two children from her descent as an Avatar to Sassanian Persia have also become ascended masters but their names have not yet been revealed.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Page 52 Master Cha Ara; pages 227–228 Lady Master Meta&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lady Master Nada==

In the [[Ascended Master Teachings]], a group of religions based on [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], '''Lady Master Nada'''&lt;ref&gt;Artist concept:[http://www.summitlh.com/minneapolis/chohans/chohans_files/_notes/nada-lrg-n.jpg] - source of image Summit Lighthouse Teaching Center (Minneapolis-St. Paul, USA)&lt;/ref&gt; is the "Chohan of the Sixth Ray" (see [[Seven Rays]]), and is the [[Ascended master|Ascended Lady Master]] governing humanity's development of the Divine Qualities of Ministration, Service, and Peace. The colors of her [[Seven Rays|Ray]] are [[purple]] and [[Gold (color)|gold]], and also [[Ruby (color)|ruby]].&lt;ref name="Life Book II"&gt;Luk, A.D.K.. ''Law of Life – Book II''. Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications 1989, Listing of Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity and [[The Bridge to Freedom]]&lt;/ref&gt;

She is also considered a Member of the [[Sanat Kumara#Sanat Kumara's cosmic bureaucracy|Karmic Board]]; she handles the appeals of those on the [[Seven Rays|third ray]].  She is believed by those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings to have succeeded the previous Chohan, the '''Master Jesus / Sananda Buddha''', on January 1, 1956, when she is said to have fully taken on the Office of Chohan of the Sixth Ray.,&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Annice ''The Masters and Their Retreats '' Summit Lighthouse Library June 2003, Listing of Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, and [[The Summit Lighthouse]] Pages 144 and 240&lt;/ref&gt; thus advancing from the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|fifth to the sixth level of initiation]].

Designed after the pattern of a [[rose]], with each "petal" being a room, this Retreat is the etheric counterpart of the "Temple of Love" on [[Root race#The civilization of Atlantis|Atlantis]] where Nada once served as a High Priestess.  In another human incarnate life in Atlantis, she was a [[lawyer]].&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'' Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004, Listing of those who are believed to be Ascended Masters by The [[I AM Activity]] and The Bridge to Freedom&lt;/ref&gt; She was described as having raised her body and [[Initiation (Theosophy)|Ascended]] approximately 2,776 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;King, Godfre Ray.

Although the Lady Master Nada's home residence (called in the Ascended Master Teachings her "retreat") is underground on the etheric plane on the Arabian peninsula, according to the Ascended Master Teachings, she teleports to Shamballa every workday to her day job on the [[Sanat Kumara#Sanat Kumara's cosmic bureaucracy|Karmic Board]], hearing the cases of those souls who are on the third ray.

==Masters of the Ancient Wisdom==

According to  the [["I AM" Activity]], the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]]&lt;ref&gt;Shearer, Monroe &amp; Carolyn ''I AM Adorations, Affirmations &amp; Rhythmic Decrees'' Acropolis Sophia Books and Works 1998. Refers also to the other six Kumars that assist Sanat Kumara&lt;/ref&gt; and others, the [[Ascended Master]]s (The great beings the original Theosophists called the "[[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]]"), such as the [[Master Jesus]], [[Count of St Germain|Saint Germain]], '''Megha Alcorn''' aka '''Megan Sebastian''' on [[Earth]],   [[Kuthumi]], '''Hatton''', [[Gopal Das]] and others are working for the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] of our planet, under the leadership of Lord Sanat Kumara, [[Gautama Buddha]], and [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]].  Many theosophists believe the "Masters" utilize the cosmic power of the [[Seven Rays]] to advance the ''Plan of the Masters'' to encourage the continual advance of [[civilization]] on [[Earth]] toward higher [[Initiation (Theosophy)|levels of consciousness]]. One of the beliefs of adherents of these belief systems is that the Masters of Wisdom have united together in an organization called the ''[[Great White Brotherhood]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Great White Brotherhood in the Culture, History and Religion of America''. Summit University Press 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanat Kumara is also often referred to as the manifestation of the 'Solar Logos'==

The Theosophist '''A.E. Powell''' stated that Sanat Kumara (whom he refers to as the ''Lord of the World'') is in continuous telepathic rapport with '''ANNA''' / [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], the ''Spirit of the Earth'' (i.e., the ''Planetary Logos'' – equivalent to the goddess known in some religions as [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] or as Prithivi in Hinduism).&lt;ref&gt;Powell, A.E. ''The Solar System'' London:1930 The Theosophical Publishing House (A Complete Outline of the Theosophical Scheme of Evolution)&lt;/ref&gt;[[C.W. Leadbeater]] and [[Alice A. Bailey]] stated that Sanat Kumara is in continuous [[Telepathy|telepathic]] rapport with the [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings functioning within the Sun|Solar Logos]] (the Being considered by Theosophists as the consciousness of the [[Sun]]). It is believed in Theosophy that Sanat Kumara captures the mystical power of the [[Seven Rays]] from the Solar Logos and distributes it to his assistants who guide the spiritual evolution of humanity, the ''Masters of the Ancient Wisdom'' (the Ascended Masters), who then focus the power to us.  An intermediate trinity of [[Pratyeka]]-Buddhas assists Lord Buddha in stepping down this power from Sanat Kumara to Earth's [[Spiritual Hierarchy]], and these Buddhas are also said to be Kumars originally from Venus.

==The council chamber of the Lord of the World==

According to the ''[[Alice Bailey#Bibliography|Alice A. Bailey material]]'', Lord Sanat Kumara conducts business in an enormous room in his palace called ''The Council Chamber of the Lord of the World''.  It is here that he regularly meets with [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]], the '''Maha Chohan''', [[Djwal Khul]], [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]], the [[Master Jesus]] and the other [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]], of which it is said there are 24 principal council members, to assess the progress being made in implementing ''The Plan of the Masters'' to bring the [[human race]] to [[Level of consciousness|higher levels of consciousness]].  According to C.W. Leadbeater, it is also here that he periodically personally receives ambassadors from [[Planetary system|other solar systems]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Leadbeater, C.W.  ''The Masters and the Path''  Adyar, Madras, India: 1925 – Theosophical Publishing House&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanat Kumara's cosmic bureaucracy==

According to the ''[[Alice Bailey#Bibliography|Alice A. Bailey material]]'', Sanat Kumara has many assistants who help him in his arduous task of spiritually governing Earth as its presiding Regent. 
These include '''The Watcher''' (also called the ''Silent Watcher'' or the ''Great Silent Watcher''), whose function it is to continually watch the [[Akashic records]] and download daily all the [[information]] on them relevant to the life waves of Earth and forward it to the ''Custodian of the Hall of Records''.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Page 300&lt;/ref&gt; (the Watcher is part of a special race of beings who fulfill this function that are posted on planets throughout the [[Cosmos]] &lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press (Note: the idea that Watcher was part of race of beings posted throughout the Cosmos to fulfill this functions was first promulgated by C.W. Leadbeater and continued by Guy Ballard and Elizabeth Clare Prophet) The Great Silent Watchers Page 122&lt;/ref&gt; ); the '''Lords of Karma''' – Alice A. Bailey mentioned three ''Lords of Karma'' but did not name them; they are called in the Ascended Master Teachings the '''Karmic Board''' and they are stated to number seven and each of them is identified by name: '''The Great Divine Director''' (1st ray), '''The Goddess of Liberty''' (2nd ray), '''[[Lady Master Nada]]''' (3rd ray), '''Cyclopea''' (4th ray), '''[[Athena|Pallas Athena]]''' (5th ray), '''Lady Master Portia''' (6th ray), and '''[[Kwan Yin]]''' (7th ray).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.empyreanquest.com/liberty.htm Identity of the seven members of the Karmic Board according to the Ascended Master Teachings—The Goddess of Liberty, Kwan Yin, Pallas Athena, The Great Divine Director, Cyclopea, Nada, and Portia:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118080316/http://www.empyreanquest.com/liberty.htm |date=18 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press, pages 153–155 The Karmic Board&lt;/ref&gt;  The Karmic Board decides when [[soul]]s that are between lives are to reincarnate again (if a disembodied soul desires to reincarnate somewhere or somewhen else than where they have been assigned, they must file an appeal with the Karmic Board—each person has to file an appeal to the member of the board that handles the appeals for their ''soul ray''); and the one Alice A. Bailey calls the '''Custodian of the Hall of Records''' (called the '''Keeper of the Scrolls''' in the Ascended Master Teachings), the being who is in charge of the ''Hall of Records'', an enormous administrative complex near Sanat Kumara’s palace in the etheric city of Shamballa—this is where the ''Recording Angels'' and those souls who are between incarnations who volunteer to give up their time in [[The Summerland#Summerland in Theosophy|Summerland]] and help perform this work make visual records (utilizing the most advanced [[supercomputers]] on the etheric plane of Earth) of everything that happens in everyone’s lives on Earth.  The raw [[data]] is first downloaded daily by ''The Watcher'' from the [[Akashic records]] and fed by him to the ''Custodian of the Hall of Records'' and thence forwarded to the ''recording angels'' and their volunteer helpers.  These [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] records are sorted daily first into one of seven general files by the ''soul ray'' (see [[seven rays]]) of the soul that is reincarnating, and then downloaded from that general file into a special individual file for each soul that can be consulted by the ''Karmic Board'' if that soul makes an appeal before it.

==Omri-Tas, Ruler of the Violet Planet==

'''Omri-Tas''', the ''Ruler of the Violet Planet'', is a [[Milky Way Galaxy|Galactic]] level Ascended Master ('''[[Spiritual Hierarchy]], Cosmic Beings''') who with his celestial mate, Irmo-Sat, [http://www.sintoniasaintgermain.com.br/elohim_of_aquariuslrg_.jpg],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sintoniasaintgermain.com.br/cosmicos_setimo.htm Source of Image of Omri-Tas, Ruler of the Violet Planet and his Twin Flame – "Sintonia / Saint Germain". Portuguese language Ascended Master Teachings website:]&lt;/ref&gt; is Sanat Kumara's [[Ascended Master Teachings#Violet Flame|violet flame]] supplier.  The violet flame is composed of a special type of [[Occult Chemistry (book)|etheric matter particles]], which may plausibly be called ''violetrons'',  that are capable of cleansing bad [[karma]].   ''Omri-Tas'' rules a planet on the [[etheric plane]] called the Violet Planet, which is apparently several dozen to several hundred [[light year]]s from Earth.  The Violet Planet is one of many throughout the Cosmos that serve as reservoirs for the violet flame.  Omri-Tas is the ruler of the Violet Planet that is closest to Earth and which is responsible for transmitting the violet flame from the [[Spiritual Hierarchy|'''Great Central Sun''']] of the Cosmos via the '''Galactic Logos''' to planets in [[Spiritual Hierarchy|Ursa Major (Our sector is reputedly 'Sector Nine' of the 48 Sectors in this spiral Galaxy)]].  Omri-Tas or one of his representatives periodically teleports from the Violet Planet to Shamballa with canisters of violet flame to replenish the violet flame in the large circular pool in the ''Temple of the Violet Flame'' in Shamballa (In return for the violet flame. Lord Sanat Kumara assigns to his care and tutelage worthy initiated Adepts/Chelas for etheric transport to their next assignments.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press, pages 249–253 Omri-Tas, Ruler of the Violet Planet&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benjamin Creme's views==
[[Benjamin Creme]] subscribes to the modern esoteric view that [[Nordic aliens]] (like those mentioned by [[George Adamski]] – Creme accepts Adamski's sightings as valid.) pilot [[flying saucer]]s from the Way-Station on Venus that is thought to exist on the [[etheric plane]] (Esotericists believe that since the Venusians' civilization is on the ''etheric plane'', the planet's [[heat]] doesn't affect them) and are capable of stepping down the level of vibration of themselves and their craft to the slower level of vibration of the atoms of the [[physical plane]].&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''The Reappearance of the Christ and the Masters of the Wisdom'' London:1980 Tara Press Page 205&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Creme's followers assume that Sanat Kumara and the 'Lords of the Flame' [See Elizabeth Van Buren's Book of the same name.](Nordic aliens themselves) visit from Venus in a flying saucer. How, they ask, did Sanat Kumara get to Earth from Venus if it wasn't on a flying saucer?  Creme's disciples believe that there is regular flying saucer traffic between Venus and Shamballa as well as other locations on Earth, especially areas where [[crop circles]] appear.  Creme's acolytes believe that Shamballa is equipped with an [[Spaceport|astrodrome]] as well as with numerous flying saucer landing pads attached to the tops or the sides of the buildings to accommodate the heavy flying saucer traffic from Venus.  Since Shamballa is envisioned as a [[floating city (science fiction)|floating city]] about five miles above the surface of the earth on the etheric plane, there are also numerous entrances in the basements of the buildings, where flying saucers can enter from the bottom of the city and park in spacious flying saucer parking garages provided in the basement levels of the buildings. In addition, says Creme, the Venusians have cigar-shaped [[mother ship]]s up to four miles long to accommodate the transport of multiple individual flying saucers to and from Venus.&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''The Great Approach'' Amsterdam:2001 Share International Foundation Page 133&lt;/ref&gt; According to Creme, sometimes flying saucers from places more distant than Venus, such as from [[Mars]], the [[Moons of Jupiter]], [[Uranus]], [[Sirius]], the [[Pleiades]], and beyond, fly in to pay a visit at Shamballa.  Since, according to Creme, the Venusians flying saucer designers outsource the actual construction of their flying saucers to the [[Martians]] (who are said to dwell on the etheric plane of Mars),&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission – Volume III'' Amsterdam:1997 Share International Foundation Page 337&lt;/ref&gt; whom he describes as the "master engineers of the [[solar system]]",&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission – Volume III'' Amsterdam:1997 Share International Foundation Page 194&lt;/ref&gt; Shamballa provides a convenient neutral ground where the Venusians and the Martians can meet to evaluate new flying saucer designs and negotiate flying saucer construction contracts between themselves.

==Ashtar Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet==
The Master [[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)|Ashtar]] was first incorporated into the Ascended Master Teachings by [[Joshua David Stone]] in the early 1990s, based on his incorporation of the early 1980s revelations of the medium [[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)#Tuella|Tuella]] into his own teachings. Stone had already begun teaching in 1993, based on the early 1980s revelations of Tuella, that the [[Master Jesus]], under his [[Milky Way Galaxy|galactic]] name '''Sananda''' (the name, Stone stated, he adopted after his resurrection), works with '''[[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)|Commander Ashtar]]''', flying with '''[[Pallas Athena]]''' in their own flying saucer within the [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings said to be patrolling near Earth|Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet]] as its ''Commander-in-Chief''.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Joshua David ''Cosmic Ascension: Your Cosmic Map Home'' (March 1998) (Book 6 of the multi-volume series, The Easy-To-Read Encyclopedia of the Spiritual Path) {{ISBN|0-929385-99-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stone, another name used by ''Commander Ashtar'' to denote his flying saucer fleet is ''The Airborne Division of the Great White Brotherhood''. Although the Ashtar Command is ultimately under the titular authority of Sanat Kumara, the Master Jesus in consultation with Pallas Athena and Ashtar, make all the day to day command decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iamuniversity.org/iamu/mobile/literature/lodges/spiritual_extraterrestrials_lodge/3661-The-Ashtar-Command.html The Ashtar Command by Joshua David Stone:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227160744/http://www.iamuniversity.org/iamu/mobile/literature/lodges/spiritual_extraterrestrials_lodge/3661-The-Ashtar-Command.html |date=27 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone continued to present these teachings after 1996 at the yearly Wesak Mount Shasta gatherings.

According to some, The Ashtar Command is simply a modern concept of the Sumerian/Babylonian goddess and deity [[Astarte]]/[[Ishtar]]/[[Isis]] and her entourage whose assigned function is to protect an evolving mankind from the [[Satan|Satanic forces]], then extant, on this planet, that sought to usurp the Earthly Regency of the local Ascended Masters in their role of protecting and engendering Divine Law upon the Earth until the arrival, at 'The Meridian of Time' of 'The [[Son of God]]'... Jesus/Sananda and his incarnation of 'The Christ Being'.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Al Daoud.'' [By 'The Pen'. 1930].&lt;/ref&gt;

Lourene Altiery, also known as ''Karita'' to her followers, is an Ascended Master Teachings teacher originally from [[Joliet, Illinois]] who now resides in [[Sun Lakes, Arizona]] – she set up her website in 2001.  According to Altiery, there are four Masters originally from the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] Cosmic beings said to be patrolling near [[Earth|Ashtar Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet]] who are now permanently stationed on Shamballa.  These are the Masters '''Ballerian''', who is the proprietor of a flying saucer repair facility in Shamballa called ''God's Garage''; '''Kumad''', an expert [[linguist]] who helps the Keeper of the Scrolls decipher and interpret ancient manuscripts; '''Ashlem''',  a [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] Master who resides at the Hall of Records and helps people decipher their past lives by assisting them in accessing the [[Akashic records]]; and '''Sutko''', the "space detective", who helps the Master K-17 solve unusually difficult cases.  Elements of the ''[[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)|Ashtar]] Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet'' sometimes dock at Shamballa so the flying saucer crews can go on '[[shore leave]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Altiery, Lourene (Karita) ''The World's Greatest Teachings by Christ the Master and Other Avatars, Telepathically Communicated to Karita 2002'' {{ISBN|0-9718008-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serversofall.com/ Servers of All web page (Lourene Altiery)—Images of the cosmic beings described above in the mid-level command hierarchy of the Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet are depicted on this web page:]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hatonn and the Photon Belt==

According to the Ascended Master Teachings of Anne Bellringer of [[Rapid City, South Dakota]], who began teaching in 1990, '''Hatonn''', an [[android (robot)|android]] [[Pleiadean]] Master who flies aboard the flying saucer ''Phoenix'' (one of the flying saucers of the ''Ashtar Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet'', piloted by Hatonn’s partner the Master '''Soltec'''), monitors events on Earth for the ''Galactic Hall of Records'' at the [[galactic Center|galactic core]].

He feeds information about events on Earth via [[Subspace radio|subspace relay]] to the [[supercomputer]]s at the "Galactic Hall of Records".  However, Bellringer says that this activity is secondary to Hatonn's primary task, which is functioning as the [[liaison officer]] between Sanat Kumara and the [[Pleiadeans]] in order for him to be able to help Earth safely navigate in [[2012 phenomenon|2012]] through the approaching so-called "[[photon belt]]", said to emanate from the [[Pleiades]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hatonnspeaksthetruth.wordpress.com/2010/01/25/hatonn-introduction-to-the-photon-belt/ Hatonn and the Photon Belt:]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fourwinds10.com/siterun_static/general/about_fourwinds.php Four Winds10.com—website of Anne Bellringer:]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian criticism==

According to many Christians, notably the anti-[[New Age]] author [[Constance Cumbey]], New Age Leaders, including Masters of the [[Illuminati]], are actually worshipping the Lord of this World, whose name is Sanat Kumara (Alice Bailey, ''Externalisation of the Hierarchy'', p.&amp;nbsp;676, 709, 725; and Elizabeth Van Buren, ''The Secret of the Illuminati'', p.&amp;nbsp;1). Bailey goes on to explain that Sanat Kumara is the "life and the forming intelligence", presiding over the Council of Shamballa [the Heaven of Earth according to New Age doctrine]. (''The New Age Dictionary'', p.&amp;nbsp;172) Further, Sanat Kumara is "the eternal youth from the Planet [[Venus]]". The name Lucifer is one of the ancient Greek names for Venus. Therefore, according to Cumbey, Sanat Kumara is merely another name for [[Satan]] or [[Lucifer]]. (Cumbey, ''Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow'') [7].

==Theosophical reply to Christian criticism==
Other [[New Age]] leaders have tried to separate themselves from the Illuminati movement, and view that burdening the two groups as entirely coexistent is inaccurate and ineffectual. New Age theosophy also counters these critics, teaching the fact that the being known as Sanat Kumara would rather see spiritual harmony and peace, a fact which many Illuminati members ignore and abuse.

In the glossary of in the back of the book ''Alchemy'', which [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] claims was dictated to her by [[Kuthumi]], Satan and Sanat Kumara are clearly distinguished as two different and opposed beings—Satan working for evil and Sanat Kumara for good.&lt;ref&gt;"Kuthumi" (dictated to [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]]) ''Alchemy'' 1982 Summit Lighthouse See glossary at end of book&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skeptical view==
The scholar [[K. Paul Johnson]] maintains that the "Masters" that [[Madame Blavatsky]] wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her [[mentor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul K. Initiates of Theosophical Masters Albany, New York:1995 State University of New York Press&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Sanat Kumara'', although mentioned in passing by Madame Blavatsky, was never mentioned by her as an important "Master" that Blavatsky claimed to have met.  He was first presented, under the name ''Lord of the World'', as the head of the "Masters" by [[C.W. Leadbeater]] in his 1925 book ''The Masters and the Path''.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanat Kumara in popular culture==

'''[[Panelology]]'''
*Sanat Kumara’s helper ''The Watcher'' was apparently made into a [[Marvel Comics]] character called [[Uatu]] by [[Stan Lee]] in 1963. The [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher comic books]] have tales about a special race of beings talented at [[information processing]] called ''The Watchers'' spread throughout the [[Cosmos]], and it is believed in Theosophy and the Ascended Master Teachings that The Watcher belongs to.{{citationeeded|date=January 2016}}
'''Video games'''
*Sanat Kumara is the name of Helena Blavatsky's Noble Phantasm in ''[[Fate/Grand Order]]''. It takes the form of a flying saucer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1423">'''Simhika''', or '''Sinhika''', was the daughter of Demon king [[Hiranyakashipu]] and was the sister of the [[Vishnu]] devotee Bhakt [[Prahlada]]. She is also considered as the mother of [[Svarbhānu]], who was beheaded into two by Lord Vishnu into [[Rahu]], the head part and [[Ketu (mythology)|Ketu]], the remaining body.

==Simhika in Ramayana and her death==
Simhika got the boon from [[Brahma]] that she can control anyone's shadow. Later, she controlled Devi [[Chhaya]], mother of Lord [[Shani]] and wife of [[Surya]], the sun god. And eventually got defeated by Shani and [[Hanuman]]. Simhika was forgiven by monkey god, Hanuman, but Hanuman told her that whenever he finds her in later phase of life he'll kill her. Later, when Hanuman was climbing the ocean to [[Lanka]], the kingdom of Demon [[Ravana]], Simhika was hiding in the ocean and captured Hanuman's shadow, Hanuman jumped into her mouth and came out tearing her stomach, ending the life of Simhika.

A '''slave name''' is the [[personal name]] given by others to an [[slavery|enslaved]] person, or a name inherited from enslaved ancestors. The modern use of the term applies mostly to [[African Americans]] and [[Afro-Caribbean|West Indians]] who are descended from enslaved Africans who retain their name given to their ancestors by the enslavers.

Changing from a slave name to a name embodying an [[Africanization|African identity]] became common after [[emancipation]] in the 1960s by those in the [[African diaspora in the Americas]] seeking a reconnection to their African cultural roots.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Ancient Rome==
{{Slavery}}
In Rome slaves were given a single name by their owner. A slave who was [[manumission|freed]] might keep his or her slave name and adopt the former owner's name as a [[praenomen]] and [[Roman naming conventions|nomen]]. As an example, one historian says that "a man named Publius Larcius freed a male slave named Nicia, who was then called Publius Larcius Nicia."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vroma.org/~bmcmanus/roman_names.html Roman Nomenclature at vroma.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Harold Whetstone Johnston]] writes of instances in which a slave's former owner chose to ignore custom and simply chose a name for the [[freedman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forumromanum.org/life/johnston_2.html#60 Johnson, Harold Whetstone; Johnston, Mary; Names of Freedmen; 1903, 1932; forumromanum.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==African Americans==

A number of African-Americans and [[Afro-Caribbeans]] have changed their names out of the belief that the names they were given at birth were slave names. An individual's name change often coincides with a religious conversion ([[Muhammad Ali]] changed his name from Cassius Clay, [[Malcolm X]] from Malcolm Little, and [[Louis Farrakhan]] changed his from Louis Eugene Walcott, for example)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Louis Farrakhan Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/louis-farrakhan-9291850|work=Database|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Muhammad Ali Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/muhammad-ali-9181165|work=Database|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or involvement with the [[black nationalist]] movement (e.g., [[Amiri Baraka]] and [[Assata Shakur]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Van Deburg|Deburg, William L. Van]], "Modern Black Nationalism: From Marcus Garvey to Louis Farrakhan",  NYU Press (1997), p 269, {{ISBN|0-8147-8789-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organizations encourage African-Americans to abandon their slave names. The [[Nation of Islam]] is perhaps the best-known of them. In his book, ''[[Message to the Blackman in America]]'', Nation of Islam leader [[Elijah Muhammad]] writes often of slave names. Some of his comments include:

* "''You must remember that slave-names will keep you a slave in the eyes of the civilized world today. You have seen, and recently, that Africa and Asia will not honor you or give you any respect as long as you are called by the white man's name.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seventhfam.com/temple/books/black_man/blk24.htm [[Muhammad, Elijah]]; ''Message to the Blackman''; Chapter 24; seventhfam.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
* "''You are still called by your slave-masters' names. By rights, by international rights, you belong to the white man of America. He knows that. You have never gotten out of the shackles of slavery. You are still in them.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seventhfam.com/temple/books/black_man/blk34.htm Muhammad, Elijah; ''Message to the Blackman''; Chapter 34; seventhfam.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Black nationalism|black nationalist]] [[US Organization]] also advocates for African-Americans to change their slave names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.us-organization.org/nguzosaba/NguzoSaba.html "NGUZO SABA (The Seven Principles)" From : US Organization website]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Theosophy}}

'''St. Germain''' (also sometimes referred to as '''Master Rakoczi''' or '''Master R''') is a legendary spiritual master of the ancient wisdom in various [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] and post-Theosophical teachings, responsible for the [[New Age]] culture of the [[Age of Aquarius]] and identified with the '''[[Count of St. Germain]]''' (''[[floruit|fl.]]'' 1710–1784), who has been variously described as a [[courtier]], [[adventurer]], [[charlatan]], inventor, [[Alchemy|alchemist]], pianist, violinist and amateur composer.

==Legend==
Some write that his name St. Germain was invented by him as a French version of the Latin ''[[Sanctus Germanus]]'', meaning "Holy Brother".&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'' Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004, pages 250 – 255&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K.. ''Law of Life – Book II''. Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications 1989, pages 254 – 267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Annice ''The Masters and Their Retreats '' Summit Lighthouse Library June 2003, pages 312 – 322&lt;/ref&gt; In the Ascended Master Teachings (but not in traditional Theosophy), the ''Master R'', or the ''Master Rakóczi'', is a separate and distinct being from St. Germain.

==Literature about St. Germain==

===Biographies===
There are several "authoritative" biographers who usually do not agree with one another. Probably the two best-known biographies are [[Isabel Cooper-Oakley]]'s ''The Count of St. Germain'' (1912) and [[Jean Overton-Fuller]]'s ''The Comte de Saint-Germain: Last Scion of the House of Rakoczy'' (1988). The former is a compilation of letters, diaries and private records written about the Count by members of the French aristocracy who knew him in the 18th century. Dr. Raymond Bernard's book ''The Great Secret – St. Germain'' is biographical and covers many aspects of the Count's life including his conflation with Sir [[Francis Bacon]] and the author of the [[Shakespeare]]an opus. [[Manly Palmer Hall]] in his ''[[Manly Palmer Hall#Works|The Secret Teachings of All Ages]]'', describes some of the same attributes as Dr. Bernard, including the attribution of the writings of Shakespeare to a great adept like Francis Bacon, who could be amalgamated with the Count of St. Germain.

There have also been numerous French and German biographies, among them ''Der Wiedergänger: Das zeitlose Leben des Grafen von Saint-Germain'' by [[Peter Krassa]], ''Le Comte de Saint-Germain'' by [[Marie-Raymonde Delorme]] and ''L'énigmatique Comte De Saint-Germain'' by [[Pierre Ceria]] and [[François Ethuin]].

===Occult biography===
A book titled ''The Great Secret, Count St. Germain'', by Dr. Raymond Bernard purports that St. Germain was actually [[Francis Bacon]] by birth, and later [[Baconian theory|authored the complete Plays attributed to Shakespeare]]. He also contends, as does the [[Saint Germain Foundation]] in Schaumburg, Illinois, that [[Francis Bacon]] was the child of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] and [[Lord Dudley]] but that it was kept quiet. According to the theory, Francis was raised by the Bacon family. Yet, throughout the [[Shakespeare]]an canon, there are numerous hints that the author knows of his true birth, as revealed in the explicit clues in the text of the plays themselves, in pictures, as well as the [[Bacon's cipher|cipher code that he employed]].

===Books claimed by Guy Ballard to have been dictated to him by Saint Germain===
Saint Germain is the central figure in the Saint Germain Series of Books published by the Saint Germain Press (the publishing arm of the Saint Germain Foundation). The first two volumes, ''Unveiled Mysteries'' and ''The Magic Presence'', written by [[Guy Ballard]] as "Godfré Ray King" describe Saint Germain as an [[Ascended master|Ascended Master]], like [[Master Jesus|Jesus]], who is assisting humanity. In these first two books, he discusses his personal experiences with Saint Germain and reveals many teachings that are in harmony with [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and some other works referenced above. The third volume, ''The 'I AM' Discourses'', contains material that is foundational to the [[sacred scripture]]s of the "I AM" Religious Activity, founded in 1930, the first of the Ascended Master Teachings religions.

There are 20 Volumes in the Saint Germain Series of Books, which are also referred to as the "Green Books." Another work of great importance, the ''[[Comte de Gabalis]]'', is said to be from the hand of Sir Francis Bacon before he Ascended and returned as Sanctus Germanus or Saint Germain. First printed in 1670, the book includes a picture of the Polish Rider, [[Rembrandt]]'s famous painting at the [[Frick Collection]] in New York City, which is said to be of Sir Francis Bacon, ''a.k.a.'' the [[Comte de Gabalis]], or the Count of the [[Kabbalah|Cabala]]. Lotus Ray King (Edna Ballard's pen name), wife of [[Guy Ballard]], talked about this book having been authored by the Ascended Master Saint Germain in the Round Table Talks of the "I AM" Religious Activity.

===Claimed encounters with Saint Germain===
Several [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]] and practitioners of alternate esoteric traditions have claimed to have met Saint Germain in the late 19th or early 20th centuries: 
* [[Annie Besant]] said that she met the Count in 1896.
* [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|C. W. Leadbeater]] claimed to have met him in Rome in 1926 and gave a physical description of him as having [[brown eyes]], [[Olive skin|olive colored skin]], and a pointed beard; according to Leadbeater, "the splendour of his Presence impels men to make obeisance".&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1927 (Revised from 1925 edition) (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Page 32&lt;/ref&gt; Leadbeater said that Saint Germain showed him a robe that had been previously owned by a [[Roman Emperor]] and that Saint Germain told him that one of his residences was a [[castle]] in [[Transylvania]]. According to Leadbeater, when performing [[Incantations|magical rituals]] in his castle in Transylvania, Saint Germain wears "a suit of golden chain-mail which once belonged to a [[Roman Emperor]]; over it is thrown a magnificent cloak of [[Tyrian purple]], with on its clasp a [[heptagram|seven-pointed star]] in diamond and [[amethyst]], and sometimes he wears a glorious robe of violet."&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1927 (Revised from 1925 edition) (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Page 240&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Guy Ballard]], founder of the [["I AM" Activity]], claimed that he met Saint Germain on [[Mount Shasta]] in California in August 1930, and that this initiated his "training" and experiences with other [[Ascended master|Ascended Masters]] in various parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;King, Godfre Ray. ''Unveiled Mysteries''. Chicago, Illinois: Saint Germain Press 1934&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Edgar Cayce]], the "Sleeping Prophet", was asked while in trance if Saint Germain was present. Cayce's reply was: "When needed." (From reading # 254–83 on 2/14/1935.)
* [[Dorothy Leon]], living author, has claimed to have had several encounters with Saint Germain and is an avowed disciple of his.
* [[Miroslav Zimmer]], living poet, claim to have met St Germain in the Mala Fatry mountains in 2011 in the company of a Sam Bennett.
* [[David Narozny]], living Czech music composer, claims to have met St Germain in Pruhonice 23.5.2014.
*[[Peter Mt. Shasta]], living spiritual teacher, claims that in 1973 St. Germain materialized before him in Muir Woods, Marin County, California, USA. He describes this meeting in ''Apprentice to the Masters: Adventures of a Western Mystic, Book II''. He also claims to have had many other physical as well as etheric meeting with him as well as other Masters.
*[[David Christopher Lewis]], living spiritual teacher, claims that Saint Germain first came to him in person on June 10, 2004 in his home in Paradise Valley, Montana and continued to come many times thereafter, dictating what is now in the book: Saint Germain on Advanced Alchemy: HeartStreaming in the Aquarian Age .&lt;ref&gt;"SAINT GERMAIN ON ADVANCED ALCHEMY" (Meru Press, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Esoteric activities===
Many groups honor Saint Germain as a [[supernatural being]] called a Master of the Ancient Wisdom or an [[Ascended master]]. In the Ascended Master Teachings he is referred to simply as Saint Germain, or as the Ascended Master Saint Germain. As an Ascended Master, Saint Germain is believed to have many [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] powers such as the ability to teleport, [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitate]], walk through walls, and to inspire people by [[telepathy]], among others.

The Theosophical Society after Blavatsky's death considered him to be a [[Mahatma]], Masters of the Ancient Wisdom or Adept. [[Helena Blavatsky]] said that he was one of her Masters of Wisdom and hinted that he had given her secret documents. Some [[esotericism|esoteric]] groups credit him with inspiring the [[Founding Fathers]] to draft the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] and the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], as well as providing the design of the [[Great Seal of the United States]]. (See [[Hall, Manly P.|Manly Palmer Hall]]'s ''Secret Teachings of All Ages.'')&lt;ref&gt;[[Hall, Manly P.]] ''The Secret Teachings of All Ages'' "An Encyclopedic Outline of Masonic, Hermetic, Qabbalistic and Rosicrucian Symbolical Philosophy Being an Interpretation of the Secret Teachings Concealed within the Rituals, Allegories and Mysteries of all Ages" H.S. Crocker Company, Inc. 1928 See chapter on "St. Germain"&lt;/ref&gt; In [[New Age]] beliefs, Saint Germain is always associated with the color violet, the jewel [[amethyst]], and the ''[[Maltese cross]]'' rendered in violet (usually the ''iron cross style cross patee'' version). He is also regarded as the "Chohan of the Seventh Ray"&lt;ref&gt;"Saint Germain" (claimed to have been dictated by St. Germain to [[Mark Prophet]]) ''Studies in Alchemy'' Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA: 1974 Summit Lighthouse. See occult biographical (actually [[Hagiography|hagiographical]]) sketch of Saint Germain, pages 80–90 (The original edition of this book is printed in violet type on cream colored paper.)&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[The Theosophical Society]], the [[Seven Rays]] are seven metaphysical principles that govern both individual souls and the unfolding of each 2,158-year-long [[Astrological Age]]. Since according to Theosophy the next [[Astrological Age]], the [[Age of Aquarius]], will be governed by the Seventh (Violet) Ray (the Ray of Ceremonial Order), Saint Germain is sometimes called "The Hierarch of the Age of Aquarius".  According to the Ascended Master Teachings, Saint Germain is "The God of Freedom for [[Solar system|this system of worlds]]."  According to the Ascended Master Teachings, the preliminary lead-up to the beginning of the Age of Aquarius began on 1 July 1956, when Ascended Master Saint Germain became the Hierarch of the Age of Aquarius, replacing the former [[Astrological age|Astrological Age]] Hierarch, the Ascended Master Jesus, who had been for almost 2,000 years the "Hierarch of the [[Age of Pisces]]".

In the works authored by Alice A. Bailey, Saint Germain is called ''Master Rakóczi'' or the ''Master R.''&lt;ref name=fire1237&gt;Bailey, Alice A, '' A Treatise on Cosmic Fire'' (Section Three – Division A – Certain Basic Statements), 1932, Lucis Trust. 1925, p 1237&lt;/ref&gt;  (In the Ascended Master Teachings, the Master Rakoczi [ otherwise known as the Great Divine Director ] is regarded as Saint Germain's teacher in the Great White Brotherhood of Ascended Masters.) Alice A. Bailey's book ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' (a compilation of earlier revelations published posthumously in 1957) gives the most information about his reputed role as a Spiritual Master. Saint Germain's spiritual title is said to be ''Lord of Civilization,'' and his task is the establishment of the new civilization of the Age of Aquarius.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957—Lucis Press (Compilation of earlier [[revelation]]s by Alice A. Bailey) Page 667&lt;/ref&gt; He is said to telepathically influence people who are seen by him as being instrumental in bringing about the new civilization of the Age of Aquarius. Alice A. Bailey stated that "sometime after AD 2025," the Jesus, the Master Rakóczi (Saint Germain), Kuthumi, and others in the Spiritual Hierarchy would "externalise"&lt;!--British spelling of externalize--&gt;, i.e., descend from the spiritual worlds, and interact in visible tangible bodies on the Earth in [[ashram]]s, surrounded by their disciples.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957—Lucis Press (Compilation of earlier revelations by Alice A. Bailey) Page 530&lt;/ref&gt; Alice A. Bailey said that St. Germain is the "manager of the executive council of the Christ"&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957—Lucis Press (Compilation of earlier revelations by Alice A. Bailey) Page 508&lt;/ref&gt;(Theosophists regard "the Master Jesus" and "Christ" as two separate and distinct beings.  They believe in the [[Gnostic]] [[Christology]] espoused by [[Cerinthus]] (''fl.'' c. 100 AD), according to which "Christ" is a being who was incarnated in Jesus only during the three years of the [[ministry of Jesus]]). According to certain Theosophists, "Christ" is identified as being a highly developed spiritual entity whose actual name is Maitreya. This Maitreya is the same being known in Buddhism as the Bodhisattva Maitreya, who is in training to become the next Buddha on Earth. According to Alice A. Bailey, the "executive council of the Christ" is a specific subgroup of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom, charged with preparing the way for the [[Second Coming]] of Christ and the consequent inauguration of the Age of Aquarius.

===Previous incarnations===
According to [[The Theosophical Society]] (not to be confused with the [[United Lodge of Theosophists]]) and the [[Ascended Master Teachings]], Saint Germain was incarnated as: (see notes 1, 2, and 3 for sources): (Note: Not all Theosophical and Ascended Master Teaching groups accept all of these incarnations as valid. St. Germain's incarnations as St. Alban, Proclus, Roger Bacon and Sir Francis Bacon are universally accepted.)

* Ruler of a [[Root race#Early beginnings of the Aryan root race|Golden Age civilization centered in a city called "The City of the Sun"]] 70,000 years ago located in the then lush and verdant area that is now the [[Sahara Desert]], originally a colony sent out from [[Root race#The civilization of Atlantis|Atlantis]].
* High priest in [[Root race#The civilization of Atlantis|the civilization of Atlantis]] 13,000 years ago, serving in the ''Order of Lord Zadkiel'' in the ''Temple of Purification'', located in an Atlantean colony that had been sent out from the main island of [[Atlantis]] that had been established on the island now called [[Cuba]].
* [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]], 11th-century BC religious leader in Israel who served as prophet, priest, and last of the Hebrew judges.
* [[Hesiod]], Greek poet whose writings serve as a major source of insight into Greek mythology and cosmology (c. 700 BC).
* [[Plato]], Philosopher who studied with students of Pythagoras and scholars in Egypt. He established his own school of philosophy at the Academy in Athens. (427–347 BC).
* [[St. Joseph|Saint Joseph]], 1st century AD, Nazareth. Husband of Mary and guardian of Jesus.
* [[Saint Alban]], late 3rd or early 4th century, town of Verulamium, renamed St. Albans, Hertfordshire, England. First British martyr – he had sheltered a fugitive priest, became a devout convert, and was put to death for disguising himself as the priest so that he could die in his place.
* [[Proclus]], c. 410 – 485 AD. Athens. The last major Greek Neoplatonic philosopher. He headed the Platonic Academy and wrote extensively on philosophy, astronomy, mathematics, and grammar.
* [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]], c. 5th or 6th century, Britain. Magician and counselor at King Arthur's Camelot who inspired the establishment of the Order of the Knights of the Round Table.
* [[Roger Bacon]], c. 1220–1292 AD, England. Philosopher, educational reformer, and experimental scientist. Forerunner of modern science renowned for his exhaustive investigations into alchemy, optics, mathematics, and languages.&lt;ref&gt;Although [[C.W. Leadbeater]] claims that Roger Bacon was a past incarnation of Saint Germain and the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] (the main Ascended Master Teachings religion) also accepts this, some sources and some Ascended Master Activities believe that Roger Bacon was a past incarnation of the Ascended Master [[Morya (Theosophy)|El Morya]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Organizer behind the scenes for the Secret Societies in Germany in the late 14th and early 15th centuries. The creation of a possibly fictional character named "[[Christian Rosenkreuz]]" was inspired by his efforts.
* [[Christopher Columbus]], 1451–1506 AD. Believed to have been born in Genoa, Italy and settled in Portugal. Landed in America in 1492 during the first of four voyages to the New World sponsored by [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella]] of Spain
* [[Francis Bacon]], 1561–1626, England. Philosopher, statesman, essayist and literary master, [[Baconian theory|author of the Shakespearean plays]] (according to the [[Ascended Master Teachings]]), father of inductive science, and herald of the [[scientific revolution]].

===Ascension into masterhood===
According to the Ascended Master Teachings, Francis Bacon made it appear that he died on Easter Sunday, 9 April 1626, and he even attended his own "funeral" in disguise.  It is believed by the adherents of the Ascended Master Teachings that he then traveled secretly to [[Transylvania]] (then part of [[Hungary]], now part of [[Romania]]) to the Rakoczy Mansion of the [[Rakóczi|royal family of Hungary]]. Finally on 1 May 1684 he is believed to have attained (by his knowledge of [[alchemy]]) his physical Ascension (attaining [[immortality]] and eternal youth [ the sixth level of Initiation]) at which time Francis Bacon adopted the name "Saint Germain."&lt;ref&gt;"Saint Germain" (claimed by the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] to have been [[Channeling (mediumistic)|dictated]] by Saint Germain to [[Mark Prophet]]) ''Studies in Alchemy'' Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA: 1974 Summit Lighthouse. See occult biologographical sketch of history of Saint Germain, pages 80–90&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skeptical view==
The scholar [[K. Paul Johnson]] maintains that the "Masters" that [[Madame Blavatsky]] wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her [[mentor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul K. Initiates of Theosophical Masters (Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Also see the article "Talking to the Dead and Other Amusements" by Paul Zweig ''New York Times'' 5 October 1980, which maintains that Madame Blavatsky's revelations were fraudulent.

'''The Bowery Boys''' are fictional [[New York City]] characters, portrayed by a [[repertory theater|company]] of New York actors, who were the subject of feature films released by [[Monogram Pictures]] from 1946 through 1958.

The Bowery Boys were successors of the "[[East Side Kids]]," who had been the subject of films since 1940. The group originated as the "[[Dead End Kids]]", who originally appeared in the 1937 film ''[[Dead End (1937 film)|Dead End]].'' A few of the actors previously appeared together as "[[Little Tough Guys|The Little Tough Guys]]."

==Origins==

===The Dead End Kids===
{{main|Dead End Kids}}
"The Dead End Kids" originally appeared in the 1935 play ''Dead End,'' dramatized by [[Sidney Kingsley]]. When [[Samuel Goldwyn]] turned the play into a [[Dead End (1937 film)|1937 film]], he recruited the original "kids" from the play—[[Leo Gorcey]], [[Huntz Hall]], [[Bobby Jordan]], [[Gabriel Dell]], [[Billy Halop]], and [[Bernard Punsly]]—to appear in the same roles in the film. This led to the making of six other films that shared the collective title "The Dead End Kids".

===The Little Tough Guys===
{{main|Little Tough Guys}}
In 1938, [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] launched its own tough-kid series, "[[Little Tough Guys]]." Gradually, Universal recruited most of the original Dead End Kids, so the series ultimately featured "[[The Dead End Kids]] and [[Little Tough Guys]]." Universal made twelve feature films, and three 12-chapter serials with the gang. The final film in Universal's series, ''[[Keep 'Em Slugging]],'' was released in 1943, with [[Bobby Jordan]] replacing erstwhile ringleader [[Billy Halop]].

===The East Side Kids===
{{main|East Side Kids}}
When Warner Brothers released the remaining Dead End Kids from their contracts in 1939, producer [[Sam Katzman]] at Monogram acted quickly and hired several of them, including Jordan and the Gorcey brothers, Leo and David, as well as some of the Little Tough Guys, including Hally Chester, to star in a new series using the team name "The East Side Kids."  These films also introduced [[Sammy Morrison|'Sunshine' Sammy Morrison]], one of the original members of the [[Our Gang]] comedy team, as part of the gang.

The original members of the "Dead End Kids" were now working at several studios, so these films were made at the same time that Universal was making "The Dead End Kids" and "Little Tough Guys" series. A total of 21 films were made, with the final one, ''Come Out Fighting'', released in 1945.

==The Bowery Boys==

In 1945, when East Side Kids producer Katzman refused to grant Leo Gorcey's request to double his weekly salary, Gorcey quit the series, which then ended immediately. Bobby Jordan then suggested a meeting with his agent, Jan Grippo. Grippo, Gorcey, and Hall formed Jan Grippo Productions, revamped the format, and rechristened the series ''The Bowery Boys.'' (The earlier films's credits appear as "Leo Gorcey ''and'' The Bowery Boys".) Gorcey, who owned 40 percent of the company, starred, produced, and contributed to the scripts. The new series followed a more established formula than the prior incarnations of the team, with the gang usually hanging out at Louie's Sweet Shop (at 3rd &amp; Canal St.) until an adventure came along.

The original main characters were Terrence Aloysius "Slip" Mahoney ([[Leo Gorcey]]), Horace Debussy "Sach" Jones ([[Huntz Hall]]), Bobby ([[Bobby Jordan]]), Whitey ([[William "Billy" Benedict|Billy Benedict]]), and Chuck ([[David Gorcey]], sometimes billed as David Condon). [[Ernest Morrison|"Sunshine" Sammy Morrison]], "Scruno" in the East Side Kids films, declined the invitation to rejoin the gang. (He later stated in an interview that he "didn't like the setup", possibly referring to the idea of Gorcey and Hall being in the forefront, and being paid much more than the other members.) When Bobby Jordan quit the series for the same reason, his character was replaced by Butch Williams, with former East Side Kids [[Bennie Bartlett]] and [[Buddy Gorman]] alternating in the role. The proprietor of the malt shop where they hung out was the panicky Louie Dumbrowski ([[Bernard Gorcey]], Leo's and David's real-life father).

Like the previous incarnations of the team, the members went through a number of changes over the course of the series. Thirteen actors were members of the team at one time or another. Bobby Jordan, an original Dead End Kid, appeared in the first eight films, but left after being injured in an elevator accident. Jordan was also unhappy with the direction of the series, which favored Gorcey and Hall, and limited the participation of the other gang members.

[[Gabriel Dell]] returned in the fourth entry, ''[[Spook Busters]]'' (1946), as "Gabe Moreno," a former member of the gang just out of the Navy with a French war-bride in tow. He remained (minus spouse) for the next 16 features. Gabe was a convenient "utility" character, frequently changing jobs (private investigator, policeman, songwriter, reporter, Nazi spy) to suit the story at hand—and the limited casting budget. Dell often acted as a bridge between the real world and those of the Boys who he would summon to assist him. He reprised one of his East Side Kids roles in ''[[Hard Boiled Mahoney]]'' (1947), playing Gabe as a myopic nerd with thick glasses, ascot and cap. His final appearance was in ''[[Blues Busters (1950 film)|Blues Busters]]'' in 1950, generally regarded as one of the funniest in the series.

The early films such as ''[[In Fast Company]]'' (1946) flirted with the same humor-laced crime drama of the previous series, but they gradually shifted to all-out comedy, growing more slapstick and fantasy-oriented over the next decade. After 1950, the series began to resemble the farcical [[Abbott and Costello]] comedies—a far cry from the grim social realism of their 1930s films. The grittiness of the old days was sanitized with the gang's dingy basement club-house replaced by an ice cream parlor. The "boys" also adopted a more adult look, exchanging their sloppy, juvenile wardrobe for suits.

The team spirit of the ensemble cast faded as Huntz Hall was elevated to co-star status to showcase his comedic skills. The stories now focused entirely on Slip (the self-proclaimed leader of the bunch) and his zany sidekick, Sach, with the diminished three or four "boys" receding into the background with little to do. Time and again the plot revolved around Sach accidentally acquiring some strange power or ability (he becomes a psychic, champion wrestler, crooner, etc.) that Slip is quick to exploit. In most of the films, the gang pursues a scheme for quick riches or gets mixed up with neighborhood thugs. Story elements from their earlier films (haunted houses, mad scientists, nefarious spies) were also frequently incorporated into the new series.

Like a streetwise [[Abbott and Costello]], Gorcey and Hall became a cohesive comedy duo, extending their verbal and physical humor into broader slapstick comedy that served to increase the popularity of the series.  In 1953, [[Edward Bernds]], a new producer and director who had previously worked with [[The Three Stooges]], transformed the series into lucrative kiddie-matinée fodder, with Gorcey and Hall re-enacting gags borrowed from the Stooges. (Huntz Hall cited [[Shemp Howard]], who had appeared in three Little Tough Guys films, as a major influence during this latter phase in the series.)

Leo's character "Slip" was famed for his [[malaprop]]s (always delivered in a [[Brooklyn accent]]), such as "a clever seduction" for "a clever deduction," "I depreciate it!" ("I appreciate it!"), and "I regurgitate" ("I reiterate").

In the 1940s, [[Abbott and Costello]] appeared in a quartet of "service comedies", one for each branch of the military. The Bowery Boys duplicated this feat a decade later with ''[[Bowery Battalion]],'' ''[[Let's Go Navy!]],'' ''[[Here Come the Marines]],'' and ''[[Clipped Wings (1953 film)|Clipped Wings]].'' Abbott and Costello spoofed westerns: ''[[Ride 'Em Cowboy (1942 film)|Ride 'Em Cowboy]]'' (1942), the upper-classes: ''[[In Society]]'' (1944), and hillbillies: ''[[Comin' Round the Mountain]]'' (1951). The Bowery Boys repeated this formula in ''[[Bowery Buckaroos]]'' (1947), ''[[High Society (1955 film)|High Society]]'' (1955), and ''[[Feudin' Fools]]'' (1952), respectively.

Abbott and Costello went on safari: ''[[Africa Screams]]'' (1949), to the Middle East: ''[[Lost in a Harem]]'' (1944), and even tangled with pirates in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd]]'' (1952). Once again, the Bowery Boys followed suit with ''[[Jungle Gents]]'' (1954), ''[[Bowery to Bagdad]]'' (1955), and ''[[Hold That Hypnotist]]'' (1957). Abbott and Costello become private detectives in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man]]'' (1951); the Bowery Boys open up a detective agency in 1953's ''Private Eyes''.

After Abbott and Costello's haunted-house comedy ''[[Hold That Ghost]]'' (1941) became a smash hit, the East Side Kids released the similar ''Spooks Run Wild'' with Bela Lugosi later that year. Lugosi went on to help make ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]],'' one of A&amp;C's most popular and critically acclaimed comedies. The basic premise, centered around Dracula's scheme to transplant Costello's brain into the Frankenstein monster (played by [[Glenn Strange]]), was duplicated a few months later by The Bowery Boys in ''[[Master Minds]]'' (1949). Glenn Strange once again plays a hulking monster who switches minds with Sach (Huntz Hall). With a title suggesting a send-up of the Abbott and Costello "Meet" films, ''[[The Bowery Boys Meet the Monsters]]'' (1954) was the highest grossing entry in the series.

After filming ''[[Dig That Uranium]]'' in 1955, Bernard Gorcey was killed in an automobile accident, devastating his son Leo, who began to drink heavily, and it visibly affected his performance in the following film, ''Crashing Las Vegas'', which was his last. (During filming, he became violently unhinged, trashing the set and destroying every prop in sight.{{cn|date=December 2017}}) At a subsequent meeting with Allied Artists, Gorcey demanded an increase on the 40% interest he held in the series. This was denied, and after a heated exchange, he quit the series and stormed off the studio lot.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

The studio owed exhibitors three more films for the 1956 season, so Gorcey was replaced by [[Stanley Clements]], a former tough-teen actor who had been in a few East Side Kids movies. Clements, as "Duke Coveleskie," adapted to the series easily and completed the three films, which now starred "Huntz Hall and The Bowery Boys." The new Hall-Clements partnership was successful enough to be renewed for the 1957 season. Four more films were made, with Eddie LeRoy joining the cast as bespectacled "Blinky." With Bernard Gorcey gone, Louie's Sweet Shop was replaced by Clancy's Cafe with a similarly put-upon proprietor, "Mike" ([[Percy Helton]], later played by [[Dick Elliott]]).

==Legacy==

In all, there were 48 Bowery Boys films, making it the longest feature-film series of American origin in motion picture history (only the Mexican ''[[El Santo|Santo]]'' film series ran longer), with the final film, ''[[In the Money]],'' being released in 1958. Only Huntz Hall and David Gorcey had remained with the series since 1946.&lt;ref&gt;''Me and the Dead End Kid,'' Leo Gorcey, Jr., Spirit of Hope Publishing, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bowery Boys and East Side Kids picked up a new generation of mostly younger fans when the films were repackaged and syndicated for television in the 1960s and 1970s. They became a staple for independent stations across the U.S., often used to fill up the early-afternoon time-slots on weekends.

They fought to have women legally considered persons so that women could be appointed to the Senate. The petition was filed on August 27, 1927,&lt;ref name="Alberta1999"&gt;{{cite book| title=Alberta History| volume=47–49| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jL06AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=famous+five+persons+case+august+27&amp;dq=famous+five+persons+case+august+27| accessdate=May 10, 2013| year=1999| publisher=Historical Society of Alberta}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on April 24, 1928, Canada's Supreme Court summarized its unanimous decision that women are not such "persons".&lt;ref name = Brennan/&gt;

The last line of the judgement reads, "Understood to mean 'Are women eligible for appointment to the [[Senate of Canada]],' the question is answered in the negative." This judgement was overturned by the British [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] on October 18, 1929. This case came to be known as the "[[Persons Case]]". Although Canadian women (those who were British/Canadian citizens) had the vote in many provinces and in federal elections by 1929, the case was part of a continent-wide drive for political equality, coming seven years after discrimination against women's voting rights was prohibited in the United States through the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], and thus had important ramifications.

Some saw this as "radical change"; others saw it as a restoration of the original framing of the English constitutional documents, including the [[1689 Bill of Rights]], which uses only the term "person", not the term "man" (or "woman" for that matter).

Some others have interpreted the Privy Council rule as causing a change in the Canadian judicial approach to the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]], an approach that has come to be known as the "[[living tree doctrine]]".

==The Five==
The famous five women were:

* [[Emily Murphy]] (1868–1933), the [[British Empire]]'s first female judge;
* [[Irene Parlby|Irene Marryat Parlby]] (1868–1965), farm women's leader, political activist and first female [[Cabinet minister]] in Alberta, still serving in that capacity at the time of the court case;
* [[Nellie McClung|Nellie Mooney McClung]] (1873–1951), a [[suffragist]] and author, member of the Alberta Legislature 1921–1926;
* [[Louise McKinney|Louise Crummy McKinney]] (1868–1931), the first woman elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]], or any legislature in Canada or the rest of the British Empire, but no longer MLA at the time of the court case;
* [[Henrietta Muir Edwards]] (1849–1931), an advocate for working women, author and a founding member of the [[Victorian Order of Nurses]].

===Emily Murphy===
{{Main|Emily Murphy}}
Emily Murphy stood out in the famous five, bringing them to a victory in 1929. Emily was appointed to the office of Magistrate of the Edmonton Juvenile Court in 1916 and later became the magistrate of the newly created Women's Court. At the time, no woman had held such a position and many men objected.&lt;ref name=MacEwan&gt;{{cite book |first=Grant| last=MacEwan| title=...and Mighty Women too: Stories of Notable Western Canadian Women| year=1975| publisher= Western Producer Prairie Books| isbn=978-0919306653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her career as a writer, Murphy used the pen name "Janey Canuck". In 1922, she wrote ''The Black Candle'' which detailed her beliefs on race and drug use in Canada and strongly influenced the drug policy of the day. Murphy came from a privileged background in which white women were protected from many topics.&lt;ref name="Millar"&gt;{{cite book |first=Nancy |last=Millar |title=The Famous Five: Five Canadian Women and Their Fight to Become Persons |year=1999 |publisher=Western Heritage Centre| isbn=978-0920109168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irene Parlby===
{{Main|Irene Parlby}}
In 1916, Irene Parlby was elected as the first president of the United Farm Women of Alberta and in 1921, was elected to the Alberta legislature and received a cabinet post in the United Farmers of Alberta government, becoming the second woman in the British Empire to hold ministerial rank. She served as cabinet minister until the downfall of the government in 1935. Parlby worked with the Red Cross during [[World War I]] and later served on the Board of Governors of the [[University of Alberta]].&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

Nellie McClung's jobs in her lifetime included teacher, author, public speaker, temperance activist, internationally known women's rights activist, and politician {Warne, Literature as Pulpit]. In 1918, she was a member of the Dominion War Council and the only woman representative at the League of Nations.  She represented Canada at the Ecumenical Council of the Methodist church in 1921 and was the first woman on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] Board of the Governors.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;  In 1921, McClung was elected to the Alberta legislature as an MLA in Edmonton for the Liberal Party.&lt;ref name=Millar/&gt; She served one term, not being re-elected in 1926. She was a member of the Political Equality League of Manitoba, and she played the leading role in the Mock Parliament held on January 29, 1914, at the Walker Theatre in Winnipeg, which humorously discussed Votes for Men.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

===Louise McKinney===
{{Main|Louise McKinney}}
Louise McKinney became one of the first two women elected to a legislature in the British Empire, and the first to take her seat. She was a founder of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] in Alberta and the West – she served as the organization's vice-president for more than 22 years beginning in 1906 – and regularly attended World Meetings of the WCTU. She signed the appeal to the Privy Council in 1929. In 1931, she became president of the Canadian Union, Woman's Christian Temperance Union. McKinney was also named to be Commissioner for the first General Council of the [[United Church of Canada]], and was the only woman to sign the Basis of Union.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

===Henrietta Muir Edwards===
{{Main|Henrietta Muir Edwards}}
Henrietta Muir Edwards, author and researcher on women's topics, held an influence within the National Council of Women&lt;ref name = Brennan/&gt; and held chairmanship of the Committee in Law in the National Council of Women for more than 35 years. She was also a Red Cross leader during the war years. Edwards was the secretary of the National Subcommittee which focused on thrift and economy in Canadian homes.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

===Honorary senators===
None of the five became [[Senate of Canada#Senators|senators]]; the first female senator was Quebecer [[Cairine Reay Wilson]], appointed four months after the ruling. Nearly 80 years later, on October 8, 2009, the Senate voted to make the five the first "honorary senators".&lt;ref name=cbc&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/story/2009/10/10/calgary-famous-five-honourary-senators.html |title='Famous 5' named honorary senators |work=[[CBC News]] |publisher=CBC.ca |date=October 10, 2009 |accessdate=May 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hansard&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/common/..%5C40%5C2%5Cparlbus%5Cchambus%5Csenate/deb-E/059db_2009-10-08-e.htm?Language=E&amp;Parl=40&amp;Ses=2#53|title=Senate of Canada – Debates|first=Senate of|last=Canada|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The achievement of personhood for women had been a monumental change which gave more power to women.

Some might well question the overall significance of the decision, noting that by the 1920s the Senate of Canada was a largely powerless body. The more powerful [[House of Commons of Canada]] had elected its first female member ([[Agnes Macphail]]) in 1921, well before the Persons Case. However, the precedent did establish the principle that women could hold any political office in Canada. Moreover, the Five clearly did devote their energies to increasing women's participation on legislative bodies with greater power: three had been members of the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|Alberta legislature]]. The controversy surrounding the women has made commemoration difficult.{{Citation needed|date = August 2012}} The five women were activists in a variety of areas in their pursuit to better the conditions for women and children.

===Opinions on the Famous Five===
Opinions on the Famous Five vary considerably. Many laud them as trailblazers for women. Others are disturbed by the opinions of some of the women on other issues, such as opposition to non-white immigration and their successful campaigns to have [[eugenics]] legislation introduced in Canadian provinces, which resulted in the sterilization of thousands of those deemed "mentally deficient" or "insane" in Alberta and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/eugenics-keeping-canada-sane-feature/&lt;/ref&gt; Emily Murphy was not shy with her opinions and her outspoken nature had a tendency to give her a negative reputation. She wrote letters of her opinions to police chiefs, government officials, social service agencies and judicial officials about the extent of drug traffic and possible cures. Nellie McClung was known as the most memorable and popular of the famous five. Her causes included women's right to vote, prohibition, women in the church and women in public life.&lt;ref name=Millar/&gt;  Henrietta Muir Edwards was described as "tenacious" with her work with prohibition.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

The five women were activists in a variety of areas in their pursuit to better the conditions for women and children. Emily Murphy dealt with single mothers and issues of child support, child welfare, and adoption by lobbying for women's rights.&lt;ref name = Sharpe&gt;{{cite book| first=Robert J.| last=Sharpe| title=The Persons Case: The Origins and Legacy of the Fight for Legal Personhood| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HOwC1vcGgcEC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4| isbn=978-0802096289| year=2007| publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nellie McClung favoured free medical and dental treatment for school children as well as mothers' allowances and better property rights for women. She was open to divorce and birth control but opposed the sale and use of liquor. Louise McKinney believed strongly in the "evils of alcohol" and pushed to enact prohibition measures. She advocated excluding cigarettes from parcels sent to soldiers in World War&amp;nbsp;I in 1917. She supported reasonable measures for social welfare and health as well as introducing bills intended to make prohibition more effective, to improve the lot of immigrants and bring better security to widows. She was responsible for the introduction of a motion which led to the [[Dower Act]]. Irene Parlby in her position as cabinet minister in Alberta pursued these goals expressed by McKinney. Henrietta Edwards worked with property law and sought to protect women and children.&lt;ref name=Millar/&gt;

===Commemorations===
The Famous Five have been commemorated with individual and group plaques in the [[Centre Block#Senate foyer|foyer]] and antechamber of Canada's Senate, and two identical sculptures by Canadian artist [[Barbara Paterson]], one on [[Parliament Hill]] in [[Ottawa]], the other at the [[Olympic Plaza (Calgary)|Olympic Plaza]] in [[Calgary]]. The sculpture on Parliament Hill was unveiled on October 18, 2000, in a public ceremony that included [[French language in Canada|French]] and [[Canadian English|English]] singers, [[Inuit]] dancers, and speeches by [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Adrienne Clarkson]] and [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Jean Chrétien]]. A sculpture of the Famous Five by sculptor Helen Granger Young stands on the grounds of the Manitoba Legislature in Winnipeg. Commissioned by the Nellie McClung Foundation, it was unveiled at a ceremony on June 18, 2010.

The City of [[Edmonton]] has named one park in its River Valley Parks System after each of the "Famous Five".&lt;ref name="edmonton"&gt;{{cite web| title=Alphabetical Park Listing| url=http://www.edmonton.ca/attractions_recreation/parks_rivervalley/alphabetical-park-listing.aspx| publisher=City of Edmonton| date=May 14, 2012| accessdate=May 14, 2012| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127115516/http://edmonton.ca/attractions_recreation/parks_rivervalley/alphabetical-park-listing.aspx| archivedate=November 27, 2012| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murphy had many accomplishments, such as becoming the first president of the Federated Women's Institute of Canada, vice-president of [[National Council of Women]] of Canada, president of [[Canadian Women's Press Club]], director of the Canadian Council of Child Welfare, vice-president of the Canadian Association of Child Protection, first president of the Women's Canadian Club of Edmonton and vice-president of the Social Service Council of Canada. Emily Murphy also received many honours for her life's work including being decorated by King [[George V]] to be a Lady of Grace of the [[Order of Saint John (chartered 1888)|Order of St. John of Jerusalem]].

Irene Parlby was honoured in 1935 at spring convocation at the [[University of Alberta]] with an honorary LL.D. degree. Tributes in honour of Henrietta Edwards can be found on a plaque in the Senate Chamber in Ottawa and another in the post office in Fort Macleod. Nellie McClung spoke in Calgary after Edwards' passing and spoke of Edwards, "who for 40 years was convener of laws for the National Council of Women" should not be forgotten.&lt;ref name="MacEwan" /&gt;

Along with [[Thérèse Casgrain]], the Five were commemorated in the 2001 [[Journey Series (banknotes)|Journey Series]] of Canada's [[Canadian fifty-dollar bill|fifty-dollar bill]].&lt;ref name=Brennan/&gt;  In December 2011, the [[Bank of Canada]] announced that the Famous Five would not appear on the redesigned $50 [[Frontier Series]] banknote that it issued in 2012.&lt;ref name="50dollars"&gt;{{cite news| title=Should the new $50 bill show an Arctic research boat instead of the Famous Five?| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/yourcommunity/2011/12/should-the-new-50-bill-show-an-arctic-research-boat-instead-of-the-famous-five.html| work=CBC News| date=December 7, 2011| publisher=cbc.ca| accessdate=May 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The achievement of personhood for women had been a monumental change which gave more power to women. To honour the Five and continue to involve women in leadership roles in Canada, Frances Wright and others established the non-profit Famous Five Foundation on October 18, 1996, the 70th anniversary of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council's decision.&lt;ref name="5foundation"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.famous5.ca/index.php/about-us/about-us| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225022456/http://www.famous5.ca/index.php/about-us/about-us| dead-url=yes| archive-date=December 25, 2012| title=About Us| publisher=Famous 5 Foundation| date=| accessdate=May 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{The Fourteen Infallible}}
'''The Fourteen Infallibles''' ({{lang-ar|معصومون}} '' Ma‘sūmūn'') ({{lang-fa|چهارده معصوم}} '' Chahar'dah Ma‘sūm'') in [[Twelver|Twelver Shia Islam]] are the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], his daughter [[Fatima Zahra]]; and [[Twelve Imams|the Twelve Imams]]. All are considered to be [[ismah|infallible]] under the theological concept of [[Ismah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dabashi|2006|p=463}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Corbin|1993|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, they have the power to commit sin but by their nature are able to avoid doing so, which is regarded as a miraculous gift from [[God in Islam|God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr|Dabashi|Nasr|1989|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Infallibles are believed to follow only God's desire in their actions because of their supreme righteousness, consciousness, and love for God.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donaldson|1933|p=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also regarded as being immune to error in practical matters, in calling people to religion, and in the perception of divine knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ansariyan|2007|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shia]]s believe the Fourteen Infallibles are superior to the rest of creation and to the other major [[Prophets in Islam|prophets]].&lt;ref name="harvnb|Algar|1990"&gt;{{harvnb|Algar|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3026">'''''Theophanes Continuatus''''' ({{lang-el|συνεχισταί Θεοφάνους}}) or '''''Scriptores post Theophanem''''' ({{lang|grc|Οἱ μετὰ Θεοφάνην}}, "those after Theophanes") is the [[Latin]] name commonly applied to a collection of historical writings preserved in the 11th-century Vat. gr. 167 manuscript.&lt;ref name="ODB2061"&gt;Kazhdan (1991), p. 2061&lt;/ref&gt; Its name derives from its role as the continuation, covering the years 813–961, of the [[chronicle]] of [[Theophanes the Confessor]], which reaches from 285 to 813. The manuscript consists of four distinct works, in style and form very unlike the [[annals|annalistic]] approach of Theophanes.&lt;ref name="ODB"&gt;Kazhdan (1991), pp. 2061–2062&lt;/ref&gt;

The first work, of four books consists of a series of biographies of the emperors reigning from 813 to 867 (from [[Leo the Armenian]] to [[Michael III]]). As they were commissioned by Emperor [[Constantine VII]] (r. 913–959), they reflect the point of view of the reigning [[Macedonian dynasty]]. The unknown author probably used the same sources as [[Genesios]].&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt; The second work is known as the ''Vita Basilii'' (Latin for "Life of Basil"), a biography of [[Basil I the Macedonian]] (r. 867–886) written by his grandson Constantine VII probably around 950. The work is essentially a [[panegyric]], praising Basil and his reign while vilifying his predecessor, Michael III.&lt;ref&gt;Kazhdan (1991), pp. 2062, 2180–2181&lt;/ref&gt; The third work is a history of the years 886–948, in form and content very close to the history of [[Symeon Logothetes]], and the final section continues it until 961. It was probably written by [[Theodore Daphnopates]], shortly before 963.&lt;ref&gt;Kazhdan (1991), p. 2062&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6192">The '''Thirteen Martyrs of Bagumbayan''' ({{lang-es|Trece mártires de Bagumbayan}}) were [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[Patriotism|patriots]] in the [[Philippines]] who were executed by musketry on January 11, 1897, for cooperating with the [[Katipunan]] during the [[Philippine Revolution]] against [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.executedtoday.com/2010/01/11/1897-the-thirteen-martyrs-of-bagumbayan/&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Martyrs==
* '''[[José Dizon|Jose M. Dizon]]''' -  was a Filipino patriot who was among those who founded the [[Katipunan]] that sparked the [[Philippine Revolution]]. Dizon was born in [[Binondo, Manila]]. In April 1892, he was inducted into the freemasonic lodge founded by Pedro Serrano Laktaw. That same year, he founded the lodge Taliba in Trozo, Manila and served as its venerable master. He was also among the officers of the grand regional council that included [[Apolinario Mabini]].
* '''Domingo Franco''' - Born in [[Mambusao, Capiz]], Franco was the third among the six children of Juan Franco and Ciriaca Tuason. His father worked as procurador judicial, or solicitor, in the local justice of the peace court. He kept in his care the documents of the [[La Liga Filipina]] as ordered by [[José Rizal|Jose Rizal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.msc.edu.ph/centennial/hero/wv/page3.html|title=WESTERN VISAYAS, Philippines Unsung Heroes|website=www.msc.edu.ph|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Numeriano Adriano''' - A reformist, Adriano was one of those executed by the Spaniards soon after the revolution in 1896 broke out. He was the eldest of the seven children of Pioquinto Adriano and Agapita Resurreccion of Beata, [[Pandacan, Manila]]. Adriano enrolled in the [[University of Santo Tomas]], but it is not known whether he finished a degree. For twenty years, he worked in the third branch of the Court of the First Instance as clerk of court.
* '''Moises Salvador''' - was a contractor, mason, and propagandist. Salvador was born in San Sebastian which was formerly a part of [[Quiapo, Manila]]. He was the son of Ambrosio Salvador, founding president of the [[La Liga Filipina]], and Acosta Francisco.
* '''Faustino Villaruel''' - a merchant from [[Pandacan, Manila]]. A mason and one of the founding member of the [[La Liga Filipina]], and supporter of the propaganda movement.
* '''Francisco L. Roxas''' - was a businessman, musician and a second cousin of one of the richest men in the [[Philippines]] at that time, Don Pedro Pablo Roxas. He was born in [[Binondo, Manila]].
* '''Luis Enciso Villareal''' - was a member of the Propaganda Movement. Villareal was born in [[Daraga, Albay]]. His father, Francisco Villareal, was known to be a “wonderful fiddler” and a graceful dancer. Meanwhile, his mother was Maria Espinas. His parents own an abaca plantation. He was initially enrolled in the town school but was later sent to a seminary in [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga City]] where he finished with a bachelor of arts degree.
* '''Geronimo M. Cristobal''' - He was an infantry corporal in the regiment known by the nickname “Burgos.” As he stood there facing the array of guns pointed menacingly at him and his companions, he must have thought it rather unreal that he should meet his fate at the hand of his former comrades-in-arms, some of whom could be his friends.
* '''Antonio Salazar''' - Salazar y San Agustin was one of the 13 Masons and revolutionaries who were executed by the Spanish authorities.
* '''Ramon Padilla''' - Padilla at the time of the outbreak of the Revolution in 1896 was said to be a clerk at the Comandancia de la Marina (Navy).
* '''Braulio Rivera''' - Born in Gitna (now renamed after him), [[Tondo, Manila]] near the corner of Zabala and Sto. Cristo Streets. Rivera was the son of Jose Rivera, a worker at the tobacco monopoly administration. Little is known of his early background: although only an elementary graduate, he was employed as a clerk at the “Sub-inspeccion General de Montes”. He was blessed with an exceptional singing voice thus, was inclined to singing. He was also an able musician who played three instruments - the guitar, violin and flute.
* '''Faustino Mañalac''' - He was a clerk in the Port of Manila administration and headed the Ilog Pasig council of the KKK in Binondo. A son of a carpenter at the naval shipyard in San Roque, Cavite, he became a member of the KKK Supreme Council using the alias "Mayon". Married to Marta Saldaña, who was a member of the KKK women's section along with Gregoria de Jesus, Maria Dizon, Josefa and Trinidad Rizal, Mañalac is listed among those who visited the Pamitinan caves with [[Andres Bonifacio]], [[Emilio Jacinto]], [[Aurelio Tolentino]], Guillermo Masangkay on Good Friday, 1895 and wrote about Philippine independence on the walls of the cave.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/files/16656/16656-h/16656-h.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://docs.google.com/document/preview?hgd=1&amp;id=16yXRtEdRI5NtFkXamjeQJpRX8i6NUsLsBUUEgy3hTC4&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Benedicto P. Nijiga''' - During a raid of a printing press in Binondo, the Spaniards found and confiscated subversive documents including a list of members of the Katipunan. Benedicto Nijaga was on the list as a collector of revolutionary funds. Upon the order of Gov. Polavieja to arbitrarily arrest all suspected members of the Katipunan, Nijaga was arrested while he was campaigning for revolutionary funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://calbayogko.tripod.com/id1.html|title=History|website=calbayogko.tripod.com|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''Thirty-Six Immortals of Poetry'''|三十六歌仙|Sanjūrokkasen}} are a group of Japanese poets of the [[Asuka period|Asuka]], [[Nara period|Nara]], and [[Heian period]]s selected by [[Fujiwara no Kintō]] as exemplars of [[waka (poetry)|Japanese poetic ability]]. The eldest surviving collection of the 36 poets' works is ''[[Nishi Honganji Sanjū-rokunin Kashu]]'' ("Nishi Honganji 36 poets collection") of 1113. Similar groups of Japanese poets include the [[Kamakura period]] ''Nyōbō Sanjūrokkasen'' (女房三十六歌仙), composed by court ladies exclusively, and the {{nihongo|''Chūko Sanjūrokkasen''|中古三十六歌仙}}, or Thirty-Six Heian-era Immortals of Poetry, selected by [[Fujiwara no Norikane]] 藤原範兼 (1107–1165). This list superseded an older group called the [[Six Immortals of Poetry]].

Sets of portraits (essentially imaginary) of the group were popular in [[Japanese painting]] and later [[woodblock printing in Japan|woodblock prints]], and often hung in temples.

'''Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker''' (abbreviated to '''ZAZ''') were an American comedy filmmaking trio consisting of [[Jim Abrahams]] and brothers [[David Zucker (filmmaker)|David Zucker]] and [[Jerry Zucker (film director)|Jerry Zucker]] who specialized in writing [[slapstick comedy]] films during the 1980s. The trio knew each other during their childhood years, growing up in [[Shorewood, Wisconsin]] and attending [[Shorewood High School (Wisconsin)|Shorewood High School]] which is sometimes referenced in their work. While attending the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], the trio founded a small theater known as The Kentucky Fried Theater in 1971 which led to their [[sketch comedy]] film ''[[The Kentucky Fried Movie]]''.

This was followed in 1980 by the trio's breakout hit ''[[Airplane!]]'', which remains a revered comedic milestone. Subsequent collaborations include the TV series ''[[Police Squad!]]'', its subsequent ''[[The Naked Gun|Naked Gun]]'' trilogy and the films ''[[Top Secret!]]'' and ''[[Ruthless People]]''. All of their projects relied heavily on [[Parody|parodies]], [[visual gag]]s and [[Fourth wall|breaking of the fourth wall]], and established a strong cult following. The notable stylistic exception is ''Ruthless People'', a more traditional farce that was directed by the trio but unlike their other productions, not written by them.

Prominent ZAZ actors and actresses include [[Leslie Nielsen]], [[Lloyd Bridges]], [[Robert Stack]], [[Rowan Atkinson]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]] and [[Charlie Sheen]]. The trio's status as a three-person team of co-directors is highly unusual, although some of their later projects were directed by David Zucker working solo and with Jerry Zucker and Abrahams credited only as producers and/or writers. Each member of the group also had individual solo careers:

* David Zucker directed ''[[BASEketball]]'', ''[[My Boss's Daughter]]'', ''[[Scary Movie 3]]'' and ''[[Scary Movie 4|4]]''.
* Abrahams directed ''[[Hot Shots!]]'' and ''[[Mafia!|Jane Austen's Mafia!]]''.
* Jerry Zucker directed ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'', ''[[First Knight]]'' and ''[[Rat Race (film)|Rat Race]]''. Of the three, Jerry Zucker has found the most mainstream non-comedic success including ''Ghost'' and ''First Knight'', which grossed $505 million and $127 million worldwide respectively.

==Filmography==
&lt;!--Do NOT add Police Squad! It's a TV show, not an actual film. Also do NOT add the Naked Gun movies. They were not directed by ZAZ, only written. Thank you.!--&gt;
Below is a filmography chart on which films the trio have directed together and solo:
