      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24397">The '''archaeology of religion and ritual''' is a growing field of study within [[archaeology]] that applies ideas from [[religious studies]],  theory and methods, anthropological theory, and archaeological and [[historical method]]s and theories to the study of [[religion]] and [[ritual]] in past human societies from a material perspective.

==Definitions==

Religion may be defined as “a set of beliefs concerning the cause, nature, and purpose of the universe, especially when considered as the creation of a superhuman agency or agencies, usually involving devotional and ritual observances, and often containing a moral code governing the conduct of human affairs,” &lt;ref name=dict&gt;Dictionary.com (http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Religion) Based on the Random House Dictionary, Random House, Inc. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; whereas ritual is “an established or prescribed procedure for a religious or other rite.” &lt;ref&gt;Dictionary.com (http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ritual) Based on the Random House Dictionary, Random House, Inc. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists may study the material traces of religious ritual (for example, the ritual destruction of ceramic vessels during the [[Aztec]] [[New Fire ceremony]] &lt;ref&gt;Elson, Christina and Michael E. Smith (2001) Archaeological Deposits from the Aztec New Fire Ceremony.  ‘’Ancient Mesoamerica, ‘’ Vol. 12, Issue 2, pp. 157–174&lt;/ref&gt;) or the material correlates of religion as a totalized worldview (for example, Elizabeth Kyder-Reid’s study of the Southern [[Redemptorist]]s’ reconfiguration of landscape and artifacts to reflect their ideals of community and poverty in material form &lt;ref&gt;Kyder-Reid, Elizabeth (1996)  The Construction of Sanctity: Landscape and Ritual in a Religious Community.  In ‘’Landscape Archaeology: Reading and Interpreting the American Historical Landscape.’’  Rebecca Yamin and Karen Bescherer Metheny, eds.  University of Tennessee Press.&lt;/ref&gt;).

As in [[religious studies]] and the [[Anthropology of religion]], many archaeologists differentiate between “[[world religions]],” and “traditional” or “[[indigenous religions]].”  “World religions” are defined by Bowie (2000: 26) &lt;ref name="Bowie"&gt;Bowie, F.  (2000) The Anthropology of religion.  Oxford: Blackwell.  Quoted in Insoll, Timothy (2004) ‘’Archaeology, Religion, Ritual.’’  New York: Routeledge, page 8&lt;/ref&gt; as:

# Based on written scriptures.
# Has a notion of salvation, often from outside.
# Universal, or potentially universal.
# Can subsume or supplant primal religions.
# Often forms a separate sphere of activity.

while indigenous religions are defined as:

# Oral, or if literate, lacks written/formal scriptures and creeds.
# ‘This worldly’.
#  Confined to a single language or ethnic group.
#  Form basis from which world religions have developed.
#  Religious and social life are inseparable.&lt;ref name="Bowie"/&gt;

However, Timothy Insoll (2004: 9) &lt;ref&gt;Insoll, Timothy (2004) ‘’Archaeology, Religion, Ritual.’’  New York: Routeledge&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that these categorizations arise from a much-critiqued [[neo-evolutionism|neo-evolutionary]] perspective.  Strict dichotomies of religious forms may also contribute to skewing research toward state religions, leaving [[household]] religious practice, and the relationships between these, under-investigated (a trend noted by Elson and Smith, 2001 &lt;ref&gt;Elson, Christina and Michael E. Smith (2001:157) Archaeological Deposits from the Aztec New Fire Ceremony.  Ancient Mesoamerica, Vol. 12, Issue 2, pp. 157–174&lt;/ref&gt;).  Insoll (2004:9) argues that archaeologists may contribute to blurring the boundaries of world and indigenous religions.

The archaeology of religion also incorporates related anthropological or religious concepts and terms such as [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[tradition]], [[religious symbolism|symbolism]], and the [[sacred]].

==Theory==

===Anthropology of religion===

Theory within the archaeology of religion borrows heavily from the [[Anthropology of religion]], which encompasses a broad range of perspectives.  These include: [[Émile Durkheim]]’s functionalist understanding of religion as serving to separate the [[Sacred-profane dichotomy|sacred and the profane]];&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Émile. (1998)  ''The Elementary Forms of Religious Life.’’  Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Marx]]’s idea of religion as “[[the opium of the people|the opium of the masses]]” or a [[false consciousness]],&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl (1992) ‘’Early Writings.’’  Penguin Classics.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clifford Geertz]]’s loose definition of religion as a “system of symbols” that orders the world,&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, Clifford (1973:90) ''The Interpretation of Cultures.’’  New York: Basic Books.  P. 90&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victor Turner]]’s work on ritual, including [[rites of passage]] and [[liminality]],&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Victor (1995) ''The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti-Structure.’’  Aldine Transaction.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Weber]]’s religious types &lt;ref&gt;Heydebrand, Wolf (1994) ‘’Sociological Writings: Max Weber.’’  Continuum Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and thoughts on the relationship between economics and religion;&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max (2002) ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism: and Other Writings.''  Trans. Peter Baehr.  Penguin Classics.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]’ structuralist understandings of [[totemism]] and [[myth]];&lt;ref&gt;Tremlett, Paul-François (2008) ‘’Lévi-Strauss on Religion: The Structuring Mind (Key Thinkers in the Study of Religion’’).  Equionox Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mary Douglas]]’ idea of the division of “[[Purity and Danger|purity and danger]]”.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, Mary (2003 [1966]) ''Purity and Danger: An Analysis of Concept of Pullution and Taboo.''  Routledge Classics&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion, identity, and practice===

Archaeological studies of religion increasingly recognize religion as an organizing principle in social life, rather than as a separate sphere of activity.  They include religion as an axis of [[Identity (social science)|identity]] that structures social life and personal experience.  Therefore, entire artifact assemblages (rather than specifically “religious” artifacts, such as rosary beads) can be interpreted according to the ways that they simultaneously create, display, and constrain notions of self according to religious ideas.  For example, John Chenoweth (2009) &lt;ref name="Chenoweth, John M. 2009"&gt;Chenoweth, John M.  (2009)  Social identity, material culture, and the archaeology of religion: Quaker practices in context.  ''Journal of Social Archaeology'' 9: 319&lt;/ref&gt; interpreted ceramic assemblages and burials according to [[Quaker]] ideals of plainness and modesty.

Because social identity is both imposed and negotiated through social practice, including material practice, archaeologies of religion increasingly incorporate practice-based theory.  Building upon [[Anthony Giddens]]’ idea of structuration &lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony (1986) ‘’The Constitution of Society: Outline of A Theory of Structuration.’’  Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pierre Bourdieu]]’s ideas of both practice &lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre (1977) ‘’Outline of a Theory of Practice.’’  Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and cultural capital,&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre (1987) ‘’Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste.’’  Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; theories of material practice posit that people use material goods to negotiate their places within social structures.  Examples of the archaeological interpretation of religion and ritual as part of social negotiation, transformation or reinforcement include Chenoweth’s work on [[Quaker]] religious practice,&lt;ref name="Chenoweth, John M. 2009"/&gt; Kyder-Reid’s work on the Southern Redemptorists,&lt;ref&gt;Kyder-Reid, Elizabeth (1996)  The Construction of Sanctity: Landscape and Ritual in a Religious Community.  In ''Landscape Archaeology: Reading and Interpreting the American Historical Landscape.''  Rebecca Yamin and Karen Bescherer Metheny, eds.  University of Tennessee Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and Timothy Pauketat’s work on feasting in [[Cahokia]] (Pauketat et al., 2002 &lt;ref&gt;Pauketat, Timothy, Lucretia S. Kelly, Gayle J. Fritz, Neal H. Lopinot, Scott Elias, and Eve Hargrave (2002) The Residues of Feasting and Public Ritual at Cahokia.  ''American Antiquity,'' Vol. 67, No. 2, pp. 257–279&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Religion, power, and inequality===

Because religion and political power are often intertwined&lt;ref&gt;Firth, Raymond (1981) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/676754 Spiritual Aroma: Religion and Politics].  ''American Anthropologist'', New Series, Vol. 83, No. 3, pp. 582–601&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Eric (1991) ''Religious Regimes and State Formation: Perspectives From European Ethnography.''  State University of New York Press (August 13, 1991) {{ISBN|978-0791406519}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in early states, the archaeology of religion may also engage theories of [[power (philosophy)|power]] and [[Social inequality|inequality]].   John Janusek’s study of [[Tiwanaku]] religion, for example, explored the ways that religion served to integrate societies within the Andean state.&lt;ref&gt;Janusek, John Wayne (2006) The changing ‘nature’ of Tiwanaku religion and the rise of the Andean state.  ''World Archaeology'' Vol. 38(3): 469–492&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Colonialism|Colonial]] regimes frequently justified expansion through a commitment to religious conversion; archaeologies of coloniality may therefore intersect with the archaeology of religion.  James Delle’s 2001 article on [[Mission (Christianity)|missions]] and landscape in [[Jamaica]] &lt;ref&gt;Delle, James (2001) Race, Missionaries, and the Struggle to Free Jamaica.  In ''Race and the Archaeology of Identity.''  Charles E. Orser, Jr., ed.  Pp. 177–195.  Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press&lt;/ref&gt; and Barbara Voss’ work on missions, [[human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[empire]] &lt;ref&gt;Voss, Barbara (2008) Domesticating Imperialism: Sexual Politics and the Archaeology of Empire.  ''American Anthropologist'' 110(2): 191–203&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrate how religion has intersected with colonial regimes.

===Historical method and theory===

Historical archaeologists have made major contributions to the understanding of the religion and ritual of peoples who have remained underrepresented (or misrepresented) in the historical record, such as colonized peoples, indigenous peoples, and enslaved peoples.  Mandatory religious conversion was common in many colonial situations (e.g. the Spanish colonization of the Americas), which led to syncretic religious practice, rejection or resistance to new religions, covert practice of indigenous religions, and/or misunderstandings and misinterpretations of both indigenous and colonizer religions (Hanks 2010 &lt;ref&gt;Hanks, William F. (2010).  ''Converting Words: Maya in the Age of the Cross''.  Berkeley: University of California Press,&lt;/ref&gt; Klor de Alva 1982,&lt;ref&gt;Klor de Alva, J. Jorge (1982).  Spiritual Conflict and Accommodation in New Spain: Toward a Typology of Aztec Responses to Christianity.  In George A. Collier, Renato Rosaldo, and John D. Wirth (eds), ''The Inca and Aztec States, 1400–1800: Anthropology and History.''  New York: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt; Wernke 2007&lt;ref name="Wernke, Steven 2007"&gt;Wernke, Steven (2007)  Analogy or Erasure?  Dialectics of Religious Transformation in the Early Doctrinas of the Colca Valley, Peru.  ''International Journal of Historical Archaeology'', Vol. 11, No. 2, June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;).

This research combines archaeological and anthropological method and theory with historical method and theory.  In addition to recovering, recording, and analyzing material culture, historical archaeologists use archives, oral histories, ethnohistorical accounts.  Researchers read texts critically, emphasizing the historical context of the documents (especially regarding underrepresented peoples whose voices may be distorted or missing) in order to better understand religious practices that may have been discouraged or even severely punished.  Combined archaeological, historical, and anthropological data sets may contradict each other, or the material record may illuminate the details of covert or syncretic religious practice, as well as resistance to dominant religious forms. For example, our understanding of the religious practice of enslaved peoples in the United States (e.g. Leone and Frye 2001,&lt;ref name="Leone, Mark P 2001"&gt;Leone, Mark P. and Gladys Marie Frye (2001) A Coherent Religion among African Slaves.  In ''Race and the Archaeology of Identity'', ed. By C. Orser.  University of Utah Press&lt;/ref&gt; Fennell 2007 &lt;ref name="Fennell, Christopher 2007"&gt;Fennell, Christopher (2007) ''Crossroads and Cosmologies: Diasporas and Ethnogenesis in the New World''.  University of Florida Press,&lt;/ref&gt;) has increased dramatically thanks to research in historical archaeology.

== Material correlates==

Because archaeology studies human history through objects, buildings, bodies, and spaces, archaeologists must engage theories that connect anthropological and sociological theories of religion to [[material culture]] and landscapes. Theories of materiality &lt;ref&gt;Meskell, Lynn (2005) ''Archaeologies of Materiality.''  Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; and landscape &lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Matthew (2006) ''Ideas of Landscape.'' Wiley-Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; serve to connect human activities, experiences, and behaviors to social practices, including religion.  Theories of [[:wikt:embody|embodiment]] &lt;ref&gt;Hammelkis, Yannis, Mark Pluciennik, and Sarah Tarlow (eds) (2001) ''Thinking Through the Body: Archaeologies of Corporeality.''  Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; also serve to interpret human remains as they relate to religion and ritual.

The archaeology of religion makes use of the same material evidence as other branches of archaeology, but certain artifact classes are particularly emphasized in studying religion and ritual in the past:

*'''Human remains and [[burial]] assemblages''' can offer many clues to religious and ritual activity.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Christopher (1995) Mortuary Practices: Their Social, Philosophical-Religious, Circumstantial, and Physical Determinants.  ''Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory'', Vol. 2, No. 2, pp. 105–200&lt;/ref&gt;  Human remains themselves are used in all branches of archaeology for information on sex, age, occupation, and disease.  Methods of interment (including burial position, cremation, burial location, primary and secondary burials, etc.) contribute to understanding changing religious practice, as well as social difference within groups (e.g. Lohmann 2005 &lt;ref&gt;Lohmann, Roger Ivar (2005) The Afterlife of Asabano Corpses: Relationships with the Deceased in Papua New Guinea.  ''Ethnology,'' Vol. 44, No. 2, pp. 189–206&lt;/ref&gt;).  Total burial contexts, i.e., the setting, [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], [[ecofacts]], and human remains themselves, may provide evidence of religious beliefs about [[death]] and the afterworld.
*'''Religious buildings''', such as [[temple]] complexes, [[kivas]], and missions, are often used to examine communal religious and ritual activity (e.g. Barnes 1995,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Gina L. (1995) An Introduction to Buddhist Archaeology.  ‘’World Archaeology,’’ Vol. 27, No. 2, pp. 165–182&lt;/ref&gt; Graham 1998,&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Elizabeth (1998) Mission Archaeology.  ‘’Annual Review of Anthropology’’, Vol. 27, pp. 25–62&lt;/ref&gt; Reid ''et al.'' 1997 &lt;ref&gt;Reid, Andrew, Paul Lane, Alinah Segobye, Lowe Borjeson, Nonofo Mathibidi, and Princess Sekgarametso (1997) Tswana Architecture and Responses to Colonialism.  ''World Archaeology,'' Vol. 28, No. 3, pp. 370–392&lt;/ref&gt; ).  Part of [[archaeoastronomy]] is the investigation of how buildings are aligned to astral bodies and events, such as solstices, which often coincide with religious or ritual activities.  Archaeological examinations of religious buildings can reveal unequal access to religious knowledge and ritual.  Religious buildings frequently contain religious iconography that provides insight into the symbolic dimensions of religious life.
*Within landscape archaeology, '''sacred [[landscapes]]''' are an increasingly important focus of study (e.g. Clendinnen 1980 &lt;ref&gt;Clendinnen, Inga  (1980) Landscape and Worldview: The Survival of Yucatec Maya Culture under Spanish Conquest.  ''Comparative Studies in Society and History,'' Vol. 22, No. 3, pp. 374–393
&lt;/ref&gt;). Landscapes are imbued with sacred meaning throughout the world; [[aboriginal Australian]] [[songlines]], and the related belief that mythical events are marked on the landscape, are one example.  Human modifications to landscapes, such as Kyder-Reid’s study of the Redemtorists’ modifications of their estate to emphasize communality,&lt;ref&gt;Kyder-Reid, Elizabeth (1996)  The Construction of Sanctity: Landscape and Ritual in a Religious Community.  In ''Landscape Archaeology: Reading and Interpreting the American Historical Landscape. '' Rebecca Yamin and Karen Bescherer Metheny, eds.  University of Tennessee Press.&lt;/ref&gt; may point to the enactment of religious views.

*'''Religious iconography, [[symbols]]''',&lt;ref&gt;Robb, John E. (1998) The Archaeology of Symbols.  ''Annual Review of Anthropology'', Vol. 27, pp. 329–346&lt;/ref&gt; '''ethnographic texts and ethnographic analogy''' are important tools that archaeologists use to compare with the material record to examine religions in the past (e.g. Clendinnen 1980,&lt;ref&gt;Clendinnen, Inga  (1980) Landscape and Worldview: The Survival of Yucatec Maya Culture under Spanish Conquest. ‘’ Comparative Studies in Society and History,’’ Vol. 22, No. 3, pp. 374–393&lt;/ref&gt; Elson and Smith 2001 &lt;ref&gt;Elson, Christina and Michael E. Smith (2001:157) Archaeological Deposits from the Aztec New Fire Ceremony.  ''Ancient Mesoamerica,'' Vol. 12, Issue 2, pp. 157–174&lt;/ref&gt;). Though texts are not direct “windows to the past,” particularly for societies with few or no written records, they are valuable lines of evidence that may be contradicted or supported by the material record.
*'''Common artifact classes''' such as [[ceramic art|ceramics]] have been increasingly reinterpreted within a religious framework. According to the idea of religion as a form of social practice and a total worldview, any artifact may potentially be used to embody religious ideas and ideals in material form.  Patterns of artifact and [[ecofact]] use within ritual contexts may expose preferences or sacred meanings of certain materials; the ritual use of [[pine]] among the ancient Maya is one example (Morehart, Lentz, and Prufer 2005 &lt;ref&gt;Morehart, Christopher T., David L. Lentz, and Keith M. Prufer (2005)  Wood of the Gods: The Ritual Use of Pine (PINUS SPP.) by the Ancient Lowland Maya.  ''Latin American Antiquity'’, 16(3), pp. 255–274&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Modern religious use of archaeological sites===
Contemporary religious groups often claim archaeological sites as part of their heritage, and make use of archaeological sites and artifacts in their religious practice (e.g. Wallis 2003 &lt;ref&gt;Wallis, Robert J. and Jenny Blain (2003) Sites, Sacredness, and Stories: Interactions of Archaeology and Contemporary Paganism.  ‘’Folklore’’, Vol. 114, No. 3, pp. 307–321&lt;/ref&gt;).  These practices and religious interpretations of sites may clash with archaeological interpretations, leading to disputes about heritage, preservation, use of sites, and the “ownership” of history (Bender 1999 &lt;ref&gt;Bender, Barbara (1999) ‘’Stonehenge: Making Space’’.  Berg Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Biblical archaeology===
Biblical archaeology is a field of archaeology that seeks to correlate events in the Bible with concrete archaeological sites and artifacts (Meyers 1984,&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, Eric M.

The '''avunculate''', sometimes called '''avunculism''' or '''avuncularism''', is any social institution where a special relationship exists between an uncle and his [[Nephew and niece|sisters' children]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=F0aOAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT232&amp;lpg=PT232&amp;dq=Avunculate&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rcsBD8kQCW&amp;sig=jRTzPmnrdU1bZGwGeqtQC_8gYDQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Avunculate&amp;f=false|title=The Routledge Encyclopedia of Social and Cultural Anthropology|last=Barnard|first=Alan|last2=Spencer|first2=Jonathan|date=2009-12-04|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135236403|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship can be formal or informal, depending on the society. Early anthropological research focused on the association between the avunculate and [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] descent, while later research has expanded to consider the avunculate in general society.

==Definition==
The term ''avunculate'' comes from the Latin ''[[wikt:avunculus|avunculus]],'' the maternal uncle.

The 1989 ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines "avunculate" as follows:
:"Avunculate. The special relationship existing in some societies between a maternal uncle and his sister's son; maternal uncles regarded as a collective body.
::1920 R. H. LOWIE Prim. Soc. v. 81 Ethnologists describe under the heading of avunculate the customs regulating in an altogether special way the relations of a nephew to his maternal uncle. Ibid. vii. 171 The Omaha are patrilineal now, but their having the avunculate proves that they once traced descent through the mother, for on no other hypothesis can such a usage be explained. ... "&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary''. Second Edition 1989. On-line version.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avunculocal societies==

An avunculocal society is one in which a married couple traditionally lives with the man's mother's eldest brother, which most often occurs in [[matrilineal]] societies. The [[Anthropology|anthropological]] term "avunculocal residence" refers to this convention, which has been identified in about 4% of the world's societies.&lt;ref&gt;Rosman, Abraham and Rubel, Paula G. ''The Tapestry of Culture: An Introduction to Cultural Anthropology''. Mcgraw-Hill College, 1995. ({{ISBN|0-07-053955-3}})&lt;/ref&gt;

This pattern generally occurs when a man obtains his status, his job role, or his privileges from their nearest elder matrilineal male relative. When a woman's son lives near her brother, he is able to more easily learn how he needs to behave in the matrilineal role he has inherited.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

== Cultures with a formal avunculate ==

According to the [[Kazakhstan|Kazakh]] common law, the avunculate nephews could take anything from the relatives of the mother up to three times. In the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] past a nephew, at a feast at his maternal uncle or grandfather, could take any horse from their herd or any delicacy.&lt;ref name="Zuev"&gt;Yu.Zuev, ''"Early Türks: Sketches of history and ideology"'', Almaty, Daik-Press, 2002, p. 30, {{Listed Invalid ISBN|9985-4-4152-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Southwest United States]], the [[Apache]] tribe practices a form of this, where the uncle is responsible for teaching the children social values and proper behavior while inheritance and ancestry is reckoned through the mother's family alone. Modern day influences have somewhat but not completely erased this tradition.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The [[Chamorros]] of the [[Mariana Islands]]&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, Lawarence J. ''Ancient Chamorro Society''. Bess Press, 1992. ({{ISBN|1-880188-05-8}})&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Taíno people|Taíno]] of [[Turks and Caicos Islands]]&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, William F.  ''[http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/caribarch/middle1999.htm Before Columbus: Caonabo’s Homeland]'', Middle Caicos Earthwatch Report, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; are examples of societies that have practiced avunculocal residence.

== Anthropology research ==

Research on the avunculate in the early 20th century focused on the association between the avunculate and patrilineal/matrilineal societies. [[Franz Boas]] categorized various avunculate arrangements based on the location of residence in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boas|first=Franz|date=1922-01-01|title=The Avunculate among the Vandau|jstor=660075|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=24|issue=1|pages=95–97|doi=10.1525/aa.1922.24.1.02a00150}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri-Alexandre Junod|Henri Alexandre Juno]] made the claim that the avunculate in the [[Tsonga people|Tsonga]] indicated that society had previously been matrilineal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ryder|first=J. W.|last2=Blackman|first2=M. B.|date=2016-09-14|title=The Avunculate: A Cross-Cultural Critique of Claude Levi-Strauss|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/106939717000500202|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|language=en|volume=5|issue=2|pages=97–115|doi=10.1177/106939717000500202}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]] identified the Tsonga (BaThonga) of [[Mozambique]], the [[Tonga]]ns of the Pacific, and the [[Nama people|Nama]] of Namibia as avunculate societies as early as 1924. He also expanded the concept to incorporate other family relationships.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://radicalanthropologygroup.org/sites/default/files/pdf/class_text_055.pdf|title=Structure and Function in Primitive Society|last=Radcliffe-Brown|first=Alfred|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=|location=London|pages=15–31|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later research moved beyond the issue of matrilinealism. [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]   incorporating the avunculate into his "atom of kinship".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=S_DnQ82WpaoC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;lpg=PA140&amp;dq=levi-strauss+avunculate&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mEpT01_Hn3&amp;sig=S9ezPAzyRvO5S8SwZSQAmnD7B1w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=levi-strauss%20avunculate&amp;f=false|title=Teaching Lévi-Strauss|last=Penner|first=Hans H.|date=1998-01-01|publisher=Scholars Press|isbn=9780788504907|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jan N. Bremmer]] argued based on a survey of the Indo-European peoples that the avunculate is explained by the principle of education outside the (extended) family, and does not indicate matrilinealism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bremmer|first=Jan|date=1976-01-01|title=EPRINTS-BOOK-TITLE|url=http://www.rug.nl/research/portal/publications/avunculate-and-fosterage(062fe6fa-623a-4676-b367-0575eba0ad5b).html|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avunculate marriage==
{{Main|Avunculate marriage}}
In historical (not anthropological) terminology, an [[avunculate marriage]] is the marriage of a man with the daughter of his sister (not explicitly forbidden by the listings in [[Leviticus 18]]). In most cultures with avunculate customs in the sense used by anthropologists, such a marriage would violate incest taboos governing relations between members of the same [[matrilineality|matrilineal lineage]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

'''Bashkeer Alighmani''' literally means German Towel or more precisely German Hand Towel. It is usually a [[cotton]] [[cloth]] measuring about 30&amp;nbsp;cm by 90&amp;nbsp;cm with black background and very colorful flowery design. It is worn as a head cover for women of some towns in [[Hauran]], specifically [[Ar Ramtha]] in North [[Jordan]]. 
It is thought to have been brought back from Germany in the 1970s when many Ramthan used to import used [[Mercedes-Benz]] cars from Germany.

{{HistoryOfSouthAsia}} 
The '''black and red ware culture''' (BRW) is a late [[Bronze Age India]]n and early [[Iron Age India]]n [[archaeological culture]] of the northern and central [[Indian subcontinent]], associated with the [[Vedic civilization]].

In the Western [[Ganges]] plain (western [[Uttar Pradesh]]) it is dated to c. 1450-1200 BCE, and is succeeded by the [[Painted Grey Ware culture]]; whereas in the Central and Eastern Ganges plain (eastern Uttar Pradesh, [[Bihar]], and [[Bengal]]) and Central India ([[Madhya Pradesh]]) the BRW appears during the same period but continues for longer, until c. 700-500 BCE, when it is succeeded by the [[Northern Black Polished Ware]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin Southworth, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hTwuFUW5aEgC ''Linguistic Archaeology of South Asia''] (Routledge, 2005), p.177&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Western Ganges plain, the BRW was preceded by the [[Ochre Coloured Pottery culture]]. The BRW sites were characterized by [[subsistence agriculture]] (cultivation of rice, barley, and legumes), and yielded some ornaments made of shell, copper, [[carnelian]], and [[terracotta]].&lt;ref&gt;Upinder Singh (2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&amp;pg=PA220 ''A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India From the Stone Age to the 12th Century''], p.220&lt;/ref&gt;

In some sites, particularly in [[Punjab, India|eastern Punjab]] and [[Gujarat]], BRW pottery is associated with Late [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Harappan]] pottery, and according to some scholars like Tribhuan N. Roy, the BRW may have directly influenced the [[Painted Grey Ware]] and [[Northern Black Polished Ware]] cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer, Jim. 1993, Reurbanization: The eastern Punjab and beyond. In Urban Form and Meaning in South Asia: The Shaping of Cities from Prehistoric to Precolonial Times, ed. [[Howard Spodek|H. Spodek]] and D.M. Srinivasan. p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; BRW pottery is unknown west of the Indus Valley.&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer, Jim. Mathura: A protohistoric Perspective in D.M. Srinivasan (ed.), Mathura, the Cultural Heritage, 1989, pp. 171-180. Delhi. cited in Chakrabarti 1992&lt;/ref&gt;  

Use of iron, although sparse at first, is relatively early, postdating the beginning of the Iron Age in [[Anatolia]] ([[Hittites]]) by only two or three centuries, and predating the [[Europe]]an ([[Celt]]s) Iron Age by another two to three hundred years. Recent findings in Northern India show Iron working in the 1800-1000 BCE period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tewari |first1=Rakesh |title=The origins of iron working in India: new evidence from the Central Ganga Plain and the Eastern Vindhyas |journal=Antiquity |date=2003 |volume=77 |issue=297 |pages=536–544 |doi=10.1017/S0003598X00092590}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Shaffer, the "nature and context of the iron objects involved [of the BRW culture] are very different from early iron objects found in Southwest Asia."&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer 1989, cited in Chakrabarti 1992:171&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9224">[[Brexit]] is the commonly used term for the [[United Kingdom]]'s intended withdrawal from the [[European Union]], which resulted from a referendum on 23 June 2016.&lt;ref name="bbc-define"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32810887 |title=Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU |publisher=BBC News |first1=Alex |last1=Hunt |first2=Brian |last2=Wheeler |date=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article details the mostly critical response to this decision in the visual art, novels, theatre, and film.

==Background==
{{Main|Brexit}}
The British government [[Second Cameron ministry|led by David Cameron]] held a [[Referendums in the United Kingdom|referendum]] on [[European Union Referendum Act 2015#Referendum question|the issue]] in 2016; a majority voted [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|to leave]] the [[European Union]]. On 29 March 2017, [[First May ministry|Theresa May's administration]] [[United Kingdom invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|invoked]] [[Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|Article 50 of the Treaty on the European Union]] in a letter to the [[President of the European Council]], [[Donald Tusk]]. The UK is set to leave by March 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39325561|title=Article 50: Theresa May to trigger Brexit process|work= BBC News|date=20 March 2017|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brexit in the visual arts ==
The response of artists and writers to Brexit has tended to be negative, reflecting a reported overwhelming percentage of people involved in Britain's [[creative industries]] voting against leaving the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;Mia Jankowicz, 'Britain's thriving art scene strangled by Brexit chaos' in ''Politics.co.uk,'' 20 March 2017: [http://www.politics.co.uk/comment-analysis/2017/03/20/britain-s-thriving-art-scene-strangled-by-brexit-chaos Online Link]&lt;/ref&gt; The claim by one, the visual artist [[Bob and Roberta Smith]], writing in ''The Guardian'' newspaper typifies this response:

{{quote|Post-Brexit, we face a dissolution of our museums and galleries comparable in its devastation to that visited on England in the 1530s, as philistine politicians slash budgets. Art schools and the arts in schools will be further diminished in a wave of manufactured disdain for so-called elitists.&lt;ref&gt;Bob and Roberta Smith, 'Brexit will spell the end of British art as we know it', in ''The Guardian'' (UK newspaper), 12 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other responses by visual artists to Brexit include a mural, painted in May 2017, by the secretive graffiti artist [[Banksy]] near the ferry port at [[Dover]] in southern [[England]]. It shows a workman using a chisel to chip off one of the stars on the [[European Union Flag]].&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Ellis-Petersen, 'Banksy Brexit mural of man chipping away at EU flag appears in Dover' in ''The Guardian'' (UK newspaper), 8 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2017 art exhibition at the [[Serpentine Gallery]] in London, the artist [[Grayson Perry]] showed a series of ceramic, tapestry and other works of art dealing with the divisions in Britain during the Brexit campaign and in its aftermath. This included two large ceramic pots, Perry called his ''Brexit Vases,'' standing on plinths ten feet apart, on the first of which were scenes involving pro-European British citizens, and on the second scenes involving anti-European British citizens. These were derived from what Perry called his 'Brexit tour of Britain.'&lt;ref&gt;Mick Brown, 'Grayson Perry: What I learnt from my Brexit tour around Britain', in ''The Daily Telegraph'' (UK newspaper), 27 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brexit in novels ==
One of the first novels to engage with a post-Brexit Britain was ''Rabbitman'' by [[Michael Paraskos]] (published 9 March 2017). ''Rabbitman'' is a dark comic fantasy in which the events that lead to the election of a right-wing populist American president, and Britain's vote to leave the European Union, were the result of a series of [[Faustian]] pacts with the [[Devil]]. As a result, ''Rabbitman'' is set partly in a post-Brexit Britain in which society has collapsed and people are dependent on European Union food aid.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Paraskos, ''Rabbitman'' (London: Friction Fiction, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mark Billingham's ''Love Like Blood'' (published 1 June 2017) is a crime thriller in which Brexit sees a rise in xenophobic hate crime.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Billingham, ''Love Like Blood,'' (London: Little Brown Books, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; Post-Brexit Britain is also the setting for [[Amanda Craig]]'s ''The Lie of the Land'' (published 13 June 2017), a satirical novel set ten years after the vote to leave the European Union, in which an impoverished [[middle class]] couple from [[Islington]] in north London are forced to move from the heart of the pro-European Union capital to the heart of the pro-Brexit countryside in Devon.&lt;ref&gt;Amanda Craig, ''The Lie of the Land'' (London: Little Brown Books, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Brexit is also the baseline for Douglas Board's comic political thriller ''Time of Lies'' (published 23 June 2017). In this novel, the first post-Brexit [[general election]] in 2020 is won by a violent right-wing former football hooligan called Bob Grant. Board charts the response to this of the hitherto pro-European Union metropolitan political elite.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Board, ''Time of Lies'' (London: Lightning Books, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanley Johnson (writer)|Stanley Johnson]]'s ''Kompromat'' (published 23 July 2017) is a political thriller that suggests the vote to leave the [[European Union]] was a result of Russian influence on the referendum, although Johnson has insisted his book is not intended to point the finger at Russia's [[secret services]], but is 'just meant to be fun.'&lt;ref&gt;Katie Spencer, 'Literature goes Brexit: EU vote prompts writers to tackle issue', Sky News report, 19 March 2017 [http://news.sky.com/story/literature-goes-brexit-eu-vote-prompts-writers-to-tackle-issue-10807458 Click for Link]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brexit in theatre ==
In theatre, in June 2017 the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] in London presented a play by [[Carol Ann Duffy]], entitled, ''My Country; a work in progress.'' An allegorical work, the play uses the device of a convention called by the goddess [[Britannia]] who is concerned about the future of the British people.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Kettle, 'Brexit stage left: how theatre became the best way to understand today’s Britain', in ''The Guardian'' (UK newspaper), 10 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The play differs from some artistic responses in that Duffy and the National Theatre-based the attitudes of the characters on stage in part on the responses to interviews, conducted by the regional offices of the UK Arts Councils, with ordinary people, but excluding responses from London and the south-east of England, where most people voted not to leave the European Union. As a result, according to Dominic Cavendish, writing in the ''Daily Telegraph'' newspaper, 'the bias is towards the Leave camp.'&lt;ref&gt;Dominic Cavendish, 'The National Theatre takes on Brexit in My Country, a work in progress' in ''The Daily Telegraph'' (UK newspaper), 11 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brexit in film==
{{Main article|Brexit: The Movie}}
In 2016, [[Martin Durkin (television director)|Martin Durkin]] made a documentary film called ''[[Brexit: The Movie]]'' about that year's [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|referendum on EU membership]], arguing for a Leave vote. The film had a budget of £100,000, funded by [[crowdfunding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityam.com/235494/eu-referendum-filmmaker-martin-durkin-says-brexit-the-movie-crowdfunding-campaign-has-hit-its-100000-target-ahead-of-its-may-release-date|title=Brexit: The Movie crowdfunding campaign hits its target|first=Emma |last=Haslett|date=26 February 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Schönburg Castle''' is in the municipality of Schönburg 4.5 kilometers east of [[Naumburg]] at the heart of [[Federal Republic of Germany]] in the State of [[Saxony-Anhalt]]. It has been proposed by Germany for inscription in the List of [[World Heritage]]. 

[[File:Schönburg Castle.jpg|thumb|Schönburg Castle in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany]]

== Location ==
The Late Romanesque ruins of Schönburg Castle are on top of a mottled sandstone cliff by the [[Saale]] River, which is 40 metres high and declines sharply in the west. The castle was built with the local mottled [[sandstone]].

== History ==
The castle on top of the southern slopes of the Saale was erected as the most important castle in the 12th century on commission by the [[bishops]] of Naumburg. The bishops owned several castles within their territory to secure their assets. From 1158 at the latest, a free [[noble family]] that owned property around [[Naumburg]] named itself after the castle. It was first documented in 1137. Schönburg has been preserved to this day and is an example from the time of classical [[castle]] construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Zur Geschichte und Baugeschichte der Schönburg, Burgenlandkreis.

''In:'' Castles and palaces in Saxony-Anhalt.|page=15-79|author=Schmitt, Reinhard|publisher=Saxony-Anhalt|date=2003|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture ==
All the walls, gates and parts of the [[Palas]] have retained their original substance from the High Middle Ages, as have parts of the interior like visible [[chimneys]] dated to 1220 and decorated windows. The [[architecture]] and decorations found here correspond to other monuments in the World Heritage nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die Schönburg. Bischofsburg zu Naumburg.

== World Heritage Nomination ==
Schönburg Castle is one of the eleven components of the cultural landscape “[[Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut]]”. As a landmark the castle is an important part of the lines of sight connecting the [[cultural landscape]] as a whole.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The Förderverein Welterbe an Saale und Unstrut e.V. is the coordinating body for this nomination: http://www.naumburg-cathedral.de/.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Catharsis''' (from Greek {{lang|el|[[wikt:κάθαρσις|κάθαρσις]]}} {{transl|el|''katharsis''}} meaning "purification" or "cleansing") is the purification and purgation of emotions—particularly pity and fear—through art&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eKNK1YwHcQ4C&amp;pg=PA217 |title=catharsis |encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literature |publisher=Merriam-Webster |year=1995 |page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; or any extreme change in emotion that results in renewal and restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l2XgAAAAMAAJ&amp;q= | last = Berndtson | first = Arthur | title = Art, Expression, and Beauty | publisher = Krieger | year = 1975 | page = 235|isbn=9780882752174 | quote=The theory of catharsis has a disarming affinity with the expressional theory, since it emphasizes emotion, asserts a change in emotion as a result of aesthetic operations, and concludes on a note of freedom in relation to the emotion}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PvZYaJmH6LcC&amp;dq= | title=Looking for an Argument: Critical Encounters with the New Approaches to the Criticism of Shakespeare and His Contemporaries | first=Richard | last=Levin |year=2003 | page=42 | quote=Catharsis in Shakespearean tragedy involves ... some kind of restoration of order and a renewal or enhancement of our positive feelings for the hero.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a metaphor originally used by [[Aristotle]] in the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]],'' comparing the effects of [[tragedy]] on the mind of a spectator to the effect of a [[cathartic]] on the body.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0056%3Asection%3D1449b 1449b]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/99492/catharsis |title=catharsis (criticism) |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dramatic uses==
Catharsis is a term in [[drama|dramatic art]] that describes the effect of tragedy (or [[comedy]] and quite possibly other artistic forms)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Catharsis in Healing, Ritual, and Drama | first=Thomas J. | last = Scheff | authorlink=Thomas J. Scheff | isbn=0-595-15237-6|publisher=University of California Press | year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; principally on the audience (although some have speculated on characters in the drama as well). Nowhere does [[Aristotle]] explain the meaning of "catharsis" as he is using that term in the definition of tragedy in the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (1449b21-28). G.&amp;nbsp;F. Else argues that traditional, widely held interpretations of catharsis as "purification" or "purgation" have no basis in the text of the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', but are derived from the use of catharsis in other Aristotelian and non-Aristotelian contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Catharsis | journal = Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association | first = Leon | last = Golden | volume = 93 | pages = 51–60 | jstor = 283751 | doi = 10.2307/283751}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, a number of diverse interpretations of the meaning of this term have arisen. The term is often discussed along with Aristotle's concept of [[anagnorisis]].

D.&amp;nbsp;W. Lucas, in an authoritative edition of the ''Poetics'', comprehensively covers the various nuances inherent in the meaning of the term in an Appendix devoted to "Pity, Fear, and Katharsis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aristotle: Poetics|last=Lucas|first=D. W.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1977|isbn=978-0198140245|pages=276–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas recognizes the possibility of catharsis bearing some aspect of the meaning of "purification, purgation, and 'intellectual clarification'" although his discussion of these terms is not always, or perhaps often, in the precise form with which other influential scholars have treated them. Lucas himself does not accept any one of these interpretations as his own but adopts a rather different one based on "the Greek doctrine of Humours" which has not received wide subsequent acceptance. Purgation and purification, used in previous centuries, as the common interpretations of catharsis are still in wide use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catharsis in Psychotherapy | first1=Michael P. | last1=Nichols | first2=Melvin | last2=Zax |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc, New York|year=1977|isbn=978-0470990643}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, in the twentieth century, the interpretation of catharsis as "intellectual clarification" has arisen as a rival to the older views in describing the effect of catharsis on members of the audience.

===Purgation and purification===
In his works prior to the ''Poetics,'' Aristotle had used the term ''catharsis'' purely in its medical sense (usually referring to the evacuation of the ''katamenia''—the [[menstrual]] fluid or other reproductive material).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Belifiore | first = Elizabeth S. | title = Tragic Pleasures: Aristotle on Plot and Emotion | page = 300 | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, however, he employs it as a medical [[metaphor]].
[[F. L. Lucas]] maintains, therefore, that ''purification'' and ''cleansing'' are not proper translations for ''catharsis''; that it should rather be rendered as ''[[Purgatory|purgation]]''. "It is the human soul that is purged of its excessive passions."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L. ''Tragedy in Relation to Aristotle's Poetics'', p.&amp;nbsp;24&lt;/ref&gt; Gerald F. Else made the following argument against the "purgation" theory: "It presupposes that we come to the tragic drama (unconsciously, if you will) as patients to be cured, relieved, restored to psychic health. But there is not a word to support this in the "Poetics", not a hint that the end of drama is to cure or alleviate pathological states. On the contrary it is evident in every line of the work that Aristotle is presupposing 'normal' auditors, normal states of mind and feeling, normal emotional and aesthetic experience."&lt;ref&gt;Else, Gerald F. ''Aristotle's Poetics: The Argument'', p. 440. Cambridge, Massachusetts (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]] sidesteps the medical attribution. He translates ''catharsis'' as a purification, an experience that brings pity and fear into their proper balance: "In real life", he explained, "men are sometimes too much addicted to pity or fear, sometimes too little; tragedy brings them back to a virtuous and happy mean."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L. ''Tragedy in Relation to Aristotle's Poetics'', p.&amp;nbsp;23. Hogarth, 1928&lt;/ref&gt;
Tragedy is then a corrective; through watching tragedy, the audience learns how to feel these emotions at proper levels.

===Intellectual clarification===
In the twentieth century a paradigm shift took place in the interpretation of catharsis with a number of scholars contributing to the argument in support of the intellectual clarification concept.&lt;ref&gt;The following works can be usefully consulted in this regard: L. Golden, "Aristotle on Tragic and Comic Mimesis," Atlanta, 1992; S. Halliwell, "Aristotle's Poetics," London, 1986; D. Keesey, "On Some Recent Interpretations of Catharsis, "The Classical World", (1979) 72.4, 193–205.&lt;/ref&gt; The clarification theory of catharsis would be fully consistent, as other interpretations are not, with Aristotle's argument in chapter 4 of the ''Poetics'' (1448b4-17) that the essential pleasure of [[mimesis]] is the intellectual pleasure of "learning and inference".

It is generally understood that Aristotle's theory of mimesis and catharsis are responses to [[Plato]]'s negative view of artistic mimesis on an audience. Plato argued that the most common forms of artistic mimesis were designed to evoke from an audience powerful emotions such as pity, fear, and ridicule which override the rational control that defines the highest level of our humanity and lead us to wallow unacceptably in the overindulgence of emotion and passion. Aristotle's concept of catharsis, in all of the major senses attributed to it, contradicts Plato's view by providing a mechanism that generates the rational control of irrational emotions. All of the commonly held interpretations of catharsis, purgation, purification, and clarification are considered by most scholars to represent a homeopathic process in which pity and fear accomplish the catharsis of emotions like themselves. For an alternate view of catharsis as an [[Allopathic medicine|allopathic]] process in which pity and fear produce a catharsis of emotions unlike pity and fear, see E. Belfiore, ''Tragic Pleasures: Aristotle on Plot and Emotion.'' Princeton, 1992, 260 ff.

===Literary analysis of catharsis===
The following analysis by [[E. R. Dodds]], directed at the character of [[Oedipus]] in the paradigmatic Aristotelian tragedy, ''[[Oedipus Rex]],'' incorporates all three of the aforementioned interpretations of catharsis: purgation, purification, intellectual clarification:{{quote|...what fascinates us is the spectacle of a man freely choosing, from the highest motives a series of actions which lead to his own ruin. Oedipus might have left the plague to take its course; but pity for the sufferings of his people compelled him to consult Delphi. When Apollo's word came back, he might still have left the murder of Laius uninvestigated; but piety and justice required him to act. He need not have forced the truth from the reluctant Theban herdsman; but because he cannot rest content with a lie, he must tear away the last veil from the illusion in which he has lived so long. Teiresias, Jocasta, the herdsman, each in turn tries to stop him, but in vain; he must read the last riddle, the riddle of his own life. The immediate cause of Oedipus' ruin is not "fate or "the gods"—no oracle said that he must discover the truth—and still less does it lie in his own weakness; what causes his ruin is his own strength and courage, his loyalty to Thebes, and his loyalty to the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=E. R. | last=Dodds | authorlink=E. R. Dodds | title=On Misunderstanding the 'Oedipus Rex' | journal=Greece and Rome |volume=13 |issue=1 |year=1966 |pages=37–49 |jstor=642354 | doi=10.1017/s0017383500016144}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Attempts to subvert catharsis===
There have been, for political or aesthetic reasons, deliberate attempts made to subvert the effect of catharsis in theatre.
For example, [[Bertolt Brecht]] viewed catharsis as a pap (pabulum) for the [[bourgeois]] theatre audience, and designed dramas which left significant emotions unresolved, intending to force social action upon the audience. Brecht then identified the concept of catharsis with the notion of identification of the spectator, meaning a complete adhesion of the viewer to the dramatic actions and characters. Brecht reasoned that the absence of a cathartic resolution would require the audience to take political action in the real world, in order to fill the emotional gap they had experienced vicariously. This technique can be seen as early as his [[agit-prop]] play ''[[The Measures Taken]],'' and is mostly the source of his invention of an ''epic theatre'', based on a [[distancing effect]] (Verfremdungseffekt) between the viewer and the representation or portrayal of characters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht, Bertold]], "La dramaturgie non aristotélicienne", ''Théâtre épique, théâtre dialectique'', éd. Jean-Marie Valentin, Paris, Éditions de L'Arche, 1999, pp. 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

=="Catharsis" before tragedy==
Catharsis before the sixth-century rise of tragedy is, for the [[Western World]], essentially a historical footnote to the Aristotelian conception. The practice of [[Ritual purification|purification]] had not yet appeared in [[Homer]], as later Greek commentators noted:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Walter | last = Burkert | authorlink = Walter Burkert | year = 1992 | title = The Orientalizing Revolution: Near Eastern Influence on Greek Culture in the Early Archaic Age | page = 56 | publisher = Harvard University Press | ref=harv}} This sub-section depends largely on Burkert.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Aithiopis]]'', an [[epic (poetry)|epic]] set in the [[Epic Cycle|Trojan War cycle]], narrates the purification of [[Achilles]] after his murder of [[Thersites]]. Catharsis describes the result of measures taken to cleanse away blood-guilt—"blood is purified through blood",{{sfnp|Burkert|1992|p=56}} a process in the development of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] culture in which the [[Delphi|oracle of Delphi]] took a prominent role. The classic example—[[Orestes]]—belongs to tragedy, but the procedure given by [[Aeschylus]] is ancient: the blood of a sacrificed piglet is allowed to wash over the blood-polluted man, and running water washes away the blood.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert notes parallels with a bilingual [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]-[[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] ritual text: "the knowledgeable specialist, the sacrificial piglet, slaughter, contact with blood, and the subsequent cleansing with water" {{harvtxt|Burkert|1992|page=58}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The identical ritual is represented, Burkert informs us, on a ''[[krater]]'' found at Canicattini, wherein it is shown being employed to cure the daughters of [[Proetus]] from their madness, caused by some ritual transgression.{{sfnp|Burkert|1992|p=57}} To the question of whether the ritual obtains [[atonement (penal substitution view)|atonement]] for the subject, or just [[healing]], Burkert answers: "To raise the question is to see the irrelevance of this distinction".{{sfnp|Burkert|1992|p=57}}

==Therapeutic uses==&lt;!-- 'Cathartic method' redirects here --&gt;
In [[psychology]], the term was first employed by [[Sigmund Freud]]'s colleague [[Josef Breuer]] (1842–1925), who developed a '''cathartic method'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; of treatment using [[hypnosis]] for persons suffering from intensive [[hysteria]]. While under hypnosis, Breuer's patients were able to recall [[psychological trauma|traumatic]] experiences, and through the process of expressing the original emotions that had been repressed and forgotten, they were relieved of their hysteric symptoms. Catharsis was also central to Freud's concept of [[psychoanalysis]], but he replaced hypnosis with [[Free association (psychology)|free association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Strickland | editor-first=Bonnie | editor-link=Bonnie Strickland | title=Catharsis | publisher=Gale | year=2001 | url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''[[cathexis|catharsis]]'' has also been adopted by modern [[psychotherapy]], particularly Freudian psychoanalysis, to describe the act of expressing, or more accurately, ''experiencing'' the deep emotions often associated with events in the individual's past which had originally been repressed or ignored, and had never been adequately addressed or experienced.

There has been much debate about the use of catharsis in the reduction of anger.

== Social catharsis ==
Emotional situations can elicit physiological, behavioral, cognitive, expressive, and subjective changes in individuals. Affected individuals often use social sharing as a cathartic release of emotions. Bernard Rimé studies the patterns of social sharing after emotional experiences. His works suggest that individuals seek social outlets in an attempt to modify the situation and restore personal homeostatic balance.

Rimé found that 80–95% of emotional episodes are shared. The affected individuals talk about the emotional experience recurrently to people around them throughout the following hours, days, or weeks. These results indicate that this response is irrespective of emotional valence, gender, education, and culture. His studies also found that social sharing of emotion increases as the intensity of the emotion increases.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Emotion Elicits the Social Sharing of Emotion: Theory and Empirical Review|journal = Emotion Review|year=2009|issn = 1754-0739|pages = 60–85|volume = 1|issue = 1|doi = 10.1177/1754073908097189|first = Bernard|last = Rimé}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stages ===
[[Émile Durkheim]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The elementary forms of the religious life, a study in religious sociology | last = Durkheim | first = Émile |url = https://archive.org/details/elementaryformso00durk | publisher = George Allen &amp; Unwin | translator-first = Joseph Ward | translator-last = Swain | year = 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed emotional stages of social sharing:
# Directly after emotional effects, the emotions are shared. Through sharing, there is a reciprocal stimulation of emotions and emotional communion.
# This leads to social effects like social integration and strengthening of beliefs.
# Finally, individuals experience a renewed trust in life, strength, and self-confidence.

=== Motives ===
Affect scientists have found differences in motives for social sharing of positive and negative emotions.

'''(1) Positive emotion'''

A study by Langston&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Capitalizing on and coping with daily-life events: Expressive responses to positive events|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|pages = 1112–1125|volume = 67|issue = 6|doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.67.6.1112|first = Christopher A.|last = Langston}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that individuals share positive events to capitalize on the positive emotions they elicit. Reminiscing the positive experience augments positive affects like temporary mood and longer-term well-being. A study by Gable et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = What Do You Do When Things Go Right? The Intrapersonal and Interpersonal Benefits of Sharing Positive Events|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|pages = 228–245|volume = 87|issue = 2|doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.87.2.228|first = Shelly L.|last = Gable|first2 = Harry T.|last2 = Reis|first3 = Emily A.|last3 = Impett|first4 = Evan R.|last4 = Asher|pmid=15301629}}&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed Langston's "capitalization" theory by demonstrating that relationship quality is enhanced when partners are responsive to positive recollections. The responsiveness increased levels of intimacy and satisfaction within the relationship. In general, the motives behind social sharing of positive events are to recall the positive emotions, inform others, and gain attention from others. All three motives are representatives of capitalization.

'''(2) Negative emotion'''

Rimé studies suggest that the motives behind social sharing of negative emotions are to vent, understand, bond, and gain social support. Negatively affected individuals often seek life meaning and emotional support to combat feelings of loneliness after a tragic event.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== The grapevine effect ===
If emotions are shared socially and elicits emotion in the listener then the listener will likely share what they heard with other people. Rimé calls this process "secondary social sharing". If this repeats, it is then called "tertiary social sharing".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Collective catharsis ===
Collective emotional events share similar responses. When communities are affected by an emotional event, members repetitively share emotional experiences. After the 2001 New York and the 2004 Madrid terrorist attacks, more than 80% of respondents shared their emotional experience with others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social sharing of emotion, post-traumatic growth, and emotional climate: Follow-up of Spanish citizen's response to the collective trauma of March 11th terrorist attacks in Madrid| journal = European Journal of Social Psychology| year=2009|issn = 1099-0992|pages = 1029–1045|volume = 40|issue = 6|doi = 10.1002/ejsp.700|first = Bernard|last = Rimé|first2 = Darío|last2 = Páez|first3 = Nekane|last3 = Basabe|first4 = Francisco|last4 = Martínez}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rimé, every sharing round elicits emotional reactivation in the sender and the receiver. This then reactivates the need to share in both. Social sharing throughout the community leads to high amounts of emotional recollection and "emotional overheating".

Pennebaker and Harber&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Social Stage Model of Collective Coping: The Loma Prieta Earthquake and The Persian Gulf War|journal = Journal of Social Issues | year = 1993 |issn = 1540-4560|pages = 125–145|volume = 49|issue = 4|doi = 10.1111/j.1540-4560.1993.tb01184.x|first = James W.|last = Pennebaker|first2 = Kent D.|last2 = Harber}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined three stages of collective responses to emotional events.

In the first stage, a state of "emergency" takes place in the first month after the emotional event. In this stage, there is an abundance of thoughts, talks, media coverage, and social integration based on the event.

In the second stage, the "plateau" occurs in the second month. Abundant thoughts remain, but the amount of talks, media coverage, and social integration decreases.

In the third stage, the "extinction" occurs after the second month. There is a return to normalcy.

=== Effect on emotional recovery ===
This cathartic release of emotions is often believed to be therapeutic for affected individuals. Many therapeutic mechanisms have been seen to aid in emotional recovery. One example is "interpersonal emotion regulation", in which listeners help to modify the affected individual's affective state by using certain strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Social Regulation of Emotion: An Integrative, Cross-Disciplinary Model|journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=20|issue=1|pages=47–63|year=2016|issn = 1879-307X|pmid = 26564248|doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2015.09.003|first = Crystal|last = Reeck|first2 = Daniel R.|last2 = Ames|first3 = Kevin N.|last3 = Ochsner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expressive writing is another common mechanism for catharsis. Joanne Frattaroli&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Experimental disclosure and its moderators: A meta-analysis|journal = Psychological Bulletin|pages = 823–865|volume = 132|issue = 6|doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.132.6.823|first = Joanne|last = Frattaroli}}&lt;/ref&gt; published a meta-analysis suggesting that written disclosure of information, thoughts, and feelings enhances mental health.

However, other studies question the benefits of social catharsis. Finkenauer and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Flashbulb memories and the underlying mechanisms of their formation: Toward an emotional-integrative model|journal = Memory &amp; Cognition|year=1998|issn = 0090-502X|pages = 516–531|volume = 26|issue = 3|doi = 10.3758/BF03201160|first = Catrin|last = Finkenauer|first2 = Olivier|last2 = Luminet|first3 = Lydia|last3 = Gisle|first4 = Abdessadek|last4 = El-Ahmadi|first5 = Martial Van Der|last5 = Linden|first6 = Pierre|last6 = Philippot|pmid=9610122}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that non-shared memories were no more emotionally triggering than shared ones. Other studies have also failed to prove that social catharsis leads to any degree of emotional recovery. Zech and Rimé&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Is talking about an emotional experience helpful? effects on emotional recovery and perceived benefits|journal = Clinical Psychology &amp; Psychotherapy|year = 2005|issn = 1099-0879|pages = 270–287|volume = 12|issue = 4|doi = 10.1002/cpp.460|first = Emmanuelle|last = Zech|first2 = Bernard|last2 = Rimé}}&lt;/ref&gt; asked participants to recall and share a negative experience with an experimenter. When compared with the control group that only discussed unemotional topics, there was no correlation between emotional sharing and emotional recovery.

Some studies even found adverse effects of social catharsis. Contrary to the Frattaroli study, Sbarra and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Expressive Writing Can Impede Emotional Recovery Following Marital Separation|url = http://cpx.sagepub.com/content/1/2/120|journal = Clinical Psychological Science|year = 2013|issn = 2167-7026|pmc = 4297672|pmid = 25606351|pages = 120–134|volume = 1|issue = 2|doi = 10.1177/2167702612469801|first = David A.|last = Sbarra|first2 = Adriel|last2 = Boals|first3 = Ashley E.|last3 = Mason|first4 = Grace M.|last4 = Larson|first5 = Matthias R.|last5 = Mehl}}&lt;/ref&gt; found expressive writing to greatly impede emotional recovery following a marital separation. Similar findings have been published regarding trauma recovery. A group intervention technique is often used on disaster victims to prevent trauma-related disorders. However, meta-analysis showed negative effects of this cathartic "therapy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Single session debriefing after psychological trauma: a meta-analysis|journal = Lancet|year = 2002|issn = 0140-6736|pmid = 12241834|pages = 766–771|volume = 360|issue = 9335|doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)09897-5|first = Arnold A.

[[File:Clothes.jpg|thumb|[[History of clothing and textiles|Clothing in history]], showing (from top) Egyptians, Ancient Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Franks, and 13th through 15th century Europeans.]]

'''Clothing''' (also known as '''clothes''', '''apparel''' and '''attire''') is a collective term for items worn on the body. Clothing can be made of [[textile]]s, [[animal skin]], or other thin sheets of materials put together. The wearing of clothing is mostly restricted to [[human being]]s and is a feature of all human [[societies]]. The amount and type of clothing worn depend on body type, social, and geographic considerations. Some clothing can be gender-specific.

Physically, clothing serves many purposes: it can serve as protection from the [[weather|elements]] and can enhance safety during hazardous activities such as [[hiking]] and [[cooking]]. It protects the wearer from rough surfaces, rash-causing plants, [[Insect bites and stings|insect bites]], [[splinter]]s, [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|thorns and prickles]] by providing a barrier between the skin and the environment. Clothes can insulate against cold or hot conditions, and they can provide a [[hygienic]] barrier, keeping infectious and toxic materials away from the body. Clothing also provides protection from [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]].

Wearing clothes is also a [[Dress code|social norm]], and being deprived of clothing in front of others may be [[Embarrassment|embarrassing]], or not wearing clothes in public such that [[Sex organ#Mammals|genitals]], [[breast]]s or [[buttocks]] are visible could be seen as [[indecent exposure]].

== Origin of clothing ==
{{see also|Evolution of hair|History of clothing and textiles}}
There is no easy way to determine when clothing was first developed, but some information has been inferred by studying lice which estimates the introduction of clothing at roughly 42,000–72,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Ralf Kittler, Manfred Kayser &amp; Mark Stoneking |journal=[[Current Biology]] |volume=13 |pages=1414–1417 |year=2003 |title=Molecular evolution of ''Pediculus humanus'' and the origin of clothing |url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/pdf/Kittler.CurBiol.2003.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(03)00507-4 |pmid=12932325 |issue=16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910120019/http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/pdf/Kittler.CurBiol.2003.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stoneking"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.12.024|title=Molecular Evolution of Pediculus humanus and the Origin of Clothing|journal=Current Biology|volume=14|issue=24|page=2309|year=2004|last1=Kittler|first1=Ralf|last2=Kayser|first2=Manfred|last3=Stoneking|first3=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/1/29.full "...Lice Indicates Early Clothing Use ..."], Mol Biol Evol (2011) 28 (1): 29–32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The most obvious function of clothing is to improve the comfort of the wearer, by protecting the wearer from the elements. In hot climates, clothing provides protection from [[sunburn]] or [[wind]] damage, while in cold climates its thermal insulation properties are generally more important. Shelter usually reduces the functional need for clothing. For example, [[Coat (clothing)|coats]], [[hat]]s, [[glove]]s and other outer layers are normally removed when entering a warm home, particularly if one is living or sleeping there. Similarly, clothing has seasonal and regional aspects, so that thinner materials and fewer layers of clothing are generally worn in warmer regions and seasons than in colder ones.

Clothing performs a range of social and [[culture|cultural]] functions, such as individual, occupational and gender differentiation, and social status.&lt;ref name="Flugel1930"&gt;{{citation |date=1976|origyear= 1930 |author=Flugel, John Carl |title=The Psychology of Clothes |series=International Psycho-analytical Library |volume=No.18 |publisher=New York: AMS Press. First published by Hogarth Press, London | isbn = 0-404-14721-6 }} Alternative {{ISBN|978-0-404-14721-1}} (This work is one of the earliest attempts at an overview of the psycho-social and practical functions of clothing)&lt;/ref&gt; In many societies, norms about clothing reflect standards of [[modesty]], [[religion]], [[gender]], and [[social status]]. Clothing may also function as a form of adornment and an expression of personal taste or style.

Clothing can be and has in the past been made from a very wide variety of materials. [[Clothing material|Materials]] have ranged from leather and furs to woven materials, to elaborate and exotic natural and synthetic fabrics. Not all body coverings are regarded as clothing. Articles carried rather than worn (such as [[Handbag|purses]]), worn on a single part of the body and easily removed ([[scarves]]), worn purely for adornment ([[jewelry]]), or those that serve a function other than protection ([[eyeglasses]]), are normally considered [[fashion accessory|accessories]] rather than clothing, except for shoes.

Clothing protects against many things that might injure the uncovered human body. Clothes protect people from the elements, including rain, snow, wind, and other weather, as well as from the sun. However, clothing that is too sheer, thin, small, tight, etc., offers less protection. Appropriate clothes can also reduce risk during activities such as work or sport. Some clothing protects from specific hazards, such as [[insect]]s, noxious chemicals, weather, [[weapons]], and contact with abrasive substances. Conversely, clothing may protect the environment from the clothing wearer: for instance doctors wear [[scrubs (clothing)|medical scrubs]].

Humans have been ingenious in devising clothing solutions to environmental or other hazards: such as [[space suits]], [[air conditioned clothing]], [[armor]], [[diving suits]], [[swimsuits]], [[Beekeeping#Protective clothing|bee-keeper gear]], [[motorcycle leathers]], [[high-visibility clothing]], and other pieces of [[protective clothing]]. Meanwhile, the distinction between clothing and protective equipment is not always clear-cut, since clothes designed to be fashionable often have protective value and clothes designed for function often consider fashion in their design. The choice of clothes also has social implications. They cover parts of the body that social norms require to be covered, act as a form of adornment, and serve other social purposes. Someone who lacks the means to procure reasonable clothing due to poverty or affordability, or simply lack of inclination, is sometimes said to be scruffy, ragged, or shabby.&lt;ref&gt;Baradel, Lacey. "Geographic Mobility and Domesticity in Eastman Johnson’s The Tramp." American Art 28.2 (2014): 26–49&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==
Although dissertations on clothing and its functions appear from the 19th century as colonists dealt with new environments,&lt;ref name="Jeffreys1858"&gt;e.g. {{citation |year=1858 |author=Jeffreys, Julius |title=The British Army in India: Its Preservation by an appropriate Clothing, Housing, Locating, Recreative Employment, and Hopeful Encouragement of the Troops |place=London |publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, Longmans &amp; Roberts |url=https://archive.org/stream/britisharmyinin01jeffgoog#page/n7/mode/1up |accessdate=8 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; there was concerted scientific research into psycho-social, physiological and other functions of clothing (e.g. protective, cartage{{clarify|date=September 2018}}) in the first half of the 20th century, with publications such as [[J.C. Flügel]]'s ''Psychology of Clothes'' in 1930,&lt;ref name="Flugel1930" /&gt; and Newburgh's seminal ''Physiology of Heat Regulation and The Science of Clothing'' in 1949.&lt;ref name="Newburgh1968"&gt;{{citation |date=1968|origyear= 1949 |editor=Newburgh, Louis Harry |title=Physiology of Heat Regulation and The Science of Clothing |place=New York &amp; London |publisher=Hafner Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1968, the field of environmental physiology had advanced and expanded significantly, but the science of clothing in relation to environmental physiology had changed little.&lt;ref name="Hertig1969"&gt;{{citation |date=February 1969 |author=Hertig, Bruce A |title=Book review: Physiology of Heat Regulation and the Science of Clothing |journal=[[Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine]] |volume=11 |issue=2 |page=100 |url=http://journals.lww.com/joem/Citation/1969/02000/Physiology_of_Heat_Regulation_and_the_Science_of.12.aspx |accessdate=8 September 2010 |doi=10.1097/00043764-196902000-00012|pmc=1520373 }} (reviewer's name appears next to Newburgh, but was not the co-author. See also reviewer's name at bottom of page).&lt;/ref&gt; There has since been considerable research, and the knowledge base has grown significantly, but the main concepts remain unchanged, and indeed Newburgh's book is still cited by contemporary authors, including those attempting to develop thermoregulatory models of clothing development.&lt;ref name="Gilligan2010"&gt;{{citation |date=January 2010 |author=Gilligan, Ian |title=The Prehistoric Development of Clothing: Archaeological Implications of a Thermal Model |journal=Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=15–80 |doi=10.1007/s10816-009-9076-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural aspects==

===Gender differentiation===
[[File:3rd Duke of Fife in Kilt. Allan Warren.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Former 3rd Duke of Fife wearing a traditional [[Scottish kilt]] (1984)]]
[[File:Shinzō Abe and Ivanka Trump (4).jpg|thumb|upright|Advisor to [[US President]] and businesswoman [[Ivanka Trump]] (right) along with [[Japanese Prime Minister|Japanese PM]] [[Shinzō Abe]] wearing Western-style [[business suit]]s as per their gender, 2017]]

In most cultures, gender differentiation of clothing is considered appropriate. The differences are in styles, colors, and fabrics.

In Western societies, [[skirt]]s, [[Dress (garment)|dresses]] and [[high-heeled shoe]]s are usually seen as women's clothing, while [[necktie]]s are usually seen as men's clothing. [[Trousers]] were once seen as exclusively male clothing, but can nowadays be worn by both genders. Male clothes are often more practical (that is, they can function well under a wide variety of situations), but a wider range of clothing styles are available for females. Males are typically allowed to [[bare chested|bare their chests]] in a greater variety of public places. It is generally acceptable for a woman to wear clothing perceived as masculine, while the opposite is seen as unusual.

In some cultures, [[sumptuary law]]s regulate what men and women are required to wear. [[Islam]] requires women to wear more modest forms of attire, usually [[hijab]]. What qualifies as "modest" varies in different Muslim societies. However, women are usually required to cover more of their bodies than men are. Articles of clothing Muslim women wear for modesty range from the [[headscarf|head-scarf]] to the [[burqa]].

Men may sometimes choose to wear [[men's skirts]] such as [[togas]] or [[kilt]]s in particular cultures, especially on ceremonial occasions. Such garments were (in previous times) often worn as normal daily clothing by men.

Clothing designed to be worn by either sex is called [[unisex clothing]]. Unisex clothes, such as T-shirts, tend to be cut straighter to fit a wider variety of bodies. The majority of unisex clothing styles have started out as menswear, but some articles, like the [[fedora]], were originally worn by women.

===Social status===

[[File:Prokudin-Gorskii-19.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Mohammed Alim Khan|Alim Khan]]'s bemedaled [[robe]] sends a social message about his wealth, status, and power.]]
In some societies, clothing may be used to indicate rank or [[social status|status]]. In [[ancient Rome]], for example, only senators could wear garments dyed with [[Tyrian purple]]. In traditional [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiian]] society, only high-ranking chiefs could wear [[feather cloak]]s and palaoa, or carved [[whale]] teeth. In China, before establishment of the [[Republic of China|republic]], only the emperor could wear [[yellow]]. History provides many examples of elaborate [[sumptuary law]]s that regulated what people could wear. In societies without such laws, which includes most modern societies, social status is instead signaled by the purchase of rare or luxury items that are limited by cost to those with wealth or status. In addition, [[peer pressure]] influences clothing choice.

===Religion===

[[File:Takbir of prayer.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Muslim]] men traditionally wear white robes and a cap during prayers]]
Some religious clothing might be considered a special case of occupational clothing. Sometimes it is worn only during the performance of religious ceremonies. However, it may also be worn every day as a marker for special religious status.

For example, [[Jain]]s and Muslim men wear unstitched [[cloth]] pieces when performing religious ceremonies. The unstitched cloth signifies unified and complete devotion to the task at hand, with no digression.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Sikhs wear a turban as it is a part of their religion.

The cleanliness of religious dresses in Eastern religions like [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Islam]] and [[Jainism]] is of paramount importance since it indicates purity.

Clothing appears in numerous contexts in the [[Bible]]; the most prominent passages are: the story of [[Adam and Eve]] who made coverings for themselves out of [[fig leaf|fig leaves]], [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]]'s [[Coat of many colors|cloak]], [[Judah (Bible)|Judah]] and [[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]], [[Mordecai]] and [[Esther]]. Furthermore, the priests officiating in the Temple in Jerusalem had very specific garments, the lack of which made one liable to death.

The Quran says about husbands and wives, regarding clothing: "...They are clothing/covering (Libaas) for you; and you for them" (chapter 2:187).

Jewish ritual also requires rending of one's upper garment as a sign of mourning. This practice is found in the Bible when Jacob hears of the apparent death of his son Joseph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.divreinavon.com/pdf/BegedSimlaJBQ.pdf |title= ?|author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=9 August 2010}}{{Self-published inline|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and history==
{{Main|History of clothing}}
{{See also|History of Western fashion|Category:History of clothing}}

===Early use===
According to archaeologists and anthropologists, the earliest clothing likely consisted of [[fur]], [[leather]], leaves, or grass that were draped, wrapped, or tied around the body. Knowledge of such clothing remains inferential, since clothing materials deteriorate quickly compared to stone, bone, shell and metal artifacts. Archeologists have identified very early [[sewing needle]]s of bone and ivory from about 30,000 BC, found near [[Kostenki]], [[Russia]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffecker, J., Scott, J., ''Excavations In Eastern Europe Reveal Ancient Human Lifestyles'', University of Colorado at Boulder News Archive, March 21, 2002, [http://www.colorado.edu/news/r/b278a670675fd8d2ca0700cdc0e9d808.html colorado.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719175257/http://www.colorado.edu/news/r/b278a670675fd8d2ca0700cdc0e9d808.html |date=2011-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dyed [[flax]] fibers that could have been used in clothing have been found in a prehistoric cave in the [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]] that date back to 34,000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Balter M | year = 2009 | title = Clothes Make the (Hu) Man | url = | journal = Science | volume = 325 | issue = 5946| page = 1329 | doi = 10.1126/science.325_1329a | pmid = 19745126 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kvavadze E, Bar-Yosef O, Belfer-Cohen A, Boaretto E, Jakeli N, Matskevich Z, Meshveliani T | year = 2009 | title = 30,000-Year-Old Wild Flax Fibers | url = http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:4270521| journal = Science | volume = 325 | issue = 5946| page = 1359 | doi = 10.1126/science.1175404 | pmid = 19745144 }} [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/data/325/5946/1359/DC1/1 Supporting Online Material]&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists are still debating when people started wearing clothes. Ralf Kittler, Manfred Kayser and Mark Stoneking, [[anthropology|anthropologists]] at the [[Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology]], have conducted a genetic analysis of human [[body lice]] that suggests clothing originated around 170,000 years ago. Body lice are an indicator of clothes-wearing, since most humans have sparse body hair, and lice thus require human clothing to survive. Their research suggests that the invention of clothing may have coincided with the northward migration of modern ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' away from the warm [[climate]] of [[Africa]], thought to have begun between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. However, a second group of researchers using similar genetic methods estimate that clothing originated around 540,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Reed  ''et al.'' | year = 2004 | title =  Genetic Analysis of Lice Supports Direct Contact between Modern and Archaic Humans| journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 11| page = e340 | doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020340 | pmid=15502871 | pmc=521174}}&lt;/ref&gt; For now, the date of the origin of clothing remains unresolved.

===Making clothing===
{{See also|Garment industry||knitting|weaving}}
Some human cultures, such as the various peoples of the [[Arctic Circle]], traditionally make their clothing entirely of prepared and decorated furs and skins. Other cultures supplemented or replaced leather and skins with cloth: woven, knitted, or twined from various animal and vegetable fibers including wool, [[linen]], [[cotton]], [[silk]], hemp, and [[ramie]].

Although modern consumers may take the production of clothing for granted, making fabric by hand is a tedious and labor-intensive process involving fiber making, spinning, and weaving. The [[textile]] industry was the first to be mechanized&amp;nbsp;– with the [[power loom|powered loom]]&amp;nbsp;– during the [[Industrial Revolution]].

Different cultures have evolved various ways of creating clothes out of cloth. One approach simply involves draping the cloth. Many people wore, and still wear, garments consisting of rectangles of cloth wrapped to fit&amp;nbsp;– for example, the [[dhoti]] for men and the [[sari]] for women in the [[Indian subcontinent]], the Scottish [[kilt]] and the [[Java (island)|Javanese]] [[sarong]]. The clothes may simply be tied up (dhoti and sari); or pins or belts hold the garments in place (kilt and sarong). The cloth remains uncut, and people of various [[Clothing sizes|sizes]] can wear the garment.

Another approach involves measuring, cutting, and sewing the cloth by hand or with a [[sewing machine]]. Clothing can be cut from a [[sewing pattern]] and adjusted by a tailor to the wearer's measurements. An adjustable sewing mannequin or [[dress form]] is used to create form-fitting clothing. If the fabric is expensive, the tailor tries to use every bit of the cloth rectangle in constructing the clothing; perhaps cutting triangular pieces from one corner of the cloth, and adding them elsewhere as [[gusset]]s. Traditional European patterns for men's [[shirt]]s and women's [[chemise]]s take this approach. These remnants can also be reused to make patchwork hats, vests, and skirts.

Modern European [[fashion]] treats cloth much less conservatively, typically cutting in such a way as to leave various odd-shaped cloth remnants. Industrial sewing operations sell these as waste; home sewers may turn them into [[quilt]]s.

In the thousands of years that humans have been making clothing, they have created an astonishing array of styles, many of which have been reconstructed from surviving garments, [[photo]]s, [[painting]]s, [[mosaic]]s, etc., as well as from written descriptions. Costume history can inspire current [[fashion designer]]s, as well as costumiers for [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[film]]s, [[television]], and [[historical reenactment]].

==Contemporary clothing==
{{POV section|date=July 2017}}
{{Western dress codes}}

=== Western dress code ===
{{main|Western dress code}}
The Western dress code has changed over the past 500+ years.  The mechanization of the [[textile industry]] made many varieties of cloth widely available at affordable prices.  Styles have changed, and the availability of [[synthetic fabric]]s has changed the definition of "stylish".  In the latter half of the 20th century, [[jeans|blue jeans]] became very popular, and are now worn to events that normally demand formal attire.  [[Activewear]] has also become a large and growing market.

Jeans in the Western dress code are worn by both men and women. There are several unique styles of jeans found which include: high rise jeans, mid rise jeans, low rise jeans, bootcut jeans, straight jeans, cropped jeans, skinny jeans, cuffed jeans, boyfriend jeans, and capri jeans.

The licensing of designer names was pioneered by designers like [[Pierre Cardin]] in the 1960s and has been a common practice within the [[fashion industry]] from about the 1970s. Among the more popular include [[Marc Jacobs]] and [[Gucci]], named for Marc Jacobs and Guccio Gucci respectively.

=== Spread of western styles ===
[[File:Move In Day 2011 (6099706937) (cropped).jpg|thumb|University students in [[casual clothes]] in US.]]

By the early years of the 21st century, western clothing styles had, to some extent, become international styles. This process began hundreds of years earlier, during the periods of European [[colonialism]]. The process of cultural dissemination has perpetuated over the centuries as Western media corporations have penetrated markets throughout the world, spreading Western culture and styles. [[Fast fashion]] clothing has also become a global phenomenon. These garments are less expensive, mass-produced Western clothing. Donated [[used good|used]] clothing from Western countries are also delivered to people in poor countries by charity organizations.

=== Ethnic and cultural heritage ===
People may wear ethnic or [[national costume|national dress]] on special occasions or in certain roles or occupations. For example, most Korean men and women have adopted Western-style dress for daily wear, but still wear traditional [[hanbok]]s on special occasions, like weddings and cultural holidays. Items of Western dress may also appear worn or accessorized in distinctive, non-Western ways. A Tongan man may combine a used [[T-shirt]] with a Tongan wrapped skirt, or [[tupenu]].

===Sport and activity===
{{Main|Activewear|Sportswear (fashion)}}

Most sports and physical activities are practiced wearing special clothing, for practical, comfort or safety reasons. Common [[sportswear (activewear)|sportswear]] garments include [[shorts]], [[T-shirt]]s, [[tennis shirt]]s, [[leotard]]s, [[tracksuit]]s, and [[athletic shoe|trainers]]. Specialized garments include [[wet suit]]s (for [[human swimming|swimming]], [[Underwater diving|diving]] or [[surfing]]), [[salopettes]] (for [[skiing]]) and [[leotards]] (for [[gymnastics]]). Also, [[spandex]] materials are often used as base layers to soak up sweat. Spandex is also preferable for active sports that require form fitting garments, such as volleyball, wrestling, [[track &amp; field]], dance, gymnastics and swimming.

=== Fashion ===
{{Main|Fashion|2010s in fashion}}
Paris set the fashion trends for Europe and North America 1900–1940.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Louise Roberts,  "Samson and Delilah revisited: the politics of women's fashion in 1920s France." ''American Historical Review'' 98.3 (1993): 657–684.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1920s the goal was all about getting loose. Women wore dresses all day, everyday. Day dresses had a drop waist, which was a sash or belt around the low waist or hip and a skirt that hung anywhere from the ankle on up to the knee, never above. Daywear had sleeves(long to mid-bicep) and a skirt that was straight, pleaded, hank hem, or tired.  Jewelry was less conspicuous.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Bliss, "'L’intelligence de la parure': Notes on Jewelry Wearing in the 1920s." ''Fashion Theory'' 20.1 (2016): 5-26.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hair was often bobbed, giving a boyish look.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Zdatny,  "The Boyish Look and the Liberated Woman: The Politics and Aesthetics of Women's Hairstyles." ''Fashion Theory'' 1.4 (1997): 367–397.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century a diverse range of styles exist in fashion, varying by geography, exposure to modern media, economic conditions, and ranging from expensive [[haute couture]] to traditional garb, to [[thrift store]] [[grunge]].  [[Fashion show]]s are events for designers to show off new and often extravagant designs.

==Political issues==

===Working conditions in the garments industry===
{{further|Garment industry}}
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
[[File:Garments Factory in Bangladesh.JPG|thumb|Garments factory in Bangladesh]]
[[File:Safety garb for women workers. The uniform at the left, complete with the plastic "bra" on the right, will prevent... - NARA - 522882.jpg|thumb|upright|Safety garb for women workers in [[Los Angeles]], c. 1943, was designed to prevent occupational accidents among female war workers.]]

Although [[mechanization]] transformed most aspects of human industry by the mid-20th century, [[garment]] workers have continued to labor under challenging conditions that demand repetitive manual labor. [[Mass-produced]] clothing is often made in what are considered by some to be [[sweatshops]], typified by long work hours, lack of benefits, and lack of worker representation. While most examples of such conditions are found in [[developing countries]], clothes made in [[industrialized nation]]s may also be manufactured similarly.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Coalitions of [[NGO]]s, designers (including Katharine Hamnett, [[American Apparel]], [[Veja Sneakers|Veja]], [[Quiksilver]], eVocal, and Edun) and campaign groups like the [[Clean Clothes Campaign]] (CCC) and the [[Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights]] as well as [[textile and clothing trade unions]] have sought to improve these conditions as much as possible by sponsoring awareness-raising events, which draw the attention of both the media and the general public to the workers.

[[Outsourcing]] production to low wage countries like Bangladesh, China, India and Sri Lanka became possible when the [[Multi Fibre Agreement]] (MFA) was abolished. The MFA, which placed quotas on textiles imports, was deemed a [[protectionist]] measure.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Although many countries recognize treaties like the [[International Labour Organization]], which attempt to set standards for worker safety and rights, many countries have made exceptions to certain parts of the treaties or failed to thoroughly enforce them. India for example has not ratified sections 87 and 92 of the treaty.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Despite the strong reactions that "sweatshops" evoked among [[Anti-globalization movement|critics of globalization]], the [[textile industry|production of textiles]] has functioned as a consistent industry for developing nations providing work and wages, whether construed as exploitative or not, to many thousands of people.

===Fur===
{{Main|Fur clothing}}
The use of animal fur in clothing dates to prehistoric times. It is currently associated in developed countries with expensive, designer clothing, although fur is still used by indigenous people in arctic zones and higher elevations for its warmth and protection. Once uncontroversial, it has recently been the focus of campaigns on the grounds that campaigners consider it cruel and unnecessary. [[PETA]], along with other [[animal rights]] and [[animal liberation movement|animal liberation]] groups have called attention to [[fur farming]] and other practices they consider cruel.

==Life cycle==

===Clothing maintenance===
Clothing suffers assault both from within and without. The human body sheds skin cells and body oils, and exudes sweat, urine, and feces. From the outside, sun damage, moisture, abrasion, and dirt assault garments. Fleas and lice can hide in seams. Worn clothing, if not cleaned and refurbished, itches, becomes outworn, and loses functionality (as when [[button (clothing)|buttons]] fall off, seams come undone, fabrics thin or tear, and [[zipper]]s fail).

Often, people wear an item of clothing until it falls apart. Some materials present problems. Cleaning leather is difficult, and bark cloth (tapa) cannot be washed without dissolving it. Owners may patch tears and rips, and brush off surface dirt, but materials like these inevitably age.

However, most clothing consists of cloth, and most cloth can be [[laundry|laundered]] and mended (patching, [[darning]], but compare [[felt]]).

=== Laundry, ironing, storage ===
Humans have developed many specialized methods for laundering, ranging from early methods of pounding clothes against rocks in running streams, to the latest in electronic [[washing machine]]s and [[dry cleaning]] (dissolving dirt in [[solvents]] other than water). Hot water washing (boiling), chemical cleaning and ironing are all traditional methods of [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilizing]] fabrics for [[hygiene]] purposes.

Many kinds of clothing are designed to be [[Ironing|ironed]] before they are worn to remove wrinkles. Most modern formal and semi-formal clothing is in this category (for example, [[dress shirt]]s and [[suit (clothing)|suits]]). Ironed clothes are believed to look clean, fresh, and neat. Much contemporary casual clothing is made of knit materials that do not readily wrinkle, and do not require ironing. Some clothing is [[permanent press]], having been treated with a coating (such as [[polytetrafluoroethylene]]) that suppresses wrinkles and creates a smooth appearance without ironing.

Once clothes have been laundered and possibly ironed, they are usually hung on [[clothes hanger]]s or folded, to keep them fresh until they are worn. Clothes are folded to allow them to be stored compactly, to prevent creasing, to preserve creases or to present them in a more pleasing manner, for instance when they are put on sale in stores.

===Non-iron===
{{main|Permanent press}}
A resin used for making non-wrinkle shirts releases [[formaldehyde]], which could cause contact dermatitis for some people; no disclosure requirements exist, and in 2008 the U.S. [[Government Accountability Office]] tested formaldehyde in clothing and found that generally the highest levels were in non-wrinkle shirts and pants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/11/your-money/11wrinkle.html When Wrinkle-Free Clothing Also Means Formaldehyde Fumes]. ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, a study of the effect of washing on the formaldehyde levels found that after 6 months after washing, 7 of 27 shirts had levels in excess of 75 ppm, which is a safe limit for direct skin exposure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200006/000020000600A0121887.php Changes of Free Formaldehyde Quantity in Non-iron Shirts by Washing and Storage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722124023/http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200006/000020000600A0121887.php |date=2011-07-22 }}. ''Journal of Health Science''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mending===
{{see also|Darning}}
When the raw material&amp;nbsp;– cloth&amp;nbsp;– was worth more than labor, it made sense to expend labor in saving it. In past times, mending was an art. A meticulous [[tailor]] or [[seamstress]] could mend rips with thread raveled from [[hem]]s and seam edges so skillfully that the tear was practically invisible. Today clothing is considered a consumable item. Mass-manufactured clothing is less expensive than the labor required to repair it. Many people buy a new piece of clothing rather than spend time mending. The thrifty still replace [[zipper]]s and [[Button (clothing)|buttons]] and sew up ripped hems.

===Recycling===
Used, unwearable clothing can be repurposed for [[quilt]]s, [[:wikt:rag|rags]], [[Carpet|rugs]], [[bandage]]s, and many other household uses. It can also be recycled into [[paper]]. In Western societies, used clothing is often thrown out or donated to charity (such as through a [[clothing bin]]). It is also sold to [[consignment shop]]s, dress agencies, [[flea market]]s, and in [[online auction]]s. Used clothing is also often collected on an industrial scale to be sorted and shipped for re-use in poorer countries.  Globally, used clothes are worth $4 billion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Minter|first1=Adam|title=No One Wants Your Used Clothes Anymore|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-01-15/no-one-wants-your-used-clothes-anymore|accessdate=17 January 2018|work=[[Bloomberg News#Bloomberg View|Bloomberg View]]|date=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the US as the leading exporter at $575 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Banigan|first1=Melissa|title=East Africa Doesn’t Want Your Hand-Me-Downs|url=https://www.racked.com/2018/1/25/16923226/east-africa-used-clothing-ban|accessdate=26 January 2018|work=Racked|publisher=[[Vox Media#Racked|Vox Media]]|date=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Committee for Safety of Foreign Exchange Students''' (CSFES) is a [[non-profit organization]] which Danielle Grijalva started in the [[United States of America]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csfes.org/CSFES_Recognition.html Committee for Safety of Foreign Exchange Students] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826071004/http://csfes.org/CSFES_Recognition.html |date=2013-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This committee was created to protect foreign children who could be abused both physically and mentally if not put into a safe home.

== Origins ==
Grijalva had worked as an area representative for CCI (Center for Cultural Interchange),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.10news.com/about/10news-leadership-award-winner-danielle-grijalva ABC10news, 2008 Jul 03, Leadership Award Winner Danielle Grijalva]&lt;/ref&gt; a foreign-exchange program for student that is based in [[Illinois]]. As an area representative she had the task of ensuring the safe placement of [[Student exchange program|exchange students]] travelling to the United States. As she gained experience as a representative, Ms. Grijalva learned that not all exchange students were placed with safe host-families.

In 2004, Danielle Grijalva resigned from CCI in protest when she found that another coordinator in the same agency had knowingly placed two boys from non-English speaking backgrounds in the home of a [[pederast]] who immediately began to groom them with gay pornography (which constitutes a crime in California), to provide them alcohol (which is against the law), and to deprive them of bathroom privacy. This was the eighth time that this man had been allowed to host boys.

Grijalva was appalled when she found that her agency was totally disinterested in what had happened to the boys, but threatened her with a lawsuit if she continued her concerns. The agency then concocted the allegations that the boys were expelled from high school for downloading pornography from their host father's computer.  The school principal contacted the Police Department and local [[Child Protective Services]]. Police, not the agency, removed the boys from the home. Their report claimed that when the officer went to the door, the man who answered stood there with his pants around his legs.

When she expressed concerns about future students being placed in this man's home, the manager allegedly said, "Now, Danielle, we cannot discriminate against homosexuality.  Back off!"

The president of the agency interfered with law enforcement stating that the boys concocted the allegations; because, they were accustomed to having a swimming pool in their back yard and wanted to be placed in a house that had one. The manager refused to change the placement and, hearing their allegations, notified police that the boys had attempted to steal from their host when they were caught looking for their passports and return tickets to go home. They, in common with most others in this situation, were instructed to sign a statement that the breakdown of the placement was due entirely to their own bad behavior, and they were told that they would be denied future access to the US if they refused to sign. This is sheer bullying; because, agencies do not have the power to prevent return visits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscis.gov/iframe/ilink/docView/22CFR/HTML/22CFR/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-3590/0-0-0-4552.html § Sec. 62. 25 Secondary school students]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the boys did not know that they were being blackmailed and they signed. This of course prevents them from suing their abusers and the agencies.

When in Grijalva wrote to inform the German agencies responsible for sending the boys to the US, she received an aggressive response. When she persisted and wrote again, she received a one-sentence reply: "When we told you we didn't wish to hear from you, we meant it."{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

== Activities ==
Grijalva received so many complaints from parents and students that she set up a website which has attracted more and more horror stories. She established the International Committee for Safety of Foreign Exchange Students (CSFES), enlisting the support of others who were aware of the problems. CSFES became a registered charity in 2007, by which time its filing cabinets were full of complaints from parents along with newspaper reports of exchange students raped, molested, and exposed to every type of extortion. CSFES has no power other than its ability to support parents and students, to publicise the actions of unscrupulous agencies using media, to lobby politicians and to lodge complaints with government and exchange agency officials who invariably blame students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csfes.org/CSFES_Recognition.html Committee for Safety of Foreign Exchange Students] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826071004/http://csfes.org/CSFES_Recognition.html |date=2013-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CSFES maintains that every exchange student deserves a safe exchange experience. To ensure this, Ms. Grijalva tries to educate various government agencies, the exchange organizations themselves and potential host-families.&lt;ref&gt;

Unfortunately, not all exchange students end up in safe host-families. CSFES then steps in and acts as an advocate for exchange students in the US. Due to the efforts of CSFES, many exchange students who have felt alone in difficult circumstances have been able to achieve their goal of a good experience.

Since the beginning, Ms. Grijalva has gained the attention of the US media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2009570258_apusexchangestudentwatchdog.html The Seattle Times, 2009 Jul 30, Calif. mom exposes abuses of exchange students]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2009/US/07/15/us.exchange.students/index.html CNN.com/US, 2009 Jul 16, Exchange students live American nightmare]&lt;/ref&gt;

Not everyone has been happy about this attention. Exchange organizations have filed lawsuits against CSFES because of its work.
Media in non-US countries have contacted CSFES to get their take on the way the exchange industry works in the US. CSFES have become the go-to fount of information that has been needed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bt.no/jobb/Sexpress_-tyveri-og-utnytting-2741873.html Bergens Tidende, 2012 Jul 30, Sexpress, tyvery og utnytting]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3114">A '''cultural footprint''' is the impact that a group or individual has on the cultural environment.

== Definition ==
“Cultural footprint”&lt;ref&gt;The term was first used in work launched by the association Diversum (“Mesurer et améliorer son empreinte culturelle : nouvelle thématique du développement durable” [“Measuring and Improving One’s Cultural Footprint: The New Topic in Sustainable Development”], Jérôme Gouadain’s contribution to the [https://www.observatoireplurilinguisme.eu/fr/les-actions/assises-berlin-juin-2009-fr-fr-6-1/88888966--sp-161/2207-programme-et-contributions 2nd European Conference on Plurilingualism], Berlin, 19 June 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; was defined in June 2013, at the initiative of a group of experts from [[UNESCO]], the [[OECD]], the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|International Organisation of the Francophonie]], French ministries, various companies and civil society.

They explained it as “all of the externalities, both positive and negative, generated in the cultural environment by agents’ actions”. It is considered to be positive when it enriches [[cultural diversity]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diversum.net/fichiers/File/The%20purple%20economy,%20an%20objective,%20an%20opportunity.pdf Conclusions of the first inter-institutional working group on the purple economy]&lt;/ref&gt; or fosters cultural intensity.&lt;ref name=diversum20170630&gt;[http://diversum.net/fr/association/a.php?t=document-de-reference&amp;id=74presse “The Cultural Footprint of the Cosmetic Sector”] (accessed 24 September 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

A second reference document published in 2017 specified that “all actors have the possibility of activating (i.e. exploring and utilizing) available cultural resources. At the same time, it is their responsibility to make a positive contribution” to that sub-stratum, to that creative atmosphere. This means that groups and individuals must “set requirements for themselves, engage based on their own singularities, and be culturally involved and invested”.

== Applications ==
“The Cultural Footprint of the Cosmetic Sector”&lt;ref name=diversum20170630/&gt; is a document to which Gilles Andrier, Loïc Armand, Francesco Bandarin, Jérôme Bédier, Françoise Benhamou, Fouad Benseddik, Gilles Boëtsch, [[Dominique Bourg]], Jérôme Gouadain, Maria Gravari-Barbas, Marc-Antoine Jamet, [[François Jullien]], [[Pascal Lamy]], [[Jacques Lévy]], [[Gilles Lipovetsky]], Françoise Montenay, Jean Musitelli, Patrick O’Quin, Philippe d’Ornano, [[Dominique Perrault]], Marie-Hélène Plainfossé and Nicole Rouvet contributed. It suggests several aspects of the cultural environment where economics might be able to make a contribution: architecture, art, colours, enjoyment, ethics, heritage, imagination, learning, social skills, singularity, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12770">[[File:Dramatism Pentad.png|thumbnail|A diagram of the dramatistic pentad  depicting Attitude as a derivative of Agent.]]
The '''dramatistic pentad''' forms the core structure of [[dramatism]], a method for examining motivations that the renowned [[literary critic]] [[Kenneth Burke]] developed.  Dramatism recommends the use of a [[metalinguistic]] approach to stories about human action that investigates the roles and uses of five [[rhetoric]]al elements common to all narratives, each of which is related to a question. These five rhetorical elements form the "dramatistic pentad." Burke argues that an evaluation of the relative emphasis that is given to each of the five elements by a human drama enables a determination of the motive for the behaviour of its [[Character (arts)|character]]s. A character's stress on one element over the others suggests their [[world view]].

Burke introduced the pentad in his 1945 book "A Grammar of Motives". Burke based his pentad on the scholastic hexameter which defines "questions to be answered in the treatment of a topic: Who, what, where, by what means, why, how, when".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "A Grammar of Motives". University of California Press, 1969, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; Burke created the pentad by combining several of the categories in the scholastic hexameter. The result was a pentad that has the five categories of: act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose. Burke states, "The 'who' is obviously covered by agent. Scene covers the 'where' and the 'when'. The 'why' is purpose. 'How' and 'by what means' fall under agency. All that is left to take care of is act in our terms and 'what' in the scholastic formula".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "A Grammar of Motives". University of California Press, 1969, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pentad also closely follows the journalistic '[[Five Ws]]': who, what, when, where, why. 'Who' maps to agent. 'What' maps to action. 'When' and 'Where' map to scene. 'Why' maps to purpose. There is no direct mapping from the Five Ws to the pentads category of agency but Geoff Hart states "Some authorities add a sixth question, “how”, to this list, but “how to” information generally fits under what, where, or when, depending on the nature of the information." &lt;ref&gt;"The Five Ws of Online Help". by Geoff Hart, TECHWR-L. Retrieved April 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetorical elements of the dramatistic pentad==
The dramatistic pentad comprises the five rhetorical elements: Act, Scene, Agent, Agency, and Purpose. The “world views” listed below reflect the prominent schools of thought during Burke’s time, “without dismissing any of them," to read them "at once sympathetically and critically in relation to each other," and "in a wider context than any of them recognizes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fergusson|first1=Francis|title=Kenneth Burke's A Grammar of Motives|date=1957|publisher=Doubleday Anchor Books|location=NY|pages=193–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Act===
Act, which is associated with dramatic action verbs and answers the question "what?", is related to the world view of [[Philosophical realism|realism]]; What happened? What is the action? What is going on? What action; what thoughts? Burke defines the act as that which “names what took place, in thought or deed.” Since an act is likely composed of many separate actions, Burke states that “any verb, no matter how specific or general, that has connotations of consciousness or purpose falls under this category.”&lt;ref name="A Grammar of Motives"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scene===
Scene, which is associated with the [[Setting (fiction)|setting]] of an act and answers the questions "when?" and "where?", is related to the world view of [[materialism]] and minimal or non-existent [[free will]]. Burke defines the scene as “the background of an act, the situation in which it occurred.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agent===
Agent, which answers the question "by whom?", reflects the world view of [[philosophical idealism]]. Burke defines the agent as “what person or kind of person performed the act.” &lt;ref name="A Grammar of Motives"/&gt;

===Agency===
Agency (means), which is associated with the person or the organization that committed the deed and answers the question "how?", implies a [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] point of view. Burke defines agency as “what instrument or instruments he used.”&lt;ref name="A Grammar of Motives"/&gt;

===Purpose===
Purpose, which is associated with meaning and answers the question "why?", indicates that the agent seeks unity through identification with an ultimate meaning of life. Reflects the world view of mysticism. Purpose is inextricably linked to the analysis of “Motive” which, derived from the title of A Grammar of Motives, is the main subject of its analysis. Since Purpose is both the subject of analysis and an element of the dramatistic pentad, it is not a common element to be included in a ratio.

==Ratios within the dramatistic pentad==
In A Grammar of Motives, Burke provides a system of analysis for the Scene-Act ratio and the Scene-Agent ratio, though his analysis of ratios in the analysis of rhetoric is not limited to these. He states that, “The principles of dramatic consistency would lead one to expect such cases of overlap among the terms; but while being aware of them we should firmly fix in our minds such cases as afford a clear differentiation. Our terms leaning themselves towards merger and division, we are here trying to divide two of them while recognizing their possibilities of merger.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus any two dramatistic elements can be analyzed in relation to each other, creating a ratio, and can produce individual, yet separate meanings which are equally valid. However, the rhetor’s selection of elements to compose a ratio should be scrutinized, as it can deflect attention away from or direct attention towards aspects of the rhetor’s desire.

This is what Burke calls the “Ubiquity of the Ratios,” claiming that the composition of ratios “are at the very centre of motivational assumptions,” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1307}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, “The maxim ‘terrain determines tactics’ is a strict localization of the scene-act ratio, with ‘terrain’ as the casuistic equivalent for ‘scene’ in a military calculus of motives, and ‘tactics’ as the corresponding ‘act.’"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|page=1308}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The analysis of a situation as a multi-faceted occurrence is central to Burke’s concept of ratios. 
Likewise, the substitution of a dramatistic element with another can change an interpretation of the motive, allowing the analyst to modify the ratio in order to highlight the importance of a specific factor. For example, “the resistance of the Russian armies to the Nazi invasion could be explained ‘scenically’ in terms of the Soviet political and economic structure; or one could use the act-agent ratio, attributing the power and tenacity to ‘Russian’ traits of character. However, in deriving the act from the scene, one would have to credit socialism as a major scenic factor, whereas a derivation of the act from agents would allow for a much more felicitous explanation from the standpoint of capitalist apologists.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rhetor-agent also has a significant amount of power in crafting the perception of these ratios to their effect, “If an agent acts in keeping with his nature as an agent (act-agent ratio), he may change the nature of the scene accordingly (scene-act ratio) and thereby establish a state of unity between himself and his world (scene-agent ratio)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scene-Act ratio===
The scene, or the setting, will contain the act, or the what/actions. The way in which the agent interacts with the scene draws out specific analyses usually related to the atmosphere of the setting. While Burke states that, “It is a principle of drama that the nature of acts and agents should be consistent with the nature of the scene,” some “comic and grotesque works may deliberately set these elements at odds with one another, audiences make allowances for such liberty, which reaffirms the same principle of consistency in its very violation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1302}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reflects the division of most plays into very literal “acts,” as the agents who construct the scene are very literally “acters” whose work is played against the backdrop of the scene.The actions that a person performs are interpreted through the setting or happenings.&lt;ref name="Burke1978"&gt;Burke,Kenneth."Questions and Answers about the Pentad". National Council of Teachers of English, 1978, p. 332-333.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scene-Agent ratio===
A relationship between the agent (person) and the scene (place or setting). A scene can pose restrictions on the agent; in a narrative, the person and place should have some connection.&lt;ref name="Burke1978" /&gt;

===Act-Agent ratio===
While requiring the scene to contain them, the agent does not contain the act. Burke states that, “the agent is an author of his acts,” which can “make him or remake him in accordance with their nature.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1309}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the main principles that separates act and agent, producing a linked cycle which constructs the presentation of the agent’s identity.

==A sixth element==
In A Grammar of Motives, Burke mentions that attitude is “a state of mind,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Situation|date=2001|page=1302}}&lt;/ref&gt; remaining exterior from the pentad, as it is often “a preparation for an act, which would make it kind of symbolic act, or incipient act. But in its character as a state of mind that may or may not lead to an act, it is clearly classified under the head of agent.”. Burke also refers to attitude as a variation of agency.&lt;ref name=Anderson2010 /&gt; Prior to 1969 the term attitude is placed under agency, act or agent and is not considered a sixth element.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "A Grammar of Motives". University of California Press, 1969, p. 476&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1969, Burke places attitude as a new sixth element, yet he does not refer to the pentad as a hexad.&lt;ref name="Anderson2010"&gt;Anderson, F. D., &amp; Althouse, M. T. (2010). “Five Fingers or Six? Pentad or Hexad”. KB Journal, 6(2). Retrieved October 27, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Attitude is defined as "the preparation for an act, which would make it a kind of symbolic act, or incipient act." The attitude, like the agency, would answer the “how?”.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. (1965). “Permanence and Change”. 1954. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill.&lt;/ref&gt; There is still some uncertainty over whether attitude is an additional element, and thus makes the dramatistic pentad a hexad, or if it is still a sub-element of the original pentad.&lt;ref name="Anderson2010" /&gt; While Burke has never directly stated that the pentad is a hexad, he has admitted that the addition of attitude to the pentad is similar to gaining “another soul” or an “extra existence.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew|title=Disciplining The Master: Finding the Via Media for Kenneth Burke|journal=American Communication Journal|date=2001|volume=4|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have read this as Burke’s desire not to “dispose of” ambiguity, but rather to “study and clarify the resources of ambiguity.”&lt;ref name=Anderson2010 /&gt; As a result, many diagrams of the pentad depict attitude as a derivative of agent.

'''Elegant decay''' is the cultural agreement that some places, and structures, become gradually more elegant, notable, or beautiful as they decay, or fall into [[ruin]], due to their historical, architectural, or cultural significance. Although such reverence is subjective, it is true that certain cities, regions or even countries are more susceptible to the general concept due to past opulence, or their lengthy or enduring history or culture.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

[[File:Rome Palatine Hill.jpg|thumb|360px|The path to the summit of [[Palatine Hill]], [[Rome]], Italy]]

Contrary to the general interpretation that places or structures are more noteworthy in their newness, or older structures hold more value and interest after being historically restored to their original state, the concept of elegant decay is that in the slow degradation of the structures an inherent elegance, or beauty, emerges due to past historic importance. In recent times, this concept has been exploited by those seeking to stimulate tourism.

==History==
[[File:Venice Windows.jpg|thumb|360px|A wall in [[Venice]], Italy, slowly crumbles into a canal.]]

With its rich history, and centuries of past prestige and prominence, [[Western Europe]] has many places where elegant decay is notable and celebrated. One of the most salient is Italy, due to its lengthy historic prominence in prehistoric, ancient, medieval, and modern times. The most celebrated of Italian cities in elegant decay is arguably [[Venice]], largely due to the whole city slowly crumbling and sinking into its lagoon.{{CN|date=October 2017}}

Although Western Europe holds many instances of elegant decay today, the New World also has places of crumbled reverence as well. Most notable in the United States may be the city and region around [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], with its historic fusion of cultures and important contributions to American expansion. In the concept of elegant decay, there sometimes appears to be an element of impending doom to such places and structures, as Venice slowly sinks, and New Orleans is under constant threat from hurricanes.

Elegant decay is different in concept and plan than [[ruin value]], in which structures are planned to look beautiful as ruins from the early planning stages. The concept of elegant decay is related to the concept of [[patina]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2264">An '''epitoge''' is a garment worn over the left shoulder that sometimes forms part of [[academic dress|academic]] or [[court dress]].

The epitoge is descended from the [[chaperon (headgear)|chaperon]], a mediaeval hat that descended from a cloak with a [[Hood (headgear)|hood]] with the head tucked into the opening of the [[cowl]], so that the long tail or [[liripipe]] and the abbreviated [[cape]] hung at opposite sides of the head (wearer's right and wearer's left respectively). Over time, the cape portion was reduced to a small pleated flap and the cowl was curled up into a [[roundel]], and it then became the practice to wear the garment over the left shoulder rather than on the head, with the narrow liripipe in front and the wider cape behind.

The garment is commonly used in French universities, where bands of ermine trimming are used to indicate the degree (one band for a bachelor, two for a master, and three for a doctor). In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the garment is more commonly used to indicate diplomas rather than degrees; the Irish variant of the epitoge omits the roundel and has a plain cape rather than pleated. Versions of epitoges are also used by some orders of chivalry and on barristers' gowns in some legal systems.

{{Anthropology of art|Related articles}}

'''Ethnocinema''', from [[Jean Rouch]]’s ''cine-ethnography'' and ''ethno-fictions'',&lt;ref&gt;Rouch, Jean. 2003. ''Cine-Ethnography''. Translated and edited by Steven Feld. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt; is an emerging practice of [[Cross-cultural communication|intercultural]] filmmaking being defined and extended by [[Melbourne, Australia]]-based writer and arts educator, [[Anne Harris (educator)|Anne Harris]], and others. Originally derived from the discipline of [[anthropology]], ethnocinema is one form of ethnographic filmmaking that prioritises mutuality, collaboration and social change.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Anne. "Race and Refugeity: Ethnocinema as Radical Pedagogy" in ''Qualitative Inquiry'' (ERA=B) Nov 1, 2010:16, pp. 768-777. http://qix.sagepub.com/content/16/9/768.short&lt;/ref&gt; The practice's ethos claims that the role of anthropologists, and other cultural, media and educational researchers, must adapt to changing communities, transnational identities and new notions of representation for the 21st century.

Ethno-cinematographers have also been associated with American historian [[James Clifford (historian)|James Clifford]] who has asserted that “all ethnographic representations are partial truths”.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, James and George E. Marcus, (eds). 1986. ''Writing culture: the poetics and politics of ethnography''. Berkeley, CA: Univ of California Press., pg 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative ethnographic film and video projects are created with the intention of going beyond "preserving", "empowering" or "giving voice" to [[Marginalization|marginalised]] cultures, [[Ethnic group|ethnicities]], communities or individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Anne. "‘You Could Do With A Little More Gucci’: Ethnographic Documentary Talks Back" in ''Creative Approaches to Research'', Vol 2:1, July 2009. Melbourne: RMIT Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; According to theorists, such voices already have [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] and share community or agendas with ethnocinematic filmmakers. Ethnocinematic films primarily document "relationships"&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Anne and Nyuon, Nyadol: "Working It Both Ways: Intercultural Collaboration and the Performativity of Identity" ''The Australasian Review of African Studies'', Vol 31:1, June 2010. Pp 62-81. {{cite web |url=http://www.afsaap.org.au/ARAS/ARAS.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216144841/http://www.afsaap.org.au/ARAS/ARAS.htm |archivedate=2011-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; between filmmakers from different cultures, or subcultures, who now share common space of a [[Politics|political]], [[Philosophy|philosophical]], [[Geography|geographical]] or [[Virtual world|virtual]] nature.
 
Ethno-cinematographers include [[Jean Rouch]], [[Trinh T. Minh-ha]],&lt;ref&gt;Minh-Ha, Trinh T, (ed) ''The Digital Film Event'', Routledge, New York, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harald Prins]],&lt;ref&gt;Prins. 2004. "Visual Anthropology". in ''A Companion to the Anthropology of American Indians'', edited by T. Bilosi. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing. Pp 506-525.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David MacDougall|David]] and [[Judith MacDougall]],&lt;ref&gt;MacDougall, David, ''Transcultural Cinema'', Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Faye Ginsburg]], [[Timothy Asch]] and, indigenous filmmakers such as Australian [[Essie Coffey]] who collaborating interculturally to create ethnocinematic works.

== History ==

Tobing Rony identifies three modalities in early ethnographic representation&lt;ref&gt;Tobing Rony, Fatimah. 1996. ''The Third Eye: Race, Cinema and Ethnographic Spectacle''. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, pg 195.&lt;/ref&gt; including “ethnographic inscription” (Regnault), “taxidermic mode” (Flaherty’s ''Nanook''), and “self-reflexive” (Rouch’s films of the 1950s){{Clarify|date=July 2012}}. Of these, Rouch’s films are closest to being the forerunners of contemporary ethnocinema. Many film theorists and ethnohistorians have helped to define an evolving ethnographic film in the late 20th century, among them American [[Bill Nichols]].&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, Bill. 1994. ''Blurred Boundaries: questions of meaning in contemporary culture''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnocinema is typical{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} of a shift toward destabilizing traditional notions of representation, both in the West/North and in cultures and communities which had historically been the subjects of such films, and in which indigenous and diasporic peoples are taking control of their own representations, or working (as in ethnocinema) in intercultural collaboration. In addition to Rouch, this includes the work of such ethnographers and intercultural filmmakers as [[Trinh T. Minh-ha]],&lt;ref&gt;Minh-Ha, Trinh T, (ed) ''The Digital Film Event'', Routledge, New York, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harald Prins]],&lt;ref&gt;Prins. 2004. "Visual Anthropology". in ''A Companion to the Anthropology of American Indians'', edited by T. Bilosi. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing. Pp 506-525.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David MacDougall|David]] and [[Judith MacDougall]],&lt;ref&gt;MacDougall, David, ''Transcultural Cinema'', Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Faye Ginsburg]], [[Timothy Asch]] and others.  More recently, indigenous filmmakers such as [[Essie Coffey]] (Australia) are collaborating interculturally to create ethnocinematic works. Working against the [[observational cinema]] tradition, these filmmakers are all acknowledging and deconstructing Minh-ha’s observation that “Everywhere we go, we become someone’s private zoo”,&lt;ref&gt;Minh-ha, T. (1996) "Woman, Native, Other: Writing Postcoloniality and Feminism". in ''Feminist literary theory: a reader''. (ed.) Eagleton, Mary. Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, pg 394.&lt;/ref&gt; and theorists like Harris continue to draw on her work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = Anne | year = | title = Someone's Private Zoo: Ethnocinema and the Other | url = | journal = Qualitative Research Journal | volume = 11 | issue = 1| page = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of early attempts to define ethnocinema include the 1972 "ethnocinematic experiment" of Sol Worth and John Adair documented in "American Indians and the ethnocinematic complex: From native participation to production control",&lt;ref&gt;Prins, Harald E.L. 1989. "American Indians and the Ethnocinematic Complex: From Native Participation to Production Control". in ''Eyes Across the Water'', edited by R. M. Boonzajer Flaes. Amsterdam: Het Spinhuis. Pp 80-90.&lt;/ref&gt; in which seven co-participants of [[Navajo people|Navajo]] heritage were given video cameras and asked to make films which were ‘Indian’; these films, however, were framed by essentialising notions of Other and did not seek to go beyond the researcher/researched [[dichotomy]]. Tobing Rony (1996) and Sam Pack (2000) consider developments in Indigenous media in relation to the anthropological notion of “native authenticity”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pack | first1 = Sam | year = 2000 | title = Indigenous media then and now: Situating the Navajo film project | doi = 10.1080/10509200009361497 | journal = Quarterly Review of Film and Video | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 273–286 [274] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and why such essentialising notions are increasingly irrelevant in the 21st century’s ethnocinematic context. Yet the ability to truly collaborate in ethnographic research remains a contentious notion in anthropological and other circles, as ethnographic documentary scholar [[Jay Ruby]] asserts; what he calls ''Ethnographic Cinema'' must, he claims “be the work of academically educated and academically employed socio-cultural anthropologists”.&lt;ref&gt;Ruby, J. ''Ethnographic Cinema (EC) - A Manifesto / A Provocation''  (n.d.)   {{cite web |url=http://astro.ocis.temple.edu/~ruby/manifesto.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708195720/http://astro.ocis.temple.edu/~ruby/manifesto.html |archivedate=2008-07-08 |df= }}. (Retrieved on: 17 May 2009), para. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; By Ruby’s reckoning, what is emerging as ethnocinema has almost nothing to do with ethnographic films. By this definition, even Jean Rouch doesn’t qualify.

Conversely, Rouch encouraged the potential of ethnographic film as a “celebration of a relationship” between filmmaker and imaged, in which the “rapport and participation”&lt;ref&gt;Rouch 2003, pg 12.&lt;/ref&gt; between both parties enhances any end-product that is collectively achieved. Loizos’s{{Clarify|date=July 2012}} claim (like Ruby’s) that contemporary filmmakers blur the lines between "authentic" ethnography and general [[documentary]] seems increasingly out of place. Traditional ethnographic filmmaking as a tool of anthropological researchers seeking to bring the stories of “distant peoples to audiences in North America and Europe”&lt;ref&gt;Heider, Karl G. 2006. ''Ethnographic Film''. Austin: University of Texas Press, pg 15.&lt;/ref&gt; is increasingly outmoded in a culture of [[YouTube]] and [[social networking]] sites screaming for video content.{{Why|date=July 2012}}

=== Toward a contemporary ethnocinema: some contradictions ===
The confusion continues. By 2006, there are still scant references to ethnocinema and they frequently conflict. One online [[blog]] characterises a Burmese festival as “a surrealist anti-documentary, with no voice-over, odd visual juxtapositions, and none of the quasi-academic tone that afflicts so much ''official ethno cinema''”.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Erik. 2006. "Burmese Daze". Originally published in ''The Strange Attractor Journal'', No. 4. http://www.techgnosis.com/chunkshow-single.php?chunk=chunkfrom-2007-04-01-1746-0.txt. (Retrieved on: 19 September 2009), para. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  An abstract for an academic paper on the ritual branding of [[Andean cattle]] in [[Peru]] refers to the paper as an “ethnocinematographical study in which we reinterpret, with and in the film” the acts which they have recorded filmically, using the video cameras as “observation instruments”,&lt;ref&gt;Reyna, Carlos. 2005. ''Cinema e Antropologia: Novos diálogos metodológicos na interpretação de um ritual andino''. Biblioteca online de ciências da comunicação. http://www.bocc.ubi.pt/pag/reyna-carlos-cinema-antropologia.pdf. (Retrieved on: 10 September 2009), pg 1.&lt;/ref&gt; none of which characterizes contemporary ethnocinematic work.

Several recent European [[film festival]]s list among their offerings the category of ethnocinema, without giving examples or defining the term. Still other contemporary film festivals appear to use the terms ''ethnographic'' and ''ethnocinematic'' interchangeably, which only adds to the confusion. In 2001, ''Notes From the Underground'', [[Goran Gocić]]’s insider look at the filmmaker [[Emir Kusturica]], appeared in which he discusses what he alternatively calls ''ethno-cinema'' and then just "''ethno''". A ''[[Modern Language Association Review]]'' article opined, "The appeal of Kusturica's films … is that of "ethno" cinema, a cinema rooted in local traditions but expressed in "Western" form. This liberal political engagement with exotic subject matter is nonetheless, argues Gocić, an empowerment of the marginal."&lt;ref&gt;Haymes, Peter. 2004. "Review of ''Notes from the Underground: The Cinema of Emir Kusturica''". ''The Modern Language Review'', January. http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_7026/is_1_99/ai_n28245389/. (Retrieved on: 9 September 2009), pg 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

and from a far less favourable online book review:
he invests considerably more time to embracing instead his own recurring but vague references to 'ethno-cinema' as a base context from which Kusturica is operating (and by which Gocic seems to mean to have it both ways: indulging in [[exoticism]] and critiquing others' supposed essentializing). The only specific examples he offers to define this category are a handful of big budget Hollywood films involving Native Americans.''&lt;ref&gt;Karl, Brian Bernard. 2004. "Capturing Kusturica: On Gocić’s ''The Cinema of Kusturica''", ''Film Philosophy'', vol. 8, no. 12, 2004, para 24. http://www.film-philosophy.com/vol8-2004/n12karl. (Retrieved on: 20 September 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gocić himself says that, “inside film history itself, ethno cinema is the most exciting cinematic concept that the world has had to offer in the past two decades: aesthetically, it is difficult to argue against”.&lt;ref&gt;Gocić, Goran. 2001. ''The Cinema of Emir Kusturica: Notes from the Underground''. London: Wallflower Press, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, throughout the text his attempts to define ethnocinema contradict and obscure any practical working definition.  Gocić identifies "ethno" as having been around since the 1950s and as being typified by a sense of the “local”, including local motifs, but frequently made for a Western audience.&lt;ref&gt;Gocić, 2001, pg 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Surprisingly, only nine pages later he locates the birth of "ethno cinema" “in the late 1970s and early 1980s solely judging by the [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] winners, which were Italian at the end of the 1970s”.&lt;ref&gt;Gocić, 2001, pg 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gocić does attempt to characterise and define his version of ''ethno cinema'' with the following: “nostalgia,” (as a search for the “‘lost ‘authenticity’ of primitivism”), “intertextuality, openness and subjectivity (as postmodern characteristics), incredulity (or denial of ideology), and ‘double coding' or unexpected, surrealist, incongruous elements”.&lt;ref&gt;Gocić, 2001, pg 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnocinema, then, suggests that the voices/images of "women/natives/others"&lt;ref&gt;Minh-ha, Trinh T. 1996. "Woman, Native, Other: Writing Postcoloniality and Feminism". in ''Feminist Literary Theory: A Reader'', edited by M. Eagleton. Cambridge MA: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; have something in common, and have agency in contributing to ethnographic film, whether independently or collaboratively, interculturally or intra-culturally. Current attempts to offer a working definition of ethnocinema may share more with the more recent movement of intercultural cinema which emerged around 1990. [[Laura Marks]] identifies this emergence as connected to three main factors: “the rise of multiculturalism … availability of funding … and an intellectual climate characterised by the disintegration of master narratives and a growing conceptualisation of knowledge as partial and contested”.&lt;ref&gt;Marks, Laura U. 2000. ''The skin of the film: intercultural cinema, embodiment, and the senses''. Durham NC: Duke University Press, pg 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whatever its filmic and academic antecedents, ethnocinema is emerging, and – as Rouch has repeatedly shown us – "the other cannot be denied" as his/her image and means of production transforms.

In ethnocinema there is the belief that in the relationship which emerges through the shared project, both self and Other are understood and represented in newly constructed ways.  One way of disrupting traditional ethnographic documentary [[voyeurism]] is in making transparent the intercultural relationship normally shrouded behind the scenes. [[Gwendolyn A. Foster|Foster’s]] contention that controlling the means of production is "foregrounding subjectivity",&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Gwendolyn A. 1997. ''Women Filmmakers of the African and Asian Diaspora: Decolonizing the Gaze, Locating Subjectivity''. Carbondale and Edwardsville: Southern Illinois University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; is limited.  It presumes a one-way relationship between the content and construction of all ethnographic films (including ethnocinematic ones), and assumes that by creating the films the subject is empowered and the gaze is recast.  It ignores the complex relationship between reception and production, and classifies films created by marginalised filmmakers as more authentic, or even automatically transgressive in a dominant culture.   This cannot be assumed, either in content or reception.  We have moved well beyond [[orientalism]] and the temporary inability of the Other to represent her or himself, so that "they must therefore be represented by others",&lt;ref&gt;Said, E. 2000. ''Reflections on exile and other essays''. Boston: Harvard University Press, pg 206.&lt;/ref&gt; but similarly it cannot be assumed that self-representation is automatically "authentic" or an end in itself. In ethnocinema, relationship and process always take precedence over formal considerations.  Obviously, to achieve a wide viewing audience, formal concerns cannot be completely ignored, but these aesthetic concerns are addressed ''together'' in the co-creation of the films. In ethnocinema, there is no perception of a conflict between its ethnographic and [[popular culture]] characteristics. It remains ethnographic because it is grounded in cultural specificity, which is not essentialist and can be always-changing.  It does not seek to "document" a culture, as in ethnocinema culture is understood to be varied, diverse and always emerging.

=== Ethnocinema: new directions ===

In ''Picturing Culture: Explorations of Film and Anthropology'', Ruby calls for places where “critical standards are debated and canons develop”,&lt;ref&gt;Ruby, Jay. 2000.

Harris agrees, and says that standards are needed, but diverges from Ruby’s definition in two important ways: firstly as a call to ethnocinematic filmmakers (whether academic or non-academic) that films included in this category must prioritise a post-colonial collaborative relationship between makers and imaged; and secondly, that Ruby’s so-called “marketplace considerations”&lt;ref&gt;Ruby 2000, pg 4.&lt;/ref&gt; need not pollute the product which is made.

'''Event videography''' is a [[video production]], the art of capturing social and special events onto video by a [[videographer]]. The term is used to describe the [[videography]] of any event, aside from weddings and [[wedding videography]].

==History==
Event videography is an offshoot of wedding videography and encompasses the video documentation of social functions, such as [[First Communion]]s, anniversaries, dance recitals, bar mitzvahs, color guard contests, [[prom]]s, concerts, etc.

Event videography started shortly after the introduction of consumer-based video cameras, or [[camcorders]], in the late 1970s, as videographers, who had businesses documenting weddings, began to look for other [[Market (economics)|market]]s to offer their services.

==Event videography today==
The art of event videography is somewhat similar today as it was back when the camcorder was first introduced. The main differences lie in the improved video camera technology and equipment. Advances in [[High-definition video|high definition]] technology are being applied to event videography.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7875">In [[fiction]], a '''false protagonist''' is a [[literary technique]], often used to make  the plot more jarring or more memorable by fooling the audience's preconceptions, that constructs a character who the audience assumes is the [[protagonist]] but is later revealed not to be.

A false protagonist is presented at the start of the fictional work as the main character, but then is eradicated, often by killing them (usually for [[shock value]] or as a [[plot twist]]) or changed in terms of their role in the story (i.e. making them a lesser character, a character who leaves the story, or revealing them to actually be the [[antagonist]]).&lt;ref name="Tindale2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher W. Tindale|title=Fallacies and Argument Appraisal|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-84208-2|pages=28–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In film, a character can be made to seem like the main protagonist based on a number of techniques (beyond just simply focusing the plot on their role). [[Bankable star|Star power]] is a very effective method; audience members generally assume that the biggest "name" in a movie will have a significant part to play. An abundance of [[close-up]]s can also be used as a subliminal method. Generally, the star of a film will get longer-lasting and more frequent close-ups than any other character, but this is rarely immediately apparent to viewers during the film. Alternatively, the false protagonist can serve as a narrator to the movie, encouraging the audience to assume that the character survives to tell their tale later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The antihero in popular culture: Life history theory and the dark triad personality traits.|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0027914|journal = Review of General Psychology|pages = 192–199|volume = 16|issue = 2|doi = 10.1037/a0027914|first = Peter K.|last = Jonason|first2 = Gregory D.|last2 = Webster|first3 = David P.|last3 = Schmitt|first4 = Norman P.|last4 = Li|first5 = Laura|last5 = Crysel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the same techniques used in film can also apply to [[television series|television]], but the episodic nature adds an additional possibility. By ending one or more [[television episode|episodes]] with the false protagonist still in place, the show can reinforce the viewers' belief in the character's protagonist status. Also, because TV shows often have changes of cast between seasons, some series can have unintentional false protagonists: characters who begin the series as the main character but then are replaced early in the show's run by another character entirely. When the series is viewed as a whole, this can lead to the appearance of a false protagonist.

In [[video game]]s, a false protagonist may initially be a playable character, only to be killed or revealed to be the antagonist. One key way in which video games employ the method that differs from uses in non-[[interactive]] [[fiction]] is by granting the player direct [[Game controller|control]] over the false protagonist. Since most video games allow a player to control only the main characters (and their success or failure is based on playing skill, not pre-determined story), the sudden demise of the character that is being controlled serves to surprise the player.

==Examples==
===Literature===
[[File:Hannah VICTORS, Jan.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The ''Book of Samuel'' starts with Samuel as a young boy. He was the main focus in the first few chapters until he eventually becomes a [[supporting character|minor character]].]]
*The ''[[Books of Samuel|Book of Samuel]]'' begins with [[Samuel]]'s birth and [[Yahweh|God]]'s call to him as a boy. At this point, the readers are led to believe that Samuel is the central figure in the book. Though by the sixteenth chapter, the book starts to primarily focus on [[King David|David]].{{sfn|Gordon|1986|p=18}}
*[[George R. R. Martin]]'s novel ''[[A Game of Thrones]]'', the first entry in the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' epic fantasy series, features chapters told from the point of view of numerous characters, though the most prominent is [[Ned Stark]], who is generally assumed to be the novel's main protagonist until the final chapters where he is unexpectedly executed.&lt;ref name="EW 109 1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvrecaps.ew.com/recap/game-of-thrones-episode-9/ |title=''Game of Thrones'' recap: The Killing |first=James |last=Hibberd |page=1 |date=June 12, 2011|accessdate=August 17, 2014 |work=Entertainment Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time 2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2011/06/13/game-of-thrones-watch-its-all-in-the-execution-2/ |title=''Game of Thrones'' Watch: The Unkindest Cut |first=James  |last=Poniewozik |authorlink=James Poniewozik |date=June 13, 2011 |accessdate=August 13, 2014 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
*[[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' opens with [[Marion Crane]] as the main character.  However, she is killed partway through the film, making the murder far more unexpected and shocking. Hitchcock felt that the opening scenes with Marion as the false protagonist were so important to the film that when it was released in theaters, he compelled theater owners to enforce a "no late admission" policy.&lt;ref name="Leigh"&gt;Leigh, Janet. ''Psycho : Behind the Scenes of the Classic Thriller''. Harmony Press, 1995. {{ISBN|0-517-70112-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The film ''[[Arachnophobia (film)|Arachnophobia]]'' opens with [[Mark L. Taylor]]'s character, nature photographer Jerry Manley, as its focus. However, he is killed a mere ten minutes into the film by a seizure caused by a spider bite, after which the focus shifts to [[Jeff Daniels]]'s character, Dr. Ross Jennings.
*''[[Halloween: Resurrection]]'' opens with [[Jamie Lee Curtis]]'s character, [[Laurie Strode]], who was the main protagonist in the previous ''Halloween'' films, only to be murdered by the antagonist (Michael Myers) ten minutes into the film.

===Video Games===
*In ''[[Star Fox Adventures: Dinosaur Planet]]'', the games opens with the character [[Krystal (Star Fox)|Krystal]].  However, she is ambushed and sealed in a crystal just minutes into the game, at which point the game shifts to protagonist [[Fox McCloud]].
*The game ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' begins with the character [[Roxas (Kingdom Hearts)|Roxas]] as its focal character.  However, more than an hour into the game, he finds the pods containing [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]], [[Donald Duck]], and [[Goofy]] and vanishes immediately after (as he is actually a part of Sora), prompting the shift to focusing on Sora for the remainder of the game.
*In ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'', the game starts with series protagonist [[Solid Snake]]. But after the opening chapter, the game shifts to protagonist [[Raiden (Metal Gear)|Raiden]].  Players were unaware of this shift at the time, as developers kept it a secret by only showing Solid Snake in the trailers.
*In ''[[Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony]]'', the Prologue and Chapter 01 of the game is played from the view of Kaede Akamatsu, the Ultimate Pianist. However, after she is voted as the culprit and then executed at the End of Chapter 1's Class Trial, the rest of the Game is played from the view of Shuichi Saihara, the Ultimate Detective.
*In “[[Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War]]”, the first half of the game is played as the character Sigurd. However, halfway through the game, Sigurd is killed, and his son Seliph inherits the role of protagonist.

"'''Free Will Hunting'''" is the ninth episode of the [[Futurama (season 7)|seventh season]] of the animated sitcom ''[[Futurama]]''. It originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] on August 8, 2012.

The episode was written by David X. Cohen and directed by Raymie Muzquiz.

==Plot==
Enrolling in college on a whim, Bender gets a questionable student loan from the [[Robot Mafia]] and falls in with a bad crowd. He then promptly drops out of college, gets addicted to robot drug "Spark," does dubious acts for Hedonismbot, and ultimately attempts to rob Girl Scouts (only for them to turn the tables on him) to earn money. His downward spiral leads to his arrest and trial, but his lawyer argues that as a robot, Bender lacks [[free will]] and that it was his programming that led to the sequence of events. The judge rules Bender not guilty, much to Bender's dismay.

The Planet Express crew is hired to deliver a package to Chapek 9 (last seen in "[[Fear of a Bot Planet]]"), requiring a despondent Bender to come along due to the native robots' intense hatred of humans. After delivering the package, Bender decides to stay on the planet, going on a journey of self-discovery. He eventually finds a religious [[monastery]] control by robotic [[monk]] named Ab-bot who call their religion "Order of the Binary Singularity" to take him in. From them, he learns that every Mom Corp. robot has a free will slot, so that they could be upgraded if a corresponding free will unit were ever invented. Bender returns to Earth to find more answers (and walks in on Fry and Leela together in bed).

Bender, Fry, and Leela reach the secret laboratory where the module may be kept, but they find Mom waiting for them there. She reveals that a free will unit was designed by Prof. Farnsworth years earlier when he worked at Mom Corp. Farnsworth never completed it after learning of Mom's plan to use the unit to cause a robot uprising that would then be repelled by obedient robots. Bender returns to Planet Express and asks Farnsworth about the module. The Professor admits that he had finished making one complete free will unit, which he has hidden in a talking Bender toy. Bender attempts to use a gun on Farnsworth to force him to hand it over, but Bender discovers that the Professor had programmed a failsafe in all robots that prevents them from taking the unit or attacking Farnsworth. Farnsworth inserts the unit into Bender to give Bender a sample of what free will is like.  At first, when Bender attempts to shoot Farnsworth again, it appears the unit is not working.  Bender then remembers he forgot to turn off the gun's [[Safety (firearms)|safety]], and shoots the Professor.  Bender is taken to court and, now that he has free will, is found guilty of attempted murder. The crew of Planet Express celebrate (except for a severely injured Farnsworth) with Bender as he is taken away.

Over the end credits is a rap video featuring Bender and several floozy-bots from previous episodes (such as Hookerbot 5000 from "[[Hell is Other Robots]]" and the two Jewish-American princess robots from "[[The Bots and the Bees]]").

{{more footnotes|date=May 2010}}
'''Genre''' ({{ety|fr|genre|kind, sort}}) is any form or type of [[communication]] in any mode (written, spoken, digital, artistic, etc.) with socially-agreed upon conventions developed over time. Genre is most popularly known as a [[Category of being|category]] of [[literature]], [[music]], or other forms of art or entertainment, whether written or spoken, audio or visual, based on some set of stylistic criteria, yet genres can be aesthetic, rhetorical, communicative, or functional. Genres form by conventions that change over time as cultures invent new genres and discontinue the use of old ones. Often, works fit into multiple genres by way of borrowing and recombining these conventions. Stand-alone texts, works, or pieces of communication may have individual styles, but genres are amalgams of these texts based on agreed-upon or socially inferred conventions. Some genres may have rigid, strictly adhered-to guidelines, while others may show great flexibility.

Genre began as an absolute classification system for [[ancient Greek literature]].{{cn|date=March 2018}} [[Poetry]] ([[ode]]s,  [[Epic poetry|epics]], etc.), [[prose]], and [[performance]] each had a specific and calculated style that related to the theme of the story. Speech patterns for comedy would not be appropriate for tragedy, and even actors were restricted to their genre under the assumption that a type of person could tell one type of story best.

In later periods{{when?|date=March 2018}} genres proliferated and developed in response to changes in audiences and creators.  Genre became a dynamic tool to help the public make sense out of unpredictable art. Because art is often a response to a social state, in that people write/paint/sing/dance about what they know about, the use of genre as a tool must be able to adapt to changing meanings.

Genre suffers from the ills of any classification system. It has been suggested{{by whom?|date=March 2018}} that genres resonate with people because of the familiarity, the shorthand communication, as well as because of the tendency of genres to shift with public [[mores]] and to reflect the [[zeitgeist]]. While the genre of [[storytelling]] has been relegated{{by whom?|date=March 2018}} as lesser form of art because of the heavily borrowed nature of the [[Convention (norm)|conventions]], admiration has grown. Proponents{{who?|date=March 2018}} argue that the genius of an effective genre piece is in the variation, recombination, and evolution of the codes.

==Visual arts==
[[File:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 014.jpg|thumb|A genre painting (''Peasant Dance'', c. 1568, by [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Pieter Brueghel]] the Elder) ]]

The term ''genre'' is much used in the history and criticism of visual art, but in [[art history]] has meanings that overlap rather confusingly. [[Genre painting]] is a term for paintings where the main subject features human figures to whom no specific identity attaches{{spaced ndash}}in other words, figures are not portraits, characters from a story, or allegorical personifications. These are distinguished from [[staffage]]: incidental figures in what is primarily a [[landscape art|landscape]] or architectural painting. ''Genre painting'' may also be used as a wider term covering genre painting proper, and other specialized types of paintings such as [[still-life]], landscapes, [[marine painting]]s and animal paintings.

The concept of the "[[hierarchy of genres]]" was a powerful one in artistic theory, especially between the 17th and 19th centuries.  It was strongest in France, where it was associated with the [[Académie française]] which held a central role in [[academic art]]. The genres in hierarchical order are:

==Literature==
{{Literature}}
{{Main article|Literary genre|List of literary genres}}
A literary genre is a category of literary composition. Genres may be determined by [[literary technique]], [[setting tone|tone]], [[Content (media)|content]], or even (as in the case of fiction) length. Genre should not be confused with age category, by which literature may be classified as either adult, [[young adult fiction|young adult]], or [[children's literature|children's]].  They also must not be confused with format, such as [[graphic novel]] or picture book. The distinctions between genres and categories are flexible and loosely defined, often with subgroups.

The most general genres in literature are (in loose chronological order) [[epic poetry|epic]], [[tragedy]],&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin 1983, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[comedy]], [[novel]], and [[short story]]. They can all be in the genres [[prose]] or [[poetry]], which shows best how loosely genres are defined. Additionally, a genre such as [[satire]] might appear in any of the above, not only as a subgenre but as a mixture of genres. Finally, they are defined by the general [[cultural movement]] of the [[historical period]] in which they were composed.  In [[popular fiction]], which is especially divided by genres, [[genre fiction]] is the more usual term.

In [[literature]], genre has been known as an intangible [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]].  This taxonomy implies a concept of containment or that an idea will be stable forever.The earliest recorded systems of genre in [[Western world|Western history]] can be traced back to Plato and Aristotle. Gérard Genette, a French literary theorist and author of ''The Architext'', describes Plato as creating three Imitational genres: dramatic dialogue, pure narrative, and [[Epic (genre)|epic]] (a mixture of dialogue and narrative). [[Lyric poetry]], the fourth and final type of [[Greek literature]], was excluded by Plato as a non-mimetic mode. Aristotle later revised Plato's system by eliminating the pure narrative as a viable mode and distinguishing by two additional criteria: the object to be imitated, as objects could be either superior or inferior, and the medium of presentation such as words, gestures or verse.  Essentially, the three categories of mode, object, and medium can be visualized along an XYZ axis.

Excluding the criteria of medium, Aristotle's system distinguished four types of classical genres: [[tragedy]] (superior-dramatic dialogue), [[epic poetry|epic]] (superior-mixed narrative), [[comedy]] (inferior-dramatic dialogue), and [[parody]] (inferior-mixed narrative). Genette continues by explaining the later integration of lyric poetry into the classical system during the [[Romanticism|romantic period]], replacing the now removed pure narrative mode. Lyric poetry, once considered non-mimetic, was deemed to imitate feelings, becoming the third leg of a new tripartite system: lyrical, epical, and dramatic dialogue. This system, which came to "dominate all the literary theory of German romanticism (and therefore well beyond)…" (38), has seen numerous attempts at expansion or revision. However, more ambitious efforts to expand the tripartite system resulted in new taxonomic systems of increasing scope and complexity.

Genette reflects upon these various systems, comparing them to the original tripartite arrangement: "its structure is somewhat superior to…those that have come after, fundamentally flawed as they are by their inclusive and hierarchical taxonomy, which each time immediately brings the whole game to a standstill and produces an impasse" (74). Taxonomy allows for a structured classification system of genre, as opposed to a more contemporary rhetorical model of genre.

==Film==
{{main article|Film genre}}
The basic genres of film can be regarded as drama, in the [[feature film]] and most [[cartoon]]s, and [[documentary]].  Most dramatic feature films, especially from [[Hollywood]] fall fairly comfortably into one of a long list of film genres such as the [[Western film|Western]], [[war film]], [[horror film]], [[romantic comedy|romantic comedy film]], [[musical film|musical]], [[crime film]], and many others. Many of these genres have a number of subgenres, for example by setting or subject, or a distinctive national style, for example in the Indian [[Bollywood]] musical.

==Music==
{{main article|Music genre}}
A '''music genre''' is a conventional category that identifies pieces of [[music]] as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions.&lt;ref&gt;Samson, Jim. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/40599 "Genre"]. In Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Accessed March 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It is to be distinguished from ''[[musical form]]'' and ''musical style'', although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} There are numerous genres in Western [[classical music]] and [[popular music]], as well as [[musical theatre]] and the music of non-Western cultures. The term is now perhaps over-used to describe relatively small differences in musical style in modern [[rock music]], that also may reflect sociological differences in their audiences.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Timothy Laurie suggests that in the context of rock and pop music studies, the "appeal of genre criticism is that it makes narratives out of musical worlds that often seem to lack them".&lt;ref name="Laurie 2014"&gt;{{Cite news | title= Music Genre As Method | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | newspaper= Cultural Studies Review | year= 2014 | url= https://www.academia.edu/9087511}} 20 (2), pp. 283-292.&lt;/ref&gt;

Music can be divided into different genres in several ways. The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often arbitrary and controversial, and some genres may overlap. There are several academic approaches to genres. In his book ''Form in Tonal Music'', Douglass M. Green lists [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]], [[motet]], [[canzona]], [[ricercar]], and dance as examples of genres from the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] period. According to Green, "Beethoven's ''Op. 61'' and Mendelssohn's ''Op. 64'' are identical in genre&amp;nbsp;– both are violin concertos&amp;nbsp;– but different in form. However, Mozart's ''Rondo for Piano, K. 511'', and the ''Agnus Dei'' from his ''Mass, K. 317'' are quite different in genre but happen to be similar in form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Form in Tonal Music |last=Green |first=Douglass M. |year=1965 |publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, Inc |isbn=0-03-020286-8 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some, like [[Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|Peter van der Merwe]], treat the terms ''genre'' and ''style'' as the same, saying that ''genre'' should be defined as pieces of music that share a certain style or "basic musical language".&lt;ref name=Pete&gt;{{cite book |title=Origins of the Popular Style: The Antecedents of Twentieth-Century Popular Music |last=van der Merwe |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter van der Merwe (musicologist) |year=1989 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-316121-4 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, such as Allan F. Moore, state that ''genre'' and ''style'' are two separate terms, and that secondary characteristics such as subject matter can also differentiate between genres.&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;Moore, Allan F.
[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3526163 "Categorical Conventions in Music Discourse: Style and Genre"]. ''Music &amp; Letters'', Vol. 82, No. 3 (Aug. 2001), pp. 432–442.&lt;/ref&gt; A music genre or subgenre may be defined by the [[musical technique]]s, the styles, the context, and content and spirit of the themes. Geographical origin is sometimes used to identify a music genre, though a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of subgenres.

Several music scholars have criticised the priority accorded to genre-based communities and listening practices. For example, Laurie argues that "music genres do not belong to isolated, self-sufficient communities. People constantly move between environments where diverse forms of music are heard, advertised and accessorised with distinctive iconographies, narratives and celebrity identities that also touch on non-musical worlds."&lt;ref name="Laurie 2014"/&gt;

==Popular culture and other media==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
The concept of genre is often applied, sometimes rather loosely, to other media with an artistic element, such as [[video game genres]]. Genre, and numerous minutely divided subgenres, affect popular culture very significantly, not least as they are used to classify it for publicity purposes.  The vastly increased output of popular culture in the age of electronic media encourages dividing cultural products by genre to simplify the search for products by consumers, a trend the Internet has only intensified.

==Linguistics==
In [[philosophy of language]], genre figures prominently in the works of philosopher and literary scholar [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]. Bakhtin's basic observations were of "speech genres" (the idea of [[heteroglossia]]), modes of speaking or writing that people learn to mimic, weave together, and manipulate (such as "formal letter" and "grocery list", or "university lecture" and "personal anecdote"). In this sense, genres are socially specified: recognized and defined (often informally) by a particular culture or community. The work of [[Georg Lukács]] also touches on the nature of [[literary genre]]s, appearing separately but around the same time (1920s–1930s) as Bakhtin. [[Norman Fairclough]] has a similar concept of genre that emphasizes the social context of the text: Genres are "different ways of (inter)acting discoursally" (Fairclough, 2003: 26).

A text's genre may be determined by its:

# Linguistic function.
# Formal traits.
# Textual organization.
# Relation of communicative situation to formal and organizational traits of the text (Charaudeau and Maingueneau, 2002:278–280).

==Rhetoric==
In the field of [[rhetoric]], genre theorists usually understand genres as types of actions rather than types or forms of texts.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi, A. S., &amp; Mary Jo Reiff. (2010). [http://wac.colostate.edu/books/bawarshi_reiff/ Genre: An Introduction to History, Theory, Research, and Pedagogy.] chs. 5 and 6&lt;/ref&gt; On this perspective, texts are channels through which genres are enacted. Carolyn Miller's&lt;ref&gt;Miller, C. R. (1984). Genre as social action. Quarterly Journal of Speech, 70(2), 151–167.&lt;/ref&gt; work has been especially important for this perspective. Drawing on [[Lloyd Bitzer]]'s concept of rhetorical situation,&lt;ref&gt;Bitzer, L. F. (1968). The Rhetorical Situation. Philosophy and Rhetoric, 1(1), 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller reasons that recurring rhetorical problems tend to elicit recurring responses; drawing on [[Alfred Schütz]],&lt;ref&gt;Schutz, A., &amp; Luckmann, T. (1973). The Structures of the Life-World. Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; she reasons that these recurring responses become "typified" – that is, socially constructed as recognizable types. Miller argues that these "typified rhetorical actions" (p.&amp;nbsp;151) are properly understood as genres.

Building off of Miller, [[Charles Bazerman]] and Clay Spinuzzi have argued that genres understood as actions derive their meaning from other genres – that is, other actions. Bazerman therefore proposes that we analyze genres in terms of "genre systems",&lt;ref&gt;Bazerman, C. (1994). Systems of Genre and the Enactment of Social Intentions. In Genre and the New Rhetoric (pp. 79–101). London/Bristol: Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; while Spinuzzi prefers the closely related concept of "genre ecologies".&lt;ref&gt;Spinuzzi, C., &amp; Zachry, M. (2000). Genre Ecologies : An Open-System Approach to Understanding and Constructing Documentation. ACM Journal of Computer Documentation, 24(3), 169–181.&lt;/ref&gt;

This tradition has had implications for the teaching of writing in American colleges and universities. Combining rhetorical genre theory with [[activity theory]], David Russell has proposed that standard English composition courses are ill-suited to teach the genres that students will write in other contexts across the university and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, D. R. (1995). Activity theory and its implications for writing instruction. In J. Petraglia (Ed.), Reconceiving writing, rethinking writing instruction (pp. 51–78). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Wardle contends that standard composition courses do teach genres, but that these are inauthentic "mutt genres" that are often of little use outside of composition courses.&lt;ref&gt;Wardle, E. (2009). "Mutt Genres" and the Goal of FYC: Can we Help Students Write the Genres of the University? College Composition and Communication, 60(4), 765–789.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
This concept of genre originated from the classification systems created by [[Plato]]. Plato divided [[literature]] into the three classic genres accepted in [[Ancient Greece]]: [[poetry]], [[drama]], and [[prose]]. [[Poetry]] is further subdivided into [[epic poetry|epic]], [[lyric poetry|lyric]], and [[drama]]. The divisions are recognized as being set by [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]; however, they were not the only ones. Many genre theorists added to these accepted forms of [[poetry]].

===Classical and Romance genre theory===
The earliest recorded systems of genre in Western history can be traced back to [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle#Rhetoric and poetics|Aristotle]]. [[Gérard Genette]] explains his interpretation of the history of genre in "The Architext". He described Plato as the creator of three imitational, mimetic genres distinguished by mode of imitation rather than content. These three imitational genres include dramatic dialogue, the [[drama]]; pure narrative, the [[dithyramb]]; and a mixture of the two, the [[Epic (genre)|epic]]. Plato excluded [[lyric poetry]] as a non-mimetic, imitational mode. Genette further discussed how Aristotle revised Plato's system by first eliminating the pure narrative as a viable mode. He then uses two additional criteria to distinguish the system. The first of the criteria is the object to be imitated, whether superior or inferior. The second criterion is the medium of presentation: words, gestures, or verse. Essentially, the three categories of [[mode (literature)|mode]], [[Object (philosophy)|object]], and [[Medium (communication)|medium]] can be visualized along an XYZ axis. Excluding the criteria of medium, Aristotle's system distinguished four types of classical genres: [[tragedy]], [[Epic (genre)|epic]], [[comedy]], and [[parody]].

Genette explained the integration of lyric poetry into the classical system by replacing the removed pure narrative mode. [[Lyric poetry]], once considered non-mimetic, was deemed to imitate feelings, becoming the third "Architext", a term coined by Gennette, of a new long-enduring tripartite system: lyrical; epical, the mixed narrative; and dramatic, the dialogue. This new system that came to "dominate all the literary theory of [[German romanticism]]" (Genette 38) has seen numerous attempts at expansion and revision. Such attempts include [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel's]] triad of subjective form, the lyric; objective form, the dramatic; and subjective-objective form, the epic. However, more ambitious efforts to expand the tripartite system resulted in new taxonomic systems of increasing complexity. Gennette reflected upon these various systems, comparing them to the original tripartite arrangement: "its structure is somewhat superior to most of those that have come after, fundamentally flawed as they are by their inclusive and hierarchical taxonomy, which each time immediately brings the whole game to a standstill and produces an impasse".

==Culture==
Genre is embedded in [[culture]] but may clash with it at times. There are occasions in which a cultural group may not be inclined to keep within the set structures of a genre. Anthony Pare's studied Inuit social workers in "Genre and Identity: Individuals, Institutions and Ideology". In this study, Pare described the conflict between the genre of Inuit social workers' record keeping forms and the cultural values that prohibited them from fully being able to fulfill the expectations of this genre. Amy Devitt further expands on the concept of culture in her 2004 essay, "A Theory of Genre" by adding "culture defines what situations and genres are likely or possible" (Devitt 24).

Genre not only coexists with culture but also defines its very components. Genres abound in daily life and people often work within them unconsciously; people often take for granted their prominence and ever present residence in society. Devitt touches on Miller's idea of situation, but expands on it and adds that the relationship with genre and situation is reciprocal. Individuals may find themselves shaping the rhetorical situations, which in turn affect the rhetorical responses that arise out of the situation. Because the social workers worked closely with different families, they did not want to disclose many of the details that are standard in the genre of record keeping related to this field. Giving out such information would violate close cultural ties with the members of their community.

==Audiences==
Although genres are not always precisely definable, genre considerations are one of the most important factors in determining what a person will see or read. The classification properties of genre can attract or repel potential users depending on the individual's understanding of a genre.

Genre creates an expectation in that expectation is met or not. Many genres have built-in audiences and corresponding publications that support them, such as [[magazine]]s and websites. Inversely, audiences may call out for change in an antecedent genre and create an entirely new genre.

The term may be used in categorizing [[web page]]s, like "news page" and "fan page", with both very different layout, audience, and intention (Rosso, 2008). Some search engines like [[Vivísimo]] try to group found web pages into automated categories in an attempt to show various genres the search hits might fit.

==Subgenre==
A subgenre is a [[Hierarchy|subordinate]] within a genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/subgenre|title=subgenre|publisher=dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/subgenre|title=Subgenre|work=The Free Dictionary|publisher=Farlex}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two stories being the same genre can still sometimes differ in subgenre. For example, if a [[fantasy]] story has darker and more frightening elements of fantasy, it would belong in the subgenre of [[dark fantasy]]; whereas another fantasy story that features [[magic sword]]s and [[Magician (fantasy)|wizards]] would belong to the subgenre of [[sword and sorcery]].

'''"Godiva's Hymn"''', '''"Engineer's Hymn"''' or '''"Engineers' Drinking Song"''' is a traditional [[drinking song]] for engineers.  Versions of it have been associated with the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]], as well as MIT and various universities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=An Engineer's Alphabet: Gleanings from the Softer Side of a Profession | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Petroski, Henry | year=2011 | pages=122 | isbn=9781139505307}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is now often performed by the MIT a cappella group The Chorallaries.  In many university [[engineering]] faculties, military engineering [[corps]] and other engineering organizations and [[Engineering Society|societies]], [[Lady Godiva]] is a school icon or [[mascot]].

Godiva's Hymn is sung either to the tune of "[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]" or "The Son of a Gambolier". Near Christmas, it is a tradition of the [[Lady Godiva Memorial Bnad]] ([[sic]]) of the [[University of Toronto]] to sing Godiva's Hymn to the tune of [[Good King Wenceslaus]].

One Version of the Chorus is as follows:&lt;ref name="quote"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://web.mit.edu/choral/www_old/repertoire/engineers.htm | title=the engineers' drinking song | publisher=MIT | accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;We are We are We are We are--
We are the engineers--
We can We can We can We can--
Demolish forty beers--
Drink rum Drink rum Drink rum all day--
and come along with us for--
We don't give a damn for any old man--
Who don't give a damn for us--&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of Godiva's Verses:&lt;ref name="quote"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Godiva was a lady who through Coventry did ride--
To show to all the villagers her fine and lily-white hide--
The most observant villager, an engineer of course--
Was the only one to notice that Godiva rode a horse--&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Parody version==
A bawdy parody of the engineer's song, known as [[Round and Round Went the Great Big Wheel]], was famously recorded during the 1940s by [[Oscar Brand]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.horntip.com/mp3/1950s/1956ca_bawdy_songs_vol_6_bawdy_western_songs_(LP)/14_the_great_big_wheel_(aka_the_engineers_song).htm Oscar Brand version]&lt;/ref&gt; It later served as the inspiration for an episode of [[Dad's Army]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/navysong/Data%20Song/B0011.htm Rugby songs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0552309/ Dads army]&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt; An [[engineer]] told me before he died
And I have no reason to say he lied
That though he tried throughout his life
He could never satisfy his wife

Round and round went the great big wheel
In and out went the rod of steel
I'll lay you money on a surefire bet
That the great big wheel is a-turning yet

So he mounted up a great big [[wheel]] 
And there upon set a [[dildo|rod of steel]]
Two brass balls were filled with cream
And the [[steampunk|whole darn thing was run by steam]]

Round and round went the great big wheel
In and out went the rod of steel
I'll lay you money on a surefire bet
That the great big wheel is a-turning yet

Then he rolled it up to the bedroom door
And the wheel started up with a mighty roar
It rolled to the bedpost and rolled on top
And pumped his wife til she hollered stop

Round and round went the great big wheel
In and out went the rod of steel
I'll lay you money on a surefire bet
That the great big wheel is a-turning yet

But the great big wheel went right on through
Til the engineer's wife was split in two
Then as if possessed by a monstrous [[wikt:whim#Noun|whim]]
It turned around and [[buggery|mounted him]]

Round and round went the great big wheel
In and out went the rod of steel
I'll lay you money on a surefire bet
That the great big wheel is a-turning yet

Then it rolled through the streets and into town
Mounting people up and down
Covered them all with [[Grease (lubricant)|grease]] and [[cream]]
And disappeared in a cloud of [[steam]]

Round and round went the great big wheel
In and out went the rod of steel
I'll lay you money on a surefire bet
That the great big wheel is a-turning yet

So if some day you should see a wheel
With two brass [[ball]]s and a rod of steel
Run to the [[prairie]], run to the hill
Unless you're looking for a longtime thrill

Round and round went the great big wheel
In and out went the rod of steel
I'll lay you money on a surefire bet
That the great big wheel is a-turning yet
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

{{Nihongo3|"fifth generation"|五世|'''Gosei'''}} is a [[Japanese diaspora|Japanese diasporic]] term used in countries, particularly in [[North America]] and in [[Latin America]], to specify the great-great-grandchildren of [[Japanese immigrants]] ([[Issei]]).  The children of Issei are [[Nisei]] (the second generation).  [[Sansei]] are the third generation, and their offspring are [[Yonsei (fourth-generation Nikkei)|Yonsei]].&lt;ref&gt;In Japanese counting, "one, two, three, four, five" is "''ichi, ni, san, yon, go''". Future generations would be called  ''rokusei'' (6th), 7th: ''nanasei'' (7th), etc. -- ''see'' [[Japanese numerals]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The children of at least one ''Yonsei'' parent are called ''Gosei''.&lt;ref&gt;Nomura, Gail M. (1998). "Japanese American Women," in {{Google books|d9lhBw8t410C|''The Reader's Companion to U.S. Women's History'' (Mankiller, Barbara Smith, ed.), pp. 288-290.|page=288}}; Masterson, Daniel '' et al.''

''Gosei'' is a term used in these geographic areas outside Japan.  ''Gosei'' characterizes the child of at least one ''Yonsei'' (fourth generation) parent.  Differences among these national ''Gosei'' developed because of the varying historical processes throuogh which their Japanese emigrant forebears became Nikkei.&lt;ref&gt;Ichioka, Yuji '' et al.''

'''Human interactions with fungi''' include both beneficial uses, whether practical or symbolic, and harmful interactions such as when fungi damage crops, timber, or food.

[[Yeasts]] have been used since ancient times to leaven bread and to [[fermentation|ferment]] [[beer]] and [[wine]]. More recently, [[mould]] fungi have been exploited to create a wide range of industrial products, including [[enzyme]]s and [[drug]]s. [[Drug|Medicines]] based on fungi include [[antibiotic]]s, [[immunosuppressant]]s, [[statin]]s and many [[anti-cancer drugs]]. The yeast species ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' is an important [[model organism]] in [[cell biology]]. The fruiting bodies of some larger fungi are collected as edible [[mushroom]]s, including delicacies like the [[chanterelle]], [[cep (mushroom)|cep]], and [[truffle]], while [[edible mushroom|a few species are cultivated]]. [[Mould]] fungi provide the [[umami|meaty (umami)]] flavour of fermented [[soybean]] products such as [[tempeh]], [[miso]] and [[soy sauce]], and contribute flavour and colour to [[blue cheese]]s including [[Roquefort]] and [[Stilton]]. Moulds also yield [[vegetarian]] [[meat substitute]]s like [[Quorn]]. Some fungi, especially the [[fly agaric]] and [[psilocybin mushroom]]s are used for the [[psychoactive drug]]s that they contain; these in particular are the focus of academic study in the field of [[ethnomycology]]. Fungi have appeared, too, from time to time, in literature and art.

Fungi create harm by [[food spoilage|spoiling food]], [[wood-decay fungi|destroying timber]], and by causing [[plant pathology#Fungi|diseases of crops]], [[Pathogenic fungus|livestock, and humans]]. Fungi, mainly moulds like ''[[Penicillium]]'' and ''[[Aspergillus]]'', spoil many stored foods. Fungi cause the majority of plant diseases, which in turn cause serious economic losses. Sometimes, as in the [[Great Irish Famine]] of 1845–1849, fungal diseases of plants, in this case potato blight caused by ''[[Phytophthora]]'', result in large-scale human suffering. Fungi are similarly the main cause of economic losses of timber in buildings. Finally, fungi cause many diseases of humans and livestock; [[Aspergillosis]] kills some 600,000 people a year, mainly however those with already weakened [[immune system]]s.

==Context==

[[Culture]] consists of the [[social behaviour]] and [[Norm (social)|norms]] found in [[human]] [[society|societies]] and transmitted through social [[learning]]. [[Cultural universals]] in all human societies include expressive forms like [[art]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[ritual]], [[religion]], and [[technology|technologies]] like [[tool|tool usage]], [[cooking]], [[shelter (building)|shelter]], and [[clothing]]. The concept of [[material culture]] covers physical expressions such as technology, architecture and art, whereas immaterial culture includes principles of [[social organization]], [[mythology]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]], and [[science]].&lt;ref name=MacionisGerber2011&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |title=Sociology |last=Macionis |first=John J. |last2=Gerber |first2=Linda Marie |date=2011 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0137001613 |page=53 |accessdate=29 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818045455/https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |archivedate=18 August 2017 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article describes the roles played by fungi in human culture.

[[Medicinal fungi|Fungi are the sources]] of many types of medicinal [[drug]] including [[antibiotic]]s, [[immunosuppressant]]s, and [[statin]]s. Major classes of antibiotics, the [[penicillin]]s and the [[cephalosporin]]s, are derived from substances produced by fungi. So also are the immunosuppressant [[macrolide]]s, the [[cyclosporins]].&lt;ref name="Kew"&gt;{{cite web |title=The importance of fungi |url=http://www.kew.org/science-conservation/plants-fungi/fungi/importance |publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens Kew |accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In folk medicine===
{{further|Folk medicine}}

Many fungi have been used as [[folk medicine]]s around the world, including in [[Europe]] and in [[India]] where traditions are well documented. Some have been found to have useful active ingredients, though these do not always correspond with traditional uses of the fungi concerned. Ergot and various cereal smuts, such as ''[[Ustilago tritici]]'' (wheat grain smut) were used for disorders of pregnancy. Yeasts, made into a boiled paste with wheat flour, were used in India to treat fevers and dysentery. Wounds were treated in Europe with moulds, using for example a slice of mouldy bread or mouldy wheat straw, with active ingredients [[patulin]] and other penicillin-like compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vaidya |first1=J.

Fungi have appeared from time to time in literature, both for children and for adults. In [[Lewis Carroll]]'s 1865 ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', Alice grows larger if she eats one side of the mushroom, and shrinks if she eats from the other side. [[Shakespeare]] has [[Prospero]] remark in ''[[The Tempest]]'' that elves "make midnight mushrooms". Poems and novels about or mentioning fungi have been written by [[Edmund Spenser]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Keats]], [[Tennyson]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[D. H. Lawrence]], and [[Emily Dickinson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fungal Folklore |url=http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/sgc-cms/expositions-exhibitions/champignons-mushrooms/English/Folklore/art.html |publisher=Virtual Museum of Canada |accessdate=14 September 2018 |date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tennyson referred to the [[fairy ring mushroom]] (''Marasmius'') with the phrase "the fairy footings on the grass".&lt;ref name=Farell2018&gt;{{cite news |last1=Farell |first1=Aimee |title=Magic mushrooms: fashion's favourite food |url=https://www.ft.com/content/8a215ca0-49fb-11e8-8c77-ff51caedcde6 |accessdate=14 September 2018 |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harmful interactions==

===Food spoilage===
[[File:Braeburn-rotten.jpg|thumb|An apple spoiled by a soft ''[[Penicillium]]'' type fungal rot]]
{{further|Food spoilage}}

Fungi, especially moulds but also yeasts, are important agents of [[food spoilage]]. 
''[[Penicillium]]'' moulds cause soft rot such as of [[apple]]s, while ''[[Aspergillus]]'' moulds create patches on the surface of old bread, yoghurt and many other foods. Yeasts spoil sugary foods such as [[plums]] and jams, fermenting the sugars to alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pitt |first1=John I. |last2=Hocking |first2=Ailsa D.|title=Fungi and Food Spoilage |date=2009 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-92206-5 |pages=169–273 (Penicillium); 275–337 (Aspergillus); 357–382 (Yeasts)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific understanding of spoilage began in the 19th century with works such as [[Louis Pasteur]]'s 1879 ''Studies on Fermentation'', which investigated the spoilage of beer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Pasteur|Pasteur, Louis]] (1879) ''Studies on fermentation: The diseases of beer, their causes, and the means of preventing them''.

Honey fungus is a serious horticultural pest, as it can spread from tree to tree by long strap-shaped [[rhizomorph]]s in the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honey fungus |url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?PID=180 |publisher=Royal Horticultural Society |accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human interactions with insects''' include both a wide variety of uses, whether practical such as for food, textiles, and dyestuffs, or symbolic, as in art, music, and literature, and negative interactions including serious damage to crops and extensive efforts to eliminate insect pests. 

Academically, the interaction of insects and society has been treated in part as '''cultural entomology''', dealing mostly with "advanced" societies, and in part as '''ethnoentomology''', dealing mostly with "primitive" societies, though the distinction is weak and not based on theory. Both academic disciplines explore the parallels, connections and influence of [[insects]] on human populations, and vice versa. They are rooted in [[anthropology]] and [[natural history]], as well as [[entomology]], the study of insects. Other [[culture|cultural]] uses of insects, such as [[biomimicry]], do not necessarily lie within these academic disciplines.

More generally, people make a wide range of uses of insects, both practical and symbolic. On the other hand, attitudes to insects are often negative, and extensive efforts are made to kill them. The widespread use of [[insecticide]]s has failed to exterminate any [[insect pest]], but has caused resistance to commonly-used chemicals in a thousand insect species.

Practical uses include [[entomophagy|as food]], [[Insects in medicine|in medicine]], for the valuable [[textile]] [[silk]], for [[dyestuff]]s such as [[carmine]], in science, where the [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]] is an important [[model organism]] in [[genetics]], and [[Entomological warfare|in warfare]], where insects were successfully used in the [[Second World War]] to spread disease in enemy populations. One insect, the [[honey bee]], provides [[honey]], [[pollen]], [[royal jelly]], [[propolis]] and an anti-inflammatory peptide, [[melittin]]; its larvae too are eaten in some societies. Medical uses of insects include [[maggot therapy]] for wound [[debridement]]. Over a thousand protein families have been identified in the saliva of blood-feeding insects; these may provide useful drugs such as anticoagulants, [[vasodilation|vasodilators]], [[antihistamine]]s and [[anaesthetic]]s.

Symbolic uses include roles [[Insects in art|in art]], [[Insects in music|in music]] (with [[List of insect-inspired songs|many songs featuring insects]]), [[Arthropods in film|in film]], [[Insects in literature|in literature]], [[Insects in religion|in religion]], and in mythology. Insect [[costume]]s are used in theatrical productions and worn for parties and carnivals.

==Context==

===Culture===

[[Culture]] consists of the [[social behaviour]] and [[Norm (social)|norms]] found in [[human]] [[society|societies]] and transmitted through social [[learning]]. [[Cultural universals]] in all human societies include expressive forms like [[art]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[ritual]], [[religion]], and [[technology|technologies]] like [[tool|tool usage]], [[cooking]], [[shelter (building)|shelter]], and [[clothing]]. The concept of [[material culture]] covers physical expressions such as technology, architecture and art, whereas immaterial culture includes principles of [[social organization]], [[mythology]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]], and [[science]].&lt;ref name=MacionisGerber2011&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |title=Sociology |last=Macionis |first=John J. |last2=Gerber |first2=Linda Marie |date=2011 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0137001613 |page=53 |accessdate=29 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818045455/https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |archivedate=18 August 2017 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article describes the roles played by insects in human culture so defined.

===Cultural entomology and ethnoentomology===

[[File:Malay Archipelago Beetles.jpg|thumb|left|"[[The Malay Archipelago|Remarkable Beetles Found at Simunjon, Borneo]]": [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] was a pioneer of ethnoentomology.]]

Ethnoentomology developed from the 19th century with early works by authors such as [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] (1852) and [[Henry Walter Bates]] (1862). [[Hans Zinsser]]'s "classic" ''[[Rats, Lice and History]]'' (1935) showed that insects were an important force in human history. Writers like [[William Morton Wheeler]], [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], and [[Jean Henri Fabre]] described insect life and  communicated their meaning to people "with imagination and brilliance". Frederick Simon Bodenheimer's ''Insects as Human Food'' (1951) drew attention to the scope and potential of entomophagy, and showed a positive aspect of insects.

In 1968, {{Interlanguage link multi|Erwin Schimitschek|de}} claimed cultural entomology as a branch of insect studies, in a review of the roles insects played in [[folklore]] and culture including [[religion]], food, medicine and the arts.&lt;ref name="Schimitschek 1968"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schimitschek |first=E. |title=Handbuch der Zoologie |year=1968 |publisher=Berliner Akademie Verlag|editor=Helmcke J.G. |editor2=Stark D. |editor3=Wermuth H. |chapter=Insekten als Nahrung, Brauchtum, Kult und Kultur |volume= 4 | pages=1–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, [[Charles Hogue]] covered the field in English and from 1994 to 1997, Hogue's ''The Cultural Entomology Digest'' served as a forum on the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hogue|first=Charles|title=Cultural Entomology|url=http://www.insects.org/ced1/cult_ent.html|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who? What? Why?|url=http://www.insects.org/ced1/who_what_why.html |publisher=Cultural Entomology Digest |accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hogue argued that "Humans spend their intellectual energies in three basic areas of activity: surviving, using practical learning (the application of technology); seeking pure knowledge through inductive mental processes (science); and pursuing enlightenment to taste a pleasure by aesthetic exercises that may be referred to as the "humanities." [[Entomology]] has long been concerned with survival ([[economic entomology]]) and scientific study (academic entomology), but the branch of investigation that addresses the influence of insects (and other terrestrial Arthropoda, including [[arachnids]] and [[myriapods]]) in literature, language, music, the arts, interpretive history, religion, and recreation has only become recognized as a distinct field through Schimitschek's work.&lt;ref name="Schimitschek 1968"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schimitschek 1961"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Schimitschek | first=E. | title=Die Bedeutung der Insekten für Kultur und Wirtschaft des Menschen in Vergangenheit und Gegenwart | journal=Istanbul Universitesi | date= 1961 |volume= 908: | pages=1–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hogue 1987"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hogue |first=Charles |title=Cultural Entomology |journal=Annual Review of Entomology |date=January 1987|volume= 32 |pages=181–199 |doi= 10.1146/annurev.en.32.010187.001145}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hogue set out the boundaries of the field by saying: "The narrative history of the science of entomology is not part of cultural entomology, while the influence of insects on general [[history]] would be considered cultural entomology."&lt;ref name="Hogue"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hogue |first=Charles |title=Cultural Entomology |url=http://www.insects.org/ced1/cult_ent.html |publisher=Cultural Entomology Digest |accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added: "Because the term "cultural" is narrowly defined, some aspects normally included in studies of human societies are excluded."&lt;ref name="Hogue"/&gt;

Darrell Addison Posey, noting that the boundary between cultural entomology and ethnoentomology is difficult to draw, cites Hogue as limiting cultural entomology to the influence of insects on "the essence of humanity as expressed in the arts and humanities". Posey notes further that cultural anthropology is usually restricted to the study of "advanced", industrialised, and literate societies, whereas ethnoentomology studies "the entomological concerns of 'primitive' or 'noncivilized' societies". Posey states at once that the division is artificial, complete with an unjustified us/them bias.&lt;ref name=Posey/&gt; Brian Morris similarly criticises the way that anthropologists treat non-Western attitudes to nature as monadic and spiritualist, and contrast this "in [[gnostic]] fashion" with a simplistic treatment of Western, often 17th century, mechanistic attitude. Morris considers this "quite unhelpful, if not misleading", and offers instead his own research into the multiple ways that the people of [[Malawi]] relate to insects and other animals: "pragmatic, intellectual, realist, practical, aesthetic, symbolic and sacramental."&lt;ref&gt;Morris, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits and costs==

===Insect ecosystem services===
[[File:Honeybee (Apis mellifera) pollinating Avocado cv.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pollination]], here by a bee on an [[avocado]] crop, is an [[ecosystem service]].]]

The [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]] (MEA) report 2005 defines [[ecosystem services]] as benefits people obtain from ecosystems, and distinguishes four categories, namely provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural. A fundamental tenet is that a few species of arthropod are well understood for their influence on humans (such as honeybees, [[ant]]s, [[mosquito]]es, and [[spider]]s).  However, insects offer [[ecological goods and services]].&lt;ref name=MEA&gt;{{cite book|last1=Millennium Ecosystem Assessment|title=Ecosystems and human well-being : synthesis|date=2005|publisher=Island Press|url=http://www.millenniumassessment.org/documents/document.356.aspx.pdf|location=Washington, DC|isbn=1-59726-040-1|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Xerces Society]] calculates the economic impact of four ecological services rendered by insects: pollination, recreation (i.e. "the importance of bugs to [[hunting]], [[fishing]], and wildlife observation, including [[bird-watching]]"), dung burial, and [[biological pest control|pest control]].

==Practical uses==

===As food===
{{main article|Entomophagy}}
[[File:Witchetty grub.jpg|thumb|left|[[Witchetty grub]]s were prized as food by [[Australian aborigine]]s.]]

[[Entomophagy]] is the eating of insects. Many insects are considered a culinary [[delicacy]] in some societies around the world, and Frederick Simon Bodenheimer's ''Insects as Human Food'' (1951) drew attention to the scope and potential of entomophagy,  but the practice is uncommon and even taboo in other societies. Sometimes insects are considered suitable only for the poor in the third world, but in 1975 Victor Meyer-Rochow suggested that insects could help ease global future food shortages and advocated a change in western attitudes towards cultures in which insects were appreciated as a food item.&lt;ref name="Meyer-Rochow 1975"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Meyer-Rochow | first=Victor Benno | title=Can insects help to ease the problem of world food shortage? | journal= ANZAAS Journal: "Search"| date= 1975|volume= 6 |issue= 7 | pages=261–262}}&lt;/ref&gt;  P.J. Gullan and P.S. Cranston felt that the remedy for this may be marketing of insect dishes as suitably exotic and costly to make them acceptable. They also note that some societies in sub-Saharan Africa prefer [[caterpillar]]s to beef, while Chakravorty et al. (2011) &lt;ref name="Nyishi"&gt;Chakravorty, J., Ghosh, S., and V.B. Meyer-Rochow. (2011). Practices of entomophagy and entomotherapy by members of the Nyishi and Galo tribes, two ethnic groups of the state of Arunachal Pradesh (North-East India). ''Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 7(5)''&lt;/ref&gt; point out that food insects (highly appreciated in North-East India) are more expensive than meat. The economics, i.e., the costs involved collecting food insects and the money earned through the sale of such insects, have been studied in a Laotian setting by Meyer-Rochow et al. (2008).&lt;ref name="Laos"&gt;Meyer-Rochow V.B., Nonaka K., Boulidam S (2008) More feared than revered: Insects and their impacts on human societies (with specific data on the importance of entomophagy in a Laotian setting.

In Guangdong, water beetles fetch a high enough price for these insects to be farmed. Especially high prices are fetched in Thailand for the giant water bug ''[[Lethocerus indicus]]''.&lt;ref name=GullanCranston2009/&gt;

{{main article|Insects in medicine}}

Insects have been used medicinally in cultures around the world, often according to the [[Doctrine of Signatures]]. Thus, the femurs of grasshoppers, which were said to resemble the human liver, were used to treat liver ailments by the indigenous peoples of Mexico.&lt;ref name="Mexico"&gt;Ramos-Elorduy de Concini, J. and J.M. Pino Moreno. (1988). The utilization of insects in the empirical medicine of ancient Mexicans. ''Journal of Ethnobiology, 8(2), 195–202.''&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine was applied in both [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] (TCM) and in [[Ayurveda]]. TCM uses arthropods for various purposes; for example, [[centipede]] is used to treat tetanus, seizures, and convulsions,&lt;ref name="centipede"&gt;http://tcm.health-info.org/Herbology.Materia.Medica/wugong-properties.htm&lt;/ref&gt; while the Chinese Black Mountain Ant, ''[[Polyrhachis]] vicina'', is used as a cure all, especially by the elderly, and extracts have been examined as a possible anti-cancer agent.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1809450.stm&lt;/ref&gt; Ayurveda uses insects such as [[Termite]] for conditions such as ulcers, rheumatic diseases, anaemia, and pain. The [[Jatropha]] leaf miner's larvae are used boiled to induce lactation, reduce fever, and soothe the gastrointestinal tract.&lt;ref name="Nyishi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bioprospecting"&gt;Srivastava, S.K., Babu, N., and H. Pandey. (2009). Traditional insect bioprospecting—As human food and medicine. ''Indian Journal of Traditional Knowledge, 8(4):'' 485–494.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the traditional insect medicine of Africa is local and unformalised.&lt;ref name="Bioprospecting" /&gt; The indigenous peoples of Central America used a wide variety of insects medicinally. Mayans used [[Army ant]] soldiers as living [[Surgical suture|suture]]s.&lt;ref name="Mexico" /&gt; The venom of the [[Red harvester ant]] was used to cure [[rheumatism]], [[arthritis]], and [[poliomyelitis]] via the immune reaction produced by its sting.&lt;ref name="Mexico" /&gt; Boiled ''[[Bombyx mori|silkworm]]'' pupae were taken to treat [[apoplexy]], aphasy, [[bronchitis]], [[pneumonia]], convulsions, [[haemorrhage]]s, and frequent urination.&lt;ref name="Mexico" /&gt;

[[Honey bee]] products are used medicinally in [[apitherapy]] across Asia, Europe, Africa, Australia, and the Americas, despite the fact that the honey bee was not introduced to the Americas until the colonization by Spain and Portugal.  They are by far the most common medical insect product both historically and currently, and the most frequently referenced of these is [[honey]].&lt;ref name="Bioprospecting" /&gt; It can be applied to skin to treat excessive scar tissue, rashes, and burns,&lt;ref name="China"&gt;Feng, Y., Zhao, M., He, Z., Chen, Z., and L.

Insects play an important role in biological research.

Some hemipterans are used to produce [[dyestuff]]s such as [[carmine]] (also called [[cochineal]]). The scale insect ''[[Dactylopius coccus]]'' produces the brilliant red-coloured [[carminic acid]] to [[Antipredator adaptation|deter predators]]. Up to 100,000 scale insects are needed to make a kilogram (2.2&amp;nbsp;lbs) of cochineal dye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/v8879e/v8879e09.htm |title=Cochineal and Carmine |work=Major colourants and dyestuffs, mainly produced in horticultural systems |publisher=FAO |accessdate=June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/ColorAdditives/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/ucm153038.htm |title=Guidance for Industry: Cochineal Extract and Carmine |publisher=FDA |accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insects feature in folklore around the world. In China, farmers traditionally regulated their crop planting according to the [[Jingzhe|Awakening of the Insects]], when temperature shifts and monsoon rains bring insects out of hibernation.

In the Brazilian [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]], members of the [[Tupí–Guaraní]] language family have been observed using ''Pachycondyla commutata'' ants during female rite-of-passage ceremonies, and prescribing the sting of ''Pseudomyrmex'' spp. for fevers and headaches.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Balée]] (2000), "Antiquity of Traditional Ethnobiological Knowledge in Amazonia: a Tupí–Guaraní Family and Time" ''Ethnohistory'' 47(2):399–422.&lt;/ref&gt;

The red harvester ant ''[[Pogonomyrmex californicus]]'' has been widely used by natives of Southern California and Northern Mexico for hundreds of years in ceremonies conducted to help tribe members acquire spirit helpers through hallucination.  During the ritual, young men are sent away from the tribe and consume large quantities of live, unmasticated ants under the supervision of an elderly member of the tribe.  Ingestion of ants should lead to a prolonged state of unconsciousness, where dream helpers appear and serve as allies to the dreamer for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Groark.

{{main article|Insects in art}}

Both the symbolic form and the actual body of insects have been used to adorn humans in ancient and modern times. A recurrent theme for ancient cultures in Europe and the Near East regarded the sacred image of a bee or human with insect features.  Often referred to as the bee "goddess",  these images were found in gems and stones. An onyx gem from [[Knossos]] (ancient Crete) dating to approximately 1500 BC illustrates a Bee goddess with bull horns above her head.  In this instance, the figure is surrounded by dogs with wings, most likely representing [[Hecate]] and [[Artemis]] – gods of the underworld, similar to the Egyptian gods Akeu and Anubis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gough |first=Andrew |title=The Bee Part 2 Beewildered |url=http://andrewgough.co.uk/bee2_1.html |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Beetlewing]] art is an ancient craft technique using iridescent beetle wings practiced traditionally in [[Thailand]], [[Myanmar]], [[India]], [[China]] and [[Japan]]. Beetlewing pieces are used as an adornment to paintings, textiles and jewelry. Different species of metallic wood-boring beetle wings were used depending on the region, but traditionally the most valued were those from beetles belonging to the genus [[Sternocera]].  The practice comes from across Asia and Southeast Asia, especially Thailand, Myanmar, Japan, India and China.  In Thailand beetlewings were preferred to decorate clothing (shawls and Sabai cloth) and jewellery in former court circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Beetle-Wing Tea-Cosy |url=https://hampshireculturaltrust.org.uk/content/beetle-wing-tea-cosy |publisher=Hampshire Cultural Trust |accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian entomologist [[C.H. Curran]]'s 1945 book, ''Insects of the Pacific World'', noted women from India and Sri Lanka, who kept 1 1/2 inch long, iridescent greenish coppery beetles of the species ''[[Chrysochroa ocellata]]'' as pets. These living jewels were worn on festive occasions, probably with a small chain attached to one leg anchored to the clothing to prevent escape. Afterwards, the insects were bathed, fed, and housed in decorative cages. Living jewelled beetles have also been worn and kept as pets in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rivers |first=Victoria |title=Beetles in Textiles |url=http://www.insects.org/ced2/beetles_tex.html |work=[[Cultural Entomology Digest]] February |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Butterflies]] have long inspired humans with their life cycle, color, and ornate patterns. The novelist [[Vladimir Nabokov]] was also a renowned butterfly expert. He published and illustrated many butterfly species, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I discovered in nature the nonutilitarian delights that I sought in art. Both were a form of magic, both were games of intricate enchantment and deception."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nabokov |first=Vladimir |title=Speak, Memory |year=1989 |publisher=Vintage International |location=New York |page=129 |url=http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/tract/nabokov.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was the aesthetic complexity of insects that led Nabokov to reject [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ahuja |first=Nitin |title=Nabokov's Case Against Natural Selection |journal=Tract |url=http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/tract/nabokov.html |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nabokov |first=Vladimir |title=Strong Opinions |year=1990 |publisher=Vintage International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The naturalist Ian MacRae writes of butterflies:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...&amp;nbsp;the animal is at once awkward, flimsy, strange, bouncy in flight, yet beautiful and immensely sympathetic; it is painfully transient, albeit capable of extreme migrations and transformations. Images and phrases such as "kaleidoscopic instabilities," "oxymoron of similarities," "rebellious rainbows," "visible darkness" and "souls of stone" have much in common. They bring together the two terms of a conceptual contradiction, thereby facilitating the mixing of what should be discrete and mutually exclusive categories&amp;nbsp;... In positing such questions, butterfly science, an inexhaustible, complex, and finely nuanced field, becomes not unlike the human imagination, or the field of literature itself. In the natural history of the animal, we begin to sense its literary and artistic possibilities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacRae |first=Ian |title=Butterfly Chronicles: Imagination and Desire in Natural &amp; Literary Histories |journal=Canadian Journal of Environ Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Ancient Greek]] playwright [[Aeschylus]] has a [[horse-fly|gadfly]] pursue and torment [[Io (mythology)|Io]], a maiden associated with the moon, watched constantly by the eyes of the herdsman Argus, associated with all the stars: "Io: Ah! Hah! Again the prick, the stab of gadfly-sting! O earth, earth, hide, the hollow shape—Argus—that evil thing—the hundred-eyed." [[William Shakespeare]], inspired by Aeschylus, has [[Tom o'Bedlam]] in ''[[King Lear]]'', "Whom the foul fiend hath led through fire and through flame, through ford and whirlpool, o'er bog and quagmire", driven mad by the constant pursuit.&lt;ref name="Stagman2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stagman |first=Myron |title=Shakespeare's Greek Drama Secret |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=encnBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207 |date=11 August 2010 |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |isbn=978-1-4438-2466-8 |pages=205–208}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', Shakespeare similarly likens Cleopatra's hasty departure from the [[Battle of Actium|Actium battlefield]] to that of a cow chased by a gadfly.&lt;ref name="Walker2002"&gt;{{cite book |last=Walker |first=John Lewis |title=Shakespeare and the Classical Tradition: An Annotated Bibliography, 1961–1991 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q3Voi0Dk_HwC&amp;pg=PA363 |year=2002 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-8240-6697-0 |page=363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lafcadio Hearn]]'s essay ''Butterflies'' analyses the treatment of the butterfly in [[Japanese literature]], both prose and poetry. He notes that these often allude to Chinese tales, such as of the young woman that the butterflies took to be a flower. He translates 22 Japanese [[Haiku]] poems about butterflies, including one by the Haiku master [[Matsuo Bashō]], said to suggest happiness in springtime: "Wake up! Wake up!—I will make thee my comrade, thou sleeping butterfly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hearn |first1=Lafcadio |authorlink=Lafcadio Hearn |title=Insect Literature |date=2015 |publisher=Swan River Press |location=Dublin |isbn=978-1-78380-009-4 |edition=Limited (300 copies) |pages=1–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Flight of the Bumblebee]]'' was written by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]], in 1899–1900, as part of his opera, ''The Tale of Tsar of Saltan''.  The piece is one of the most recognizable pieces in classical composition.  The [[bumblebee]] in the story is a prince who has been transformed into an insect so that he can fly off to visit his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rimsky-Korsakov – The Flight of the Bumblebee (Homeschool Music Appreciation) |url=http://creatingwithwisdom.blogspot.com/2012/05/rimsky-korsakov-flight-of-bumblebee.html |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="Eric Speed, Violinist, Flight of the Bumblebee, Nikon S9100, Montreal, 22 July 2011".|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0UCNOdWxI |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Green Hornet|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv2-Tz4wPCI|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play upon which the opera was based – written by [[Alexandr Pushkin]] – originally had two more insect themes: the Flight of the Mosquito and the Flight of the Fly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Neff,|first=Lyle |title=The Tale of Tsar Saltan: A Centenary Appreciation of Rimski-Korsakov's Second Puškin Opera |journal=The Pushkin Review | volume=2 |year=1999 |pages=89–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NGC 6302 Hubble 2009.full.jpg|thumb|upright|The Butterfly Nebula, [[NGC 6302]]]]

"The Bug Nebula", also called "The Butterfly Nebula", is a more recent discovery. Known as [[NGC 6302]] is one of the brightest and most popular stars in the universe – popular in that its features draw the attention of a lot of researchers.  It happens to be located in the [[Scorpius]] constellation.  It is perfectly bipolar, and until recently, the central star was unobservable, clouded by gas, but estimated to be one of the hottest in the galaxy – 200,000 degrees Fahrenheit, perhaps 35 times hotter than our Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Matsuura, M. |author2=Zijlstra, A.

The honey bee played a central role in the cosmology of the [[Mayan people]]. The stucco figure at the temples of Tulum known as "Ah Mucen Kab" – the Diving Bee God – bears resemblance to the insect in the Codex Tro-Cortesianus identified as a bee.  Such reliefs might have indicated towns and villages that produce honey. Modern Mayan authorities say the figure also have a connection to modern cosmology. Mayan mythology expert Migel Angel Vergara relates that the Mayans held a belief that bees came from Venus, the "Second Sun." The relief might be indicative of another "insect deity", that of Xux Ex, the Mayan "wasp star."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunter |first=C.

[[Ovo (Cirque du Soleil)|Ovo]] is an insect-themed production by the world renowned Canadian entertainment company [[Cirque du Soleil]]. The show looks at the world of insects and its biodiversity where they go about their daily lives until a mysterious egg appears in their midst, as the insects become awestruck about this iconic object that represents the enigma and cycles of their lives. The costuming was a fusion of arthropod body types blended with superhero armour. Liz Vandal, the lead costume designer, has a special affinity for the world of the insect:&lt;ref name=Cirque/&gt;

{{quote|When I was just a kid I put rocks down around the yard near the fruit trees and I lifted them regularly to watch the insects who had taken up residence underneath them. I petted caterpillars and let butterflies into the house. So when I learned that OVO was inspired by insects, I immediately knew that I was in a perfect position to pay tribute to this majestic world with my costumes.

The Webby award-winning video series ''Green Porno'' was created to showcase the reproductive habits of insects.  Jody Shapiro and Rick Gilbert were responsible for translating the research and concepts that [[Isabella Rossellini]] envisioned into the paper and paste costumes which directly contribute to the series' unique visual style. The film series was driven by the creation of costumes to translate scientific research into "something visual and how to make it comical."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kung |first=Michelle |title="Green Porno" Creator Isabella Rossellini on Animal Sex, Crazed Fans and Web Entertainment |journal=[[Wall Street Journal]] |series=Retrieved 2009-11-06 |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Humanist Generation''' is the name given by [[sociology|sociologists]] to describe the [[generation]] of people, born 1461–1482.  It is an identified cohort within the [[Strauss–Howe generational theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Neil; Strauss, William, The Fourth Turning. (Broadway Books, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[generation]] came of age at the height of the [[Middle Ages]], just prior to the [[Reformation]] and [[Renaissance]]. For the educated classes life was fairly static, with [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance Humanist teaching]] and a clear career path through the [[Catholic Church|church]] or State bureaucracy becoming increasingly available for the educated [[middle class]]es. [[Renaissance humanism|Humanist]] influences took hold across [[Europe]], and in many ways prepared the intellectual landscape for the coming [[reformation]]. Their youth coincided with the development of the [[Europe]]an [[Printing press]] allowing a greater dissemination of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/press.html  The Printing Press].&lt;/Ref&gt;

==Notable persons==
Some of the notable persons who influenced this generation include [[Thomas More]], [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]], [[Thomas Linacre]], [[John Colet]], [[Cardinal Wolsey]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Copernicus]], [[Francisco Pizarro]] and [[Cesare Borgia]].

[[King Edward V]] was also born into this generation, but as he died at only 15 years old, it is difficult to properly place him in this archetype. However, according to the historian [[Dominic Mancini]] Edward was very fascinated with science and philosophy, and was very well learned beyond his years.&lt;ref&gt;Dominic Mancini, ''The Usurpation of Richard III'' (1483), in [https://books.google.com/books?id=jRsLUVOCqbkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21287">'''Interindividual differences in perception''' describes the effect that differences in brain structure or factors such as culture, upbringing and environment have on the [[perception]] of humans.
Interindividual (differing from person to person) variability is usually regarded as a source of noise for research. However, in recent years, it has become an interesting source to study sensory mechanisms and understand [[human behavior]]. With the help of modern [[neuroimaging]] methods such as [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] and [[Electroencephalography|EEG]], individual differences in perception could be related to the underlying brain mechanisms. This has helped to explain differences in  behavior and [[cognition]] across the population. Common methods include studying the perception of [[illusion]]s, as they can effectively demonstrate how different aspects such as [[culture]], [[Human genetics|genetics]] and the [[Human ecology|environment]] can influence human behavior.

==Optical Illusions==

===Bistable Motion===

 }}

A motion quartet is a [[Bistability|bistable]] stimulus - it consists of two dots that change their position from frame to frame. This position change can either be interpreted as horizontal or vertical movement by viewers, and this experience can switch during viewing between interpretations. Depending on the [[aspect ratio]] of the two dots' positions, one or the other state is perceived longer or more often. At an aspect ratio of one, the illusion is biased towards the vertical perception. The reason for this might be the way the human brain processes the signals from both eyes in the [[visual system]]. The right half of an eye's field of view is processed by the left hemisphere, and the left half by the right hemisphere. A stimulus moving vertically only involves one field of view and so one hemisphere, while a stimulus moving vertically from one field of view to the other involves both hemispheres, and requires communication between them. The delay caused by this additional signalling might be the cause for the bias.&lt;ref name="metastable anisotropy"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Metastable motion anisotropy. | author=Chaudhuri, Avi | journal=Visual Neuroscience | year=1991 | volume=7 | issue=5 | pages=397–407 | pmid=1764411 | doi=10.1017/s0952523800009706}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also individual differences in the way the motion quartet is perceived: Some people require a different aspect ratio to perceive both axes of movement than others.
A study using diffusion tensor imaging further showed differences in the structure of the corpus callosum, the primary connection between the two hemispheres, might be the origin of these differences.&lt;ref name="Genç bistable"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982211008773 | title=Interhemispheric Connections Shape Subjective Experience of Bistable Motion | author= Genç, Erhan | journal=Current Biology | year=2011 |  volume=21 | issue=17 | pages=1494–1499 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2011.08.003| pmid=21885284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Object size estimation===
There exist a variety of illusions that make objects appear bigger or smaller compared to their real size. Two such illusions are the [[Ebbinghaus illusion|Ebbinghaus]] and the [[Ponzo illusion|Ponzo]] illusions. The Ebbinghaus illusion makes a dot seem bigger because it is surrounded by smaller dots, while the Ponzo illusion exploits human [[Perspective (visual)#Linear perspective|perspective]] processing by making a dot appear bigger because it seems farther away. Schwarzkopf et al.&lt;ref name="surface_V1" /&gt; found that the size of the [[Visual cortex#Primary visual cortex .28V1.29|primary visual cortex (V1)]] has an effect on the magnitude of these illusions. The larger the subject's V1 surface area was, the less the subjects fell for the illusion. This is hypothesized to be due to the fact that a larger V1 dedicated to the same portion of the visual field means a lesser effect of later, fixed-size visual areas (which are the ones that are responsible for the illusion effect).&lt;ref name="surface_V1"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v14/n1/full/nn.2706.html | title=The surface area of human V1 predicts the subjective experience of object size | author=Schwarzkopf, D Samuel | journal=Nature Neuroscience | volume=14 | year=2011 | issue=1 | pages=28–30 | doi=10.1038/nn.2706 | pmid=21131954 | pmc=3012031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Auditory Illusions==

===McGurk Effect===
The [[McGurk effect]] is an auditory illusion in which people perceive a different syllable when incongruent audiovisual speech is presented: an auditory syllable "ba" is presented while the mouth movement is "ga". As a result, the listener perceives the syllable "da". However, according to Gentilucci and Cattaneo (2005), not everyone perceives this illusion; only about 26% to 98% of the population are susceptible to this illusion.&lt;ref name="McGurk"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gentilucci | first1 = M. | last2 = Cattaneo | first2 = L. | year = 2005 | title = Automatic audiovisual integration in speech perception" ''Experimental Brain Research'' 167(1), 66-75. McGurk, H., &amp; MacDonald, J. (1976). Hearing lips and seeing voices | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 264 | issue = | pages = 746–748 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the psychological models that explains the interindividual differences in speech perception is the [[fuzzy logic]] model of speech perception&lt;ref name="fuzzy speech"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oden | first1 = G. C. | last2 = Massaro | first2 = D. W. | year = 1978 | title = Integration of featural information in speech perception | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 85 | issue = 3| pages = 172–191 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.85.3.172 | pmid=663005}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this model, a categorization process is carried out when processing speech sounds. When listening to a stimulus, the features of the acoustic signal are analyzed. Subsequently, this signal is compared with the features that are stored in the memory; finally the sound is classified into the category that best fits. However, this classification may have a blurred boundary respectively to the category which the sound belongs to. As a result, the final decision may depend on integration of multiple sources of information. When the McGurk effect is presented the auditory and visual components of the speech are separately evaluated before being integrated. In those who perceive the McGurk effect, the visual information has a higher influence on the perception of the ambiguous audiovisual information and thus the sound is classified as "da".

Many studies have concluded that the area responsible for the perception of this phenomenon is the left [[Superior temporal sulcus|superior temporal sulcus(STS)]].&lt;ref name="McGurk_Nath"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nath | first1 = A. R. | last2 = Beauchamp | first2 = M. S. | year = 2012 | title = A neural basis for interindividual differences in the McGurk effect, a multisensory speech illusion | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 59 | issue = 1| pages = 781–787 | doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.07.024 | pmid=21787869 | pmc=3196040}}&lt;/ref&gt; This area is critical for the [[multisensory integration]] of visual and auditory information during speech perception. Moreover,  there is a correlation between the activation of the STS and the perception of the McGurk effect. In that sense, if the left STS  correctly integrates the mismatched audiovisual information, a McGurk effect is perceived; if the left STS is not active, the visual and auditory information are not integrated and thus a McGurk effect is not perceived.

In one study&lt;ref name="McGurk_Nath" /&gt; [[blood-oxygen-level dependent]] [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (BOLD fMRI) was used to measure the brain activity in perceivers and non-perceivers of the McGurk effect while presented with congruent audiovisual syllables, McGurk audiovisual syllables (auditory "ba" + visual "ga" producing perception of "da"),  and non-McGurk incongruent syllables( auditory "ga" + visual "ba" producing auditory perception of "ga"). The researchers found that there was a positive correlation between the amplitude of response in the left STS and the probability of perceiving the McGurk effect. In other words, the subject with the weakest STS activation to incongruent speech had the smallest probability of experiencing a McGurk percept; whereas the subject with the strongest STS response had the highest probability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK3T7LWIkP8|title=McGurk effect: Auditory "ba" + Visual "ga"|first=|last=anathfMRI|date=18 February 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beauchamp et al. (2010) highlight the critical role of the left STS in audiovisual integration.&lt;ref name="TMS"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beauchamp | first1 = M. S. | last2 = Nath | first2 = A. R. | last3 = Pasalar | first3 = S. | year = 2010 | title = fMRI-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation reveals that the superior temporal sulcus is a cortical locus of the McGurk effect | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 30 | issue = 7| pages = 2414–2417 | doi=10.1523/jneurosci.4865-09.2010 | pmid=20164324 | pmc=2844713}}&lt;/ref&gt; They applied single pulses of [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS) to the STS of McGurk perceivers during presentation of McGurk stimuli. The perception of the McGurk effect decreased from 94% to 43% and the subjects reported perceiving only the auditory syllable. Following from that, Beauchamp et al. conclude that the left STS is crucial for the audiovisual integration and thus for the perception of the McGurk effect.

Moreover, another study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gurler | first1 = D. | last2 = Doyle | first2 = N. | last3 = Walker | first3 = E. | last4 = Magnotti | first4 = J. | last5 = Beauchamp | first5 = M. | year = 2015 | title = A link between individual differences in multisensory speech perception and eye movements | url = | journal = Attention, Perception, &amp; Psychophysics | volume = 77 | issue = 4| pages = 1333–1341 | doi=10.3758/s13414-014-0821-1| pmc = 4437244 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the basis of the interindividual differences in the perception of McGurk effect lies in the eye movements of the subject when viewing the talker’s face. The experimenters carried out an [[eye tracking]] study and measured the eye movements of the participants while viewing audiovisual speech. They found that people who spent more time fixating the mouth of the talker were the more likely to perceive the McGurk effect than those who rarely fixated on the mouth of the speaker.

===Other auditory illusions===
[[File:Pitch class space.svg|thumb|right|Representation of the [[pitch class]] circle with respect to tone height]]
Interindividual differences have also been researched for the '''[[Tritone paradox]] illusion'''. In this illusion, the subject successively listens to two tones, which are separated by a half [[octave]]. Each tone is made of a set of [[harmonics]] which have an octave relation. The listener has to decide if the two tones have a descending or ascending relation. According to [[Diana Deutsch]],&lt;ref name="Deutsch 1"&gt;Deutsch, D. (1991). The tritone paradox: An influence of language on music perception. Music Perception: An Interdisciplinary Journal, 8(4), 335-347.&lt;/ref&gt; the perception of the tones is influenced by the language spoken by the listener. The listener has a circular representation of the [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] of sounds that are common in their culture and based on that develops a pitch range of their speaking voice, which determines the orientation of the [[pitch class]] with respect to the height; when a given tone is in this range, it is taken as the highest position along the circle and depending on the second tone, the person perceives the pattern as ascending or descending. Deutsch&lt;ref name="Deutsch 1"/&gt; found that for people from [[California]], the tone in the highest position of the pitch-class circle is around C# and D whereas for people from southern [[England]] it is around G. According to those results, Deutsch hypothesized that the orientation of the pitch-class circle with respect to the height is similar for individuals from the same linguistic group and varies for individuals from different linguistic groups.

Other illusions found by Deutsch whose interpretation depends on interindividual differences is the '''phantom words illusion'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deutsch.ucsd.edu/psychology/pages.php?i=211|title=Diana Deutsch - Phantom Words|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This illusion consists of the continuous presentation of two meaningless syllables. In order to experience the illusion, it is necessary that the listener sits between two loudspeakers, one to the left and the other to the right. The syllables are presented offset in time, in such a way that while one syllable is coming from the left, the other syllable is coming from the right loudspeaker. It was shown that after a period of time, people start hearing words. According to Deutsch, the perceived words depend on the language spoken by the listener, their knowledge and their expectations. According to Shinn-Cunningham (2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shinn-Cunningham | first1 = B.G. | year = 2008 | title = Object-based auditory and visual attention | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 182–186 | doi=10.1016/j.tics.2008.02.003| pmc = 2699558}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the information is incomplete or contradictory, the perceptual system often fills this gaps with plausible interpretations and in that way allows new information to be efficiently processed.

==Effect of Culture on Perception==
[[File:Frame_and_Line_Test.svg|thumb|height=width|right|The framed line test]]
Several studies have shown that differences between individuals play a significant role in determining how a stimulus is perceived. These differences among people, in turn, are greatly influenced by one's own socio-cultural contexts. The research indicates that cultural factors influence the process of perception not just on lower-level (such as [[Cognitive neuroscience of visual object recognition|object perception]] and [[attention]] deployment), but also on the higher-order functions (such as [[theory of mind]] and [[emotion recognition]]).&lt;ref name= "Culture_and_self"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Markus|first1=Hazel R.|last2=Kitayama|first2=Shinobu|title=Culture and the self: Implications for cognition, emotion, and motivation.|journal=Psychological Review|date=1991|volume=98|issue=2|pages=224–253|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.98.2.224}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name= "holistic vs nalytical"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Masuda|first1=Takahiko|last2=Nisbett|first2=Richard E|title=Attending holistically versus analytically: Comparing the context sensitivity of Japanese and Americans|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=Nov 2001|volume= 81|issue=5|pages=922–934|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.81.5.922|pmid=11708567}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name= "New Look"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kitayama|first1=S.|last2=Duffy|first2=S.|last3=Kawamura|first3=T.|last4=Larsen|first4=J. T.|title=Perceiving an Object and Its Context in Different Cultures: A Cultural Look at New Look|journal=Psychological Science|date=1 May 2003|volume=14|issue=3|pages=201–206|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.02432|pmid=12741741}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two major cultures analyzed in these studies were mostly [[Western World|Western]] and [[East Asia]]n cultures because of the considerable differences in the social structure and practices. Western culture was referred to as an ''analytical'' culture whereas Eastern culture was referred more as a ''holistic'' culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freeman|first1=JB|last2=Rule|first2=NO|last3=Ambady|first3=N|title=The cultural neuroscience of person perception|journal=Progress in Brain Research|date=2009|volume=178|pages=191–201|doi=10.1016/S0079-6123(09)17813-5|pmid=19874970|series=Progress in Brain Research|isbn=9780444533616}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, [[individualism]] and [[freedom]] are the predominant values in Western societies, which in turn demand interpretation of an object in its absolute terms independent of its context. In contrast, Eastern culture is known for its emphasis on [[collectivism]] and [[interdependence]] on each other, where interpretation of an object is often in relation with its context&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nisbett|first1=RE|last2=Peng|first2=K|last3=Choi|first3=I|last4=Norenzayan|first4=A|title=Culture and systems of thought: holistic versus analytic cognition.|journal=Psychological Review|date=April 2001|volume=108|issue=2|pages=291–310|pmid=11381831|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.108.2.291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pioneer study examining these cultural differences in visual perception was conducted by Kitmaya et al. (2003).&lt;ref name="New Look"/&gt; The findings of that study provide behavioural evidence on how cultural factors affect visual perception and attention deployment. For the study, [[United States|Americans]] and [[Japan]]ese were taken as subjects. The visual stimulus shown to the subjects consisted of a square figure with a line hanging from the centre (the framed line test). First was the absolute condition, where the task was to redraw the line on the centre of the square in its absolute length, to a new square box independent of its size. Second was the relative condition, in which the task was to redraw the line on the centre of the square in proportionally similar to context of the new square box. The results show that Americans perform better in the absolute task which requires analytical processing of stimulus independent of it context, whereas the Japanese performed better at the relative task which demands the holistic processing of the stimulus in relation to its context.

In line with these findings, Hedden and colleagues (2009)&lt;ref name="Hedden 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hedden|first1=T.|last2=Mormino|first2=E. C.|last3=Amariglio|first3=R. E.|last4=Younger|first4=A. P.|last5=Schultz|first5=A. P.|last6=Becker|first6=J. A.|last7=Buckner|first7=R. L.|last8=Johnson|first8=K. A.|last9=Sperling|first9=R. A.|last10=Rentz|first10=D. M.|title=Cognitive Profile of Amyloid Burden and White Matter Hyperintensities in Cognitively Normal Older Adults|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|date=14 November 2012|volume=32|issue=46|pages=16233–16242|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2462-12.2012|pmid=23152607|pmc=3523110}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the same visual stimuli to investigate the neural activity with the help of fMRI. Participants of the study were asked to judge the length of a vertical line, either including the contextual information or ignoring it. The results revealed that separate brain regions were employed while performing  the task, either incorporating the contextual information or avoiding it, based on one's own culture. The areas associated with [[attentional control]] in the [[Frontal lobe|frontal]] and [[Parietal lobe|parietal]] region of the brain were highly activated when the subjects performed the task which was incongruent to their cultural pattern. That is, the activity in the fronto-parietal region enhanced when East Asians had to ignore the contextual information, while similar enhancement happened for Americans when they had to incorporate the contextual information. These findings illustrate that the function of the neural mechanisms are also modulated to some extent by one's own culture.&lt;ref name="Hedden 2009"/&gt;

A follow-up fMRI study by Gutchess, Welsh, Boduroglu, and Park (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gutchess|first1=AH|last2=Welsh|first2=RC|last3=Boduroglu|first3=A|last4=Park|first4=DC|title=Cultural differences in neural function associated with object processing.|journal=Cognitive, affective &amp; behavioral neuroscience|date=June 2006|volume=6|issue=2|pages=102–9|pmid=17007231|doi=10.3758/cabn.6.2.102}}&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed the previous findings by using a rather complex stimulus, which consists of ''only the object'' pictures, ''object with background'' pictures and ''only the background'' pictures without the object. This particular study was done on East-Asian Americans and non-Asian Americans. Though the performance of both subject groups was equally good, the activity of the involved brain areas was significantly different. Non-Asian Americans had a higher activation in the object processing areas in the ventral visual cortex during the object recognition task whereas the East-Asian Americans exhibited higher activity in the left [[Occipital lobe|occipital]] and [[Fusiform gyrus|fusiform]] areas which are associated with perceptual analysis.

{{Political anthropology|Studies}}

'''''Kapu''''' is the ancient [[Hawaii]]an [[code of conduct]] of laws and regulations. The ''kapu'' system was universal in lifestyle, gender roles, politics and religion. An offense that was ''kapu'' was often a capital offense, but also often denoted a threat to spiritual power, or theft of ''[[mana]]''. ''Kapus'' were strictly enforced. Breaking one, even unintentionally, often meant immediate death,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islands.com/article.jsp?ID=47759&amp;typeID=122&amp;categoryID=0 Hawaii: Sacred Hawaii] December 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ko{{okina}}o kapu''. The concept is related to [[taboo]] and the ''[[tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]]'' or ''tabu'' found in other [[Polynesia]]n cultures. The [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] word ''kapu'' is usually translated to English as "forbidden", though it also carries the meanings of "keep out", "no trespassing", "sacred", "consecrated", or "holy".

The opposite of kapu is ''noa'', meaning "common" or "free".

==Kapuhili==
The ''Kapuhili'' were restrictions placed upon contact with chiefs (kings), but these also apply to all people of known spiritual power. ''Kapu Kū mamao'' means prohibited from a place of the chief, while ''Kapu noho'' was to assemble before the chief. It was ''kapu'' when entering a chief's personal area to come in contact with his hair or fingernail clippings, to look directly at him, and to be in sight of him with a head higher than his. Wearing red and yellow feathers (a sign of royalty) was ''kapu'', unless an individual was of the highest rank.  Places that are ''kapu'' are often symbolized by ''Pahu Kapu'', two crossed staffs, each with a white ball atop.

=={{okina}}Ai Kapu==
The ''{{okina}}Ai kapu'' was the ''kapu'' system governing contact between men and women. Many ''ali{{okina}}i'' obtained their power through this system, and then would give thanks to the god of politics [[Kū]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawaiialive.org/realms.php?sub=Wao+Lani&amp;treasure=340&amp;offset=0, Realms: Wao Lani - Ku Hawai'i Alive website] Retrieved on 09 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''{{okina}}Ai'' means "to eat" and ''Kapu'' means sacred. Therefore, it is translated to "sacred eating". It first came about because [[Wākea]] wanted to  marry his daughter, ''Ho{{okina}}ohōkūlani''. To do this, his ''kupuna'' advised him to establish the ''{{okina}}Ai kapu'' which allowed him time away from his wife to be alone with his daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Losche, Tracie. ''Hawaii: Center of the Pacific. 2nd ed.'' (Hawaii: Copely Custom Textbooks, 2008), 60-64&lt;/ref&gt;  In this particular practice, men and women could not eat meals together. Furthermore, certain foods such as [[pork]] (the body form of the god [[Lono]]), most types (67 of the 70 varieties) of [[banana]]s (body form of the god [[Kanaloa]]), and [[coconut]]s (body form of the god [[Kū]]) were considered ''kapu'' to women. In fact, women could not even make coconut rope. [[Taro]] (body form of the god [[Kāne]]) was kapu for women to cook and prepare. Some large fish were also kapu for women to eat. Isabella Abbott, a leading [[ethnobotanist]] of Hawaii theorizes that because of the limited "noa" (free) diet for Hawaiian women, seaweeds were relied upon more heavily for Hawaiians than other Pacific islands.&lt;ref name="Oral Traditions Interview with Isabella Abbott"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oral History Project - Dr. Isabella Abbott|url=http://apps.ksbe.edu/kaiwakiloumoku/kalalaola/documentaries|work=An Oral History Project - Dr. Isabella Abbott|accessdate=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''kapu'' system was used in Hawaii until 1819, when King [[Kamehameha II]], acting with his mother Queen [[Keōpūolani]] and his father's other queen [[Kaʻahumanu]], abolished it by the symbolic act of sharing a meal of forbidden foods with the women of his court. Abolishing the ''{{okina}}ai kapu'' assured political power to the line of Kamehameha rulers as monarchs because it limited the power of the rulers below them. Originally, it was from this political system that the rulers throughout the island would gain rank, power, and prestige.&lt;ref&gt;Kāwika Tengan, Ty P. ''Native Men Remade: Gender and Nation in Contemporary Hawai'i'' (North Carolina: Duke University Press, 2008),  36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage==
The ambiguities in the Polynesian concept (from the English point of view) are reflected in the different senses of the word in different national Englishes: in modern usage in Hawaii, "KAPU" is often substituted for the phrase "No Trespassing" on private property signage. Although kapu can be taken to mean "keep out", kapu has a larger meaning to most residents of Hawaii. By contrast, in [[New Zealand]], the comparable word "tapu" is almost always applied in English as meaning "sacred".

'''Malinchism''' ({{lang-es|malinchismo}}) or '''malinchist''' ({{lang-es|malinchista}}) is a form of attraction that the foreigner has in the popular imagination, causing individuals to lose the spirit of nationality by moving to the other side, a particular case of [[cultural cringe]].&lt;ref&gt;LEMOS, M. T. T. B. (Org.), DANTAS, Alexis Toribio (Org.), ''América: Visões e Versões - Identidades em confronto'', ed. 7 Letras, 1st edn., Rio, 2010, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from the name of [[Hernán Cortés]]'s [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] advisor [[La Malinche]], referring to a deep-rooted Mexican inferiority complex or [[self-hatred]] for the preference for all things foreign to the point of self-destruction.{{sfn|Butler|2004|p=83}} La Malinche is used as a symbol for being supposed to have assisted the Spaniards in destroying Native Americans' way of life, values, norms and culture and exploit the Native American peoples.

"Malinchism" is a pejorative label, expressing disdain for those who are attracted by foreign values, thinking them superior, of better quality and worthy of imitation. In [[Mexico]] and in other countries the term "malinchism" or "malinchist" applies to all those who feel an attraction to foreign cultures and disregard for their own national culture. It also applies to politics, as in [[El Salvador]], in which the leftist political parties call their opponents "malinchist right-wing". The myth of [[Malinche]] and the force of this feeling of disgust crossed the Mexican border, and malinchism came to be applied as a technical term, political, for giving preference to foreign cultures.&lt;ref&gt;LEMOS, M. T. T. B. (Org.), DANTAS, Alexis Toribio (Org.), ''América: Visões e Versões - Identidades em confronto'', ed. 7 Letras, 1st edn., Rio, 2010, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that upper-class consumers in Mexico display malinchism in their preference for American imports, rather than local Mexican brands. As result, American products are sold mostly on the middle class market, and their advertising agencies generally avoid working class and rural areas. They concentrate their efforts on Mexico City, Monterrey, and Guadalajara, which purchase 70 percent of the American imports.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Ueltschy, and John K. Ryans, Jr., "Employing standardized promotion strategies in Mexico: the impact of language and cultural differences," ''International Executive'' (July 1997) 39#4 pp 479+&lt;/ref&gt;

Malinchism is also associated with a societal depiction of women as the source of betrayal and nefarious behavior.&lt;ref name="Schneider (2006)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schneider|first1=Julia Maria|title=Recreating the Image of Women in Mexico:  A Genealogy of Resistance in Mexican Narrative Set During the Revolution|date=2010|volume=Graduate Faculty - Thesis|page=6|url=http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-04142010-170734/unrestricted/schneiderthesis.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717070125/http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-04142010-170734/unrestricted/schneiderthesis.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-07-17|accessdate=16 February 2015|publisher=Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the images of Mexican popular culture, this theme plays out with [[La Malinche|Malinche]] often portrayed as both the deceiver and the deceived. In theatrical productions, she is sometimes portrayed as a victim of conquest, and sometimes the manufacturer of her own destiny; almost always, Malinche is portrayed as [[Guilt (emotion)|guilty]], in a form of [[victim blaming]]. If she was indeed forced to help the conquistadors against her will, it was because she didn't struggle enough; if she was a willing participant, she not only brought her own troubles, but she caused all of her people and her children to suffer.&lt;ref name="Day (2004)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Day|first1=Stuart A.|title=Staging Politics in Mexico: The Road to Neoliberalism|date=2004|publisher=Bucknell University Press|location=Lewisburg [Pa.]|isbn=0-8387-5587-9|pages=125–131|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=wjcglvaWZc8C&amp;lpg|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is represented in art as a figure showing women's [[Instinct#In biology|inborn]] deception and guilt — one who used her sexuality and in so doing betrayed her own unwitting children.&lt;ref name=Lindauer&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lindauer|first1=Margaret A.|title=Devouring Frida: The Art History and Popular Celebrity of Frida Kahlo|date=1999|publisher=Wesleyan Univ.

In ''La Malinche,'' a ballet composed in 1949, by [[José Limón]], Malinche is at first an unwilling victim, then assumes the proud deportment of an aristocrat, and in the end, weighted down by the finery she wears, she gives birth to the [[Mestizo|mixed-race]] child who rejects her.&lt;ref name="Seed (2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seed|first1=edited by Patricia|title=José Limón and La Malinche: The Dancer and the Dance|date=2008|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin|isbn=978-0-292-71735-0|pages=24–29|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=pTsnFcV1V38C&amp;lpg|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In literature, Malinche has been compared to [[Eve#Mother of humanity|Eve]], the temptress who through deception, leads men astray.&lt;ref name="Cypress (1991)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cypess|first1=Sandra Messinger|title=La Malinche in Mexican literature from history to myth|date=1991|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin|isbn=0-292-75131-1|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=vR7UAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His areas of specialization include [[postmodernism]], cultural and literary theory; the history of [[Russian literature]]  (particularly Pushkin, Gogol, Dostoevsky, Platonov and 20th century poetry) and intellectual history; contemporary philosophical and religious thought;  new methods and interdisciplinary approaches in the humanities; semiotics, language evolution and neologisms; and ideas and electronic media. Professor Epstein is also an expert on Russian philosophy of the 19th and 20th century and on thinkers like [[Nikolai Berdyaev]]. He writes essays on cultural, social, ethical and international issues.

==Biography==
Epstein was born in [[Moscow]], of [[Jew]]ish heritage. He graduated from the philological faculty of Moscow State University in 1972. He was a member of Soviet Writers Union since 1978 and the founder and director of the Laboratory of Contemporary Culture in Moscow (1988–89).

He moved to the USA in 1990 and was fellow of Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars ([[Washington D.C.]]) in 1990–1991. He joined Emory faculty in 1990. In 1992–1994 he received grant from National Council for Soviet and East European Research to work on the history of Russian thought of the late Soviet period. He has authored InteLnet (Intellectual network, 1995) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emory.edu/INTELNET/intelnet2.html inteLnet]&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of other interdisciplinary web sites in the humanities.

One of his major continuing  projects is "On the Future of the Humanities: Paradigmatic Shifts and Emerging Concepts" on which he worked as an inaugural senior fellow at the Center for Humanistic Inquiry (Emory University, 2002–03)and as a fellow at the Institute of Advanced Study at Durham University (2011). He had visiting professor appointments at Wesleyan University (1990) and University of Oregon at  Eugene (2002).

Mikhail Epstein has won national and international prizes, including Andrei Bely prize ([[St. Petersburg]], 1991); The Social Innovations Award 1995 from the Institute for Social Inventions (London) for his electronic Bank of New Ideas; the International Essay Contest set up by [[Lettre International]] and Weimar – Cultural City of Europe 1999; and Liberty Prize, awarded for his outstanding contribution in the development of Russian-American cultural connections (New York, 2000).

Epstein maintains blogs on "Facebook", "Snob" and "Live Journal" networks, where, in particular, since 2007 he conducts and reports "СЛОВО ГОДА" – a [[Word of the year (Russia)|Russian-language "Word of the Year"]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://snob.ru/profile/27356/blog/101993 "СЛОВО ГОДА-2015. ИТОГИ ВЫБОРОВ" ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideas and Terms==

In the realm of [[aesthetics]], Epstein (together with poet and conceptual artist [[Dmitry Prigov]]) is credited with introducing the concept of "[[new sincerity]]" (''novaia iskrennost'') as a response to the dominant sense of absurdity in late [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[post-Soviet]] culture.&lt;ref name="Yurchak"&gt;[[Alexei Yurchak]], "Post-Post-Communist Sincerity: Pioneers, Cosmonauts, and Other Soviet Heroes Born Today," in Thomas Lahusen and Peter H. Solomon, eds., ''What Is Soviet Now?: Identities, Legacies, Memories'' (LIT Verlag Berlin-Hamburg-Münster, 2008), {{ISBN|978-3-8258-0640-8}}, p.258-59, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3GonhERyzwEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA258,M1 excerpt] available at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; In Epstein's words, "Postconceptualism, or the New Sincerity, is an experiment in resuscitating "fallen," dead languages with a renewed pathos of love, sentimentality and enthusiasm."&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail Epstein, "A Catalogue of New Poetries," in Mikhail Epstein, Aleksandr Genis, Slobodanka Vladiv-Glover, eds., ''Russian Postmodernism: New Perspectives on Post-Soviet Culture'' (Berghahn Books, 1999), {{ISBN|978-1-57181-098-4}}, p. 146, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5qjzj3JwaoIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA146,M1 excerpt] available at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In his exploration of contemporary spirituality, Epstein focuses on the concept of "post-atheism," or "minimal [or poor] religion," discussed in particular in his correspondence with the Protestant thinker Thomas Altizer and extensively examined in Charles Taylor's book "The Secular Age" (2007) that refers to Epstein's innovative work.

Mikhail Epstein has coined a number of new concepts and terms (in English and in Russian) that now circulate on tens of thousands of websites in various branches of the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Epstein|first=Mikhail|title=The Transformative Humanities: A Manifesto|year=2012|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4411-6094-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4421">{{Generations Sidebar}}
The '''Missionary Generation''' was the name given by [[sociology|sociologists]] to describe  the [[generation]] of people born in the United States from 1860 to 1882.  It is an identified cohort within the [[Strauss–Howe generational theory]].[[File:Pre-election suffrage parade NYC.jpg|thumb|250px|Suffragists marching in New York, 1915. Social Crusades were a defining feature.]]

==Characteristics==
Members of the Missionary Generation have been described as the "home-and-hearth children of the post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] era". They were an idealist generation and as young adults, their leaders were the first graduates of newly formed black and women's colleges.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

They rejected the strict [[Victorian era|Victorian]] values, questioned gender roles and feared society would become soulless, inhumane, and money-driven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://socalledmillennial.com/generational-cycles/  Generational Cycles] at so-called Millennials.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their defining characteristics were missionary and social crusades, "[[Muckraker|muckrake]]" [[journalism]], [[prohibitionism]], [[Labor rights|workers' rights]], [[trade union]]ism and [[universal suffrage|women's suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://socalledmillennial.com/generational-cycles/ Generational Cycles].&lt;/ref&gt; In midlife, they developed [[Prohibition in the United States]], [[immigration control]], and organized [[Vice#Vice squad|vice squads]].

Because the [[Lost Generation]] were so decimated by [[World War I]], the leadership of the Missionary Generation lasted longer than previous generations and in the 1930s and 1940s, their elite became the "Wise Old Men" who enacted a "[[New Deal]]", [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], led the global war against [[fascism]], and reaffirmed America's highest ideals during a transformative era in world history.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

This generation is fully ancestral, with the last known member of the Missionary Generation, the American [[Sarah Knauss]], having died on December 30, 1999 at 119 years of age.

Sociologist [[Naomi Schaefer Riley]] believes that a new "Missionary Generation" is forming in the children of the 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Jacobsen, Rhonda Jacobsen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BlrD54cE_1wC&amp;pg=PT111&amp;lpg=PT111&amp;dq=missionary+generation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mHLEgXrFhW&amp;sig=ZTiQgKRLue_R_u2TI0h3QmzCRvk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Sr0cVK7gCpfY8gXr_oDABw&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=missionary%20generation&amp;f=false  The American University in a Postsecular Age] ([[Oxford University Press]], 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Music''' is an art form and [[culture|cultural]] activity whose medium is sound organized in time. In general [[definitions of music]] will include common elements such as [[pitch (music)|pitch]] (which governs [[melody]] and [[harmony]]), [[rhythm]] (and its associated concepts [[tempo]], [[meter (music)|meter]], and [[articulation (music)|articulation]]), [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]] (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of [[timbre]] and [[texture (music)|texture]] (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different [[Music genre|styles or types]] of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of [[musical instrument|instruments]] and vocal techniques ranging from singing to [[rapping]]; there are solely [[Instrumental music|instrumental pieces]], [[a capella|solely vocal pieces]] (such as songs without instrumental [[accompaniment]]) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:μουσική#Ancient Greek|μουσική]] (''mousike''; "art of the [[Muse]]s").&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2368891 |title=Mousike, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', at Perseus |publisher=perseus.tufts.edu |accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
See [[glossary of musical terminology]].

In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form or [[Culture|cultural]] activity include the creation of works of music ([[song]]s, tunes, [[symphony|symphonies]], and so on), the [[Music criticism|criticism of music]], the [[Musicology|study of the history of music]], and the [[Aesthetics of music|aesthetic examination of music]]. [[Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek]] and [[Ancient philosophy#Ancient Indian philosophers|Indian philosophers]] defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as "the [[harmony of the spheres]]" and "it is music to my ears" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer [[John Cage]] thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, "There is no [[noise]], only sound."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE1DB1E3BF930A2575BC0A964958260 |title=John Cage, 79, a Minimalist Enchanted With Sound, Dies |last=Kozinn |first=Allen |authorlink=Allan Kozinn |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=13 August 1992 |accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context. Indeed, throughout history, some new forms or styles of music have been criticized as "not being music", including [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Grosse Fuge]]'' [[string quartet]] in 1825,&lt;ref&gt;Watson 2009, 109–10.&lt;/ref&gt; early [[jazz]] in the beginning of the 1900s&lt;ref&gt;Reiland Rabaka. ''Hip Hop's Amnesia: From Blues and the Black Women's Club Movement to Rap and the [[Hip Hop Movement]]''. Lexington Books, 2012. p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hardcore punk]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Manabe, Noriko. ''The Revolution Will Not Be Televised: Protest Music After Fukushima''. Oxford University Press, 2015. p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many types of music, including [[popular music]], [[traditional music]], [[art music]], [[Liturgical music|music written for religious ceremonies]] and [[work song]]s such as [[chantey]]s. Music ranges from strictly organized compositions–such as Classical music symphonies from the 1700s and 1800s, through to spontaneously played [[Musical improvisation|improvisational music]] such as [[jazz]], and [[avant-garde]] styles of [[aleatory|chance-based]] [[contemporary music]] from the 20th and 21st centuries.

Music can be divided into [[music genre|genres]] (e.g., [[country music]]) and genres can be further divided into [[subgenre]]s (e.g., [[country blues]] and [[pop country]] are two of the many country subgenres), although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to personal interpretation, and occasionally controversial. For example, it can be hard to draw the line between some early 1980s [[hard rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. Within [[the arts]], music may be classified as a [[performing arts|performing art]], a fine art or as an auditory art. Music may be played or sung and heard live at a [[rock concert]] or orchestra performance, heard live as part of a [[theatre music|dramatic work]] (a [[music theater]] show or opera), or it may be recorded and listened to on a radio, MP3 player, [[CD player]], [[smartphone]] or as [[film score]] or TV show.

In many cultures, music is an important part of people's way of life, as it plays a key role in  [[religious ritual]]s, [[rite of passage]] ceremonies (e.g., graduation and marriage), social activities (e.g., [[dance club|dancing]]) and cultural activities ranging from amateur [[karaoke]] singing to playing in an amateur [[Funk|funk band]] or singing in a community [[choir]]. People may make music as a hobby, like a teen playing cello in a [[youth orchestra]], or work as a professional musician or singer. The [[music industry]] includes the individuals who create new songs and musical pieces (such as songwriters and composers), individuals who perform music (which include orchestra, [[jazz]] band and rock band musicians, singers and conductors), individuals who record music (music producers and [[sound engineer]]s), individuals who organize concert tours, and individuals who sell recordings and [[sheet music]] and scores to customers.

==Etymology==
[[File:Muses sarcophagus Louvre MR880.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|In [[Greek mythology]], the nine [[Muse]]s were the inspiration for many creative endeavors, including [[the arts]].]]
The word derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:μουσική#Ancient Greek|μουσική]] (''mousike''; "art of the [[Muses]]").&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"/&gt; In [[Greek mythology]], the nine [[Muse]]s were the goddesses who inspired literature, science, and [[the arts]] and who were the source of the knowledge embodied in the poetry, song-lyrics, and myths in the Greek culture. According to the ''Online Etymological Dictionary'', the term "music" is derived from "mid-13c., musike, from [[Old French]] ''musique'' (12c.) and directly from [[Latin]] ''musica'' "the art of music," also including poetry (also [the] source of Spanish ''musica'', Italian ''musica'', [[Old High German]] ''mosica'', German ''Musik'', Dutch ''muziek'', Danish ''musik'')." This is derived from the "...Greek ''mousike (techne)'' "(art) of the Muses," from fem. of mousikos "pertaining to the Muses," from Mousa "Muse" (see muse (n.)). Modern spelling [dates] from [the] 1630s. In [[classical Greece]], [the term "music" refers to] any art in which the Muses presided, but especially music and [[lyric poetry]]."&lt;ref name="etymonline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=music |title=music |publisher=Douglas Harper |website=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a form of art or entertainment==
[[File:Photo récital 028.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|{{Interlanguage link multi|Jean-Gabriel Ferlan|fr}} performing at a 2008 concert at the collège-lycée Saint-François Xavier]]
Music is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, or as an entertainment product for the marketplace. When music was only available through [[sheet music]] scores, such as during the Classical and Romantic eras, music lovers would buy the [[sheet music]] of their favourite pieces and songs so that they could perform them at home on the piano. With the advent of sound recording, records of popular songs, rather than sheet music became the dominant way that music lovers would enjoy their favourite songs. With the advent of home [[tape recorder]]s in the 1980s and [[digital music]] in the 1990s, music lovers could make tapes or [[playlist]]s of their favourite songs and take them with them on a [[Cassette player|portable cassette player]] or MP3 player. Some music lovers create [[mix tape]]s of their favorite songs, which serve as a "self-portrait, a gesture of friendship, prescription for an ideal party... [and] an environment consisting solely of what is most ardently loved."&lt;ref&gt;Kirszner, Laurie G. (January 2012). ''Patterns for College Writing''. Bedford/St. Martin's. p. 520. {{ISBN|978-0-312-67684-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amateur musicians can compose or perform music for their own pleasure, and derive their income elsewhere. [[Professional musician]]s are employed by a range of institutions and organisations, including armed forces (in [[marching band]]s, [[concert band]]s and popular music groups), churches and synagogues, symphony orchestras, broadcasting or [[filmmaking|film production]] companies, and [[music school]]s. Professional musicians sometimes work as freelancers or [[session musician]]s, seeking contracts and engagements in a variety of settings. There are often many links between amateur and professional musicians. Beginning amateur musicians take [[music lesson|lessons]] with professional musicians. In community settings, advanced amateur musicians perform with professional musicians in a variety of ensembles such as community [[concert band]]s and community orchestras.

A distinction is often made between music performed for a live audience and music that is performed in a studio so that it can be recorded and distributed through the music retail system or the broadcasting system. However, there are also many cases where a live performance in front of an audience is also recorded and distributed. Live concert recordings are popular in both classical music and in [[popular music]] forms such as rock, where [[Bootleg recording|illegally taped live concerts]] are prized by music lovers. In the [[jam band]] scene, live, improvised [[jam session]]s are preferred to studio recordings.

===Composition===
{{Main|Musical composition}}
[[File:Coffee and synths. KayoDot album "Hubardo" recording, 2013-06-13.jpg|thumb|People composing music in 2013 using [[electronic keyboard]]s and computers.]]
[[File:Michel Richard Delalande engraving BNF Gallica.jpg|thumb|French [[Baroque music]] composer [[Michel Richard Delalande]] (1657–1726), pen in hand.]]
"Composition" is the act or practice of creating a song, an [[instrumental music]] piece, a work with both singing and instruments, or another type of music. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing also includes the creation of [[music notation]], such as a [[sheet music|sheet music "score"]], which is then performed by the composer or by other singers or musicians. In popular music and traditional music, the act of composing, which is typically called songwriting, may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the [[lead sheet]], which sets out the [[melody]], [[lyrics]] and [[chord progression]]. In classical music, the composer typically [[orchestration|orchestrates]] his or her own compositions, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a songwriter may not use notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written scores play in classical music.

Even when music is notated relatively precisely, as in classical music, there are many decisions that a performer has to make, because notation does not specify all of the elements of music precisely. The process of deciding how to perform music that has been previously composed and notated is termed "interpretation". Different performers' interpretations of the same work of music can vary widely, in terms of the tempos that are chosen and the playing or singing style or [[musical phrasing|phrasing]] of the melodies. Composers and songwriters who present their own music are interpreting their songs, just as much as those who perform the music of others. The standard body of choices and techniques present at a given time and a given place is referred to as [[Historically informed performance|performance practice]], whereas interpretation is generally used to mean the individual choices of a performer.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Although a musical composition often uses [[musical notation]] and has a single author, this is not always the case. A work of music can have multiple composers, which often occurs in [[popular music]] when a band collaborates to write a song, or in musical theatre, when one person writes the melodies, a second person writes the lyrics, and a third person orchestrates the songs. In some styles of music, such as the [[blues]], a composer/songwriter may create, perform and record new songs or pieces without ever writing them down in music notation. A piece of music can also be composed with words, images, or computer programs that explain or notate how the singer or musician should create musical sounds. Examples range from avant-garde music that uses [[graphic notation (music)|graphic notation]], to text compositions such as ''[[Aus den sieben Tagen]]'', to computer programs that select sounds for musical pieces. Music that makes heavy use of randomness and chance is called [[aleatoric music]], and is associated with contemporary composers active in the 20th century, such as [[John Cage]], [[Morton Feldman]], and [[Witold Lutosławski]]. A more commonly known example of chance-based music is the sound of [[wind chimes]] jingling in a breeze.

The study of composition has traditionally been dominated by examination of methods and practice of Western classical music, but the definition of composition is broad enough to include the creation of [[popular music]] and [[traditional music]] songs and instrumental pieces as well as spontaneously [[Music improvisation|improvised]] works like those of [[free jazz]] performers and African percussionists such as [[Ewe drumming|Ewe drummers]].

===Notation===
{{Main|Musical notation}}
[[File:Adeste Fideles sheet music sample.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Sheet music is written representation of music. This is a [[homorhythm]]ic (i.e., [[hymn]]-style) arrangement of a traditional piece entitled "[[Adeste Fideles]]", in standard two-staff format for mixed voices. {{audio|Adeste Fideles sheet music sample.mid|Play}}]]
In the 2000s, music notation typically means the written expression of music notes and rhythms on paper using symbols. When music is written down, the pitches and rhythm of the music, such as the notes of a [[melody]], are notated. Music notation also often provides instructions on how to perform the music. For example, the sheet music for a song may state that the song is a "slow blues" or a "fast swing", which indicates the tempo and the genre.  To read music notation, a person must have an understanding of [[music theory]], [[harmony]] and the [[performance practice]] associated with a particular song or piece's genre.

Written notation varies with style and period of music. In the 2000s, notated music is produced as [[sheet music]] or, for individuals with computer [[scorewriter]] programs, as an image on a [[computer screen]]. In ancient times, music notation was put onto stone or clay tablets. To perform music from notation, a singer or instrumentalist requires an understanding of the rhythmic and pitch elements embodied in the symbols and the performance practice that is associated with a piece of music or a genre. In genres requiring [[musical improvisation]], the performer often plays from music where only the [[Chord progression|chord changes]] and form of the song are written, requiring the performer to have a great understanding of the music's structure, harmony and the styles of a particular genre (e.g., [[jazz]] or [[country music]]).

In Western art music, the most common types of written notation are scores, which include all the music parts of an ensemble piece, and parts, which are the music notation for the individual performers or singers. In popular music, jazz, and blues, the standard musical notation is the [[lead sheet]], which notates the melody, chords, [[lyrics]] (if it is a vocal piece), and structure of the music. [[Fake book]]s are also used in jazz; they may consist of lead sheets or simply chord charts, which permit [[rhythm section]] members to improvise an [[accompaniment]] part to jazz songs. Scores and parts are also used in popular music and jazz, particularly in large ensembles such as jazz "[[big band]]s." In popular music, guitarists and electric bass players often read music notated in [[tablature]] (often abbreviated as "tab"), which indicates the location of the notes to be played on the instrument using a diagram of the guitar or bass fingerboard. Tabulature was also used in the Baroque era to notate music for the [[lute]], a stringed, fretted instrument.

===Improvisation===
{{Main|Musical improvisation}}
[[Musical improvisation]] is the creation of spontaneous music, often within (or based on) a pre-existing harmonic framework or chord progression. Improvisation is the act of instantaneous composition by performers, where compositional techniques are employed with or without preparation. Improvisation is a major part of some types of music, such as [[blues]], [[jazz]], and [[jazz fusion]], in which instrumental performers improvise solos, melody lines and accompaniment parts. In the Western art music tradition, improvisation was an important skill during the Baroque era and during the Classical era. In the Baroque era, performers improvised ornaments and [[basso continuo]] keyboard players improvised [[chord voicing]]s based on [[figured bass]] notation. In the Classical era, solo performers and singers improvised virtuoso [[cadenza]]s during concerts. However, in the 20th and early 21st century, as "common practice" Western [[art music]] performance became institutionalized in symphony orchestras, opera houses and ballets, improvisation has played a smaller role. At the same time, some modern composers have increasingly included improvisation in their creative work. In [[Indian classical music]], improvisation is a core component and an essential criterion of performances.

===Theory===
{{Main|Music theory}}
Music theory encompasses the nature and mechanics of music. It often involves identifying patterns that govern composers' techniques and examining the [[language]] and [[Musical notation|notation]] of music. In a grand sense, music theory distills and analyzes the [[parameter (music)|parameters]] or elements of music – rhythm, [[harmony]] ([[Diatonic function|harmonic function]]), [[melody]], structure, [[Musical form|form]], and [[Texture (music)|texture]]. Broadly, music theory may include any statement, belief, or conception of or about music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boretz |first=Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Boretz |title=Meta-Variations: studies in the foundations of musical thought… |publisher=Open Space |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who study these properties are known as music theorists. Some have applied [[acoustics]], [[human physiology]], and [[psychology]] to the explanation of how and why music is [[perceive]]d.

==Elements==
{{main|Aspect of music}}
Music has many different fundamentals or elements. Depending on the definition of "element" being used, these can include: pitch, beat or pulse, tempo, rhythm, melody, harmony, texture, style, allocation of voices, timbre or color, dynamics, expression, articulation, form and structure. The elements of music feature prominently in the music curriculums of Australia, UK and US. All three curriculums identify pitch, dynamics, timbre and texture as elements, but the other identified elements of music are far from universally agreed. Below is a list of the three official versions of the "elements of music":
* Australia: pitch, timbre, texture, dynamics and expression, rhythm, form and structure.&lt;ref&gt;ACARA. (2015). Music glossary.  v7.5.

In relation to the UK curriculum, in 2013 the term: "appropriate [[musical notation]]s" was added to their list of elements and the title of the list was changed from the "elements of music" to the "inter-related dimensions of music". The inter-related dimensions of music are listed as: pitch, duration, dynamics, tempo, timbre, texture, structure and appropriate musical notations.&lt;ref&gt;Gov.uk. (2013). ''National curriculum in England: music programmes of study''. Retrieved 6 January 2016, from https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-music-programmes-of-study&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "the elements of music" is used in a number of different contexts. The two most common contexts can be differentiated by describing them as the "rudimentary elements of music" and the "perceptual elements of music".

===Rudimentary elements===
In the 1800s, the phrases "the elements of music" and "the rudiments of music" were used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;Clementi, M. (1974). Introduction to the art of playing on the piano forte: Da Capo Pr. Cohen, D., &amp; Dubnov, S. (1997). [[Gestalt phenomena]] in musical texture: Springer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niecks, F. (1884). A concise dictionary of musical terms. The Musical Times and Singing Class Circular, 25(498), 473. doi: 10.2307/3357513&lt;/ref&gt;  The elements described in these documents refer to aspects of music that are needed in order to become a musician, Recent writers such as Estrella &lt;ref&gt;Estrella, E. (2015). The Elements of music. Retrieved 15 Jan. 2015, 2015, from http://musiced.about.com/od/beginnerstheory/a/musicelements.htm&lt;/ref&gt; seem to be using the phrase "elements of music" in a similar manner. A definition which most accurately reflects this usage is: "the rudimentary principles of an art, science, etc.: the elements of grammar."&lt;ref&gt;Element. (n.d.). In Dictionary.com unabridged.   Retrieved 10 Jun 2015, from  http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/element&lt;/ref&gt; The UK's curriculum switch to the "inter-related dimensions of music" seems to be a move back to using the rudimentary elements of music.

===Perceptual elements===
Since the emergence of the study of [[psychoacoustics]] in the 1930s, most lists of elements of music have related more to how we ''hear'' music than how we learn to play it or study it. C.E. Seashore, in his book ''Psychology of Music'',&lt;ref&gt;Seashore, C. E. (1938). ''Psychology of music'': New York: Dover Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; identified four "psychological attributes of sound". These were: "pitch, loudness, time, and timbre" (p.&amp;nbsp;3). He did not call them the "elements of music" but referred to them as "elemental components" (p.&amp;nbsp;2). Nonetheless these elemental components link precisely with four of the most common musical elements: "Pitch" and "timbre" match exactly, "loudness" links with dynamics and "time" links with the time-based elements of rhythm, duration and tempo. This usage of the phrase "the elements of music" links more closely with ''Webster's New 20th Century Dictionary'' definition of an element as: "a substance which cannot be divided into a simpler form by known methods"&lt;ref&gt;Webster, N. (Ed.) (1947) Webster's New Twentieth Century Dictionary. Clevelend Ohio: The World Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; and educational institutions' lists of elements generally align with this definition as well.

Although writers of lists of "rudimentary elements of music" can vary their lists depending on their personal (or institutional) priorities, the perceptual elements of music should consist of an established (or proven) list of discrete elements which can be independently manipulated to achieve an intended musical effect. It seems at this stage that there is still research to be done in this area.

===Analysis of styles===
[[File:George Clinton 2006.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Funk]] places most of its emphasis on rhythm and [[groove (music)|groove]], with entire songs based around a [[ostinato#Vamp|vamp]] on a single chord. Pictured are the influential funk musicians [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Parliament Funkadelic]] in 2006.]]
Some styles of music place an emphasis on certain of these fundamentals, while others place less emphasis on certain elements. To give one example, while [[Bebop]]-era [[jazz]] makes use of very complex chords, including [[altered dominant]]s and challenging [[chord progression]]s, with chords changing two or more times per bar and keys changing several times in a tune, [[funk]] places most of its emphasis on rhythm and [[groove (music)|groove]], with entire songs based around a [[ostinato#Vamp|vamp]] on a single chord. While Romantic era classical music from the mid- to late-1800s makes great use of dramatic changes of dynamics, from whispering pianissimo sections to thunderous fortissimo sections, some entire Baroque dance suites for [[harpsichord]] from the early 1700s may use a single dynamic. To give another example, while some [[art music]] pieces, such as [[symphony|symphonies]] are very long, some pop songs are just a few minutes long.

===Description of elements===

====Pitch and melody====
[[Pitch (music)|Pitch]] is an aspect of a sound that we can hear, reflecting whether one musical sound, note or tone is "higher" or "lower" than another musical sound, note or tone. We can talk about the highness or lowness of pitch in the more general sense, such as the way a listener hears a piercingly high [[piccolo]] note or [[whistling]] tone as higher in pitch than a deep thump of a [[bass drum]]. We also talk about pitch in the precise sense associated with musical [[melody|melodies]], [[bassline]]s and [[chord (music)|chords]]. Precise pitch can only be determined in sounds that have a frequency that is clear and stable enough to distinguish from noise. For example, it is much easier for listeners to discern the pitch of a single note played on a piano  than to try to discern the pitch of a [[crash cymbal]] that is struck.
[[File:Popgoesweasel.jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|The melody to the traditional song "[[Pop Goes the Weasel]]"  {{audio|Pop Goes the Weasel.ogg|Play}}]]

A [[melody]] (also called a "tune") is a series of pitches (notes) sounding in succession (one after the other), often in a rising and falling pattern. The notes of a melody are typically created using pitch systems such as [[Musical scale|scales]] or [[Musical mode|modes]]. Melodies also often contain notes from the chords used in the song. The melodies in simple folk songs and traditional songs may use only the notes of a single scale, the scale associated with the tonic note or [[key (music)|key]] of a given song. For example, a folk song in the key of C (also referred to as C major) may have a melody that uses only the notes of the C major scale (the individual notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B and C; these are the "[[white notes]]" on a piano keyboard. On the other hand, [[Bebop]]-era jazz from the 1940s and [[contemporary music]] from the 20th and 21st centuries may use melodies with many [[chromatic note]]s (i.e., notes in addition to the notes of the major scale; on a piano, a chromatic scale would include all the notes on the keyboard, including the "white notes" and "black notes" and unusual scales, such as the [[whole tone scale]] (a whole tone scale in the key of C would contain the notes C, D, E, F{{music|sharp}}, G{{music|sharp}} and A{{music|sharp}}). A low, deep musical line played by bass instruments such as double bass, electric bass or [[tuba]] is called a [[bassline]].

====Harmony and chords====
[[File:Sol7 accordo chitarra G7 guitar chord.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|When musicians play three or more different [[Musical note|notes]] at the same time, this creates a [[Chord (music)|chord]]. In [[Western culture#Music|Western music]], including classical music, pop music, rock music and many related styles, the most common chords are [[triad (music)|triads]]– three notes usually played at the same time. The most commonly used chords are the [[major chord]] and the [[minor chord]]. An example of a major chord is the three pitches C, E and G. An example of a minor chord is the three pitches A, C and E. (Pictured is a [[guitar player]] performing a chord on a guitar).]]
[[Harmony]] refers to the "vertical" sounds of pitches in music, which means pitches that are played or sung together at the same time to create a [[chord (music)|chord]]. Usually this means the notes are played at the same time, although harmony may also be implied by a melody that outlines a harmonic structure (i.e., by using melody notes that are played one after the other, outlining the notes of a chord). In music written using the system of major-minor [[tonality]] ("keys"), which includes most classical music written from 1600 to 1900 and most Western pop, rock and traditional music, the key of a piece determines the scale used, which centres around the "home note" or [[tonic (music)|tonic]] of the key. Simple classical pieces and many pop and traditional music songs are written so that all the music is in a single key. More complex Classical, pop and traditional music songs and pieces may have two keys (and in some cases three or more keys). Classical music from the Romantic era (written from about 1820–1900) often contains multiple keys, as does [[jazz]], especially [[Bebop]] jazz from the 1940s, in which the key or "home note" of a song may change every four bars or even every two bars.

====Rhythm====
Rhythm is the arrangement of sounds and silences in time. [[Metre (music)|Meter]] animates time in regular pulse groupings, called [[Bar (music)|measures or bars]], which in Western classical, popular and traditional music often group notes in sets of two (e.g., 2/4 time), three (e.g., 3/4 time, also known as [[Waltz]] time, or 3/8 time), or four (e.g., 4/4 time). Meters are made easier to hear because songs and pieces often (but not always) place an emphasis on the first beat of each grouping. Notable exceptions exist, such as the [[backbeat]] used in much Western pop and rock, in which a song that uses a measure that consists of four beats (called 4/4 time or [[common time]]) will have accents on beats two and four, which are typically performed by the drummer on the [[snare drum]], a loud and distinctive-sounding percussion instrument. In pop and rock, the rhythm parts of a song are played by the [[rhythm section]], which includes chord-playing instruments (e.g., electric guitar, acoustic guitar, piano, or other keyboard instruments), a bass instrument (typically electric bass or for some styles such as [[jazz]] and [[bluegrass (music)|bluegrass]], double bass) and a drum kit player.

====Texture====
[[Musical texture]] is the overall sound of a piece of music or song.  The texture of a piece or sing is determined by how the melodic, rhythmic, and harmonic materials are combined in a composition, thus determining the overall nature of the sound in a piece. Texture is often described in regard to the density, or thickness, and range, or width, between lowest and highest pitches, in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices, or parts, and the relationship between these voices (see common types below). For example, a thick texture contains many 'layers' of instruments. One of these layers could be a string section, or another brass. The thickness also is affected by the amount and the richness of the instruments. Texture is commonly described according to the number of and relationship between [[part (music)|parts]] or lines of music:
* [[monophony]]: a single [[melody]] (or "tune") with neither instrumental [[accompaniment]] nor a [[harmony part]]. A mother singing a [[lullaby]] to her baby would be an example.
* [[heterophony]]: two or more instruments or singers playing/singing the same melody, but with each performer slightly varying the rhythm or speed of the melody or adding different [[ornament (music)|ornaments]] to the melody. Two [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] [[fiddler]]s playing the same [[traditional music|traditional]] fiddle tune together will typically each vary the melody a bit and each add different ornaments.
* [[polyphony]]: multiple independent melody lines that interweave together, which are sung or played at the same time. [[Choir|Choral]] music written in the [[Renaissance music]] era was typically written in this style. A [[round (music)|round]], which is a song such as "[[Row, Row, Row Your Boat]]", which different groups of singers all start to sing at a different time, is a simple example of polyphony.
* [[homophony]]: a clear melody supported by [[chord (music)|chordal]] [[accompaniment]]. Most Western [[popular music]] songs from the 19th century onward are written in this texture.

Music that contains a large number of independent [[Part (music)|parts]] (e.g., a double concerto accompanied by 100 orchestral instruments with many interweaving melodic lines) is generally said to have a "thicker" or "denser" texture than a work with few parts (e.g., a solo [[flute]] melody accompanied by a single cello).

====Timbre or "tone color"====
Timbre, sometimes called "color" or "tone color" is the quality or sound of a voice or instrument.&lt;ref&gt;Harnsberger, Lindsey. "Articulation." ''Essential Dictionary of Music''. Alfred Publishing Co., Inc. Los Angeles, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; Timbre is what makes a particular musical sound different from another, even when they have the same pitch and loudness. For example, a 440&amp;nbsp;Hz A note sounds different when it is played on [[oboe]], piano, violin or electric guitar. Even if different players of the same instrument play the same note, their notes might sound different due to differences in instrumental technique (e.g., different [[embouchure]]s), different types of accessories (e.g., mouthpieces for brass players, reeds for oboe and bassoon players) or strings made out of different materials for string players (e.g., [[gut string]]s versus [[steel strings]]). Even two instrumentalists playing the same note on the same instrument (one after the other) may sound different due to different ways of playing the instrument (e.g., two string players might hold the bow differently).

The physical characteristics of sound that determine the perception of timbre include the [[spectrum]], [[envelope (waves)|envelope]] and [[overtone]]s of a note or musical sound. For [[music technology (electric)|electric]] instruments developed in the 20th century, such as electric guitar, electric bass and [[electric piano]], the performer can also change the tone by adjusting [[Graphic equalizer|equalizer controls]], tone controls on the instrument, and by using [[effects unit|electronic effects units]] such as [[distortion (music)|distortion]] pedals. The tone of the electric [[Hammond organ]] is controlled by adjusting [[Hammond organ#Drawbars|drawbars]].

====Expression====
[[File:20110921-FSIS-RBN-6084 - Flickr - USDAgov.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Singers add expression to the melodies they sing using many methods, including changing the tone of their singing, adding [[vibrato]] to certain notes, and emphasizing important words in the lyrics.]]
Expressive qualities are those elements in music that create change in music without changing the main pitches or substantially changing the rhythms of the melody and its accompaniment. Performers, including singers and instrumentalists, can add musical expression to a song or piece by adding [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], by adding effects such as [[vibrato]] (with voice and some instruments, such as guitar, violin, brass instruments and woodwinds), dynamics (the loudness or softness of piece or a section of it), tempo fluctuations (e.g., [[ritardando]] or [[Tempo|accelerando]], which are, respectively slowing down and speeding up the tempo), by adding pauses or [[fermata]]s on a [[cadence (music)|cadence]], and by changing the articulation of the notes (e.g., making notes more pronounced or accented, by making notes more [[legato]], which means smoothly connected, or by making notes shorter).

Expression is achieved through the manipulation of pitch (such as inflection, vibrato, slides etc.), volume (dynamics, accent, tremolo etc.), duration (tempo fluctuations, rhythmic changes, changing note duration such as with legato and staccato,  etc.), timbre (e.g. changing vocal timbre from a light to a resonant voice) and sometimes even texture (e.g. doubling the bass note for a richer effect in a piano piece). Expression therefore can be seen as a manipulation of all elements in order to convey "an indication of mood, spirit, character etc." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=the definition of expression |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/expression |website=Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.com |accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such cannot be included as a unique perceptual element of music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Burton |first1=Russell |title=The elements of music: What are they, and who cares? |journal=Educating for Life. ASME XXth National Conference Proceeding. Australian Society for Music Education. |date=2015 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it can be considered an important rudimentary element of music.

From the 1960s onward, Western pop and rock songs are often in [[verse-chorus form]], which is based around a sequence of [[verse (popular music)|verse]] and [[chorus (song)|chorus]] ("refrain") sections, with new [[lyrics]] for most verses and repeating lyrics for the choruses. Popular music often makes use of [[strophic form]], sometimes in conjunction with the [[twelve bar blues]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In the tenth edition of ''[[The Oxford Companion to Music]]'', [[Percy Scholes]] defines musical form as "a series of strategies designed to find a successful mean between the opposite extremes of unrelieved repetition and unrelieved alteration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scholes |first=Percy A. |authorlink1=Percy Scholes |title=The Oxford Companion to Music |edition=10 |year=1977 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location= |isbn= |chapter=Form |ref=CITEREFScholes1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of common forms of Western music include the [[fugue]], the [[Invention (musical composition)|invention]], [[Sonata form|sonata-allegro]], [[Canon (music)|canon]], [[strophic]], [[theme and variations]], and [[rondo]].
Scholes states that European classical music had only six stand-alone forms: simple binary, simple ternary, compound binary, rondo, air with variations, and [[fugue]] (although musicologist [[Alfred Mann (musicologist)|Alfred Mann]] emphasized that the fugue is primarily a method of composition that has sometimes taken on certain structural conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Alfred |title=The Study of Fugue |year=1958 |publisher=W.W.Norton and Co. Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Where a piece cannot readily be broken down into sectional units (though it might borrow some form from a poem, story or [[Programme music|programme]]), it is said to be [[through-composed]]. Such is often the case with a [[Fantasia (music)|fantasia]], [[Prelude (music)|prelude]], [[Rhapsody (music)|rhapsody]], [[etude]] (or study), [[symphonic poem]], [[Bagatelle (music)|Bagatelle]], [[impromptu]], etc.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Professor Charles Keil classified forms and formal detail as "sectional, developmental, or variational."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Keil |first=Charles |title=Urban blues |year=1966 |isbn=978-0-226-42960-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Sectional form
This form is built from a sequence of clear-cut units&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wennerstrom |first=Mary |editor=Wittlich, Gary |title=Aspects of Twentieth-Century Music |year=1975 |publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey |isbn=978-0-13-049346-0 |chapter=Form in Twentieth Century Music |ref=CITEREFDeLone1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; that may be referred to by letters but also often have generic names such as [[Introduction (music)|introduction]] and [[Coda (music)|coda]], exposition, development and [[recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]], verse, chorus or [[refrain]], and [[Bridge (music)|bridge]]. Introductions and codas, when they are no more than that, are frequently excluded from formal analysis. All such units may typically be eight measures long. Sectional forms include:

;Strophic form
This form is defined by its "unrelieved repetition" ('''AAAA'''...).

;Medley

[[Medley (music)|Medley]], [[Potpourri (music)|potpourri]] is the extreme opposite, that of "unrelieved variation": it is simply an indefinite sequence of self-contained sections ('''ABCD'''...), sometimes with repeats ('''AABBCCDD'''...).  Examples include orchestral [[overture]]s, which are sometimes no more than a string of the best tunes of the musical theatre show or opera to come.

;Binary form
[[File:Binary form.png|thumb|Binary form in major and minor keys. Each section must be at least three phrases long.&lt;ref&gt;White, John D. (1976). ''The Analysis of Music'', p. 50. {{ISBN|0-13-033233-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

This form uses two sections ('''AB'''...), each often repeated ('''AABB'''...). In 18th-century Western classical music, "simple binary" form was often used for dances and carried with it the convention that the two sections should be in different [[musical key]]s but same rhythm, duration and tone. The alternation of two tunes gives enough variety to permit a dance to be extended for as long as desired.
b
;Ternary form
This form has three parts. In Western classical music a simple ternary form has a third section that is a recapitulation of the first ('''ABA'''). Often, the first section is repeated ('''AABA'''). This approach was popular in the 18th-century operatic [[aria]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} and was called ''[[da capo]]'' (i.e. "repeat from the top") form. Later, it gave rise to the [[thirty-two-bar form|32-bar song]], with the '''B''' section then often referred to as the "middle eight". A song has more need than a dance of a self-contained form with a beginning and an end of course.

;Rondo form
This form has a recurring theme alternating with different (usually contrasting) sections called "episodes". It may be asymmetrical ('''ABACADAEA''') or symmetrical ('''ABACABA'''). A recurring section, especially the main theme, is sometimes more thoroughly varied, or else one episode may be a "development" of it. A similar arrangement is the [[ritornello]] form of the Baroque [[concerto grosso]]. [[Arch form]] ('''ABCBA''') resembles a symmetrical rondo without intermediate repetitions of the main theme. It is normally used in a round.

;Variational form
Variational forms are those in which variation is an important formative element.

'''[[Theme and Variations]]:''' a [[theme (music)|theme]], which in itself can be of any shorter form (binary, ternary, etc.), forms the only "section" and is repeated indefinitely (as in strophic form) but is varied each time (A, B, A, F, Z, A), so as to make a sort of sectional chain form. An important variant of this, much used in 17th-century British music and in the [[Passacaglia]] and [[Chaconne]], was that of the [[ground bass]] – a repeating bass theme or ''basso [[ostinato]]'' over and around which the rest of the structure unfolds, often, but not always, spinning [[polyphony|polyphonic]] or [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] threads, or improvising [[division (music)|divisions]] and [[descant]]s. This is said by Scholes (1977) to be the form ''par excellence'' of unaccompanied or accompanied solo instrumental music. The [[Rondo]] is often found with sections varied ('''AA&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;BA&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;CA&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;BA&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;''') or ('''ABA&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;CA&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;B&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A''').

;Developmental form
Developmental forms are built directly from smaller units, such as [[motif (music)|motifs]]. A well-known Classical piece with a motif is [[Beethoven's fifth symphony]], which starts with three short repeated notes and then a long note. In Classical pieces that are based on motifs, the motif is usually combined, varied and worked out in different ways, perhaps having a symmetrical or arch-like underpinning and a progressive development from beginning to end. By far the most important developmental form in Western classical music is [[Sonata form]].
This form, also known as ''sonata'' form, first movement form, compound binary, ternary and a variety of other names,{{Such as?|Sep2011}} developed from the binary-formed dance movement described above but is almost always cast in a greater ternary form having the nominal subdivisions of ''Exposition, Development'' and ''Recapitulation''. Usually, but not always, the "A" parts ([[Exposition (music)|Exposition]] and [[Recapitulation (music)|Recapitulation]], respectively) may be subdivided into two or three [[theme (music)|themes]] or theme groups which are taken asunder and recombined to form the "B" part (the [[musical development|development]]) – thus e. g. (AabB[dev. of a and/or b]A&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;ab&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;+coda). This developmental form is generally confined to certain sections of the piece, as to the middle section of the first movement of a sonata, though 19th-century composers such as Berlioz, Liszt and Wagner made valiant efforts to derive large-scale works purely or mainly from the motif.

[[Chinese classical music]], the traditional art or court music of China, has a history stretching over around three thousand years. It has its own unique systems of musical notation, as well as musical tuning and pitch, musical instruments and styles or musical genres. Chinese music is pentatonic-diatonic, having a scale of twelve notes to an octave (5&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;12) as does European-influenced music. [[Persian traditional music|Persian music]] is the music of [[Iran|Persia]] and Persian language countries: ''musiqi'', the science and art of music, and ''muzik'', the sound and performance of music (Sakata 1983).

Music and theatre scholars studying the history and anthropology of [[Semitic people|Semitic]] and early [[Judeo-Christian]] culture have discovered common links in theatrical and musical activity between the classical cultures of the [[Hebrews]] and those of later [[Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The common area of performance is found in a "social phenomenon called [[litany]]," a form of prayer consisting of a series of [[invocation]]s or [[supplication]]s. ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'' notes that among the earliest forms of litany, "Hebrew litany was accompanied by a rich musical tradition:"&lt;ref name=JRT&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061004134128/http://www.rtjournal.org/vol_5/no_1/krahenbuhl.html "A Theatre Before the World: Performance History at the Intersection of Hebrew, Greek, and Roman Religious Processional"] ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'', Vol. 5, No. 1, Summer 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"While Genesis 4.21 identifies Jubal as the "father of all such as handle the harp and pipe," the Pentateuch is nearly silent about the practice and instruction of music in the early life of Israel. Then, in I Samuel 10 and the texts that follow, a curious thing happens. "One finds in the biblical text," writes Alfred Sendrey, "a sudden and unexplained upsurge of large choirs and orchestras, consisting of thoroughly organized and trained musical groups, which would be virtually inconceivable without lengthy, methodical preparation." This has led some scholars to believe that the prophet Samuel was the patriarch of a school, which taught not only prophets and holy men, but also sacred-rite musicians. This public music school, perhaps the earliest in recorded history, was not restricted to a priestly class—which is how the shepherd boy David appears on the scene as a minstrel to King Saul."&lt;ref name=JRT/&gt;

The [[Medieval Music|medieval]] era (476 to 1400), which took place during the [[Middle Ages]], started with the introduction of [[monophony|monophonic]] (single melodic line) [[Gregorian chant|chanting]] into [[Roman Catholic Church]] services. [[Musical notation]] was used since Ancient times in [[Ancient Greece|Greek culture]], but in the Middle Ages, notation was first introduced by the [[Catholic church]] so that the chant melodies could be written down, to facilitate the use of the same melodies for religious music across the entire Catholic empire. The only European Medieval repertory that has been found in written form from before 800 is the [[monophony|monophonic]] [[Liturgy|liturgical]] [[plainsong]] chant of the Roman Catholic Church, the central tradition of which was called [[Gregorian chant]].&lt;!--+Add refs to others, e.g. Gallican, Mozarabic, &amp;c.?--&gt; Alongside these traditions of [[Religious music|sacred]] and [[church music]] there existed a vibrant tradition of [[Secular music|secular song]] (non-religious songs). Examples of composers from this period are [[Léonin]], [[Pérotin]], [[Guillaume de Machaut]], and [[Walther von der Vogelweide]].

[[Renaissance music]] (c. 1400 to 1600) was more focused on secular (non-religious) themes, such as [[courtly love]]. Around 1450, the [[printing press]] was invented, which made printed [[sheet music]] much less expensive and easier to mass-produce (prior to the invention of the printing press, all notated music was hand-copied). The increased availability of sheet music helped to spread musical styles more quickly and across a larger area. Musicians and singers often worked for the church, courts and towns. Church choirs grew in size, and the church remained an important patron of music. By the middle of the 15th century, composers wrote richly polyphonic sacred music, in which different melody lines were interwoven simultaneously. Prominent composers from this era include [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], [[Thomas Morley]], and [[Orlande de Lassus]]. As musical activity shifted from the church to the aristocratic courts, kings, queens and princes competed for the finest composers. Many leading important composers came from the Netherlands, Belgium, and northern France. They are called the Franco-Flemish composers. They held important positions throughout Europe, especially in Italy. Other countries with vibrant musical activity included Germany, England, and Spain.

The [[Baroque music|Baroque era of music]] took place from 1600 to 1750, as the [[Baroque|Baroque artistic style]] flourished across Europe; and during this time, music expanded in its range and complexity. Baroque music began when the first operas (dramatic solo vocal music accompanied by orchestra) were written. During the Baroque era, [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] music, in which multiple, simultaneous independent melody lines were used, remained important (counterpoint was important in the vocal music of the Medieval era). German Baroque composers wrote for small [[Musical ensemble|ensembles]] including [[String section|strings]], [[Brass instrument|brass]], and [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]], as well as for [[choir]]s and keyboard instruments such as [[organ (music)|pipe organ]], [[harpsichord]], and [[clavichord]]. During this period several major music forms were defined that lasted into later periods when they were expanded and evolved further, including the [[fugue]], the [[Invention (musical composition)|invention]], the [[sonata]], and the concerto.&lt;ref name="sdsu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |title=''Baroque Music'' by Elaine Thornburgh and Jack Logan, Ph.D |publisher=trumpet.sdsu.edu |accessdate=27 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905175129/http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |archivedate=5 September 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The late Baroque style was polyphonically complex and richly ornamented.

The music of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]] (1730 to 1820) aimed to imitate what were seen as the key elements of the art and philosophy of Ancient Greece and Rome: the ideals of balance, proportion and disciplined expression. (Note: the music from the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]] should not be confused with Classical music in general, a term which refers to Western [[art music]] from the 5th century to the 2000s, which includes the Classical period as one of a number of periods).  Music from the Classical period has a lighter, clearer and considerably simpler texture than the [[Baroque music]] which preceded it. The main style was [[homophony]],&lt;ref&gt;Blume, Friedrich. Classic and Romantic Music: A Comprehensive Survey. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 1970. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; where a prominent [[melody]] and a subordinate chordal [[accompaniment]] part are clearly distinct. Classical instrumental melodies tended to be almost voicelike and singable. New genres were developed, and the [[fortepiano]], the forerunner to the modern piano, replaced the Baroque era [[harpsichord]] and [[pipe organ]] as the main keyboard instrument.

Importance was given to [[instrumental]] music. It was dominated by further development of musical forms initially defined in the Baroque period: the [[sonata]], the concerto, and the [[symphony]]. Others main kinds were the [[Trio (music)|trio]], [[string quartet]], [[serenade]] and [[divertimento]]. The sonata was the most important and developed form. Although Baroque composers also wrote sonatas, the Classical style of sonata is completely distinct. All of the main instrumental forms of the Classical era, from string quartets to symphonies and concertos, were based on the structure of the sonata. The instruments used [[chamber music]] and orchestra became more standardized. In place of the [[basso continuo]] group of the Baroque era, which consisted of harpsichord, organ or lute along with a number of bass instruments selected at the discretion of the group leader (e.g., viol, cello, theorbo, serpent), Classical chamber groups used specified, standardized instruments (e.g., a [[string quartet]] would be performed by two violins, a viola and a cello). The Baroque era improvised chord-playing of the continuo keyboardist or lute player was gradually phased out between 1750 and 1800.

One of the most important changes made in the Classical period was the development of public concerts. The aristocracy still played a significant role in the sponsorship of concerts and compositions, but it was now possible for composers to survive without being  permanent employees of queens or princes. The increasing popularity of classical music led to a growth in the number and types of orchestras. The expansion of orchestral concerts necessitated the building of large public performance spaces. Symphonic music including symphonies, musical accompaniment to ballet and mixed vocal/instrumental genres such as opera and [[oratorio]] became more popular.

The best known composers of Classicism are [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]], [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], [[Johann Christian Bach]], [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]]. Beethoven and Schubert are also considered to be composers in the later part of the Classical era, as it began to move towards Romanticism.

===Romanticism===

[[Romantic music]] (c. 1810 to 1900) from the 19th century had many elements in common with the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] styles in literature and painting of the era. Romanticism was an artistic, literary, and intellectual movement was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as glorification of all the past and nature. Romantic music expanded beyond the rigid styles and forms of the Classical era into more passionate, dramatic expressive pieces and songs. Romantic composers such as [[Wagner]] and [[Brahms]] attempted to increase emotional expression and power in their music to describe deeper truths or human feelings. With symphonic [[tone poem]]s, composers tried to tell stories and evoke images or landscapes using instrumental music. Some composers promoted [[Nationalism|nationalistic]] pride with patriotic orchestral music inspired by [[folk music]]. The emotional and expressive qualities of music came to take precedence over tradition.

Romantic composers grew in idiosyncrasy, and went further in the [[syncretism]] of exploring different art-forms in a musical context, (such as literature), history (historical figures and legends), or nature itself. [[Romantic love]] or longing was a prevalent theme in many works composed during this period. In some cases the formal structures from the classical period continued to be used (e.g., the [[sonata form]] used in [[string quartet]]s and [[symphony|symphonies]]), but these forms were expanded and altered. In many cases, new approaches were explored for existing genres, forms, and functions. Also, new forms were created that were deemed better suited to the new subject matter. Composers continued to develop opera and ballet music, exploring new styles and themes.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

In the years after 1800, the music developed by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]] introduced a more dramatic, expressive style. In Beethoven's case, short [[motif (music)|motifs]], developed organically, came to replace [[melody]] as the most significant compositional unit (an example is the distinctive four note figure used in his [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]]). Later Romantic composers such as [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Antonín Dvořák]], and [[Gustav Mahler]] used more unusual [[chord (music)|chords]] and more [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] to create dramatic tension. They generated complex and often much longer musical works. During the late Romantic period, composers explored dramatic [[Chromatic (music)|chromatic]] alterations of [[tonality]], such as [[extended chord]]s and [[altered chord]]s, which created new sound "colours". The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the orchestra, and the [[industrial revolution]] helped to create better instruments, creating a more powerful sound. Public concerts became an important part of well-to-do [[urban culture|urban]] society. It also saw a new diversity in [[theatre music]], including [[operetta]], and [[Edwardian musical comedy|musical comedy]] and other forms of musical theatre.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

===20th and 21st century music===
{{Main|20th-century music}}

In the 19th century, one of the key ways that new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of [[sheet music]], which middle class amateur music lovers would perform at home on their piano or other common instruments, such as violin. With [[20th-century music]], the invention of new [[music technology (electric)|electric technologies]] such as [[radio broadcasting]] and the [[mass market]] availability of [[gramophone record]]s meant that [[sound recording]]s of songs and pieces heard by listeners (either on the radio or on their record player) became the main way to learn about new songs and pieces. There was a vast increase in music listening as the radio gained popularity and [[phonograph]]s were used to replay and distribute music, because whereas in the 19th century, the focus on sheet music restricted access to new music to the middle class and upper-class people who could read music and who owned pianos and instruments, in the 20th century, anyone with a radio or record player could hear operas, [[symphony|symphonies]] and [[big band]]s right in their own living room. This allowed lower-income people, who would never be able to afford an opera or symphony concert ticket to hear this music. It also meant that people could hear music from different parts of the country, or even different parts of the world, even if they could not afford to travel to these locations. This helped to spread musical styles.

The focus of [[art music]] in the 20th century was characterized by exploration of new rhythms, styles, and sounds. The horrors of [[World War I]] influenced many of the arts, including music, and some composers began exploring darker, harsher sounds. [[Traditional music]] styles such as [[jazz]] and [[folk music]] were used by composers as a source of ideas for classical music. [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], and [[John Cage]] were all influential composers in 20th-century art music. The invention of [[sound recording]] and the ability to edit music gave rise to new subgenre of classical music, including the [[acousmatic]]&lt;ref&gt;Schaeffer, P. (1966), Traité des objets musicaux, Le Seuil, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Musique concrète]] schools of electronic composition. Sound recording was also a major influence on the development of popular music genres, because it enabled recordings of songs and bands to be widely distributed. The introduction of the [[multitrack recording]] system had a major influence on rock music, because it could do much more than record a band's performance. Using a multitrack system, a band and their music producer could overdub many layers of instrument tracks and vocals, creating new sounds that would not be possible in a live performance.

[[Jazz]] evolved and became an important genre of music over the course of the 20th century, and during the second half of that century, rock music did the same. Jazz is an American musical artform that originated in the beginning of the 20th century in African American communities in the Southern United States from a confluence of [[Music of Africa|African]] and European music traditions. The style's West African pedigree is evident in its use of [[blue note]]s, [[improvisation]], [[polyrhythm]]s, [[syncopation]], and the [[swung note]].&lt;ref&gt;Alyn Shipton, ''A New History of Jazz'', 2nd. ed., Continuum, 2007, pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Rock music is a genre of [[popular music]] that developed in the 1960s from 1950s [[rock and roll]], [[rockabilly]], [[blues]], and [[country music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19838/m1/ |title=Show 55 – Crammer: A lively cram course on the history of rock and some other things |show=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sound of rock often revolves around the electric guitar or acoustic guitar, and it uses a strong [[Backbeat (music)|back beat]] laid down by a [[rhythm section]] of electric bass guitar, drums, and keyboard instruments such as organ, piano, or, since the 1970s, [[analog synthesizer]]s and digital ones and computers since the 1990s. Along with the guitar or keyboards, saxophone and blues-style harmonica are used as soloing instruments. In its "purest form," it "has three chords, a strong, insistent back beat, and a catchy melody."

==Performance==
{{Main|Performance}}
[[File:Naxi Musicians I.jpg|thumb|Chinese [[Nakhi|Naxi]] musicians]]
[[File:Assyrianfolk.jpg|Assyrian folk music|thumb|[[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] playing ''[[zurna]]'' and ''[[Davul]]'', instruments that go back thousands of years.]]
Performance is the physical expression of music, which occurs when a song is sung or when a piano piece, electric guitar melody, symphony, drum beat or other [[Part (music)|musical part]] is played by musicians. In classical music, a musical work is written in [[music notation]] by a composer and then it is performed once the composer is satisfied with its structure and instrumentation. However, as it gets performed, the interpretation of a song or piece can evolve and change. In classical music, instrumental performers, singers or conductors may gradually make changes to the phrasing or tempo of a piece. In popular and traditional music, the performers have a lot more freedom to make changes to the form of a song or piece. As such, in popular and traditional music styles, even when a band plays a [[cover song]], they can make changes to it such as adding a [[guitar solo]] to or inserting an introduction.

A performance can either be planned out and rehearsed (practiced)—which is the norm in classical music, with jazz [[big band]]s and many popular music styles–or [[Musical improvisation|improvised]] over a [[chord progression]] (a sequence of chords), which is the norm in small [[jazz]] and [[blues]] groups. Rehearsals of orchestras, [[concert band]]s and [[choir]]s are led by a conductor. Rock, blues and jazz bands are usually led by the bandleader. A rehearsal is a structured repetition of a song or piece by the performers until it can be sung and/or played correctly and, if it is a song or piece for more than one musician, until the parts are together from a rhythmic and tuning perspective. Improvisation is the creation of a musical idea–a melody or other musical line–created on the spot, often based on scales or pre-existing melodic [[riff]]s.

Many cultures have strong traditions of solo performance (in which one singer or instrumentalist performs), such as in Indian classical music, and in the Western art-music tradition. Other cultures, such as in [[Bali]], include strong traditions of group performance. All cultures include a mixture of both, and performance may range from improvised solo playing to highly planned and organised performances such as the modern classical concert, religious processions, classical music festivals or [[music competition]]s. [[Chamber music]], which is music for a small ensemble with only a few of each type of instrument, is often seen as more intimate than large symphonic works.

===Oral and aural tradition===
Many types of music, such as traditional [[blues]] and [[folk music]] were not written down in [[sheet music]]; instead, they were originally preserved in the memory of performers, and the songs were handed down [[oral history|orally]], from one musician or singer to another, or aurally, in which a performer learns a song "[[Playing by ear (music)|by ear]]". When the composer of a song or piece is no longer known, this music is often classified as "traditional" or as a "folk song". Different musical traditions have different attitudes towards how and where to make changes to the original source material, from quite strict, to those that demand improvisation or modification to the music. A culture's history and stories may also be passed on by ear through song.

===Ornamentation===
{{Main|Ornament (music)}}
[[File:Trill example ornaments.png|thumb|right|upright=0.9|In a score or on a performer's music part, this sign indicates that the musician should perform a [[trill (music)|trill]]—a rapid alternation between two notes. {{audio|Trill example ornaments.mid|Play}}]]
In music, an "ornament" is a decoration to a melody, bassline or other musical part. The detail included explicitly in the [[Musical notation|music notation]] varies between genres and historical periods. In general, art music notation from the 17th through the 19th centuries required performers to have a great deal of contextual knowledge about performing styles. For example, in the 17th and 18th centuries, music notated for solo performers typically indicated a simple, unadorned melody. However, performers were expected to know how to add stylistically appropriate ornaments to add interest to the music, such as [[Trill (music)|trills]] and [[Turn (music)#Turn|turns]].

In the 19th century, art music for solo performers may give a general instruction such as to perform the music expressively, without describing in detail how the performer should do this. The performer was expected to know how to use tempo changes, [[accent (music)|accentuation]], and [[Rest (music)|pauses]] (among other devices) to obtain this "expressive" performance style. In the 20th century, art music notation often became more explicit and used a range of markings and annotations to indicate to performers how they should play or sing the piece.

==Philosophy and aesthetics==
{{Main|Philosophy of music|Aesthetics of music}}
[[File:Boldini, Woman in Red.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|A painting by Boldini of a woman playing the piano]]
Philosophy of music is a subfield of philosophy. The philosophy of music is the study of fundamental questions regarding music. The philosophical study of music has many connections with philosophical questions in [[metaphysics]] and [[aesthetics]].
Some basic questions in the philosophy of music are:
* What is the [[definition of music]]? (What are the [[necessary and sufficient conditions]] for classifying something as music?)
* What is the relationship between music and mind?
* What does musical history reveal to us about the world?
* What is the connection between music and emotions?
* What is meaning in relation to music?

In ancient times, such as with the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], the aesthetics of music explored the mathematical and cosmological dimensions of rhythmic and harmonic organization. In the 18th century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (''[[plaisir]]'' and ''[[jouissance]]'') of music. The origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten]] in the 18th century, followed by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. Through their writing, the ancient term 'aesthetics', meaning sensory perception, received its present-day connotation. In the 2000s, philosophers have tended to emphasize issues besides beauty and enjoyment. For example, music's capacity to express emotion has been a central issue.

In the 20th century, important contributions were made by [[Peter Kivy]], [[Jerrold Levinson]], [[Roger Scruton]], and [[Stephen Davies (philosopher)|Stephen Davies]]. However, many musicians, [[music criticism|music critics]], and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music. In the 19th century, a significant debate arose between [[Eduard Hanslick]], a music critic and musicologist, and composer [[Richard Wagner]] regarding whether music can express meaning. [[Harry Partch]] and some other [[musicologist]]s, such as [[Kyle Gann]], have studied and tried to popularize [[microtonal music]] and the usage of alternate [[musical scale]]s. Also many modern composers like [[La Monte Young]], [[Rhys Chatham]] and [[Glenn Branca]] paid much attention to a scale called [[just intonation]].

It is often thought that music has the ability to affect our [[emotions]], [[intellect]], and [[psychology]]; it can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions. The philosopher [[Plato]] suggests in ''the Republic'' that music has a direct effect on the soul. Therefore, he proposes that in the ideal regime music would be closely regulated by the state. (Book VII)

There has been a strong tendency in the aesthetics of music to emphasize the paramount importance of compositional structure; however, other issues concerning the aesthetics of music include [[lyrics|lyricism]], [[harmony]], [[hypnotism]], [[emotion|emotiveness]], [[Temporal Dynamics of Music and Language|temporal dynamics]], [[resonance]], playfulness, and [[timbre (music)|color]] (see also [[musical development]]).

==Psychology==
{{Main|Music psychology}}
Modern music psychology aims to explain and understand musical [[behavior]] and [[experience]].&lt;ref name = Tan&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tan |first1=Siu-Lan |last2=Pfordresher |first2=Peter |last3=Harré |first3=Rom |date=2010 |title=Psychology of Music: From Sound to Significance |location=New York |publisher=Psychology Press |page=2 |isbn=978-1-84169-868-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research in this field and its subfields are primarily [[Empirical research|empirical]]; their knowledge tends to advance on the basis of interpretations of data collected by systematic [[observation]] of and interaction with [[Human subject research|human participants]]. In addition to its focus on fundamental perceptions and cognitive processes, music psychology is a field of research with practical relevance for many areas, including music [[musical technique|performance]], [[music composition|composition]], [[music education|education]], [[music criticism|criticism]], and [[music therapy|therapy]], as well as investigations of human [[aptitude]], skill, [[intelligence]], creativity, and [[social behavior]].

===Cognitive neuroscience of music===
{{Main|Cognitive neuroscience of music}}
[[File:Brodmann 41 42.png|right|upright=1.15|thumb|The [[primary auditory cortex]] is one of the main areas associated with superior pitch resolution.]]
Cognitive neuroscience of music is the scientific study of brain-based mechanisms involved in the cognitive processes underlying music. These behaviours include music listening, performing, composing, reading, writing, and ancillary activities. It also is increasingly concerned with the brain basis for musical aesthetics and musical emotion. The field is distinguished by its reliance on direct observations of the brain, using such techniques as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS), [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG), [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET).

===Cognitive musicology===

Many ethnographic studies demonstrate that music is a participatory, community-based activity.&lt;ref&gt;Grazian, David. "The Symbolic Economy of Authenticity in the Chicago Blues Scene." in Music Scenes: Local, Translocal, and Virtual. ed. Bennett, Andy and Richard A. Peterson. Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press, 2004. pp. 31–47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Elizabeth Ball (2010). [https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1125&amp;context=open_access_etds Portland's Independent Music Scene: Formation of Community Identities and Alternative Urban Cultural Landscapes], p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Music is experienced by individuals in a range of social settings ranging from being alone to attending a large concert, forming a [[music community]], which cannot be understood as a function of individual will or accident; it includes both commercial and non-commercial participants with a shared set of common values. Musical performances take different forms in different cultures and socioeconomic milieus. In Europe and North America, there is often a divide between what types of music are viewed as a "[[high culture]]" and "[[low culture]]." "High culture" types of music typically include Western art music such as Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and modern-era symphonies, concertos, and solo works, and are typically heard in formal concerts in concert halls and churches, with the audience sitting quietly in seats.

Other types of music—including, but not limited to, jazz, blues, [[soul music|soul]], and [[country music|country]]—are often performed in bars, nightclubs, and theatres, where the audience may be able to drink, dance, and express themselves by cheering. Until the later 20th century, the division between "high" and "low" musical forms was widely accepted as a valid distinction that separated out better quality, more advanced "art music" from the popular styles of music heard in bars and dance halls.

However, in the 1980s and 1990s, musicologists studying this perceived divide between "high" and "low" musical genres argued that this distinction is not based on the musical value or quality of the different types of music.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Rather, they argued that this distinction was based largely on the [[socioeconomic]]s standing or social class of the performers or audience of the different types of music.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} For example, whereas the audience for Classical symphony concerts typically have above-average incomes, the audience for a rap concert in an inner-city area may have below-average incomes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Even though the performers, audience, or venue where non-"art" music is performed may have a lower socioeconomic status, the music that is performed, such as blues, rap, [[Punk rock|punk]], [[funk]], or [[ska]] may be very complex and sophisticated.

When composers introduce styles of music that break with convention, there can be a strong resistance from academic music experts and popular culture. Late-period Beethoven string quartets, Stravinsky ballet scores, [[serialism]], [[bebop]]-era jazz, hip hop, punk rock, and [[electronica]] have all been considered non-music by some critics when they were first introduced.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Such themes are examined in the sociology of music. The sociological study of music, sometimes called [[sociomusicology]], is often pursued in departments of sociology, media studies, or music, and is closely related to the field of [[ethnomusicology]].

===Role of women===
{{Main|Women in music}}
[[File:Clara Wieck im Alter von 15 Jahren.jpg|thumb|right|Nineteenth-century composer and pianist [[Clara Schumann]].]]
Women have played a major role in music throughout history, as composers, songwriters, [[Musician|instrumental performers]], singers, conductors, [[musicology|music scholars]], [[music teacher|music educators]], [[music criticism|music critics]]/[[music journalist]]s and other musical professions. As well, it describes music movements, events and genres related to women, [[women's rights|women's issues]] and [[feminism]]. In the 2010s, while women comprise a significant proportion of [[popular music]] and classical music singers, and a significant proportion of songwriters (many of them being singer-songwriters), there are few women record producers, [[music journalist|rock critics]] and rock instrumentalists. Although there have been a huge number of [[List of women composers|women composers]] in classical music, from the Medieval period to the present day, women composers are significantly underrepresented in the [[Western canon|commonly performed classical music repertoire]], music history textbooks and music encyclopedias; for example, in the ''Concise Oxford History of Music'', [[Clara Schumann]] is one of the only female composers who is mentioned.

Women comprise a significant proportion of instrumental soloists in classical music and the percentage of women in orchestras is increasing. A 2015 article on concerto soloists in major Canadian orchestras, however, indicated that 84% of the soloists with the [[Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal]] were men. In 2012, women still made up just 6% of the top-ranked [[Vienna Philharmonic]] orchestra. Women are less common as instrumental players in popular music genres such as rock and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], although there have been a number of notable female instrumentalists and [[all-female band]]s. Women are particularly underrepresented in [[extreme metal]] genres.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Schaap and Pauwke Berkers. "Grunting Alone? Online Gender Inequality in Extreme Metal Music" in ''Journal of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music''. Vol. 4, no. 1 (2014) p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s pop-music scene, "[l]ike most aspects of the...music business, [in the 1960s,] songwriting was a male-dominated field. Though there were plenty of female singers on the radio, women ...were primarily seen as consumers:... Singing was sometimes an acceptable pastime for a girl, but playing an instrument, writing songs, or producing records simply wasn't done."&lt;ref name="rebeatmag.com"&gt;{{cite web |author=Erika White |url=http://www.rebeatmag.com/music-history-primer-3-pioneering-female-songwriters-of-the-60s/ |title=Music History Primer: 3 Pioneering Female Songwriters of the '60s &amp;#124; REBEAT Magazine |publisher=Rebeatmag.com |date=2015-01-28 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young women "...were not socialized to see themselves as people who create [music]."&lt;ref name="rebeatmag.com"/&gt;

Women are also underrepresented in orchestral conducting, music criticism/music journalism, [[Music producer|music producing]], and [[sound engineering]]. While women were discouraged from composing in the 19th century, and there are few women [[musicology|musicologists]], women became involved in [[music education]] "...to such a degree that women dominated [this field] during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://parlorsongs.com/issues/2002-9/thismonth/feature.php |title=Women Composers In American Popular Song |page= 1 |publisher=Parlorsongs.com |date=1911-03-25 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jessica Duchen, a music writer for London's ''[[The Independent]]'', women musicians in classical music are "...too often judged for their appearances, rather than their talent" and they face pressure "...to look sexy onstage and in photos."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"&gt;http://music.cbc.ca/#!/blogs/2014/3/Classical-musics-shocking-gender-gap {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301002442/http://music.cbc.ca/ |date=2016-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Duchen states that while "[t]here are women musicians who refuse to play on their looks,...the ones who do tend to be more materially successful."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"/&gt;
According to the UK's Radio 3 editor, Edwina Wolstencroft, the music industry has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles, but women are much less likely to have positions of authority, such as being the [[Conducting|leader of an orchestra]].&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web |author=Jessica Duchen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/28/why-male-domination-of-classical-music-might-end |title=Why the male domination of classical music might be coming to an end &amp;#124; Music |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In popular music, while there are many women singers recording songs, there are very few women behind the [[Audio mixer|audio console]] acting as music producers, the individuals who direct and manage the recording process.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ncube |first=Rosina |title=Sounding Off: Why So Few Women In Audio? |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep13/articles/sounding-off-0913.htm |journal=Sound on Sound |date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most recorded artists is [[Asha Bhosle]], an Indian singer best known as a playback singer in Hindi cinema.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Media and technology==
{{Further|Computer music|Music technology}}

[[File:Peter Francken in his studio.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Music production in the 2000s using a [[digital audio workstation]] (DAW) with an electronic keyboard and a [[multi-monitor]] set-up.]]
The music that composers make can be heard through several media; the most traditional way is to hear it live, in the presence of the musicians (or as one of the musicians), in an outdoor or indoor space such as an amphitheatre, [[concert hall]], [[cabaret]] room or [[theatre music|theatre]]. Since the 20th century, live music can also be broadcast over the radio, television or the Internet, or [[sound recording|recorded]] and listened to on a [[CD player]] or Mp3 player. Some musical styles focus on producing a sound for a performance, while others focus on producing a recording that mixes together sounds that were never played "live." Recording, even of essentially live styles such as rock, often uses the ability to edit and splice to produce recordings that may be considered "better" than the actual performance.

[[Music technology|Technology]] has had an influence on music since prehistoric times, when cave people used simple tools to bore holes into bone flutes 41,000 years ago. Technology continued to influence music throughout the history of music, as it enabled new instruments and music notation reproduction systems to be used, with one of the watershed moments in music notation being the invention of the [[printing press]] in the 1400s, which meant music scores no longer had to be hand copied. In the 19th century, music technology led to the development of a more powerful, louder piano and led to the development of new valves brass instruments. In the early 20th century (in the late 1920s), as [[sound film|talking pictures]] emerged in the early 20th century, with their prerecorded musical tracks, an increasing number of moviehouse orchestra musicians found themselves out of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afm.org/public/about/history.php |title=American Federation of Musicians/History |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405035855/http://www.afm.org/public/about/history.php |archivedate=2007-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s, live musical performances by orchestras, pianists, and [[theater organ]]ists were common at first-run theaters.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard (1985), p. 429.&lt;/ref&gt; With the coming of the talking motion pictures, those featured performances were largely eliminated. The [[American Federation of Musicians]] (AFM) took out newspaper advertisements protesting the replacement of live musicians with mechanical playing devices. One 1929 ad that appeared in the ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]'' features an image of a can labeled "Canned Music / Big Noise Brand / Guaranteed to Produce No Intellectual or Emotional Reaction Whatever"&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/adaccess.R0206/ "Canned Music on Trial"] part of [[Duke University]]'s ''Ad*Access'' project.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since legislation introduced to help protect performers, composers, publishers and producers, including the [[Audio Home Recording Act]] of 1992 in the United States, and the 1979 revised [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] in the United Kingdom, recordings and live performances have also become more accessible through computers, devices and Internet in a form that is commonly known as [[Music-On-Demand]].

In many cultures, there is less distinction between performing and listening to music, since virtually everyone is involved in some sort of musical activity, often communal. In industrialized countries, listening to music through a recorded form, such as [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recording]] or watching a music video, became more common than experiencing live performance, roughly in the middle of the 20th century.

Sometimes, live performances incorporate prerecorded sounds. For example, a disc jockey uses [[gramophone record|disc records]] for [[scratching]], and some 20th-century works have a solo for an instrument or voice that is performed along with music that is prerecorded onto a tape. Computers and many [[keyboard (computing)|keyboards]] can be programmed to produce and play [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface]] (MIDI) music. Audiences can also ''become'' performers by participating in [[karaoke]], an activity of Japanese origin centered on a device that plays voice-eliminated versions of well-known songs. Most karaoke machines also have video screens that show lyrics to songs being performed; performers can follow the lyrics as they sing over the instrumental tracks.

===Internet===

The advent of the Internet and widespread high-speed broadband access has transformed the experience of music, partly through the increased ease of access to recordings of music via [[streaming video]] and vastly increased choice of music for consumers. [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]], in his book ''[[The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More]]'', suggests that while the traditional economic model of [[supply and demand]] describes scarcity, the Internet retail model is based on abundance. [[Data storage device|Digital storage]] costs are low, so a company can afford to make its whole recording inventory available online, giving customers as much choice as possible. It has thus become economically viable to offer music recordings that very few people are interested in. Consumers' growing awareness of their increased choice results in a closer association between listening tastes and social identity, and the creation of thousands of [[niche market]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Chris (2006). The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More. Hyperion. {{ISBN|1-4013-0237-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another effect of the Internet arose with [[Virtual community|online communities]] and [[social media]] websites like YouTube and Facebook, a [[social networking service]]. These sites make it easier for aspiring singers and amateur bands to distribute videos of their songs, connect with other musicians, and gain audience interest. Professional musicians also use YouTube as a free publisher of promotional material. YouTube users, for example, no longer only download and listen to MP3s, but also actively create their own. According to [[Don Tapscott]] and [[Anthony D. Williams (author)|Anthony D. Williams]], in their book ''[[Wikinomics]]'', there has been a shift from a traditional consumer role to what they call a "[[prosumer]]" role, a consumer who both creates content and consumes. Manifestations of this in music include the production of [[mashup (music)|mashes]], [[remix]]es, and music videos by fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tapscott |first=Don |authorlink=Don Tapscott |author2=Williams, Anthony D. |authorlink2=Anthony D. Williams (author) |title=Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything |date=2006-12-28 |publisher=Portfolio Hardcover |isbn=978-1-59184-138-8|title-link=Wikinomics }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
[[File:Concerto music store, Utrechtsestraat 64, Amsterdam 5.jpg|350px|thumb|right|A music store selling various singles and albums]]
{{Main|Music industry}}

The music industry refers to the businesses connected with the creation and sale of music. It consists of songwriters and composers who create new songs and musical pieces, music producers and [[sound engineer]]s who record songs and pieces, record labels and [[Music publisher (popular music)|publishers]] that distribute recorded music products and [[sheet music]] internationally and that often control the rights to those products. Some music labels are "[[independent record label|independent]]," while others are subsidiaries of larger corporate entities or international [[media conglomerate|media groups]]. In the 2000s, the increasing popularity of listening to music as digital music files on MP3 players, iPods, or computers, and of trading music on [[file sharing]] websites or buying it online in the form of digital files had a major impact on the traditional music business. Many smaller independent [[CD store]]s went out of business as music buyers decreased their purchases of CDs, and many labels had lower CD sales. Some companies did well with the change to a digital format, though, such as Apple's [[iTunes]], an [[online music store]] that sells digital files of songs over the Internet.

===Intellectual property laws===
{{Main||Royalty_payment#Music_royalties}}
In spite of some [[international copyright treaties]], determining which music is in the [[public domain]] is complicated by [[:Category:copyright law by country|the variety]] of national [[copyright law]]s that may be applicable.  [[US copyright law]] formerly protected printed music published after 1923 for 28 years and with renewal for another 28 years, but the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] made renewal automatic, and the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] changed the calculation of the copyright term to 70 years after the death of the creator. Recorded sound falls under [[mechanical licensing]], often covered by a confusing patchwork of state laws; most [[cover version]]s are licensed through the [[Harry Fox Agency]]. [[Performance rights]] may be obtained by either performers or the performance venue; the two major organizations for licensing are [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] and [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]]. Two online sources for [[public domain music]] are [[International Music Score Library Project|IMSLP (International Music Score Library Project)]] and [[Choral Public Domain Library|Choral Public Domain Library (CPDL)]].

==Education==

===Non-professional===
{{Main|Music education}}
[[File:Suzuki violin recital.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|A [[Suzuki method|Suzuki]] violin recital with students of varying ages]]
The incorporation of some music or singing training into general education from [[Preschool education|preschool]] to [[Higher education|post secondary education]] is common in North America and Europe. Involvement in playing and singing music is thought to teach basic skills such as concentration, [[counting]], listening, and cooperation while also promoting understanding of [[language]], improving the ability to [[memory|recall]] information, and creating an environment more conducive to learning in other areas.&lt;ref&gt;Woodall and Ziembroski, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In elementary schools, children often learn to play instruments such as the [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], sing in small choirs, and learn about the history of Western art music and traditional music. Some elementary school children also learn about popular music styles. In religious schools, children sing [[hymn]]s and other religious music. In secondary schools (and less commonly in elementary schools), students may have the opportunity to perform in some types of musical ensembles, such as [[choir]]s (a group of singers), [[marching band]]s, [[concert band]]s, jazz bands, or orchestras. In some school systems, music lessons on how to play instruments may be provided. Some students also take private [[music lesson]]s after school with a singing teacher or instrument teacher. Amateur musicians typically learn basic musical rudiments (e.g., learning about [[musical notation]] for [[musical scale]]s and rhythms) and beginner- to intermediate-level singing or instrument-playing techniques.

At the university level, students in most arts and [[humanities]] programs can receive [[Credit (education)|credit]] for taking a few music courses, which typically take the form of an overview course on the [[history of music]], or a [[music appreciation]] course that focuses on listening to music and learning about different musical styles. In addition, most North American and European universities have some types of musical ensembles that students in arts and humanities are able to participate in, such as choirs, marching bands, concert bands, or orchestras. The study of Western art music is increasingly common outside of North America and Europe, such as the [[Indonesian Institute of the Arts, Yogyakarta|Indonesian Institute of the Arts]] in [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], [[Indonesia]], or the classical music programs that are available in Asian countries such as South Korea, Japan, and China. At the same time, Western universities and colleges are widening their curriculum to include music of non-Western cultures, such as the [[music of Africa]] or Bali (e.g. [[Gamelan]] music).

===Professional training===

Individuals aiming to become professional musicians, singers, composers, songwriters, music teachers and practitioners of other music-related professions such as [[music history]] professors, [[sound engineer]]s, and so on study in specialized post-secondary programs offered by colleges, universities and [[music conservatory|music conservatories]].  Some institutions that train individuals for careers in music offer training in a wide range of professions, as is the case with many of the top U.S. universities, which offer degrees in music performance (including singing and playing instruments), music history, music theory, music composition, [[music education]] (for individuals aiming to become elementary or high school music teachers) and, in some cases, conducting. On the other hand, some small colleges may only offer training in a single profession (e.g., [[sound recording]]).

While most university and conservatory music programs focus on training students in classical music, there are a number of universities and colleges that train musicians for careers as [[jazz]] or [[popular music]] musicians and composers, with notable U.S. examples including the [[Manhattan School of Music]] and the [[Berklee College of Music]]. Two important schools in Canada which offer professional jazz training are [[McGill University]] and [[Humber College]]. Individuals aiming at careers in some types of music, such as [[heavy metal music]], [[country music]] or [[blues]] are less likely to become professionals by completing degrees or diplomas in colleges or universities. Instead, they typically learn about their style of music by singing and/or playing in many bands (often beginning in amateur bands, [[cover band]]s and [[tribute band]]s), studying recordings available on CD, DVD and the Internet and working with already-established professionals in their style of music, either through informal [[mentoring]] or regular [[music lesson]]s. Since the 2000s, the increasing popularity and availability of Internet forums and YouTube "how-to" videos have enabled many singers and musicians from metal, blues and similar genres to improve their skills. Many pop, rock and country singers train informally with [[vocal coach]]es and [[singing teacher]]s.

====Undergraduate====
[[Undergraduate education|Undergraduate]] [[academic degree|university degrees]] in music, including the [[Bachelor of Music]], the Bachelor of Music Education, and the Bachelor of Arts (with a major in music) typically take about four years to complete. These degrees provide students with a grounding in music theory and music history, and many students also study an instrument or learn singing technique as part of their program. Graduates of undergraduate music programs can seek employment or go on to further study in music graduate programs. Bachelor's degree graduates are also eligible to apply to some graduate programs and [[professional school]]s outside of music (e.g., [[public administration]], [[business administration]], [[library science]], and, in some jurisdictions, [[teachers college|teacher's college]], [[law school]] or [[medical school]]).

====Graduate====
Graduate music degrees include the [[Master of Music]], the Master of Arts (in musicology, music theory or another music field), the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) (e.g., in musicology or music theory), and more recently, the [[Doctor of Musical Arts]], or DMA. The Master of Music degree, which takes one to two years to complete, is typically awarded to students studying the performance of an instrument, education, voice (singing) or composition. The Master of Arts degree, which takes one to two years to complete and often requires a [[Dissertation|thesis]], is typically awarded to students studying musicology, music history, music theory or ethnomusicology.

The PhD, which is required for students who want to work as university professors in musicology, music history, or music theory, takes three to five years of study after the master's degree, during which time the student will complete advanced courses and undertake research for a dissertation. The DMA is a relatively new degree that was created to provide a credential for professional performers or composers that want to work as university professors in musical performance or composition. The DMA takes three to five years after a master's degree, and includes advanced courses, projects, and performances. In Medieval times, the study of music was one of the [[Quadrivium]] of the seven [[liberal arts|Liberal Arts]] and considered vital to higher learning. Within the quantitative Quadrivium, music, or more accurately [[harmonic]]s, was the study of rational proportions.

====Musicology====
[[Musicology]], the academic study of the subject of music, is studied in universities and music conservatories. The earliest definitions from the 19th century defined three sub-disciplines of musicology: [[systematic musicology]], [[Music history|historical musicology]], and comparative musicology or [[ethnomusicology]]. In 2010-era scholarship, one is more likely to encounter a division of the discipline into [[music theory]], [[music history]], and [[ethnomusicology]]. Research in musicology has often been enriched by cross-disciplinary work, for example in the field of [[psychoacoustics]]. The study of music of non-Western cultures, and the cultural study of music, is called ethnomusicology. Students can pursue the undergraduate study of musicology, ethnomusicology, [[music history]], and music theory through several different types of degrees, including bachelor's degrees, master's degrees and PhD degrees.

====Music theory====
[[Music theory]] is the study of music, generally in a highly technical manner outside of other disciplines. More broadly it refers to any study of music, usually related in some form with compositional concerns, and may include [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[anthropology]]. What is most commonly taught in beginning music theory classes are guidelines to write in the style of the [[common practice period]], or [[Tonality|tonal music]]. Theory, even of music of the common practice period, may take many other forms. [[Set theory (music)|Musical set theory]] is the application of mathematical [[set theory]] to music, first applied to [[Atonality|atonal music]]. ''Speculative music theory'', contrasted with ''analytic music theory'', is devoted to the analysis and synthesis of music materials, for example [[musical tuning|tuning systems]], generally as preparation for composition.

====Zoomusicology====
[[Zoomusicology]] is the study of the music of non-human animals, or the musical aspects of sounds produced by non-human animals. As George Herzog (1941) asked, "do animals have music?" [[François-Bernard Mâche]]'s ''Musique, mythe, nature, ou les Dauphins d'Arion'' (1983), a study of "ornitho-musicology" using a technique of [[Nicolas Ruwet]]'s ''Langage&lt;!--Langage=parlance or mode of speech--&gt;, musique, poésie'' (1972) [[Paradigmatic analysis|paradigmatic segmentation analysis]], shows that [[Bird vocalization|bird songs]] are organised according to a repetition-transformation principle. Jean-Jacques Nattiez (1990), argues that "in the last analysis, it is a human being who decides what is and is not musical, even when the sound is not of human origin. If we acknowledge that sound is not organised and conceptualised (that is, made to form music) merely by its producer, but by the mind that perceives it, then music is uniquely human."

====Ethnomusicology====
{{Main|Ethnomusicology}}
[[File:Frances Densmore recording Mountain Chief2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Ethnomusicologist [[Frances Densmore]] recording [[Blackfoot]] chief Mountain Chief for the [[Bureau of American Ethnology]] (1916)]]
In the West, much of the history of music that is taught deals with the Western civilization's art music, which is known as classical music. The history of music in non-Western cultures ("[[world music]]" or the field of "ethnomusicology"), which typically covers music from
Africa and Asia is also taught in Western universities. This includes the documented classical traditions of Asian countries outside the influence of Western Europe, as well as the folk or indigenous music of various other cultures. Popular or folk styles of music in non-Western countries varied widely from culture to culture, and from period to period. Different cultures emphasised different [[musical instrument|instruments]], techniques, singing styles and uses for music. Music has been used for entertainment, ceremonies, rituals, religious purposes and for practical and artistic communication. Non-Western music has also been used for propaganda purposes, as was the case with [[Chinese opera]] during the [[Cultural Revolution]].

There is a host of music classifications for non-Western music, many of which are caught up in the argument over the [[definition of music]]. Among the largest of these is the division between classical music (or "art" music), and popular music (or [[Contemporary commercial music|commercial music]] – including non-Western styles of rock, [[country music|country]], and pop music-related styles). Some genres do not fit neatly into one of these "big two" classifications, (such as [[folk music]], [[world music]], or [[jazz]]-related music).

As world cultures have come into [[Globalization|greater global contact]], their indigenous musical styles have often merged with other styles, which produces new styles. For example, the United States [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] style contains elements from [[Folk Music of England|Anglo]]-[[Music of Ireland|Irish]], [[Music of Scotland|Scottish]], Irish, [[Music of Germany|German]] and African instrumental and vocal traditions, which were able to fuse in the United States' multi-ethnic "[[melting pot]]" society. Some types of world music contain a mixture of non-Western indigenous styles with Western pop music elements. Genres of music are determined as much by tradition and presentation as by the actual music. Some works, like [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', are claimed by both jazz and classical music, while Gershwin's ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' and [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' are claimed by both opera and the [[Broadway musical]] tradition. Many current music festivals for non-Western music include bands and singers from a particular musical genre, such as world music.

[[Music of India|Indian music]], for example, is one of the oldest and longest living types of music, and is still widely heard and performed in South Asia, as well as internationally (especially since the 1960s). Indian music has mainly three forms of classical music, [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]], [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]], and [[Dhrupad]] styles. It has also a large repertoire of styles, which involve only percussion music such as the talavadya performances famous in [[South India]].

==Music therapy==
{{Main|Music therapy}}
[[File:USMC-05376.jpg|thumb|right|A music therapist from a "Blues in the Schools" program plays harmonica with a US Navy sailor at a Naval Therapy Center.]]
[[Music therapy]] is an interpersonal process in which a trained therapist uses music and all of its facets—physical, emotional, mental, social, aesthetic, and spiritual—to help clients to improve or maintain their health. In some instances, the client's needs are addressed directly through music; in others they are addressed through the relationships that develop between the client and therapist. Music therapy is used with individuals of all ages and with a variety of conditions, including: psychiatric disorders, medical problems, physical disabilities, sensory impairments, developmental disabilities, substance abuse issues, communication disorders, interpersonal problems, and aging. It is also used to improve learning, build self-esteem, reduce stress, [[Exercise and music|support physical exercise]], and facilitate a host of other health-related activities. Music therapists may encourage clients to sing, play instruments, create songs, or do other musical activities.

One of the earliest mentions of music therapy was in [[Al-Farabi]]'s (c. 872–950) treatise ''Meanings of the Intellect'', which described the therapeutic effects of music on the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haque |first1=Amber |year=2004 |title=Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists |url= |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=357–377 [363] |doi=10.1007/s10943-004-4302-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=May 2011}} Music has long been used to help people deal with their emotions. In the 17th century, the scholar [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]]'s ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'' argued that music and dance were critical in treating [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], especially [[melancholia]].&lt;ref&gt;cf. The Anatomy of Melancholy, Robert Burton, subsection 3, on and after line 3,480, "Music a Remedy"&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that music has an "excellent power ...to expel many other diseases" and he called it "a sovereign remedy against despair and melancholy."

In some interviews Einstein even attributed much of his scientific intuition to music, with his son Hans recounting that "whenever he felt that he had come to the end of the road or into a difficult situation in his work, he would take refuge in music, and that would usually resolve all his difficulties." Something in the music, according to Michele and Robert Root-Bernstein in ''[[Psychology Today]]'', "would guide his thoughts in new and creative directions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/imagine/201003/einstein-creative-thinking-music-and-the-intuitive-art-scientific-imagination |title=Einstein On Creative Thinking: Music and the Intuitive Art of Scientific Imagination|author1-last=Root-Bernstein|author1-first=Michele|author2-last=Root-Bernstein|author2-first=Robert |magazine=Psychology Today |date=March 31, 2010 |accessdate=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that Einstein considered Mozart's music to reveal a universal harmony that Einstein believed existed in the universe, "as if the great Wolfgang Amadeus did not 'create' his beautifully clear music at all, but simply discovered it already made.

'''Mustafa Emirbayer''' is an American sociologist and professor of sociology at University of Wisconsin-Madison. He is known for his theoretical contributions to social network analysis, and is "one of the most vocal advocates of the [[relational sociology|relational approach]] in the social sciences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Erikson|first1=Emily|title=Formalist and relationalist theory in social network analysis|journal=Sociological Theory|date=2013|volume=31|issue=3|pages=219–242|url=http://www.bebr.ufl.edu/sites/default/files/Erikson%20-%202013%20-%20Formalist%20and%20Relationalist%20Theory%20in%20Social%20Netwo.pdf|accessdate=July 18, 2014|doi=10.1177/0735275113501998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 he won the [[Lewis A. Coser]] Award for Theoretical Agenda-Setting from the [[American Sociological Association]].

== Career ==

Emirbayer was born in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], to parents of Turkish and Crimean Tatar descent. He also spent part of his childhood in [[Santa Barbara, California]], and his high school years in [[Mexico City, Mexico]].&lt;ref name="Emirbayer's Bio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Emirbayer's Bio|url=http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~emirbaye/Mustafa_Emirbayer/BIO.html|website=www.ssc.wisc.edu|accessdate=July 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[University of California, Davis]] and received his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in [[psychology]] (with minors in English and History) in 1980. He originally enrolled in the graduate program in psychology at the [[University of Michigan]], where he first took coursework from the sociologist [[Charles Tilly]]. He soon realized that he wanted to study sociology as he felt psychology at the time neglected culture, institutions and history.&lt;ref name="Emirbayer's Bio" /&gt; Emirbayer went on to receive his [[Master of Arts|MA]] in 1985 and [[PhD]] in 1989 from [[Harvard University]], both in sociology. His dissertation was "Moral Education in American, 1830–1990" under the direction of [[Nathan Glazer]] (chair), [[Daniel Bell]], [[David Riesman]], and [[Theda Skocpol]].

Emirbayer attended Harvard shortly after the "[[Harrison White#The Harvard Revolution|revolution]]" in social network analysis,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.analytictech.com/mb119/chapt2a.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and later at The New School, along with colleagues Charles Tilly and [[Harrison White]], he played a key role in [[relational sociology|The New York School of relational sociology]].&lt;ref&gt;https://ssc.wisc.edu/~emirbaye/Mustafa_Emirbayer/BIO.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, he became the [[editor-in-chief]] of the journal ''[[Sociological Theory (journal)|Sociological Theory]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.asanet.org/sites/default/files/savvy/footnotes/septoct15/st_0915.html | title=Sociological Theory Welcomes New Editor Mustafa Emirbayer | publisher=American Sociological Association | work=Footnotes | date=September–October 2015 | accessdate=7 May 2017 | author=Goldberg, Chad Alan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major contributions ==

When he was at the [[The New School|New School for Social Research]], along with co-author [[Jeff Goodwin]], Emirbayer won the 1994 [[Clifford Geertz]] Award for Best Article in Cultural Sociology&lt;ref name="Section On Culture Past Award Recipients"&gt;{{cite web|title=Section On Culture Past Award Recipients|url=http://www.asanet.org/sections/culture_recipients_History.cfm|accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the article ''“Network Analysis, Culture, and the Problem of Agency”''.&lt;ref name="Network Analysis, Culture, and the Problem of Agency"&gt;{{cite web |title=Emirbayer, Mustafa, and Jeff Goodwin.

Inspired by discussions at a series of mini-conferences organized by Harrison White at the [[Lazarsfeld Center]],&lt;ref name="Mische - Relational sociology history"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mische|first1=Ann|chapter=Relational sociology, culture, and agency |editor=John Scott |editor2=Peter J.

His most-cited publication, with [[Ann Mische]], is their 1998 article "What is Agency?"&lt;ref&gt;Emirbayer, Mustafa, and Ann Mische. "What is agency? 1." ''American Journal of Sociology'' 103.4 (1998): 962–1023. www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/231294&lt;/ref&gt; In the article, the authors apply "relational pragmatics" to demonstrate the "dynamic interplay" of routine, purpose and judgement in explaining human [[Agency (sociology)|agency]].

In 2009 he was elected to the Chair of the Sociological Theory Section of the [[American Sociological Association]]. Also in 2009 he won the Lewis A.

'''Narrative paradigm''' is a communication theory conceptualized by 20th-century communication scholar [[Walter Fisher (professor)|Walter Fisher]]. The paradigm claims that all meaningful [[communication]] occurs via [[storytelling]] or [[Narrative|reporting of events]]. Humans participate as storytellers and observers of narratives. This theory further claims that stories are more persuasive than arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/blogs/militaryveterangamer/2014/01/18/narrative-paradigm-3-key-concepts|title=Narrative Paradigm 3: Key Concepts - Blog by militaryveterangamer - IGN|website=IGN|language=en|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://communicationtheory.org/the-narrative-paradigm/|title=The Narrative Paradigm|work=Communication Theory|access-date=2017-10-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially the narrative paradigm helps us to explain how humans are able to understand complex information through [[narrative]].

== Background ==
The Narrative Paradigm is a theory that suggests that human beings are natural storytellers and that a good story is more convincing than a good argument. Walter Fisher developed this theory as a solution making cohesive arguments. Fisher conceptualized the paradigm as a way to combat issues in the [[public sphere]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Walter R.|date=1984-03-01|title=Narration as a human communication paradigm: The case of public moral argument|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03637758409390180|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=51|issue=1|pages=1–22|doi=10.1080/03637758409390180|issn=0363-7751}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was that human beings were unable to make cohesive traditional arguments. At the time, rational world paradigm was the theory used to satisfy public controversies. He believed that stories have the power to include beginning, middle, and end of an argument and that the rational world paradigm fails to be effective in [[sensemaking]].&lt;ref name="Rowland 204–217"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowland|first=Robert C.|date=1988-09-01|title=The value of the rational world and narrative papradigms|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10510978809363250|journal=Central States Speech Journal|volume=39|issue=3-4|pages=204–217|doi=10.1080/10510978809363250|issn=0008-9575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fisher uses the term [[paradigm]] rather than [[theory]], meaning a paradigm is broader than a theory. Fisher stated, "There is no genre, including technical communication, that is not an episode in the story of life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Walter|date=1985|title=The Narrative Paradigm: An Elaboration|doi=10.1080/03637758509376117|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=52|issue=4|pages=347–367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fisher believed that humans are not rational and proposed that narrative is the basis of communication. According to this viewpoint, people communicate by telling/observing a persuasive story rather than by producing evidence or constructing a [[logical]] argument. The narrative paradigm is purportedly all-encompassing, allowing all communication to be looked at as a narrative even though it may not conform to the traditional literary requirements of a narrative. He states:
*Humans see the world as a set of stories. Each individual accepts stories that match his or her [[value (semiotics)|values]] and [[belief]]s, understood as [[common sense]].{{Sfn|Jameson|2001|p=}}
*Although people claim that their decisions are rational,{{Sfn|Jameson|2001|p=}} incorporating [[history]], [[culture]], and perceptions about the other people involved, all of these are subjective and incompletely understood.
*Narrative rationality requires stories to be [[probability|probable]], coherent and to exhibit [[fidelity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/967775008|title=Introducing communication theory : analysis and application|last=L.,|first=West, Richard|others=Turner, Lynn H.,|isbn=1259870324|edition=Sixth|location=New York, NY|oclc=967775008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Storytelling is one of the first language skills that children develop. It is universal across cultures and time.&lt;ref&gt;Langellier, Kristin M. "Personal narratives: Perspectives on theory and research." Text and Performance Quarterly 9.4 (1989): 243–276.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rational world paradigm==
Walter Fisher conceptualized the Narrative Paradigm in direct contrast to the Rational World Paradigm. "Fisher's interest in narrative developed out of his conclusion that the dominant model for explaining human communication—the rational-world paradigm—was inadequate."&lt;ref name="Rowland 204–217"/&gt; Rational World Paradigm suggest that an argument is most persuasive when it is logical. This theory is based in the teachings of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lucaites |first1=John Louis |last2=Condit |first2=Celeste Michelle |last3=Caudill |first3=Sally |title=Contemporary Rhetorical Theory: A Reader |date=Jan 1, 1999 |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York |page=268 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Aristotle, some statements are superior to others by virtue of their relationship to true knowledge. This view claims that:
* People are essentially thinking beings, basing their knowledge on evidence-based reasoning.
* Rational argument reflects [[knowledge]] and [[understanding]], and how the case is made. These qualities determine whether the argument is accepted, so long as the form matches the forum, which might be scientific, legal, philosophical, etc.
* The world is a set of logical puzzles that can be solved through reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/830512395|title=Interfaith dialogue : listening to communication theory|last=1959-|first=Brown, Daniel S.,|date=2013|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=0739178709|location=Lanham, Md.|oclc=830512395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narrative rationality==
Narrative rationality requires coherence and fidelity, which contribute to judgments about reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/456170121|title=Applying communication theory for professional life : a practical introduction|last=Marianne.|first=Dainton,|date=2011|publisher=SAGE Publications|others=Zelley, Elaine D.|isbn=9781412976916|edition=2nd|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|oclc=456170121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coherence===
Narrative [[Coherence (philosophical gambling strategy)|coherence]] is the degree to which a story makes sense. Coherent stories are internally consistent, with sufficient detail, reliable characters, and free of major surprises. The ability to assess coherence is learned and improves with experience. Individuals assess a story's coherence by comparing it with similar stories. The ultimate test of narrative coherence is whether the characters act in a reliable way. If characters show continuity throughout their thoughts, motives and actions, acceptance increases. However, characters behaving uncharacteristically destroys acceptance.{{sfn|Griffin|2009}}

===Fidelity===
Narrative fidelity is the degree to which a story fits into the observer's prior understanding. Stories with fidelity may influence their beliefs and values.{{sfn|Griffin|2009|p=304}}

Fisher set five criteria that affect a story's narrative fidelity:
*the values embedded in the story
*the connection between the story, and the espoused values

==Evaluation of reasoning systems==
Fisher's narrative paradigm offers an alternative to Aristotelian analysis, which dominates the field of rhetorical thinking. Narratives do not require training or expertise to evaluate. [[Common sense]] assesses narrative coherence and fidelity.{{Sfn|Griffin|2009|p=305}} Busselle and Bilandzic distinguish narrative rationality from realism, writing "It is remarkable that the power of narrative is not diminished by readers’ or viewers’ knowledge that the story is invented. On the contrary, successful stories—those that engage us most—often are both fictional and unrealistic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Busselle|first=Rick|last2=Bilandzic|first2=Helena|date=2008-05-01|title=Fictionality and Perceived Realism in Experiencing Stories: A Model of Narrative Comprehension and Engagement|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2885.2008.00322.x/abstract|journal=Communication Theory|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=256|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2885.2008.00322.x|issn=1468-2885|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] claimed that communications systems are formed through the ''savoir'' and ''pouvoir'' (knowledge and power) of the hierarchies that control access to the discourses. Hence, criteria for assessing the ''reliability'' and ''completeness'' of evidence, and whether the pattern of reasoning is sound are not absolutes but defined over time by those in positions of authority. This is particularly significant when the process of reasoning includes values and policy in addition to [[empirical]] data.

The narrative paradigm instead asserts that any individual can judge a story's merits as a basis for belief and action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Narration affects every aspect of each individual's life in verbal and nonverbal bids for someone to believe or act in a certain way. Even when a message appears abstract—i.e., the language is literal and not figurative—it is narration. This is because it is embedded in the storyteller's ongoing story and it invites observers to assess its value for their own lives.

Narrative rationality and narrative emotion are complementary within a narrative theory. The former considers how effectively the story conveys its meaning, as well as its implications. The latter considers the emotional reactions of the story's observers.&lt;ref name="Deslandes 335–372"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deslandes|first=Jeanne|date=2005-09-12|title=A Philosophy of Emoting|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/186846|journal=Journal of Narrative Theory|volume=34|issue=3|pages=335–372|doi=10.1353/jnt.2005.0003|issn=1548-9248}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Narrative emotion is an emotion felt for the sake of someone, or something, else.&lt;ref name="Deslandes 335–372"/&gt;

==Applications==
Narrative theory is an assessment framework within various fields of communication. Those who  use narrative theory within their research refer to it as a general way of viewing communication. The narrative paradigm is generally considered an interpretative theory of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spector-Mersel|first=Gabriela|date=2010-01-01|title=Narrative research: Time for a paradigm|url=http://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/ni.20.1.10spe|journal=Narrative Inquiry|language=en|volume=20|issue=1|pages=204–224|doi=10.1075/ni.20.1.10spe|issn=1387-6740}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an especially useful theory for teaching qualitative research methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=25592191|title=Rethinking Texts: Narrative and the Construction of Qualitative Research|first1=Karri A.|last1=Holley|first2=Julia|last2=Colyar|date=1 January 2009|publisher=|journal=Educational Researcher|volume=38|issue=9|pages=680–686|doi=10.3102/0013189x09351979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fisher’s theory has been considered for domains ranging from organizational communication to family interaction, to racism, and to advertising. McNamara proposed that the narrative paradigm can be used with military storytelling to enhance the perception of the United States armed services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/1d7ae8ad4dfb7a76b376382ca464d8dd/1.pdf|title=How the Narrative Paradigm Affects Military Stories - ProQuest|last=McNamara|first=Richard|date=May 8, 2014|website=search.proquest.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stutts and Barker, of [[Virginia Commonwealth University]], proposed that the Narrative Paradigm can be used to evaluate if a company's brand will be well received by consumers, by determining if the created narrative has coherence and fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stutts | first1 = Nancy B. | last2 = Barker | first2 = Randolph T. | year = 1999 | title = The use of narrative paradigm theory in assessing audience value conflict in image advertising | url = | journal = Management Communication Quarterly | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 209–244 | doi=10.1177/0893318999132002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers proposed using the narrative paradigm to evaluate ethical standards in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bush | first1 = Alan J. | last2 = Davies Bush | first2 = Victoria | year = 1994 | title = The Narrative Paradigm as a Perspective for Improving Ethical Evaluations of Advertisements | url = | journal = Journal of Advertising | volume = 23 | issue = 3| page = 31 | doi=10.1080/00913367.1994.10673448}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts used the narrative paradigm as a way to better understand the use of narrative in folklore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = Kathleen Glenister | year = 2004 | title = Texturing the narrative paradigm: Folklore and communication | url = | journal = Communication Quarterly | volume = 52 | issue = 2| pages = 129–142 | doi=10.1080/01463370409370186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hobart proposed using narrative theory as a way to interpret urban legends and other kinds of hoaxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hobart | first1 = Melissa | year = 2013 | title = My Best Friend's Brother's Cousin Knew This Guy Who…: Hoaxes, Legends, Warnings, and Fisher's Narrative Paradigm | url = | journal = Communication Teacher | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 90–93 | doi=10.1080/17404622.2013.770155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Narrative paradigm is also applicable when assessing multinational working relationships. Global interactions between groups with different backgrounds have the tendency to hinder group progress and building relationships. Over the past two decades, scholars conceptualize diversity in the workplace using several different theories. As companies continue to diversify, businesses look for communication models to help manage the complex structure of human relationships. Narrative paradigm serves as a communication technique that shows companies how the application of a good story could provide benefits in the workforce. Storytelling is a cross-cultural solution that establishes credibility and trust in relationships between workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barker|first=Randolph T.|last2=Gower|first2=Kim|date=2010-07-01|title=Strategic Application of Storytelling in Organizations: Toward Effective Communication in a Diverse World|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0021943610369782|journal=The Journal of Business Communication (1973)|language=en|volume=47|issue=3|pages=295–312|doi=10.1177/0021943610369782|issn=0021-9436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Narrative and politics===
One example of a study that used narrative theory more directly was conducted by Smith in 1984.  Smith looked at the fidelity and coherence of narratives presented as [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] [[Party platform|platforms]] in the United States and found that despite obvious differences, each party was able to maintain coherence and fidelity by remaining consistent in both structure and overarching party values.&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Narrative and health communication===
A study claimed that narrative features can be strategically altered by health communicators to affect the reader's identification. It found that similarities between the reader and the narrative's protagonist, but not the narrator's point of view, has a direct impact on the narrative's persuasiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Meng|last2=Bell|first2=Robert A.|date=August 2, 2016|title=Narrator Point of View and Persuasion in Health Narratives: The Role of Protagonist–Reader Similarity, Identification, and Self-Referencing|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10810730.2016.1177147|journal=Journal of Health Communication|volume=21|issue=8|pages=908–918|doi=10.1080/10810730.2016.1177147|pmid=27411000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Narrative and branding===
Narrative processing can create or enhance connections between a brand and an audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edson Escalas|first=|year=|title=Narrative Processing: Building Consumer Connections to Brands|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057740804701448|journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology|volume=14|pages=164–180|via=|doi=10.1207/s15327663jcp1401&amp;2_19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies and business use stories or brands that suggest a story to produce [[brand loyalty]]. Businesses invest heavily in creating a good story through advertising and public relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stutts|first=Nancy B.|last2=Barker|first2=Randolph T.|date=2016-08-15|title=The Use of Narrative Paradigm Theory in Assessing Audience Value Conflict in Image Advertising|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0893318999132002|journal=Management Communication Quarterly|language=en|volume=13|issue=2|pages=209–244|doi=10.1177/0893318999132002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In brand development, many marketers focus on defining a brand [[persona (marketing)|persona]] (typical user) before constructing a narrative for that brand. Character traits such as honesty, curiosity, flexibility and determination become embedded in the persona. Commitment to the associated behavioral implications can help the brand maintain consistency with its narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephen Herskovitz|first=|date=May 4, 2010|title=The essential brand persona: storytelling and branding|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/02756661011036673|journal=Journal of Business Strategy|volume=31|pages=21–28|via=|doi=10.1108/02756661011036673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics of the narrative paradigm mainly contend that it is not as universally applicable as Fisher suggests. For example, Rowland asserted that it should be applied strictly to communication that fits classic narrative patterns to avoid undermining its credibility.{{sfn|Rowland|1989}}

Other critiques include issues of conservative bias. Kirkwood stated that Fisher's logic of good reasons focuses only on prevailing issues&lt;ref&gt;Kirkwood, William G. (1992) "Narrative and the Rhetoric of Possibility" (Vol. 59, Issue 1) pp30–47.&lt;/ref&gt; but does not see all the ways that stories can promote [[social change]].&lt;ref name="Turner, Lynn H. 2007"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=qEhTpwAACAAJ}}|title=Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application|last1=West|first1=Richard L.|last2=Turner|first2=Lynn H.|date=December 2013|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-0-07-132647-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some ways, both Kirkwood and Fisher agree that this observation is more of an extension to the theory than a critique.

Stroud considered "multivalent" narratives that include seemingly contradictory values or positions that force a reader to reconstruct their meaning, thereby enabling positive judgments of narrative fidelity and the adoption of new values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stroud | first1 = Scott R | year = 2002 | title = Multivalent Narratives: Extending the Narrative Paradigm with Insights from Ancient Indian Philosophical Texts | url = | journal = Western Journal of Communication | volume = 66 | issue = 3| pages = 369–393 | doi=10.1080/10570310209374742}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some forms of communication are not narrative in the way that Fisher maintains. Many [[science fiction]] and fantasy novels/movies challenge rather than conform to common values.&lt;ref name="Turner, Lynn H. 2007" /&gt;

The narrative approach does not provide a more democratic structure compared to the one imposed by the rational world paradigm. Nor does it offer a complete alternative to that paradigm.{{sfn|Rowland|1989|p=39}}
The narrative paradigm gained attention from poststructuralist education theorists for appealing to notions of truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=d498cc1b-1b67-4073-8139-f40e460ba9cd%40sessionmgr101&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=91821607&amp;db=ofm|title=Narrative Theory Versus Truth: A Poststructuralist Reading in Environmental Education.|last=Hardy|first=Joy|date=June 1, 2012|website=Ebsco Host|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related theories==
===Rhetoric theory===
The narrative paradigm incorporates both the pathos and logos form of rhetoric theory. Rhetoric theory was formulated by Aristotle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Michel|date=2012-09-11|title=Aristotle’s Rhetoric|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11245-012-9132-0|journal=Topoi|volume=32|pages=249–252|doi=10.1007/s11245-012-9132-0|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defines rhetoric as: the available means of persuasion.&lt;ref name="Turner, Lynn H. 2007" /&gt; It includes two assumptions.
* Effective public speakers must consider their audience.
* Effective public speakers supply proofs.
Aristotle divided public speaking into three parts: the speaker, the subject and the audience. He considered the audience the most important, determining the speech’s end and object. Therefore, audience analysis, which is the process of evaluating an audience and its background is essential.

In the second assumption, Aristotle’s proof refers to the means of persuasion. And these three proof types are [[Ethos]], [[Pathos]] and [[Logos]].
* Ethos: The perceived character, intelligence and goodwill of a speaker as they become revealed through his or her speech. 
* Logos: The logic proof that speakers employ. 
* Pathos: The emotions that are drawn out of listeners. 
Rhetoric theory can be applied in multiple areas, such as in the social/environmental report,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Higgins|first=Colin|year=September 2012|title=Ethos, logos, pathos: Strategies of persuasion in social/environmental reports|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0155998212000178|journal=Accounting Forum|volume=36|pages=194–208|via=|doi=10.1016/j.accfor.2012.02.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Facebook]] post, etc.

===Situation models===
When people experience a story, the comprehension phase is where they form a mental representation of the text.&lt;ref&gt;Zwann, Rolf. "Current Directions In Psychological Science." Current Directions In Psychological Science. n. 15. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a mental representation is called a situation model. Situation models are representations of the state of affairs described in a text rather than of the text itself. Much of the research suggests that observers behave as though they are in the story rather than outside of it. This supports Fisher’s model that narrative components supported by good reasons are related to components in situation models.

====Space====
Situation models represent relevant aspects of the narrative's environment. Objects that are spatially close to observers are generally more relevant than more distant objects. The same holds for situation models. Observers are similarly slower to recognize words denoting objects distant from a protagonist than those close to the protagonist.{{sfn|Glenberg|Meyer|Lindem|1987|p=}} When observers have extensive knowledge of the spatial layout of the story setting (e.g., a building), they update their representations according to the location and goals of the protagonist. They have the fastest mental access to the room that the protagonist is close to. For example, they can more readily say whether two objects are in the same room if the room mentioned is close to the protagonist. The interpretation of the meaning of a verb denoting the movement of people or objects in space, such as to approach, depends on their situation models. The interpretation of observers also depends on the size of the landmark and the speed of the figure. Observers behave as if they are actually present in the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zwaan|first=Rolf A.|date=1999|title=Situation Models: The Mental Leap into Imagined Worlds|jstor=20182546|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=8|issue=1|pages=15–18|doi=10.2307/20182546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Goals and causation====
In one study observers recognized goals yet to be accomplished by the protagonist more quickly than goals that had just been accomplished. When Keefe and McDaniel presented subjects with sentences such as "after standing through a 3-hour debate, the tired speaker walked over to his chair (and sat down)" and then with probe words (e.g., "sat").&lt;ref&gt;Zwann, Rolf. "Current Directions In Psychological Science." Current Directions In Psychological Science. n. page. Print. Keefe and McDaniel (1993 )&lt;/ref&gt; Subjects took about the same amount of time to name sat when the clause about the speaker sitting down was omitted and when it was included. Moreover, naming times were significantly faster in both of these conditions than in a control condition, in which it was implied that the speaker remained standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keefe|first=D.E.|last2=Mcdaniel|first2=M.A.|title=The Time Course and Durability of Predictive Inferences|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0749596X83710247|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|volume=32|issue=4|pages=446–463|doi=10.1006/jmla.1993.1024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Obsessive–compulsive disorder''' ('''OCD''') is a [[mental disorder]] where people feel the need to check things repeatedly, perform [[compulsive behavior|certain routines repeatedly]] (called "rituals"), or have [[intrusive thoughts|certain thoughts repeatedly]] (called "obsessions").&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; People are unable to control either the thoughts or the activities for more than a short period of time.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; Common activities include [[hand washing]], counting of things, and checking to see if a door is locked.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; Some may have difficulty throwing things out.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; These activities occur to such a degree that the person's daily life is negatively affected.&lt;ref name=NIH2015&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)?|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-ocd/index.shtml|website=U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH)|author=The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)|date=January 2016|accessdate=24 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160723194024/http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-ocd/index.shtml|archivedate=23 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often takes up more than an hour a day.&lt;ref name=DSM5&gt;{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders : DSM-5|date=2013|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|location=Washington|isbn=978-0-89042-555-8|pages=237–242|edition=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most adults realize that the behaviors do not make sense.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; The condition is associated with [[tic disorders|tics]], [[anxiety disorder]], and an increased risk of [[suicide]].&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ang2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Angelakis|first1=I|last2=Gooding|first2=P|last3=Tarrier|first3=N|last4=Panagioti|first4=M|title=Suicidality in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD): A systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=[[Clinical Psychology Review]]|publisher=[[Pergamon Press]]|location=Oxford, England|date=25 March 2015|volume=39|pages=1–15|pmid=25875222|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2015.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cause is unknown.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; There appear to be some [[genetics|genetic]] components with both [[identical twins]] more often affected than both non-identical twins.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; Risk factors include a history of [[child abuse]] or other [[stress (psychological)|stress]]-inducing event.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; Some cases have been documented to occur following [[infection]]s.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; The diagnosis is based on the symptoms and requires ruling out other drug related or medical causes.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; Rating scales such as the [[Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale]] (Y-BOCS) can be used to assess the severity.&lt;ref name="Fenske_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fenske JN, Schwenk TL | title = Obsessive compulsive disorder: diagnosis and management | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 80 | issue = 3 | pages = 239–45 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19621834 | doi =  | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/2009/0801/p239.html | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140512222223/http://www.aafp.org/afp/2009/0801/p239.html | archivedate = 12 May 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other disorders with similar symptoms include anxiety disorder, [[major depressive disorder]], [[eating disorders]], [[tic disorders]], and [[obsessive–compulsive personality disorder]].&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment and prognosis --&gt;
Treatment involves [[psychotherapy|counseling]], such as [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT), and sometimes [[antidepressants]] such as [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors|selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs) or [[clomipramine]].&lt;ref name=NEJM2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ve2014 /&gt; CBT for OCD involves increasing exposure to what causes the problems while not allowing the repetitive behavior to occur.&lt;ref name=NEJM2014&gt;{{cite journal | author = Grant JE | title = Clinical practice: Obsessive-compulsive disorder. | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 371 | issue = 7 | pages = 646–53 | date = 14 August 2014 | pmid = 25119610 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMcp1402176}}&lt;/ref&gt; While clomipramine appears to work as well as SSRIs, it has greater side effects so is typically reserved as a second line treatment.&lt;ref name=NEJM2014 /&gt; [[Atypical antipsychotic]]s may be useful when used in addition to an SSRI in treatment-resistant cases but are also associated with an increased risk of side effects.&lt;ref name=Ve2014&gt;{{cite journal |last=Veale |first= D|last2= Miles|first2=S |last3=Smallcombe |first3= N|last4=Ghezai |first4=H |last5=Goldacre |first5=B|last6=Hodsoll |first6=J |date=29 November 2014 |title=Atypical antipsychotic augmentation in SSRI treatment refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis. |journal=BMC Psychiatry|volume= 14|issue= |pages=317 |doi=10.1186/s12888-014-0317-5 |pmid=25432131 |pmc=4262998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dec2010&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Decloedt EH, Stein DJ | title = Current trends in drug treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat | volume = 6 | issue = |pages = 233–42 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20520787 | pmc = 2877605 | doi = 10.2147/NDT.S3149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without treatment, the condition often lasts decades.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
OCD can present with a wide variety of symptoms. Certain groups of symptoms usually occur together. These groups are sometimes viewed as dimensions or clusters that may reflect an underlying process. The standard assessment tool for OCD, the [[Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale]] (Y-BOCS), has 13 predefined categories of symptoms. These symptoms fit into three to five groupings.&lt;ref name="Leckman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leckman|first1=JF|last2=Bloch|first2=MH|last3=King|first3=RA|title=Symptom dimensions and subtypes of obsessive-compulsive disorder: a developmental perspective.|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|date=2009|volume=11|issue=1|pages=21–33|pmid=19432385|pmc=3181902}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[meta analysis|meta analytic]] review of symptom structures found a four factor structure (grouping) to be most reliable.  The observed groups included a "symmetry factor", a "forbidden thoughts factor", a "cleaning factor", and a "hoarding factor".  The "symmetry factor" correlated highly with obsessions related to ordering, counting, and symmetry, as well as repeating compulsions.  The "forbidden thoughts factor" correlated highly with intrusive and distressing thoughts of a violent, religious, or sexual nature. The "cleaning factor" correlated highly with obsessions about contamination and compulsions related to cleaning. The "hoarding factor" only involved hoarding related obsessions and compulsions, and was identified as being distinct from other symptom groupings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bloch|first1=MH|last2=Landeros-Weisenberger|first2=A|last3=Rosario|first3=MC|last4=Pittenger|first4=C|last5=Leckman|first5=JF|title=Meta-analysis of the symptom structure of obsessive-compulsive disorder.|journal=[[The American Journal of Psychiatry]]|date=December 2008|volume=165|issue=12|pages=1532–42|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2008.08020320|pmid=18923068|pmc=3972003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While OCD has been considered a homogenous disorder from a neuropsychological perspective, many of the putative neuropsychological deficits may be due to comorbid disorders.  Furthermore, some subtypes have been associated with improvement in performance on certain tasks such as pattern recognition (washing subtype) and spatial working memory (obsessive thought subtype). Subgroups have also been distinguished by neuroimaging findings and treatment response.  Neuroimaging studies on this have been too few, and the subtypes examined have differed too much to draw any conclusions.  On the other hand, subtype dependent treatment response has been studied, and the hoarding subtype has consistently responded least to treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKay|first1=D|last2=Abramowitz|first2=JS|last3=Calamari|first3=JE|last4=Kyrios|first4=M|last5=Radomsky|first5=A|last6=Sookman|first6=D|last7=Taylor|first7=S|last8=Wilhelm|first8=S|title=A critical evaluation of obsessive-compulsive disorder subtypes: symptoms versus mechanisms.|journal=[[Clinical Psychology Review]]|date=July 2004|volume=24|issue=3|pages=283–313|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2004.04.003|pmid=15245833}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obsessions are thoughts that recur and persist, despite efforts to ignore or confront them.&lt;ref name=Review10&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Y|last1=Markarian|first2=MJ|last2=Larson|first3=MA|last3=Aldea|first4=SA|last4=Baldwin|first5=D|last5=Good|first6=A|last6=Berkeljon|first7=TK|last7=Murphy|first8=EA|last8=Storch|first9=D|last9=McKay| title = Multiple pathways to functional impairment in obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = [[Clinical Psychology Review]] |volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 78–88 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 19853982 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2009.09.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with OCD frequently perform tasks, or [[Compulsive behavior|compulsions]], to seek relief from obsession-related anxiety. Within and among individuals, the initial obsessions, or intrusive thoughts, vary in their clarity and vividness. A relatively vague obsession could involve a general sense of disarray or tension accompanied by a belief that life cannot proceed as normal while the imbalance remains. A more intense obsession could be a preoccupation with the thought or image of someone close to them dying{{sfn|Baer|2001|pp=33, 78}}{{sfn|Baer|2001|p=xiv}} or intrusions related to "[[Relationship obsessive–compulsive disorder|relationship rightness]]".&lt;ref name = Doron2013&gt;{{cite journal |first1=G|last1=Doron|first2=O|last2=Szepsenwol|first3=E|last3=Karp|first4=N|last4=Gal| title = Obsessing About Intimate-Relationships: Testing the Double Relationship-Vulnerability Hypothesis | journal = [[Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry]] |volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 433–440 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23792752 | doi = 10.1016/j.jbtep.2013.05.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other obsessions concern the possibility that someone or something other than oneself—such as God, the Devil, or disease—will harm either the person with OCD or the people or things that the person cares about. Other individuals with OCD may experience the sensation of invisible protrusions emanating from their bodies, or have the feeling that inanimate objects are ensouled.&lt;ref name=Mash&gt;{{cite book|first1=Eric J.|last1=Mash|first2=David A.|last2=Wolfe|title=Abnormal child psychology|edition=3|date=2005|publisher=[[The Thomson Corporation|Thomson Wadsworth]]|location=[[Belmont, California]]|page=197|isbn= 978-1305105423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people with OCD experience [[sexual obsessions]] that may involve intrusive thoughts or images of "kissing, touching, fondling, [[oral sex]], [[anal sex]], intercourse, [[incest]], and [[rape]]" with "strangers, acquaintances, parents, children, family members, friends, coworkers, animals, and religious figures", and can include "[[heterosexual]] or [[homosexual]] content" with persons of any age.&lt;ref name="Osgood"&gt;{{cite web|first=Deborah|last=Osgood-Hynes|url=http://www.raminader.com/PDFs%20Uploaded/OCD%20-%20Thinking%20Bad%20Thoughts.pdf|title=Thinking Bad Thoughts|publisher=MGH/McLean OCD Institute|location=Belmont, Massachusetts|accessdate=December 30, 2006|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115230001/http://raminader.com/PDFs%20Uploaded/OCD%20-%20Thinking%20Bad%20Thoughts.pdf |archive-date=November 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other intrusive, unpleasant thoughts or images, some disquieting sexual thoughts at times are normal, but people with OCD may attach extraordinary significance to the thoughts. For example, obsessive fears about [[sexual orientation]] can appear to the person with OCD, and even to those around them, as a crisis of [[sexual identity]].&lt;ref name="ItMoved"&gt;{{cite web|first=Steven|last=Phillipson|url=http://www.ocdonline.com/articlephillipson7.php|title=I Think It Moved|website=OCDOnline.com|publisher=Center for Cognitive-Behavioral Psychotherapy|location=New York City|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218215734/http://www.ocdonline.com/articlephillipson7.php |archive-date=December 18, 2008|accessdate=May 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sexfears"&gt;{{cite web|first=Mark-Ameen|last=Johnson|url=http://www.brainphysics.com/yourenotgay.php|title=I'm Gay and You're Not : Understanding Homosexuality Fears|website=brainphysics.com|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505042912/http://www.brainphysics.com/yourenotgay.php |archive-date=5 May 2009|accessdate=14 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the doubt that accompanies OCD leads to uncertainty regarding whether one might act on the troubling thoughts, resulting in self-criticism or self-loathing.&lt;ref name="Osgood" /&gt;

Most people with OCD understand that their notions do not correspond with reality; however, they feel that they must act as though their notions are correct. For example, an individual who engages in [[compulsive hoarding]] might be inclined to treat inorganic matter as if it had the sentience or rights of living organisms, while accepting that such behavior is irrational on a more intellectual level. There is a debate as to whether or not hoarding should be considered with other OCD symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murphy|first1=DL|last2=Timpano|first2=KR|last3=Wheaton|first3=MG|last4=Greenberg|first4=BD|last5=Miguel|first5=EC|title=Obsessive-compulsive disorder and its related disorders: a reappraisal of obsessive-compulsive spectrum concepts.|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|date=2010|volume=12|issue=2|pages=131–48|pmid=20623919|pmc=3181955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OCD sometimes manifests without overt compulsions, referred to as Primarily Obsessional OCD. OCD without overt compulsions could, by one estimate, characterize as many as 50 percent to 60 percent of OCD cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Myrna M.|last1=Weisman|title = The cross national epidemiology of obsessive–compulsive disorder | journal = New Developments in Obsessive-Compulsive and Spectrum Disorders|  volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 6–9 |date = May 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Derma me.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Dermatillomania|Skin-picking disorder]]]]

Some people with OCD perform compulsive rituals because they inexplicably feel they have to, while others act compulsively so as to mitigate the anxiety that stems from particular obsessive thoughts. The person might feel that these actions somehow either will prevent a dreaded event from occurring or will push the event from their thoughts. In any case, the individual's reasoning is so [[idiosyncratic]] or distorted that it results in significant distress for the individual with OCD or for those around them. Excessive [[excoriation disorder|skin picking]], [[trichotillomania|hair-pulling]], [[nail biting]], and other body-focused repetitive behavior disorders are all on the [[obsessive–compulsive spectrum]].&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; Some individuals with OCD are aware that their behaviors are not rational, but feel compelled to follow through with them to fend off feelings of panic or dread.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Highlights of Changes from DSM-IV-TR to DSM-5|url=http://www.dsm5.org/documents/changes%20from%20dsm-iv-tr%20to%20dsm-5.pdf|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|page=7|year=2013|accessdate=12 Apr 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019204551/http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/changes%20from%20dsm-iv-tr%20to%20dsm-5.pdf|archivedate=19 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some common compulsions include hand washing, cleaning, checking things (e.g., locks on doors), repeating actions (e.g., turning on and off switches), ordering items in a certain way, and requesting reassurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Boyd MA |title=Psychiatric Nursing |journal=Issues in Mental Health Nursing |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=13–26 |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3UUuXw7ISM0C&amp;pg=PA418|isbn=978-0-397-55178-1|pmid=8119793 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compulsions are different from [[tics]] (such as touching, tapping, rubbing, or blinking)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Storch|title=Obsessive-compulsive disorder in youth with and without a chronic tic disorder|url=http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/17345600|journal=Depression and Anxiety|year=2008|volume=25|issue=9|pages=761–767|doi=10.1002/da.20304|pmid=17345600|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[stereotypic movement disorder|stereotyped movements]] (such as head banging, body rocking, or self-biting), which usually aren't as complex and aren't precipitated by obsessions.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; It can sometimes be difficult to tell the difference between compulsions and complex tics.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; About 10% to 40% of individuals with OCD also have a lifetime tic disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Conelea|year=2014|title=Tic-related obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): phenomenology and treatment outcome in the Pediatric OCD Treatment Study II|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|volume=53|issue=12|pages=1308–16|doi=10.1016/j.jaac.2014.09.014|pmid=25457929|display-authors=etal|pmc=4254546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People rely on compulsions as an escape from their obsessive thoughts; however, they are aware that the relief is only temporary, that the intrusive thoughts will soon return. Some people use compulsions to avoid situations that may trigger their obsessions. Although some people do certain things over and over again, they do not necessarily perform these actions compulsively. For example, bedtime routines, learning a new skill, and religious practices are not compulsions. Whether or not behaviors are compulsions or mere habit depends on the context in which the behaviors are performed. For example, arranging and ordering DVDs for eight hours a day would be expected of one who works in a video store, but would seem abnormal in other situations. In other words, habits tend to bring efficiency to one's life, while compulsions tend to disrupt it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/guide/obsessive-compulsive-disorder.|title=Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, (2005) |accessdate=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the anxiety and fear that typically accompanies OCD, sufferers may spend hours performing such compulsions every day. In such situations, it can be hard for the person to fulfil their work, family, or social roles. In some cases, these behaviors can also cause adverse physical symptoms. For example, people who obsessively wash their hands with [[antibacterial soap]] and hot water can make their skin red and raw with [[dermatitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no2/larson.htm |title=Hygiene of the Skin: When Is Clean Too Clean? Subtopic: "Skin Barrier Properties and Effect of Hand Hygiene Practices", Paragraph 5. |accessdate=26 March 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421205614/http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no2/larson.htm |archivedate=21 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People with OCD can use rationalizations to explain their behavior; however, these rationalizations do not apply to the overall behavior but to each instance individually. For example, a person compulsively checking the front door may argue that the time taken and stress caused by one more check of the front door is much less than the time and stress associated with being robbed, and thus checking is the better option. In practice, after that check, the person is ''still'' not sure and deems it is ''still'' better to perform one more check, and this reasoning can continue as long as necessary.

=== Insight ===
The DSM-V contains three specifiers for the level of insight in OCD.  Good or fair insight is characterized by the acknowledgment that obsessive-compulsive beliefs are or may not be true.  Poor insight is characterized by the belief that obsessive-complsive beliefs are probably true.  Absence of insight make obsessive-compulsive beliefs [[delusion]]al thoughts, and occurs in about 4% of people with OCD.&lt;ref name="Sadock"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ruiz|first1=P|last2=Sadock|first2=B|last3=Sadock|first3=V|title=Kaplan and Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry|publisher=LWW|location=95218|isbn=978-1-4511-0047-1|edition=10th|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Overvalued ideas ===
Some people with OCD exhibit what is known as ''overvalued ideas''. In such cases, the person with OCD will truly be uncertain whether the fears that cause them to perform their compulsions are irrational or not. After some discussion, it is possible to convince the individual that their fears may be unfounded. It may be more difficult to do [[Exposure and response prevention|ERP therapy]] on such people because they may be unwilling to cooperate, at least initially. There are severe cases in which the person has an unshakeable belief in the context of OCD that is difficult to differentiate from [[psychosis|psychotic disorders]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Dwyer, Anne-Marie Carter, Obsessive–compulsive disorder and delusions revisited, The British Journal of Psychiatry (2000) 176: 281–284&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cognitive performance ===
A 2013 meta-analysis reported that people with OCD to have mild but wide-ranging cognitive deficits; significantly regarding [[spatial memory]], to a lesser extent with [[verbal memory]], [[Verbal fluency test|fluency]], executive function, and processing speed, while auditory attention was not significantly affected.&lt;ref name=shin&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shin NY, Lee TY, Kim E, Kwon JS | title = Cognitive functioning in obsessive-compulsive disorder: a meta-analysis | journal = Psychological Medicine | pages = 1–10 | date = 19 July 2013 | pmid = 23866289 | doi = 10.1017/S0033291713001803 | volume=44| issue = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People with OCD show impairment in formulating an organizational strategy for coding information, set-shifting, and motor and cognitive inhibition.&lt;ref name="Aydin"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Çetinay Aydın P, Güleç Öyekçin D | title = Cognitive functions in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder | journal = Turk Psikiyatri Dergisi (Turkish Journal of Psychiatry) | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 266–74 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24310094 | doi=10.5080/u7172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
{{Main|Cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder}}
The cause is unknown.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; Both environmental and genetic factors are believed to play a role. Risk factors include a history of [[child abuse]] or other [[stress (psychological)|stress]]-inducing event.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt;

=== Genetics ===
There appear to be some [[genetics|genetic]] components with [[identical twins]] more often affected than non-identical twins.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; Further, individuals with OCD are more likely to have first-degree family members exhibiting the same disorders than do matched controls. In cases where OCD develops during childhood, there is a much stronger familial link in the disorder than cases in which OCD develops later in adulthood. In general, genetic factors account for 45–65% of the variability in OCD symptoms in children diagnosed with the disorder.&lt;ref name="pmid19665647"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Abramowitz JS, Taylor S, McKay D | title = Obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = Lancet | volume = 374 | issue = 9688 | pages = 491–9 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19665647 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60240-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 study found evidence supporting the possibility of a heritable risk for OCD.&lt;ref name="Menzies et al, 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Menzies L, Achard S, Chamberlain SR, Fineberg N, Chen CH, del Campo N, Sahakian BJ, Robbins TW, Bullmore E | title = Neurocognitive endophenotypes of obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = Brain | volume = 130 | issue = Pt 12 | pages = 3223–36 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17855376 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awm205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been postulated by [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] that moderate versions of compulsive behavior may have had evolutionary advantages. Examples would be moderate constant checking of hygiene, the hearth or the environment for enemies. Similarly, [[hoarding]] may have had evolutionary advantages.

=== Cognitive models ===

Generally two categories of models for OCD have been postulated, the first involving deficits in executive function, and the second involving deficits in modulatory control.  The first category of executive dysfunction is based on the observed structural and functional abnormalities in the dlPFC, striatum, and thalamus.  The second category involving dysfunctional modulatory control primarily relies on observed functional and structural differences in the ACC, mPFC and OFC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedlander|first1=L|last2=Desrocher|first2=M|title=Neuroimaging studies of obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults and children.|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|date=January 2006|volume=26|issue=1|pages=32–49|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2005.06.010|pmid=16242823}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stern|first1=ER|last2=Taylor|first2=SF|title=Cognitive neuroscience of obsessive-compulsive disorder.|journal=The Psychiatric Clinics of North America|date=September 2014|volume=37|issue=3|pages=337–52|doi=10.1016/j.psc.2014.05.004|pmid=25150566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One proposed model suggests that dysfunction in the [[orbitofrontal cortex|OFC]] leads to improper valuation of behaviors and decreased behavioral control, while the observed alterations in amygdala activations leads to exaggerated fears and representations of negative stimuli.&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wood|first1=J|last2=Ahmari|first2=SE|title=A Framework for Understanding the Emerging Role of Corticolimbic-Ventral Striatal Networks in OCD-Associated Repetitive Behaviors.|journal=Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience|date=2015|volume=9|pages=171|doi=10.3389/fnsys.2015.00171|pmid=26733823|pmc=4681810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the heterogeneity of OCD symptoms, studies differentiating between symptoms have been performed. Symptom specific neuroimaging abnormalities include the hyperactivity of caudate and ACC in checking rituals, while finding increased activity of cortical and cerebellar regions in contamination related symptoms. Neuroimaging differentiating between content of intrusive thoughts have found differences between aggressive as opposed to taboo thoughts, finding increased connectivity of the amygdala, ventral striatum, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex in aggressive symptoms, while observing increased connectivity between the ventral striatum and insula in sexual/religious intrusive thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nakao|first1=Tomohiro|last2=Okada|first2=Kayo|last3=Kanba|first3=Shigenobu|title=Neurobiological model of obsessive-compulsive disorder: Evidence from recent neuropsychological and neuroimaging findings|journal=Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|date=August 2014|volume=68|issue=8|pages=587–605|doi=10.1111/pcn.12195|pmid=24762196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another model proposes that affective dysregulation links excessive reliance on habit based action selection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barahona-Corrêa|first1=JB|last2=Camacho|first2=M|last3=Castro-Rodrigues|first3=P|last4=Costa|first4=R|last5=Oliveira-Maia|first5=AJ|title=From Thought to Action: How the Interplay Between Neuroscience and Phenomenology Changed Our Understanding of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|date=2015|volume=6|pages=1798|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01798|pmid=26635696|pmc=4655583}}&lt;/ref&gt; with compulsions.  This is supported by the observation that those with OCD demonstrate decreased activation of the [[ventral striatum]] when anticipating monetary  reward, as well as increase functional connectivity between the VS and the OFC.  Furthermore, those with OCD demonstrate reduced performance in pavlovian fear extinction tasks, hyper responsiveness in the amygdala to fearful stimuli, and hypo-resonsiveness in the amygdala when exposed to positively valanced stimuli.  Stimulation of the [[nucleus accumbens]] has also been observed to effectively alleviate both obsessions and compulsions, supporting the role of affective dysregulation in generating both.&lt;ref name="Wood" /&gt;

=== Neurobiological ===

From the observation of the efficacy of antidepressants in OCD, a serotonin hypothesis of OCD has been formulated. Studies of peripheral markers of serotonin, as well as challenges with proserotonergic compounds have yielded inconsistent results, including evidence pointing towards basal hyperactivity of serotonergic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Kenneth L|title=Neuropsychopharmacology : the fifth generation of progress : an official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology|date=2002|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=978-0-7817-2837-9|pages=1609–1610|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serotonin receptor and transporter binding studies have yielded conflicting results, including higher and lower serotonin receptor [[5-HT2A]] and [[serotonin transporter]] binding potentials that were normalized by treatment with SSRIs. Despite inconsistencies in the types of abnormalities found, evidence points towards dysfunction of serotonergic systems in OCD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Muller |first1=Christian P |last2=Jacobs |first2=Barry L |author3=A Dijk|author4=A Klompmakers|author5=D Denys|title=Handbook of the behavioral neurobiology of serotonin|date=2009|publisher=Academic|location=London|isbn=978-0-12-374634-4|pages=547–558|edition=1st|chapter=4.4 The Serotonergic System in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orbitofrontal cortex]] overactivity is attenuated in people who have successfully responded to [[SSRI]] medication, a result believed to be caused by increased stimulation of [[serotonin]] receptors [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT2A]] and [[serotonin receptor|5-HT2C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kim KW, Lee DY | title = Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Associated With a Left Orbitofrontal Infarct | journal = Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 88–89 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11884667 | doi = 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.14.1.88 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A complex relationship between dopamine and OCD has been observed. Although antipsychotics, which act by antagonizing dopamine receptors may improve some cases of OCD, they frequently exacerbate others.  Antipsychotics, in the low doses used to treat OCD, may actually increased the release of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex, through inhibiting autoreceptors. Further complicating things is the efficacy of amphetamines, decreased [[dopamine transporter]] activity observed in OCD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wood|first1=Jesse|last2=Ahmari|first2=Susanne E.|title=A Framework for Understanding the Emerging Role of Corticolimbic-Ventral Striatal Networks in OCD-Associated Repetitive Behaviors|journal=Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience|date=17 December 2015|volume=9|doi=10.3389/fnsys.2015.00171|pmc=4681810|issn=1662-5137|pmid=26733823}}&lt;/ref&gt; and low levels of D2 binding in the striatum.&lt;ref name="glutamate" /&gt;  Furthermore, increased dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens after deep brain stimulation correlates with improvement in symptoms, pointing to reduced dopamine release in the striatum playing a role in generating symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graat|first1=I|last2=Figee|first2=M|last3=Denys|first3=D|editor1-last=Pittinger|editor1-first=C|title=Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: Phenomenology, Pathophysiology and Treatment|publisher=Oxford University Press|chapter=Neurotransmitter Dysregulation in OCD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abnormalities in glutaminergic neurotransmission have implicated in OCD. Findings such as increased cerebrospinal glutamate, less consistent abnormalities observed in neuroimaging studies, and the efficacy of some glutaminergic drugs such as [[riluzole]] have implicated glutamate in OCD.&lt;ref name="glutamate"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pittenger|first1=Christopher|last2=Bloch|first2=Michael H.|last3=Williams|first3=Kyle|title=GLUTAMATE ABNORMALITIES IN OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER: NEUROBIOLOGY, PATHOPHYSIOLOGY, AND TREATMENT|journal=Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics|date=3 March 2017|volume=132|issue=3|pages=314–332|doi=10.1016/j.pharmthera.2011.09.006|pmc=3205262|issn=0163-7258|pmid=21963369}}&lt;/ref&gt;  OCD has been associated with reduced [[N-Acetylaspartic acid]] in the mPFC, which is thought to reflect neuron density or functionality, although the exact interpretation has not been established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aoki|first1=Y|last2=Aoki|first2=A|last3=Suwa|first3=H|title=Reduction of N-acetylaspartate in the medial prefrontal cortex correlated with symptom severity in obsessive-compulsive disorder: meta-analyses of (1)H-MRS studies.|journal=Translational Psychiatry|date=14 August 2012|volume=2|issue=8|pages=e153|doi=10.1038/tp.2012.78|pmid=22892718|pmc=3432192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
Formal diagnosis may be performed by a psychologist, psychiatrist, clinical social worker, or other licensed mental health professional. To be diagnosed with OCD, a person must have obsessions, compulsions, or both, according to the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM). The Quick Reference to the 2000 edition of the DSM states that several features characterize [[Clinical significance|clinically significant]] obsessions and compulsions. Such obsessions, the DSM says, are recurrent and persistent thoughts, [[impulse (psychology)|impulses]] or images that are experienced as intrusive and that cause marked anxiety or distress. These thoughts, impulses or images are of a degree or type that lies outside the [[Normality (behavior)|normal]] range of worries about conventional problems.&lt;ref name="Quick"&gt;''Quick Reference to the Diagnostic Criteria from DSM-IV-TR''. Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; A person may attempt to ignore or [[Thought suppression|suppress]] such obsessions, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action, and will tend to recognize the obsessions as idiosyncratic or irrational.

Compulsions become clinically significant when a person feels driven to perform them in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly, and when the person consequently feels or causes significant distress. Therefore, while many people who do not suffer from OCD may perform actions often associated with OCD (such as ordering items in a pantry by height), the distinction with clinically significant OCD lies in the fact that the person who suffers from OCD ''must'' perform these actions, otherwise they will experience significant psychological distress. These behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these activities are not logically or practically connected to the issue, or they are excessive. In addition, at some point during the course of the disorder, the individual must realize that their obsessions or compulsions are unreasonable or excessive.

Moreover, the obsessions or compulsions must be time-consuming (taking up more than one hour per day) or cause impairment in social, occupational or scholastic functioning.&lt;ref name="Quick" /&gt; It is helpful to quantify the severity of symptoms and impairment before and during treatment for OCD. In addition to the peron's estimate of the time spent each day harboring obsessive-compulsive thoughts or behaviors, concrete tools can be used to gauge the people’s condition. This may be done with rating scales, such as the [[Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale]] (Y-BOCS). With measurements like these, psychiatric consultation can be more appropriately determined because it has been standardized.&lt;ref name="Fenske_2009" /&gt;

OCD is sometimes placed in a group of disorders called the [[obsessive–compulsive spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Starcevic|first1=V|last2=Janca|first2=A|title=Obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders: still in search of the concept-affirming boundaries.|journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry|date=January 2011|volume=24|issue=1|pages=55–60|pmid=20827198|doi=10.1097/yco.0b013e32833f3b58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Differential diagnosis ===
OCD is often confused with the separate condition [[obsessive–compulsive personality disorder]] (OCPD). OCD is [[egodystonic]], meaning that the disorder is incompatible with the sufferer's [[self-concept]].&lt;ref name="Aardema, F. 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Aardema&gt;{{cite journal | author = Aardema F., O'Connor |year = 2003 | title = Seeing white bears that are not there: Inference processes in obsessions | url = | journal = Journal of Cognitive Psychotherapy | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 23–37 | doi=10.1891/jcop.17.1.23.58270}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because ego dystonic disorders go against a person's self-concept, they tend to cause much distress. OCPD, on the other hand, is [[egosyntonic]]—marked by the person's acceptance that the characteristics and behaviours displayed as a result are compatible with their [[self-image]], or are otherwise appropriate, correct or reasonable.

As a result, people with OCD are often aware that their behavior is not rational, are unhappy about their obsessions but nevertheless feel compelled by them.&lt;ref name="carter"&gt;Carter, K. "Obsessive–compulsive personality disorder." PSYC 210 lecture: Oxford College of Emory University. Oxford, GA. 11 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast people with OCPD are not aware of anything abnormal; they will readily explain why their actions are rational, it is usually impossible to convince them otherwise, and they tend to derive pleasure from their obsessions or compulsions.&lt;ref name="carter" /&gt;

== Management ==
A form of psychotherapy called "[[cognitive behavioral therapy]]" (CBT) and [[psychotropic medication]]s are first-line treatments for OCD.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NICE2005 /&gt; Other forms of psychotherapy, such as [[psychodynamic]] and [[psychoanalysis]] may help in managing some aspects of the disorder, but in 2007 the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA) noted a lack of [[Scientific control|controlled studies]] showing their effectiveness "in dealing with the core symptoms of OCD".&lt;ref name="APAguidelines"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Koran LM, Hanna GL, Hollander E, Nestadt G, Simpson HB | title = Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 164 | issue = 7 Suppl | pages = 5–53 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17849776 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that many individuals do not seek treatment may be due in part to [[social stigma|stigma]] associated with OCD.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

=== Therapy ===

[[File:Pennsylvania Capitol front door keyhole.jpg|thumb|One exposure and ritual prevention activity would be to check the lock only once, and then leave]]

The specific technique used in CBT is called [[exposure and response prevention]] (ERP) which involves teaching the person to deliberately come into contact with the situations that trigger the obsessive thoughts and fears ("exposure"), without carrying out the usual compulsive acts associated with the obsession ("response prevention"), thus gradually learning to tolerate the discomfort and anxiety associated with not performing the ritualistic behavior. At first, for example, someone might touch something only very mildly "contaminated" (such as a tissue that has been touched by another tissue that has been touched by the end of a toothpick that has touched a book that came from a "contaminated" location, such as a school.) That is the "exposure". The "ritual prevention" is not washing. Another example might be leaving the house and checking the lock only once (exposure) without going back and checking again (ritual prevention). The person fairly quickly [[habituation|habituates]] to the anxiety-producing situation and discovers that their anxiety level drops considerably; they can then progress to touching something more "contaminated" or not checking the lock at all—again, without performing the ritual behavior of washing or checking.&lt;ref name="baojournal.com"&gt;Huppert &amp; Roth: (2003) Treating Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder with Exposure and Response Prevention. ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 4 (1),'' 66 – 70 [http://www.baojournal.com/ BAO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323025324/http://baojournal.com/ |date=23 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ERP has a strong evidence base, and it is considered the most effective treatment for OCD.&lt;ref name="baojournal.com" /&gt; However, this claim was doubted by some researchers in 2000 who criticized the quality of many studies.&lt;ref name="pmid10910778"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Klein DF | title = Flawed meta-analyses comparing psychotherapy with pharmacotherapy | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 157 | issue = 8 | pages = 1204–11 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10910778 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.157.8.1204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has generally been accepted that psychotherapy, in combination with psychiatric medication, is more effective than either option alone.

=== Medication ===

[[File:Anafranil Japan.jpg|thumb|A blister pack of [[clomipramine]] under the brand name ''Anafranil'']]

The medications most frequently used are the [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs).&lt;ref name=NEJM2014 /&gt; [[Clomipramine]], a medication belonging to the class of [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s, appears to work as well as SSRIs but has a higher rate of side effects.&lt;ref name=NEJM2014 /&gt;

SSRIs are a second line treatment of adult obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) with mild functional impairment and as first line treatment for those with moderate or severe impairment. In children, SSRIs can be considered as a second line therapy in those with moderate-to-severe impairment, with close monitoring for psychiatric adverse effects.&lt;ref name=NICE2005&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg31/resources/treating-obsessivecompulsive-disorder-ocd-and-body-dysmorphic-disorder-bdd-in-adults-children-and-young-people-194882077|title=Obsessive-compulsive disorder: Core interventions in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder and body dysmorphic disorder|author=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)|series=Information about NICE Clinical Guideline 31|publisher=UK National Health Service (NHS)|date=November 2005|accessdate=24 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112001813/https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg31/resources/treating-obsessivecompulsive-disorder-ocd-and-body-dysmorphic-disorder-bdd-in-adults-children-and-young-people-194882077|archivedate=12 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; SSRIs are efficacious in the treatment of OCD; people treated with SSRIs are about twice as likely to respond to treatment as those treated with placebo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Arroll B, Elley CR, Fishman T, Goodyear-Smith FA, Kenealy T, Blashki G, Kerse N, Macgillivray S | title = Antidepressants versus placebo for depression in primary care | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = |issue = 3 | pages = CD007954 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19588448 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007954 | url = https://discovery.dundee.ac.uk/en/publications/85b92403-d474-4e5a-b606-65f7e0f86575|editor1-last = Arroll | editor1-first = Bruce }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/570825+ |title=Review Finds SSRIs Modestly Effective in Short-Term Treatment of OCD|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413110435/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/570825 |archivedate=13 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Efficacy has been demonstrated both in short-term (6–24&amp;nbsp;weeks) treatment trials and in discontinuation trials with durations of 28–52&amp;nbsp;weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fineberg NA, Brown A, Reghunandanan S, Pampaloni I | title = Evidence-based pharmacotherapy of obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = The International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 15 | issue = 8 | pages = 1173–91 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22226028 | doi = 10.1017/S1461145711001829 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/019839s070,020990s032lbl.pdf |title=Sertraline prescribing information |accessdate=30 January 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150616011817/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/019839s070%2C020990s032lbl.pdf |archivedate=16 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.apotex.com/us/en/products/downloads/pil/paxil_irtb_ins.pdf |title=Paroxetine prescribing information |accessdate=30 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219055046/https://www.apotex.com/us/en/products/downloads/pil/paxil_irtb_ins.pdf |archivedate=19 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the National Institute of Clinical and Health Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommended [[antipsychotic]]s for OCD that does not improve with SSRI treatment.&lt;ref name="Ve2014" /&gt; For OCD there is tentative evidence for [[risperidone]] and insufficient evidence for [[olanzapine]].  [[Quetiapine]] is no better than placebo with regard to primary outcomes, but small effects were found in terms of YBOCS score.  The efficacy of quetiapine and olanzapine are limited by the insufficient number of studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Komossa|first=K|author2=Depping, AM|author3= Meyer, M|author4= Kissling, W|author5= Leucht, S|title=Second-generation antipsychotics for obsessive compulsive disorder.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=8 Dec 2010|issue=12|pages=CD008141|pmid=21154394|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008141.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 review article found two studies that indicated that [[aripiprazole]] was "effective in the short-term" and found that "[t]here was a small effect-size for risperidone or anti-psychotics in general in the short-term"; however, the study authors found "no evidence for the effectiveness of quetiapine or olanzapine in comparison to placebo."&lt;ref name="Ve2014" /&gt; While quetiapine may be useful when used in addition to an SSRI in treatment-resistant OCD, these drugs are often poorly tolerated, and have metabolic side effects that limit their use.

A guideline by the APA suggested that [[dextroamphetamine]] may be considered by itself after more well supported treatments have been tried.&lt;ref name="APA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koran|first1=Lorrin|last2=Hanna|first2=Gregory|last3=Hollander|first3=Eric|last4=Nestadt|first4=Gerald|last5=Helen|first5=Simpson|title=Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder|url=http://psychiatryonline.org/pb/assets/raw/sitewide/practice_guidelines/guidelines/ocd.pdf|website=American Psychiatric Association|publisher=American Psychiatric Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Procedures ===
[[Electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT) has been found to have effectiveness in some severe and refractory cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cybulska Eva M | year = 2006 | title = Obsessive Compulsive disorder, the brain and electroconvulsive therapy | url = | journal = British Journal of Hospital Medicine | volume = 67 | issue = 2| pages = 77–82 | doi=10.12968/hmed.2006.67.2.20466| pmid = 16498907 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[psychosurgery|Surgery]] may be used as a last resort in people who do not improve with other treatments. In this procedure, a surgical [[lesion]] is made in an area of the brain (the [[cingulate cortex]]). In one study, 30% of participants benefitted significantly from this procedure.&lt;ref name="Barlow"&gt;Barlow, D. H. and V. M. Durand. ''Essentials of Abnormal Psychology''. California: Thomson Wadsworth, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deep-brain stimulation]] and [[vagus nerve stimulation]] are possible surgical options that do not require destruction of [[brain tissue]]. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration approved deep-brain stimulation for the treatment of OCD under a humanitarian device exemption requiring that the procedure be performed only in a hospital with specialist qualifications to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barlas S |title=FDA Approves Pioneering Treatment for Obsessive- Compulsive Disorder |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=26 |issue=4 |date=8 April 2009 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/ocd/article/10168/1399208 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710101738/http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/ocd/article/10168/1399208 |archivedate=10 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, psychosurgery for OCD is a treatment of last resort and will not be performed until the person has failed several attempts at medication (at the full dosage) with augmentation, and many months of intensive [[cognitive–behavioral therapy]] with exposure and ritual/response prevention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brainphysics.com/surgery.php Surgical Procedures for Obsessive–Compulsive Disorder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725094926/http://brainphysics.com/surgery.php |date=25 July 2008 }}, by M. Jahn and M. Williams, Ph.D,. BrainPhysics OCD Resource, Accessed 6 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, in the United Kingdom, psychosurgery cannot be performed unless a course of treatment from a suitably qualified cognitive–behavioral therapist has been carried out.

=== Children ===
Therapeutic treatment may be effective in reducing ritual behaviors of OCD for children and adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=O'Donohue William |author2=Ferguson Kyle E | year = 2006 | title = Evidence-Based Practice in Psychology and Behavior Analysis | url = | journal = The Behavior Analyst Today | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 335–347 | doi=10.1037/h0100155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the treatment of adults with OCD, CBT stands as an effective and validated first line of treatment of OCD in children.&lt;ref name=Freeman2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freeman|first1=J|last2=Garcia|first2=A|last3=Frank|first3=H|last4=Benito|first4=K|last5=Conelea|first5=C|last6=Walther|first6=M|last7=Edmunds|first7=J|title=Evidence base update for psychosocial treatments for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder|journal=Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology|date=2014|volume=43|issue=1|pages=7–26|pmid=23746138|doi=10.1080/15374416.2013.804386|pmc=3815743}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family involvement, in the form of behavioral observations and reports, is a key component to the success of such treatments.&lt;ref name="Rapoport, J. E. 1989"&gt;Rapoport, J. E. (1989). Obsessive-compulsive Disorder In Children &amp; Adolescents. Washington: American Psychiatric Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Parental interventions also provide positive reinforcement for a child who exhibits appropriate behaviors as alternatives to compulsive responses. In a recent meta-analysis of evidenced-based treatment of OCD in children, family-focused individual CBT was labeled as "probably efficacious", establishing it as one of the leading psychosocial treatments for youth with OCD.&lt;ref name=Freeman2014 /&gt; After one or two years of therapy, in which a child learns the nature of his or her obsession and acquires strategies for coping, that child may acquire a larger circle of friends, exhibit less shyness, and become less self-critical.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, P. L. (1973). Obsessive Children: A Sociopsychiatric Study. Philadelphia: Brunner / Mazel.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the causes of OCD in younger age groups range from brain abnormalities to psychological preoccupations, life stress such as bullying and traumatic familial deaths may also contribute to childhood cases of OCD, and acknowledging these stressors can play a role in treating the disorder.&lt;ref name="pmid19378573"&gt;{{cite journal | author = D'Alessandro TM | title = Factors influencing the onset of childhood obsessive compulsive disorder | journal = Pediatr Nurs | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 43–6 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19378573 | doi =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obsessive–compulsive disorder affects about 2.3% of people at some point in their life.&lt;ref name=Good2014 /&gt; Rates during a given year are about 1.2% and it occurs worldwide.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; It is unusual for symptoms to begin after the age of thirty five and half of people develop problems before twenty.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; Males and females are affected about equally.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt;

=== Associated conditions ===
People with OCD may be diagnosed with other conditions, as well as or instead of OCD, such as the aforementioned obsessive–compulsive personality disorder, [[major depressive disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen YW, Dilsaver SC | title = Comorbidity for obsessive-compulsive disorder in bipolar and unipolar disorders | journal = Psychiatry Research | volume = 59 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 57–64 | year = 1995 | pmid = 8771221 | doi = 10.1016/0165-1781(95)02752-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[generalized anxiety disorder]], [[anorexia nervosa]], [[social anxiety disorder]], [[bulimia nervosa]], [[Tourette syndrome]], [[autism spectrum disorder]], [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], [[dermatillomania]] (compulsive skin picking), [[body dysmorphic disorder]] and [[trichotillomania]] (hair pulling). More than 50 percent of people experience suicidal tendencies, and 15 percent have attempted suicide.&lt;ref name="Fenske_2009" /&gt; Depression, anxiety and prior suicide attempts increase the risk of future suicide attempts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Angelakis|first1=I|last2=Gooding|first2=P|last3=Tarrier|first3=N|last4=Panagioti|first4=M|title=Suicidality in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD): a systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|date=July 2015|volume=39|pages=1–15|pmid=25875222|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2015.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals with OCD have also been found to be affected by [[delayed sleep phase syndrome]] at a substantially higher rate than the general public.&lt;ref name='Turner 2007'&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Turner J, Drummond LM, Mukhopadhyay S, Ghodse H, White S, Pillay A, Fineberg NA | title = A prospective study of delayed sleep phase syndrome in patients with severe resistant obsessive–compulsive disorder | journal = World Psychiatry | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 108–111 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 18235868 | pmc = 2219909 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, severe OCD symptoms are consistently associated with greater sleep disturbance. Reduced total sleep time and sleep efficiency have been observed in people with OCD, with delayed sleep onset and offset and an increased prevalence of delayed sleep phase disorder.&lt;ref name="Paterson2013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paterson JL, Reynolds AC, Ferguson SA, Dawson D | title = Sleep and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) | journal = Sleep Medicine Reviews | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 465–74 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23499210 | doi = 10.1016/j.smrv.2012.12.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behaviorally, there is some research demonstrating a link between [[drug addiction]] and the disorder as well. For example, there is a higher risk of drug addiction among those with any anxiety disorder (possibly as a way of [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] with the heightened levels of [[anxiety]]), but drug addiction among people with OCD may serve as a type of [[compulsive behavior]] and not just as a coping mechanism. [[Clinical depression|Depression]] is also extremely prevalent among people with OCD. One explanation for the high depression rate among OCD populations was posited by Mineka, Watson and Clark (1998), who explained that people with OCD (or any other [[anxiety disorder]]) may feel depressed because of an "out of control" type of feeling.&lt;ref name="comorbidity"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mineka S, Watson D, Clark LA | title = Comorbidity of anxiety and unipolar mood disorders | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = |pages = 377–412 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9496627 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.49.1.377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Someone exhibiting OCD signs does not necessarily have OCD. Behaviors that present as (or seem to be) obsessive or compulsive can also be found in a number of other conditions as well, including [[obsessive–compulsive personality disorder|obsessive–compulsive ''personality'' disorder]] (OCPD), [[Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders#Obsessive-compulsive disorder|autism spectrum disorder]], disorders where [[perseveration]] is a possible feature ([[ADHD]], [[PTSD]], bodily disorders or habit problems)&lt;ref name="differential"&gt;[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1826591-differential Pediatric Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Differential Diagnoses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917123925/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1826591-differential |date=17 September 2012 }} – 2012&lt;/ref&gt; or sub-clinically.

Some with OCD present with features typically associated with Tourette's syndrome, such as compulsions that may appear to resemble motor tics; this has been termed "tic-related OCD" or "Tourettic OCD".&lt;ref name="10.1176/appi.neuropsych.21.1.59"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mansueto CS, Keuler DJ | title = Tic or compulsion?: it's Tourettic OCD. | volume = 29 | issue = 5 | pages = 784–99 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16046664 | doi = 10.1177/0145445505279261 | journal=Behavior Modification}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OCD and T"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ocfoundation.org/eo_ts.aspx |title=OCD and Tourette Syndrome: Re-examining the Relationship |publisher=International OCD Foundation |accessdate=30 October 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101085624/http://www.ocfoundation.org/eo_ts.aspx |archivedate=1 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A myth propagated by Sigmund Freud regarding above-average intelligence in OCD was recently refuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s11065-017-9358-0 | pmid=28864868 | title=Meta-Analysis of Intelligence Quotient (IQ) in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder | year=2017 | journal=Neuropsychology Review | volume=28 | issue=1 | pages=111–120 | author=Abramovitch Amitai, Anholt Gideon, Raveh-Gottfried Sagi, Hamo Naama, Abramowitz Jonathan S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OCD frequently co-occurs with both [[bipolar disorder]] and [[major depressive disorder]].  Between 60–80% of those with OCD experience a major depressive episode in their lifetime. Comorbidity rates have been reported at between 19–90% due to methodological differences.  Between 9–35% of those with bipolar disorder also have OCD, compared to the 1–2% in the general population. Around 50% of those with OCD experience cyclothymic traits or hypomanic episodes.  OCD is also associated with anxiety disorders.  Lifetime comorbidity for OCD has been reported at 22% for [[specific phobia]], 18% for [[social anxiety disorder]], 12% for panic disorder, and 30% for [[generalized anxiety disorder]].  The comorbidity rate for OCD and ADHD has been reported as high as 51%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pallanti|first1=S|last2=Grassi|first2=G|last3=Sarrecchia|first3=ED|last4=Cantisani|first4=A|last5=Pellegrini|first5=M|title=Obsessive-compulsive disorder comorbidity: clinical assessment and therapeutic implications.|journal=Frontiers in Psychiatry|date=2011|volume=2|pages=70|doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2011.00070|pmid=22203806|pmc=3243905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prognosis ==
Quality of life is reduced across all domains in OCD. While psychological or pharmacological treatment can lead to a reduction of OCD symptoms and an increase in QoL, symptoms may persist at moderate levels even following adequate treatment courses, and completely symptom-free periods are uncommon.&lt;ref name="pmid15533282"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eddy KT, Dutra L, Bradley R, Westen D | title = A multidimensional meta-analysis of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = Clin Psychol Rev | volume = 24 | issue = 8 | pages = 1011–30 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15533282 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2004.08.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Subramaniam|first1=M|last2=Soh|first2=P|last3=Vaingankar|first3=JA|last4=Picco|first4=L|last5=Chong|first5=SA|title=Quality of life in obsessive-compulsive disorder: impact of the disorder and of treatment.|journal=CNS Drugs|date=May 2013|volume=27|issue=5|pages=367–83|doi=10.1007/s40263-013-0056-z|pmid=23580175}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In pediatric OCD, around 40% still have the disorder in adulthood, and around 40% qualify for remission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boileau|first1=B|title=A review of obsessive-compulsive disorder in children and adolescents.|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|date=2011|volume=13|issue=4|pages=401–11|pmid=22275846|pmc=3263388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the seventh century AD, [[John Climacus]] records an instance of a young monk plagued by constant and overwhelming "temptations to blasphemy" consulting an older monk,&lt;ref name="Osborn1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Osborn|first=Ian|date=1998|title=Tormenting Thoughts and Secret Rituals: The Hidden Epidemic of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WVgTAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA210&amp;dq=Obsessive+Compulsive+Disorder+in+antiquity#v=onepage&amp;q=Obsessive%20Compulsive%20Disorder%20in%20antiquity&amp;f=false|location=New York City, New York|publisher=Dell Publishing|isbn=978-0-440-50847-2|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|212}} who told him, "My son, I take upon myself all the sins which these temptations have led you, or may lead you, to commit. All I require of you is that for the future you pay no attention to them whatosever."&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|212}} ''[[The Cloud of Unknowing]]'', a Christian mystical text from the late fourteenth century, recommends dealing with recurring obsessions by first attempting to ignore them,&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|213}} and, if that fails, "cower under them like a poor wretch and a coward overcome in battle, and reckon it to be a waste of your time for you to strive any longer against them",&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|213}} a technique now known as "[[emotional flooding]]".&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|213}}

From the 14th to the 16th century in Europe, it was believed that people who experienced blasphemous, sexual or other obsessive thoughts were [[spiritual possession|possessed]] by the [[Satan|Devil]].&lt;ref name="Aardema, F. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Aardema F., O'Connor |year = 2007 | title = The menace within: obsessions and the self | url = | journal = International Journal of Cognitive Therapy | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 182–197 | doi=10.1891/088983907781494573}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|213}} Based on this reasoning, treatment involved banishing the "evil" from the "possessed" person through [[exorcism]].&lt;ref name="Jenike"&gt;M.

The English term obsessive-compulsive comes from the translated term used to describe the first conceptions of OCD by [[Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal|Carl Westphal]], "zwangsvorstellung".  Westphal's description went on to influence [[Pierre Janet]] who further documented features of OCD.&lt;ref name="Sadock" /&gt;  In the early 1910s, [[Sigmund Freud]] attributed obsessive–compulsive behavior to unconscious conflicts that manifest as symptoms.&lt;ref name="Jenike" /&gt; Freud describes the clinical history of a typical case of "touching phobia" as starting in early childhood, when the person has a strong desire to touch an item. In response, the person develops an "external prohibition" against this type of touching.

=== Notable cases ===
[[John Bunyan]] (1628–1688), the author of ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'', displayed symptoms of OCD (which had not yet been named).&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|53–54}} During the most severe period of his condition, he would mutter the same phrase over and over again to himself while rocking back and forth.&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|53–54}} He later described his obsessions in his autobiography ''[[Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners]]'',&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|53–54}} stating, "These things may seem ridiculous to others, even as ridiculous as they were in themselves, but to me they were the most tormenting cogitations."&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|54}} He wrote two pamphlets advising those suffering from similar anxieties.&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|217–218}} In one of them, he warns against indulging in compulsions:&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|217–218}} "Have care of putting off your trouble of spirit in the wrong way: by promising to reform yourself and lead a new life, by your performances or duties".&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|218}}

British poet, essayist and lexicographer [[Samuel Johnson]] (1709–1784) also suffered from OCD.&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|54–55}} He had elaborate rituals for crossing the thresholds of doorways, and repeatedly walked up and down staircases counting the steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://westsuffolkpsych.homestead.com/Johnson.html |title=SAMUEL JOHNSON (1709–1784): A Patron Saint of OCD? by Fred Penzel, Ph.D. from the Scientific Advisory Board of the International OCD Foundation |website=Westsuffolkpsych.homestead.com |accessdate=29 November 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615085035/http://westsuffolkpsych.homestead.com/Johnson.html |archivedate=15 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|55}} He would touch every post on the street as he walked past,&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|55}} only step in the middles of paving stones,&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|55}} and repeatedly perform tasks as though they had not been done properly the first time.&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|55}} The American aviator and filmmaker [[Howard Hughes]] is known to have had OCD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug05/hughes.aspx |title=Hughes's germ phobia revealed in psychological autopsy |last1=Dittmann |first1=M |date=July–August 2005 |website=American Psychological Association |accessdate=9 January 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105071029/http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug05/hughes.aspx |archivedate=5 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Friends of Hughes have also mentioned his obsession with minor flaws in clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug05/hughes.html | journal=APA Online: Monitor on Psychology | volume=36 | issue=7 | date=July–August 2005 | author1=M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11623">The '''pizza effect''' is a term used especially in [[religious studies]] and [[sociology]] for the phenomenon of elements of a nation or people's culture being transformed or at least more fully embraced elsewhere, then re-imported back to their culture of origin,&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation | year=2003 | title = Action dharma: new studies in engaged Buddhism | editor1=Christopher S. Queen | editor2=Charles S. Prebish | editor3=Damien Keown | publisher=Routledge | isbn=978-0-7007-1594-7 | page=33 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WP4RcKcEm2QC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=%22pizza+effect%22}}
&lt;/ref&gt; or the way in which a community's self-understanding is influenced by (or imposed by, or imported from) foreign sources.&lt;ref name=white/&gt; It is named after the idea that modern [[pizza]] toppings were developed among [[Italian American|Italian immigrants]] [[History of immigration to the United States|in the United States]] (rather than in native Italy, where in its simpler form it was originally looked down upon), and was later exported back to Italy to be interpreted as a delicacy in [[Italian cuisine]].&lt;ref name="dandavats"/&gt;

Related phrases include "hermeneutical feedback loop", "re-enculturation", and "self-orientalization". The term "pizza effect" was coined by the Austrian-born [[Hindu]] [[Dashanami Sampradaya|monk]] and professor of Anthropology at [[Syracuse University]], [[Agehananda Bharati]]&lt;ref name=white/&gt;&lt;ref name=knott/&gt;&lt;ref name="dandavats"&gt;[[Steven J. Rosen]] (Satyaraja Dasa), [http://www.dandavats.com/?p=260 "The Pizza Effect"] (in the context of [[Krishna Consciousness]])

== Examples ==
The original examples given by Agehananda Bharati mostly had to do with popularity and status:
*The [[Apu trilogy]] films of [[Satyajit Ray]], which were flops in India before they were given prizes in [[Western countries]] and re-evaluated as classics of the [[Indian cinema]]&lt;ref name="expat"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
*The popularity in India of movements like those of [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] and [[ISKCON]] based on their popularity in the west&lt;ref name="expat" /&gt;
*The popularity of [[yoga]], several [[List of Hindu gurus and saints|gurus]], and some other Indian systems and teachings following their popularity in the west&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
*The exalted status of the [[Bhagavad Gita]] in Hinduism, where, although it was always highly regarded, it gained its current prominence only following Western attempts to identify a single canonical "Hindu Bible"&lt;ref name="ab70" /&gt;

Analyst [[Mark Sedgwick]] wrote that [[Islamist terrorism]], and specifically [[suicide bombing]], can be seen as examples, beginning as isolated interpretations of the concept of [[shahid]], or martyrdom, then being re-exported to the greater Muslim world.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Day of the Dead]] parade in Mexico City was inspired by an event in the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'', which was fictional at the time of the film's production. &lt;ref&gt;David Agren, October 30, 2016, The Gaurdian, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/29/day-of-the-dead-parade-james-bond-mexico-city Mexico City's James Bond-inspired Day of the Dead parade gets mixed reviews], retrieved October 28, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The founders of the [[Theosophical Society]], [[Helena Blavatsky]] and [[Henry Steel Olcott]], were influenced by Eastern religions, then placed their headquarters in [[Adyar, Chennai]], from where they spread their views within India.&lt;ref name="knott"&gt;{{citation | year=2000 | title = Hinduism: a very short introduction | author1=Kim Knott | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-285387-5 | page=78 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wv8XK_GU9icC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=wonders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Buddhist modernism]] or "Protestant Buddhism" was developed by Westerners, who according to scholar Stephen Jenkins, "mistook it for an indigenous Sri Lankan product", and they in turn influenced [[Sri Lankan Buddhist]] [[Anagarika Dharmapala]], who, along with the Theosophical Society, was instrumental in spreading Buddhism in both India and the West.&lt;ref name="blackships"&gt;

According to scholar Kim Knott, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] "was not very interested in religion until he went to London to study law, where he studied the [[Bhagavad Gita]] in English in [[Sir Edwin Arnold]]'s translation, and this deeply influenced his spiritual outlook."&lt;ref name="knott" /&gt;

[[Haoqiu zhuan]], a Chinese novel. James St. André, author of "Modern Translation Theory and Past Translation Practice: European Translations of the ''Haoqiu zhuan''", wrote that in China the novel was originally "considered second-rate fiction and stood in danger of being completely forgotten with changes in literary taste in the early twentieth century."&lt;ref name="StAndrep39"&gt;St. André, James. "Modern Translation Theory and Past Translation Practice: European Translations of the ''Haoqiu zhuan''" (Chapter 2). In: Chan, Leo Tak-hung (editor).

[https://books.google.com/books?id=o5oPBC2AfgAC&amp;pg=PA39 39].&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that the fact there had been interest in translating the novel into English "gave life and fame" to ''Haoqiu zhuan'' and therefore affected its standing in China.&lt;ref name="StAndrep39" /&gt;

==Criticism==
Scholar David Miller wrote that Westerners were responsible for "…the renewed interest in the four [[Vedas]] and the [[Upanishads]], as texts in themselves apart from the endless number of commentaries that have been written by Indians to interpret and to systematize the texts," and that due to this interest, "Indian scholars have also served up that menu, often in a less appetizing way than their Western counterparts. In so doing they have missed the very life force or essence of Indian ethical traditions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| year = 1981| author1 = Miller | first1 = D.| jstor = 40014933| publisher = Blackwell Publishing| issue = 2| pages = 186–198| title = Sources of Hindu Ethical Studies_ a Critical Review| journal = The Journal of Religious Ethics| volume = 9| doi = 10.2307/40014933}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
Scholar Jørn Borup wrote about an "inverted pizza-effect", when a society's modification of another culture gets further re-modified by that same society, such as European philosophers including [[Martin Heidegger]] "appear to have been significantly inspired by [[Eastern thought]] - an Eastern thought itself presented through "[[Protestant]]" or [[Western culture|"Western" eyes]]. This transformation is naturally not a unique phenomenon in [[religious studies]], where interpretations, re-interpretations and inventions are seen as common characteristics of religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | year=2004 | title = Zen and the Art of Inverting Orientalism | author1=Jørn Borup | publisher=Walter de Gruyter | isbn=3-11-017698-X | page=477 | url=http://www.reference-global.com/doi/abs/10.1515/9783110211702.3.451}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Jenkins noted that the feedback phenomenon could continue; in the case of pizza, he wrote that the return of pizza to Italy again influenced [[American cuisine]]: "...pizza-loving American tourists, [[Tourism in Italy|going to Italy]] in the millions, sought out authentic Italian pizza. Italians, responding to this demand, developed [[pizzeria]]s to meet American expectations. Delighted with their discovery of "authentic" Italian pizza, Americans subsequently developed chains of "authentic" Italian brick-oven pizzerias. Hence, Americans met their own reflection in the other and were delighted."&lt;ref name="blackships" /&gt;{{rp|81}}

Jim Douglas, familiar with Bharati's thesis, applied it to black blues originating in the United States before 1960. The music of Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, etc. went over to England, where it was embraced by other musicians (especially white men playing electric guitar). Then, this re-packaged blues came back to the US presented by the Rolling Stones, Cream, Led Zeppelin,  etc. in the late 1960s where it was embraced by baby boomers (who had never heard of Robert Johnson, etc.). Later, some of these American baby boomers discovered the roots of the British blues-rock in the recordings of the original American blues artists.

The concept has been described as "an exercise in double-tracking one's public image: on the one hand, defining oneself through committed allegiance to a radical cause, but on the other, vitally, demonstrating this allegiance because it is the fashionable, ''[[:wiktionary:au courant|au courant]]'' way to be seen in moneyed, name-conscious Society."&lt;ref name=Molotov&gt;{{cite web |last=Bracewell |first=Michael |title=Molotov Cocktails |work=[[Frieze (magazine)|Frieze Magazine]] |date=November–December 2004 |url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/molotov_cocktails |accessdate=2009-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201190439/http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/molotov_cocktails |archivedate=2008-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike dedicated [[Activism|activists]], [[Revolutionary|revolutionaries]], or [[Political dissent|dissenters]], those who engage in "radical chic" remain frivolous political agitators. They are [[Ideology|ideologically]] invested in their cause of choice only so far as it advances their social standing.

"[[Terrorism|Terrorist]] chic" is a modern expression with similar connotations. This derivative, however, de-emphasizes the [[Social commentary|class satire]] of Wolfe's original term, instead accentuating concerns over the [[semiotics]] of radicalism (such as the [[aestheticization of violence]]).

In languages such as [[American English]], [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] the term has become widely used to indicate people identifying themselves as [[Socialism|socialists]] or radical leftists while conducting upper-class lifestyles.

==Origin and meaning==
The phrase "radical chic" originated in a 1970 ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' article by [[Tom Wolfe]], titled "Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's",&lt;ref name="nymag1970"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/docs/07/05/070529radical_chic.pdf|title=Radical Chic: that Party at Lenny's|last=Wolfe|first=Tom|date=8 June 1970|work=New York|accessdate=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later reprinted in his books ''[[Radical Chic &amp; Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers]]'' and ''[[The Purple Decades]]''. In the essay, Wolfe used the term to satirize composer [[Leonard Bernstein]] and his friends for their absurdity in hosting a fundraising party for the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]]—an organization whose members, activities, and goals were clearly incongruous with those of Bernstein's elite circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Foote |first=Timothy |title=Fish in the Brandy Snifter |date=1970-12-21 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904627,00.html? |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfe's concept of radical chic was intended to lampoon individuals  (particularly [[Elitism|social elites]] like the [[jet set]]) who endorsed [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] radicalism merely to affect worldliness, assuage [[white guilt]], or garner prestige, rather than to affirm genuine political convictions.

{{Quote|[Wolfe's] subject is how culture's patrician classes – the wealthy, fashionable intimates of high society – have sought to luxuriate in both a vicarious glamour and a monopoly on virtue through their public espousal of street politics: a politics, moreover, of minorities so removed from their sphere of experience and so absurdly, diametrically, opposed to the islands of privilege on which the cultural aristocracy maintain their isolation, that the whole basis of their relationship is wildly out of kilter from the start. ... In short, Radical Chic is described as a form of highly developed decadence; and its greatest fear is to be seen not as prejudiced or unaware, but as middle-class.|Michael Bracewell|"Molotov Cocktails"&lt;ref name=Molotov /&gt;}}

==Background==
The concept of "fashionable" espousal of radical causes by members of wealthy society in this case had been argued against by Bernstein's wife, [[Felicia Montealegre]], prior to the publication of "Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's", a fact Wolfe details in it. The essay appeared in the June 8, 1970 issue of ''New York'', 20 weeks after the actual fund raiser at the Bernstein residence was held on January 14. The first report of the event appeared the following day in a piece by ''[[The New York Times]]'' style reporter [[Charlotte Curtis]], who was in attendance. Curtis wrote in part: "Leonard Bernstein and a Black Panther leader argued the merits of the Black Panther party's philosophy before nearly 90 guests last night in the Bernsteins' elegant Park Avenue duplex." According to Wolfe, the release of the story worldwide was followed by strong criticism of the event: "The English, particularly, milked the story for all it was worth and seemed to derive one of the great cackles of the year from it."&lt;ref name=nymag1970 /&gt;

The negative reaction prompted publication of an op-ed in the ''Times'' on January 16 entitled "False Note on Black Panthers" that was severely critical of the Black Panther Party and Bernstein:

{{Quote|Emergence of the Black Panthers as the romanticized darlings of the politico-cultural jet set is an affront to the majority of black Americans. ... the group therapy plus fund-raising soiree at the home of Leonard Bernstein, as reported in this newspaper yesterday, represents the sort of elegant slumming that degrades patrons and patronized alike. It might be dismissed as guilt-relieving fun spiked with social consciousness, except for its impact on those blacks and whites seriously working for complete equality and social justice.&lt;ref name="nyt_false_note"&gt;{{cite news|title=False Note on Black Panthers|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 16, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Felicia Montealegre wrote and personally delivered a response to this op-ed to the ''Times'' offices.&lt;ref name="nymag_html"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolfe|first=Tom|title=Tom Wolfe on Radical Chic and Leonard Bernstein's Party for the Black Panthers|url=http://nymag.com/news/features/46170/index15.html|work=Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's|publisher=New York|accessdate=11 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her response she wrote:

{{Quote|As a civil libertarian, I asked a number of people to my house on Jan. 14 in order to hear the lawyer and others involved with the Panther 21 discuss the problem of civil liberties as applicable to the men now waiting trial, and to help raise funds for their legal expenses. ... It was for this deeply serious purpose that our meeting was called. The frivolous way in which it was reported as a "fashionable" event is unworthy of the Times, and offensive to all people who are committed to humanitarian principles of justice.&lt;ref name=nymag_html /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt_letter"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Felicia M.|title=Letters to the Editor of The Times: Panthers' Legal Aid|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/21/archives/letters-to-the-editor-of-the-times.html |accessdate=4 June 2018|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 21, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Terrorist chic==

'''Terrorist chic''' (also known as "terror chic" or "militant chic") is a more recent and specific variation of the term. It refers to the [[Cultural appropriation|appropriation]] of symbols, objects, and aesthetics related to radical [[Militant (word)|militants]], usually in the context of [[Popular culture|pop culture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Daly |first=Susan |title=Is the war over for terrorist chic? |work=[[Independent.ie]] |publisher=[[Independent News &amp; Media]] |date=2008-11-08 |url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/news-gossip/is-the-war-over-for-terrorist-chic-1528669.html |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[fashion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Herr |first=Cheryl |title=Terrorist Chic and Marching Season Style |work=[[The Vacuum]] |publisher=Factotum |date=July 2004 |url=http://www.thevacuum.org.uk/issues/issues0120/issue17/is17artterchi.html |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; When such imagery is deployed [[Subversion (politics)|subversively]], the process exemplifies aestheticization of propaganda. Regardless, because terrorist chic derives its [[iconography]] from groups and individuals often associated with violent conflict or [[terrorism]], the term carries a greater pejorative tone than "radical chic."

Instances of terrorist chic have variously been interpreted as morally irresponsible, earnestly [[Counterculture|counter-cultural]], ironically [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hip]], or benignly apolitical. According to Henry K. Miller of the ''[[New Statesman]]'', the most well-known example is the ubiquitous appearance of [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara in popular culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Miller |first=Henry K |title=Fatal attraction |work=[[New Statesman]] |date=2002-10-28 |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200210280033 |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cases that have been labeled terrorist chic include: the Prada-Meinhof fashion line (a pun on [[Prada]] and the [[Red Army Faction|Baader-Meinhof Gang]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Connolly |first=Kate |title=Astrid Proll's journey to Terror Chic |work=[[The Observer]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=2002-10-06 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/oct/06/germany.kateconnolly |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smiley |first=Shannon |title=Germany Debates 'Terrorist Chic': Art and Fashion Stir Memories of Leftist Violence in '70s |work=[[The Washington Post]] |publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]] |date=2005-02-20 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A38447-2005Feb19.html |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the fashion of combining [[keffiyeh]]s and military-style clothing such as camo prints and heavy boots, outside the [[Arab World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hernandez |first=Daniel |title='Terrorist Chic' and Beyond |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]] |date=2006-04-09 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/apr/09/magazine/tm-terrorchic15 |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lando |first=Michal |title=US chain pulls 'anti-war' keffiyehs |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |publisher=Mirkaei Tikshoret Ltd. |date=2007-01-19 |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1167467767600&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |accessdate=2009-04-05 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was murdered in the jungles of Bolivia. He became a legend in Latin America and around the world (Dorfman 1999).

===Che embodied third world revolution, a drawing-room, radical-chic hope===
Shortly after the October 17, 1997 burial with military honors in [[Santa Clara, Cuba]] of Guevara's disinterred and identified remains, found in the Bolivian jungle by [[forensic anthropology|forensic anthropologists]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9710/17/cuba.che/ Cuba salutes 'Che' Guevara: Revolutionary Icon Finally Laid to Rest] CNN, October 17, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; ''New York Times'' columnist Richard Bernstein argued that the third-world revolution that Che embodied was no longer even a ''drawing-room, radical-chic hope.''&lt;ref name=NYT26nov1997&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/26/books/critic-s-notebook-looking-back-with-cooled-passions-at-che-s-image.html|publisher=New York Times|title=Critic's Notebook; Looking Back With Cooled Passions at Che's Image|first=Richard|last=Bernstein|date=26 November 1997|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrent with his re-burial, three major Guevara biographies were published in 1997. Noting the sustained interest in Che, Bernstein suggested that "the end of the cold war and the failure of the third-world revolution" allowed for the "scrutiny of Guevara, [as] a symbol of both the idealism and the [[moral blindness]] of the decade of protest" to take place free in a context free "of ideological partisanship and rancor."&lt;ref name=NYT26nov1997 /&gt;

The film followed most other pop-culture trends by showing a glamorized and romanticized portrayal of Che as a 'heroic liberator'.&lt;ref name=chechiclatimes7ju2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=TimeMagazine14june1999&gt;{{cite news|title=Che Guevarra: The Guerrilla|first=Ariel|last=Dorfman|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,991268,00.html|date=14 June 1999|publisher=Time Magazine|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Del Toro won the [[Best Actor Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actor Award]], and the film received mostly positive reviews.

Roth|Roth, Alvin E.]] (2007), "Repugnance as a constraint on markets," November, Journal of Economic Perspectives, vol. 21 (3), Summer, pp. 37-58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Alvin E. Roth|Roth, Alvin E.]] (2007), "What Have We Learned From Market Design?," NBER Working Papers 13530, National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael J. Sandel|Michael Sandel]] (April 24, 2012), "What Money Can't Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets," [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]], {{ISBN|978-0-374-20303-0}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/21559308 Two new books probe the limits of capitalism] July 21st 2012 [[The Economist]]&lt;/ref&gt; The cost could be emotional, physical, mental or figurative.  The stimulus could be anything from food to people to an idea. 

These costs are perspective-dependent and individual.  These costs may be different for different groups of people; countries, states, ethnicities, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Elias, Julio J. (2008),[http://www.bcentral.cl/conferencias-seminarios/seminarios/pdf/Elias_Repugnance.pdf "The Role of Repugnance in the Development of Markets: The. Case of the Market for Kidneys for Transplants,"] Working paper.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term allows for a clear and understandable way of representing the concept of contextual stigma in a literal and applicable sense.

== Origin ==
Repugnancy costs were first mentioned in a debate between [[Alvin E. Roth|Alvin Roth]] and Julio Elias on whether there should be an official [[Gary Becker|market for kidneys]].&lt;ref&gt;Elias, Julio J. and [[Alvin E. Roth|Roth, Alvin E.]] (2007),[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118901049137818211 "Econ One on One: A Market for Kidneys?"] The Wall Street Journal Online.
&lt;/ref&gt; The act of buying and selling [[organ transplant|organs]] may be against one's cultural mores; it may be repugnant.  Hence, this is an additional costs one must bear if such a market was deemed repugnant in the context of one's culture.

'''See-through clothing''' is any [[garment]] of clothing made with [[lace]], [[mesh]] or [[sheer fabric]] that allows the wearer's body or undergarments to be seen through its fabric. See-through fabrics were fashionable in Europe in the eighteenth century. There was a  "sheer fashion trend" starting with [[designer clothing]] from 2008.&lt;ref name=fashionising&gt;[http://www.fashionising.com/trends/b--Sheer-fashion-trend-2009-2010-953.html Sheer fashion trend: 2009 &amp; 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; See-through or sheer fabric, particularly in skintone (called "nude") colours, is sometimes called '''illusion''', as in 'illusion bodice' (or sleeve) due to giving the impression of exposed flesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maitra|first=K.K.|title=Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Clothing and Textiles|year=2007|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=8183242057|pages=218|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jwHv0mmIagQC&amp;pg=PA218#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mesh, web, or [[Net (textile)|net]] fabric may have many connected or woven pieces with a large number of closely spaced holes, frequently used for modern [[Jersey (clothing)|sports jerseys]].

A sheer [[textile|fabric]] is a thin cloth which is [[Transparency (optics)|semi-transparent]]. These include [[Chiffon (fabric)|chiffon]], [[Georgette (fabric)|georgette]], and gauze. Some are fine-[[denier (unit)|denier]] [[knit]]s used in [[tights]] and [[stockings]], [[dancewear]], and [[lingerie]]. It can also be used in [[Top (clothing)|tops]], [[trousers|pants]], [[skirt]]s, [[Dress (garment)|dresses]], and [[gown]]s.

[[Latex clothing|Latex rubber]], which is naturally [[translucent]], or plastics can be made into clothing material of any level of transparency. Clear plastic is typically only found in over-garments, such as [[raincoat]]s. The use of translucent [[latex]] rubber for clothing can also be found in [[fetish clothing]]. Some materials become [[Wet T-shirt contest|transparent when wet]] or when extreme light is shone on it, such as by a flashbulb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2135310/Stephanie-Seymour-makes-fashion-boob-camera-flashes-highlight-dress--lack-underwear.html#axzz2JffrmPI9 Sheer disaster!

During the 1770s and 1780s, there was a fad for wrap-over dresses which were sometimes worn by actresses in Oriental roles.&lt;ref name=dam/&gt; These were criticised by [[Horace Walpole]] among others for resembling [[Peignoir|dressing gowns]] too closely, while others objected to their revealingly thin materials, such as silk gauze and [[muslin]].&lt;ref name=dam&gt;{{cite book|last=Ribeiro|first=Aileen|title=Dress and Morality|year=2003|publisher=Berg|isbn=9781859737828|pages=116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1780s the chemise a la Reine, as worn by [[Marie Antoinette]] in a notorious portrait of 1783 by [[Louise Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun|Vigée Le Brun]], became very popular.&lt;ref name=dam/&gt; It was a filmy white muslin dress similar to the undergarment also called a [[chemise]]. In 1784 [[Abigail Adams]] visited Paris, where she was shocked to observe that fashionable Frenchwomen, including [[Anne-Catherine de Ligniville, Madame Helvétius|Madame Helvétius]], favoured the more revealing and sheer versions of this gown.&lt;ref name=dam/&gt;

By the end of the 1790s, [[Louis-Sébastien Mercier]], observing the dress of Frenchwomen, noted that [[demi-mondaine]]s were dressing in a manner he described as "a la sauvage", comprising a semi-sheer muslin gown worn only over a flesh-coloured [[bodystocking]], with the breasts, arms and feet bare.&lt;ref name=dam/&gt; Mercier blamed the public display of nude or lightly-draped statues for encouraging this immodesty.&lt;ref name=dam/&gt;

In the very late 18th century and for the first decade of the 19th, [[Neoclassical fashion#Neoclassicism and fashion|neoclassical]] gowns made of lightweight translucent muslin were fashionable.&lt;ref&gt;"Two dresses [French] (1983.6.1,07.146.5)".

Accessed 12 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; As the fabric clung to the body revealing what was beneath, it made nudity ''à la grecque'' a centrepiece of public spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, Darcy G. "Nudity à La Grecque." The Art Bulletin 80.2 (1998): 311–35.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of transparency in women's dress was often satirised by caricaturists of the day such as [[Isaac Cruikshank]].

Throughout the 19th century women's dresses, particularly for summer or evening wear, often featured transparent fabrics. However, these were almost always lined or worn over opaque undergarments or an underdress so that the wearer's modesty was preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1821-23 sheer muslin evening dress in the Victoria and Albert Museum|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O136990/evening-dress-unknown/|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1851 white muslin wedding dress and petticoat in the Victoria and Albert Museum|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O368547/wedding-dress-and-unknown/|accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1889–92 dress of sheer chiffon and figured silk in the Victoria and Albert Museum|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O135455/jacket-bodice-sara-mayer-a/|accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==

===1900s–1910s===
A fashionable garment in the early 20th century was the "peekaboo waist", a blouse made from [[broderie anglaise]] or sheer fabric, which led to complaints that flesh could be seen through the eyelets in the embroidery or through the thin fabric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mixer and Server|year=1914|volume=23|page=35|publisher=Hotel and Restaurant Employee's International Alliance and Bartenders' International League of America|quote=Some few years back moral reformers started a campaign against the "peek-a-boo" waist. The "peek-a-boo" waist was one with an embroidered front and the objection was made because of the portion of the bust which could be seen through the openings in the embroidery.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913 the so-called "x&amp;#8209;ray dress", defined as a woman's dress that was considered to be too sheer or revealing, caused similar consternation. In August that year the Chief of Police of Los Angeles stated his intention to recommend a law banning women from wearing the "diaphanous" x‑ray dress on the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=POLICE BAR X-RAY SKIRT.; Los Angeles May Get Special Law to Prevent Diaphanous Raiment.|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1913/08/23/100642113.pdf|accessdate=11 June 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=19 August 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[H.&amp;nbsp;Russell Albee]], the Mayor of Portland, Oregon, ordered the arrest of any woman caught wearing an x‑ray dress on the street, which was defined as a gown cut too low at the neck or split to the knee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=United Press|title=Chief Places Ban on X&amp;nbsp;Ray Dresses|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eRsbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=I0kEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4403,4431603&amp;dq=x-ray-dress&amp;hl=en|accessdate=11 June 2012|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press|date=20 August 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year in 1914, Jean-Philippe Worth, designer for the renowned Paris couture [[House of Worth]], had a client object to the thickness of the [[taffeta]] [[Lining (sewing)|lining]] of her dress, which was described as "thinner than a [[Rolling paper|cigarette paper]]". Worth stated that using an even thinner, sheerer lining fabric would have had the effect of an "x&amp;#8209;ray dress".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ladies' Column – London Fashion Notes|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=EP19140502.2.135|accessdate=11 June 2012|newspaper=The Evening Post|date=2 May 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s===
See-through and transparent clothing became very fashionable in the latter part of the 1960s. In 1967, [[Missoni]] presented a show at the [[Palazzo Pitti]] in Florence, where Rosita Missoni noticed the models' bras showed through their knit dresses and requested they remove them.&lt;ref name=nyobit&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Eric|title=Ottavio Missoni, Who Made Zigzags a Symbol of High Fashion, Dies at 92|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/10/fashion/ottavio-missoni-is-dead-at-92.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=11 May 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, under the [[Runway (fashion)#Catwalk|catwalk]] lights, the garments became unexpectedly transparent, revealing nude breasts beneath.&lt;ref name=nyobit/&gt; The see-through look was subsequently presented by [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]] the following year,&lt;ref name=sfobit&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/world/article/Patriarch-of-fashion-brand-Missoni-dies-in-Italy-4501342.php|title=Patriarch of fashion brand Missoni dies in Italy|accessdate=10 May 2013|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=9 May 2013|author=Franco d'Emilio|author2=Colleen Barry|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in London, [[Ossie Clark]] presented sheer chiffon dresses intended to be worn without underwear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Watt |first=Judith |title="Ossie Clark" in The Berg companion to fashion|year=2010 |publisher=Berg |location=Oxford [etc.] |isbn=1847885632 |editor=Valerie Steele}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trend led to jewellery designers such as Daniel Stoenescu at [[Cadoro]] creating "body jewellery" to be worn with sheer blouses and low-cut dresses.&lt;ref name=nemy&gt;{{cite news|last=Nemy|first=Enid|title=No Matter What You Call It, Body Jewelry Is Made to Top Nudity |url=http://fultonhistory.com/newspaper%202/Utica%20NY%20Daily%20Observer/Utica%20NY%20Observer%201969%20pdf/Utica%20NY%20Observer%201969%20-%201451.PDF|accessdate=26 November 2012 |newspaper=Utica Observer Dispatch|date=17 February 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stoenescu designed metal filigree "breastplates" inspired by a statue of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] found at [[Pompeii]], which functioned like a brassiere and were designed to be visible through the transparent shirts while preserving the wearer's modesty.&lt;ref name=nemy/&gt;

A see-through dress worn by [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|Kate Middleton]], the future Duchess of Cambridge, to a charity fashion show in 2002 was sold at auction on 17 March 2011 for $127,500.&lt;ref&gt;The Age, 18 March 2011: [http://www.theage.com.au/lifestyle/fashion/kates-seethough-dress-sells-for-princely-sum-20110318-1bzhx.html Kate's see-though dress sells for princely sum]&lt;/ref&gt;

See-through materials of various kinds continue to be available for a wide range of clothing styles. See-through fabrics have been featured heavily on [[Runway (fashion)|high-fashion]] runways since 2006. This use of see-through fabrics as a common element in [[designer clothing]] resulted in the "sheer fashion trend" that has been predominant in fashion circles since 2008.&lt;ref name=fashionising /&gt;

'''''Seeing Anthropology: Cultural Anthropology Through Film''''' by [[Karl G. Heider]] introduces [[cultural anthropology]] with the use of both text and [[audiovisual|audiovisual media]]. First published in 1997, the work uses the tools of the [[ethnographic film]] discipline to inform its audience of the various cultural anthropology topics.  Also, the text covers 14 different [[culture]]s in 17 chapters, which are also represented in 21 different short film clips ranging from two to twelve minutes.&lt;ref name=ehren&gt;

'''Semiotics of culture''' is a research field within [[semiotics]] that attempts to define [[culture]] from semiotic perspective and as a type of human symbolic activity, creation of [[sign]]s and a way of giving meaning to everything around. Therefore, here culture is understood as a [[system]] of symbols or meaningful signs. Because the main sign system is the linguistic system, the field is usually referred to as '''semiotics of culture and language'''. Under this field of study symbols are analyzed and categorized in certain class within the hierarchal system. With postmodernity, metanarratives are no longer as pervasive and thus categorizing these symbols in this postmodern age is more difficult and rather critical.

The research field was of particular interest for the [[Tartu–Moscow Semiotic School]] ([[USSR]]). Linguists and semioticians by the Tartu School viewed culture as a hierarchical semiotic system consisting of set of functions correlated to it, and linguistic codes that are used by social groups to maintain coherence. These codes are viewed as superstructures based on natural language, and here the ability of humans to symbolize is central.

The study received a research ground also in [[Japan]] where the idea that culture and nature should not be contrasted and contradicted but rather harmonized was developed.

based on [[crowdsourcing]]: the number of [[Panoramio]] photos taken at each place in the world.

The goal of the site is to find and explore places interesting for tourism and sightseeing.
The most popular places are shown on the map with an appropriate crowd-sourced name, attached links, tagcloud 
and colour-coded markers in the order of the relative popularity in the currently visible map area.

Users can filter popular places by their estimated population, type and tags. The site offers also
tools for travel planning, adding bookmarks and personal notes to places.

The place names are selected by the Wikipedia readership numbers and [[Foursquare]] checkins, 
augmented using the automated analysis of photo titles. 
A tag cloud of weighted categories is computed from the photo titles and attached to a place.

A '''studio''' is an [[artist]] or worker's workroom. This can be for the purpose of [[acting]], [[architecture]], [[painting]], [[pottery]] ([[ceramic]]s), [[sculpture]], [[origami]], [[woodworking]], [[scrapbooking]], [[photography]], [[graphic design]], [[filmmaking]], [[animation]], [[industrial design]], [[radio]] or [[television production]] [[broadcasting]] or the making of [[music]]. The term is also used for the workroom of [[dancer]]s, often specified to [[dance studio]].

The word ''studio'' is derived from the {{Lang-it|studio}}, from {{Lang-lat|studium}}, from ''studere'', meaning to [[Wiktionary:study|study]] or zeal.

The French term for studio, '''[[atelier]]''', in addition to designating an artist's studio is used to characterize the studio of a fashion designer. Atelier also has the connotation of being the home of an [[alchemy|alchemist]] or [[Magician (paranormal)|wizard]].

''Studio'' is also a metonym for the group of people who work within a particular studio. 

==Art studio==
[[File:Jane Frank Portrait .jpg|thumb|Artist [[Jane Frank]] in her studio, 1960s or 1970s. The studio of a contemporary [[mixed media]] artist can be quite a messy affair.]]

The studio of any artist, especially from the 15th to the 19th centuries, characterized all the assistants, thus the designation of paintings as "from the [[workshop]] of..." or "studio of..."
An art studio is sometimes called an '''atelier''', especially in earlier eras. In contemporary, English language use, "atelier" can also refer to the [[Atelier Method]], a training method for artists that usually takes place in a professional artist's studio. 

The above-mentioned "method" calls upon that zeal for study to play a significant role in the production which occurs in a studio space. A studio is more or less artful to the degree that the artist who occupies it is committed to the continuing education in his or her formal discipline. Academic curricula categorize studio classes in order to prepare students for the rigors of building sets of skills which require a continuity of practice in order to achieve growth and mastery of their artistic expression. A versatile and creative mind will embrace the opportunity of such practice to innovate and experiment, which develops uniquely individual qualities of each artist's expression. Thus the method raises and maintains an art studio space above the level of a mere production facility or workshop.

Safety is or may be a concern in studios, with some painting materials required to be handled, stored, or used properly to prevent poisoning, chemical burns, or fire.&lt;ref&gt;Friel, Michael (2010). ''Still Life Painting Atelier: An Introduction to Oil Painting'', p.20. {{ISBN|978-0-8230-3408-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational studio==
In educational studios, students learn to develop skills related to design, ranging from architecture to product design.  In specific, educational studios are studio settings where large numbers of students learn to draft and design with instructional help at a college.  Educational studios are colloquially referred to as "studio" by students, who are known for staying up late hours into the night doing projects and socializing.

The studio environment is characterized by 2 types in education:
# The workspace where students do usually visually-centered work in an open environment. This time and space is beyond that of instructional time and faculty guidance is not available. It allows for students to engage each other, help each other, and inspire each other while working.
# A type of class that takes the above-mentioned workshop space, and recreates its core component of an open working environment. It differentiates itself based on a topic of instruction, isolated space, instructor led/included, and an added focus of directed criticism. A great take on this latter type of "studio classroom" is [http://serc.carleton.edu/introgeo/studio/what.html described by Carleton University].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is studio teaching?|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/introgeo/studio/what.html|accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pottery studio==
[[Pottery|Studio pottery]] is made by an individual potter working on his own in his studio, rather than in a ceramics factory (although there may be a design studio within a larger manufacturing site).

==Production studios==
Production studios are those studios which act as centres for the production in any of the [[arts]]; alternatively they can also be the financial and commercial entity behind such endeavours. In radio and [[television production]] studio is the place where programs and [[radio commercial]] and [[television advertising]] are recorded for further emission.

===Animation studio===
[[Animation studio]]s, like [[movie studio]]s, may be production facilities, or financial entities. In some cases, especially in [[anime]], they continue the tradition of a studio where a [[Master tradesman|master]] or group of talented individuals oversee the work of lesser artists and crafts persons in realising their vision. Animation studios are a fast rising entity and they include established firms such as [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney]] and [[Pixar]].

===Comics studio===
Artists or writers, predominantly those producing [[comics]], still employ small studios of staff to assist in the creation of a [[comic strip]], [[comic book]] or [[graphic novel]].  In the early days of [[Dan Dare]], [[Frank Hampson]] employed a number of staff at his studio to help with the production of the strip.  [[Eddie Campbell]] is another creator who has assembled a small studio of colleagues to help him in his art, and the comic book industry of the United States has based its production methods upon the studio system employed at its beginnings.

==Instructional studio==
[[File:Student using Laptop.jpg|thumbnail|right|Student using a laptop in an instructional studio.]]
Many [[University|universities]] are creating studio settings for courses outside the artist's realm. There are several different projects along these lines, most notably the [[SCALE-UP]] (Student-Centered Active Learning Environment for Undergraduate Programs) initiated at [[NC State]].

===Mastering studio===
In audio, a mastering studio is a facility specialised in [[audio mastering]]. Tasks may include but not be limited to audio restoration, corrective and tone-shaping EQ, dynamic control, stereo or 5.1 surround editing, vinyl and tape transfers, vinyl cutting, and CD compilation. Depending on the quality of the original mix, the mastering engineer's role can change from small corrections to improving the overall sound of a mix drastically. Typically studios contain a combination of high-end analogue equipment with low-noise circuitry and digital hardware and plug-ins. Some may contain tape machines and vinyl lathes. They may also contain full-range monitoring systems and be acoustically tuned to provide an accurate reproduction of the sound information contained in the original medium. The mastering engineer must prepare the file for its intended destination, which may be radio, CD, vinyl or digital distribution.

In [[video production]], a mastering studio is a facility specialized in the [[post-production]] of video recordings. Tasks may include but not be limited to: [[video editing]], [[colour grading]] correction, mixing, [[DVD authoring]] and [[audio mastering]]. The mastering engineer must prepare the file for its intended destination, which may be broadcast, DVD or digital distribution.

===Acting studio===

An "acting studio" is an institution or workspace (similar to a dance studio) in which actors rehearse and refine their craft. The [[Neighborhood Playhouse]] and [[Actors Studio]] are legendary acting studios in New York.

===Movie studio===
{{Main|Movie studio}}

A '''movie studio''' is a [[company (law)|company]] which develops, equips and maintains a controlled environment for [[filmmaking]].  This environment may be interior ([[sound stage]]), exterior ([[backlot]]) or both.

===Photographic studio===
{{Main|Photographic studio}}

A photographic studio is both a workspace and a [[corporation|corporate]] body. As a workspace it provides space to take, develop, print and duplicate photographs.

===Radio studio===
{{Main|Radio studio}}

A radio studio is a room in which a [[Radio programming|radio program]] or show is produced, either for live [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] or for recording for a later broadcast.  The room is soundproofed to avoid unwanted noise being mixed into the broadcast.

===Recording studio===
{{Main|Recording studio}}

A recording studio is a facility for [[sound recording]] which generally consists of at least two rooms: the studio or live room, and the control room, where the sound from the studio is recorded and manipulated. They are designed so that they have good [[acoustics]] and so that there is good isolation between the rooms.

===Television studio===
{{Main|Television studio}}

A television studio is an installation in which television or [[video production]]s take place, for [[live television]], for recording [[video tape]], or for the acquisition of raw [[footage]] for [[post-production]]. The design of a studio is similar to, and derived from, [[movie studio]]s, with a few amendments for the special requirements of television production. A professional television studio generally has several rooms, which are kept separate for noise and practicality reasons.

==Yoga and martial arts studios==
Many of the healing arts and activities such as yoga, judo, karate are "studied" in a studio.  It is very common to see yoga studios and martial arts studios established in settings that might previously have been for other uses, described as studios.  These are not really recreation centers, or gyms in the traditional sense, but places where students of these activities practice or study their art.

'''Transculturation''' is a term coined by Cuban anthropologist [[Fernando Ortiz Fernández|Fernando Ortiz]] in 1947&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/s/a/sam50/readings521/ORTIZ_Counter-Engl.pdf Ortiz 1995], pp. v, 97&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the phenomenon of merging and converging cultures.

Transculturation encompasses more than transition from one culture to another; it does not consist merely of acquiring another culture (acculturation) or of losing or uprooting a previous culture (deculturation).  Rather, it merges these concepts and additionally carries the idea of the consequent creation of new cultural phenomena (neoculturation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ortiz|1995|pp=102–103|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/s/a/sam50/readings521/ORTIZ_Counter-Engl.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ortiz also referred to the devastating impact of Spanish colonialism on Cuba's indigenous peoples as a "failed transculturation". Transculturation can often be the result of colonial conquest and subjugation, especially in a postcolonial era as native peoples struggle to regain their own sense of identity.

In simple terms, transculturation reflects the natural tendency of people (in general) to resolve conflicts over time, rather than exacerbating them.  (In the modern context, both conflicts and resolutions are amplified by communication and transportation technology—the ancient tendency of cultures drifting or remaining apart has been replaced by stronger forces for bringing societies together.) Where transculturation impacts ethnicity and ethnic issues the term "ethnoconvergence" is sometimes used.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

In one general sense, transculturation covers [[war]], [[ethnic conflict]], [[racism]], [[multiculturalism]], [[cross-culturalism]], [[interracial marriage]], and any other of a number of contexts that deal with more than one culture.  In the other general sense, transculturation is one aspect of global phenomena and human events.

The general processes of transculturation are extremely complex—steered by powerful forces at the macrosocial level, yet ultimately resolved at the interpersonal level. The driving force for conflict is simple [[Proxemics|proximity]]—boundaries, once separating people (providing for a measure of isolation) become the issue of a conflict when societies encroach upon one another territorially.  If a means to co-exist cannot be immediately found, then conflicts can be hostile, leading to a process by which contact between individuals leads to some resolution. Often, history shows us, the processes of co-existence begins with hostilities, and with the natural passing of polarist individuals, comes the passing of their polarist sentiments, and soon some resolution is achieved.  Degrees of hostile conflict vary from outright genocidal conquest, to lukewarm infighting between differing political views within the same ethnic community.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

These changes often represent differences between homeland pons, and their [[diasporic]] communities abroad. Nevertheless, obstacles to '''ethnoconvergence''' are not great. The primary issue; [[language]], (''hence, communication and education'') can be overcome within a single generation—as is evident in the easy acclimation of children of foreign parents.  English, for example, is spoken by more non-Anglo-American people than Anglo-Americans, making it the current [[lingua-franca]], the worldwide de facto standard international language.

Processes of transculturation become more complex within the context of [[globalization]], given the multiple layers of abstraction that permeate everyday experiences. Elizabeth Kath argues that in the global era we can no longer consider transculturation only in relation to the face-to-face, but that we need to take into account the many layers of abstracted interactions that are interwoven through face-to-face encounters, a phenomenon that she describes as ''layers of transculturation''.&lt;ref&gt;Kath, Elizabeth (2015) [http://www.rowmaninternational.com/books/narratives-of-globalization "On Transculturation: Re-enacting and Remaking Latin Dance and Music in Foreign Lands"] In Julian Lee (Ed) ''Narratives of Globalization: Reflections on the Global Condition.''  Rowman &amp; Littlefield International&lt;/ref&gt; Kath draws upon the concept of constitutive abstraction as seen in the work of Australian social theorists Geoff Sharp&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Geoff (1993) "Extended Forms of the Social", ''Arena,'' 1&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]].&lt;ref&gt;James, Paul (1996) ''Nation Formation: Towards a Theory of Abstract Community,'' SAGE&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Emotional Ambivalence Across Times and Spaces: Mapping Petrarch's Intersecting Worlds|last = James|first = Paul|date = 2014|journal = Exemplaria|volume = 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homogenization versus ethnoconvergence==

It has been observed that even in monolingual, industrial societies like urban North America, some individuals do cling to a "modernized" primordial identity, apart from others. Some intellectuals, such as [[Michael Ignatieff]], argue that convergence of a general culture does not directly entail a similar convergence in [[ethnic]] identities. This can become evident in social situations, where people divide into separate groups, despite being of an identical "super-ethnicity", such as [[nationality]].

Within each smaller ethnicity, individuals may tend to see it perfectly justified to assimilate with other cultures, and some others view assimilation as wrong and incorrect for their culture. This common theme, representing dualist opinions of ethnoconvergence itself, within a single ethnic group is often manifested in issues of [[sexual partner]]s and [[marriage]], employment preferences, etc. These varied opinions of ethnoconvergence represent themselves in a spectrum; [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]], [[wikt:homogeneous|homogenization]], [[acculturation]], and [[cultural compromise]] are commonly used terms for ethnoconvegence which flavor the issues to a bias.

Often it's in a secular, multi-ethnic environment that cultural concerns are both minimised and exacerbated; Ethnic prides are boasted, hierarchy is created ("center" culture versus "periphery") but on the other hand, they will still share a common "culture", and common language and behaviours. Often the elderly, more conservative-in-association of a clan, tend to reject cross-cultural associations, and participate in ethnically similar community-oriented activities. [[Xenophobia|Xenophobes]] tend to think of cross-cultural contact as a component of assimilation, and see this as harmful.

==Obstacles to ethnoconvergence==

The obstacle to ethnoconvergence is [[ethnocentrism]], which is the view that one's culture is of greater importance than another's. Ethnocentrism often takes different forms, as it is a highly personal bias, and manifests itself in countless aspects of culture. [[Religion]], or belief, is the prime ethnocentric divider. Second is [[convention (norm)|custom]], which may overlap religion. With the adherence to each distinct component, comes the repulsion of the other. In most regions, ethnic divides are binary, meaning only two distinct cultures are present, each seeing the other as foreign. Many, however make the point that the binary example is the exception, and the norm is far more dynamic.

Ethnicity can be divided into two distinct areas, as they relate to ethnoconvergence:  Utilitarian traits, and traditional customs.

Religion, on the other hand, is a highly personal and attached part of culture. However, religion does not neatly correspond with ethnic identity. In many [[Multicultural|cosmopolitan]] societies, religion is everything—social, utilitarian, intellectual, political; from the point of view of people of immersed cultures; The very concept of ethnicity and its distinctions is incongruous to their immersed concepts.

In many societies, such as in those in Europe, languages are considered a significant component of ethnic values. This does not mean that most Europeans reject learning other languages. Quite the contrary, Europeans are often polyglots, and may label other individuals by their ethnicities; practical means of distinguishing cultures may resemble tendencies similar to ethnocentrism.

However, the political and cultural significance of regional or national languages are retained because these polyglots conform to the linguistic norms of the place they visit—doing "as the Romans do". Thus, conforming to the "ethnic integrity" of the region.

It has even become a cliché that "to learn a new language is to adopt a new soul". There are many other examples of the essential significance of language. In pre-[[Russia]]n [[Siberia]], [[Siberian Tatars|Tatar-Mongol]] colonists in the [[Taiga]] often recognized indigenous speakers of [[Turkic languages]] as their "own people" and non-Turkic groups as "foreigners", despite these indigenous groups having a similar level of material culture, and sharing much of a primitive culture with tribes foreign to the Muslim-Buddhist Tatar-Mongols.

==Transcultural communications==

In October 2011, U.S. communications agency [[Bromley Originate Change|Bromley]] launched a new model/[[strategy]] utilizing transcultural [[sociological]] theory as a means to segment and 'make sense' of the changing [[United States|American]] cultural landscape. Returning to classic social science as a solution, [[Bromley Originate Change|Bromley]] has embraced the anthropological approach put forward by thinkers like [[Fernando Ortiz Fernández|Fernando Ortiz]] as a way to account for ethnicity and language without being limited by them as a way for viewing the world.

[[File:12 Tribes of Israel Map.svg|thumb|upright|Map of the Twelve Tribes of Israel]]

According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], the '''Twelve Tribes of Israel''' or '''Tribes of Israel''' ({{lang-he|שבטי ישראל}}) descended from the [[12 (number)#In religion and mythology|12 sons]] of the patriarch [[Jacob]] (who was later named Israel) by two wives, [[Leah]] and [[Rachel]], and two [[Concubinage|concubines]], [[Zilpah]] and [[Bilhah]].

==Biblical tribes==
{{Tribes of Israel}}

{{Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|33:6–25|NKJV}} lists the twelve tribes:
* [[Tribe of Reuben|Reuben]]
* [[Tribe of Simeon|Simeon]]
* [[Tribe of Levi|Levi]]
* [[Tribe of Judah|Judah]]
* [[Tribe of Issachar|Issachar]]
* [[Tribe of Zebulun|Zebulun]]
* [[Tribe of Dan|Dan]]
* [[Tribe of Naphtali|Naphtali]]
* [[Tribe of Gad|Gad]]
* [[Tribe of Asher|Asher]]
* [[Tribe of Joseph|Joseph]] (including [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]] and [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]])
* [[Tribe of Benjamin|Benjamin]]

Jacob elevated the descendants of [[Ephraim]] and [[Manasseh]] (the two sons of [[Joseph (Genesis)|Joseph]] and his Egyptian wife [[Asenath]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Genesis|41:50|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the status of full tribes in their own right, replacing the tribe of Joseph.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Genesis|48:5|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the biblical narrative, the period from the [[conquest of Canaan]] under the leadership of [[Joshua]] until the formation of the first [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]], passed with the tribes forming a loose confederation, described in the [[Book of Judges]]. Modern scholarship has called into question the beginning, middle, and end of this picture&lt;ref name="McNutt1999"&gt;"In any case, it is now widely agreed that the so-called 'patriarchal/ancestral period' is a later 'literary' construct, not a period in the actual history of the ancient world. The same is the case for the ‘exodus’ and the 'wilderness period,' and more and more widely for the 'period of the Judges.'" {{cite book|author=Paula M.

Living in [[Babylonian captivity|exile]] in the sixth century BCE, the prophet [[Ezekiel]] has a vision for the restoration of Israel,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Ezekiel|47:13|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a future utopia in which the twelve tribes of Israel are living in their land again.&lt;ref name="Chyutin2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Chyutin|title=Architecture and Utopia in the Temple Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kqB4ZSmemnkC&amp;pg=PA170|date=1 January 2006|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-0-567-03054-2|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Christianity==

In the [[Christian]] [[New Testament]], the twelve tribes of Israel are referred to twice in the [[gospels]] and twice in the [[Book of Revelation]]. In Matthew, [[Parallel passage|paralleled]] by Luke, [[Jesus]] anticipates that in the [[Kingdom of God]], his followers will "sit on [twelve] thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|19:28|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|22:30|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the vision of the writer of the Book of Revelation, [[144000 (number)|144,000]] of all the tribes of the children of Israel were "sealed", 12,000 from each tribe&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Revelation|7:1-8|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in his vision of the [[New Jerusalem|New or Heavenly Jerusalem]], the tribes' names were written on the city gates:{{quote|The names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel: three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Revelation|21:12-13|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7153">An '''umbrella title''' is a formal or informal name connecting a number of individual items with a common theme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.yale.edu/~okerson/yea/yeaappendC.pdf Description of Metadata Elements in the Yale Electric Library Archive (glossary)]&lt;/ref&gt; It is most often used in lieu of listing separately the separate components or providing a convenient "label" for a collection of [[discipline]]s.

==Uses of umbrella titles==
===Academia===
Nonspecific fields of study are identified by umbrella titles such as "[[physics]]", "[[physical education]]", and "[[medicine]]", to distinguish them from specialized fields of study such as [[exercise physiology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.css.edu/tboone2/asep/julyasep.html Glossary from American Society of Exercise Physiologists newsletter, July 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific conferences and discussions===
Many [[scientific conference|scientific]] and [[academic conference]]s use umbrella titles as unifying themes for the activities scheduled in the course of the conference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aafp.org/online/en/home/cme/cmea/glossary.html Glossary from American Academy of Family Physicians]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employment===
Umbrella titles in common use involve either general job descriptions of a group of workers with similar responsibilities (like "teacher")&lt;ref&gt;[http://66.218.69.11/search/cache?ei=UTF-8&amp;p=%22Umbrella+title%22+definition&amp;fr=slv8-msgr&amp;u=www.dps109.org/File.asp%3FID%3D1027%26ws%3D&amp;w=%22umbrella+title%22+definition&amp;d=SsirS_mdOeij&amp;icp=1&amp;.intl=us Collective Bargaining Agreement between Board of Education Deerfield District #109 and Deerfield Education Association, IEA-NEA]&lt;/ref&gt; or rank (military or nonmilitary).

===Politics and law===
Collections of organizations with a common legal or legislative interest are often "united" under an umbrella title for the purposes of [[lobbying]] or participating in a [[lawsuit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sierraclub.org/environmentallaw/blog/2006/09/global-warming-in-supreme-court.asp "Global Warming in the Supreme Court"] - Sierra Club article mentioning umbrella groups (and an umbrella title) in lawsuit&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entertainment and literature===
Umbrella titles are widely used in music, literature, television, and theater. Uses of umbrella titles vary widely in the arts, to a much greater spectrum of use than in other fields of study.

====Music and dance====
Umbrella titles are used to demarcate the music field into general trends or styles: [[classical music]], [[jazz]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umass.edu/fac/media/danilo.pdf University of Massachusetts program for Danelo Pérez concert] - includes history and terminology of jazz&lt;/ref&gt; [[rock music]], [[hip hop]], [[rhythm and blues]] and other labels which each cover more specialized musical styles. A similar "structure" can be found in the field of dance.

Prior to the sale of the [[long playing record]] in 1950, albums containing several 78 revolutions-per-minute records were often sold under umbrella titles (a collection of recordings from ''[[Oklahoma (musical)|Oklahoma]]'', for example).  It can be argued that titles of all long-playing records and [[compact disc]]s are "umbrella" titles—and several such recordings with a common theme often have an umbrella title (such as [[Chip Davis]]' "[[Mannheim Steamroller|Day Parts]]" series) as well.

====Television====
While it can be argued that every title of a televised series, especially those primarily used to designate a time period rather than actual programming (like ''NBC Monday Night at the Movies'') is an umbrella, the term is more appropriately applied to names of [[anthology series]], series that combine together to provide a common theme (such as the three components of ''[[90 Bristol Court]]''), [[wheel series]], and other series under a common heading (such as ''[[Crimetime After Primetime]]'' and ''[[Four in One]]'').

While it was common practice in the 1950s and early 1960s for series to alternate or otherwise share a time slot in [[United States|American]] broadcast network television (for example, ''[[The Jack Benny Show]]'' shared a time slot with, first ''[[Private Secretary (TV series)|Private Secretary]]'' and then ''[[The George Gobel Show]]''), umbrella titles were not used by United States' networks until 1964, when [[NBC]] presented three half-hour programs on Monday nights as a programming block centered at a southern California apartment complex, ''90 Bristol Court''.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Brooks and Earle Marsh, ''The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-Present'' (2003) {{ISBN|0-345-45542-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''TV Guide Guide to TV 2006'' (2006) {{ISBN|0-7607-7572-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the 1964 programming experiment did not succeed (two of the series were cancelled; the third lasted the broadcast season but was not renewed for the 1965-1966 season), NBC was not dissuaded from further programming experimentation. Within a decade, the network then experimented with wheel series, first with ''Four in One'' and ''[[The Bold Ones]]'', then with ''[[NBC Mystery Movie]]''.  Afterwards additional wheel series were presented by American broadcast networks, to varying degrees of success. The expirement was revived in 1979 with ''[[Cliffhangers (TV series)|Cliffhangers]]''.

In the United Kingdom, umbrella titles were used in varying degrees in their programming as well. The long-running ''[[Doctor Who]]'' used umbrella titles on several levels, first with individual named episodes under the umbrella of the title of an overall story (the first four episodes were commonly called "An Unearthly Child" even though none of them actually showed it to be the title of the story); even after the naming of individual episodes ceased, umbrella titles were often used to collect [[story arc|stories with a common enemy or theme]] ([[Dalek]]s stories, [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] stories, [[United Nations Intelligence Taskforce|UNIT]] stories, and season-long "Key to Time" and "[[The Trial of a Time Lord|Trial of a Time Lord]]").

====Motion pictures and literature====
The use of umbrella titles in motion pictures parallels their use in literature. Movie trilogies such as ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|Lord of the Rings]]'' and the ''[[Three Colors]]'' trilogy (''a.k.a.'' "Red, White, and Blue trilogy") commonly are called by umbrella titles, as was the case for their literary cousins (such as [[John Dos Passos]]' ''[[USA trilogy|U.S.A.]]'').  Umbrella titles were often used to cover longer sequences of motion pictures or novels (such as the [[James Bond]] and ''[[Star Wars]]'' films and [[Marcel Proust]]'s multi-volume ''[[Remembrance of Things Past]]''). Often umbrella titles are used to collect motion pictures with common stars ("[[Marx Brothers]] movies") or common characters ("[[Dirty Harry]] movies"), as is the case for novels or comics ("[[Perry Mason]] novels", for example). In literature, sometimes an umbrella title is used for a collection of stories with a common locality, such as the [[Wessex]] novels of [[Thomas Hardy]].

The '''values''' embodied in [[cultural heritage]]&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. Marshall Rev. Intell. Prop. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt; are identified in order to assess significance, prioritize resources, and inform [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]] decision-making. It is recognised that values may compete and change over time, and that heritage may have different meanings for different [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]].

==Origins==
[[Alois Riegl]] is credited with developing [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]]'s concept of 'voicefulness' into a systematic categorization of the different values of a [[monument]]. In his 1908 essay ''Der moderne Denkmalkultus'' (The modern cult of monuments) he describes historical value, artistic value, age value, commemorative value, use value, and newness value. Riegl demonstrates that some of these values conflict and argues that they may be culturally [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Historical and Philosophical Issues in the Conservation of Cultural Heritage |author=Stanley Price, Nicholas ''et al.'' (edd.) |publisher=[[Getty Conservation Institute]] |pages=18–21, 69–83 |ISBN=0-89236-398-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charters and Conventions==
The [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Convention]] addresses cultural sites of outstanding universal value, from a [[History|historical]], [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]], [[Science|scientific]], [[Ethnology|ethnological]] or [[Anthropology|anthropological]] perspective, and highlights the need for [[Authenticity (heritage)|authenticity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/opguide08-en.pdf |title=Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention |pages=13, 94) |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussed in the 1964 [[Venice Charter]], values and the question 'why conserve?' are the focus of the 1979 [[Burra Charter]] (last revised 1999). Cultural significance is said to be 'embodied' in the fabric, setting, use, associations, and meanings of a place, and includes aesthetic, historic, scientific, social and spiritual values for past, present and future generations. In order to preserve such values a 'cautious approach' of [[minimum intervention]] is advocated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://australia.icomos.org/wp-content/uploads/BURRA_CHARTER.pdf |title=Burra Charter (''vid.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5679">'''Water marble nails''' are a [[nail art]] technique involving dropping [[nail lacquer]]s into clear water and creating a pattern on the water surface, the pattern is then transferred to the nails.

== History ==
The water marble nail technique was originally developed by professional nail technicians in Japanese nail salons. In the 1990s, it was popularized by commercial publications released by shopping centers in [[Chiba, Chiba|Chiba]], [[Japan]]. In 2010, water marble nail art was adapted to use acrylic [[artificial nails]] and gels.

The water marble nail technique has gained popularity across the globe through features in magazines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nailpro.com/water-marble-manicure/ | title=Water Marble Manicure | work=Nail Pro | date=24 June 2011 | author=James, Megan}}&lt;/ref&gt; websites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nair|first=Sonia|title=Create Marble Nail Art Using Water|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/create-marble-nail-art-using-water.html|work=Buzzle|accessdate=9 December 2013|date=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Denza|first=Diana|title=How To Create The Water Marble Nail Manicure|url=http://www.bettyconfidential.com/ar/ld/a/how-to-create-the-water-marble-nail-manicure.html/|work=Betty Confidential|accessdate=9 December 2013|date=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  polish makers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pupa.it/ita/pupa-nail-academy/Video-nail-academy/spring-flowers-con-tecnica-water-marble.aspx | title=Spring Flowers con Tecnica Water Marble | work=Pupa Milano | language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sagaraya|first=Sonal|title=DIY Marble Nail Art Stickers|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5S2QGHfOH0|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=9 December 2013|date=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Water marble nail method3.JPG|thumb|Water marble nail art method, free-dragging]]
[[File:Water marble nail method2.JPG|thumb|Water marble nail art method, free-dropping]]
There are two main types of water marble nail art methods: free-dragging and free-dropping. Free-dragging is more common.

===Free-dragging===
Dragged patterns range from simple circular shapes to complicated drawings. Patterns such as marble, hearts/peacocks,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The pattern called "hearts" is also called "peacock", the name of a professional nail art technique. Drawing a "peacock" is one challenge to professional nail artists sponsored by the Japan Nailist Association.&lt;/ref&gt; animals, flowers, leaves, parallel lines, [[Psychedelic art|psychedelics]], spiderwebs, and random patterns in the style of designer [[Emilio Pucci]] are generally performed with nail lacquers and some kind of tool.

===Free-dropping===
Dropped patterns range from colored shapes to complicated drawings such as spirals and geometric designs. The free patterns are created by colored drops of nail lacquer. For free-dropping, lacquer colors are dropped straight or diagonally onto the water. The pattern floats on the surface of the water.

== Technique ==
{{Refimprove|section|date=November 2016}}
Water marble nail art requires clean water, nail lacquers for free-dropping, and a stick for drawing patterns. Before patterns are created, the nails are painted with a light-colored nail polish that establishes a good contrast with the colors chosen to create the water marble. Some techniques use a matte coat to provide contrast and maintain an even look.

After the base coat has dried, tape is put around the fingers to gather the excess nail polish after the marbling. One or two drops of colored lacquer are chosen for the design and are added to a cup of clean water. The drops will create a circle on the water surface. The next color is added on top of the circle created by the previous drop. The resulting pattern is ready for application to the nail, but it can still be modified with a stick or toothpick to create different shapes. The nail is dipped into the pattern on the water and kept under water as a [[Q-tip]] is used to "grab" the remaining polish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Namuli|first1=Mary Janet|title=Water Marble Nails - What You Need To Know|url=http://www.designsauthority.com/water-marble-nails/|website=Designs Authority|accessdate=27 November 2016|date=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
