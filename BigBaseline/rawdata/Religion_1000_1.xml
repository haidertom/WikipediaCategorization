[[File:40 Window world map.PNG|thumb|upright=1.5|The nations in the 10/40 Window]]
The '''10/40 Window''' is a term coined by [[mission (Christian)|Christian missionary]] strategist and Partners International CEO [[Luis Bush]] in 1990&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101030630/map/ |title=The 10/40 Window |work=Time |date=June 30, 2003| accessdate= March 1, 2007 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070428234833/http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101030630/map/| archivedate= April 28, 2007 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}.

At the time, the authoritative source for socioeconomic and political metrics for every nation. Extreme poverty was denoted as under US$500 per capita GNP (in 1990 dollars).

What is least controversial is those areas with least access throughout history, as all metrics for such areas are zero or close to zero. Examples of metrics used include the presence of (Christian) work and workers (of any kind, whether community development, health, business, child care, house servants, etc), media in an appropriate language (print, TV, radio, web, etc.),&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ow&gt;[[Operation World]] provides a concise well-researched/cited data summary for each nation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wce&gt;{{cite book|last=Barrett|first=David B.|author2=Kurian, George T.|author3=Johnson, Todd M.

The concept behind the ''10/40 Window'' highlights these three elements (as of data available in 1990): an area of the world with great poverty and low quality of life, combined with lack of access to Christian resources. The Window forms a band encompassing [[Sahara]]n and Northern Africa, as well as almost all of Asia (West Asia, Central Asia, South Asia, East Asia and much of Southeast Asia). Roughly two-thirds of the world population lived in the 10/40 Window, and it is predominantly [[Muslim]], [[Hindu]], [[Buddhist]], [[animist]], [[Jewish]], or [[atheist]]. Many governments in the 10/40 Window are officially or unofficially opposed to Christian work of any kind within their borders.&lt;ref name=wfb/&gt;&lt;ref name=ow/&gt;&lt;ref name=wce/&gt;

==Origin==
This region of the world was previously known to Christians as the "resistant belt", as noted by [[Luis Bush]] at the 1989 [[Second International Congress on World Evangelization|Lausanne II Conference in Manila]]. In 1990, Bush's research led to a meeting with Pete Holzmann, a leader of the team developing the first PC-based [[GIS]] software.&lt;ref&gt;Atlas GIS, produced by Strategic Mapping Inc., was the first PC Geographic Information System.{{cite news|url=http://www.gismonitor.com/news/newsletter/archive/040501.php |title=ESRI Retires ArcCAD and Atlas GIS| accessdate= September 21, 2007 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070925180632/http://www.gismonitor.com/news/newsletter/archive/040501.php| archivedate= September 25, 2007 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; They analyzed the region using a box between 10 and 40 degrees north latitude and called it the ''10/40 box''. A few weeks later, Bush and his wife Doris were inspired to rename it the ''10/40 Window'', stating that this region ought to be seen as a "window of opportunity".{{citation needed |date= September 2007}} The analysis and concept was a generalization that focuses on a region, not a sharp boundary defining what is a priority, and what is not. For this reason, many missiologists prefer to use the phrase ''10/40 Window region''.

Before being called the "resistant belt", the Islamic portions of this region, as well as selected unreached Buddhist and Hindu areas, were referred to as the "unoccupied fields" by [[Samuel Marinus Zwemer|Samuel Zwemer]], in his book by that same title, published in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zwemer|first=Samuel M. |title=The Unoccupied Mission Fields of Africa and Asia|location=New York|publisher=Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions|page=260|year=1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Some&lt;ref&gt;Verbal and online discussions, no documentation available outside of Wikipedia itself.&lt;/ref&gt; have objected to such a broad-brush term which seems to imply a unifying characteristic of the 10/40 Window when in fact no large area of the planet is completely homogenous in cultural attributes.

The 1990 research data states:
* this part of the world was home to the largest populations living in deep poverty and lowest [[quality of life]];&lt;ref name=wfb/&gt;&lt;ref name=mappoor/&gt;&lt;ref name=mapqual/&gt;
* this part of the world did have least access to Christian resources. Note the emphasis on ''access'' not ''percent Christian''. The West has ubiquitous access to such resources; this area of the world did and does not.&lt;ref name=ow/&gt;&lt;ref name=wce/&gt;

This research deals in overall population characteristics. The ''10/40 Window'' is a term that helps people visualize the general area of the analysis, where the above characteristics are generally true, but with exceptions proving it is only a generalization. Some examples of the exceptions:
* The 10/40 Window article refers to the "poorest of the poor" living in that region (based on late-1980s per-capita [[GNP]] under US$500).&lt;ref name=wfb/&gt;&lt;ref name=ow/&gt; Of the three billion people living in such poverty-stricken nations, 82% lived in the 10/40 Window. Yet the 10/40 Window also includes nations such as [[South Korea]] and Japan. In the late 20th century, Japan boasted the world's third largest economy, and South Korea the eleventh. Such nations were strong throughout the late 20th century.
* Geographically, the 10/40 Window includes the [[Philippines]] and [[Portugal]], which both have a Roman Catholic Christian majority; [[Greece]], where almost 98% of the population belonged to the [[Greek Orthodox Church]]; and South Korea, which is home to the largest single congregation church in the world&lt;ref&gt;The largest congregation is in Seoul ([[Yoido Full Gospel Church]]) {{cite news |url=http://mondaymorninginsight.typepad.com/monday_morning_insight_we/2005/05/the_top_10_chur.html |title=The Top 10 Churches in the World (by size)| accessdate= August 20, 2007 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070927162953/http://mondaymorninginsight.typepad.com/monday_morning_insight_we/2005/05/the_top_10_chur.html| archivedate= September 27, 2007 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also the second largest missionary-sending nation in the world.&lt;ref name=misinc&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ctlibrary.com/ct/2006/march/16.28.html |title=Missions Incredible|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107083606/http://www.ctlibrary.com/ct/2006/march/16.28.html|archivedate=November 7, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 10/40 Window does not encompass [[Indonesia]] or Sri Lanka, nations that had very little access to Christian resources.&lt;ref name=ow/&gt;

==Gaining widespread use==
Over the years, the 10/40 Window has evolved from a specialist term used by Christian [[Missiology|missiologists]] to assumed vocabulary for Christians in the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charismamag.com/display.php?id=792 |title=Becoming Global Christians in the 21st Century By Justin Long – Charisma Magazine, (2001) |publisher=Charismamag.com |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charismamag.com/display.php?id=1575 |title=Islam and China's Christmas By David Aikman – Charisma Magazine, (2002) |publisher=Charismamag.com |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/tcw/2003/001/11.12.html |title=Marli Spieker &amp;#124; Today's Christian Woman &amp;#124; Your Life.

==Analysis==
The original 1990 GIS 10/40 Window analysis produced several insights, among them showing that the nations of the 10/40 Window represented (as of the research date):
*82% of the poorest of the world's poor (per capita GNP less than US$500 per year),&lt;ref name=mappoor&gt;{{cite map|publisher=AD2000|title=The Poorest Countries &amp; The 10/40 Window|edition=August 1, 1990|cartography=GMI/GRDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*84% of those with lowest quality of life (life expectancy, infant mortality, and literacy),&lt;ref name=mapqual&gt;{{cite map|publisher=AD2000|title=Quality of Life &amp; The 10/40 Window|edition=August 1, 1990|cartography=GMI/GRDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the hub of the world's major non-Christian religions (Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, etc.,)&lt;ref name=maprel&gt;{{cite map|publisher=AD2000|title=Three Religious Blocks &amp; The 10/40 Window|edition=August 1, 1990|cartography=GMI/GRDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mapislam&gt;{{cite map|publisher=AD2000|title=Islam &amp;  &amp; The 10/40 Window|edition=August 1, 1990|cartography=GMI/GRDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*close to 100% of those who were both most-poor ''and'' had least-access to Christian resources (two-dimensional analysis)&lt;ref name=mapprun&gt;{{cite map|publisher=AD2000|title=The Poor, The Unevangelized, &amp; The 10/40 Window|edition=August 1, 1990|cartography=GMI/GRDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The least Christian resource investment&lt;ref&gt;Well below 10 percent in any of the study populations. Each of the cited maps provides side data on population, Christian involvement, etc in the various study populations (poor, low quality of life, non-Christian, etc)&lt;/ref&gt; and least sharing of the Christian message&lt;ref name=mapleast&gt;{{cite map|publisher=AD2000|title=The 55 Least Evangelized Countries &amp; The 10/40 Window|edition=August 1, 1990|cartography=GMI/GRDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GIS analysis utilized country-level data from the Operation World&lt;ref name=ow/&gt; almanac, the [[World Christian Encyclopedia]],&lt;ref name=wce/&gt; and the [[World Factbook]].&lt;ref name=wfb/&gt;

===Non-Christians in the 10/40 Window by religion===
The first edition GIS analysis maps highlighted the three major religious blocks in the 10/40 Window, specifically the majority Muslim, Hindu and Buddhist nations. Population estimates at the time for the year 2000 (from Operation World) were given as:
* 28 Muslim countries, 1.1 billion population est. (2000)
* 2 Hindu countries, 1.1 billion population est. (2000)
* 8 Buddhist countries, 237 million population est. (2000)

[http://home.snu.edu/~hculbert/1040.htm Later updates] have been based more on census data and other estimates rather than forward-looking population estimates. The cited reference provides the following estimate of "[[unreached]]" non-Christian populations in the 10/40 Window:
*865 million Muslims
*550 million Hindus
*275 million Buddhists
*140 million in 2550 tribal groups (mainly animist)
*17 million Jews&lt;ref&gt;Note that this number is higher than the census-based world total of 14 million. However, even authoritative [http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/jewpop.html Jewish sources] state that many Jews do not identify themselves in population censuses.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nations in the 10/40 Window===
The 10/40 Window originally encompassed the following 57 countries. An expanded list including some important nearby nations is offered by the [[Joshua Project]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://joshuaproject.net/resources/articles/10_40_window |title=What is the 10/40 Window? |publisher=joshuaproject.net |accessdate=May 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5865">The '''1888–1893 Uprisings of Hazaras''' occurred when the [[Treaty of Gandomak]] was signed and the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] ended in 1880, causing [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] to set out on a goal to bring Hazarajat and [[Kafiristan]] under his control. He launched several campaigns in Hazarajat due to resistance from the Hazaras in which his forces committed atrocities. The southern part of Hazarajat was spared as they accepted his rule, while the other parts of Hazarajat rejected Abdur Rahman and instead supported his uncle, [[Sher Ali Khan]]. In response to this Abdur Rahman waged a war against tribal leaders who rejected his policies and rule.&lt;ref name="Monsutti"&gt;"HAZĀRA: ii. HISTORY". Alessandro Monsutti (Online ed.).

==First uprising==
The first Hazara uprising against Abdur Rahman Khan took place between 1888 and 1890. When Emir Abdur Rahman's cousin, Mohammad Eshaq, revolted against him, tribal leaders of the Sheikh Ali Hazaras joined the revolt. The revolt was short lived as the Emir extended his control over large parts of Hazarajat.

After all of Sheikh Ali Hazaras' chiefs were sent to [[Kabul]], opposition within the leadership of Sawar Khan and Syed Jafar Khan continued against the government troops, but at last were defeated. Taxes were imposed and Afghan administrators were sent to occupied places, where they subjugated the people with abuses.&lt;ref name="Monsutti"/&gt; People were disarmed, villages were looted, local tribal chiefs were imprisoned or executed, and the better lands were confiscated and given to Afghan [[nomad]]s ([[Kuchis]]).&lt;ref name=Mousavi/&gt;

==Second uprising==
The second uprising occurred in the Spring of 1892. According to [[Syed Askar Mousavi]], the cause of the uprising was an assault on the wife of a Hazara Chieftain by Afghan soldiers.  The families of both the man and his wife, deciding that death was one hundred times better than such humiliation, killed the soldiers involved and attacked the local garrison, from whence they recovered their confiscated arms".&lt;ref name="Monsutti"/&gt; Several other tribal chiefs who supported Abdur Rahman now turned against him and joined the rebellion which rapidly spread through the entire Hazarajat. In response to the rebellion, the Emir declared a "[[jihad]]" against the Shias&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Refworld {{!}} World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples – Afghanistan : Hazaras|url = http://www.refworld.org/docid/49749d693d.html|website = Refworld|access-date = 2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and raised an army of up to 40, 000 soldiers, 10, 000 mounted troops, and 100,000 armed civilians (most of which were Pashtun nomads).&lt;ref name="Monsutti"/&gt; He also brought in [[British Raj|British]] military advisers to assist his army.&lt;ref name=Mousavi&gt;{{cite book |last= Mousavi|first= Sayed Askar|title= The Hazaras of Afghanistan: An Historical, Cultural, Economic and Political Study|origyear= 1997|year= 1998 |publisher= St. Martin's Press|location = Richmond, NY|isbn= 0-312-17386-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hazara people}}
The third uprising of Hazara was in response to the harsh repression; the Hazara revolted again by early 1893. This revolt took the government forces by surprise and the Hazara managed to take most of Hazarajat back. However, after months of fighting, they were eventually defeated due to a shortage of food. Small pockets of resistance continued to the end of the year as government troops committed atrocities against civilians and deported entire villages.&lt;ref name=Mousavi/&gt;

Abdur Rahman's subjugation of the Hazara due to fierce rebellion against the Afghan king gave birth to strong hatred between the Pahstun and Hazara for years to come. Massive forced displacements, especially in Oruzgan and [[Daychopan District|Daychopan]], continued as lands were confiscated and populations were expelled or fled. Some 35,000 families fled to northern Afghanistan, [[Mashhad]] (Iran) and [[Quetta]] (Pakistan). Hazara farmers were often forced to give up their property to Pashtuns&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = تاریخ باستانی هزاره ها|last = دلجو|first = عباس|publisher = انتشارات امیری|year = 2014|isbn = 9936801504|location = کابل|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result many Hazara families had to leave seasonally to the [[List of cities in Afghanistan|major cities in Afghanistan]], Iran, or Pakistan in order to find jobs and a source of income. Quetta in Pakistan is home to the third largest settlements of Hazara outside Afghanistan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5514">[[Image:Vank Cathedral - Heaven-Earth-Hell fresco.jpg|thumb|A fresco showing heaven above, and hell below, [[Vank Cathedral]], Iran]]
The '''allegory of the long spoons''' is a [[parable]] that shows the difference between heaven and hell by means of people forced to eat with long spoons. It is attributed to Rabbi Haim of [[Rumšiškės|Romshishok]], as well as other sources.&lt;ref name="tribune"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-08-23/features/sns-201208221330--tms--godsqudctngs-a20120823-20120823_1_remarkable-story-heaven-text|title=Famous spiritual story varies among faiths and cultures, but carries the same message|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[hell]] the people are unable to lift food to their mouths using such unwieldy cutlery, and are starving. In [[heaven]], the diners feed one another across the table and are sated. The story can encourage people to be kind to each other. There are [[#Interpretation|various interpretations]] of the fable including its [[#sermons|use in sermons]] and in advice to lonely people.

== Interpretation ==
The story suggests that people have the opportunity to use what they are given (the long spoons in this allegory) to help nourish each other, but the problem, as Haim points out, lies in how the people treat each other.

Given the same level playing field one group of people who treat each other well will create a pleasant environment. Whereas another group of people, given exactly the same tools to work with, can create unpleasant conditions simply by how they treat each other. Writer [[Dawn Eden]] suggests that this is a simple truth which can be easily forgotten by lonely people unable to see their situation clearly. She argues that such situations can be improved by reaching out to others.&lt;ref name="eden" /&gt;

== Variations ==
The long spoons allegory has become part of the [[folklore]] of several cultures, for example: Jewish,&lt;ref name=allegory&gt;{{cite web|last=Rabbi|first=Haim|title=Narrative of the allegory|url=http://www.hodu.com/parable.shtml|work=Citation source|publisher=Hodu|accessdate=6 Aug 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204060500/http://hodu.com/parable.shtml|archive-date=2011-02-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu,&lt;ref name=hindu&gt;{{cite web|last=Lord|first=Shiva|title=Hindu parable: A Long Handled Spoon|url=http://www.forwardsteps.com.au/LongHandledSpoon.html|work=Swami|accessdate=5 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Horn|first=Nils|title=Yoga Basic Knowledge and Exercises By|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oriental&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Peseschkian|first=Nossrat|title=Oriental stories as tools in psycho therapy|year=1986|publisher=Springer-Verlag|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Christian.&lt;ref name="eden" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tietze|first=Harald W|title=Happyology|publisher=The Pope tells the story of the long spoons|pages=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; In medieval Europe, the food in the story is a bowl of stew; in China, it is a bowl of rice being eaten with long chopsticks.&lt;ref name="tribune"/&gt;

In some versions of the story the diners are using regular cutlery but are unable to bend their arms,&lt;ref name="tribune"/&gt; with a story attributed to Rabbi Haim of Romshishok describing how "both arms were splinted with wooden slats so he could not bend either elbow to bring the food to his mouth".

During [[conflict resolution]] in non-Western cultures{{which|date=May 2014}} communicating difficult truths is better through a third party who can make suggestions through such stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swami|first=Vinod|title=Conflict Mediation Across Cultures|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art and popular culture==
&lt;span id="sermons"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;While the parable itself is seldom depicted in art, it is well known and used in sermons when referring to hell, where the fashion for depicting hell in terrible, painful, gruesome terms is fading in recent times.&lt;ref name="eden"&gt;{{cite book|last=Eden|first=Dawn|title=The Thrill of the Chaste: Finding Fulfillment While Keeping Your Clothes On|year=2006|isbn=978-0-8499-1311-2|pages=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parable is told by [[Norman McCay]] in the novelization of ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]''. In the 2011 [[Boardwalk Empire]] episode, "Under God's Power She Flourishes", Father Brennan tells Margaret the Allegory of the Long Spoons while Emily is fitted for leg braces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2046372/synopsis?ref_=tt_ft|title="Boardwalk Empire" Under God's Power She Flourishes (2011) - Synopsis|work=IMDb|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A scene in the 2013 thriller ''[[The East (film)|The East]]'' draws strong comparisons to the allegory when protagonist Sarah is depicted as selfish for neglecting to feed her adjacent diner, whilst in a straitjacket. It is also retold in [[Barbara Kingsolver]]'s novel, ''[[The Bean Trees]]''.

In Scotland, it is often said "It taks a lang spoon tae sup wi a [[Fife|Fifer]]".

[[Caritas (charity)|Caritas]] made an animation video based on this allegory for their campaign "One human family, food for all".&lt;ref&gt;[http://food.caritas.org/video-one-human-family-food-for-all/ Caritas's Video "One human family, food for all"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Animatism''' is a term coined by British [[anthropologist]] Robert Marett to refer to "a belief in a generalized, impersonal power over which people have some measure of control".&lt;ref name="Ferraro, Gary 2008. p. 340"&gt;Ferraro, Gary. 2008. ''Cultural Anthropology: An Applied Perspective, 7th ed.'' Belmont, CA: Thompson Wadsworth. p. 340&lt;/ref&gt; Marett argues that certain cultures believe "people, animals, plants, and inanimate objects were endowed with certain powers, which were both impersonal and supernatural."&lt;ref name="Ferraro, Gary 2008. p. 340" /&gt; ''[[Mana]]'', Marett states, is a concentrated form of animatistic force found within any of these objects that confer power, strength, and success.&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro, Gary. 2008.

'''''Anito''''', also spelled '''''anitu''''', refers to [[ancestor spirit]]s, [[nature spirit]]s, and deities (''[[diwata]]'') in the indigenous [[Animism|animistic]] religions of [[History of the Philippines (900–1521)|precolonial Philippines]]. It can also refer to carved humanoid figures, the '''''taotao''''', made of wood, stone, or ivory, that represent these spirits.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hislop"/&gt;

'''''Pag-anito''''' refers to a [[séance]], often accompanied by other rituals or celebrations, in which a shaman ([[Visayan languages|Visayan]]: ''[[babaylan]]'', [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]: ''[[katalonan]]'') acts as a [[mediumship|medium]] to communicate directly with the spirits. When a nature spirit or deity is specifically involved, the ritual is called '''''pagdiwata'''''. The act of worship or a religious sacrifice to a spirit is also sometimes simply referred to as ''anito''.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Henry Scott  | authorlink = William Henry Scott (historian)   | url = https://archive.org/details/BarangaySixteenthCenturyPhilippineCultureAndSociety | title = Barangay: Sixteenth Century Philippine Culture and Society  | publisher = Ateneo de Manila University Press  | date = 1994  | location = Quezon City  | isbn = 9715501354 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991"&gt;{{cite book |url= |title=The Soul Book: Introduction to Philippine Pagan Religion | last1 =  Demetrio | first1 = Francisco R. | last2 =  Cordero-Fernando | first2 = Gilda | last3 = Nakpil-Zialcita | first4 = Fernando| last4 =  Feleo | first3 = Roberto B.  |date= 1991 |publisher=  GCF Books, Quezon City |year= |isbn= |editor-last= |editor-first= |edition= |volume= |location= |pages= |authorlink2= Gilda Cordero-Fernando| asin=B007FR4S8G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rosa"&gt;{{cite book|author=Antonio Sánchez de la Rosa|title =Diccionario Hispano-Bisaya para las provincias de Samar y Leyte, Volumes 1-2|publisher =Tipo-Litografia de Chofre y Comp.|year =1895|page=414|url =https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=7EwHAQAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''ninunò'' (lit. "ancestor") can be the spirits of actual ancestors or generalized guardian spirits of a family. Ancient Filipinos believed that upon death, the [[Astral body|soul]] (Visayan: ''kalag''; Tagalog: ''kaluluwa'')&lt;ref group="note"&gt;It should be noted that among most Filipino ethnic groups, a person is believed to be composed of at least two souls - the breath of life, will, or awareness (''ginhawa'' or ''hininga'', which stays with the living body) and the [[Astral body|astral soul]] (which can travel to the spirit world). ''Kalag'' and ''kaluluwa'' refer to the latter. The concept of [[soul dualism]] is sometimes referred to as "twin souls" or "double souls" and is a common belief in Austronesian cultures and other [[shamanistic]] cultures. Other names for the astral soul include ''kaluha'', ''dungan'' (Visayan); ''kalag'' ([[Bicolano people|Bicol]]); ''linnawa'' ([[Igorot people|Igorot]]), ''kaduwa'' ([[Isneg people|Isneg]]), ''ab-abiik'' ([[Kankanaey people|Kankanaey]]), ''karurua'' ([[Ilocano people|Ilocano]]), ''ikaruruwa'' ([[Ibanag people|Ibanag]]), ''karaduwa'' ([[Mangyan people|Mangyan]]), ''kiyaraluwa'' ([[Tagbanwa people|Tagbanwa]]), ''makatu'' ([[Bukidnon people|Bukidnon]]), and ''kadengan-dengan'' or ''gimokud'' ([[Manobo people|Manobo]]). (Scott, 1994; Tan, 2008; Mercado, 1991) Most of the terms for the astral soul literally translate to "twin" or "double", from PAN *duSa, "two".

There can be multiple locations in the spirit world, varying in different ethnic groups.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Compare with the [[Greek underworld]]&lt;/ref&gt; Which place souls end up in depends on how they died, the age at death, or the conduct of the person when they were alive. There was no concept of heaven or hell prior to the introduction of [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]];&lt;ref group="note"&gt;After Spanish contact, various spirit worlds were syncretized into the Christian concept of heaven and hell in dictionaries and Bible translations. They struggled in determining which terminology to use because of the absence of the [[Black-and-white dualism|heaven and hell dichotomy]] in the Filipino concept of the spirit world. Spanish missionaries and European authors usually equated heaven with ''maca'' and ''calualhatian''; and hell with ''casan'' (also ''casanaan'', ''casauaan'', or ''catanaan''; sometimes misread as ''kasamaan''). However, in the [[Boxer Codex]] ''maca'' and ''casan'' were synonyms for the Visayan and Tagalog [[underworld]]s. The 1754 version of ''[[Vocabulario de la Lengua Tagala]]'' used ''casanaan'' for both heaven and hell; with ''casanaan nang hirap'' as hell, and ''casanaan nang tova'' as heaven. ''Calualhatian'' (modern spelling: ''kaluwalhatian'') was simply a region in the Tagalog spirit world that souls can enter by crossing a torrential river on a narrow plank. (Rath, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; rather, the spirit world is usually depicted as an [[otherworld]] that exists alongside the material world. Souls reunite with deceased relatives in the spirit world and lead normal lives in the spirit world as they did in the material world. In some cases, the souls of evil people undergo penance and cleansing before they are granted entrance into a particular spirit realm. Souls would eventually [[Reincarnation|reincarnate]] after a period of time in the spirit world.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="under"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aswangproject.com/how-to-travel-the-underworld-of-philippine-mythology/|title=How to Travel the Underworld of Philippine Mythology|publisher=The Aswang Project|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hislop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rath"&gt;{{cite book|author=Imke Rath|editor =Astrid Windus &amp; Eberhard Crailsheim|title =Image - Object - Performance: Mediality and Communication in Cultural Contact Zones of Colonial Latin America and the Philippines|chapter =Depicting Netherworlds, or the Treatment of the Afterlife in a Colonial Contact Zone: The Paete Case|publisher =Waxmann Verlag|series =|year =2013|isbn =9783830979296|url = https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=qWVfAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Souls in the spirit world still retain a degree of influence in the material world, and vice versa. ''Pag-anito'' may be used to invoke good ancestor spirits for protection, intercession (''kalara'' or ''kalda''), or advice. Ancestor spirits that become intercessors with deities are known as ''pintakasi'' or ''pitulon''.

The ''diwata'' are spirits who have never been human. These spirits can range from simple spirits like the ''diwata'' of a particular rock or place,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;e.g. ''[[Nuno sa punso]]'', a dwarf-like ''anito'' that lives in anthills; and [[Maria Makiling|Dayang Masalanta]], the Tagalog ''diwata'' of [[Mount Makiling]]&lt;/ref&gt; to deities who [[Anthropomorphism|personify]] abstract concepts and natural phenomena,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;e.g. [[Mayari]], the Tagalog goddess of the moon; and [[Makapatag]], the Visayan god of vengeance&lt;/ref&gt;  to deities who are part of an actual [[Pantheon (religion)|pantheon]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;e.g. [[Bathala]], the chief deity of the Tagalogs; [[Magbabaya]], the supreme creator of the [[Lumad]] people; and [[Pilandok]], [[trickster spirit]] of the [[Maranao people|Maranao]]&lt;/ref&gt; They are also known as ''dewatu'', ''divata'', ''duwata'', ''ruwata'', ''dewa'', ''dwata'', ''diya'', etc., in various Philippine languages; all of which are derived from [[Religious syncretism|syncretization]] with [[Sanskrit]] ''[[devata]]'' or ''[[wiktionary:deva#Etymology|devá]]'', meaning "deity". In some ethnic groups like the [[B'laan people|B'laan]] and the [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]]s, ''Diwata'' refers to the [[God|supreme being]] in their pantheon,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Tagalogs differentiated between Diwata, the universal supreme being, and [[Bathala]], the supreme deity exclusive to them (Hislop, 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; in which case all the other spirits, whether human or not, are known generically as ''anito''.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hislop"/&gt; Like in ancestor spirits, ''diwata'' are referred to in polite [[Kinship terminology|kinship titles]] when addressed directly, like ''apo'' ("elder") or ''nuno'' ("grandparent").&lt;ref name="hislop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kroeber"/&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The most widespread names for these spirits in various Philippine ethnic groups are ''diwata'' or ''anito''. Other names of ''diwata'' or specific types of ''diwata'' include ''fieu awas'', ''kahoynon'' ([[B'laan people|B'laan]]); ''mahomanay'', ''tahamaling'' (Bagobo); ''panya'en'' ([[Batak people (Philippines)|Batak]]); ''tawong lipod'', ''magindara'' ([[Bikol people|Bikol]]); ''magtitima'', ''tawo sa talonan'' ([[Bukidnon people|Bukidnon]]); ''aled'' ([[Gaddang people|Gaddang]]); ''annani'' ([[Ibanag people|Ibanag]]); ''bakayauwan'', ''monduntug'', ''palasekan'', ''pili'', ''pinading'' ([[Ifugao people|Ifugao]]); ''mangmangkit'', ''katataoan''/''katawtaw-an'', ''kibaan'', ''litao'' ([[Ilocano people|Ilocano]]); ''apdel'', ''sasailo'' ([[Itneg people|Itneg]]); ''tumungaw'' ([[Kankana-ey people|Kankana-ey]]); ''laman labuad'', ''manglilili'' ([[Kapampangan people|Kapampangan]]); ''kama-kama''/''kamakaon'' ([[Karay-a people|Karay-a]]); ''tuglinsau'', ''tagbusau'', ''mandangum'' ([[Mandaya people|Mandaya]]); ''andagaw'' ([[Mangyan people|Mangyan]]); ''tawagenen'', ''manaog'' ([[Manobo people|Manobo]]); ''karibang'' ([[Maranao people|Maranao]]); ''kaybaan'' ([[Pangasinan people|Pangasinan]]); ''kamanan-daplak'' ([[Sambal people|Sambal]]); ''dayamdam'', ''piritay'' ([[Tagalog people|Tagalog]]); ''tawo sa talonan'' ([[Tagbanwa people|Tagbanwa]]); ''lewenri'', ''bawa'', ''katao''/''kataw'', ''tumawo''/''tamawo'', ''tawong lupa'' (Visayan); and ''guban-on'', ''digkusanon'', ''dalaketnon'' ([[Waray people|Waray]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three general types of non-human spirits. The first are the environmental or nature spirits "bound" to a particular location or natural phenomenon (similar to [[genii loci]]). They "own" places and concepts like agricultural fields, forests, cliffs, seas, winds, lightning, or realms in the spirit world. Some were also "keepers" or [[totem]]s of various animals and plants. They have inhuman and abstract qualities, reflecting their particular dominions. They do not normally appear in human form and are usually gender-less or androgynous. They rarely concern themselves with human affairs. Rituals involving these spirits are almost always conducted outdoors.&lt;ref name="buen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="novellino"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dario Novellino|editor =David G. Anderson &amp; Eeva Berglund|title =   Ethnographies of Conservation: Environmentalism and the Distribution of Privilege|chapter =Contrasting Landscapes, Conflicting Ontologies: Assessing Environmental Conservation on Palawan Island (The Philippines)|publisher =Berghahn Books|year =2003|pages=171&amp;ndash;188|isbn =9780857456748|url =https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=R1WwBWFEljQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second type of spirits are the "unbound" spirits which have independent existence. They appear in animal (usually as birds) or human-like forms, have gender differentiation, and have personal names. They are most similar to the [[fairies]] of European folklore.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;With strong parallels to human-like beings like [[Elf|elves]] and ''[[aos sí]]'', as well as diminutive human-like beings like [[Brownie (folklore)|brownies]] and [[pixie]]s. (Buenconsejo, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; These are the most common types of spirits to become ''abyan'' ([[spirit guide]]s of ''[[babaylan]]''), as they are the most "sociable" and can take interest in human activities. These spirits are usually referred to as ''engkanto'' (from Spanish ''encanto'') in modern Filipino folklore. Unlike the "bound" spirits, these spirits can be invited into human households, and their rituals can take place both outdoors and indoors.&lt;ref name="buen"/&gt;
[[File:Ato the Fertility God of the Bontoc Tribe.jpg|left|thumb|Ato, a fertility god of the [[Bontoc people]]]]
The last is a class of malevolent spirits or demons, as well as supernatural beings, generally collectively known as ''aswang'', ''yawa'', or ''mangalos'' (also ''mangalok'', ''mangangalek'', or ''magalos'') among Tagalogs and Visayans. There are numerous kinds of ''aswang'' with specific abilities, behavior, or appearance. Examples include ''[[sigbin]]'', ''[[wakwak]]'', ''[[tiyanak]]'', and ''[[manananggal]]''. The first two categories of ''diwata'' can also be malevolent, what sets the third category apart is that they can not be appealed to with offerings and they are utterly pitiless. Most practices associated with them is to ward them off, banish them, or destroy them. They are never addressed nor worshiped in religious rituals.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hislop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="buen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kroeber"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rodell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ap"/&gt;

''Diwata'' are rarely spoken about openly for fear of attracting their attention. Instead they are referred to with [[euphemism]]s like "those unlike us" (Visayan: ''dili ingon nato'', Tagalog: ''hindi kagaya natin'') or various names, like ''banwaanon'' or ''taga-banwa'',&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Not to be confused with the [[Tagbanwa people|Tagbanwa]] and [[Mamanwa peope|Mamanwa]] ethnic groups, all derived from [[Proto-Austronesian language|PAN]] ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Austronesian/banua|*banua]]'', "home" or "homeland". In modern Filipino languages, ''banwa'' has been supplanted by Spanish ''[[wikt:lugar|lugar]]'', thus ''taglugar'' is used in place of ''tagabanwa'' (Hislop, 1971; Tan, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; that translate literally to "dweller of a place".&lt;ref name="bis"&gt;{{cite we|url=http://www.binisaya.com/cebuano/dili-ingon-nato|title=Dili-ingon-nato|publisher=Binisaya.com|accessdate=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gat"&gt;{{cite thesis |type=PhD |author=Augusto Jose B.

''Diwata'' exist in both the material world and the spirit world. They can be formless or have a material body. They can also take over a body through [[spirit possession]] (Visayan: ''hola'', ''hulak'', ''tagdug'', or ''saob''; Tagalog: ''sanib''), an ability essential for the [[séance]]s in ''pag-anito''. They are believed to be capable of [[shapeshifting]] (''baliw'' or ''baylo''), becoming invisible, or creating visions or illusions (''anino'' or ''landung'', lit. "shadow"). Their powers, however, are limited to their particular domain. A ''diwata'' of a forest, for instance, has no dominion over the sea. Most are generally benevolent or capriciously neutral, although they can cause misfortunes and illnesses if angered, disrespected, or mistakenly encountered.&lt;ref name="hislop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kroeber"&gt;{{cite journal|author=A.

They are also said to be annoyed by perfume, as well as salt and spices. (Buenconsejo, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Diwata'' who take human form are said to be pale-skinned and could be distinguished from humans by the absence of a [[philtrum]] on the upper lip.&lt;ref name="mccoy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="buen"/&gt;

''Diwata'' are often depicted as appearing to unsuspecting people in human or animal form, sometimes causing unintentional harm. They can also deliberately play tricks on mortals, like seducing or abducting beautiful men and women into the spirit world.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="buen"/&gt; Certain places are believed to be owned by ''diwata'' or are borders to the spirit world.

To avoid inadvertently angering a ''diwata'', Filipinos perform a customary ''pasintabi sa nuno'' ("respectfully apologizing or asking permission from ancestors for passing").&lt;ref group="note"&gt;From ''sintabi'', "to respectfully ask permission" or "to give due respect", cf. "[[wikt:excuse me|excuse me]]"&lt;/ref&gt; This is done by saying the phrases "''tao po''" ("a human [is passing], elder), "''tabi po''" or "''tabi apo''" ("by your permission, elder")&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]], the traditional phrase is "''bari bari, apo''", with the same meaning (Tan, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; when passing by a place believed to  be inhabited by a ''diwata''.&lt;ref name="potet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tan"/&gt;

''Diwata'' are also believed to be able to mate with humans. People born with [[congenital disorder]]s (like [[albinism]] or [[syndactyly]]) or display unusual beauty or behavior are commonly believed by local superstition to be the children of ''diwata'' who seduced (or sometimes raped) their mothers.&lt;ref name="albino"&gt;{{cite news |title=Magkakapatid na albino, anak ng engkanto? |url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/life/06/19/17/magkakapatid-na-albino-anak-ng-engkanto |accessdate=23 November 2018 |work=Patrol.ph |agency=ABS-CBN News |date=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rapalbino"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Santisteban |first1=Bong |title=What it's like to live with albinism |url=https://www.rappler.com/rappler-blogs/204807-living-with-albinism-story |accessdate=23 November 2018 |work=Rappler |date=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancestor spirits were usually represented by carved figures. These were known as ''taotao'' ("little human", also ''taotaohan'', ''latawo'', ''tinatao'', or  ''tatao''),&lt;ref group="note"&gt;From Proto-Malayo-Polynesian ''*tau'', ultimately from [[Proto-Austronesian]] ''*Cau'', "human" or "person"&lt;/ref&gt; ''bata-bata'' ("little child"), ''ladaw'' ("image" or "likeness"; also ''laraw'', ''ladawang'', ''lagdong'', or ''larawan''), or ''likha'' ("creation"; also ''likhak'') in most of the Philippines. Other names include ''[[bulul]]'' (also ''bulol'' or ''bul-ul'') or ''tinagtaggu'' (also ''tinattaggu'') among the [[Igorot people|Igorot]];&lt;ref group="note"&gt;''Tinagtaggu'' is the direct equivalent of ''taotao'' in the [[Tuwali language]]; from ''tagu'', "human"&lt;/ref&gt; ''manaug'' among the [[Lumad]]; and ''tagno'' among [[Bicolano people|Bicolanos]].&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hislop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="potet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kroeber"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zaide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blumetritt"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ferdinand Blumentritt |editor =|title =Wiener Zeitschrift für die Kunde des Morgenlandes|chapter =Alphabetisches Verzeichnis der bei den philippinischen Eingeborenen üblichen Eigennamen, welche auf Religion, Opfer und priesterliche Titel und Amtsverrichtungen sich beziehen.

Conversely, the alternate term ''[[dambana]]'' has come to mean "shrine" or "chapel" in modern Tagalog&lt;/ref&gt; after the location in which they are usually kept.&lt;ref name="potet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blumetritt"/&gt;
[[File:Anitos of the Igorotes (c. 1900, Philippines).jpg|thumb|left|[[Igorot people|Igorot]] ''hipag'' depicting war deities (c.&amp;nbsp;1900)]]
''Taotao'' were usually austere roughly-carved figures made from wood, stone, or ivory. Some ''taoatao'' encountered by the Spanish were made from precious metals or ornamented with gold and jewelry, but these were very rare.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="agon"&gt;{{cite book|author=Teodoro A. Agoncillo|title =Introduction to Filipino History|publisher =Radiant Star Pub.|year =1974|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Taotao'' were almost always depicted in the squatting position with the arms crossed over the knees, which is reminiscent of the [[fetal position]], the everyday conversing posture, and the position bodies are arranged during death among Ancient Filipinos. Some figures, however, are depicted standing or doing everyday activities like dancing, pounding rice, or nursing infants.&lt;ref name="roxas-lim"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Aurora Roxas-Lim|year=1973|title=Art in Ifugao Society|journal=Asian Studies|volume=11|issue=2|pages=47&amp;ndash;74|url=http://www.asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-11-02-1973/roxas-limart%20ifugao%20society.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cm"/&gt;

Most ''taotao'' represent an actual deceased person, usually carved by the community upon their funeral. As such, there can be hundreds of ''taotao'' in a single village, some of them centuries old.&lt;ref name="cm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="storch"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gregorio F.

In very rare cases, ''diwata'' can be depicted as ''taotao'' in [[anthropomorphic]] form, as [[Chimera (mythology)|chimera]]s or legendary creatures, or as animals.&lt;ref name="potet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cm"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cordilleranmuseum.weebly.com/gallery-of-exhibits.html|title=Gallery of Exhibits|publisher=Museum of Cordilleran Sculpture|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include a special class of figures called ''hipag'' among the Igorot which depict war deities, as well as ''kinabigat'' (carved houseposts) and ''hogang'' (carved [[tree fern]] posts used as boundary markers and as wards against harm).&lt;ref name="cm"/&gt; As a rule, however, ''diwata'' are not usually depicted as ''taotao'' or by any man-made representations.&lt;ref name="hislop"/&gt;

''Taotao'' were not intrinsically sacred. They were representations of the spirits, not the actual spirits themselves. They only became sacred during their use in a ''pag-anito'' ritual. Without the spirit they represent, they are treated as mundane carved pieces of wood or sculpted stone. The anonymous author of the 1572 ''Relación de la conquista de la isla de Luzón'' describes ''pag-anito'' rituals of the Tagalog people as such:&lt;ref name="B&amp;R3Anonymous1572"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Relation of the Conquest of the Island of Luzon|work=The Philippine Islands, 1493-1898|publisher=Arthur H. Clark Company|year=1903|isbn=|editor-last=Blair|editor-first=Emma Helen|editor-link=Emma Helen Blair|volume=3|location=Ohio, Cleveland|pages=145|editor-last2=Robertson|editor-first2=James Alexander|editor-link2=James Alexander Robertson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"When any [[datu|chief]] is ill, he invites his kindred and orders a great meal to be prepared, consisting of fish, meat, and wine. When the guests are all assembled and the feast set forth in a few plates on the ground inside the house, they seat themselves also on the ground to eat. In the midst of the feast (called [[babaylan|manganito or baylán]] in their tongue), they put the idol called [[Bathala|Batala]] and certain aged women who are considered as priestesses, and some aged Indians—neither more nor less. They offer the idol some of the food which they are eating, and call upon him in their tongue, praying to him for the health of the sick man for whom the feast is held. The natives of these islands have no altars nor temples whatsoever. This manganito, or drunken revel, to give it a better name, usually lasts seven or eight days; and when it is finished they take the idols and put them in the corners of the house, and keep them there without showing them any reverence."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regardless, very old ''taotao'' handed down through generations are prized as family heirlooms. Among the Igorot, pieces of ''taotao'' may also be chipped off and boiled into a medicinal tea.&lt;ref name="cm"/&gt;

''Taotao'' were commonly kept in corners or small shelves inside houses or granaries. Spanish missionaries recorded that ''taotao'' were present in every Filipino household, no matter how poor.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hislop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zaide"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gregorio F. Zaide|title =Philippine Political and Cultural History|volume= Volume 1|publisher =Philippine Education Company|series =Philippine Political and Cultural History|year =1975|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="blumetritt"/&gt;

When Spanish missionaries arrived in the Philippines, the word "''anito''" came to be associated with these physical representations of spirits that featured prominently in ''pag-anito'' rituals. During the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American rule of the Philippines (1898–1946)]], the meaning of the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''idolo'' ("a thing worshiped") was further conflated with the English word "[[Cult image|idol]]". Thus in the [[Filipino language|modern Filipino language]], ''anito'' has come to refer almost exclusively to the carved ''taotao'' figures, instead of the actual spirits themselves.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sawyer"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederic H. Sawyer|title =The Inhabitants of the Philippines|publisher =Charles Scribner's Sons|year =1900|url =https://archive.org/details/inhabitantsofphi00sawy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Altars and sacred areas===
[[File:Enchanted Balete Tree in Lazi.JPG|thumb|''[[Diwata]]'' are believed to inhabit this 400-year old [[balete tree|''balete'' tree]] in [[Lazi, Siquijor]] with a [[natural spring]] between its roots]]
Ancient Filipinos did not have temples or permanent buildings of worship.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hislop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blumetritt"/&gt; However, they did have semi-permanent [[spirit house]]s. They can range in size from small roofed platforms to structures similar to a small house (but with no walls). These were known as ''magdantang'' in Visayan and ''ulango'' or ''simbahan'' in Tagalog.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Among the [[Itneg people|Itneg]], spirit houses are known ''tangpap'', ''pangkew'', or ''alalot'' (for various small roofed altars); and ''balaua'' or ''kalangan'' (for larger structures). In [[Mindanao]], spirit houses are known among the [[Subanen people|Subanen]] as ''maligai'' ; among the [[Teduray people|Teduray]] as ''tenin''  (only entered by shamans); and among the [[Bagobo people|Bagobo]] as ''buis'' (for those built near roads and villages) and ''parabunnian'' (for those built near rice fields).(Kroeber, 1918)&lt;/ref&gt; They can also be used as places to store ''taotao''. Among Bicolanos, ''taotao'' were also kept inside sacred caves called ''moog''.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kroeber"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cole"/&gt;&lt;ref name="storch"/&gt;

During certain ceremonies, ''anito'' are venerated through temporary altars near sacred places. These were called ''latangan'' in Visayan and ''[[dambana]]'' or ''lambana'' in Tagalog.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Also ''saloko'' or ''palaan'' ([[Itneg people|Itneg]]); ''sakolong'' ([[Bontoc people|Bontoc]]); ''salagnat'' (Bicolano); ''sirayangsang'' ([[Tagbanwa people|Tagbanwa]]);  ''ranga'' (Teduray); and ''tambara'', ''tigyama'', or ''balekat'' ([[Bagobo people|Bagobo]])&lt;/ref&gt; These bamboo or [[rattan]] altars are identical in basic construction throughout most of the Philippines. They were either small roof-less platforms or standing poles split at the tip (similar to a [[tiki torch]]). They held halved coconut shells, metal plates, or [[Tapayan#Martaban|''martaban'' jars]] as receptacles for offerings. ''Taotao'' may sometimes also be placed on these platforms.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kroeber"/&gt;

Other types of sacred places or objects of worship of ''diwata'' include the material manifestation of their realms. The most widely venerated were [[balete tree|''balete'' trees]] (also called ''nonok'', ''nunuk'', ''nonoc'', etc.) and [[anthill]]s or [[termite mound]]s (''punso''). Other examples include mountains, waterfalls, tree groves, reefs, and caves.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hislop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="potet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="agon2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="demetrio73"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Francisco R. Demetrio|year=1973|title=Philippine Shamanism and Southeast Asian Parallels|journal=Asian Studies|volume=11|issue=2|pages=128&amp;ndash;154|url=http://www.asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-11-02-1973/demetrio-philippine%20shamanism%20southeast%20asian%20parallels%20.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spirit animals===
Some animals like [[crocodile]]s, snakes, [[monitor lizard]]s, [[tokay gecko]]s, and various birds were also venerated as servants or manifestations of ''diwata'', or as powerful spirits themselves. These include legendary creatures like the dragon or serpent [[Bakunawa]], the giant bird [[Minokawa]] of the Bagobo, and the colorful [[Sarimanok]] of the Maranao.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hislop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="potet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="agon2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Teodoro A. Agoncillo &amp; Oscar M. Alfonso|title =History of the Filipino People|publisher =Malaya Books|series =|year =1969|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mccoy"/&gt;

[[Omen]] birds were particularly important. The most common omen birds were doves with green or blue iridescent feathers called ''limokon'' (usually the [[common emerald dove]], [[imperial pigeon]]s, or [[brown dove]]s).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;''Limokon'' in most of Visayas and among the [[Lumad]]; also ''alimúkun'' ([[Cebuano people|Cebuano]]), ''alimúkeng'' (Ilocano); ''limoken'' (Maranao); ''lemuguen'' ([[Teduray people|Teduray]]); and ''limukun'' ([[Subanen people|Subanen]])&lt;/ref&gt; Other omen birds include [[fairy-bluebird]]s (''[[tigmamanukan]]'', ''balan tikis'', ''balatiti'', or ''bathala'' among Tagalogs; and ''batala'' among [[Kapampangan people|Kapampangan]]s); [[kingfisher]]s (''salaksak'' among the Ilocano, Igorot, and [[Sambal people|Sambal]]); and [[flowerpecker]]s (''pitpit'', ''ichaw'', ''ido'', or ''labeg'' among the Igorot).&lt;ref name="potet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kroeber"/&gt;&lt;ref name="forth"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gregory Forth|editor =Sonia Tidemann &amp; Andrew Gosler|title =Ethno-ornithology: Birds, Indigenous Peoples, Culture and Society|chapter =What's in a Bird's Name: Relationships among Ethno-ornithological Terms in Nage and Other Malayo-Polynesian Languages|publisher =Earthscan|year =2012|isbn =9781849774758|url =https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=8u2nUWLYx18C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rituals and shamans==
{{Main|Babaylan|Catalonan}}
[[File:A Tinguian making an offering to the guardian stones. Wellcome M0005692.jpg|thumb|A 1922 photograph of an [[Itneg people|Itneg]] shaman making an offering to an ''apdel'', a guardian ''anito'' of her village. ''Apdel'' are believed to reside in the water-worn stones known as ''pinaing''.&lt;ref name="cole"/&gt;]]
Anitism was not a religion about worship. Aside from good ancestor spirits and the few benevolent ''diwata'', most ''anito'' were feared, not venerated. To an ordinary person, ''diwata'' were regarded as dangerous beings to be avoided or appeased. When interaction was necessary, they performed a ritual known as ''pag-anito'' (also ''mag-anito'' or ''anitohan''). These are usually directed at ancestor spirits. When the ''pag-anito'' ceremony is for a ''diwata'', the ritual is known as ''pagdiwata'' (also ''magdiwata'' or ''diwatahan'').&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hislop"/&gt;

Minor ''pag-anito'' rituals like praying for better weather or banishing minor ill luck can be performed by any householder. However, major ''pag-anito'' rituals required the services of the community [[shaman]] (Visayan ''babaylan'' or ''baylan''; Tagalog ''katalonan'' or ''manganito'').&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Other terms include ''balyana'', ''paraanito'', or ''paradiwata'' (Bicolano); ''balian'', ''balyan'', or ''mabalian'' ([[Lumad]]); ''balian'' or ''tanguilin'' (Subanen); ''bawalyan'' or ''babaylan'' ([[Tagbanwa people|Tagbanwa]]); ''beljan'' ([[Palawan people|Palaw'an]]); ''baglan'', ''mangoodan'', or ''manilao'' (Ilocano);''bahasa'' ([[Yakan people|Yakan]]); ''[[dukun]]'', ''kalamat'', or ''papagan'' (Sama-Bajau); ''mandadawak'', ''dawak'', ''insupak'', ''mon-lapu'', ''tumunoh'', ''alpogan'', or ''mumbaki'' ([[Igorot people|Igorot]]); ''anitu'' ([[Aeta people|Aeta]]); and ''ma-aram'' ([[Karay-a people|Karay-a]])&lt;/ref&gt;

These shamans were believed to have been "chosen" by a specific ''diwata'' who become their [[spirit guide]]s.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Terms for [[spirit guide]]s of shamans include ''bantay'', ''abyan'' (Visayan); ''alagad'', ''gabay'' (Tagalog); ''abyan'', ''umli'', ''sugujen'', or ''inajew'' (Lumad); ''saro'' (Bicolano); and ''jinn'' (Sama-Bajau)&lt;/ref&gt; This was presumed to happen after they pass the initiation rites of an older shaman they were apprenticed to (usually a relative). In some cases, some shamans acquire their status after they recover from a serious illness or a bout of insanity.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cannell"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fenella Cannell|title =Power and Intimacy in the Christian Philippines|publisher =Cambridge University Press|series =Cambridge Studies in Social and Cultural Anthropology, Volume 109|year =1999|isbn =9780521646222|url =https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=ngmnrkfySdUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="buen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oceans"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sh"/&gt; In most Filipino ethnic groups, shamans were almost always female. The few males who gain shaman status were usually ''asog'' or ''bayok'',&lt;ref group="note"&gt;''Asog'' is the term used for transvestite male shamans in most of the Visayas and in the [[Bicol Region]]. In the rest of Luzon, they are known as ''bayok'' (''bayoc''), ''bayog'', or ''bayogin'' (''bayoguin'' or ''bayoquin''). Notably among the [[Sambal people|Sambal]], the highest-ranking shaman was a ''bayok''. They are also known as ''labia'' among the [[Subanen people|Subanen]], though they were not necessarily shamans (Kroeber, 1918). There are also similar male shamans who behave as women among the [[Dayak people]] of Borneo (Baldick, 2013). Also see ''[[Bakla]]''&lt;/ref&gt; men who dressed as women and lived as women (even marrying men).&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kroeber"/&gt;&lt;ref name="buen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sh"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aswangproject.com/filipino-shaman/|title=6 Guidelines for Becoming a Filipino Shaman|publisher=The Aswang Project|accessdate=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Itneg people launching spirit rafts bearing offerings for anito on a river (1922, Philippines).jpg|thumb|left|Itneg people launching spirit boats (''taltalabong'') bearing offerings for ''anito'' (1922)]]
Major ''pag-anito'' rituals are centered around a [[séance]]. Because of their special relationship with their companion spirits, shamans can act as [[mediumship|medium]]s for other ''anito'', allowing spirits to temporarily possess their bodies. This possession happens after the shaman goes into a trance-like state. This allows the spirit to communicate verbally with the participants as well as physically act out events in the spirit world. At the moment of possession, shamans display a change in behavior and voice. They can sometimes go into seizures and become violent enough that restraints are required. The ritual ends when the spirit leaves and the shaman is awakened.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;

Spirits were invited into the ritual through offerings and sacrifices during and after the ceremonies. These depended on what spirit was being summoned, but offerings are usually a small portion of the harvests, cooked food, wine, gold ornaments, and [[Paan|betel nut]]. Blood from an animal was also usually part of the offerings, poured directly on the ''taotao'' or in a bowl before them. These commonly come from chickens or pigs, but can also be from [[carabao]]s or dogs.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hislop"/&gt; Salt and spices are usually avoided, as they are believed to be distasteful to ''anito''.&lt;ref name="buen"/&gt; There is no record of [[human sacrifice]]s being offered to ''anito'' during the Spanish period of the Philippines,&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zaide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mccoy"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alfred W.

In the funeral rites for celebrated warriors or nobles among Visayans and Tagalogs, favorite [[alipin|slaves]] may also sometimes be executed and buried (''hogot'') to accompany the deceased into the spirit world (Scott, 1994; Benedict, 1916)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common ''pag-anito'' ritual throughout most of the Philippine ethnic groups involves the use of spirit boats. These were usually miniature boats laden with offerings set adrift from riverbanks and shorelines.&lt;ref name="hislop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="apostol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cole"/&gt;
[[File:Babaylan Festival in Bago City.jpg|thumb|A performer depicting a [[babaylan|shaman]] in the 2015 [[Babaylan Festival]] of [[Bago, Negros Occidental]]]]
''Pag-anito'' can be conducted on its own or in conjunction with other rituals and celebrations. They can be personal or family rituals or seasonal community events. They can vary considerably between different ethnic groups. The most common ''pag-anito'' were entreaties for bountiful harvests, cures for illnesses, victory in battle, prayers for the dead, or blessings.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kroeber"/&gt;

Different ethnic groups had different ''diwata'' pantheons and rituals associated with them, though sometimes deities are shared in neighboring ethnic groups. Moreover, different communities also each have their own local patron ''diwata.''&lt;ref name="hislop"/&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In modern Christianized Filipinos, this practice was transferred unto community patron saints and [[Religious images in Christian theology|religious icons]], which are often celebrated and worshiped in a very similar way (Hislop, 1971), cf. [[Ati-Atihan]], [[Obando Fertility Rites]]&lt;/ref&gt;

  Please note:
    The consensus since April 2007 has been to include all three of the definitions of atheism presented in the first paragraph below. They are the result of extensive debate and searches through existing sources – see, for example, the archived talkpage threads [[Talk:Atheism/Archive 27#A survey of definitions for atheism]] and [[Talk:Atheism/Archive 29#List of definitions]] – and formed part of the article when it achieved "Featured Article" status.

    Please, therefore, do not change the contents of the first paragraph without prior discussion on the talk page ([[Talk:Atheism]]), preferably after consulting at least these two threads. If you do make changes to the paragraph without prior discussion, be prepared to see them reverted as an invitation to discussion on the talk page (see [[Wikipedia:BRD]]).

'''Atheism''' is, in the broadest sense, the absence of [[belief]] in the existence of [[Deity|deities]].&lt;ref name="encyc-unbelief-def-issues" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oxdicphil" /&gt;&lt;ref name="religioustolerance" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/atheism |encyclopedia=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]] |title=Atheism |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |accessdate=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less broadly, atheism is the rejection of belief that any deities exist.&lt;ref name="eb2011-atheism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="encyc-philosophy" /&gt;  In an even narrower sense, atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities.&lt;ref name="encyc-unbelief-def-issues" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oxdicphil" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RoweRoutledge" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atheism-agnosticism/#1

The etymological root for the word ''atheism'' originated before the 5th century BCE from the ancient Greek {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:ἄθεος|ἄθεος]]}} (''atheos''), meaning "without god(s)". In antiquity it had multiple uses as a pejorative term applied to those thought to reject the gods worshiped by the larger society,&lt;ref name="drachmann" /&gt; those who were forsaken by the gods or those who had no commitment to belief in the gods.&lt;ref name="Battling Whitmarsh" /&gt; The term denoted a social category created by orthodox religionists into which those who did not share their religious beliefs were placed.&lt;ref name="Battling Whitmarsh"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whitmarsh|first1=Tim|title=Battling the Gods: Atheism in the Ancient World|publisher=Knopf Doubleday|isbn=978-0-307-94877-9 |chapter=8.

Arguments for atheism range from the philosophical to social and historical approaches. Rationales for not believing in deities include arguments that there is a lack of [[Existence of God#Empirical arguments|empirical evidence]],&lt;ref name="logical" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://shook.pragmatism.org/skepticismaboutthesupernatural.pdf |title=Skepticism about the Supernatural |last=Shook |first=John R. |accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[problem of evil]], the [[argument from inconsistent revelations]], the rejection of concepts that cannot [[Falsifiability|be falsified]], and the [[argument from nonbelief]].&lt;ref name="logical" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Drange-1996" /&gt; Nonbelievers contend that atheism is a more [[parsimonious]] position than theism and that everyone is born without beliefs in deities;&lt;ref name="encyc-unbelief-def-issues" /&gt; therefore, they argue that the [[Philosophic burden of proof|burden of proof]] lies not on the atheist to disprove the existence of gods but on the theist to provide a rationale for theism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stenger|2007|pp=17–18}}, citing {{cite book |last=Parsons |first=Keith M. |title=God and the Burden of Proof: Plantinga, Swinburne, and the Analytical Defense of Theism |year=1989 |location=Amherst, New York |publisher=Prometheus Books |isbn=978-0-879-75551-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some atheists have adopted [[Secularism|secular]] philosophies (e.g. [[secular humanism]]),&lt;ref name="honderich" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fales |first=Evan |title=Naturalism and Physicalism |postscript=,}} in {{harvnb|Martin|2006|pp=122–131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; there is no one ideology or set of behaviors to which all atheists adhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|pp=3–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions and types ==
[[File:AtheismImplicitExplicit3.svg|thumb|A diagram showing the relationship between the definitions of [[Weak and strong atheism|weak/strong]] and [[Implicit and explicit atheism|implicit/explicit]] atheism.
&lt;br /&gt;
Explicit strong/positive/hard atheists (in {{Font color|purple|'''purple'''}} on the '''right''') assert that ''"at least one deity exists"'' is a false statement.
&lt;br /&gt;
Explicit weak/negative/soft atheists (in {{Font color|blue|'''blue'''}} on the '''right''') reject or eschew belief that any deities exist without actually asserting that ''"at least one deity exists"'' is a false statement.
&lt;br /&gt;
Implicit weak/negative atheists (in {{Font color|blue|'''blue'''}} on the '''left'''), according to authors such as George H. Smith, would include people (such as young children and some agnostics) who do not believe in a deity but have not explicitly rejected such belief.
&lt;br /&gt;
(Sizes in the diagram are not meant to indicate relative sizes within a population.)]]

Writers disagree on how best to define and classify ''atheism'',&lt;ref name="eb1911-atheism" /&gt; contesting what supernatural entities are considered gods, whether it is a philosophic position in its own right or merely the absence of one, and whether it requires a conscious, explicit rejection. Atheism has been regarded as compatible with [[agnosticism]],&lt;ref name="agnosticism-compatible" /&gt;&lt;ref name="flint-agnostic-atheism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="encyc-unbelief-compatible" /&gt;&lt;ref name="martin-agnosticism-entails" /&gt;&lt;ref name="barker-agnostic-atheism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="besant-open-to-new-truth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="holyoake-question-of-probability" /&gt; and has also been contrasted with it.&lt;ref name="eb2011-atheism-critique" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eb2011concise-atheism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eb1911-atheism-sceptical" /&gt; A variety of categories have been used to distinguish the different forms of atheism.

=== Range ===
Some of the ambiguity and controversy involved in defining ''atheism'' arises from difficulty in reaching a consensus for the definitions of words like ''deity'' and ''god''. The plurality of wildly different [[conceptions of God]] and deities leads to differing ideas regarding atheism's applicability. The ancient Romans accused Christians of being atheists for not worshiping the [[paganism|pagan]] deities. Gradually, this view fell into disfavor as ''theism'' came to be understood as encompassing belief in any divinity.{{sfn|Martin|2006}}

With respect to the range of phenomena being rejected, atheism may counter anything from the existence of a deity, to the existence of any [[spirituality|spiritual]], [[supernatural]], or [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] concepts, such as those of [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Taoism]].&lt;ref name="eb2011-Rejection-of-all-religious-beliefs" /&gt;

=== Implicit vs. explicit ===
{{Main|Implicit and explicit atheism}}
Definitions of atheism also vary in the degree of consideration a person must put to the idea of gods to be considered an atheist. Atheism has sometimes been defined to include the simple absence of belief that any deities exist. This broad definition would include newborns and other people who have not been exposed to theistic ideas. As far back as 1772, [[Baron d'Holbach]] said that "All children are born Atheists; they have no idea of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=d'Holbach |first=P. H. T. |authorlink=Baron d'Holbach |title=Good Sense |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7319 |year=1772 |accessdate=2011-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, [[George H. Smith]] (1979) suggested that: "The man who is unacquainted with theism is an atheist because he does not believe in a god. This category would also include the child with the conceptual capacity to grasp the issues involved, but who is still unaware of those issues. The fact that this child does not believe in god qualifies him as an atheist."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1979|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Implicit atheism'' is "the absence of theistic belief without a conscious rejection of it" and ''explicit atheism'' is the conscious rejection of belief.
For the purposes of his paper on "philosophical atheism", [[Ernest Nagel]] contested including mere absence of theistic belief as a type of atheism.&lt;ref name= Nagel1959&gt;{{cite book
|title= Basic Beliefs: The Religious Philosophies of Mankind |chapter=Philosophical Concepts of Atheism
|first=Ernest |last=Nagel |authorlink=Ernest Nagel

|quote=I must begin by stating what sense I am attaching to the word "atheism," and how I am construing the theme of this paper. I shall understand by "atheism" a critique and a denial of the major claims of all varieties of theism. &amp;nbsp;... atheism is not to be identified with sheer unbelief, or with disbelief in some particular creed of a religious group. Thus, a child who has received no religious instruction and has never heard about God, is not an atheist – for he is not denying any theistic claims. Similarly in the case of an adult who, if he has withdrawn from the faith of his father without reflection or because of frank indifference to any theological issue, is also not an atheist – for such an adult is not challenging theism and not professing any views on the subject. &amp;nbsp;... I propose to examine some ''philosophic'' concepts of atheism&amp;nbsp;...}}
&lt;br /&gt;reprinted in ''Critiques of God'', edited by Peter A. Angeles, Prometheus Books, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Graham Oppy]] classifies as ''innocents'' those who never considered the question because they lack any understanding of what a god is. According to Oppy, these could be [[Infant cognitive development|one-month-old babies]], humans with severe traumatic [[Brain injury|brain injuries]], or patients with [[dementia|advanced dementia]].{{sfn|Oppy|2018|p=4|ps=:Agnostics are distinguished from innocents, who also neither believe that there are gods nor believe that there are no gods, by the fact that they have given consideration to the question whether there are gods. Innocents are those who have never considered the question whether there are gods. Typically, innocents have never considered the question whether there are gods because they are not able to consider that question. How could that be? Well, in order to consider the question whether there are gods, one must understand what it would mean for something to be a god. That is, one needs to have the concept of a god. Those who lack the concept of a god are not able to entertain the thought that there are gods. Consider, for example, one-month-old babies. It is very plausible that one-month-old babies lack the concept of a god. So it is very plausible that one-month-old babies are innocents. Other plausible cases of innocents include chimpanzees, human beings who have suffered severe traumatic brain injuries, and human beings with advanced dementia}}

=== Positive vs. negative ===
{{Main|Negative and positive atheism}}
Philosophers such as [[Antony Flew]]&lt;ref name="presumption"&gt;{{harvnb|Flew|1976|pp=14ff}}: "In this interpretation an atheist becomes: not someone who positively asserts the non-existence of God; but someone who is simply not a theist. Let us, for future ready reference, introduce the labels 'positive atheist' for the former and 'negative atheist' for the latter."&lt;/ref&gt;
and [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]]{{sfn|Martin|2006}} have contrasted positive (strong/hard) atheism with negative (weak/soft) atheism. Positive atheism is the explicit affirmation that gods do not exist. Negative atheism includes all other forms of non-theism. According to this categorization, anyone who is not a theist is either a negative or a positive atheist.
The terms ''weak'' and ''strong'' are relatively recent, while the terms ''negative'' and ''positive'' atheism are of older origin, having been used (in slightly different ways) in the philosophical literature&lt;ref name="presumption" /&gt; and in Catholic apologetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/jm3303.htm |title=On the Meaning of Contemporary Atheism |journal=The Review of Politics |first=Jacques |last=Maritain |date=July 1949 |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=267–280 |doi=10.1017/S0034670500044168 |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051113062053/http://www.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/jm3303.htm |archivedate=13 November 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Under this demarcation of atheism, most agnostics qualify as negative atheists.

While Martin, for example, asserts that agnosticism [[logical consequence|entails]] negative atheism,&lt;ref name="martin-agnosticism-entails" /&gt; many agnostics see their view as distinct from atheism,&lt;ref name=Kenny2006 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/omar-baddar/why-im-not-an-atheist-the-case-for-agnosticism_b_3345544.html | title=Why I'm Not an Atheist: The Case for Agnosticism |date=28 May 2013 |publisher=Huffington Post |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
which they may consider no more justified than theism or requiring an equal conviction.&lt;ref name=Kenny2006&gt;{{cite book |first=Anthony |last=Kenny |authorlink=Anthony Kenny |title=What I believe |chapter=Why I Am Not an Atheist |publisher=Continuum |isbn=978-0-82648971-5 |quote=The true default position is neither theism nor atheism, but agnosticism&amp;nbsp;... a claim to knowledge needs to be substantiated; ignorance need only be confessed. |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The assertion of unattainability of knowledge for or against the existence of gods is sometimes seen as an indication that atheism requires a [[leap of faith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Many atheists I know would be certain of a high place in heaven |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2009/0725/1224251303564.html |last=O'Brien |first=Breda |authorlink=Breda O'Brien |work=Irish Times |accessdate=2011-04-09 |date=7 July 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520132651/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2009/0725/1224251303564.html |archivedate=20 May 2011  |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Warner |first=Matthew |url=http://www.ncregister.com/blog/matthew-warner/more-faith-to-be-an-atheist-than-a-christian |title=More faith to be an atheist than a Christian |date=8 June 2012 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Common atheist responses to this argument include that unproven ''[[faith#Faith in world religions|religious]]'' propositions deserve as much disbelief as all ''other'' unproven propositions,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|pp=30–34}}. "Who seriously claims we should say 'I neither believe nor disbelieve that the Pope is a robot', or 'As to whether or not eating this piece of chocolate will turn me into an elephant I am completely agnostic'. In the absence of any good reasons to believe these outlandish claims, we rightly disbelieve them, we don't just suspend judgement."&lt;/ref&gt;
and that the unprovability of a god's existence does not imply equal probability of either possibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|p=22}}. "A lack of proof is no grounds for the suspension of belief. This is because when we have a lack of absolute proof we can still have overwhelming evidence or one explanation which is far superior to the alternatives."&lt;/ref&gt;
Australian philosopher [[J. J. C. Smart]] even argues that "sometimes a person who is really an atheist may describe herself, even passionately, as an agnostic because of unreasonable generalized [[philosophical skepticism]] which would preclude us from saying that we know anything whatever, except perhaps the truths of mathematics and formal logic."&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atheism-agnosticism/ |title=Atheism and Agnosticism |first=J.C.C. |last=Smart |date=9 March 2004 |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Consequently, some atheist authors such as [[Richard Dawkins]] prefer distinguishing theist, agnostic and atheist positions along a [[spectrum of theistic probability]]—the likelihood that each assigns to the statement "God exists".{{sfn|Dawkins|2006|p=50}}

=== Definition as impossible or impermanent ===
Before the 18th century, the existence of God was so accepted in the western world that even the possibility of true atheism was questioned. This is called ''theistic [[innatism]]''—the notion that all people believe in God from birth; within this view was the connotation that atheists are simply in denial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cudworth |first=Ralph |authorlink=Ralph Cudworth |title=The True Intellectual System of the Universe: the first part, wherein all the reason and philosophy of atheism is confuted and its impossibility demonstrated |year=1678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a position claiming that atheists are quick to believe in God in times of crisis, that atheists make [[deathbed conversion]]s, or that "there are no [[atheists in foxholes]]".&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: {{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/features/ohair090896.htm |title=Atheist Group Moves Ahead Without O'Hair |first=Sue Anne |last=Pressley |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=8 September 1996 |accessdate=2014-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There have however been examples to the contrary, among them examples of literal "atheists in foxholes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lowder |first=Jeffery Jay |year=1997 |title=Atheism and Society |url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/jeff_lowder/society.html |accessdate=2011-04-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522025011/http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/jeff_lowder/society.html |archivedate=22 May 2011  |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some atheists have doubted the very need for the term "atheism". In his book ''[[Letter to a Christian Nation]]'', [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In fact, "atheism" is a term that should not even exist. No one ever needs to identify himself as a "non-[[Astrology|astrologer]]" or a "non-[[Alchemy|alchemist]]". We do not have words for people who doubt that Elvis is still alive or that aliens have traversed the galaxy only to molest ranchers and their cattle. Atheism is nothing more than the noises reasonable people make in the presence of unjustified religious beliefs.{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=ypyMZlkgHGIC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=%22No+one+ever+needs+to+identify+himself+as+a+%22non-astrologer%22%22or+a%22%22non-alchemist%22 51]}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Pragmatic atheism===
Pragmatic atheism is the view one should reject a belief in a god or gods because it is unnecessary for a [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] life. This view is related to [[apatheism]] and [[practical atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://atheism.about.com/od/Atheist-Dictionary/g/Definition-Pragmatic-Atheist.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

"The source of man's unhappiness is his ignorance of Nature. The pertinacity with which he clings to blind opinions imbibed in his infancy, which interweave themselves with his existence, the consequent prejudice that warps his mind, that prevents its expansion, that renders him the slave of fiction, appears to doom him to continual error."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Henri Thiry, Baron d'Holbach, ''System of Nature; or, the Laws of the Moral and Physical World'' (London, 1797), Vol. 1, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Epistemological arguments ===
{{Further|Agnostic atheism|Theological noncognitivism}}
Atheists have also argued that people cannot know a God or prove the existence of a God.  The latter is called agnosticism, which takes a variety of forms. In the philosophy of [[immanence]], divinity is inseparable from the world itself, including a person's mind, and each person's [[consciousness]] is locked in the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]]. According to this form of agnosticism, this limitation in perspective prevents any objective inference from belief in a god to assertions of its existence. The [[Rationalism|rationalistic]] agnosticism of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] only accepts knowledge deduced with human rationality; this form of atheism holds that gods are not discernible as a matter of principle, and therefore cannot be known to exist. [[Skepticism]], based on the ideas of [[David Hume|Hume]], asserts that certainty about anything is impossible, so one can never know for sure whether or not a god exists. Hume, however, held that such unobservable metaphysical concepts should be rejected as "sophistry and illusion".&lt;ref name="hume-metaphysics" /&gt; The allocation of agnosticism to atheism is disputed; it can also be regarded as an independent, basic worldview.&lt;ref name="Zdybicka-p20"&gt;{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other arguments for atheism that can be classified as epistemological or [[ontology|ontological]], including  [[ignosticism]], assert the meaninglessness or unintelligibility of basic terms such as "God" and statements such as "God is all-powerful." [[Theological noncognitivism]] holds that the statement "God exists" does not express a proposition, but is nonsensical or cognitively meaningless. It has been argued both ways as to whether such individuals can be classified into some form of atheism or agnosticism. Philosophers [[Alfred Ayer|A. J. Ayer]] and [[Theodore M. Drange]] reject both categories, stating that both camps accept "God exists" as a proposition; they instead place noncognitivism in its own category.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodore Drange|Drange, Theodore M.]] (1998).

Retrieved 2007-APR-07.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Ayer|Ayer, A. J.]] (1946). ''Language, Truth and Logic''. Dover. pp. 115–116. In a footnote, Ayer attributes this view to "Professor H. H. Price".&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metaphysical arguments ===
{{Further|Monism|Physicalism}}
Philosopher, [[Zofia Zdybicka]] writes:
{{quote|"Metaphysical atheism&amp;nbsp;... includes all doctrines that hold to metaphysical monism (the homogeneity of reality). Metaphysical atheism may be either: a) absolute — an explicit denial of God's existence associated with materialistic monism (all materialistic trends, both in ancient and modern times); b) relative — the implicit denial of God in all philosophies that, while they accept the existence of an absolute, conceive of the absolute as not possessing any of the attributes proper to God: transcendence, a personal character or unity. Relative atheism is associated with idealistic monism (pantheism, panentheism, deism)."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Epikouros BM 1843.jpg|thumb|left|[[Epicurus]] is credited with first expounding the [[problem of evil]]. [[David Hume]] in his ''[[Dialogues concerning Natural Religion]]'' (1779) cited Epicurus in stating the argument as a series of questions:{{sfn|Hume|1779}}
"Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is impotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?"]]

=== Logical arguments ===
{{further|Existence of God#Arguments against the existence of God|l1=Arguments against the existence of God|Problem of evil|Argument from nonbelief|l3=Divine hiddenness}}
Some atheists hold the view that the various [[conceptions of God|conceptions of gods]], such as the [[personal god]] of Christianity, are ascribed logically inconsistent qualities. Such atheists present [[existence of God#Deductive arguments|deductive arguments]] against the existence of God, which assert the incompatibility between certain traits, such as perfection, creator-status, [[immutability (theology)|immutability]], [[omniscience]], [[omnipresence]], [[omnipotence]], [[omnibenevolence]], [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]], personhood (a personal being), nonphysicality, [[justice]], and [[mercy]].&lt;ref name=logical&gt;{{cite web |author=Various authors |url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/nontheism/atheism/logical.html |title=Logical Arguments for Atheism |publisher=[[Internet Infidels]] |website=The Secular Web Library |accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodicy|Theodicean]] atheists believe that the world as they experience it cannot be reconciled with the qualities commonly ascribed to God and gods by theologians. They argue that an [[omniscience|omniscient]], [[omnipotence|omnipotent]], and [[omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] God is not compatible with a world where there is [[problem of evil|evil]] and [[suffering]], and where divine love is [[Divine hiddenness|hidden]] from many people.&lt;ref name="Drange-1996"&gt;{{cite web |first=Theodore M. |last=Drange |authorlink=Theodore Drange |year=1996 |url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/aeanb.html |title=The Arguments From Evil and Nonbelief |publisher=[[Internet Infidels]] |website=Secular Web Library |accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A similar argument is attributed to [[Siddhartha Gautama]], the founder of [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;V.A. Gunasekara, {{cite web |url=http://www.buddhistinformation.com/buddhist_attitude_to_god.htm |title=The Buddhist Attitude to God |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102053643/http://www.buddhistinformation.com/buddhist_attitude_to_god.htm |archivedate=2 January 2008}} In the Bhuridatta Jataka, "The Buddha argues that the three most commonly given attributes of God, viz. omnipotence, omniscience and benevolence towards humanity cannot all be mutually compatible with the existential fact of dukkha."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reductionary accounts of religion ===
{{Further|Evolutionary origin of religions|Evolutionary psychology of religion|Psychology of religion}}
Philosopher [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]]&lt;ref&gt;Feuerbach, Ludwig (1841) ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
and psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] have argued that God and other religious beliefs are human inventions, created to fulfill various psychological and emotional wants or needs. This is also a view of many [[Buddhism|Buddhists]].&lt;ref&gt;Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught.'' Grove Press, 1974. Pages 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], influenced by the work of Feuerbach, argued that belief in God and religion are social functions, used by those in power to oppress the working class. According to [[Mikhail Bakunin]], "the idea of God implies the abdication of human reason and justice; it is the most decisive negation of human liberty, and necessarily ends in the enslavement of mankind, in theory and practice." He reversed [[Voltaire]]'s famous aphorism that if God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him, writing instead that "if God really existed, it would be necessary to abolish him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/bakunin/godandstate/godandstate_ch1.html |title=God and the State |last=Bakunin |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Bakunin |year=1916 |website= |publisher=New York: Mother Earth Publishing Association |accessdate=2011-04-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521195435/http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bakunin/godandstate/godandstate_ch1.html |archivedate=21 May 2011  |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Atheistic philosophies ==
{{Further|Atheist existentialism|Secular humanism}}
[[Axiology|Axiological]], or constructive, atheism rejects the existence of gods in favor of a "higher absolute", such as [[Human nature|humanity]]. This form of atheism favors humanity as the absolute source of ethics and values, and permits individuals to resolve moral problems without resorting to God. Marx and Freud used this argument to convey messages of liberation, full-development, and unfettered happiness.&lt;ref name="Zdybicka-p20" /&gt; One of the most common [[criticism of atheism|criticisms of atheism]] has been to the contrary: that denying the existence of a god either leads to [[moral relativism]] and leaves one with no moral or ethical foundation,&lt;ref name="misconceptions"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.exchristian.net/2006/12/common-misconceptions-about-atheists.html |title=Common Misconceptions About Atheists and Atheism |last=Gleeson |first=David |date=10 August 2006 |accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; or renders life [[meaning of life (religious)|meaningless]] and miserable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1979|p=275}}. "Perhaps the most common criticism of atheism is the claim that it leads inevitably to [[moral bankruptcy]]."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blaise Pascal]] argued this view in his ''[[Pensées]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Blaise Pascal|Pascal, Blaise]] (1669). ''[[Pensées]]'', II: "The Misery of Man Without God".&lt;/ref&gt;

French philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] identified himself as a representative of an "[[atheist existentialism]]"{{sfn|Sartre|2004|p=127}}
concerned less with denying the existence of God than with establishing that "man needs&amp;nbsp;... to find himself again and to understand that nothing can save him from himself, not even a valid proof of the existence of God."{{sfn|Sartre|2001|p=45}}
Sartre said a corollary of his atheism was that "if God does not exist, there is at least one being in whom existence precedes essence, a being who exists before he can be defined by any concept, and&amp;nbsp;... this being is man."{{sfn|Sartre|2004|p=127}}
The practical consequence of this atheism was described by Sartre as meaning that there are no ''a priori rules'' or absolute values that can be invoked to govern human conduct, and that humans are "condemned" to invent these for themselves, making "man" absolutely "responsible for everything he does".{{sfn|Sartre|2001|p=32}}

=== Association with world views and social behaviors ===
Sociologist [[Phil Zuckerman]] analyzed previous social science research on secularity and non-belief, and concluded that societal well-being is positively correlated with irreligion.

The strictest sense of positive atheism does not entail any specific beliefs outside of disbelief in any deity; as such, atheists can hold any number of spiritual beliefs. For the same reason, atheists can hold a wide variety of ethical beliefs, ranging from the [[moral universalism]] of [[humanism]], which holds that a moral code should be applied consistently to all humans, to [[moral nihilism]], which holds that morality is meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1979|pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atheism is accepted as a valid philosophical position within some varieties of [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Chakravarti| first = Sitansu| title = Hinduism, a way of life| publisher = Motilal Banarsidass Publ.| year = 1991| page = 71| url = https://books.google.com/?id=J_-rASTgw8wC&amp;pg=PA71| isbn = 978-81-208-0899-7|quote = According to Hinduism, the path of the atheist is very difficult to follow in matters of spirituality, though it is a valid one. |accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophers such as [[Slavoj Žižek]],&lt;ref&gt;Slavoj Žižek: Less Than Nothing (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alain de Botton]],&lt;ref&gt;Alain de Botton: [[Religion for Atheists]] (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alexander Bard]] and [[Jan Söderqvist]],&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Bard and Jan Söderqvist: The Global Empire (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; have all argued that atheists should reclaim religion as an act of defiance against theism, precisely not to leave religion as an unwarranted monopoly to theists.

=== Divine command ===
According to Plato's [[Euthyphro dilemma]], the role of the gods in determining right from wrong is either unnecessary or arbitrary. [[Divine command theory|The argument that morality must be derived from God]], and cannot exist without a wise creator, has been a persistent feature of political if not so much philosophical debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1979|p=275}}. "Among the many myths associated with religion, none is more widespread -{{sic}}or more disastrous in its effects—than the myth that moral values cannot be divorced from the belief in a god."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In [[Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' (Book Eleven: ''Brother Ivan Fyodorovich'', Chapter 4) there is the famous argument that ''If there is no God, all things are permitted.'': "'But what will become of men then?' I asked him, 'without God and immortal life? All things are lawful then, they can do what they like?'"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kant CPR A811"&gt;For [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], the presupposition of God, soul, and freedom was a practical concern, for "Morality, by itself, constitutes a system, but happiness does not, unless it is distributed in exact proportion to morality. This, however, is possible in an intelligible world only under a wise author and ruler. Reason compels us to admit such a ruler, together with life in such a world, which we must consider as future life, or else all moral laws are to be considered as idle dreams&amp;nbsp;..." (''Critique of Pure Reason'', A811).&lt;/ref&gt;
Moral precepts such as "murder is wrong" are seen as [[divine law]]s, requiring a divine lawmaker and judge. However, many atheists argue that treating morality legalistically involves a [[false analogy]], and that morality does not depend on a lawmaker in the same way that laws do.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] believed in a morality independent of theistic belief, and stated that morality based upon God "has truth only if God is truth—it stands or falls with faith in God."&lt;ref name="Fortin &amp; Benestad"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=19ccmx1W58IC&amp;pg=PA16|title =Human Rights, Virtue, and the Common Good|publisher = [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|quote=That problem was brought home to us with dazzling clarity by Nietzsche, who had reflected more deeply than any of his contemporaries on the implications of godlessness and come to the conclusion that a fatal contradiction lay at the heart of modern theological enterprise: it thought that Christian morality, which it wished to preserve, was independent of Christian dogma, which it rejected.

Baggini argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics, claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves—to be able to discern, for example, that "thou shalt steal" is immoral even if one's religion instructs it—and that atheists, therefore, have the advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The contemporary British political philosopher [[Martin Cohen (philosopher)|Martin Cohen]] has offered the more historically telling example of Biblical injunctions in favor of torture and slavery as evidence of how religious injunctions follow political and social customs, rather than vice versa, but also noted that the same tendency seems to be true of supposedly dispassionate and objective philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;101 Ethical Dilemmas, 2nd edition, by Cohen, M., Routledge 2007, pp&amp;nbsp;184–5. (Cohen notes particularly that Plato and Aristotle produced arguments in favour of slavery.)&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen extends this argument in more detail in ''Political Philosophy from Plato to Mao'', where he argues that the [[Qur'an]] played a role in perpetuating social codes from the early 7th century despite changes in secular society.&lt;ref&gt;Political Philosophy from Plato to Mao, by Cohen, M, Second edition 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Karl Marx.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Karl Marx]]]]

The 19th-century German political theorist and sociologist Karl Marx called religion "the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the [[opium of the people]]". He goes on to say, "The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions. The criticism of religion is, therefore, in embryo, the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo."&lt;ref&gt;Marx, K. 1976. Introduction to A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right. Collected Works, v. 3. New York.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] said that "every religious idea and every idea of God is unutterable vileness&amp;nbsp;... of the most dangerous kind, 'contagion' of the most abominable kind.

== Etymology ==
[[File:Ephesians 2,12 - Greek atheos.jpg|thumb|left|The Greek word {{lang|grc|αθεοι}} (''atheoi''), as it appears in the [[Epistle to the Ephesians]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Ephesians|2:12}}) on the early 3rd-century [[Papyrus 46]]. It is usually translated into English as "[those who are] without God".&lt;ref&gt;The word {{lang|grc|αθεοι}}—in any of its forms—appears nowhere else in the [[Septuagint]] or the [[New Testament]]. {{cite book |last=Robertson |first=A.T. |title=Word Pictures in the New Testament |origyear=1932 |year=1960 |publisher=Broadman Press |chapter=Ephesians: Chapter 2 |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/r/robertson_at/wordpictures/htm/EPH2.RWP.html |quote=Old Greek word, not in LXX, only here in N.T.

In early [[ancient Greek]], the adjective ''{{Transl|grc|átheos}}'' ({{lang|grc|[[:wikt:ἄθεος|ἄθεος]]}}, from the [[privative a|privative ἀ-]] + {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:θεός|θεός]]}} "god") meant "godless". It was first used as a term of censure roughly meaning "ungodly" or "impious". In the 5th century BCE, the word began to indicate more deliberate and active godlessness in the sense of "severing relations with the gods" or "denying the gods". The term [[:wikt:ἀσεβής|ἀσεβής]] (''{{Transl|grc|asebēs}}'') then came to be applied against those who impiously denied or disrespected the local gods, even if they believed in other gods. Modern translations of classical texts sometimes render ''{{Transl|grc|átheos}}'' as "atheistic". As an abstract noun, there was also {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:ἀθεότης|ἀθεότης]]}} (''{{Transl|grc|atheotēs}}''), "atheism". [[Cicero]] transliterated the Greek word into the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|[[:wikt:atheos#Latin|átheos]]}}''. The term found frequent use in the debate between [[early Christianity|early Christians]] and [[Ancient Greek religion|Hellenists]], with each side attributing it, in the pejorative sense, to the other.&lt;ref name=drachmann&gt;{{cite book |last=Drachmann |first=A.

Nevertheless they are not Greek; their formation is not consonant with Greek usage.

In exactly the same way as ungodly, ''{{Transl |grc |átheos}}'' was used as an expression of severe censure and moral condemnation; this use is an old one, and the oldest that can be traced. Not till later do we find it employed to denote a certain philosophical creed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''atheist'' (from Fr. ''{{lang|fr|[[wikt:athée|athée]]}}''), in the sense of "one who&amp;nbsp;... denies the existence of God or gods",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/atheist |title=atheist |publisher=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |year=2009 |accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cudworth, Ralph. The true intellectual system of the universe. 1678. Chapter V Section II p.73&lt;/ref&gt;
At that time "deist" and "deism" already carried their modern meaning. The term ''theism'' came to be contrasted with deism.

[[Karen Armstrong]] writes that "During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the word 'atheist' was still reserved exclusively for [[polemic]]&amp;nbsp;... The term 'atheist' was an insult. Nobody would have dreamed of calling ''himself'' an atheist."{{sfn|Armstrong|1999}}

''Atheism'' was first used to describe a self-avowed belief in late 18th-century Europe, specifically denoting disbelief in the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[Abrahamic god]].&lt;ref name="adevism"&gt;In part because of its wide use in monotheistic Western society, ''atheism'' is usually described as "disbelief in God", rather than more generally as "disbelief in deities". A clear distinction is rarely drawn in modern writings between these two definitions, but some archaic uses of ''atheism'' encompassed only disbelief in the singular God, not in [[polytheism|polytheistic]] deities. It is on this basis that the obsolete term ''[[adevism]]'' was coined in the late 19th century to describe an absence of belief in plural deities.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 20th century, [[globalization]] contributed to the expansion of the term to refer to disbelief in all deities, though it remains common in Western society to describe atheism as simply "disbelief in God".{{sfn|Martin|2006}}

Among the six [[Astika and Nastika|orthodox]] schools of Hindu philosophy, [[Samkhya]], the oldest philosophical school of thought, does not accept God, and the early [[Mimamsa]] also rejected the notion of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dasgupta |first=Surendranath |title=A history of Indian philosophy, Volume 1 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |year=1992 |page=258 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PoaMFmS1_lEC&amp;pg=PA258 |isbn=978-8-120-80412-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The thoroughly materialistic and anti-theistic philosophical [[Cārvāka]] (or ''Lokāyata'') school that originated in [[India]] around the 6th century BCE is probably the most explicitly atheistic school of philosophy in India, similar to the Greek [[Cyrenaic school]]. This branch of Indian philosophy is classified as [[nastika|heterodox]] due to its rejection of the authority of [[Vedas]] and hence is not considered part of the six orthodox schools of Hinduism, but it is noteworthy as evidence of a materialistic movement within Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Charles A.

Chatterjee and Datta explain that our understanding of Cārvāka philosophy is fragmentary, based largely on criticism of the ideas by other schools, and that it is not a living tradition:&lt;ref&gt;Satischandra Chatterjee and Dhirendramohan Datta. ''An Introduction to Indian Philosophy''. Eighth Reprint Edition. (University of Calcutta: 1984). p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|Though [[materialism]] in some form or other has always been present in India, and occasional references are found in the Vedas, the Buddhistic literature, the Epics, as well as in the later philosophical works we do not find any systematic work on materialism, nor any organized school of followers as the other philosophical schools possess. But almost every work of the other schools states, for refutation, the materialistic views. Our knowledge of Indian materialism is chiefly based on these.}}

Other Indian philosophies generally regarded as atheistic include [[Samkhya|Classical Samkhya]] and [[Mimamsa|Purva Mimamsa]].

Testimonies, especially in the context of polemical criticism, are found e.g. in [[Callimachus]], ''Hymn to Zeus'' 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Although not strictly an atheist, Euhemerus was later criticized for having "spread atheism over the whole inhabited earth by obliterating the gods".&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Moralia—Isis and Osiris'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Isis_and_Osiris*/B.html#23 23]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important Greek thinker in the development of atheism was [[Epicurus]] ({{circa}} 300 BCE).&lt;ref name="GraftonMostSettis"/&gt; Drawing on the ideas of Democritus and the Atomists, he espoused a materialistic philosophy according to which the universe was governed by the laws of chance without the need for divine intervention (see [[scientific determinism]]).&lt;ref name="EpicStanEncycl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epicurus/ |title=Epicurus (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |website=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Epicurus still maintained that the gods existed,&lt;ref name="Hickson2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hickson|first=Michael W.|editor1-last=McBrayer|editor1-first=Justin P.|editor2-last=Howard-Snyder|editor2-first=Daniel|date=2014|chapter=A Brief History of Problems of Evil|title=The Blackwell Companion to The Problem of Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J0ScAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT26|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-118-60797-8|pages=26–27|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GraftonMostSettis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EpicStanEncycl"/&gt; he believed that they were uninterested in human affairs.&lt;ref name="EpicStanEncycl"/&gt; The aim of the Epicureans was to attain ''[[ataraxia]]'' ("peace of mind") and one important way of doing this was by exposing fear of divine wrath as irrational.

The Roman philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]] held that one should suspend judgment about virtually all beliefs—a form of skepticism known as [[Pyrrhonism]]—that nothing was inherently evil, and that ataraxia is attainable by withholding one's judgment. His relatively large volume of surviving works had a lasting influence on later philosophers.&lt;ref name="gordonstein"&gt;Stein, Gordon (Ed.) (1980).

=== Early Middle Ages to the Renaissance ===
During the [[Early Middle Ages]], the [[Islamic world]] experienced a [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age]].  Along with advances in science and philosophy, Arab and Persian lands produced outspoken rationalists and atheists, including [[Muhammad al Warraq]] (fl. 9th century), [[Ibn al-Rawandi]] (827–911), [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi|Al-Razi]] (854–925), and [[Al-Maʿarri]] (973–1058).  Al-Ma'arri wrote and taught that religion itself was a "fable invented by the ancients"&lt;ref name="Nicholson318"&gt;Reynold Alleyne Nicholson, 1962, ''A Literary History of the Arabs'', page 318. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; and that humans were "of two sorts: those with brains, but no religion, and those with religion, but no brains."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sdsmt.edu/student-orgs/tfs/reading/freethought/islam.html Freethought Traditions in the Islamic World] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214102422/http://www.sdsmt.edu/student-orgs/tfs/reading/freethought/islam.html |date=14 February 2012 }} by Fred Whitehead; also quoted in Cyril Glasse, (2001), ''The New Encyclopedia of Islam'', p. 278. Rowman Altamira.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite their being relatively prolific writers, little of their work survives, mainly being preserved through quotations and excerpts in later works by Muslim [[Apologetics|apologists]] attempting to refute them.&lt;ref&gt;''Al-Zandaqa Wal Zanadiqa'', by Mohammad Abd-El Hamid Al-Hamad, first edition 1999, Dar Al-Taliaa Al-Jadida, Syria (Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent Golden Age scholars have been associated with rationalist thought and atheism as well, although the current intellectual atmosphere in the Islamic world, and the scant evidence that survives from the era, make this point a contentious one today.

In Europe, the espousal of atheistic views was rare during the Early Middle Ages and [[Middle Ages]] (see [[Medieval Inquisition]]); [[metaphysics]] and theology were the dominant interests pertaining to religion.&lt;ref name="Zdybicka 2005 4"&gt;{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were, however, movements within this period that furthered heterodox conceptions of the Christian god, including differing views of the nature, transcendence, and knowability of God. Individuals and groups such as [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]], [[David of Dinant]], [[Amalric of Bena]], and the [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]] maintained Christian viewpoints with [[pantheism|pantheistic]] tendencies.  [[Nicholas of Cusa]] held to a form of [[fideism]] he called ''[[De Docta Ignorantia|docta ignorantia]]'' ("learned ignorance"), asserting that God is beyond human categorization, and thus our knowledge of him is limited to conjecture. [[William of Ockham]] inspired anti-metaphysical tendencies with his [[nominalism|nominalistic]] limitation of human knowledge to singular objects, and asserted that the divine [[essence]] could not be intuitively or rationally apprehended by human intellect. Followers of Ockham, such as [[John of Mirecourt]] and [[Nicholas of Autrecourt]] furthered this view. The resulting division between [[Faith and rationality|faith and reason]] influenced later radical and reformist theologians such as [[John Wycliffe]], [[Jan Hus]], and [[Martin Luther]].&lt;ref name="Zdybicka 2005 4" /&gt;

The [[Renaissance]] did much to expand the scope of free thought and skeptical inquiry. Individuals such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] sought experimentation as a means of explanation, and opposed [[Appeal to authority|arguments from religious authority]].  Other critics of religion and the Church during this time included [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Bonaventure des Périers]], [[Michel de Montaigne]], and [[François Rabelais]].&lt;ref name="gordonstein" /&gt;

=== Early modern period ===
Historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]] wrote that the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] had paved the way for atheists by attacking the authority of the Catholic Church, which in turn "quietly inspired other thinkers to attack the authority of the new Protestant churches".&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; p.388&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deism]] gained influence in France, Prussia, and England. The philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]] was "probably the first well known 'semi-atheist' to announce himself in a Christian land in the modern era", according to Blainey. Spinoza believed that natural laws explained the workings of the universe. In 1661 he published his ''Short Treatise on God''.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; p.343&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Criticism of Christianity]] became increasingly frequent in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and England, where there appears to have been a religious [[malaise]], according to contemporary sources. Some Protestant thinkers, such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], espoused a materialist philosophy and skepticism toward supernatural occurrences, while Spinoza rejected [[divine providence]] in favor of a [[panentheistic]] naturalism. By the late 17th century, deism came to be openly espoused by intellectuals such as [[John Toland (Irish Philosopher)|John Toland]] who coined the term "pantheist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pantheism |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known explicit atheist was the German critic of religion [[Matthias Knutzen]] in his three writings of 1674.&lt;ref&gt;Winfried Schröder, in: Matthias Knutzen: Schriften und Materialien (2010), p. 8. See also Rececca Moore, ''The Heritage of Western Humanism, Scepticism and Freethought'' (2011), calling Knutzen "the first open advocate of a modern atheist perspective" [http://reason.sdsu.edu/germany.html online here]&lt;/ref&gt; He was followed by two other explicit atheist writers, the Polish ex-Jesuit philosopher [[Kazimierz Łyszczyński]] and in the 1720s by the French priest [[Jean Meslier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nova.wpunj.edu/newpolitics/issue40/Onfray40.htm |title=Michel Onfray on Jean Meslier |publisher=William Paterson University |accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of the 18th century, other openly atheistic thinkers followed, such as [[Baron d'Holbach]], [[Jacques-André Naigeon]], and other [[French materialism|French materialists]].&lt;ref name="Holbach-SoN"&gt;{{cite book |last=d'Holbach |first=P. H. T. |authorlink=Baron d'Holbach |title=The System of Nature |url=http://fulltextarchive.com/page/The-System-of-Nature-Vol-21/ |accessdate=2011-04-07 |year=1770 |volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Locke]] in contrast, though an advocate of tolerance, urged authorities not to tolerate atheism, believing that the denial of God's existence would undermine the social order and lead to chaos.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeremy Waldron]]; ''God, Locke, and Equality: Christian Foundations in Locke's Political Thought''; Cambridge, UK; 2002; p.217&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[David Hume]] developed a skeptical epistemology grounded in [[empiricism]], and [[Immanuel Kant]]'s philosophy has strongly questioned the very possibility of a metaphysical knowledge. Both philosophers undermined the metaphysical basis of natural theology and criticized classical [[arguments for the existence of God]].

[[File:Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]]'s ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' (1841) would greatly influence philosophers such as [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[David Strauss]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], and [[Max Stirner]]. He considered God to be a human invention and religious activities to be wish-fulfillment. For this he is considered the founding father of modern [[anthropology of religion]].]]
Blainey notes that, although [[Voltaire]] is widely considered to have strongly contributed to atheistic thinking during the Revolution, he also considered fear of God to have discouraged further disorder, having said "If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him."&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; pp.&amp;nbsp;390–391&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790), the philosopher [[Edmund Burke]] denounced atheism, writing of a "literary cabal" who had "some years ago formed something like a regular plan for the destruction of the Christian religion. This object they pursued with a degree of zeal which hitherto had been discovered only in the propagators of some system of piety&amp;nbsp;... These atheistical fathers have a bigotry of their own&amp;nbsp;...".  But, Burke asserted, "man is by his constitution a religious animal" and "atheism is against, not only our reason, but our instincts; and&amp;nbsp;... it cannot prevail long".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/burke/edmund/reflections-on-the-revolution-in-france/|title=Reflections on the Revolution in France|website=adelaide.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Baron d'Holbach]] was a prominent figure in the [[French Enlightenment]] who is best known for his atheism and for his voluminous writings against religion, the most famous of them being ''[[The System of Nature]]'' (1770) but also ''[[Christianity Unveiled]]''. One goal of the [[French Revolution]] was a restructuring and subordination of the clergy with respect to the state through the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]]. Attempts to enforce it led to [[anticlericalism|anti-clerical]] violence and the expulsion of many clergy from France, lasting until the [[Thermidorian Reaction]]. The radical [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]] seized power in 1793, ushering in the [[Reign of Terror]]. The Jacobins were deists and introduced the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]] as a new French state religion. Some atheists surrounding [[Jacques Hébert]] instead sought to establish a [[Cult of Reason]], a form of atheistic pseudo-religion with a goddess personifying reason. The [[Napoleonic era]] further institutionalized the secularization of French society.

In the latter half of the 19th century, atheism rose to prominence under the influence of [[rationalism|rationalistic]] and [[freethought|freethinking]] philosophers. Many prominent German philosophers of this era denied the existence of deities and were critical of religion, including [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Max Stirner]], [[Karl Marx]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BKz2FcDrFy0C&amp;pg=PA1 |title=Subjectivity and Irreligion: Atheism and Agnosticism in Kant, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |last=Ray |first=Matthew Alun |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-754-63456-0 |accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Holyoake]] was the last person (1842) imprisoned in Great Britain due to atheist beliefs. Law notes that he may have also been the first imprisoned on such a charge. [[Stephen Law]] states that Holyoake "first coined the term 'secularism'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Humanism.

{{Further|Marxism and religion}}
Atheism, particularly in the form of practical atheism, advanced in many societies in the 20th century. Atheistic thought found recognition in a wide variety of other, broader philosophies, such as [[existentialism]], [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|objectivism]], [[secular humanism]], [[nihilism]], [[anarchism]], [[logical positivism]], [[Marxism]], [[feminism]],&lt;ref name=feminism&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tAeFipOVx4MC&amp;pg=PA233&amp;dq=%22Feminism+and+Atheism%22 |last=Overall |first=Christine |chapter=Feminism and Atheism |year=2006 |accessdate=2011-04-09 |title=The Cambridge Companion to Atheism |isbn=978-1-139-82739-3}} in {{harvnb|Martin|2006|pp=233–246}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the general scientific and [[rationalist movement]].

[[File:Honourable Bertrand Russell.jpg|thumb|upright|The British philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]]]]
Logical positivism and [[scientism]] paved the way for [[neopositivism]], [[analytical philosophy]], [[structuralism]], and [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]. Neopositivism and analytical philosophy discarded classical rationalism and metaphysics in favor of strict empiricism and epistemological [[nominalism]]. Proponents such as [[Bertrand Russell]] emphatically rejected belief in God. In his early work, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] attempted to separate metaphysical and supernatural language from rational discourse. [[A. J. Ayer]] asserted the unverifiability and meaninglessness of religious statements, citing his adherence to the empirical sciences. Relatedly the [[Structural anthropology|applied structuralism]] of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]] sourced religious language to the human subconscious in denying its transcendental meaning. [[John Niemeyer Findlay|J. N. Findlay]] and [[J. J. C. Smart]] argued that the existence of God is not logically necessary. Naturalists and materialistic monists such as [[John Dewey]] considered the natural world to be the basis of everything, denying the existence of God or immortality.&lt;ref name="stanford" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"New Atheism" is the name that has been given to a movement among some early-21st-century atheist writers who have advocated the view that "religion should not simply be tolerated but should be countered, criticized, and exposed by rational argument wherever its influence arises."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/11/08/atheism.feature/index.html |title=The rise of the New Atheists |publisher=CNN |first=Simon |last=Hooper |accessdate=2010-03-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408094135/http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/11/08/atheism.feature/index.html |archivedate=8 April 2010  |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--- NB: they may also advocate other views---&gt;

A study noted positive correlations between levels of education and secularism, including atheism, in America.&lt;ref name="Zuckerman" /&gt; According to evolutionary psychologist Nigel Barber, atheism blossoms in places where most people feel economically secure, particularly in the [[Social democracy|social democracies]] of Europe, as there is less uncertainty about the future with extensive social safety nets and better health care resulting in a greater quality of life and higher life expectancy. By contrast, in underdeveloped countries, there are virtually no atheists.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Barber (2010).

In a sample of 137 countries, the correlation between national IQ and disbelief in God was found to be 0.60.&lt;ref name="intmag"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lynn |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Lynn |last2=Harvey |first2=John |last3=Nyborg |first3=Helmuth |title=Average intelligence predicts atheism rates across 137 nations |journal=[[Intelligence (journal)|Intelligence]] |year=2009 |volume=37 |pages=11–15 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289608000238 |doi=10.1016/j.intell.2008.03.004 |accessdate=2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary psychologist Nigel Barber states that the reason atheists are more intelligent than religious people is better explained by social, environmental, and wealth factors which happen to correlate with loss of religious belief as well. He doubts that religion causes stupidity, noting that some highly intelligent people have also been religious, but he says it is plausible that higher intelligence correlates to rejection of improbable religious beliefs and that the situation between intelligence and rejection of religious beliefs is quite complex.&lt;ref name="Nigel atheists"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barber|first1=Nigel|title=The Real Reason Atheists Have Higher IQs: Is Atheism a Sign of Intelligence?|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-human-beast/201005/the-real-reason-atheists-have-higher-iqs|publisher=Psychology Today|date=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2017 study, it was shown that compared to religious individuals, atheists have higher reasoning capacities and this difference seemed to be unrelated to sociodemographic factors  such as age, education and country of origin.&lt;ref name="Daws"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Daws|first1=Richard E.|last2=Hampshire|first2=Adam|title=The Negative Relationship between Reasoning and Religiosity Is Underpinned by a Bias for Intuitive Responses Specifically When Intuition and Logic Are in Conflict|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|date=19 December 2017|volume=8|pages=2191|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02191|pmid=29312057|pmc=5742220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attitudes toward atheism===

Statistically, atheists are held in poor regard across the globe. Non-atheists, and possibly even fellow atheists, seem to implicitly view atheists as prone to exhibit immoral behaviors ranging from mass murder to not paying at a restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carey|first1=Benedict|title=The Serial Killer Test: Biases Against Atheists Emerge in Study|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/07/health/atheists-religion-study.html|accessdate=2018-01-23|work=The New York Times|date=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Paris|first1=Agence France-Presse in|title=Atheists tend to be seen as immoral – even by other atheists: study|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/07/anti-atheist-prejudice-secularity|accessdate=2018-01-23|work=the Guardian|date=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gervais|first1=Will M.|last2=Xygalatas|first2=Dimitris|last3=McKay|first3=Ryan T.|last4=van Elk|first4=Michiel|last5=Buchtel|first5=Emma E.|last6=Aveyard|first6=Mark|last7=Schiavone|first7=Sarah R.|last8=Dar-Nimrod|first8=Ilan|last9=Svedholm-Häkkinen|first9=Annika M.|last10=Riekki|first10=Tapani|last11=Klocová|first11=Eva Kundtová|last12=Ramsay|first12=Jonathan E.|last13=Bulbulia|first13=Joseph|title=Global evidence of extreme intuitive moral prejudice against atheists|journal=Nature Human Behaviour|date=7 August 2017|volume=1|issue=8|pages=0151|doi=10.1038/s41562-017-0151|url=http://psyarxiv.com/csnp2/|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, according to a 2016 [[Pew Research Center]] publication, 15% of French people, 45% of Americans, and 99% of Indonesians explicitly believe that a person must believe in God to be moral.

&lt;ref name="encyc-unbelief-def-issues"&gt;{{cite book |last=Harvey |first=Van A. |title=Agnosticism and Atheism |postscript=,}} in {{harvnb|Flynn|2007|p=35}}: "The terms ''ATHEISM'' and ''AGNOSTICISM'' lend themselves to two different definitions. The first takes the privative ''a'' both before the Greek ''theos'' (divinity) and ''gnosis'' (to know) to mean that atheism is simply the absence of belief in the gods and agnosticism is simply lack of knowledge of some specified subject matter. The second definition takes atheism to mean the explicit denial of the existence of gods and agnosticism as the position of someone who, because the existence of gods is unknowable, suspends judgment regarding them&amp;nbsp;... The first is the more inclusive and recognizes only two alternatives: Either one believes in the gods or one does not. Consequently, there is no third alternative, as those who call themselves agnostics sometimes claim. Insofar as they lack belief, they are really atheists. Moreover, since absence of belief is the cognitive position in which everyone is born, the burden of proof falls on those who advocate religious belief. The proponents of the second definition, by contrast, regard the first definition as too broad because it includes uninformed children along with aggressive and explicit atheists. Consequently, it is unlikely that the public will adopt it."&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="eb2011-atheism"&gt;{{harvnb|Nielsen|2013}}: "Instead of saying that an atheist is someone who believes that it is false or probably false that there is a God, a more adequate characterization of atheism consists in the more complex claim that to be an atheist is to be someone who rejects belief in God for the following reasons&amp;nbsp;... : for an anthropomorphic God, the atheist rejects belief in God because it is false or probably false that there is a God; for a nonanthropomorphic God&amp;nbsp;... because the concept of such a God is either meaningless, unintelligible, contradictory, incomprehensible, or incoherent; for the God portrayed by some modern or contemporary theologians or philosophers&amp;nbsp;... because the concept of God in question is such that it merely masks an atheistic substance—e.g., "God" is just another name for love, or&amp;nbsp;... a symbolic term for moral ideals."&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="eb1911-atheism"&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Atheism | quote = The term as generally used, however, is highly ambiguous. Its meaning varies (a) according to the various definitions of deity, and especially (b) according as it is (i.) deliberately adopted by a thinker as a description of his own theological standpoint, or (ii.) applied by one set of thinkers to their opponents. As to (a), it is obvious that atheism from the standpoint of the Christian is a very different conception as compared with atheism as understood by a Deist, a Positivist, a follower of Euhemerus or Herbert Spencer, or a Buddhist.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="encyc-philosophy"&gt;{{harvnb|Edwards|2005}}: "On our definition, an 'atheist' is a person who rejects belief in God, regardless of whether or not his reason for the rejection is the claim that 'God exists' expresses a false proposition. People frequently adopt an attitude of rejection toward a position for reasons other than that it is a false proposition. It is common among contemporary philosophers, and indeed it was not uncommon in earlier centuries, to reject positions on the ground that they are meaningless. Sometimes, too, a theory is rejected on such grounds as that it is sterile or redundant or capricious, and there are many other considerations which in certain contexts are generally agreed to constitute good grounds for rejecting an assertion."&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=RoweRoutledge&gt;{{harvnb|Rowe|1998}}: "As commonly understood, atheism is the position that affirms the nonexistence of God. So an atheist is someone who disbelieves in God, whereas a theist is someone who believes in God. Another meaning of 'atheism' is simply nonbelief in the existence of God, rather than positive belief in the nonexistence of God.&amp;nbsp;... an atheist, in the broader sense of the term, is someone who disbelieves in every form of deity, not just the God of traditional Western theology."&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--ref name=extreme-secularism&gt;{{harvnb|Zuckerman|2010}}: "A major source of these biases is the lack of clear definitions. Atheism and secularity are defined in opposition to religion, with atheism (the rejection of theism) often perceived as an extreme form of secularism (the decline of religious influence over society). But atheism is a narrow term referring to a specific belief (that there is no god), whereas secularism has various meanings, including a range of attitudes (such as religious indifference, doubt, agnosticism, and atheism) as as behaviors (such as lack of regular church attendance or disregard for traditional religious morality)."&lt;/ref--&gt;
&lt;ref name="martin-agnosticism-entails"&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|2006|p=2}}: "But agnosticism is compatible with negative atheism in that agnosticism ''entails'' negative atheism.

The '''Bar Ilan Responsa Project''' (the ''Global Jewish Database'') is a collection of Jewish texts in Hebrew, released on CD and more currently USB flashdrive by the [[Bar-Ilan University]] (in [[Ramat Gan]], [[Israel]]).

== Background ==

The database consists of one of the world's largest electronic collection of Jewish texts in Hebrew.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://responsa.biu.ac.il/about.htm |title=About the CD |publisher=Judaic Responsa |accessdate=2009-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815103642/http://responsa.biu.ac.il/about.htm |archivedate=2009-08-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It includes numerous works from the [[History of Responsa|Responsa Literature]] (rabbinic case-law rulings).&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

The database also includes the [[Bible]] and the [[Talmud]] (with commentaries); articles about Jewish law and customs; [[Maimonides]]' [[Mishneh Torah]] and the [[Shulchan Aruch]] with main commentaries; [[Zohar]], [[Midrashim]], and the [[Talmudic Encyclopedia]].&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

Today the Responsa Project CD-ROM contains more than 90,000 Responsa and more than 420,000 hypertext links between the databases totalling 200 million words.

The project was founded by Prof. [[Aviezri Fraenkel]] who served as its initial director (1963–1974), and subsequent director Prof. [[Yaakov Choueka]] (1975–1986), as cited by the [[Israel Prize]] committee. Currently the project is headed by Professor [[Shmaryahu Hoz]].

Throughout history, various groups of people have considered themselves to be '''chosen people''' by a [[deity]] for a purpose, such as to act as the deity's agent on earth.{{cite-needed|date=April 2017}} In [[monotheistic]] faiths references to [[God in Abrahamic religions|God]] are used in constructs such as "God's Chosen People". The phenomenon of a "chosen people" is particularly common in the
Israelite tradition, where it originally referred to the Israelites—in fact Jews refer to this as a burden to spread the message of one God. Some claims of chosenness are based on parallel claims of [[groups claiming affiliation with Israelites|Israelite]] ancestry, as is the case for the [[Christian Identity]] and [[Black Hebrew]] sects—both which claim themselves (and not Jews) to be the "true Israel". Others claim a "spiritual" chosenness, including most Christian denominations, who traditionally believe the church has replaced Israel as the [[People of God]].

[[Anthropologist]]s commonly regard claims of chosenness as a form of [[ethnocentrism]].&lt;ref name="HavilandPrins2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William A. Haviland|author2=Harald E. L. Prins|author3=Dana Walrath|author4=Bunny McBride|title=The Essence of Anthropology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AmvJ1XtnIQoC&amp;pg=PA159|year=2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-59981-4|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EitzenZinn2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=D. Stanley Eitzen|author2=Maxine Baca Zinn|title=In conflict and order: understanding society|year=2003|edition=10th|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-0-205-37622-3|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
{{Main article|Jews as the chosen people}}
In Judaism, "chosenness" is the belief that the [[Jew]]s, via descent from the ancient [[Israelites]], are the chosen people, i.e. chosen to be in a [[covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with [[God in Judaism|God]]. The idea of the Israelites being chosen by God is found most directly in the [[Book of Deuteronomy]]&lt;ref&gt;Clements, Ronald (1968). ''God's Chosen People: a Theological Interpretation of the Book of Deuteronomy''. In series, ''Religious Book Club'', 182. London: S.C.M. Press&lt;/ref&gt; as the verb ''bahar'' ({{native name|he|בָּחַ֣ר|italics=off}}), and is alluded to elsewhere in the [[Hebrew Bible]] using other terms such as "holy people".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9nN8AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Jews as a Chosen People: Tradition and Transformation, S. Leyla Gurkan]&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Much is written about these topics in [[rabbinic literature]]. The three largest Jewish denominations—[[Orthodox Judaism]], [[Conservative Judaism]] and [[Reform Judaism]]—maintain the belief that the Jews have been chosen by God for a purpose. Sometimes this choice is seen as charging the Jewish people with a specific mission—to be a light unto the nations, and to exemplify the [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with God as described in the Torah.

===Seventh-day Adventism===
{{Main article|Remnant (Adventist)|Three Angels' Messages}}

===Mormonism===
{{See also|Mormonism|Mormonism and Judaism|Mormonism and Islam}}
In [[Mormonism]], all [[Latter Day Saint]]s are viewed as [[Covenant (Latter Day Saints)|covenant]], or chosen, people because they have accepted the name of Jesus Christ through the [[ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinance]] of baptism. In contrast to [[supersessionism]], Latter Day Saints do not dispute the "chosen" status of the Jewish people.
Most practicing Mormons receive a [[patriarchal blessing]] that reveals their lineage in the House of Israel. This lineage may be blood related or through "adoption;" therefore, a child may not necessarily share the lineage of her parents (but will still be a member of the [[tribes of Israel]]). It is a widely held belief&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel H. Ludlow]], [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1991/01/of-the-house-of-israel "Of the House of Israel"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', January 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lds.org/manual/old-testament-seminary-student-study-guide/genesis-44  |title= Genesis 44&amp;nbsp;– Joseph Tests His Brothers |accessdate=|work=[http://www/lds.org/ lds.org] |publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints }}&lt;/ref&gt; that most members of the faith are in the [[tribe of Ephraim]] or the [[tribe of Manasseh]].

===Christian Identity===
{{Main article|Christian Identity}}
The Christian Identity movement sees the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]], [[Germanic people|Germanic]], [[Nordic race|Nordic]] and kindred peoples of the world as both the descendants of the ancient Israelites and the physical descendants of [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]]. Christian Identity, though not organized as a religion, comprises certain individuals, [[local church|churches]] and some [[prison gang]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/domestic-extremism-terrorism/c/bigotry-behind-bars-racist-groups-in-US-prisons.html|title= Bigotry Behind Bars: Racist Groups In U.S. Prisons|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150729081815/http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/domestic-extremism-terrorism/c/bigotry-behind-bars-racist-groups-in-US-prisons.html|archivedate= 2015-07-29|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=January 2017}} with a [[white supremacist]] theology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Eck|first= Diane|year= 2009|authorlink= Diana L.

that promotes a [[racial]] interpretation of [[Christianity]]. Christian Identity beliefs were primarily developed and promoted by two authors{{which?|date=January 2017}} who regarded Europeans as the "chosen people" and Jews as the cursed offspring of [[Cain]]. [[White supremacist]] sects and gangs later adopted many of these teachings.

==Rastafari==
{{Main article| Rastafari}}
Based on Jewish biblical tradition and Ethiopian legend via [[Kebra Nagast]], Rastas believe that Israel's [[King Solomon]], together with Ethiopian [[Queen of Sheba]], conceived a child which began the [[Solomonic dynasty|Solomonic line]] of kings in Ethiopia, rendering the Ethiopian people as the true children of Israel, and thereby chosen. Reinforcement of this belief occurred when [[Beta Israel]], Ethiopia's ancient Israelite First Temple community, were rescued from Sudanese famine and brought to Israel during [[Operation Moses]] in 1985.

==Unification Church==

[[Sun Myung Moon]] taught that [[Korea]] is the chosen nation, selected to serve a divine mission and was "chosen by God to be the birthplace of the leading figure of the age"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tparents.org/Library/Unification/Publications/ICC-Q-A/ICC-05.htm Questions and Answers - The Second Coming - Rev Moon And Korea.] Unofficial Notes from International Conferences for Clergy.

==Nation of Islam==
{{main article|Nation of Islam}}
The NOI teaches that black people constitute a nation and that through the institution of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] they were systematically denied knowledge of [[History of Africa|their history]], [[Languages of Africa|language]], [[Culture of Africa|culture]], and [[Traditional African religion|religion]] and, in effect, lost control of their lives. Founder [[Elijah Muhammad]] called for the establishment of a separate nation for black Americans and the adoption of a religion based on the worship of [[Allah]] and on the belief that blacks were his chosen people.

The role of the Christ in Christianity [[Christianity and Judaism#The Messiah|originated from the concept]] of the [[messiah]] in [[Judaism]]. Although the conceptions of the messiah in each religion are similar, for the most part they are distinct from one another due to the [[split of early Christianity and Judaism]] in the [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st century]].

Though the original [[Disciple (Christianity)|followers of Jesus]] believed Jesus to be the Jewish messiah, e.g. in the [[Confession of Peter]], before the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]], Jesus was usually referred to as "Jesus of Nazareth" or "Jesus, son of [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]".&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Jesus Christ | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica | accessdate=23 May 2013 |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/303091/Jesus-Christ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus came to be called "Jesus Christ" (meaning "Jesus the ''Khristós''", i.e. "Jesus the Messiah" or "Jesus the Anointed") by his followers after his crucifixion and resurrection. Christians believe that the [[Christian messianic prophecies|messianic prophecies]] were fulfilled in his [[Ministry of Jesus|mission]], [[Crucifixion of Jesus|death]], and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]. The [[Pauline epistles]], the earliest texts of the [[New Testament]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marcus-borg/a-chronological-new-testament_b_1823018.html | title=A Chronological New Testament | work=The Huffington Post | date=31 August 2012 | last=Borg | first= Marcus|authorlink=Marcus Borg}}&lt;/ref&gt; often refer to Jesus as "Christ Jesus" or "Christ".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Saint Paul, the Apostle|encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2013-05-23 |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/447019/Saint-Paul-the-Apostle}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''Christ'' was originally a title, but later became part of the name "Jesus Christ". It is also used as a title, in the reciprocal use "Christ Jesus", meaning "the Messiah Jesus", and independently as "the Christ".&lt;ref name=Pannenberg/&gt;

The followers of Jesus became known as Christians (as in [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] {{bibleref2-nb|Acts|11:26|9}}) because they believed Jesus to be the ''Khristós'' or ''Mashiach'' [[prophecy|prophesied]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref name=Miriam /&gt;&lt;ref name=mercer142&gt;{{cite book|title=Mercer dictionary of the Bible |first1=Watson E. |last1=Mills |first2=Roger Aubrey |last2=Bullard |year=1998 |isbn=0-86554-373-9 |page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus was not, and is not, [[Rejection of Jesus#Jewish rejection|accepted in Judaism]] as [[Messiah in Judaism|a Jewish messiah]], and the concept of a divine messiah was always rejected by [[Judaism]] as [[Idolatry#Judaism|idolatry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The nine questions people ask about Judaism |first1=Dennis |last1=Prager | authorlink1=Dennis Prager |first2=Joseph |last2=Telushkin | authorlink2=Joseph Telushkin |year=1981 |isbn=0-671-42593-5 |page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious [[Jews]] still await their messiah's first coming and the [[Messiah#Judaism|Messianic prophecies of Jewish tradition]] to be accomplished.

Christ comes from {{lang|grc|Χριστός}} (''Christos''), meaning "[[anointing|anointed]] one". In the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[Septuagint]], ''christos'' was used to translate the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] מָשִׁיחַ (''Mašíaḥ,'' messiah), meaning "[one who is] anointed.", a title allegedly adopted from the term for the tradition of anointing the Egyptian pharaoh during coronation or marriage with oil drawn from the fat of ''messeh'', who was the sacred crocodile or crocodile star in the spells and the same anointing ritual may be traced to earlier Mesopotamian [[Mušḫuššu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Osman|first1=Ahmed|title=Jesus in the House of the Pharaohs: The Essene Revelations on the Historical Jesus|date=2004|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781591438786|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9VkoDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT179|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Laurence|title=Genesis of the Grail Kings: The Pendragon Legacy of Adam and Eve |publisher=Bantam Press|isbn=9780593044308|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jPEQAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=crocodile+star+messeh&amp;dq=crocodile+star+messeh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjg4ciFwvzYAhWFEVAKHTTOC_0Q6AEIbjAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rush|first1=John A.|title=The Twelve Gates: A Spiritual Passage Through the Egyptian Books of the Dead|publisher=Frog Books|isbn=9781583941751|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yl8WpoJrPMoC&amp;pg=PA165}}&lt;/ref&gt; In coffins of Egyptian mummies the word ''krst'' is found as a blessing and anointing  from [[Horus]] and [[Osiris]], hence the word ''Christos'' is thought as loaned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardiner|first1=Philip|title=Gateways to the Otherworld: The Secrets Beyond the Final Journey, from the Egyptian Underworld to the Gates in the Sky: Easyread Super Large 18pt Edition|isbn=9781442960992|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tk6hcjx6BfgC&amp;pg=PA72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Egypt Light Of The World 2 Vol Set|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134568918|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QcBYAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA218}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Krst'' denoted the process of preparation of the mummy by embalming, purifying and anointing, and can mean anointed, buried or covered in oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Massey|first1=Gerald|title=Ancient Egypt - Light Of The World, Volume 1|publisher=Jazzybee Verlag|isbn=9783849644444|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ED-kAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT291}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brownlow|first1=Lewis S.|title=The Imminent Second Coming|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=9781466953536|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O0PpaLrzElQC&amp;pg=PA21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ifie|first1=Egbe|title=Papers in Honour of Professor Dapo Adelugba at 60|publisher=End-Time Publishing House, Indiana University|isbn=9789782163004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2wkKAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=krst+anoint&amp;dq=krst+anoint&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiPgo_I0PzYAhWPa1AKHejNBLs4FBDoAQhfMAk|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elleh|first1=Nnamdi|title=African Architecture: Evolution and Transformation|date=1997|publisher=McGraw-Hill, the University of Michigan|isbn=9780070215061|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_yHqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=krst+anoint&amp;dq=krst+anoint&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiPgo_I0PzYAhWPa1AKHejNBLs4FBDoAQhMMAY}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The word ''Christ'' (and similar spellings) appears in English and in most European [[languages|language]]s. English-speakers now often use "Christ" as if it were a name, one part of the name "Jesus Christ", though it was originally a title ("the Messiah"). Its usage in "Christ Jesus" emphasizes its nature as a title.&lt;ref name=Pannenberg&gt;{{cite book|title= Jesus God and Man |first= Wolfhart |last= Pannenberg | authorlink= Wolfhart Pannenberg |year= 1968 |isbn= 0-664-24468-8 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zWfvlpURwiIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA30|pages= 30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Miriam &gt;{{cite book|title= Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions |first= Wendy |last= Doniger | authorlink= Wendy Doniger |year=2000 |isbn= 0-87779-044-2 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZP_f9icf2roC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA212|page= 212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compare the usage "the Christ".

The spelling ''Christ'' in English became [[standardization|standardized]] in the 18th century, when, in the spirit of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the spelling of certain words changed to fit their [[Greek language|Greek]] or [[Latin]] origins. Prior to this, scribes writing in [[Old English|Old]] and [[Middle English]] usually used the spelling ''Crist'' - the ''i'' being pronounced either as {{IPAc-en|iː}}, preserved in the names of churches such as [[St Katherine Cree]], or as a short {{IPAc-en|ɪ}}, preserved in the modern pronunciation of "[[Christmas]]". The spelling "Christ" in English is attested from the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Christ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern and ancient usage, even in secular terminology, "Christ" usually refers to Jesus, based on the centuries-old tradition of such usage. Since the [[Apostolic Age]], the&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] use of the definite article before the word Christ and its gradual development into a proper name show the Christians identified the bearer with the promised Messias of the Jews.&lt;ref name=CathencChrist&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Origin of the Name of Jesus Christ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the [[Ancient Greek]] text of the [[deuterocanonical books]], the term "Christ" (Χριστός, [[Romanization of Greek|translit.]] Christós) is found in [[2 Maccabees]] 1:10&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/2-Maccabees-Chapter-1_Original-1611-KJV/ | title = 1611 King James Bible, Second Book of Maccabees, chapter 1, verse 10 | website = kingjamesbibleonline.org | language = en | archive-url = | archive-date = | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.en.katabiblon.com/us/index.php?text=LXX&amp;book=2Mc&amp;ch=1&amp;interlin=on | title = Greek Septuagint and Wiki English Translation, Second Book of Maccabees, chapter 1 | website = katabiblon.com | language = en, gr | archive-url = | archive-date = | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; (referring to the [[High Priest of Israel#Consecration|anointed High Priest of Israel]]) and in the [[Sirach|Book of Sirach]] 46:19&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Ecclesiasticus-Chapter-46_Original-1611-KJV/ | title = 1611 King James Bible, Book of Sirach, chapter 46, verse 19 | website = kingjamesbibleonline.org | language = en | archive-url = | archive-date = | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://en.katabiblon.com/us/index.php?text=LXX&amp;book=Sir&amp;ch=46 | title = Greek Septuagint and Wiki English Translation, Book of Sirach, chapter 46 | website = katabiblon.com | language = en, gr | archive-url = | archive-date = | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in relation to [[Samuel#Biblical account#Calling|Samuel]], prophet and institutor of the kingdom under Saul.

==Background and New Testament references==
[[File:Sargis Pitsak.jpg|thumb|left|130px|First page of [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], by [[Sargis Pitsak]] (14th century): "''The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God''".]]

At the time of Jesus, there was no single form of [[Second Temple Judaism]], and there were significant political, social, and religious differences among the various Jewish groups.&lt;ref name=Ekstrand147 &gt;{{cite book|title=Christianity |first=Donald W. |last=Ekstrand |year=2008 |isbn=1-60477-929-2 |pages=147–150}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for centuries the Jews had used the term ''moshiach'' ("anointed") to refer to their expected deliverer.&lt;ref name= CathencChrist /&gt; A large number of Old Testament passages were regarded as [[Messiah|messianic]] by the Jews, many more than are commonly considered messianic by Christians, and different groups of Jews assigned varying degrees of significance to them.&lt;ref name=Ekstrand147 /&gt;

The Greek word ''messias'' appears only twice in the [[Septuagint]] of the promised prince ({{Bibleref2|Daniel|9:26}}; {{Bibleref2|Psalm|2:2}}). This title was used when a name was wanted for the promised one who was to be at once King and Savior.&lt;ref name= CathencMessiah &gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Messiah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kasper &gt;{{cite book|title=Jesus the Christ |first=Walter |last=Kasper | authorlink=Walter Kasper |year=1976 |isbn=0-8091-2081-X |pages=104–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New Testament]] states that the long-awaited messiah had come and describes this savior as "the Christ". In {{bibleref|Matt|16:16}}, the apostle Peter said, in what has become a famous proclamation of faith among Christians since the first century, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."&lt;ref name=Ekstrand147 /&gt;

[[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] {{bibleref2|Mark|1:1|KJV|1:1}} ("The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God") identifies Jesus as both Christ and the [[Son of God (Christianity)|Son of God]]. The divinity is re-affirmed in {{bibleref2|Mark|1:11|KJV}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity |first=Larry W. |last=Hurtado | authorlink=Larry Hurtado |year=2005 |isbn=0-8028-3167-2 |page=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, Mark never applies the term ''Christ'' to Jesus as a name. {{bibleref2|Matthew|1:1}} uses Christ as a name and [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] {{bibleref2|Matthew|1:16|4=1:16}} explains it again with: "Jesus, who is called Christ". In the [[Gospel of John]], Jesus referred to himself as the Son of God far more frequently than in the [[Synoptic Gospels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity |first=Larry W. |last=Hurtado | authorlink=Larry Hurtado |year=2005 |isbn=0-8028-3167-2 |pages=363–363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the definite article before the word "Christ" and its gradual development into a proper name show that the Christians identified Jesus with the promised messiah of the Jews who fulfilled all the [[Christian messianic prophecies|Messianic predictions]] in a fuller and a higher sense than had been given them by the [[rabbis]].&lt;ref name= CathencChrist /&gt;

The Gospels of Mark and Matthew begin by calling Jesus both Christ and the Son of God, but these are two distinct attributions. They develop in the New Testament along separate paths and have distinct theological implications. At the time in [[Roman Judaea]], the Jews had been awaiting the "Messiah", and many people were wondering who it would be. When John the Baptist appeared and began preaching, he attracted disciples who assumed that he would be announced as the messiah, or "the one" that they had been awaiting. 

In the three [[Synoptic Gospels]], the Baptism of Jesus is the first fact of the [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament#Ministry |public ministry of Jesus]] and the first instance explicitly claiming that He is  the Son of God, directly by [[God the Father]] and the descent of the Holy Spirit God, in aspect of a [[Doves as symbols#Christianity|dove]] upon Him: [[Mark 1|Mark, chapter 1]] (verses from 9 to 11)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Mark-Chapter-1_Original-1611-KJV |title= 1611 King James Bible, Gospel of Mark, Chapter 1 |language= en |year= 1611 |website= kingjamesbibleonline.org |archive-url= |archive-date= |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Matthew 3|Matthew, chapter 3]] (verses 15 to 17)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Matthew-Chapter-3_Original-1611-KJV |title= 1611 King James Bible, Gospel of Matthew, Chapter 3, vers 15 to 17 |year=1611 |website = kingjamesbibleonline.org |language= en |archive-url= |archive-date= |deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[Luke 3|Luke, chapter 3]] (vv. 15 to 17)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/1611_Luke-Chapter-3 | title = 1611 King James Bible, Gospel of Luke, Chapter 3, verses 15 to 17 | year = 1611 | website = kingjamesbibleonline.org | language = en | archive-url = | archive-date = | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Unlike Mark 1, the other two Synoptic Gospels don't refer the Baptism of Jesus in their first chapter. Nevertheless, [[Luke 1]] narrows the birth of John the Baptist, and chapter 3 of Matthew is titled as its ''first narrative section'' by some translations of the Bible&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.maranatha.it/Bibbia/5-VangeliAtti/49-LucaPage.htm | title = gospel of Mathew, chapter 3 | website = maranatha.it | language = it | access-date = Sep 28, 2018 | archive-url = | archive-date = | deadurl = no}}, [[Episcopal Conference of Italy]] official translation, published in 1974&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In the [[Gospel of John|Gospel of St. John the Apostle and Evangelist]] too, the first instance of Jesus being called the Son of God appears during [[Baptism of Jesus|his baptism]] by John the Baptist. In the narrative, a voice from heaven called Jesus "My Son". John the Baptist was in prison in the [[Messengers from John the Baptist]] episode ({{bibleref2|Matthew|11:2–6|NIV;KJV}} and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] {{bibleref2|Luke|7:18–23|KJV|7:18–23}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Gospel of Matthew |first=Rudolf |last=Schnackenburg |authorlink=Rudolf Schnackenburg |year=2002 |isbn=0-8028-4438-3 |page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two of his disciples ask Jesus a question on his behalf: "Are you the one to come after me or shall we wait for another?"&lt;ref name=mercer459&gt;{{cite book|title=Mercer dictionary of the Bible |first1=Watson E. |last1=Mills |first2=Roger Aubrey |last2=Bullard |year=1998 |isbn=0-86554-373-9 |page=459}}&lt;/ref&gt;—indicating that John doubted the identity of Jesus as Christ at that time (see also [[Rejection of Jesus]]).

In {{bibleref2|John|11:27|NIV;KJV}} Martha told Jesus, "you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming into the world", signifying that both titles were generally accepted (yet considered distinct) among the followers of Jesus before the [[raising of Lazarus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Christianity |first=Donald W. |last=Ekstrand |year=2008 |isbn=1-60477-929-2 |page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Explicit claims of Jesus being the messiah are found in the canonical gospels in the [[Confession of Peter]] (e.g. {{bibleref2|Matthew|16:16|9}}) and the words of Jesus before his judges at his [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus|trial before the Sanhedrin]].&lt;ref name= CathencMessiah /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Matthew|16:13–20}}, {{bibleref2|Mark|8:27–30|9}} and {{bibleref2|Luke|9:18–20|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These incidents involve far more than a mere Messianic claim; taken in their setting, they constitute a claim to be the Son of God.&lt;ref name= CathencMessiah /&gt;

In the trial of Jesus before the [[Sanhedrin]] and [[Pontius Pilate]], it might appear from the narratives of Matthew and Luke that Jesus at first refused a direct reply to the high priest's question: "Art thou the Christ?", where his answer is given merely as "''su eipas"'' ("thou hast said it"). The Gospel of Mark, however, states the answer as "''ego eimi"'' ("I am"), and there are instances from [[Jewish literature]] in which the expression "thou hast said it" is equivalent to "you are right".&lt;ref name= CathencMessiah /&gt; The Messianic claim was less significant than the claim to divinity, which caused the [[High Priest of Israel|high priest]]'s horrified accusation of [[blasphemy]] and the subsequent call for the death sentence. Before Pilate, on the other hand, it was merely the assertion of his [[Kingship and kingdom of God|royal]] dignity which gave grounds for his condemnation.&lt;ref name= CathencMessiah /&gt;

The word "Christ" is closely associated with Jesus in the [[Pauline epistles]], which suggests that there was no need for the [[early Christians]] to claim that Jesus is Christ because it was considered widely accepted among them. Hence [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] can use the term ''Khristós'' with no confusion as to whom it refers, and he can use expressions such as "in Christ" to refer to the followers of Jesus, as in {{bibleref2|1 Corinthians|4:15|KJV}} and {{bibleref2|Romans|12:5|KJV}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity |first=Larry W. |last=Hurtado | authorlink=Larry Hurtado |year=2005 |isbn=0-8028-3167-2 |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul proclaimed him as the [[Last Adam]], who restored through obedience what [[Adam]] lost through disobedience.&lt;ref name=Rahner731 &gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of theology: A concise Sacramentum mundi |first=Karl |last=Rahner |authorlink=Karl Rahner |year=2004 |isbn=0-86012-006-6 |pages=730–739}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pauline epistles are a source of some key Christological connections; e.g., {{bibleref2|Ephesians|3:17–19|9}} relates the [[love of Christ]] to the [[knowledge of Christ]], and considers the love of Christ as a necessity for knowing him.&lt;ref name=WBarc152&gt;{{cite book|title=The letters to the Galatians and Ephesians |first=William |last=Barclay | authorlink=William Barclay (theologian) |year=2002 |isbn=0-664-22559-4 |pages=152–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also implicit claims to him being the Christ in the words and actions of Jesus.&lt;ref name= CathencMessiah /&gt; Episodes in the life of Jesus and statements about what he accomplished during his public ministry are found throughout the [[New Testament]]. [[Trinitarianism]] summarily claims: "Jesus Christ was [[Hypostatic union|fully God and fully man]] in one [[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|person]], and will be so [[In saecula saeculorum|forever]]."&lt;ref name="Grudem"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grudem |first=Wayne A. | authorlink=Wayne Grudem |title=Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Biblical Doctrine |publisher=Zondervan |year=1994 |isbn=0-310-28670-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2DUPWk9ng3wC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=isbn%3A0310286700&amp;pg=PA529|chapter=The Person Of Christ |page=529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-existence, Incarnation and Nativity===
{{see also|Pre-existence of Christ|Logos (Christianity)|Nativity of Jesus}}
[[File:Sainte-marie Madeleine2.jpg|thumb|180px|The [[Anointing of Jesus]], c. 1450]]
There are distinct, and differing, views among Christians regarding the existence of Christ before his conception. A key passage in the New Testament is {{bibleverse||John|1:1–18|NIV}} where John 1:17 specifically mentions that "grace and truth came through Jesus Christ." Those who believe in the [[Trinity]], consider Christ a pre-existent divine [[Hypostatic union|hypostasis]] called the [[Logos]] or the [[Logos (Christianity)|Word]]. Other, non-Trinitarian views, question the aspect of personal pre-existence or question the aspect of divinity, or both. An example is the Orthodox Gnomic view, which asserts that Christ was, in fact, not a pre-existent divine being.

The concept of Christ as [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]] derives from {{bibleverse||John|1:1|NIV}}: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." In the original Greek, ''[[Logos]]'' (λόγος) is used for "Word," and is often used untranslated. In the [[Christology]] of the Logos, Christ is viewed as the Incarnation of the "Divine Logos", i.e. The Word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A theology primer |first=Robert C. |last=Neville |authorlink=Robert Cummings Neville |year=1991 |isbn=0-7914-0849-3 |page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2nd century, with his theory of "recapitulation", [[Irenaeus]] connected "Christ the Creator" with "Christ the Savior", relying on {{bibleverse||Ephesians|1:10|NIV}} ("when the times reach their fulfillment – to bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ") to gather together and ''wrap up'' the cycle of the Nativity and Resurrection of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Christ at the Center: The Early Christian Era |first=Lisa D.

In the 2nd century, [[Irenaeus]] expressed his views of salvation in terms of the imitation of Christ and his theory of "recapitulation". For Irenaeus the imitation of Christ is based on God's plan of salvation, which involved Christ as the "[[Last Adam]]"&lt;ref&gt;Watson E. Mills, Roger Aubrey Bullard, eds, ''Mercer dictionary of the Bible''. 1998, p. 10. {{ISBN|0-86554-373-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[James D. G. Dunn|Dunn, James D. G.]] (2006) ''The Theology of Paul the Apostle''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=NHFfHulVTNMC&amp;pg=PA241 p. 241]. {{ISBN|0802844235}}&lt;/ref&gt; He viewed the incarnation as the way in which Christ repaired the damage done by Adam's disobedience. For Irenaeus, salvation was achieved by Christ restoring humanity to the image of God, and he saw the Christian imitation of Christ as a key component on the path to salvation.&lt;ref name=McKim &gt;{{cite book|title=Theological turning points: Major issues in Christian thought |first=Donald K. |last=McKim |year=1989 |isbn=0-8042-0702-X |page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Irenaeus Christ succeeded on every point on which Adam failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Christ at the Center: The Early Christian Era |first=Lisa D. Maugans |last=Driver|year=2009 |isbn=0-664-22897-6  |page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irenaeus drew a number of parallels, e.g. just as in the fall of Adam resulted from the fruit of a tree, Irenaeus saw redemption and salvation as the fruit of another tree: the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|cross of crucifixion]].&lt;ref name=McKim /&gt;

Following in the [[Pauline Christianity|Pauline tradition]], in the 5th century [[Augustine of Hippo]] viewed Christ as the mediator of the [[New Covenant]] between God and man and as the conqueror over sin. He viewed Christ as the cause and reason for the reconciliation of man with God after the fall of Adam, and he saw in Christ the path to Christian salvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Theological turning points: Major issues in Christian thought |first=Donald K. |last=McKim |year=1989 |isbn=0-8042-0702-X |pages=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine believed that salvation is available to those who are worthy of it, through faith in Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An introduction to the theology of religions|first=Veli-Matti |last=Kärkkäinen| author-link = Veli-Matti Kärkkäinen |year=2003 |isbn=0-8308-2572-X |page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 13th century [[Thomas Aquinas]] aimed to recapture the teachings of the [[Church Fathers]] on the role of the [[Holy Trinity]] in the economy of salvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Trinitarian Theology of Saint Thomas Aquinas |first1=Gilles |last1=Emery |first2=Francesca Aran |last2=Murphy |year=2010 |isbn=0-19-958221-1 |pages=13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Aquinas' view [[angels]] and humans were created for salvation from the very beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thomas Aquinas' trinitarian theology: A study in theological method |first=Timothy Lee |last=Smith |isbn=978-0-8132-1097-1 |publisher=CUA Press |year=2003 |pages=17–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Aquinas the [[Passion of Christ]] poured out the grace of salvation and all its virtues unto humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 5 |first=Erwin |last=Fahlbusch |year=2008 |isbn=0-8028-2417-X |page=490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Luther]] distinguished the history of salvation [[Law and Gospel|between the Old and the New Testament]], and saw a new dimension to salvation with the arrival of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Systematic Theology, Volume 3 |first=Wolfhart |last=Pannenberg | authorlink=Wolfhart Pannenberg |year=2004 |isbn=0-567-08068-4 |page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus on human history was an important element of the biblically grounded 16th-century theology of [[John Calvin]]. Calvin considered the [[Ministry of Jesus|first coming of Christ]] as the key turning point in human history. He viewed Christ as "the one through whom salvation began" and he saw the completion of Christ's plan of salvation as his death and [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]].&lt;ref name=McKim161 &gt;{{cite book|title=Theological turning points: Major issues in Christian thought |first=Donald K. |last=McKim |year=1989 |isbn=0-8042-0702-X |page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Simple Labarum2.svg|thumb|80px|The ''[[Chi-Rho]]'']]
The use of "Χ", derived from Chi, the [[Greek alphabet]] initial, as an abbreviation for Christ (most commonly in the abbreviation "[[Χmas]]") is often misinterpreted as a modern secularization of the term. Thus understood, the centuries-old English word Χmas, is actually a shortened form of CHmas, which is, itself, a shortened form for Christmas. Christians are sometimes referred to as "Xians", with the 'X' replacing 'Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very early Christogram is the ''[[Chi Rho]]'' symbol formed by superimposing the first two Greek letters in Christ ({{lang|grc|"Χριστός"}}), [[chi (letter)|chi]] = ch and [[rho (letter)|rho]] = r, to produce &lt;big&gt;☧&lt;/big&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Symbols of the Christian faith |first=Alva William |last=Steffler |year=2002 |isbn=0-8028-4676-9 |page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saint Fragan''' was a [[5th-century]] [[Pre-Congregational Saint]] and [[Prince]] of [[Scotland]].
He is celebrated on 3 October in the Calendar of the Breton Saints,&lt;ref name="grandterrier"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grandterrier.net/wiki/index.php?title=Mod%C3%A8le:Almanak_Octobre|title=Modèle:Almanak octobre|website=GrandTerrier|accessdate=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and shares with Gwen a [[Feast day]] on July 5 in the Roman Calendar.

Fragan came from Great Britain, and was a Prince of Albany in Scotland. In the 5th century he left Scotland to evangelize [[Armorica]].

{{Status of religious freedom|expanded=all}}

'''Freedom of religion''' is a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or community, in public or private, to manifest religion or [[belief]] in teaching, practice, [[worship]], and observance. It also includes the freedom to change one's religion or beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights|publisher=The United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom of religion is considered by many people and most of the nations to be a [[fundamental rights|fundamental]] [[human right]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usinfo.state.gov/dd/eng_democracy_dialogues/religion/religion_essay.html|title=The Evolution of Religious Liberty as a Universal Human Right|accessdate=5 December 2006|last=Davis|first=Derek H.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201105738/http://usinfo.state.gov/dd/eng_democracy_dialogues/religion/religion_essay.html|archivedate=1 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ANDmIIpAmwC&amp;pg=PA29734|title=Congressional Record #29734 – 19 November 2003|publisher=Google Books|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a country with a [[state religion]], freedom of religion is generally considered to mean that the government permits religious practices of other sects besides the state religion, and does not [[religious persecution|persecute]] believers in other faiths.
Freedom of belief is different. It allows the right to believe what a person, group or religion wishes, but it does not necessarily allow the right to practice the religion or belief openly and outwardly in a public manner.

==History==
{{Cite check|section|date=September 2010}}
[[File:Minerva als Symbol der Toleranz.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Minerva]] as a symbol of enlightened wisdom protects the believers of all religions ([[Daniel Chodowiecki]], 1791)]]
Historically, ''freedom of religion'' has been used to refer to the tolerance of different theological systems of belief, while ''freedom of worship'' has been defined as freedom of individual action. Nevertheless, freedom ''from'' religion is a far more pressing moralistic, legal, and peaceful solution.  Each of these have existed to varying degrees. While many countries have accepted some form of religious freedom, this has also often been limited in practice through punitive taxation, repressive social legislation, and political disenfranchisement. Compare examples of individual freedom in Italy or the Muslim tradition of [[dhimmi]]s, literally "protected individuals" professing an officially tolerated non-Muslim religion.

[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'' (1789) guarantees freedom of religion, as long as religious activities do not infringe on public order in ways detrimental to society.]]
In [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]], a [[syncretism|syncretic]] point of view often allowed communities of traders to operate under their own customs. When street mobs of separate quarters clashed in a [[Hellenistic]] or [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city, the issue was generally perceived to be an infringement of community rights.

[[Cyrus the Great]] established the [[Achaemenid Empire]] ca. 550 BC, and initiated a general policy of permitting religious freedom throughout the empire, documenting this on the [[Cyrus Cylinder]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/ct-cz/cyrus_I/cyrus_cylinder.html Cyrus Cylinder], [http://www.livius.org/ livius.org].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Richard A. Taylor|author2=E. Ray Clendenen|title=Haggai, Malachi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hII6mqKrH9kC|date=15 October 2004|publisher=B&amp;H Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8054-0121-9|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hII6mqKrH9kC&amp;pg=PA31 31–32]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the historical exceptions have been in regions where one of the revealed religions has been in a position of power: Judaism, [[Zoroastrianism]], Christianity and Islam. Others have been where the established order has felt threatened, as shown in the [[trial of Socrates]] in 399 BC or where the ruler has been deified, as in Rome, and refusal to offer token [[sacrifice]] was similar to refusing to take an [[oath of allegiance]]. This was the core for resentment and the [[Persecution of Christians|persecution of early Christian communities]].

Freedom of religious worship was established in the Buddhist [[Maurya Empire]] of [[History of India|ancient India]] by [[Ashoka the Great]] in the 3rd century BC, which was encapsulated in the [[Edicts of Ashoka]].

Greek-Jewish clashes at [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] in 73 AD and 117 AD and in [[Alexandria]] in 115 AD provide examples of cosmopolitan cities as scenes of tumult.

The Romans tolerated most religions, including [[Judaism]] and encouraged local subjects to continue worshipping their own gods. They did not however, tolerate [[Christianity]] until it was legalised by the Roman emperor [[Galerius]] in 311. The [[Edict of Milan]] guaranteed freedom of religion in the Roman Empire until the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] in 380, which outlawed all religions except Christianity.

===Muslim world===
Following a period of fighting lasting around a hundred years before 620 AD which mainly involved Arab and Jewish inhabitants of [[Medina]] (then known as ''Yathrib''), religious freedom for Muslims, Jews and [[Paganism|pagans]] was declared by [[Muhammad]] in the [[Constitution of Medina]]. The Islamic [[Caliphate]] later guaranteed religious freedom under the conditions that non-Muslim communities accept ''[[dhimmi]]'' status and their adult males pay the punitive ''[[jizya]]'' tax instead of the ''[[zakat]]'' paid by Muslim citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Njeuma|first=Martin Z.|title=Fulani Hegemony in Yola (Old Adamawa) 1809-1902|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dfQA4Q6fX7EC&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;ots=8pyCFSKL0V&amp;dq=Fulani%20Hegemony%20in%20Yola%20(Old%20Adamawa)%201809-1902&amp;hl=fi&amp;pg=PA82#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2012|publisher=African Books Collective|isbn=978-9956-726-95-0|page=82|quote=Of all the various forms of taxation known to Islamic communities, it seems only two{{snd}} the zakat and the jixya were of importance in Adamawa. [...] The jizya was the levy on non-Muslim peoples who surrendered to Islam and were given the status dhimmi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Dhimmis were not given the same political rights as Muslims, they nevertheless did enjoy equality under the laws of property, contract, and obligation.&lt;ref&gt;H. Patrick Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World''. [[Oxford University Press]], 2007, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The French scholar Gustave Le Bon (the author of ''La civilisation des Arabes'') writes "that despite the fact that the incidence of taxation fell more heavily on a Muslim than a non-Muslim, the non-Muslim was free to enjoy equally well with every Muslim all the privileges afforded to the citizens of the state. The only privilege that was reserved for the Muslims was the seat of the caliphate, and this, because of certain religious functions attached to it, which could not naturally be discharged by a non-Muslim." Mun'im Sirry (2014), ''Scriptural Polemics: The Qur'an and Other Religions'', p.179. [[Oxford University Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0199359363}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abou El Fadl|first1=Khaled|authorlink=Khaled Abou El Fadl|title=The Great Theft: Wrestling Islam from the Extremists|date=2007|publisher=[[HarperOne]]|isbn=978-0061189036|page=204|quote = According the dhimma status system, non-Muslims must pay a poll tax in return for Muslim protection and the privilege of living in Muslim territory. Per this system, non-Muslims are exempt from military service, but they are excluded from occupying high positions that involve dealing with high state interests, like being the president or prime minister of the country. In Islamic history, non-Muslims did occupy high positions, especially in matters that related to fiscal policies or tax collection.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Religious pluralism]] existed in classical [[Islamic ethics]] and [[Sharia]], as the [[religious law]]s and courts of other religions, including Christianity, Judaism and [[Hinduism]], were usually accommodated within the Islamic legal framework, as seen in the early [[Caliphate]], [[Al-Andalus]], [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Indian subcontinent]], and the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman Millet]] system.&lt;ref name=Weeramantry-138&gt;{{cite book|last=Weeramantry|first=C.

According to the famous Islamic legal scholar [[Ibn Qayyim]] (1292–1350), non-Muslims had the right to engage in such religious practices even if it offended Muslims, under the conditions that such cases not be presented to Islamic Sharia courts and that these religious minorities believed that the practice in question is permissible according to their religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Islam and the Blackamerican: looking toward the third resurrection|author=Sherman A.

{{Main article|Freedom of religion in India}}
Ancient Jews fleeing from persecution in their homeland 2,500 years ago settled in India and never faced [[anti-Semitism]].&lt;ref&gt;Who are the Jews of India? – The S. Mark Taper Foundation imprint in Jewish studies. University of California Press. 2000. p. 26. {{ISBN|978-0-520-21323-4}}. https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWX6pF2PTJwC&amp;pg=PA26.; "When the Portuguese arrived in 1498, they brought a spirit of intolerance utterly alien to India. They soon established an Office of Inquisition at Goa, and at their hands Indian Jews experienced the only instance of anti-Semitism ever to occur in Indian soil."&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom of religion [[edicts]] have been found written during [[Ashoka the Great]]'s reign in the 3rd century BC. Freedom to practise, preach and propagate any religion is a constitutional right in Modern India. Most major religious festivals of the main communities are included in the list of national holidays.

Although India is an 80% [[Hindu]] country, India is a secular state without any [[state religion]]s.

Many scholars and intellectuals believe that India's predominant religion, [[Hinduism]], has long been a most tolerant religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David E. Ludden|title=Contesting the Nation: Religion, Community, and the Politics of Democracy in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEUdPqYQjhoC|year=1996|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-1585-0|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jEUdPqYQjhoC&amp;pg=257 257–58]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rajni Kothari]], founder of the [[Centre for the Study of Developing Societies]] has written, "[India] is a country built on the foundations of a civilisation that is fundamentally non-religious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rajni Kothari|title=Communalism in Indian Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ruNtAAAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Rainbow Publishers|isbn=978-81-86962-00-8|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ruNtAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=%22foundations+of+a+civilisation+that+is+fundamentally+non–religious%22 134]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dalai Lama]], the Tibetan leader in exile, said that religious tolerance of 'Aryabhoomi,' a reference to India found in the [[Mahabharata]], has been in existence in this country from thousands of years. "Not only Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, Sikhism which are the native religions but also Christianity and Islam have flourished here. Religious tolerance is inherent in Indian tradition," the Dalai Lama said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/42229/indias-religious-tolerance-lauded.html|title=India's religious tolerance lauded|work=Deccan Herald|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom of religion in the [[Indian subcontinent]] is exemplified by the reign of King Piyadasi (304–232 BC) ([[Ashoka]]). One of King Ashoka's main concerns was to reform governmental institutes and exercise moral principles in his attempt to create a [[Edicts of Ashoka|just and humane society]]. Later he promoted the principles of [[Buddhism]], and the creation of a just, understanding and fair society was held as an important principle for many ancient rulers of this time in the East.

The importance of freedom of worship in India was encapsulated in an inscription of [[Ashoka]]:
{{Quote|King Piyadasi (Ashok) dear to the Gods, honours all sects, the ascetics (hermits) or those who dwell at home, he honours them with charity and in other ways. But the King, dear to the Gods, attributes less importance to this charity and these honours than to the vow of seeing the reign of virtues, which constitutes the essential part of them. For all these virtues there is a common source, modesty of speech. That is to say, one must not exalt one's creed discrediting all others, nor must one degrade these others without legitimate reasons. One must, on the contrary, render to other creeds the honour befitting them.}} 

On the main Asian continent, the Mongols were tolerant of religions. People could worship as they wished freely and openly.

After the arrival of Europeans, Christians in their zeal to convert local as per belief in conversion as service of God, have also been seen to fall into frivolous methods since their arrival, though by and large there are hardly any reports of law and order disturbance from mobs with Christian beliefs, except perhaps in the north eastern region of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stephen-knapp.com/christian_persecution_in_india.htm|title=Christian Persecution in India: The Real Story|publisher=Stephen-knapp.com|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom of religion in contemporary India is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 25 of the nation's constitution. Accordingly, every citizen of India has a right to profess, practice and propagate their religions peacefully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf |title=The Constitution of India |format=PDF |accessdate=3 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909230437/http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf |archivedate=9 September 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad]] counters this argument by saying that [[evangelical]] Christians are forcefully (or through money) converting rural, illiterate populations and they are only trying to stop this.

In September 2010, the Indian state of [[Kerala]]'s State Election Commissioner announced that "Religious heads cannot issue calls to vote for members of a particular community or to defeat the nonbelievers".&lt;ref name="orthodoxherald.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.orthodoxherald.com/2010/09/18/%E2%80%98using-places-of-worship-for-campaigning-in-kerala-civic-polls-is-violation-of-poll-code%E2%80%99/|title='Using places of worship for campaigning in Kerala civic polls is violation of poll code'|newspaper=Indian Orthodox Herald|date=18 September 2010|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church comprising Latin, Syro-Malabar and Syro-Malankara rites used to give clear directions to the faithful on exercising their franchise during elections through pastoral letters issued by bishops or council of bishops. The pastoral letter issued by Kerala Catholic Bishops' Council (KCBC) on the eve of the poll urged the faithful to shun atheists.&lt;ref name="orthodoxherald.com"/&gt;

Even today, most Indians celebrate all religious festivals with equal enthusiasm and respect. [[Hindu]] festivals like [[Deepavali]] and [[Holi]], Muslim festivals like [[Eid al-Fitr]], [[Eid-Ul-Adha]], [[Muharram]], Christian festivals like Christmas and other festivals like [[Buddha Purnima]], [[Mahavir Jayanti]], Gur Purab etc. are celebrated and enjoyed by all [[Indian people|Indians]].

===Europe===

====Religious intolerance====
[[File:CONGRESS COLUMN-BRUSSELS-Dr. Murali Mohan Gurram (13).jpg|thumb|right|Nineteenth century allegorical statue on the [[Congress Column]] in Belgium depicting religious freedom]]
Most Roman Catholic kingdoms kept a tight rein on religious expression throughout the [[Middle Ages]]. Jews were alternately tolerated and persecuted, the most notable examples of the latter being the expulsion of all [[History of the Jews in Spain|Jews]] from Spain in 1492. Some of those who remained and converted were tried as heretics in the [[Inquisition]] for allegedly practicing Judaism in secret. Despite the persecution of Jews, they were the most tolerated non-Catholic faith in Europe.

However, the latter was in part a reaction to the growing movement that became the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. As early as 1380, [[John Wycliffe]] in England denied [[transubstantiation]] and began his translation of the Bible into English. He was condemned in a [[Papal Bull]] in 1410, and all his books were burned.

In 1414, [[Jan Hus]], a [[Bohemia]]n preacher of reformation, was given a safe conduct by the Holy Roman Emperor to attend the [[Council of Constance]]. Not entirely trusting in his safety, he made his will before he left. His forebodings proved accurate, and he was burned at the stake on 6 July 1415. The Council also decreed that Wycliffe's remains be disinterred and cast out. This decree was not carried out until 1429.

After the fall of the city of [[Granada]], Spain, in 1492, the Muslim population was promised religious freedom by the [[Treaty of Granada]], but that promise was short-lived. In 1501, Granada's Muslims were given an ultimatum to either convert to Christianity or to emigrate. The majority converted, but only superficially, continuing to dress and speak as they had before and to secretly practice Islam. The [[Morisco]]s (converts to Christianity) were ultimately expelled from Spain between 1609 (Castile) and 1614 (rest of Spain), by [[Philip III of Spain#Expulsion of the Moors (1609–1610)|Philip III]].

[[Martin Luther]] published his famous 95 Theses in [[Wittenberg]] on 31 October 1517. His major aim was theological, summed up in the three basic dogmas of Protestantism:

* The Bible only is infallible.
* Every Christian can interpret it.
* Human sins are so wrongful that no deed or merit, only God's grace, can lead to salvation.

In consequence, Luther hoped to stop the sale of [[indulgence]]s and to reform the Church from within. In 1521, he was given the chance to recant at the [[Diet of Worms]] before [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]]. After he refused to recant, he was declared heretic. Partly for his own protection, he was sequestered on the [[Wartburg]] in the possessions of [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony]], where he translated the [[New Testament]] into German. He was excommunicated by Papal Bull in 1521.

However, the movement continued to gain ground in his absence and spread to Switzerland. [[Huldrych Zwingli]] preached reform in [[Zürich]] from 1520 to 1523. He opposed the sale of indulgences, celibacy, pilgrimages, pictures, statues, relics, altars, and organs. This culminated in outright war between the Swiss [[cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] that accepted Protestantism and the Catholics. The Catholics were victorious, and Zwingli was killed in battle in 1531. The Catholic cantons were magnanimous in victory.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The defiance of Papal authority proved contagious, and in 1533, when [[Henry VIII of England]] was excommunicated for his divorce and remarriage to Anne Boleyn, he promptly established a state church with bishops appointed by the crown. This was not without internal opposition, and [[Thomas More]], who had been his Lord Chancellor, was executed in 1535 for opposition to Henry.

In 1535, the Swiss canton of Geneva became Protestant. In 1536, the [[Bern]]ese imposed the reformation on the canton of [[Vaud]] by conquest. They sacked the cathedral in [[Lausanne]] and destroyed all its art and statuary. [[John Calvin]], who had been active in Geneva was expelled in 1538 in a power struggle, but he was invited back in 1540.

[[File:ReligiousFreedomStamp.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|A U.S. postage stamp commemorating religious freedom and the [[Flushing Remonstrance]] ]]
The same kind of seesaw back and forth between Protestantism and Catholicism was evident in England when [[Mary I of England]] returned that country briefly to the Catholic fold in 1553 and persecuted Protestants. However, her half-sister, [[Elizabeth I of England]] was to restore the [[Church of England]] in 1558, this time permanently, and began to persecute Catholics again. The [[King James Bible]] commissioned by King [[James I of England]] and published in 1611 proved a landmark for Protestant worship, with official Catholic forms of worship being banned.

In France, although peace was made between Protestants and Catholics at the [[Treaty of Saint Germain]] in 1570, persecution continued, most notably in the [[Massacre of Saint Bartholomew's Day]] on 24 August 1572, in which thousands of Protestants throughout France were killed. A few years before, at the "Michelade" of Nîmes in 1567, Protestants had massacred the local Catholic clergy.

====Early steps and attempts in the way of tolerance====

Bohemia (present-day Czech Republic) enjoyed religious freedom between 1436 and 1520, and became one of the most liberal countries of the Christian world during that period of time. The so-called Basel Compacts of 1436 declared the freedom of religion and peace between Catholics and [[Utraquism|Utraquists]]. In 1609 Emperor Rudolf II granted Bohemia greater religious liberty with his Letter of Majesty. The privileged position of the Catholic Church in the Czech kingdom was firmly established after the [[Battle of White Mountain]] in 1620. Gradually freedom of religion in Bohemian lands came to an end and Protestants fled or were expelled from the country. A devout Catholic, Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] forcibly converted Austrian and Bohemian Protestants.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In the meantime, in Germany [[Philip Melanchthon]] drafted the [[Augsburg Confession]] as a common confession for the Lutherans and the free territories. It was presented to Charles V in 1530.

In the [[Holy Roman Empire]], Charles V agreed to tolerate Lutheranism in 1555 at the [[Peace of Augsburg]]. Each state was to take the religion of its prince, but within those states, there was not necessarily religious tolerance. Citizens of other faiths could relocate to a more hospitable environment.

In France, from the 1550s, many attempts to reconcile Catholics and Protestants and to establish tolerance failed because the State was too weak to enforce them. It took the victory of prince Henry IV of France, who had converted into Protestantism, and his accession to the throne, to impose religious tolerance formalized in the [[Edict of Nantes]] in 1598. It would remain in force for over 80 years until its revocation in 1685 by [[Louis XIV of France]]. Intolerance remained the norm until Louis XVI, who signed the Edict of Versailles (1787), then the constitutional text of 24 December 1789, granting civilian rights to Protestants. The [[French Revolution]] then abolished state religion and confiscated all Church property, turning intolerance against Catholics.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Early laws and legal guarantees for religious freedom===

====Principality of Transylvania====
In 1558, the Transylvanian Diet's [[Edict of Torda]] declared free practice of both Catholicism and Lutheranism. Calvinism, however, was prohibited. Calvinism was included among the accepted religions in 1564. Ten years after the first law, in 1568, the same Diet, under the chairmanship of [[List of Hungarian monarchs|King of Hungary]], and [[List of Princes of Transylvania|Prince of Transylvania]] [[John Sigismund Zápolya]] (John II.),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/103.html|title=History of Transylvania.

However, it was more than a religious tolerance; it declared the equality of the religions, prohibiting all kinds of acts from authorities or from simple people, which could harm other groups or people because of their religious beliefs. The emergence in social hierarchy wasn't dependent on the religion of the person thus Transylvania had also Catholic and Protestant monarchs, who all respected the Edict of Torda. The lack of state religion was unique for centuries in Europe. Therefore, the Edict of Torda is considered as the first legal guarantee of religious freedom in Christian Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lightbringers.net/content/story-francis-david-and-king-john-sigismund-establishment-transylvanian-unitarian-church|title=The Story of Francis David and King John Sigismund: The Establishment of the Transylvanian Unitarian Church|work=Lightbringers|accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four religions ([[Catholicism]], [[Lutheranism]], [[Calvinism]], [[Unitarianism]]) were named as accepted religions (religo recepta), having their representatives in the Transylvanian Diet, while the other religions, like the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodoxs]], [[Sabbatarians]] and [[Anabaptists]] were tolerated churches (religio tolerata), which meant that they had no power in the law making and no veto rights in the Diet, but they were not persecuted in any way. Thanks to the Edict of Torda, from the last decades of the 16th Century Transylvania was the only place in Europe, where so many religions could live together in harmony and without persecution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mult-kor.hu/20051125_erdely_es_a_habsburg_vallaspolitika_a_17_szazad_utolso_evtizedeiben "Kovács Kálmán: Erdély és a Habsburg valláspolitika a 17. század utolsó évtizedeiben"] ''Mult-Kor'' (25 November 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

After this year the [[Szekler Sabbatarians|Sabbatarians]] begun to be persecuted, and forced to convert to one of the accepted religions of Transylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/192.html|title=History of Transylvania.

=====Habsburg rule in Transylvania=====
Also the Unitarians (despite of being one of the "accepted religions") started to be put under an ever-growing pressure, which culminated after the Habsburg conquest of Transylvania (1691),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/290.html|title=History of Transylvania.

====Netherlands====
In the [[Union of Utrecht]] (20 January 1579), personal freedom of religion was declared in the struggle between the Northern Netherlands and Spain. The Union of Utrecht was an important step in the establishment of the Dutch Republic (from 1581 to 1795). Under Calvinist leadership, the Netherlands became the most tolerant country in Europe. It granted asylum to persecuted religious minorities, such as the Huguenots, the Dissenters, and the Jews who had been expelled from Spain and Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Heussi, ''Kompendium der Kirchengeschichte'', 11. Auflage (1956), Tübingen (Germany), pp. 396–97&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of a Jewish community in the Netherlands and New Amsterdam (present-day New York) during the Dutch Republic is an example of religious freedom. When New Amsterdam surrendered to the English in 1664, freedom of religion was guaranteed in the Articles of Capitulation. It benefitted also the Jews who had landed on Manhattan Island in 1654, fleeing Portuguese persecution in Brazil. During the 18th century, other Jewish communities were established at Newport, Rhode Island, Philadelphia, Charleston, Savannah, and Richmond.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton E. Olmstead (1960), ''History of Religion in the United States'', Prentice-Hall, Englewood Ciffs, N.J., p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

Intolerance of dissident forms of Protestantism also continued, as evidenced by the exodus of the Pilgrims, who sought refuge, first in the Netherlands, and ultimately in America, founding [[Plymouth Colony]] in Massachusetts in 1620. [[William Penn]], the founder of Philadelphia, was involved in a case which had a profound effect upon future American laws and those of England. In a classic case of jury nullification, the jury refused to convict William Penn of preaching a Quaker sermon, which was illegal. Even though the jury was imprisoned for their acquittal, they stood by their decision and helped establish the freedom of religion.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The statute served as the basis for the legal position of Jews in Poland and led to the creation of the [[Yiddish]]-speaking autonomous Jewish nation until 1795. The statute granted exclusive jurisdiction of Jewish courts over Jewish matters and established a separate tribunal for matters involving Christians and Jews. Additionally, it guaranteed personal liberties and safety for Jews including freedom of religion, travel, and trade. The statute was ratified by subsequent Polish Kings: [[Casimir III of Poland]] in 1334, [[Casimir IV of Poland]] in 1453 and [[Sigismund I the Old|Sigismund I of Poland]] in 1539. Poland freed Jews from direct royal authority, opening up enormous administrative and economic opportunities to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sinkoff|first=Nancy|title=Out of the Shtetl: Making Jews Modern in the Polish Borderlands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f-KmeZgY2hIC|year=2003|publisher=Society of Biblical Lit|isbn=978-1-930675-16-2|page=[https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=f–KmeZgY2hIC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=1539 18]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth====
{{Main article|Warsaw Confederation}}
The right to worship freely was a basic right given to all inhabitants of the future [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] throughout the 15th and early 16th century, however, complete freedom of religion was officially recognized in 1573 during the Warsaw Confederation. Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth kept religious freedom laws during an era when religious persecution was an everyday occurrence in the rest of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Zamoyski, Adam. ''The Polish Way''.

Most of the early colonies were generally not tolerant of dissident forms of worship, with Maryland being one of the exceptions. For example, [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] found it necessary to found a new colony in [[Rhode Island]] to escape persecution in the theocratically dominated colony of Massachusetts. The [[Puritans]] of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] were the most active of the New England persecutors of [[Quakers]], and the persecuting spirit was shared by [[Plymouth Colony]] and the colonies along the [[Connecticut river]].&lt;ref name=PER/&gt; In 1660, one of the most notable victims of the religious intolerance was English Quaker [[Mary Dyer]], who was hanged in Boston, Massachusetts for repeatedly defying a Puritan law banning Quakers from the colony.&lt;ref name=PER&gt;Rogers, Horatio, 2009.

Freedom of religion was first applied as a principle of government in the founding of the colony of Maryland, founded by the Catholic [[Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore|Lord Baltimore]], in 1634.&lt;ref name="Symbol of Enduring Freedom"&gt;Zimmerman, Mark, [http://issuu.com/columbia-magazine/docs/columbiamar10en?mode=embed&amp;layout=http%3A%2F%2Fskin.issuu.com%2Fv%2Flight%2Flayout.xml&amp;showFlipBtn=true Symbol of Enduring Freedom], p. 19, Columbia Magazine, March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen years later (1649), the [[Maryland Toleration Act]], drafted by Lord Baltimore, provided: "No person or persons...shall from henceforth be any waies troubled, molested or discountenanced for or in respect of his or her religion nor in the free exercise thereof." The Act allowed freedom of worship for all [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] Christians in Maryland, but [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]] anyone who denied the divinity of [[Jesus]]. The Maryland Toleration Act was repealed during the Cromwellian Era with the assistance of Protestant assemblymen and a new law barring Catholics from openly practicing their religion was passed.&lt;ref&gt;Brugger, Robert J.

It was the inseparable connection between democracy, religious freedom, and the other forms of freedom which became the political and legal basis of the new nation. In particular, [[Baptists]] and [[Presbyterians]] demanded the disestablishment of state churches{{snd}} [[Anglican]] and [[Congregationalist]]{{snd}} and the protection of religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Middlekauff]] (2005), ''The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763–1789'', Revised and Expanded Edition, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-531588-2}}, p. 635&lt;/ref&gt;

Reiterating Maryland's and the other colonies' earlier colonial legislation, the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]], written in 1779 by [[Thomas Jefferson]], proclaimed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[N]o man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer, on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Those sentiments also found expression in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the national constitution, part of the United States' [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof..."

The United States formally considers religious freedom in its foreign relations. The [[International Religious Freedom Act of 1998]] established the [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]] which investigates the records of over 200 other nations with respect to religious freedom, and makes recommendations to submit nations with egregious records to ongoing scrutiny and possible economic sanctions. Many human rights organizations have urged the United States to be still more vigorous in imposing sanctions on countries that do not permit or tolerate religious freedom.

===Canada===
{{Further information|Freedom of religion in Canada}}
Freedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right, allowing believers the freedom to assemble and worship without limitation or interference. Canadian law goes further, requiring that private citizens and companies provide [[reasonable accommodation]] to those, for example, with strong religious beliefs. The [[Canadian Human Rights Act]] allows an exception to reasonable accommodation with respect to religious dress, such as a [[Sikh]] [[turban]], when there is a ''[[bona fide]]'' occupational requirement, such as a workplace requiring a [[hard hat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/ResearchPublications/2011-60-e.htm#a6 Freedom of Religion and Religious Symbols in the Public Sphere. 2.2.2 Headcoverings].

===International===
On 25 November 1981, the United Nations General Assembly passed the [[Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief]]. This declaration recognizes freedom of religion as a fundamental human right in accordance with several other instruments of international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/36/a36r055.htm|title=A/RES/36/55.

However, the most substantial binding legal instruments that guarantee the right to freedom of religion that was passed by the international community is the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] which states in its Article 14: ''"States Parties shall respect the right of the child to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.{{snd}} States Parties shall respect the rights and duties of the parents and, when applicable, legal guardians, to provide direction to the child in the exercise of his or her right in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child.{{snd}} Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs may be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety, order, health or morals, or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/most/rr2int.htm Religious Rights – International Legal Instruments]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs===
In 1993, the UN's human rights committee declared that article 18 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] "protects theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs, as well as the right not to profess any religion or belief."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/453883fb22.html|title=CCPR General Comment 22: 30/07/93 on ICCPR Article 18|work=Minorityrights.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee further stated that "the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief necessarily entails the freedom to choose a religion or belief, including the right to replace one's current religion or belief with another or to adopt atheistic views." Signatories to the convention are barred from "the use of threat of physical force or penal sanctions to compel believers or non-believers" to recant their beliefs or convert. Despite this, minority religions still are persecuted in many parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=1 August 2003|title=Discrimination against religious minorities in Iran|author=International Federation for Human Rights|publisher=fdih.org|accessdate=3 March 2009|url=http://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/ir0108a.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law2.byu.edu/lawreview/archives/2002/2/dav2.pdf |title=The Evolution of Religious Liberty as a Universal Human Right |accessdate=3 March 2009 |last=Davis |first=Derek H. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723210828/http://www.law2.byu.edu/lawreview/archives/2002/2/dav2.pdf |archivedate=23 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberal secular===
[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Adam Smith]] argued in favour of freedom of religion.|alt=A man posing for a print]]
The French philosopher [[Voltaire]] noted in his book on English society, ''[[Letters on the English]]'', that freedom of religion in a diverse society was deeply important to maintaining peace in that country.  That it was also important in understanding why England at that time was more prosperous in comparison to the country's less religiously tolerant European neighbours. &lt;blockquote&gt;If one religion only were allowed in England, the Government would very possibly become arbitrary; if there were but two, the people would cut one another’s throats; but as there are such a multitude, they all live happy and in peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/34/2/6.html|title=Letter VI – On the Presbyterians.

So long as there are enough different religions and/or religious sects operating freely in a society then they are all compelled to moderate their more controversial and violent teachings, so as to be more appealing to more people and so have an easier time attracting new converts. It is this [[free competition]] amongst religious sects for converts that ensures stability and tranquillity in the long run.

Smith also points out that laws that prevent religious freedom and seek to preserve the power and belief in a particular religion will, in the long run, only serve to weaken and corrupt that religion, as its leaders and preachers become complacent, disconnected and unpractised in their ability to seek and win over new converts:&lt;ref name="Smith1"&gt;Smith, Adam (1776), [http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adam-smith/Wealth-Nations.pdf Wealth of Nations], Penn State Electronic Classics edition, republished 2005, pp. 643–49&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The interested and active zeal of religious teachers can be dangerous and troublesome only where there is either but one sect tolerated in the society, or where the whole of a large society is divided into two or three great sects; the teachers of each acting by concert, and under a regular discipline and subordination. But that zeal must be altogether innocent, where the society is divided into two or three hundred, or, perhaps, into as many thousand small sects, of which no one could be considerable enough to disturb the public tranquillity. The teachers of each sect, seeing themselves surrounded on all sides with more adversaries than friends, would be obliged to learn that candour and moderation which are so seldom to be found among the teachers of those great sects.&lt;ref name="Smith2"&gt;Smith, Adam (1776), [http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adam-smith/Wealth-Nations.pdf Wealth of Nations], Penn State Electronic Classics edition, republished 2005, p. 647&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Hinduism===
Hinduism is one of the more broad-minded religions when it comes to religious freedom.&lt;ref name=Religionfacts.com&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religionfacts.com/hinduism/beliefs.htm|title=Hindu Beliefs|publisher=religionfacts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It respects the right of everyone to reach God in their own way. [[Hindus]] believe in different ways to preach attainment of God and religion as a philosophy and hence respect all religions as equal. One of the famous Hindu sayings about religion is: "Truth is one; sages call it by different names."&lt;ref name=Religionfacts.com/&gt;

===Judaism===
[[File:Lesley and Rachel Detained.jpg|thumb|Women detained at Western Wall for wearing prayer shawls; photo from Women of the Wall]]
[[Judaism]] includes multiple streams, such as Orthodox, [[Reform Judaism]], [[Conservative Judaism]], [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], [[Jewish Renewal]] and [[Humanistic Judaism]]. However, Judaism also exists in many forms as a civilization, possessing characteristics known as  peoplehood, rather than strictly as a religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Erica|last2=Galperin|first2=Misha|title=The Case for Jewish Peoplehood: Can We be One?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QBQxCts6_CYC|year=2009|publisher=Jewish Lights Publishing|isbn=978-1-58023-401-6|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QBQxCts6_CYC&amp;pg=PA71 71]|quote=The 'hood' is not only a geographic reference; it is a shared identity that may be characterized by joint assumptions, body language, certain expressions, and a host of familial-like behaviors that unite an otherwise dispirate groupe of people.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Torah, Jews are forbidden to practice idolatry and are commanded to root out pagan and idolatrous practices within their midst, including killing idolaters who sacrifice children to their gods, or engage in immoral activities. However, these laws are not adhered to anymore as Jews have usually lived among a multi-religious community.

After the conquest of the Kingdoms of Israel and Judea by the Roman Empire, a Jewish state did not exist until 1948 with the establishment of the State of Israel. For over 1500 years Jewish people lived under pagan, Christian, Muslim, etc. rule. As such Jewish people in some of these states faced persecution. From the pogroms in Europe during the Middle Ages to the establishment of segregated Jewish ghettos during World War II. In the Middle East, Jews were categorised as dhimmi, non- Muslims permitted to live within a Muslim state. Even though given rights within a Muslim state, a dhimmi is still not equal to a Muslim within Muslim society, the same way non-Jewish Israeli citizens are not [[ Israeli apartheid| equal ]] with Jewish citizens in modern-day Israel.

Possibly because of this history of long term persecution, Jews in modernity have been among the most active proponents of religious freedom in the US and abroad and have founded and supported anti-hate institutions, including the Anti-Defamation League, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union. Jews are very active in supporting Muslim and other religious groups in the US against discrimination and hate crimes and most Jewish congregations throughout the US and many individual Jews participate in interfaith community projects and programs.

The State of Israel was established for the Jewish diaspora after World War II. While the Israel Declaration of Independence stresses religious freedom as a fundamental principle, in practice the current{{clarify timeframe|date=January 2017}} government, dominated by the ultra-Orthodox segment of the population has instituted legal barriers for those who do not practice Orthodox Judaism as Jews. However, as a nation state, Israel is very open towards other religions and religious practices, including public Muslim call to prayer chants and Christian prayer bells ringing in Jerusalem.  Israel has been evaluated in research by the Pew organization as having "high" government restrictions on religion. The government recognizes only Orthodox Judaism in certain matters of personal status, and marriages can only be performed by religious authorities. The government provides the greatest funding to Orthodox Judaism, even though adherents represent a minority of citizens.&lt;ref&gt;"Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life: Global restrictions on Religion (2009" http://www.pewforum.org/files/2009/12/restrictions-fullreport1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish women, including [[Anat Hoffman]], have been arrested at the [[Western Wall]] for praying and singing while wearing religious garments the Orthodox feel should be reserved for men. [[Women of the Wall]] have organized to promote religious freedom at the Wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Police-arrest-5-women-at-Western-Wall-for-wearing-tallitot-309436 "Police arrest 5 women at Western Wall for wearing tallitot"] ''Jerusalem Post'' (11 April 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014, a group of 60 non-Orthodox rabbinical students were told they would not be allowed to pray in the [[Knesset]] synagogue because it is reserved for Orthodox. Rabbi Joel Levy, director of the Conservative Yeshiva in Jerusalem, said that he had submitted the request on behalf of the students and saw their shock when the request was denied. He noted: "paradoxically, this decision served as an appropriate end to our conversation about religion and state in Israel." MK [[Dov Lipman]] expressed the concern that many Knesset workers are unfamiliar with non-Orthodox and American practices and would view "an egalitarian service in the synagogue as an affront."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Maltz | first=Judy | title=Non-Orthodox Jews prohibited from praying in Knesset synagogue | date=26 November 2014 | newspaper=Haaretz | url= http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.628571 | accessdate=21 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-Orthodox forms of Jewish practice function independently in Israel, except for these issues of praying at the Western Wall.

===Christianity===
[[File:Worship-monument.jpg|left|thumb|Part of the [[Oscar Straus (politician)|Oscar Straus]] Memorial in Washington, D.C. honoring the right to worship]] According to the Catholic Church in the [[Vatican II]] document on religious freedom, ''[[Dignitatis Humanae]]'', "the human person has a right to religious freedom", which is described as "immunity from coercion in civil society".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decl_19651207_dignitatis-humanae_en.html |title=Declaration on religious freedom – ''Dignitatis humanae'' |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=3 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211202206/http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decl_19651207_dignitatis-humanae_en.html |archivedate=11 February 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This principle of religious freedom "leaves untouched traditional Catholic doctrine on the moral duty of men and societies toward the true religion."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In addition, this right "is to be recognized in the constitutional law whereby society is governed and thus it is to become a civil right."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Prior to this, [[Pope Pius IX]] had written a document called the ''[[Syllabus of Errors]]. ''The Syllabus was made up of phrases and paraphrases from earlier papal documents, along with index references to them, and presented as a list of "condemned propositions". It does not explain why each particular proposition is wrong, but it cites earlier documents to which the reader can refer for the Pope's reasons for saying each proposition is false. Among the statements included in the Syllabus are: "[It is an error to say that] Every man is free to embrace and profess that religion which, guided by the light of reason, he shall consider true" (15); "[It is an error to say that] In the present day it is no longer expedient that the Catholic religion should be held as the only religion of the State, to the exclusion of all other forms of worship"; "[It is an error to say that] Hence it has been wisely decided by law, in some Catholic countries, that persons coming to reside therein shall enjoy the public exercise of their own peculiar worship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/P9SYLL.HTM|title=The Syllabus|author=[[Pope Pius IX]]|publisher=[[EWTN]]}}, [http://www.ewtn.com/ Global Catholic Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Orthodox Christians, especially those living in democratic countries, support religious freedom for all, as evidenced by the position of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate]]. Many Protestant Christian churches, including some [[Baptists]], [[Churches of Christ in Australia|Churches of Christ]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] and [[Mainline (Protestant)|main line]] churches have a commitment to religious freedoms. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] also affirms religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;''"We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may"'', [http://lds.org/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1?lang=eng the eleventh Article of Faith].&lt;/ref&gt;

However others, such as African scholar [[Makau Mutua]], have argued that Christian insistence on the propagation of their faith to native cultures as an element of religious freedom has resulted in a corresponding denial of religious freedom to native traditions and led to their destruction. As he states in the book produced by the Oslo Coalition on Freedom of Religion or Belief, "Imperial religions have necessarily violated individual conscience and the communal expressions of Africans and their communities by subverting African religions."&lt;ref&gt;Mutua, Makau. 2004.

In their book ''[[Breaking India]]'', [[Rajiv Malhotra]] and [[Aravindan Neelakandan]] discussed the "US Church" funding activities in India, such as the popularly advertised campaigns to "save" poor children by feeding, clothing, and educating them, with the book arguing that the funds collected were being used not so much for the purposes indicated to sponsors, but for indoctrination and conversion activities. They suggest that India is the prime target of a huge enterprise{{snd}} a "network" of organizations, individuals, and churches{{snd}} that, they argue, seem intensely devoted to the task of creating a separatist identity, history, and even religion for the vulnerable sections of India.

[[Joel Spring]] has written about the Christianization of the [[Roman Empire]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Christianity added new impetus to the expansion of empire. Increasing the arrogance of the imperial project, Christians insisted that the Gospels and the Church were the only valid sources of religious beliefs. Imperialists could claim that they were both civilizing the world and spreading the true religion. By the 5th century, Christianity was thought of as co-extensive with the ''Imperium romanum''. This meant that to be human, as opposed to being a natural slave, was to be "civilized" and Christian. Historian Anthony Pagden argues, "just as the ''civitas''; had now become coterminous with Christianity, so to be human{{snd}} to be, that is, one who was 'civil', and who was able to interpret correctly the law of nature{{snd}} one had now also to be Christian." After the fifteenth century, most Western colonialists rationalized the spread of empire with the belief that they were saving a barbaric and pagan world by spreading Christian civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Globalization and educational rights: an intercivilizational analysis|author=Joel H.

[[Conversion to Islam]] is simple, but Muslims are forbidden to convert  from Islam to another religion. Certain [[Muslim-majority countries]] are known for their restrictions on religious freedom, highly favoring Muslim citizens over non-Muslim citizens. Other countries{{who|date=February 2012}} having the same restrictive laws tend to be more liberal when imposing them. Even other Muslim-majority countries are secular and thus do not regulate religious belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=United States |first=Department of State|title=2010 International Religious Freedom Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2010_5/index.htm|work=International Religious Freedom Report|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2012|reason=this may be supportable, but I don't see clear support in the source cited}} 

Islamic theologians{{Who|date=October 2009}} quote the [[Qur'an]] ({{Cite quran|2|256|expand=no|q=There is no compulsion in religion}} and {{Cite quran|109|1|end=6|expand=no|q=Say: O you who reject faith, I do not worship what you worship, nor do you worship what I worship...To you be your religion, and to me be mine}}, i.e., Sura [[Al-Kafirun]]) to show scriptural support for religious freedom.

{{Cite quran|2|190|end=194|style=nosup}}, referring to the war against Pagans during the [[Battle of Badr]] in [[Medina]], indicates that Muslims are only allowed to fight against those who intend to harm them ([[right of self-defense]]) and that if their enemies surrender, they must also stop because God does not like those who transgress limits.

In Bukhari:V9 N316, Jabir ibn 'Abdullah narrated that a Bedouin accepted Islam and then when he got a fever he demanded that [[Muhammad]] to cancel his pledge (allow him to renounce Islam). Muhammad refused to do so. The Bedouin man repeated his demand once, but Muhammad once again refused. Then, he (the Bedouin) left Medina. Muhammad said, "Madinah is like a pair of bellows (furnace): it expels its impurities and brightens and clear its good." In this narration, there was no evidence demonstrating that Muhammad ordered the execution of the Bedouin for wanting to renounce Islam.

In addition, {{Cite quran|5|3|style=nosup}}, which is believed to be God's final revelation to Muhammad, states that Muslims are to fear God and not those who reject Islam, and {{Cite quran|53|38|end=39|style=nosup}} states that one is accountable only for one's own actions. Therefore, it postulates that in Islam, in the matters of practising a religion, it does not relate to a worldly punishment, but rather these actions are accountable to God in the [[afterlife]]. Thus, this supports the argument against the execution of apostates in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.wix.com/ugd/789970_3b7987b974024c298f48d68986fe0c80.pdf Islam and Belief: At Home with Religious Freedom], Abdullah Saeed (2014): 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on the other hand, some Muslims support the practice of executing apostates who leave Islam, as in Bukhari:V4 B52 N260; "The Prophet said, 'If a Muslim discards his religion and separates from the main body of Muslims, kill him.{{cn span|However, many Muslims believe that this hadith was written in the context of war and therefore Prophet Muhammad stipulated that whichever Muslim rejects his religion, leaves from the main body of Muslims and betrays the Muslims in war should be executed as a punishment for his treachery towards the community of Muslims. So many Muslims believe that this hadith talks about the punishment of [[Treason]].|date=March 2018}}

===Changing religion===
{{Main article|Religious conversion}}
Among the most contentious areas of religious freedom is the right of an individual to change or abandon his or her own religion ([[apostasy]]), and the right to [[Evangelism|evangelize]] individuals seeking to convince others to make such a change.

Other debates have centered around restricting certain kinds of missionary activity by religions. Many Islamic states, and others such as China, severely restrict missionary activities of other religions. Greece, among European countries, has generally looked unfavorably on missionary activities of denominations others than the majority church and proselytizing is constitutionally prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51555.htm|title=US State Department report on Greece|publisher=State.gov|date=8 November 2005|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different kind of critique of the freedom to propagate religion has come from non-Abrahamic traditions such as the African and Indian. African scholar [[Makau Mutua]] criticizes religious evangelism on the ground of cultural annihilation by what he calls "proselytizing universalist faiths" (Chapter 28: Proselytism and Cultural Integrity, p.&amp;nbsp;652):

{{Quote|...the (human) rights regime incorrectly assumes a level playing field by requiring that African religions compete in the marketplace of ideas. The rights corpus not only forcibly imposes on African religions the obligation to compete{{snd}} a task for which as nonproselytizing, noncompetitive creeds they are not historically fashioned{{snd}} but also protects the evangelizing religions in their march towards universalization ... it seems inconceivable that the human rights regime would have intended to protect the right of certain religions to destroy others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mutua  |first=Makau |title=Facilitating Freedom of Religion or Belief, A Deskbook |year=2004 |publisher= Oslo Coalition on Freedom of Religion or Belief|isbn=978-90-04-13783-7|page=652}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- direct quote should have page number.

Some Indian scholars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manushi-india.org/pdfs_issues/PDF%20Files%20150/Sankrant%20Sanu.%204-12.pdf|format=PDF|title=Re-examining Religious Freedom|first=Sankrant|last=Sanu|publisher=Manushi|year=2006|accessdate=26 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; have similarly argued that the right to propagate religion is not culturally or religiously neutral.

In Sri Lanka, there have been debates regarding a bill on religious freedom that seeks to protect indigenous religious traditions from certain kinds of missionary activities. Debates have also occurred in various states of India regarding similar laws, particularly those that restrict conversions using force, fraud or allurement.

In 2008, [[Christian Solidarity Worldwide]], a Christian human rights non-governmental organisation which specializes in religious freedom, launched an in-depth report on the human rights abuses faced by individuals who leave Islam for another religion. The report is the product of a year long research project in six different countries. It calls on Muslim nations, the international community, the UN and the international media to resolutely address the serious violations of human rights suffered by apostates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.online2.church123.com/attach.asp?clientURN=christiansolidarityworldwide2&amp;attachFileName=09ae125dba76986113441ef1463aca8e.attach&amp;attachOriginalFileName=CSW_Briefing_Apostasy_April_2008.pdf|title=No place to call home|date=29 April 2008|publisher=Christian Solidarity Worldwide|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Apostasy in Islam====
{{Main article|Apostasy in Islam|Takfir|Mutaween}}
[[File:Rechtsgutachten betr Apostasie im Islam.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Legal opinion on apostasy by the [[Fatwa]] committee at [[Al-Azhar University]] in [[Cairo]], the highest Islamic institution in the world, concerning the case of a man who converted to Christianity: "Since he left Islam, he will be invited to express his regret. If he does not regret, he will be killed pertaining to rights and obligations of the Islamic law."]]
In Islam, apostasy is called "''ridda''" ("turning back") and is considered to be a profound insult to God. A person born of Muslim parents that rejects Islam is called a "''murtad fitri''" (natural apostate), and a person that converted to Islam and later rejects the religion is called a "''murtad milli''" (apostate from the community).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peacefaq.com/apostacy.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118171026/http://www.peacefaq.com/apostacy.html |archivedate=18 November 2007 |df=dmy-all }} from "Leaving Islam: Apostates speak out" by Ibn Warraq&lt;/ref&gt;

In Islamic law ([[Sharia]]), the consensus view is that a male apostate must be [[Apostasy in Islam#Execution|put to death]] unless he suffers from a mental disorder or converted under duress, for example, due to an imminent danger of being killed. A female apostate must be either executed, according to [[Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]], and [[Hanbali]] schools of [[Sunni Islam]]ic jurisprudence ([[fiqh]]), or imprisoned until she reverts to Islam as advocated by the Sunni [[Hanafi]] school and by [[Shi'a]] scholars.&lt;ref name="EI Murtadd"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Heffening, W.|article=Murtadd| encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'' Online Edition|editor1=P.J. Bearman |editor2=Th. Bianquis |editor3=C.E. Bosworth |editor4=E. van Donzel |editor5=W.P. Heinrichs |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|issn=1573-3912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideally, the one performing the execution of an apostate must be an [[imam]].&lt;ref name="EI Murtadd" /&gt; At the same time, all schools of [[Islamic jurisprudence]] agree that any Muslim can kill an apostate without punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Adbul Qadir Oudah|title=Kitab Bhavan|year=1999|isbn=81-7151-273-9|publisher=Kitab Bhavan|location=New Delhi}}, Volume II. pp. 258–62; Volume IV. pp. 19–21&lt;/ref&gt;

However, while almost all scholars agree about the punishment, many disagree on the allowable time to retract the apostasy. Many scholars push this as far as allowing the apostate till he/she dies. Thus, practically making the death penalty just a theoretical statement/exercise.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} S. A. Rahman, a former Chief Justice of Pakistan, argues that there is no indication of the death penalty for apostasy in the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=S. A. Rahman|authorlink=S. A. Rahman|title=Punishment of Apostasy in Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L4fsYtFf5AoC|year=2007|publisher=The Other Press|isbn=978-983-9541-49-6|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=L4fsYtFf5AoC&amp;pg=PA132 132–42]|chapter=Summary and Conclusions|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=L4fsYtFf5AoC&amp;pg=Pa132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secular law===
Religious practice may also conflict with secular law, creating debates on religious freedom. For instance, even though [[polygamy]] is permitted in Islam, it is prohibited in secular law in many countries. This raises the question of whether prohibiting the practice infringes on the beliefs of certain Muslims. The US and India, both constitutionally secular nations, have taken two different views of this. In India, polygamy is permitted, but only for Muslims, under Muslim Personal Law. In the US, polygamy is prohibited for all. This was a major source of conflict between the early [[LDS Church]] and the United States until the Church amended its position on practicing polygamy.

Similar issues have also arisen in the context of the religious use of [[psychedelic substance]]s by Native American tribes in the United States as well as other Native practices.

In 1955, Chief Justice of California [[Roger J. Traynor]] neatly summarized the American position on how freedom of religion cannot imply freedom from law: "Although freedom of conscience and the freedom to believe are absolute, the freedom to act is not."&lt;ref&gt;''Pencovic v. Pencovic'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C2/45C2d97.htm 45 Cal. 2d 67] (1955).&lt;/ref&gt; But with respect to the religious use of animals within secular law and those acts, the [[US Supreme Court]] decision in the case of the ''[[Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah]]'' in 1993 upheld the right of Santeria adherents to practice ritual [[animal sacrifice]], with Justice Anthony Kennedy stating in the decision: "religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection" (quoted by Justice Kennedy from the opinion by Justice Burger in ''[[Thomas v. Review Board of the Indiana Employment Security Division]]'' {{ussc|450|707|1981}}).&lt;ref&gt;''Criminal Law and Procedure'', Daniel E. Hall. Cengage Learning, July 2008. p. 266.

In 2015, [[Kim Davis]], a Kentucky county clerk, refused to abide by the Supreme Court decision in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' legalizing [[Same-sex marriage in the United States]]. When she refused to issue marriage licenses, she became embroiled in the ''[[Miller v. Davis]]'' lawsuit. Her actions caused attorney and author [[Roberta Kaplan]] to state that "Kim Davis is the clearest example of someone who wants to use a religious liberty argument to discriminate."&lt;ref name="Bromberger" &gt;{{cite news |last=Bromberger |first=Brian |date=15 October 2015 |title=New book details Windsor Supreme Court victory |publisher=[[Bay Area Reporter]] |url=http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=70989 |accessdate=16 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, the case of Engele v. Vitale went to court over the violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment resulting from a mandatory nondenominational prayer in New York public schools. The Supreme Court ruled in opposition to the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/facts-and-case-summary-engel-v-vitale|title=Facts and Case Summary - Engel v.

In 1963, the Supreme Court ruled on the case of Abington School District v. Schempp. Edward Schempp sued the school district in Abington over the Pennsylvania law which required students to hear and sometimes read portions of the bible for their daily education.

In 1968, the Supreme Court ruled on the case of Epperson v. Arkansas. Susan Epperson, a high school teacher in Arkansas sued over a violation of religious freedom. The state had a law banning the teaching of evolution and the school Epperson worked for had provided curriculum which contained evolutionary theory. Epperson had to choose between violating the law or losing her job. The Supreme Court ruled to overturn the Arkansas law because it was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cases.laws.com/epperson-v-arkansas|title=Epperson V Arkansas - Cases {{!}} Laws.com|website=cases.laws.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social hostilities and government restrictions===
[[File:Religiousfreedom.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Freedom of religion by country (Pew Research Center study, 2009). Light yellow: low restriction; red: very high restriction on freedom of religion.]]
The [[Pew Research Center]] has performed studies on international religious freedom between 2009 and 2015, compiling global data from 16 governmental and non-governmental organizations–including the United Nations, the [[United States State Department]], and [[Human Rights Watch]]–and representing over 99.5 percent of the world's population.&lt;ref name="prc-1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Restrictions on Religion (Executive summary)|publisher=The Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life|date=December 2009|url=http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=491|accessdate=29 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prc-2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Restrictions on Religion (Full report)|publisher=The Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life|date=December 2009|url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2009/12/restrictions-fullreport.pdf|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, nearly 70 percent of the world's population lived in countries classified as having heavy restrictions on freedom of religion.&lt;ref name="prc-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="prc-2" /&gt; This concerns restrictions on religion originating from government prohibitions on [[free speech]] and religious expression as well as social hostilities undertaken by private individuals, organisations and social groups. Social hostilities were classified by the level of [[communal violence]] and [[Religious terrorism|religion-related terrorism]].

While most countries provided for the protection of religious freedom in their constitutions or laws, only a quarter of those countries were found to fully respect these legal rights in practice. In 75 countries governments limit the efforts of religious groups to proselytise and in 178 countries religious groups must register with the government. In 2013, Pew classified 30% of countries as having restrictions that tend to target religious minorities, and 61% of countries have social hostilities that tend to target religious minorities.&lt;ref name="pew2013"/&gt;

The countries in North and South America reportedly had some of the lowest levels of ''government'' and ''social'' restrictions on religion, while The Middle East and North Africa were the regions with the highest. Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Iran were the countries that top the list of countries with the ''overall'' highest levels of restriction on religion. Topping the Pew government restrictions index were Saudi Arabia, Iran, Uzbekistan, China, Egypt, Burma, Maldives, Eritrea, Malaysia and Brunei.

Of the world's 25 most populous countries, Iran, Egypt, Indonesia and Pakistan had the most restrictions, while Brazil, Japan, Italy, South Africa, the UK, and the US had some of the lowest levels, as measured by Pew.

Vietnam and China were classified as having high ''government'' restrictions on religion but were in the moderate or low range when it came to ''social'' hostilities. Nigeria, Bangladesh and India were high in ''social'' hostilities but moderate in terms of ''government'' actions.

Restrictions on religion across the world increased between mid-2009 and mid-2010, according to a 2012 study by the [[Pew Research Center]]. Restrictions in each of the five major regions of the world increased—including in the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa, the two regions where overall restrictions previously had been declining. In 2010, Egypt, Nigeria, the Palestinian territories, Russia, and Yemen were added to the "very high" category of social hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.pewforum.org/Government/Rising-Tide-of-Restrictions-on-Religion-findings.aspx|title=Rising Tide of Restrictions on Religion|date=20 September 2012|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five highest social hostility scores were for Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Iraq, and Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stage.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Issues/Government/RisingTide-SHI.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20121005033805/http://stage.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Issues/Government/RisingTide-SHI.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-10-05 |title=Table: Social Hostilities Index by country |year=2012 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Pew published that social hostilities declined in 2013, but the harassment of Jews increased.&lt;ref name="pew2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2015/02/26/religious-hostilities/|title=Latest Trends in Religious Restrictions and Hostilities|work=Pew Forum|date=26 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Praise be to Thee, O Father of all Fatherhood, Thou, the unknown God, who was before the fall of the sparks into the darkness of this aeon, for the glorious messengers of the light of Thy everlasting and redeeming Gnosis. Especially do we praise and thank Thee today for the following holy and enlightened teachers and knowers of truth: Valentinus of Rome; Basilides of Antioch; Carpocrates of Alexandria; Bardesanes of Syria; Mani of Babylonia, Martyr; Priscillian of Avila, Bishop and Martyr; Paul of Samosata, Bishop; Peter of Bruys, Martyr; Amalric of Bena; David of Dinan and William of Paris; Bogomil of Dragowitza, Bishop; Peter Waldo of Lyons; Joachim of Flora; Esclaremonde de Foix and the Cathar martyrs; and all the holy souls and wise sages who have in any way or form, under whatsoever guise and appearance attained to and taught the true and ancient Gnosis of God. Grant, O Boundless One, that inspired by and following their most noble example we also may see the light of Thy Gnosis and assist in liberating Thy sparks of light from the chains of darkness, ignorance and malice which afflict them in this aeon. 
Amen."&lt;ref&gt;Ecclesia Gnostica. [http://www.gnosis.org/ecclesia/lect162.htm Meditations: Day of All Gnostic Saints]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{History of religion}}

The '''history of religion''' refers to the written record of human [[religious]] experiences and ideas. This period of religious history begins with the [[invention of writing]] about 5,200 years ago (3200 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/wrtg/hd_wrtg.htm |title=The Origins of Writing &amp;#124; Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prehistory of [[religion]] involves the study of religious beliefs that existed prior to the advent of written records. One can also study comparative religious chronology through a [[timeline of religion]].  Writing played a major role in standardizing religious texts regardless of time or location, and making easier the memorization of prayers and divine rules.

The word "religion" as used in the 21st century does not have an obvious pre-colonial translation into non-European languages.

==History of study==
The school of religious history called the [[History of religions school|''Religionsgeschichtliche Schule'']], a late 19th-century [[Germany|German]] school of thought, originated the systematic study of [[religion]] as a [[society|socio]]-[[culture|cultural]] phenomenon. It depicted religion as evolving with human culture, from primitive [[polytheism]] to [[ethical monotheism]].

The ''Religionsgeschichtliche Schule'' emerged at a time when scholarly study of the [[Bible]] and of [[church history]] flourished in Germany and elsewhere (see [[higher criticism]], also called the ''historical-critical method''). The study of religion is important: religion and similar concepts have often shaped civilizations' law and moral codes, social structure, art and music.

==Overview==
The 19th century saw a dramatic increase in knowledge about a wide variety of [[cultures]] and religions, and also the establishment of economic and social histories of [[social progress|progress]]. The "history of religions" school sought to account for this religious diversity by connecting it with the social and economic situation of a particular group.

Typically, religions were divided into stages of progression from simple to complex societies, especially from [[polytheistic]] to [[monotheistic]] and from extempore to organized. One can also classify religions as circumcising and non-circumcising, proselytizing (attempting to convert people of other religion) and non-proselytizing. Many religions share common beliefs.

==Origin==
{{See also|Evolutionary origin of religions|Timeline of religion}}
The earliest evidence of religious ideas dates back several hundred thousand years to the [[Middle Paleolithic|Middle]] and [[Lower Paleolithic]] periods. Archaeologists refer to apparent intentional burials of [[Archaic humans|early ''Homo sapiens'']] from as early as 300,000 years ago as evidence of religious ideas. Other evidence of religious ideas include symbolic artifacts from [[Middle Stone Age]] sites in Africa. However, the interpretation of early paleolithic artifacts, with regard to how they relate to religious ideas, remains controversial. Archeological evidence from more recent periods is less controversial. Scientists({{which|date=July 2017}} generally interpret a number of artifacts from the [[Upper Paleolithic]] (50,000-13,000 BCE) as representing religious ideas. Examples of Upper Paleolithic remains associated with religious beliefs include the [[löwenmensch figurine|lion man]], the [[Venus figurines]], cave paintings from [[Chauvet Cave]] and the elaborate ritual burial from [[Sungir]].

In the 19th century researchers proposed various theories regarding the origin of religion, challenging earlier claims of a Christianity-like [[urreligion]]. Early theorists [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] (1832-1917) and [[Herbert Spencer]] (1820-1903) proposed the concept of [[animism]], while archaeologist  [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]] (1834-1913) used the term "[[fetishism]]". Meanwhile, religious scholar [[Max Müller]] (1823-1900) theorized that religion began in [[hedonism]] and folklorist [[Wilhelm Mannhardt]] (1831-1880) suggested that religion began in "naturalism", by which he meant mythological explanation of natural events.&lt;ref&gt;"Religion". ''Encyclopedia Universal Ilustrada Europeo-Americana'', 70 vols. Madrid. 1907-1930.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2017}} All of these theories have since been widely criticized; there is no broad consensus regarding the origin of religion.

[[Pre-pottery Neolithic A]] (PPNA) [[Göbekli Tepe]], the oldest religious site yet discovered anywhere&lt;ref name="ArchMag"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.archaeology.org/0811/abstracts/turkey.html| title=The World's First Temple| work= Archaeology magazine |date=Nov–Dec 2008 | page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes circles of erected massive T-shaped stone pillars, the world's oldest known [[megalith]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qR5TCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47|title=The Archaeology of Malta|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107006690|page=47|language=en|last1=Sagona|first1=Claudia|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; decorated with [[Abstract art|abstract]], enigmatic [[pictogram]]s and [[sculpture|carved]] animal reliefs. The site, near the home place of original wild wheat, was built before the so-called [[Neolithic Revolution]], i.e., the beginning of [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]] around 9000 BCE. But the construction of Göbekli Tepe implies organization of an advanced order not hitherto associated with [[Paleolithic]], [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A|PPNA]], or [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B|PPNB]] societies. The site, abandoned around the time the first agricultural societies started, is still being excavated and analyzed, and thus might shed light to the significance it had had for the region's older, foraging communities, as well as for the general history of religions.  

The [[Pyramid Texts]] from ancient Egypt are the oldest known [[religious texts]] in the world, dating to between 2400-2300 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SieAmOiyGQMC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=the+pyramid+texts+oldest+religious|title=An Introduction to Ancient Egyptian Literature|last=Budge|first=Wallis|isbn=0-486-29502-8|page=9|authorlink=E.

Surviving early copies of complete religious texts include: 

The [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], representing complete texts of the Hebrew [[Tanakh]]; these scrolls were copied approximately 2000 years ago. 

Complete Hebrew texts, also of the [[Tanakh]], but translated into the Greek language ([[Septuagint]] 300-200 BC), were in wide use by the early [[1st century]] CE. 

===Advantages of religion===
Organized religion emerged as a means of providing social and economic stability to large populations through the following ways:
* Organized religion served to justify a central authority, which in turn possessed the right to collect taxes in return for providing social and security services to the state. The empires of [[India]] and [[Mesopotamia]] were [[theocracies]], with chiefs, kings and emperors playing dual roles of political and [[spiritual leader]]s.&lt;ref name="shermer"&gt;{{cite book

|authorlink= Michael Shermer
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Virtually all state societies and chiefdoms around the world have similar political structures where political authority is justified by divine sanction.
* Organized religion emerged as means of maintaining peace between unrelated individuals. Bands and tribes consist of small number of related individuals. However states and nations include thousands or millions of unrelated individuals. [[Jared Diamond]] argues that organized religion served to provide a bond between unrelated individuals who would otherwise be more prone to enmity. He argues that a leading cause of death among band and tribal societies is murder.&lt;ref name="diamond"&gt;Compare: {{cite book|

==Axial age==
{{See also|Axial Age}}
Historians have labelled the period from 900 to 200 BCE as the "axial age", a term coined by [[Germany|German]]-Swiss [[philosopher]] [[Karl Jaspers]] (1883-1969). According to Jaspers, in this era of history "the [[spirituality|spiritual]] foundations of humanity were laid simultaneously and independently... And these are the foundations upon which humanity still subsists today." Intellectual historian [[Peter Watson (intellectual historian)|Peter Watson]] has summarized this period as the foundation time of many of humanity's most influential philosophical traditions, including [[monotheism]] in [[Persia]] and [[Canaan]], [[Platonism]] in Greece, [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] in India, and [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]] in China. These ideas would become institutionalized in time - note for example [[Ashoka]]'s role in the spread of Buddhism, or the role of [[Neoplatonism and Christianity|platonic philosophy in Christianity]] at its foundation.

The historical roots of Jainism in India date back to the 9th-century BCE with the rise of [[Parshvanatha]] and his non-violent philosophy.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=30}}{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p= 182-183}}{{qn|date=July 2017}}

==Middle Ages==
[[File:Medieval-World-Religions.png|thumb|Medieval world religions]]
[[World religion]]s of the present day established themselves throughout [[Eurasia]] during the [[Middle Ages]] by:

* [[Christianization]] of the [[Western world]]
* [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism|Buddhist missions to East Asia]]
* the [[decline of Buddhism in India|decline of Buddhism]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]]
* the [[spread of Islam]] throughout the [[Middle East]], [[Central Asia]], [[North Africa]] and parts of [[Europe]] and India

During the Middle Ages, [[Muslim]]s came into conflict with [[Zoroastrian]]s during the [[Islamic conquest of Persia]] (633-654); [[Christian]]s fought against Muslims during the [[Byzantine-Arab Wars]] (7th to 11th centuries), the [[Crusades]] (1095 onward), the [[Reconquista]] (718-1492), the [[Ottoman wars in Europe]] (13th century onwards) and the [[Inquisition]]; [[Shamanism]] was in conflict with [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], [[Taoism|Taoists]], Muslims and Christians during the [[Mongol invasions]] (1206-1337); and Muslims clashed with [[Hindu]]s and [[Sikh]]s during the [[Muslim conquests of the Indian subcontinent|Muslim conquest of the Indian subcontinent]] (8th to 16th centuries).

Many medieval religious movements emphasized [[mysticism]], such as the [[Cathars]] and related movements in the West, the Jews in Spain (see [[Zohar]]), the [[Bhakti movement]] in India and [[Sufism]] in Islam. [[Monotheism]] reached definite forms in Christian [[Christology]] and in Islamic [[Tawhid]]. [[Hindu views on monotheism|Hindu monotheist]] notions of [[Brahman]] likewise reached their classical form with the teaching of [[Adi Shankara]] (788-820).

==Modern period==
European [[colonisation]] during the 15th to 19th centuries resulted in the spread of Christianity in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], and to the [[Americas]], [[Australia]] and the [[Philippines]]. The invention of the [[printing press]] in the 15th century played a major role in the rapid spread of the [[Protestant Reformation]] under leaders such as [[Martin Luther]] (1483-1546) and [[John Calvin]] (1509-1564).  Wars of religion broke out, culminating in the [[Thirty Years War]] which ravaged central Europe between 1618 and 1648. The 18th century saw the beginning of [[secularisation]] in Europe, gaining momentum after the [[French Revolution]] of 1789 and following. By the late 20th century religion had declined in most of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sacred and Secular: Religion and Politics Worldwide|last=Norris|first=Pippa|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, the regimes of [[Communist Eastern Europe]] and of [[People's Republic of China|Communist China]] were anti-religious. A great variety of [[new religious movements]] originated in the 20th century, many proposing [[syncretism]] of elements of established religions. Adherence to such new movements is limited, however, remaining below 2% worldwide in the period 2000-2009. Adherents of the classical world religions account for more than 75% of the world's population, while adherence to indigenous [[tribal religion]]s has fallen to 4%. {{As of|2005}}, an estimated 14% of the world's population identifies as [[nonreligious]].{{Fact|date=November 2018}}

By 2001 people began to use the internet to discover or adhere to their religious beliefs. In January 2000 the website [[beliefnet]] was established, and the following year, every month it had over 1.7 million visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zabriskie, Phil|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010608152025/http://www.time.com:80/time/interactive/religion/god_np.html|title=I Once Was Lost, but Now I'm Wired |publisher=''[[Time Asia]]''|date=2001-06-04|volume=157|issue=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Humility''' is the quality of being '''humble'''. Dictionary definitions accentuate humility as a low self-regard and sense of unworthiness.&lt;ref name="SnyderLopez2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=C.

Humility is an outward expression of an appropriate inner, or self regard, and is contrasted with [[humiliation]] which is an imposition, often external, of [[shame]] upon a person.  Humility may be misappropriated as ability to suffer humiliation through self-denouncements which in itself remains focus on self rather than low self-focus.&lt;ref name="Schwarzer 2012"&gt;{{cite book | last=Schwarzer | first=Ralf | title=Personality, human development, and culture : international perspectives on psychological science | publisher=Psychology | location=Hove | year=2012 | isbn=978-0-415-65080-9 | pages=127–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeff Greenberg|author2=Sander L.

Humility, in various interpretations, is widely seen as a [[virtue]] which centers on low self-preoccupation, or unwillingness to put oneself forward, so it is in many religious and philosophical traditions, it contrasts with [[narcissism]], [[hubris]] and other forms of [[pride]] and is an idealistic and rare intrinsic construct that has an extrinsic side.

==Term==
The term "humility" comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''[[wikt:humilitas#Latin|humilitas]]'', a noun related to the adjective ''{{lang|la|[[wikt:humilis#Latin|humilis]]}}'', which may be translated as "humble", but also as "grounded", or "from the earth", since it derives from ''{{lang|la|[[wikt:humus#Latin|humus]]}}'' (earth). See the English ''[[humus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/humble "Humble" from Merriam-Webster], m-w.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "humble" may be related to feudal England where the lowest cuts of meat, or 'umbles' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fallow-deer-project.net/img/upload/370/documents/1066%20and%20all%20that.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;,' that is to say whatever was left over when the upper classes had taken their parts, were provided to the lowest class of citizen.  The term 'humble pie,' meaning to exist in a lowly station, may derive from this definition.

==Mythology==
[[Aidos]], in Greek mythology, was the ''daimona'' (goddess) of shyness, shame, and humility.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Scheff and Suzanne Retzinger, Emotions and Violence: shame and rage in destructive conflicts, {{ISBN|0-595-21190-9}}, page 7&lt;/ref&gt; She was the quality that restrained human beings from wrong.

==Religious views of humility==

===Abrahamic===

====Judaism====
Rabbi Lord [[Jonathan Sacks]] states that in Judaism humility is an appreciation of oneself, one's talents, skills, and virtues.  It is not meekness or self-deprecating thought, but the effacing of oneself to something higher.  Humility is not to think lowly of oneself, but to appreciate the self one has received. In recognition of the mysteries and complexities of life, one becomes humbled to the awesomeness of what one is and what one can achieve.  Rabbi [[Pini Dunner]] discusses that humility is to place others first; it is to appreciate others' worth as important.  In recognizing our worth as people, Rabbi Dunner shows that looking into the zillions of stars in the sky, and in the length and history of time, you and I are insignificant, like dust. Rabbi Dunner states that Moses wrote in the Torah, "And Moses was exceedingly humble, more than any man on the face of the earth." How is it possible to be humble and write you are the most humble? The conclusion is that Moses knew he was humble. It is not in denial of your talents and gifts but to recognize them and live up to your worth and something greater.  It is in the service to others that is the greatest form of humility.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/160968/jewish/What-is-Humility.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/1932762/jewish/Greatness-is-Humility.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/83807/jewish/On-Humility.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1218750/jewish/Humility.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

As illustrated in the person of [[Moses]], who leads the nation of [[Hebrews]] out of slavery in Egypt and to the “Promised Land”, humility is a sign of Godly strength and purpose, not weakness. Of this great leader, the Bible states, “For Moses was a man exceeding meek above all men that dwelt upon earth" ({{bibleref|Numbers|12:3}}).  Moses is venerated by Jewish, Christian and Muslim adherents alike.

Amongst the benefits of humility described in the [[Old Testament]], that is shared by many faiths, are [[honor]], [[wisdom]], [[prosperity]], the protection of the Lord and [[peace]]. In addition, "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the  humble" ({{bibleref|Proverbs|3:34}})

====Christianity====

{{Quote box|quote=Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others.
In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus:
Who, being in very nature God,
did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage;
rather, he made himself nothing
by taking the very nature of a servant,
being made in human likeness.
And being found in appearance as a man,
he humbled himself
by becoming obedient to death—
even death on a cross!
|source=Philippians 2:3-8, NIV&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philippians 2|url=http://biblehub.com/niv/philippians/2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;| align=right|width=30%}}

New Testament exhortations to humility are found in many places, for example "Blessed are the meek" ({{bibleref|Matthew|5}}), "He who exalts himself will be humbled and he who humbles himself will be exalted" ({{bibleref|Matthew|23:12}}), as well as ({{bibleref|Philippians|2:1-17}}) and throughout the [[Epistle of James|Book of James]]. Also in [[Jesus|Jesus Christ's]] behavior in general and submission to unjust torture and execution in particular, are held up as examples of righteous humility: "Who, when he was reviled, did not revile: when he suffered, he threatened not: but delivered himself to him that judged him justly."{{bibleref|1 Peter|2:23}},&lt;ref name="Humility 1860, pp 598-599"/&gt;

[[C.S. Lewis]] writes, in ''[[Mere Christianity]]'', that pride is the "anti-God" state, the position in which the ego and the self are directly opposed to God: "Unchastity, anger, greed, drunkenness, and all that, are mere fleabites in comparison: it was through Pride that the devil became the devil: Pride leads to every other vice: it is the complete anti-God state of mind."&lt;ref&gt;Mere Christianity, C.S. Lewis, {{ISBN|978-0-06-065292-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Lewis contends that, in Christian moral teaching, the opposite of pride is humility.  This is popularly illustrated by a  phrase wrongly attributed to Lewis, "Humility is not thinking less of yourself, but thinking of yourself less." This is an apparent paraphrase, by Rick Warren in "The Purpose Driven Life", of a passage found in "[[Mere Christianity]]:" Lewis writes, regarding the truly humble man, {{block quote|Do not imagine that if you meet a really humble man he will be what most people call "humble" nowadays: he will not be a sort of greasy, smarmy person, who is always telling you that, of course, he is nobody. Probably all you will think about him is that he seemed a cheerful, intelligent chap who took a real interest in what you said to him. If you do dislike him it will be because you feel a little envious of anyone who seems to enjoy life so easily. He will not be thinking about humility: he will not be thinking about himself at all.}}

[[St. Augustine]] stresses the importance of humility in the study of the Bible, with the exemplars of a barbarian Christian slave, the apostle Paul, and the Ethiopian eunuch in Acts 8 (''[[De Doctrina Christiana]]'', prooem. 4–7 [hereafter ''DDC'']).  Both learner and teacher need to be humble, because they learn and teach what ultimately belongs to God (''DDC'', prooem. 7–8; 1 Cor. 4:7). Humility is a basic disposition of the interpreter of the Bible. The confidence of the exegete and preacher arises from the conviction that his or her mind depends on God absolutely (''DDC'', 1.1.1). Augustine argues that the interpreter of the Bible should proceed with humility, because only a humble person can grasp the truth of Scripture (''DDC'', 2.41.62).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Woo | first=B. Hoon | title=Augustine’s Hermeneutics and Homiletics in ''De doctrina christiana'' | journal= Journal of Christian Philosophy | year=2013 | volume=17 | url=https://www.academia.edu/5228314/_Augustines_Hermeneutics_and_Homiletics_in_De_doctrina_christianae_Humiliation_Love_Sign_and_Discipline_Journal_of_Christian_Philosophy_17_2013_97-117 |pages=99–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humility is said to be a fit recipient of grace; according to the words of St. James, "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble" ({{bibleref|Proverbs|3:34}}, {{bibleref|1Peter|5:5}},{{bibleref|James|4:6}}.)

"True humility" is distinctly different from "false humility" which consists of deprecating one's own sanctity, gifts, talents, and accomplishments for the sake of receiving praise or adulation from others, as personified by the [[fictional character]] [[Uriah Heep]] created by [[Charles Dickens]]. In this context legitimate humility comprises the following behaviors and attitudes:
*Submitting to God and legitimate authority 
*Recognizing virtues and talents that others possess, particularly those that surpass one's own, and giving due honor and, when required, obedience
*Recognizing the limits of one's talents, ability, or authority.

The vices opposed to humility are: 
*[[Pride]]  
*Too great [[obsequiousness]] or abjection of oneself; this would be considered an excess of humility, and could easily be derogatory to one's office or holy character; or it might serve only to pamper pride in others, by unworthy flattery, which would occasion their sins of tyranny, arbitrariness, and arrogance. The virtue of humility may not be practiced in any external way that would occasion vices in others.&lt;ref name="CE" /&gt;

=====Catholicism=====

[[File:Madonna-of-humility- 1433 Domenico di Bartolo.jpg|thumb|240px| This ''[[Madonna of humility]]'' by [[Domenico di Bartolo]] expresses the symbolic duality of an earthly woman with humility, as well as a [[Queen of Heaven|heavenly queen]].&lt;ref Name =Trinchieri&gt;''Art and music in the early modern period'' by Franca Trinchieri Camiz, Katherine A. McIver {{ISBN|0-7546-0689-9}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=mdIFQTuA4cQC&amp;pg=PA15 page 15]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Catholic]] texts view humility as annexed to the [[cardinal virtue]] of [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]].&lt;ref name="Humility 1910, pp 543-544"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CE"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07543b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia, " Humility"], newadvent.org&lt;/ref&gt; It is viewed as a potential part of temperance because temperance includes all those virtues that restrain or express the inordinate movements of our desires or appetites.&lt;ref name="CE" /&gt;

[[Bernard of Clairvaux|St. Bernard]] defines it as, "A virtue by which a man knowing himself as he truly is, abases himself. Jesus Christ is the ultimate definition of Humility."&lt;ref name="CE" /&gt;

Humility was a virtue extolled by Saint [[Francis of Assisi]], and this form of [[Order of Saint Francis|Franciscan]] piety led to the artistic development of the ''[[Madonna of humility]]'' first used by them for [[Christian contemplation|contemplation]].&lt;ref&gt;''A history of ideas and images in Italian art'' by James Hall 1983 {{ISBN|0-06-433317-5}} page 223&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Iconography of Christian Art'' by Gertrud Schiller 1971 ASIN: B0023VMZMA page 112&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Madonna (art)|Virgin]] of humility sits on the ground, or upon a low cushion, unlike the ''Enthroned Madonna'' representations.&lt;ref&gt;''Renaissance Art: A Topical Dictionary'' by Irene Earls 1987 {{ISBN|0-313-24658-0}} page 174&lt;/ref&gt; This style of painting spread quickly through Italy and by 1375 examples began to appear in Spain, France and Germany and it became the most popular among the styles of the early [[Trecento]] artistic period.&lt;ref name=Meiss&gt;''Painting in Florence and Siena after the Black Death'' by Millard Meiss 1979 {{ISBN|0-691-00312-2}} pages 132-133&lt;/ref&gt;

[[St. Thomas Aquinas]], a 13th-century philosopher and theologian in the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] tradition, defines humility similarly as "the virtue of humility" that "consists in keeping oneself within one's own bounds, not reaching out to things above one, but submitting to one's superior" (Summa Contra Gent., bk. IV, ch. lv, tr. [[Joseph Rickaby]]).

====Islam====
In the [[Qur'an]], various Arabic words conveying the meaning of "humility" are used.  The very term "[[Islam]]" can be interpreted as "surrender (to God), humility”, from the triconsonantal root [[S-L-M]]; other words used are ''tawadu'' and ''khoshou'': &lt;!-- the word "humility" is a noun but the 2 Arabic words used before were verbs, so I changed these to nouns.  In order not to have a discussion about this, I will explain that I know what the previous editor had in mind. The person who used the verbs (which were the past tense of a male 3rd person singular) used what is customarily considered a "root" of the verb, which, for example, is used in finding a word in a dictionary.  This, however, was not warranted here because we just needed to have the exact translation of the noun "humility" --&gt;

====Buddhism====
{{see also|Anatta}}
Buddhism is a religion of self-examination.&lt;ref name="Tachibana 1992"/&gt; The natural aim of the Buddhist life is the state of [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]], gradually cultivated through meditation and other spiritual practices. Humility, in this context, is a characteristic that is both an essential part of the spiritual practice, and a result of it.&lt;ref name="Tachibana 1992"/&gt;{{rp|180, 183}} As a quality to be developed, it is deeply connected with the practice of Four Abodes ([[Brahmavihara]]): love-kindness, compassion, empathetic joy and equanimity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} As a result of the practice, this cultivated humility is expanded by the wisdom acquired by the experience of ultimate emptiness ([[Shunyata]]) and non-self ([[Anatta]]).&lt;ref name="Tachibana 1992"/&gt;{{rp|181}} Humility, compassion, and wisdom are intrinsic parts of the state of enlightenment.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} On the other hand, not being humble is an obstacle on the path of enlightenment which needs to be overcome.&lt;ref name="Tachibana 1992"/&gt;{{rp|180}} In the [[Tipitaka]] (the Buddhist scriptures), criticizing others and praising oneself is considered a vice; but criticizing oneself and praising others is considered a virtue.&lt;ref name="Tachibana 1992"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tachibana|first1=S.|title=The ethics of Buddhism|date=1992|publisher=Curzon Press|location=Richmond, Surrey|isbn=070070230X|edition=[Facsim. ed.].|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BRWyqi2K4WUC}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|178}} Attachment to the self, apart from being a vice in itself, also leads to other evil states, that create suffering.&lt;ref name="Tachibana 1992"/&gt;{{rp|182}}

In the Tipitaka, in the widely known "[[Mangala Sutta]]", humility (''{{lang-pi|nivato}}'', literally: 'without air') is mentioned as one of the thirty-eight blessings in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|translator-last=Ñāṇamoli|translator-first=Bhikkhu|translator-link=Nanamoli Bhikkhu|title=The Minor Readings and The Illustrator of Ultimate Meaning|date=1960|publisher=[[Pali Text Society]]|location=London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2FCToAEACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Pali tradition, examples of humility that are often raised are the monk [[Sariputta|Sariputta Thera]], a leading disciple of the Buddha, and Hatthaka, a leading lay disciple. In later Pali texts and [[Atthakatha|Commentaries]], Sariputta Thera is depicted as a forgiving person, who is quick to apologize and accepting of criticism. In the ''[[suttas]]'' (discourses of the Buddha) Hatthaka is praised by the Buddha when he was unwilling to let other people know his good qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malalasekera|author-link= G P Malalasekera|first1=G.P.|title=Dictionary of Pāli proper names|volume=2|date=2007|orig-year=First published 1937|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass Publishers]]|location=Delhi|isbn=8120830229|edition=1st Indian|url=http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/dic_idx.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Buddhist practice]], humility is practiced in a variety of ways. For example, Japanese [[Soto Zen]] monks bow and chant in honor of their robes before they don them. This serves to remind them of the connection of the monk's robes with enlightenment. Buddhist monks in all traditions are dependent on the generosity of laypeople, through whom they receive their necessities. This in itself is a practice of humility.&lt;ref name="Tachibana 1992"/&gt;{{rp|178}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Tanabe|first1=Willa Jane|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|title=Robes and clothing|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert E.|date=2004|publisher=[[Thomson Gale|Macmillan Reference USA, Thomson Gale]]|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-02-865720-9|page=732}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hindu Dharma / Sanathana Dharma====
In Sanskrit literature, the virtue of humility is explained with many terms, some of which use the root word, ''neti'' (sometimes spelled ''nati'', ''nti'', Sanskrit: नति).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=humility+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU Sanskrit translations for Humility] English-Sanskrit Dictionary, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanskrit.inria.fr/MW/132.html Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary], see explanation under the term नति [ nati ], France&lt;/ref&gt; "नति" comes from "न ति" or 'No "Me" / I am not'. Related words include ''viniti'' (विनति), ''samniti'' (संनति, humility towards), and the concept ''amanitvam'', listed as the first virtue in the [[Bhagwad Gita]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bhagavad-gita.org/Gita/verse-13-06.html Bhagwad Gita 13.8-12] See transliteration, and two commentaries.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Amanitvam'' is a fusion word for "pridelessness" and the virtue of "humility".&lt;ref&gt;''Hindu spirituality: Postclassical and modern'' edited by K. R. Sundararajan, Bithika Mukerji; {{ISBN|978-8120819375}}; see pages 403-405&lt;/ref&gt; Other related concepts are ''namrata'' (नम्रता), which means ''modest and humble behavior''.

Different scholars have varying interpretations for the concept of ''amanitvam'', humility, as virtue in the Bhagwad Gita.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, B. (2006). BHAGAVAD GĪTĀ AS DUTY AND VIRTUE ETHICS. Journal of Religious Ethics, 34(3), 373-395.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Prabhupada explains humility to mean one should not be anxious to have the satisfaction of being honored by others.&lt;ref&gt;''BHAGAVAD GITA AS IT IS'' - By His Divine Grace A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada.&lt;/ref&gt; The material conception of life makes us very eager to receive honor from others, but from the point of view of a man in perfect knowledge—who knows that he is not this body—anything, honor or dishonor, pertaining to this body is useless. Jopson explains ''amanitvam'', humility, as lack of arrogance and pride, and one of twenty-six virtues in a human being that if perfected, leads one to a divine state of living and the ultimate truth.&lt;ref&gt;Tanya Jopson, ''Human Energy-Body Awareness: How Our Energy Body &amp; Vibrational Frequency Create Our Everyday Life'', {{ISBN|978-1466333413}}, see Divine Qualities under Glossary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bhawuk, D. P. (2011). Epistemology and Ontology of Indian Psychology. In Spirituality and Indian Psychology (pp. 163-184). Springer New York.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eknath Easwaran]] writes that the Gita's subject is "the war within, the struggle for self-mastery that every human being must wage if he or she is to emerge from life victorious",&lt;ref&gt;Eknath Easwaran, ''The Bhagavad Gita'' (2007), {{ISBN|978-1-58638-019-9}} p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; and "The language of battle is often found in the scriptures, for it conveys the strenuous, long, drawn-out campaign we must wage to free ourselves from the tyranny of the ego, the cause of all our suffering and sorrow".&lt;ref&gt;Eknath Easwaran, ''The End of Sorrow: The Bahagavad Gita for Daily Living (vol 1)'' (1993), {{ISBN|978-0-915132-17-1}}  p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; To get in touch with your true self, whether you call that [[God]], [[Brahman]], etc., one has to let go of the ego.  The [[Sanskrit]] word [[Ahamkara]] literally translates into The-sound-of-I, or quite simply the sense of the self or ego.

[[Mahatma Gandhi|Mahatma Gandhi]] interprets the concept of ''humility'' in Hindu Dharma much more broadly, where humility is an essential virtue that must exist in a person for other virtues to emerge. To Mahatma Gandhi, Truth can be cultivated, as well as Love, but Humility cannot be cultivated. Humility has to be one of the starting points. He states, "Humility cannot be an observance by itself. For it does not lend itself to being practiced. It is however an indispensable test of [[ahimsa]] (non-violence)." Humility must not be confused with mere manners; a man may prostrate himself before another, but if his heart is full of bitterness for the other, it is not humility. Sincere humility is how one feels inside, it's a state of mind. A humble person is not himself conscious of his humility, states Mahatma Gandhi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mkgandhi.org/swmgandhi/chap02.htm Humility The Gita and Satyagraha; The Philosophy of Non-violence and The Doctrine of the Sword], SELECTED WRITINGS OF MAHATMA GANDHI&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen S. Hall, Wisdom, {{ISBN|978-0-307-26910-2}}; see Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Swami Vivekananda|Swami Vivekananda]], one of the scholars of Hindu Dharma in the 19th century, argues that the concept of humility does not mean "crawling on all fours and calling oneself a sinner." In Vivekananda's Hindu Dharma, each human being being the Universal, recognizing and feeling oneness with everyone and everything else in the universe, without inferiority or superiority or any other bias, is the mark of humility.&lt;ref&gt;Swami Vivekananda, The Complete Works of the Swami Vivekananda, Volume 1 (1915); see page 343&lt;/ref&gt; To [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|Dr. S Radhakrishnan]], humility in Hindu Dharma is the non-judgmental state of mind when we are best able to learn, contemplate and understand everyone and everything else.&lt;ref&gt;Radhakrishnan &amp; Muirhead, Contemporary Indian Philosophy (1936), Allen 7 Sons (London)&lt;/ref&gt;

Baba Nand Singh Ji Maharaj said about Guru Nanak that Garibi, Nimrata, Humility is the Divine Flavour, the most wonderful fragrance of the Lotus Feet of Lord Guru Nanak.&lt;ref name="sggs1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.babanandsinghsahib.org/rosary/fragrance.htm|title=Rosary of Divine Wisdom - Fragrance of The Holy Feet of Guru Nanak|website=www.babanandsinghsahib.org|access-date=2017-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no place for Ego (referred to in Sikhism as Haumain) in the sphere of Divine Love, in the sphere of true Prema Bhagti. That is why in the House of Guru Nanak one finds Garibi, Nimrata, Humility reigning supreme. Guru Nanak was an Incarnation of Divine Love and a Prophet of True Humility.

According to Sikhism all people, equally, have to bow before God so there ought to be no hierarchies among or between people.  According to Nanak the supreme purpose of human life is to reconnect with [[Akal]] (The Timeless One), however, egotism is the biggest barrier in doing this. Using the guru's teaching remembrance of ''[[Nām Japō|nām]]'' (the divine Word)&lt;ref name="NaamSimran"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Paths-Divine-Ancient-Indian-12/dp/1565182480/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1385026816&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=1565182480 | title=Paths to The Divine: Ancient and Indian: 12 | publisher=Council for Research in Values &amp; | author=McLean, George | date=15 Jun 2008 | location=1565182480 | pages=599}}&lt;/ref&gt;  leads to the end of egotism.  The immediate fruit of humility is intuitive peace and pleasure. With humility they continue to meditate on the Lord, the treasure of excellence. The God-conscious being is steeped in humility. One whose heart is mercifully blessed with abiding humility. Sikhism treats humility as a begging bowl before the god.

Sikhs extend this belief in equality, and thus humility, towards all faith:  "all religious traditions are equally valid and capable of enlightening their followers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Sikhism|edition= |last= Singh Kalsi|first= Sewa|year= 2007|publisher= Bravo Ltd.|location= London|isbn= 978-1-85733-436-4|page= 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to [[Vaṇḍ Chakkō|sharing]] with others Guru Nanak inspired people to earn an honest living without exploitation and also the need for [[Naam Japna|remembrance]] of the divine name (God).

Baba Nand Singh Sahib is renowned as the most humble Sikh Saint in the history of Sikhism.

San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented. pp. 25-26. {{ISBN|978-0-525-47434-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Baba emphasized the importance of being humble when serving others: "''One of the most difficult things to learn is to render service without bossing, without making a fuss about it and without any consciousness of high and low. In the world of spirituality, humility counts at least as much as utility''."&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1933). ''The Sayings of Shri Meher Baba.''

Humility, in Taoism, is defined as a refusal to assert authority or a refusal to be first in anything and that the act of daring, in itself, is a refusal of wisdom and a rush to enjoin circumstances before you are ready.  Along with [[compassion]] and [[frugality]], humility is one the [[Three Treasures (Taoism)|three treasures]] (virtues) in the possession of those who follow the  [[Tao]].&lt;ref name="Lao Tzu 1997"/&gt;

The treasure of humility, in Chinese is a six-character phrase instead of a single word: ''Bugan wei tianxia xian'' 不敢為天下先 "not dare to be first/ahead in the world". 
Ellen Chen notes&lt;ref name="Lao Tzu 1997"&gt;Lao Tzu, Jane English, and Gia-Fu Feng (1997), Tao Te Ching, Vintage Books, {{ISBN|978-0679776192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*Chen, Ellen M., 1989, ''The Te Tao Ching: A New Translation with Commentary'', Paragon House.&lt;/ref&gt; that
&lt;blockquote&gt;The third treasure, daring not be at the world's front, is the Taoist way to avoid premature death. To be at the world's front is to expose oneself, to render oneself vulnerable to the world's destructive forces, while to remain behind and to be humble is to allow oneself time to fully ripen and bear fruit. This is a treasure whose secret spring is the fear of losing one's life before one's time. This fear of death, out of a love for life, is indeed the key to Taoist wisdom. (1989:209) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, also according to the [[Tao Te Ching]] (77.4) a wise person acts without claiming the results as his; he achieves his merit and does not rest (arrogantly) in it: – he does not wish to display his superiority.&lt;ref name="Lao Tzu 1997"/&gt;

===Wicca===

In the numerous traditions of initiatory Wicca, called in the U.S.A. '''British Traditional Wicca''', four paired &amp; balanced qualities are recommended in liturgical texts as having come from the Wiccan Goddess:

{{Quote|text=''"…let there be beauty and strength, power and compassion, honor and humility, mirth and reverence within you."''|sign=Doreen Valiente, ''The Charge of the Goddess,'' prose version}}

In the matter of humility, this deific instruction appropriately pairs being honorable with being humble. Characteristically, this Wiccan "virtue" is balanced by its partner virtue.

==Philosophical views of humility==
[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s view of humility has been defined as "that meta-attitude that constitutes the moral agent's proper perspective on himself as a dependent and corrupt but capable and dignified rational agent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=4881|title=Kant and the Ethics of Humility|author=ENR // AgencyND // University of Notre Dame|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kant's notion of humility relies on the centrality of truth and rational thought leading to proper perspective and can therefore be seen as [[emergence|emergent]].

[[Mahatma Gandhi]] is attributed as suggesting that attempting to sustain [[truth]] without humility is doomed to become an "arrogant caricature" of truth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060630013653/http://www.geocities.com/rkvenkat/chastity.html Gandhi on Brahmacharya&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], geocities.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mkgandhi.org/epigrams/h.htm Epigrams from Gandhiji&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], mkgandhi.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Cohon, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-moral/ Hume's Moral Philosophy] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (August 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;André Vauchez (2002), Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages, see article on ''Humility'', James Clarke &amp; Co, {{ISBN|9780227679319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many religions and philosophers view humility as a virtue, some have been critical of it, seeing it as opposed to [[individualism]].

[[Nietzsche]] views humility as a [[strategy]] used by the weak to avoid being destroyed by the strong.  In ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'' he writes: "When stepped on, a worm doubles up. That is clever. In that way he lessens the probability of being stepped on again. In the language of morality:  humility."{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} He believed that his idealized [[Übermensch]] would be more apt to roam around unfettered by pretensions of humility, proud of his stature and power, but not reveling idly in it, and certainly not displaying [[hubris]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}  But, if so, this would mean the pretension aspect of this kind of humility is more akin to [[obsequiousness]] and to other kinds of pretentious humility.

==Humility and leadership==
Recent research suggests that humility is a quality of certain types of leaders. For example, [[James Collins (bioengineer)|Jim Collins]] and his colleagues found that a certain type of leader, whom they term "level 5", possesses humility and fierce resolve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Collins |first=J. |year=2001 |title= Level 5 leadership: The triumph of humility and fierce resolve |work=Harvard Business Review |pages= 66–76 |accessdate=August 20, 2010 |url=http://www.hr-newcorp.com/articles/Level5%20Leadership_Jim%20Collins.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229150239/http://www.hr-newcorp.com/articles/Level5%20Leadership_Jim%20Collins.pdf |archivedate=2009-12-29 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humility is being studied as a trait that can enhance leadership effectiveness. The research suggests that humility is multi-dimensional and includes self-understanding and awareness, openness, and perspective taking.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, J. A., Brotheridge, C. M., &amp; Urbanski, J. C. (2005). Bringing humility to leadership: Antecedents and consequences of leader humility. Human Relations, 58, 1323-1350.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, R., Marrone, J.

{{Sri Aurobindo}}
'''Integral yoga''', also called '''supramental yoga''', is the yoga-based philosophy and practice of [[Sri Aurobindo]] and ''The Mother'' ([[Mirra Alfassa]]). Integral yoga  finds all life conscious or subconscious a [[yoga]], defines the term yoga as a methodised effort towards self-perfection by the expression of the secret potentialities latent in the being and  highest condition of victory in that effort - a union of the human individual with the universal and transcendent existence which is seen partially as expressions in humans and in the cosmos. As a yoga idea, that Spirit manifests itself in a process of [[Involution (esoterism)|involution]]. The reverse process of [[Spiritual evolution|evolution]] is driven toward a complete manifestation of spirit.

According to [[Sri Aurobindo]], the current status of human evolution is an intermediate stage in the evolution of being, which is on its way to the unfolding of the spirit, and the self-revelation of divinity in all things.{{sfnp|Sri Aurobindo|1939|p=1107}} Yoga is a rapid and concentrated evolution of being, which can take effect in one life-time, while unassisted natural evolution would take many centuries or many births.{{sfnp|Sri Aurobindo|1996|p=282|ps=}} Aurobindo suggests a grand program called sapta chatushtaya (seven quadrates) to aid this evolution.

==Concept of Life==
=== The two common perception of Life &amp; Reality===
Sri Aurobindo finds that there are two extreme views of life, The [[Materialism|materialists]] &amp; The [[Asceticism|Ascetics]]  
 
'''The Materialists''' : He finds materialists would only accept the existence of [[matter]] or [[force]] and deny anything else, &amp; would in their argument  find anything which is not knowable (that which would escape once thought and speech) as inert or a passive, silent Atman, an illusion or a hallucination,   this affirmation by the materialists is based on the association of the real with the materially perceptible, and becomes the basis of his assumption on all his arguments. Which Sri Aurobindo finds cannot give an impartial reasoning. Due to the above notion the materialists would refuse any further inquiry, thus never having a satisfied understanding.{{sfnp|Sri Aurobindo|1939|pp=7-11}} He recommends that the only way to reconcile the materialistic mind with the other truth would be to cross over the layers of inner consciousness either by objective analysis of life &amp; mind as to matter or by subjective synthesis and illumination, arrive at a state of the ultimate unity without denying the energy of the expressing multiplicity of the universe.{{sfnp|Sri Aurobindo|1939|p=9}}
He finds that the current World is in a state of [[Rationalism|rationalistic]] materialism, &amp; finds that this rationalistic movement has served human kind in a positive way, by purifying intellect from the [[dogma]]s, [[superstitions]] clearing path to a better advancement of Humanity.{{sfnp|Sri Aurobindo|1939|p=10}} Sri Aurobindo finds that root of this Scientific movement to be a search for knowledge, due to this root the movement would not come to a halt and its progress is a sure sign that it would carry forward in reaching the other part of knowledge which [[vedantins]] had found in a different way.{{sfnp|Sri Aurobindo|1939|p=13}}

'''The Ascetics''' : would only accept [[Ātman (Hinduism)|spirit/Atman]] and terming the remaining as mechanical unintelligent substance or energy, leading to believing the reality to be an illusion of senses.{{sfnp|Sri Aurobindo|1939|p=7}} Sri Aurobindo finds when the mind retracts from external activities and has experience of silence, a powerful convincing experience that only the pure self or non-being is real leads them to disregard the outer world. 
he finds this as an revolt of spirit on matter which was made famous by [[Buddhism]] affirming that it is impossible  to find a solution in the [[Reality|world]] which is termed to be dual in nature, but to escape into [[Nirvana]], [[Brahmaloka]] or [[Goloka]] as beyond. He finds that this approach is slowly coming to an end and had its importance as the part of evolution, but is quite different than what was present in Vedic period.{{sfnp|Sri Aurobindo|1939|pp=13-28}}

''' Integral yoga's take on Reality''':
Sri Aurobindo finds that a compromise between the two approaches would be a bargain &amp; would not be a true reconciliation, but only a unified Spirit &amp; Matter would be a basis for Integral yoga's  path to understanding of reality.{{sfnp|Sri Aurobindo|1939|p=25}} He finds the [[Anatta|non being]] at one end which seems opposite to the manifested universe are not opposites which would deny other's existence, but rather are different states of reality with opposite affirmations. Sri Aurobindo finds that the highest experience of the Reality to be a conscious Existence, a supreme Intelligence, Force and a self-existent Bliss; He finds a liberated intelligence &amp; experience would bring about this highest understanding of the reality.{{sfnp|Sri Aurobindo|1939|p=32}}

=== Humanity and its purpose ===

====Involution====
{{Main|Involution (esoterism)}}

Involution is the extension of Spirit, the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]], to create a universe of separate forms. Being manifests itself as a multiplicity of forms, meanwhile becoming lost in the inconscience of matter.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo (1977), ''The Life Divine'' Bk I, Ch.11-12&lt;/ref&gt; The first manifestation of Spirit in the process of involution is as ''[[Satchitananda]]'', and then as Supermind, the intermediate link between the higher (Spirit) and lower (matter, life, and mind) nature.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo (1977), ''The Life Divine''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Aurobindo the world is a differentiated unity. It is a manifold oneness, that generates an infinite variety of lifeforms and substances. The lifeforms and substances are stretched out on a wide range, from physical matter to a pure form of spiritual being, where the subject becomes fully aware of itself as spirit:{{sfnp|Aurobindo|1939|p=254-255|ps=}}  
* [[Matter|Material]]- a submerged consciousness concealed in its action and losing itself in the form.
* [[Vitalism|Vital]]- an emerging consciousness, a consciousness half delivered out of its original imprisonment which has become of vital craving and satisfaction or repulsion.     
* [[Mind|Mental]]- an emerged consciousness reflecting fact of life in a mental sense, perceptive and ideative. It modifies the internal and attempts to modify conformably the external existence of the being.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|1939|p=221|ps=}}

Above Mind proper lie various higher levels of Mind, which ascend toward Spirit.

==== Evolution ====
Through evolution Spirit rediscoveres itself as Spirit. Evolution follows a developmental trajectory from the original inconscience of matter into life, to mind, and then to spiritualized mind, culminating in [[Supermind (Integral yoga)|The Supermind]] or Truth Consciousness.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|1939|p=254-255|ps=}}&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo (1977), ''The Life Divine'' bk II, ch.27-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolution is [[Teleology|teleological]],{{sfn|Giri|2014|p=59}}{{sfn|Miśra|1998|p=414}} since the developing entity contains within itself already the totality toward which it develops.{{sfn|Miśra|1998|p=414}} It is not a mechanistic or deterministic teleology,{{sfn|Miśra|1998|p=414}}{{sfn|Giri|2014|p=59}} but a "manifestation of all the possibilities inherent in the total movement."{{sfn|Giri|2014|p=59}}

==== The goal of integral yoga ====
The goal of Integral yoga is to become aware of the Divine, to integrate the physical, mental and spiritual aspects of ourselves, and to manifest the Divine at earth.{{sfn|Vrinte|1996|p=140}} According to Sri Aurobindo, all life is Yoga, while Yoga as a [[sadhana]] is a methodised effort towards self-perfection, which brings to expression the latent, hidden potentialities of being. Success in this effort unifies the human individual with the universal and transcendental Existence.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|1996|p=6}} Integral yoga reunites "the infinite in the finite, the timeless in the temporal and the transcendent with the immanent.

===Three types of being ===
Sri Aurobindo discerns three types of being, namely the Outer being, the Inner being, and the Psychic Being.

====The Outer Being====
The Outer Being includes the physical, vital and mental levels of Being, which characterises our everyday consciousness and experience. It includes several levels of the subconscient: a mental subconscient, a vital subconscient, and a physical subconscient, down to the material Inconscient.&lt;ref group=web name="Satprem" /&gt; Integral Yoga involves going beyond this surface consciousness to the larger life of the Inner Being, which is more open to spiritual realisation.

====The Inner or Subliminal Being====
The Inner Being, or Subliminal,{{sfn|Sharma|1991|p=63}}{{sfn|Vrinte|2002|p=235}} includes the inner realms or aspects of the physical, vital and mental being. They have a larger, subtler, freer consciousness than that of the everyday consciousness. Its realisation is essential for any higher spiritual realisation.

The Inner Being is also transitional between the surface or Outer Being and the Psychic or Inmost Being. By doing yoga practice ([[sadhana]]), the inner consciousness is being opened, and life turns away from the outward to the inward. The inner consciousness becomes more real than the outer consciousness, and becomes a peace, happiness and closeness to the Divine.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo, ''Letters on Yoga'', 3rd ed. 1971, p.307&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Psychic Being====
The Psychic Being is Sri Aurobindo's term for the Personal [[Spiritual evolution|Evolving]] [[Soul]], the principle of [[The Divine|Divine]] spirit in every individual.{{refn|group=note|According to [[Mirra Alfassa|The Mother]], the term "Psychic" or Psychic Being is derived from the [[Occultism|occult]] [[Kabbalah|kabbalistic]] teachings of [[Max Theon|Max Théon]].&lt;ref name="The Life Divine' p. 227"&gt;Sri Aurobindo (1977), ''The Life Divine'' p.&amp;nbsp;227 note&lt;/ref&gt; Sri Aurobindo distinguishes between the Psychic Being as being defined in his Integral Yoga, and the ordinary meaning of "psychic," which refers more to [[Psychology|psychological]] phenomena, or to [[paranormal]] phenomena, which are connected with the subtle physical layers.&lt;ref name="The Life Divine' p. 227"&gt;Sri Aurobindo (1977), ''The Life Divine'' p.&amp;nbsp;227 note&lt;/ref&gt;
}} The Psychic is the "Innermost Being",{{refn|group=note|[[Amal Kiran]]&lt;ref&gt;Craig Hamilton [http://www.auroville.com/vijnana/spiritual/soulpower.htm The Miraculous Power of the Soul - A meeting with Amal Kiran, Pondicherry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611012237/http://www.auroville.com/Vijnana/spiritual/soulpower.htm |date=2012-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} the permanent being in us that stands behind and supports the physical, vital and mental principles. It "uses mind, life and body as its instruments," undergoing their fate yet also transcending them.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo (1977), ''The Life Divine'' p.&amp;nbsp;891&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Integral Yoga]] the goal is to move inward and discover the Psychic Being, which then can bring about a transformation of the outer nature. This transformation of the outer being or ego by the Psychic is called Psychicisation; it is one of the three necessary stages in the realisation of the Supramental consciousness. This Psychic transformation is the decisive movement that enables a never-ending progress in life, through the power of connecting to one's inner spirit or Divine Essence. The Psychic begins its evolution completely veiled and hidden, but grows through successive lifetimes, and gradually exerts a greater influence, taking on the role of spiritual Guide.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo (1977), ''The Life Divine'' pp.&amp;nbsp;891–4&lt;/ref&gt;

====Central being====
'''Central Being''' refers to the [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] and eternal [[spirit]], as opposed to the incarnate and [[spiritual evolution|evolving]] [[Soul]], which he calls the [[Psychic Being]]. Sometimes it refers to both of them together as the essential spiritual core of the being.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Letters on Yoga]]'' vol.I under "Planes and Parts of Being" (pp.&amp;nbsp;265ff in the 3rd ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; The Central Being "presides over the different births one after the other but is itself unborn" (ibid p.&amp;nbsp;269). This transcendent Central Being or Spirit is also designated as the [[Jiva]] or [[Paramatman#Advaita|Jivatman]], although the meaning of these terms in Sri Aurobindo's philosophy differs greatly from that of much of conventional [[Vedanta]] (especially [[Advaita Vedanta]])

The levels of being ascend from the inconscient to the Supermind.

===Inconscient===

Inconscient Matter is the lowest level of involution.{{sfn|Pani|2007|p=132}}{{sfn|The Mother|1961|p=199}} Spirit is still present in the inconscient:{{sfn|Pani|2007|p=211}} "The Inconscient is the Superconscient's sleep."&lt;ref group=web name="Satprem" /&gt; The Inconscient is also the instrument of the Superconsciousness which has created the Universe.{{sfn|Pani|2007|p=297}} According to Satprem, the Inconscient lies at the bottom of the physical subconscient,&lt;ref group=web name="Satprem" /&gt; and "life emerged [...] at the border between the material inconscient and the physical consciousness [...] in our body.&lt;ref group=web name="Satprem" /&gt;

===Subconscient and subtle or subliminal conscient===

The physical, vital and mental levels of being contain both a subconscient and a subtle or subliminal part.{{sfn|Sharma|1992|p=61-63}}

====The subconscient====

The subconscient parts are the submerged parts. It contains "obstinate [[Samskara (Indian philosophy)|samskaras]], impressions, associations, fixed notions, habitual reactions formed by the past."{{sfn|Sharma|1992|p=61}} According to Satprem, there are several levels of the subconscient, corresponding with the different levels of our being: a mental subconscient, a vital subconscient, and a physical subconscient, down to the material Inconscient.&lt;ref group=web name="Satprem"&gt;[http://www.aurobindo.ru/workings/satprem/adventure_of_consciousness_e.htm Satprem, ''Aurobindo, or the adventure of consciousness.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Aurobindo, the body is partly a creation of the inconscient or subconscient.{{sfn|Pani|2007|p=297}} According to The Mother, the ordinary, false consciousness, which is common to material body-consciousness, is derived from the subconscient and the inconscient.{{sfn|The Mother|1961|p=50}} According to Aurobindo, the outer being depends on the subconscient, which hinders the spiritual progress.{{sfn|Sri Aurobindo|1988}} Only by living in the inner being can this obstacle be overcome.{{sfn|Sri Aurobindo|1988}}

According to Sharma, the subconscient is "the inconscient in the proces of becoming conscient."{{sfn|Sharma|1991|p=63}} It is a submerged part of the personality without waking consciousness, but which does receive impressions, and influences the conscious mind.{{sfn|Sharma|1991|p=61}} According to Sharma, it includes the [[unconscious mind]] which is described by psychologists like Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung,{{sfn|Sharma|1991|p=61}} though it includes much more than the unconscious of ([[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]]) psychology.{{refn|group=note|According to Pani, the inconscient is the same as the western psycho-analytic unconscious mind, while the subconsciousness is another layer of consciousness.{{sfn|Pani|2007|p=207}}}}

====The subtle or subliminal conscient====

The subtle or subliminal is the subtle, higher counterpart of the subconscient. According to Sharma, "it has an inner mind, an inner vital being, and an inner subtle physical being, wider than man's consciousness."{{sfn|Sharma|1991|p=63}} It can directly experience the Universal, and "it is the source of inspirations, intuitions, ideas, will [...] as well as [...] telepathy [and] clearvoyance."{{sfn|Sharma|1991|p=63}}

====Gross body ====
The gross body commonly referred to in yoga constitutes mainly of two parts the material physical body (anna[[kosha]]) and the nervous system normally refer to as vital vehicle (Prana kosha) in Integral yoga.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|1996|p=10-11}}

=====Physical=====
The Physical level refers to both the [[physical body]] and the body's [[consciousness]]. The body is just as conscious as the vital and mental parts of the being, only it is a different type of consciousness. The Physical not only shades upwards to higher ontological levels, but also downwards into the Subconscient.{{refn|group=note|The Physical can be subdivided into finer sub-grades:
* the ''Physical Proper'' or pure body consciousness, which represents the consciousness of the external physical body itself.
* the ''Vital Physical'' or ''Nervous Being'' (which seems to be equivalent to the [[Etheric body]] of western [[esotericism]], and hence pertains to one of the [[Subtle body|subtle bodies]])
* the ''Mental Physical'' (similar to the Physical Mind - see "[[Mental (Sri Aurobindo)|Mental]]")
* the ''True physical being'' - is the [[Purusha]] of the physical level, which is like the Inner Physical larger than the surface body consciousness and in touch with the a larger spiritual consciousness.
* the ''Inner physical'' - the physical component of the [[inner being]], which is wider and more plastic than the outer physical body.  This is also called the [[subtle physical]]}}

The Subtle physical is [[Sri Aurobindo]]'s term for a subtler aspect of the physical nature. This has many qualities not found in the gross physical nature.  In ''[[Mother's Agenda|The Agenda]]'', [[Mirra Alfassa|The Mother]] often refers to it. It might be compared to the [[etheric body]] and [[etheric plane|plane]], or even the [[astral body]] and [[astral plane|plane]]. The term "subtle physical" is used to distinguish it from gross (''sthula'') or outer material physical.{{refn|group=note|Aurobindo: "By the gross physical is meant the earthly and bodily physical - as experienced by the outward sense-mind and senses. But that is not the whole of Matter.  There is a subtle physical also with a subtler consciousness in it which can, for instance, go to a distance from the body and yet feel and be aware of things in a not merely mental or vital way.&lt;br&gt;...the subtle physical has a freedom, plasticity, intensity, power, colour, wide and manifold play (there are thousands of things there that are not here) of which, as yet, we have no possibility on earth."&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo, Letters on Yoga part 1, section v&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=====Vital=====
The Vital level of the being refers to the [[Vitalism|life force]], but also to the various passions, desires, feelings, emotions, affects, compulsions, and likes and dislikes. These strongly determine human motivation and action through desire and enthusiasm.

Unlike Western [[psychology]], in which mind, emotions, instincts, and consciousness are all lumped together, Sri Aurobindo strongly distinguishes between the "Vital" and the "Mental" faculties.

In addition to the individual Vital faculty, Sri Aurobindo refers to a Vital Plane or Vital world, which would seem to be partly equivalent to the [[Astral Plane]] of popular [[occultism]] and [[New Age]] thought.

====Mind or Mental being====

Mind proper is the conceptual and [[Cognition|cognitive]] [[mind]]. Mind is a subordinate process of the Supermind.{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=42}} It is the intermediary stage between the Divine and the mundane life.{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=40-41}} It works by measuring and dividing reality, and has lost sight of the Divine.{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=41}} It is the seat of ignorance, yet it is still capable of an upward ascent toward the Divine.{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=43}}

Unlike Western psychology, in which mind and consciousness are considered the same, Sri Aurobindo strongly distinguishes between the "Mental" and the "Vital" (emotional) faculties, as well as between Mind and pure Consciousness. Sri Aurobindo in part bases his concept of the Mental on his reading of the [[Taittiriya Upanishad]], the mental being (or perhaps just the Mental Purusha) is the ''mano-maya-atma'' - the self made of mind (''manas'').

For Sri Aurobindo, Mind or the Mental being is not simple and uniform, but consists itself of various strata and subdivisions, which act at different levels of being. These various faculties are described or variously referred to, usually in obliquely or in passing, in some of his books, including ''[[Savitri (book)|Savitri]]'', which has poetic references to many types of Mind.&lt;ref&gt;Jyoti and Prem Sobel 1984 pp.&amp;nbsp;152–62&lt;/ref&gt; In his letters answering questions from disciples, Sri Aurobindo summarises the characteristics of the various levels of Mind.&lt;ref&gt;Aurobindo, ''[[Letters on Yoga]]'' vol. I pp.&amp;nbsp;324–5&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|A small but popular book by Jyoti and Prem Sobel, ''The Hierarchy of Minds'', comes closest to a systematic coverage of an Aurobindonian noetology by gathering all of Sri Aurobindo's references and quotes on the subject of "Mind" and arranging these according to the type of Mind. These various Minds and Mental principles of being include:&lt;ref&gt;Jyoti and Prem Sobel, ''The Hierarchy of Minds''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''''Physical Mind'''''
* ''The Mechanical Mind'' is a much lower action of the mental physical which when left to itself can only repeat the same ideas and record the reflexes of the physical consciousness in its contact with outward life and things.
* ''Mind in the physical or mental physical'' mentalises the experiences of outward life and things, sometimes very cleverly, but it does not go beyond that, unlike the externalising mind which deals with these things from the perspective of reason and its own higher intelligence.
* ''Physical Mind'' - refers to either or both the Externalising Mind and the Mental in the Physical; it is limited to a physical or [[Materialism|materialistic]] perspective, and cannot go beyond that, unless enlightened from above.
* ''Mind of Light'' - according to [[Mirra Alfassa|The Mother]] this is the Physical Mind receiving the [[Supermind (Integral yoga)|supramental light]] and thus being able to act directly in the [[Physical (Sri Aurobindo)|Physical]].&lt;ref&gt;The Mother, 1980, pp.&amp;nbsp;63–64&lt;/ref&gt;
'''''Vital Mind'''''
* ''Vital Mind'' - a mediator between the vital emotions, desires, and so on the mental proper. It is limited by the vital view and feeling of things, and expresses the desires, feelings, ambitions,and other active tendencies of the vital in mental forms, such as daydreams and imaginations of greatness, happiness, and so on. As with the Externalising Mind, Sri Aurobindo associates it with the Vishuddha or Throat Chakra
'''''Mind proper'''''
* ''Mind Proper'' - is free-fold, consisting of Thinking Mind, dynamic Mind, externalising Mind.  It constitutes the sum of one's thoughts, opinions, ideas, and values, which guide conscious thinking, conceptualizing and decision-making processes, and is transformed, widened, and spiritualised through the practice of [[Integral Yoga]].
:* ''Thinking Mind'' - the highest aspect of the mind proper, concerned with ideas and knowledge in their own right.  It is equated with the [[Ajna|Ajna Chakra]]
:* ''Dynamic Mind'' - that aspect of the ordinary mind that puts out of mental forces for realisation, acting by the idea and by reason.  It is also equated with the Ajna or Brow center.
:* ''Externalising Mind'' - the most "external" part of the mind proper, concerned with the expression of ideas in speech, in life, or in any  form it can give.  It is equated with the [[Vishuddha|Vishuddha or Throat Chakra]]
'''''Higher Mind'''''
* ''Higher Mind'' - the first and lowest of the spiritual mental grades, lying above the normal mental level.
* ''Spiritual Mind'' - either the spiritualised mind, or a general term for levels of mind above the normal mental level (the "Mind Proper").
* ''Inner mind'' - the mental component of the Inner Being, which lies behind the surface mind or ordinary consciousness and can only be directly experienced by [[sadhana]]
* ''True mental being'' - is the [[Purusha]] of the mental level freed from the error and ignorance of the lower [[Prakriti]] and open to the knowledge and guidance above.
* ''Psychic Mind'' - a movement of the mind in which the [[Psychic Being]] predominates; the mind turned towards the Divine}}

Above mind proper lie various higher individual levels of mind, namely the Higher Mind, Illumined Mind, Intuitive Mind and Overmind, which ascend toward the Spirit, and provide a higher and more inclusive vision of reality:
* '''Higher Mind''' is the realm of Truth-thought. It can hold a wide range of knowledge in one vision and an integral whole.{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=43}}{{refn|group=note|Compare Ken Wilber's Centaur or vision-logic; see [[Integral theory (Ken Wilber)#Levels or stages]]}} It receives [[Illuminationism|illumination]] from the Illumined Mind,{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=45}} and is not dependent on the limited knowledge of the senses.{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=43}} It is also capable of transforming the lower realms of body and mind, effectuating change sof habit and life.{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=43}} Nevertheless, it is still a state of thought, in contrast to Illumined Mind, which is a state of vision and spiritual insight.{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=45}}
* '''Illumined''' Mind is the mind of sight and vision. It transformes the Higher Mind by providing it a direct vision.{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=47}}
* '''Intuition''' provides the illumination of thought and vision to the Higher Mind and the Illumined Mind.{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=47}} Mundane mind may experience intuition too, but in the higher realms of mind it becomes more frequent an dstable.{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=47}}
* '''Overmind''' is the [[Cosmic Consciousness]].{{sfn|Chakravorty|1991|p=49}} It is the plane of [[deity|Gods]]. Overmental plane is the highest consciousness one can achieve without transcending the mental system. Beyond overmind are the planes of [[Supermind (Integral thought)|Supermind]] or unity-consciousness.{{refn|group=note|A detailed description of the Overmind is provided in Book I ch.28, and Book II ch.26, of Sri Aurobindo's philosophical opus ''[[The Life Divine]]''.}}

====Supermind====
{{main|Supermind (Integral yoga)}}
Supermind is the infinite unitary Truth Consciousness or Truth-Idea beyond the three lower [[Plane (cosmology)|planes]] of [[Matter]], [[Life]], and [[Mind]]. Supermind is the dynamic form of [[Satchitananda|Sachchidananda]] (Being-Consciousness-Bliss), and the necessary mediator or link between the transcendent Sacchidananda and the creation.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo (1977), ''Life Divine'' Book I, ch.14-16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations of the present being==
Humans are stuck between matter and Spirit,{{sfnp|Aurobindo|1996|p=210|ps=}} due to the habits of personality and partial awareness, which arise from Ignorance.

=== Personality  ===

Humans are accustomed to respond to certain vibrations more than other. These customs develop into one's desire, pain, feelings, which are all a set of habits. This crystallised set of habits becomes one's personality. This is normally believed to be "self". The appearance of stable personality is given by constant repetition and recurrence of the same vibrations and formations.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|1996|p=210|ps=}}

===Three basic difficulties for mankind===

According to Aurobindo, humans face three basic problems:
# '''Partial [[Self-awareness]]''': humans are only aware of a small part about themselves. They are aware of the surface of mentality, physical being, and life, and not of the larger and more potent [[subconscious mind]] and hidden life impulses. 
# '''Partial [[awareness]] of other [[beings]]''': humans create a rough mental construction of their fellow beings. Their understanding is created by a mental knowledge, which is imperfect, and subjected to denial and frustration. This partial awareness can be overcome by a conscious unity. This unity can only be achieved from Supermind.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|1939|p=227|ps=}}
# '''A division between Force and consciousness in evolution''': matter, life and mind are often warring with each other. Materialists try to resolve this war by submitting oneself to the mortality of our being, while ascetics have tried to reject earthly life. A true solution may lie in finding the principle beyond mind, thereby overcoming the mortality of our existence.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|1939|p=228|ps=}}

===Ignorance===

The fundamental cause of falsehood, error and evil is Ignorance. Ignorance is a self-limiting knowledge, which arises with exclusive concentration in a single field. According to Aurobindo, human notion of good, bad &amp; evil are uncertain and relative.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|1939|p=622|ps=}}

===Practices===
Unlike other [[Yoga]] practices ''Integral yoga'' does not propose any kind of physical asanas, breathing techniques or external movements. It is more [[psychological]] in nature, with internal reflection and self-analysis &amp; correction as main tools of development .

The main practices or approaches are divided into {{sfnp|Aurobindo|1996|pp=2-30}} 
*  The yoga of divine work (yoga through ones work )
*  The yoga of Integral Knowledge ( Yoga through analysis, observation &amp; knowledge) 
*  The Yoga of Divine love ( Commonly referred to as [[Bhakti yoga]] or [[Love of God|love of god]])  
*  The Yoga of Self-Perfection (referred to as a Synthetic yoga or the triple way ) {{sfnp|Aurobindo|1996|p=611}}

==Yogic Practise==
===The Yoga of Self-Perfection===
====The Triple Transformation====
The limitations of the present being can be overcome by the Triple transformation, the process in which the lower nature is transformed into the divine nature. It consists of the inward psychicisation by which the [[sadhaka|sadhak]] gets in contact with the inner divine principle or Psychic Being; the spiritual transformation or spiritualisation; and the Supramentalisation of the entire being.{{refn|group=note|This is described in ''[[The Life Divine]]'' part 2, ch.25, and ''[[Letters on Yoga]]'' part 4, section 1.}}

=====Psychicisation=====
Psychicisation is a turn [[Inner being|inward]], so that one realises the [[psychic being]], the psychic personality or Divine [[Soul]], in the core of one's being. The Divine Soul serves as a spiritual Guide in the yoga, and enables one to transform the [[outer being]].&lt;ref&gt;Aurobindo (1977), ''[[The Life Divine]]'' book II - chapter 25&lt;/ref&gt; It may also help avoid the dangers of the spiritual path. There is an [[intermediate zone]], a dangerous and misleading transitional [[spirituality|spiritual]] and pseudospiritual region between the ordinary consciousness and true spiritual realisation.&lt;ref name="intyoga.online.fr"&gt;[http://intyoga.online.fr/intzone.htm Sri Aurobindo's Letters on Yoga - The Intermediate Zone&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychisiation consists of three methods. In "consecration" one opens oneself to the Force before engaging in an activity. "Moving to the Depths" (or "concentration") is a movement away from the surface existence to a deeper existence within. "Surrender" means offering all one's work, one's life to the Divine Force and Intent.&lt;ref&gt;''Synthesis of Yoga'' Part I ch. II-III&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Letters on Yoga'' vol. II pp.585ff (3rd ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; Guided by the evolving divine soul within, the sadhak moves away from ego, ignorance, finiteness, and the limitations of the [[outer being]]. It is thanks to this guidance by the Divine Soul that the [[sadhaka|sadhak]] can avoid the pitfalls of the spiritual path.

=====Spiritualisation=====
As a result of the Psychicisation, light, peace, and power descend into the body, transforming all of its parts, physical, vital, and mental. This is the Spiritual transformation, or Spiritualisation, the concretisation of the larger spiritual consciousness. It is equivalent to [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|"enlightenment"]], as found in [[Vedanta]] and [[Buddhism]].

=====Intermediate zone=====
{{Main|Intermediate zone|Spiritual bypass}}

Aurobindo asserted that spiritual aspirants may pass through an intermediate zone where experiences of force, inspiration, illumination, light, joy, expansion, power, and freedom from normal limits are possible. These can become associated with personal aspirations, ambitions, notions of spiritual fulfilment and yogic siddhi, and even be falsely interpreted as full spiritual realisation. One can pass through this zone, and the associated spiritual dangers, without harm by perceiving its real nature, and seeing through the misleading experiences. Those who go astray in it may end in a spiritual disaster, or may remain stuck there and adopt some half-truth as the whole truth, or become an instrument of lesser powers of these transitional planes. According to Aurobindo, this happens to many sadhaks and yogis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://intyoga.online.fr/intzone.htm Sri Aurobindo's Letters on Yoga - The Intermediate Zone]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greylodge.org/occultreview/glor_009/intermediate.htm Grey Lodge Occult Review :: Issue #9 :: The Intermediate Zone] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012141007/http://greylodge.org/occultreview/glor_009/intermediate.htm |date=2007-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Supramentalisation=====
Supramentalisation is the realisation of the [[Supermind (Integral thought)|Supermind]], or Supramental consciousness, and the resulting transformation of the entire being. Psychicisation and spirtualisation serve as necessary prerequisites for the Supramentalisation of the entire being.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo, ''The Synthesis of Yoga'', pp.281-2&lt;/ref&gt;

The supramental transformation is the final stage in the integral yoga, enabling the birth of a new individual, fully formed by the supramental power. Such individuals would be the forerunners of a new supra-humanity, grounded in truth-consciousness. All aspects of division and ignorance of consciousness, at the vital and mental levels, would be overcome, and replaced with a unity of consciousness at every plane. And even the physical body transformed and divinised. A new supramental species would then emerge, living a supramental, [[gnostic being|gnostic, divine life]] on earth.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo (1977), ''The Life Divine'' book II ch.27-28&lt;/ref&gt;

Aurobindo describes several results and different stages depicting the stages of development in integral yoga, called together the ''sapta chatushtaya'', "seven quadrates."&lt;ref group=web name="SC"&gt;[https://auromere.wordpress.com/sapta-chatushthaya/ Integral Yoga of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother, ''Sapta Chatushtaya'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.uprs.edu/upr-blog/featuresspotlight/press-releases/academic-dean-at-the-university-of-philosophical-research-publishes-new-book/ Dr. Debashish Banerji, ''Seven Quartets of Becoming: A Transformative Yoga Psychology Based on the Diaries of Sri Aurobindo''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004113644/http://www.uprs.edu/upr-blog/featuresspotlight/press-releases/academic-dean-at-the-university-of-philosophical-research-publishes-new-book/ |date=2015-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Aurobindo received these instructions as a series of mantras while he was imprisoned in Alipore prison.

* [[vijnana]] (knowledge), which consists of [[jnanam]] (knowledge), trikaladrsti (knowledge of past, present and future), [[ashtasiddhi]] (eight powers), and [[samadhi]] (absorption);
* Sharira (body), which consists of arogyam (health), [[Transcendental Meditation|utthapana]] (levitation, being free from gravity and physical powers), saundaryam (beauty), [[Ānanda (Hindu philosophy)|vividhananda]] (bliss);
* Karma (divine work), which consists of [[Krishna]] (avatar of Vishnu), [[Kali]] (the Goddess), [[kama]] (divine delight), and [[Karma yoga|Karma]] (divine action);
* Brahma, the realization of [[Brahman]]; 
* Siddhi (realization), which consists of [[shuddhi]] (purification), [[Moksha|mukti]] (liberation), bhukti (enjoyment), and [[siddhi]] (realisation of yogic powers).

==Influence==
Aurobindo had a strong influence on [[Ken Wilber]]'s [[Integral theory (Ken Wilber)|integral theory]] of [[Spiritual evolution|spiritual development]].{{sfn|Vrinte|2002}} Wilber's Causal and Ultimate stages closely resemble Aurobindo's higher mental stages, but Wilber lumps together levels of Being, types of Being and developmental stages.

The '''International Religious Liberty Association''' ('''IRLA''') is a non-sectarian and non-political organization promoting religious freedom. It was originally organized by the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] leaders in 1893 to campaign for [[freedom of religion|religious freedom]] for all when the danger of restrictions from [[blue laws]] became apparent. Its headquarters are in [[Silver Spring, Maryland|Silver Spring]], [[Maryland]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="About Us"&gt;[http://www.irla.org/aboutus/index.html About Us]. International Religious Liberty Association. Retrieved 2009-08-21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission statement==
The IRLA's mission statement says: "The International Religious Liberty Association will disseminate the principles of religious liberty throughout the world; defend and safeguard the civil right of all people to worship or not to worship, to adopt a religion or belief of their choice, to manifest their religious convictions in observance, promulgation, and teaching, subject only to the respect for the equivalent rights of others; support the right of religious organizations to operate freely in every country by their establishing and owning charitable or educational institutions; and organize local, regional, and national chapters as well as seminars, and congresses."

The '''Leipzig Human Rights Award''' is an honor given by the European-American Citizens Committee for Human Rights and Religious Freedom in the USA, which recognizes "efforts towards [[human rights]] and [[freedom of expression]] in the USA" and actions against what the organization refers to as "human rights violations by the [[totalitarian]] [[Scientology]]."&lt;ref name="cisar"&gt;{{cite news | last =Cisar | first =Joe |  title =Introduction from American Co-Moderator | work =Leipzig Award |    date =June 3, 2000 | url =http://www.leipzig-award.org/englisch/preisverleihung_2000.htm | accessdate =  2007-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to 2001, the honor was known as the '''Alternative Charlemagne Award'''.&lt;ref name="cisar" /&gt;

Former [[Scientology controversy|Scientology critic]] [[Bob Minton]] received the first award in 2000.  Other notable recipients of the award include former German Federal Minister of Labor [[Norbert Blüm]], former [[Secretary of State]] of [[France]], [[Alain Vivien]] and [[Operation Clambake]] founder [[Andreas Heldal-Lund]].  [[Psychologist]] [[Margaret Singer]] was selected at the 2003 ceremony to be the 2004 Award recipient, but she died shortly thereafter and no award was given in that year.

==History==

===Formation===
Originally begun as the "Alternative Charlemagne Award," the honor was formed as a counterpoint to the [[Karlspreis|Charlemagne Award]] given to [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] in 2000.&lt;ref name="winkel2000"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Winkel   | first =Achim  |  title =Alternative Charlemagne Award for Scientology Critic from the USA  | work =Badische Neueste Nachrichten   |    date =May 31, 2000  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Presented in [[Aachen, Germany]], the Charlemagne Award, or Karlspreis, "honors individuals who promote democracy, human rights and the common values of Europe."&lt;ref name="singer2004" /&gt;  The original title of the Leipzig Human Rights Award was so-named as a way of criticizing the relationship between the [[Church of Scientology]] and the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton Administration]], which granted Scientology [[tax exemption]] status during Clinton's term in office.&lt;ref name="evers2000"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Evers    | first =Bernd   |  title =Scientology: Criticism of the Charlemagne Award for U.S. President Clinton  | work =Neue Bildpost  | pages =Nr. 23, Page 1  |   date =June 1, 2000  |  accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The European-American Citizens Committee for Human Rights and Religious Freedom in the USA was formed in 1997, and includes committee members from [[Germany]], the [[United States]], [[England]], [[Austria]], [[Russia]] and [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name="freie2003" /&gt;  The Committee opposes "physical and psychological abuse of humans under the pretext of religion."&lt;ref name="freie2003" /&gt;  The organization notes that their criticism of the United States for "its failure to confront Scientology’s human rights abuses while promoting the cult around the world" has made the Award controversial, and states that all past recipients of the Award have been targeted by the Church of Scientology as [[Suppressive person]]s, and subjected to the Church's [[Fair game (Scientology)|Fair Game policy]].&lt;ref name="singer2004" /&gt;  Award recipients do not receive financial compensation as part of the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =Distinction for Ex-Minister Blüm  | work =[[Bild-Zeitung]]  |    date =May 31, 2001  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =Leipzig Human Rights Award for French Cult Commissioner  | work =EPD Press agency|    date =May 11, 2002  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization's charter cites its concern over the deaths of [[Lisa McPherson]] and [[Patrice Vic]], and states "We wish to express our support for the American people and the American government in ending human rights violations against US citizens and other people, committed by the Scientology Organization."&lt;ref name="charter"&gt;{{cite news  | last =European-American Citizens Committee for Human Rights and Religious Freedom in the USA |   title =Charter | work =Leipzig Award |    date = | url =http://www.leipziger-preis.de/englisch/grundsatztext.htm  | accessdate =  2007-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, the Leipzig Human Rights Award charter calls on the United States to reestablish "true freedom of life, speech, religion, personality and pursuit of happiness," and emphasizes [[freedom of speech]], freedom for members of an organization to leave that organization without fear of retribution, freedom from [[blackmail]] through materials obtained during spiritual counseling, and calls on the United States for full disclosure of "secret agreements" between the [[Internal Revenue Service]] and the Church of Scientology.&lt;ref name="charter" /&gt;

===Award recipients===
Bob Minton, at the time a prominent critic of Scientology, received the first award in 2000 as the Alternative Charlemagne Award.&lt;ref name="berliner2000"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =HONORED: Alternative Charlemagne Award to U.S. American  | work =[[Berliner Zeitung]]  |    date =June 5, 2000  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In her speech at the event, [[Scientology Task Force of the Hamburg Interior Authority]] Commissioner [[Ursula Caberta]] cited Minton's recognition of "what dangers could arise for people and liberal democracy from Scientology."&lt;ref name="berliner2000" /&gt;  Minton had provided former members of Scientology with financial and legal assistance after they had left the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =Robert S. Minton  | work =[[Frankfurter Rundschau]]  |    date =June 3, 2000  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the awards ceremony, Sect Commissioner of the Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg Thomas Gandow stated "By holding this ceremony, we intended to give a sign that, in spite of the Clinton administration, there are people in America who think differently and who do not swim with the Scientology tide."&lt;ref name="wiarda" /&gt;  Gandow cited Minton's actions as chairman of the [[Lisa McPherson Trust]] helping former members of Scientology make claims against the organization in court.&lt;ref name="wiarda" /&gt;  The Church of Scientology was critical of Minton being honored, and formed its own organization opposed to the Leipzig Human Rights Award, and on May 29, 2000 sent letters to bishops of the [[Evangelical Church Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia|Evangelical State Churches in Berlin-Brandenburg]] and [[Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Saxony|Saxony]].&lt;ref name="schade2000"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Schade   | first =Thomas   |  title =Dispute involves millionaire Minton: A citizens committee squares off with Scientology in Leipzig and gives out the first Alternative Charlemagne Award  | work =Sächs. Zeitung Dresden  |    date =June 2, 2000  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The letter stated that Sect Commissioner Thomas Gandow should be dismissed, and said that the Saxon state church should "distance itself from the [Awards] procedure."&lt;ref name="schade2000" /&gt;  In response, Gandow stated that Clinton had received the Charlemagne Award despite his affair with [[Monica Lewinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =Gandow:  No criticism of Clinton's life-style  | work =Sächs. Zeitung Dresden  |    date =June 3, 2000  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The awards ceremony took place at the old stock exchange in the Old City of Leipzig.&lt;ref name="taz2000"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =Alternative Charlemagne Award: Struggling with the sect   | work =[[die tageszeitung]]  |    date =May 27, 2000  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The award given to Minton was presented as a sculpture of the [[St. Nicholas Church, Leipzig]], and was created by Leipzig artist Ruediger Bartels.&lt;ref name="bild2000"&gt;{{cite news | last =Staff |   title =First Alternative Charlemagne Award goes to American Scientology Critic | work =[[Bild-Zeitung|Bild]] |    date =June 5, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last =Staff |   title =Alternative Charlemagne Award for Robert Minton | work =Leipziger Volkszeitung  | pages =2  |   date =June 3, 2000  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The award presentation was held on June 3, 2000, one day after the presentation of the official Charlemagne Award to President Bill Clinton by Aachen Mayor [[Jürgen Linden]].&lt;ref name="wiarda"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Wiarda  | first =Jan-Martin  |  title =Scientology: Alternative Charlemagne Award for sect opponent  | work =[[Der Tagesspiegel]]  |    date =June 3, 2000  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scholz2000"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Scholz   | first =Ernst-Gerhardt  |  title =The new uprising for Scientology  | work =Hamburg Abendblatt  |    date =June 2, 2000  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former German Federal Minister of Labor Norbert Blüm was honored with the 2001 Leipzig Human Rights Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =Human Rights Award for Blüm  | work =Bremer Nachrichten  |    date =June 10, 2001  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Blüm was recognized because he had "championed human rights and religious freedom in the discussion with the totalitarian Scientology Organization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =Blüm receiving "Alternative Charlemagne Award 2001" Leipzig, Germany  | work =Berliner Zeitung   |    date = February 26, 2001  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Award again contained a picture of Leipzig's St. Nicholas Church, and Blüm was presented with the Award at a ceremony in Leipzig at a site near the [[Leipzig Trade Fair]] on June 10, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =Norbert Blüm receives "Alternative Charlemagne Award" for human rights  | work =[[Deutsche Presse-Agentur]]  |    date =February 25, 2001  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leipziger2001" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =Blüm receives Human Rights Award in Leipzig  | work =freiepresse  |   publisher =Chemnitzer Verlag und Druck GmbH &amp; Co. KG | date =June 4, 2001  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interview with the ''[[junge Welt]]'' on June 11, 2001, Blüm was asked why it takes courage to be a politician critical of the Scientology, and he cited actions the Church of Scientology had taken against him: "Scientology acts on people's fears. For instance they threatened me by saying they would distribute their dossier on me to television. They've called me all kinds of names in their newspaper: the "Rasputin" of politics, for example."&lt;ref name="junge2001"&gt;{{cite news  | last =Lehmann | first = Anna |  title = "Congratulations Mr. Blüm, on your well deserved award of recognition": How should one deal with Imperialists? jW speaks with human rights award winner Norbert Blüm (CDU) | work =[[junge Welt]]  |    date =June 11, 2001  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Blüm also stated in the interview that he did not support a ban on Scientology in Germany, but rather sought to foster the distribution of information about the organization.&lt;ref name="junge2001" /&gt;  He also compared what he saw as [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] similarities between the ideologies of [[L. Ron Hubbard]] and [[Adolf Hitler]], noting that he was not comparing the individuals themselves but rather their "totalitarian systems."&lt;ref name="junge2001" /&gt;  At the awards presentation, Thomas Gandow stated that Blüm was the only federal minister to date to criticize Scientology's "new totalitarianism."&lt;ref name="leipziger2001"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Friedrich | first =Andreas   |  title =Norbert Blüm receives Human Rights Award: Former federal minister honored in Leipzig for his involvement against the Scientology organization | work =Leipziger Volkszeitung  |    date =June 10, 2001  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gandow noted that Blüm had been criticized by [[Scientologist]]s in the press, and was sued in court for his actions critical of the organization.&lt;ref name="leipziger2001" /&gt;  The Scientology Church Germany, Inc. characterized the Award as a "cynical mockery of the most elementary basic rights and of the East German civil rights movement," and referred to the Awards Committee as "a dubious clan of fanatical religious discriminators."&lt;ref name="leipziger2001" /&gt;

The European-American Citizens Committee for Human Rights and Religious Freedom in the USA recognized former Secretary of State of France, Alain Vivien, with the third Leipzig Human Rights Award, on May 11, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Staff |   title =Frenchman Vivien honored with Leipzig Human Rights Award  | work =DDP News Agency  |    date =May 11, 2002  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frankfurter2002"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =Alain Vivien  | work =[[Frankfurter Rundschau]]  |    date =March 20, 2002  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Award was again presented in Leipzig at St. Nicholas Church, and a congratulatory speech was given by Bavaria's Interior Minister, [[Guenther Beckstein]].&lt;ref name="frankfurter2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mach2002"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Mach  | first =Marco  |  title =Leipzig honors Frenchman for his fight against cults  | work =Leipziger Volkszeitung  |    date =May 13, 2002  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Award was an image of the St. Nicholas Church, encased in glass.&lt;ref name="mach2002" /&gt;  At the time, Vivien was the President of the [[MIVILUDES|Interministerial Mission for Monitoring and Combatting Cultic Deviances]], a French [[government agency]].&lt;ref name="frankfurter2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mach2002" /&gt;  The Committee gave Vivien recognition for his work against "new totalitarian organizations", and spoke positively of his motivations which included his "aim to protect society"; Vivien was singled out for his "demonstration of public courage" while undergoing what the Committee referred to as "pressure from a new form of totalitarianism exercised by Scientology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Scientology|first=James R.|last=Lewis|page=314|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=0-19-533149-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his speech honoring Vivien, Minister Guenther Beckstein called Vivien a "pioneer in the Scientology controversy across Europe and across the world."&lt;ref name="mach2002" /&gt;  Beckstein stated that Vivien's work demonstrated that it is possible to prevent the misuse of the word "religion" by totalitarian organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =People in the News: Alain Vivien   | work =Südwest-Presse  |    date =May 5, 2002  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his acceptance speech, Vivien stated he was pleased "to receive the award in a place from which freedom of thought has for so long emanated."&lt;ref name="mach2002" /&gt;

Operation Clambake founder Andreas Heldal-Lund became the fourth recipient of the Leipzig Human Rights Award, on May 17, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =Human Rights Award for Norwegian IT specialist  | work =[[Deutsche Presse-Agentur]]  |    date =May 18, 2003  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/Anti-Scientology-site-spurs-award/2110-1025_3-999351.html|accessdate=2011-01-14|title=Anti-Scientology site spurs award|date=May 1, 2003|first=Lisa M.|last=Bowman|work=CNET News|publisher=CBS Interactive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operation Clambake was cited by the Committee for exposing what it referred to as "fraud and human rights violations" of the Church of Scientology in the United States.&lt;ref name="dialog2003"&gt;{{cite news  | last = Staff |   title = Norwegian IT professional wins Leipzig Human Rights Award 2003 | work = Dialog Zentrum Berlin |    date = December 29, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =Norwegian Internet expert receives Human Rights Award: The German Evangelical Alliance also congratulates the Scientology opponent | work =IDEA  |    date =May 6, 2003  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The European-American Citizens Committee said it echoed a statement Heldal-Lund had written at the Operation Clambake website, where he stated: "People should be free to believe whatever they want, including Scientology," but also cited what he believed to be the organization's "deceitfulness, its lack of compassion for its members (especially the hard-working staff), its aggressive hard sell, its arrogance, its attack on free speech, its litigiousness, its harassment of its critics, its lack of concern for families, its gross neglect and abuse of children."&lt;ref name="dialog2003" /&gt;  Heldal-Lund was recognized for "maintaining his Web page despite repeated legal attacks from church officials."&lt;ref name="bowman2003"&gt;{{cite web|first=Lisa M. |last=Bowman |title=Anti-Scientology site spurs award |url=http://news.cnet.com/2110-1025_3-999351.html |publisher=[[CNET]] |date=2003-05-01 |accessdate=2007-12-04 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120713030638/http://news.cnet.com/2110-1025_3-999351.html |archivedate=2012-07-13 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Church of Scientology officials had attempted to silence Heldal-Lund by requesting [[Google Inc.]] and [[Internet Archive]] remove links to Operation Clambake, claiming violation of their copyrights.&lt;ref name="bowman2003" /&gt;  The Awards ceremony again included the presentation of a glass-contained sculpture with an image of St. Nicholas Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =People in the News: Andreas Heldal-Lund / Johannes Rau  | work =[[Frankfurter Rundschau]]  | pages =Andreas Heldal-Lund (section)  |   date =May 15, 2003  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alain Vivien presented Heldal-Lund with the Award, and stated that his work had revealed the actions of Scientologists with "respect and intelligence."&lt;ref name="freie2003"&gt;{{cite news  | last =Staff  |   title =Leipzig Human Rights Award conferred upon Norwegian Heldal-Lund  | work =Freie Presse Chemnitz  |    date =May 18, 2003  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his acceptance speech, Heldal-Lund spoke about freedom of speech, and emphasized the role of the individual citizen.&lt;ref name="freie2003" /&gt;

After the 2003 Awards ceremony completed, the Committee met and selected Dr. Margaret Thaler Singer to receive the 2004 award.&lt;ref name="singer2004" /&gt;  Singer died on November 23, 2003, and as a result no award was given out in 2004.&lt;ref name="singer2004"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =  2004 Leipzig Human Rights Award: Dr. Margaret Thaler Singer | work =Prix de Leipzig |    date =2004 | url =http://www.leipzig-award.org/franzoesisch/navi_2004.html | accessdate = 2007-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The European-American Citizens Committee stated: "The Committee really had no choice but to not select another award recipient for 2004, because Margaret truly is irreplaceable. We also decided not to hold a celebration this year."&lt;ref name="singer2004" /&gt;

[[Neopaganism]] (also [[modern paganism]] or contemporary paganism) encompasses a wide range of religious groups and individuals. These may include old [[occult]] groups, those that follow a [[New Age]] approach, those that try to reconstruct old [[ethnic religion]]s, and followers of the pagan religion of [[Wicca]]. For organizations, the founding year is given in brackets.

== Early movements ==

{{main|Wicca|Contemporary witchcraft}}
{{see also|Category: Wiccan traditions}}
Wicca originated in 1940s Britain and became the mainstream of [[Neopaganism in the United States]] in the 1970s. There are two core traditions of Wicca which originated in Britain, Gardnerian and Alexandrian, which are sometimes referred to as British Traditional Wicca. From these two arose several other variant traditions. Wicca has also inspired a great number of other [[witchcraft]] traditions in [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Europe]] and the [[United States]], most of which base their beliefs and practices on Wicca. Many movements are influenced by the [[Goddess movement|Movement of the Goddess]], and [[New Age]] and [[feminism|feminist]] worldviews.

{{See also|Clericalism}}
* [[Philip Pullman]]'s ''[[His Dark Materials]]'' series is heavy with [[anticlericalism|anticlerical]] themes. [[Catholicism|The Catholic Church]] is depicted as an over-controlling, power-rich entity.

* [[C.S. Lewis]]' ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' abound in Christian [[allegory]]. [[Aslan]], the divine creator and protector of [[Narnia (world)|Narnia]], is envisioned not simply as an analogue to [[Jesus of Nazareth]], but rather as a fantastic alternate version of [[Christ]] himself. For example, in ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', an allegorical retelling of the [[Gospels]], Aslan offers himself up as a sacrifice in place of the traitorous Edmund, and is mocked, tortured, executed and subsequently resurrected. Aslan himself blatantly alludes to his nature as an alternate Christ in the final scene of ''[[The Voyage of the Dawn Treader]]'', wherein he reveals to the protagonists Edmund, Lucy and Eustace that in their own world, he is known by "another name", and that they must learn to know him by that name.

Later Ilúvatar takes the Ainur to see how the music, at the end of the void, created [[Arda (Tolkien)|Arda]], the fictional Middle-earth. Melkor then desires to rule Arda and later becomes the source from whom all evil in the world of Middle-earth ultimately stems.

{{Usul al-fiqh}}
In [[Islamic]] terminology, something which is '''''makruh''''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: مكروه, [[transliteration|transliterated]]: '''makrooh''' or ''makrūh'') is a disliked or offensive act (literally "detestable" or "abominable"&lt;ref name=aldin/&gt;). It is one of the [[Ahkam|five categories]] (''al-ahkam al-khamsa'') in Islamic law -- ''[[wajib]]/[[fard]]'' (obligatory), ''[[Mustahabb]]/mandub'' (recommended), ''[[mubah]]'' (neutral), ''makruh'' (disapproved), ''[[haram]]'' (forbidden).&lt;ref name=CampoEoI&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campo|first1=Juan Eduardo|title=Encyclopedia of Islam|publisher=infobase|page=284|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZbyz_Hr-eIC&amp;pg=PA284&amp;dq=Makruh+haram+halal&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TEi8U_6ZGcqLyASr94KIDg&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Makruh%20haram%20halal&amp;f=false|accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Though it is not ''[[haraam|haram]]'' (forbidden) or subject to punishment, a person who abstains from this act will be rewarded.&lt;ref name=aldin/&gt; [[Muslim]]s are encouraged to avoid such actions when or as possible. It is one of the degrees of approval (''[[ahkam]]'') in [[sharia|Islamic law]].

Examples of something considered ''Makruh'' are the use of a great amount of water for the pre-[[Salat|prayer]] [[Ritual purification|ablutions]] (ritual washings) known as the ''[[wudu]]'' and ''[[ghusl]]'', the consumption of [[garlic]] before attending the mosque or socializing with others,&lt;ref name=aldin&gt;{{cite book|last1=al-Dīn|first1=Mūʼil Yūsuf ʻIzz|title=Islamic Law: From Historical Foundations to Contemporary Practice|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|page=98|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fQzVVL8zI0sC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=Makruh+example&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dUS8U-mvMoWHyATB04GADQ&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Makruh%20example&amp;f=false|accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[divorce in Islam|divorce]].&lt;ref name=women-sonbol&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Sonbol|editor1-first=Amira El Azhary|title=Women, the Family, and Divorce Laws in Islamic History|publisher=Syracuse University Press|page=265|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FLUgscG6zFYC&amp;pg=PA265&amp;lpg=PA265&amp;dq=Makruh+divorce&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=akRWoNKBoP&amp;sig=oTDIqYZkPSSAjM96k2Adx2VhR90&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=q0a8U5GILNOUyASbxYK4BQ&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Makruh%20divorce&amp;f=false|accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanafis believe that you should refrain from it and eat something else if possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://spa.qibla.com/issue_view.asp?HD=1&amp;ID=2990&amp;CATE=107|title=Ruling on Shrimp|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222206/http://spa.qibla.com/issue_view.asp?HD=1&amp;ID=2990&amp;CATE=107|archivedate=2013-12-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of ''Makruh'' acts in Islam include [[Profanity|swearing]], talking while taking [[wudu]] for prayer, and slaughtering an animal for food where other animals of its kind can see.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

[[File:Kamogawa_ceremony_02.jpg|thumb|Miko perform Shinto ceremony near the [[Kamo River]]]]

In [[Shinto]], a '''''miko''''' ([[wiktionary:巫女|巫女]]) is a shrine ([[Shinto shrine|jinja]]) maiden&lt;ref name="Groemer, 28"&gt;Groemer, 28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aston, 101&lt;/ref&gt; or a supplementary [[priest]]ess.&lt;ref&gt;North-China herald, 571&lt;/ref&gt; Miko were once likely seen as a [[Shamanism|shaman]]&lt;ref name="Picken, 140"&gt;Picken, 140.&lt;/ref&gt; but are understood in modern Japanese culture to be an institutionalized&lt;ref&gt;Groemer, 29.&lt;/ref&gt; role in daily shrine life, trained to perform tasks, ranging from [[sacred]] cleansing&lt;ref name="Picken, 140"/&gt; to performing the sacred [[Kagura]] dance.&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, 246&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical description==
[[File:JP-tokio-meiji-mikos.jpg|thumb|The miko's attire consists of a white haori and a red hakama. The hair is tied in a ponytail with a white and red hair ribbon.]]

The traditional attire of a ''miko'' would be a pair of red [[hakama]] (long, divided trousers) or a long, red, slightly pleated skirt tied with a bow, a white [[haori]] ([[kimono]] jacket), and some white or red hair ribbons. In Shintoism, the color white symbolizes purity.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Traditional Miko tools include [[azusayumi]] (梓弓 or “catalpa bow”)&lt;ref&gt;Fairchild, 76&lt;/ref&gt; the [[tamagushi]] (玉串 or “offertory sakaki-tree branches”)&lt;ref&gt;Fairchild, 77.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[gehōbako]] (外法箱 or the “supernatural box that contains dolls, animal and human skulls ... [and] Shinto prayer beads”).&lt;ref&gt;Fairchild, 78&lt;/ref&gt;

The miko also use bells, drums, candles, and bowls of rice in ceremonies.

==Definition==
The Japanese words ''miko'' and ''[[fujo]]'' ("female shaman" and "shrine maiden" respectively&lt;ref name="Shogakukan"&gt;Kokugo Dai Jiten Dictionary, Revised edition, Shogakukan, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;) are usually written 巫女&lt;ref name="Shogakukan"/&gt; as a compound of the kanji [[wikt:巫#Japanese|巫]] ("shaman"), and [[wikt:女#Japanese|女]] ("woman").&lt;ref name=Shogakukan/&gt; ''Miko'' was archaically written [[wikt:神子|神子]] (literally "kami" or "god" + "child")&lt;ref name="Shogakukan"/&gt; and [[wikt:巫子#Japanese|巫子]] ("shaman child").&lt;ref name=Shogakukan/&gt;

''Miko'' once performed spirit possession and ''takusen'' as vocational functions in their service to shrines. As time passed, they left the shrines and began working independently in secular society. Miko at shrines today do no more than sit at reception counters and perform [[kagura]] dance. In addition to a medium or a miko (or a [[Shaman|Geki]], which is a male shaman), the site of a ''takusen'' may occasionally also be attended by a [[sayaniwa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1315 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510061632/http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1315 |archivedate=2015-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who interprets the words of the possessed person to make them comprehensible to other people present. [[Kamigakari]] and [[takusen]]&lt;ref name="eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1308 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030134405/http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1308 |archivedate=2011-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; may be passive, when a person speaks after suddenly becoming involuntarily possessed or has a dream revelation; they can also be active, when spirit possession is induced in a specific person to ascertain the divine will or gain a divine revelation.&lt;ref name="eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp"/&gt;

Miko are known by many names; Fairchild lists 26 terms for "shrine-attached Miko"&lt;ref&gt;Fairchild, 119&lt;/ref&gt; and 43 for "non-shrine-attached Miko".&lt;ref&gt;Fairchild, 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Other names are ''[[ichiko]]'' ([[wikt:巫子#Japanese|巫子]], "shaman child", or [[wikt:市子#Japanese|市子]], "market/town child", both likely instances of [[ateji]]) meaning "female medium; fortuneteller",&lt;ref name="Shogakukan"/&gt; and ''[[reibai]]'' ([[wikt:霊媒#Japanese|霊媒]]) meaning "spirit go-between, medium").&lt;ref name="Shogakukan"/&gt;

In English, the word is often translated as "[[shrine]] [[maiden]]", though freer renderings often simply use the phrase "[[female]] [[shaman]]" ([[shamanka]]{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}) or, as [[Lafcadio Hearn]] translated it, "Divineress".&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, 202&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} prefer the transliteration, contrasting the Japanese [[Mikoism]]{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} with other Asian terms for female shamans.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} As Fairchild explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Women played an important role in a region stretching from Manchuria, China, Korea and Japan to the Ryukyu Islands. In Japan these women were priests, soothsayers, magicians, prophets and shamans in the folk religion, and they were the chief performers in organized Shintoism. These women were called Miko, and the author calls the complex "Mikoism" for lack of a suitable English word.&lt;ref&gt;Fairchild, 57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Mikoism==
===History===
Miko traditions date back to the prehistoric [[Jōmon period]]&lt;ref name="Groemer, 28"/&gt; of Japan, when female shamans{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} who would go into “trances and convey the words of the gods”{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} (the [[kami]]), an act comparable with "the pythia or sibyl in Ancient Greece."&lt;ref&gt;Blacker, 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest record of anything resembling the term "miko", is of the Chinese reference to [[Himiko]], Japan's earliest substantiated historical reference (not legendary), however it is completely unknown whether Himiko was a miko, or even if miko existed in those days.

The early Miko was an important social figure{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} who was "associated with the ruling class".{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} "In addition to her ritual performances of ecstatic trance", writes Kuly, "[the Miko] performed a variety of religious and political functions".&lt;ref name="Kuly, 199"&gt;Kuly, 199.&lt;/ref&gt; One traditional school of Miko, Kuly adds, "claimed to descend from the [[ Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto |Goddess Uzume]]".&lt;ref&gt;Kuly, 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Nara period]] (710–794) and [[Heian period]] (794–1185), government officials tried to control Miko practices.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} As Fairchild notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 780 A.D. and in 807 A.D. official bulls against the practice of ecstasy outside of the authority of the shrines were published. These bulls were not only aimed at ecstasy, but were aimed at magicians, priests, sorcerers, etc. It was an attempt to gain complete control, while at the same time it aimed at eradicating abuses which were occurring.&lt;ref&gt;Fairchild, 53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the feudal [[Kamakura period]] (1185–1333) when Japan was controlled by warring ''[[shōgun]]'' states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Miko was forced into a state of mendicancy as the shrines and temples that provided her with a livelihood fell into bankruptcy. Disassociated from a religious context, her performance moved further away from a religious milieu and more toward one of a non-ecclesiastical nature. The travelling Miko, known as the aruki Miko, became associated with prostitution.&lt;ref name="Kuly, 199"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During in the [[Edo]] period (1603–1868), writes Groemer, "the organizational structures and arts practiced by female shamans in eastern Japan underwent significant transformations".&lt;ref&gt;Groemer, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Though in the [[Meiji period|Meiji]] period (1868–1912), many shamanistic practices were outlawed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;After 1867 the Meiji government's desire to create a form of state Shinto headed by the emperor&amp;mdash;the shaman-in-chief of the nation&amp;mdash;meant that Shinto needed to be segregated from both Buddhism and folk-religious beliefs. As a result, official discourse increasingly repeated negative views of Miko and their institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Groemer, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There was an edict called ''Miko Kindanrei'' (巫女禁断令) enforced by security forces loyal to Imperial forces, forbidding all spiritual practices by miko, issued in 1873, by the Religious Affairs Department (教部).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://d.hatena.ne.jp/mayumi_charron/touch/searchdiary?word=*%255B%25BF%25C0%25C6%25BB+%25D6%25E0%25BD%25F7%255D|title=『*%5B%BF%C0%C6%BB %D6%E0%BD%F7%5D』の検索結果 - 耀姫の日記|author=|date=|website=d.hatena.ne.jp|accessdate=24 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424204924/http://d.hatena.ne.jp/mayumi_charron/touch/searchdiary?word=*%255B%25BF%25C0%25C6%25BB+%25D6%25E0%25BD%25F7%255D|archivedate=24 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shinto [[kagura]] dance ceremony, which originated with "ritual dancing to convey divine oracles",{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} has been transformed in the 20th century into a popular ceremonial dance called [[Miko-mai]] (巫女舞){{citation needed|date=December 2011}} or [[Miko-kagura]] (巫女神楽).{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Traditional training===
[[File:Tokyo, Meiji-jingu (6215281946).jpg|thumb|Miko in [[Meiji Shrine]], Tokyo]]

The position of a shaman passed from generation to generation, but sometimes someone not directly descended from a shaman went voluntary into training or was appointed by the village chieftains. To achieve this, such a person had to have some potential. Several characteristics could be seen as a sign a person was called towards shamanism: neurosis, hallucinations, unusual behavior and hysteria. These conditions are still referred to as ''‘shamanistic sicknesses’''.

To become a shaman, the girl (still at a young age, mostly after the start of the menstruation cycle) had to undergo very intensive training specific to the ''kuchiyose miko''.&lt;ref&gt;Ichirō Hōri: ''Japanese Journal of Religious Studies''{{issue needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An acknowledged elder shaman, who could be a family member (like an aunt) of a member of the tribe, would teach the girl in training the techniques required to be in control of her trance state. This would be done by rituals including washings with cold water, regular purifying, abstinence and the observation of the common taboos like death, illness and blood. She would also study how to communicate with ''kami'' and spirits of the deceased, as a medium, by being possessed by those spirits. This was achieved by chanting and dancing, thus therefore the girl was taught melodies and intonations that were used in songs, prayers and magical formulas, supported by drum and rattlers. 

Other attributes used for rituals were mirrors (to attract the kami) and swords ([[katana]]). She also needed the knowledge of the several names of the kami that were important for her village, as well as their function. Finally she learned a secret language, only known by insiders (other shamans of the tribe) and so discovered the secrets of fortune-telling and magical formulas.
After the training, which could take three to seven years, the girl would get her initiation rite to become a real shaman. This mystic ceremony was witnessed by her mentor, other elders and fellow shamans. The girl wore a white shroud as a symbol for the end of her previous life. The elders began chanting and after a while the girl started to shiver. Next, her mentor would ask the girl which ''kami'' had possessed her and therefore she would serve. As soon as she answered, the mentor would throw a rice cake into her face, causing the girl to faint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hori|first1=Ichiro|title=Folk religion in Japan : continuity and change|date=1968|publisher=Univ. of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0226353346|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elders would bring the girl to a warm bed and keep her warm until she woke up. When the whole ordeal was over and the girl had woken up, she was permitted to wear a beautifully coloured wedding dress and perform the corresponding tradition of the wedding toast.

The resemblance of a wedding ceremony as the initiation rite suggests that the trainee, still a virgin, had become the bride of the kami she served (this is called a ''Tamayori Hime'' 玉依姫). During her trance, said kami had requested the girl to his shrine. In some areas of Japan she had to bring a pot filled with rice (''meshibitsu'') and a pan. An old, since long forsaken, practice was the sexual intercourse with a shintô priest who would represent the kami. As a result of this intercourse, the shaman would have the ''kami’s'' baby (''mikogami'' 御子神 ). 

In some cases the girls or women were visited at night by a travelling spirit (''marebito'' 稀人). After this visit the woman made her new position of being possessed by a ''kami'' known to the rest of her village by placing a white, feathered arrow on the roof of her house.

==Contemporary miko==
[[File:Miko at the Ikuta Shrine.jpg|thumb|Miko at the [[Ikuta Shrine]]]]

Modern miko are often seen at Shinto shrines, where they assist with shrine functions, perform ceremonial dances, offer ''[[omikuji]]'' fortune telling, sell souvenirs, and assist a [[Kannushi]] in Shinto rites. Kuly describes the contemporary miko: "A far distant relative of her premodern shamanic sister, she is most probably a university student collecting a modest wage in this part-time position."&lt;ref&gt;Kuly, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethnologist [[Kunio Yanagita]] (1875–1962), who first studied Japanese female shamans, differentiated them into ''jinja miko'' (神社巫女 or "shrine shamans") who dance with bells and participate in ''yudate'' (湯立て or "boiling water") rituals, ''kuchiyose miko'' (口寄せ巫女 or "spirit medium shamans") who speak on behalf of the deceased, and ''kami uba'' (神姥 or "god women") who engage in cult worship and invocations (for instance, the [[Tenrikyo]] founder [[Nakayama Miki]]).&lt;ref&gt;Kawamura, 258-259.&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have further categorized contemporary miko in terms of their diverse traditions and practices. Such categorizations include blind ''itako'' (concentrated in north and east Japan), mostly blind ''okamin'' (north and east Japan), blind ''waka'' or ''owaka'' (northeastern Japan), ''moriko'' (north and east of Tokyo), ''nono'' (central Japan), blind ''zatokaka'' (northwest Japan), ''sasa hataki'' who tap ''[[Sasa (plant)|sasa]]'' ("bamboo grass") on their faces (northeast of Tokyo), plus family and village organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Fairchild, 62–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have divided miko or fujo by [[blindness]] between blind ''ogamiya'' (尾上屋 or "invocation specialist") or ''ogamisama'' who perform ''kuchiyose'' and spirit mediumship and sighted miko' or ''kamisama'' who perform divination and invocations.&lt;ref&gt;Kawamura, 263–264.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eclectic [[Shugendō]] religion, male priests who practiced ecstasy often married miko.&lt;ref&gt;Fairchild 1962:55.&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars identify shamanic miko characteristics in [[Japanese new religions|Shinshūkyō]] ("New Religions") such as [[Sukyo Mahikari]], [[Ōmoto]], and [[Shinmeiaishinkai]].&lt;ref&gt;Blacker, 140.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hardacre.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuly, 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

New open-source religions may develop their rituals, praxes, or systems of beliefs through a continuous process of refinement and dialogue among participating practitioners.

==Origin==

In 1994, with his essay, "The Holy War: Mac vs. DOS," the scholar and novelist [[Umberto Eco]] popularized the use of religious metaphors in comparing [[operating system]] design and user experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eco|first1=Umberto|title=The Holy War: Mac vs. DOS|journal=Espresso|date=September 30, 1994|url=http://cliffarnold.com/macvdos.pdf|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1990s, the term "open-source religion" began appearing in technology magazines as a reference to the open-source [[Linux]] operating system's organizing principle and as an analogy for highlighting the philosophical differences between advocates of open-source vs. proprietary software .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liebmann|first1=Lenny|title=Say Hello to the 'Lintel' Reformation|journal=Computerworld|date=May 10, 1999|volume=33|issue=19|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90foRW8FHpkC&amp;pg=PT31&amp;dq=%22Open+Source+Religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KIAAVfW0JYmbyQSr6IHIBA&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foster|first1=Ed|title=Apple padlocks UI decor|journal=InfoWorld|date=June 6, 2001|volume=23|issue=24|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_TgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=%22Open+Source+Religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KIAAVfW0JYmbyQSr6IHIBA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, [[Daniel Kriegman]] began describing a religion he invented called Ozacua (later Yoism) as "the world's first opensource religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ozacua: the Living Religion (5 April 2001) |url=http://www.ozacua.com/ |website=ozacua.com |publisher=Daniel Kriegman |accessdate=11 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010419072235/http://www.ozacua.com/ |archivedate=April 19, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lovink|first1=Geert|title=Dark Fiber: Tracking Critical Internet Culture|date=2002|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-12249-9|page=334|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p_7YWf9WpwYC&amp;pg=PA334&amp;dq=%22Open+Source+Religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KIAAVfW0JYmbyQSr6IHIBA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=religion&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of an "open source religion" was further expanded upon by the media theorist, [[Douglas Rushkoff]] in his book, ''Nothing's Sacred: The Truth about Judaism'' (2003), where he offered the following description as an introduction to [[Open Source Judaism]]:
:An open source religion would work the same way as open source software development: it is not kept secret or mysterious at all. Everyone contributes to the codes we use to comprehend our place in the universe. We allow our religion to evolve based on the active participation of its people....An open source relationship to religion would likewise take advantage of the individual points of view of its many active participants to develop its more resolved picture of the world and our place within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rushkoff|first=Douglas|title=Nothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism|year=2004|publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=USA|page=111|isbn=1400051398|url=http://www.rushkoff.com/nothing-sacred/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discordianism, Copyleft, and open-source software===
[[File:Principia Discordia page "00075-Page 00088".jpg|thumb|Page of the Principia Discordia that includes the following Copyright disclaimer, "Ⓚ ALL RIGHTS REVERSED – Reprint what you like," the earliest example of what would become a declaration of [[copyleft]].]]
[[File:Circled latin capital letter k.svg|thumb|Discordian reference to the mythological Kallisti, or [[Apple of Discord]], by way of a kosher food symbol in place of a conventional Copyright symbol.]]
Before the coinage of the term [[open-source]] in 1998 or even the birth of the [[Free Software]] movement, the ''[[Principia Discordia]]'', a [[Discordian]] religious text written by [[Malaclypse the Younger|Greg Hill]] with [[Kerry Wendell Thornley]], included the following Copyright disclaimer in its 4th edition (1970), "Ⓚ ALL RIGHTS REVERSED – Reprint what you like." By the summer of 1970, the implications of the disclaimer were being discussed in other [[Underground Press|underground publications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clutterbuck|first1=Brenton|title=Chasing Eris: An Interlude on Copyleft|url=http://historiadiscordia.com/chasing-eris-an-interlude-on-copyleft/|website=Historia Discordia|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Commercial publishers are not likely to be interested in the ''Principia'' due, at least, to the counter copyright on it–for, if they had a good seller, then other publishers could print it out from under them. Consequently publication and distribution will have to occur spontaneously, thru the “underground”, as alternative cultures learn to meet their own needs and provide their own services. This non-commercial limitation of the ''Principia'' is to provide less limitations in other respects, and it is not an accident. The ''Principia'' is not simply a handbook, it is a demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Greater Poop|date=July–August 1970|issue=30|page=1|url=http://historiadiscordia.com/greg-hills-discordian-newsletter-the-greater-poop/greg_hill-197007_08-the_greater_poop-poop30_page_00001/|accessdate=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Via the counterculture, by the mid-1970s, the concept had influenced a generation of Discordians including the nascent hacker culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buxton|first1=Kristin|title=The Lifecycle of the Principia Discordia: The dissemination of the religion disguised as a joke and joke disguised as a religion|url=http://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/articles/principia-discordia|website=The Lazarus Corporation|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project to create [[Tiny BASIC]] was proposed in Bob Albrecht and [[Dennis Allison]]'s ''[[Dr. Dobb's Journal|Dr. Dobb's Journal of Tiny BASIC Calisthenics &amp; Orthodontia]]'', a journal of the [[Homebrew Computer Club]], a small group of computer hobbyists who began meeting in 1975 around [[Silicon Valley]]. The first lines of the source code for Tiny Basic as released in 1976 by [[Li-Chen Wang]] stated ‘(ↄ) COPYLEFT ALL WRONGS RESERVED’. In 1984/5 programmer [[Don Hopkins]] sent [[Richard Stallman]] a letter labeled "[[Copyleft]]—[[all rights reversed]]". Stallman chose the phrase to identify his free software method of distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution |last= Stallman |first= Richard  |year= 1999 |publisher= O'Reilly Media |isbn= 1-56592-582-3 |pages= 59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between Discordianism and "Kopyleft" remain part of the culture of Discordianism, as explained by the Discordian Rev. Dr. Jon Swabey in his ''Apocrypha Discordia.''
:Discordianism and the concept of KopyLeft go hand in hand. Although just a small part of the counter-culture gestalt, I believe that the ''Principia Discordia'' was probably one of the earliest expressions and strongest champions of this idea, which has since seen such concepts as the [[Open Source Software]] initiative, with endeavours such as the [[Linux]] Operating System.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swabey|first1=Jon|title=Apocrypha Discordia|date=2001|url=http://www.23ae.com/files/apocrypha2.pdf|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open-source in established religious traditions==
For established traditions whose canonical works, records of discourse, and inspired artworks reside in the [[public domain]], keeping these works open and available in the face of proprietary interests has inspired several open-source initiatives. Open access to resources and [[adaptive reuse]] of shared materials under [[open content]] licensing provide a structure by which communities can innovate new religious systems collaboratively under the aegis of copyright law. For some religious movements, however, [[public access]] and [[literacy]], and the potential of adaptive reuse also provide an opportunity for innovation and reform within established traditions. In an interview by [[Alan Jacobs (academic)|Alan Jacobs]] in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' magazine on open-source religion, Aharon Varady (founding director of the [[Open Siddur Project]]) explained that "cultures breathe creativity like we breathe oxygen" arguing that open-source provides one possible strategy for keeping a tradition vibrant while also preserving historical works as non-proprietary during a period of transition from analog to digital media.&lt;ref  name="jacobs"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jacobs|first=Alan|title=The Potential and Promise of Open-Source Judaism|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/06/the-potential-and-promise-of-open-source-judaism/258394/|work=The Atlantic Magazine Online|publisher=The Atlantic Magazine|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open-source Judaism===
Although a work of radical 1960s Jewish counterculture rather than an explicitly religious work, the satirical songbook ''Listen to the mocking bird'' (Times Change Press, 1971) by [[the Fugs]]' [[Tuli Kupferberg|Naphtali "Tuli" Kupferberg]] contains the earliest explicit mention of "copyleft" in a copyright disclaimer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kupferberg|first1=Naphtali|title=Listen to the Mocking Bird: Satiric Songs to Tunes You Know|date=1971|publisher=Times Change Press|location=Washington, New Jersey|url=https://archive.org/stream/2917619.0001.001.umich.edu#page/2/mode/2up|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[Open Source Judaism|open-source efforts in Judaism]] begin to appear in 1988 with the [[free software]] code written for calculating the Hebrew calendar included in [[Emacs]]. After the popularization of the term "[[open-source]]" in 1998, essays and manifestos linking open-source and Judaism began appearing in 2002 among Jewish thinkers familiar with trends in new media and open-source software. In August 2002, Aharon Varady proposed the formation of an "[[Open Siddur Project|Open Siddur]]," an open-source licensed [[user-generated content]] project for digitizing liturgical materials and writing the code needed for the [[web-to-print]] publishing of [[Siddur]]im (Jewish prayer books).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Varady |first1=Aharon |title=update 2002-08-08 |url=http://aharon.varady.net/omphalos/2002/08/update-2002-08-08 |website=Aharon's Omphalos |publisher=Aharon Varady |accessdate=16 June 2014 }} and {{cite web|last=Varady |first=Aharon |title=The Open Siddur Project |url=http://varady.net/open_siddur/ |work=Aharon Varady's Homepage |publisher=The Internet Archive's Wayback Machine |accessdate=5 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021013153654/http://varady.net/open_siddur/ |archivedate=October 13, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, media theorist [[Douglas Rushkoff]] began articulating his understanding of open-source in Judaism. "The object of the game, for me," Rushkoff explained, "was to recontextualize Judaism as an entirely Open Source proposition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rushkoff |first1=Douglas |title=Open-Source Religion |url=http://www.g4tv.com/screensavers/features/44075/OpenSource_Religion.html |website=G4 TV - The Screen Savers |publisher=G4 TV |accessdate=23 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312093353/http://www.g4tv.com/screensavers/features/44075/OpenSource_Religion.html |archivedate=March 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Open-Source Judaism.svg|thumb|Open-Source Judaism logo]]
The term "Open Source Judaism" first appeared in [[Douglas Rushkoff]]'s book ''Nothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism'' (2003). Rushkoff employed the term "Open Source" to describe a democratic organizational model for collaborating in a commonly held source: the [[Hebrew Bible]] and other essential works of [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. Rushkoff conceived of Judaism as essentially an open-source religion which he conceived as, "the contention that religion is not a pre-existing truth but an ongoing project. It may be divinely inspired, but it is a creation of human beings working together. A collaboration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rushkoff|first=Douglas|title=Nothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism|year=2004|publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=USA|isbn=1400051398|url=http://www.rushkoff.com/nothing-sacred/}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Rushkoff, open-source offered the promise of enacting change through a new culture of collaboration and improved access to sources. "Anyone who wants to do Judaism should have access to Judaism. Judaism is not just something that you do, it's something you enact. You've got to learn the code in order to alter it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lehmann-Haupt|first=Rachel|title=Is Judaism Becoming Irrelevant?|url=http://www.alternet.org/story/16146/is_judaism_becoming_irrelevant|accessdate=7 December 2013|newspaper=AlterNet|date=2003-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2003 publication of Rushkoff's book ''Nothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.rushkoff.com/nothingsacred.html|title=Nothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism|author=Douglas Rushkoff|publisher=Three Rivers Press|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an online forum dedicated to "Open Source Judaism" inspired several online projects in creating web applications for generating custom made [[haggadah|haggadot]] for [[Passover]], however neither content nor code for these were shared under [[free content|free-culture]] [[license compatibility|compatible]] [[open content]] terms.

Beginning with the [[Open Siddur Project]] in 2009, open-source projects in Judaism began to publicly share their software code with open-source licenses and their content with [[free content|free-culture]] [[license compatibility|compatible]] [[open content]] licenses. The explicit objectives of these projects also began to differ from Rushkoff's "Open Source Judaism." Rather than seek reforms in religious practices or doctrines, these projects used Open Content licenses to empower users to access and create their own resources from a common store of canonical texts and associated translations and metadata. By 2012, [[Open Source Judaism|open-source projects in Judaism]] were mainly active in facilitating collaboration in sharing resources for transcribing and translating existing works in the Public Domain, and for adaptation and dissemination of works being shared by copyright owners under Open Content licenses.&lt;ref name="jacobs"/&gt;

===Open-source Yoga===
Following proprietary claims on Yoga movements by some Yoga instructors, Open Source Yoga Unity was formed in 2003 to assert that Yoga movements reside in the [[public domain]]. The organization provides a common voice, and the pooling of resources, to legally resist the application of a proprietary [[Copyright]] to any Yoga style thereby "ensuring its continued natural unfettered practice for all to enjoy and develop." The organization explains, that "while we appreciate the teachings of yoga teachers, we do not believe that they have the legal right to impose control over another's Yoga teaching or practice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Open Source Yoga Unity|url=https://www.facebook.com/yogaunity/info?tab=page_info|website=Open Source Yoga Unity Facebook Page|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Open Source Yoga Unity v. Bikram Choudhury (2005), the organization settled out of court, avoiding a federal court hearing to determine whether Bikram Choudhury’s copyrighted sequence of 26 poses and two breathing exercises could be legally protected.&lt;ref&gt;Open Source Yoga Unity v. Bikram Choudhury (N.D. Cal., 4/1/05, No. C 03–3182 PJH)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open-source Wicca===
Concerned with the lack of a source text containing documentation on [[Wicca]] in the tradition of [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], Dr. [[Leo Ruickbie]] self-published ''Open Source Wicca: The Gardnerian Tradition'' (2007) for "putting you back in control of spirituality." The work, a collection of "the original foundation documents of Wicca" authored between 1949 and 1961, was published [http://www.witchology.com/contents/opensourcewicca/gardnerianindex.php digitally] and in print under a [[Creative Commons]] [[Attribution (copyright)|Attribution]] license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ruickbie|first1=Leo|title=Open Source Wicca|url=http://p2pfoundation.net/Open_Source_Wicca|publisher=Leo Ruickbie|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open-source in establishing new religions==
Several projects aiding individuals and communities in formulating their own belief systems cite inspiration from ideas common to the [[open-source movement]] and self-identify as open-source religions or religious initiatives. The establishment of new religions through open-source methods is closely related to [[chaos magic]], which emphasizes the pragmatic use of belief systems and the creation of new and unorthodox methods,&lt;ref name="New Encyclopedia of the Occult"&gt;{{cite book|last=Greer|first=John Michael|title=The New Encyclopedia of the Occult|year=2003|publisher=Llewellyn Publications|location=St. Paul, MN|isbn=9781567183368|pages=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; the difference being that any knowledge gained through such innovation is shared openly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=A.o.C.|first1=Fra.|title=Open Source Magic|url=http://osogd.org/library/the-aerodynamic-biscuits/142-2/|publisher=Open Source Order of the Golden Dawn|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yoism===
[[File:Yoism symbol.svg|thumb|Yoism]]
According to its founder, [[Daniel Kriegman]], Yoism (founded 1994) combines rational inquiry, empiricism, and science with [[Spinoza]]n or [[Einstein]]ian [[pantheism]].&lt;ref name=DemocratAndChronile&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yoism.org/?q=node/409|title=Civil commitment still evolving in N.Y.|author=Gary Craig|date=2011-04-11|publisher=Rochester Democrat and Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url= http://www.yoism.org/?q=node/395|title=Open to Revisions|first=Sam|last=Kean|date=May–June 2009|work=Search Magazine|accessdate=2010-09-19|quote=[Daniel Kriegman] based the [...] religion on a cocktail of rational inquiry, empiricism, and science.

===Belief Genome Project===
The Belief Genome Project aims to use [[crowdsourcing]] to catalog all beliefs as a resource for those wishing to build and discover their own belief system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Sidian M.S.|title=Open Source Religion Basics|url=http://www.opensourcereligion.net/page/open-source-religion-basics|website=OpenSourceReligion.net|publisher=Sidian M.S. Jones|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is an initiative of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100402231809/http://www.opensourcereligion.net/ Open Source Religion Social Network] , a website established in 2009 by Sidian M.S. Jones which he described as "a system for the mixing of religious and non-religious beliefs in an individual, even across multiple religions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Sidian M.S.|title=Open Source Religion|url=http://opensourcereligion.net|website=OpenSourceReligion.net|publisher=Sidian M.S. Jones|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human Worship===

Human Worship, or Open Religion, is an "eternal tradition of considering [[Human]] absolute, highest value", "considering God as Human continuation to infinity through Soul", described in its sacred book, shared in [[public domain]] by the formula "[[All rights reserved]] for [[God]]. Open Soul Holy [[Scripture]] of Human Worship is word of God, common heritage of Humankind, published anonymously, free for copying".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Soul: Holy Scripture of Human Worship|url=https://www.academia.edu/34660139/Open_Soul_Holy_Scripture_of_Human_Worship|website=Academia.edu|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blessing gesture and sacred sign of Open Religion is the [[circle]] or [[zero]],  with the human in the center of [[coordinates]]. Human Worshippers bow to every human [[soul]], laying the hand on [[heart]] and saying "Believe in yourself!". They organize "soul societies" for [[missionary]] work, [[friendship]], [[love]] and common [[joy]]. Also they believe in every human  having the capacity to be a [[prophet]], every human action to be [[prayer]] and all consequences as [[revelation]] from God, claiming that practical experience inspires true [[faith]] and [[skeptics]] are the same holy persons as prophets.

{{Zoroastrianism}}

A '''Parsi''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɑr|s|iː}}) or '''Parsee''' ("[[Persian people|Persian]]" in the [[Persian language]]) refers to a member of the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] community who migrated to India (mainly; including present day Pakistan) from [[Persia]] during the Arab invasion of 636–651 AD; one of two (the other being [[Irani (India)|Iranis]]) mainly located in [[India]], with a few in [[Pakistan]]. According to the ''[[Qissa-i Sanjan]]'', Parsis migrated from [[Greater Iran]] to [[Gujarat]], where they were given refuge, between the 8th and 10th century AD to avoid [[Persecution of Zoroastrians|persecution]] following the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]].&lt;ref name="Hodivala 1920 88"&gt;{{harvnb|Hodivala|1920|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="boy148"&gt;{{harvnb|Boyce|2001|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ann205"&gt;{{harvnb|Lambton|1981|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ns42"&gt;{{harvnb|Nigosian|1993|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=khan17&gt;{{harvnb|Khanbaghi|2006|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jack&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|1906|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bleek212&gt;{{harvnb|Bleeker|Widengren|1971|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the Muslim conquest of Persia, the dominant religion of the region (which was ruled by the [[Sasanian Empire]]) was [[Zoroastrianism]]. Iranians rebelled against Muslim conquerors for almost 200 years&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Muslim-Conquest-Persia-I-Akram/dp/0954866533|title=The Muslim Conquest of Persia|last=Akram|first=A. I.|last2=al-Mehri|first2=A. B.|date=2009-09-01|publisher=Maktabah Publications|isbn=9780954866532}}&lt;/ref&gt;. During this time many Iranians (who are now called Parsis) chose to preserve their religious identity by fleeing from Persia to India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/parsi-communities-i-early-history PARSI COMMUNITIES i. EARLY HISTORY – Encyclopaedia Iranica]. Iranicaonline.org (2008-07-20). Retrieved on 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word {{lang|fa|پارسیان}}, pronounced "Parsian", i.e., "Parsi" in the [[Persian language]], literally means ''Persian''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/138161 Parsee, n. and adj. - Oxford English Dictionary]. oed.com. Retrieved on 2015-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt; Farsi is the official language of modern [[Iran]], which was formerly known as Persia, and the [[Persian language]]'s [[endonym]] is ''Farsi'', an [[arabization]] of the word ''Parsi''.

The long presence of the Parsis in the [[India|Indian subcontinent]] distinguishes them from the smaller Zoroastrian Indian community of [[Irani (India)|Irani]]s, who are much more recent arrivals, mostly descended from Zoroastrians fleeing the repression of the [[Qajar dynasty]] and the general social and political tumult of late 19th- and early 20th-century Iran&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ganesh|first=Kamala|date=2008|title=Intra-community Dissent and Dialogue: The Bombay Parsis and the Zoroastrian Diaspora|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/23620804|journal=Sociological Bulletin|volume=57|issue=3|pages=315–336}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Definition and identity ==
According to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]],&lt;blockquote&gt;Parsi, also spelled Parsee, member of a group of followers in India of the Persian prophet [[Zoroaster]]. The Parsis, whose name means "Persians", are descended from Persian Zoroastrians who emigrated to India to avoid religious persecution by the Muslims. They live chiefly in Mumbai and in a few towns and villages mostly to the south of Mumbai, but also a few minorities near by in Karachi (Pakistan) and Bangalore (Karnataka, India). There is a sizeable Parsee population in Pune as well in Hyderabad. A few Parsee families also reside in Kolkata and Chennai. Although they are not, strictly speaking, a caste, since they are not Hindus, they form a well-defined community. The exact date of the Parsi migration is unknown. According to tradition, the Parsis initially settled at Hormuz on the [[Persian Gulf]], but finding themselves still persecuted they set sail for India, arriving in the 8th century. The migration may in fact have taken place as late as the 10th century, or in both. They settled first at [[Diu, India|Diu]] in [[Kathiawar]] but soon moved to south Gujarāt, where they remained for about 800 years as a small agricultural community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/444672/Parsi Parsi (people) - Encyclopædia Britannica]. Britannica.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term ''Pārsi'', which in the Persian language is a [[demonym]] meaning "inhabitant of [[Fars Province|Pārs]]" and hence "ethnic Persian", is not attested in Indian Zoroastrian texts until the 17th century. Until that time, such texts consistently use the Persian-origin terms ''Zartoshti'' "Zoroastrian" or ''Vehdin'' "[of] the good religion". The 12th-century ''Sixteen [[Shloka]]s'', a [[Sanskrit]] text in praise of the Parsis,&lt;ref&gt;Parsi legend attributes it to a Hindu author; [[cf.]] {{Harvard citation no brackets|Paymaster|1954|p=8}} incorrectly attributes the text to a Zoroastrian priest&lt;/ref&gt; is the earliest attested use of the term as an identifier for Indian Zoroastrians.

[[File:Indian - Leaf from Bound Collection of 20 Miniatures Depicting Village Life - Walters 35176H.jpg|thumb|Parsis from India, c. 1870]]
The first reference to the Parsis in a European language is from 1322, when a French monk, [[Jordanus]], briefly refers to their presence in [[Thane]] and [[Bharuch]]. Subsequently, the term appears in the journals of many European travelers, first French and Portuguese, later English, all of whom used a Europeanized version of an apparently local language term. For example, Portuguese physician [[Garcia de Orta]] observed in 1563 that "there are merchants ... in the kingdom of [[Khambhat|Cambaia]] ... known as Esparcis. We Portuguese call them Jews, but they are not so. They are [[Gentile|Gentios]]." In an early 20th-century legal ruling (see [[#Self-perceptions|self-perceptions]], below), Justices Davar and Beaman asserted (1909:540) that "Parsi" was also a term used in Iran to refer to Zoroastrians.{{Harvard citation|Stausberg|2002|p=I.373}} {{Harvtxt|Boyce|2002|p=105}} notes that in much the same way as the word "Hindu" was used by Iranians to refer to anyone from the Indian subcontinent, "Parsi" was used by the Indians to refer to anyone from Greater Iran, irrespective of whether they were actually ethnic Persian people. In any case, the term "Parsi" itself is "not necessarily an indication of their Iranian or 'Persian' origin, but rather as indicator – manifest as several properties – of ethnic identity" {{Harvard citation|Stausberg|2002|p=I. 373}}. Moreover, if heredity were the only factor in a determination of ethnicity, the Parsis would count as [[Parthia]]ns according to the ''Qissa-i Sanjan''. {{Harvard citation|Boyce|2002|p=105}}

The term "Parseeism" or "Parsiism" is attributed to [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron]], who in the 1750s, when the word "Zoroastrianism" had yet to be coined, made the first detailed report of the Parsis and of Zoroastrianism, therein mistakenly assuming that the Parsis were the only remaining followers of the religion.

In addition to above, the Parsi identity was well truly an identity even before they moved to India:
* The earliest reference to the Parsis is found in the Assyrian inscription of [[Shalmaneser III]] (circa 854-824 BC).
* [[Darius I|Darius the Great]] (521-486 BC) establishes this fact when he records his Parsi ancestry for posterity, “parsa parsahya puthra ariya ariyachitra”, meaning, “a Parsi, the son of a Parsi, an [[Aryan]], of Aryan family (Inscription at [[Naqsh-e Rustam|Naqsh-i-Rustam]], near [[Persepolis]], [[Iran]]).
* In Outlines of Parsi History, Dasturji Hormazdyar Dastur Kayoji Mirza, Bombay 1987, pp. 3-4 writes, “According to the [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] text of [[Karnamak-i Ardeshir-i Papakan|Karnamak i Artakhshir i Papakan]], the Indian astrologer refers to Artakhshir ([[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] king, and the founder of the Empire) as khvatay parsikan ‘the king of the Parsis’.
* [[Herodotus]] and [[Xenophon]], the two great historians who lived in the third and fourth centuries BC referred to Iranians as Parsis.&lt;ref&gt;Jamshed Irani v. Banu Irani (1966) 68 Bom. L.R. 794&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
In ancient Persia, Zoroaster taught that good ([[Ohrmazd]]) and evil ([[Angra Mainyu]]) were opposite forces and the battle between them is more or less evenly matched. A person should always be vigilant to align with forces of light. According to the ''[[asha]]'' or the righteousness and ''[[druj]]'' or the wickedness, the person has chosen in his life they will be judged at the [[Chinvat bridge]] to grant passage to Paradise, Hammistagan (A limbo area) or Hell by a sword. A personified form of the soul that represents the person’s deeds takes the adjudged to their destination and they will abide there until the final apocalypse. After the final battle between good and evil, every soul’s walk through a river of fire ordeal for burning of their dross and together they receive a post resurrection paradise. The Zoroastrian holy book, called the ''Avesta'', was written in the [[Avestan language]], which is closely related to [[Vedic Sanskrit]].

The ''[[Qissa-i Sanjan]]'' is a tale of the journey of the Parsis to India from Iran. It says they fled for reasons of religious freedom and they were allowed to settle in India thanks to the goodwill of a local prince. However, the Parsi community had to abide by three rules: they had to speak the local language, follow local marriage customs, and not carry any weapons. After showing the many similarities between their faith and local beliefs, the early community was granted a plot of land on which to build a [[fire temple]].

=== As an ethnic community ===
[[Image:Parsi wedding portrait with Dastur MN Dhalla.jpg|thumb|left|Wedding portrait, 1948]]
Over the centuries since the first Zoroastrians arrived in India, the Parsis have integrated themselves into Indian society while simultaneously maintaining or developing their own distinct customs and traditions (and thus ethnic identity). This in turn has given the Parsi community a rather peculiar standing: they are Indians in terms of national affiliation, language and history, but not typically Indian in terms of [[consanguinity]] or ethnicity, cultural, behavioural and religious practices. &lt;!-- religion, and [[socio-cultural anthropology]] --&gt;
[[Genealogical DNA test]]s to determine purity of lineage have brought mixed results. One study supports the Parsi contention {{Harvard citation|Nanavutty|1970|p=13}} that they have maintained their Persian roots by avoiding intermarriage with local populations. In that 2002 study of the [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y-chromosome]] (patrilineal) DNA of the Parsis of [[Pakistan]], it was determined that Parsis are genetically closer to Iranians than to their neighbours {{Harv |Qamar|Ayub|Mohyuddin|Helgason|2002| p=1119}}.

A 2004 study in which Parsi [[mitochondrial DNA]] (matrilineal) was compared with that of the Iranians and [[Gujarati people|Gujaratis]] determined that Parsis (in Gujarat, but not in other parts of India) are genetically closer to Gujaratis than to Iranians. Taking the 2002 study into account, the authors of the 2004 study suggested "a male-mediated migration of the ancestors of the present-day Parsi population, where they admixed with local females [...] leading ultimately to the loss of mtDNA of Iranian origin" {{Harvard citation|Quintana-Murci|Chaix|Wells|Behar|2004|p=840}}. To put all the doubts to rest a deeper study was conducted in 2017 [https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-017-1244-9 “Like sugar in milk”: reconstructing the genetic history of the Parsi population] which confirms that Parsis are genetically closer to [[Neolithic]] Iranians than to modern Iranians, who have witnessed a more recent wave of admixture from the Near East.

=== Self-perceptions ===
[[Image:Parsi-navjote-sitting.jpg|thumb|right|Parsi ''[[Navjote]]'' ceremony (rites of admission into the Zoroastrian faith)]]
The definition of who is, and is not, a Parsi is a matter of great contention within the Zoroastrian community in India. It is generally accepted that a Parsi is a person who:

:(a) is directly descended from the original Persian refugees, and
:(b) has been formally admitted into the Zoroastrian religion, through the [[navjote]] ceremony.

In this sense, ''Parsi'' is an ethno-religious designator, whose definition is of contention among its members, similar to the contention over [[Who is a Jew?|who is a Jew]] in the West.

Some members of the community additionally contend that a child must have a Parsi father to be eligible for introduction into the faith, but this assertion is considered by most to be a violation of the Zoroastrian tenets of [[gender equality]] and may be a remnant of an old legal definition of the term Parsi.

An oft-quoted legal definition of Parsi is based on a 1909 ruling (since nullified) that not only stipulated that a person could not become a Parsi by converting to the Zoroastrian faith but also noted:

{{quote|the Parsi community consists of: a) Parsis who are descended from the original Persian emigrants and who are born of both Zoroastrian parents and who profess the Zoroastrian religion; b) Iranis [here meaning [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]], not the other group of Indian Zoroastrians] professing the Zoroastrian religion; c) the children of Parsi fathers by alien mothers who have been duly and properly admitted into the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sir Dinsha Manekji Petit v. Sir Jamsetji Jijibhai|1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This definition was overturned several times. The equality principles of the [[Constitution of India|Indian Constitution]] void the [[patrilineality|patrilineal]] restrictions expressed in the third clause. The second clause was contested and overturned in 1948. {{Harvard citation|Sarwar Merwan Yezdiar v. Merwan Rashid Yezdiar|1948}} On appeal in 1950, the 1948 ruling was upheld and the entire 1909 definition was deemed an [[obiter dictum]] – a collateral opinion and not legally binding (re-affirmed in 1966). ({{Harvnb|Merwan Rashid Yezdiar v. Sarwar Merwan Yezdiar|1950}}; {{Harvnb|Jamshed Irani v. Banu Irani|1966}}).

Nonetheless, the opinion that the 1909 ruling is legally binding continues to persist, even among the better-read and moderate Parsis.

{{See also|List of countries by Zoroastrian population}}

According to the [[2011 Census of India]], there are 57,264 Parsis in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/life-style/where-we-belong-the-fight-of-parsi-women-in-interfaith-marriages-4900480/|title=Where we belong: The fight of Parsi women in interfaith marriages}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/Parsi-population-dips-by-22-per-cent-between-2001-2011-study/article14508859.ece|title=Parsi population dips by 22 per cent between 2001-2011: study}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[National Commission for Minorities]], there are a "variety of causes that are responsible for this steady decline in the population of the community", the most significant of which were childlessness and migration ({{harvnb|Roy|Unisa|2004|pp=8, 21}}). Demographic trends project that by the year 2020 the Parsis will number only 23,000.&lt;!-- Taraporevala|2000|p=9 --&gt; The Parsis will then cease to be called a community and will be labeled a '[[tribe]]'. &lt;!-- "cease to be termed a community and will be labelled {{sic}} a 'tribe'" --&gt;({{Harvnb|Taraporevala|2000|p=9}}).

One-fifth of the decrease in population is attributed to migration ({{harvnb|Roy|Unisa|2004|p=21}}). A slower birthrate than deathrate accounts for the rest&lt;!-- infant mortality is the other possibility, but is negligible among Parsis--&gt;: as of 2001, Parsis over the age of 60 make up for 31% of the community. Only 4.7% of the Parsi community are under 6 years of age, which translates to 7 births per year per 1000 individuals ({{harvnb|Roy|Unisa|2004|p=14}}). Concerns have been raised in recent years over the rapidly declining population of the Parsi community in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02wmp5q|title=Saving India’s Parsis|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various factors that have led to the decline in Parsi community a few are listed below:

1.Late Marriage &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-Parsi-population-declining-in-India|title=Why is the Parsi population declining in India? - Quora|website=www.quora.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As most of the Parsi women, usually go abroad to seek higher education and are usually more qualified than Parsi men. They would like to stand up on their own- two feet and fetch for themselves. Causing them to get married late as a result of their work. 

2. Fertility Rate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-Parsi-population-declining-in-India|title=Why is the Parsi population declining in India? - Quora|website=www.quora.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to getting married late, the fertility rate decreases in women and their chances of conceiving decreases. 

3. Conversion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-Parsi-population-declining-in-India|title=Why is the Parsi population declining in India? - Quora|website=www.quora.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parsi religion doesn't allow inter- caste marriage, only intra-caste. Hence, if a women gets married to a non- Parsi she is not sought to be a part of the community and is often discarded. She is not allowed to visit the fire temple, not allowed to attended her fathers funeral, do her childs Navjote Ceremony and is often neglected by her parents. 

4. Illnesses&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-Parsi-population-declining-in-India|title=Why is the Parsi population declining in India? - Quora|website=www.quora.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to getting married in their own community since decades, the Parsi gene pool is rather weak and more prone to illness such as cancer, osteoporosis etc. Hence, they are more susceptible to illnesses and their death rates are higher than birth rates.  

&lt;br /&gt;

=== Other demographic statistics ===
The gender ratio among Parsis is unusual: as of 2001, the ratio of males to females was 1000 males to 1050 females (up from 1024 in 1991), due primarily to the high median age of the population (elderly women are more common than elderly men). As of 2001 the national average in India was 1000 males to 933 females.

Parsis have a high [[literacy rate]]; as of 2001, the literacy rate is 97.9%, the highest of any Indian community (the national average was 64.8%). 96.1% of Parsis reside in [[urban area]]s (the national average is 27.8%).

In the Greater Mumbai area, where the density of Parsis is highest, about 10% of Parsi females and about 20% of Parsi males do not marry.({{harvnb|Roy|Unisa|2004|pp=18, 19}})

== History ==
=== Arrival in the Indian sub-continent ===
According to the [[Qissa-i Sanjan]], the only existing account of the early years of Zoroastrian refugees in India composed at least six centuries after their tentative date of arrival, the first group of immigrants originated from [[Greater Khorasan]].{{sfn|Hodivala|1920|p=88}} This historical region of [[Central Asia]] is in part in northeastern Iran, where it constitutes modern [[Khorasan Province]], part of western/northern [[Afghanistan]], and in part in three Central-Asian republics namely [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]].

According to the ''Qissa'', the immigrants were granted permission to stay by the local ruler, [[Jadi Rana]], on the condition that they adopt the local language ([[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]) and that their women adopt local dress (the ''[[sari]]'').{{sfn|Hodivala|1920}} The refugees accepted the conditions and founded the settlement of [[Sanjan (Gujarat)|Sanjan]], which is said to have been named after the city of their origin ([[Sanjan (Khorasan)|Sanjan]], near [[Merv]], modern Turkmenistan).{{sfn|Hodivala|1920|p=88}} This first group was followed by a second group from Greater Khorasan within five years of the first, and this time having religious implements with them (the ''alat''). In addition to these ''Khorasani''s or ''Kohistani''s "mountain folk", as the two initial groups are said to have been initially called,{{sfn|Vimadalal|1979|p=2}} at least one other group is said to have come overland from [[Sari, Iran]].{{sfn|Paymaster|1954}}

[[File:IslamicConquestsIroon.png|thumb|250px|Map of the [[Sasanian Empire]] and its surrounding regions on the eve of the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]]]]
Although the Sanjan group are believed to have been the first permanent settlers, the precise date of their arrival is a matter of conjecture. All estimates are based on the ''Qissa'', which is vague or contradictory with respect to some elapsed periods. Consequently, three possible dates – 716, 765, and 936 – have been proposed as the year of landing, and the disagreement has been the cause of "many an intense battle ... amongst Parsis".{{sfn|Taraporevala|2000}} Since dates are not specifically mentioned in Parsi texts prior to the 18th century, any date of arrival is perforce a matter of speculation. The importance of the ''Qissa'' lies in any case not so much in its reconstruction of events than in its depiction of the Parsis – in the way they have come to view themselves – and in their relationship to the dominant culture. As such, the text plays a crucial role in shaping Parsi identity. But, "even if one comes to the conclusion that the chronicle based on verbal transmission is not more than a legend, it still remains without doubt an extremely informative document for Parsee historiography."{{sfn|Kulke|1978|p=25}}

The Sanjan Zoroastrians were certainly not the first Zoroastrians on the subcontinent.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} [[Sindh]] touching [[Balochistan]], the easternmost periphery of the Iranian world, too had once been under coastal administration of the [[Sasanian Empire]] (226-651), which consequently maintained outposts there.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Even following the loss of [[Sindh]], the Iranians continued to play a major role in the trade links between the east and west.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The 9th-century Arab historiographer [[Al-Masudi]] briefly notes Zoroastrians with fire temples in al-Hind and in al-Sindh.{{sfn|Stausberg|2002|p=I.374}} There is evidence of individual Parsis residing in Sindh in the tenth and twelfth centuries, but the current modern community is thought to date from British arrival in Sindh.&lt;ref name="Hinnells2005"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IHEc31SZStsC|title=The Zoroastrian Diaspora:Religion and Migration: Religion and Migration|author=John R.

The contact between Iranians and Indians was already well established even prior to the [[Common Era]], and both the [[Puranas]] and the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' use the term ''[[Parasika]]s'' to refer to the peoples west of the [[Indus River]].{{sfn|Maneck|1997|p=15}}

"Parsi legends regarding their ancestors' migration to India depict a beleaguered band of religious refugees escaping the new rule post the Muslim conquests in order to preserve their ancient faith."{{sfn|Maneck|1997|p=15}}{{sfn|Paymaster|1954|pp=2–3}}{{sfn|Boyce|2001|p=148}}{{sfn|Lambton|1981|p=205}} {{harvnb|Nigosian|1993|p=42}}) However, while Parsi settlements definitely arose along the western coast of the Indian subcontinent following the Arab conquest of Iran, it is not possible to state with certainty that these migrations occurred as a result of religious persecution against Zoroastrians. If the "traditional" 8th century date (as deduced from the ''Qissa'') is considered valid, it must be assumed "that the migration began while Zoroastrianism was still the predominant religion in Iran [and] economic factors predominated the initial decision to migrate."{{sfn|Maneck|1997|p=15}} This would have been particularly the case if – as the ''Qissa'' suggests – the first Parsis originally came from the north-east (i.e. Central Asia) and had previously been dependent on [[Silk Road]] trade {{Harvard citation|Stausberg|2002|p=I.373}}. Even so, in the 17th century, Henry Lord, a [[chaplain]] with the [[British East India Company]], noted that the Parsis came to India seeking "[[liberty of conscience]]" but simultaneously arrived as "merchantmen bound for the shores of India, in course of trade and merchandise." The fact that Muslims charged non-Muslims higher duties when trading from Muslim-held ports may be interpreted to be a form of religious persecution, but this being the only reason to migrate appears unlikely.

=== Early years ===
The ''Qissa'' has little to say about the events that followed the establishment of Sanjan, and restricts itself to a brief note on the establishment of the "Fire of Victory" (Middle Persian: ''[[Atash Bahram]]'') at Sanjan and its subsequent move to [[Navsari]]. According to Dhalla, the next several centuries were "full of hardships" (''sic'') before Zoroastrianism "gained a real foothold in India and secured for its adherents some means of livelihood in this new country of their adoption".{{Harvard citation|Dhalla|1938|p=447}}

Two centuries after their landing, the Parsis began to settle in other parts of Gujarat, which led to "difficulties in defining the limits of priestly jurisdiction."{{Harvard citation|Kulke|1978|p=29}} These problems were resolved by 1290 through the division of Gujarat into five ''panthak''s (districts), each under the jurisdiction of one priestly family and their descendants. (Continuing disputes regarding jurisdiction over the ''Atash Bahram'' led to the fire being moved to Udvada in 1742, where today jurisdiction is shared in rotation among the five ''panthak'' families.)

Inscriptions at the [[Kanheri Caves]] near Mumbai suggest that at least until the early 11th century, [[Middle Persian]] was still the literary language of the hereditary Zoroastrian priesthood. Nonetheless, aside from the ''Qissa'' and the Kanheri inscriptions, there is little evidence of the Parsis until the 12th and 13th century, when "masterly"{{Harvard citation|Dhalla|1938|p=448}} Sanskrit translations and transcriptions of the [[Avesta]] and its commentaries began to be prepared. From these translations Dhalla infers that "religious studies were prosecuted with great zeal at this period" and that the command of [[Middle Persian]] and Sanskrit among the clerics "was of a superior order".{{Harvard citation|Dhalla|1938|p=448}}.

From the 13th century to the late 16th century, the Zoroastrian priests of Gujarat sent (in all) twenty-two requests for religious guidance to their co-religionists in Iran, presumably because they considered the Iranian Zoroastrians "better informed on religious matters than themselves, and must have preserved the old-time tradition more faithfully than they themselves did" {{Harvard citation|Dhalla|1938|p=457}}. These transmissions and their replies – assiduously preserved by the community as the ''[[rivayat]]''s ([[epistle]]s) – span the years 1478–1766 and deal with both religious and social subjects. From a superficial 21st century point of view, some of these ''ithoter'' ("questions") are remarkably trivial – for instance, ''Rivayat'' 376: whether ink prepared by a non-Zoroastrian is suitable for copying [[Avestan language]] texts – but they provide a discerning insight into the fears and anxieties of the early modern Zoroastrians. Thus, the question of the ink is symptomatic of the fear of assimilation and the loss of identity, a theme that dominates the questions posed and continues to be an issue into the 21st century. So also the question of conversion of ''Juddin''s (non-Zoroastrians) to Zoroastrianism, to which the reply (R237, R238) was: acceptable, even meritorious.{{Harvard citation|Dhalla|1938|pp=474–475}}

Nonetheless, "the precarious condition in which they lived for a considerable period made it impracticable for them to keep up their former [[proselytizing]] zeal. The instinctive fear of disintegration and absorption in the vast multitudes among whom they lived created in them a spirit of exclusiveness and a strong desire to preserve the racial characteristics and distinctive features of their community. Living in an atmosphere surcharged with the Hindu caste system, they felt that their own safety lay in encircling their fold by rigid caste barriers" {{Harvard citation|Dhalla|1938|p=474}}. Even so, at some point (possibly shortly after their arrival in India), the Zoroastrians – perhaps determining that the [[social stratification]] that they had brought with them was unsustainable in the small community – did away with all but the hereditary priesthood (called the ''asronih'' in Sassanid Iran). The remaining estates – the ''(r)atheshtarih'' (nobility, soldiers, and civil servants), ''vastaryoshih'' (farmers and herdsmen), ''hutokshih'' (artisans and labourers) – were folded into an all-comprehensive class today known as the ''behdini'' ("followers of ''daena''", for which "good religion" is one translation). This change would have far reaching consequences. For one, it opened the gene pool to some extent since until that time inter-class marriages were exceedingly rare (this would continue to be a problem for the priesthood until the 20th century). For another, it did away with the boundaries along occupational lines, a factor that would endear the Parsis to the 18th- and 19th-century British colonial authorities who had little patience for the unpredictable complications of the [[Indian caste system|Hindu caste system]] (such as when a clerk from one caste would not deal with a clerk from another).

=== Age of opportunity ===
Following the commercial treaty in the early 17th century between [[Mughal Empire|Mughal emperor]] [[Jahangir]] and [[James I]] of England, the [[East India Company]] obtained the exclusive rights to reside and build factories in [[Surat]] and other areas. Many Parsis, who until then had been living in farming communities throughout Gujarat, moved to the English-run settlements to take the new jobs offered. In 1668 the English East India Company leased the [[Seven Islands of Bombay]] from [[Charles II of England]]. The company found the deep harbour on the east coast of the islands to be ideal for setting up their first port in the sub-continent, and in 1687 they transferred their headquarters from Surat to the fledgling settlement. The Parsis followed and soon began to occupy posts of trust in connection with government and public works.&lt;!--{{Harvnb|Hull|1913}}--&gt;{{sfn|Palsetia|2001|pp=47–57}}

Where literacy had previously been the exclusive domain of the priesthood, in the era of the British Raj the British schools in India provided the new Parsi youth with the means not only to learn to read and write but also to be educated in the greater sense of the term and become familiar with the quirks of the British establishment. These capabilities were enormously useful to Parsis since they allowed them to "represent themselves as being like the British," which they did "more diligently and effectively than perhaps any other South Asian community".{{sfn|Luhrmann|2002|p=861}} While the British saw the other Indians "as passive, ignorant, irrational, outwardly submissive but inwardly guileful",{{sfn|Luhrmann|1994|p=333}} the Parsis were seen to have the traits that the colonial authorities tended to ascribe to themselves. [[Johan Albrecht de Mandelslo]] (1638) saw them as "diligent", "conscientious", and "skillful" in their [[mercantile]] pursuits. Similar observations would be made by [[James Mackintosh]], Recorder of Bombay from 1804 to 1811, who noted that "the Parsees are a small remnant of one of the mightiest nations of the ancient world, who, flying from persecution into India, were for many ages lost in obscurity and poverty, till at length they met a just government under which they speedily rose to be one of the most popular mercantile bodies in Asia".{{sfn|Darukhanawala|Jeejeebhoy|1938|p=33}}

One of these was an enterprising agent named [[Rustom Maneck Seth|Rustom Maneck]]. In 1702, Maneck, who had probably already amassed a fortune under the Dutch and Portuguese, was appointed the first broker to the East India Company (acquiring the name "Seth" in the process), and in the following years "he and his Parsi associates widened the occupational and financial horizons of the larger Parsi community".{{sfn|White|1991|p=304}} Thus, by the mid-18th century, the brokerage houses of the [[Bombay Presidency]] were almost all in Parsi hands. As James Forbes, the Collector of Broach (now [[Bharuch]]), would note in his ''Oriental Memoirs'' (1770): "many of the principal merchants and owners of ships at Bombay and Surat are Parsees." &lt;!-- [...] ---&gt; "Active, robust, prudent and persevering, they now form a very valuable part of the Company's subjects on the western shores of [[Hindustan]] where they are highly esteemed".{{sfn|Darukhanawala|Jeejeebhoy|1938|p=33}}In the 18th century, Parsis with their skills in ship building and trade greatly benefited with trade between India and China.The trade was mainly in timber, silk, cotton and opium. For example [[Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy]] acquired most of his wealth through trade in cotton and opium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Palsetia|first1=Jesse S.|title=The Parsis of India : preservation of identity in Bombay City|date=2001|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden ; Boston ; Köln|isbn=9789004121140|pages=53–56|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=R6oNt3M_yLgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=opium+parsi&amp;ots=cUcgUz8fym&amp;sig=MXhuA5W74fJHqoa9h67egxE9JRc#v=onepage&amp;q=opium%20&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually certain families "acquired wealth and prominence (Sorabji, Modi, Cama, Wadia, Jeejeebhoy, Readymoney, Dadyseth, Petit, Patel, Mehta, Allbless, Tata, etc.), many of which would be noted for their participation in the public life of the city, and for their various educational, industrial, and charitable enterprises."{{sfn|Hull|1913}}{{sfn|Palsetia|2001|pp=37–45, 62-64, 128-140, 334-135}}).

Through his largesse, Maneck helped establish the infrastructure that was necessary for the Parsis to set themselves up in Bombay and in doing so "established Bombay as the primary centre of Parsi habitation and work in the 1720s".{{sfn|White|1991|p=304}} Following the political and economic isolation of Surat in the 1720s and 1730s that resulted from troubles between the (remnant) Mughal authorities and the increasingly dominant [[Maratha]]s, a number of Parsi families from Surat migrated to the new city. While in 1700 "fewer than a handful of individuals appear as merchants in any records; by mid-century, Parsis engaged in commerce constituted one of important commercial groups in Bombay".{{sfn|White|1991|p=312}} Maneck's generosity is incidentally also the first documented instance of Parsi philanthropy. In 1689, [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] chaplain John Ovington reported that in Surat the family "assist the poor and are ready to provide for the sustenance and comfort of such as want it. Their universal kindness, either employing such as are ready and able to work, or bestowing a seasonable bounteous charity to such as are infirm and miserable, leave no man destitute of relief, nor suffer a beggar in all their tribe".{{sfn|Ovington|1929|p=216}}

[[Image:Persians (Parsees) in Bombay 1873.jpg|thumb|right|"Parsis of [[Bombay]]" a wood engraving, ''ca.'' 1878]]
In 1728 Rustom's eldest son Naoroz (later Naorojee) founded the ''Bombay Parsi [[Panchayat]]'' (in the sense of an instrument for [[self-governance]] and not in the sense of the trust it is today) to assist newly arriving Parsis in religious, social, legal and financial matters. Using their vast resources, the Maneck Seth family gave their time, energy and not inconsiderable financial resources to the Parsi community, with the result that by the mid-18th century, the Panchayat was the accepted means for Parsis to cope with the exigencies of urban life and the recognized instrument for regulating the affairs of the community.{{sfn|Karaka|1884|pp=215–217}} Nonetheless, by 1838 the Panchayat was under attack for impropriety and nepotism. In 1855 the ''[[The Times of India|Bombay Times]]'' noted that the Panchayat was utterly without the moral or legal authority to enforce its statutes (the ''Bundobusts'' or codes of conduct) and the council soon ceased to be considered representative of the community.{{sfn|Dobbin|1970|pp=150–151}} In the wake of a July 1856 ruling by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council that it had no jurisdiction over the Parsis in matters of marriage and divorce, the Panchayat was reduced to little more than a Government-recognized "Parsi Matrimonial Court". Although the Panchayat would eventually be reestablished as the administrator of community property, it ultimately ceased to be an instrument for self-governance.{{sfn|Palsetia|2001|pp=223–225}}

At about the same time as the role of the Panchayat was declining, a number of other institutions arose that would replace the Panchayat's role in contributing to the sense of [[structural cohesion|social cohesiveness]] that the community desperately sought. By the mid-19th century, the Parsis were keenly aware that their numbers were declining and saw education as a possible solution to the problem. In 1842 [[Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy]] established the Parsi Benevolent Fund with the aim of improving, through education, the condition of the impoverished Parsis still living in Surat and its environs. In 1849 the Parsis established their first school (co-educational, which was a novelty at the time, but would soon be split into separate schools for boys and girls) and the education movement quickened. The number of Parsi schools multiplied, but other schools and colleges were also freely attended.{{sfn|Palsetia|2001|pp=135–139}} Accompanied by better education and social cohesiveness, the community's sense of distinctiveness grew, and in 1854 [[Dinshaw Maneckji Petit]] founded the Persian Zoroastrian Amelioration Fund with the aim of improving conditions for his less fortunate co-religionists in Iran. The fund succeeded in convincing a number of Iranian Zoroastrians to emigrate to India (where they are known today as Iranis) and the efforts of its emissary [[Maneckji Limji Hataria]] may have been instrumental in obtaining a remission of the [[jizya]] for their co-religionists in 1882.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Parsis had emerged as "the foremost people in India in matters educational, industrial, and social. They came in the vanguard of progress, amassed vast fortunes, and munificently gave away large sums in charity".{{sfn|Dhalla|1948|p=483}} By the close of the 19th century, the total number of Parsis in colonial India was 85,397, of which 48,507 lived in Bombay, constituting 6% of the total population of the city (Census, 1881){{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}. This would be the last time that the Parsis would be considered a numerically significant minority in the city.

Nonetheless, the legacy of the 19th century was a sense of self-awareness as a community&lt;!-- {Palsetia|2001}--&gt;. The typically Parsi cultural symbols of the 17th and 18th centuries such as language (a Parsi variant of [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]), arts, crafts, and sartorial habits developed into [[Parsi theatre]], literature, newspapers, magazines, and schools. The Parsis now ran community medical centres, ambulance corps, [[Scouting]] troops, clubs, and [[Masonic Lodge]]s. They had their own charitable foundations, housing estates, legal institutions, courts, and governance. They were no longer weavers and petty merchants, but now were established and ran banks, mills, heavy industry, shipyards, and shipping companies. Moreover, even while maintaining their own cultural identity they did not fail to recognize themselves as nationally Indian, as [[Dadabhai Naoroji]], the first Asian to occupy a seat in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] would note: "Whether I am a Hindu, a Mohammedan, a Parsi, a Christian, or of any other creed, I am above all an Indian. Our country is India; our nationality is Indian".{{sfn|Ralhan|2002|p=1101}}

== Religious practices ==
The main components of Zoroastrianism as practiced by the Parsi community are the concepts of purity and pollution (nasu), initiation (navjot), daily prayers, worship at Fire Temples, marriage, funerals, and general worship.

=== Purity and pollution ===
The balance between good and evil is correlated to the idea of purity and pollution. Purity is held to be of the very essence of godliness. Pollution's very point is to destroy purity through the death of a human. In order to adhere to purity it is the duty of Parsis to continue to preserve purity within their body as God created them. A Zoroastrian priest spends his entire life dedicated to following a holy life.

=== [[Navjote]] ===
Zoroastrians are not initiated by [[infant baptism]]. Normally, a child is initiated into the faith when he or she is old enough to choose to enter into the faith. The initiation begins with a ritual bath, then a spiritual cleansing prayer; the child changes into white pajama pants, a shawl, and a small cap. Following introductory prayers, the child is given the sacred items that are associated with Zoroastrianism: a sacred shirt and cord, [[sedreh|sudre]], and [[Kushti|kusti]]. The child then faces the main priest and fire is brought in to represent God. Once the priest finishes with the prayers, the child’s initiation is complete and he or she is now a part of the community and religion.

=== Marriage ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}{{main|Zoroastrian wedding}}
[[File:Parsee Wedding 1905.jpg|thumb|Parsi wedding 1905.]]
Marriage is very important to the members of the Parsi community, believing that, in order to continue the expansion of God’s kingdom, they must procreate. Up until the mid-19th century child marriages were common even though the idea of child marriage was not part of the religious doctrine. Consequently, when social reform started happening in India, the Parsi community discontinued the practice. There are, however, rising problems over the availability of brides. More and more women in the Parsi community are becoming well educated and are therefore either delaying marriage or not partaking at all. Women within the Parsi community in India are ninety-seven percent literate; forty-two percent have completed high school or college and twenty-nine percent have an occupation in which they earn a substantial amount of money. The wedding ceremony begins much like the initiation with a cleansing bath. The bride and groom then travel to the wedding in florally decorated cars. The priests from both families facilitate the wedding. The couple begins by facing one another with a sheet to block their view of one another. Wool is passed over the two seven times to bind them together. The two are then supposed to throw rice to their partner symbolizing dominance. The religious element comes in next when the two sit side by side to face the priest.

=== Funerals ===

{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}

{{main|Dakhma}}
[[File:Parsee Tower of Silence, Bombay.jpg|thumb|Parsi Tower of Silence, Bombay.]]
The pollution that is associated with death has to be handled carefully. A separate part of the home is designated to house the corpse for funeral proceedings before being taken away. The priest comes to say prayers that are for the cleansing of sins and to affirm the faith of the deceased. Fire is brought to the room and prayers are begun. The body is washed and inserted clean within a sudre and kusti. The ceremony then begins, and a circle is drawn around the body into which only the bearers may enter. As they proceed to the cemetery they walk in pairs and are connected by white fabric. A dog is essential in the funeral process because it is able to see death. The body is taken to the tower of death where the vultures feed on it. Once the bones are bleached by the sun they are pushed into the circular opening in the center. The mourning process is four days long, and rather than creating graves for the dead, charities are established in honor of the person.

=== Temples ===
[[File:Parsi Fire Temple of Ahmedabad - Gujarat, India (4586854549).jpg|thumb|Parsi Fire Temple of [[Ahmedabad]], India]]
Zoroastrian festivals were originally held outside in the open air; temples were not common until later. Most of the temples were built by wealthy Parsis who needed centers that housed purity. As stated before, fire is considered to represent the presence of Ahura Mazda, and there are two distinct differences for the types of fire for the different temples. The first type of temple is the Atash Behram, which is the highest level of fire. The fire is prepared for an entire year before it can be installed, and once it is, it is cared for to the highest possible degree. There are only eight such temples located within India. The second type of fire temple is called a Dar-i Mihr, and the preparation process is not as intense. There are about 160 of these located throughout India.

== Factions within the community ==
[[Image:Parsi-jashan-ceremony-1.jpg|thumb|right|Parsi ''Jashan'' ceremony (in this case, a house blessing)]]

=== Calendrical differences ===
''This section contains information specific to the Parsi calendar. For information on the calendar used by the Zoroastrians for religious purposes, including details on its history and its variations, see [[Zoroastrian calendar]].''

Until about the 12th century, all Zoroastrians followed the same 365-day religious calendar, which had remained largely unmodified since the calendar reforms of [[Ardashir I of Persia|Ardashir I]] (''r.'' 226-241 AD). Since that calendar did not compensate for the fractional days that go to make up a full solar year, with time it was no longer accordant with the seasons.

Sometime between 1125 and 1250 (''[[cf.]]'' {{Harvnb|Boyce|1970|p=537}}), the Parsis inserted an [[embolismic month]] to level out the accumulating fractional days. However, the Parsis were the only Zoroastrians to do so (and did it only once), with the result that, from then on, the calendar in use by the Parsis and the calendar in use by Zoroastrians elsewhere diverged by a matter of thirty days. The calendars still had the same name, ''Shahenshahi'' (imperial), presumably because none were aware that the calendars were no longer the same.

In 1745 the Parsis in and around Surat switched to the ''Kadmi'' or ''Kadimi'' calendar on the recommendation of their priests who were convinced that the calendar in use in the ancient homeland must be correct. Moreover, they denigrated the ''Shahenshahi'' calendar as being "royalist".

In 1906 attempts to bring the two factions together resulted in the introduction of a third calendar based on an 11th-century [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] model: the ''Fasili'', or ''Fasli'', calendar had leap days intercalated every four years and it had a New Year's day that fell on the day of the [[vernal equinox]]. Although it was the only calendar always in harmony with the seasons, most members of the Parsi community rejected it on the grounds that it was not in accord with the injunctions expressed in Zoroastrian tradition (''[[Denkard|Dēnkard]]'' 3.419){{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}&lt;!-- Should have matching reference in reference list for Denkard--&gt;.

Today the majority of Parsis are adherents of the Parsi version of the ''Shahenshahi'' calendar although the ''Kadmi'' calendar does have its adherents among the Parsi communities of Surat and Bharuch. The ''Fasli'' calendar does not have a significant following among Parsis, but, by virtue of being compatible with the ''Bastani'' calendar (an Iranian development with the same salient features as the ''Fasli'' calendar), it is predominant among the Zoroastrians of Iran.

==== Effect of the calendar disputes ====
Since some of the [[Avesta]] prayers contain references to the names of the months, and some other prayers are used only at specific times of the year, the issue of which calendar is "correct" also has theological ramifications.

To further complicate matters, in the late 18th century (or early 19th century) a highly influential head-priest and staunch proponent of the ''Kadmi'' calendar, Phiroze Kaus Dastur of the Dadyseth Atash-Behram in Bombay, became convinced that the pronunciation of prayers as recited by visitors from Iran was correct, while the pronunciation as used by the Parsis was not. He accordingly went on to alter some (but not all) of the prayers, which in due course came to be accepted by all adherents of the ''Kadmi'' calendar as the more ancient (and thus presumably correct). However, scholars of [[Avestan language]] and linguistics attribute the difference in pronunciation to a vowel-shift that occurred only in Iran and that the Iranian pronunciation as adopted by the ''Kadmi''s is actually more recent than the pronunciation used by the non-''Kadmi'' Parsis.

The calendar disputes were not always purely academic, either. In the 1780s, emotions over the controversy ran so high that violence occasionally erupted. In 1783 a ''Shahenshahi'' resident of Bharuch named Homaji Jamshedji was sentenced to death for kicking a young ''Kadmi'' woman and so causing her to miscarry.

Of the eight Atash-Behrams (the highest grade of [[fire temple]]) in India, three follow the ''Kadmi'' pronunciation and calendar, the other five are ''Shahenshahi''. The ''Fassali''s do not have their own Atash-Behram.

=== Ilm-e-Kshnoom ===
{{Main|Ilm-e-Kshnoom}}
The ''Ilm-e-Kshnoom'' ('science of ecstasy', or 'science of bliss') is a school of Parsi-Zoroastrian philosophy based on a mystic and esoteric, rather than literal, interpretation of religious texts. According to adherents of the sect, they are followers of the Zoroastrian faith as preserved by a clan of 2000 individuals called the ''Saheb-e-Dilan'' ('Masters of the Heart') who are said to live in complete isolation in the mountainous recesses of the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]] (alternatively, in the [[Alborz]] range, around [[Mount Damavand]]).

There are few obvious indications that a Parsi might be a follower of the Kshnoom. Although their ''Kusti'' prayers are very similar to those used by the ''Fassali''s, like the rest of the Parsi community the followers of Kshnoom are divided with respect to which calendar they observe. There are also other minor differences in their recitation of the liturgy, such as repetition of some sections of the longer prayers. Nonetheless, the Kshnoom are extremely conservative in their ideology and prefer isolation even with respect to other Parsis.

The largest community of followers of the Kshnoom lives in Jogeshwari, a suburb of Bombay, where they have their own fire temple (Behramshah Nowroji Shroff Daremeher), their own housing colony (Behram Baug) and their own newspaper (''Parsi Pukar''). There is a smaller concentration of adherents in [[Surat]], where the sect was founded in the last decades of the 19th century.

=== Issues relating to the deceased ===
[[File:St. Mary's Cemetery, Wandsworth 17.JPG|thumb|Parsi funerary monument, [[St. Mary's Cemetery, Wandsworth|St Mary’s Cemetery, Wandsworth]]]]
It has been traditional, in Mumbai and [[Karachi]] at least, for dead Parsis to be taken to the [[Tower of Silence|Towers of Silence]] where the corpses are quickly eaten by the city's [[vultures]]. The reason given for this practice is that earth, fire, and water are considered sacred elements which should not be defiled by the dead. Therefore, burial and cremation have always been prohibited in Parsi culture. However, in modern day Mumbai and Karachi the population of vultures has drastically reduced due to extensive urbanization and the unintended consequence of treating humans and livestock with antibiotics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2009/03/16/rspb.2009.0071.full Cellular and humoral immunodepression in vultures feeding upon medicated livestock carrion].

Retrieved on 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt; and the anti-inflammatory [[diclofenac]], both of which harm vultures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peregrinefund.org/news-release/250 News Release]. The Peregrine Fund (2012-08-23). Retrieved on 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt; This issue led to the [[Indian vulture crisis]], which led to the ban of the drug [[diclofenac]]. As a result, the bodies of the deceased are taking much longer to decompose. Solar panels have been installed in the Towers of Silence to speed up the [[decomposition]] process, but this has been only partially successful especially during monsoons. In [[Peshawar]] a Parsi graveyard was established in the late 19th century, which still exists; this cemetery is unique as there is no [[Tower of Silence]]. Nevertheless, the majority of Parsis still use the traditional method of disposing off their loved ones and consider this as the last act of charity by the deceased on earth.

The Tower of Silence in [[Mumbai]] is located at [[Malabar Hill]]. In [[Karachi]], the Tower of Silence is located in Parsi Colony, near the [[Chanesar Goth]] and [[Mahmudabad, Karachi|Mehmoodabad]] localities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikimapia.org/386604/Tower-of-Silence Tower of Silence, Karachi]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeogenetics==
The genetic studies of Parsis of Pakistan show sharp contrast between genetic data obtained from [[Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroup|mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) and [[Y-chromosome]] DNA (Y-DNA), different from most populations. Historical records suggests that they had moved from Iran to Gujarat, India and then to Mumbai and Karachi, Pakistan. According to Y-DNA, they resemble the Iranian population, which supports historical records. When the mtDNA pool is compared to Iranians and Gujaratis (their putative parental populations), it contrasted Y-DNA data. About 60% of their maternal gene pool originates from South Asian haplogroups, which is just 7% in Iranians. Parsis have a high frequency of [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|haplogroup M]] (55%), similar to Indians, which is just 1.7% in combined Iranian sample. The studies suggest sharp contrast between the maternal and paternal component of Parsis. Due to high diversity in Y-DNA and mtDNA lineages, the strong drift effect is unlikely even though they had a small population. The studies suggest a male-mediated migration of Parsi ancestors from Iran to Gujarat where they admixed with the local female population during initial settlements, which ultimately resulted in loss of Iranian mtDNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quintana-Murci|first=Lluís|last2=Chaix|first2=Raphaëlle|last3=Wells|first3=R.

A study published in ''[[Genome Biology]]'' based on high density [[single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNP]] data has shown that the Parsis are genetically closer to Iranian and Caucasus populations than to their South Asian neighbours. They also share the highest number of haplotypes with present-day Iranians; the admixture of the Parsis with Indian populations was estimated have occurred approximately 1,200 years ago. It is also found that Parsis are genetically closer to [[Neolithic]] Iranians than to modern Iranians who had recently received the genes from the Near East.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Parsis have made considerable contributions to the history and development of India, all the more remarkable considering their small numbers. As the [[Maxim (literature)|maxim]] "Parsi, [[thy name is]] charity" [[allude]]s to, their most prominent contribution is their [[philanthropy]].

Although their people's name Parsi comes from the Persian-language word for a Persian person, in Sanskrit the term&lt;!-- need assistance: wordplay on -parSathas or paraseva? cf: CDSL ApR- --&gt; means "one who gives alms".&lt;ref name=jack/&gt;&lt;ref name=bleek212/&gt; [[Mahatma Gandhi]] would note in a much misquoted statement,&lt;ref&gt;[http://parsikhabar.net/news/can-zoroastrians-save-their-faith/2060/ Can Zoroastrians save their faith?]. Parsi Khabar (2010-01-06). Retrieved on 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt; "I am proud of my country, India, for having produced the splendid [[Zoroastrian]] stock, in numbers beneath contempt, but in charity and philanthropy perhaps unequaled and certainly unsurpassed."{{Harvard citation|Rivetna|2002}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6461">'''Pastoral counseling''' is a branch of [[counseling]] in which [[psychology|psychologically]] trained [[Minister (Christianity)|ministers]], [[rabbis]], [[priests]], [[imams]],  and other persons provide therapy services. Pastoral counselors often integrate modern psychological thought and method with traditional religious training in an effort to address psychospiritual issues in addition to the traditional spectrum of counseling services.&lt;ref name="benner"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Benner|first1=David G.|title=Strategic Pastoral Counseling: A Short-Term Structured Model|date=2003|publisher=Baker Academic|location=Grand Rapids MI|isbn=978-0801026317|pages=13-14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KSdXoLmkAXQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=pastoral+counseling&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiA5dmmtrTTAhWjrlQKHTY5CB4Q6AEIKDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=pastoral%20counseling&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinctiveness==

"What distinguishes pastoral counseling from other forms of counseling and psychotherapy is the role and accountability of the counselor and his or her understanding and expression of the pastoral relationship.  Pastoral counselors are representatives of the central images of life and its meaning affirmed by their religious communities.  Thus pastoral counseling offers a relationship to that understanding of life and faith.  Pastoral counseling uses both psychological and theological resources to deepen its understanding of the pastoral relationship."&lt;ref name="Hunter"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hunter, R.J.|year=2005 |chapter=Pastoral Counseling |title= Dictionary of Pastoral Care and Counseling | location=Nashville |publisher=[[Abingdon Press]]|isbn=0-687-10761-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David G.

==History==
Pastoral counseling had its beginnings a separate discipline in North America in the first half of the twentieth century, as various religious organizations began to incorporate the insights and training of psychiatry, psychology and social work into the training of clergy. In 1925, Dr. Richard Cabot, a physician and adjunct at Harvard Divinity School, published an article in the ''Survey Graphic'' suggesting that every candidate for the ministry receive clinical training for pastoral work similar to the clinical training offered to medical students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|author=Stokes, Rodney|year=1974 |title= Survey Graphic}} reprinted online at [http://www.cappe.org/association/download/cpehistory_stokoe.pdf the Canadian Association for Pastoral Education and Practice website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929171141/http://www.cappe.org/association/download/cpehistory_stokoe.pdf |date=2011-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1930s, the Rev. [[Anton Boisen]] began a program of placing theological students in supervised contact with mental patients.  In time, many seminaries and other training programs for religious professionals began to include [[clinical pastoral education]] as part of clerical training.  Also in the 1930s, the minister [[Norman Vincent Peale]] and the psychiatrist, Dr. Smiley Blanton, collaborated to form the American Foundation of Religion and Psychiatry, now known as the Blanton-Peale Institute. Today, hundreds of mental health centers with links to specific religious traditions may be found across North America.  In 1963, the [[American Association of Pastoral Counselors]] was founded to provide professional certification for pastoral counselors and pastoral counseling centers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090403034355/http://www.aapc.org/content/brief-history-pastoral-counseling American Association of Pastoral Counselors/History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Augsburger"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Augsburger |first=David W.|authorlink=David Augsburger |title =Pastoral Counseling |encyclopedia=[[Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online]] |url=http://www.gameo.org/encyclopedia/contents/P381ME.html |year=1989|accessdate=2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies''' (RMPS) is a national qualification subject offered by the [[Scottish Qualifications Authority]]. RMPS is offered at different levels and the course varies at each level.

== Higher ==
Higher RMPS, like all Higher Still courses has 3 units. The first is world Religion; where candidates have the choice of studying one of 6 religions ([[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]] and [[Sikhism]]). The second is Morality; which deals with sources of moral guidance (such as [[Kantian ethics]], reason and faith, virtue ethics etc.) in addition to one of Gender, Crime and punishment, Medical Ethics or War and Peace.) The third unit is Christianity: Belief and science; which explored the different views science had for creation and origins of the universe ( such as the anthropic principle, teleological argument etc.). Each unit is worth 40 marks in the exam (in the first unit morality is worth 10 and the other choice is worth 30).

In 2011 the results of a three-year study were released, in which it was reported that despite many shortcomings in the way RMPS had been taught in Scotland, the subject was seeing "unprecedented interest and optimism"; the number of students sitting for the  Higher RMPS increased from 1,323 in 2006 to about 4,100 in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Hepburn, [http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6072652 "Religious education makes a comeback"], ''[[Times Educational Supplement]]'', 18 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[sociology of religion]], '''religious capital''' is the investment an individual makes into their [[Faith|religious faith]]. The investment is the time and physical work involved with the religious faith, as well as the personal investment in ideology, doctrine, and practice.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, R. (2007). The Victory of Reason: how Christianity led to freedom, capitalism, and Western success. Random House.[https://books.google.com/books?id=EPkWXgokYLgC&amp;pg=PR56&amp;dq=%22religious+capital%22+stark&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=p3w1UdL5NsbJyAGnooHQAg&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22religious%20capital%22%20stark&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rodney Stark]] has defined it as "(the) degree of mastery of and attachment to a particular religious culture", and has used this theory to explain conversion experiences in a number of his books, notably ''The Victory of Reason: How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism, and Western Success '' and ''The Rise of Christianity: How the Obscure, Marginal Jesus Movement Became the Dominant Religious Force''.&lt;ref&gt;Park, J. Z., &amp; Baker, J. (2007). What would Jesus buy: American consumption of religious and spiritual material goods. Journal for the scientific study of religion, 46(4), 501-517.[https://www.academia.edu/366064/What_Would_Jesus_Buy_American_Consumption_of_Religious_and_Spiritual_Material_Goods]&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the realm of conversion, religious capital theory predicts that individuals will attempt to conserve their religious capital.  Large doctrinal or behavioral changes lose more religious capital than small ones, thus an [[Anglicanism|Episcopalian]] is more likely to become [[Catholic]] than [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] or [[Lutheran]].&lt;ref&gt;Lechner, F. J. (2007). Rational choice and religious economies. Beckford, J. e Demmerath III. NJ (0rgs.) The Sage Handbook of the Sociology of Religion. London: Sage, 81-97.[http://www.sociology.emory.edu/flechner/Rational%20Choice%20and%20Religious%20Economies.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; More recent work is inclined to define the concept in terms of Bourdieu's conception of 'capital' in relation to a particular (religious) field.&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, AM., Trzebiatowska, M. &amp; Brittain, CC.

==Islamic exclusivism==
{{Further|Islam and other religions|Divisions of the world in Islam|Islamism}}

[[Muslim]]s believe that [[Islam]] is the original and primordial faith, or [[fitrah]], that was revealed by [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;[Encyclopædia Britannica "Islam"  http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/295507/Islam] Accessed July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims maintain that [[Prophets in Islam|previous messages and revelations]] have been [[Tahrif|partially changed or corrupted]] over time&lt;ref name="Distorted"&gt;Accad (2003): According to Ibn Taymiya, although only some Muslims accept the textual veracity of the entire Bible, most Muslims will grant the veracity of most of it.&lt;/ref&gt; and consider the [[Quran]] to be the unaltered and the [[Khatam an-Nabiyyin|final revelation]] from Allah. Religious concepts and practices include the [[Five Pillars of Islam|five pillars of Islam]], which are basic concepts and obligatory acts of worship, and following [[Sharia|Islamic law]], which touches on virtually every aspect of life and society, encompassing everything from [[Islamic banking|banking]] and [[zakāt|welfare]], to [[Islamic military jurisprudence|warfare]] and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito (2002b), p.17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esposito (2002b), pp.111, 112, 118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Shari'ah | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam began its history with an exclusivist attitude toward [[polytheist]] religions, but an inclusivist attitude toward monotheists, including Christians and Jews. Believers in the oneness of God were given the status of ''[[dhimmi]]'', conferring on them certain rights, including the right to practice their religions openly and not to be pressured to accept [[Islam]]. 

In practice, however, neither the inclusion of Jews and Christians nor militant exclusivism toward "pagans" was always practiced. Trinitarian Christians were accused of [[idolatry]] because of their veneration of [[icon]]s and were also sometimes treated as polytheists because of the doctrines of the [[Trinity]] and the [[Incarnation]]. As strict monotheists, Jews generally fared better than Christians under Islamic rule. Jews and Christians are viewed largely favorably as compared to any other religion.

The basic attitude of Islam toward other religions remains unchanged today, and certain Islamic nations, such as [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Iran]], are more exclusivistic toward other religions than are others, such as [[Indonesia]] and [[Egypt]].

Islam does accept sincere [[Jew]]s, [[Christian]]s, and [[Sabians]] as [[People of the Book|people "of the Book"]] along with [[Muslim]]s.

==Judaism==

Although most Jews are pluralist or inclusivist some [[Jews]] believe that the [[God in Judaism|God]] of [[Abraham]] is the [[Monotheism|one true God]]. The Jews believe the God of Abraham entered into a [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with the ancient [[Israelites]], marking them as his [[Jews as the chosen people|Chosen People]], giving them a mission to spread the concept of monotheism. Jews do not consider their chosenness to be a mark of superiority to other nations, but a responsibility to be an example of behavior for other nations to emulate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://judaism.about.com/od/judaismbasics/a/jewsaschosenpeople.htm "What Does It Mean For Jews to Be the Chosen People?" Pelaia, Ariela.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
Buddhist religious exclusivism may be seen in the implication that those who do not accept the teachings of the Buddha, such as the [[Eightfold Path]], are destined to repeat the cycle of suffering through endless reincarnations; while those who practice the true way can reach enlightenment. Neo-Buddhist groups sometimes consider their tradition the true path to enlightenment and engage in strong evangelical efforts to influence those they consider to be in darkness. Several sects associated with{{Clarify|date=March 2009}} [[Nichiren Buddhism]] may be included in this category.

However, many followers of [[Eastern religion]]s are not exclusivist. For example, there are millions of [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] who would also consider themselves to follow [[Confucianism]] or [[Taoism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://byustudies.byu.edu/showtitle.aspx?title=7154|title=Testing Stark's Thesis:Is Mormonism the First New World Religion since Islam?|author=Gerald R.

'''Religious offense''' means any action which offends religious [[Sensibility|sensibilities]] and arouses serious negative [[emotions]] in people with strong belief and which is usually associated with an [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] response to, or correction of, [[sin]].

==Causes==

{{main|Sacred-profane dichotomy}}
At the turn of the 20th century the French sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]] considered the dichotomy between the sacred and the profane to be the central characteristic of religion. There is also a dichotomy between religious communities and advocates of [[multiculturalism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Research in Multicultural Education &amp; International Perspectives|author=Farideh Salili &amp; Rumjahn Hoosain (editors) |publisher=Information Age Publishing |date=December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vocabulary used in such debates may sometimes be either confused or confusing, and the misuse of religiously technical terms as understood in secular societies can, in itself cause religious offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Handbook of Conflict Resolution: Theory and Practice|author=Nadja Alexander|year=2001|publisher=Deutsch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sacred===
{{main|Sacred}} 
Things that are sacred are [[Creed|articles of faith]] that are beyond question true sources of [[Ecstasy (emotion)|rapture]] for believers and followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Neurobiology of Bliss - The Sacred and the Profane |first=Nadia|last=Webb|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-neurobiology-of-bliss-sacred-and-profane/|publisher=Scientific American|date=2011-07-12|accessdate =2012-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contradiction or misuse is likely to cause religious offense.

===Secular ===
{{main|Secularity}}
Things that are worldly such as [[technology]] or [[Profession|professional advice]] are sometimes separated from things that are holy or sacred for religious people. Some secular activities may be considered profane and so cause religious offense, even though they may be legally permitted. [[Crime]] is the secular homologue to religious sin.

===Profane===
{{main|Profanum}}
Actions that are not religiously permitted 'inside the faith' are often prohibited within religiously dominated jurisdictions. [[Profanity]] is not necessarily proscribed within secular jurisdictions and so legally permitted actions under [[common law]] may sometimes be considered religiously offensive to people used to religious legal structures.

===Actions which cause offense===
Different [[religion]]s are sensitive to different things in different measure, particularly such topics,  as sexuality, infancy, society, and warfare. It would be impossible to itemize all specific offences defined in all jurisdictions.

However every religion is essentially a set of [[belief]]s conveyed from generation to generation which are, by religious definition, [[Theology|held to be immutable]] [[truth]]s by that religion's believers or followers. Anything that tends to weaken or break that chain of [[authority|authoritative]] continuity is likely to be offensive and in some jurisdictions severely punishable.

Religious offense can be caused [[hate crime|deliberately]] or by [[Religious intolerance]], especially between specific religious beliefs regarding 'sacred truth'. The secular belief that [[freedom of speech]] and the absence of [[censorship]] should allow religious practices or beliefs to be criticized is also a cause of conflict.
{{main|The Satanic Verses}}
The use or misuse of religious [[Paraphernalia]], particularly [[scripture]] may also cause offense. The publication of a prizewinning novel by a Muslim author resulted in several deaths from rioting as well as murders and attempted murders resulting from a [[decree]] issued by a [[Ruhollah Khomeini|religious leader]] who was religiously offended by the work.

==Traditionally==

Traditionally there are three uniquely '''religious offenses''' (acts which cause religious offense):

* [[Heresy]] (wrong choice)  means questioning or [[insubordination|doubting]] dogmatic established beliefs 
* [[Blasphemy]] (evil-speaking) is the act of insulting or showing contempt for a religious [[deity]].  
* [[Apostasy]] (revolt or renunciation) implies or abandoning of a prescribed religious [[duty]], especially [[loyalty|disloyalty]] [[sedition]] and [[defection]]

[[Dogma]] is the belief that a religion necessarily only ever expresses divine truth. Any challenge to [[God|divine authority]] may be homologous  to [[treason]] and attract similar serious [[punishment]], typically the [[death penalty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Erik |last=Owens|title=Religion and the Death Penalty: A Call for Reckoning |isbn=978-0802821720}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Blasphemy laws are darkening Pakistan's skies |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2012/nov/09/blasphemy-laws-darkening-pakistan-skies|publisher=guardian.co.uk|date= 11 November 2012|last=Hameed | first=Salman }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=THE DEATH PENALTY, MERCY AND ISLAM: A CALL FOR RETROSPECTION |url=http://www.scholarofthehouse.org/depemeandisc.html |author= Dr. Khaled Abou El Fadl |publisher=Scholar of the House | accessdate=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==More recently==

More recently the term is used in modern laws which aim promote religious tolerance by forbidding '[[hate crime]]' such as the British  [[Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006]]. To allow 'outsiders' to criticize a religion or its practice might appear to serve to weaken or break the chain of intergenerational "truth-telling".

There is a fine line between secular ideas of [[fair comment]] and religious offence caused by questioning the veracity of [[divine revelation]].

===Legal===
[[Blasphemy law]]s were once almost universal, and are still common in states with strong religious traditions, but such restrictions have been extinguished in most secular jurisdictions that incorporate the principles of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR).

Article 18 of the UDHR allows: "the right to "freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance"; and Article 19 allows: "the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers". With these two articles, Article 18 of the UDHR allows people to hold and express religious ideas and other beliefs or a lack of religious belief that may be offensive to others or to the majority of citizens and Article 19 explicitly mandates [[freedom of speech]] which permits citizens to criticize leaders in a way that some religious people may find seriously offensive.

Some Islamic traditions found this unacceptable and produced [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]] Article 24 of which enshrines [[Sharia]] law as supreme, and that judicial code includes severe penalties including death for the three offences of Heresy, Blasphemy, and Apostacy, and also includes capital punishment for Moslems (persons who are born into Islam or swear allegiance to it) who refuse to kill when required to do so according to law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What does the Religion of Peace Teach About Apostasy|url=http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/Quran/012-apostasy.htm|accessdate=December 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Source is a site dedicated to examining "the ideological threat that Islam poses to human dignity and freedom."|date=August 2017}}

Some extreme religious leaders in such secular societies campaign for the offence of blasphemy to be reinstated to enforce respect for their various religious beliefs above any scientific or moral challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Islamic states to reopen quest for global blasphemy law|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-09-19/news/sns-rt-us-protests-religions-blasphemybre88i1eg-20120919_1_blasphemy-law-muslim-cleric-ekmeleddin-ihsanoglu|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=19 September 2012|accessdate = 14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science===
{{main|Antiscience}}
[[Science]] depends on [[testability]], but, as relatively few advanced scientific  facts are testable by non-scientists, scientific material is sometimes disseminated by reference to learned material which is assumed to be reliable (as presented in Wikipedia references) in much the same way as religionists quote 'reliable' holy scripture. This may lead to science being taught to young people  as a belief in scientific  truth in much the same way as religious truths are taught, For example, when instruction or belief is based on faith in received [[wisdom]] from scholars or from [[textbook]] evidence which may be difficult or impossible for non-specialists to verify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Richard|last=Dawkins|title=Is science a religion?|publisher=The Humanist Magazine (UK)|date=January–February 1997|url=http://www.thehumanist.org/humanist/articles/dawkins.html|accessdate=2012-12-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020822070505/http://www.thehumanist.org/humanist/articles/dawkins.html|archivedate=2002-08-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{main|Relationship between religion and science}}
Religious pseudoscience includes [[witchcraft]] that is beyond traditional [[midwife]]ry practices and [[Maleficium (sorcery)|sorcery]] other than [[traditional medicine]], which insists on [[supernatural]] or [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]al or [[miracle|miraculous]] intervention which is contrary to scientific evidence. For example, the Medieval Catholic faith in Europe was offended by, and persecuted, sometimes killed people whose practices were related to sexuality, particularly [[:fr:Sage-femme|wise women]] now known as [[Midwife|midwives]].&lt;ref name =uta&gt;{{cite book|title=Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven: The Catholic Church and Sexuality|author=Uta Ranke-Heinemann|isbn=0 14 016500 2|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social===
&lt;!-- References are in Danish cartoon article--&gt;
Justifiable criticism, particularly [[Satire|satirizing]] of ideas which in secular cultures may seem absurd  [[belief]]s, but which are considered incontrovertible religious [[fact]]s may be interpreted or misinterpreted as either [[religious persecution]] or [[racism]] if made by outsiders or one of the three traditional offences mentioned above if published by co-religionists.

An example of this is the  [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]]

==Religious law==
{{Main|Religious law}}
Religious law refers to [[ethical code|ethical]] and [[Morality#Moral codes|moral codes]] taught by [[religious tradition]]s. Examples include [[Canon law]] which is [[Christian]] church law, customary ''[[halakha]]' the ' [[Judaism|Jewish]] law, [[Hindu law]], and the above mentioned ''[[Sharia]]'' or [[Islam]]ic law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gad |last=Barzilai |title=Law and Religion|publisher=Ashgate |year=2007 |isbn=9780754624943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin of religion and law===
The origin of religion is uncertain, but it has been suggested that it evolved for the nurture of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mothers and Others: The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding |first=Sarah|last=Blaffer Hrdy |isbn=9780674032996 |publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly much religious law is concerned with sexuality and with childcare.

{{Main|Code of Hammurabi}}

The oldest known comprehensive written law  dates from almost four thousand years ago. It survives because the sixth [[Babylon]]ian king, [[Hammurabi]] had it inscribed  on a human-sized stone ''[[stele]]'' erected in cities throughout his kingdom. Fragments of much earlier [[law code]]s have also survived via records dating from [[Writing#The beginning of writing|dawn of writing]].

The subjects that the Code of Hammurabi covers are similar to modern legal codes, for it includes  religious observance,  social conduct and occupational duties which covers military and contractual obligations as well as the control of slavery throughout all of Babylon at that time.

===Gender equality===
[[Gender equality]] is a relatively recent philosophy, mainly evolved in the [[Western world]] during the 20th century. Previously, sexual discrimination was socially commonplace and legally institutionalized, perhaps because distinct gender roles may have had some [[prehistory|early human]] survival&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Homo religiosus - The Natural History of Religion|url=http://www.scilogs.eu/en/blog/biology-of-religion/2009-05-11/homo-religiosus-the-natural-history-of-religion| date=11 May 2009|accessdate=12 December 2012|first=Michael|last=Blume|publisher=SciLogs}}&lt;/ref&gt; or  [[Economic history|historical economic]] value&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Complementarianism: Religion, Women's Work and the Economy|first=Soraya|last=Chemaly|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/soraya-chemaly/mitt-romneys-faith-is-ent_b_1581284.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=2012-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  or else may have promoted [[social cohesion]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights dates only from the mid-20th century (it was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 10 December 1948, and then incorporated into various legal systems some time after that). However UNHDR Articles 1 and 2 had, by the early 21st century, frequently been interpreted by [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] [[jurist]]s such that any form of (non-biological) [[Sexism|sexual discrimination]] has become illegal in many secular countries, while in legal jurisdictions strongly influenced by religious considerations sex discrimination may still be legally required and sometimes rigorously enforced.&lt;ref&gt;Neuwirth, Jessica (2004). [http://www.msmagazine.com/summer2004/globalwomenlaw.asp "Unequal: A Global Perspective on Women Under the Law"]. ''Ms. Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scriptural Infallibility===
{{main|Infallibility#In_theology}}
Because writing is not susceptible to the sort of corruption common in verbal communication scripture can be revered and held sacred, so any criticism or inclusion in secondary works is likely to be offensive to some religionists. A [[little big planet|game]] which included two short scriptural phrases was considered offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/3227971/Sony-Playstation-game-Little-Big-Planet-delayed-after-anti-Muslim-claims.html|title=Sony Playstation game Little Big Planet delayed after anti-Muslim claims |date=2008-10-20|accessdate=2012-12-18|publisher=Telegraph newspaper UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4118">The '''sacred–profane dichotomy''' is an idea posited by [[France|French]] [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[Émile Durkheim]], who considered it to be the central characteristic of [[religion]]: "religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to ''sacred things'', that is to say, things set apart and forbidden."&lt;ref&gt;Emile Durkheim, ''The elementary forms of Religious Life'', ed. and trans. by Karen E. Fields. (New York: The Free Press, 1995), p. 35.[http://home.ku.edu.tr/~mbaker/cshs503/durkheimreligiouslife.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In Durkheim's theory, the [[Sacred (comparative religion)|sacred]] represented the interests of the group, especially unity, which were embodied in sacred group symbols, or ''[[totems]]''. The [[profanum|profane]], on the other hand, involved mundane individual concerns. Durkheim explicitly stated that the sacred–profane dichotomy was not equivalent to [[good and evil|good/evil]]. The sacred could be good or evil, and the profane could be either as well.&lt;ref&gt;Pals 1996, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

Durkheim's claim of the universality of this dichotomy for all religions/[[cult]]s has been criticized by scholars such as British [[anthropologist]] [[Jack Goody]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/p35161/mobile/ch06s03.html|title=The sacred-profane distinction is not universal|last=|first=|date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2007-07-10|work=}} quote: "neither do the [[Lo Dagaa]] [group in Gonja, ''editor note''] appear to have any concepts at all equivalent to the vaguer and not unrelated dichotomy between the sacred and the profane"&lt;/ref&gt; Goody also noted that "many societies have no words that translate as sacred or profane and that ultimately, just like the distinction between natural and supernatural, it was very much a product of [[European religious thought]] rather than a universally applicable criterion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/11183/Sacred-Profane-Durkheim-s-Critics.html |title=Sacred and Profane - Durkheim's Critics |accessdate=2007-07-10 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Tomoko Masuzawa explains in ''The Invention of World Religions: Or, How European Universalism Was Preserved in the Language of Pluralism'', this system of comparative religion privileged Christianity at the expense of non-Christian systems (2005). Any cosmology without a sacred/profane binary was rendered invisible by the field of religious studies, because the binary was supposed to be 'universal'.

The '''''shi''''' ({{zh|c=尸|p=''shī''|w=''sh'ih''|l=corpse}}) was a ceremonial "personator" who represented a dead relative during ancient [[Ancestor Veneration in China|Chinese ancestral sacrifices]]. In a ''shi'' ceremony, the ancestral spirit supposedly would enter the descendant "corpse" personator, who would eat and drink sacrificial offerings and convey messages from the spirit. [[James Legge]] (1895 IV:135), an early translator of the Chinese classics, described ''shi'' personation ceremonies as "grand family reunions where the dead and the living met, eating and drinking together, where the living worshipped the dead, and the dead blessed the living." In modern terms, this ancient Chinese ''shi'' practice would be described as [[necromancy]], [[mediumship]], or [[spirit possession]].

The word ''shi'' 尸 "corpse; personator; inactive; lay out; manage; spirit tablet" can be discussed in terms of [[Chinese character]] evolution, [[Historical Chinese phonology|historical phonology]], [[semantics]], and English translations.

===Characters===
The modern character [[Wikt:尸|尸]] for ''shi'' "corpse; personator" is a graphic simplification of ancient [[pictograph]]s showing a person with a bent back and dangling legs. The first records of ''shi'' are on [[oracle bones]] dating from the late [[Shang Dynasty]] (ca. 1600–ca. 1046 BCE). The [[oracle bone script]] for ''shi'' 尸 "corpse" was used interchangeably for ''yi'' [[Wikt:夷|夷]] "barbarian; non-Chinese people (esp. eastern, see ''[[Dongyi]]''); at ease; level". The [[bronze script]] for ''shi'' 尸, found in [[Chinese bronze inscriptions]] dating from the Shang and [[Zhou Dynasty]] (ca. 1045 BCE-ca. 256 BCE), had a more curved back and legs. The graphically reduced [[seal script]] for ''shi'', standardized during the [[Qin Dynasty]] (221-207 BCE), resembles the [[regular script]] 尸.

Today, ''shi'' 尸 is more commonly used as the [[Radical 44|"corpse/body radical"]] in [[Chinese characters]] (number 44 in the [[List of Kangxi radicals]]) than to write the original word "corpse". Many characters written with this radical involve the body (e.g., ''niao'' [[Wikt:尿|尿]] "urine" with 水 "water"), but not all (e.g., ''wu'' [[Wikt:屋|屋]] "house; room" with 至 "go to"). 

''Shi'' 尸 "corpse; cadaver" has a [[variant Chinese character]] [[Wikt:屍|屍]] that combines the "corpse radical" 尸 with ''si'' [[Wikt:死|死]] "dead" (e.g., ''[[jiang shi]]'' 僵屍 "stiff corpse") Michael Carr (2007:358) explains, "This semantically redundant ''shi'' 屍 'dead-corpse' graphically distinguishes the original 'corpse' meaning of ''shi'' 尸from its various other meanings such as 'personator'."

===Meanings===
[[Chinese classics]] used the word ''shi'' 尸 in six meanings: 
*(1) "corpse; body of a dead person"
*(2) "personator of a dead ancestor"
*(3) "motionless; inactive"
*(4) "lay out; arrange; expose"
*(5) "manage; direct; spirit tablet"
*(6) "proper names (of a place, family, and bird)"
Carr (2007:362) outlines the semantic connections among these ''shi'' meanings. The basic meaning (1) "corpse" was semantically extended into both (2) "act on behalf of a corpse" or "personator of a dead ancestor" and (3) "act like a corpse" or "motionless; inactive; doing nothing". Meaning (4) "lay out, arrange; display" generalizes "lay out a corpse." Meaning (5) "manage; direct; ancestral tablet" links the representative ''shi'' (2) "personator" with the metaphorical replacement "ancestral tablet". Meaning (6) uses ''shi'' to transcribe proper names.

Meaning (1) is the core sense of "corpse; dead body; cadaver; carcass". Early ritual texts, notably the ''[[Liji]]'' "Classic of Rites", ''[[Zhouli]]'' "Rites of Zhou", and ''[[Etiquette and Rites|Yili]]'' "Etiquette and Rites", frequently use ''shi'' "corpse" in [[mortuary]] and [[funeral]] contexts. Here is an example ''Liji'' passage:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As soon as death took place, the corpse was transferred to the couch, and covered with a large sheet. The clothes in which the deceased had died were removed. A servant plugged the mouth open with the spoon of horn; and to keep the feet from contracting, an easy stool was employed. These observances were the same for a ruler, a great officer, and an ordinary officer. (22, tr. Legge 1885 28:181)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Shi'' meaning (2) "personator; sacrificial representative of a dead person's spirit" is discussed below.

Meaning (3) figuratively expands ''shi'' to "corpse-like", which can contextually mean either "motionless; calm; quiescent" or "inactive; negligent; remiss". A ''Shijing'' ode (245, tr. Karlgren 1950:214) laments that, "the good men sit motionless and silent". Karlgren explains, "'The good men act the corpse,' play the part of a representative of the dead at a sacrifice, who sits still and silent during the whole ceremony; here then, remain inactive, do nothing to help." The ''[[Lunyu]]'' ("Confucian Analects") uses ''shi'' to praise [[Confucius]] (tr. Legge 1895 I:235), "In bed, he did not lie like a corpse." Commentators disagree whether this means "sleep with the arms and legs sprawled out" or "sleep facing the north (the land of the dead)".

Meaning (4) is defined as Chinese ''chen'' [[Wikt:陳|陳]] "lay out; set forth, array; arrange; display". Examples in classic texts range from specifically "lay out (a corpse)" to generally "lay out; set out; arrange". The ''Liji'' distinguishes between ''shi'' 尸 "uncoffined corpse" and ''jiu'' [[Wikt:柩|柩]] (with the "wood radical" and a ''jiu'' 匛 "long; enduring" phonetic) "coffined corpse" (tr. Legge 1885 27:117): "(The corpse) on the couch is called [''shi''] (the laid out); when it is put into the coffin, that is called [''jiu''] (being in the long home)." A ''[[Shijing]]'' poem (185, tr. Karlgren 1950) refers to men called off to war, "There are mothers who set forth the (sacrificial) dishes."

Meaning (5) of ''shi'' is defined as ''zhu'' [[Wikt:主|主]] "master; manage, preside; spirit tablet, ancestral tablet". The ''[[Chuci]]'' (tr. Hawkes 1959:55) uses ''shi'' asking about [[King Wu of Zhou]], whose father [[King Wen of Zhou]] did not live to see the conquering of the previous dynasty, Shang-Yin: "When Wu set out to kill Yin, why was he so grieved? He went into the battle carrying the 'corpse.' Why was he in such haste?" Commentators disagree whether this ''shi'' means ''zhu'', specifically ''muzhu'' 木主 "wooden spirit/ancestral tablet" or ''jiu'' "corpse in a coffin". Hawkes justifies translating "corpse": "According to some accounts it was the 'spirit tablet' of his dead father [King Wen] which King Wu carried in his chariot to battle. But I think the poet understood him to have taken the actual corpse, and was surprised that he had not waited to bury it."

The sinologists Eduard Erkes and Bernhard Karlgren debated this ''Chuci'' usage of ''shi'' "corpse; spirit tablet". Erkes (1928) proposed that the ''zhu'' was a wooden ancestral tablet shaped in the image of the deceased. Karlgren (1930) disagreed and argued that the ''zhu'' was phallic shaped:
&lt;blockquote&gt;He seems to think that the substitution of [muzhu] 'wooden tablet' for the corpse (if really a corpse is intended; the word shi is ambiguous) proves the [muzhu] to have been an image of the corpse, and therefore he translates [muzhu] by 'wooden statue.' Nothing could be more arbitrary. The [muzhu], wooden ancestral tablet, was the resting place of the ancestor's spirit, once his body was dead and decomposed. In this sense it was a substitute for his body, his spiritual force had entered it, and therefore it was carried into battle, bringing this mental force of his into play on the side of his descendant. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Erkes (1931) countered Karlgren by citing other texts describing a human-shaped ''muzhu'' "wooden lord". For instance, the ''[[Shiji]]'' ("Record of History", tr. Erkes) records this King Wu story with ''muzhu'' instead of ''shi'': "He (viz. Wu-Wang) made a wooden image of Wen-Wang and took it with [him] on his carriage into the battle." Erkes further suggested, "very probably the custom of carrying a [muzhu] into battle had developed from an earlier one of taking the body itself, and that therefore the [muzhu] was something representing the corpse, i.e., an image of the deceased."

Meaning (6) includes some semantically unrelated usages of ''shi''. ''Shi'' 尸 is an ancient place name (in [[Henan]]); a surname (e.g., the [[Syncretism (Chinese philosophy)|Syncretist]] philosopher [[Shizi (book)|Shizi]] 尸子, ca. 390–330 BCE); and a variant of ''shi'' [[Wikt:鳲|鳲]] (which is used in bird names like ''shijiu'' 鳲鳩 "cuckoo; turtledove").

===Pronunciations and etymologies===
The [[Standard Chinese]] ''shī'' pronunciation of 尸 phonologically descends from (ca. 6th century CE) [[Middle Chinese]] and (ca. 6th century BCE) [[Old Chinese]]. Compare these Middle and Old Chinese reconstructions of ''shi'' 尸 "corpse" and ''yi'' 夷 "barbarian" (which anciently had interchangeable characters): ''śi'' &lt; *''śjər'' 尸and ''i'' &lt; *''djər'' 夷 ([[Bernhard Karlgren]] 1957), ''syij'' &lt; *''hljij'' 尸and ''yij'' &lt; *''ljɨj'' 夷 (William Baxter 1992), and ''śi'' &lt; *''lhi'' 尸 and ''ji'' &lt; *''ləi'' 夷 (Axel Schuessler 2009).

There are several hypothetical [[etymologies]] for ''shi'' "corpse". Karlgren proposed that ''si'' &lt; *''sjər'' 死 "die, dead" and ''shi'' &lt; *''śjər'' 尸 "the dead, corpse" were etymologically [[cognate]]. Paul K. Benedict (1972) suggested possible [[Proto-Sino-Tibetan]] roots for ''shi'': either *''(s-)raw'' "corpse; carcass" or *''siy'' "die". Schuessler (2007) hypothesizes a semantic development from *''li'' 夷 "extend; expose; display; set out; spread out" to *''lhi'' 尸 "to spread out; lie down flat (in order to sleep); motionless; to set forth (sacrificial dishes)", to "personator of a dead ancestor", to "corpse". He rejects Karlgren's assumption that ''shi'' "corpse" is cognate to ''si'' "to die", "because the MC [Middle Chinese] initial ''ś-'' (&lt; *''lh-'', *''nh-'', *''hj-'') never derives from an *''s-'', except when they share an initial *''l'' or *''n''."

===Translations===
English translations of the ceremonial ''shi'' 尸 include ''[[personator]]'', ''[[impersonator]]'', ''[[:wikt:representative|representative]]'', ''[[Mediumship|medium]]'', and ''[[shaman]]''. Carr reviews the choices.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Obviously, rendering this into English is problematic because there is no Western analogy for the ceremonial ''shi'' 'corpse.' ''Personator'' is chosen as the nearest English translation. ''Impersonator'' would be possible, but this word implies falsehood, which was not originally associated with the ''shi''. ''Representative'' is too general in meaning, and does not usually have a sense of spirituality, unless modified by ''of the dead/ancestor''. Paper [1995] suggests ''Incorporator of the Dead'', which has a parallel 'one who embodies' etymology, but the derivate words ''incorporate'' and ''incorporation'' commonly have other meanings. ''Medium'' and ''shaman'' are similar with ''shi'' in meaning and are part of Chinese traditions; however, the descriptions of a dignified personator are unlike the spirit-possession of either. Another translational tactic would be to coin a [[nonce word]], such as Waley's [1937] "the Dead One," Eberhard's [1968] "death boy," or Wilhelm's [1967] "corpse boy," but the sense of such a coinage is not always clear. Therefore, in the absence of a better English word, ''personator'' will translate this meaning of ''shi''. (2007:364-365) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Early descriptions==
Zhou Dynasty classic texts (c. 11th-3rd centuries BCE) use the word ''shi'' 尸 hundreds of times. Lothar von Falkenhausen contrasts the frequently recorded ''shi'' "personator" with the rarely noted [[Wu (shaman)|''wu'']] [[Wikt:巫|巫]] "shaman; spirit medium". 
&lt;blockquote&gt;At ancestral sacrifices, the ancestral spirits descend into individuals designated from among their descendants, the "Impersonators" (''shi'' 尸). Occupying their ritual rôle by virtue of their kinship position vis-à-vis the ancestor that is sacrificed to, the Impersonators are not trained religious specialists like the Spirit Mediums. Although it has been speculated that the actions of the ''shi'' may have originally involved trance and possession, the surviving source materials — none earlier than the Western Zhou period — show them as staid and passive, acting with the utmost demeanor and dignity. (1995) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some early ''shi'' meanings are contextually ambiguous. For instance, the ''[[Yijing]]'' ("Book of Changes") uses ''yu shi'' [[Wikt:輿|輿]]尸 "carry corpses; corpse carrier" twice for [[I Ching hexagrams#Hexagram 7|Hexagram 7]] (tr. Wilhelm 1967:34-35): "Perchance the army carries corpses in the wagon. Misfortune … Let the eldest lead the army. The younger transports corpses. Then perseverance brings misfortune." [[Richard Wilhelm (sinologist)|Richard Wilhelm]] summarizes the ''Yijing'' commentaries.
&lt;blockquote&gt; Here we have a choice of two explanations. One points to defeat because someone other than the chosen leader interferes with the command; the other is similar in its general meaning, but the expression, "carries corpses in the wagon," is interpreted differently. At burials and at sacrifices to the dead it was customary in China for the deceased to whom the sacrifice was made to be represented by a boy of the family, who sat in the dead man's place and was honored as his representative. On the basis of this custom the text is interpreted as meaning that a "corpse boy" is sitting in the wagon, or, in other words, that authority is not being exercised by the proper leaders but has been usurped by others. (1967:34) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Marshall (2002:77) concludes this hexagram refers to carrying a corpse, and compares the "Israelites carrying the Ark of the Covenant into battle against the Philistines".

===Shijing===
The ''[[Shijing]]'' ("Classic of Poetry", ca. 11th-6th centuries BCE) contains early and detailed descriptions of personation ceremonies, in the following themes.
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is an abundance of sacrificial wine and food (odes 166, 209, 210, and 248) shared by both the ancestral spirits (through the personator) and their descendants. Drunkenness is frequently mentioned: 209/5 "The spirits [note: 'souls' not 'liquor'] are all drunk," 209/6 "all are happy; they are drunk," 247/1, 2 "We are drunk with wine," and 248/5 "the representative of the (dead) princes comes and feasts and is befumed (by the spirits); the good wine makes you merry." Most significantly, the ancestral spirits speak directly through the intoxicated personators (166, 210, and 247), approve of the sacrificial offerings, and bless their descendants (166, 209, 210, 247, and 248). (Carr 2007:369) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Shi'' "personator" occurs fourteen times in two pairs of consecutive ''Shijing'' odes (209–210 and 247–248, tr. Karlgren 1950:203-204). Ode 209 says "we make (the representative of the dead) sit at ease, we (assist him =) encourage him to eat" and "The august representative of the dead then rises, the drums and bells (by their sound) escort away the representative." The following ode 210 describes sacrificial wine and food, "he presents them  to our representative of the dead and to our guests."

''Shijing'' odes 247 and 248, which portray ancestral feasts to the Zhou royal house, exclusively use the term ''gongshi'' 公尸 with the modifier ''gong'' [[Wikt:公|公]] "prince; duke; public; palace; effort". Compare these ''gongshi'' translations: "representative of the (dead) princes" (Karlgren), "personators of your ancestors" (Legge, admitting 1895 IV:447, "The expression 公尸, 'ducal personators,' is somewhat difficult to account for"), "impersonator of the Ancient", "ducal Dead", or "Dead One" (Waley, noting 1937:215, "Impersonator of a former Duke or ruler"). Ode 247 (''Jizui'' 既醉 "Already Drunk") describes a sacrificial feast for ancestral spirits, and says "the representative of the (dead) princes makes a happy announcement".

Ode 248 (''Fuyi'' 鳧鷖 "Wild Ducks") describes another feast, which commentators say was held on the following day to reward the personator, and details sacrificial offerings and ancestral blessings.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The wild ducks are on the [Jing] (river); the representative of the (dead) princes comes and feasts and is at peace; your wine is clear, your viands are fragrant; the representative feasts and drinks; felicity and blessings come and (achieve, complete you =) make you perfect. &lt;br&gt;
The wild ducks are on the sands; the representative of the (dead) princes comes and feasts and (approves =) finds it good; your wine is plentiful, your viands are fine; the representative feasts and drinks; felicity and blessings come and (act for =) favor you. &lt;br&gt;
The wild ducks are on the island; the representative of the (dead) prices comes and feasts and reposes; your wine is strained, your viands are sliced; the representative feasts and drinks; felicity and blessings come and descend on you. &lt;br&gt;
The wild ducks are at the junction of the river; the representative of the (dead) princes comes and feasts and is (treated in temple-fashion =) revered; the feast is in the temple, that is where felicity and blessings descend; the representative feasts and drinks; felicity and blessings come and are piled up (heavily =) amply on you. &lt;br&gt;
The wild ducks are in the gorge; the representative of the (dead) princes comes and feasts and is befumed (by the spirits); the good wine makes you merry; the roast and broiled things are fragrant; the representative feasts and drinks; there will be no after trouble. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Besides the ''Shijing'', other texts refer to ''shi'' frequently drinking sacrificial [[Chinese alcoholic beverages|''jiu'']] 酒 "alcoholic beverage; liquor", which Paper (1995:113) interprets as a ritual means to induce hallucinations of ancestral spirits. Based upon a ''Liji'' ceremony (tr. Legge 1885 28:246) describing a ''shi'' personator drinking nine cups of ''jiu'', with an estimated alcohol content from 5% to 8%, and volume measurements of Zhou bronze sacrificial cups, Paper (1995:114) calculates a "conservative estimate is that the ''shi'' consumed between 2.4 and 3.9 ounces of pure alcohol (equivalent to between 5 and 8 bar shots of eighty-proof liquor)."

===Child personators===
Several texts refer to a Chinese custom that a personator should be a child of the same sex as the dead ancestor, preferably either a legitimate grandson or his wife. However, personation by younger relatives, who were of lower [[social status]] than their elders, created an exception to traditional Chinese culture. The earliest textual reference comes from the ''[[Mencius (book)|Mengzi]]'' ("Book of Mencius") questioning the status shown to a younger brother during the personation ceremony.
&lt;blockquote&gt;You should ask him, "Which do you respect most, — your uncle, or your younger brother?" He will answer, "My uncle." Ask him again, "If your younger brother be personating a dead ancestor, to which do you show the greater respect, — to him or to your uncle?" He will say, "To my younger brother." You can go on, "But where is the respect due, as you said, to your uncle?" He will reply to this, "I show the respect to my younger brother because of the position which he occupies." (6, tr. Legge 1895 IV:400). &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''Liji'' reiterates that personation contradicted the established social hierarchy (18, tr. Legge 1895 28:88): "Thus it is that there are two among his subjects whom the ruler does not treat as subjects. When one is personating (his ancestor) he does not treat him as such, nor does he treat his master as such." Another ''Liji'' passage (7, tr. Legge 1895 27:337-338) explains: "A rule of propriety says, 'A superior man may carry his grandson in his arms, but not his son.' This tells us that a grandson may be the personator of his deceased grandfather (at sacrifices), but a son cannot be so of his father." When a grandson personated his grandfather's spirit, it reversed the normal family hierarchy and a father would have to worship his own son. 

Scholars have differing hypotheses explaining why a grandchild would make the most suitable personator. [[Marcel Granet]] (1930:337–338) said the basic reason was a predominance of uterine over agnatic [[primogeniture]]; the grandfather is the closest of the uterine relatives, and thus closer to his grandson than the father is. [[Wolfram Eberhard]] (1968:338) explained that a child makes the best personator owing to the ancient Chinese believed that a soul is small. [[Julian Jaynes]] (1976:344–345) mentions a Greek parallel; the philosopher [[Iamblichus]] wrote that "young and simple persons" make the most suitable mediums. Stephen Bokenkamp mentions examples besides ''shi'' rituals.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In China, possessions by spirits that occurred outside of this ritual scenario often involved younger members of the family as well. As in instances of mediumism around the world, the youthful and illiterate were regarded as more reliable conduits to the dead, since they could hardly be suspected of having fabricated their utterances and writings themselves. This fact brings to the fore questions of power. Women and junior male members of a family frequently found that mediumism was a way to bring attention to their own, otherwise easily ignored, concerns. (2007:40) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Female personators===
Two ritual texts mention female personators. The ''Liji'' (15, tr. Legge 1885 28:75) describes a wife personating her husband's dead grandmother: "A wife, on festive occasions, even though it were on receiving a gift from the ruler, (only) made a curtsy. When seated as a personatrix (of the deceased grandmother of her husband), she did not bow with her head to her hands, but made the curtsy." The ''Yili'' (14, tr. Steele 1917:119.) euphemistically says a female personator should preferably not be the wife of a concubine's grandson; "A man personates a dead man, and a woman a woman. In the latter case a woman of a different surname is chosen, and as such not one of inferior standing."

===Historical changes in personation===
Several early texts and commentaries reiterate a traditional history of personation beginning in the second millennium BCE as a sacred communion with ancestral spirits, but ending as a drinking party in the late 1st millennium BCE. When the personation ceremony supposedly originated during the [[Xia Dynasty]] (ca. 2100-ca. 1600 BCE), a personator would make contact with the dead ancestral spirit before sitting down to eat and drink. During the Yin or Shang Dynasty (ca. 1600-1046 BCE), a personator would sometimes sit down without having contacted the spirit, and by the late Zhou Dynasty (1045-256 BCE), a personation ceremony became a revelry with several personators repeatedly making toasts and drinking sacrificial wines.

Two ''Liji'' chapters describe how personation rituals changed during the Zhou period.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Under the [Zhou] dynasty the representatives of the dead sat. Their monitors and cup-suppliers observed no regular rules. The usages were the same (as those of Yin [Shang]), and the underlying principle was one. Under the [Xia] dynasty, the personators had stood till the sacrifice was ended (whereas) under the Yin [Shang] they sat. Under [Zhou], when the cup went round among all, there were six personators. [Zengzi] said, "The usages of [Zhou] might be compared to a subscription club." (10, tr. Legge 1885 27:405-406) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(When the representative of the departed) had made the libation with the [jia] cup, or the horn, (the sacrificer) was told (to bow to him) to put him at ease. Anciently, the representative stood when nothing was being done; when anything was being done, he sat. He personated the spirit. The officer of prayer was the medium of communication between him and the sacrificer. (11, tr. Legge 1885 27:446) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Later sources repeat this legendary history of personation. For example, He Xiu 何休's 2nd-century commentary to the ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals|Chunqiu]]'' ("Spring and Autumn Annals") ''[[Gongyang Zhuan]]'' says (tr. Carr 2007:371), "The Xia had standing personators, the Shang [Yin] had sitting personators, and the Zhou had six personators who would make serial toasts." Granet (1930:337) mentions the Zhou personation parties: "It was not long before this archaic custom was criticized by the ritualists. When the sacrifices were offered simultaneously to several ancestors each of whom was represented, the ceremony was found indeed to assume a displeasing likeness to a picnic."

===Doubts about personation===
The above ''Liji'' description of Zhou "subscription club" personation ceremonies quotes [[Confucius]]'s student and compiler [[Zengzi]] (505-436 BCE). The ''Liji'' contains three passages where Zengzi questions his teacher about whether personators were needed for ancestral rituals. For instance:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Zengzi] asked, "Is it necessary that there should be a representative of the dead in sacrifices? Or may he be dispensed with as when the satisfying offerings are made to the dead?" Confucius said, "In sacrificing to a full-grown man for whom there have been the funeral rites, there must be such a representative, who should be a grandson; and if the grandson is too young, someone must be employed to carry him in his arms. If there be no grandson, some one of the same surname should be selected for the occasion. In sacrificing to the one who had died prematurely, there are (only) the satisfying offerings, for he was not full-grown. To sacrifice to a full-grown man, for whom there have been the funeral rites without a representative, would be to treat him as if he had died prematurely." (7, tr. Legge 1885 27:337-338) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Hypothetical origins ==
Chinese scholars have long disagreed about when and how ''shi'' personation originated. Henri Doré (1914 1:99-102) summarizes the four principal opinions, which are worth quoting in full.

The first opinion is that personation was a bygone superstition. The [[Tang Dynasty]] historian [[Du You]] criticizes the ''shi'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;The ancients employed a personator. This rite deserves censure, and has been abolished by our great Worthies. One vied with the other in practicing it. Now that an era of progress has set in, and these silly customs have disappeared, it is important not to revive them; common sense bids to refrain from them. Some half-baked literati of our days would fain re-establish this ceremony of the personator. This is quite absurd. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The second opinion is that the personator was not the agent of the departed, but merely its metaphorical representative or ''shenxiang'' 神象 "image of the spirit". The [[Han Dynasty]] historian [[Ban Gu]] explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The personator is found in the ceremony wherein sacrifice is offered to ancestors, because the soul emitting no perceptible sounds and having no visible form, the loving sentiment of filial piety finds no means of displaying itself, hence a personator has been chosen to whom meats are offered, after which he breaks the bowls, quite rejoiced, as if his own father had eaten plenty. The personator, drinking abundantly, imparts the illusion that it is the soul which is satiated. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Carr (2007:386) notes, "This passage sounds as though Ban had personally observed a personation ceremony."    
   
Some [[Qing Dynasty]] scholars held a third opinion, namely, that the personator was bearer of the ancestral tablet. The ''Jishuo quanzhen'' 集說詮真 "Collected Sayings Explaining Truth" says, "The filial son chooses a personator to carry the tablet, but not to be the resting place of the soul of the dead person. His intention is therefore manifest." The ''Yuzhou dayiyi'' 宇宙大疑議 "Discussion of Universal Great Doubts" says: "The personator is employed during sacrifices to the dead, in order to carry the ancestral tablet … hence there is no need of having such a one immediately after death, as the tablet is not yet erected."

The fourth opinion refutes the first three condemnations of personators as mere representatives or tablet-holders for the dead, and contends that a personator was temporarily the seat of a dead ancestor's soul. Two leading [[Neo-Confucianist]] philosophers held this judgment.
[[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] writes: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The ancients, when sacrificing to the dead, employed the personator, because the soul and the vital force of the dead person after being separated from the body, seek an agent of the same nature. Now, men being all of the same kind, the father and the children being all of one family and of the same stock, the soul of the departed person is requested to come and establish its seat in one of them as in an agent. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
His follower [[Zhu Xi]] concurs:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In ancient times all employed a personator when sacrificing to the dead. Since the descendants continue the life of their ancestors, the personator shares, therefore, in the life of the departed person, and the ancestor's soul descends undoubtedly upon his descendants, and reposes therein to enjoy the sacrifice offered. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Carr (2007:387-388) offers a contemporary explanation for ''shi'' "corpse" personation: [[Julian Jaynes]]'s psychological [[Bicameralism (psychology)|bicameralism]] hypothesis. Jaynes proposed that human "[[consciousness]]", meaning [[self-awareness]] and [[cognition]], began evolving around 1000 BCE. Prior to that, ancient people had "bicameral mentality" in which one part of the brain "spoke" (often in an [[authority figure]]'s voice) while another part listened and obeyed. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;According to the theory of the bicameral mind, hallucinations of a person in some authority could continue after death as an everyday matter. And hence the almost universal custom of feeding the corpses after death, and burying them with the appurtenances of life. (Jaynes 1976:290) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
If the original personators were bicameral, they could have directly hallucinated voices from a ''shi'' "corpse". Carr notes the historical correspondence between Jaynes's first millennium BCE timeline for the breakdown of the bicameral mind in other parts of the world and the 11th-3rd centuries BCE personation practices in China.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Several early sources give variations of the same chronicle about the personation ceremony. It began during the Xia Dynasty, when personators would communicate on behalf of the dead; continued during the Shang and Western Zhou Dynasties; but was criticized and discontinued after the Eastern Zhou Dynasty when personators were no longer able to speak for the dead. (2007:387) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:SanXingDui ZongMuMianJu.jpg|thumb|[[Sanxingdui]] bronze mask]]
Wearing [[Ritual mask#Ritual masks|ritual masks]] is a recent hypothesis about ''shi''. Paper (1995:82) suggested the possibility that Shang and Zhou ''shi'' wore bronze masks "symbolizing the spirit of the dead to whom the sacrifices were offered". Liu believes the phantasmagoric bronze masks discovered at [[Sanxingdui]], dating from c. 12th-11th centuries BCE, might have been ritually worn by ''shi'' 尸.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The ''shi'' was generally a close, young relative who wore a costume (possibly including a mask) reproducing the features of the dead person. The ''shi'' was an impersonator, that is, a person serving as a reminder of the ancestor to whom sacrifice was being offered. During such a ceremony, the impersonator was much more than an actor in a drama. Although the exact meaning may have been different, the group of Sanxingdui masked figures in bronze all have the character of an impersonator. It is likely the masks were used to impersonate and identify with certain supernatural beings in order to effect some communal good. (2000:37) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

"'''Spiritual but not religious'''" ('''SBNR''') also known as "'''Spiritual but not affiliated'''" ('''SBNA''') is a popular phrase and initialism used to self-identify a [[life stance]] of [[spirituality]] that takes issue with [[organized religion]] as the sole or most valuable means of furthering spiritual growth. Historically, the words ''religious'' and ''spiritual'' have been used synonymously to describe all the various aspects of the concept of religion,{{sfn|Mercandante|2014}} but in contemporary usage spirituality has often been associated with the interior life of the individual,&lt;ref&gt;Carette and King, Selling Spirituality, 41.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Mercandante|2014}} placing an emphasis upon the well-being of the "mind-body-spirit",&lt;ref name="Heelas2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Heelas|title=Spiritualities of Life: New Age Romanticism and Consumptive Capitalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B-J0e2L-w_oC|date=21 January 2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-0111-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|63}} while ''religion'' refers to organizational or communal dimensions.{{sfn|Mercandante|2014}}

==Origins and demography==
Historically, the words ''religious'' and ''spiritual'' have been used synonymously to describe all the various aspects of the concept of religion.{{sfn|Mercandante|2014}} However, religion is a highly contested term with scholars such as [[Russell T. McCutcheon|Russell McCutcheon]] arguing that the term "religion" is used as a way to name a "seemingly distinct domain of diverse items of human activity and production".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Will Your Cognitive Anchor Hold in the Storms of Culture?|url = http://jaar.oxfordjournals.org/content/78/4/1182|journal = Journal of the American Academy of Religion|date = 2010-12-01|issn = 0002-7189|pages = 1182–1193|volume = 78|issue = 4|doi = 10.1093/jaarel/lfq085|first = Russell T.|last = McCutcheon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field of [[Religious studies|Religious Studies]] cannot even agree on one definition for religion and since spirituality overlaps with it in many ways it is difficult to reach a consensus for a definition for spirituality as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Critical Theory and the Importance of Religious Studies|url = http://bulletin.equiof SBNRnoxpub.com/2012/12/critical-theory-and-the-importance-of-religious-studies/|website = Bulletin for the Study of Religion|accessdate = 2015-12-06|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|According to Linda Mercandante, the concept of religion is a [[social construct]], since in other eras, religion, culture, and even national identity were often inseparable. And as for spirituality, this is an old concept with a new usage.{{sfn|Mercandante|2014}} Previous to today’s era, what people today call spirituality was often called piety.{{sfn|Mercandante|2014}} Mercadante sees religion as a complex adaptive network of myths, symbols, rituals and concepts that simultaneously figure patterns of feeling, thinking, and acting and disrupt stable structures of meaning and purpose.{{sfn|Mercandante|2014}} When understood in that way, religion not only involves ideas and practices that are manifestly religious but also includes a broad range of cultural phenomena not ordinarily associated with religion.{{sfn|Mercandante|2014}} Many people use spirituality to refer to their interior life of faith and religion to mean the necessary communal and/or organizational part.{{sfn|Mercandante|2014}} Mercadante sees both spirituality and religion as consisting of four basic components: beliefs, desire, rituals, and behavioural expectations, but across the field of Religious Studies the definitions vary.{{sfn|Mercandante|2014}}}} 

Although the specific expression was used in one scholarly, anthropological paper back in 1960,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lU9SAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22spiritual+but+not+religious%22&amp;dq=%22spiritual+but+not+religious%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwio54bYsK_MAhUQ22MKHdl9C1UQ6AEILjAE|title=Publications in Anthropology, 1960.}}&lt;/ref&gt; SBNR as a movement in America was first named and delineated by author [[Sven Erlandson]] in his 2000 book "Spiritual but not Religious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Erlandson|first1 = Sven|title = Spiritual but Not Religious: A Call to Religious Revolution in America.|date = 2000|publisher = iUniverse|location = Bloomington|isbn = 059501108X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tst.edu/about/spiritual-not-religious&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://reflectorgsu.com/spiritual-but-not-religious-the-movement/&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon possibly started to emerge as a result of a new Romantic movement that began in the 1960s, whereas the relationship between the two has been remotely linked to [[William James]]' definition of religious experience, which he defines as the "feelings, acts and experiences of individual
their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kenneson|first1=Philip D.|title=What’s in a Name? A Brief Introduction to the "Spiritual But Not Religious"|journal=Liturgy|date=July 2015|volume=30|issue=3|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romantic movements tend to lean away from traditional religion and resemble spiritual movements in their endorsement of mystical, unorthodox, and exotic ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Owen|title=Spiritual but Not Religious: The Influence of the Current Romantic Movement|journal=Anglican Theological Review|date=January 2006|volume=88|issue=3|page=397}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owen Thomas also states that the ambiguity and lack of structure present in Romantic movements are also present within spiritual movements.

According to a study conducted by Pew Research Center in 2012, the number of Americans who do not identify with any religion has increased from 15% in 2007 to 20% in 2012, and this number continues to grow. One fifth of the US public and a third of adults under the age of 30 are reportedly unaffiliated with any religion but identify as being spiritual in some way. Of these religiously unaffiliated Americans, 37% classify themselves as spiritual but not religious, while 68% say they do believe in God, and 58% feel a deep connection to the Earth.&lt;ref name="Nones on the Rise"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Funk|first1=Cary|last2=Smith|first2=Greg|title="Nones" on the Rise: One-in-Five Adults Have No Religious Affiliation|url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2012/10/NonesOnTheRise-full.pdf|website=pewforum.org|publisher=The Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increased popular and scholarly attention to "spirituality" has been related by scholars like [[Kenneth Pargament|Pargament]] to sociocultural trends towards deinstitutionalization, individualization, and [[globalization]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Marler|first1 = Penny Long|last2 = Hadaway|first2 = C. Kirk|title = "Being Religious" or "Being Spiritual" in America: A Zero Sum Proposition?|journal = Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|date = June 2002|volume = 41|issue = 2|doi=10.1111/1468-5906.00117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generational replacement has been understood as a significant factor of the growth of religiously unaffiliated individuals. Significant differences were found between the percentage of those considered younger [[Millennials]] (born 1990{{ndash}}1994) as compared with [[Generation X]]ers (born 1965{{ndash}}1980), with 34% and 21% reporting to be religiously unaffiliated, respectively.&lt;ref name="Nones on the Rise"/&gt;

Demographically, research has found that the religiously unaffiliated population is younger, predominately male, and 35% are between the ages of 18 and 29. Conversely, only 8% of religiously unaffiliated individuals are 65 and older. Among those unaffiliated with organized religion as a whole, 56% are men and 44% are women.&lt;ref name="Nones on the Rise"/&gt;

Another possible explanation for the emergence of SBNR is linguistic. Owen Thomas highlights the fact that  spirituality movements tend to be localized to English and North American cultures. The meaning of the term "spirit" is more narrow in English than that of other languages, referring to all of the uniquely human capacities and cultural functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Owen|title=Spiritual but Not Religious: The Influence of the Current Romantic Movement|journal=Anglican Theological Review|date=January 2006|volume=88|issue=3|page=398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, according to Siobhan Chandler, to appreciate the "god within" is not a twentieth century notion with its roots in 1960s counter culture or 1980s New Age, but spirituality is a concept that has pervaded all of history.{{sfn|Chandler|2013}}

== Characteristics of SBNR==

===Anti-institutional and personal===
According to Abby Day, some of those who are critical of religion see it as rigid and pushy, leading them to use terms such as [[Atheism|atheist]], [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] to describe themselves.&lt;ref name="Ashgate"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last = Day|editor1-first = Abby|title = Social identities between the sacred and the secular|date = 2013|publisher = Ashgate|location = Burlington|isbn = 978-1-4094-5677-3|edition = New edition.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many people, SBNR is not just about rejecting religion outright, but not wanting to be restricted by it.&lt;ref name="Ashgate"/&gt; 

According to Linda Mercadante, SBNRs take a decidedly anti-dogmatic stance against religious belief in general. They claim not only that belief is non-essential, but that it is potentially harmful or at least a hindrance to spirituality.{{sfn|Mercandante|2014}}

According to Philip D. Kenneson, many of those studied who identify as SBNR feel a tension between their personal spirituality and membership in a conventional religious organization. Most of them value curiosity, intellectual freedom, and an experimental approach to religion. Many go as far to view organized religion as the major enemy of authentic spirituality, claiming that spirituality is private reflection and private experience—not public ritual.{{sfn|Kenneson|2015|p=5}} To be "religious" conveys an institutional connotation, usually associated with Abrahamic traditions: to attend worship services, to say Mass, to light Hanukkah candles. To be "spiritual," in contrast, connotes personal practice and personal empowerment having to do with the deepest motivations of life.{{sfn|Kenneson|2015|p=5}} As a result, in cultures that are deeply suspicious of institutional structures and that place a high value on individual freedom and autonomy, spirituality has come to have largely positive connotations, while religion has been viewed more negatively.{{sfn|Kenneson|2015|p=5}} 

According to Robert Fuller, the SBNR phenomenon can be characterized as a mix of intellectual progressivism and mystical hunger, impatient with the [[piety]] of established churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Fuller|first1 = Robert C.|title = Spiritual, but not religious: Understanding unchurched America.|date = 2001|publisher = Oxford University Press|location = New York|isbn = 0195146808|pages = 12|edition = [Nachdr.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Robert Wuthnow, spirituality is about much more than going to church and agreeing or disagreeing with church doctrines. Spirituality is the shorthand term used in Western society to talk about a person's relationship with God.{{sfn|Wuthnow|2007}} For many people, how they think about religion and spirituality is certainly guided by what they see and do in their congregations.{{sfn|Wuthnow|2007}} At a deeper level, it involves a person's self-identity—feeling loved by God, and these feelings can wax and wane.{{sfn|Wuthnow|2007}}

===Categorization of SBNRs===
Linda A. Mercadante categorizes SBNRs into five distinct categories:{{sfn|Mercadante|2014|p=35-67}} 
# "[[Dissenter]]s" are the people who, for the most part, make a conscious effort to veer away from institutional religion. "Protesting dissenters" refers to those SBNRs who have been 'turned off' religious affiliation because of adverse personal experiences with it. "Drifted Dissenters" refers to those SBNRs who, for a multitude of reasons, fell out of touch with organized religion and chose never to go back. "Conscientious objector dissenters" refers to those SBNRs who are overtly skeptical of religious institutions and are of the view that religion is neither a useful nor necessary part of an individual's spirituality. 
# "Casuals" are the people who see religious and/or spiritual practices as primarily functional. Spirituality is not an organizing principle in their lives. Rather they believe it should be used on an as-needed basis for bettering their health, relieving stress, and for emotional support. The spirituality of "Casuals" is thus best understood as a "therapeutic" spirituality that centers on the individual's personal wellbeing.
# "Explorers" are the people who seem to have what Mercandante refers to as a "spiritual wanderlust". These SBNRs find their constant search for novel spiritual practices to be a byproduct of their "unsatisfied curiosity", their desire for journey and change, as well as feelings of disappointment. Explorers are best understood as "spiritual tourists" who take comfort in the destination-less journey of their spirituality and have no intentions of ultimately committing to a spiritual home.
# "Seekers" are those people who are looking for a spiritual home but contemplate recovering earlier religious identities. These SBNRs embrace the "spiritual but not religious" label and are eager to find a completely new religious identity or alternative spiritual group that they can ultimately commit to.
# "Immigrants" are those people who have found themselves in a novel spiritual realm and are trying to adjust themselves to this newfound identity and its community. "Immigrants" can be best understood as those SBNRs who are "trying on" a radically new spiritual environment but have yet to feel completely settled there. It is important to note that for these SBNRs, although they are hoping to become fully integrated in their newfound spiritual identities, the process of acclimation is difficult and often disconcerting.

===Practices===
{{See also|Spirituality|New Age}}

SBNR is related to [[feminist]] spiritual and religious thought and ecological spiritualities,{{sfn|Fuller|2001|p=76-100}} and also to [[Neo-Pagan|Neo-Paganism]], [[Wicca]], [[Shaman]]ic, [[Druid]]ic, [[New Age Gaian|Gaia]]n and [[ceremonial magic]] practices.{{sfn|Fuller|2001|p=76-100}} Some New Age spiritual practices include [[astrology]], [[Ouija]] boards, [[Tarot]] cards, the ''[[I Ching]],'' and [[science fiction]].{{sfn|Fuller|2001|p=76-100}} A common practice of SBNRs is [[meditation]], such as [[mindfulness]] and [[Transcendental Meditation]].{{sfn|Fuller|2001|p=76-100}}

==Criticism==
Some representatives of organized religion have criticized the practice of spirituality without religiosity. Lillian Daniel, a liberal Protestant minister, has characterized the SBNR worldview as a product of secular American consumer culture, far removed from community and "right smack in the bland majority of people who find ancient religions dull but find themselves uniquely fascinating".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why Christians need the church: An interview with Lillian Daniel|url = http://jonathanmerritt.religionnews.com/2013/08/13/answering-the-spiritual-but-religious-an-interview-with-lillian-daniel/|website = On Faith &amp; Culture|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Martin (Jesuit)|James Martin]], a Jesuit priest, has called the SBNR lifestyle "plain old laziness",&lt;ref name=CNN2010-dangers&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/personal/06/03/spiritual.but.not.religious/index.html | work=[[CNN.com]] | title=Are there dangers in being 'spiritual but not religious'? | date=2010-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that "spirituality without religion can become a self-centered complacency divorced from the wisdom of a community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.bustedhalo.com/features/spiritual-but-not-religious-not-so-fast/2| title= Spiritual but not religious - Not so fast!: Making the case for moving beyond your own personal God| first= James| last= Martin| authorlink= James Martin (Jesuit)| date= 2010-03-11| work= [[Busted Halo]]: an online magazine for spiritual seekers| accessdate= 2010-09-19| quote= "Spirituality without religion can become a self-centered complacency divorced from the wisdom of a community."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics contend that within the "Spiritual but not Religious" worldview, self-knowledge and self-growth have been problematically equated with knowledge of God, directing a person's focus inward. As a result, the political, economic, and social forces that shape the world are neglected and left untended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Spiritual, but Not Religious: Understanding Unchurched America|last = Fuller|first = Robert|publisher = Oxford|year = 2001|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, some scholars have noted the relative spiritual superficiality of particular SBNR practices. Classical mysticism within the world's major religions requires sustained dedication, often in the form of prolonged asceticism, extended devotion to prayer, and the cultivation of humility. In contrast, SBNRs in the Western world are encouraged to dabble in spiritual practices in a way that is often casual and lacking in rigor or any reorganization of priorities. Sociologist Robert Wuthnow suggests that these forms of mysticism are "shallow and inauthentic".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Spiritual, but Not Religious: Understanding Unchurched America|last = Fuller|first = Robert|publisher = Oxford|year = 2001|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics take issue with the intellectual legitimacy of SBNR scholarship. When contrasted with professional or academic theology, spiritual philosophies can appear unpolished, disjointed, or inconsistently sourced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Spiritual, but Not Religious: Understanding Unchurched America|last = Fuller|first = Robert|publisher = Oxford|year = 2001|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wong and Vinsky challenge SBNR discourse that posits religion as "institutional and structured" in contrast to spirituality as "inclusive and universal" (1346).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Speaking from the Margins: A Critical Reflection on the ‘Spiritual-but-not-Religious’ Discourse in Social Work|last = Wong|first = Yuk-Lin Renita|date = 2009|journal = British Journal of Social Work|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Vinsky|first2 = Jana&lt;!--|pages = 1343–1359--&gt;|pages = 1352–1354}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that this understanding makes invisible the historical construction of "spirituality", which currently relies on a rejection of EuroChristianity for its own self-definition. According to them, Western discourses of "spirituality" appropriate indigenous spiritual traditions and "ethnic" traditions of the East, yet racialized ethnic groups are more likely to be labeled "religious" than "spiritual" by white SBNR practitioners.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Wong and Vinsky assert that through these processes, colonial [[othering]] is enacted through SBNR discourse.

The [[Association of American Medical Colleges]] (AAMC) has co-sponsored, with the National Institute for Healthcare Research, 4 conferences, on curricular development in spirituality and medicine since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Puchalski, C. M., Blatt, B., Kogan, M., &amp; Butler, A. (2014). Spirituality and health: the development of a field. Academic Medicine, 89(1), 10–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessing spirituality ==
Asking patients questions about the meaning of life, their acceptance of their own or others' failures, and how they experience connectedness with others should have the goal of assessing how satisfied the patient is with the answers to these questions.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, Mertie L., and Mary D. Moller. Psychiatric mental health nursing: from suffering to hope. Boston, Pearson, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; By developing personal relationships with their patients and their families, health professionals can better assess patients' spiritual situation.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, L. (2005). Spirituality, Suffering, Illness. Philadelphia, PA: F.A. Davis, p. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of opening questions in a spiritual assessment are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Potter, Mertie L., and Mary D. Moller. Psychiatric mental health nursing: from suffering to hope. Boston, Pearson, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''"Do you have a religious preference?"''
* ''"Are there any spiritual or religious practices that are important to you?"''
* ''"Would you like for us to contact your clergy member or religious advisor?".''

==Role of spirituality in illness==

The prospect of death may lead a patient to deal with questions related to meaning of life, such as "Why is this happening to me?" or "Is there a God?"&lt;ref&gt;Puchalski, C. M. (2001). The role of spirituality in health care. Baylor University Medical Center Proceedings. 14(4), 352–357. Retrieved from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1305900/.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-care==

Li and Shun (2016) focused on self care coping styles in patients with [[Heart failure|chronic heart failure]] found that spiritual and religious support affects heart failure patients coping with both physical and psychological self-care.&lt;ref&gt;Li, C. C., &amp; Shun, S. C. (2016). Understanding self care coping styles in patients with chronic heart failure: A systematic review. European Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing, 15(1), 12–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications in health care==
{{expand section|date=December 2017}}
&lt;!-- So, how is spirituality actually being used in health care professions? --&gt;

===Third-party professional aid===
Ill individuals and their families may request referrals for services such as a [[chaplain]], psychologist, or [[social work]]er who can address their spiritual concerns. Providers who are uncomfortable accommodating an integrative approach to care should consult with other practitioners skilled in providing spiritual care, so that patients can integrate spiritual support into their own self-care.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton-Jones, D., &amp; Haglund, K. (2016). The role of spirituality and religiosity in persons living with sickle cell disease: a review of the literature. Journal of Holistic Nursing, 34(4), 351-360.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The concept of "spirituality" in health care has been criticised. Salander and Hamberg question the usefulness of Puchalsky's definition:
{{quote|A prerequisite for a meaningful concept is that it is demarcated in relation to other concepts. Puchalski and colleagues' conceptualization of spirituality lacks this demarcation – it unfortunately qualifies as an example of what Sartori called "conceptual stretching." It becomes a popular catch-all term – it means everything and, therefore, nothing.{{sfn|Salander|Hamberg|2014}}}}

A '''suangi''' is a common name  of a male who is suspected, and therefore accused, of being a  [[witch]] in the [[belief system]] of West Papuans. Suangis are said to eat the blood and/or internal organs of their victims and then stuff the bodies with leaves and grass. They are also believed to devour the person's soul. After being attacked, the [[zombified]] victim is then said to return home where they seem to have fallen mysteriously ill. If a victim is able to name the suangi that has attacked him, they are often killed and eaten by the victim's family in the belief that it will free the person's spirit.

The [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[New Testament]] contain many passages outlining approaches to, and descriptions of, [[Violence|violent]] activities, centering on the [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|ancient nation of Israel]] and their involvement with [[Gentile]] nations. They also provide civil guidelines on the subject of violent activity as it pertains to individuals within the nation, distinguishing individualistic from [[Nationalism|nationalistic]] actions.

These texts contain [[narrative]]s, [[poetry]], and instruction describing, commanding, or condemning violent actions by God, individuals, groups, and governments.

Within the [[Pentateuch]] the terms ''gazal'' (rob) and ''asaq'' (oppress) are frequently used in combination to describe the human violence of taking/robbing/plundering as [[oppression]] of the poor which may or may not include physical, verbal or other types of harm.  They are also used both separately and in combination throughout the remainder of the Hebrew Bible describing robbing the poor (Isaiah 3:14, 10:2; Jeremiah 22:3; Micah 2:2, 3:2; Malachi 1:3), withholding the wages of a hired person (cf. Deuteronomy 24:14), political oppression (Hosea 12:7), charging oppressive interest (Ezekiel 22:12), and oppressing the outsider in their midst (Ezekiel 22:7) as acts of violence.&lt;ref name="David J.A.

Levine says Exodus 33:5-16 is an example of early Hebrew ideology while noting Deut.7:1-11 contains much the same ideology with the addition of the ban (see also Exodus 20:19,20).

Over half the occurrences of the verb and noun for the root ''ḥ-r-m'' are concerned with the destruction of nations in war, but other terms associated with what Old Testament scholar Eric Siebert describes as "divine violence" may or may not include war. Siebert says divine violence is "violence God is said to have perpetrated, caused, or sanctioned." Specifically, this includes (1) violence God commits without using human agents (e.g., sending down fire on Sodom and Gomorrah); (2) violence God commissions, typically unbeknownst to those being commissioned (e.g., using Babylon to punish Judah for their sins); and (3) violence God commands directly (e.g., ordering [[Israelites]] to wipe out [[Canaanites]])."&lt;ref name="Eric Siebert"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seibert|first1=Eric A.|title=Recent Research on Divine Violence in the Old Testament (with Special Attention to Christian Theological Perspectives)|journal=Currents in Biblical Research|date=21 October 2016|volume=15|issue=1|pages=8–40|doi=10.1177/1476993X15600588}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, concerning those who worship idols, Deuteronomy 7:16 uses ''akal'' ("consume") when saying "You must ''destroy'' (consume) all the peoples the Lord your God gives over to you…".  Deuteronomy 7:24, on the other hand, uses ''abad'' when saying "you shall make their name ''perish'' from under heaven…" while Deuteronomy 20:10-18 says  "…you shall not leave alive anything that breathes.  But you shall utterly destroy (''ha-harem taharimem'') them, the Hittite and the Amorite, the Canaanite and the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite, as the Lord your God has commanded you…".  "Amos 1:3–2:3 uses akal to indict Israel’s neighbors for various acts of cruelty during war (e.g., the Ammonites “ripped open pregnant women in Gilead in order to enlarge their territory”; 1:13) and uses those [[war crime]]s of surrounding peoples to draw a parallel with Israel’s mistreatment of the poor, thus elevating economic injustice to the level of war crimes." (2:6–8).&lt;ref name=CreachResources/&gt;{{rp|44}}

Other terms are: ''ṣamat'' (put an end to, exterminate...annihilate); ''shamad'' (destroy, exterminate); ''nakah'' (to strike fatally, kill, in manslaughter, murder...as retaliation ...in warfare, conquest...combat...attack, rout); ''aqar'' (pluck up, often in the violent sense); ''qatsah'' (to cut off, in a destructive sense); ''shabat'' (with zeker can refer to one's "memory" being "blotted out" but in another idiom it means to "be blotted out...from...[the] earth" to "be exterminated, be destroyed, perish"; and ''kalah'' (kalah in Qal can mean "be finished, be destroyed).&lt;ref name="David J.A.

In Genesis 18-19 God resolves to destroy the cities [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], "because their sin is very grievous". God promises [[Abraham]] that he will spare Sodom if as few as 10 righteous people can be found there.

[[Moses]], a Hebrew [[Finding of Moses|raised by]] [[Bithiah|Pharaoh's daughter]], one day encounters an Egyptian beating a Hebrew. He slays the Egyptian and flees Egypt. God hears the plight of the Israelites and sends Moses back to Egypt to bring them out of that land to [[Canaan]].

Moses asks Pharaoh to release the Israelites, but Pharaoh responds by [[Bricks without straw|demanding more work]] from them. Moses repeats his request several times as the [[Plagues of Egypt]] afflict the Egyptians, but God makes Pharaoh refuse until the tenth plague, when God kills all firstborn people and cattle in Egypt, apart from those of the Israelites, who are [[Plagues_of_Egypt#10._Death_of_firstborn_.28.D7.9E.D6.B7.D7.9B.D6.B7.D6.BC.D7.AA_.D7.91.D6.B0.D6.BC.D7.9B.D7.95.D6.B9.D7.A8.D7.95.D6.B9.D7.AA.29:_Ex._11:1.E2.80.9312:36|protected]].

At [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]], God gives the Israelites the [[Ten Commandments]] and the [[Covenant Code]] (Exodus 20-23). These laws include [[thou shalt not kill]], [[eye for an eye]] and laws about [[The Bible and slavery|slavery]] and other things. [[List of capital crimes in the Torah|Capital punishment]] is prescribed for some crimes. [[Animal sacrifice]] in the form of [[Burnt offering (Judaism)|burnt offering]]s is mentioned, and it is prescribed that an ox that kills a person is to be stoned. The Code states that "And a stranger shalt thou not wrong, neither shalt thou oppress him; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt." and "Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child."

The armour-bearer also takes his own life. Saul's body is beheaded and fastened to a city-wall by the victorious Philistines, but it is retaken by inhabitants of [[Jabesh-Gilead]] (1 Samuel 30).

A man tells David of Saul's death and that he himself killed Saul. David has him killed (2 Samuel 1). A long war starts between David and Saul's son [[Ish-bosheth]] (2 Samuel 3). David demands and is granted the return of his first wife Michal, despite the public grief of her new husband [[Palti, son of Laish|Palti]]. Two men assassinate Ish-bosheth, and David has them killed (2 Samuel 4). David wars victoriously with the Philistines. While transporting the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem, a man called [[Uzzah]] carelessly touches it and is killed by God (2 Samuel 6).

David defeats and plunder several enemies, and "executed justice and righteousness unto all his people." (2 Samuel 8). [[Ammon#Biblical narrative|The children of Ammon]] mistreat David's emissaries, and is defeated by his army (2 Samuel 10).

In order to make [[Bathsheba]] his wife, David successfully plots the death of [[Uriah the Hittite|her husband]]. This displeases God, and David is told that "the sword shall never depart from thy house." God kills David's and Bathsheba's child, that was conceived during her previous marriage. She then gives birth to [[Solomon]].  David conquers and plunders the city [[Rabbah]] (2 Samuel 11-12).

David's son [[Amnon]] rapes his half-sister [[Tamar (daughter of David)|Tamar]]. [[Absalom]], her full brother, in return has him killed (2 Samuel 13). Absalom conspires and revolts against David. Absalom is finally defeated and dies in the [[Battle of the Wood of Ephraim]], and David mourns him (2 Samuel 15-19). [[Sheba son of Bichri]] revolts, but is ultimately beheaded (2 Samuel 20).

In 2 Samuel 21, David has seven of Sauls sons and grandsons killed, including "the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul", though he spares Sauls grandson [[Mephibosheth]]. More wars take place. 2 Samuel 23 names and praises several of [[David's Mighty Warriors|David's warriors]].

===Apocalypse===
{{Main|Apocalypticism}}

The [[Book of Revelation]] is full of imagery of war, genocide, and destruction. It describes the [[Apocalypse]], the [[Last Judgment#Christianity|last judgment]] of all the nations and people by God, which includes plagues, war, and economic collapse. Some other books of the Gospels also use apocalyptic language and forms.  Scholars define this as language that "views the future as a time when divine saving and judging activity will deliver God's people out of the present evil order into a new order...This transformation will be cataclysmic and cosmic."&lt;ref name="James Bailey"/&gt;

Whenever Jesus calls people to a new vision in light of God's impending kingdom, judgment, or a future resurrection, he is using apocalyptic speech.&lt;ref name="James Bailey"&gt;{{cite book|author1-last=Bailey| author1-first=James L.|author2-last="Vander Broek"| author2-first=Lyle D.| title=Literary Forms in the New Testament: A Handbook| year =1992|publisher=Westminster/John Knox Press| location=Louiseville, Kentucky|isbn=0-664-25154-4|page=122,123}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Jesus uses apocalyptic speech in Matthew 10:15 when he says "it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town,"  and in Mark 14:62, where he alludes to the book of Daniel with himself in the future "sitting at the right hand of God." Bailey and Vander Broek go on to say, "In the material about John the Baptizer there also appear apocalyptic images: 'the wrath to come' (Luke 3:7); 'the axe ... lying at the root of the tree' (Luke 3:9);  the Coming One with 'winnowing fork ... in His hand' (Luke 3:17); and chaff burning with 'unquenchable fire' (Luke 3:17)."&lt;ref name="James Bailey"/&gt;{{rp|124}}

Charles B. Strozier, psychoanalyst historian says: "The most troubling dimension of 'endism' is its relation to violence. ... fundamentalists generally believe... transformation can only be accomplished violently, and that the move from our time into the next requires mass death and destruction when '...this earth will be purged in the fires of God's anger, that Jesus will return, and that a new heaven and a new earth will be reborn'".&lt;ref name="Charles B.

==Theological reflections and responses==
Texts of violence have produced a wide variety of theological responses.

===Various views===
As part of the many reflections on [[religious violence]] inspired by the [[Abrahamic religions]] that followed [[9/11]], [[John J. Collins]] wrote a short book called "Does the Bible Justify Violence?".&lt;ref name=McCormick&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCormick|first1=Patrick|title=Turn the other page|work=U.S. Catholic;|issue=70(11)|date=Nov 2005|pages=34ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=John J.|title=Does the Bible Justify Violence?|date=2004|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=9781451411287}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1–3}}  In the book he reviews the passages in the Bible describing violence done by God, commanded or promised by God, and done by people, as well as how these texts have been used by religious people and governments throughout history.&lt;ref name=McCormick/&gt;  For example, he discusses [[The Exodus]] and the conquest of the Canaanites in the subsequent [[Book of Joshua]], as two sides of the same coin; the Exodus story has inspired hope for millennia as well as civil rights movements; at the same time people identifying with the liberated Israel supported by God have cited the conquest to justify actions ranging from [[genocide of indigenous peoples]] to [[Apartheid]].&lt;ref name=Collins/&gt;{{rp|19–20}}  Collins concludes that the Bible speaks in many voices and answers his question as follows: "....historically people have appealed to the Bible precisely because of its presumed divine authority, which gives an aura of certitude to any position it can be shown to support -- in the phrase of Hannah Arendt, 'God-like certainty that stops all discussion.'  And here, I would suggest, is the most basic connection between the Bible and violence, more basic than any command or teaching it contains....The Bible has contributed to violence in the world precisely because it has been taken to confer a degree of certitude that transcends human discussion and argumentation."&lt;ref name=Collins/&gt;{{rp|32–33}}  Collins, writing as a Christian scholar, also notes:  "It is not unusual for Christian interpreters to claim that 'the Biblical witness to the innocent victims and the God of victims demystifies and demythologizes this sacred social order' in which violence is grounded.  Such a selective reading, privileging the death of Jesus or the suffering servant, is certainly possible and even commendable, but it does not negate the force of the biblical endorsements of violence that we have been considering. The full canonical shape of the Christian Bible, for what it is worth, still concludes with the judgement scene in Revelation, in which the Lamb that was slain returns as the heavenly warrior with a sword for striking down the nations."&lt;ref name=Collins/&gt;{{rp|27}}

[[Regina Schwartz]] is among those who seek to reimagine Christianity and the Christian biblical canon in ways that reduce violence which she describes as arising from the ancient Israelite invention of monotheism and some of the ways that the ancient Israelites conceived of themselves in relation to that one god and to other peoples, which Christians inherited. She wrote:  "The Other against whom Israel's identity is forged is abhorred, abject, impure, and in the "Old Testament," vast numbers of them are obliterated, while in the "New Testament," vast numbers are colonized (converted).  The tying of identity to rejection runs counter to much of the drive that could be found elsewhere, both in the Bible and throughout religious myth and ritual, to forge identity through analogy, even identification....Among all the rich variety, I would categorize two broad understandings of identity in the Bible: one grounded in Negation (or scarcity) and the other in Multiplicity (or plenitude).&lt;ref name="Regina Schwartz"&gt;{{cite book | last =Schwartz | first =Regina | title = The Curse of Cain: The Violent Legacy of Monotheism | publisher = the University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago, Ill | year = 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18–19}} Near the end of her book, she wrote:  "My re-vision would produce an alternative Bible that subverts the dominant vision of violence and scarcity with an ideal of plenitude and its corollary ethical imperative of generosity. It would be a Bible embracing multiplicity instead of monotheism."&lt;ref name="Regina Schwartz"/&gt;{{rp|176}}

Stephen Geller notes that both the Deuteronomist and the Priestly authors working in the [[Axial Age]] were re-evaluating and reformulating their traditions, like their neighbors were, using the literary means available to them. The Deuteronomists expressed their new notions of the transcendence and power of God by means of ideas and associated laws around unity—the one-ness of God, worshipped at the one temple in Jerusalem, by one people, kept distinct from the rest of world just as God is; zealously and violently so.&lt;ref name=geller&gt;{{cite book|last1=Geller|first1=Stephen A.|title=Sacred enigmas : literary religion in the Hebrew Bible|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=0415127718|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32-22}}  Likewise the Priestly author adapted the myths and rituals of the ANE and the specific traditions of the ancient Israelites to forge different meanings for blood sacrifice than their neighbors had, specifically in the elaborate and precarious rituals on the [[Day of Atonement]] when the High Priest had to enter the Holy of Holies and the presence of God; in their work the Priestly authors also attempted to express the transcendence and unity of God who is yet in a relationship with humanity with all its variable sinfulness.  In Geller's reading the blood is not magical nor is the animal just a substitute for a human sacrifice; instead blood is at once an expression of the violence of the fallen world where people kill in order to eat (unlike Eden) and the blood itself becomes a means for redemption; it is forbidden to be eaten, as a sign of restraint and recognition, and is instead offered to God, and in that action the relationship between fallen humanity and God is restored. The Priestly authors underline the importance of all this by recalling the mortal danger faced by the High Priests, through the telling of the deaths of [[Nadab and Abihu]] when God refused their "strange offering" and consumed them with fire.&lt;ref name=geller/&gt;{{rp|32-22}} One result of this reformulating work, is a God with aspects of terrifying and powerful otherness; as Annie Dillard wrote in [[Pilgrim at Tinker Creek]]: "Does anyone have the foggiest idea what sort of power we so blithely invoke? Or, as I suspect, does no one believe a word of it? The churches are children playing on the floor with their chemistry sets, mixing up a batch of TNT to kill a Sunday morning. It is madness to wear ladies’ straw hats and velvet hats to church; we should all be wearing crash helmets. Ushers should issue life preservers and signal flares; they should lash us to our pews. For the sleeping god may wake someday and take offense, or the waking god may draw us out to where we can never return."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dillard|first1=Annie|title=Pilgrim at Tinker Creek|date=1999|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|isbn=9780072434170|edition=1st Perennial classics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evan Fales, Professor of Philosophy, calls the doctrine of [[substitutionary atonement]] that some Christians use to understand the crucifixion of Jesus, "psychologically pernicious" and "morally indefensible".  Fales founds his argument on [[John Locke]]’s statement that revelation must conform to our understanding. Philosopher and Professor [[Alvin Plantinga]] says this rests upon seeing God as a kind of specially talented human being.&lt;ref name="Evan Fales"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fales | first = Evan |editor1-last =Bergman |editor1-first = Michael | editor2-last= Murray | editor2-first= Michael J. | editor3-last=Rea | editor3-first=Michael C. | title = Divine evil?

Historian [[Philip Jenkins]] (quoting Phyllis Trible) says the Bible is filled with "texts of terror" but he also asserts these texts are not to be taken literally. Jenkins says eighth century BCE historians added them to embellish their ancestral history and get readers' attention.&lt;ref name="Philip Jenkins"&gt;{{cite book| last = Jenkins | first = Philip | title = Laying Down the Sword; Why We Can't Ignore The Bible's Violent Verses | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 2011 | page =8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Old Testament scholar [[Ellen F. Davis|Ellen Davis]] is concerned by what she calls a "shallow reading" of Scripture, particularly of 'Old Testament' texts concerning violence, which she defines as a "reading of what we think we already know instead of an attempt to dig deeper for new insights and revelations."  She says these difficult texts typically have internal correctives that support an educative reading.&lt;ref name="Ellen Davis"&gt;{{cite book | last = Davis | first =  Ellen F. | title = Wondrous Depth: Preaching the Old Testament| publisher = Westminster John Knox Press | location = Louisville, Kentucky | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CreachOxford/&gt;{{rp|8–9}}

===The problem of evil===
Discussions of bible and violence often lead to discussions of the [[theodicy]] - the question of how evil can persist in the world if God is all-powerful, all-knowing, and good.&lt;ref name=LevonsonCreation/&gt;{{rp|xv-xvi}}

Philosopher [[Eleonore Stump]] says the larger context of God permitting suffering for good purposes in a world where evil is real allows for such events as the killing of those intending evil and God to still be seen as good.&lt;ref name="Eleonore Stump"&gt;{{cite book | last = Stump| first = Eleonore |editor1-last =Bergman |editor1-first = Michael | editor2-last= Murray | editor2-first= Michael J. | editor3-last=Rea | editor3-first=Michael C. | title = Divine evil?

Jon Levenson resolves the problem of evil by describing God's power not as static, but as unfolding in time: "the operative dichotomy, thus, is not that between limitation and omnipotence, but that which lies between omnipotence as a static attribute and omnipotence as a dramatic enactment: the absolute power of God realizing itself achievement and relationship. What the biblical theology of dramatic omnipotence shares with the theology of a limited God is a frank recognition of God's setbacks, in contrast to the classic theodicies with their exaggerated commitment to divine impassibility and their tendency to describe imperfection solely to human free will, the recalcitrance of matter, or the like."&lt;ref name=LevonsonCreation/&gt;{{rp|xvi}}

===Genesis and violence at creation===
[[File:Babylonian religion and mythology (1899) (14595850218).jpg|thumb|The god [[Marduk]] (right) fighting [[Tiamat]]]]
In 1895 [[Hermann Gunkel]] observed that most Ancient Near Eastern (ANE) creation stories contain a [[theogony]] depicting a god doing combat with other gods thus including violence in the founding of their cultures.&lt;ref name="Herman Gunkel 2006"&gt;{{cite book | author1-last= Gunkel | author1-first=Hermann | author2-last=Zimmern | author2-first= Heinrich |translator-last=Whitney Jr. | translator-first= K. William |title = Creation And Chaos in the Primeval Era And the Eschaton: A Religio-historical Study of Genesis 1 and Revelation 12 |publisher = Eerdman's |location=Grand Rapids | year =2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the Babylonian creation epic [[Enuma Elish]], the first step of creation has [[Marduk]] fighting and killing [[Tiamat]], a chaos monster, to establish order.&lt;ref name=CreachOxford/&gt;{{rp|4–5,16,18}} Kenneth A. Mathews says, "It has been typical of scholarship since Gunkel's ''Schöfung und Chaos'' (1895) to interpret Genesis 1's subjugation of 'the deep' and division of the 'waters' as a remnant of the battle motif between Marduk and watery Tiamat, which was taken up by the Hebrew author and demythologized, [but] most contemporary scholars now see the association of the Hebrew '''tehôm''' ('deep,' 1:2) with Tiamat as superficial."&lt;ref name="Kenneth A. Mathews"&gt;{{cite book| last=Mathews| first ="Kenneth A." | title =The New American Commentary: Genesis 1-11:26 | volume=1A | year=1996 |publisher = Broadman and Holman Publishers | location = Nashville, Tennessee |isbn = 978-0-8054-0101-1 | pages=92–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "The fact [the Genesis creation account] was likely part of the last stages of the creation of the Pentateuch may indicate that the portrait of God in Gen. 1:1–2:4a was normative for those who gave the Old Testament canon its present shape. Hence, it seems that the account of God creating without violence in Gen. 1:1–2:4a “now serves as the overture to the entire Bible, dramatically relativizing the other cosmologies."&lt;ref name=CreachOxford/&gt;{{rp|4}} 

Canaanite creation stories like the ''Enuma Elish'' use very physical terms such as "tore open," "slit," "threw down," "smashed," and "severed" whereas in the Hebrew Bible, Leviathan is not so much defeated as domesticated.&lt;ref name="Christopher B. Hays"/&gt;{{rp|69,70}}  Theologian Christopher Hays says Hebrew stories use a term for dividing (bâdal; separate, make distinct) that is an abstract concept more reminiscent of a Mesopotamian tradition using non-violence at creation. Most modern scholars agree that "Gen. 1:1–2:4a narrates a story of God creating without violence or combat. In [the Genesis] account, the elements do not represent rival deities, and the story declares the creation “good” (Gen. 1:10, 12, 18, 21, 25, 31). What is more, in Gen. 1:1–2:4a the elements participate in the process of ordering at God’s invitation (Gen. 1:9, 11, 20).”&lt;ref name=CreachOxford/&gt;{{rp|4}}&lt;ref name="Christopher B. Hays"/&gt;{{rp|69-72}}  Old Testament scholar [[Walter Brueggemann]] says "God's characteristic action is to "speak"... God "calls the world into being"... "The way of God with his world is the way of language."&lt;ref name="Walter Brueggemann"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brueggemann|first1=Walter|title=Genesis: Interpretation: A Bible Commentary for Teaching and Preaching|date=2010|publisher=Westminster Jon Know Press|location=Louisville, Kentucky|isbn=978-0-664-23437-9|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, he also says the differences are more pronounced than the similarities.&lt;ref name="Christopher B.

Hays"/&gt;{{rp|69-72}}

The intent of Genesis 1:1-2n concerning "creation from nothing" is disputed. [[Jon Levenson]], writing Jewish [[biblical theology]], asserts the creation stories in Genesis are not ''[[ex nihilo]]'', but rather a generation of order out of chaos, similar to other ANE creation myths; the order allows life to flourish and holds back chaos which brings violence and destruction, which has never been obliterated and is always breaking back in.  He finds that the writers of the Hebrew Bible referred to God's actions at creation as a statement of faith in a God who could protect and maintain them, or who could also step back and allow chaos to rush back in, as God did with the Flood.  He finds that the writers of the Hebrew Bible also held up God's actions at creation as a challenge for God to act, and a challenge for themselves to work in covenant with God in the ongoing work of generating and maintaining order.&lt;ref name=LevonsonCreation&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levenson|first1=Jon D.|title=Creation and the persistence of evil : the Jewish drama of divine omnipotence|date=1994|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J.|isbn=9780691029504|edition=Paperback with revisions of the original edition, first published in 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Preface (1994)}}  In this, the Bible story is dissimilar to the both the Memphite story and the Babylonian in that the Hebrew Bible says the divine gift of working with God in creation is limited to humankind, meaning, for the Hebrews, humans alone are part of God's being.

===The Book of Judges and violence against women===

[[File:Cathedral Basilica of Saint Clement, Tenancingo, Mexico State, Mexico04.jpg|thumb|Deborah the Judge, Tenancingo, Mexico State, Mexico]]

Violence against women appears throughout the Old Testament. Many have attributed this to a [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] society, while some scholars say the problem stems from the larger context of a male dominated culture. Women are treated in differing ways in the Bible. For example, the Book of Judges includes the judge [[Deborah]], who was honored, as well as two of the most egregious examples in the Bible of violence against women: [[Jephthah]]’s daughter (Judg. 11:29–40) and the Levite’s concubine (Judg. 19).&lt;ref name=CreachOxford/&gt;{{rp|12}}&lt;ref name="Carol Meyers"&gt;{{cite book | last =Meyers | first = Carol | title =Discovering Eve: Ancient Israelite Women in Context | publisher =Oxford University Press | location = New York |year= 1988 | page = 43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar author [[Phyllis Trible]] looks at these instances from the perspective of the victim making their [[pathos]] palpable, underlying their human reality, and the tragedy of their stories.&lt;ref name="Phyllis Trible"&gt;{{cite book| last=Trible | first=Phyllis| title=Texts of Terror:Literary-Feminist readings of Biblical Narratives | publisher=Fortress Press | year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some feminist critiques of Judges say the Bible gives tacit approval to violence against women by not speaking out against these acts.&lt;ref name=CreachOxford/&gt;{{rp|14}}

O'Connor says women in the Old Testament generally serve as points of reference for the larger story, yet Judges abounds with stories where women play the main role.  O'Connor explains the significance of this, saying: "The period between the death of Joshua and the anointing of Saul...was a period of uncertainty and danger... lack of human leadership is viewed as disastrous, for when "every one does what is right in their own eyes, the results are awful" and that is illustrated by the violent acts against women recorded in Judges.&lt;ref name="OConnor1986"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/1811/58724/HAR_v10_277.pdf?sequence=1|title=The Women in the Book of Judges|last=O'Connor|first=M.|year=1986|journal=Hebrew Annual Review|volume=10|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|url=http://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1008&amp;context=fac_dis|year=1992|last=Hartman|first=Harvey D.|title=The Feminine Gender as a Literary Device in the Narrative of Judges}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|277,278}}

Beginning with the larger context and tracing the decline of Israel by following the deteriorating status of women and the violence done to them, which progresses from the promise of life in the land to chaos and violence, the effects of the absence of authority such as a king (Judges 21:25) is reflected in the violence against women that occurs when government fails and social upheaval occurs.&lt;ref name=CreachOxford/&gt;{{rp|14}}&lt;ref name="Mariam M.

===The violence of Hell===
{{main|Problem of Hell}}
The ancient Israelites did not worship the dead, sacrifice to them, or hope to reunite with them in an afterlife; a concept of hell as a place of punishment in the afterlife arose in [[Second Temple Judaism]] and was further developed in the Christian tradition; Judaism subsequently moved away from this notion.&lt;ref name="Alice K. Turner"&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Alice K.|title=The History of Hell|year=1993|publisher=Harcourt Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-15-600137-3| page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are Hebrew Bible verses indicating early Jewish thought did contain some belief in an afterlife. For example Isaiah 26:14 which is part of Proto-Isaiah (chapters 1–39), containing the words of Isaiah who lived in the Kingdom of Judah during the reigns of four kings from the mid to late 8th century BCE speaks of "the dead who live no more" as being "punished and destroyed". And Daniel 12:2,3 which is generally believed to date to the second century BCE asserts, "Many of those who sleep in the dust of the ground will awake, these to everlasting life, but the others to disgrace and everlasting contempt." More evidence comes from Maccabees, written in the second century BCE, and by the first century CE, friction between the Sadducees and the Pharisees over this issue is documented by both the New Testament writers and Josephus giving evidence of its presence in Jewish thought.&lt;ref name="Alice K. Turner"/&gt;{{rp|43}}

The word Sheol appears 65 times in the Hebrew Bible and the term "Tartaros" appears frequently in Jewish apocalyptic literature where it refers to a place where the wicked are punished.&lt;ref name = "John F. Walvoord"/&gt;{{rp|22}}&lt;ref name="William Crockett"/&gt;{{rp|14}}&lt;ref name="Alice K. Turner"/&gt;  In the New Testament there are three words translated ''Hell'': the Greek word ''hades,'' which is a general equivalent of the Hebrew ''Sheol,'' is used to identify the temporary place of the unsaved after death but is not used in relationship to the lake of fire or eternal punishment;  ''gehenna'' is uniformly translated Hell and refers to eternal punishment; and one occurrence of ''tartaros'' appears in 2 Peter 2:4 and is considered equivalent to ''gehenna''.  All the references to ''gehenna'' (except James 3:6) are spoken by Jesus himself.  A literal interpretation involves violence.&lt;ref name="John F.

Walvoord"/&gt;{{rp|21}}

According to a statement by the publisher of "Four Views on Hell", [[Zondervan]], "probably the most disturbing concept in Christian tradition is the prospect that one day vast numbers of people will be consigned to Hell."&lt;ref name = "William Crockett"&gt;{{cite book| editor1-last=Crockett| editor1-first=William| editor2-last=Gundry| editor2-first= Stanley N.| title=Four views on Hell| year=1996| publisher = Zondervan| location =Grand Rapids, Michigan| isbn=0-310-21268-5| page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

C.S.Lewis argued that people choose Hell rather than repent and submit to God. Miroslav Wolf argues that the doctrine of final judgment provides a necessary restraint on human violence. Tim Keller says it is right to be angry when someone brings injustice or violence to those we love and therefore a loving God can be filled with wrath because of love, not in spite of it. Oliver O'Donovan argues that without the judgment of God we would never see the love in redemption.&lt;ref name="Stanley N.

===Marcionism and supersessionism===

As the [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|early Christian Church began to distinguish itself from Judaism]], the "Old Testament" and a portrayal of God in it as violent and unforgiving were sometimes contrasted rhetorically with certain teachings of Jesus to portray an [[image of God]] as more loving and forgiving, which was framed as a new image.&lt;ref name=Meyer/&gt;

[[Marcion of Sinope]], in the early second century, developed an [[Marcionism|early Christian dualist belief system]] that understood the [[Yahweh|god of the Old Testament]] and [[Creator deity|creator]] of the material universe, who he called the [[Demiurge]], as an altogether different being than the God about whom Jesus spoke. Marcion considered Jesus' universal [[God]] of compassion and love, who looks upon humanity with benevolence and mercy, incompatible with Old Testament depictions of divinely ordained violence. Accordingly, he did not regard the Hebrew scriptures as part of [[Development of the New Testament canon#Marcion of Sinope|his scriptural canon]].&lt;ref&gt;Metzger, Bruce. ''Canon of the NT'' {{ISBN|978-0-19-826180-3}}; The [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] of 1913 characterized Marcion as "perhaps the most dangerous foe Christianity has ever known."; [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/origin_nt.v.vi.html Harnack's Origin of the New Testament]: "Marcion, on the contrary, treats the Catholic Church as one that “follows the Testament of the Creator-God,” and directs the full force of his attack against this Testament and against the falsification of the Gospel and of the Pauline Epistles by the original Apostles and the writers of the Gospels. He would necessarily have dealt with the two Testaments of the Catholic Church if the Church had already possessed a New Testament. His polemic would necessarily have been much less simple if he had been opposed to a Church which, by possessing a New Testament side by side with the Old Testament, had ipso facto placed the latter under the shelter of the former. In fact Marcion’s position towards the Catholic Church is intelligible, in the full force of its simplicity, only under the supposition that the Church had not yet in her hand any “litera scripta Novi Testamenti.”"&lt;/ref&gt; Marcion's teaching was repudiated by [[Tertullian]] in five treatises titled "[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ante-Nicene_Fathers/Volume_III/Anti-Marcion/The_Five_Books_Against_Marcion Against Marcion]" and Marcion was ultimately excommunicated by the [[Christian Church|Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Jeremiah |first=Jorge V. |last=Pixley |author-link=George V.

The issue of religious violence in canonical gospel, epistle, Apocalypse, and Acts alike has been underscrutinized in general, and—rather more inexplicably—neglected even in studies devoted specifically to violence "in the Bible." For example, a recent edition of Religious Studies News, an Internet journal of the Society of Biblical Literature, advertises itself as a feature on violence in the Bible, yet articles focus with virtual singularity on Hebrew Bible texts and Hebrew Bible atrocities.... But by raising questions only about Hebrew texts, this issue performs a sort of violence of its own—the "real" problem lies in the "Jewish" texts, not in the Christian Testament....More troubling than studies of violence in the Bible that ignore the New Testament are those that lift up the New Testament as somehow containing the antidote for Old Testament violence. This is ultimately the case, for instance, in the work of Girard, who embedded his views on mimetic violence and scapegoating in a general theory of religion and culture that he crowned with a triumphalist reading of Christian Scripture.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levine|first1=Amy-Jill|authorlink=Amy-Jill Levine|title=The Misunderstood Jew: The Church and the Scandal of the Jewish Jesus|date=2009|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=9780061748110|page=220|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0a0HchZsD_cC&amp;pg=PA220|language=en|quote=Watch out tor the heresy known as Marcionism, named for Marcion, a mid-second century Christian who distinguished between the God or the Old Testament (and Judaism) and the God of the New (and so Christianity).

That is the center of Christian faith. All the rest turns on this. A curious consequence of this confession is that simply because Christians are Christians they inevitably adopt some specific posture toward the Jewish people, a posture that is always theological and practical at once....The question, then, has never been whether Christians should speak and act with reference to the Jewish people. Rather, the question has been how they should do so, and how what they would say and do would affect the existence of the Jewish people. For most of the past two millennia, the church's posture toward the Jewish people has come to expression in the teaching known as supersessionism, also known as the theology of displacement.... In the early nineteenth century, some progressive Christian theologians carried the idea of supersessionism to a new level. According to them, the God of Jesus Christ was not revealed by the Hebrew Bible at all, and therefore had never entered into a special relationship with the Jewish people in the first place.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociological reflections and responses==

Jože Krašovec described the [[ancient near east]]ern (ANE) context in which the stories and text of the Hebrew Bible originated, in which gods were identified with peoples, and the flourishing or destruction of a people were a reflection of the power of its god or gods; while the ancient Israelites conceived of its deity as one person in contrast to the polytheistic conception of its neighbors, it remained like other ANE peoples in considering itself as a whole in relationship with its god.  From this foundation arose notions of flourishing of the nation as a whole, as well as [[collective punishment]] of the ancient Israelites and their enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krašovec|first1=Jože|title=Reward, punishment, and forgiveness : the thinking and beliefs of ancient Israel in the light of Greek and modern views|date=1999|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden [u.a.]|isbn=9004114432|oclc=42475527|chapter=Chapter XII: Holy War as Punishment and protection }} He cites the following examples of collective punishment (of descendants) in the Bible:
::Ex 20:5 - "You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, 6 but showing love to a thousand {generations} of those who love me and keep my commandments."
::Deut 5:9-10
::Exodus 34:6-7:  "And he passed in front of Moses, proclaiming, "The LORD, the LORD, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness, 7 maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children and their children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation."
::Deuteronomy 7:9-10 - "Know therefore that the LORD your God is God; he is the faithful God, keeping his covenant of love to a thousand generations of those who love him and keep his commands. 10 But those who hate him he will repay to their face by destruction;       he will not be slow to repay to their face those who hate him."
::Jeremiah 32:18  - " You show love to thousands but bring the punishment for the fathers' sins into the laps of their children after them. O great and powerful God, whose name is the LORD Almighty"
&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar [[Nur Masalha]] writes that the "genocide" of the extermination commandments has been "kept before subsequent generations" and served as inspirational examples of divine support for slaughtering enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Masalha, Nur, ''The Bible and Zionism: invented traditions, archaeology and post-colonialism in Palestine-Israel, Volume 1'', Zed Books, 2007, pp 273-276:
:"[[Michael Prior (theologian)|Prior]] revisits the old ground [in his book ''The Bible and colonialism: a moral critique''] … First, the biblical narrative, with its 'divine promise' was inherently linked with the mandate to ethnically cleanse or exterminate the indigenous people … third, in the narrative of the Book of Deuteronomy the divine command to commit 'genocide' is explicit.  Fourth, genocide and mass slaughter follow in the Book of Joshua.  These highly dubious traditions of the Bible have been kept before subsequent generations of Jews and Christians in their prayers…. The historical evidence, however, strongly suggests that such [[genocidal massacre]]s never actually took place, although these racist, xenophobic and militaristic narratives remained for later generations as powerful examples of divine aid in battle and of a divine command for widespread slaughter of an enemy…. [Professor Bernardo Gandulla, of the University of Buenos Aires], while sharing Prior's critique of the perverse use that Zionism and the State of Israel have made of the Bible to support their 'ethnic cleansing' policies in Palestine, …  Prior … found incitement to war and violence in the very foundation documents of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.  In the Hebrew Bible, for instance, there is a dominant strand that sees God as ethnocentric and militaristic.  Furthermore, in their conquest of Canaan, the Israelites are commanded by Yahweh to destroy the indigenous inhabitants of Palestine.  Later in the days of the Israelite kingdoms, they are urged to show no pity, but to massacre their enemies…. Today, both Christian Zionists in the West and Israeli messianics continue to refer to the Hebrew Scriptures for archetypal conflicts, which guide their attitudes towards the indigenous inhabitants of Palestine: the Palestinian Muslims and Christians."  Masalha refers to: [[Michael Prior (theologian)|Prior, Michael P.]], ''The Bible and colonialism: a moral critique'', Sheffield Academic Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur Grenke quotes historian, author and scholar [[David Stannard]]: "Discussing the influence of Christian beliefs on the destruction of the Native peoples in the Americas, Stannard argues that while the New Testament view of war is ambiguous, there is little such ambiguity in the Old Testament. He points to sections in Deuteronomy in which the Israelite God, Yahweh, commanded that the Israelites utterly destroy idolaters whose land they sought to reserve for the worship of their deity (Deut 7:2, 16, and 20:16–17). ... According to Stannard, this view of war contributed to the ... destruction of the Native peoples in the Americas. It was this view that also led to the destruction of European Jewry. Accordingly, it is important to look at this particular segment of the Old Testament: it not only describes a situation where a group undertakes to totally destroy other groups, but it also had a major influence on shaping thought and belief systems that permitted, and even inspired, genocide.&lt;ref&gt;Grenke, Arthur, ''God, greed, and genocide: the Holocaust through the centuries'', New Academia Publishing, LLC, 2005, pp 17–18: "Discussing the influence of Christian beliefs on the destruction of the Native peoples in the Americas, Stannard argues that while the New Testament view of war is ambiguous, there is little such ambiguity in the Old Testament. He points to sections in Deuteronomy in which the Israelite God, Yahweh, commanded that the Israelites utterly destroy idolaters whose land they sought to reserve for the worship of their deity (Deut 7:2, 16, and 20:16-17). … According to Stannard, this view of war contributed to the .. destruction of the Native peoples in the Americas.

Sociologists Frank Robert Chalk and Kurt Jonassohn question "the applicability of the term [genocide] to earlier periods of history, and the judgmental and moral loadings that have become associated with it."&lt;ref name="Frank Robert Chalk"&gt;{{cite book|author1-last=Chalk| author1-first="Frank Robert"| author2-last=Jonassohn| author2-first=Kurt| title=The History and Sociology of Genocide: Analyses and Case Studies| year=1990| publisher = Yale University Press| location=New Haven, Connecticut| isbn=0-300-04445-3| pages=3, 23–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since most societies of the past endured and practiced genocide, it was accepted as "being in the nature of life" because of the "coarseness and brutality" of life.&lt;ref name="Frank Robert Chalk"/&gt;{{rp|27}} Chalk and Jonassohn say the Old Testament contains cases they would consider genocide (if they were factual) because of women and children being killed even though it was war and casualties in war are excluded from the definition of genocide.

Arie Versluis says, "...indigenous populations have also appealed to the command (in Deut.7) in order to expel their colonizers.

Scholar Leonard B. Glick states that [[Jewish fundamentalism|Jewish fundamentalists]] in Israel, such as [[Shlomo Aviner]], consider the [[Palestinians]] to be like biblical Canaanites, and that some fundamentalist leaders suggest that they "must be prepared to destroy" the Palestinians if the Palestinians do not leave the land.&lt;ref&gt;Glick, Leonard B., "Religion and Genocide", in ''The Widening circle of genocide'',   Alan L. Berger (Ed). Transaction Publishers, 1994, p 46::"[God] looked with favor on what we may fairly call their [Israelite] proto-genocidal destructiveness.  The Book of Joshua provides us with one of the earliest texts in which a deity quite plainly promotes the destruction of a people.  As the Hebrews, under Joshua's leadership, undertake the conquest of Canaan, they massacre everyone who stands in their way…. It is instructive (and distressing) to note that contemporary Jewish ultra-nationalists in Israel root their politics in the Book of Joshua and equate their territorial aspirations with the will of God.  Here, for example, is [[Shlomo Aviner]], a prominent theorist of the Gush Emunim … movement: 'from the point of view of mankind's humanistic morality we were in the wrong in (taking the land) from the Canaanites.  There is only one catch.  The command of God ordered us to be the people of the land of Israel'.  Others have identified the Palestinians as 'Canaanites' who are engaged in a 'suicidal' struggle opposing God's own intentions;  hence the Jewish people must be prepared to destroy them if they persist in pursuing their collective 'death-wish'."&lt;/ref&gt; Several scholars draw similar conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Whitelam, Keith W., ''The invention of ancient Israel: the silencing of Palestinian history'', Routledge, 1996, especially pp 71–121.  Cited by Ehrlich,  pp 117 "Keith Whitelam (1996) has published a book [''The invention of ancient Israel: the silencing of Palestinian history''] in which he has implied that the modern European imperialist Zionist Jewish movement has drawn inspiration from the biblical conquest tradition … Parallels are thus drawn in Whitelam's thought between the genocidal Israelites presumably of Joshua's day and the racist Zionists of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and also between the ancient Canaanites and the modern Palestinians … the interpretations attributed to [Whitelam] of the place of the book of Joshua and its … genocidal account of Israel's emergence in the land that it claims as its own pose a challenge to Judaism…. It thus behooves us to ask … how has the Jewish community dealt with these foundational narratives, saturated as they are with acts of violence against others?…."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boustan, Ra'anan S., ''Violence, Scripture, and Textual Practice in Early Judaism and Christianity'', BRILL, 2010, page 4-5
:"Later readers of the Bible dramatically transformed this divine directive [Deut 20:15-18] through hermeneutic alignment of the Canaanites with the current detested 'other'.  Thus the Canaanites have been identified with … Palestinians (by militant Zionists), and scores of other 'enemies' of Israel.  In doing so, the violence perpetrated against these groups is not only justified, but indeed, part and parcel of the original divine plan.  The violent legacy of the Bible is a product of both its own violent narrative and the hermeneutics of violence applied to it".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[René Girard]], historian, literary critic, and philosopher of social science says that, "desire is mimetic (i.e. all of our desires are borrowed from other people), that all conflict originates in mimetic desire (mimetic rivalry), that the scapegoat mechanism is the origin of sacrifice and the foundation of human culture, and religion was necessary in human evolution to control the violence that can come from mimetic rivalry, and that the Bible reveals these ideas and denounces the scapegoat mechanism.".&lt;ref name="René Girard"&gt;{{cite book | last=Girard | first=René | title=The Scapegoat | year=1986 | publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press | location=Baltimore | isbn=0-8018-3315-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher, sociologist, theologian and author [[Jacques Ellul]] says: "I believe that the biblical teaching is clear. It always contests political power. It incites to "counterpower," to "positive" criticism, to an irreducible dialogue (like that between king and prophet in Israel), to antistatism, to a decentralizing of the relation, to an extreme relativizing of everything political, to an anti-ideology, to a questioning of all that claims either power or dominion (in other words, of all things political)...Throughout the Old Testament we see God choosing what is weak and humble to represent him (the stammering Moses, the infant Samuel, Saul from an insignificant family, David confronting Goliath, etc.). Paul tells us that God chooses the weak things of the world to confound the mighty..."

In the ''[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]'', Favazza wrote that "This is a very fair and respectful book.... The book sets a new standard of excellence for works on religion and psychology. Although it lacks any biological or psychiatric focus, I highly recommend it to colleagues who desire to organize their thoughts about religion." (p.&amp;nbsp;988&lt;ref name=favazza98/&gt;).

In ''The Gerontologist'', George wrote that it was 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
the Best book that I have read on religion from a psychosocial perspective. As the title indicates, the primary focus of this volume is examination of the links between religion and coping. One of the important qualities of this book is that there is no effort to view religion as one form of coping or to view coping as a manifest function of religion. Each concept is treated in careful conceptual and empirical detail, and the links that emerge testify to the importance of each, separately and jointly. The scope of the book is encyclopedic. I could not identify a question that I had that was not addressed. (p. 508&lt;ref name=george98/&gt;)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the ''[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]'', McFadden wrote that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This book represents a major theoretical and empirical contribution not only to the psychology of religion and clinical/counseling psychology but to other fields as well. Along with psychologists, persons in religious professions can learn much from Pargament. Mental health professionals, who traditionally have shunned religion in their own lives and in the lived experience of their clients, might be persuaded by Pargament's broadband approach to investigate how religion operates in the tales of coping and crisis they hear on a daily basis. (p. 368&lt;ref name=mcfadden98/&gt;)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
She added that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This book is also appropriate for use in courses on the psychology of religion. My students have responded positively to Pargament's careful exposition of his theory, the support he offers in examples from his research and clinical practice, and his engaging use of metaphor. (pp. 368-369&lt;ref name=mcfadden98/&gt;)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]]'', McIntosh wrote that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The weaknesses of this book are a function of its strengths. By aiming for a wide audience the book must cover a lot of ground, some of which is elementary review for some of the readership. The book probes deeply into the complexities of the topic and is encyclopedic in its coverage of the research; it is therefore somewhat daunting in size. By not avoiding the theoretical controversies and empirical weaknesses in this area, the conclusions are sometimes uncertain and the implications more muddy than in less open-eyed, more partisan work.... I highly recommend this book to scholars and practitioners of psychology and religion. It will likely be a long wait until another such impressive work in this area appears. (pp. 702-703&lt;ref name=mcintosh99/&gt;)

'''''Veritatis splendor''''' ([[Latin]]: ''The Splendor of the Truth'') is an [[encyclical]] by [[Pope John Paul II]]. It expresses the position of the [[Catholicism|Catholic Church]] regarding fundamentals of the Church's role in moral teaching. The encyclical is one of the most comprehensive and philosophical teachings of moral theology in the Catholic tradition. It was [[Promulgation|promulgated]] on 6 August 1993.

==Summary==
''Veritatis splendor'' responds to questions of [[Ethics in religion|moral theology]] that had been raised during the postconciliar period of the Church (events after the [[Vatican II]] ecumenical council of 1962-65). These questions revolve around man's ability to discern good, the existence of evil, the role of human freedom and human [[conscience]], [[mortal sin]], and the authority of the [[magisterium]] of the Catholic Church in guiding man. In response to these, Pope John Paul II emphatically says that moral truth is knowable, that the choice of good or evil has a profound effect on one's relationship with God, and that there is no true contradiction between freedom and following the good. ''Veritatis splendor'' consists of three chapters: (I) Teacher, What Good Must I Do; (II) Do Not Be Conformed to this World; and (III) Lest the Cross of Christ be Emptied of its Power.

===Response to moral relativism===
''Veritatis splendor'' begins by asserting that there are indeed absolute truths accessible to all persons. Contrary to the philosophy of [[moral relativism]], the encyclical says that moral law is universal across people in varying cultures, and is in fact rooted in the human condition. Pope John Paul teaches that no matter how separated someone is from God, "in the depths of his heart there always remains a yearning for absolute truth and a thirst to attain full knowledge of it." He goes on to say that the splendor of truth "shines forth deep within the human spirit."

===[[Moral authority]] of the Catholic Church===
Ultimately, John Paul teaches, "to ask about the good, in fact, ultimately means to turn towards God, the fullness of goodness." Against the idea that the Church's teaching body has a mainly exhortatory role, the pope reiterates the Catholic doctrine that the magisterium of the Catholic Church has authority to definitively pronounce on moral questions. Even more, John Paul teaches that the Church is Christ's particular response to help answer everyone's question of what is right and wrong.

===Human freedom and divine law===
John Paul teaches that there is no true conflict between human freedom and God's law. The true end of human freedom is growth as a mature person into how each is created by God. Furthermore, God's divine law governing human behavior is not opposed to human freedom, but rather "it protects and promotes that freedom."

The encyclical affirms that today's respect for human freedom "represents one of the positive achievements of modern culture." However, he cautions, though it is a good, human freedom is not in itself an absolute. Merely deciding for oneself that one may do something is not at all a true substitute for determining whether something is in fact good or bad. Because God is the true author of good, it remains of critical importance to understand how the divine Law, as expressed by the authoritative magisterium of the Church, considers an issue before determining absolutely for oneself.

===Natural law===
The pope welcomes and supports the role of human reason in discovering and applying the natural law (those aspects of the moral law that may be discovered without divine revelation). Nevertheless, because God remains the true author of moral law, he states that human reason will not properly supersede the elements of the moral law that are of divine origin—the encyclical states that this "would be the death of true freedom." In particular, John Paul denies those ideas of morality that treat the human body as a "raw datum," separating man and how he uses his body from his greater meaning derived from the entirety of his person.

===The judgment of conscience===
John Paul reiterates the longstanding Catholic teaching that people are obliged to follow their [[conscience]], and that if they do not, they are condemned by their own conscience.

John Paul depicts conscience as a form of inner dialogue. However, he says, it is not merely a dialogue of a man with himself, but it is very much a dialogue between man and God. Following [[Bonaventure]], John Paul likens conscience to a herald from God who proclaims the divine law. In opposition to how it is often represented elsewhere, John Paul says that conscience is emphatically not a replacement for the divine law. Rather, it is the process by which a person may apply the divinely revealed law to the concrete situation at hand.

''Veritatis splendor'' states that because conscience may err in its judgment, a person is obliged to do his best to inform his conscience. Hence, it remains crucial for a person to make an effort to understand what the divine law on a matter is, as expressed by the Church, and the reasons behind it. Even if a person is not condemned by his conscience for a morally wrong act, committing that act nevertheless causes damage in other ways, and if done habitually it can progressively make it harder for a person to perceive the truth. Furthermore, habitual sin enslaves us, so following a wrong judgment of conscience is in the end a step away from freedom.

===The "fundamental option," sin, and salvation===
The encyclical also responds to the idea of the "fundamental option." In this way of thinking, a man's particular actions do not necessarily affect his ultimate salvation—what is important is his fundamental orientation towards or against God. The pope writes:

"There is no doubt that Christian moral teaching, even in its Biblical roots, acknowledges the specific importance of a fundamental choice which qualifies the moral life and engages freedom on a radical level before God. It is a question of the decision of faith, of the obedience of faith (cf. Rom 16:26) "by which man makes a total and free self-commitment to God, offering 'the full submission of intellect and will to God as he reveals' "."&lt;ref&gt;''Veritatis Splendor'', 66&lt;/ref&gt;

John Paul firmly opposes the theological assertion that such a fundamental choice can be separated from particular actions, stating that it is contrary to Scripture as well as to long-held Catholic teaching on sin and salvation. He also opposes it on philosophical grounds, writing, "To separate the fundamental option from concrete kinds of behaviour means to contradict the substantial integrity or personal unity of the moral agent in his body and in his soul."

John Paul emphasizes that the "fundamental option" view undermines the traditional Catholic understanding on [[mortal sin]] and [[venial sin]], their distinction, and effects: "For mortal sin exists also when a person knowingly and willingly, for whatever reason, chooses something gravely disordered.... The person turns away from God and loses charity."

===Reality of intrinsically evil acts===
The encyclical also says that certain acts are intrinsically  evil. In the language of Catholic moral theology, this means that certain acts are always wrong, and that there are never circumstances in which they may be permitted if done knowingly and intentionally. Stated another way, this is a strong support for the long-held doctrine of Catholic moral theology that "the ends do not justify the means." John Paul bases this on the argument that certain acts are so destructive to the human person that there are no extenuating circumstances that would allow them. As an example, John Paul specifically mentions the teaching of [[Pope Paul VI]] on contraception, which stipulates that although it is permissible to tolerate a lesser evil to prevent a greater one, or to promote a greater good, it is never permissible, even in the gravest of circumstances to intentionally do an evil so that good may come of it. Or in other words it is never permissible to intend directly something which contradicts a moral order. This reiterates  Paul VI's teaching on contraception, and that if an act is intrinsically evil, a good intention or particular circumstances can diminish their evil, but they cannot remove it.

=== Possibility of obeying the commandments ===
John Paul teaches that man can and must respect the norm of morality even in the most difficult situations: "Temptations can be overcome, sins can be avoided, because together with the commandments the Lord gives us the possibility of keeping them."&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', 102&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected the proposition that the Church's teaching is essentially only an "ideal" which must then be adapted to each case.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., 103&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=January 2008}}

The '''Wheel of time''' or '''wheel of history''' (also known as ''[[Kalachakra]]'') is a concept found in several religious traditions and philosophies, notably religions of Indian origin such as [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]], and [[Buddhism]], which regard time as [[Historic recurrence|cyclical]] and consisting of repeating ages.  Many other cultures contain belief in a similar concept: notably, the Q'ero Indians in [[Peru]], as well as the Hopi Indians of Arizona.

==Buddhism==
{{See also|Kalachakra}}
The [[Kalachakra|Wheel of Time]] or Kalachakra is a [[Tantra|Tantric]] deity that is associated with [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Tantric Buddhism]], which encompasses all four main schools of [[Sakya]], [[Nyingma]], [[Kagyu]] and [[Gelug]], and is especially important within the lesser-known [[Jonang]] tradition.

The Kalachakra tantra prophesies a world within which (religious) conflict is prevalent. A worldwide war will be waged which will see the expansion of the mystical Kingdom of [[Shambhala]] led by a messianic king.

==Ancient Rome==
The philosopher and emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] saw time as extending forwards to infinity and backwards to infinity, while admitting the possibility (without arguing the case) that "the administration of the universe is organized into a succession of finite periods".&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Aurelius. ''Meditations'', book 5, paragraph 13. {{ISBN|978-0-19-957320-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage==

===Literature===
In an interview included with the [[audiobook]] editions of his novels, author [[Robert Jordan]] has stated that his bestselling fantasy series ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' borrows the titular concept from Hindu mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Jordan chats about his 'Wheel of Time' series|url=http://www.cnn.com/chat/transcripts/2000/12/12/jordan/|website=CNN|publisher=CNN|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
Several episodes of the American TV series ''[[Lost (2004 TV series)|Lost]]'' feature a wheel which can be physically turned in order to manipulate space and time. In a series of episodes during the fifth season, the island on which the show takes place begins to skip violently back and forth through time after the wheel is pulled off its axis.

The '''World Index of Moral Freedom'''&lt;ref&gt;'''[http://www.fundalib.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/World-Index-of-Moral-Freedom-web.pdf World Index of Moral Freedom (WIMF)]'''&lt;/ref&gt; is an international index ranking one hundred and sixty countries on their performance on five categories of indicators: '''religious freedom''' (taking into account both the freedom to practice any religion or none, and the situation of religious control on the state); '''bioethical freedom''' (including the legal status of abortion, euthanasia and other practices pertaining to bioethics, like surrogacy or stem cell research); '''drugs freedom''' (including the legal status of cannabis and the country's general policy on hard drugs); '''sexual freedom''' (including the legal status of pornography and sex services among consenting adults, and the country's age of sexual consent), and '''family and gender freedom''' (including women's freedom of movement, the legal status of cohabitation of unmarried couples, same sex marriage and the situation of transgender people). The index is sponsored and published by the Foundation for the Advancement of Liberty, a [[libertarian]] [[think tank]] based in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]. The WIMF's first edition was published on April 2, 2016, co-authored by Foundation researchers Andreas Kohl and Juan Pina. A second edition was published by the same foundation in July, 2018, this time authored by Juan Pina and Emma Watson.

== Purpose ==
The World Index of Moral Freedom aims at completing the views presented by other international [[freedom indices]] measuring general freedom or aspects thereof (press freedom, economic freedom, etcetera). To do so, the Index aims at responding a simple question: how free from state-imposed moral constraints are human beings depending on their countries of residence? The research conducted tries to determine the degree of individual freedom to take decisions pertaining to the great moral debates of our time. The first edition of the WIMF includes a short note on the comparison between its country ranking and those of the other freedom indices.

== Categories studied and classification of countries ==
Each category of indicators is worth twenty points (20% of the total score) and aims at responding the following questions:
* '''''Category A.''''' Religious indicators. How free is the practice of any religion or none, and how religious-controlled is the state.
* '''''Category B.''''' Bioethical indicators. How free is individual decision making on matters posing bioethical questions.
* '''''Category C.''''' Drugs indicators. How free is the production, trade and consumption of substances deemed harmful.
* '''''Category D.''''' Sexuality indicators. How free are sexual intercourse, pornography and sex services among consenting adults.
* '''''Category E.''''' Gender &amp; family indicators. How free are women, LGBT individuals and unmarried couples living together.

Each category is made up of various indicators (normally one or two leading indicators adjusted by one or two lesser wheighted ones), the weight of which is set in view of their inferred relevance towards the category's overall score. Countries have been classified towards each category according to the information available in the sources reviewed. All category results and the general index itself are presented in a 0-100 point scale. Countries are classified according to the following intervals:
* 90-100 points – ''Highest moral freedom''
* 80-90 points – ''Very high moral freedom''
* 60-80 points – ''High moral freedom''
* 50-60 points – ''Acceptable moral freedom''
* 40-50 points – ''Insufficient moral freedom''
* 20-40 points – ''Low moral freedom''
* 10-20 points – ''Very low moral freedom''
* 0-10 points – ''Lowest moral freedom''

== Findings of the WIMF's first edition ==

=== State of moral freedom around the world ===
Only one country, the [[Netherlands]], is classified as having the "highest" level of moral freedom by scoring slightly over the 90 points required for that label. Just four countries make it into the upper twenty points, and only ten pass the 75 point threshold. Out of the 160 countries considered, only 64 "pass the exam" and score 50 points or more. And around 30% of all countries fall in the "low", "very low" or "lowest" moral freedom areas of the index. Technology and the cultural globalization that it produces are deemed by the authors to be the most powerful driving forces towards acceptance of individual moral freedom.

=== Netherlands ===
With a three-point (three per cent) advantage over their closest competitor and eight points over the third, the Netherlands top the 2016 country ranking. The Dutch score is twenty-one points higher than the average of all countries enjoying "high" or "very high" moral freedom. For many decades, whenever moral freedom was discussed, the Netherlands had the least interventionist policies. The first country to fight [[human trafficking]] by legalising sex services performed by [[consenting adults]], or to normalize the use of [[cannabis]], or to acknowledge [[same sex marriage]] already in 2001, performs remarkably high in most indicators considered towards the index.

=== Latin countries ===
A trend may be inferred towards international unification of the legal and political approach to moral issues. And that trend favours the Western world's predominant choice for low moral interference by the state. This is particularly noticeable when looking at the index performance of many Southern European and [[Latin American]] countries, which seem to reveal a fast cultural evolution from traditional, conservative values into a laissez-faire approach to morality. Four of the top ten countries are Latin American or Iberian, while six other Latin countries in Southern Europe and the Americas make it to the "high moral freedom" region of the index. The particular performance of countries like [[Portugal]] or [[Uruguay]] is much higher than their recent history would indicate. These and other Latin countries seem to have discarded their traditional background of religiously influenced governance.

=== Islamic countries and other religious-influenced states ===
The fifteen lowest scoring countries at the World Index of Moral Freedom are [[Islamic]] and located in the [[Persian Gulf]], North-Eastern [[Africa]] and the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. This is also true for the region's economically free enclaves in the area. [[Saudi Arabia]] comes last (160th) in the ranking and doesn't even score ten points out of the one hundred potentially available. Only four predominantly Islamic countries obtain more than fifty points: [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Albania]], [[Turkey]] and [[Kazakhstan]]. A few non Islamic countries also show low levels of moral freedom which the authors consider likely to be due to a strong political leverage held by another [[religion]]. These include [[Belarus]] ([[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]), [[Israel]] ([[Jewish]]), [[Nepal]] ([[Hinduist]]), the [[Philippines]] ([[Catholic]]), [[Thailand]] ([[Buddhist]]), [[Tonga]] ([[Methodist]]), or [[Tuvalu]] ([[Calvinist]]).

=== Russia ===
In [[Russia]], moral [[conservatism]], derived from either the Orthodox faith or traditional culture, seems to have replaced [[marxism]] as the basis for an ongoing, though softer, social engineering by the state. Russia's score is just in the middle of the classification, a position shared by some of her cultural and political allies, like [[Serbia]] or [[Moldova]], while politically unfree [[Belarus]] falls further below. In all of these countries, the freedom of [[LGBT]] individuals is a matter of particular concern.

=== Communist countries ===
The remaining [[communist]] regimes coerce their citizens into abiding by a moral code based on allegedly scientific views. Freedom of conscience and the practice of any religion are repressed. In the case of the [[People's Republic of China]], decades of limited economic liberalization have not resulted in an equally noticeable moral openness. Two other communist regimes, [[North Korea]] and [[Vietnam]], fall further down into the low moral freedom area, while moral freedom is deemed insufficient in [[Laos]] and just slightly over the fifty point threshold in socialist [[Venezuela]] or in outright communist [[Cuba]].

=== Other findings ===
For different reasons, often including abnormally low scores in a particular set of indicators, a few Western countries which perform reasonably high in other freedom indices rank rather low at the WIMF. [[Hungary]] and [[Norway]] fail to make it into the "high moral freedom" area, although just for under half a point. The [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Ireland|Irish]] performance is particularly low within the moral freedom area. [[Iceland]], [[Japan]], [[Poland]] and [[Romania]] barely manage to pass the fifty point mark, while [[Singapore]], [[Israel]] or [[South Korea]] fall in the "insufficient moral freedom" part of the index. While most countries topping the WIMF in its first edition belong to the [[developed world]], some countries with a lesser degree of development have also made their way into the higher classification areas. [[Cambodia]], scoring just over seventy points, obtains the fifteenth place in the global classification and is the first developing country in the index. It is also worth noting that the four European micro-states considered −the principalities of [[Andorra]] and [[Monaco]] and the republics of [[San Marino]] and [[Malta]]− score surprisingly low in comparison with their bigger neighbours. In spite of their high [[living standards]] and [[economic freedom]], these countries fail to perform similarly when it comes to moral freedom. A similar situation is observed in Caribbean and South Pacific island micro-states, which score poorly in most categories and rank in the lower areas of the WIMF classification. This similarity between very small countries in different regions, in spite of the cultural influence of their neighbours and allies, may lead to the conclusion that moral freedom is affected, among other relevant factors, by country size.
